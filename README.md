CS412 - Search Project
=========

###Description##

This repo contains the project produced for the class CS412 - Data access and Mining at the University of Strathclyde.

The aim of the project is to build and evaluate an information retrieval system using the Java [Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/) library. We were assigned data sets and as such where to design a system and interface that would fulfil a user who wanted to access that data's requests. Our data set contained a text representation of The Wall Street Journal's physical release.
