CS412 - Search Project
=========

###Description##

This repo contains the project produced for the class CS412 - Data access and Mining at the University of Strathclyde.

The aim of the project is to build and evaluate an information retrieval system using the Java [Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/) library. We were assigned data sets and as such where to design a system and interface that would fulfil a user who wanted to access that data's requests. Our data set contained am XML representation of The Wall Street Journal's physical release.

We decided to build a web application for this task, utilising Java and Spring Boot server side and building a SPA on the client side.
