	<p class="article-leader">UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. -- MCA Inc. said that first-quarter
net income rose 15% to $31.6 million, or 42 cents a share,
despite a $21.5 million loss attributable to the
entertainment concern's stake in Cineplex Odeon Corp.
   In the year-earlier quarter, MCA posted net income of
$27.3 million, or 37 cents a share. Those results included
$5.2 million of profit from Cineplex Odeon, the Toronto-based
movie theater chain in which MCA holds a 49.9% stake.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Revenue in the latest quarter jumped 30% to $912.9 million
from $703.3 million.</p>
<p>MCA results were bolstered by the strong performance of
the company's filmed entertainment group, which benefited
from the continuing success of such releases as "Back to the
Future Part II" and "Born on the Fourth of July." Theatrical
films revenue more than doubled in the quarter to $184.2
million from $79.9 million.</p>
<p>Revenue from the company's home video and pay television
operations increased by 48% to $169.4 million from $114.3
million. However, the filmed entertainment group's results
were hurt by lower foreign television sales.</p>
<p>MCA's pretax operating profit climbed 8% to $71.1 million,
including $75.7 million from the filmed entertainment group.
In the year-ago quarter, operating profit was $65.6 million,
including $42.6 million from filmed entertainment.</p>
<p>MCA's music division posted a 8% increase in operating
profit to $12.6 million, on a 35% increase in sales of $208.5
million. Book publishing profit jumped 72% to $9.9 million
from $5.7 million. Retail and mail order business continued
to show a loss, $9.4 million compared with $8.3 million last
year, partly because the 1990 Easter holiday fell in the
second quarter. Broadcasting and cable operations profits
rose 8% to $3.8 million from $3.5 million.</p>
