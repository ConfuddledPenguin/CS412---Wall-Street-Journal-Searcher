	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The dollar dropped almost one yen yesterday on
continuing sentiment that the U.S. unit was overbought at its
recent levels near 160 yen. The move continued the dollar's
slide against the yen that began Wednesday.
   But the dollar strengthened against the mark in the wake
of strong mark-selling for yen. The effects of the heavy
selling of the West German currency against its Japanese
counterpart spread to benefit the U.S. unit as well.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The dollar staged a rebound after hitting its intraday low
of 156.20 yen. But the recovery was seen by the traders as
only a temporary reprieve from the day's move toward a
stronger yen. The dollar finished mostly higher against other
currencies.</p>
<p>Some traders attributed the yen's broad strength to a move
by Japanese investors back into the Tokyo stock market and
out of dollar-denominated investments.</p>
<p>In Tokyo, the Nikkei stock index surged for the second
straight day, ending 696.35 points higher at 29,945.41, a
gain of 2.38%. The index rose 787.46 points on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"Capital flows are dictating the course of the market" as
the Japanese take money home to support their own securities
markets, said Susan Babcock, vice president of corporate
foreign exchange at Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. in New
York.</p>
<p>After the recent steep loss of value in Japanese stocks,
the low prices are attracting investors once again, weakening
the dollar and the mark as the Japanese reduce the amount of
their U.S. and West German investments, Ms. Babcock said.</p>
<p>Rumors Wednesday that the Japanese Ministry of Finance is
encouraging insurance companies to restrict their investments
in dollar-denominated assets continued to have an impact on
trading yesterday. Traders said the dollar's losses began
with selling early in the global day in Tokyo.</p>
<p>A rush to liquidate long-mark positions against the yen --
which began in Tokyo -- accelerated during the European day,
bringing the mark down from 94.30 yen at the end of Tokyo
trading to 93.35 yen at the end of trading in London.</p>
<p>The mark rebounded somewhat against the yen later in the
U.S., ending at 93.67 yen, down from 94.58 yen late Wednesday
in New York.</p>
<p>The sell-off of the mark against the Japanese currency was
the major source of support for the dollar against the West
German unit in otherwise lethargic dollar-mark trading, said
Morris Armstrong, vice president and foreign exchange manager
at Girozentrale Vienna in New York.</p>
<p>For the time being, participants are concentrating more on
the yen's value against the mark and the dollar than on the
U.S. currency's rate against the mark, Mr. Armstrong said.</p>
<p>In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 1.6784 marks, up from 1.6722 marks late Wednesday, and at
157.20 yen, down from 158.10 yen late Wednesday. Sterling was
quoted at $1.6455, up from $1.6392 Wednesday.</p>
<p>In early trading in Tokyo Friday, the dollar was quoted at
156.95 yen, down from Thursday's Tokyo close of 157.75 yen.
Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at about 1.6785 marks.</p>
<p>Remarks made yesterday by Treasury officials expressing
support for the yen were seen by traders as resulting from
concern that the weak yen could hurt efforts to reduce the
size of the U.S. trade gap with Japan, and also from worries
that Japanese investors might stay away from an important
Treasury refunding operation in May if the dollar is too
strong.</p>
<p>David Mulford, the Treasury's undersecretary for
international affairs, said yesterday that the recent
depreciation of the yen poses "important risks" for the world
economy. And Thomas Dallara, assistant Treasury secretary,
stated that continued yen weakness against the dollar could
damage the effort to reduce global trade imbalances.</p>
<p>The remarks followed the release Wednesday of the
Treasury's report to Congress on exchange rates. The report
also said the yen's fall against the dollar is a matter of
concern for the U.S.</p>
<p>But Hongkong & Shanghai's Ms. Babcock said the statements
by the U.S. officials had little importance. "With the yen
already correcting, {the U.S.} might as well make a show of
looking supportive" of the Japanese, she said.</p>
<p>In Tokyo, the dollar finished at 157.75 yen, down sharply
from 159.87 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo in moderate,
technical dealings.</p>
<p>In European dealings, the dollar ended mostly lower
against the major currencies in active trading, a reflection
of a resurgent yen and a rush to take some profits.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery rose $1.20 to $377.30 an ounce. Estimated volume was
a moderate 2.5 million ounces.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong Friday, gold opened at $377.89 an ounce.</p>
