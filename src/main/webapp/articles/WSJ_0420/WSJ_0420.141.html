	<p class="article-leader">Great American Bank disclosed that its underperforming
assets jumped 42% in the fourth quarter, contributing to its
previously reported net loss for the period and casting a
pall over the thrift's survival plans.
   On Dec. 31, Great American reported underperforming assets
of $645.6 million, compared with $453.4 million on Sept. 30,
according to a regulatory filing with the Office of Thrift
Supervision. The company's total "classified" assets, a
broader measure of actual or potential loan problems, rose
59% to $1.30 billion from $814.6 million at Sept. 30, the
filing said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The increases help explain the $198.9 million, or $8.30 a
share, net loss that the company reported on Tuesday for the
fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with year-earlier
profit of $19.8 million, or 80 cents. The capital-consuming
effect of the deficit, and other problems, has left San
Diego-based Great American, the nation's eighth-largest
thrift with $15.9 billion in assets, on the verge of having
to sell or dismantle itself or face possible federal seizure.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Great American said it was making provision
for loan and foreclosed real-estate losses of $271.2 million,
but declined to specify the size of its troubled-loan
portfolio. According to the OTS filing, the company had loss
reserves on Dec. 31 equal to about 19% of its underperforming
assets, excluding previous write-downs, and had set aside
reserves or taken write-downs equal to about 35% of its total
troubled assets.</p>
<p>Analysts said the growth in troubled assets, largely
reflecting a disastrous 1986 acquisition of an Arizona
thrift, will complicate Great American's efforts to save
itself. At year-end, according to the filing, roughly 23% of
the thrift's total $2.6 billion of assets in Arizona were
considered real or potential trouble. The company must raise
$350 million in new capital by year-end as part of a
regulator-approved plan unveiled earlier this week to comply
with minimum federal capital standards.</p>
<p>A Great American spokesman said the company considers its
loss reserves to be adequate. He added: "We are still
discussing the bank with a number of qualified investors, and
are proceeding with our operations according to our capital
plan."</p>
<p>The three biggest California banks -- BankAmerica Corp.,
Security Pacific Corp., and Wells Fargo & Co. -- are
interested in expanding in the lucrative San Diego market and
are considered potential bidders for Great American.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Great American slipped 37.5 cents to $3.625.</p>
