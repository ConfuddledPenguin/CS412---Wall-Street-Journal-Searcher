	<p class="article-leader">BUENOS AIRES -- Javier Gonzalez Fraga will take over as
Argentina's Central Bank president a second time during the
nine-month government of President Carlos Menem.
   Mr. Gonzalez Fraga was Mr. Menem's first Central Bank
president after the Peronist Party government was installed
last July. He resigned on Nov. 27, reportedly because the
Economy Ministry rejected his plans to free the exchange rate
and manage foreign currency reserves differently.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the event, Economy Minister Nestor Rapanelli was
replaced last December. His successor, Antonio Gonzalez,
freed the exchange rate along with controls on wages and
prices.</p>
<p>The government recently has built up currency reserves by
buying U.S. dollars in the sort of "dirty float" Mr. Gonzalez
Fraga suggested last year.</p>
