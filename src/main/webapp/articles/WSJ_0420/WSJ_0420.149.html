	<p class="article-leader">Citing a 45% jump in international sales, Reebok
International Ltd. reported first-quarter net income of $52.7
million, or 46 cents a share, up 7%, from $49.9 million, or
43 cents last year.
   Total sales were up 13%, to $554.4 million, from $488.5
million last year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Stoughton, Mass., footwear concern said U.S. sales of
Reebok footwear grew about 2% during the current quarter.</p>
<p>The company said sales increases at its Rockport and
Ellesse divisions and the addition of sales of its Boston
Whaler division, acquired last October, were "largely" offset
by a decrease in sales at its Avia unit.</p>
<p>A company spokesman said sales for Avia were $48.2 million
in the latest quarter, down 26%, from $64.9 million in the
year-ago period.</p>
<p>He said the Avia segment, under new management since last
year, "needed focusing" and has had to be "positioned to a
point from which it can grow." He declined to predict the
group's annual sales, which totaled $196.2 million last year.</p>
<p>He said the unit is now concentrating on "pure atheletic"
shoes.</p>
