	<p class="article-leader">Maybe Marty Shugrue's business card should read "Troubled
Airlines My Specialty."
   Mr. Shugrue started yesterday as bankruptcy
court-appointed trustee of Eastern Airlines with stints at
financially strapped Pan American Airways and Continental
Airlines already on his resume.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>His latest job, de facto chief executive officer of
Eastern, undoubtedly tops the list of the toughest in the
airline industry at the moment. Mr. Shugrue must rebuild the
anemic Texas Air Corp. unit that has been decimated by a
lengthy machinists strike and resulting Chapter 11 filing and
that has lost the confidence of travelers, especially
business passengers essential to profitability. U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland gave Mr. Shugrue the job
after finding the management at Eastern and its parent
"unfit" to operate the carrier.</p>
<p>"I have received strong pledges of cooperation from
Eastern Airlines' management, the creditors' committee and
Texas Air," Mr. Shugrue said in a statement. The veteran
airline executive didn't return numerous phone calls.</p>
<p>A former associate of Mr. Shugrue believes the court
picked the right man for the job. "Marty fits the bill real
well," said Donald Garvett, a former Pan Am vice president.
"He understands and respects people," but he also is "a man
of action who gets things done and makes hard decisions when
he has to."</p>
<p>Mr. Garvett credits Mr. Shugrue with shoring up travel
agent support for Pan Am, cutting costs, retaining the
respect of labor and keeping good managers during tough
times. "Part of the reason Pan Am is in business today stems
from things Marty could accomplish under difficult
circumstances."</p>
<p>Mr. Shugrue, 49 years old, has yet to effect a clear-cut
airline turnaround, however. After some 20 years at Pan Am,
in jobs ranging from pilot to vice chairman, he was fired
following a showdown with other board members over Pan Am's
future. He left that carrier in January 1988 when it was
still mired in financial difficulties.</p>
<p>He landed at Continental Airlines, another Texas Air unit,
as that carrier's fifth president in as many years. Industry
executives and analysts had heralded the much needed
operating experience in marketing, personnel and
adminstration he brought to Continental.</p>
<p>But he, too, was in for a short tenure, apparently not
correcting Continental's lackluster performance quickly
enough to suit Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo, who brought
in another executive over Mr. Shugrue, prompting him to
resign in February 1989 after a year in the post.</p>
<p>Mr. Shugrue's appointment Wednesday isn't his first brush
with Eastern. A year ago, he was affiliated with the
investment group led by former baseball commissioner Peter V.
Ueberroth that negotiated to buy Eastern. The deal ultimately
collapsed, and Mr. Shugrue returned to his Houston-based
consulting business.</p>
