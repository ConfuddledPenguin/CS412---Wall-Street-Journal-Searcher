	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The House Budget Committee approved a
deficit-reduction plan that would cut military-spending
authority more and Medicare less than initially proposed by
the House leadership.
   The $1.2 trillion plan, approved on a 21-14 party-line
vote, is a direct challenge to President Bush. It would set
military-spending authority for the fiscal year beginning
Oct. 1 at $283 billion, $24 billion less than the president
requested. It also calls for fewer cuts in nonmilitary
programs than Mr. Bush wants and for a $13.9 billion tax
increase.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The panel's chairman, Rep. Leon Panetta of California, and
other members of the House Democratic leadership initially
had backed a plan that called for $286 billion in
military-spending authority. Liberals complained that the
figure was too high, and yesterday Mr. Panetta proposed the
lower figure, which was approved by the committee.</p>
<p>Though liberals seemed pleased by the change, conservative
Democrats were uneasy. As many as 40 conservative Democrats
could abandon the budget blueprint when it comes to the floor
in the coming weeks; such defections could jeopardize the
plan's prospects as few Republicans are expected to support
it.</p>
<p>In addition to the changes in military spending, the panel
altered the Democratic leadership's proposal so that it would
cut less from Medicare. At the request of Chairman Dan
Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) of the House Ways and Means
Committee, the Medicare cut was set at $1.7 billion, compared
with the leadership's $2.1 billion, aides said. The president
had proposed a $5.2 billion reduction.</p>
<p>What's more, the panel agreed to add $200 million in new
spending, bringing the total for new initiatives in the
budget blueprint to $6.2 billion. The extra money would go to
child-welfare programs, among other things. Where the extra
money would come from remained largely undefined.</p>
<p>Budget resolutions lay out a blueprint for spending and
tax legislation by other committees. The current one is
designed to reduce the deficit in fiscal 1991 to $64 billion
from the projected gap of $100.5 billion that would occur
without new legislation.</p>
<p>But more than half the $36 billion in the hoped-for
deficit reduction is contingent on yet-to-occur negotiations
with the president. The resolution doesn't require the
president's signature, but Democrats made clear it will
require his acquiescence if it is to be put into effect.</p>
<p>On tax increases, Rep. Rostenkowski is expected to refrain
from offering his own plan. That would bog down the
tax-writing process. The Ways and Means chairman is said to
be considering an attempt to send to the House floor
legislation that would increase the gasoline tax without his
committee's official recommendation.</p>
<p>The military-spending plan approved by the House panel
would provide for $295 billion in actual outlays during the
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, about $8 billion less than the
president requested.</p>
<p>In the Senate, meanwhile, Armed Services Committee
Chairman Sam Nunn (D., Ga.) announced that he also will push
for deeper cuts in military spending than the administration
has proposed for the next few years.</p>
<p>Breaking months of silence on specific defense-budget
numbers, Sen. Nunn urged removing 200,000 to 225,000 of the
more than 300,000 troops stationed in Europe by the
mid-1990s. Such cuts would be nearly three times larger than
advocated by the administration. Sen. Nunn also wants to save
money by keeping largely support units, rather than
heavy-tank forces and other front-line combat troops, in West
Germany.</p>
<p>Sen. Nunn singled out the Navy for trying to avoid deep
cuts by balking at mothballing aircraft carriers and turning
over other ships to the reserves. In light of budget
pressures and changes in EastWest relations, the Georgia
lawmaker said, the Navy should be able to operate with 10 or
12 carriers, compared with the current fleet of 14.</p>
<p>Describing the House Democratic defense number as lower
than he would like but still "within the range of
responsibility," Sen. Nunn said he will unveil his overall
Pentagon-spending blueprint in the next few days.</p>
