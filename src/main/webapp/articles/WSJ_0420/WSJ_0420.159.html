	<p class="article-leader">McDonald's Corp.'s reported a 12% increase in
first-quarter earnings, the 100th consecutive quarter in
which the fast-food chain's earnings and revenue have gone
up.
   McDonald's said it earned $158.1 million, or 43 cents a
share, compared with $141.7 million, or 38 cents, in the
year-earlier quarter. The 1989 per-share figure reflects a
2-for-1 split last May. Revenue rose 11%, to $1.53 billion
from $1.38 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the numbers seemed almost incidental to the streak.
Indeed, for more than a year, McDonald's has been noting that
its earnings gains were approaching the century mark.</p>
<p>Thus the actual feat called for something McSpecial.
Accordingly, after combing through 25 years of earnings for
corporate America, a McDonald's researcher happily reported
that "no other company in the current Standard & Poor's 500
has publicly reported results which equal this record."</p>
<p>McDonald's also said its stock is held by more investment
clubs in the National Association of Investors Corp. than any
other security.</p>
