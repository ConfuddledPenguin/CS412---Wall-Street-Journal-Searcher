	<p class="article-leader">Since the first Earth Day in 1970, there has been a lot of
good news on the environment. The deserts of the Sahel may
not be spreading after all. And Lake Erie is no longer dead;
its waters now team with tens of millions of walleye. But the
best environmental news of all is the opening of the Berlin
Wall and the democratization of Latin America.
   A very large proportion of the globe's environmental
problems are caused by policies that cannot stand the
scrutiny of either the marketplace or the voting booth.
Sweeping world trends -- political, economic, and
technological -- are fundamentally changing the globe's
environmental ground rules for the better.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Take Eastern Europe, the dirtiest, most degraded region on
Earth. Eighty percent of East Germany's rivers are
contaminated, and some of its citizens breathe air polluted
50 times above safe limits; two-thirds of Poland's trees are
damaged, two-thirds of its rivers too dirty even for
industry; 80% of Bulgaria's farmland is threatened by
erosion, 25% of its animal and plant species are threatened.
Throughout the Eastern Bloc life expectancy has been
dropping, with millions suffering from environmentally
induced disease. Some Eastern Europeans can expect to live a
decade less than Western Europeans.</p>
<p>Now all this is being swept away by democracy and economic
rationality. One of the first steps taken by the transitional
government in post-communist Czechoslovakia -- where posters
denouncing nuclear power vied for power with those denouncing
communist rule -- was the cancellation of a reactor under
construction. In East Germany the notoriously unsafe nuclear
reactor at Griefswald on the Baltic coast has been shut down
and, with West German help, East Germans are investing $250
million in advanced coal-burning technologies and in
incinerators for the disposal of chemical wastes. Poland is
cleaning up the Vistula River by building 188 large water
purification plants to treat municipal sewage and industrial
wastes and 200 smaller plants for highly toxic chemical
wastes.</p>
<p>In Latin America, too, the winds of change have toppled
one junta after another, replacing them with popularly
elected leaders who offer hope of meaningful reform --
environmental as well as economic. The slashing of the
Brazilian rainforests -- 50,000 square kilometers were being
cleared in 1989 -- was the consequence of economic approaches
remarkably similar to those of Eastern Europe. Central
planning authorities were recklessly promoting industrial
expansion, regardless of profitability, while property
rights, always a bulwark against unfettered central planning,
were undermined.</p>
<p>The first elected president to rule Brazil in 25 years,
Fernando Collor de Mello, has promised to drop many of the
policies that have simultaneously polluted his country and
mired it in debt. He is proposing a moratorium on new
incentives, subsidies and credits to businesses that cause a
negative environmental impact in any region, and taxes on
polluters and users of natural resources. Electricity rates
have been raised nearer to market levels and agricultural
sprawl -- blamed for forest clearings -- is being curbed by
the elimination of the tax breaks that helped to cause it in
the first place. As important, Mr. Collor is attempting to
settle property disputes with Brazil's native people; at the
request of Yanomami Indians, he is using force to evict from
the Indians' rainforest land some 45,000 prospectors.</p>
<p>Entrenched interests in both Eastern Europe and Latin
America -- powerful bureaucracies in the former, military and
land-owning aristocracy in the latter -- are likely to delay
and perhaps halt the tempo of reform. But technological
change is on the side of ecological progress.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, a Third World community faced with the
flooding of its farmland by a state hydroelectric project or
the removal of its forests for subsidized pulp production was
all but helpless. Generally it was given no say in the
decision, let alone compensation for the loss of its
property, and Westerners would learn of the project too late
to intervene, even though the project was typically built by
Western engineers using Western tax dollars.</p>
<p>Today, that community is as likely as not to have a fax
machine or to be able to reach local environmentalists who --
via fax, phone or electronic mail -- can reach a global
network of environmental, human rights and native rights
activists. Within days, the project's developers can be
identified, environmentalists in the country involved can be
enlisted and an international campaign mounted. Though most
projects nevertheless proceed to completion, through this
process literally dozens of ill-conceived projects are being
stopped, and hundreds more slowed or improved. As the ease of
communication rises and as information flows improve through
increased trade and travel, the rejection rate for bad
projects can only increase.</p>
<p>The good news isn't universal: In regions such as Africa,
where political and economic reforms have been slow to
materialize, and where communication technologies tend to be
strictly controlled (Kenyans, for example, need government
permission to use a computer modem), environmentalists must
often work in secret, and suffer debilitating intimidation
much as their counterparts in Latin America did under
military rule.</p>
<p>But in Chile and Argentina once-muzzled environmental
critics of government policy now find themselves in positions
of power. In Brazil, Jose Lutzemberger, one of the world's
most outspoken defenders of the rainforest and the founder of
the first environmental group to challenge the generals,
Agapan, now finds himself secretary of the environment. With
information he gets from daily satellite surveys, he claims
that "no destruction of the environment can happen in this
county, even pollution . . . that can be hidden." He is
hopeful that this access to information will further "a
capitalist perestroika," that revamps the tax system,
eliminating destructive subsidies, removing power from big
landowners and protecting the rights of the inhabitants of
the last wilderness.</p>
<p>Nor is capitalist perestroika confined to the Third World.
The drying up of state subsidies to the petroleum industry
has rid North America of most new tar sands, oil shale,
frontier and other environmentally harmful and economically
wasteful energy megaprojects. In Britain, privatization
pulled the plug on nuclear power expansion by forcing
investors to see nuclear power and all its latent liabilities
from an owner's point of view.</p>
<p>The U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement is likely to hasten
the adoption of higher U.S. environmental standards in
Canada, just as the European Community has leaned on member
states to raise their water standards up to the levels of the
cleaner members. Strong freedom-of-information laws -- the
one reform environmentalists around the world agree on --
hinder cover-ups, and provide the public with knowledge and
resolve.</p>
<p>World-wide, power has shifted away from the remote elites
of the national and international bureaucracies, whose
understanding of local economies and environments is
necessarily limited. The Sahel exemplifies that limited
understanding: At an international conference in 1977, the
Nairobi-based United Nations Environment Program pronounced
-- on the scantiest of information -- that the Saharan desert
was advancing an average of six kilometers a year, and
pointed fingers at peasant practices that supposedly degraded
the land. As satellite studies and ground surveys from the
World Conservation Union now show, the emergency that the UN
and other outsiders saw was a mirage.</p>
<p>The costly emergency measures they championed -- chiefly a
green Maginot Line to defend against desert creep -- were
unwarranted and sometimes counterproductive. Despite droughts
and rapid population growth, the land of the Sahel has become
increasingly bountiful over the years. The people are coping
admirably, despite perverse government policies that, for
instance, discouraged tree planting by expropriating local
lands.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the methods that have helped the
peasants of the Sahel and their environment survive these
past few thousand years continue to have merit. If people
throughout the globe are to do better for themselves and
their environment, as is usually their desire, the answer
will be in more, not less freedom for their communities.</p>
