	<p class="article-leader">Two major banking companies, Bankers Trust New York Corp.
and BankAmerica Corp., bucked the general industry trend and
reported improving credit quality.
   Bankers Trust posted its second-best quarter as earnings
rose 21% because of strong trading gains and a drop in
nonperforming loans to highly leveraged transactions.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>BankAmerica, the San Francisco-based parent of the
nation's third-largest bank, posted a slight earnings
increase as problem loans dropped from year-earlier levels.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, First Fidelity Bancorp, Lawrenceville, N.J.,
reported a 68% decline in earnings as it continued to grapple
with its loan problems.</p>
<p>And PNC Financial Corp., Pittsburgh, posted a 40% drop in
first-quarter profit, reflecting continued problems in
commercial real estate, particularly in the Northeast.</p>
<p>Bankers Trust</p>
<p>A rising U.S. dollar and bond market during the quarter
enabled Bankers Trust to report trading gains of $151 million
on government bonds, a 29% increase over a year ago, and $121
million on currency trading, more than a twofold increase
from last year.</p>
<p>The trading gains, which the bank said stemmed chiefly
from trading for clients' accounts, were needed to offset a
sharp drop in corporate finance fees to about $70 million,
roughly the same as in the last year's fourth quarter; the
bank declined to provide the comparable figure for last
year's first quarter. The lull in corporate restructurings
has been caused by last fall's collapse of the high-yield, or
junk, bond market.</p>
<p>The trading gains were especially encouraging in light of
recent and pending personnel departures. In January, Allen D.
Wheat, head of derivative securities in London, and more than
a dozen of his employees resigned to join CS-First Boston.</p>
<p>Mr. Wheat was instrumental in developing Bankers Trust's
successful offering of puts on the Tokyo stock market, and
some analysts lowered their estimates of Bankers Trust's
earnings when he left.</p>
<p>In addition, this summer Jay L. Pomrenze, Bankers Trust's
head of foreign exchange trading, is scheduled to take a
one-year leave of absence to study religion in Israel.</p>
<p>Bankers Trust also reported that the credit quality of its
highly leveraged transaction portfolio improved sharply
during the quarter. Nonperforming loans on such transactions,
typically leveraged buy-outs, declined since Dec. 31 by 32%,
or $101 million, to $211 million. Net charge-offs of
highly-leveraged loans totaled $24 million. Though the bank
declined to comment, it is believed that Bankers Trust took
additional charge-offs during the period for its remaining
equity and subordinated debt in the ill-fated management
buy-out of Magnet PLC, a U.K. company.</p>
<p>The quarterly provision for credit losses was $40 million,
offsetting total charge-offs for the period of $39 million.</p>
<p>Net interest income totaled $227 million, a 4.6% drop from
a year ago.</p>
<p>In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, the stock fell 87.5 cents to close at $35.75.</p>
<p>BankAmerica</p>
<p>BankAmerica said first-quarter net income grew slightly to
$278 million, or $1.23 a share, a robust 1.1% return on total
assets, on an annualized basis, despite the absence of
interest payments by Brazil, a major debtor.</p>
<p>In the year-earlier period, the bank holding company
earned $275 million, or $1.38 a share, including $46 million
in Brazilian interest payments. Excluding the year-ago
Brazilian payment, BankAmerica's net climbed by 17%.</p>
<p>The steep drop in 1990 first-quarter pershare income
reflects BankAmerica's efforts to rebuild capital by selling
additional shares to its holders. The number of shares
outstanding in the quarter grew 12% from a year ago, the
company said.</p>
<p>Despite its performance, BankAmerica's stock continues to
erode from a high of $36.37 posted in September 1989. In
composite Big Board trading, BankAmerica's shares closed at
$27.50, down 37.5 cents.</p>
<p>Analysts said that despite the decline, BankAmerica stock
has generally outperformed other Top 50 banks during a period
when banking stocks have experienced a widespread downturn.
The banking industry has been battered by lackluster
earnings, a string of unanticipated write-downs on
nonperforming assets and growing loan problems resulting from
regionwide real estate slumps.</p>
<p>"The biggest banks in the country are only doing so-so,"
said J. Richard Fredericks, a banking analyst for Montgomery
Securities in San Francisco, saying BankAmerica's shares, on
a year-to-date basis, have improved slightly.</p>
<p>Analysts called BankAmerica's first-quarter results solid
and slightly better than anticipated. The company used a 16%
increase in non-interest income, amounting to $521 million
for the quarter, and a $60 million extraordinary tax credit
to help offset increases in reserves for its third world
debt, and for losses anticipated from a student loan program.
Reserves for Third World loans increased by $137 million, or
54%, while the company added another $28 million in reserves
to cover problem student loans.</p>
<p>BankAmerica's residential mortgage loans continued to
grow, rising 31% in the quarter, while its consumer loans
increased a brisk 28% in the same period. The growth helped
push up BankAmerica's average assets by $5.9 billion from a
year ago. On the negative side, the company's nonaccrual
assets remain stubbornly high, and increased slightly in the
quarter to more than $4 billion.</p>
<p>BankAmerica's performance over the past year has been
among the more remarkable turnarounds in the banking
industry. It has boosted its equity and total capital to one
of the strongest levels among big banks -- perhaps
positioning the company as a possible bidder for troubled
First Interstate Bancorp., which has been battered by real
estate troubles in Texas and Arizona.</p>
<p>As customary, BankAmerica declined to say whether it has
an interest in First Interstate, though officials at a news
briefing said the company clearly is interested in
acquisitions. As reported, BankAmerica plans to greatly
increase its allowable number of shares outstanding, a move
that would give it a potent weapon in an offer for its
downstate rival.</p>
<p>First Fidelity</p>
<p>Securities analysts didn't attach much significance to the
sharp decline in First Fidelity's first-quarter results.
Instead, they are awaiting the completion of an examination
by the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency during the second
quarter before concluding the extent of New Jersey's biggest
commercial bank's problems.</p>
<p>In Big Board trading, the stock closed at $18.625,
unchanged.</p>
<p>James Rosenberg, a Shearson Lehman Hutton analyst, said
that newly named Chairman Anthony Terracciano "is going to
clean the deck in the second quarter. The only question is
how strong a detergent will he use."</p>
<p>The quarter's results were depressed by a $47.4 million
increase in the loan-loss provision to $65 million and a $23
million charge for staff reductions. Net charge-offs totaled
$40.9 million, about the same as a year ago. Nonperforming
assets rose 19% to $604.4 million from $507.3 million in the
fourth quarter.</p>
<p>At March 31, the reserve for loan losses stood at $413
million, or 2.1% of total loans, compared with $388.8
million, or 1.98%, at year's end.</p>
<p>Analysts were encouraged by two shifts: Expense growth
halted, and net interest income rose 1.8% to $272.8 million.
Non-interest income rose 13% to $84.9 million, largely
because of $9.4 million in venture capital gains and higher
service charges. First fidelity's net interest margin, or the
difference between what it pays and earns on money, also
widened to 4% from 3.95% at year's end.</p>
<p>PNC</p>
<p>PNC's earnings fall-off was expected. But analysts were
surprised at a sizable increase in nonperforming assets,
which increased to $831.6 million from $581.3 million at
year's end.</p>
<p>"That's higher than what I was looking for, and that's a
disappointment following their fourth quarter," said analyst
Dennis F. Shea of Morgan Stanley & Co. In the fourth quarter
of fiscal 1989, PNC added $180 million to its provisions for
bad Third World debt and domestic real estate loans.</p>
<p>Even though PNC had warned shareholders two weeks ago that
it expected earnings to fall by as much as 40%, common shares
slid $1.25 to close at $34.375 on the Big Board.</p>
<p>PNC bolstered its provisions for loan-losses to $108.9
million from the year-ago $36.4 million. The move followed a
federal review of a PNC affilate, Cincinnati-based
Bancorporation, which resulted in an increase in that unit's
nonperforming assets.</p>
<p>With examiners using tougher lending criteria, PNC said it
took the large loan-loss provision to cover itself in case
future reviews of affiliates result in similar increases in
nonperforming assets.</p>
<p>In a statement, Thomas H. O'Brien, PNC's chairman and
chief executive officer, said, "PNC has historically
maintained a conservative reserve position. We will continue
to monitor the level of our reserves and take whatever action
is necessary to ensure that our reserves remain at
appropriate levels."</p>
