	<p class="article-leader">If the ordinary Swissies knew about him they'd inform
against him too . . . it's a national sport.
   -- "A Perfect Spy," by John le Carre</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>BERN, Switzerland -- The secretive Swiss are having
trouble with snooping. And this time it isn't with foreign
governments trying to pry open numbered bank accounts. It's
the Swiss spying on each other.</p>
<p>This little-known Swiss pastime, which Mr. le Carre
discovered during his student days at Bern University, has
surfaced to become one of the liveliest scandals in recent
Swiss history.</p>
<p>It all began in November with a government-published
paperback book entitled "PUK," which stands for Parliamentary
Investigation Commission. Now a bestseller, "PUK" documents
the discoveries of federal legislators delegated to
investigate the Swiss Justice Department under Elisabeth
Kopp, former justice minister. Ms. Kopp resigned her post in
January 1989 after admitting that she informed her husband he
was on the board of a company tied to a money-laundering
probe.</p>
<p>The 228-page "PUK" diligently examines the workings of the
ministry, outlining a largely expected chain of events. But
between pages 154 and 190 was a bombshell: The federal police
for decades had kept extensive files on ordinary citizens.</p>
<p>About 900,000 files were discovered by the investigating
legislators, who often found themselves looking at their own
dossiers. Two-thirds of the files referred to foreigners, but
the Swiss weren't concerned about those. It was the 300,000
files on Swiss citizens and organizations that stirred the
emotions.</p>
<p>Fed by village policemen, fellow workers or neighbors, the
archives brought into focus a rare picture of the universal
interest of national-security watchdogs. A liberal
politician's visit to a film on Chinese pandas was recorded.
A youth-organization employee discovered that her switch from
a yellow to a red Renault was of significance. A middle-aged
Social Democratic member of parliament was on a secret list
since the age of 17. One lady landed in the police files
after signing a petition against genetic engineering.
Opponents of nuclear energy seemed sure game for a mention if
they signed a petition.</p>
<p>The country of 6.4 million was chagrined. The report
suggested that a national-security organization was needed to
combat foreign espionage and terrorism. But here were
"trivial details" of no importance for national security.</p>
<p>What's more, once a person got into the system, he never
seemed to get out. Some of the files were on people long
since dead. A respected trade unionist found his file with a
notation dating from his youth. Someone wrote that the
then-teen had nice parents but was himself somewhat wild.</p>
<p>The investigating members of parliament said: "The
gathering of useless material is to be stopped." They called
for the files to be purged and for measures to be instituted
to protect civil liberties.</p>
<p>An embarrassed Swiss government apologized for the "hurt"
done to citizens by the files; people were asked to write to
Bern to request a look at their dossiers. A lot have,
including Social Democrat Rudolf H. Strahm, a first
lieutenant in the country's militia army. His file was a bit
of a shock. It read: "Registered on the list of suspect
officers, according to the military security service."</p>
<p>Mr. Strahm promptly went to the press and dropped another
bombshell, this time on the military. The Swiss Defense
Department had denied the existence of a list of suspicious
military men. Now it had to admit to keeping a register of
left-leaning officers.</p>
<p>From then on, secret files came out of the woodwork with
regularity, including a discontinued list of "extremists," a
forgotten list of those to be interned in case of war, an old
list of suspicious government officials, and over 100,000
secret photos.</p>
<p>Revelations of a secret army took over the headlines for a
while, to the despair of the defense minister. Apparently in
the 1970s, resistance fighters -- local citizens, trained on
weekends in secret locations -- were ready in case of an
invasion of Switzerland.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Swiss government officials seem to be getting
weary of apologizing to citizens. Of the Bachmann affair,
Defense Minister Kaspar Villiger grumbled: "I really do have
problems understanding this furor over so-called revelations
that are more than 10 years old."</p>
<p>Now parliament has approved another investigation, PUK 2,
which will look into the doings of the Defense Department;
the investigation is limited to intelligence gathering only.
Mr. Villiger has warned that foreign secret services are
getting nervous about Switzerland's recent burst of openness.
However, despite the fact that citizens are given access to
their files, the identification of informants continues to be
kept secret.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, up to 7,000 requests a day are pouring into the
Justice Department as citizens seek to look into their files.
Leading writers, artists and musicians have said that they
will boycott Switzerland's celebration of its 700-year
anniversary in 1991 unless the "political police" are
abolished. A group against "snooper state Switzerland" will
start gathering signatures to force a referendum to abolish
the domestic security police.</p>
<p>Not everyone is outraged. "The problem with Switzerland is
that everything goes so well -- no unemployment or real
problems," said Hans Ulrich Doerig, an executive board member
of bank Credit Suisse. "If it were otherwise, Switzerland
wouldn't be making such a big deal out of this."</p>
<p>While conceding that changes are needed, some legislators
have warned against drastic action. "It is irresponsible, in
light of organized crime, drug trafficking and other evils,
to talk about dismantling our national security," insisted
Eva Segmueller, president of the Christian Democratic Party.</p>
<p>Historians point out that Switzerland has had active
national security police for a century. "The federal police
and prosecutor's office are exactly 100 years old and for
nearly 100 years they have used the same methods," said Erich
Gruner, a leading Swiss political scientist.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Prof. Gruner thinks changes are needed. "Up
till now the police brain has believed that anyone who
diverts from the Swiss norm is a potential enemy of the
state," he said.</p>
<p>Since the 1950s, Switzerland has been governed by a
coalition of leading parties represented in a seven-member
federal council. Known as the "magic formula," the
arrangement is largely responsible for the country's
stability.</p>
<p>But in the wake of the snooper scandal, there are
questions over whether this coalition system needs change.
Social Democrat Thomas Onken said recently in a speech in
parliament: "We lack the culture of opposition, the bite." He
pointed out that the federal council has known of the secret
files, if not their extent, through quarterly reports from
the public prosecutor's office. He accused parliament of
showing "too little curiosity" about what was going on in its
secret service.</p>
<p>Urs Altermatt, a prominent historian, is calling for a
major change. "We must rethink our situation," he said. "My
feeling is that we must go to a system where there is a
political opposition. Then people will have a real choice
when they vote."</p>
