	<p class="article-leader">The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll was based on
nationwide telephone interviews of 1,001 registered voters
conducted April 11, 12, 14 and 16 by the polling
organizations of Peter Hart and Robert Teeter.
   The sample was drawn from 260 randomly selected geographic
points in the continental U.S. Each region was represented in
proportion to its population. Households were picked by a
method that gave all phone numbers, listed and unlisted, an
equal chance of being included. One registered voter, 18 or
older, was selected from each household by a procedure to
provide the correct number of male and female respondents.
The results of the survey were minimally weighted by income
and race to assure that the poll accurately reflects
registered voters nationwide.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Chances are 19 of 20 that if all registered voters in the
U.S. had been surveyed using the same questionnaire, the
findings would differ from these poll results by no more than
3.2 percentage points in either direction. The margin of
error for subgroups would be larger.</p>
