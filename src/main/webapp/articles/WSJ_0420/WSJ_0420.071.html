	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- Aluminum Co. of America said it collected
17.1 billion used aluminum beverage cans for recycling last
year, or about 68 cans for each American.
   Can collectors were paid $232 million by returning the
cans, which weighed 611 million pounds, to Alcoa's 2,400
recycling centers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The collected cans are remelted, rolled into new aluminum
can sheet and sold to can makers, Alcoa said.</p>
<p>An estimated 10 million people in the U.S. recycle
aluminum cans regularly, the company said.</p>
<p>Overall, Alcoa said 49 billion beverage cans last year
were recycled in the U.S., or 61% of the 80 billion aluminum
beverage cans that were produced. This is a record increase
from 1988, when 55% of 78 billion aluminum cans were
recycled, the company said.</p>
