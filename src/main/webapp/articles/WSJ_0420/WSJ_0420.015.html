	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Consumer Product Safety Commission
announced the recall of more than 600,000 beanbag cushions
linked to the suffocation deaths of 19 babies.
   J.C. Penney Co. of Dallas, as well as several of the
products' manufacturers, voluntarily recalled the pillows,
which are used to support resting or sleeping infants. The
major manufacturers involved in the recall are Hollander Home
Fashions, Newark, N.J., which made 467,000 cushions; and Gold
Inc. of Denver, which made 110,000 pillows. Seven small
companies also are participating in the recall.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>CPSC officials said the agency may take legal action
against one manufacturer who hasn't agreed to a recall, but
officials didn't identify the company. J.C. Penney and the
Army Air Force Exchange Service, which supplies military
bases, sold the Gold Inc. product.</p>
<p>Commission officials said the 19 infants, three months of
age or younger, died after being left to sleep face down on
the cushions. Ten of the deaths occurred last year. The
fabric-covered pillows, which are filled with polystyrene
pellets, can conform to a baby's face. Suffocation occurs
because newborn infants can't roll over. Early last month,
the CPSC issued an urgent warning about the suffocation risk
associated with the product. By mid-March, all manufacturers
of the cushions had stopped production, the CPSC said.</p>
<p>Hollander's product was sold under the brand name Mothers
Helper, and the Gold Inc. cushion was known as the Gold Bug
Support Sack. J.C. Penney sold 4,700 of the Gold Inc.
cushions under the names Disney Babies Toddletime Support
Sack, Sleepy Time Bears Support Sack and Sesame Street
Support Sack.</p>
