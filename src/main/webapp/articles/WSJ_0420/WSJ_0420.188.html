	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Texas Instruments Inc. narrowly avoided the
first-quarter loss it had warned of in January, but only
because it sold a majority interest in one of its operations.
   The electronics and semiconductor maker reported net
income of $13 million, or five cents a share, down 85% from
year-earlier net of $84.6 million, or 90 cents a share. The
earnings included a pretax gain of approximately $15 million
from the sale of a majority interest in the company's
photomask operation. The company's operating loss for the
quarter was $2 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Revenue declined 3.8% to $1.54 billion from $1.59 billion.
Company officials blamed a weak semiconductor market.</p>
<p>And while Jerry R. Junkins, chairman, president and chief
executive officer, said March semiconductor orders were at
their highest level in more than a year, prices are still
soft. "We expect the second quarter to be about as difficult
as the first," he said.</p>
<p>Despite the gloomy short-term outlook, Mr. Junkins told
shareholders at the annual meeting that semiconductor demand
will grow throughout this year and approach double-digit
levels by the fourth quarter. In the long term, he said, the
world semiconductor market will grow from $50 billion this
year to about $200 billion by 2000.</p>
<p>Texas Instruments also was hurt by the decline in defense
spending, recording a 66% drop in defense orders for the
first quarter and projecting annual revenue growth of no more
than 2% for the next decade. The defense group has been Texas
Instruments' second-largest revenue generator, last year
contributing $2.1 billion of the company's $6.5 billion in
revenue.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Texas Instruments shares closed at $35.50, down 87.5 cents.</p>
