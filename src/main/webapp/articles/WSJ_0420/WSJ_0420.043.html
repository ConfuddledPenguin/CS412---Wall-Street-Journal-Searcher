	<p class="article-leader">BEIJING -- Nearly four million people were laid off in
China last year, pushing the urban unemployment rate to 2.6%
from 2% at the end of 1988, the English-language China Daily
quoted an unidentified Labor Ministry official as saying.
   The official said 10 million urban residents will be
seeking work this year, including 3.78 million people laid
off last year, as China's economy stalled, and three million
young people entering the job market. Some Chinese economists
have put urban unemployment at 4%. The government has said
2.9 million people were jobless last July 31.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A government austerity program aimed at cutting inflation
has caused thousands of money-pinched factories to close and
forced the suspension of thousands of labor-intensive
construction projects.</p>
<p>As many as 30 million of the nation's some 140 million
urban workers are underemployed, meaning they have little or
nothing to do on their jobs. The government, to avoid labor
unrest, has told state-run enterprises to keep workers on the
payroll even when there is no work.</p>
