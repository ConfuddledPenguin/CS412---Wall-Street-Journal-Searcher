	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- The public sector borrowing requirement, the
most widely used measure of Britain's government deficit or
surplus, showed a deficit of #1.63 billion ($2.67 billion) in
March compared with a surplus of #1.04 billion in February
and a deficit of #2.25 billion in March 1989, the U.K.
Treasury said.
   The March deficit brought the surplus for the year ended
March 31 down to #8 billion, compared with a surplus of #14.5
billion in the previous fiscal year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The government had initially projected a #14 billion
surplus for the latest year, but scaled this forecast back to
#7 billion in March.</p>
