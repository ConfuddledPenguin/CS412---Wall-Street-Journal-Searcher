	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Despite the pall over the Tokyo stock market,
there is no pressing need for Japanese banks to reduce assets
to meet international capital-adequacy requirements, a
Finance Ministry official said.
   "I don't see much need for banks to sell their assets,"
the regulator, a senior official in the ministry's banking
bureau, said in an interview. Banks "haven't seriously
thought about selling," he said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>However, if the stock market remains depressed for an
extended period, then "there may be problems . . . in one or
two years," the official said.</p>
<p>In addition, the banks may be more likely to preserve
domestic assets than those overseas.</p>
<p>Starting in 1992, the Bank for International Settlements
will require banks in member countries, which include Japan,
to maintain capital equal to 8% of their assets. By March 31,
1991, Japanese banks must be maintaining capital equal to
7.25% of assets.</p>
<p>While the local stock market was booming, Japanese banks
were counting heavily on issuing shares and equity-linked
debt to finance their necessary increase in capital. With the
Nikkei stock average down 27% since hitting its high at the
end of last year, though, the well of easy cash has dried up.</p>
<p>There is growing speculation that, as capital grows
tighter, banks now will have to curtail lending and sell
securities and other assets to meet BIS requirements.
However, the Finance Ministry official said that the flow of
capital into banks should be sufficient to allow them to
maintain their current portfolios.</p>
<p>Likewise, an official of Moody's Investor Service Inc.
here said he believes that capital pressures on Japanese
banks aren't urgent. "I still think that there is an ability
to sell equity here," said Roger B. Arner, executive vice
president of Moody's in Japan.</p>
<p>Mr. Arner said that "over the near-term, there is no great
concern." Instead, shrinking earnings and market share will
be much bigger problems for Japanese banks, he said. Moody's,
however, is confident about the prospects for Japanese banks
in general, despite these concerns.</p>
<p>According to the Japanese Finance Ministry official,
capital gains and new financing avenues likely to be approved
by the ministry will help Japanese banks meet BIS
requirements.</p>
<p>However, there may be a twist that won't be comforting to
overseas securities markets. Most of the gains for Japanese
banks probably lie abroad, according to analysts.</p>
<p>With the recent sharp decline in the prices of such widely
held domestic assets as stocks and Japanese government bonds,
Japanese banks have been looking to get capital gains from
European equities, some European debt issues, and
dollar-denominated assets such as U.S. Treasury securities,
analysts said.</p>
<p>Since the turmoil in the Japanese financial markets
started upsetting balance sheets at the start of the year,
Japanese banks have been taking profits on their holdings of
Treasury securities, according to market participants. And
the dollar's appreciation has swelled the profits in terms of
yen. The dollar has risen from 143.40 yen at the end of last
year to 159.45 yen currently, or 11%.</p>
<p>Help for Japanese banks is also on the horizon from
Japanese regulators, the Finance Ministry official said. In
the near future, "the ministry is likely to approve
subordinated loans to banks" and banks are likely sometime
after that to be allowed to issue subordinated debentures, he
said.</p>
