	<p class="article-leader">MIAMI -- Knight-Ridder Inc. reported that first-quarter
net income climbed 26% to $25.8 million from $20.5 million a
year ago, due in part to lower newsprint and interest costs.
   The giant media concern said per-share profit rose 28% in
the latest quarter to 50 cents from 39 cents, based on 51.8
million shares outstanding in the latest quarter compared
with 52.6 million a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Knight-Ridder said revenue rose 2.6% to $554.7 million
from $540.7 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>The company said reduced losses in its Detroit newspaper
operations and good performance in its Business Information
Services Division, particularly its MoneyCenter and Dialog
products, contributed to the improved results.</p>
<p>It said interest costs in the quarter fell to $14.1
million from $23 million a year earlier, as a result of the
pay-down of debt with funds from the 1989 sale of eight
television stations and its Pasadena newspaper.</p>
<p>In a statement, Robert F. Singleton, senior vice president
and chief financial officer, said, "Looking ahead,
Knight-Ridder is well positioned to continue to absorb a soft
advertising environment and should produce among the best
earnings-per-share gains in our industry this year." He added
that "barring some unforeseen financial setback, 1990 will be
Knight-Ridder's 15th consecutive year of growth in earnings
per share from continuing operations."</p>
