	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Development of a new drug takes an average
of 12 years and costs $231 million, according to the Center
for the Study of Drug Development, an industry-funded
research group affiliated with Tufts University.
   "Costs have more than doubled" from those found in a
similar study done by the center a decade ago, said Joseph
DiMasi, a research associate.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. DiMasi at a news conference attributed the rise in
costs to the use of more patients in clinical trials,
increasingly complex testing and growing interest in
developing treatments for "chronic and degenerative diseases"
like cancer and Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Sidney Wolfe, director of the Public Citizen Health
Research Group, questioned the validity of the center's
findings because they include the cost of developing
ineffective drugs that never come to market.</p>
<p>Despite the increasing difficulty of drug research and
development, Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association
President Gerald Mossingraff said, "new drug development is
proceeding at a healthy pace." He said the group's latest
survey found that 104 drug products were in human tests or
awaiting review at the Food and Drug Administration, a 30%
increase over last year.</p>
<p>An unreleased study by Henry Grabowski, an economist at
Duke University, found only 30% of all new drugs earn back
their research-and-development costs. Mr. Grabowski said the
return on all drug research and development is 9%, after
inflation.</p>
