	<p class="article-leader">STOCKHOLM -- Esselte AB signed a six-year pact with Walt
Disney Co. that gives the Swedish concern's FilmNet satellite
TV channel exclusive pay-TV rights to Disney feature films in
Scandinavia and the Benelux countries.
   Hal Richardson, a Disney senior vice president, said the
move "is part of a strategy to concentrate more on TV in
raising the Disney image around Europe" ahead of the planned
1992 opening of the Euro-Disneyland theme park outside Paris.
Terms of the agreement weren't disclosed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The agreement follows Esselte's decision last month to
sell the FilmNet unit as part of a sweeping corporate
restructuring. With 430,000 subscribers to its 24-hour
service in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Belgium and
Holland, FilmNet claims to be Europe's biggest satellite
distributed pay-TV service.</p>
<p>FilmNet has struggled with mounting competition in recent
years, running up hefty losses that finally triggered
Esselte's retreat from the entertainment sector. Martin
Lindskog, president of Esselte's entertainment division, said
he was convinced the link with Disney "makes FilmNet more
attractive to prospective buyers."</p>
<p>The planned FilmNet auction is being conducted by U.S.
investment bank Wasserstein Perella & Co. Though preparations
are still at an early stage, Mr. Lindskog said Esselte has
been approached by about 15 prospective suitors, 10 of which
he described as serious. He declined to identify any of the
companies.</p>
<p>Mr. Lindskog expects the auction to formally commence next
month and be completed during the autumn. Industry analysts
estimate FilmNet could fetch as much as 2 billion Swedish
kronor ($329 million).</p>
