	<p class="article-leader">TACOMA, Wash. -- Weyerhaeuser Co. said first-quarter
profit slumped 12% due to depressed prices for most pulp and
paper products. The forest products concern reported net
income of $130.1 million, or 61 cents a share, compared with
a profit of $148.1 million, or 70 cents a share, a year
earlier. Revenue for the quarter ended April 1 declined 2% to
$2.28 billion from $2.32 billion.</p>
