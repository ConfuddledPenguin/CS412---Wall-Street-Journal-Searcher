	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission, in a
move that could transform the way companies raise capital,
approved rules making it easier to sell and trade
private-placement securities.
   The private-placement market is a rapidly growing
financing arena in which companies forgo many of the
registration requirements of public offerings and sell chunks
of stock or debt directly to insurance companies and other
institutional investors. The market is estimated at $170
billion, and about 35% of all corporate financings last year
were private placements.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But buyers of those private securities couldn't easily
resell them under earlier SEC rules, reducing the liquidity
of the investments and in turn sending many U.S. companies
overseas looking for investors. Moreover, foreign issuers
couldn't easily enter the U.S. market without disclosing more
than they were required to in their home countries.</p>
<p>The SEC yesterday moved to ease those requirements,
unanimously passing Rule 144a, which commission officials
suggest could open the floodgates to companies seeking to use
the non-public markets. The rule "will enhance the
competitiveness and efficiency of our domestic markets," SEC
Chairman Richard Breeden said. "The result should be a lower
cost of capital."</p>
<p>The rule would create a "144a market" that would in effect
allow large players to trade among themselves without going
back to the registration and disclosure process. But it will
be closed to all but the biggest investors. Only institutions
that own $100 million or more in securities, estimated to be
thousands of investment houses and corporations, can buy
private placements under the rule.</p>
<p>In addition, the commission tacked on two new wrinkles to
the proposed rule. Banks and thrifts are forced to leap
another hurdle to play in the market: They must have net
worth of at least $25 million. SEC member Mary Schapiro said
that about 50 savings-and-loans that met the standard $100
million threshold wouldn't qualify under the new guideline.</p>
<p>But the rules were relaxed for brokerage houses, which
will be able to participate if they own $10 million in
securities.</p>
<p>To help investment in the products, the SEC is loosening
the rules governing mutual fund investments. Mutual funds
generally can't invest more than 10% of their assets in
so-called restricted, or illiquid, securities such as private
placements. But the SEC said it will allow the funds'
directors to determine whether 144a investments are liquid.
The agency said that more than 1,000 mutual funds will meet
the eligibility standards for the market.</p>
<p>In tandem with Rule 144a, the SEC also approved
establishment of a trading system called Portal, which was
created by the National Association of Securities Dealers.
Portal will act as an electronic bulletin board to facilitate
the trading of large blocks of debt and stock in the 144a
market.</p>
<p>The electronic board also has the potential to be adapted
into a trading and pricing system for bonds, Chairman Breeden
said. He asked agency staffers to push the NASD to consider
such a system, especially for the high-yield "junk" bond
market, where price and trading information is often
difficult to find.</p>
<p>Mr. Breeden also said at the meeting that the agency will
be examining shelf-registration rules to see what changes are
needed to foster capital creation by companies. Shelf
registrations allow companies to register once for a series
of financings.</p>
<p>The first entrants into the 144a market are expected to be
foreign companies looking to raise money in the U.S. Many
foreign issuers have shied away from the U.S. markets because
of the tougher disclosure rules designed to protect
individual investors.</p>
<p>By allowing only "sophisticated" large institutions to
play in the market, the SEC felt it didn't need to offer much
protection to the pension funds, mutual funds, insurers,
charitable organizations and others that already have $100
million in securities.</p>
<p>Stocks or bonds that are traded on any public exchange
won't be allowed in the 144a market, a restriction designed
to keep private securities from spilling over into the public
markets and vice versa.</p>
<p>Under the new guidelines, U.S. or foreign companies
already registered with the SEC for any kind of security
won't have to disclose anything more. U.S. companies that
haven't registered will have to make financial information
available to holders on request.</p>
<p>Foreign companies that haven't made a U.S. public offering
in the past but have done so in their own countries need only
provide the same information that they would in their own
countries. If they haven't made an offering in the U.S. or at
home, they will need to make information available according
to the same rules as U.S. companies that haven't registered
in the U.S.</p>
<p>Not everybody is enthusiastic about the rule change. In a
sharply worded letter to Mr. Breeden, Reps. John Dingell (D.,
Mich.) and Edward Markey (D., Mass.) questioned the legality
of the SEC to move in the area. "We are concerned that Rule
144a may be . . . beyond the scope of the powers of the
commission," they wrote.</p>
<p>Moreover, Rep. Dingell, the head of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, and Rep. Markey, who runs the panel's
finance subcommittee, expressed concern about "the
development of a two-tiered market for U.S. investors, one
public and one private."</p>
<p>The two lawmakers said they were concerned about "the
diminished availability of many quality investments to
smaller investors" and that bad investments could be passed
on to individual investors through mutual funds and pension
funds.</p>
<p>And in an unusually prickly request, Reps. Dingell and
Markey asked the SEC to report to the committee every six
months on a 13-part set of questions about the 144a market.</p>
