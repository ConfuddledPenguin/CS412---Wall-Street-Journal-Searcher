	<h3>Vienna Stocks May Be Out of Step After Their Wild Waltz Upward</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">VIENNA -- The tiny Austrian stock market is zooming ahead
so fast that investors are starting to wonder if it's about
to ski off a cliff.
   The Vienna Stock Exchange index roared ahead 111% in 1989,
far outpacing major stock markets. So far this year it has
climbed 37%, as investors envision great benefits for Austria
from the political upheaval in Eastern Europe.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Not only do the Austrians expect a reopening of historic
trading ties with Hungary and Czechoslovakia, they also look
for German reunification to boost demand for Austrian goods.
(West Germany already accounts for 35% of Austria's exports.)</p>
<p>The political glow has boosted Austrian stocks to levels
that investors are starting to view as precarious. Austrian
stocks were down 2% yesterday.</p>
<p>"We are very cautious about new investments in Austria,"
says Robert Hoyos, director of funds management for Erste
Allgemeine, Austria's largest insurance company. "Stocks are
very highly valued -- one might say overvalued."</p>
<p>Any major disappointment about East European prospects
could "halve the value" of the Vienna market, the executive
warns. Three factors have bolstered Austria's market.
Austria's economy is small but healthy. Last year's stock
price run-up was fueled by optimism linked to the European
Community's 1992 economic union; Austria has applied for
membership to the EC, and is generally expected to be
admitted by the mid-1990s.</p>
<p>But what has really made the Austrian market a
trend-bucker this year is the East European connection. Says
Ruben Eingaertner, head of German and Austrian equity sales
at Salomon Brothers Inc. in London: "The Austrian economy has
the same kind of advantages as West Germany, without the cost
of making a major acquisition -- East Germany."</p>
<p>Such optimism caused investors, mainly foreign, to pile
into a market that is one of the world's smallest and had
been sound asleep for most of the 1980s. (Between 1980 and
1988, Vienna increased only 40% in price, compared with a
world average of 370%.)</p>
<p>Since the beginning of 1989, four funds have been formed
for Austrian investments, including Alliance Capital
Management's Austria Fund Inc., listed on the New York Stock
Exchange. At least three others are being planned.</p>
<p>Austria Fund, launched last September with a secondary
offering last February, has $130 million in assets, of which
$30 million represents investment appreciation, estimates
Joseph C. Williams, an Alliance Capital vice president and
the fund's London-based adviser.</p>
<p>Mr. Williams says that after brief market slumps last
October and November, the Vienna scene was "every portfolio
manager's dream: you buy into a falling market and then see
prices zoom."</p>
<p>But even Mr. Williams seems cautious nowadays. Austria
Fund currently is trading at a 15% discount to its $16.15 net
asset value -- it closed on the Big Board yesterday at
$13.75. Mr. Williams acknowledges that it is "a fair theory"
that investors are worried that Austrian stock prices are too
high, and that a sell-off in such a thin market could sharply
accelerate any drop.</p>
<p>Even the market's staunchest supporters say it's so thin
that at times it seems anorexic. Trading on and off the
exchange is controlled by Austria's major banks, and any
trades on the exchange by law must be made through a bank.
Since the exchange is open only between 11 a.m. and 1:30
p.m., about 80% of trades are done off the exchange, mainly
between banks and customers, who use the exchange's prices as
a guide.</p>
<p>Even if the exchange's hours were longer (it is thinking
about adding another half an hour, as it did last September),
it's doubtful whether its market share would leap. Exchange
brokers, called intermediaries, set stock prices based on the
banks' order flow, and arrange trades. But since brokers'
commissions are keyed to share prices, it's to a broker's
advantage to mark up prices when a "buy" order is coming,
concedes Ulrich Kamp, deputy secretary general of the
exchange.</p>
<p>"If we had 50,000 shares to buy, we'd never, never dare
tell the stock exchange -- they'd run the price up," says
Salomon Brothers' Mr. Eingaertner. "Instead, we'd buy the
shares from the issuing company or from a bank" off the
exchange.</p>
<p>Off-board trading also can be a delicate matter because,
despite the recent euphoria, there is still only a relatively
small number of players. Says Erste Allgemeine's Mr. Hoyos:
"If you want to sell something, you'd better not ask more
than one bank, because they'll all approach the same
investor."</p>
<p>Getting into the market has been relatively easy. Getting
out in a down-draft may be quite another thing. "There is a
lack of liquidity," says Mr. Hoyos. "You can't sell out. You
can only sell into this market if it's a strong market," when
prices are rising.</p>
<p>The Vienna market's new-found success also has shown up
its inexperience; euphoria occasionally sweeps everyone
along. Says Mr. Hoyos: "I've seen cases where a stock has
gone up and the calls and the puts have gone up. I get the
impression that some people have no idea what they're doing."</p>
<p>No matter. Demand for young traders and sales persons is
brisk at banks. A sales person with one or two years'
experience can make the equivalent of $50,000 a year.
Although that's modest by Wall Street standards, "banks
didn't even have salesmen in their capital-markets
departments two years ago," says Joachim Kuehnert, an
official at Creditanstalt-Bankverein, Austria's largest bank.</p>
<p>Mr. Kuehnert has high hopes for the future. "Until last
year, Vienna was right at the Iron Curtain," he says. "Today
we are at the center of Europe. And we now have the first
generation of heirs since before World War I. Through the
Depression, World War II and for years after that, people had
no money to leave to their children. In recent years, times
have been better, and we have a generation of venturesome
young people with money."</p>
