	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Bob Guccione's General Media International
Inc. said it will acquire four computer magazines from ABC
Publishing Cos., a subsidiary of Capital Cities/ABC Inc.
   The magazines -- Compute], Compute's Gazette, Compute's
PC, and Compute's Amiga Resource -- will become part of the
Omni magazine division of closely held General Media. The
purchase price wasn't disclosed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Guccione, best known as the founder and publisher of
Penthouse magazine, has expanded his magazine company in
recent years, by acquiring such titles as Four Wheeler, for
auto enthusiasts, and launching Longevity, a health magazine,
last May.</p>
<p>Kathy Keeton, president of Omni magazine, said Omni
frequently features stories on computers. She said with the
computer magazines, Omni can "realize some synergy" in
advertising sales and editorial matter.</p>
<p>"Compute] caters to the home market, and the home-office
market is booming with more than 10 million people who work
at home," said Ms. Keeton. "The magazines have a good
future."</p>
<p>Compute], a monthly with circulation of 211,794, is in
need of "lots and lots of editorial smarting up." The four
magazines are currently published in Greensboro, N.C., but
Ms. Keeton said she didn't know whether they would stay
there.</p>
