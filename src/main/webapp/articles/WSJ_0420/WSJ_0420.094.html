	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- The employer-sanction provisions of the
1986 immigration law have had only a modest effect in
deterring illegal immigration, according to a study by the
Rand Corp. and the Urban Institute.
   The joint report comes amid renewed congressional debate
over whether to repeal or change the sanctions, which impose
civil and criminal penalites on employers who knowingly hire
undocumented workers. In essence, the law requires employers
to police job applicants by obtaining proof of their legal
status.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In their report, the economic and policy research groups
estimated that sanctions have reduced the flow of illegal
immigrants by less than 20%, thus failing to produce the
large declines predicted by some advocates of the law. But if
the intent of the law was to curb any increase in illegal
immigration, the sanctions could be viewed as successful.</p>
<p>The study also found that sanctions apparently haven't
caused a large decline in the availability of illegal
workers. The researchers analyzed labor market data to
measure wage change in certain occupations that traditionally
employ many undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>"Congress may wish to weigh the cost of continuing the
program against its current level of effectiveness," the
researchers said. The study was compiled by economists Keith
W. Crane, Beth H. Asch and authors Joanna Zorn Heilbrunn and
Danielle Cullinane, who analyzed data on border crossings,
U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions, labor markets and other
indicators.</p>
<p>A congressional review of the sanctions was triggered
March 29 by a General Accounting Office study, which found
the law has caused "widespread discrimination" against legal
job applicants who appear "foreign." A hearing of the Senate
Subcommittee on Immigration and Refugee Affairs is scheduled
for today in Washington to discuss the issue.</p>
<p>Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), the subcommittee's
chairman, has introduced legislation to expedite
congressional consideration of any changes or termination of
the sanctions. Many organizations have called for the
sanctions to be repealed, including the American Bar
Association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the U.S. Civil
Rights Commission.</p>
<p>"Many people saw sanctions as a panacea that would correct
all immigration-related problems," said Mario Moreno of the
Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund in
Washington, one of the groups lobbying for a repeal. "But
they're not effective, and Congress is forcing immigration
reform on the backs of the Hispanic and Asian communities."</p>
<p>The Immigration and Naturalization Service contends that
the law has been successful in reducing illegal immigration.
"Have we been able to totally regain control of the border?
No, we haven't," said Duke Austin, an INS spokesman. "But the
law clearly has been effective."</p>
<p>The INS expects to apprehend about one million persons
along the southern border in fiscal 1990, Mr. Austin said.
That compares with the 1.7 million apprehended in 1986, the
year the law passed.</p>
<p>Other groups and lawmakers such as Sen. Alan Simpson (R.,
Wyo.), a sponsor of the 1986 law, have argued that sanctions
should not be repealed. Some have suggested that more funding
be allocated to educate employers about the law, particularly
the anti-discrimination provisions.</p>

based in Santa Monica, Calif.</p>
