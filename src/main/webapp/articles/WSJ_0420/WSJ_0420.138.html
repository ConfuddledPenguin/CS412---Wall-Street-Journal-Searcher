	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Amax Inc., hurt by a softening economy and
sharply lower prices for aluminum ingot and some aluminum
products, posted a 56% drop in first-quarter net income.
   The company, which has interests in domestic energy and
gold production as well as aluminum and manufactured aluminum
products, said net income in the first quarter fell to $50
million, or 57 cents a share, from $114.2 million, or $1.34 a
share, a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales fell 5.3%, to $927.9 million, from $979.6 million.</p>
<p>Allen Born, chairman, chief executive and president, said
a softening of the economy that began in the 1989 third
quarter reduced demand and prices for aluminum ingot and some
aluminum products from the prices a year earlier. Mr. Born
said first-quarter prices for primary aluminum were about 40%
lower than a year ago.</p>
<p>Mr. Born said, however, there had been some recent
strengthening of demand, reflected in prices for some
aluminum products and aluminum ingot. The average price per
pound of aluminum ingot is currently about 72 cents, slightly
better than the 69 cents in the first three months of this
year, although still lower than the year-earlier first
quarter, when the price was about $1.</p>
<p>Andrew Silver, an analyst at Dillon, Read & Co., said
Amax's results were stronger than he expected. "The company
is on track for a respectable performance in a somewhat
difficult environment," he said. The analyst is predicting a
modest improvement for earnings in the second quarter based
on somewhat higher aluminum prices, and estimates earnings of
$2.50 a share for the year. He said the diversity of Amax's
operations helped results during a soft cycle for aluminum,
with about 40% of the company's earnings coming from
non-aluminum activity.</p>
<p>Mr. Born said lower prices for primary ingot, as well as
higher raw-material costs, were partly offset by higher
shipments of semi-fabricated goods and stronger performance
in the company's architectural and building aluminum
products.</p>
<p>The official also noted improvements in the energy and
gold businesses, with Amax Coal contributing $29 million to
operating earnings, up from $20 million a year earlier. Oil
and gas earnings rose 20% to $6 million.</p>
<p>"As the year progresses," Mr. Born said, "we expect the
economy to strengthen and Amax's businesses and earnings to
improve above present levels."</p>
<p>Amax has been a rumored takeover target in recent weeks.
Mr. Silver, the analyst, said that Amax, as the third-largest
aluminum producer and the third-largest coal producer in the
U.S., has "very attractive" assets, which he estimates could
be valued at $35 to $40 a share.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Amax shares closed at $25, down 87.5 cents.</p>
