	<p class="article-leader">NEW ORLEANS -- For a while, it seemed Hibernia Corp. had
discovered the secret to thriving during the oil-region's
bust.
   While many of its competitors concentrated assets in
energy-related loans, the conservative bank holding company
spread its risk. Since 1986, Hibernia has cut its energy
portfolio from 8% of total loans to about 3.6%. The company,
which hadn't even stretched its lending reach beyond its
parish borders before 1985, has now dispersed about 40% of
its loans out of state. The moves helped the company rack up
64 straight quarters of earnings improvement and propelled it
to star status on Wall Street.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Then Hibernia hiccuped.</p>
<p>In March, the company said it would post a first-quarter
loss after a tough examination by regulators. Earlier this
week, the company confirmed the bad news. Citing a $50
million special loan-loss provision, Hibernia reported a
first-quarter net loss of $24.9 million, or 92 cents a share,
compared with year-ago net income of $15.2 million, or 57
cents a share. Nonperforming assets, meanwhile, more than
doubled to $139.5 million from $65.9 million at year end.</p>
<p>Hibernia shrugged off the loss as a onetime glitch,
attributable largely to tough new credit quality standards
being applied by federal bank examiners to spotlight
potential real-estate problems early.</p>
<p>But some analysts, while still generally bullish on the
stock, are beginning to voice concerns. Standard & Poor's
Corp., noting that the loss is expected to reduce tangible
consolidated equity to a relatively thin 5.1% of assets,
downgraded its ratings on Hibernia National Bank's
certificates of deposit to single-A-minus/A-2 from
single-A/A-1, indicating the bank may have to pay a bit more
for some funds. "Even if Hibernia rapidly returns to
profitability, it will need time to strengthen its capital
position," the rating service said.</p>
<p>Analysts' biggest concern centers around Hibernia's
participation in loan syndicates financing leveraged buy-outs
and other so-called highly leveraged transactions, or HLTs.
At year-end, the company had 92 HLT loans outstanding,
totalling $623 million, or 13.1% of the loan portfolio. HLT
loans, in general, involve higher risk for banks because the
borrower's debt load is so high. The risk can be exacerbated
by the fact that banks that buy pieces of loan syndications
often aren't intimately familiar with the borrower's
operations, and may have a hard time predicting default
rates.</p>
<p>"The big concern I have is that nobody really knows what
level of a portfolio of loans to HLTs goes bad," says Peter
Tuz, an analyst with Howard, Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs
Inc., New Orleans. "It's just a new animal -- it hasn't been
around for 10 years or 15 years."</p>
<p>Frank Anderson, an analyst with Stephens Inc., Little
Rock, Ark., worries that, if the economy nosedives, Hibernia
may see an additional $30 million to $50 million in HLT loans
become nonperforming. "Let's face it, if you've got $600
million of HLT credits . . . you know you'll get some more go
nonperforming," he says.</p>
<p>There have already been some troublesome signs for
Hibernia. According to Mr. Tuz, the bank's recent loan
participations include credits totaling about $30 million to
a unit of Campeau Corp.'s Federated Department Stores Inc.,
Doskocil Cos. and Jim Walter Corp. Federated, Doskocil and
Jim Walter have since filed for bankruptcy-court protection
from creditors.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there are also some concerns about Hibernia's
rapid growth -- it has grown to $7.2 billion in assets from
$2 billion in five years -- much of which has been funded by
expensive jumbo certificates of deposit that have squeezed
net interest margins. At year end, Hibernia had about $1.78
billion in time deposits over $100,000, or about 30% of total
deposits, according to Sheshunoff Information Services Inc.
That's about twice the national average for banks. Which
helps explain why net interest margins have shriveled from
4.68% at the end of 1987 to 4.1% by the end of this year's
first quarter.</p>
<p>Hibernia officials, while declining to comment on specific
credits, say concerns about the HLT portfolio are overblown.
Noting the analysts' concern over its exposure to troubled
leveraged buy-outs, O.C. Russell, vice chairman of Hibernia
National Bank, said that "$30 million out of a $5 billion
loan portfolio is not a big problem for an institution with
$109 million in reserves.</p>
<p>At year end, Hibernia officials note, just $9.9 million in
loans, or 1.59% of the HLT portfolio, had stopped accruing
interest, while an additional $26.6 million were classified
as performing but "subject to potential future difficulties"
in meeting repayment terms. Figures for the first quarter
weren't immediately available.</p>
<p>Hibernia's HLT portfolio also is shrinking. At the end of
the first quarter, HLT exposure had declined to $569 million
and Hibernia says it plans to reduce that to $525 million by
year end. Mr. Russell points out that Hibernia scrutinizes
every loan participation with their own stable of
underwriters, whether or not Hibernia is the lead bank.</p>
<p>Moreover, he adds, the company is confident that it has
adequate reserves to cover any problems. He noted that the
$50 million loan-loss provision maintained Hibernia's reserve
level at a conservative 110% of nonperforming loans, despite
the increase in nonperforming assets.</p>
<p>Hibernia officials insist that the future is bright and
that it will soon return to profitability and to its
objective of a minimum 16% return on equity.</p>
<p>Part of that hope stems from the company's expansion in
nearby Texas. During 1989, Hibernia acquired 10 failed banks
and thrifts in the state, as part of its plan to suck up
low-cost core deposits and find new markets for loan growth.
The acquisitions pushed the banking company's total Texas
deposits to $586 million by the end of the first quarter. And
Hibernia isn't through. Eventually, the company hopes to
corral about $1 billion in assets in each of the four major
Texas markets -- Dallas, Houston, Austin and San Antonio.
Hibernia currently has about $600 million of assets in the
state.</p>
<p>Hibernia Chairman Martin C. Miler has referred to the
company as a "muscular dwarf," and it will have to flex a
good deal of that muscle to survive in Texas against giants
such as NCNB Corp. of Charlotte, N.C., which has around $30
billion in Texas assets; Chemical Banking Corp.'s $18
billion-asset Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc. unit; and Banc
One Corp., Columbus, Ohio, which has another $14 billion.
"The competition for the retail business in Texas is going to
get even hotter than it is," says John Russell, a Banc One
spokesman. "Smaller players in the market are going to have a
tough time getting heard."</p>
<p>Hibernia won't disclose its results in Texas, but
officials insist the investment is performing well.</p>
<p>Hibernia's most effective argument that the future is
bright is to point to its recent past. As it has grown in the
past five years, the once-somnolent banking concern has moved
from an also-ran in the New Orleans market to the dominant
bank in Louisiana. Its five-year return on equity has
averaged 17.4% and it boasts the third-lowest overhead ratio
among bank holding companies of its size.</p>
<p>"Over the years we've managed to avoid the malaise of the
oil industry very adroitly, and I think we'll do likewise" in
the HLT realm, Mr. Russell says.</p>
