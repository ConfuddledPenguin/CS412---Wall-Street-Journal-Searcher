	<p class="article-leader">Earth to Owen Lipstein]
   With Earth Day media hype reaching incredible heights, Mr.
Lipstein, owner of Mother Earth News, wants to do the same --
by taking his magazine into the heavens. On Sunday, Earth Day
that is, a recorded version of the magazine will be beamed
into outer space via a satellite transmission from Mount
Everest. A team of climbers will broadcast it from
battery-powered equipment at Everest Base Camp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The sonic message in a bottle is taken from the
March/April issue of Mother Earth News. It contains many
heartfelt messages contributed by the famous and not-so
famous about the world's environment and its present
condition. Alfred Meyer, Mother Earth's editor in chief,
asked an assortment of people to send in messages they would
want blasted into space, supposedly to be received by someone
or something.</p>
<p>Ann Landers, usually a hopeful sort, was gloomy in her
reading: "Our planet is dying," she lamented. Pope John Paul
II spoke of a "cosmos endowed with its own integrity, its own
internal, dynamic balance." Gonzo journalist Hunter S.
Thompson was simply gonzo: "Yesterday's weirdness is
tomorrow's reason why." Michael Kramer, a third grader in
Stamford, Conn., was more clear thinking: "The rain forest
has plants and animals found nowhere else in the world. . . .
It also helps us breathe."</p>
<p>Not everyone was so willing to participate. One respected
(but apparently xenophobic) scientist refused the invitation
to send a message. "He said he didn't want to advertise our
presence. Whatever is out there might be hostile," Mr. Meyer
says.</p>
<p>Cynics might consider this a mere gimmick by a troubled
publisher to grab some cheap publicity. Mr. Lipstein recently
ran into a cash squeeze, with the result that he wasn't
mailing his magazines to subscribers on time. He eventually
had to sell his American Health magazine.</p>
<p>"It's promotional," Mr. Lipstein concedes, "but it's also
a profound thought." He certainly knows a good thing when he
sees it. The resurging interest in saving the Earth is
"reminiscent of the health and fitness boom eight or nine
years ago," he says, proclaiming, "It's fortuitous that we
have a magazine called Mother Earth News."</p>
<p>And it's fortuitous that "readers" in faraway galaxies
will get it for free: They really can't complain if it
arrives late.</p>
