	<p class="article-leader">Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America said it plans to build
a $51 million pipeline to move gas produced in Oklahoma's
Arkoma Basin to another recently completed Natural Gas
pipeline in the southeastern part of the state.
   Natural Gas is the interstate transmission unit of MidCon
Corp., a subsidiary of Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum
Corp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The project involves construction of 107 miles of 24-inch
pipeline running from Latimer County, Okla., westward into
Pittsburg County and then south through Atoka and Bryan
counties, where it will link with the recently completed
line.</p>
<p>Compression for the proposed pipeline will be supplied by
a new 4,000-horsepower compressor facility to be built in
northern Atoka County. The pipeline will transport as much as
300 million cubic feet of gas a day, Natural Gas said.
Construction could get under way as soon as this summer.</p>
