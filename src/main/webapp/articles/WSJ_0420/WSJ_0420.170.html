	<p class="article-leader">BASF AG said it will raise its 1989 dividend 8% to 13
Deutsche marks ($7.78) a share from 12 marks and will pay an
additional one-mark bonus to celebrate the company's 125th
anniversary.
   The dividend announcement by the West German chemical
group had been expected by analysts after BASF last month
reported an 18% jump in 1989 group pretax earnings to a
record 4.38 billion marks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The total amount distributed to shareholders will climb
17% to 798 million marks from 684 million marks in 1988, and
the addition to reserves will be boosted to 600 million marks
from 500 million marks, BASF said.</p>
<p>The dividend payment still has to be approved by the
company's annual shareholder meeting June 28.</p>
