	<p class="article-leader">When I was a kid, playing softball in Chicago's McPherson
School playground, my pals and I knew a few things about
strategy. We played little guys shallow and big guys deep.
Very big guys, we walked. We recognized "pull" hitters when
we saw them, and defensed them accordingly. Little did we
suspect that we were partaking of the "complexities and
nuances" of the game.
   Yet according to George F. Will, we were. And we were
being pretty clever, too. Baseball, writes Mr. Will, is "a
game that rewards, and thus elicits, a remarkable level of
intelligence from those who compete." I assume he means
softball, too.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Will is nothing if not serious about his favorite
sport, and the attitude permeates his book "Men at Work: The
Craft of Baseball" (Macmillan, 353 pages, $19.95). A
political commentator by trade, he is a tourist between the
foul lines, but an inquisitive and extraordinarily
nimble-minded one. Moreover, he is adept at summoning
testimony from baseball insiders whose vocabulary and methods
of analysis may be more familar to the average fan's ear than
his own. "There's a lot of stuff goes on," notes Oakland A's
manager Tony LaRussa. That there is.</p>
<p>Mr. Will breaks his book into four main parts -- managing,
pitching, hitting and fielding -- and draws on experts to
describe the fine points of each. For instance, Baltimore
Oriole shortstop Cal Ripken Jr. confides that, in a steal
situation, he always receives his catcher's throw at the base
instead of reaching forward for it, because a thrown ball
will travel that foot or so a whit faster than he can jerk
back his glove. The subdivisions, however, also serve as
avenues for wide-ranging explorations of the game's history
and trends.</p>
<p>"Men at Work" isn't light reading, and tends to
over-intellectualize kinds of baseball knowledge that small
boys divine by osmosis. Still, it's more than worth the
effort, and gets my vote as this season's baseball-book
choice if you're reading only one.</p>
<p>Mr. Wills' seriousness is matched in another new book,
"Nine Sides of the Diamond" (Random House, 371 pages,
$18.95), by David Faulkner. Mr. Faulkner employs a narrower
focus than does Mr. Will, concentrating on the art of
baseball fielding, position by position. This leads to
repetition (good fielders get to Yankee Stadium the same way
violinists get to Carnegie Hall -- practice) and some lengthy
talespinning, such as Bobby Richardson's two-page explanation
of how he snared Willie McCovey's bullet line drive for the
final out of the 1962 Yanks-Giants World Series. The book
succeeds for the same reason "Work" does: the author's skill
in blending instruction, anecdote and lore. Too bad both came
out the same year.</p>
<p>For the less literary-minded, there's a work that delivers
scads of interesting facts about the game with few
embellishments. It's "The Physics of Baseball" (Perennial
Library, 110 pages, $7.95), by Robert K. Adair. Read it and
you'll learn that a curve ball doesn't "break" but travels in
a smooth arc, that fastballs don't rise or batted balls speed
up after they bounce, and that a 10 mph headwind can turn a
400-foot home run into a 370-foot out. Prof. Adair
illustrates those things mathematically, but you can skip
that.</p>
<p>"Prophet of the Sandlots" (Atlantic Monthly Press, 279
pages, $18.95), by Mark Winegardner, chronicles a season the
author spent on Midwest backroads with the late Tony
Lucadello, the storied, longtime scout for the Philadelphia
Phillies. Lucadello dispenses bird-dog wisdom ("87% of
baseball is played below the waist"), spends hours searching
under bleachers for lost coins, and despairs for the future
of the game in an era in which the best athletes choose
basketball or football.</p>
<p>In the end, with no warning to family or friends,
Lucadello blows out his brains on the sidelines of a
small-town Ohio field. Nonetheless, the book eschews pathos,
and stands as a fond monument to an intuitive solo
practitioner of a trade that's fast becoming corporatized.</p>
<p>The preceding books call for cheery antidotes, and some
are available, perhaps unexpectedly. One might think that
"Sparky]" (Prentice Hall, 264 pages, $18.95), by veteran
Detroit Tigers manager Sparky Anderson with Dan Ewald, would
be full of inside stratagems, but it ain't. Sparky devotes
but one chapter to managing, and a quarter of that is on how
to get along with the news media. He believes that a direct
glance and firm handshake are among a manager's best assets.
I leave it to Mr. Will to dispute him.</p>
<p>"The Year I Owned the Yankees: A Baseball Fantasy" (Bantam
Books, 313 pages, 17.95), by Sparky Lyle and David Fisher,
has a few good yuks. A conglomerate buys the Steinbrenner
business empire for tax-loss purposes and puts ex-pitcher
Lyle in charge of the baseball team, it's only profitable
part. He makes some cute moves, like hiring Reggie Jackson as
team "ego coach." A 46-year-old New Jersey dentist, recruited
from a fantasy camp, makes the team as a knuckleballer but
opts for dentistry instead. The book is in diary form, and I
admit I didn't get past June. But Yankee-lovers should like
it.</p>
<p>The pick of the baseball-history books I read was "Two
Spectacular Seasons" (Macmillan, 288 pages, $17.95), by
William B. Mead. It's about the 1930 campaign, when the
hitters dominated, and the 1968 one, when the pitchers did.
Mr. Mead does particularly well with the '30 season, which
was a bonanza for baseball oddments as well as base hits.</p>
<p>"Yaz" (Doubleday, 300 pages, $19.95), by Carl Yastrzemski
and Gerald Eskenazi, is a bit of a grind, matching the career
of baseball's quintessential grinder. "The Whole Baseball
Catalogue" (Fireside, 370 pages, $17.95), edited by John
Thorne and Bob Carroll, tells about baseball board games,
where to get the best ballpark food in the minor leagues, and
other useful stuff. "Stengel: His Life and Times" (Fireside,
349 pages, $9.95), by Robert W. Creamer, is a welcome
paperback edition of the classic about Ol' Case.</p>
