	<p class="article-leader">Continuing a strong rebound, Lotus Development Corp. said
first-quarter profit more than tripled on a 38% sales gain.
   The big software maker reported net income of $22.8
million, or 53 cents a share, compared with weak year-ago net
of $5.3 million, or 13 cents a share. Sales rose to $165.5
million from $119.9 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Lotus's first-quarter results were at the high end of
analysts' expectations, and its shares closed at $34.375, up
$1.125, in active national over-the-counter trading.</p>
<p>Lotus is entering a strong new-product cycle and is
expected to show respectable growth this year. But there were
some troubling signs in the mix of product sales disclosed
yesterday that suggest the recent growth rate will be
difficult to sustain.</p>
<p>Lotus, based in Cambridge, Mass., said sales of its
flagship 1-2-3 product line were strong but that customers
were buying far more copies of the less-expensive version 2.2
than version 3.0, a more powerful product with higher profit
margins. The company had hoped for a roughly even split in
sales between these two products. Instead, 3.0 amounted to
about 24% of total spreadsheet sales while 2.2 accounted for
about 70%, with the rest coming from older versions.</p>
<p>Revenue from software-license upgrades also fell during
the quarter. "Upgrades are clearly winding down," says David
Readerman of Shearson Lehman Hutton, though he expects them
to continue to boost results during 1990. One surprise was
the strong sales of 1-2-3 versions designed to work in
computer networks, executives said.</p>
<p>Lotus said international sales were especially strong
during the quarter, particularly in Japan, and accounted for
more than half of total revenue for the first time. But
domestic sales grew just 9%, according to Richard Sherlund of
Goldman, Sachs & Co., a "puzzling slowdown for which Lotus
had no good explanation," he said.</p>
<p>Lotus surprised the software industry earlier this month
when it said it would merge with Novell Inc. of Provo, Utah.
Lotus is the largest maker of personal computer spreadsheets,
while Novell is the leader in the software needed to run
networks. Lotus has said that the combination of the two
companies is a good strategic fit because of the increasing
importance of computer networks.</p>
<p>Robert Schechter, Lotus's chief financial officer, said
the two companies expect to complete a definitive merger
agreement in about three weeks. The agreement is structured
as a straight stock swap, valued at about $1.5 billion.</p>
<p>The merger agreement, subject to approval by two-thirds of
Novell's shareholders, offers no premium to the Novell
holders. Because of this, there have been suggestions that
Novell's large institutional holders might try to force
better terms for the deal. But analysts were skeptical
yesterday that such a move would succeed.</p>
