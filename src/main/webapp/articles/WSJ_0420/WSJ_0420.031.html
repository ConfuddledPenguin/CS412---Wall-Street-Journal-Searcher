	<p class="article-leader">Dallas -- Earth Day isn't coming any too soon for Henry
Brant. For nearly 40 years, this peculiarly American composer
has written music for the environment. His pieces have hymned
hot springs and geysers and they have resonated in defense of
poisoned earth and air. His double-bass concerto "Ghost Nets"
(1988) rumbled in distress over the wanton slaughter of
dolphins and other Pacific marine animals. And last year, his
requiem "Rainforest" mourned the destruction of equatorial
jungles.
   This preoccupation with ecology grows organically, so to
speak, out of Mr. Brant's basic practice as a composer, since
he often writes site-specific music that can be performed
only in the place for which it was conceived. This has
assured his uniqueness -- and his relative anonymity.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>His pieces tend to have limited runs (new works are
forthcoming in Boston, San Francisco, Saratoga Springs, N.Y.,
and San Jose, Calif.), but some of them are, quite literally,
unhearable and unrecordable because they take place across a
vast territory. And they usually are unrepeatable. Whatever
Christo is to the visual arts, Henry Brant is to music.</p>
<p>Last week, the Dallas Symphony Orchestra, under the batons
of Mr. Brant, James Rives-Jones and six others, premiered the
latest Brant work, "Prisons of the Mind," at the Morton H.
Meyerson Symphony Center here. And Mr. Brant took his cue
from the same sources that inspired I.M. Pei's design for the
hall's marble and granite planes, curvilinear glass and
ever-changing shafts of light. Like Mr. Pei, Mr. Brant
studied Piranesi's series of sketches, "Carceri d'Invenzione"
("Imaginary Prisons"), which originally were executed in the
18th century.</p>
<p>Those fantastic, labyrinthine drawings, all high spaces,
unfathomable depths and peculiar vanishing points, in which
human beings, when present, seem to perform rituals at once
medieval and technological, gave Mr. Pei the idea for the
Meyerson's grand public spaces, which are deliberately
overwhelming, in contrast to the intimate shoe- or
jewel-box-like interior of the concert hall itself.</p>
<p>All composers write for spaces, at least in theory, and
all sound comes through space, but Mr. Brant has been
practicing a uniquely space-conscious art since 1951 when,
according to his own account, he heard the Berlioz Requiem in
Paris, and shortly thereafter conducted Charles Ives's "The
Unanswered Question" and the canzone of Gabrieli at
Juilliard. Since then, his compositions have involved such
unlikely combinations as 80 trombones and organ ("Orbits,
1979"); orchestra, choirs, jazz band, gamelan ensemble and
African drummers ("Meteor Farm," 1982); and, in his most
ambitious piece before "Prisons," four traveling barges, each
containing 25 flutists and a jazz drummer, plus church
carillons, three brass bands and four hand-organs, all
deployed at different points throughout the canals and
central square of Amsterdam ("Fire on the Amstel," 1984).</p>
<p>The 77-year-old composer, who looks like a combination of
Woody Allen and Peter Pan, revealed some of his mysterious
intentions for "Prisons" when he spoke gnomically to the
opening-night audience, and remarked that some prisons of the
mind are menacing and some seductive.</p>
<p>For this reason, he scored "Prisons" for 314 players and
eight conductors. On stage sat two identical orchestras of
strings, harp, piano, percussion and tuba. Above each half of
the orchestra was a group of woodwinds; between them, in the
space of the yet unfinished organ, stood three trombonists.
Two brass ensembles occupied the front section of an
upper-level balcony. Two invisible local high school bands
were located within the distinctive reverberation chambers
(designed by acoustician Russell Johnson) at the top of the
house, and next to them, at the very back, were two
steel-band ensembles. The performers were symmetrically
placed, each group opposite its mirror half.</p>
<p>Menace and seduction are indeed the principal moods set by
the piece, in its seven sections played without pause. As if
working progressively through layers of orchestral sound,
"Prisons" begins with the winds, continues with the on-stage
strings in glimmers of a haunting melody that gradually is
augmented by the timpani. The tubas threaten; the off-stage
bands initially return echoes from the above and the beyond.
The brass in the rafters sounds Gabrielian anthems. The sound
comes and goes in waves.</p>
<p>The composition seems to be about matters of provocation
and response; one group inspires either its symmetrical
opposite or one of the other groups in the hall. The texture
of individual sounds is more significant than melodic
substance. Most important of all is origination: For all the
apparent sameness in its symmetries and reflected harmonies,
"Prisons" challenges the ear most by avoiding the usual
full-frontal assaults of music from the traditional concert
repertory. Sound is everywhere, surrounding but variable.
Listening to the piece both from the floor and from an upper
balcony, one realized that Mr. Brant intended it to have a
sonically dizzying quality. The sounds from above pour down,
washing the auditor in the full spectrum of musical colors.</p>
<p>In this way, the composer has translated Piranesi's
vertiginous perspectives into music. With brass and
percussion ringing from all over the hall, one often feels
that the sound is coming from within one's own head, or from
some highly refined Walkman.</p>
<p>Abrasive or strident sounds (what I took to be the prisons
of menace) alternate with suppler, more delicate ones. We get
the sense, especially with the woodwinds, of a haunting
reminiscence, something perhaps heard before but largely
unidentifiable. This must be what Mr. Brant referred to as
the seductive kind of prison. Ending with the calypso
syncopations of the steel drums, physically the most distant
instruments (and part of a more foreign culture as well),
"Prisons" comes to a quiet halt with faint echoes, whispers
of remembrance of another time and place. The last sounds
come from the off-stage brass, reverberating for four seconds
into silence, and then sinking back into the architecture.</p>
