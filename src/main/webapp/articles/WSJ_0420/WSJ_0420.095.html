	<p class="article-leader">Alluding to the Russian empire's annexation of unwilling
peoples, Karl Marx was once moved to call Russia "the prison
of nations." While this has never been more true than under
communism, Mikhail Gorbachev was supposed to represent a
repudiation of the impulse.
   He did in fact keep Soviet troops in their barracks as the
Soviet empire collapsed in Eastern Europe. In Beijing just
before Tiananmen Square, he said that were a similar
situation to develop in the Soviet Union, it would be solved
"within the political process, and in the spirit of
glasnost." But this Mr. Gorbachev has been lost, and we now
see him resolving events in Lithuania in the spirit of the
Brezhnev Doctrine.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Apparently Mr. Gorbachev is willing to give up nations the
Soviet Union conquered while it was an ally of the West, but
not those it conquered when it was an ally of Hitler five or
six years earlier. Whatever validity anyone may find in this
distinction, the startling thing is the price he seems
willing to pay to hold Lithuania. To wit, his entire program
of both perestroika and glasnost.</p>
<p>Those who do business with the Soviet Union should
particularly wonder how an economic embargo fits into
perestroika. Closing down existing pipelines for political
reasons is not going to help the Soviet economy. Can the
Soviets really maximize their production by closing down
refineries?</p>
<p>Even if tanks do not in the end run through Vilnius, the
Lithuanian crisis is also exposing the limits of glasnost.
Much fuss was made over the newly independent press, but the
major organizations -- Pravda, Izvestia, Soviet television --
have been snapped back into line. They are printing a stream
of coordinated misinformation about Lithuania. According to a
Radio Free Europe analyst, "The campaign appears to be
unprecedented in the era of glasnost, and can only be
compared with Soviet media coverage of the Soviet invasion of
Czechoslovakia in 1968."</p>
<p>Since the final confrontations with Andrei Sakharov, there
has been a different Gorbachev on the TV screens: irritable,
arrogant, intolerant, cruel. Indeed, he is beleaguered on all
sides. Soviet generals have become vocal and belligerent,
fearing that Lithuanian draft-dodging will set off
anti-militarism nationwide. Last month a group of KGB
officials issued a dramatic appeal for the restoration of
order in society.</p>
<p>The leadership cannot settle on an economic plan, though
the deadline is past. On Wednesday the leader of the Soviet
trade union federation, representing 140 million workers,
threatened to tank the entire economic project if the state
does not meet his demands, including guaranteed jobs for all
workers.</p>
<p>The Soviet troops have tried to provoke violence, but the
Lithuanians, who in the past weeks have been conciliatory at
every turn, would have none of it. Even some conservatives
write off the Baltics, but independence is no passing fancy
in Lithuania. There was a guerrilla war against Soviet
occupiers from 1945 to 1952, despite tens of thousands of
deportations. In the 1970s and 1980s, there were more
dissident publications per capita in Lithuania than any other
republic.</p>
<p>Despite their fears, the Lithuanians will hunker down.
President Vytautus Landsbergis has said bravely that his
people could endure for months. Citizens in the West might
remember that it is possible to hire supply ships, and
Lithuania has ports and things to trade. The nations on the
Baltic Sea seem unwilling to offer practical assistance,
except perhaps Norway.</p>
<p>Western governments are now limbering up their jawbone
muscles. Typically, the European Community has called for a
committee to prepare a report on the matter. But in general
foreign-policy officers in all governments have been loath to
let Lithuania endanger their own pet projects. Arms
controllers don't want arms control disturbed, trade
negotiators want their talks to continue, and Germany in
particular does not want to endanger the chance of
unification.</p>
<p>Yet Lithuania is likely to prove a defining event. If Mr.
Gorbachev does not stand for openness and economic
restructuring in the Baltics, then he does not stand for them
at all. Mr. Gorbachev has been primarily concerned with
staying in power, and has surely observed that in every
nation of Eastern Europe, true reform meant the ouster of the
communist leadership. Boris Yeltsin will probably lead a
split in the party. What might Mr. Gorbachev be thinking?</p>
<p>In Lithuania he is developing a formula -- use troops not
to mob the streets but to occupy key buildings, do not shoot
people indiscriminately but arrest them one by one, do not
move until you have expelled Western correspondents, turn off
energy supplies. If it succeeds in Lithuania it can be
applied elsewhere. In East Germany the Soviets still have
380,000 troops; and even West European nations have put part
of their energy supply at risk by paying for the pipeline
some of us warned against in the early 1980s. Above all,
Lithuania shows that Mr. Gorbachev is not the open, liberal
reformer so many in the West have imagined. Who lost
Gorbachev? He was never ours to lose.</p>
