	<p class="article-leader">BETHPAGE, N.Y. -- Grumman Corp. is weighing new layoffs
while promising generous severance pay to top executives in
the event they lose their jobs following a takeover.
   John O'Brien, Grumman chairman and president, said after
the annual meeting yesterday that the defense company's
first-quarter earnings will be flat compared with last year's
first-quarter profit of $16 million, or 46 cents a share.
That confirms expectations of securities analysts who follow
the company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. O'Brien said the company is reviewing all aspects of
its business, including "staffing levels across the board,"
partly with the aim of cutting expenses. "I have no doubt
that we can take many millions of dollars of annual operating
cost out of this company without sacrificing anything of
business value," he said.</p>
<p>In the proxy statement for the meeting, Grumman also
disclosed the new severance packages, known as "golden
parachutes," which cover 27 "key employees," including Mr.
O'Brien and his top four officers. The plan would pay the
employees 2.99 times their average annual base pay for the
previous five years, if they are dismissed after a change in
control of the company. Mr. O'Brien's base pay in 1989 was
$384,375, before a $180,000 bonus.</p>
<p>Mr. O'Brien said the companywide review, aided by the
management consultant, McKinsey & Co., could lead to the
divestiture of parts of the corporation. "We're examining the
businesses we're in and how they fit into our corporate
strategy. If there are some that don't fit, we'll divest
them," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. O'Brien added that Grumman expects to receive a
production contract for the Air Force's Joint STARS flying
surveillance and command system next year, which he has
previously stated could produce between $6 billion and $10
billion in revenue. He added that Grumman anticipates that
its international business will grow by $500 million a year
during the next five years.</p>
