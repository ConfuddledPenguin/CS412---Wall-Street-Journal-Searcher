	<p class="article-leader">Digital Equipment Corp. said its third-quarter profit fell
90%, after a $150 million charge, but Wall Street was so
relieved the results weren't worse that the stock advanced in
heavy trading.
   Digital also reported slim but better-than-expected
revenue growth, including the first rise in domestic sales in
four quarters, suggesting that the long U.S.
computer-industry slump may be easing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Earlier, International Business Machines Corp., NCR Corp.
and Tandem Computers Inc. reported modest improvements in
U.S. revenue. Unisys Corp. said yesterday that domestic sales
were still slow, but analysts said the company's problems may
be more of its own making.</p>
<p>"This might just be the beginning of a turnaround, with
some of the largest companies seeing signs of improvement in
U.S. sales," suggested Jay P. Stevens, an analyst with Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc.</p>
<p>Digital had earlier set expectations so low that anything
short of a loss, which the company said was possible earlier
in the quarter, would have been welcomed. "The bottom line is
that the worst didn't happen, and that's as good as it gets
in the technology sector right now," said Steve Milunovich of
First Boston Corp.</p>
<p>Digital, the second-largest computer maker after IBM,
posted net income of $24.9 million, or 20 cents a share,
after a charge of $150 million, or $1.20 a share, related to
work-force reduction costs. In the year-earlier period, net
was $256.4 million, or $2.05 a share.</p>
<p>Revenue rose 4.3% for the fiscal third quarter ended March
31 to $3.26 billion from $3.13 billion.</p>
<p>Investors applauded the results. In New York Stock
Exchange composite trading yesterday, Digital shares closed
at $82.125, up $2.125. It was among the most-actively traded
stocks, with almost 1.9 million shares changing hands.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Maynard, Mass.-based company warned
that additional work-force related charges were likely.
"Further opportunities for cost savings are being
investigated, and there may be additional restructuring
charges in the future," said James F. Osterhoff, vice
president and chief financial officer. Without the charge,
Digital would have reported operating profit of perhaps $1 or
$1.10 a share, after accounting for added taxes, analysts
estimated.</p>
<p>The $150 million third-quarter charge was the first
restructuring charge in Digital's history. Analysts are
forecasting a charge in the fourth quarter of the same size
or greater, as Digital continues to cut its payroll through a
voluntary separation-incentive program.</p>
<p>Digital disclosed that 700 people have left the company so
far under the program, and an additional 350 are expected to
leave in cutbacks at two plants in Puerto Rico. Digital said
its plans are still "evolving." Sources have indicated that
as many as 8,000 workers will be offered severance packages,
and analysts expect a cut of more than 5,000 jobs from the
work force of 125,800. But the program is progressing more
slowly than expected.</p>
<p>Digital said international sales remained strong,
especially in Germany, Italy and Japan, and sales improved
somewhat in the United Kingdom. In the U.S., government sales
were weak, while the financial and manufacturing sectors
showed renewed strength, a spokesman said.</p>
<p>Still, executives signaled continuing concern for the
fourth quarter, and analysts said the company isn't out of
the woods yet.</p>
<p>"International growth slowed, measured in local
currencies, for the third quarter in a row," said Barry F.
Willman of Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. And he said some of the
strength in the third quarter "may have come at the expense
of fourth-quarter sales" because the company was so concerned
about the prospect of a loss.</p>
<p>For the nine months, net income fell 56% to $331.1
million, or $2.65 a share, compared with $759.4 million, or
$5.94 a share, a year earlier. Revenue advanced 3.6% to $9.58
billion from $9.25 billion.</p>
