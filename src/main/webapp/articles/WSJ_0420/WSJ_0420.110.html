	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- Even though the redesigned Ford Escort and
Mercury Tracer will be unprofitable from the start, Ford
Motor Co. will likely spend more money advertising the launch
of the subcompacts than it has with any other cars.
   Ford officials said they will at least equal the record
amount they spent to promote the introduction of the Ford
Taurus and Mercury Sable midsized sedans in late 1985 and
1986. The Ford officials declined to reveal the size of the
ad budgets for the 1991 Escort and Tracer, which are
scheduled to start reaching showrooms later this month. But
Advertising Age estimates Escort and Tracer ad spending will
reach $100 million compared with the $90 million spent on the
Taurus and Sable.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Past versions of the Escort have been among the most
popular cars sold in the U.S. But Ford has already conceded
it will lose money on the new versions of the subcompact,
which will have a base price of $7,565.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Escort and its Tracer twin are crucial
to Ford's continued overall profitability. The reason: Under
federal corporate average fuel economy standards, Ford must
sell huge quantities of fuel-efficient cars in order to sell
all of the large cars, which bring big profits.</p>
<p>"This is the most important launch of a new vehicle in the
history of the company in our belief," John B. Vanderzee,
advertising manager of the auto maker's Ford division said at
a press luncheon yesterday. "It is more important than the
first launch of Escort in 1980, the Mustang {in 1965} and
Taurus in 1986."</p>
<p>Ford has already invested nearly $2 billion in the
development of the new Escort and its state-of-the-art
production facilities, which can make about 400,000 Escorts a
year.</p>
<p>Ford also plans to use the Escort, which was last year
upstaged by the Honda Accord as the best-selling car in the
U.S., as a means to attract car buyers who tend to purchase
import vehicles.</p>
<p>"We believe we have a legitimate contender for import
intenders," said Robert Gillooly, the Ford division's car
advertising manager. "We are going after them in a big way."</p>
<p>Similar to the launch of the 1986 Taurus, as much as 75%
of the Ford division's car advertising budget will be used to
promote the Escort name for the next five months, Mr.
Gillooly said.</p>
<p>To reach import car buyers, Mr. Gillooly said Ford is
embarking on its "biggest print program ever" by taking four
to eight-page advertisements in weekly and monthly magazines.
At the same time Ford plans to maintain its strategy of
spending two-thirds of its Escort ad budget on television.</p>
<p>The theme of the new Escort ads will be: "A new line of
thought. A new line of cars." The television and print
advertisements will show the technological and engineering
process used to design and develop the new Escorts. The new
Escort ads, at least initially, won't dwell on the
subcompact's price, which was a focus of previous Escort
marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>Neither will the ads mention the role Mazda Motor Corp.,
Ford's Japanese partner, played in the Escort's engineering.
Mazda supplied key parts such as automotive transmissions and
some multivalve engines for the sportier GT versions of the
car. Ford officials said their studies indicate that there is
no added advantage of including Mazda's name in the ads.</p>
