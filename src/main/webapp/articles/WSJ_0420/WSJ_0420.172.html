	<p class="article-leader">Anglo American Corp. of South Africa Ltd., Johannesburg,
said first-quarter combined net income of its six gold mines
fell 15% to 443.9 million rand ($167.8 million) from 523.4
million rand in the previous quarter.
   South African gold mines supply quarterly, rather than
annual, results, because swings in revenue, tax and spending
tend to obscure the longer comparison. Overall interim and
year-end earnings are reported with year-to-year comparisons.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Anglo American's overall gold production in the first
quarter exceeded 1.9 million troy ounces, a 3.5% decline from
the quarter ended Dec. 31. Sporadic labor unrest and
seismicity caused a drop in gold output by the group's
second-largest producer, Vaal Reefs Exploration & Mining Co.
The third-largest producer, Western Deep Levels Ltd., also
lost output as a result of a fire in the previous quarter.
But Free State Consolidated Gold Mines Ltd., the world's
largest gold mine, improved its performance, despite some
loss of production owing to industrial action and damage
caused by a late-March tornado.</p>
