	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency
announced a new policy that could allow wider regulation of
cancer-causing pesticides found in processed foods, but it is
unlikely to reduce pesticide residues anytime soon.
   For the first time, the EPA said it might ban uses of
pesticides that have long been on the market if their
residues in processed foods pose more than a minimal cancer
risk to consumers. Up to now, the agency had agreed to
enforce a cancer-risk standard on processed foods only for
newly registered pesticides; environmental groups said that
left out at least 66 pesticides that are suspected of causing
cancer in test animals.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While the new policy is a theoretical victory, it is
"really a mixed blessing," said Janet Hathaway, a lawyer with
the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental
group. For example, the policy doesn't mean that EPA will
launch cancer-risk investigations for the 66 pesticides. EPA
officials said their approach will be more gradual; cancer
risks in processed foods will be examined at the same time
the agency conducts lengthy studies on the general safety of
each pesticide now on the market.</p>
<p>Ms. Hathaway also argued that the EPA's minimal-risk
standard is too lenient. She said her group intends to go to
court to try to force a stricter interpretation of the
so-called Delaney Clause of the Federal Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act, which she contends demands that any pesticide
posing any cancer risk be banned from food.</p>
