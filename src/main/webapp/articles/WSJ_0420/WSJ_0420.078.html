	<p class="article-leader">Late-afternoon sell programs knocked the wind out an
already weak stock market, and bond prices continued their
decline, albeit at a slower pace.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 20.94 points to
close at 2711.94 in moderate trading. Long-term bond prices
were off moderately, while the dollar was mixed, rising
against the mark but falling against the yen.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts said stock prices remain at the mercy of the
declining bond market. As bond prices fall, interest rates
rise, providing an incentive for investors to seek safety in
cash rather than in stocks or bonds. Once bond prices appear
stabilized, the higher rates that many analysts expect are
likely to attract more investors to bonds than to stocks.</p>
<p>The erosion of bond prices stems from growing concern that
inflation isn't under control and that the Federal Reserve
will have to drive short-term interest rates higher if it
expects to curb rising prices. Compounding the inflation
worries are apparent selling by Japanese investors and the
prospect early next month of a $30 billion Treasury refunding
auction.</p>
<p>Bond traders said that with little economic news to drive
the market yesterday, selling pressures moderated
considerably. On Wednesday, long-term Treasury bonds plunged
more than a full point, or more than $10 for each $1,000 of
face amount. Nevertheless, traders are bracing for yields on
long-term Treasury bonds to hit the 9% level in coming weeks.
Yesterday the yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year issue
stood at 8.84%.</p>
<p>Stock prices were moderately weak all of yesterday,
generally tracking bond prices. But computer-assisted sell
programs tied to stock-index arbitrage forced prices even
lower in the final half-hour of trading. Absent the programs,
traders said, the fall in prices that took the Dow
industrials down nearly 33 points Wednesday seemed to have
moderated.</p>
<p>So far, the downward pressure on stocks has come from the
bond market and not from corporate earnings, which many
analysts expected to be much worse. While some companies'
profits have indeed been disappointing, there have been some
positive surprises.</p>
<p>In major market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices fell in moderate trading. Volume on the New
York Stock Exchange totaled 152.9 million shares. Declining
issues surpassed gainers 968 to 511.</p>
<p>Bond prices were modestly lower. The 30-year Treasury lost
about 1/8 point.</p>
<p>The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading, the U.S.
currency was quoted at 1.6784 marks and 157.20 yen, compared
with 1.6722 marks and 158.10 yen.</p>
