	<p class="article-leader">Textron Inc., Providence, R.I., said first-quarter net
income rose 4.5% to $66.2 million, or 73 cents a share, on a
2.7% rise in revenue to $1.88 billion.
   Per-share earnings for the period were flat compared with
the year-earlier quarter, because the number of shares
outstanding rose 4% to 90.6 million from 87 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the 1989 first quarter, Textron had net income of $63.3
million, or 73 cents a share, on revenue of $1.83 billion.</p>
<p>B.F. Dolan, chairman and chief executive officer of the
aerospace, commercial products and financial services
concern, said, "Textron's balanced diversity has enabled us
to achieve a good start on the year, despite softness in
several of our markets."</p>
<p>Mr. Dolan said continued strength in the company's finance
and insurance businesses "more than offset" the current
slowdown in its automotive divisions.</p>
<p>Total revenue in Textron's Aerospace Technology sector,
its largest business segment, rose about 2% to $825.9
million; while revenue in the financial services sector rose
13% to $586.9 million. Revenue in the commercial products
sector, however, dropped 5% to $470.6 million.</p>
