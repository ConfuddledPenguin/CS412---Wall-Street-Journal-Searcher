	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- Georgia Gulf Corp. said its shareholders
overwhelmingly approved its recapitalization plan at a
special meeting, ending the chemical company's protracted and
bitter battle against a takeover by Dallas investor Harold C.
Simmons.
   The company also reported that first-quarter earnings fell
32% to $37.4 million from $55.4 million, largely due to a
drop in prices on its products and resulting lower profit
margins. Per-share earnings dropped 28% to $1.52 from $2.12
based on 24.6 million shares outstanding compared with 26
million a year ago.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Revenue in the quarter declined 21% to $251.6 million from
$317.8 million the year earlier.</p>
<p>Georgia Gulf said that closing on the financing of its
recapitalization, which is the last remaining element of the
plan, is expected near the end of next week. If so, the
company said the plan will become effective next Friday.</p>
<p>Some 97% of the voting shareholders were in favor of the
recapitalization plan. The company said 67.4% of its total
shareholders were eligible to vote, based on the Feb. 18
record date.</p>
<p>Under the recapitalization, shareholders will receive $30
in cash, $8.50 principal amount of a new issue of 15% senior
subordinated notes maturing in the year 2000, and one share
of a new issue of common stock. Through yesterday,
shareholders also had the choice, with respect to as much as
30% of their holdings, to receive 5.5 new shares for each
share currently held.</p>
<p>Georgia Gulf said yesterday that it was still tallying the
final number of shares tendered in that fashion, but noted
that a condition of the plan requiring that at least 1.5
million shares elect that choice had been met.</p>
<p>The shareholder approval culminates an eight-month fight
by Georgia Gulf to fend off various takeover maneuvers of Mr.
Simmons and Houston-based NL Industries Inc., a specialty
chemical company that he controls.</p>
<p>J. Landis Martin, president and chief executive officer of
NL and a top Simmons strategist, said the group was pleased
that Georgia Gulf's plan was approved "and we hope it gets
closed quickly." He said the group, which owns 9.6% of
Georgia Gulf, will watch how the market values the new stock
and debt before deciding whether it will hold on to it or
sell.</p>
<p>Mr. Simmons made several offers that were rebuffed by
Georgia Gulf's board. In January, Georgia Gulf weighed in
with its own recapitalization plan -- but it had to revamp
the plan in March because of uncertainty in the junk-bond
market.</p>
<p>Mr. Simmons acquiesced earlier this month by allowing his
final $45-a-share, or $1 billion, tender offer, which Georgia
Gulf had rejected, to expire and he embraced the company's
plan.</p>
<p>Regarding the company's lower earnings, Georgia Gulf said
it was facing a particularly tough comparison in the first
quarter because last year its prices and margins were at
historical highs.</p>
<p>Jerry R. Satrum, Georgia Gulf's president and chief
operating officer, said that during 1989, especially the
first half, "business conditions were robust and pricing
reflected spot shortgages for most products." He added that
while prices for some products continue to soften, others are
higher, and overall volume is "holding at very good levels."</p>
<p>John F. Walker, a company spokesman, said that if the
company can sustain its first-quarter performance, "we
certainly have room in terms of servicing the debt. We'd be
very comfortable at these levels."</p>
