	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- American Express Co. posted a loss of $619.8
million for the first quarter, the largest quarterly loss in
the company's 140-year history.
   American Express had a loss of $1.50 a share compared with
a profit of 59 cents a share, or $251.9 million, a year
earlier. Revenue in the quarter increased to $5.90 billion
from $5.87 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The loss, which resulted from American Express's
investment in Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., was expected.
Earlier in the week, Shearson reported a $915 million loss
for its first quarter. The loss by American Express for its
Shearson holdings amounted to $883 million, the company said.
American Express intends to acquire all outstanding Shearson
shares.</p>
<p>On the plus side, American Express's three other major
divisions reported record first quarters. Net income at
Travel Related Services rose 16% to $215 million, IDS
Financial Services earned $44 million, a gain of 21%, and
profits at Information Services Co. jumped 27% to $22
million.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
American Express shares closed at $27.625 a share, down
$1.25.</p>
<p>"You've got three Cadillacs at American Express in their
travel, financial planning and information processing
divisions, and it's a shame, to put it mildly, that Shearson
has been such a disappointment," said Gerald Lewinsohn, an
analyst with Merrill Lynch & Co. "American Express could have
exercised more control over Shearson management, but you have
to give them credit for doing a good job with their other
operations."</p>
<p>Mr. Lewinsohn said he would have preferred to have seen
stronger growth in the charge and credit card business at
TRS, but he noted that the economy has become sluggish. Cards
in use rose nearly 9.6% to 36 million, but analysts had
become accustomed to double-digit percentage gains.</p>
<p>"The important thing is that the charge volume was up 13%,
which is pretty good," Mr. Lewinsohn said. American Express
reported that world-wide charge volume grew to $26 billion
and that the number of service establishments that accept the
company's cards now tops three million, up 15%.</p>
<p>Richard Wallman, an analyst with Argus Research Corp.,
said that when the bad news about Shearson emerged, he
downgraded his recommendation on the company to a hold. "I'm
bullish long-term, but I want to wait a little longer before
changing my recommendation," he said. "They really wanted to
get rid of Shearson but couldn't find an agreeable buyer. Now
maybe they'll get it under control."</p>
<p>One analyst found the performance of the TRS division less
exciting than in the past. TRS is frequently described as the
crown jewel of American Express.</p>
<p>"We'd been seeing annual net income gains of 18%, and now
it's dropped to 15.7%," said Frank DeSantis Jr., an analyst
at PaineWebber Group Inc. "Relative to the last three years,
there has been a slowdown in the basic dynamics of the TRS
business. It is, however, consistent with the slowdown in the
general economy."</p>
<p>Mr. DeSantis said most businesses would be pleased to
report earnings increases of nearly 16%.</p>
<p>"If American Express just consisted of TRS, the value of
the stock would be a lot higher," said Mr. DeSantis. "The
thesis that American Express is worth more broken up has been
prevalent for a while and is right."</p>
<p>Mr. DeSantis added that he expects American Express to
issue stock in the second quarter to raise equity capital.
American Express has stated its intentions of raising $750
million, but it isn't known whether the company will do this
publicly, by private placement or through a combination of
the two.</p>
