	<p class="article-leader">In October, Bette Bao Lord received a cassette that a
Chinese friend had taped in August. Here are excerpts from
the transcript, found in Ms. Lord's new book, "Legacies: A
Chinese Mosaic" (Knopf):</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Once Chinese believed that building a socialist society
gave meaning to their lives. Now Chinese wonder why they were
born. We do not have the means to live life, nor do we even
have something to die for. We merely consume time.</p>
<p>At least five of our mutual friends are in Qing Cheng
prison, which is currently under the administration of the
martial law forces. The interrogators assigned there are not
from Beijing but have been transferred to the capital from
throughout the country, just as the soldiers were. W--- is in
another prison, which is worse than Qing Cheng, one normally
restricted to hardened criminals, not political offenders. In
this stifling hot weather, sixteen men live in a space of
fourteen square meters. . . .</p>
<p>Now more and more the bloody and bungled aftermath at the
Square reminds me of what happened in the Cultural
Revolution, when various factions, all claiming to be
supporters of the Chairman, warred among themselves without a
clue to Mao's intentions. I doubt if anyone -- the students
or their leaders; the cadres or Deng or Li or Zhao; the
soldiers or their commanders -- knew what was really going
on. Not before, not during and not after the massacre. The
confusion was total. And what's more, it was continually
being fueled by rumors -- conflicting rumors. Now that
confusion has been transferred to the masses. . . .</p>
<p>Many party committees that oversee factories, unions and
associations donated membership dues to the demonstrators or
submitted petitions on behalf of their organizations or even
carried banners in the parade. Now the Party must rely on
these same overseers to drum the official line into the
members of these units, and to investigate and rule on the
political reliability of those in their charge. It is a
farce.</p>
<p>Military officers have been giving speeches on the
Tiananmen Square incident at key work units. Their opening
line? "My division did not fire its guns at the people."</p>
<p>No one, be he a high cadre or a lowly comrade in the
street, accepts the official version. After two months of
thorough and nonstop indoctrination, the authorities have
succeeded only in making people parrot their lines at
compulsory political meetings, but they have not prevented
them from questioning their own government. Think of the
implications.</p>
<p>I find this condition -- when one has a self and one has
no self, when one thinks one's thoughts but speaks the
thoughts of others -- unbearable. Was it only last May when
we could say what we thought to those we trusted? Suddenly
Chinese are hypocrites again.</p>
<p>There is no sense of security here now. Everyone speaks
lies. Everyone is at the mercy of reports. Everyone thinks
his telephone is bugged.</p>
<p>That is why I find my own behavior puzzling when I talk to
you. Each time I vow to censor myself, each time I forget,
and each time when I hang up, I regret what I have said. Here
am I, someone framed by telephone calls during the Cultural
Revolution, repeating mistakes I paid for dearly. . . .</p>
<p>Why was it that when you were here I could talk to you so
freely? Because you gave me a sense of security. No one gives
me that sense anymore, not even my dear old friend H----, who
has always been so good to me. Now I am especially afraid of
seeing her. Now we are bound together. What happens if
tomorrow one of us is taken and questioned about the other?
Do we lie or tell the truth? If we tell lies, that can only
compound our insecurity. What if lies told by one indict the
other?</p>
<p>I am all too familiar with their interrogation methods.
They never ask you direct questions, or charge you with
specific deeds. They merely ask you to write what you did
each day and who was there with you. What can I write without
involving her? And it would be the same for her with respect
to me.</p>
<p>Mostly I stay home listening to classical music. Modern
music is too disturbing. I am always hoping to lose myself in
another time, but I never succeed. I long for a girl to be
with me, someone who knows nothing about me and has no
interest in any of my concerns. I want to talk to her only
about the trivial things that make up her life. I don't want
to talk about me.</p>
<p>I want to lose myself in nature, in grass, in mountains.
Last week I went to the Summer Palace at dawn and spent four
hours walking alone in that vast expanse. During that time I
was myself. I did not worry about whether there was a third
eye watching me. I did not worry about whether there was a
third ear listening to me. I did not worry about whether
momentarily someone would grab me for interrogation. . . .</p>
<p>I hope to receive your calls more often, but as the time
of our separation lengthens and our lives change in opposite
ways, can we still talk as easily and as profoundly as once
we did?</p>
<p>I wish you good books. I wish your parents excellent
health. I wish your husband happiness in his work. What else
can I wish?</p>
<p>You are of another world.</p>
