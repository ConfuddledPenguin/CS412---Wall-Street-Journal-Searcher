	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Sotheby's Holdings Inc., jittery after some
poorly received auctions in London earlier this month, is
pressing some sellers to scale down their expectations.
   The giant London-based auction house is asking sellers to
lower the "reserves," or the minimum prices they'll accept,
for artworks set to be offered during May's
multimillion-dollar auction season.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The lackluster results of Impressionist and Russian art
sales in London this month indicate that the torrid pace of
appreciation in many art-market prices "is slowing down,"
said Sotheby's President Michael Ainslie.</p>
<p>A last-minute request to sellers to lower reserves "is the
auctioneer's usual plaintive cry," Mr. Ainslie said. But
prices of Impressionist and modern paintings "have been
appreciating at a rate of 40% per year in the past two years,
and we think {the rate of appreciation is} very likely to
slow down," he said. "We're using the results from the April
sales to say: `You should be getting more realistic.'"</p>
<p>Getting sellers to lower their reserves is of particular
importance to Sotheby's this year. The company is risking its
own capital to guarantee prices on some of the most desirable
works -- effectively underwriting their sale and agreeing to
buy them itself if bidders don't push prices higher than the
guarantees.</p>
<p>Some sellers of art that Sotheby's hasn't guaranteed said
they'll balk if approached with a request to lower reserves.
And Sotheby's rival Christie's International PLC said it
disagrees with Sotheby's assessment -- at least so far.</p>
<p>"I'm not Pollyanna, and I'm not looking for a 90% sales
rate {at the May auctions}," said Michael Findlay, head of
the Impressionist and modern paintings department at
Christie's. "But it's too early to have those kinds of
conversations" with sellers.</p>
<p>Pre-sale interest on the part of Japanese collectors is at
least as strong as it's ever been, and the overall quality of
the works up for sale is far better than at the London sales,
Mr. Findlay contends. "You can't yet say the market has
changed drastically."</p>
<p>Christie's had good results at its evening London sales,
with only 21% of its Impressionist works -- by dollar value
-- failing to sell, and 1% of Russian avant-garde paintings
bought-in. Sotheby's evening London sales earlier this month
didn't fare so well, with 36% of the Impressionist works and
76% of its Russian art unsold. In recent years, buy-in rates
of under 25% -- sometimes well under -- have been common.</p>
<p>Mr. Ainslie has called the stabilization of prices
"healthy for the market." Some analysts even see a silver
lining to the problem auctions. "If people were a little
overaggressive in their reserves, reserves are correctable up
to the sale," said Harvey Katz, analyst at Salomon Brothers
Inc. "It's a self-correcting mechanism."</p>
<p>The morning after its disappointing London Impressionist
sale, Sotheby's stock fell $2 a share on the New York Stock
Exchange, although it recovered later in the session to close
down $1.25, at $21.375. The stock has continued to hover at
that level, closing yesterday at $21.625, up 12.5 cents.</p>
<p>"It wasn't the market that crashed, it was a few sales,"
that featured mediocre merchandise, said art dealer David
Killen. For high-quality art -- such as the Vincent van Gogh
and Pierre-Auguste Renoir masterpieces each auction house
plans to sell next month -- "there's still enough money to
buy the moon."</p>
