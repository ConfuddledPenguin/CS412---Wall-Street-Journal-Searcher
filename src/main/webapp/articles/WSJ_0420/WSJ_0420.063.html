	<p class="article-leader">American Brands Inc. and UST Inc. both reported strong
earnings for the first quarter, bolstered in part by gains
from tobacco operations.
   American Brands' net income rose 13% to $195.4 million, or
$2 a share, from $172.2 million, or $1.80 a share, a year
earlier. Revenue edged down to $3.2 billion from $3.25
billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The consumer products and insurance company said lower
exchange rates for foreign currencies, especially the British
pound, cut revenue by $116 million and net income by $6
million. Earnings were also adversely affected by the absence
of Southland Life, an insurance company sold in March 1989.</p>
<p>Operating profit from American Brands' core tobacco
business rose 8% to $281 million on record revenue, driven by
strong unit sales and expanding profit overseas. Unit sales
in the U.S. dropped 9%, but price increases helped boost
profit 3%. The company makes such cigarette brands as
Carlton, Lucky Strike and Pall Mall.</p>
<p>The company, based in Old Greenwich, Conn., said interest
expense dropped 31%, as strong cash flow allowed the company
to reduce borrowing.</p>
<p>American Brands' U.S. tobacco volume was weaker than the
industry trend, said Marc Cohen, an analyst with Sanford C.
Bernstein & Co., but the company as a whole had an
above-average quarter.</p>
<p>At UST, the U.S.'s leading marketer of moist, smokeless
tobacco, earnings jumped 20% to $52.6 million, or 46 cents a
share, from $44 million, or 38 cents a share, a year earlier.
Sales grew 11% to $175.3 million from $157.6 million.</p>
<p>Domestic unit volume of the Greenwich, Conn., company's
smokeless tobacco products, including the Copenhagen and
Skoal brands, rose 6.6%. "That's definitely above the
industry trend," said Rebecca Barfield, an analyst with First
Boston Corp.</p>
<p>UST's earnings included a pretax gain of $3 million, or
two cents a share, from the early termination of a licensing
accord for the distribution of pipe tobacco.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
American Brands closed at $64.75, off $1.50, and UST closed
at $26.875, down $1.125.</p>
