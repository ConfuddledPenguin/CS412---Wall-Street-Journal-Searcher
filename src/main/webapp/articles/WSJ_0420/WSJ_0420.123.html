	<p class="article-leader">Auto dealer Mark Medeiros worries that customers at his
Dartmouth, Mass., car lot may stage a mini-rebellion at
paying $100 to perhaps $600 more for a new car in a decade
because of new air-pollution equipment.
   Still, he is willing to face such buyer resistance if it
means cleaner air. "Environmental protection has been moving
too slowly," he says, "much slower than the pace at which
we've been polluting the planet."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As major new clean-air legislation makes its way through
Congress, Americans are increasingly being asked to make
sacrifices in the name of the environment. And according to a
new nationwide Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, a majority,
like Mr. Medeiros, say they are by and large willing to make
those tough tradeoffs in order to have a cleaner world. The
reason is that as Sunday's 20th anniversary of Earth Day
nears, people are far more likely to be worrying than
celebrating.</p>
<p>The survey, covering 1,001 respondents, indicates that a
full two-thirds of registered voters think the environment is
in worse shape today than it was 20 years ago. By an even
more overwhelming ratio of six to one, voters say they want
to protect the environment even if it means they will have to
pay higher prices. That is a sea change from 1981, when the
ratio was only five to four.</p>
<p>"Americans are playing for keeps when it comes to the
environment," say pollsters Peter Hart and Robert Teeter, who
conducted the sampling for the Journal and NBC. "Every
indicator in this survey suggests that voters care about the
environment, that they are personally making efforts to
protect the environment and that they are willing to change
their behavior and purchasing habits in order to ensure that
we have a cleaner world."</p>
<p>More than eight of 10, for instance, say they are willing
to separate their trash for recycling, give up plastic
fast-food containers and superfluous packaging to reduce
waste, and get their cars inspected and tuned up yearly to
cut tailpipe emissions. By three to one, voters say they
would favor a ban on disposable diapers.</p>
<p>In addition, 68% would be willing to pay up to $600 more
for a less-polluting car; 57% favor stricter air-pollution
requirements even if these added $10 a month to their
electricity bill; 57% also would favor requiring urban
commuters to ride public transportation to work once a week;
and just over half, 51%, would be willing to see limits
placed on the number of large cars that could be produced.</p>
<p>Robert Cashon, a 56-year-old retired engineer in
Huntsville, Ala., is disturbed by the television images of
severe air pollution in Eastern Europe and worries that the
world faces a "slow death" from pollution. He suggests
Americans should make sacrifices so the U.S. can serve as a
model for other polluting nations. "I think business people
have done a lot to really abuse and rape the land from way
back," he says. "The bottom line is all they know."</p>
<p>Adds Cindy Pittman, a 32-year-old office clerk in Kent,
Wash.: "I just figure I'm pretty young now and I've got a
long way to go. I want to protect it for myself and my kids."</p>
<p>Of course, people might have second thoughts about some of
the tradeoffs if actually faced with the prospect of having
to make them. For instance, the poll found that even 56% of
those with children under age three favor a ban on disposable
diapers, a figure that might drop significantly if this
became a real possibility.</p>
<p>Along the same lines, Gene Manzone isn't sure customers
appreciate the new pollution equipment he has already
installed at his New Bedford, Mass., service station,
including new pump nozzles that catch gasoline fumes. "I can
tell them prices are going up to help clean the air that they
breathe, and they'll go down the street to save three cents a
gallon," he says.</p>
<p>Yet the poll findings are important in showing how people
view the issue. "They indicate how strongly people would like
to believe they are part of the move to improve the
environment," say Mr. Hart, a Democrat, and Mr. Teeter, a
Republican. The environment has seemingly transcended
political debate; it has almost become socially unacceptable
not to be concerned about it. When voters are asked to rate
the importance of environmental protection on a 10-point
scale, 72% give it an 8, 9 or 10.</p>
<p>There are limits to people's good environmental
intentions. The Journal/NBC poll shows that 59% oppose
closing polluting factories if that would put people out of
work, while voters are evenly split over a 20-cent-a-gallon
increase for cleaner-burning fuel, a prospect that could be a
reality for the nine smoggiest U.S. cities under the
clean-air bill passed by the Senate.</p>
<p>By far the most difficult tradeoff, in the poll as in
people's lives, is the one between pollution and jobs. The
Senate legislation would force industry to spend, by one
estimate, up to $21.5 billion a year by the year 2005 to
clean up the atmosphere, and it would almost certainly cost
thousands of jobs in coal mines and possibly factories.</p>
<p>Though the bill isn't even law yet, it has already claimed
its first victims. About 45 miners of high-sulfur coal at
Pittsburg-Midway Coal Mining Co. in economically depressed
southeast Kansas are out of a job; the mine closed when its
only customer, a utility based in Joplin, Mo., took early
steps to reduce emissions blamed for acid rain and switched
in December to cleaner-burning Wyoming coal. "Plenty of coal
remains, but we have no market for it," says Fred Meurer,
spokesman for the Kansas coal company.</p>
<p>While voters in the Journal/NBC poll are worried about job
losses because of new environmental regulation, six in 10 of
them think it not very likely or not at all likely that their
own job will be either directly or indirectly affected; about
one-third think it very or somewhat likely that they will be
affected.</p>
<p>The tradeoffs go well beyond job losses. For instance,
Congress is considering a ban on methyl chloroform by the
year 2000 because the widely used solvent is damaging the
atmosphere's protective ozone layer. But there's currently no
good replacement that is as safe for workers and will perform
as well in some applications. One such use is cleaning the
ends of wire rope used in bridges, on cranes -- and to catch
jets landing on aircraft carriers. "It's extremely important
that {the cable} be perfectly clean" to allow a solid weld in
a socket, says Mike Catino, vice president of engineering at
Paulsen Wire Rope Corp. in Sunbury, Pa. If a cable pulled out
of a socket on a carrier, he says, "you would drop a $30
million aircraft into the ocean."</p>
<p>In Ashland, Ky., the choice may come down to healthier air
or competitiveness. Clean-air legislation threatens to wipe
out the pricing edge gained by an Armco Steel Co. plant when
it inaugurated a new $60 million thick-slab caster last
month. Considered the salvation of the aging mill, the caster
is expected to cut slightly more than $20 a ton off the cost
of making steel at Ashland. But tough new pollution-control
measures being proposed for coke ovens could add back that
$20 a ton.</p>
<p>There will be ripple effects as well. To pay for reducing
emissions blamed for acid rain, for instance, Associated
Electric Cooperative Inc. in Springfield, Mo., expects to
raise its electricity rates as much as 20%. The co-op's
biggest industrial customer, a Noranda Aluminum Inc. plant in
New Madrid, Mo., says that because of market pressures it
will have to swallow the extra $15.5 million a year itself.
And that could cut the annual profit-sharing check that Rick
Miller, a 37-year-old smelter employee, has come to count on.</p>
<p>For unionized plant workers, the check can mean a bonus of
$8,000 on top of wages of $24,000 to $28,000. "My profit
sharing went into CDs for college for my children," frets Mr.
Miller, who has three teen-agers. Moreover, "if the company's
profit dropped, it's gonna make it tougher to get a raise out
of them" in the next contract negotiations.</p>
<p>The poll found that no single environmental issue
dominates the debate. Toxic waste, air and water pollution
and garbage were the ones most often cited. But in Medford,
Ore., for instance, the issue of whether new clean-air rules
will require sharply higher emissions fees from local
industry pales before concern over whether the federal
government will designate the northern spotted owl as a
threatened species. That could put large tracts of federal
timber off-limits to loggers.</p>
<p>"If there's no timber to cut, we're not going to have to
worry about additional fees," says Larry Gill, an engineer at
Medford Corp., which makes plywood and veneer.</p>
<p>The Journal/NBC poll found that many voters haven't yet
focused on the clean-air legislation and the tradeoffs it
will require; only about four in 10 voters have heard or read
about the bill so far. Yet the intensity of environmental
feeling is such that there's little evidence more attention
to the bill will make them change their minds. In fact, of
those who do know about the bill, 40% think it doesn't go far
enough, while 33% think it has about the right balance and
only 6% think it goes too far.</p>
<p>While the poll found that 45% believe the quality of air
in their communities is about the same as it was 20 years
ago, three times more people think it has gotten worse than
think it has gotten better. In terms of overall environmental
protection, 45% feel the U.S. is doing better than most other
major countries, 37% say about the same and 13% think the
U.S. is worse.</p>
<p>People don't view the environmental issue in very partisan
terms. Democrats have an edge of just 22% to 14% as the party
people think handles the environment better; nearly half of
those polled see the two parties as the same on the issue. In
contrast to their high regard for President Bush in other
areas, voters approve of his environmental record by only 49%
to 41%, which may reflect more on their worry about the
problem than on concerns about specific Bush actions or
policies.</p>
<p>Another mark of how seriously people view the environment
is their report in the poll of how their concerns are
changing their daily lives and consuming habits. Seventy-six
percent say they have changed the kinds of products they buy
and use because of environmental concerns. By large
majorities, they say they already recycle their newspapers,
bottles and aluminum cans, and conserve water, electricity
and natural gas at home. But as for taking car pools or
public transportation to reduce driving, more don't than do.</p>
<p>One who has adapted his life more than most to live in
better harmony with the environment is Pat Stone, 40, a
former assistant editor at Mother Earth News magazine. He
spent money to equip his home in rural Fairview, N.C., with
solar panels, extra insulation and special windows to
conserve energy. He grows organic vegetables for the family
dinner table and raised four children in cloth diapers.</p>
<p>Yet there was one tradeoff even he couldn't make. To
accommodate his large family, he drives a gas-guzzling 1983
Buick station wagon that he bought used for $3,000 because he
couldn't afford a new model with gas mileage possibly twice
as good.</p>
<p>"You can't lead an environmentally pure life in this
world," he says. "The only way to act is to do what you can."</p>
