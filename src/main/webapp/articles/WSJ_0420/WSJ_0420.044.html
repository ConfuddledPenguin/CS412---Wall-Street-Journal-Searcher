	<p class="article-leader">When in Europe, Firms
   Want the `Euro-Exec'</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>THE HOTTEST international executive may not be found on
American shores. According to a report by recruiter Saxton
Bampfylde International, demand is exploding for the
Euro-Executive, a rare hybrid who commands a premium for
running pan-Europe operations.</p>
<p>Ideally, the Euro-Exec comes from a smaller country, such
as Holland, has a mixed background, early exposure to other
cultures, "and a flexible cast of mind." The London firm's
report cites a half-Irish half-French ad man married to an
American, living in Brussels who speaks three languages and
has worked as a manufacturing salesman and an organizer of
Paris social events.</p>
<p>But most fall short of the ideal. Among them: the
Euro-Yuppie, who has a pan-European identity but lacks
experience, and the Senior Statesman, who hails from a
multinational, often American. He is "almost always too . . .
corporate," the report warns, "his view of the world . . .
colored by being -- at its extreme -- an IBMer."</p>
<p>Americans do have one plus, says Anthony Saxton of Saxton
Bampfylde: Their 50-states background gives them a grasp of
the Europe-without-borders idea.</p>
<p>U.S. executives may have the most trouble filling slots in
East Europe, where Western Europeans have an edge. More of
them speak East European languages and have done business
there, notes Scott Scanlon, co-editor of Executive Search
Review.</p>
<p>Moreover, there's some "prejudice towards {U.S.}
executives, who can be perceived as trying to export a `hire
and fire' mentality," says Paul R. Ray Jr., a recruiter with
offices in Texas and Belgium. Eagerness for Western ways, he
adds, doesn't equal desire for the American Way.</p>
<p>The Invisible Barrier</p>
<p>Is Crystal Clear to Many</p>
<p>THE "GLASS CEILING" for women executives may be hard to
break through because it's still heavily glazed with
stereotypes.</p>
<p>In a survey by Catalyst, a New York group that promotes
women's careers, 79% of Fortune 500 chief executive officers
admitted there are "identifiable barriers" to women getting
to the top, and 81% blamed "stereotyping and preconceptions."</p>
<p>They didn't say their own companies were culprits. But
they did have ideas on what women could do. Women should
"have patience to wait for the appropriate opportunity,
rather than forcing the issue," one said. Another suggested
"commitment to success of the organization, not the feminist
cause." Others want women to eliminate the "feminist chip" on
their shoulders, "traditional female actions," and "any
insecurities."</p>
<p>Anecdotal evidence suggests that losing the "feminist
chip" isn't easy in the face of stereotypes. Henry Kravis of
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, for instance, provoked loud hisses
with an offhand comment at a Financial Women's Association
meeting in New York in March. Mr. Kravis spoke about his
business of buy-outs, but only after suggesting that his
largely female audience might have been happier hearing from
his wife, fashion designer Carolyn Roehm, about her business.</p>
<p>Group members are still debating whether his remark was an
ill-fated attempt at self-deprecation, or revealed
deprecating ideas about women. Some also wonder why all five
partners and 14 associates at KKR are men. Mr. Kravis
declined to address either question.</p>
<p>Is It Fair to Tailor</p>
<p>Perks Just for Women?</p>
<p>THE PROBLEM with talented women in business is keeping
them on board, says Stephen Garrison, chairman of Ward Howell
International, a search firm. But his suggestion to correct
the problem may strike the wrong chord with some: He
recommends that employers "discriminate" in favor of women.</p>
<p>One brainstorm: a clothing allowance for female execs.
"It's fiction" that men and women have similar expenses for
office work and obligatory social functions, he maintains. "I
wear the same suit four days in a row," he says. A loan of
$400 or so a year could be "paid back" with years on the job,
he suggests.</p>
<p>Similarly, a "hassle bonus" could be compounded annually
for women between 35 and 45 -- when they're most likely to
leave for family reasons or a competing job. The money could
vest at 45.</p>
<p>How would men react? "At first a little griping. But it
will go away," he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Garrison may get as much grief from would-be
beneficiaries. A New York bank executive who attended a
meeting where Mr. Garrison proselytized says the idea would
work only "in a perfect world." No question that women have a
rougher deal, she says, but they won't be credible if they
can't say, "I ran the race, fair and square, with no help."</p>
<p>How a CEO Expresses</p>
<p>His Devotion to Quality</p>
<p>IN THE ESCALATING war for a quality reputation, it's no
longer enough to appoint a quality team or hire a quality
czar. American Express's chairman and CEO, James D. Robinson
III, had his directors change company bylaws to give him a
third title: Chief Quality Officer.</p>
<p>Mr. Robinson, who lately has juggled problems with his
troubled Shearson unit and top executive resignations,
announced the change to employees in a holiday greeting card
sent late last year. More publicly, in the company's new
annual report, he signs his name over the title. The bylaws
didn't really have to be changed, says a spokesman, but the
message was important.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait for the final measure of Mr. Robinson's
vow. In speeches these days, he says he wants "to have
`quality' engraved on my tombstone."</p>
