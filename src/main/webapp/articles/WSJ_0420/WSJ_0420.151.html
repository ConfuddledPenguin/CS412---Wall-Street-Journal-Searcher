	<p class="article-leader">Robert Bosch G.m.b.H. will donate $15 million to Carnegie
Mellon University, Pittsburgh, to create a new management
institute for the study of international business issues.
   The Carnegie Bosch Institute for Applied Studies in
International Management will be affiliated with Carnegie
Mellon's business school. CMU President Richard M. Cyert will
become president of the institute following his retirement
June 30 from his current position.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Though the institute's research agenda and budget have yet
to be determined, former Bosch Chairman Hans L. Merkle cited
several areas that he believes merit investigation. They
include the management of technology and the proper autonomy
of operating divisions in large global corporations.</p>
<p>"There's a deficit of world-wide thinking among
businesses. That's why we're engaging in this," he said.
Bosch, the world's largest independent supplier of auto
parts, is based in Stuttgart, West Germany.</p>
