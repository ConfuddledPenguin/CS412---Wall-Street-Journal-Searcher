supplies.
   Soviet leader Gorbachev increased pressure on the Baltic
republic by reducing deliveries of natural gas by about 80%.
The move followed Wednesday's cutoff of oil. The Kremlin said
it imposed the sanctions because Lithuania failed to give a
"constructive response" to demands to rescind
independence-related laws. Officials in Vilnius called on
Lithuanians to use energy supplies "most thriftily." In
Moscow, Gorbachev offered Latvia "special status" within the
Soviet Union if it refrained from secessionist moves.</p>

hostage by today. The latest statement was accompanied by a
