	<p class="article-leader">NEW DELHI (AP) -- Arms reduction may be the order of the
day for the superpowers, but India's drive to become the next
military giant has scuttled hopes of a "peace dividend" in
economically strapped south Asia.
   India's neighbors, especially Pakistan, are following its
lead in the buildup. Western military analysts and Indian
intellectuals fear another chapter of an expensive regional
arms race is about to begin.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While the Soviet Union withdraws troops from Eastern
Europe and the U.S. plans defense cuts, India's defense
budget for 1990 is more than 10% above last year.</p>
<p>Between 1985 and 1989, India bought more weapons -- $17.3
billion worth -- than any country in the world.</p>
<p>In response, Pakistan's President Ghulam Ishaq Khan vowed
to continue stockpiling advanced weapons. Pakistan already
allocates 52% of its $6.8 billion federal budget for defense.</p>
<p>China recently announced a defense spending increase of
15.2% over 1989.</p>
<p>"There will be no peace dividend in south Asia," said Ian
Anthony, an expert on the Indian military at the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute in Sweden. "India
thinks a strong military will give it international prestige.
I think they've got it wrong."</p>
<p>Mr. Anthony and other Western military analysts say India
is the engine driving the arms buildup in the region. More
important than recent tensions with Pakistan, they say, is
India's desire to achieve military might.</p>
<p>"India already has enough troops to smother Pakistan in a
protracted war," said a Western military official in New
Delhi. "They have their sights on longterm military role."</p>
<p>Western economists and Indian intellectuals say the
buildup is harming India's economy and the economies of the
region's other developing countries.</p>
<p>India already has fallen behind in the world's economic
race.</p>
<p>Pakistan has the highest per capita gross national product
in the region, only $350 a year, and a host of domestic
problems that include a burgeoning drug trade and ethnic
violence.</p>
<p>Bangladesh and Nepal, two of the poorest countries in the
world, spend large amounts of their foreign exchange on
weapons.</p>
<p>Some say India is seeking entry into the mighty club for
reasons of pride.</p>
<p>"Weaklings are not honored. We want to be strong," A.P.J.
Abdul Kalam, father of India's first intermediate-range
ballistic missile, said soon after the rocket's test firing
last May.</p>
<p>Others feel India wants to assume the role its former
colonial masters, the British, once played in south Asia.
India isn't seeking to colonize the region, they say, but it
wants to be viewed as the protector of its smaller neighbors.</p>
<p>"The British dominated the subcontinent. They guaranteed
its security," said Giri Deshingkar, director of the Center
for the Study of Developing Societies. "India's military
wants to do the same."</p>
<p>The fall of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi late last year led
development experts to hope that the defense budget, which
has jumped 400% in a decade, might be cut.</p>
<p>But troubles with Pakistan strengthened the military
lobby, experts said, and hopes that Prime Minister V.P.
Singh's government would channel more money to education and
health soon evaporated.</p>
<p>On March 19, the new government announced a 10.5% rise in
defense spending to $9.3 billion. The bulk of the increase
went for arms purchases.</p>
<p>In a speech late last month, India's chief of naval staff,
Adm. J.G. Nadkarni, argued that military might, not economic
development, was the key to power.</p>
<p>"There are few things that India can do that can get this
country greater leverage with the great powers than interfere
with their plans," Mr. Nadkarni said.</p>
<p>The mere capability to interfere with superpower movement
in international waters, the admiral said, would cause them
to think twice before crossing India diplomatically.</p>
<p>"It's basic gunboat diplomacy," said one Western military
officer. "We don't think it will work."</p>
