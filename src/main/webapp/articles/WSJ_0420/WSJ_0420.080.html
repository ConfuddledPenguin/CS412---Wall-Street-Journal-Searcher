	<p class="article-leader">MANAMA, Bahrain -- The total assets of Bahrain's offshore
banking units, or OBUs, rose 7% to $72.58 billion at the end
of December from $68.12 billion a year earlier, the Bahrain
Monetary Agency said.
   The assets of the island's OBUs have risen gradually from
a low in 1986, when the sector held total assets of $55.68
billion. After expanding rapidly in the late 1970s and early
1980s, Bahrain's offshore banking sector was hurt by the
effects on regional economies of the sharp drop in oil prices
during the mid-1980s.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Of the December 1989 assets, $29.96 billion, or 41%, were
held in Arab countries last December, and $14.27 billion, or
20%, were held in Western Europe. Only $7.87 billion, or 11%,
were held in North America.</p>
<p>On the funding side, $45 billion in liabilities, or 62% of
the total, were held in Arab countries. The banks had
liabilities of $12.72 billion, or 18%, with Western Europe,
and $5.75 billion, or 8%, with North America.</p>
