	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- After a disappointing Easter travel weekend,
debt-laden Greyhound Lines Inc. continues its struggle to
expand its service network and attract enough riders to shore
up its strike-battered balance sheet.
   Just before Easter, the unit of GLI Holding Co. added
several hundred new replacement drivers, restored service to
286 locations and offered customers in some cities free
tickets if their buses arrived late. But with violence
continuing to flare up in the strike by 9,300 members of the
Amalgamated Transit Union, Greyhound only attracted about 44%
the number of riders it did for Easter weekend a year ago.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I feel that our ridership is very high," said Greyhound
spokeswoman Elizabeth Hale, who said ridership had been
hovering between 50% and 60% of pre-strike levels in the days
immediately preceding the holiday. She attributed the lower
percentage over the Easter weekend itself mainly to the fact
that in 1989, Easter coincided with spring break for many
college students.</p>
<p>But analysts who follow the closely held company's
publicly traded bonds say Greyhound has yet to maintain the
levels of ridership and revenue that it needs to break even.
"The company has said they need to be at about 70%-plus level
to break even," said Charles Mancuso, senior analyst for
Moody's Investors Service Inc. "The question becomes how long
can they go if they don't achieve that level."</p>
<p>In a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing,
Greyhound acknowledged that a prolonged strike could
seriously impair its financial future. Since the strike began
March 2, the company has continued to restore scheduled
service and add replacement drivers in the face of strike
violence.</p>
<p>The company said that, as of last Tuesday, it was running
about 72% of its prestrike schedules with 2,903 drivers --
2,393 of them new hires.</p>
<p>But even if the company succeeds in spite of the strike,
some analysts say they are concerned about the long-term
impact of negative publicity surrounding the recent violence,
the additional debt taken on because of the strike and the
problems in rejuvenating Greyhound's charter and package
express businesses, both badly battered by the walkout.</p>
<p>"They seem to be winning the strike," says Leigh Walzer,
an analyst with R.D. Smith and Co. "The question now is how
strong will the company be going forward."</p>
