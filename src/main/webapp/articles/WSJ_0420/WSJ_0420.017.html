	<p class="article-leader">Schering-Plough Corp. reported a 20% rise in first-quarter
earnings while another health-care company, Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co., posted a 19% increase.
   Schering-Plough, bolstered by its world-wide
pharmaceutical business, said net income rose to $150.4
million, or $1.33 a share, from $125.7 million, or $1.12 a
share. Sales rose to $865.1 million from $831.8 million, a 4%
increase; without currency fluctuations, sales would have
increased 8%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Pharmaceutical business sales rose 14% excluding currency
fluctuations and last year's sale of a majority interest in a
Brazilian affiliate. Strong results from U.S. prescription
products and the international pharmaceutical business were
partially offset by lower sales of the Wesley-Jessen vision
care business.</p>
<p>U.S. sales of prescription pharmaceuticals rose 19% in the
quarter. International sales would have risen 15% without
currency fluctuations and divestitures.</p>
<p>Schering-Plough Health-Care Products had a 5% sales
decline for the quarter, reflecting trade inventory
adjustments for foot-care and sun-care products, and a weak
cold season that affected sales of cough-cold products.</p>
<p>Robert P. Luciano, chairman and chief executive,
reiterated his estimate that 1990 earnings per share would be
18% to 20% higher than in 1989, when the company had net
income of $471.3 million, or $4.18 a share, on $3.16 billion
in sales.</p>
<p>Bristol-Myers Squibb said it had record sales and earnings
for the first quarter. Net income rose to $409.1 million, or
78 cents a share, from $343.6 million, or 66 cents a share.
Sales rose 8.5% to $2.46 billion from $2.26 billion.</p>
<p>The company said domestic sales rose 6% while
international sales rose 13%; currency fluctuations reduced
sales by less than 1%.</p>
<p>Separately, Bristol-Myers said it agreed to sell Genetic
Systems Corp., a marketer of diagnostic kits for infectious
diseases, to Sanofi S.A., a French pharmaceutical company,
for an undisclosed sum. Genetic Systems has annual revenue of
about $10 million. Sanofi is majority owned by Societe
Nationale Elf Aquitaine of France.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading,
Schering-Plough closed at $80.875, down $1.125, while
Bristol-Myers closed at $53.375, down 75 cents.</p>
