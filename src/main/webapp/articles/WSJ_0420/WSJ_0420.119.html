	<p class="article-leader">CALABASAS, Calif. -- Lockheed Corp., with improved
performances from its technological services and aeronautical
systems segments, said first-quarter profit increased 11% on
an 8% sales climb.
   Perhaps most importantly, the nation's No. 6 Pentagon
contractor had no writedowns for the first three months of
1990, marking the first time in a year that the aerospace
concern hasn't been plagued by cost overruns on one project
or another.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But it may take some doing to keep the slate clean from
here on out. Lockheed is now locked in negotiations with the
Navy over terms of production on the P-7 anti-submarine
aircraft. And if the government were bent on holding the
company to pricing commitments it made earlier, it could
"drag the whole corporation down the tubes," said Michael
Beltramo, a Los Angeles defense industry consultant.</p>
<p>Even a relatively small write-down on the P-7 would be a
blow to Lockheed's chairman, Daniel Tellep, who repeatedly
trumpeted during the company's recent proxy fight with Dallas
billionaire Harold Simmons that he had finally put such cost
overruns behind the company.</p>
<p>For the first quarter, Lockheed earned $69 million, or
$1.09 a share, vs. $62 million, or $1.04 a share. The
year-earlier results included $4 million in losses at the
company's information services businesses, which have since
been sold. Sales jumped to $2.25 billion from $2.09 billion.</p>
<p>Across the company, profits tripled to $15 million from an
anemic $5 million at the aeronautical systems unit, and rose
to $13 million from $9 million in the technological services
area. Lockheed said it also benefited from a lower income-tax
rate.</p>
<p>Those gains were partially offset, however, by a 5% drop
in profits at the company's missiles and space unit; the cost
of the proxy contest with Mr. Simmons's company, NL
Industries Inc., which ran to about $15 million; and a 90%
plunge in earnings to $1 million from $10 million in the
electronics segment, where the revenue base shrunk
significantly.</p>
<p>But it's the potential for much bigger problems at
Lockheed that has the industry alarmed right now. The company
already has written off $300 million for the development of
the P-7 because its engineers miscalculated how much the
plane had in common with Lockheed's old submarine hunter, the
P-3.</p>
<p>When it signed the development pact, Lockheed also
apparently gave certain target projections for costs of
production. Now, with the program having slipped two years
behind schedule, it has become clear that there is no way it
can stick to those numbers. Some trade publications have even
speculated that if the Navy were to exercise its options and
press Lockheed, the company could stand to lose nearly $3
billion from the 125-plane accord.</p>
<p>That doesn't seem likely to happen though. Since the
beginning of the year, Mr. Tellep has met several times with
Navy Secretary Lawrence Garrett to work out a compromise on
the P-7. Service officials close to the secretary suggested
that the two sides are trying to determine how much it really
will cost at this point to manufacture P-7s, how many can be
afforded in a tighter budget environment and who would absorb
what costs.</p>
<p>Whatever the Navy decides to do, Mr. Tellep has made it
clear to Wall Street analysts that Lockheed isn't going to
build P-7s at a deficit. He even indicated that the Navy
could ultimately decide just to terminate the contract,
letting Lockheed off the hook. It's unclear what would happen
if the company were to unilaterally default.</p>
<p>Mr. Tellep has declined to be interviewed about the P-7
for the past few weeks.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Lockheed shares closed at $35.875, down 75 cents.</p>
<p>Separately, Lockheed responded to a federal court suit
filed eariler this week by Mr. Simmons that challenged the
legality and fairness of last month's director elections.
Lockheed, in a statement, called the action "nothing more
than pure harassment that will continue to divert management
attention and corporate resources."</p>
