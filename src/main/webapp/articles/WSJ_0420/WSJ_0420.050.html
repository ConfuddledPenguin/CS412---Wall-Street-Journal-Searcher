	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- It's enough to drive a company batty.
   Just as Warner Bros. Inc. was poised to open the smash
movie "Batman" in South Korea in June and flood the market
with caped crusader merchandise, its parent company Time
Warner Inc. discovered it had been beaten to the punch.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Kukje Corp., a Korean-based company, had already begun
producing and marketing a line of its Pro-Specs sneakers with
what Time Warner labeled an unauthorized Batman figure.
Batman, with his long cape flowing, adorned a Velcro strip,
something that outraged Time Warner unit DC Comics Inc.,
which has owned the copyright to "Batman" for over half a
century.</p>
<p>It took a prolonged legal battle and the intervention of
the U.S. trade representative's office and the South Korean
government to end the dispute. Time Warner said yesterday
that it reached a settlement under which Kukje agreed not to
use any of the Batman trademarks in the future. It also
agreed to pay 25 million won ($35,612) to Time Warner by
Saturday, which the media giant says it will donate to a
yet-to-be-determined Korean charity. Also, Kukje said it
would cease manufacturing the bootleg Batman sneakers,
although it will be allowed to sell its remaining inventory.</p>
<p>"What this shows is that even Batman needs and appreciates
the help of the U.S. trade representative," said Timothy A.
Boggs, vice president for public affairs at Time Warner in
Washington.</p>
<p>Mr. Boggs said Time Warner turned to Carla Hills, the U.S.
trade representative, after efforts to halt Kukje's sneakers
went unheeded.</p>
<p>The legal actions initiated against Kukje by Time Warner
would make even the Joker lose his smile. They included Time
Warner's request for assistance from the Korean Intellectual
Property Office to "cease the manufacture and sale of the
offending shoe," according to a Time Warner document
outlining the case. The company also enlisted the support of
the U.S. Embassy in Seoul.</p>
<p>Then, in March, Time Warner filed a criminal complaint in
Seoul against Kukje, alleging a violation of Korea's Unfair
Competition Prevention Act. "The U.S. government has been
interested in protecting U.S. copyrights abroad," said Mr.
Boggs. "They have been willing to go in and pound the table."</p>
<p>Ms. Hills's office said she was traveling and couldn't be
reached for comment. Sandy Christoff, assistant U.S. trade
representative for Asia and the Pacific, who assisted Ms.
Hills, was also out of the country and couldn't be reached.
Messages left with Kukje's headquarters in Seoul weren't
returned.</p>
