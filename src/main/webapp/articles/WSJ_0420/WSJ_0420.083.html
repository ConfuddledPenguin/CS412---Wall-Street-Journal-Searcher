	<p class="article-leader">MIAMI -- It was among the grandest of plans, conceived in
1983, amid the headiest of booms. The office-vacancy rate was
a comfortable 10%, and the plan -- to build a
700,000-square-foot office building overlooking Biscayne Bay
-- seemed a sure bet.
   So out of the ground rose Barnett Tower, 33 stories of
steel and glass, the handiwork of Lincoln Property Inc., a
Dallas developer, and Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. With an
average of 1,000 people moving to Florida every day and Miami
emerging as the business hub of Latin America, a first-class
skyscraper on Brickell Avenue -- Miami's Wall Street --
couldn't lose. Or so its builders thought.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Today, three years after Barnett Tower was completed, it
still sits 40% empty. Around it, in two dozen buildings
lining Brickell, "For Rent" signs hang on an additional one
million square feet of office space despite rental
concessions of 20% off listed rates. In all, nearly a quarter
of the avenue's five million square feet of space lie vacant,
with sharply higher vacancy rates among the seven office
towers built in the past five years.</p>
<p>"I don't think any prudent developer would have built any
of these buildings had we known then what we know now," says
Darryl Parmenter, a former managing partner of Lincoln who
now owns his own Miami real-estate firm. "We overbuilt."</p>
<p>The story is the same nearly everywhere in Florida.
Rampant overbuilding, sparked by a booming economy in the
early- and mid-1980s, has produced one of the softest
real-estate markets in the state's history. Need some office
space? Florida has 41 million square feet for rent -- a
three-year supply. Looking for a break on a lease? Developers
from Tampa to Miami, where office vacancy rates in some areas
hover close to 30%, will cut between 20% and 40% from listed
rents. Want to buy a little land in Palm Beach County?
Residential lots that sold for $70,000 in late 1988 now go
begging at $48,000.</p>
<p>Other states, of course, also are plagued by weak
real-estate markets. But real estate is more than just
another industry in Florida. It's what oil was to Texas: a
seemingly endless source of profit and pleasure for anyone
willing to put up some money. Office parks, and indeed whole
townships, stand as monuments to speculators made rich. Says
Clifton A. Poole Jr., a top federal bank regulator, "There's
just something about (Florida) that says, `Come on, and get a
piece of the action.'" Now, however, the action in Florida --
the nation's third-largest real-estate market, after
California and Texas -- is drying up.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, moreover, Florida's commercial-property
glut has come back to haunt one of the prime forces behind
its building boom: overzealous lenders. Since mid-March, some
of the state's biggest, most profitable banks, including
Barnett Banks Inc. and Southeast Banking Corp., have
increased their loan-loss reserves, slashed earnings
estimates and seen credit ratings reduced in the wake of
special regulatory examinations. The Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency, already stung by banking
disasters in the Southwest and New England, says the
examinations were prompted specifically by concern about
commercial real-estate loans.</p>
<p>Amid falling real-estate prices and rising worry about a
credit squeeze by wary lenders, developers and lenders across
the state are asking: Where's the bottom? Florida has often
stumbled in the past, most recently in the mid-1970s when
real-estate investment trusts fueled a building boom that
went bust. Since then, a combination of sun, sand and, more
recently, Mickey Mouse has warded off another debacle. But is
this the start of a full-fledged crash? Responses are mixed.</p>
<p>"We have to be careful not to confuse a minor adjustment
with a major correction," says Malcolm T. Murray, the chief
credit officer of First Union Corp., a Charlotte, N.C.,
bank-holding company with a $6 billion portfolio of loans on
commercial real estate in Florida. "Yes, the commercial
market is soft, but we're not in some kind of free fall."</p>
<p>Indeed, some economists say Florida's problems aren't as
dire as those in Texas, Arizona and Massachusetts. Donald
Ratajczak, the director of Georgia State University's
Economic Forecasting Center, notes that an expanding
manufacturing base and bustling tourism, anchored by Disney
World, are adding almost 150,000 jobs a year to the state's
tax rolls. "Those kinds of numbers can quell a lot of
concerns," he says.</p>
<p>What they can't seem to quell, however, are fears among
some developers and bankers that the staggering oversupply of
commercial and residential real estate has left the state
more vulnerable than at any time in the past decade to the
fallout from any nationwide recession. If Northeast and
Midwest "feeder" markets, the source of Florida's population
growth, weaken further, neither sun nor sand nor Mickey may
be able to avert a crash.</p>
<p>"The problem is likely worse than most people now think,"
says R. Thomas Powers, who directs economic research at
Goodkin Research Corp. in Fort Lauderdale.</p>
<p>Tampa's glut of commercial property typifies the problems
throughout Florida: The area is awash in office space because
lenders and builders, thinking the market would always bounce
back, continued to lend and build even as the demand for
space began to soften in 1987. Now, many of the financially
weaker buildings have been repossessed and additional
foreclosures are likely because no improvement is expected
for at least another year.</p>
<p>"We were gorging ourselves on new space in the 1980s,"
says George Bartlett, the first vice president of brokerage
services at Coldwell Banker in Tampa. "Nobody wanted to hear
`the market doesn't need that building now.'"</p>
<p>In Tampa's Westshore area, near the airport, the total
square footage of office space went from three million in
1982 with a 12% vacancy rate, to six million in 1985 with a
29% vacancy rate, to nine million today with a vacancy rate
of about 21%. With the market's ability to absorb the space
declining sharply in the past five years, construction in
Westshore has ground to a halt despite developers' blueprints
for some eight more office buildings -- nearly two million
square feet -- in the area. The reason for the "de facto"
moratorium: Large rental discounts to lure tenants make most
buildings unprofitable.</p>
<p>"Nobody will build a building with (today's) concessions
at 20% to 40% off listed rents," says Douglas Rothschild, a
commercial broker in Tampa. Effective annual rents, he says,
are in the $15-to-$17-a-square-foot range in Westshore, but
developers need rents of $18 to $19 to cover their costs.
"None of the buildings built since 1985 have realized what
developers expected," Mr. Rothschild says.</p>
<p>Consequently, four of the 17 buildings built in Westshore
in the past five years have been repossessed. In 1983, for
example, Patrick Morley paid the highest price ever for
Westshore land -- $32 a square foot, according to Mr.
Rothschild. Mr. Morley, who hasn't returned repeated phone
calls seeking comment, planned a three-building,
750,000-square-foot office complex called Tampa Commons,
midway between downtown Tampa and the airport.</p>
<p>But by the time the Orlando developer completed the first
of the three buildings two years later, vacancy rates had
soared, and he was forced to offer 30% to 40% concessions off
rents. Because he couldn't cover his loans with the
unexpectedly low revenue, Mellon Bank repossessed the
building, and Freedom Savings & Loan (now run by Resolution
Trust Corp., the federal agency set up to manage failed
thrifts) foreclosed on the remaining land. Building No. 1 of
the project still sits half-empty. Buildings No. 2 and No. 3
were never built. And because the first building was meant to
connect with the other structures through mezzanine walkways,
it has no main entrance on the street. Instead, its entrance
faces a condemned, one-story structure with graffiti on the
plywood covering its doors and windows.</p>
<p>The land for Buildings No. 2 and No. 3 is now for sale by
Resolution Trust at $22 a square foot, but Mr. Rothschild
says the real value is no more than $17 a square foot. Mr.
Morley "got involved in the overbuilt frenzy of Tampa and hit
the market totally wrong," Mr. Rothschild says. "Everybody
was trying to get into the pot."</p>
<p>Although concerns about commercial property are paramount,
200 miles to the south and east of Tampa, residential markets
are also being pummeled -- in none other than Palm Beach
County. In the 1980s, the affluent county caught fire when
hordes of Northeasterners in their 40s and 50s moved South
after selling homes and businesses whose values had
skyrocketed. Now, as the Northeast's economy cools off, that
pool of migrants is drying up. And many new Floridians want
to go home.</p>
<p>"They thought they could come down here and get a
part-time job and live the good life in the sun," says John
Spies, a Florida specialist at a Houston research firm,
American Metro-Study Corp. "It didn't work. A lot of people
overextended themselves to where their standard of living is
not as good as it was up North."</p>
<p>The statistics are ominous. North Palm Beach County has a
13- to 15-month supply of new single-family houses for sale,
up from a "normal" supply of about nine months, according to
Metro-Study. After a recent sell-off of better homes, the
southern part of the county now has about a 12-month supply,
but "the ones left will be very difficult to sell without
discounts of more than 20%," Mr. Spies says. The county also
has a 28-month supply of vacant lots ready for building, with
an additional 70-month supply plotted for development but
without roadways, sewer and water lines and other utilities
installed.</p>
<p>Two additional clouds hover over Florida: a possible
credit crunch and the potential sale of billions of dollars
of commercial property by Resolution Trust.</p>
<p>Publicly, banks deny planning to clamp down on lending.
Indeed, when Barnett Banks announced in March a $60 million
charge to earnings, Charles E. Rice, its chief executive,
said it "will continue to meet the credit needs of its
customers, including . . . real-estate lending."</p>
<p>Privately, however, some developers and bankers, citing
the increased scrutiny by federal regulators, say the spigot
has already been turned down. "To require more documentation
or collateral is almost like removing another layer of
borrowers," one banker says.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, failed thrifts have dumped about $5 billion of
commercial property into Resolution Trust. An additional $24
billion worth is likely to be seized in the next three years.
And the agency faces mounting pressure to unload property,
perhaps at fire-sale prices. Such a move, coupled with a
downturn in the national economy, could spell disaster for
Florida.</p>
<p>"Your gut instinct is to be careful and not use a
broad-brush approach about this situation," says Bert Ely, a
bank consultant in Alexandria, Va. "But with all that supply
out there, if we see a recession in the next six months, or
even a year, all bets are off."</p>
