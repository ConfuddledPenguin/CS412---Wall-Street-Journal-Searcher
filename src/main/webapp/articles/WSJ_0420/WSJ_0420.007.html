	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Chrysler Corp. said it expects to report
"overall a modest profit" for the first quarter of 1990.
   The projection came in an amended registration statement
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in
connection with a proposed offering of $800 million principal
amount of trust certificates due 2020.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Most industry analysts have been forecasting Chrysler
would break even for the quarter ended March 31. Earlier this
year, company officials hinted that the No. 3 U.S. auto maker
might do somewhat better than that.</p>
<p>Chrysler closed yesterday at $16.375, down 37.5 cents, in
composite New York Stock Exchange trading.</p>
<p>In the filing, Chrysler said it continued to be affected
in the first quarter "by the adverse operating environment
that existed during the second half of 1989, as the costs of
sales incentive programs continued to affect operating
results adversely. . . ."</p>
<p>Offsetting this were the earnings from its Chrysler
Financial Corp. subsidiary "and, to some extent, {savings
from} Chrysler's previously announced cost-reduction
efforts." The company has pledged to cut its overhead by $1.5
billion by year end.</p>
<p>In the first quarter of 1989, Chrysler reported earnings
from continuing operations of $338 million, or $1.44 a share,
on revenue of $9.95 billion. Chrysler didn't provide an
estimate in the SEC filing for revenue in the just-ended
first quarter.</p>
<p>Chrysler did note that its world-wide factory car and
truck sales during the first quarter were 493,612 units
compared with 530,799 units in the fourth quarter of 1989 and
671,560 units in the first quarter of 1989.</p>
<p>Chrysler estimated that its total share of the U.S. and
Canadian car and truck markets in the first quarter fell to
13.1% from 14.1% in the fourth quarter of 1989 and 14% for
the first quarter of 1989.</p>
