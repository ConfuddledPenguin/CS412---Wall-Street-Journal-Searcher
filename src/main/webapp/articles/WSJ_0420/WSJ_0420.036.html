	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- Despite sluggish consumer demand for many of
its cars, General Motors Corp. has quietly raised prices for
options that could increase the cost of some of its cars and
trucks by up to $100.
   GM's pricing action follows a similar move last month by
rival auto maker Ford Motor Co., and continues a pattern set
by GM and Ford last year of raising prices on optional
equipment early in the spring selling season. This year, Ford
raised the prices for options on most cars by an average of
$29. GM officials said they couldn't determine the average
increase that would result from its changes.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The price increases will help the No. 1 and No. 2 auto
makers boost revenues per car and bolster earnings in a weak
market. But they might also be a competitive liability.
Officials of Chrysler Corp., Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda
Motor Co. said their companies haven't increased prices since
the model year began last fall.</p>
<p>Unlike Ford, GM didn't officially announce its increase,
but quietly notified its dealers of the changes.</p>
<p>Dealer reaction ranged from frustration to resignation.
"We can't sell cars as it is," said Boston dealer Robert
Brest, who sells several GM lines. With most rebate programs
scheduled to end soon, Mr. Brest figures GM will do something
to stimulate showroom traffic. "They must have something up
their sleeves."</p>
<p>Other dealers said the increases won't make much
difference. "They may as well raise prices when they're not
selling cars," said a Pontiac dealer in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Both GM and Ford have been struggling to prop up sales in
recent weeks in the face of soft consumer demand. Sales of
all domestic and imported vehicles dropped 2.9% in March
despite heavy discounting by the Big Three and many foreign
car makers. GM's total vehicle sales dropped 1.3% in March,
while Ford's fell 6.1%.</p>
<p>A GM spokesman said yesterday the company raised the
option prices to recover higher costs for raw materials and
health care. "We believe that these are modest adjustments,"
a GM spokesman said, adding that the company considered what
the marketplace would bear before raising prices.</p>
<p>The changes will affect GM's most popular options, such as
cruise control, power door locks and power windows. Prices
for those items increased $15 apiece. Now the most expensive
power door lock system will cost $280, the most expensive
power window system will cost $325, and cruise control will
cost an average of $210.</p>
<p>GM didn't change prices on air conditioning. Before last
summer, the auto maker had discounted some of its options
when sold together as a group. But last summer the company
halted that practice in most of its divisions.</p>
<p>Price increases on power seats will range from $20 to $55.
GM also hit some of its pickup trucks with a $20 rise on
optional gasoline engines and a $10 increase on four-speed
automatic transmissions.</p>
<p>The changes apply to all of GM's auto divisions, but
Cadillac will be the least affected because many of the
options are standard on most of its luxury cars.</p>
<p>Because the price increases affect GM cars built after
April 2, consumers should pay less for cars built earlier in
the year that are still sitting on dealer lots.</p>
