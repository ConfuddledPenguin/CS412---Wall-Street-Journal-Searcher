	<p class="article-leader">L. Gordon Crovitz's March 7 Rule of Law column "Can
Takeover Targets Just Say No to Stockholders?" on the
Delaware court opinion regarding the "just say no" maneuver
to hostile bids highlights the tremendous confusion over the
principle of the time value of money. The Delaware court
maintains that board members are "not under any per se duty
to maximize shareholder value in the short term" and Time
Inc. directors "expressed their concern that their
stockholders would not comprehend the long-term benefits of
the Warner merger." Rubbish.
   The simple truth is that there is no such thing as a
distinction between long-term or short-term value. There is
only one value: present value; the present value of the
existing cash flow (the amount together with the risk of it
decreasing over time) and the present value of futures
estimates of cash flow (the amount together with the risk of
it being realized).</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Managements' job is to create wealth for their
shareholders as well as to communicate and sell their game
plan to the marketplace to evaluate its merits on a
continuing basis. If the stock price doesn't reflect the
value of what management ascribes to its investment plan, it
means that its current and prospective shareholders don't
concur with management, and the investment program should be
scrapped or revised. This is the market's disciplining
process, which ultimately holds management and directors
accountable to their employers (i.e. shareholders).
Conversely, if management is sacrificing lucrative long-term
investment alternatives to prop up "short-term" earnings, the
auction market for the stock will reflect this.</p>
<p>It is ironic and frightening that while most of the world
is moving toward less government control in market
transactions, our state courts and legislatures are suddenly
anxious to impose economic solutions on microevents that have
enormous wealth consequences not only for the individuals
involved but for society at large as well.</p>
<p>Mr. Crovitz is correct in suggesting that there is only
one fair, efficient and equitable way in which to handle
mergers, hostile bids, greenmail or whitemail or any matter
that seriously affects the company's stock value. Not the
courts, not the directors, and not the management, but the
owners should decide vis-a-vis a shareholders' referendum as
a basic exercise of fundamental property rights.</p>

<p>Mr. Crovitz was right on target about an illness that
pervades business today and, by extension, the U.S. economy.
With few exceptions, major corporations' boards are dominated
by a self-elected elite -- the management of the companies
they pretend to run in the interests of the shareholders.</p>
<p>It is not surprising then that these boards continue to
make decisions, such as Time Warner's decision to reject the
Paramount tender offer, that demonstrably serve only the
interests of management. The amazing thing is that the
courts, as in the Delaware decision, continue to aid and abet
management.</p>
<p>The loss of property value illustrated by the fall of Time
Warner's stock price after it rejected Paramount's bid could
be mirrored many times on the other side of such transactions
by showing the loss in stock values suffered by shareholders
of acquiring companies whose boards authorize the payment of
ridiculously high premiums (and ridiculously high fees) for
companies they acquire. In either case, does anyone think the
shareholders concerned would vote in favor of their board's
action if given the chance? In effect shareholders are being
robbed of their most fundamental right -- the right to
dispose of their property as they choose.</p>
