	<p class="article-leader">Michael Dukakis has said that foreign investment will help
Massachusetts out of its economic slump, but this week he
signed an emergency anti-takeover law to protect Norton Co.
from BTR. This is a new "war for independence," he said,
likening the British firm's bid to "another attempt by a
foreign power to interfere with our ability to share our own
destiny." Hmm. We imagine Norton shareholders, denied a vote
on the anti-takeover rules, will count themselves as
conscientious objectors.</p>
