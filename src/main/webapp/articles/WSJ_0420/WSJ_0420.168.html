	<p class="article-leader">The American Booksellers Association and a collection of
bookstore chains and independent store owners are taking out
a full-page ad in 30 major newspapers Monday protesting an
increase in censorship.
   The booksellers' group has publicly protested the banning
of books for years, but this particular protest wasn't
prompted by small-town libraries burning copies of "Catcher
in the Rye." This fight started over bookstores that sell
Playboy magazine, particularly the Waldenbooks unit of K mart
Corp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As it turns out, the American Family Association, a
Christian group known for pressuring companies who advertise
on certain television shows, plans to picket up to 400 stores
across the country next Friday, mostly K mart and Waldenbooks
stores. The picketing comes on top of a boycott of K mart and
Waldenbooks that was launched several months ago by the AFA.</p>
<p>The fight began last fall when the AFA's Florida chapter
asked Waldenbooks and other retailers to stop selling Playboy
and Penthouse magazines, saying that the organization would
alert the public to their practice of selling pornography if
they didn't stop. Waldenbooks then joined with the publisher
of Playboy, the American Booksellers Association and various
magazine distributors to sue AFA's Florida director, alleging
the AFA tried to coerce them to stop doing something they
have a legal right to do.</p>
<p>Oren Teicher, associate director of the American
Booksellers Association, says Waldenbooks came up with the
idea for Monday's ad. He says Waldenbooks provided suggested
copy and will pay most of the $400,000-plus cost of running
the ads. The ABA wanted to sign the ad, says Mr. Teicher,
because the booksellers group sued the AFA along with
Waldenbooks, and because "We wanted to stand together and let
people know that if you attack one of us in the bookselling
business, you attack all of us."</p>
<p>Judith Krug of the American Library Association in
Chicago, who collects examples of books and magazines banned
by libraries and schools around the country, says she sees an
increase in censorship. "There is a growing intolerance in
this country, a movement to limit what books and magazines
are available," says Ms. Krug. "We just learned that `Little
Red Riding Hood' has been removed from first and second-grade
classes in a California school system because {someone
thinks} it's too violent."</p>
<p>Waldenbooks Chairman Harry Hoffman says, "I think we've
got to start galvanizing public opinion against censorship
and make people realize it is a growing problem."</p>
<p>Monday's ad talks about how various groups are fighting to
control the content of textbooks, songs, movies and
television shows, as well as books, and asks readers to fill
out a "ballot" protesting censorship and mail it to the
American Booksellers Association or take it to their local
bookstore. Mr. Hoffman says Waldenbooks stores will all carry
displays of "banned books" to punctuate the point.</p>
<p>Reaction to the anti-censorship campaign is surprisingly
positive at the American Family Association. Publicity about
it "will let more people know they {Waldenbooks and K mart}
are selling pornography," says executive director Donald
Wildmon of Tupelo, Miss. "You know, we aren't complaining
here about `Huckleberry Finn.' Heck, I read that book when I
was in school, and I think it's pretty terrific. We're just
engaging in our constitutional right to picket stores like K
mart that sell pornography."</p>
