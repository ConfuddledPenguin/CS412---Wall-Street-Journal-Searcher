	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Assets of the nation's 508 money-market funds
fell $1.25 billion, to $388.60 billion, in the week ended
Wednesday, according to the Investment Company Institute, a
Washington-based trade association.
   "With short-term interest rates continuing to hold fairly
steady, the overall change in money-market fund assets held
in individual accounts was small," said Jacob Dreyer, vice
president and chief economist at the institute. "Massive
flows of individual tax payments and refunds, typical for
mid-April, also had no discernible effect on money-market
fund assets. On the other hand, money-market fund assets held
in institutional accounts dropped over $1 billion, most
probably in response to an abrupt rise in the federal funds
rate."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Assets of 246 general-purpose funds fell $467.3 million,
to $133.05 billion, while assets of 102 broker-dealer funds
rose $237.3 million, to $165.32 billion. Assets of 160
institutional funds fell $1.02 billion, to $90.23 billion.</p>
