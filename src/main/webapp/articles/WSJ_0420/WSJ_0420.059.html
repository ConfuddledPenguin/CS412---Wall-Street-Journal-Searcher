	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON, Mass. -- Gillette Co., citing strong sales of its
new Sensor razor and its international businesses, reported
healthy sales and earnings gains for the first quarter and
boosted its dividend 12.5%
   The shaving and personal-care products company said net
income rose 12% to $87 million from $77.6 million in the 1989
first quarter on an 11% sales increase, to $1.05 billion from
$941 million. Per-share net income available to common
stockholders dropped 6% to 75 cents a share from 80 cents,
however, because of a $14.2 million preferred stock dividend.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Gillette also announced at its annual meeting that it is
increasing its quarterly dividend to 27 cents a share from 24
cents, payable June 5 to stock of record May 1.</p>
<p>Gillette said its North Atlantic shaving group posted a 9%
increase in sales but a 9% decline in operating profit
because of the costs of the Sensor introduction. However,
that profit decline was more than offset by improvements
elsewhere; in Europe, for example, sales were up 26% and
profits rose 9%, the company's Braun electric shaver and
small appliance business posted a 15% increase in profits on
a 19% sales increase and its Oral B dental care business had
a 72% increase in profits on a 33% sales increase.</p>
<p>Sensor got off to an unexpectedly fast start and the
company is having a difficult time producing enough of the
product to meet demand; the company is speeding up the
installation of equipment to increase production capacity.
Gillette said it already has shipped nine million Sensor
razors since its introduction, a level that it didn't expect
to reach until October.</p>
<p>John W. Symons, executive vice president in charge of the
North Atlantic shaving group, said that Sensor is helping
Gillette achieve its goal of winning over some customers who
traditionally use lower-priced, less profitable disposable
razors. Early surveys indicate that 74% of Sensor buyers had
used other Gillette products, and 26% used competitors'
products, he noted. Of that 26%, about half used disposable
razors made by other companies.</p>
<p>Mr. Symons noted that the tight supply of Sensor blade
cartridges "is easing now and will get considerably better in
May and June."</p>
<p>Largely because of Sensor, disposable razors' share of the
wet shaving market declined to 41.6% in the January-February
period from 42.7% in November and December, Gillette noted.
While that is a small shift, Gillette considers it
significant because disposables have steadily increased their
share of the U.S. market ever since being introduced in the
1970s. "It is a possibility, in fact now a probability" that
the long-term trend toward disposables can be reversed, Mr.
Symons maintained.</p>
<p>One issue that has made executives a bit "anxious" is that
Sensor users seem to be getting more shaves per blade
cartridge than they did with other Gillette razors, he said.
But whether this is a result of changed shaving patterns or
the shortage of Sensor blades isn't clear yet, he indicated.</p>
