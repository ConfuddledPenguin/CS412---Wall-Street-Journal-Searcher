	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Prosecutors gave Michael R. Milken a deadline
of noon today to accept a plea bargain or face additional
charges, according to people familiar with the plea
negotiations.
   Lawyers for the former chief of Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc.'s junk-bond operations have spent nearly four months
trying to negotiate an agreement that would enable Mr. Milken
to avoid the new charges and the prospect of a lengthy trial.
Mr. Milken already faces charges on 98 counts related to
insider trading and other alleged securities-law violations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The government is buttressing its deadline by ordering the
federal grand jury that has been investigating Mr. Milken to
convene in Manhattan today, individuals familiar with the
investigation said. If Mr. Milken decides not to accept the
plea agreement, the grand jury could vote on an expanded
indictment this afternoon.</p>
<p>Any plea agreement would involve a settlement of civil
insider-trading charges brought by the Securities and
Exchange Commission in September 1988, as well as the
criminal charges -- including racketeering, conspiracy and
securities fraud -- handed up by a federal grand jury in
March 1989.</p>
<p>Under the settlement terms offered by the government, Mr.
Milken would have to plead guilty to six felony counts and
pay more than $650 million in fines and penalties, according
to individuals familiar with the plea discussions. While a
federal judge would decide on the length of Mr. Milken's
prison term, prosecutors would recommend a sentence totaling
five years for all the counts, the individuals said. A
spokesman for Mr. Milken declined to comment.</p>
<p>Lawyers familiar with the case say Mr. Milken would be
unlikely to receive as attractive a settlement offer once a
new indictment was issued and the government began to prepare
for trial. If convicted of racketeering charges at trial, Mr.
Milken could face up to 20 years in prison.</p>
<p>While an acceptable plea agreement seemed highly unlikely
as recently as last week, Mr. Milken's legal team, led by
Arthur Liman, a partner at the New York firm of Paul, Weiss,
Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison, has been negotiating nearly
around the clock since last weekend with officials of the
SEC.</p>
<p>Among the major sticking points from the standpoint of the
Milken camp was the SEC's insistence that Mr. Milken
cooperate in the government's continuing insider-trading
investigations, individuals familiar with the negotiations
say. The government is understood to have softened the terms
of its cooperation requirement.</p>
<p>Individuals who spoke with Mr. Milken as recently as late
yesterday said that while some of his attorneys and others
recommended that he accept the negotiated pact, Mr. Milken
had still not made up his mind about whether to do so. They
said Mr. Milken was less concerned about the fines and jail
term than he was about having to cooperate with any further
investigation. In addition, he was said to be worried about
the status of the case against his brother, Lowell Milken,
who was also charged in last year's indictment.</p>
<p>Although Michael Milken has directed his lawyers to work
out terms of an agreement, individuals who know him well say
they wouldn't be surprised if he rejected the pact at the
last minute. Before last year's indictment, Mr. Milken's
attorneys held a round of negotiations with the government.
But after prosecutors relented on certain positions Mr.
Milken considered key to a settlement, Mr. Milken rejected
the offer in the end, the individuals said.</p>
<p>The latest government deadline was set by Roger Hayes, the
deputy U.S. attorney in Manhattan who is supervising the
case. Prosecutors last month had told U.S. District Judge
Kimba Wood that a new indictment would be handed up no later
than this week.</p>
