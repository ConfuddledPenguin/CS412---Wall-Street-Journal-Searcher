	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A film script about a private eye who
joins a former football star to solve a murder sold for a
record $1.75 million.
   "The Last Boy Scout" could have fetched $2 million, but
28-year-old screenwriter Shane Black said he preferred to
sign with the David Geffen Co., an independent producer he
worked with previously.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Recently, it's become almost routine to ask $1 million for
prized screenplays. But industry executives said Tuesday's
sale price far exceeded previous highs.</p>
<p>A bidding war has broken out during the past year for
"spec scripts," screenplays written without having been
commissioned by a producer or studio.</p>
<p>The boom, fed in part by an expansion push by Twentieth
Century Fox, Walt Disney Co. and Columbia Pictures, ended the
$300,000 benchmark price for top scripts a year ago.</p>
<p>Some studio executives say script auctioning has become
too costly. "To get $1 million, it used to have to be a
damned good script. Now, you practically pay that for the
idea alone and wind up with a lot of rewrites," said David
Hoberman, head of Disney's Touchstone unit.</p>
<p>Others like the change. "I don't know of anything that
generates the excitement of the chase after a big script,"
said John Goldwyn, executive vice president of world-wide
production at MGM/UA Communications Co.</p>
<p>Screenwriters increasingly are auctioning their work as
studios turn away from the development process, in which
writers are paid to write and rewrite ideas discussed in
advance.</p>
