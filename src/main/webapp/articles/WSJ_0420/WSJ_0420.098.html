	<p class="article-leader">BLUE BELL, Pa. -- Unisys Corp. said its first-quarter loss
narrowed sharply to $3.1 million from $78.7 million a year
earlier.
   After allowing for preferred dividends, the loss in the
latest period amounted to 19 cents a share, roughly in line
with expectations. The 1989 first-quarter loss was equal to
66 cents a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Revenue rose 5% to $2.31 billion from $2.20 billion,
slightly above expectations, but analysts remained
noncommittal about the company's prospects.</p>
<p>Unisys attributed much of the improvement to healthier
gross margins resulting from a scaling down last year that
trimmed the computer maker's work force by about 8,000 jobs.
Full benefits from those steps, which led to a $230-million
charge in the 1989 third quarter, will kick in during the
second half of this year, Unisys said. The company previously
estimated the cutbacks will save it about $500 million
annually.</p>
<p>"Overall, we believe that we are on track to reach our
1990 goal of reducing debt, restoring sound profitability and
improving cash flow," James Unruh, president and chief
executive, said in a statement. A company spokesman said
Unisys, which has been criticized by analysts as too highly
leveraged, reduced its debt by between $50 million and $100
million during the period.</p>
<p>Unisys said its international results were strong, but
that domestic business, long a disappointing performer,
"remains weak." The company has been buffeted by a price war
and strong competition in the U.S. mainframe computer market,
and analysts said its troubles in that area are likely to
continue.</p>
<p>Unisys said its strongest gains were in networking
products, software, services, and computers using the Unix
operating system.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Unisys closed at $14.625, unchanged.</p>
