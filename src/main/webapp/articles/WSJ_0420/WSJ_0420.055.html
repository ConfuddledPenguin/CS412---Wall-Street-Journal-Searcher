	<p class="article-leader">Beware of answered prayers.
   That's what Eastern Airlines' newly named trustee, Martin
R. Shugrue, and the unsecured creditors who fought so hard
for his appointment may be about to learn.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>After a bankruptcy court judge took away control of
Eastern from Texas Air Corp. chairman Frank Lorenzo late
Wednesday night and gave it to them, they now face the
daunting task of trying to revive the ailing carrier.</p>
<p>"It'll take a minimum of a month, more like a couple of
months, for things to settle down," predicted Joel Zweibel,
attorney for the unsecured creditors' committee, in an
interview yesterday.</p>
<p>Mr. Shugrue, the surprise appointee who only a year ago
was squeezed out as president of Mr. Lorenzo's Continental
Airlines, is "stepping into a big, complex situation," Mr.
Zweibel conceded.</p>
<p>Mr. Lorenzo may be gone, but the problems that bested him
and his managers aren't: deep financial losses, a lack of
consumer and travel agent confidence, labor unrest, high fuel
prices.</p>
<p>And while Mr. Shugrue officially reports to U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland who named him, his
fiduciary responsibility is to the creditors, who essentially
own Eastern now. To them will fall, among other things, the
job of helping draft the company's next reorganization plan.</p>
<p>Eastern does have some breathing room, according to
creditors' representatives and Eastern insiders alike. Even
as Judge Lifland disclosed Mr. Shugrue's appointment, he also
released $80 million from an escrow account to fund Eastern's
second-quarter operations.</p>
<p>The promise of that money, and the possibility of calm at
Eastern, could go a long way toward reassuring travelers as
well as travel agents who many consider vital to the
carrier's future.</p>
<p>"There's no guarantee the company is going to survive,
obviously," said Paul Ruden, a senior vice president of the
American Society of Travel Agents, but "if people are tending
to business and don't have to be in bankruptcy court, they
can let the managers manage."</p>
<p>Texas Air, which had fought hard to keep Eastern under its
mantle, formally said yesterday that it wouldn't appeal the
judge's order for a trustee. In an interview, Mr. Lorenzo
said: "We'd hoped the Eastern situation would have been
different, there's no kidding about that." But he called the
selection of Mr. Shugrue "reasonable," and said: "We intend
to work and support and help Eastern in every way we can."</p>
<p>Eastern's labor groups, who had been Mr. Lorenzo's
staunchest enemies and had pleaded for a trustee to run the
airline a year ago, predictably crowed yesterday. "We said
{Mr. Lorenzo} couldn't run an airline, and the court agreed
with us," declared Capt. Henry Duffy, head of the national
chapter of the Air Line Pilots Association. "This is a chance
for Eastern to survive, or at least be put in a position to
be sold. We saw no hope of that under {Mr.} Lorenzo."</p>
<p>Curiously for Texas Air, aside from being a blow to its
corporate pride, the loss of Eastern may not be entirely bad
news.</p>
<p>In the interview, Mr. Lorenzo said that with Eastern no
longer under the Texas Air umbrella, the parent doesn't have
to include Eastern on its consolidated balance sheet. He said
he expects that to produce a substantial gain for Texas Air.
Eastern was carried on Texas Air's books at $1.2 billion.</p>
<p>Texas Air also has been rolling up record losses in recent
years in part because of Eastern's deficits. Texas Air
reported a $718 million loss in 1988 and an $886 million loss
in 1989.</p>
<p>Texas Air may be able to avoid paying Eastern $280 million
in promised compensation, including $133 million in cash, for
certain transactions between the two before the bankruptcy
filing last year.</p>
<p>After a six-month investigation, court-appointed examiner
David I. Shapiro last month found that in a dozen
intracompany transactions, it could be argued that Texas Air
underpaid Eastern by as much as $400 million. Texas Air
agreed to settle for the smaller amount, which was to have
been paid on confirmation of a consensual reorganization plan
with the creditors.</p>
<p>With no reorganization plan forthcoming, the settlement no
longer stands. Mr. Zweibel, the creditors' attorney, said his
group is considering whether to try to renegotiate the $280
million settlement or attempt to extract more money from
Texas Air by suing on each of the controversial transactions.
That, however, would mean extended litigation.</p>
<p>Mr. Lorenzo said it was premature to comment on the
situation. "We're going to have to see where we go with the
examiner and the trustee," he said.</p>
<p>Texas Air is still on the hook for part of Eastern's
underfunded pension plans. The Pension Benefit Guarantee
Corp., the federal agency that insures the plans, estimates
the underfunding at $984 million; Texas Air claims the total
is about $400 million. The agency has authority to terminate
the plan and force Texas Air to come up with the money. And
if it were to seek it all at once, it could force Texas Air
and Continental into a Chapter 11 filing.</p>
<p>But the pension agency isn't likely to insist that Texas
Air pay up right away, because such a demand would increase
the agency's own liabilities. Last week, the agency secured a
commitment from Texas Air that it would fund part of the plan
even if a trustee was named. Yesterday, Mr. Lorenzo and the
pension agency said discussions were continuing on how to
deal with the pensions.</p>
<p>"We fully intend to work with the PBGC," Mr. Lorenzo said.
Individuals familiar with the situation say it's most likely
the two sides will agree on plan to pay off the pensions over
time.</p>
<p>Mr. Shugrue met yesterday with representatives of the
creditors' committee and last night flew to Miami, where
Eastern has its headquarters. He is expected to sit in on
Eastern officers' usual meeting today.</p>
<p>Mr. Zweibel said Mr. Shugrue didn't have a list of
executives he wanted hired to manage Eastern. Clearly,
however, there will be some openings as some senior
executives leave.</p>
<p>Phil Bakes, Eastern's current president under Texas Air,
declined yesterday to say whether he would stay at the
carrier with Mr. Shugrue at the helm. It's understood,
however, he intends to leave and return in some capacity to
Texas Air where he had been an executive in the past.
Eastern's current general counsel, Barry Simon, also is
expected to return to the parent where he has previously
served.</p>
<p>Prior to the naming of the trustee Wednesday, Eastern vice
president Jose Smith resigned to accept a job at another
company.</p>
