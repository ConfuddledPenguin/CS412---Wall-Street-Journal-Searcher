	<p class="article-leader">OAKLAND, Calif. -- Sarunas Marciulionis, the National
Basketball Association's first Soviet import, gazes calmly
into the television lights just after picking up 15 points to
help his team win big in its final home game on Wednesday.
   A man with an accent pokes a microphone toward him and
asks if he has any words for his "many Latino fans." Without
hesitation, he smiles confidently for the cameras and says:
"Sure. Gracias."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Flashback to last fall, when such smoothness was not
evident: Mr. Marciulionis slumps on a chair for medical
treatment after a lousy game, his English thick-tongued
although the sound slipping through his clenched teeth
translates easily enough: "Arrrghh]" He has an ugly gash on
right wrist and a scarlet hook of welts on his left bicep.
Two wires run from a flashing electronic box to his neck,
pulsing with current to relieve muscle spasms. (That injury
resulted from a collision with American culture rather than
with an American opponent: He hurt his neck twisting suddenly
to catch something on one of his three color-TV sets.)</p>
<p>"You look like a robot," chortles Manute Bol, his
7-foot-7-inch teammate. "Mr. Neck," quips another. "Welcome
to the National Basketball Association, baby," gibes a third.</p>
<p>The national in this case is a 25-year-old Lithuanian, who
has gone from stardom on the Soviet team to being an average
substitute guard in the NBA. But he has come a long way since
his historic season began last October.</p>
<p>In one of the more intriguing glasnostic sidelights, Mr.
Marciulionis became the first Soviet athlete ever permitted
by Soviet authorities to play for an American professional
team in a genuine, born-in-the-USA sport. After years of
delicate negotiations and false starts, Mr. Marciulionis
(pronounced Marsh-a-LOAN-us) signed a three-year contract
with the Golden State Warriors at $1.3 million a year. He
gets to keep 60%; Soviet authorities get the rest.</p>
<p>Mr. Marciulionis's season has been complicated by events
back home, as Lithuania attempts to secede from the Soviet
Union. At his first press conference, the first words out of
his mouth were: "I am a Lithuanian, not a Russian." He is a
nationalist, rooting for independence but worrying about his
family and friends. "Lithuanians must be free," he says.
"Gorbachev must understand this. The wall is down. The Poles
are free. I think Lithuania will be free too, but I worry."</p>
<p>After the Warriors final game Sunday, Mr. Marciulionis
intends to go back to Lithuania. The Warriors don't want him
to go; they're afraid he might not be able to get back out to
rejoin the team.</p>
<p>Over the course of the season, Mr. Marciulionis has had
some awful games and some good games (zero points against the
Los Angeles Lakers in March; 33 points against the Orlando
Magic in January), averaging 12 points a game. His coach has
gone from early-season raves about his play to a rather
tepid, "He's done a nice job, but he's got a tremendous
amount to learn."</p>
<p>All things considered, Mr. Marciulionis says, "it's been a
crazy time."</p>
<p>Mr. Marciulionis is the leader of a fast break by East
bloc basketball stars toward America, land of the free throw
and home of the wave. It is all part of the
internationalization of professional sports.</p>
<p>Six Soviet hockey stars have arrived this year to play in
the National Hockey League. One defected in order to play,
which may help explain why the others were given permission
to skate. There is even talk of young Soviet and East bloc
hotshots attending and playing for American colleges, though
some might have to take pay cuts to come here.</p>
<p>A few deep thinkers perceive serious geopolitical
implications in the sporting world's Westward tilt. The
returns coming in as the NBA season winds down suggest the
main implication for basketball is a potentially vast source
of new talent, amusing spectacle and truly great names.</p>
<p>Aside from Mr. Marciulionis, there is Zarko Paspalj
(pronounced PAZ-pie), a gabby Yugoslavian on the San Antonio
Spurs who chain-smokes Marlboros, eats at least one Pizza Hut
Supreme a day and says he wants to open the first Pizza Hut
in Yugoslavia. His talking outshines his playing: He is
averaging 2.6 points a game.</p>
<p>Teammates of Aleksander Volkov, the Atlanta Hawks's
Ukranian power forward, instantly nicknamed him "Gym," short
for "Gym rat," because of his diligent after-hours
practicing. Mr. Volkov (pronounced VOHL-cough) kept asking
why his teammates were calling him "Jim" when Al was just as
easy to pronounce.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Lakers drafted Vlade Divac (pronounced
DEE-vash), a 7-footer whose NBA future was briefly clouded by
the subsequent draft by another squad: the Yugoslavian army.
An accommodation was made so Mr. Divac could serve as a
back-up Lakers center rather than a first-string Yugoslavian
grunt, and he has become one of the Lakers's most valuable
substitutes. In all, there are five Eastern European players
in the NBA this year.</p>
<p>They seem to be catching on to the American game, on
court, off court -- and in court. The owners of Jugoplastika,
a Yugoslavian team sponsored by a plastics conglomerate, sued
the Boston Celtics successfully in federal court to prevent
the Celts from spiriting away Jugoplastika star Dino Radja
(pronounced RAHDjaw).</p>
<p>The idea of all these dribbling foreigners doesn't please
everyone. "We don't need to go overseas for players," Larry
Bird, the great Boston Celtics star, has asserted. His
comments distressed team officials; the Celtics have the
league's only full-time Eastern European scout, Misho
Ostarckebic (pronounced, oh, never mind). The Celts have also
been pursuing Stojan "Stojko" Vrankovick, a 7-2, 260-pound
Yugoslavian said to have an amazing 37-inch vertical leap.</p>
<p>Mr. Marciulionis, a 6-5 inch, 200-pound guard with thickly
muscled thighs and huge, powerful hands, was steered into
basketball by the Soviet sport apparatchiks at the age of 10.
At age 18, he made the Soviet team, and quickly became one of
its stars. On the Soviets' 1988 gold medal Olympic team, Mr.
Marciulionis scored 18 points in the defeat of the U.S.</p>
<p>But since coming to America, Mr. Marciulionis has pretty
much been living in a state of constant confusion --
California. "I have new home, new friends, new climate. I
have much thinking, but not much words . . . trouble
communications with teammates . . . is frustrated but getting
better," he sputters after one recent practice. Though his
English has improved markedly since his arrival, he still
can't speak well enough to understand all the new plays and
new rules that Warriors coaches and American life have thrown
at him.</p>
<p>This has spawned some revolutionary coaching techniques.
"Two up, two up," barks Warriors assistant coach Garry St.
Jean during a workout, calling for a bread-and-butter
offensive pattern. Mr. Marciulionis holds the ball with a
puzzled look on his face. Mr. St. Jean is explaining what to
do if the center is defended and can't take the pass. "The
center is covered, so you look for the next option," he says.
Mr. Marciulionis flips the ball to the center anyway. "No,
he's covered," Mr. St. Jean explains in a patient, fatherly
way. "Covered."</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, Mr. St. Jean screams, races from under the
basket, grabs the center's jersey, waves his hand in the
center's face, wraps his arms around the center. Turning to
Mr. Marciulionis, he yells: "Covered." Mr. Marciulionis and
his teammates crack up. They run the play again, and Mr.
Marciulionis gets it right.</p>
<p>He has adapted quickly in other ways. He lives in a swank
Oakland suburb and owns a black Mercedes. "Is dream come
true," he says. He adds that drivers in California, are "more
gentlemen, more intelligent" than Lithuanian drivers, an
observation that may discourage Americans from car tours of
the Lithuanian countryside.</p>
<p>At his U.S. basketball debut in the Warriors opening game
in Phoenix, he entered the game at 4:02 of the second
quarter. He started tentatively, passing up an open jumper to
pass off. He stumbled on defense and got called for the NBA's
first Soviet foul. But at 2:01, he took the ball on the right
side, bulled toward the hoop and got fouled. Two free throws.
Swish. Swish. The NBA's first Soviet points.</p>
<p>The Warriors got clobbered in the game, but Mr.
Marciulionis finished with 17 points. In recognition of his
debut, the NBA has put his jersey from the game on display at
the Basketball Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>Since the auspicious opener in October, Mr. Marciulionis
has shown powerful moves to the basket and tremendous
competitive fire, but his outside shot, considered one of his
strengths, has been erratic. His defense has at times been
dreadful.</p>
<p>Mr. Marciulionis vows to do better. "I must come back to
NBA, to prove I belong," he says, standing in front of a
locker. "For myself, for all foreign players. I must improve.
I will improve."</p>
