	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Big stocks tumbled yesterday as investors
moved out of consumer issues and stocks of companies with bad
earnings reports and continued to fret over the sagging bond
market.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 20.94 to 2711.94,
the second decline in as many days. Stock-index arbitrage
sell programs pushed stocks into steeper losses in late
trading. Volume totaled 152,930,000 shares on the New York
Stock Exchange. That was the most since April 4 when
159,540,000 shares traded, but still below last year's daily
average volume of 165,470,000. Declining issues on the Big
Board outnumbered advancers 968 to 511.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The 30-stock Dow Average fell 0.77%, while the New York
Stock Exchange Composite index fell 0.73%. Big consumer and
other non-industrial shares in the Dow average were heaviest
hit.</p>
<p>Coca-Cola tumbled 1 7/8 to 77 3/8. A "Heard on the Street"
column in this newspaper suggested that shares of Coca-Cola
and PepsiCo are overpriced. Pepsi fell 7/8 to 65 1/2.</p>
<p>American Express, another stock in the industrial average,
fell 1 1/4 to 27 5/8 on volume of 1.5 million shares.
American Express reported a $1.50 a share loss for the first
quarter, including charges related to the restructuring of
Shearson Lehman Hutton. Shearson Lehman Hutton fell 1/2 to
13.</p>
<p>Among other big stocks in the Dow average were Procter &
Gamble, down 1 to 69 1/4, and Boeing, off 3/8 to 71 1/8.</p>
<p>Outside of the Dow industrials, buyers were picking
selectively among secondary issues. "If you look outside
Procter & Gamble, Coke and Boeing, you can easily notice some
demand," said Edward Laux, head of block trading at Kidder
Peabody.</p>
<p>PPG Industries, for example, rose 1 1/4 to 44 5/8. The
company reported first quarter earnings rose to $1.16 a share
from $1.15 a year earlier, and boosted its quarterly dividend
to 42 cents from 38 cents.</p>
<p>Yesterday marked a pronounced rotation out of consumer
stocks and into shares of companies whose fortunes are tied
to the pace of economic activity. Among the so-called
cyclical sectors, Ford gained 1/4 to 48 1/4 and General
Motors gained 7/8 to 46 7/8.</p>
<p>However, a weak bond market continued to rattle stock
investors. The 30-year Treasury bond closed down nearly 1/8
of a point, or almost $1.25 for each $1,000 face amount,
after falling more than one point Wednesday.</p>
<p>Peter Canelo, investment strategist at Bear Stearns, said
weak bond prices appear to be more of an influence over
stocks at this point than first-quarter earnings reports.</p>
<p>While overall earnings appear to be down again, Mr. Canelo
said the decline isn't as steep. Quarterly results from a
group of 98 companies tracked by Mr. Canelo show an average
decline of about 7% from a year earlier, compared with a
fourth-quarter drop of about 15%.</p>
<p>Shares of Comdisco plunged 8 1/2 to close at 18 in Big
Board trading of 2.6 million shares after the company
announced that second-quarter earnings are expected to be as
much as 30% lower than the year-ago period. The volume was 30
times its average daily volume. Analysts had been forecasting
that net for the quarter would be above the 60 cents a share
that the company reported in the year-ago period.</p>
<p>Comdisco executives called the sharp stock decline an
overreaction by Wall Street. Comdisco attributed the
projected earnings drop to customer jitters over the
impending, yet unknown, introduction date of International
Business Machines' Summit products. This left Comdisco's
customers leary of long-term leases on mainframe computer
equipment, and they instead opted for short-term leases
during the second quarter ended March 31, the company said.</p>
<p>Silicon Graphics plunged 3 5/8 to 31 3/4 despite reporting
that earnings for the fiscal third quarter, ended last month,
were almost triple the year-ago figures.</p>
<p>Earnings-related selling also weighed on Reebok
International, which fell 1 1/2 to 17 1/2 on a disappointing
7% increase in its first-quarter earnings; Alaska Air Group
fell 1 1/4 to 23 3/8, Diamond Shamrock declined 3/4 to 24
1/2, and Charles Schwab dropped 5/8 to 15 1/4.</p>
<p>Conversely, Digital Equipment gained 2 1/8 to 82 1/8 on
1.9 million shares after releasing its earnings for the
fiscal third quarter, ended last month. While its net income
was down 90% from a year earlier -- largely because of a
charge for restructuring -- analysts said the company's
operating results were better than expected.</p>
<p>Other issues to benefit from strong quarterly earnings
reports included Glenfed, which rose 7/8 to 12 3/4; Oregon
Steel Mills, up 1 3/4 to 37 3/4, and Vista Chemical climbed 1
to 4 1/4 in its second straight session of heavy trading amid
speculation that Thomson of Canada may be interested in
acquiring the company. Harcourt officials weren't available
for comment, while Thomson declined comment.</p>
<p>Harcourt was the most active New York Stock Exchange issue
on volume of about 2.8 million shares. More than 1.3 million
were traded on Wednesday, when the stock rose 1/4 point. The
company's 12% preferred stock was also active in the latest
session; the stock issue rose to 1/2 to 3 3/8 as 1.5 million
changed hands.</p>
<p>Dayton Hudson dropped 1 1/4 to 69 1/2 after announcement
of its agreement to acquire the Marshall Field's
department-store chain for about $1.04 billion from Britain's
B.A.T Industries. B.A.T gained 1/16 to 11 7/8 in American
Stock Exchange trading.</p>
<p>Santa Fe Pacific, which agreed to a $350 million
settlement of litigation regarding an alleged conspiracy to
block construction of a coal-slurry pipeline, climbed 1 5/8
to 21 1/2. A federal court had ordered the company last year
to pay $750.1 million in the case.</p>
<p>Raychem gained 1 3/8 to 26 3/4. Donaldson, Lufkin &
Jenrette raised its investment rating on the stock to "buy"
from "neutral," even though it lowered its estimate of fiscal
1990 earnings to a range of 40 to 50 cents a share from 60
cents.</p>
<p>Nord Resources dropped 1 to 15 1/8. Shearson Lehman Hutton
lowered its earnings estimate for 1990 by 10 cents a share,
to $1.20, after learning from the company that it hasn't yet
secured any commercial orders for its new high-grade kaolin
products.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 2.49
to 350.73. Volume totaled 15,100,000 shares. There were 226
issues advancing and 346 declining.</p>
<p>Texas Air rose 1/2 to 6 5/8 in the wake of a federal
judge's decision to name a trustee to manage its Eastern
Airlines unit, currently in Chapter 11 bankruptcy
proceedings. The company said it wouldn't appeal the ruling,
which also released $80 million in funds from an escrow
account.</p>
<p>A.T. Cross Class A slid 1 5/8 to 30 7/8 after estimating
that first-quarter earnings declined 40% and sales fell 8%
from year-earlier levels.</p>
