	<p class="article-leader">SCOTTS VALLEY, Calif. -- In buying Imprimis Technology
Inc. last October, Seagate Technology Inc. found that it also
bought a lawsuit.
   The computer disk-drive maker said it was sued in state
court in Santa Clara County by rival Conner Peripherals Inc.
The suit charges that Seagate cut off Conner's supply of thin
film heads from Imprimis despite a guarantee that it wouldn't
do so. Conners uses the film heads to manufacture hard-disk
drives.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Seagate declined further comment on the suit. Conners said
it took the action because Seagate's action amounted to a
"breach of contract" that has crimped production of some
disk-drive products. But a spokesman said Conners has been
able to find components elsewhere, and that it doesn't expect
the shortage to hurt future financial results.</p>
<p>Conners is asking the court for unspecified damages.</p>
<p>Seagate's stock, meanwhile, fell $3.125 to $12.50 in
over-the-counter trading yesterday. But the company said it
didn't think the drop was related to the suit. On Wednesday,
Seagate reported quarterly earnings of 44 cents a share,
which a spokesman said were "below expectations but hardly a
disaster."</p>
