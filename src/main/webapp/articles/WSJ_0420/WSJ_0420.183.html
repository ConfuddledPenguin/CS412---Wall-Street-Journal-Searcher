	<p class="article-leader">Bell Atlantic Corp., U S West Inc. and Nynex Corp., aided
by strong non-telephone operations, such as cellular phone
service, reported strong earnings gains.
   Pacific Telesis Group and Southern New England
Telecommunications Corp. had declines, primarily because of
higher expenses and reductions in telephone revenue.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>U S West Inc.</p>
<p>U S West managed to post an 8.9% increase in net income,
even though revenue from its largest contributor, the
telephone sector, was essentially flat. Jack A. MacAllister,
U S West's chairman and chief executive officer, attributed
the gain to solid growth in the non-telephone sector, which
includes cellular operations, directory publishing and
financial services.</p>
<p>The Denver company said revenue in the non-telephone group
climbed almost 11% to $405.1 million. Telephone revenue
basically was flat at $2.02 billion. Overall, U S West's
revenue inched up 1.4% to $2.43 billion from $2.39 billion a
year ago.</p>
<p>Telephone operations were hurt by lower interstate access
charges and rate reductions. However, the sector had strong
growth in new telephone lines, which increased 3% to 12.3
million. Minutes of local long-distance usage also rose to
9.3 million, a 5.4% jump from 8.8 million in the year-earlier
quarter.</p>
<p>U S West said revenue for its cellular company, U S West
NewVector Group Inc., surged 54% to $58.5 million from $37.9
million. NewVector reported a 66% increase in new cellular
customers. The cellular unit had a loss of about $4 million,
compared with a loss of $5.3 million a year ago.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, U
S West fell 25 cents to $72.50.</p>
<p>Nynex</p>
<p>Nynex said earnings were hampered by a pretax charge of
$39 million for the New York company's previously announced
early retirement program. To date, about 3,100 management
employees plan to retire.</p>
<p>Nynex's modest 2.8% profit increase largely reflected
contributions from the company's non-telephone operations.
Overall operating profit from the non-telephone business
segments rose about $22 million from a year ago to about $40
million. Cellular telephone operations had a 62% rise in new
cellular customers for a total of 229,000.</p>
<p>The company also was aided by stringent spending.
Operating expenses rose less than 1% to $2.71 billion,
compared with $2.68 billion a year ago. Despite the soft
Northeast economy, new telephone lines grew about 208,000 to
15.2 million, a 1.3% rise.</p>
<p>Revenue rose 2% to $3.3 billion from $3.2 billion.</p>
<p>In Big Board composite trading yesterday, Nynex closed
down $1.50 at $81.75.</p>
<p>Bell Atlantic</p>
<p>At Bell Atlantic, Philadelphia, net rose 7.4%, reflecting
healthy results across the board.</p>
<p>Revenue rose 9% to $3.02 billion from $2.77 billion. The
revenue growth represents strong volumes in the network
services business, the acquisition of Control Data Corp.'s
third-party maintenance business, and good growth in the
non-telephone business.</p>
<p>Telephone revenue for local service increased 3.2% to
$1.11 billion from $1.08 billion, while non-telephone
operations, excluding financial and real estate division,
rose 47% to $208.4 million.</p>
<p>Expenses increased 8.2% to $2.36 billion, generally
reflecting the Control Data acquisition and expanded business
activity.</p>
<p>Results also include a portion of a $42 million award to
settle charges that its Bell of Pennsylvania unit used
deceptive techniques to sell customers extra services, such
as call waiting and speed dialing.</p>
<p>Bell Atlantic said cellular customer growth was stymied by
above normal disconnections associated with a legal dispute
involving a former sales agent. The company added 18,200
customers for a total of 207,200.</p>
<p>Bell Atlantic fell $1.125 to $95.875 in Big Board trading.</p>
<p>Pacific Telesis</p>
<p>Higher expenses and a rate reduction resulted in a 17%
drop in net income for Pacific Telesis. Expenses rose 6.5%,
primarily because of contract-related labor costs,
depreciation and increased expenditures for telephone network
and internal-operating systems improvements.</p>
<p>The San Francisco company also said results were depressed
by a $391 million rate reduction associated with California's
new regulatory program that became effective in January.</p>
<p>Overall, all operations performed well. Toll messages grew
11% to 829 million and minutes of access use increased 8.8%
to 9.9 billion. The company's Pacific Bell and Nevada Bell
units added more than 144,000 customers, an increase of 4.2%
for a total of 13.8 million.</p>
<p>Cellular operations posted a 74% profit gain to $16.9
million. Cellular revenue rose 36% to $134.3 million, and new
customers increased 44% to about 413,000.</p>
<p>Revenue rose 1.3% to $2.37 billion from $2.34 billion.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Pacific Telesis fell 25 cents to $44.50.</p>
<p>SNET</p>
<p>Southern New England Telecommunications said net dropped
6%, mainly the result of a slowing Connecticut economy and
lower results from the company's telephone operations and
SNET Systems unit.</p>
<p>In January, the New Haven, Conn., company reduced
telephone rates about 5% to reflect the elimination of a
gross earnings tax on telecommunications services.</p>
<p>Moreover, the company said higher expenses associated with
higher wages and benefits and litigation against the company
also hurt profit. Costs increased to $318.6 million from
$313.7 million.</p>
<p>Revenue fell 1% to $401.5 million from $407.1 million.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, SNET
gained 50 cents to $38.50.</p>
