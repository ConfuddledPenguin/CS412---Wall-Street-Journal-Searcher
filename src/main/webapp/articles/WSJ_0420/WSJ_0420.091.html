	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Bond prices generally drifted slightly lower
yesterday as the market's weeklong slump continued.
   But the declines weren't nearly as big as they were
earlier this week. U.S. government bond prices fell about 1/8
point, or $1.25 for each $1,000 face amount. Long-term bonds
yielded about 8.84%, the highest in about a year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Renewed inflation fears and selling by Japanese investors
have jolted the bond markets over the past week. Treasury
bond prices have dropped about 2 1/2 points over the past
five trading days, while yields have risen about 1/4
percentage point. Many analysts expect even higher yields
soon because of the U.S. government's huge borrowing needs
over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>"I think we're going to see somewhat higher interest
rates," said Brian Fabbri, a managing director at Midland
Montagu Securities Inc. He said a 9% bond yield is likely as
the U.S. government's quarterly financing operation,
scheduled for next month, grows nearer. The Treasury is
expected to issue about $30 billion of new notes and bonds in
May.</p>
<p>In the corporate market, prices of investment-grade bonds
also fell slightly yesterday, dropping about 1/8 to 1/4
point. Most junk bonds, which are high-yield, high-risk
issues with low credit ratings or no ratings at all, were
little changed. But junk bonds of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich
Inc. surged on growing speculation that the publishing
company may be the target of a friendly takeover bid.</p>
<p>Municipal and mortgage-backed bond prices also fell.
Trading was relatively calm in contrast to the frenetic pace
earlier this week.</p>
<p>Treasury bond prices began falling early in the day in
response to overseas selling but later edged up slightly.
Prices rallied slightly, late in the day, on news reports
that Federal Reserve officials expect progress in combating
inflation. But even that news did little to ease jitters
about the Treasury's big borrowing needs soon.</p>
<p>"It looks like the U.S. bond market is in a downward
trend," said Rich Spurgin, director of fixed-income research
at Technical Data Global Markets Group. "We expect yields on
the long bond to reach 9% in the next two weeks with 9.15%
possible shortly thereafter."</p>
<p>A 9% yield on long-term Treasury bonds "would bring a lot
of investors back into the marketplace," said Wayne Wong, a
managing director of fixed-income management at Marinvest, a
subsidiary of New York's Marine Midland Bank. At this point,
he said, "buyers are waiting to see where the market bottoms
out."</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>While bond yields generally rose yesterday, rates fell on
short-term Treasury bills.</p>
<p>The Treasury's latest three-month bills were quoted late
in the day at a discount rate of 7.76% bid, or a
bond-equivalent yield of 8%. That compared with Wednesday's
closing discount rate of 7.80% to yield 8.05%.</p>
<p>In the bond market, the price of the government's
benchmark 30-year bonds declined to 96 10/32 from 96 14/32.
Their yield rose to 8.84% from 8.83%. The last time the key
long bond had a higher closing yield was May 11 of last year,
when it was 9.06%.</p>
<p>Other long-term Treasury bonds offered even higher yields
than did the benchmark 30-year issue, and traders said some
of these issues were attracting more investors. For example,
bonds due in 2006 were quoted late yesterday at a yield of
about 8.97%, while bonds due in 2019 yielded about 8.90%.</p>
<p>Corporate Issues</p>
<p>While bond prices generally fell, Harcourt Brace junk
bonds moved the other way.</p>
<p>Prices of some Harcourt Brace bonds jumped three points on
rumors that the company may be taken over in a friendly
transaction. According to Dow Jones Professional Investor
Report, the rumored suitor is Toronto-based Thomson Corp.</p>
<p>Harcourt Brace 13 3/4% senior subordinated debentures due
in 1999 gained 2 3/4 points to close at 77 1/4. The company's
pay-in-kind securities, which pay interest in the form of
additional bonds, rather than cash, were up three points to
41.</p>
<p>Junk bond dealers said, however, that trading in the
issues was light.</p>
<p>Municipals</p>
<p>Mirroring the moves of U.S. Treasurys, activity in the
municipal market slowed from the brisk pace of selling seen
earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Municipals were 1/8 to as much as 5/8 point lower in
secondary dealings. Meanwhile prices in the short-term market
were lower, sending yields as much as .15 percentage point
higher, traders said.</p>
<p>New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% issue of 2018 was
off 1/8 point at 96 7/8 to 97 1/8 to yield 7.45%, .02
percentage point higher than that quoted late Wednesday.</p>
<p>Mortgage-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Mortgage securities, which have fared better than
Treasurys during the recent market losses, came under
pressure amid talk that some big institutional investors were
selling mortgages to purchase Treasurys.</p>
<p>Active mortgage issues were down 3/32 to 8/32.</p>
<p>Traders said some investors believe that Treasurys are now
more attractive with yields on key issues nearing 9% and with
mortgage-Treasury yield differentials narrowing to about one
percentage point.</p>
<p>Government National Mortgage Association 9% securities for
May delivery ended at 94 5/8, down 8/32.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>Japanese bond prices climbed again in reaction to the
yen's rise against the dollar.</p>
<p>The stronger yen is encouraging more Japanese investors to
move money out of U.S. markets and into Japanese bonds,
traders said. Some also said the yen's strength reduces the
likelihood that the Bank of Japan will raise interest rates
soon.</p>
<p>Japan's benchmark issue due 1999 rose 0.24 point to 86.33
to yield 7.295% as of the close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>In other major markets, West German government bond prices
fell slightly in trading dominated largely by futures market
activity. British government bonds were little changed.
Britain's 11 3/4% bonds due 2003-2007 fell 3/32 point to 96
2/32 to yield 12.3%.</p>
