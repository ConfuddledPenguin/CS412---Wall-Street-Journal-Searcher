	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Colgate-Palmolive Co.'s first-quarter profit
surged 21% on an 8% increase in sales as each of its major
businesses and geographical markets posted gains.
   The consumer-product company posted net income of $81.2
million, or $1.16 a share, up from $67.2 million, or 98 cents
a share, a year earlier. Sales rose to $1.3 billion from $1.2
billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The results reflect the company's "growing global
strength," said Reuben Mark, chairman, president and chief
executive officer. In the Western Hemisphere, the company
said, Mexico, Brazil and Canada turned in strong profit
gains. And profit has begun to improve at Colgate-Venezuela,
where results last year were affected by poor economic
conditions.</p>
<p>Profits from U.S. operations were ahead of last year by "a
significant margin," Colgate said. Sales and volume
decreased, but that reflects Colgate's conscious effort to
eliminate less-profitable products. At the same time, Colgate
U.S. is increasing the revenue and profit per case of product
sold, as a result of improved marketing and expense control.</p>
<p>Improved results in Europe reflected growth in the
southern part of the continent, new productions and the
favorable impact of currencies strengthening against the
dollar, the company said. Thailand, Malaysia and the
Philippines were the biggest contributors for Colgate-Far
East/ Africa, the company said.</p>
<p>Colgate shares rose 25 cents each to close at $56.625 in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
