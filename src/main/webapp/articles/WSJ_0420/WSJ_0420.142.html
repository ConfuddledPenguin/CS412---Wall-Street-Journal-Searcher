	<p class="article-leader">Leggett & Platt Inc. said that the Antitrust Division of
the U.S. Department of Justice has issued a request for
additional information in connection with Leggett's planned
purchase of Dresher Inc.
   Based in Carthage, Mo., Leggett & Platt makes furniture
and bed parts. Dresher manufactures brass beds.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Earlier this month, Leggett began a $2.50-a-share tender
offer for all of the common stock outstanding valued at about
$11.5 million. Leggett said that depending on the timing of
the response to the Justice Department, the tender offer may
be extended beyond the May 4 expiration date.</p>
<p>Leggett & Platt said that it intends to respond promptly
to the request and that it believes the purchase doesn't
violate antitrust laws.</p>
