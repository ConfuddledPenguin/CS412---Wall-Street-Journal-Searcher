	<p class="article-leader">General Public Utilities Corp. said it signed a 20-year
agreement to buy 500 megawatts of electricity from DQE Inc.,
parent of Duquesne Light Co., in a deal reflecting the
pressing need for additional power in the Northeast.
   The transaction, valued at more than $630 million, calls
for Parsippany, N.J.-based GPU to acquire a 50% interest in a
now-mothballed DQE power plant for $150 million. It further
calls for the utilities to spend $480 million on a
500-kilovolt transmission line that will carry the power from
Pittsburgh-based DQE generating facilities in western
Pennsylvania to GPU customers in eastern Pennsylvania and New
Jersey.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The first power will be sold in 1994, the utilities said,
with the new line scheduled for completion in 1996. GPU said
it will pay five cents a kilowatt hour for the power in the
first year of the agreement, with the rate rising thereafter.
DQE said revenue derived from the agreement will be shared
with its customers. In the first year alone, DQE could
receive about $185 million in revenue, analysts estimated.</p>
<p>DQE further said it will have the right to use the 50% of
the new transmission line's capacity that isn't utilized
under the GPU arrangement to sell power to other utilities.
DQE Chairman Wesley W. von Schack said he expects "additional
business opportunities" in the Northeast by the mid-1990s,
when, he said, the need for power will be great, while at the
same time new "clean-coal" technology should put DQE's
generating facilities in big demand.</p>
<p>GPU Chairman and President Standley H. Hoch said that
although the DQE power won't help GPU meet its capacity needs
for several years, he expects that other deals GPU has signed
with so-called independent power producers should enable the
utility to avoid brownouts and blackouts.</p>
<p>The deal generally represents a new way of doing business
in the electric-utility industry. Before, when a utility
built a new plant or transmission line, that asset would go
into a pool that could be shared by all utilities in that
region, which in this case is Pennsylvania, New Jersey and
Maryland.</p>
<p>"This deal certainly helps GPU, but it won't help all the
other power-tight utilities in the region," said Daniel
Scotto, utilitybond analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette
Securities Corp.</p>
