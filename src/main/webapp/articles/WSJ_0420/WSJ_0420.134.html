	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- The Canadian government decided to appeal a
Quebec Superior Court ruling that the Competition Tribunal,
which reviews antitrust cases, is unconstitutional.
   The appeal is to be heard by the Quebec Court of Appeal.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The tribunal, which was established four years ago,
reviews cases referred to it by the government's antitrust
agency, the Bureau of Competition Policy.</p>
<p>The tribunal's powers were challenged by Quebec City-based
Alex Couture Inc., a processor of animal waste products,
after the company was blocked from taking control of a
competitor.</p>
<p>The Superior Court ruled that the tribunal, with members
including judges, economists and business specialists, had
powers that violate constitutional guarantees of fair and
impartial judicial proceedings.</p>
