	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Throwing a bone to U.S. critics, Japan's powerful
Finance Ministry is easing the way for foreign banks to open
branches here -- a move that chiefly benefits Citicorp.
   A ministry official said the relaxation of its rules is
part of a gradual liberalization of financial regulations
here. In effect, though, the ministry is granting a special
exemption to foreign institutions. But Citicorp's Citibank in
particular will benefit, the official said, because it is the
only foreign bank aggressively to have sought to expand its
retail network.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The move appears at least partly aimed at appeasing
foreign critics, especially in the U.S. Congress. The
chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Michigan Sen.
Donald W. Riegle Jr., has said that he favors retaliation
against Japanese financial firms operating in the U.S. unless
U.S. banks have equal access to Japan's market. Japanese
banks are the biggest bloc of foreign financial institutions
in the U.S.</p>
<p>But international appeasement by Tokyo may backfire at
home. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., which acts as the chairman
of the Federation of Bankers' Associations in Japan, declined
to comment on the relaxation of rules for foreign banks. An
official at another of Japan's 12 big commercial banks called
the easier terms for Citibank "reverse discrimination,"
though.</p>
<p>For its part, Citibank, the largest foreign bank in Japan
with nine branches and about 200,000 customers, said it now
plans to expand its Japanese network by about five branches a
year, to a total of about 50. That will give Citibank greater
access to Japan's 400 billion-yen ($2.527 billion) retail
banking industry without forcing the New York-based bank to
pay an exorbitant amount to acquire a Japanese retail bank in
order to get in, as Citibank officials had feared they might
have to.</p>
<p>"Now we can pace ourselves," said Masamoto Yashiro,
Citibank's chief country officer in Japan. "We know what we
are getting into every step of the way."</p>
<p>Separately, Japan's Kyodo news agency reported yesterday
that Citibank will start dollar-denominated loans next week
using bank deposits as collateral, the first such service
inaugurated in Japan.</p>
<p>The Finance Ministry's move was largely symbolic. Mr.
Yashiro said he still hasn't received formal word of a change
in the government policy. But he noted that Citibank already
has noticed that its applications for new branches or branch
relocations this year have been approved in only two months,
down from a normal wait of six months a year ago. "This
formalizes our understanding with the {ministry}," Mr.
Yashiro said.</p>
<p>The rules, which are administrative, not statutory,
prevent banks from opening more than one large new branch or
four neighborhood offices every two years.</p>
<p>With corporate banking on a long, slow decline in Japan,
banks here have been rushing to expand their retail empires.
At the start of this month, two of the country's major banks,
Mitsui Bank Ltd. and Taiyo Kobe Bank Ltd., merged to form
Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank Ltd. the world's second-largest bank,
behind Dai-Ichi Kangyo. The new bank has about 700 retail
branches. Even with 50 branches in Japan, Citibank won't be a
serious competitor to the country's big banks -- and most
smaller Japanese banks have niche or regional client bases.</p>
<p>Foreign banks, which hold about 3% of the Japanese banking
market, specialize in wholesale, or investment, banking
activities, such as money-market and foreign-exchange
trading, loan syndications and other corporate financing.
"That's all we want to do," a spokesman for Chase Manhattan
Bank here said.</p>
<p>Mr. Yashiro said Citibank will continue to focus on those
businesses, but hopes to expand its retail client base to
include individuals who have international dealings or want
to maintain offshore accounts. It began its retail effort
about four years ago, when it shifted a group of employees
from its sagging corporate banking department to a newly
formed retail operation. Early on, it considered buying Heiwa
Sogo, a financially troubled mutual bank that eventually was
sold to Sumitomo Bank Ltd.</p>
<p>At the moment, Citibank's retail operation in Japan isn't
profitable, Mr. Yashiro said. But, he added: "We are heavily
investing today so that maybe in 10 years we will become
truly profitable."</p>
