	<p class="article-leader">BUSH SHOWS little inclination for bold tax or budget
moves.
   He won't decide till early January whether to push a
package of tax cuts and reduced benefits for the upper class
-- but aides bet he won't do it. Some advisers suggest
waiting until after the budget and State of the Union before
deciding whether to submit a recession-fighting package later
in the spring.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Darman focuses on changing spending priorities only at the
margin. He rejects NASA's bid for a new shuttle orbiter, but
allows some low-cost pilot projects like a new Justice
anti-violent-crime program. The economic slump and the cost
of Desert Shield will send the deficit soaring, but the new
budget law doesn't require any remedial action -- and neither
Bush nor Congress is in the mood to try.</p>
<p>"I don't anticipate that 1991 will be a deficit-reduction
year -- happily," says Senate Budget Chairman Sasser.</p>
<p>REPUBLICAN STRIFE spreads to the Senate, depressing Dole.</p>
<p>The minority leader and his brand of senior,
compromise-oriented lawmakers are under mounting pressure
from conservatives such as Lott, Nickles and Kasten, who want
a more partisan and confrontational approach on issues such
as taxes and spending. Witnesses say an angry exchange
erupted between Dole and Wallop at last month's leadership
elections.</p>
<p>Dole is so vexed that he has privately talked with other
senators about retiring rather than seeking re-election to
the Senate in 1992. But his aides dismiss the retirement
talk, pointing to his recent forays to Kansas as hardly the
activities of a lame duck.</p>
<p>LATIN LEADERS blow huge holes in Bush's regional anti-drug
strategy.</p>
<p>Even as he hails progress in the war on drugs, his highly
touted "Andean initiative" is crumbling. Colombia's
government is offering sharply reduced sentences and immunity
from extradition to the U.S. to traffickers who turn
themselves in; U.S. officials watch anxiously to see whether
Medellin cartel leader Fabio Ochoa, who just surrendered,
gets away with a wrist-slap.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, "we aren't where we want to be" in Peru, admits
acting U.S. drug czar John Walters. The military periodically
blocks police from executing joint raids with American drug
agents; President Fujimori refuses U.S. military aid, saying
his country needs economic help instead. And Bolivia's
president refuses to give a big anti-drug role to his
nation's coup-happy military.</p>
<p>A House Government Operations Committee report to be
released today says the U.S. strategy is "failing."</p>
<p>A WHITE HOUSE SHUFFLE is likely in the next few months,
aimed both at fixing the staff machinery and at laying the
groundwork for 1992. One big problem: counsel Boyden Gray's
broad interpretation of the ethics law, which helped push
Bennett out of the GOP chairmanship and could hinder some
aides' move to the campaign. A heated internal debate over
Gray's interpretation is under way.</p>
<p>HOUSE DEMOCRATS mull plans to give tax relief to the
middle class through an expanded IRA deduction, an increase
in the standard deduction or cuts in Social Security payroll
taxes. They also consider a possible anti-recession package,
perhaps using as a vehicle the pending reauthorization of the
highway bill.</p>
<p>CONGRESSIONAL ANGER grows over allies' marginal support
for Gulf operations. Both Senate and House budget panels plan
hearings early next year. Wisconsin Rep. Obey notes that
given the extra oil being pumped at inflated prices, "The
Saudis are still going to wind up when this is over having
made money on the whole problem."</p>
<p>CHOPPING BLOCK? House Democrats say Rep. Jacobs may be
ousted from his chairmanship of the Ways and Means Social
Security subcommittee by the House Democratic Caucus. The
reason: to punish him for his support of the proposed
capital-gains tax cut last year.</p>
<p>NO REPRIEVE: Weapons-buyers feel a huge squeeze despite
the Gulf crisis.</p>
<p>To protect personnel and training accounts, Joint Chiefs
chairman Powell warns the services to slash their five-year
procurement wish-list. Some big projects will have to be
killed in 1992 because money isn't earmarked for them in
later years. The Air Force alone may have to shrink by almost
1,000 planes and cut about $50 billion from its procurement
plans through 1997.</p>
<p>Weapons likely to face the ax include the Air Force's
F-16, which could face a production cutoff, and the Navy's
proposed high-tech replacement for carrier-based F-14
fighters. The Navy's A-12 attack plane is certain to be
delayed. The Army also faces deep cuts in armored vehicles.</p>
<p>Florida Rep. Ireland and other Pentagon critics draft a
bill requiring independent audit teams to validate the
services' cost projections.</p>
<p>MINOR MEMOS: Secretary Skinner spices up a Transportation
Department Christmas party by showing a tape of Madonna's
"Justify My Love" video. . . . While at the tamer Treasury
Department, the press office party features "Brady punch,"
described as "an old New Jersey eggnog that includes
left-over spirits not imbibed at the recent budget
negotiations." . . . Friends of the Earth urges Baker to keep
in mind the "grave environmental consequences" of a Persian
Gulf war. . . . The American Physical Society warns of a
possible budget war between NASA and the National Science
Foundation, dubbing it "Darmageddon."</p>
