	<p class="article-leader">Home computer buyers have long proved an elusive target.
That hasn't changed this Christmas.
   Only a few months ago, makers of personal computers were
predicting a boom in home computer sales, thanks to a new
generation of low-cost, easy-to-use machines.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>International Business Machines Corp. rolled out its new
PS/1 home computer nationwide in the fourth quarter and said
it hoped to sell 200,000 units world-wide during the rest of
the year. The computer giant signed up big mass merchants
Sears and Dillard, along with its regular dealers, to sell
the PS/1. And it backed the machines with millions of dollars
worth of consumer advertising.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as the end of this crucial first Christmas
selling season nears, the returns aren't good. According to
analysts, dealers and others who track computer sales, IBM is
expected to sell between 50,000 and 60,000 PS/1s in the U.S.
this quarter and less than that overseas. Sales of Tandy
Corp.'s 1000 RL, another contestant in the home market, are
expected to wind up in that same range, despite an expensive
ad blitz and the marketing clout of the company's 7,000 Radio
Shack dealers. With dealers saying that supplies of the
machine are plentiful, Tandy has started discounting the $750
to $1,300 1000 RL by as much as $200, depending on the model.</p>
<p>"This is not a home computer Christmas," says Tim Bajarin,
executive vice president of Creative Strategies
International, a market research firm. "These are not
impressive numbers."</p>
<p>Analysts blame the shortfall on a combination of poor
planning and bad economic timing. Computer makers seem to
have misidentified the type of person who needs a computer at
home, analysts say. They focused on selling simple-minded
machines that store recipes to technological novices. But
those people won't spend $1,000 on a computer. The people who
need computers at home are professionals who do some or all
of their work there. But they need more powerful machines.</p>
<p>Even if the average person had an interest in owning a
computer, analysts say, they would be unlikely to respond to
computer makers' pitches. "You don't sell clothes to fat
ladies by showing fat ladies in clothes, and you don't sell
computers to beginners by dumbing down the machines," says
Esther Dyson, editor and publisher of Release 1.0, a
newsletter.</p>
<p>In addition to making these mistakes, computer makers are
suffering from the gloomy U.S. economic climate. With fears
mounting over a war in the Persian Gulf and a recession at
home, sales of home computers, which cost from $750 to
$2,000, are suffering along with other big-ticket items this
Christmas.</p>
<p>IBM and Tandy don't take as dim a view as the analysts.
While IBM refuses to comment on current sales estimates, it
points out that a last-minute buying frenzy before Christmas
could change the outlook sharply. Meanwhile, Tandy's vice
president of marketing, Lowell C. Duncan Jr., insists the
1000 RL is a resounding success for Radio Shack, calling
analysts' expectations "wildly unrealistic."</p>
<p>The one company that seems to have sold a significant
number of machines in this low-priced category is the one
that insists it hasn't targeted the home market. Indeed,
analysts say, Apple Computer Inc.'s more-powerful Macintosh
Classic has been selling quite successfully, shipping well
over 100,000 units since its October introduction, with a
backlog of at least that many machines. While schools and
small businesses have purchased the majority, an estimated
one-third to one-half of the machines have been purchased by
people intending to use them at home, analysts say.</p>
<p>Don Zuckerman, a sales manager in Plano, Texas, says he
bought a Classic for his office and lugs it home to do work
on the weekends. He says that he considered the PS/1 and 1000
RL but opted for the more powerful Classic.</p>
<p>That seems to be a common decision for computer shoppers.
Analysts say IBM is selling far more of its more advanced,
$2,000 versions of the PS/1 than of its $1,000 beginner
model. Tandy dealers echo that theme. "I have a lot of people
come in for the RL and move up to a better machine," says
Libby Bovent, the owner of a franchised Radio Shack store in
Hermiston, Ore.</p>
<p>That phenomenon, analysts insist, provides proof that
people buying computers for home use aren't necessarily
looking for the inexpensive machines that sacrifice power and
capabilities; they're buying them to work at home. Indeed,
the number of work-at-home PCs is expected to grow from about
10 million in 1989 to almost 19 million by 1991, says Link
Resources Corp., a market research firm.</p>
<p>Because of that, analysts predict that computer makers
will be forced to adapt their new machines to this more
demanding market. IBM, for example, is expected to beef up
its PS/1 with more memory and a bigger hard disk, making it
more like the more expensive PS/2. The company wouldn't
comment.</p>
<p>But the lowball sales estimates this Christmas raise the
specter of past failures for computer makers on the home
front. IBM withdrew from an earlier effort in the mid-1980s
after selling only 500,000 of its underpowered PCjrs. Texas
Instruments Inc. absorbed a painful $624 million writeoff
when it dropped its 99/4A home machine back in 1983.</p>
<p>But the possibilities keep luring PC makers, who reason
that their markets would expand exponentially if they could
just find a machine that could convert all those technophobes
determined to sit out the computer revolution.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the technology dropouts continue to be a
tough crowd to sway. Robert Weis, a human services
professional from Hercules, Calif., isn't dropping hints to
loved ones about a computer this year. "I've seen the ads and
I've ignored them," he says adamantly. "I have no use for a
computer, and I don't understand them. I haven't even
mastered my VCR yet."</p>
