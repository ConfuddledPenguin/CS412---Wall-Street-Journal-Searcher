	<p class="article-leader">MONROE, Mich. -- Despite a recent drop in orders, La-Z-Boy
Chair Co. expects to match last year's profit of $6.1
million, or 34 cents a share, for its third quarter ending in
January, said Treasurer Gene M. Hardy.
   However, Mr. Hardy is expecting a profit "slippage" in the
fourth quarter and Chairman Charles T. Knabusch said it is
unlikely the dividend will be increased this fiscal year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The order rate for the company's products dropped about
four weeks ago but company officials are expecting it to
bounce back in January. If that doesn't happen, the company's
earnings could fall 10% or 15% below analysts' predictions of
a profit of $25 million, or $1.40 a share, for the current
fiscal year ending in April, Mr. Knabusch said. If orders do
bounce back, he expects to meet analysts' expectations.</p>
<p>In the last fiscal year, La-Z-Boy earned $28.3 million, or
$1.58 a share. Mr. Hardy said it was now "out of the
question" that the company would match these profits. This
would be the first time the company hadn't increased its
annual profits since 1985.</p>
<p>La-Z-Boy posted a profit of $8.8 million, or 49 cents a
share, in the six months ending Oct. 27. That was down from
year-earlier profit of $11.1 million, or 62 cents a share.
The big drop stemmed largely from one-time costs in the first
quarter to expand and improve several plants, company
officials said.</p>
<p>The company, which last boosted its dividend in September
1989 to 14 cents a quarter, has traditionally raised its
dividend every "four or five quarters," Mr. Knabusch said.
But he said a dividend increase this year was unlikely if the
company's profit falls short of last year's, as expected.</p>
<p>La-Z-Boy, which has a 30% share of the reclining chair
market, expects revenue of roughly $620 million in the
current fiscal year, up from $592 million last year. In
recent years, La-Z-Boy has branched out into bedroom sets and
other hardwood furniture through acquisitions.</p>
<p>However, these new lines of furniture have been harder hit
by the economic slowdown than reclining chairs. In addition,
La-Z-Boy had to take on nearly $50 million in debt to finance
its 1988 purchase of Kincaid Furniture Co. in Hudson, N.C.
The company has since paid down that debt to about $40
million.</p>
<p>La-Z-Boy's capital spending is expected to drop to between
$13 million and $15 million in the next fiscal year from
about $22 million in the current year, Mr. Hardy said.</p>
<p>The company expects hardwood furniture sales will rise
faster than its reclining chair sales in an improving
economy.</p>
