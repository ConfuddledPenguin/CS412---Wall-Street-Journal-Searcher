	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Kent A. Logan, PaineWebber Group Inc.'s
managing director in charge of institutional customers,
resigned from the firm.
   Mr. Logan, who couldn't immediately be reached for
comment, in recent years made a name for himself among
institutional investors. PaineWebber has been one of the main
Wall Street brokerage firms to overhaul the way it charges
big institutional investors for stock trading and research --
for example, by taking away free amenities from less-active
investors. Mr. Logan had emerged as one of Wall Street's
spokesmen on such changes in the institutional equity
business.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>PaineWebber this year overhauled its capital markets
operations, consolidating all its sales, trading and research
operations for stocks and bonds under one umbrella headed by
Charles Milligan and Margo Alexander. As a result, the
authority of some employees was cut. In August, PaineWebber's
head of takeover-stock trading, William Kaye, resigned partly
for this reason.</p>
<p>A PaineWebber spokeswoman confirmed Mr. Logan has left the
firm this week, but declined further comment. A successor to
Mr. Logan hasn't been named.</p>
