	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- Bank of Boston Corp., blaming the slumping New
England economy, said it will show a "substantial loss" for
the fourth quarter, ensuring a loss for the year.
   Although the bank didn't give an estimate of the loss, a
spokesman said it would be smaller than the bank's
third-quarter loss of $255 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I expect this quarter's loss to be somewhere between $150
and $200 million and for the losses to continue in 1991,"
said Gerard Cassidy, a bank analyst with Tucker Anthony and
R.L. Day in Portland, Maine. "The bank's dividend will almost
surely disappear next year." The problems at Bank of Boston,
the region's largest bank, underscores the continuing slide
of results at banks throughout New England, many of which
have reported losses in the past year.</p>
<p>With a weakened real estate market worsened by a sluggish
economy, Bank of Boston was struggling under $1.86 billion of
nonperforming assets, mostly soured commercial real estate
loans, as of Sept. 30.</p>
<p>"The prolonged deterioration in the commerical real estate
markets and the ongoing downturn in the regional economy
continue to adversely affect our operating results," said Ira
Stepanian, chairman and chief executive officer. "However, we
are unwavering in our commitment in this environment to deal
aggressively with credit issues and to maintain what we
believe to be strong loan-loss reserves."</p>
<p>The projected fourth-quarter loss means that the Bank of
Boston, which had a loss of $207.8 million for the first nine
months, will post a sizable loss for all of 1990. Last year
it had net income of $70.4 million, or 80 cents a share,
after a one-time pretax gain of $147 million from the sale of
its credit-card business.</p>
<p>In declaring its third-quarter loss, the bank slashed its
dividend from 31 cents to 10 cents a share. Bank officials
said yesterday that the dividend would be maintained at 10
cents for the payment due in January.</p>
<p>The company's stock closed at $7 a share in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading, down 37.5 cents.</p>
<p>As with many banks in the region, Bank of Boston is
slashing expenses as earnings fall. The bank announced in
September that it planned to reduce its work force by 8%, or
about 1,500 employees, by offering voluntary severance
packages. So far, only about 800 employees have accepted. The
bank said it will now begin a program to lay off at least 700
more employees by the end of next year's first quarter. As
well, the bank announced a deferral of salary increases
affecting at least 5,000 bank officers.</p>
