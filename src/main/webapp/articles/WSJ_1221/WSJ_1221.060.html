	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. said it was so
concerned about U.S. reaction to its purchase of MCA Inc.
that it was prepared to end negotiations if a major political
backlash occurred.
   Masahiko Hirata, the Matsushita executive vice president
who led the company's talks with MCA, said at a news
conference that Matsushita told MCA that if anti-Japanese
sentiment "was going to become a very big issue, we weren't
going to proceed" with the negotiations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Hirata said Matsushita's specific plans for the U.S.
entertainment company, which it agreed last month to acquire
for about $66 a share, or about $6.59 billion, won't be
completed until the takeover is officially finalized,
probably early next month. He reiterated that a main reason
for the MCA purchase was to strengthen development of
Matsushita's high-definition television hardware.</p>
<p>Matsushita has consistently maintained that it will take a
hands-off approach in managing MCA. While both companies will
form an executive committee to devise strategies, Mr. Hirata
said, only a few Matsushita employees will be transferred to
MCA's California headquarters. Akio Tanii, Matsushita's
62-year-old president, recently said the company won't
interfere with the creative independence of MCA's film
producers.</p>
