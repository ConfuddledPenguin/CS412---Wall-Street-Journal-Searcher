	<p class="article-leader">Is hindsight really 20/20? Had there been a United Nations
ready to assemble when Hitler invaded Austria, would the
resolution then have read:
   "Noting that despite all efforts by the United Nations,
Hitler refuses to comply with 11 separate resolutions, the
Security Council therefore:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>(1) demands that Hitler comply with the resolutions;</p>
<p>(2) allows Hitler one final opportunity as a pause of good
will;</p>
<p>(3) authorizes all necessary means to implement the United
Nations resolutions unless Hitler stops by Jan. 15;</p>
<p>(4) requests that states concerned keep the council
regularly informed of progress."</p>
<p>What really has our vision of history taught us?</p>
