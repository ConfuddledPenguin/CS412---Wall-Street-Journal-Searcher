	<p class="article-leader">Nalco Chemical Co. said it agreed to pay Imperial Chemical
Industries PLC $168 million for ICI's interests in joint
ventures between the companies in England, Canada and
Australia.
   Nalco, a Naperville, Ill., specialty chemical maker, now
owns 49% of each venture: Nalfloc in England, Alchem in
Canada and Catoleum in Australia. The ventures, which have
total annual sales of about $185 million, make specialty
chemical products for the mining, waste treatment and other
industries.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A Nalco spokesman said the agreement fits its strategy of
international growth. The spokesman said one-third of Nalco's
1989 sales of $1.07 billion came from abroad, and that the
company wants to increase that to 50% some time in the middle
of the decade.</p>
<p>The transaction, subject to regulatory approval, is
expected to close in the first quarter of 1991.</p>
