	<p class="article-leader">STOCKHOLM -- The chief executive officer of Sweden's
second-largest bank resigned suddenly, intensifying questions
about its recent lackluster financial performance.
   Nordbanken's Rune Barneus, 52, was respected as an
unorthodox but successful banker. But his reputation had been
tarnished in recent months by an acrimonious public battle
with the Swedish Post Office and ballooning loan losses that
forced Nordbanken to slash its forecast for fullyear pretax
profit by 1.2 billion Swedish kronor ($214.9 million), or
37%, late last month.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a statement, Nordbanken's chairman Tony Hagstroem
called those credit losses "disturbing" and added that they
made Mr. Barneus's position "difficult." But the bank, which
is 71%-controlled by the Swedish government, offered no other
explanation for the resignation.</p>
<p>Nordbanken's board was scheduled to meet this afternoon to
discuss a possible successor.</p>
<p>A year ago, Mr. Barneus reached the pinnacle of his career
to date. Nordbanken, under its previous name PK Banken, paid
5.6 billion kronor to acquire Nordbanken, a medium-sized
regional bank of which Mr. Barneus was president. PK Banken's
previous president, Christer Zetterberg, has been lured away
to head automaker AB Volvo. And gaining the services of Mr.
Barneus -- a former senior executive at PK Banken -- was a
key to the Nordbanken purchase.</p>
