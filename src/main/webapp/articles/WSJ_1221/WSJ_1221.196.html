	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- In the figure-an-angle world of corporate
finance, sometimes even the Internal Revenue Service has a
hard time keeping up with Wall Street's deal designers.
   That's apparently what happened in a recent innovative $1
billion debt offering for Procter & Gamble Co.'s employee
stock ownership plan. This offering, which was devised by
Merrill Lynch & Co., the nation's largest securities firm,
received the IRS's blessing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>P&G sold the 30-year debt securities to finance the plan,
which offered a unique structure: It blended an ESOP with
retiree health liability, and was the first time such a
vehicle was used to fund retiree health benefits.</p>
<p>This offering was created because of recent regulatory and
accounting requirements that called for future costs of
retiree medical benefits to be charged as a current expense.
For many large firms, that cost could be huge. The structure
Merrill devised in effect shifts the legal liability for
retiree medical benefits from P&G to its ESOP. And the
dividends and interest that P&G pays to the ESOP are
tax-deductible.</p>
<p>The deal wasn't structured primarily to cut taxes,
according to Tax Notes magazine, but to minimize the amount
of retiree health liabilities that have to be accounted for
currently. P&G's $1 billion trust holding employer securities
will be used to offset a $250 billion retiree health benefits
liability, the magazine said.</p>
<p>But now the IRS is pulling back from its seal of approval
on this offering, apparently because it wants to plug the tax
loophole in Merrill's financing tactic. The agency recently
told its field offices that it was indefinitely suspending
the issuance of similar "determination letters" -- that is,
brief form letters in which the agency tells an applicant
whether a proposed plan meets the standard for tax exemption.</p>
<p>The IRS's stance makes it unlikely that other securities
firms will be able to copy the structure and serves as a
warning signal to others looking to devise similar
structures, tax specialists said.</p>
<p>"The IRS is saying that you proceed at your own risk,"
says David Kautter, a partner at Ernst & Young in Washington.</p>
<p>The tax-collection agency said, in a statement, that the
"IRS is not currently issuing any determination letters on
ESOPs where the stock is used for other than retirement
benefits. The IRS currently is reviewing the issue." The
agency refused to elaborate.</p>
<p>But Richard M. Daly, an IRS employee-benefits expert who
spoke at a recent meeting of tax accountants in Orlando,
Fla., said the agency wants time to consider a number of
issues raised by plans such as P&G's.</p>
<p>Mr. Daly told members of the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants that the issues include "whether
Congress ever intended that" ESOPs be used to finance
retiree-health plans.</p>
<p>Mary Oppenheimer, IRS deputy assistant chief counsel, told
members of the New York Employee Benefits Group late last
month that any IRS challenge to transactions such as
Merrill's P&G deal would be based on health and tax policy,
in addition to technical questions, according to Tax Notes.
The IRS refused to confirm or deny Ms. Oppenheimer's
statements; she couldn't be reached to comment.</p>
<p>Tax specialists said the IRS is concerned that allowing
these kinds of transactions as a primary vehicle for funding
retiree medical benefits could be potentially dangerous.
"People retire and they expect they have money set aside for
retiree medical claims, but it could turn out that the
company's stock could be worth a fraction of what they had
thought," says Mr. Kautter, of Ernst & Young.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch officials declined to comment.</p>

<p>PROCTER & GAMBLE Co.'s retiree health benefits liability
is less than $2 billion, and the company says it retains
legal liability for the retiree medical benefits of its
employee stock ownership plan. P&G's benefits liability was
misstated in the Dec. 13 edition. While the IRS is
reconsidering its letter approving the qualification of P&G's
ESOP plan, that letter hasn't been withdrawn, and P&G is
proceeding with its share repurchase program as outlined to
shareholders.</p>
