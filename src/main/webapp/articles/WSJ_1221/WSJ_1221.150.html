	<p class="article-leader">Sprague Technologies Inc. said it completed the sale of
its semiconductor business and as a result will report a loss
from discontinued operations of about $49 million in the
fourth quarter.
   In the year-ago quarter, Sprague had a net loss of $96.8
million. The company makes capacitors and other electronic
parts.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The good news is that they finally found someone to buy
this business for $58 million in cash, which is a lot of
money for Sprague and offsets their existing debt," said
Charles Neuhauser, an analyst at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc.
in Baltimore.</p>
<p>Sprague, based in Stamford, Conn., said it sold its
semiconductor business to Sanken Electric Co. of Japan as
part of its plan to divest certain unprofitable businesses.
The company said the tax loss from the sale will give it a
net operating loss carry-forward of about $145 million at
year end.</p>
<p>Sprague said it intends to use a portion of the proceeds
to repay bank borrowings. In addition, the company said about
$30 million to $40 million of cash and debt capacity will be
available for further investment in new products and process
improvements for the core businesses.</p>
