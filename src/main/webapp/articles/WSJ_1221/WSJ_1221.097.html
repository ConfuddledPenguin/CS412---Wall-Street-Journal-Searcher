funds rose $889.5 million to $112.10 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Assets of institutional money-market funds continued to
rise briskly, reflecting the "desire by institutional
investors to (take advantage of) the relatively attractive
money-market yields," said Jacob Dreyer, vice president and
chief economist at the institute.</p>
