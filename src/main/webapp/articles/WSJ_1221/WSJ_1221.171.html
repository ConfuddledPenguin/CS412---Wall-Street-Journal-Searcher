	<p class="article-leader">Pan Am Corp. appears to be intensifying its efforts to
receive needed financing.
   It is talking to Trans World Airlines about a special type
of financing that is usually arranged only for bankruptcy
court proceedings, people familiar with the talks said. The
special terms are said to provide for so-called
"debtor-in-possession" backing by TWA.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>This type of financing is arranged for a company that is
seeking reorganization. It normally becomes effective after
the filing of a petition for bankruptcy, subject to
bankruptcy court approval. The lender gets priority liens on
unencumbered assets of the company and typically gets paid
back before other creditors.</p>
<p>Asked whether the company is seeking such a type of
financing, a Pan Am spokesman said, "we are not commenting on
any such speculation." Mark Buckstein, general counsel at
TWA, said, "While we've had discussions with Pan Am, it's
premature to comment further on those discussions."</p>
<p>Pan Am's board is said to have discussed filing for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection during a morning
meeting this past Wednesday. Thus far, Pan Am has confirmed
only that its board met and that it discussed the TWA
proposal, as well as developments in the $400 million sale of
Pan Am's London operations and other assets to UAL Corp.'s
United Airlines.</p>
<p>Pan Am is said also to be asking United to extend it some
financing, but the larger carrier is skittish about giving
the struggling line any money for fear it will be at risk if
Pan Am ceases operations.</p>
<p>People familiar with Pan Am agreed the airline desperately
needs cash to cover daily costs and other debts. Like the
rest of the industry, Pan Am is being pinched by high jet
fuel costs, the company's second-largest expense behind
labor.</p>
<p>It has outstanding bills to Airbus Industrie, the European
aircraft consortium; United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt &
Whitney engine-making unit and the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corp., a government agency that insures pension plans.</p>
<p>The TWA talks pertain to a merger proposal TWA owner Carl
Icahn sent Pan Am Chairman Thomas Plaskett this past Sunday.
Mr. Icahn proposed buying Pan Am's 150 million shares
outstanding for $1.50 a share in cash and $1 a share in
preferred stock or notes. That amounts to $225 million in
cash and $100 million, at the most, in subordinated notes.
The offer is slated to expire today, though Mr. Icahn may
extend it.</p>
<p>Pan Am executives are said to have told Mr. Icahn that Pan
Am needed some sort of bridge loan as part of any merger
proposal. A bridge loan is a type of short-term financing
that borrowers repay after they get a longer-term loan or
cash from the sale of assets.</p>
