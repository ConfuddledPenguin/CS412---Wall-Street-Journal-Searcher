	<p class="article-leader">Federal Express Corp. reported a slight increase in
earnings for the second quarter ended Nov. 30, surprising
analysts who had expected a drop of as much as 25%.
   The Memphis, Tenn., express-delivery company reported net
income edged up 1.3% to $37.5 million, or 71 cents a share,
from $37 million, or 70 cents a share, in the year-earlier
period. Revenue rose 16% to $1.99 billion from $1.72 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Earnings rose despite slower volume growth, continued
losses from its overseas operations, and a $73 million, or
54%, rise in fuel costs from last year.</p>
<p>"The quarter was better than expected, but given the
economy and the very muddled outlook for petroleum prices,
they're not out of the woods yet," said David M. Guthrie,
analyst with Morgan, Keegan Inc. in Memphis.</p>
<p>Indeed, after releasing earnings late yesterday afternoon,
FedEx reported that its average daily volume during November
was up a scant 3.8% from the year before. That growth rate
compares with 9% in October and 16% to 20% earlier this year.</p>
<p>The company said cost cutting, including reduced overtime
and fewer part-time workers' hours, helped offset the
overseas losses and slower revenue growth. Salaries and
benefits dropped to $846 million from $861 million in the
first quarter.</p>
<p>The results "reflect the concerted efforts of all of our
employees to improve productivity and reduce expenses in a
very difficult environment," said Frederick W. Smith, chief
executive officer.</p>
<p>Federal Express also was helped by its participation in
the Operation Desert Shield buildup of military forces in the
Middle East, though the company wouldn't specify how much
that contributed to earnings. A spokesman said the charter
business added "at least" $10 million more to revenue than it
did last year.</p>
<p>George V. Robertson, analyst with Alex. Brown & Sons Inc.
in Baltimore, said that by diverting four 747s to Desert
Shield, Federal Express likely gained efficiency in the rest
of its fleet, since the company had extra capacity.</p>
<p>"If you get extra hours out of each plane, that's all to
the good, especially if the planes are flying full," he said.</p>
<p>Also helping FedEx was a lower tax rate, which the
spokesman said resulted from the reorganization of the
company's international corporate structure. Second-quarter
profit before tax dropped to $76.6 million from $80.8 million
a year earlier.</p>
<p>The company didn't quantify its international losses, but
Morgan Keegan's Mr. Guthrie said FedEx officials told
analysts that results didn't improve from a year ago.</p>
