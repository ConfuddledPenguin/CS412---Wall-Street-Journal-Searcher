	<p class="article-leader">Newmont Mining Corp. told analysts in New York that its
gold unit expects to produce 1.5 million ounces in 1991, down
about 200,000 ounces from this year.
   The company had estimated it would produce 1.54 million
ounces of gold in 1990, but that projection was increased to
1.7 million ounces in July. Production in 1990 rose because
an old leach pad at the Gold Quarry mine produced more than
the company expected in 1990. Gordon R. Parker, chairman and
chief executive officer, told analysts that the leach pad
can't be expected to do the same in 1991.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Parker said 1991 cash costs for gold production will
be under $240 an ounce, compared with $215 in 1990. Energy,
labor and material costs will increase, he said.</p>
