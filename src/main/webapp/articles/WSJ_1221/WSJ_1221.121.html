	<p class="article-leader">SANTA CRUZ, Calif. -- All across the country, universities
have been confronting the problems posed by an increasingly
diverse and contentious society. The future may have already
arrived at the University of California at Santa Cruz.
   Two years ago, at one of Santa Cruz's eight residential
colleges, there was what came to be known as the "Asian Food
Affair." A dinner with Asian (some say, Philippine) food and
themes was planned for early December. A staff member noticed
that the date coincided with Pearl Harbor Day and, following
her suggestion, the Asian celebration was postponed and the
menu changed. When word of the change got out, there were
demonstrations by students in another college, and letters
were written to the press charging racial insensitivity and
racism (for grouping all Asians together, and for seemingly
blaming the living for the actions of certain Japanese long
ago).</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Despite apologies, claims of good intentions and the fact
that the staff member who had recommended the change was
herself of Japanese descent, the champions of tolerance
showed little tolerance. Charges and counter-charges
proliferated, there were resignations, lawsuits and serious
illness induced by stress. The memory lingers.</p>
<p>Last year, five professors of good will, with diverse
backgrounds and from different fields (biology, philosophy,
literature, linguistics and sociology), got together in an
effort to design an innovative course to meet the challenge
of growing ethnic diversity in the student body and the
growing need for multicultural understanding in the society
at large. They put together a two-quarter "World Culture"
course that studies a number of different societies from a
number of different perspectives. Now a required "core"
course for freshmen at one of Santa Cruz's colleges, the
course is meant to be a model for new multicultural
campus-wide courses. It is being taught this year for the
first time.</p>
<p>Signs of trouble emerged early. One professor, a
biologist, began a lecture about Darwin with an apology for
speaking about the work of a "dead white male." The same
professor (himself a living white male, originally from
Canada) choked with emotion at a session with other
professors and graduate teaching assistants over the fact
that he was not a member of any oppressed minority.</p>
<p>A few weeks into the course, another of the professors (a
former Jesuit from Spain) spoke about Islam. As his final
topic, he considered the role of women in Islam, reading
passages from the Koran and from the statutes enacted in Iran
with the coming of the Ayatollah Khomeini. As might be
guessed, the depiction was rather grim.</p>
<p>After the class, the lecturer received a letter from
another professor in the course (self-described as a "scholar
of color," he is a sociologist who studies race and is
himself black) complaining that he was "deeply disturbed" by
the lecture. He asked for half of the next lecture to
respond. The lecturer refused to yield his time.</p>
<p>Then there came another of the sessions of professors with
graduate student teaching assistants. The scholar of color
rose and announced that he had been "deeply disturbed" by the
lecture on Islam. He proceeded to spell out what had
disturbed him. It turned out that he did not disagree with
any of the statements the lecturer had made. He believed that
all of the quotations from texts were accurate. Rather, he
was upset at what had been left out. In particular, he noted,
no mention had been made of the fact that the U.S. kills
people in the electric chair, that it had dropped the atom
bomb on people of another race, that for a long period it had
practiced slavery and so on.</p>
<p>One might have expected the professor who had lectured on
Islam to acknowledge that the U.S. had indeed committed
atrocities in its time, and that it was in many ways as harsh
in its treatment of certain people as some less secularized
Islamic societies may be in their treatment of women, and
then perhaps to have gone on to indicate that it is not
possible to say everything (however true and important) all
the time and in every context.</p>
<p>But he did not. Instead, he said that while he formerly
had respected the scholar of color, he felt that what was
going on here was a "power play." He charged that the scholar
of color was attempting to set himself up as a standard of
political correctness and conscientious pluralism, allowing
no leeway for those who would make criticisms of another
society (especially if they could not themselves claim to be
among the oppressed). He particularly resented that the
criticism of his lecture had been aimed not at what was said
but at what was not said. When would such bullying criticism
not be in place? Never mind that the two might well agree
about the problems and even horrors of American society. The
ex-Jesuit then walked out.</p>
<p>Animosities and recriminations flew. People took sides. It
happened that the scholar of color was scheduled to give the
next lecture. Since all the professors (as part of this
innovative model course) regularly attended each other's
lectures (to help establish recurring themes), the ex-Jesuit
threatened that he would walk out in as noticeable a way as
possible if the scholar of color used the occasion to
criticize him before the undergraduates for what he had not
said in his lecture on Islam. The ex-Jesuit was persuaded not
to attend -- but had someone record the lecture for him. The
scholar of color also had the lecture recorded. Apparently
nothing untoward was said.</p>
<p>While there have been meetings and reconciliations since,
the scholar of color subsequently announced his resignation
from the course, and will not be participating next quarter.
All this in a model course designed to teach students new
approaches to cross-cultural understanding and pluralistic
sensitivity. The former Jesuit, who had grown up in Spain and
taught in Germany and Japan before coming to California,
concluded: "These days, it is not possible to be pluralistic
enough."</p>
<p>Most recently, two residential colleges pooled resources
to have a "Native American College Night." One might have
thought that this pre-Thanksgiving event was a nicely timed
effort to look at things from another side. It produced an
angry letter to the campus paper from the "Student Alliance
of North American Indians," complaining of the failure of the
colleges to "fully involve" the organization in the planning
of the event. The performance was described as "mediocre,"
and the alliance declared "we cannot support or condone
events which do not involve Native-Americans in the planning
process."</p>
<p>Does one have to be a member of a given minority in order
to understand that minority, or to say anything about it? In
a university?</p>
<p>I mentioned at the beginning that the World Culture course
is being offered as a "core" course at one of Santa Cruz's
residential colleges. It is the same college that was the
site of the "Asian Food Affair" (and thus was presumably in
special need of multicultural sensitivity and understanding).
There is now apparently a question about whether the college
will sponsor the World Culture core course for its originally
planned second quarter. The second quarter was supposed to
include consideration of Japanese culture. People are
nervous. . . .</p>
