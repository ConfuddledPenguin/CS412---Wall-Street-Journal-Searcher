	<p class="article-leader">BSD Bancorp said it plans to increase its loan-loss
reserves by about $1 million, resulting in "minimal"
fourth-quarter profit.
   For the full year, the San Diego bank holding company
expects profit to be about equal to nine-month profit of $3.4
million. Fourth-quarter profit last year was $1.4 million, or
40 cents a share; full-year profit was $4 million, or $1.13 a
share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company said its reserve increases include $721,000 in
commercial loan write-offs at Bank of San Diego and other
"special reserves" to provide "additional cushion for the
anticipated recessionary environment" next year.</p>
<p>BSD said its three major banks, including Bank of San
Diego, recently underwent examinations by representatives of
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and that "all charge-offs
directed by the regulators have been taken."</p>
