	<p class="article-leader">AUSTIN, Texas -- The Prodigy electronic network has agreed
to pay $12,500 to the Texas Attorney General's office and
refund money to certain Texas subscribers who may have been
misled by its ads.
   Prodigy, a White Plains, N.Y., joint venture of the
Armonk, N.Y., computer company International Business
Machines Corp. and the Chicago retailer Sears, Roebuck & Co.,
said in September that it would charge subscribers a fee of
25 cents for each personal electronic mail message in excess
of 30 per month. In the same month, Prodigy mailed about
700,000 ads to Texans, saying electronic mail was free, the
attorney general's office said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A Prodigy spokesman said the increased fees were
accurately portrayed to customers and necessary because some
network users were sending out thousands of promotional
messages. Prodigy agreed to settle because charges filed
under the state's deceptive trade practices act would have
been too expensive to defend against, the spokesman said.
Prodigy expects to refund only a few thousand dollars to
users. The payment to the Attorney General's office is
intended to reimburse the agency for investigative costs.</p>
<p>Last month, Prodigy banned at least seven people who had
protested an increase in its electronic-mail charges. Several
of the banned individuals organized a dissident group that
collected 19,000 supporters.</p>
