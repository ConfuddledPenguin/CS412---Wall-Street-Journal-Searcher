	<p class="article-leader">MADRID -- When Mexican-born designer Rene Zamudio arrived
here four years ago, the first thing he did was ask
directions to the garment district.
   "They sent me to a zipper store down the street," says
32-year-old Mr. Zamudio, who came to Madrid after
free-lancing on New York's Seventh Avenue. "That's the way
things were."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Although Madrid is a far cry from Milan and Paris, Spanish
fashion has gained growing international recognition in
recent years. Designers such as Mr. Zamudio have become
regulars at fashion shows in Europe and Japan, and their
collections have won world-wide praise. This sudden flurry of
interest has raised government hopes that Spain is on its way
to becoming an important force in European design.</p>
<p>As the experiences of many Spanish designers illustrate,
however, critical acclaim doesn't always attract the
financial and industrial backing that designers need to
survive in a competitive market. Nor does it necessarily
translate into growing sales, particularly at home where
fashion has traditionally meant French, Italian or German
design.</p>
<p>"Spain has a strong cultural force that has been a source
of inspiration for many foreign designers," says Maria Jesus
Escribano, director of the government's Center for the
Promotion of Design and Fashion. "But Spain is still in the
process of creating its own fashion culture."</p>
<p>Glossy advertising campaigns, scholarships abroad and two
annual fashion shows, one in Madrid and the other in
Barcelona, are the mainstay of an eight billion pesetas ($84
million) government plan designed to promote Spanish fashion
at home and abroad. Last year the apparel industry, including
footwear, jewelry, leather goods, textiles, clothing and
accessories, employed 430,000 people and posted sales of
three trillion pesetas, equivalent to 7% of Spain's gross
domestic product. The government hopes quality and design
will ensure a place for Spanish apparel in foreign markets,
just the way low prices have in the past.</p>
<p>The mixed success of the plan's first five years
underscores many of the problems facing Spanish industry as
it gears up for Europe's single market after 1992. The
government's program has stirred international interest in
Spanish fashion, and some designers have flourished. But it
has failed to smooth out many problems that keep the industry
at a disadvantage with other European countries.</p>
<p>A shortage of financing, poor quality and a lack of
professionalism on the part of retailers, manufacturers and
some designers have brought several struggling clothes
businesses to their knees.</p>
<p>"The general rule in Spain is that industry isn't prepared
to sell or produce a quality product," says Jesus del Pozo,
44, one of Spain's veteran designers.</p>
<p>Antonio Alvarado, wardrobe designer for several movies by
Spanish film director Pedro Almodovar, says debts forced him
to close shop temporarily last year until one of a few
industry backers bailed him out. Now that he has secured
financial and industrial support, Mr. Alvarado hopes he can
produce more at lower prices.</p>
<p>Mr. Alvarado was one of the lucky ones. In October,
designer Manuel Pina decided to give up the fashion business
due to mounting debts. The move came after a financial battle
with his manufacturer, who prevented him from meeting a 1.5
billion peseta order from a Japanese client. "I'm the first
one to fall," he said. "But I don't think I'll be the last."
Now he is designing uniforms for Spain's postal service.</p>
<p>In the case of Enrique Loewe, the chairman of Spain's
144-year-old leather goods and clothing store Loewe, it's
often easier to fly to Milan to do business than to deal
directly with Spanish industry.</p>
<p>But Mr. Loewe, who has worked with top European designers
such as Karl Lagerfeld and Giorgio Armani, doesn't limit his
criticism to industrialists. Many Spanish designers, he says,
don't have sufficient training or discipline to survive in a
competitive market. Others, he says, have lost touch with
their clients. "In Spain many {designers} experiment too
much, they bet too heavily on clothes that are difficult to
wear," he says. "There's a lack of interchange" with clients.</p>
<p>Adds Mr. Zamudio: "We have a really bad reputation in the
U.S. I know what it's like to work in a store; when you don't
get a delivery it's a disaster, and here they don't
understand the damage it does."</p>
<p>To avoid problems of quality and late delivery, several
Japanese buyers have expressed interest in acquiring the
rights to produce Spanish designer clothes in Japan, where
Spanish fashion is enjoying an unprecedented boom. Many
designers feel their salvation lies in similar arrangements
abroad, particularly in promising markets such as Germany and
some Asian countries, where they feel appreciated by both
consumers and industrialists.</p>
<p>For their part, textile manufacturers claim they can't
accept the risks of financing the fashion industry. Not only
are designers often considered inexperienced and
unprofessional, but a strong peseta, high interest rates and
onerous social security payments are said to stack the cards
against them in an increasingly competitive world. Analysts
expect hundreds of Spain's 15,000 textile and clothing
manufacturers to fold in coming years because of growing
costs and slumping sales.</p>
<p>Niki Bosch of the Barcelona textile company Niki Bosch Mir
says: "The environment is this: a strong peseta and high
interest rates. But we have to make a product that enables us
to overcome these problems."</p>
<p>Thanks to Spain's import barriers and cheap labor, many
manufacturers expanded rapidly in the past, but have failed
to adapt to new market conditions and changing consumer
tastes.</p>
<p>Since joining the European Community in 1986, Spain's
economy began to prosper. In that period, its tastes have
evolved rapidly, a fact many manufacturers don't seem to
realize. Spaniards, for example, are once again demanding
natural fabrics, which fell out of use during Spain's
economic boom in the 1960s. At that time, synthetics formed
part of Spain's entry into the modern world of mass
production.</p>
<p>The weak link between design and industry also has
resulted in a dearth of funding for struggling designers.
Though the government provides scholarships abroad and other
financial help, the fashion industry is still short of funds.</p>
<p>But designers say they don't expect the government to
clear the way for them. Instead, they say, the key to the
future lies with cementing solid relations with retailers and
industry, and seeking new markets abroad. Although the future
looks difficult, the worst appears to be in the past.</p>
<p>"We had to work in circumstances that almost nobody else
could have survived," says Roberto Verinno, a designer from
Galicia who is well-known internationally. "Our {experience}
is almost a miracle."</p>
