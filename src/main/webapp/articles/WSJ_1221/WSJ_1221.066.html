	<p class="article-leader">Former Hizzoner Ed Koch didn't think much of "The Bonfire
of the Vanities" in his movie review on our Leisure & Arts
page. As the movie opens today, don't expect to see many
testimonials from the other suspected models for characters
in the book. The real-life tough Bronx Judge Burton Roberts
calls the movie a "farce." The Rev. Al Sharpton (Rev.
Reginald Bacon in the book) told the New York Post it was a
"perfect racist plot." There are no reports so far from any
of the likely models for the Wall Street Master of the
Universe or from any overzealous former prosecutors.
   For his part, author Tom Wolfe has kept mum about what
Hollywood in the 1990s did to his vision of New York in the
'80s. He apparently took the sage advice to book authors on
how to sell movie rights: Make an appointment at the Nevada
border, toss the manuscript over, never set foot in
California, and go back to writing.</p>
