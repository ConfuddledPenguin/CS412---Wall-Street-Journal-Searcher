	<h3>Poor Regions Uneasy on European Unity --- New Policies May Hurt Areas Like Southern Italy</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">ISERNIA, Italy -- Tucked into the rocky hills of Molise,
the apparel factory of Manifatture Ittierre S.p.A. forms a
monument to the Italian government's generosity.
   Working in marble and glass offices, designers toy with
new fashion concepts on multicolor computer screens.
State-of-the-art cutting machines slice through swaths of
cloth, then feed segments to stitching devices that turn them
into Trussardi jeans and other garments. In a vast packaging
room, robot-assisted assembly lines box shipments destined
for a customer base that stretches from Moscow to New York.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The Italian government was responsible for 70% of the
building and expansion costs" over the past decade, says
Antonio Arcaro, the plant's general director. And the
operation is spared all but about 15% of the social-security
taxes other enterprises normally pay. Similar arrangements
proliferate throughout the Mezzogiorno, Italy's
underdeveloped South.</p>
<p>But whether such largess will continue is in doubt. One
byproduct of the European Community's rapid program of
unification is that the poorer regions are facing new
hardships. Earlier this month, EC leaders met in Rome and
formally launched a treaty-amending conference to pave the
way toward a single currency and central banking authority.
But the push toward unity brings with it a dose of hardship:
Italy will come under pressure to shrink its mammoth budget
deficit and to cut the $10 billion or so it transfers to the
South each year. The Mezzogiorno, like other less developed
regions, could fall even further behind the more prosperous
European economies.</p>
<p>The ramifications reach well beyond the comparatively
deprived areas themselves. Big disparities in income, living
standards and inflation levels make it harder for the EC to
build a cohesive economic block, bound together by a single
currency and a central monetary policy. As the gaps widen,
the community will face the choice of slowing its push toward
unification or doling out more money to the poorer regions.</p>
<p>Adding to the potential disruptions in the
monetary-integration effort is the general slowdown in the
world economy and the jolts arising from higher oil prices.
"Discord is fueled by recessions," notes Richard O'Brien,
chief economist with American Express Bank in London. "The
halcyon days of the EC are in times of economic growth.
Remember that when we hit the 1970s, unity disappeared."</p>
<p>The buzzword for the catch-up therapy the EC's poorer
regions are seeking is "economic convergence." Among those
most in need are southern Italy, Greece and parts of
Portugal, Spain and Ireland.</p>
<p>Despite Europe's eight-year economic expansion, many
regions, like the Mezzogiorno, still lag behind the EC's
prosperous center. Grants and subsidies from Rome have
enticed such global giants as International Business Machines
Corp., Ing. C. Olivetti & Co. and Unilever PLC into the
Mezzogiorno. Still, Italy remains a divided nation
economically. Unemployment in the South is running at about
21.3% -- more than three times the 5.8% level in Italy's
North. Each year, the Mezzogiorno sees a net outmigration of
50,000 people, as the young flock northward for jobs.</p>
<p>More broadly, EC figures show a discouraging trend: The 25
richest and 25 poorest regions in the community were slightly
further apart in per-capita income at the end of 1988 than
they were in 1980. (EC officials point out that many of the
neediest areas are in Greece, whose economy deteriorated
during the 1980s and pulled down the average.)</p>
<p>For the poorer regions -- which have depended on subsidies
and, often, currency devaluations to keep going -- it will be
a shock to shift to an economic and monetary union in which
the staunchly anti-inflationary Bundesbank dictates
priorities. "The South of Italy has a weak economic
structure," says Stefano Micossi, chief economist with
Cofindustria, an industry association in Rome. "It's not
clear how, under current policies, it could stand the impact
of open markets and monetary union."</p>
<p>By all accounts, efforts to lessen such strains will drive
up the EC's costs. "Poorer countries could find that economic
and monetary union could damage them rather than help them,"
says Bruce Millan, the EC's regional commissioner. Part of
the price of full European integration, he argues, must be a
"greater transfer of resources to the poorer regions."</p>
<p>To this end, the European Regional Development Fund -- the
EC's main vehicle for helping out poorer areas -- is being
doubled, to about $68 billion. The money will be spent over
the next four years on such projects as roads and industrial
parks. But EC officials say this increase is probably much
too small, and there is talk of another doubling before full
monetary union comes into effect.</p>
<p>Locking the entire community into a single currency
guarded by staunchly anti-inflationary central bankers is
indeed certain to cause pain in the poorest regions.
Historically, developing economies have kept their currencies
cheap so that they could build up exports while they
modernized their industries. A single currency takes away
that option.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there would be a single interest rate for the
EC. If the economy got overheated in the EC's developed core,
the central bank would likely increase interest rates for the
entire community -- even though such a move would hit harder
on the less developed periphery, where unemployment is
already much higher than in the center.</p>
<p>No one can say how severe these setbacks will be or how
much the EC will end up doling out to alleviate the
hardships. In the Mezzogiorno, there are worries that the EC
won't be as generous as the Italian government has been,
particularly if Portugal, Greece and other regions are
competing for funds.</p>
<p>Another problem for southern Italy is organized crime,
which often gets involved in how public funds are spent.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the tough times that many predict, support
for European integration is strong in Italy. Italians favor
common European policies, including a single currency, by a
wider margin than any other nation, EC polls show.</p>
<p>"We are optimistic by nature," says Mariano D'Antonio,
head of Monitor Srl, an economic research firm in Naples.
"What is urgent, we do immediately; what is impossible, we do
tomorrow; what requires a miracle -- we try to prepare
ourselves."</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Mr. D'Antonio thinks the Mezzogiorno and
other less developed regions will be in for a shock when
monetary union actually comes. "Few people are aware," he
says. "Under monetary union, the prevailing view will be the
Bundesbank's. They refuse to finance large government
deficits or to finance governments' transfers to enterprises.
They refuse to finance governments' transfers to poor
households."</p>
<p>He goes on to predict that under the "dictatorship" of
Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl there will be higher
unemployment and reduced government support.</p>
<p>At the Bank of Italy, officials strongly support the move
to a unified monetary policy dominated by the Bundesbank.
Says one official, "What our politicians haven't been able to
achieve in 20 years, Europe or Mr. Poehl can achieve for us"
-- namely, a smaller budget deficit and a stronger currency.</p>
