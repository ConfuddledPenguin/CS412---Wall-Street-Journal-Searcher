	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Sunshine Mining Co. said a subsidiary formed a
joint venture with a subsidiary of Mallon Resources Corp. and
Red Rock Ventures Inc., to explore for gold in the Guanacaste
Province of Costa Rica.
   Pending the analysis of results from a 36-hole drilling
program, Sunshine Mining has the option to acquire a 50%
interest in and become manager of the venture. If Sunshine
chooses to proceed, Mallon will retain a 35% interest in the
project and Red Rock Ventures will retain a 15% stake.</p>
