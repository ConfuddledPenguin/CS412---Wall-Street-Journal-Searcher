	<p class="article-leader">New York Times Co. said it will raise the daily price of
its flagship newspaper's national edition to 75 cents in the
Midwest and the Southwest.
   A company spokeswoman said the price increases are the
result of higher costs for production and distribution. The
increases go into effect Jan. 14. The Times had been charging
50 cents for daily copies of its national edition in the
Midwest and 60 cents in the Southwest.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The price for the national edition in the Southeast was
raised to 75 cents last September, but the national edition
on the West Coast will remain at 50 cents. The daily paper
costs 50 cents in the Northeast, except in the tri-state area
near New York, where it is 40 cents.</p>
<p>Major newspapers, including The Wall Street Journal, have
for the first time in years raised their daily price. Last
week, Times executives said they would study "pricing
strategies" for the New York Times, but no price increase was
planned in New York.</p>
