	<p class="article-leader">In three closely watched labor-law cases, the California
Supreme Court delivered two rulings that favor employers and
one that aids employees.
   The court issued two rulings that could limit employees'
ability to seek damages for emotional distress stemming from
wrongful discharge. But in a third case, the court ruled that
an employee can bypass the state civil-rights agency to sue
in the courts for wrongful-discharge damages in sexual
harassment cases.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The cases were important to businesses because they speak
to an expensive problem: employees seeking increasingly large
damages for "pain and suffering" caused by wrongful
termination.</p>
<p>The court's rulings were "a mixed bag," said Paul
Grossman, general counsel for the California Employment Law
Council, an association of major businesses. But they
"indicate that California isn't going to be way out in crazy
land by itself with respect to compensatory and punitive
damages in routine discharge disputes."</p>
<p>In one case, Shoemaker vs. Myers, the court ruled that, if
an employee sues for damages stemming from wrongful
termination, any disabling injuries -- mental or physical --
fall under the coverage of workers' compensation, which
strictly limits the amount of money that can be awarded. But
the court ruled that an employee can sue for damages outside
workers' compensation if there are statutory exceptions or if
the discharge resulted from risks that aren't within the
compensation bargain.</p>
<p>Jack Shoemaker, an investigator with the state health
department, was fired in 1981 after he reported a superior's
illegal activities. Reinstated the next year, Mr. Shoemaker
sued for damages for emotional distress and humiliation. The
court ruled that, under the state's statutes to protect
"whistle blowers," Mr. Shoemaker is allowed to sue for
damages outside the provisions of workers' compensation.</p>
<p>Although it is a victory for whistleblowers, the ruling
was seen as a confirmation of the increasingly conservative
tone taken by California's high court, which has eviscerated
thousands of lawsuits by employees seeking punitive damages
for wrongful discharge. Until now, though, the use of
compensatory damages for "pain and suffering" remained "the
one area of possible tort recovery that could really sting
employers," said Stanford University labor-law Prof. William
Gould. With the Shoemaker ruling, "they've deprived
plaintiffs of one of their most important weapons."</p>
<p>In a second case, the Court ruled that the state civil
rights commission doesn't have the right to award damages for
emotional distress for employment discrimination. In the
case, a temporary secretary, Rose Brown, charged that she was
sexually harassed by a superior at Peralta Community College
where she worked in 1981 and 1982. The Fair Employment and
Housing commission awarded Ms. Brown $20,000 in damages, an
award that was overruled by a trial court, which argued that
the commission couldn't award damages for trauma and
humiliation. Overturned in an appeal, the ruling was
reinstated by the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The third case, Rojo vs. Kliger, involved an employee,
Emma Rojo, who charged that she refused her employer's
demands for sexual favors, which ultimately forced her to
quit the job. The Court ruled that the sexual harassment
involved violated Ms. Rojo's common law rights and therefore
that Ms. Rojo can bypass the provisions of the state civil
rights act and sue for damages in court.</p>

<p>PHILIPPINES SETTLES litigation over Marcos properties in
Manhattan.</p>
<p>The Philippine government sued Ferdinand Marcos and his
wife, Imelda, in 1986, accusing them of buying four Manhattan
buildings with funds stolen from the Philippines. Mr. Marcos
was ousted as president of the Philippines in 1986, and he
and his family fled to the U.S. Mr. Marcos died in 1989.</p>
<p>The settlement also ends other related litigation,
including a lawsuit brought by Joseph and Ralph Bernstein
seeking money from the Marcos buildings. The Bernsteins are
real estate developers who managed some of the Marcos
properties.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the settlement, the Philippines
apparently will get far less than the $160 million of
allegedly stolen money that it claims the Marcoses spent to
acquire the buildings. Two of the buildings have already been
sold, but delays resulted in a much lower price than the
Philippine government had expected.</p>
<p>The settlement states that if the money from the sale of
the buildings totals $10.8 million or less, the Philippines
will receive 47% of the total, and the Bernstein interests
will receive 20%. The rest will go to Karl Peterson, an
attorney who works for Saudi businessman Adnan Khashoggi, who
was acquitted last year of illegally helping Mrs. Marcos
conceal her ownership of the buildings. Mr. Peterson's
company also claimed a stake in the buildings. At trial in
federal court in Manhattan, Mrs. Marcos also was cleared of
any wrongdoing in the transactions.</p>
<p>If the buildings bring more than $10.8 million, the
additional money will be divided with 55% going to the
Philippines, 40% to the Bernstein interests, and 5% to Mr.
Peterson.</p>
<p>The settlement doesn't state how much money actually will
be available from the sale of the buildings, after
maintenance costs and other expenses. The total amount,
however, is expected to be between $10 million and $11
million.</p>
<p>The settlement says that the money turned over to the
Philippines "will be paid in recognition of its claim . . .
for monies stolen from the Philippines by Ferdinand Marcos,
Imelda Marcos and certain other non-settling parties."</p>
<p>Jeffrey Greenbaum, an attorney for the Philippines, said
the settlement was a "moral vindication" of the Philippine
government's position.</p>

<p>CASINO UNION SAYS it is outraged by government charges of
mob domination.</p>
<p>"Any allegations that individuals other than {the union's}
membership have influence on our activities are totally
false," said Roy Silbert, the president of New Jersey Local
54 of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees International Union,
at a news conference yesterday.</p>
<p>The Justice Department filed a civil racketeering suit on
Wednesday against the local, union officers and organized
crime figures. Filed in federal court in Trenton, N.J., the
suit alleges that for the last 20 years the 22,000-member
local has been controlled by a Philadelphia-based organized
crime family and that the family's head, Nicodemo Scarfo, is
running the local now from his federal prison cell.</p>
<p>The suit calls for a court-appointed trustee to take
control of union affairs. Local 54 represents bartenders,
hotel employees and casino workers in Atlantic City and other
New Jersey towns.</p>
<p>Mr. Silbert, the local's president for six years, called
the suit "an attempt at government takeover, reflecting the
worst in totalitarianism."</p>
<p>The union, he said, has told its lawyers at the
Philadelphia law firm Meranze & Katz "to do whatever is
necessary to stop this inexplicable government attempt to
create a media circus."</p>

<p>MICHAEL MILKEN APPEALS 10-year prison sentence.</p>
<p>As expected, attorneys for Mr. Milken asked the U.S.
Second Circuit Court of Appeals to review the sentence,
handed down last month by U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood. Mr.
Milken, formerly head of the junk-bond operation at Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., pleaded guilty in April to six felonies
related to securities transactions.</p>
<p>Judge Wood said she would consider reducing the sentence
if Mr. Milken cooperated. At the time of his guilty plea, Mr.
Milken also agreed to pay $600 million in fines and
restitution.</p>
<p>Oral arguments on the appeal are scheduled for the week of
March 18.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>PICTURE-TAKING in federal court in Manhattan will begin in
July.</p>
<p>The U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals and the U.S.
district court in Manhattan have been selected as test courts
for plans to allow still and video cameras in the federal
courts. Although some state courts allow cameras in
courtrooms, they currently aren't permitted in federal court.</p>
<p>Another federal appeals court and five other district
courts are expected to take part in the three-year program,
which will apply only to civil cases.</p>
