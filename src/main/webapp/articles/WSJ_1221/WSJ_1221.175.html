	<p class="article-leader">Quick & Reilly Group Inc., New York, citing negative
fallout from the Persian Gulf crisis, posted a 25% decline in
fiscal third-quarter net income on a 22% drop in revenue.
   Net income in the quarter, ended Nov. 30, was $2.1
million, or 22 cents a share, down from $2.8 million, or 29
cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue fell to
$22.8 million from $29.3 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the nine months, net income fell 1% to $8.8 million,
or 93 cents a share, from $8.9 million, or 94 cents a share.
Revenue rose 4% to $83.1 million from $79.9 million.</p>
<p>The brokerage company blamed the decline on lower
commission and interest income, because of investor caution
after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August.</p>

Reilly closed at $11, up 50 cents.</p>
