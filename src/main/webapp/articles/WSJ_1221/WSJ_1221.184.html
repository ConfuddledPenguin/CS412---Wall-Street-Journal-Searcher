	<p class="article-leader">It's a question that home buyers and homeowners alike are
wondering about in these perilous economic times: What's
happening to house prices: Or, to put the question in
slightly didfferent form: How much house does $250,000 buy
these days in various parts of the country?
   Regional variations are still very large, but they may be
dwindling slightly. All through the 1970s and 1980s, housing
prices on the East Coast and in California far outstripped
the national averages. Today the trend is beginning to
reverse. Prices are holding up better in the heartland.
Following are reports from six communities, which generally
support the idea of slowly converging prices:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>SEATTLE:</p>
<p>Roller-Coaster Prices</p>
<p>Seattle real estate has had a roller-coaster ride over the
past couple of years. Prices skyrocketed in the late 1980s,
but have recently begun falling back to earth.</p>
<p>"The Seattle area is a fascinating market because things
are happening so fast, it's like a decade being crammed into
two years," says Jim Hebert, the president of Hebert Research
Inc., a research firm in Bellevue, Wash.</p>
<p>Redmond, Wash., is an eastside suburban Seattle community
of about 33,000 that is typical of the way prices have risen
and fallen. Real-estate agents point to one house, on the
market for $244,000. But over the past year, agents say, the
value of such a house has gone from $225,000 to $280,000 and
back down again to the current level.</p>
<p>It is a 3,060-square-foot two-year-old eight-room house
with four bedrooms, a terrace deck, a kitchen with European
cabinets, digital appliances and a walk-in pantry. It has a
three-car garage, a formal dining room, 2 1/2 baths, a family
room with a fireplace, gas heat and a spacious lawn.</p>
<p>Over the past several years, rapid population growth,
particularly from equity-rich Californians, and job growth in
the business sector fueled real-estate speculation in the
Seattle suburbs that inflated most homes well beyond their
sustainable value, according to Barbara McElveny, the second
vice president of the Seattle King County Association of
Realtors.</p>
<p>"When the market rose 37% in 1989, people jumped on the
bandwagon to take advantage of the appreciation," says Mrs.
McElveny.</p>
<p>The price fall is particularly evident at the high end,
because there was more speculation in that market segment.
For example, Mrs. McElveny says a Realtor she knows just
purchased a waterfront home on Lake Washington in an
exclusive neighborhood. It sold for $900,000, but the listed
price for the home was $1.4 million, she says.</p>
<p>On the east side, $250,000 will buy much more than it did
eight months ago. Typically, it will get you, at minimum, a
three-bedroom home, she says. At the low end, there is still
a shortage of housing in the under-$200,000 price range, but
if the buyer psychology continues to worsen, houses may come
available for first-time buyers.</p>
<p>"The housing market just turned a somersault from the
first quarter and continued to decline throughout the year,"
says Mr. Hebert of the research firm.</p>
<p>Mr. Hebert says the suburban Seattle housing market will
decline as much as 20% between now and the late spring before
leveling out and starting to reflect "normal" real-estate
prices in the area.</p>

<p>NAPERVILLE, ILL.:</p>
<p>Slow but Steady</p>
<p>In Naperville, Ill., a distant suburb of Chicago, prices
have held fairly steady over the past year, although the
market is beginning to feel a glut of higher-end houses. Here
in Naperville, a $250,000 house is at the upper end of the
housing spectrum.</p>
<p>A typical $250,000 house would be a four-bedroom, 2
1/2-bath, 3,000-square-foot Georgian or colonial home on a
quarter-acre lot in an upscale subdivision. It would almost
certainly have a master bedroom suite including a bath with a
whirlpool and seperate shower; brick fireplace, central air
conditioning, first-floor den and family room, large kitchen
with custom cabinets and ceramic-tile floors, a full basement
and a three-car garage.</p>
<p>Prices for this type of home are about unchanged from late
1989. In Du Page County, where Naperville is located, prices
for all detached, single-family houses are up 3.23% -- less
than the rate of inflation -- compared with annual price
increases of about 5% to 13% from 1984 through 1988,
according to the Du Page Association of Realtors.</p>
<p>"We're far better off here in the Midwest than the rest of
the nation," says Richard Gardner, a Realtor with ERA Dupreef
Realty in Naperville. "The rate of {market} growth has slowed
down a little, but there's no decrease in value here."</p>
<p>One reason is that the market was relatively stable during
the 1980s real-estate boom, with price rises of about 40%
versus 100% in, say, New Jersey.</p>
<p>Lately, however, traffic at the high end has slowed. It
takes 60 to 90 days to sell a house now, compared with 50 to
60 days a year earlier. Upper- and middle-management layoffs
and a slowdown in employee transfers at corporate offices in
the area have thrust more houses in the $250,000-and-up range
onto the market. (Naperville, which locals call "the fastest
growing noncoastal community in the U.S.," is home to dozens
of major corporate offices, including an AT&T regional center
with more than 8,000 employees.)</p>
<p>"In our office, we have noticed a lot of upper-end homes
starting to sell," says Dan Shanahan, branch manager at
Coldwell Banker's Naperville office. "But this is not a
disaster. It's nowhere near a disaster."</p>
<p>The slowdown has pinched builders of more expensive homes,
particularly those that sold houses contingent on the sale of
the buyers current residence. Prices have fallen on builders'
models and custom-built homes in some subdivisions. Two
Naperville homes sold in a real-estate auction last month
were sharply reduced from their original listing-price. A
builder's model priced at $699,000 sold for $485,000, and a
home listed at $395,000 went for $295,000.</p>

<p>RIDGEWOOD, N.J.:</p>
<p>After the Free Fall</p>
<p>Housing prices in this largely white-collar commuter town
have fallen about 30% in the last three years, but real
estate agents say they should stabilize this year.</p>
<p>"We've almost leveled off," says William Gilsenan Jr.,
owner of Gilsenan Co., a local real-estate firm. "With
interest rates coming down, we should see greater activity
this year."</p>
<p>At the moment, bargains abound in Ridgewood, a quiet town
of 25,000 located 12 miles outside New York City. "Basically
for $250,000 you get a nice little house on a nice little
lot. Nothing fancy," says Catherine Sperte, a representative
of Century 21. That's in marked contrast to a couple of years
ago, when anyone with less than $300,000 to spend was told to
look somewhere else.</p>
<p>While it will hardly buy a mansion, $250,000 clearly goes
a lot further in Ridgewood today than a year ago. Then,
sellers were still determined to hold out for the fat profits
that rolled in during the boom market of the 1980s. More
often than not, they found their homes sitting on the market
for months.</p>
<p>Generally, real estate brokers say $250,000 will now buy a
colonial-style house with three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a
one-car garage, on a 50-foot-by-130 foot lot. Cape style or
split-level homes, considered somewhat less desirable,
generally offer more house (say an additional bedroom or
bathroom) for the same money.</p>
<p>In a typical example, one colonial style, stone frame
house with four bedrooms and 2 1/2 bathrooms went on the
market last August for just under $300,000. Months passed and
there were no serious nibbles, so the sellers recently
slashed the asking price to $249,000. Although the house
hasn't sold yet, real-estate agents say that now that the
price is more realistic it should go fairly quickly. "Houses
that are priced right sell well," says Arlene Dodd, a sales
representative with Schlott Realtors in Ridgewood.</p>
<p>To a great extent, Ridgewood's housing market mirrors the
fortunes of New York City, particularly Wall Street. Soaring
for most of the 1980s, housing prices started tumbling after
the stock market crash of 1987, falling by some estimates at
a rate of 1% per month.</p>
<p>Brokers here like to argue that since the area took its
lumps earlier than the rest of the country, the worst is
over. Despite their relatively upbeat tone now, there are no
guarantees that the Ridgewood market has bottomed, especially
given the uncertain economic situation.</p>
<p>Already, prices have fallen enough to encourage first-time
buyers, who once couldn't dream of house-hunting in
Ridgewood. In fact, most of the recent activity has been in
houses costing under $300,000, while more expensive homes
languish on the market.</p>

<p>ORANGE COUNTY, CALIFORNIA:</p>
<p>Slightly Cheaper</p>
<p>Home buyers looking for a $250,000 home in the Orange
County region of Southern California will find that their
money buys them more this year --  although not a huge amount
more.</p>
<p>"It looks like people are getting better deals in 1990
compared with 1989. In terms of square footage, they're
getting more house for the money," says Martin C. Dee,
spokesman for TRW Real Estate Information Services in
Anaheim, Calif.</p>
<p>A TRW survey of homes sold in Orange County in October
shows more houses in the larger 1,500- to 2,000-square-foot
category than a year ago. Likewise, prices have dropped. The
average sale price of a home in October was $236,421, a 9.1%
drop from the year-earlier $260,180.</p>
<p>"Part of what we're telling owners is that if you don't
have to sell, don't." The market just isn't good. It's that
simple," says Realtor Pat Neal of Copper Penny Real Estate in
Garden Grove, Calif.</p>
<p>Still, the softness is a matter of perception. In the
tree-lined Garden Park tract of Garden Grove, about 30 miles
south of Los Angeles, $250,000 will get you a 26-year-old
California ranch style home with four bedrooms and 1 3/4
baths. Total square footage is a smallish 1,450. A year ago,
that same home would have cost just $10,000 more.</p>
<p>"In the higher price ranges, we've seen more of a drop in
price because of the slower market, but it hasn't affected
home in the $250,000 range that much," says Marnie O'Brien,
senior marketing consultant for Grubb & Ellis in Irvine,
where prices in that range have only dropped about 2% to 5%.
In Irvine, $250,000 will buy a five-year-old home with three
bedrooms and 1,500 square feet.</p>
<p>What has changed more is the amount of time properties
spend on the market. The selling time for a $250,000 home in
Irvine is around 60 days now, half that of a year ago. In
Garden Grove, Ms. Neal says, the average time on the market
has been as high as 122 days. Overall, the housing market is
slowing in Orange County: from July to September, 1,712 units
were sold, compared with 2,037 in the second quarter, a 16%
in the second quarter, a 16% drop, according to Meyers Group
real-estate consultants in Corona, Calif.</p>
<p>The biggest markdowns have occurred in homes priced over
$300,000. "You start seeing the sticker spread as you move up
in price. That's where you have the real softness and the
longer times to sell," says Ms. Neal. At the other end of the
spectrum, many more houses are listed below $200,000 these
days -- hardly enough to buy much more than a condo a year
ago.</p>
<p>Tentatively, most Realtors say they expect flat to
slightly higher prices this time next year.</p>

<p>HOUSTON:</p>
<p>Recovery at Last</p>
<p>In Houston, a quarter of a million dollars practically
buys a mansion. The Woodlands is a large new community 27
miles north of downtown Houston, a favorite of managers in
high-technology and energy companies. The landscape is
heavily wooded, and the money goes a lot farther here than in
New York or California.</p>
<p>A typical $250,000 house has about 3,200 to 3,800 square
feet, four bedrooms, 3 1/2 baths and at least a two-car
garage. Quarter-acre lots are common. A few of the houses
have swimming pools, and the majority have a Jacuzzi tub as
standard equipment in the master bedroom. The house probably
will have two fireplaces.</p>
<p>The two-story dwelling will likely have a family room or
game room and a den or study downstairs.</p>
<p>Although prices have been rising lately, the gains have
been slow. The building excesses of the 1980s were so large
that it will still take years to work off inventory.</p>
<p>"Our problem was that we simply built too much, we had an
oversupply of real estate," says Barton Smith, professor of
economics at the University of Houston. He adds, however,
that "in the past three years the economy has accelerated the
pace of the real-estate recovery."</p>
<p>In Houston the housing market is probably balanced now,
although if there is any slant, it's on the side of the
seller.</p>
<p>"This is a fairly balanced market, although demand is so
good that it's turning into a seller's market," David M.
Weekley of Weekley Homes Inc., a Texas homebuilder, says.</p>
<p>"In Houston you have about seven years' worth of people
that have been held captive in a current house, but the value
is returning now," he adds. About 10% of the estimated 800
homes Mr. Weekley has built this year have been in the
$250,000 range, with an average price tag of aobut $300,000.
His company has been building homes in the city since 1976.</p>
<p>During its worst times, the Houston real-estate market
depended heavily upon corporate transferees that could pretty
much be counted on, even as economic and market conditions
worsened.</p>
<p>"It's still a good transferee buyer market," the
37-year-old Mr. Weekley says, "but people are able to move
now. There is a greater demand for move-up homes."</p>
<p>John A. Daugherty, who estimates that his John Daugherty
Realtors has sold about 1,000 houses this year, about 250 of
which were in the $250,000 range, thinks that the market is
more balanced today than it has been in 20 years.</p>
<p>There isn't an oversupply or undersupply, but an adequate
supply of housing, Mr Daugherty says.</p>

<p>GWINNETT COUNTY, GA.:</p>
<p>A Buyer's Market</p>
<p>In Gwinnett Conty, Ga., the home buyer is king. Shoppers
are finding lower prices, a huge inventory of properties, and
willing -- even desperate -- sellers.</p>
<p>In the Atlanta suburb, which in the late 1980s was among
the fastest-growing counties in the nation, $250,000 will buy
a large and well-appointed new two-story all-brick home with
four large bedrooms and as many baths on a half-acre to a
full-acre wooded lot with lots of extras. In that price
range, most homes feature a Jacuzzi bath, an outsized deck,
and sprinkler and security systems. Vaulted ceilings and
stained glass are popular, as are open floor plans and lots
of light.</p>
<p>Buyers in Gwinnett hold all the cards. And they know it.
Overbuilding has left the area with a glut of unsold new
properties. Buyers are demanding -- and getting -- lowered
sales prices, extras such as high-priced appliances,
customized draperies, hardwood floors and favorable
financing.</p>
<p>Closings on homes in Gwinnett fell 21.6% in the three
months ended Nov. 30 to 791 homes from 1,009 homes in the
same period of 1989, according to data from Metropolitan
Multi-List Inc. in Atlanta. While homes in Gwinnett fetched
97.2% of the asking price during the 1989 period, they
brought only 95.7% of it for the 1990 period. "They're
cutting the prices this year and selling fewer homes," says
John Hanes, a broker at Century 21 in Lilburn in Gwinnett.</p>
<p>Ida Shelton, an agent with Sports Realty Inc., remembers
the glory days of 1986, when homes in Gwinnett were selling
as fast as they could be built. "We were sitting back taking
orders. We had more than we could cope with. People would ask
us to take a house in trade, and we'd laugh. We were
arrogant. You're seeing humble now."</p>
<p>Chances are buyers will be able to get at least as much
home next December as they can now. Agents who used to stress
the virtual guarantee of appreciation now market homes more
for their comforts, the pride of ownership and the tax
write-offs.</p>
<p>"It's something to enjoy. And there are tax advantages,"
says Mr. Ballard. "I don't see any appreciation for two or
three years."</p>
<p>Donald Ratajczak, director of the Economic Forecasting
Center at Georgia State University in Atlanta, says anecdotal
information suggests land prices in Gwinnett have tumbled
"15% to 20% in the past year" and housing prices have
declined "5% to 10%" in the same period. "It's still falling.
Nobody sees firmness yet," he adds.</p>
<p>"We'll still see a glut developing until the end of next
year," says Mr. Ratajczak, who predicts housing prices will
stabilize in 1992 and start to rebound in 1993.</p>
