	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Republic Health Corp. expects to report net
income of $1.1 million, or 19 cents a share, for the fiscal
first quarter ended Nov. 30, said Bryan P. Marsal, the
company's chief executive officer.
   In the year-earlier period, then privately held Republic
Health posted a loss of $38 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company expects to report that revenue increased 22%
to $118 million from $97 million, Mr. Marsal said.</p>
<p>The company had expected its first-quarter earnings to be
"a little higher," Mr. Marsal said in an interview. But he
said the recent 2% reduction in Medicare reimbursements for
outpatient procedures resulted in narrower margins. Republic
Health owns or leases, and operates 13 acute-care hospitals
in six states, plus one surgery center.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Mr. Marsal said he expected the company to
stay profitable and to continue posting gains over last
year's results. But he said smaller-than-expected Medicare
reimbursements would continue putting a strain on earnings.
As a result, he said the company is attempting to cut costs,
as well as increase business from non-Medicare patients.
Medicare patients now account for 50% of the company's
business, Mr. Marsal said.</p>
<p>The company is planning to open two more surgery centers
in Southern California, where its existing one operates, Mr.
Marsal said.</p>
<p>The chief executive said he expected his company would
prove to be "recession insensitive." But he did say that in
hard times, patients may choose to do without elective
surgery.</p>
<p>A year ago this month, Republic Health sought Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection to restructure total debt of about $645
million. When it emerged from bankruptcy court in May, its
total debt was reduced to $379 million, and bondholders owned
nearly 90% of its common; the rest was held by holders of the
old preferred and common stock.</p>
<p>Now, the company has debt of about $350 million and equity
of about $42 million, Mr. Marsal said. He said the company
has no plans to pay dividends or issue additional stock.</p>
