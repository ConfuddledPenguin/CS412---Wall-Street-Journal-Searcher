	<p class="article-leader">HOLLYWOOD -- What Pele was to soccer, Gerard Depardieu is
to movies. In much of the world, particularly in Western
Europe, he is acclaimed as the greatest living screen actor,
a French Brando, a legend.
   But in the U.S., people ask "Who?"</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Moreover, as Walt Disney Co. film executives found when
testing brief TV ads with audiences, many Americans' initial
impression of the shaggy, beefy, big-nosed actor was that he
was a "fat slob."</p>
<p>The female lead in the coming film "Green Card" has the
same reaction, but after a while she falls madly in love.
Disney's vaunted marketing machine must ensure that audiences
do the same.</p>
<p>But first, they have to get people to show up. The main
thing people ask when they hear that a film is a love story
is "Who's in it?" But the movie's co-star, Andie MacDowell of
"sex, lies, and videotape," is also relatively unknown.</p>
<p>The subject matter of this small-scale romantic comedy
won't help sell it either, even if the idea is easy to sum up
on a poster: "The story of two people who got married, met,
and then fell in love." Hollywood generally loves concepts
that can be explained in a sentence: Two strangers, a scruffy
Frenchman and a slightly priggish American horticulturist,
get married, he to gain residency status, she to get an
apartment she covets. But however packageable the idea seems,
it doesn't hold any special allure.</p>
<p>"It's outside most people's experience," concedes Peter
Weir, who wrote, produced and directed "Green Card."</p>
<p>The marketing difficulties are especially frustrating
because Disney executives are proud of the film. Disney
Studios Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg has taken it as a
personal challenge to successfully open the movie, which some
Disney wags are calling "`Pretty Woman' for people who
think." The poster for "Green Card" bears more than a passing
resemblance to the one used for "Pretty Woman," Disney's
biggest hit ever.</p>
<p>Christmas is a crowded, competitive time, especially for
fragile movies, but "Green Card" is being released Sunday to
qualify it for Academy Award consideration. Most reviews
aren't out yet, but they're likely to be generally favorable.
Rolling Stone called it "captivating" but with "all the heft
of a potato chip." Mr. Weir, the Australian director who made
"The Year of Living Dangerously" and "Witness," is highly
regarded. Disney gets prestige points no matter what, but a
success would help redeem a winter season when Disney's
"Three Men and a Little Lady" and "Rescuers Down Under" were
snowed under by Fox's "Home Alone."</p>
<p>It would surpass Disney executives' wildest dreams if the
film won the kind of audience attracted by other urban fare
like "Moonstruck" and "When Harry Met Sally." But the
marketing of the film is a slow and arduous process; it's
definitely not just a matter of buying the right TV time. Mr.
Katzenberg has criss-crossed the country to be the host at
upscale screenings followed by receptions at New York's 21
Club, Hollywood's Morton's and the Los Angeles County Museum
of Art.</p>
<p>This is an effort to reach "opinionmakers," says Disney
marketing chief Robert Levin. Through word-of-mouth, he hopes
the film will do well in New York and Los Angeles, then build
gradually as it goes to a still-selective 100 screens Jan 11.
If any kind of buzz continues and if other Christmas movies
wither, Disney hopes theater owners will make room for "Green
Card" on more and more screens.</p>
<p>Disney is walking a tightrope. It needs Mr. Depardieu's
tiny art-house following to help launch the picture, but if
the film is perceived as too arty, it could turn off wider
segments of the audience.</p>
<p>"When someone is confronted with a piece of material, they
can say, `I get it, but I think you have to be smart,'" says
Mr. Levin. "They're afraid that they're going to wind up in
the audience and not get the joke when everyone else does."</p>
<p>So the TV spots and theatrical trailer rather mundanely
explain the idea and show a little romance and comedy. Mr.
Levin says the only reason the trailer even mentions that Mr.
Depardieu is "the most acclaimed actor in France" is so the
handful of people who know this will be reassured that Disney
is aware of it. "The rest of the people will say, `Big
deal.'"</p>
<p>Disney hasn't been too proud to try some Hollywood
gimmicks, but they, too, have been problematic. The marketing
people placed classified ads seeking couples who got married
so one partner could get a green card to stay in the U.S.,
thinking they would be fodder for talk shows that would also
mention the film. "But it appears only to have generated the
interest of the INS," says Mr. Levin. As in the film, the
Immigration and Naturalization Service doesn't care if the
couple are in love and want to live happily ever after; the
initial act is still fraud.</p>
<p>Mr. Weir thought up the movie's premise three years ago
after returning to Australia to take a year off, licking his
wounds from the disappointing opening of "The Mosquito
Coast." He wound up writing the script with Mr. Depardieu in
mind, even though he had never met him and didn't know
whether Mr. Depardieu could speak English. (He can, sort of.)</p>
<p>Disney has an aggressively hands-on attitude about its
films and generally steers clear of renowned directors for
this reason, but Mr. Weir and Mr. Katzenberg, who did "Dead
Poets Society" together, get along well. Although Mr. Weir
says Disney shows "excessive zeal" about enforcing budgetary
constraints and can be "bureaucratic," he was left alone on
"Green Card" because the $12 million film was independently
produced. Mr. Depardieu and Mr. Weir accepted reduced fees to
meet the budget, nothing new for the French actor who once
starred in a movie for a struggling director in return for a
bottle of wine. (He did stipulate that it be a very good
bottle.)</p>
<p>Disney executives seemed resigned to allowing Mr. Weir to
make the film his way. They couldn't get him to cast a bigger
name than Ms. MacDowell or to broaden the comedy elements.
They didn't push too hard about Mr. Weir's refusal to give
the film a "Pretty Woman" fairy-tale ending. They would just
say, "Don't you realize that if you recut this, you could buy
a new house?" Mr. Weir recalls.</p>
<p>But now Mr. Weir needs Disney to get people into theaters,
and the director sees some irony in this. The movie industry,
he says, "has trained audiences to respond to a siren song:
`Come and get it, you'll like it,' and it's turned into a
Frankenstein monster. They release all these dumb movies, and
then when they have one they like -- one everybody likes,
that's simple and honest -- it turns out to be difficult to
sell."</p>
