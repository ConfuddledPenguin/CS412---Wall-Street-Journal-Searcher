	<p class="article-leader">Natural Alternatives International Inc. said it expects a
decline in revenue and a "moderate loss" in its fiscal second
quarter ending Dec. 31.
   President Mark A. Ledoux said he expects the
second-quarter loss to be $50,000 to $100,000 on revenue of
$1.9 million to $2 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the year-ago quarter, the San Marcos, Calif., maker of
vitamins and minerals reported net income of $236,158, or six
cents a share, on revenue of $2.7 million. The company has
about four million shares outstanding.</p>
<p>Natural Alternatives said results in the recent quarter
were affected by inventory adjustments by certain major
customers. The company said it expects that previous order
patterns will be restored in the third quarter.</p>
<p>The company said it is negotiating with several large
organizations for new private label distributing
arrangements. Mr. Ledoux said he expects one of the
arrangements to be completed in time to "contribute
substantially" to revenue and earnings in the second half of
fiscal 1991.</p>
