	<p class="article-leader">UJB FINANCIAL Corp.'s directors sharply reduced the
Princeton, N.J., bank holding company's quarterly dividend
because of concerns about the weak real estate market and the
economy. UJB also said it expects to break even or report a
modest loss for all of 1990. For 1990's first nine months,
UJB reported profit plunged 88% to $11.3 million, or 22 cents
a share. The quarterly payout was cut to 15 cents a common
share from the 29 cents that had been paid for the previous
five quarters. The dividend is payable Feb. 1 to stock of
record Jan. 8. UJB Financial, with assets exceeding $13
billion, has more than 270 offices in New Jersey and eastern
Pennsylvania. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading
yesterday, UJB's shares fell 37.5 cents to $7.625.</p>
