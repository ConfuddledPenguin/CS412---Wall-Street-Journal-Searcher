	<p class="article-leader">SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Intel Corp. said it sued Cyrix
Corp. in a Texas federal court, charging that the small Texas
chip maker violated an Intel patent in a chip that mimics a
popular Intel computer chip.
   Intel said its suit, filed in U.S. District Court in
Dallas, charges that a Cyrix "co-processor" chip duplicates
the function of a patent that Intel has held since 1982.
Co-processor chips are used in personal computers to speed up
certain calculations, and work together with the computer's
main microprocessor, or "brain," chip.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Cyrix's chip mimics Intel's 80387 co-processor, which is
designed to work alongside Intel's popular 80386
microprocessor. Intel said it filed the suit after it failed
to reach agreement with Cyrix after several months of
negotiations over the disputed chip. Intel said its suit
requests unspecified damages and an injunction to prevent
Cyrix from continued infringement.</p>
<p>Cyrix President Jerry Rogers said that Cyrix is
"absolutely not" infringing on the Intel patent and that the
Intel suit is probably a reaction to suits filed by Cyrix.
Cyrix, based in Richardson, Texas, last week filed antitrust
lawsuits against Intel in federal and state courts in Texas,
Mr. Rogers said, charging that Intel "has been trying to keep
us out of the market and hinder our business" by intimidating
Cyrix's suppliers and customers, among other things.</p>
<p>Intel's suit illustrates the tough time chip makers have
in developing components that clone popular established chips
without sparking legal challenges. Intel has a separate suit
pending against Advanced Micro Devices Inc., whose
co-processor chip Intel claims violates Intel copyrights.
Intel has a history of suing companies that try to clone its
chips.</p>
