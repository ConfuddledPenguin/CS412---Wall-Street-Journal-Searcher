	<p class="article-leader">Eastern Airlines should have reinstated striking pilots
who returned to work before it put some replacement pilots in
its cockpits, a federal appeals court ruled.
   A three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals upheld a lower court ruling that said Eastern, a
Miami-based unit of Continental Airlines Holdings Inc.,
shouldn't have favored pilots in training in August 1989 when
returning strikers were available.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A lawyer for the pilots union said Eastern might have to
pay tens of millions of dollars in back pay. But Eastern said
the ruling won't have any immediate impact, according to a
spokeswoman, because the airline plans to appeal for a
rehearing before the entire 11th circuit. Only about 200
pilots could be affected, she said.</p>
<p>Eastern was nearly grounded in March 1989 after most of
its 3,600 unionized pilots walked out in support of striking
machinists. But many members of the Air Line Pilots
Association started returning to work several months later
after Eastern began hiring replacement pilots and it became
clear the strike was no longer effective.</p>
<p>Eastern, however, said it had no jobs for returning
strikers. Instead, it put them on a recall list for pilot
jobs that could become available later. Then, the airline
went to court to have the trainees declared permanent
employees. For a year, Eastern filled vacant pilot jobs by
giving preference to the new-hire list, rather than the
returning striker list.</p>
<p>The ALPA contended the trainees can't be permanent
replacements under the federal laws that govern airline labor
relations. The 11th Circuit, upholding the district court in
Miami, agreed, saying the trainees hadn't completed the
Federal Aviation Administration-mandated examinations and
hadn't operated any regular revenue flights. "Eastern's
trainees were not actually performing the work ordinarily
discharged by the former strikers," the court said in its
opinion.</p>
<p>Separately, BHA Aviation Inc., Miami, said it agreed to
acquire an Eastern unit for more than $15 million in cash
plus assumption of debt. The unit, Eastern Express, a small
commuter carrier that flies only in Florida and the Bahamas,
is expected to change hands in January 1991, if the
bankruptcy court overseeing Eastern's Chapter 11 case
approves.</p>
<p>BHA Aviation is an investor group led by Jack E. Robinson,
who was briefly president of Eastern Express earlier this
year. Eastern Express was formerly Bar Harbor Airways until
August.</p>
