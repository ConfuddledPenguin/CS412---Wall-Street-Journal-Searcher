	<p class="article-leader">The Big R is beginning to hit Main Street manufacturing.
   Until recently, Midwest manufacturers were largely dodging
the recession bullet that has been trained on East and West
coast financial, real estate and other industries. Lately
though, makers of everything from steel and machine tools to
lift trucks and paper have begun feeling the pinch, and the
wave of layoffs that began on Wall Street has reached the
heartland. U.S. manufacturing employment fell by 200,000 in
November alone, or one-third of the total job loss since
January 1989, when the sector's employment peaked for this
economic cycle.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Moreover, industrial production in November plunged 1.7%,
the biggest monthly drop in the index since January 1982.
Economists say the report, coupled with recent increases in
unemployment, clearly played a role in persuading the Federal
Reserve Board this week to further cut interest rates.</p>
<p>"November was a very, very big hit," says Jill Thompson,
an economist who follows the industrial sector at
DRI/McGraw-Hill. "I don't think anyone anticipated that it
would hit so hard so fast."</p>
<p>Much of the retraction reflects the chilling effect from
cutbacks in the auto industry, which in November experienced
a whopping 27% decline in production from two months earlier.
Thousands of Midwest manufacturers tied to car makers have
caught Detroit's cold. Earlier this month, three steelmakers
with major auto contracts -- the LTV Steel unit of LTV Corp.,
Armco Inc. and Rouge Steel Co. -- announced that they would
each indefinitely idle furnaces that had accounted for
between 22% and 30% of their capacity. Armco's moves at two
furnaces affected more than 600 employees.</p>
<p>Other industrial companies are likewise suffering as
skittish consumers sour on major purchases such as
appliances, and businesses postpone nonessential investments.
General Electric Co. plans to eliminate 500 of 9,300 factory
jobs at year end at its appliance division in Louisville, Ky.
That will only worsen already gloomy statistics: The nation's
output of appliances fell 8.9% in October while employment in
the industry dropped 5.4% from year-earlier levels.</p>
<p>Still, most economists don't expect states like Ohio,
where housing starts have fallen only 1% this year, to see
the same fallout as New Jersey, where they've plunged 40%.
Moreover, they believe a recession will be short-lived, with
manufacturers hitting rock bottom between now and the second
quarter of 1991. And they don't expect a rerun of the early
1980s recession, when multimillion-dollar quarterly losses
were routine. Instead, most manufacturers are expected to
remain profitable on an operating basis throughout a
recession.</p>
<p>"Manufacturers are very lean," says Priscilla Trumbull,
senior industrial economist with WEFA Group, an economic
forecasting company. "They've continued to cut employment
during fairly good times and managed to maintain output."
Indeed, manufacturers are producing 40% more goods than they
did a decade ago, with 1.9% fewer employee hours.</p>
<p>John Jacobson, who watches steel for AUS Consultants, says
plant shutdowns aren't necessarily bad news. In the early
1980s recession, he says, manufacturers maintained high
operating rates regardless of demand in a futile effort to
keep plants open and workers employed. "Now they're gearing
back to produce at levels consistent with demand," he says.</p>
<p>Nacco Industries Inc., for instance, is closing a lift
truck assembly plant at Brunswick, Ga., and consolidating
assembly of the vehicles at Greenville, N.C. President Alfred
M. Rankin Jr. says Nacco's is the world's lowest-cost lift
truck product, but the company wants to ensure that it keeps
that position.</p>
<p>Such moves are also necessary to maintain lower
inventories, another critical factor in keeping
recession-bound manufacturers afloat. Although consumer
purchases of cars have clearly declined, observers say the
auto makers are throttling back production to pre-empt an
inventory buildup. Says Inland Steel Industries Inc. Chairman
Frank W. Luerssen: "Lower inventories means we should quickly
benefit from any rebound in consumer spending."</p>
<p>In the meantime, manufacturers can expect bad news. WEFA
believes that spending for durable equipment will fall about
5.5% between the second quarter of 1990 and the second
quarter of 1991. Ms. Trumball noted that, in the last three
months, makers of custom-made machinery that serve specific
industries saw output and employment drop 2.9% and 1.5%,
respectively; the same levels for makers of construction
machines fell 2.1% and 1.5%, respectively.</p>
<p>Steelmakers, who enjoyed relatively healthy orders and
shipments through October, saw November orders plummet about
17% from October, making deliveries look especially low for
January and February. The big factor: Auto makers have
canceled major orders, leaving piles of now-unwanted steel
sitting on producers' floors.</p>
<p>Peter Marcus, an analyst with PaineWebber, says
steelmakers had already set aside certain days to produce
steel for car makers, and now have holes in their production
schedule. In addition, they're scrambling to get rid of
unwanted auto-related steel products just as demand is
evaporating from the appliance and other consumer
durable-goods industries and the construction sector.</p>
<p>That, in part, has caused the prices of such products as
hot-rolled band to drop 10% in recent weeks. And although
steelmakers have so far remained firm on a 4% price rise
slated for Jan. 1, chances are that the increase will be
rescinded. Ford Motor Co. has already asked suppliers, such
as steel companies, to cut their prices 1% on Jan. 1, in
spite of yearlong contracts. Mr. Marcus expects steel prices
to continue to fall through the middle of 1991, before
beginning to rise again.</p>
<p>Still, Charles Bradford, who watches the steel industry
for UBS Securities, expects most steelmakers to remain
largely profitable throughout a recession, barring write-offs
and strikes. "We believe that the steel industry may perform
much better during this recession than during the last one,"
he says. A key reason, he says, is the weak dollar, which has
kept imports down and makes U.S. steelmakers more
competitive.</p>
<p>The weak dollar has helped all manufacturers. Reynolds
Metals Co. says its shipments were up 11% in November from a
year earlier, thanks mainly to a 29% increase in exports and
strong demand from the U.S. aerospace industry.</p>
<p>Aluminum is one manufacturing sector that doesn't seem to
have seen a recession yet. Aluminum Co. of America says that
while corporate earnings will continue to reflect low primary
aluminum prices, demand for fabricated products remains
relatively strong. "We're not in the layoff mode and we don't
have plans to curtail production anywhere," asserts President
Fred Fetterolf. "Maybe we're on the rim of the precipice but
we don't see {a big falloff} yet."</p>
<p>John Tumazos, with Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities,
says a credit squeeze for smaller and midsize companies is
just beginning and may translate in the future into fewer
capital goods projects and investments. "Capital goods
markets typically don't reflect the bad news to its full
extent in the first six months of a recession," he says.</p>
