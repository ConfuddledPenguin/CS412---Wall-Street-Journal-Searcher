	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Grain and soybean prices sank on worries that
the surprise resignation of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze might slow trade between Moscow and the U.S.
   The resignation might complicate top-level discussions
about how Moscow will use the $1 billion in food credit
guarantees granted by the Bush administration earlier this
month, traders said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade, the soybean
contract for January delivery sank 5.5 cents a bushel to
settle at $5.7075 a bushel. The price of the corn contract
for December delivery slipped 1.25 cents a bushel to settle
at $2.4975 a bushel.</p>
<p>U.S. grain officials had expected the Soviet Union to
quickly use the guarantees to arrange bank credit to purchase
as much as 1.2 million metric tons of U.S. wheat, as well as
quantities of soybeans and corn. However, snags were
developing before Mr. Shevardnadze's resignation.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the U.S. government reportedly balked
at a request by Moscow to use part of the U.S.-backed credit
to pay for the expense of shipping the U.S. foodstuffs to
Soviet ports. The U.S. government apparently wants Moscow to
use the credit solely to buy U.S. goods.</p>
<p>"The resignation casts a further pall on the outlook for
any quick shipments to the Soviet Union," said Robert
Lekberg, an analyst at Farmers Grain & Livestock Corp.,
Chicago. "We don't know who is in charge."</p>
<p>Soybean prices also were depressed by reports that the
Soviet Union bought a large amount of soybean meal from South
American sources instead of the U.S.</p>
<p>The U.S. credit guarantees were granted in part because
credit problems had prompted the Soviet Union to slash its
purchases of U.S. crops, which in turn had depressed the
prices received by U.S. farmers for corn, wheat and soybeans.</p>
<p>Some U.S. traders are speculating that prices of corn and
soybean futures contracts will approach their
life-of-contract lows unless U.S. exports increase soon.</p>
<p>In other commodity markets yesterday:</p>
<p>ENERGY: Petroleum futures trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange was extremely thin in a session traders
termed "dead." Market players seemed more focused on holiday
parties than on the Persian Gulf crisis that has dominated
oil market news in recent months. Generally, prices fell with
the only exception being the two nearest months of heating
oil futures contracts. Spurred by forecasts of harsh weather
encroaching upon the northeastern U.S., January heating oil
prices rose 1.04 cents a gallon to settle at 78.88 cents. The
Northeast, the nation's principal heating oil market, has
seen unseasonably warm weather so far this winter. And some
traders doubt that the Northeast will see quite as severe a
cold wave as some of the rest of the country has. Still,
dropping temperatures forced analysts and others to take note
of the supply picture for heating oil, which reflects the
halting of certain exports from Saudi Arabia. In crude,
February contracts lost 54 cents a barrel to end the day at
$26.39.</p>
<p>COPPER: Futures prices were strong, with the March
contract trading as high as $1.1130 a pound. It ended at
$1.1005, up 1.15 cents a pound. The March contract traded at
a low of $1.0550 on Dec. 7, but has since been locked in a
range between $1.06 and $1.09, noted Richard Hirsch, metals
trader for Sharps Pixley Inc., New York metals brokers. The
fact that the contract rose above $1.10, a key resistance
level, and retained the gain yesterday indicates that the
copper market is strong, despite the continued buildup of
copper supplies, Mr. Hirsch said. One factor that enabled the
market to rise sharply was that traders who had previously
sold short had to buy contracts to cover their positions as
prices rose, he said.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices were mixed, with silver
strong, gold easier and platinum slightly higher. March
delivery silver ended with a gain of $10.30 cents an ounce at
$4.2630, after rising as high as $4.40 (an intraday gain of
24 cents) in early trading. February gold was off $1.30 an
ounce at $386.70. April platinum ended with a gain of $2 an
ounce at $423.90, but was well off its high for the day of
$429. The thinness of the pre-holiday market contributed to
silver's strong advance, analysts said. The advance also was
accelerated as the March contract rose through several key
resistance levels until it reached its high of the day, they
said. The fact that it fell back so sharply from its best
level indicated that it was mostly a technical market, one
analyst said. Continued uncertainty in the Persian Gulf was
also a price-firming factor, according to analysts. The
resignation of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
should have had more impact on platinum than on silver
because the Soviet Union is the world's second-largest
producer of platinum, and any internal unrest could affect
that nation's output, one analyst said.

<p>ORANGE JUICE: Futures prices shot up on concern about a
forecast of a cold front moving into California's citrus
producing areas. The January contract ended with a gain of
9.95 cents a pound at $1.20, just under its intraday high of
$1.2005. Wayne Barnes, a meteorologist at Weather Services
Corp., in Bedford, Mass., said an Arctic cold wave that
brought heavy snow to Seattle late Tuesday was moving down
into California. Frost advisories have been issued for
Southern California, including the citrus-growing areas, and
temperatures are expected to drop into the 20s tonight,
tomorrow night and Sunday night. The coldest readings, in the
mid-20s, are expected tomorrow night and Sunday night, Mr.
Barnes said. The anticipated cold wave is apparently evoking
memories of the devastating freeze that hit Florida around
this time last year and severely damaged the citrus crop
there, analysts said. But the California orange crop is minor
compared with Florida's, and the amount of oranges processed
for juice is even significantly smaller, said Merrill Lynch
analyst Judith Ganes. California is expected to produce only
about 20 million gallons of juice, while Florida's output is
expected to amount to 236 million gallons, Ms. Ganes said.
She also noted that minor damage to the California crop could
be more significant for the market than major damage that
made some oranges unsuitable for picking and hauling. If only
cosmetic damage occurred, she said, it could result in more
oranges than normal going into processing for juice, adding
an unexpected increase in the total orange juice supply.</p>
