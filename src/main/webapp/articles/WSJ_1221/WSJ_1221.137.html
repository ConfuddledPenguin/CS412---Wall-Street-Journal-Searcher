	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department said it would
review a proposed $625 million deal between TWA and American
Airlines to determine whether the sale of international
routes and airport facilities would violate antitrust laws.
   The department made its announcement after receiving a
request for an antitrust inquiry from Sen. John Danforth (R.,
Mo.) who opposes the sale.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sen. Danforth, in a letter to Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh, said the proposed deal "inevitably will lead to a
dramatic reduction in domestic airline competition."</p>
<p>Danforth is the senior Republican on the Senate Commerce
Committee, which handles airline issues, and has been a
leading critic of consolidation in the airline industry.
Trans World Airlines Inc. has a major hub of operation at the
St. Louis airport.</p>
<p>AMR Corp.'s American Airlines unit earlier this week
proposed buying all of TWA's routes from the U.S. to London
and TWA's takeoff and landing rights at Chicago's O'Hare
International Airport. It also would acquire TWA's gates at
the Chicago airport.</p>
<p>The route sales must be approved by the Transportation
Department, but Sen. Danforth said the Justice Department has
the power under antitrust laws to "investigate and remedy
market practices and structures that deny low-priced
competitive air service to the traveling public."</p>
