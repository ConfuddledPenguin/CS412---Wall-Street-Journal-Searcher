	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- Chevron Corp. said it expects to take a
$220 million special after-tax charge related to the planned
disposal of its fertilizer operations against fourth-quarter
profit.
   The oil giant said last month that it began actively
seeking offers for the operations, which had 1989 revenue of
$287 million. Chevron wants to sell the operations because
they are only "marginally profitable" and growth is likely to
be "low to zero," spokesmen said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Chevron hasn't disclosed any other charges or profit
estimates for the quarter. The $220 million charge is equal
to about 62 cents a share, based on the company's 353 million
shares outstanding at Sept. 30.</p>
<p>In the year-earlier fourth quarter, the company had a $1.2
billion charge, resulting in a net loss of $883 million, or
$2.58 a share. The largest part of the charge was a
write-down of producing and nonproducing oil and gas
properties.</p>
<p>Analysts said they were mildly surprised by the size of
the anticipated charge for the fertilizer operations,
especially in view of their revenue. "It isn't an
insignificant number, but overall it's another positive step
in the company's restructuring effort," said Eugene Nowak, an
oil analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.</p>
<p>Several analysts said they don't expect any other large
unusual items in the quarter. Analysts' estimates for
fourth-quarter operating profits cover a huge range from as
little as $1 a share to about $2.55 a share, mainly because
of recent large swings in crude oil prices.</p>
<p>Chevron shares rose $1 to $72 yesterday in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading.</p>
<p>Chevron's fertilizer operations include a phosphate mine
near Vernal, Utah, connected by a 90-mile pipeline to a plant
in Rock Springs, Wyo., that opened in 1986. The company also
owns three nitrogen fertilizer plants and a half interest in
a fourth plant. The division employs about 600 people.</p>
