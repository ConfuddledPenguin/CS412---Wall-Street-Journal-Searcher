	<p class="article-leader">Fiat S.p.A. and Ford Motor Co. said they signed definitive
agreements to form a company that will merge Fiat's
Fiat-Geotech unit and Ford New Holland, Ford's subsidiary
that makes tractors and farm and industrial equipment.
   Last July, the two companies announced plans to form the
joint venture, in which Fiat would get an 80% stake and Ford
20% plus an undisclosed cash payment. Industry analysts have
estimated that Ford would probably receive more than the $330
million it paid for the New Holland operations three years
ago. A Ford spokesman said the company won't disclose the
amount of cash it will get until the venture receives final
government approvals in the U.S. and Europe.</p>

individual market and product identities of both Fiat-Geotech
and Ford New Holland.</p>
<p>Corporate headquarters of the new company will be in
London.</p>
