	<p class="article-leader">The Office of Thrift Supervision permanently banned Yerkes
& Michels, an accounting firm based in Independence, Kan.,
from serving any thrift, thrift-holding company or subsidiary
that is federally regulated.
   Under a consent order in connection with the firm's audit
of First Federal Savings & Loan Association of Independence,
the thrift office charged that the 1988 and 1989 audits
weren't conducted by qualified public accountants. The thrift
office also said that Yerkes & Michels reported the true
financial condition of First Federal, which meets all capital
requirements, but that it relied on government examiners'
paperwork, and didn't independently review the thrift.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yerkes & Michels couldn't be reached for comment. Under
the consent order, the firm neither admits nor denies the
grounds of the order.</p>
<p>The thrift office also issued a cease-and-desist order
requiring Yerkes & Michels to correct its auditing practices,
and repay audit fees of $51,000 that the firm charged First
Federal. It must also establish minimum credentials for any
partners and staff assigned to bank or credit union audits.</p>
