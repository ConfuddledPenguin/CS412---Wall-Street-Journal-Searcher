	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The NBC network, running a distant third in
daytime programming, will give one hour back to affiliates to
let them fill the time themselves, beginning in September
1991.
   The move means many of NBC's 209 affiliates will have to
scramble to buy syndicated programs to fill the suddenly
vacant hour. Affiliates generally applauded the move. "It's a
practical solution to a practical problem," given NBC's lack
of success in daytime programming, said Bill Bolster,
president of Multimedia Broadcasting Co., which owns three
NBC affiliates.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The decision by NBC, a General Electric Co. unit, reduces
the network's daytime schedule to four-and-a-half hours, the
lowest of any broadcast network. CBS Inc.'s network, rated
No. 1 in the period, programs five-and-a-half hours; and ABC,
a unit of Capital Cities/ABC Inc., programs five hours in
daytime, which runs from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p>
<p>NBC said it is likely to cancel its 10 a.m. block of game
shows -- "Let's Make a Deal" and "Classic Concentration" --
which is cleared by only two-thirds of its affiliates.</p>
<p>"It's a (part of the day) that's had serious erosion in
ratings," said John Damiano, NBC's senior vice president of
affiliate relations. For the first 13 weeks of the 1990-91 TV
season, NBC's daytime schedule was viewed by 3.1% of the U.S.
homes with television sets. CBS had 5.5%; ABC had 4.6%.</p>
<p>NBC's move, which had been under consideration for months,
comes as all of broadcasting is suffering from a slump in
national advertising. Kenneth H. MacQueen, vice president at
WHO in Des Moines, Iowa, said he was "less than excited" by
NBC's reduction in daytime. "I wouldn't consider it a
positive move," he said. "You don't see the other networks
throwing back (advertising time) that's hard to sell, do
you?"</p>
<p>It is the second shake-up in daytime programming at NBC,
which recently canceled the half-hour soap opera
"Generations." NBC News is preparing a half-hour midday
information show, "A Closer Look," anchored by Faith Daniels,
to premiere Jan. 8. NBC is also planning a reality-based
show, "Trial Watch," which will feature videotaped footage of
actual trials; it will probably replace another daytime
program, "The Marsha Warfield Show."</p>
<p>NBC also has ordered pilots of two female-oriented talk
shows, "Women's Diaries" with Linda Ellerbee and "AM
Assignment," as well as two NBC News productions, "Today's
Women" and "Today's People."</p>
