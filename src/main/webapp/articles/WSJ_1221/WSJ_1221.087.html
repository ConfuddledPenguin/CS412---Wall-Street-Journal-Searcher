	<p class="article-leader">ST. LOUIS -- McDonnell Douglas Corp. and General Dynamics
Corp. said they are notifying a total of 8,000 employees --
as early as Jan. 2 if the troubled A-12 Navy attack plane
program is canceled.
   The announcements came as the two aerospace concerns
negotiate with the Navy and aides to Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney to try to salvage the program, which has been plagued
by engineering snafus and cost overruns. The Pentagon
threatened to cancel the program, and earlier this week gave
the contractors until Jan. 2 to come up with a plan to solve
the problems.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yet despite the public threats, all parties appear to be
working toward a compromise that would probably slow
development of the A-12 and impose some kind of financial
penalty on the two companies for past mistakes, but still
keep the plane alive.</p>
<p>McDonnell Douglas's McDonnell Aircraft Co. unit has about
6,000 employees in the program, mostly in St. Louis, and
General Dynamics has 4,000, mostly in Fort Worth, Texas. Both
companies said the employees being notified of the potential
layoffs won't be limited to those working on the A-12.</p>
