	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Public Service Co. of New Hampshire cleared
a major regulatory hurdle in its plan to be acquired by
Northeast Utilities and emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law
protection.
   The embattled utility's plan was unanimously approved by
the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has partial
control over the accord because Northeast is a holding
company for utilities and must register with the agency.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The transaction, which required nine federal and state
regulatory clearances, also received the conditional blessing
yesterday of an administrative law judge at the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission. The acquisition now requires
the energy commission's approval.</p>
<p>The U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manchester, N.H., has
approved the accord, but that decision is being appealed. The
Nuclear Regulatory Commission also needs to allow the
transfer of the license for the Seabrook Nuclear Power
Project to Northeast, Hartford, Conn. Still standing in the
way of the deal is the final permission of several states,
including New Hampshire, a state in which a rate increase
recently was approved and is being appealed.</p>
<p>Despite those remaining hurdles, yesterday's actions are a
boost for PS New Hampshire, which filed for bankruptcy-court
protection in January 1988 after drowning in debt related to
its 35.6% holding in the controversial Seabrook plant.
Northeast then proposed to buy the Manchester utility for
$2.3 billion, setting the regulatory steps in motion.</p>
<p>In examining the proposed acquisition, the SEC staff
looked at the financing of the accord, the schedule of rate
increases, the proposed savings to the utilities of combining
their overhead, and how the move would change the
concentration of electric-power generation in New England.
The commission followed the staff recommendation to approve
the deal.</p>
<p>In doing so, the agency rejected a proposal by several
intervenors to hold a hearing on the plan at the SEC, said
William Weeden, the SEC official most closely involved in the
proposal. He said their objections centered on whether the
acquisition by Northeast would create a near monopoly for
electric power in the region.</p>
<p>Separately, the SEC voted to put out for public comment a
proposal designed to help overseas underwriters make
offerings in the U.S. The plan, already in place for U.S.
underwriters, would allow the overseas underwriting firm
making an offering in the U.S. to support the stock price.</p>
<p>"The commission has always recognized that as a form of
manipulation, but a form of manipulation that is needed,"
said Larry Bergmann, the agency's associate director for
market regulation. He said that the SEC has been giving
exemptions for these "stabilizations" to foreign underwriters
but that the agency is looking to "codify" those exemptions.</p>
