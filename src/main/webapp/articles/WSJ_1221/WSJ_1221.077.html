	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Mutual fund investors, shrugging off the
recent spate of bad news about state and city budgets, are
throwing money at municipal bond funds at a feverish pace.
   Investors are eager to minimize taxes and they "sense that
this is the last game in town," says Dale Rabiner, manager of
the $160 million Bartlett Fixed Income Fund, a no-load mutual
fund based in Cincinnati.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mutual fund investors are notoriously bad at guessing
market swings. So the municipal-bond buying binge is
prompting some nervousness. "Time and time again, contrarian
thinking pays off," Mr. Rabiner notes.</p>
<p>Single-state municipal bond funds were the best-selling
category of mutual funds in 1989. And they are on track for
another chart-topping year.</p>
<p>According to the Investment Company Institute, the trade
group for the mutual fund industry, $5.3 billion flooded into
single-state funds in the first 10 months of this year. That
inflow outstripped any other mutual fund category except
money market funds. General municipal bond funds also did
well, pulling in $3.2 billion. These figures represent sales
minus redemptions, plus the net effect of switches involving
other funds in the same family; reinvested dividends are
excluded.</p>
<p>Some fund managers believe the current muni mania is
entirely justified. "The municipals haven't rallied as much
as Treasurys," Ian MacKinnon, Vanguard Group's head of fixed
income, says. "Clearly, munis are at the cheap end of their
trading range, compared to Treasurys. We think it's a smart
idea to buy munis right now."</p>
<p>But if fund investors' current enthusiasm for municipal
bonds does foretell a coming decline, it wouldn't be the
first time.</p>
<p>Fund investors bought stock funds heavily prior to both
the 1987 and 1990 bear markets. They also poured money into
U.S. government and tax-free bond funds right up until the
April 1987 bond market slump. In 1988, high-yield "junk" bond
funds pulled in more money than any other mutual fund
category. The following year, the junk bond market started
unraveling.</p>
<p>Why are fund investors such poor market-timers? Mr.
Rabiner says that when it comes to bonds, the problem arises
because many fund investors buy based on yield. What they
should really look at, he says, is total return, which
includes both the share-price change and the yield. This is
because prices for older bonds will slump whenever yields are
rising.</p>
<p>Lately, few investments have matched the yield offered by
municipal bond funds. According to Lipper Analytical
Services, general municipal bond funds have yielded 6.7% over
the past 12 months. Figure in a top 33% tax rate, and this
yield is worth 10% on a pretax basis. Among the major fund
categories tracked by Lipper, only two groups have offered a
higher yield, junk bond funds and short-term world income
funds.</p>
<p>So far, municipal bond investors have done pretty well.
Over the past 12 months, there hasn't been too much disparity
between the yields on municipal funds and the total return.</p>
<p>"Compared to stocks, owning municipals has been
brilliant," Guy Wickwire, manager of Fidelity High Yield
Tax-Free Portfolio, says. "There have been isolated, small
defaults over the last few years, and if the economy
continues to be bad, we will probably have more. But I don't
think the defaults will pick up any."</p>
<p>Bartlett's Mr. Rabiner, however, reckons problems may lie
ahead. He notes that many state and local governments are
struggling with budget deficits, and yet the yield spread
between the highest-rated and lowest-rated municipal bonds is
still relatively narrow.</p>
<p>Mr. Rabiner says investors should make sure it really
makes sense for them to be in a municipal bond fund, given
their income levels. He suggests fund investors might want to
switch out of high-yield municipal bond funds and
state-specific funds and into a high-quality general
municipal bond fund. Even people in high-quality funds should
be prepared to sit tight in the face of short-term losses
caused as credit problems hurt the price of all municipal
bonds, he believes.</p>
<p>But others see little reason to worry. "I think it's a
myth that fund investors are generally wrong," Avi Nachmany,
a fund analyst with Jesup, Josephthal & Co., says. He points
out that the recent returns of municipal bonds haven't been
lavish enough to prompt speculative buying. Mr. Nachmany
reckons that investors have been buying municipal bond funds
simply to shelter income.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>For First Investors Consolidated Corp., the bad news keeps
on coming.</p>
<p>The New York-based mutual fund company, which is already
battling charges of sales abuse brought against it by New
York and Massachusetts, has just lost its top fund manager.
Daniel Duane, who used to run the top-performing First
Investors Global Fund, has left to run three funds managed by
Prudential Equity Management Associates, a subsidiary of
Prudential Insurance Co. of America, Newark, N.J.</p>
<p>"We don't like to lose anybody," says David Grayson, First
Investors president. "But we do have his {Mr. Duane's}
righthand person, who worked with him, taking over the fund."</p>
