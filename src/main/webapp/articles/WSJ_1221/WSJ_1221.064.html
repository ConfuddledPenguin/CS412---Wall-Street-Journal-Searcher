	<p class="article-leader">DIBOLL, Texas -- Temple-Inland Inc., bolstered by its
thrift operations, expects to report net income of $46
million to $50 million, for the fourth quarter, up from $44
million last year, said Clifford J. Grum, president and chief
executive officer.
   Mr. Grum said in an interview that the estimated earnings
gain reflects better performance in its thrift business and
the inclusion, for the first time, of its Guaranty Federal
Savings Bank unit in its results. Temple-Inland's financial
services sector is expected to report a $10 million to $12
million operating profit, compared with a year-ago operating
loss, while the company's manufacturing unit's operating
earnings are expected to decline 30% to 40% from a year ago,
to $44 million to $52 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In addition to better performance from its thrift
businesses, Temple-Inland also received tax benefits from its
thrift purchases that reduced its 1990 tax rate to about 13%
from 34% last year, Mr. Grum said.</p>
<p>Temple-Inland is estimating that per-share earnings will
be 83 cents to 90 cents for the quarter, compared with 80
cents last year. The year-ago results have been restated to
exclude two insurance companies that were sold.</p>
<p>Fourth-quarter revenue is expected to rise about 21%, to
$593 million from $489 million. Manufacturing operations
account for about $500 million, while the inclusion of
Guaranty makes up most of the remainder of the increase, Mr.
Grum said.</p>
<p>Mr. Grum said that volume has been strong in its
container, containerboard, pulp and paperboard businesses,
but costs have been rising. A $30 price increase early in the
quarter to $410 per ton of linerboard failed to stick,
eroding margins, he said.</p>
<p>The company's building products division, which includes
lumber and particleboard products, however, has been hurt by
the decline in home building and by a decline in residential
repairs and remodeling. The "building materials {business} is
not just in a recession. It may be in a depression," he said.</p>
<p>In contrast, Wayne McDonald, Temple-Inland's chief
financial officer, said the company's two thrifts are
growing, and benefiting from a sharp decline in foreclosures
and an increase in loan closings. Mr. McDonald said that
costs related to foreclosures will drop to about $5 million
this year from $11 million last year. At the same time, the
company's thrifts made about $560 million in loans, compared
with less than $300 million in 1989. The thrifts also have
reduced brokered deposits, lowering their cost of funds.</p>
<p>Mr. Grum said that he can't currently predict that the
company will post another earnings gain in 1991 given the
current state of the economy.</p>
<p>For 1990, the company is expected to report net income of
$230 million to $234 million, or $4.15 to $4.22 a share,
compared with 1989 net income of $207.4 million, or $3.75 a
share. Financial services operating earnings are expected to
be about $50 million to $52 million, including about $34
million from Guaranty Federal, while manufacturing operating
profit is expected to be $250 million to $258 million.</p>
<p>Revenue is expected to rise to $2.4 billion from $1.9
billion, largely because of the inclusion of Guaranty
Federal's results.</p>
<p>Mr. Grum said he believes the financial services group
will have a record year in 1991 that "should allow the
company's overall results to be very favorable compared to
most of our competition." But he said, "if you wired me to
the wall, I think both building products and paper would be
down next year." In addition, because some tax credits were
unique to this year, the company's tax rate will increase to
about 20% next year, he said.</p>
<p>After next year, the future of those tax credits isn't
clear. Because of criticism that some buyers of failed Texas
thrifts like Temple-Inland got bargains under the so-called
Southwest Plan, Mr. Grum said that he expects "sometime next
year we will sit down with regulators" to discuss the
agreement. However, he said he doesn't know whether anything
will come out of any discussions.</p>
<p>In 1991, Temple-Inland is expected to spend about $350
million in capital expenditures, up from $325 million this
year. The company will start up its new linerboard and
bleached board product, called White Top, late next year. In
addition, it is expanding its bleached paperboard mill in
Evadale, Texas, scheduled for completion in 1992, and is
building a recycled paper mill in Maysville, Ky., that is
expected to open in 1993.</p>
<p>Partly because of capital spending and partly because of
thrift acquisitions, Temple-Inland's long-term debt will
increase to about $560 at year-end from about $390 million
last year. Mr. Grum said the company probably will add to its
debt next year, possibly by selling senior debt through
private placements to institutions.</p>
