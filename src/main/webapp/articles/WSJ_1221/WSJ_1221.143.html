	<p class="article-leader">PROCTER & GAMBLE Co.'s retiree health benefits liability
is less than $2 billion, and the company says it retains
legal liability for the retiree medical benefits of its
employee stock ownership plan. P&G's benefits liability was
misstated in the Dec. 13 edition. While the IRS is
reconsidering its letter approving the qualification of P&G's
ESOP plan, that letter hasn't been withdrawn, and P&G is
proceeding with its share repurchase program as outlined to
shareholders.
