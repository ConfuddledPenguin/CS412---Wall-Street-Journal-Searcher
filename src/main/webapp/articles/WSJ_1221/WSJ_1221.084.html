	<p class="article-leader">In the review of the Gerard Depardieu film of "Cyrano de
Bergerac" (Leisure & Arts, Nov. 29), Julie Salamon claims
that Edmond Rostand wrote the play in 1870. That would make
the author two years old at the time, as he was born in 1868.
The right date should have been given as 1897. Andre Gide, in
an entry in his journal about that time, wrote that some
people in France were comparing Rostand with Shakespeare,
adding the quip, "Every generation has the Shakespeare it
deserves." Perhaps Gide, who later recommended rejecting
Proust's great novel when he was a reader for a publishing
house, was too harsh in judging Rostand, who after all wrote
one of the few 19th-century plays still performed frequently
in France.
   Incidentally, in connection with the current French film
several newspaper articles have referred to the Jose Ferrer
English-language version without mentioning the earlier
French film with Claude Dauphin (which I saw in Montreal in
1949 and probably was not shown commercially in the U.S.).</p>
