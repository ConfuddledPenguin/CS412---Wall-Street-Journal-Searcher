	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo stock prices fell back Thursday, finishing just
above their intraday lows under pressure of profit-taking.
   The impact of Tuesday's discount-rate reduction by the
U.S. Federal Reserve Board, which spawned active buying
Wednesday, ebbed as investors were unable to see a clear sign
that the Bank of Japan would ease credit, traders said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In London, share prices finished weaker as the resignation
of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze injected a
note of uncertainty into world financial markets.</p>
<p>Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 selected issues was down
351.84 points at 24524.94. In trading early Friday, the
Nikkei Index was down 416.49 to 24108.45.</p>
<p>Volume on the first section Thursday was estimated at 360
million shares, down from 639 million shares Wednesday.</p>
<p>Declining issues outnumbered advancing issues 856 to 157,
while 125 issues remained unchanged.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section was down 26.04 points, or 1.4%, at 1795.37.</p>
<p>The second section index was down 23.51 points, or 0.8%,
to close at 2823.27.</p>
<p>Volume in the second section was estimated at five million
shares, down from 5.6 million shares Wednesday.</p>
<p>As the yen was weaker against the dollar and the Japanese
bond market softened Thursday despite the U.S. discount-rate
cut Tuesday, stock market participants shared a feeling that
they've already heard the extent of the good news.</p>
<p>The dollar finished Thursday at 134.58 yen, up from 134.05
yen late Wednesday in New York and above 133.27 yen late
Wednesday in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Traders said both bond and stock markets had discounted an
expected reduction of the U.S. rate.</p>
<p>"Participants are already looking for the next news on
interest rates, especially a decline in short-term domestic
interest rates," said Atsushi Koishihara, general manager of
stock trading at Taiheiyo Securities.</p>
<p>Supporting stock prices at the bottom range Thursday were
investment trust funds, "eager to push up and keep the Nikkei
Index above 25000 until the year end," said a trader at
Yamaichi Securities.</p>
<p>Strong resistance at 25000 on the Nikkei is discouraging
investors from buying stocks at higher prices, however,
traders said, prompting more investors, including dealers, to
begin reducing positions ahead of the long weekend. The
market will be closed Monday for a national holiday.</p>
<p>Trading by overseas investors slowed down as many of them
have already left for year-end holidays, traders said.
Foreign participation was also discouraged by continued
reports about the involvement of a ruling party politician,
Toshiyuki Inamura, in the ongoing Koshin stock scandal.</p>
<p>"Foreigners are more sensitive to such a political
scandal" than the Japanese, as reflected on the yen's
weakness on the foreign-exchange market, a trader at Daiwa
Securities said.</p>
<p>But overall, the impact remained minimal as it was the
previous day.</p>
<p>Large-capital shares were sold in a broad range, with
steel manufacturers, shipbuilding companies and electric
power companies ending lower. Their prices, however,
rebounded from intraday lows on buying by investment trust
funds and dealers in the afternoon session, traders said.</p>
<p>Nippon Steel was the most heavily traded stock for the
day, finishing at 444 yen ($3.31), down 1 yen.</p>
<p>Mitsubishi Heavy Industries lost 15 yen to 700 yen, while
IHI fell 16 yen to 700 yen.</p>
<p>High-priced, high-technology shares fell from their midday
highs to end mixed.</p>
<p>Sony was down 130 yen to 6,100 yen and Pioneer lost 70 yen
to 4,050 yen. TDK was up 50 yen to 4,540 yen, while Kyocera
edged up 10 yen to 5,850 yen.</p>
<p>Investors took profits from construction shares as Kajima
declined 60 yen to 1,620 yen, Shimizu plummeted 20 yen to
1,580 yen and Taisei dropped 30 yen to 1,000 yen.</p>
<p>London traders said the impact of Mr. Shevardnadze's
decision to leave the Soviet government was felt extensively
across European equity markets.</p>
<p>"The fears are widespread," said John Reynolds, equity
strategist at brokerage County NatWest WoodMac in London.
"Europe wants a stable Russia without Soviet people piling
over their borders. (The resignation) does add to the general
economic uncertainty which makes markets nervous."</p>
<p>Wall Street was also having its share of jitters over the
news. Throughout most of the European afternoon, the Dow
Jones Industrial Average was under pressure, although by the
close of the session in London, Wall Street appeared to be
reversing its negative direction.</p>
<p>At the closing bell, the broad-based Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100-Share Index was off 19.9 points at 2158.8.</p>
<p>In the futures market, the December FT-SE 100-Share Index
contract settled at 2163.0 on the London International
Financial Futures Exchange, compared with its Wednesday
closing of 2193.0.</p>
<p>At its final calculation, the narrower FT 30-Share Index
was off 19.9 points at 1687.2. Volume reached a moderate
590.2 million shares compared with the 509.3 million issues
traded Wednesday.</p>
<p>Shares in Imperial Chemical Industries, Britain's largest
chemical concern, slid 24 pence (46 cents) to 886 after
several brokerages cut their full-year pretax profit
forecasts to under #1 billion.</p>
<p>Glaxo shares continued their week-long slide on
competition worries from Astra AB's anti-ulcer drug Losec.
The stock lost 11 to 823.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical maker Wellcome lost 22 to 441, after
gaining 20 pence a day ago, on mixed reaction to an analysts
meeting. The company also announced that it sold its Calmic
hygiene service business to Rentokil Group, an environmental
services and property care concern for #26.2 million.</p>
<p>Unilever also retreated, dropping 10 to 687 after a
downgrading from brokerage UBS-Phillips & Drew.</p>
<p>Among featured stocks in the broadly lower market,
retailer Marks & Spencer hardened 2.5 to 226 in a flight to
quality amid recessionary times, dealers said. A robust 4.8
million shares changed hands.</p>
<p>Composite insurer General Accident advanced 3 to 496. The
company is expected to make an announcement Friday, which
market professionals say will be bullish for the company.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, share prices closed lower in Paris, Frankfurt,
Zurich, Brussels, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Milan and Madrid.
South African gold stocks closed higher.</p>
<p>Stocks closed lower in Sydney and Hong Kong, and higher in
Singapore, Taipei and Manila, while they closed little
changed in Wellington and mixed in Seoul.</p>
