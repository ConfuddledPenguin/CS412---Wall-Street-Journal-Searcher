	<p class="article-leader">Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs has sold his entire
position, approximately 930,000 shares or 14.6% of the common
stock, in CML Group Inc., a direct marketer of consumer
products.
   Mr. Jacobs, who abandoned his bid to take over the company
in April, said he sold his stake before year end for tax
purposes, according to a statement issued by CML. The
purchaser, Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., then resold the
stock to retail and institutional customers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"For CML, it takes care of two concerns," said Mark
Perlgut, a spokesman for CML. "Many investors have stayed
away from the stock because they were unsure about what Irwin
Jacobs would do with his shares and some were concerned about
what it would do to the Acton, Mass., company's liquidity if
Mr. Jacobs had to unload the stock in a large block at a low
price."</p>
<p>Sources involved in the transaction said Mr. Jacobs sold
the stock for approximately the average price of his
purchases over the past year, about $18 dollars a share. Mr.
Jacobs representatives would not comment on the sale.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, CML shares closed at $18.375, down $62.5 cents.</p>
