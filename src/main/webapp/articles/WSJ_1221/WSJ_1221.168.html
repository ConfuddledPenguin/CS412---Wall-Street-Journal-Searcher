	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The stock market ended little changed, having
recovered from an opening drop on news of Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze's sudden resignation.
   Mr. Shevardnadze quit amid growing domestic turmoil in the
Soviet Union, warning that the country was slipping toward
dictatorship.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>European markets tumbled on the news, and the stock market
here opened on a sharp downdraft. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average plummeted 26 points before stabilizing and then
climbing back to positive territory by noon.</p>
<p>The average ended with a 2.73-point gain at 2629.46.</p>
<p>"They keep driving the market down but it snaps right
back," said Richard Eakle, president of Eakle Associates.</p>
<p>While the Shevardnadze news darkened the political
backdrop, traders say the market recovered as implacable
portfolio managers continued their year-end buying.</p>
<p>"A lot of people are doing a little dressing up today,"
said Edward J. Shopkorn, director of equity trading at Mabon
Nugent. Mr. Shopkorn said the money managers were putting
excess cash to work by buying highly liquid large-capitalized
stocks such as International Business Machines, which in turn
helped send the industrial average higher. IBM rose 1 to 113
3/4.</p>
<p>The broader market remained fractionally lower, however.
Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index eased 0.08 to 330.12 and
the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index slipped 0.03 to
180.32.</p>
<p>Decliners led advancers, 813 to 726, with 507 stocks
ending unchanged. Volume totaled 174,700,000 shares, compared
with 180.4 million Wednesday.</p>
<p>Dudley A. Eppel, senior vice president of equity trading
at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said trading volume should
jump today as monthly futures contracts and options expire.
Otherwise, said Mr. Eppel, the market should continue to
drift as the end of the year approaches.</p>
<p>Aside from mounting war worries over the Middle East, Mr.
Eakle of Eakle Associates said the stock market has some
things working in its favor that mitigate the downside risk
in share prices.</p>
<p>"Oil is still headed south, as are interest rates, and
there is a perception that inflation is receding," he said.</p>
<p>Crude oil for February delivery fell 54 cents yesterday to
$26.39 a barrel.</p>
<p>Mr. Eakle also said that the internal dynamics of the
stock market are showing signs of strength. Trading volume is
increasing on days that the market rises, he said, while the
number of stocks that hit new lows each day is decreasing.</p>
<p>Some banking shares rallied again. The group has been
strong since the Federal Reserve Board cut the discount rate
to 6.5% from 7% on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Manufacturers Hanover jumped 1 5/8 to 24 1/8 on heavy
volume that included some dividend-related trading.
Manufacturers said on Tuesday that it would pay its regular
82-cent dividend to stock of record Jan. 2.</p>
<p>Citicorp gained 1/2 to 13 3/4, BankAmerica rose 1 3/8 to
28, J.P. Morgan added 7/8 to 46, and Bankers Trust rose 5/8
to 45 1/4.</p>
<p>First Chicago, whose First National Bank of Chicago unit
cut its prime lending rate by 50 basis points to 9.5%, closed
unchanged at 18 1/2.</p>
<p>Chase Manhattan was left behind, however. The stock fell
3/8 to 10 3/4.</p>
<p>Travelers finished up 1/8 to 17 1/8 on volume of almost
two million shares. Property/casualty insurer Continental
Corp. has acquired at least 3% to 3.5% of Travelers' stock,
according to USA Today. A 634,500-share block, representing
about 0.6% of Travelers' outstanding shares, changed hands
shortly after noon.</p>
<p>Sprague Technologies added 3/8 to 3 7/8. The company said
it completed the sale of its semiconductor group to Sanken
Electric for $58 million in cash. Sprague said the sale will
result in a charge of about $49 million in the fourth
quarter. Proceeds will be used to repay bank borrowings and
free up capital for further investment.</p>
<p>Symbol Technologies added 7/8 to 12 1/4. NCR decided to
withdraw from the market a hand-held laser scanner that
Symbol claimed infringed on its patents. Symbol said it
dismissed its pending patent-infringement suit against NCR.</p>
<p>Convex Computer rose 7/8 to 11 5/8. The company said it
installed one of its supercomputers at the University of
Houston.</p>
<p>Urcarco fell 3/4 to 3 7/8. Merrill Lynch downgraded its
rating on the stock Wednesday and cut earnings estimates for
the company.</p>
<p>Rollins Environmental Services added 5/8 to 9 3/8. First
Boston is recommending that its clients buy the stock.
Rollins says maintenance at its Deer Park, Texas, incinerator
has been completed and the facility became operational
Wednesday.</p>
<p>Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. dropped 7/8 to 7 1/2. An
article in yesterday's New York Times highlighted the
company's efforts to reschedule a mountain of short-term
debt. A number of small banks are refusing to go along,
raising fears a settlement could be weeks, even months, away,
the Times said.</p>
<p>L.A. Gear closed unchanged at 15. The company said late
Wednesday that it completed a $360 million credit facility
arranged by Bank of America as agent for itself and a
syndicate of domestic and international banks.</p>
<p>Hunt Manufacturing added 1 5/8 to 12 1/4. The company
boosted its quarterly dividend to eight cents a share from
7.75 cents.</p>
<p>Coca-Cola Enterprises added 1/4 to 15 3/8. The company
said its board approved a program to buy back as many as 15
million common shares. The company said, however, that it
doesn't expect to buy back any shares under the program until
the second or third quarter of 1991.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Index fell 0.16 to 306.49.</p>
