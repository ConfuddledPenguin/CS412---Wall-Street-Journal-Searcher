	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- Key Canadian interest rates fell yesterday to
their lowest levels in almost two years amid warnings of a
deepening Canadian economic recession.
   Major commercial banks cut their prime lending rates
one-half percentage point to 12.75%, the lowest level since
February 1989. The prime rate is a benchmark for various
lending rates.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Canadian Manufacturers' Association, an industry
group, said Canada's manufacturing sector "will likely remain
in a recession until at least the third quarter of 1991."</p>
<p>Royal Bank of Canada economist Michael Gregory, warned
that the current economic recession "is going to get worse."
Canada's gross domestic product declined 0.3% in the second
and third quarters.</p>
<p>Aron Gampel, senior economist at Bank of Nova Scotia, said
a cut in U.S. short-term rates this week gave the Bank of
Canada room to lower Canadian rates without weakening the
value of the Canadian dollar. The Canadian currency has been
buoyed by wide spreads between comparable Canadian and U.S.
short-term interest rates.</p>
<p>Despite yesterday's decline, Canadian short-term interest
rates remain more than 4.5 percentage points above U.S.
rates. "That's still a very tough monetary policy," Mr.
Gampel said.</p>
<p>The Canadian central bank has maintained a restrictive
economic policy because of inflation concerns.</p>
<p>Some provincial politicians who met with Canadian Finance
Minister Michael Wilson yesterday warned that failure to cut
interest rates further will prolong the current recession. "I
think interest rates have to come down even further," said
Alberta Treasurer Dick Johnston.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilson said there are still some lingering inflation
pressures in the Canadian economy, particularly high wage
gains. Interest rates are moving lower, Mr. Wilson said. "How
quickly we can achieve that depends on the inflationary
pressures."</p>
<p>The Canadian Chamber of Commerce urged the government to
freeze spending over the next two years. The group said a
spending freeze was the "only viable solution" for achieving
"lasting reductions" in interest rates.</p>
<p>Yesterday's prime rate cut followed a drop in the Bank of
Canada's influential bank rate, which fell to 11.78%
yesterday from 12.01%. The bank rate is the levy charged by
the central bank on loans to financial institutions.</p>
<p>Royal Bank's Mr. Gregory said Canada's short-term interest
rates will likely continue declining until February and then
level off to offset the inflationary impact of Canada's new
7% value-added tax. The new tax, which received final
approval this week, is expected to boost the consumer price
index by a one-time increase of 1.25%. The tax will take
effect Jan. 1.</p>
