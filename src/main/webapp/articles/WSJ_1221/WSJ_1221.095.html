	<p class="article-leader">Soviet politics are byzantine, so yesterday's resignation
of Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze needs careful
interpretation. One hard-line Communist in the Congress of
People's Deputies called it a "maneuver," obviously meaning
that he suspects Mikhail Gorbachev himself staged it as a
jolt against the right, which has been disturbing his
balancing act lately.
   Any such guess, however, is overwhelmed by one certainty:
Time is running out on Mikhail Gorbachev. Serious forces --
some with guns -- are lined up on left and right. This
dangerous political confrontation has a backdrop of economic
chaos. Production and exports are falling, foreign debt
service costs are rising and creditors are dismayed. The
Soviets are courting the IMF and World Bank, but even those
institutions exercise some prudence.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>These powerful forces cannot be contained forever. Had Mr.
Gorbachev been as wise as his Western admirers believed, he
would have recognized long ago that the Soviet Union's future
-- if it has one -- lies in the center yielding to a
voluntary confederation of the separate republics. That
process already has begun in defiance of the Kremlin.</p>
<p>Instead, he drafted a union treaty designed to preserve
the center's power, only to stir cries of outrage from the
republics. In a New York Times article this week, Izvestia
political columnist Melor Sturua, now a Harvard fellow,
called on Mr. Gorbachev to resign while his place in history
is secure, saying, "There is no wind left in his sails, and
the promised land is as far away as before."</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev's popularity rating has fallen drastically
-- one poll puts it at just over 20%. Public backing has been
rising for Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin, who is
crafting a new Russian constitution that contains genuine
economic reforms. As his popularity grows, Mr. Yeltsin
becomes more assertive, as he was after Mr. Gorbachev, in a
speech to the congress on Wednesday, once again threatened
"direct presidential rule" -- or martial law, if you prefer
-- in Soviet trouble spots.</p>
<p>"The time of commands from the Kremlin is past," declared
Mr. Yeltsin. Mr. Gorbachev, who unlike Mr. Yeltsin has never
faced a popular election, could only bluster in reply about
"rotten roots" of populism, a remark unlikely to endear him
to the Soviet people.</p>
<p>Of course it would be imprudent to ignore the political
forces of the right. While it's hard to read the Gorbachev
mind, his tough talk is surely designed in part to appease
the hardliners who are demanding the use of internal security
troops in what could be a bloody, last-ditch effort to save
the union and the Communist Party. He seems only to have
whetted their appetites, however.</p>
<p>Mr. Shevardnadze singled out the hard right in his
resignation speech. Referring to parliamentarians "with
colonels' shoulder-stripes," he said that they "have been
able to remove the interior minister and now it's time to
settle scores with the foreign minister." He was referring to
Mr. Gorbachev's appointment late last month of hard-liners
Boris Pugo and Boris Gromov as Nos. 1 and 2 in the ministry
responsible for internal security. General Gromov, a hero of
Afghanistan, has since been recruiting army units for
internal security duty, an ominous sign.</p>
<p>The "colonel" cited by Mr. Shevardnadze apparently was
Nikolai Petrushenko, one of the leaders of the hard-line
Soyuz faction credited with forcing the interior
appointments. When this Congress opened, Mr. Gorbachev was
presented with a demand by 53 leading conservatives,
including Armed Forces Chief of Staff Mikhail A. Moiseyev,
that he employ direct rule against secessionist forces. Mr.
Shevardnadze also spoke at length of opposition to his
cooperation with the U.S. over the Persian Gulf, suggesting
military uneasiness over giving up overseas adventures.</p>
<p>And before that, KGB Chairman Vladimir Kryuchkov had
appeared on TV -- unprecedented for a KGB chief -- to demand
restoration of "law and order." He later expanded his brief
TV message in an interview with Izvestia (excerpted nearby),
raising Stalinist images. For example, he deplored "economic
sabotage," which he described as a term that "people
understand." Indeed they do. "Economic crimes" sometimes were
punished by death in the good old days. The KGB chief
blatantly called on Soviet citizens to once again indulge in
that old Stalinist sport, denouncing one's neighbors.</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev has prevailed on Mr. Shevardnadze to stay on
for a while, though a Foreign Ministry spokesman says the
resignation is "irreversible." But clearly Western leaders,
George Bush in particular, should be worried. As Mr.
Shevardnadze pointedly warned, if you create a dictatorship
you can never be sure who the next dictator will be. What
would you think of Vladimir Kryuchkov as the next candidate
to help the West dismantle the Cold War?</p>
