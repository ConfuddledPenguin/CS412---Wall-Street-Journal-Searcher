	<p class="article-leader">Sun Electric Corp. said it plans to report a
fourth-quarter loss and will post a $2.2 million charge in
the quarter to restructure its U.S. automotive diagnostic and
test equipment business.
   In the year-ago fourth quarter, Sun Electric had a loss of
$2.4 million, or 31 cents a share, on sales of $46.7 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Crystal Lake, Ill., maker of auto test and diagnostic
equipment said the restructuring will involve the
reorganization of the company's manufacturing and
distribution operations and a restructuring of its field
sales, service and training organization.</p>
<p>Sun Electric said it expects that the productivity
improvements and cost reduction measures should help to
offset the effects of competitive pricing pressure in the
domestic marketplace. However, it said, as a result of
current competitive pressures on margins, expenses associated
with establishing a new service industry training program and
certain start-up activities, the company expects a loss in
the fourth quarter prior to the inclusion of the charge and a
$700,000 tax expense.</p>
