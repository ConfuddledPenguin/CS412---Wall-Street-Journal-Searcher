	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Edwin T. McBirney III, former owner of Sunbelt
Savings Association of Texas, has agreed to plead guilty to
federal criminal charges and the agreement will be filed
today, his defense attorney said. The filing would come less
than 24 hours after a jury convicted Don R. Dixon, ex-owner
of Vernon Savings & Loan Association.
   Messrs. McBirney and Dixon have been among the
highest-priority targets of the U.S. Justice Department's war
on thrift fraud because of their gaudy life styles and the
millions of dollars in losses racked up by their thrifts.
Winning the cases against two such high-profile defendants is
a major coup for the Justice Department's oft-criticized
Dallas Bank Fraud Task Force.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Dixon was convicted yesterday of 23 federal criminal
charges, most of them related to the use of Vernon funds to
lease a California beach house for the thrift owner. Three of
the charges related to thrift funds that paid for prostitutes
for Vernon board members. The charges carry a maximum
possible prison term of 120 years.</p>
<p>Mr. Dixon was acquitted of 15 other charges relating to
the use of thrift funds to reimburse Vernon employees for
political campaign contributions and out-of-state trips with
the former commissioner of the Texas Savings and Loan
Department.</p>
<p>None of the charges against Mr. Dixon dealt with any of
the questionable loans and real estate transactions that led
to Vernon's losses of almost $2 billion and its collapse in
1987. Because the charges against Mr. Dixon dealt with
relatively low-dollar expenditures, his attorney, William M.
Ravkind, predicted throughout the trial and almost nine days
of jury deliberations that Mr. Dixon would be acquitted.</p>
<p>After the verdict yesterday, Mr. Dixon was ordered jailed
without bond until his sentencing in February, and an
embittered Mr. Ravkind said, "I should have pleaded him
guilty."</p>
<p>The possibility of a substantial prison term following a
guilty verdict may have prompted Mr. McBirney's expected plea
agreement. The former Sunbelt Savings owner faced a maximum
possible sentence of 85 years in prison if convicted of all
17 charges filed against him in his July 11 indictment.</p>
<p>Mr. McBirney's attorney, Paul E. Coggins of Dallas, said
the plea agreement will be filed in federal court in Dallas
today. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. It
wasn't known what specific charges Mr. McBirney was expected
to admit or what the terms of his plea would be.</p>
<p>But in previous plea agreements with thrift executives,
the Justice Department has required defendants to cooperate
in other investigations. Mr. McBirney's cooperation, if
required, could be extremely valuable to prosecutors because
of his extensive dealings with other thrifts and their
executives.</p>
<p>Among the now-failed thrifts that were involved in real
estate and loan transactions with Sunbelt and Mr. McBirney
were San Jacinto Savings Association of Houston, a unit of
Southmark Corp. until its recent seizure by thrift
regulators; Independent American Savings Assocation, which
was owned by Thomas R. Gaubert of Dallas; and Western Savings
Association of Dallas, formerly owned by Jarrett E. Woods Jr.</p>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation has acknowledged an
ongoing criminal investigation of San Jacinto, and Mr.
Gaubert has remained a target of federal prosecutors despite
his acquittal in October 1988 on charges related to loans
from an Iowa thrift. Mr. Woods is scheduled for trial in
January on 37 charges related to the failure of Western
Savings. If convicted, he would face a maximum possible
sentence of 185 years in prison.</p>
