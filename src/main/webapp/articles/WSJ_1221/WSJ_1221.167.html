	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- For anyone starting to feel good about banks
-- good enough, perhaps, to invest in them -- even a modest
decline in the banks' profits from consumer lending would be
a jolt.
   And such a decline appears increasingly likely. Although
nobody expects to see big write-offs such as those being
generated on the real estate and leveraged buy-out fronts,
there are growing signs that consumer lending -- thus far the
one bright area in bank portfolios -- is weakening.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Credit card losses and delinquencies are up. Charge-offs
for bad personal and auto loans are up. And as the country's
economy sours, the leverage of individual households is at
its highest point in decades.</p>
<p>"If you think about the 1980s, the two biggest profit
centers were real estate and consumer banking," says Charles
Peabody, bank analyst at Kidder Peabody. "In real estate,
banks went from being profitable to often losing a lot. In
consumer banking, they will still earn money, but I think
they will earn less." He argues that loan growth will slow --
or perhaps even turn negative -- and loan losses will rise,
doubly affecting bank profits.</p>
<p>Although consumer lending "won't exactly retrace the
footsteps of real estate" and LBO lending, Mr. Peabody writes
in a recent report, consumer loans will -- far from bailing
out troubled banks -- "likely compound their woes."</p>
<p>The report, chillingly titled "The Next Wave? Focus on
Consumer Credit," specifically urges investors to steer clear
of Citicorp, Chase Manhattan, Barnett Banks and Valley
National (Arizona). But its broader message applies to the
many banks that, having been burned on real estate, are
counting on the consumer to bail them out.</p>
<p>In past recessions, consumers who lost jobs or income
reduced their level of borrowings, and analysts expect this
to happen next year as well. "It's inevitable," says Charles
Clough, chief strategist with Merrill Lynch. "Consumers are
slowing their borrowing."</p>
<p>He says that credit cards -- the most expensive form of
debt -- are also the fastest growing line of consumer credit.
Since people don't borrow at high rates except when forced by
circumstances, Mr. Clough says consumers are distressed.
"People are borrowing to pay interest. They are up against
the wall," he says.</p>
<p>As of June 30, the total of non-credit-card personal loans
outstanding with banks was $278 billion -- up only a meager
1.5% from a year earlier, according to Veribanc, a Wakefield,
Mass., bank rating firm. At the time those figures were
compiled, the word recession was barely being mentioned in
polite company. Now that employment is turning down, will
consumer debt be far behind?</p>
<p>Consumers may well retrench more than in past downturns,
because their level of leverage is higher. Kidder say
consumer interest payments are 8.2% of after-tax income,
steady for several years but up significantly from the level
during past recessions.</p>
<p>And loan losses are already rising. In the year ended June
30, according to Veribanc, banks charged off 3.19% of credit
card loans, up from 3.02% in the previous year. For other
personal loans (not including mortgages), charge-offs were
0.93%, up from 0.75%. And yesterday, Moody's Investors
Service reported a big rise in both charge-offs and
delinquencies for the credit card obligations that serve as
the backing for rated credit card securities.</p>
<p>Banks say they expect consumer-lending profits to continue
rising, but their tone is cautious. John Lucking, chief
economist at Valley National, says, "Clearly, in any sort of
downturn consumer debt is more at risk. There is room for
some marginal growth {in 1991}; I'm not expecting phenomenal
growth."</p>
<p>Citicorp says growth rates "are clearly slowing." The bank
won't forecast profits, but an official says the bank's
geographic diversity and superior systems for "tracking"
credit card debt should keep charge-offs in hand. The company
offered some of the same defenses last year, when analysts
began to question its exposure to commercial real estate.
Barnett also says growth is slowing, but it adds that its
older, affluent consumers in Florida are relatively good
credits. It says consumer profits should keep rising.</p>
<p>David Cornell, chief financial officer for Chase's credit
card and related operations, says he has yet to see any
evidence of reduced consumer borrowing. But, he adds, "we are
seeing some increase in delinquencies and charge-off rates in
a number of East Coast states. I don't know how deep that
trend will go." Chase also expects consumer profits to
continue upward.</p>
<p>The extent to which consumer loans go bad, says
Prudential-Bache analyst George Salem, will depend on the
credit culture of individual banks. "What degree of care went
into approving loans? To what extent were bankers seeking
market share at the expense of being prudent?"</p>
<p>On that score, the evidence is grim -- especially in
credit card and in auto loans, probably the two biggest
potential trouble spots. (Mortgage loans are considered the
safest form of personal credit.)</p>
<p>Since the end of the previous recession, Kidder says
credit card debt grew at an annual 17% rate -- and such debt
held by banks grew at a 19% clip. However, the personal
after-tax income available to service that debt grew at only
a 7% rate, Kidder says.</p>
<p>Moreover, new accounts proliferated. At Chase, for
instance, close to one third of all credit card accounts were
established within the past two years. The bank has no record
of how those accounts will fare in tough times, although so
far, Mr. Cornell says, those accounts are performing as
expected.</p>
<p>Car loans are suspect because the terms of such loans have
grown, and because banks have increasingly bought bundles of
such loans from dealers. These so-called indirect loans tend
to produce higher loss rates than loans generated by banks.</p>
<p>If a changing credit culture at banks made credit more
accessible, the culture of consumers has also changed.
Personal bankruptcies are rising, analysts say, partly
because consumers seem to be losing their fear of making such
filings.</p>
<p>"We're seeing some spikes in bankruptcies in some areas,"
says Thomas P. Johnson, Barnett's chief executive officer of
retail banking. "I'm concerned about it; there seems to be a
cultural shift."</p>
<p>Even Newsweek recently counseled readers who lost their
jobs to "make no payments on postponable bills, including
credit card bills, if doing so means that you'll run out of
money within a few months." Lest its readers worry, the
magazine added, "Forget about hurting your credit rating;
it's repairable."</p>
<p>Not exactly music to a banker's ears.</p>
