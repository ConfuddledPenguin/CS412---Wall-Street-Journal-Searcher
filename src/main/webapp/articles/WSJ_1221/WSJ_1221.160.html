	<p class="article-leader">RUSS TOGS Inc. said it omitted its common stock dividend
for the current quarter. The New York-based apparel company
paid a dividend of five cents a share in the previous
quarter. Ken Sitomer, president and chief executive officer,
said, "Faced with a volatile retail environment and a
difficult fourth quarter, the company decided that these
funds would be used to support our new divisions, as well as
a hedge against the future."</p>
