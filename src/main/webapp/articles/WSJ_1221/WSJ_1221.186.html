	<p class="article-leader">Among luxury items this season, champagne may prove to be
the holiday's biggest bargain. While people have begun to
balk at $40,000-$50,000 for a BMW, $10,000 for a Swiss watch
or $3,500 for a case of 1988 La Tache red burgundy, prestige
champagnes like Dom Perignon, Krug, Taittinger Comte de
Champagnes and Bollinger R.D. go for well under $1,000 a
case. These champagnes, in fact, appear to be less affected
by recession quivers in some parts of the country.
   "These wines are insulated," said Larry Shapiro of
Marty's, a leading chain of wine shops in Dallas. "Our
biggest dollar volume by far is Dom Perignon $90, and we
still can't get as much Roederer Cristal $100 as we can
sell."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In Los Angeles, truckloads of Dom Perignon and Dom
Perignon Rose are sold to the Japanese. "I have Japanese
customers who buy 50 cases of Dom Rose and Cristal Rose at a
time," said Steve Wallace of Wally's on Westwood in Los
Angeles, noting that they're the most expensive he sells
($175 and $250 a bottle, respectively). "They ship it to
Japan, where it sells for $400 or $500 a bottle."</p>
<p>California has the Japanese; Texas, having suffered
recession longer than the rest of the country, is on the
rebound and feeling celebratory. Other parts of the country,
however, are seeing a shift away from the prestige blends to
vintage and non-vintage champagne. "This is the first year we
didn't use up our allocations of Dom Perignon and Cristal,"
said Johnson Ho, owner of Knightsbridge Wine Shoppe in
Deerfield, Ill., a North Shore suburb of Chicago. Part of it
has to do with the disappearance of lavish holiday parties
given by investment bankers and brokerage houses in previous
years. "They've pulled back a lot," said Mr. Ho, "but
champagne still has the quality image and continues to be a
big gift item."</p>
<p>Ninety percent of champagne sales are non-vintage brut or
extra dry (brut is actually drier than extra dry). The
personality of an individual brand, or "house style," is most
pronounced in the non-vintage blend that makes up 75% to 85%
of each shipper's production. Some are light and fruity, like
Perrier-Jouet, Lanson or Taittinger; others are deeper,
drier, more classicly structured, such as Bollinger, Pommery
or Veuve Clicquot.</p>
<p>The popularity of individual brands fluctuates widely
around the country. Perrier-Jouet has high visibility on the
East Coast, perhaps because its importer, Seagram Chateau &
Estates, is headquartered in New York, but it is not a hot
item in the west, where champagnes like Pol Roger,
Billecart-Salmon Rose and, lately, Veuve Clicquot have proved
more popular. Moet et Chandon has long been the leader in
Texas and much of the South with its White Star Extra Dry,
but several markets report plummeting demand since Moet
changed the style (it's fruitier and sweeter), upped the
price and dropped the term extra dry from the label. "People
just don't feel it's the same product," said Mr. Shapiro.</p>
<p>The champagne that is gaining ground in virtually every
market, however, is Veuve Clicquot, in top restaurants around
the country as well as in leading wine shops. "Clicquot has
really hit California big in the past two years," said Mr.
Wallace. "It's one of our hottest items this year, that and
Billecart-Salmon." In San Francisco, where Pol Roger and
Bollinger were especially strong in previous years, Veuve
Clicquot has jumped in front. "It's really stolen their
thunder," reports Wilfred Wong of Ashbury Market. "Veuve
Clicquot at $25 a bottle outsells Pol Roger at $18.99 two to
one."</p>
<p>Most of the country's top restaurants stock it; they have
to, they claim, because their customers ask for it. "In the
past year Veuve Clicquot has become our bestselling champagne
by far," says Faith Stewart Gordon, owner of the Russian Tea
Room in New York, where champagne and vodka are top choices
with the restaurant's caviar and smoked salmon.</p>
<p>How does a single brand become the sudden favorite?</p>
<p>"It's more than just cachet," said Mr. Wong. "It's known
as a quality product, very consistent in style, which is
fairly rich. But that bright orange label has helped make it
immediately identifiable. I recently brought Veuve Clicquot
to a tailgate dinner before a 49ers game and people eight or
10 cars away called out, `How's the Clicquot?' "</p>
<p>Veuve Clicquot has always been a major player among the
leading houses of Champagne, especially popular in Europe but
less so in the U.S. until recently. Prior to the mid-'80s the
brand sold roughly 10,000 cases a year in the U.S. Today the
number is 60,000. At a time when most other brands are off 2%
to 8% from last year, Clicquot sales are up 15% this year,
according to Mireille Guiliano, executive vice president and
chief operating officer for Clicquot Inc. in America. Ms.
Guiliano, formerly with the Champagne Information Bureau, a
promotional organization in New York, always felt that Veuve
Clicquot was underrated in the U.S. and had the most
potential because of the company's commitment to quality.
Since 1984 hers has been the guiding hand behind Clicquot's
steady gains.</p>
<p>"We took the long road and built the brand slowly over
seven years," said Ms. Guiliano. "Not everyone is willing to
do that, or can afford to." It doesn't hurt, of course, when
bottles with the familiar pumpkin labels flash across movie
screens in the hands of glamourous women like Michele
Pfeiffer ("The Fabulous Baker Boys"), or that its praises are
sung in the wine-bibber's cult film "Babette's Feast." You'll
catch a glimpse of it as well in "Godfather III," because
it's Francis Ford Coppola's favorite champagne.</p>
<p>Still, every wave must crest. Champagne producers expect a
sharp drop in sales in early 1991 when prices for all
champagne will increase 20% to 30%, reflecting the weak
dollar and higher prices for grapes in Champagne. That will
boost the price for non-vintage brut to $30 a bottle or more,
but Ms. Guiliano is more sanguine than most. "We still have
so many untapped markets," she said, "and Japan is our next
baby."</p>
