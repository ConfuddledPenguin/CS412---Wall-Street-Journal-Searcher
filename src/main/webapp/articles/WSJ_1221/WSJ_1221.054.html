	<p class="article-leader">CLEVELAND -- Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. said it expects to post
a fourth-quarter gain of $47.1 million, or $4.03 a share, as
part of the reorganization of Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Co.
   The gain reflects cash and stock payments to both
Cleveland-Cliffs and a Canadian iron ore joint venture
managed by the iron ore concern. In the 1989 fourth quarter,
Cleveland-Cliffs earned $13.3 million, or $1.12 a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Wheeling-Pittsburgh's reorganization plan was confirmed
this week in a federal bankruptcy court. Distributions to
creditors such as Cleveland-Cliffs will follow a 10-day
appeal period.</p>
<p>Cleveland-Cliffs said pretax receipts are expected to
consist of $56 million in cash and 968,889 new
Wheeling-Pittsburgh common shares valued at $10.9 million.
Wabush Mines, a Canadian iron ore joint venture managed by
Cleveland-Cliffs, is expected to receive $39.7 million,
consisting of $33.3 million in cash and 568,889 shares.
Cleveland-Cliffs' indirect share will be $2.9 million after
tax, which will be retained in Wabush to fund capital
expenditures including a major emission-control project.</p>
<p>Cleveland-Cliffs said its claims reflect damages incurred
when Wheeling-Pittsburgh rejected certain ore purchase
contracts and partnership obligations at the Tilden mine, a
Michigan iron ore facility managed by Cleveland-Cliffs, in
1985.</p>
