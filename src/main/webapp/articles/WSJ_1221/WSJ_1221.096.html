   Changing Games' Names</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>IN COLLEGE bowl games, sponsors grapple with how to score
in the name game.</p>
<p>Over the past four years, corporate sponsors have rushed
to put their names on 12 of 19 college football bowl games.
Despite spending millions of dollars, companies find their
names often slip through the cracks because of inconsistent
media treatment.</p>
<p>For example, Chrysler calls the game to be played on
Christmas Day the Eagle Aloha Bowl, after its Jeep/Eagle
division. That's also how USA Today and the Gannett News
Service refer to it. But in Associated Press stories and this
week's TV Guide, it's simply the Aloha Bowl.</p>
<p>This year, marketers will be closely watching the results
of two so-called sole-title sponsorships. Blockbuster
Entertainment, the video-rental chain, is spending $2.5
million to create the first Blockbuster Bowl. And for the
second year, the former Sun Bowl will be called strictly the
John Hancock Bowl. "We're in this for one thing: visibility,"
says Jack Mahoney, who directs sports marketing for John
Hancock Financial Services.</p>
<p>"This kind of exclusivity may be the focus of the future,"
says Frank Potter, director of marketing for Joyce Julius &
Associates, publisher of Sponsors Report, which monitors
sponsor exposure in televised sports events.</p>

<p>Scrambling to Reach</p>
<p>Yanks Working Abroad</p>
<p>EXPATRIATE executives have to be one of the most
attractive yet elusive targets in marketing. Now, a handful
of companies are developing new ways to reach this mostly
scattered audience.</p>
<p>It's no easy task. Ads, for example, won't help much -- no
single periodical or television or radio station effectively
reaches the estimated three million Americans working abroad.</p>
<p>But for some companies, it's worth the effort. Executives
abroad represent a demographic gold mine. According to
Citibank, the typical U.S. executive working overseas is a
41-year-old married man with children and an annual income of
at least $100,000.</p>
<p>Enter Living Abroad Publishing, a company based in New
York that's preparing to launch two guidebooks for executives
living and working in Europe and Asia. The $45 guides include
information on tax and financial services, travel, children's
education and medical services, such as lists of hospitals
abroad that accept U.S. insurance policies.</p>
<p>Citibank, one of the guide's sponsors, hopes to get a
boost for its own program, Personal Banking for Overseas
Executives. The service, which evolved out of the bank's
in-house program for international staffers, handles
transactions such as paying mortgages for U.S. homes and
insurance premiums. Citibank found that people about to ship
out rarely give much thought to banking. So the bank has been
working with providers of more obvious expatriate services,
such as relocation consultants and language schools, to boost
its program's visibility.</p>
<p>Says Jon B. Clements, president of Clements & Co., a
Washington, D.C., firm that specializes in insurance for
foreign service workers and is increasingly targeting
executives abroad: "The market is endless."</p>
<p>Coke Wins a Round</p>
<p>In Fight With FTC</p>
<p>THE SOFT-DRINK industry has emerged from under a cloud, at
least for now.</p>
<p>In a case stemming from its aborted attempt to acquire Dr
Pepper in 1986, Coca-Cola last week was handed a victory in
an antitrust battle with the Federal Trade Commission.
Administrative Law Judge Lewis Parker could have ordered
Coca-Cola, the nation's No. 1 soft-drink company, to seek FTC
clearance to acquire any soft-drink or bottling operation for
10 years.</p>
<p>Such a ruling, which the FTC sought, could have profoundly
reshaped the nature of competition in the
marketing-intensive, $44 billion soft-drink business. An
unfettered PepsiCo, for instance, could have scanned the
beverage landscape and cherry-picked bottlers or smaller
root-beer or specialty soft-drink companies, while Coca-Cola
would have to wade through the federal bureaucracy to pull
off any deals.</p>
<p>Coca-Cola won't comment on the ruling, which the FTC says
it may appeal.</p>
<p>The ruling "could have handcuffed Coke's abilities to deal
in a hotly competitive marketplace," says Jesse Meyers,
publisher of Beverage Digest newsletter. Also, industry
executives fretted that the case could have led to
governmental interference with other soda companies.</p>
<p>Odds & Ends</p>
<p>CARRYOUT rip-offs were uncovered in an undercover sweep of
254 delis, salad bars, bakeries and supermarkets in New York.
City inspectors estimate that paying for the weight of salad
containers alone costs New Yorkers $12 million a year. . . .
