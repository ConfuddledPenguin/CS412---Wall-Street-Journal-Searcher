	<p class="article-leader">Halliburton Co. said the Internal Revenue Service notified
the company that it may have underpaid its federal corporate
income taxes for the years 1980 through 1986 by as much as
$247 million, excluding interest.
   The Dallas oil field services concern is disputing the
allegation and has filed claims with the agency seeking the
refund at about $115 million, excluding interest, for the
six-year period in question.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A spokesman for Halliburton said "a settlement may be
worked out" before the matter is heard in the U.S. Tax Court.
He added that a court date hasn't been set and that the
company believes that the ultimate resolution of the matter
won't have any material impact on operating results.</p>
