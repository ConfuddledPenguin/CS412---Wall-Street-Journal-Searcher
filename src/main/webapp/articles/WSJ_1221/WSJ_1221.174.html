	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Over-the-counter stocks rose despite the
uncertainty of Soviet politics to post yet another gain.
   The advance represented a reversal from a rapid morning
fall. Traders took stock prices sharply lower in the first
hour on worries about how the resignation of Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze would affect international
relations.</p>

1.08 points, or 0.29%, to close at 372.30. The New York Stock

Traders looking for a correction took the market lower while
institutions looking to upgrade their portfolios brought it
back up.</p>
<p>"Traders are generally looking for a little correction on
the downside. It doesn't seem to be happening," said Ron
Catalano, executive vice president for trading at Prescott
Ball & Turben.</p>
<p>The Shevardnadze news prompted those anticipating a
correction to mark down prices.</p>
<p>"We're at the high end of a trading range, and everybody's
a little gun shy," Mr. Catalano said.</p>
<p>Lower prices, however, enticed many institutions looking
to improve their portfolios before year end to start buying,
said Ralph Costanza, head of OTC trading at Smith Barney,
Harris Upham.</p>
<p>Mr. Constanza said the institutions confined their
shopping primarily to larger issues. Among the institutional
targets were Apple Computer, up 2 1/8 to 44, and Intel, up 1
1/4 to 39.</p>
<p>In the broader market, advancers edged out decliners, 967
to 943. National Market System volume was active at 131.9
million shares, well ahead of Wednesday's 114 million.</p>
<p>Apple Computer's 5% rise continues a recent trend. Apple
shares have climbed almost 18 points in the past two months.

upgrading its rating to "strong buy" on the strength of good
demand for Apple products.</p>
<p>Interim Systems was the most active stock. H&R Block began
