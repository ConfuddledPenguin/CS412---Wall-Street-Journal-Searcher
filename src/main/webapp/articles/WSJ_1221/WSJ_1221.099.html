	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- U.S. health-care spending climbed more than
11% last year, according to a government report.
   A Department of Health and Human Services report showed
that health-care spending totaled $604.1 billion in 1989, an
11.1% increase from $544 billion in 1988.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan said in a statement that the
numbers disclosed a continuing but alarming trend. "Steep
increases in health costs are limiting access to health care
and imposing a heavy burden on individuals, industries and
government," he said.</p>
<p>"It doesn't come as a surprise," said Gail Wilensky,
administrator of the department's Health Care Financing
Administration. "It shows our continuing inability to reduce
high rates of spending on health care."</p>
<p>In 1989, Americans spent $530.7 billion on personal
health-care services directly benefiting the patient -- an
increase of 10.6% from 1988. The U.S. inflation rate during
the same period was only 4.8%.</p>
<p>"It may be incredible, but its been the same incredible
numbers for years," said Mark Pauly, professor of health-care
systems at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.</p>
<p>The report attributed the increased spending to inflation,
including health-care-related costs, as well as to the
growing number of older Americans.</p>
<p>Health-care expenditures grew to 11.6% of the nation's
gross national product in 1989 from 11.2% in 1988. In 1979,
heath-care spending made up only 8.6% of GNP.</p>
