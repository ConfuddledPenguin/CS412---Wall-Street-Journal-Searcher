	<p class="article-leader">SYDNEY, Australia -- Petersville Sleigh Ltd., a food,
resources and shipping concern that is an associate of
Adelaide Steamship Co., said it sold its entire stake in
Howard Smith Ltd., another associate, for 167 million
Australian dollars (US$128.9 million).
   The shares in Howard Smith, a shipping and engineering
concern, were sold to local and overseas institutions for
about A$3.95 a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Adelaide Steamship announced in November a plan to cut
debt by A$3 billion and restructure. It had been criticized
by analysts for its complex holdings among associate
companies and said it would eliminate the cross-ownership.</p>
<p>Bob Cumberlidge, managing director of Petersville Sleigh,
said the sale price reflects current market value and gives
the company A$1.5 million in net proceeds that will be used
to reduce debt.</p>
