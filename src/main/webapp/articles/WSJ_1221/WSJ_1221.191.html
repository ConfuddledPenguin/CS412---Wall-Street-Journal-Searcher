	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. said it will begin a
special program to buy back shares of its Class H common
stock from GM executives who receive them as part of their
compensation.
   About 4,800 GM employees own approximately 2.7 million
Class H shares that are eligible for the one-year program. GM
Class H shares represent a dividend interest in GM's GM
Hughes Electronics Corp. subsidiary. That unit contains the
defense operations of Hughes Aircraft Co. and the automotive
electronics operations of Delco Electronics Corp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A GM spokesman said the company will buy the Class H
shares back at market prices, beginning in January. GM Class
H shares closed yesterday at $18.75, up 25 cents in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
<p>GM said the program will benefit employees by providing a
ready buyer for the thinly traded Class H shares. The program
also will help GM meet a goal of buying back 10 million Class
H shares. That repurchase was supposed to be finished by the
end of this year, but GM is still about 5.4 million shares
short of the target.</p>
<p>Approximately 88 million Class H shares are outstanding,
but about 65 million of those are held by the Howard Hughes
Medical Institute, which sold Hughes Aircraft to GM in 1985
in return for cash and Class H stock then valued at $5.2
billion.</p>
<p>In 1989, GM and the Hughes Institute agreed to a complex
restructuring of the original purchase. As part of that
restructuring, GM paid the Institute an additional $975
million in cash and notes, and received 35 million Class H
shares from the Institute. GM agreed to buy back the bulk of
the Institute's remaining Class H shares by 1995 at $30 a
share. GM also got the option to repurchase still more Class
H shares from the Institute at $35 a share, even if the
market price is higher.</p>
