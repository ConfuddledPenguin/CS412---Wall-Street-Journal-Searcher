	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Amid signs of a deepening recession,
businesses are scaling back their capital investment plans,
the Commerce Department reported.
   In the government's first survey of capital spending plans
for next year, businesses told the department that they
planned to increase their spending for new plant and
equipment a cautious 2.4% in 1991 over 1990.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>According to the survey taken in October and November,
businesses expected to increase capital spending 5.2% in 1990
over 1989. That estimate has headed steadily downward this
year along with the outlook for the economy, according to the
quarterly surveys.</p>
<p>In the January-to-March survey, capital spending in 1990
was expected to increase 8.1%. In the second quarter,
businesses told the department they expected a 6.8% increase
in investment. By the third quarter, a 5.4% gain was
predicted.</p>
<p>The 5.2% increase now expected would put plant and
equipment spending for the year at $533.91 billion. In 1989,
spending rose 11.4%, following an 11% jump in 1988.</p>
<p>After adjustment for inflation, the spending figures
evince even less confidence on the part of businesses: The
increase in 1990 would be 4.1% and the increase in 1991 would
be a tiny 0.4%.</p>
<p>"These are all slumpy, recessionary numbers," said
Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist with Bear Stearns & Co. in
New York.</p>
<p>In fact, some economists said actual spending in 1990 and
plans for 1991 may well come down from the October and
November survey estimates. A spate of economic reports in
recent weeks have suggested that the economy took a serious
tumble in the fourth quarter. Manufacturing slowdowns have
pushed up unemployment, the trade deficit has worsened and
consumer spending has risen only slightly.</p>
<p>The October-to-November survey is "still an optimistic
reading," said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Boston Co. He
said the downturn in the economy has been so sharp in the
fourth quarter that inflation-adjusted capital spending plans
for 1991 likely would turn down in the next quarterly survey.</p>
<p>The 2.4% increase anticipated next year would be the
smallest capital investment increase since a 2.6% decline in
1986.</p>
<p>Manufacturers, in particular, were planning to restrict
their capital spending sharply from previous years. They said
they planned a 0.7% increase in 1991, following an expected
4.6% increase this year and gains of 12.5% in 1989 and 15.9%
in 1988. Within the manufacturing category, makers of durable
goods -- more expensive items intended to last at least three
years -- expected to decrease spending 0.8% next year after
an increase this year of 1.4%. Nondurable goods makers were
planning a 1.8% increase next year, following a 7.3% rise
this year.</p>
<p>Nonmanufacturing businesses said they expected to boost
spending 3.4% next year, compared with an expected 5.6%
increase in 1990 and increases of 10.8% in 1989 and 8.4% in
1988.</p>
<p>The figures are adjusted for seasonal variations.</p>
