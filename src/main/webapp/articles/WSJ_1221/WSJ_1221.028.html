	<p class="article-leader">My appetite's growin' faster than Santa's sleigh.
   Ain't no time for diets, so forget about bein' thin.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>'Cause the amount of food that we'll consume</p>
<p>It will cause our bellies to balloon.</p>
<p>-- "Ain't No Time for Diets"</p>
<p>O.K., so "White Christmas" it isn't. But rhythm and blues
singer Janey Clewer is still hoping her new song about the
travails of dieting during the holidays will help push her
new Christmas album to the top of the charts. "I think
there's a place for both old and new Christmas music," says
Ms. Clewer.</p>
<p>Fat chance.</p>
<p>Each December, with visions of dollar signs dancing in
their heads, songwriters and singers come out with new
Christmas tunes to add to the hundreds that already have been
recorded. The 1980s brought such would-be classics as "Wreck
the Malls," "Somebody Stole My Santa Claus Suit," "Funky,
Funky Christmas," "The 12 Pains of Christmas" and "Santa Got
a DWI."</p>
<p>Most flop, miserably. "Basically, Christmas is etched in
stone as far as the market goes. It's hard to break that,"
says Troy White, national director of progressive music for
Epic Records, a unit of CBS Records Inc. "Artists hope
they'll have the next `White Christmas,' but it doesn't
happen."</p>
<p>But they keep trying anyway because writing a hit
Christmas tune is the next best thing to cornering the market
on mistletoe and Christmas trees: Each year, different
singers record the hits -- and the royalties flow in. Since
1945, when Mel Torme and Robert Wells wrote "A Christmas
Song" (better known by its first line: "Chestnuts roasting on
an open fire"), more than 550 versions of it have been
recorded, by everyone from Ramsey Lewis to Barbra Streisand
to Fred Waring and the Pennsylvanians. Messrs. Torme and
Wells still each receive more than $100,000 a year in
royalties. "It's a bloody king's ransom," says Mr. Torme.</p>
<p>"Silver Bells," written in 1950 for a Bob Hope movie
called "The Lemon Drop Kid" and since recorded by everyone
from Elvis Presley to the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, still
brings in more than $50,000 a year in royalties for each of
its two writers, Ray Evans and Jay Livingston. "We wrote it
very reluctantly because psychologically we believed all the
good Christmas songs had already been written," says Mr.
Evans. "Luckily, it was first sung by Bing Crosby, so it sold
around 125 million records." Bing Crosby also, of course,
sang "White Christmas," the best-selling Christmas single
ever.</p>
<p>If it's any encouragement to modern-day Christmas song
writers, even unlikely melodies have become classics. It took
Donald Gardner just 30 minutes to write "All I Want for
Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth" in 1944 for a second-grade
class he taught in Smithtown, N.Y. Three years later, he
played the tune at a music teachers' conference for a friend,
a representative of a music-publishing company, who liked it.
It was recorded by Spike Jones, released in 1948 and sold 1.8
million records in seven weeks. Mr. Gardner knows of 25
different versions -- including one by Dread Zepplin, a
reggae-rock band -- but he's sure there are more. "I scout
around every year just to see what's there. On Dec. 26, I
turn into a pumpkin."</p>
<p>But coming up with a new hit is nearly as hard as spotting
Santa coming down the chimney. The last Christmas singles to
make Billboard Magazine's weekly top 10 list for pop music,
both in December 1958, were "The Chipmunk Song" by David
Seville and the Chipmunks (best known words: "Alvin] ALVIN]")
and "Jingle Bell Rock" by Joe Beal and Jim Boothe. "Chipmunk"
ranked No. 1 and was on the charts for 13 weeks. "Jingle Bell
Rock," sung by Bobby Helms, ranked No. 6 and was on the
charts for 21 weeks.</p>
<p>A Christmas song hasn't even made it into Billboard's top
100 singles since 1984 ("Do They Know It's Christmas?" which
was part of a charity album to aid the Ethiopian famine, and
"The Greatest Gift of All" by Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton.)
One problem is that the topic is awfully well worn. Ms.
Clewer says writing Christmas music is "lyrically confining
because you have to conform to Christmas and find some new
twist." And most folks prefer golden oldies anyway. "Nat King
Cole, Barbra Streisand, Frank Sinatra -- all those lines sell
steadily every year," says Robert Stapleton, district manager
at Tower Records in Boston.</p>
<p>Moreover, new Christmas songs get little radio air time
because stations have curtailed playing carols. Unlike the
Christmas shopping season, which has expanded, now starting
before Thanksgiving, the Christmas carol season has been
shrinking. Once as long as six weeks, it now is only two or
three weeks.</p>
<p>KJLH in Los Angeles, for example, began playing 10
Christmas songs a day about 18 days before Christmas. It has
14 carols on its frequent-play list, only four of which were
released in 1990. The top requested carol? "The Christmas
Song," recorded by Nat King Cole in 1946.</p>
<p>For lesser-known artists, this is bad news. "Lack of
exposure of new songs prevents them from being accepted,"
says Harold Bronson, managing director of Rhino Records Inc.,
a Los Angeles record company. So, to compete with the songs
of Christmases past, many musicians have abandoned schmaltz
for smirks. Consider 1987's "Wreck the Malls:"</p>
<p>Wreck the malls this Xmas season</p>
<p>Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.</p>
<p>Blow your cash for no good reason</p>
<p>Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.</p>
<p>Such songs irritate purists like Mr. Torme, 65. Of 1986's
"Santa Got a DWI," Mr. Torme says, "How would real Christians
feel if Santa came home drunk?" Adds Clarence James, an
analyst for a Stamford, Conn., finance company who buys a few
Christmas albums every year, "Christmas is not a funny time
of year. It has very serious meaning. Singing `Grandma Got
Run Over by a Reindeer' {a 1979 tune} isn't my idea of
Christmas. . . . Just by the very title, I wouldn't buy it.
If I heard it on the radio, I'd change the station."</p>
<p>Judging by some recent hits, realism may be in. Barry
Manilow's hot-selling new album, "Because It's Christmas,"
which has sold 600,000 copies in just one month (Billboard's
No. 40 album this week), includes a song he co-wrote with the
late Johnny Mercer titled "I Guess There Ain't No Santa
Claus." Some of the lyrics:</p>
<p>I got evenings to share that nobody will spare.</p>
<p>I guess there ain't no Santa Claus.</p>
<p>I don't flirt. I don't dance. 'Cause I don't get a chance.</p>
<p>I guess there ain't no Santa Claus.</p>
<p>Why so gloomy? "I didn't want to write about `Winter
Wonderland' or `Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.' I think we
have enough of that," says Mr. Manilow. "I wanted to write
more of a jazz album . . . aimed at adult, romantic
feelings."</p>
<p>Eric Mercury's 1989 song "Christmas Presence" on the
"Christmas Cheers from Motown" album tells about a little
girl longing for her absent father to return home for
Christmas. Mr. Mercury is sure that the song is so close to
reality for many of today's children of divorced parents that
it just might become a classic. "White Christmas, chestnuts
roasting, I love that stuff. But it doesn't exist anymore,"
he says. "It's a different society now than when all those
songs were written."</p>
<p>"I Guess There Ain't No Santa Claus" was written by Eddie
Arkin, Barry Manilow and Johnny Mercer and published by BMPI
Music, Lismore Music and Somisongs. "Ain't No Time for Diets"
was written by Janey Clewer and Randy Waldman and published
by Preacher's Kid Publishing and Great Randini Music. "Wreck
the Malls" was written by Bob Rivers, Dennis Amero and Brian
Silva and published by Solid Smash Music Publishing Co.</p>
