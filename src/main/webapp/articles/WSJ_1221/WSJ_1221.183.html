	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- Bondholders of Bank of New England Corp.
tentatively agreed to a debt-for-equity swap that would give
them 92% of the company's common stock and give the bank
breathing room in its effort to survive.
   By reducing bank's debt payments, the swap of $706 million
in debentures for almost all newly issued stock would ease a
squeeze on the bank's cash while it struggles to recover from
bad real estate loans that have resulted in steep losses.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The swap is a necessary but not sufficient condition for
survival," said Don Kauth, an analyst with First Albany Corp.
"The added capital would certainly buy them some time, maybe
three or four quarters of time."</p>
<p>Even with a successful swap, "the bank needs economic
growth in the region so it can begin booking good loans and
grow out of its problems, just like Bank of America did a few
years ago," says Gerard Cassidy, an analyst with Tucker,
Anthony and R.L. Day in Portland, Maine. "Of course, the New
England economy might not turn up for another year. The
bank's destiny is, at this point, not within their control."</p>
<p>BNE has some 69,545,000 common shares outstanding now. In
composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange,
BNE common closed at $1.125, up 12.5 cents.</p>
<p>The tentative agreement, following months of negotiations,
was reached by committees representing bondholders and must
still be approved by the Bank of New England's directors,
according to people familiar with the negotiations. The
bank's shareholders -- whose stake would be severely diluted
-- also must approve the swap. In addition, at least 90% of
the bonds must be tendered for the swap to proceed.</p>
<p>Bondholders had initially hoped to get a combination of
cash and stock for their bonds, but the bank is cash-starved
and according to bank officials, regulators have directed the
bank to apply cash gleaned from recent asset sales to other
needs.</p>
<p>Bank of New England's current capital cushion is a thin
$255 million, or 1.1% of its total assets of $23 billion. The
swap, if it moves forward, will save the bank about $60
million a year in interest payments and boost its capital to
nearly 3%, a level regulators mandated the bank reach by last
spring. Healthy banks have capital levels of 6% or more.</p>
<p>The arrangement would split the bank's 92% ownership
almost evenly between holders of $181 million of senior debt
and holders of $525 million of subordinated debt. Under the
plan, bondholders also would receive another $100 million in
newly issued debt; the new bonds won't pay interest but are
eventually redeemable for cash or stock in five years.
Committees representing bondholders want new bonds issued so
that they will have some contractual claims on assets if the
bank fails or is purchased; debt holders' claims take
priority to stockholders in cases of bankruptcies or
failures. Bank officials declined to comment.</p>
<p>The bank is currently burdened by $2.84 billion in
nonperforming assets -- mostly commercial real estate loans
-- that have been rising steadily through 1990 as the New
England economy continues to slump. The carrying costs of
such bad assets, estimated at $250 million annually, are
largely responsible for the bank losing $203 million in the
first nine months of this year.</p>
<p>If the swap were to fail because not enough bondholders
participate, most analysts agree that the bank would be
unable to survive for long.</p>
