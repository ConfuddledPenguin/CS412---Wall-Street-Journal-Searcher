	<p class="article-leader">HARTFORD, Conn. -- Standard & Poors Corp. said it lowered
its rating on the claims-paying ability of Travelers
Indemnity Co. Intercompany Pool, the property-casualty
company of Travelers Corp., to double-A from double-A-plus.
   The rating concern said the action on the insurer reflects
S&P's view that "property-casualty conditions will continue
to deteriorate over the near term."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>S&P also downgraded to double-A from double-A-plus its
rating on the subsidiaries of the property-casualty company,
including Charter Oak Fire Insurance Co., Phoenix Insurance
Co., Travelers Indemnity Co. of America, Travelers Indemnity
Co. of Illinois and Travelers Indemnity Co. of Rhode Island.</p>
<p>This marked the third S&P downgrading of Travelers Corp.'s
businesses since the company announced a $650 million
addition to loss reserves for mortgage loans and real estate
investments and a dividend cut on Oct. 5. S&P has since
reduced its ratings on the senior debt and commercial paper
of the holding company, and the claims-paying ability of
Travelers Insurance Co., the life insurance company, to
single-A-plus from double-A-minus.</p>
<p>In the property-casualty company's downgrading, S&P cited
its expectation that Travelers Corp.'s problems with its real
estate and mortgage portfolios will leave the
property-casualty business less flexible financially.</p>
<p>A Travelers spokesman said that the rating action was
expected and that a double-A rating is "considered very
strong."</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Travelers shares closed at $17.125, up 12.5 cents, on volume
of more than 1.9 million shares.</p>
