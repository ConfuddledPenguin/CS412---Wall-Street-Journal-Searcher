	<p class="article-leader">GLOOMIER OECD PREDICTIONS</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Worse-than-expected U.S. economic data have caused the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to
revise downward already gloomy predictions about the world
economy.</p>
<p>Scrapping forecasts compiled just a month ago, the OECD
now says the U.S. economy probably didn't grow at all in the
second half of this year, and the total output of growth and
services may decline during the first half of next year.
Previous projections were for 0.6% growth in each of those
periods.</p>
<p>The only good news in the 24-nation organization's
prognosis is that the stagnant U.S. economy won't drag down
other industrial economies as much as in past recessions. "We
don't see an OECD-wide recession coming," said Stephen
Potter, an OECD economist. Continued growth in Germany and
Japan is the main factor keeping the broader group of nations
from sinking further economically.</p>
<p>Factoring in the worsening outlook in the U.S., OECD chief
economist David Henderson estimated that growth in 1990 for
the 24 nations would come to 2.7%.</p>
<p>AUSTRALIA VS. INSIDER TRADING</p>
<p>Penalties for insider trading in Australia will be
increased sharply under draft legislation made public
yesterday. Attorney General Michael Duffy said the
legislation would see the maximum penalty for individuals
convicted of insider trading lifted to 200,000 Australian
dollars (US$154,340) from A$20,000 currently. The maximum
penalty for corporations would increase to A$1 million from
A$50,000 currently. Mr. Duffy said the higher penalties
"signaled in no uncertain terms . . . that insider trading
won't be tolerated."</p>
<p>PRIVATIZING PORTUGAL'S PRESS</p>
<p>Portugal announced plans to complete its privatization of
the press, with the sale of the prestigious daily newspaper
Diario de Noticias. The sale of two million of the paper's
shares is expected to bring the state about 10 billion
escudos ($75 million). The real-estate value of the paper's
offices in downtown Lisbon accounts for almost half the
price.</p>
<p>ISRAEL-CHINA TIES</p>
<p>Israel may send three diplomats to Beijing to upgrade the
status of an academicliaison office in the Chinese capital.
The three would be the first Israeli diplomats sent to China,
the Jerusalem Post reported. The Foreign Ministry declined
comment on the report. But a government source said the
dispatch of diplomats to China was "a major possibility" that
required only final approval.</p>
<p>GROWING THREAT TO WORLD HEALTH</p>
<p>An estimated 250 million or more sexually transmitted
infections -- including syphilis, genital herpes, gonorrhea
and the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV -- occur
annually around the world, and the number is increasing,
according to the World Health Organization. "Sexually
transmitted infections are not under control, either in the
developed or developing world," said Andre Meheus, chief
medical officer of the WHO Program of Sexually Transmitted
Diseases. WHO said, "Prevention of sexually transmitted
diseases and infections is rendered difficult by a variety of
factors, including the relative ease of transmission, the
difficulties of changing sexual behavior {and} the lack of
vaccines or, in some cases, curative treatments."</p>
<p>REPEAL OF APARTHEID LAWS?</p>
<p>A leading South African newspaper reported that the South
African government would announce plans to repeal major
apartheid laws when Parliament opens Feb. 1. Business Day
said President F.W. de Klerk is expected to call for the
scrapping of the Group Areas Act, which segregates
neighborhoods by race, and the Land Acts, which reserve 87%
of the country's land for the white minority.</p>
<p>LARGEST OVERSEAS INVESTOR</p>
<p>JAPAN became the world's largest investor in overseas
industry and property in 1989, surpassing Britain, the Japan
External Trade Organization said in its annual report on
direct investment.</p>
<p>The U.S. remained the largest recipient of
direct-investment funds in the year. But the report shows
increasing flows of funds to Europe, and large cross-border
investment within both that region and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>A total of $197.878 billion was spent in direct investment
in 1989, an increase of 21.5% from the previous year, the
organization said. It estimated that the total amount of
outstanding cross-border investment was $1.263 trillion at
the end of the year. Direct investment includes investment in
companies, factories and property, but not securities
purchases or similar purely financial transactions.</p>
<p>Japan invested $44.13 billion overseas in 1989, up 29%
from the previous year, the organization said, bringing its
total direct investment overseas to $154.4 billion. Behind
Japan were Britain, in 1988 the largest investing country,
with $31.753 billion, down 13.8%, for a total of 191.9
billion; and the U.S., with $31.722 billion, up 80.9%, for a
total of 373.4 billion.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>In London, Christie's auctioned the Jewish marriage
certificate of Marilyn Monroe and Arthur Miller for $13,700.
. . . Twenty-eight art masterpieces seized from French
citizens by the Nazis have been found in a cupboard at a
Berlin museum, the French magazine L'Express reported. The
trove is said to include works by Monet, Renoir and Gauguin.</p>
