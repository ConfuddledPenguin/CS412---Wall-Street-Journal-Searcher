	<p class="article-leader">BRUSSELS -- The European Community's much-heralded attempt
to beam super-sharp television pictures to a new generation
of television sets is experiencing static interference.
   The plan for high-definition television, or HDTV, is aimed
at giving EC companies a head start on replacing the world's
650 million television sets with new, more expensive models
that would deliver movie-theater quality to the living room.
The 625 million-European-currency-unit ($860 million)
project, considered by some a model for public-private
cooperation, would show how EC companies could meet the
Japanese challenge.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But technology and economics have conspired to throw the
community's HDTV strategy into disarray. The confusion, many
consumer electronics experts believe, is likely to increase
HDTV development costs and lengthen the time required to
create a marketable new generation of television sets and
programs.</p>
<p>"It will be another 10 years or so before the HDTV market
takes off," says Sjef Stoop, a researcher at the SOBE
research institute in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, which
specializes in consumer electronics. Dataquest Europe in
London also projects that sales of HDTV sets in Europe won't
begin to take off before the end of the decade.</p>
<p>That could be more bad news for Europe's struggling
electronics giants N.V. Philips and Thomson S.A., which are
betting a big part of their future on HDTV.</p>
<p>Before the most recent European troubles with HDTV,
electronics companies here were struggling to catch up with
Japan. Sony Corp. has had a working version of HDTV for five
years and has been selling professional HDTV equipment for
video film makers for more than two years. And last week,
Sony became the first company to sell $18,000 HDTV sets in
Japan.</p>
<p>However, the Japanese standard is incompatible with the
planned European one and is said by technical experts to have
other disadvantages that could limit its world-wide
acceptability.</p>
<p>While the EC industry had been making impressive progress
in its attempt to compete with the Japanese, that effort
received a setback last month linked to the merger between
two U.K.-based broadcasters, British Satellite Broadcasting
Ltd. and Sky Television. BSB was one of the few EC
broadcasters already using an early version of the European
standard, known as MAC (for multiplexed analog components),
which was to evolve into the European version of HDTV. Now
that BSB has merged with Sky, the new company, British Sky
Broadcasting, plans to drop BSB's experiment with MAC and to
connect the 120,000 BSB subscribers to the conventional
satellite broadcasting system now used by Sky.</p>
<p>That means that a new potential market for MAC television
sets, which both Philips and Thomson were planning to launch
next year, has been lost. Both companies have invested
heavily in developing and marketing MAC receivers, though
neither will say how much, and they had been counting on a
growing EC market. The European Community in 1986 passed a
directive requiring all direct-broadcast satellites, such as
the one used by BSB, to use MAC broadcasting technology.
British Sky Broadcasting, the new company, will broadcast on
a satellite that escapes the jurisdiction of the 1986
directive.</p>
<p>Both companies say they will go ahead as planned and
launch the $7,000 MAC TV sets, uncertain exactly when
programs will be available.</p>
<p>Philips declines to discuss how the British merger affects
the prospects for HDTV, but the company last week announced
that it had filed a suit against BSB and Sky charging breach
of agreements involving the technology. Philips also declines
to discuss the effect of the loss of the British market for
MAC television sets.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for British Sky Broadcasting Ltd. declined
to comment on the Philips suit.</p>
<p>But failure to ignite much consumer interest in its MAC
equipment and lack of a significant improvement in picture
quality are the reasons that BSB found itself unable to
continue as an independent company, according to officials of
the newly merged one. Even those who eventually do buy MAC
television sets will see very little difference, British Sky
Broadcasting officials said.</p>
<p>Moroever, BSB had spent so much on technology that it was
unable to invest adequately on programming.</p>
<p>"This market wants more TV programs, not more technology,"
says a spokeswoman for British Sky Broadcasting in London.</p>
<p>But television marketing experts and broadcasting
companies argue that the blow to the MAC system in Britain is
just a taste of the market rejection it will experience in
other countries. If Europe's electronics companies continue
to pursue MAC, they could end up pouring money into another
bottomless technological pit, these critics say.</p>
<p>"European companies still have every chance to succeed in
the HDTV market," says Jean-Luc Renaud, a senior consultant
at Logica Communications Ltd. in London. "But that requires
that they accept that the MAC system is dead and move quickly
to develop other alternatives."</p>
<p>Other experts also say that the EC's standard for HDTV
stands little chance of winning acceptance outside Europe
unless it is further perfected. HDTV experts in the U.S.
Federal Communications Commission, for example, have refused
to adopt the European standard for U.S. broadcasts, arguing
that it has limitations.</p>
<p>Instead, because of the limited availability of
broadcasting satellites, many U.S. researchers favor a
digital HDTV system that is delivered to homes on telephone
cables. If European companies want a chance at capturing more
than just the EC market, Mr. Renaud says, European
manufacturers need to cooperate with Japanese companies to
come up with a more flexible and more widely accepted world
standard.</p>
<p>European MAC broadcasts can be received by a regular
television set by adding a decoder, costing around $400. MAC
televison sets would be sold for the limited number of
top-of-the-market consumers who wanted immediate improvements
in picture and sound quality. MAC television sets will appear
much like the final HDTV set, featuring a ratio of length to
height of 16 to 9, similar to that of movie theater screens.</p>
<p>Once enough MAC broadcasts are launched, the HD-MAC
standard, creating full-fledged HDTV, would be introduced.
(At that point, consumers who wanted to receive the full
effect of the HDTV broadcasts would have to buy an HDTV set.
Without a new HDTV set, viewers wouldn't see improved
pictures.)</p>
<p>This strategy initially was considered attractive because
it allowed a phased-in development of HDTV, much as color
broadcasting gradually replaced black and white. The
competing Japanese standard for HDTV wouldn't allow such
phased-in development.</p>
<p>But even before the BSB-Sky merger, this EC strategy was
being undermined by fast-moving technology and entrepreneurs
who saw opportunities in bucking the system.</p>
<p>First, Societe Europeene des Satellites, an innovative
Luxembourg-based company, launched Astra, a low-powered
satellite that found a legal way to escape the EC's 1986
directive. Astra now broadcasts 16 channels across Europe,
only two of which use the MAC system.</p>
<p>Jonathan Drazin of Dataquest Europe says the demise of the
MAC system wouldn't necessarily be a major blow to HDTV in
Europe. He argues that going through the interim step could
even harm the prospects of HDTV in the long run. Consumers
who bought decoders to receive the MAC broadcasts might be
happy enough with that and not want to buy HDTV at all, he
says.</p>
<p>Some analysts say the whole HDTV program needs to be
rethought, with more imput from broadcasters, program-makers,
consumers and private investors. "Let's hope that this time,
technologists and politicians will share the platform with
entrepreneurs and consumers," says Logica's Mr. Renaud.</p>
