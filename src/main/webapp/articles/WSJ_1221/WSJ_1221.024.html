	<p class="article-leader">JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Plans for another in a series of big
Indonesian petrochemical projects should fall in place by the
end of the year. But the ownership of this one has turned out
far different than originally planned: Private investors,
including a son of President Suharto, won't have a role.
   Initially, the project was structured as a $916 million
investment that would have included an equity interest held
by Humpuss Group, controlled by Hutomo Mandala Putra, the
youngest of Mr. Suharto's three sons. However, Humpuss
dropped plans to invest with a unit of Thyssen AG of Germany
and M.W. Kellogg Co. of the U.S. in the large upstream
aromatics plant in Sumatra. Instead, Pertamina, the state oil
company, will be sole owner of a scaled-down version of the
plant, on which construction is likely to begin in early
1991.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Humpuss and the other private investors gave up on their
project when they couldn't secure sufficient support from
Pertamina. Earlier this year, the oil company told the
private investors it could guarantee only about half the
volume of feedstock they were seeking, making their aromatics
plan financially unfeasible. Aromatics are chemicals derived
from oil and gas and processed to make fibers, detergents and
other end-products.</p>
<p>Humpuss distributes one petrochemical for Pertamina, but
has been looking to invest in production. It will do so soon,
though not in nearly as big a fashion as it had hoped: Under
an agreement announced in late October, it will be a partner
in a $200 million venture to use paraxylene supplied by the
aromatics plant to produce purified terepththalic acid, or
PTA, which is used to make synthetic fiber for the textile
industry.</p>
<p>If current plans proceed, all three of Mr. Suharto's sons
will have a role in Indonesia's petrochemical industry. Sigit
Harjojudanto, the eldest, has a personal stake with a unit of
British Petroleum Co. in a $400 million plant being built to
make polyethylene. Bambang Trihatmodjo, the second son,
expects his Bimantara Citra Group to sign a joint-venture
with foreign concerns led by Royal/Dutch Shell Group for a
$1.7 billion olefins center.</p>
<p>The inability of the private aromatics venture to proceed
surprised many Jakarta businessmen, who had assumed that with
politically well-connected Humpuss as a partner, the
consortium could get any government assistance it needed.
Some business analysts speculate that Pertamina withheld the
volume of feedstock requested because it didn't want private
investors to control an upstream project.</p>
<p>Kartiyoso, Pertamina's deputy director for processing,
disagrees. The state oil company was unable to meet the
private investors' request because of changing projections of
total demand for Pertamina's feedstock supply and its
long-term availability, he says. "They started with a very
big project," he says of the private investors. "It's not
viable from our point of view."</p>
<p>Had it gone ahead, the Humpuss consortium's project would
have become the world's second-largest benzene producer.
"This would have projected Humpuss on the aromatics map,"
says Hasan Soedjono, assistant to the chairman, Mr. Hutomo.</p>
<p>On the decision to drop the venture, Mr. Hasan says,
"Initially, we thought we had the feedstock. We were wrong."
He describes the change away from a private venture as "`New
Order' pragmatism at work." The New Order is the name
Indonesians give to the government established by Mr. Suharto
in 1966.</p>
<p>Pertamina already has delivered a letter of intent to a
consortium of Mitsui & Co. and Chiyoda Corp. of Japan and the
Thyssen unit that was to have a stake in the private project
to build the plant, for $700 million, in Sumatra. A
construction contract is expected to be signed before the end
of the year.</p>
<p>For bankers, the switch to state control of the aromatics
project is also a pragmatic one. A Jakarta-based Japanese
banker says there were "too many problems" in arranging
financing for a private aromatics venture, but with the
proposed plant now belonging to Pertamina, "there's no
problem."</p>
<p>Pertamina plans to obtain financing for the project on a
non-recourse basis, meaning the state oil company won't be
the borrower and the lenders won't have the right to seize
assets if loans aren't repaid. The borrower likely will be a
new offshore company that services project debt from cash
flow it receives through guaranteed long-term supplies of the
plant's output.</p>
<p>Even though Pertamina won't be directly liable for loans
related to the project, its ownership of the plant will
comfort bankers. Non-recourse financing will allow Pertamina
to build the plant without adding to the Indonesian
government's large foreign debt -- now more than $35 billion
-- while lenders will regard financing for the project as
being nearly as safe as a sovereign loan.</p>
<p>Hirotoshi Yokote, Mitsui's manager for development in
Jakarta, says the mechanism of the non-recourse financing for
the aromatics plant will be "quite complicated," but still
"workable."</p>
<p>In the early 1980s, Pertamina planned to build its own
aromatics plant. But in 1983, the project was shelved along
with other state projects because of financial difficulties.
Lacking funding, Pertamina later indicated that private
investors could undertake the investment.</p>
<p>In March 1988, Humpuss and Thyssen Rheinstahl Technik
G.m.b.H. won approval from Indonesia's investment board to
invest $916 million in an aromatics venture and Pertamina
agreed to supply the needed condensate.</p>
<p>Condensate is a byproduct of the natural gas exported from
Sumatra in liquefied form.</p>
<p>Under tentative plans, Humpuss was to hold 30%, and the
Thyssen unit was to hold 35%. They brought in Kellogg, with
another 35%, and there were plans for giving Pertamina a
nominal share. However, negotiations on the venture bogged
down earlier this year when Pertamina said it could guarantee
feedstock supplies of only about 40,000 barrels of condensate
a day, compared with the 90,000 barrels a day that Humpuss
and its partners were seeking.</p>
<p>The reduced supply meant the size of the project would
have to be scaled down drastically, making it difficult to
win financial support.</p>
<p>Thyssen Rheinstahl, the proposed main contractor, began
repackaging the plant to be owned by Pertamina and financed
through non-recourse loans. Japanese banks and trading
companies appeared hopeful of playing a role in exporting the
plant's output.</p>
<p>Plans to recast the project on a smaller scale eventually
jelled. The plant will use about 45,000 barrels a day of
condensate. Benzene production will be only 150,000 metric
tons a year, compared with plans by the private investors for
output of more than 300,000 tons. But production of
paraxylene, used to make synthetic fiber, will be 335,000
tons, compared with the previous plan of 197,000 tons.</p>
<p>If Pertamina runs short of condensate, which it exports,
it can use naphtha, a crude-oil derivative, as feedstock.
Pertamina controls naphtha supplies. "They assume that if
push comes to shove, Pertamina will make feedstock available
for its own project," says Mr. Hasan.</p>
<p>Claudio Clagluena, Thyssen's representative in Jakarta,
says the change to ownership by Pertamina "makes a lot of
sense." Some Jakarta oil industry executives are concerned
that the switch indicates that Pertamina opposes a private
role in upstream petrochemical production, but Mr. Clagluena
says he feels Pertamina is right to hold on to these
activities.</p>
<p>While it won't enter upstream production as hoped, Humpuss
still comes away with an expanded role in petrochemicals.
Four days after saying its consortium had received
Pertamina's order for construction of the aromatics plant,
Mitsui also announced Indonesian government approval of a
$200 million PTA venture near the site of the planned
aromatics plant at Arun. Humpuss will hold a 10% stake, and
Pertamina will hold 20%. Mitsui Petrochemical Industries Ltd.
will hold 50%, and Mitsui & Co. 20%.</p>
<p>Competition to sell PTA, unlike that for aromatics, could
be intense. At least four private joint ventures of
Indonesian and foreign concerns are considering PTA
production to provide fiber for the country's booming textile
and garment exports.</p>
<p>With domestic demand for petrochemical end-products rising
rapidly, several Indonesian groups, including those headed by
Mr. Suharto's sons, have formulated ambitious plans for
involvement in the industry. The two elder sons previously
benefited from a now-abolished monopoly that imported
petrochemical products for making plastics. After the
monopoly was ended in late 1988, industry analysts expected
the sons to move to establish a strong position in domestic
petrochemical production.</p>
<p>Despite world economic uncertainty caused by the Persian
Gulf crisis, the Indonesian petrochemical industry appears
poised for rapid expansion. Robert Kennedy, chairman of Union
Carbide Corp., told a Jakarta audience earlier this month
that Indonesia should be in the "logical forefront" of world
petrochemical industries for the next 50 years. He noted that
Indonesia has the advantage of oil and coal supplies to make
feedstock and a growing domestic market, and said the country
could become the hub of a regional petrochemicals market.</p>
