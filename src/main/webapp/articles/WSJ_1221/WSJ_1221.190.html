	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The New York-northeastern New Jersey area lost
some 100,000 private sector jobs in 1990, and the employment
outlook is expected to remain bleak in 1991, the U.S.
Department of Labor's Middle Atlantic Regional office said.
   Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of labor
statistics for the U.S. Department of Labor, said "1990 is
the year the slowdown turned into a substantial downturn." He
added, "We're not seeing any let up in 1991."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a year-end review of labor market conditions in the
23-county area, labor officials said that job losses in key
industries such as manufacturing, construction, finance and
insurance accelerated in 1990, with New York City,
particularly Manhattan, suffering the worst blows.</p>
<p>Once a major source of employment for the area,
manufacturing jobs are now quickly disappearing. Some 50,000
manufacturing jobs were cut in the first 10 months of this
year, a faster rate than the average decline of 30,000 a year
in the 1980s. Since 1979, the region has lost 360,000
manufacturing jobs.</p>
<p>The construction industry also took a serious hit as jobs
declined by 37,000 during the first 10 months of 1990, after
dropping by 8,000 in 1989 and 4,000 in 1988. The 50,000-plus
jobs lost in the last three years reversed a substantial rise
of 130,000 construction jobs from 1979 to 1987.</p>
<p>Mr. Ehrenhalt traced the beginning of the decline to the
October 1987 stock market crash. Since then, the financial
services industry has been forced to undergo a major
restructuring. According to the bureau of labor's statistics,
the securities industry declined by 10,000 jobs in 1990.
Since the peak in late 1987, Wall Street alone has lost some
29,000 jobs. That was after it added 93,000 jobs in the prior
10 years. Another 10,000 jobs were cut this year in banking
and nondeposit credit institutions.</p>
<p>While much of the job growth during the 1980s took place
in the service sector, the rate of growth of those jobs
slowed significantly in the past year, Mr. Ehrenhalt said.
Service jobs rose by 55,000 in 1990, but the increase falls
short of the 60,000 to 75,000 yearly gains posted during the
1980s.</p>
<p>Mr. Ehrenhalt noted, however, that the loss of jobs hasn't
resulted in significantly higher unemployment rates. The
region's unemployment rate averaged 5.3% in the first 10
months of this year, close to the national average of 5.4%.
In part, that's because there has been a reduction in the
growth of the labor force, or simply, there are fewer people
in the area looking for work. Mr. Ehrenhalt said another
factor might be that in difficult economic times, women and
other minorities are discouraged from applying for jobs.</p>
<p>For those who do work in the area, wages aren't rising as
fast as they used to. Payroll earnings in the region rose
3.4% in 1989, lower than the national increase of 5.7% and
far below the 9.3% rise the previous year.</p>
<p>While the report mostly contained dismal news on the job
situation, the one mildly bright spot was the slowing of
inflation. Consumer prices in the region rose 6.2% for the
10-month period ending in October, only slightly higher than
the 5.8% rate in 1989. A big jump in energy prices accounted
for most of the increases. Excluding energy, consumer prices
actually declined 0.3% to 5.4% this year, reflecting lower
housing costs.</p>
<p>Even so, the prospects for 1991 don't look good. Given the
weakness in the national economy and recently announced job
slashing at major New York banks, the region's job market
isn't likely to come back anytime soon. "The growth engines
have run out of steam," says Mr. Ehrenhalt. "This is going to
be a tough year for the regional economy."</p>
