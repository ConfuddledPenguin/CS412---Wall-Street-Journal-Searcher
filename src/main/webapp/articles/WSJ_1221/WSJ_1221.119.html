	<p class="article-leader">OMAHA, Neb. -- ConAgra Inc., its results swollen by its
recent $1.34 billion acquisition of Beatrice Co., reported a
38% jump in both earnings and sales for the second quarter
ended Nov. 25.
   The food concern said net income rose to $88.3 million, or
60 cents a share, from the year-earlier $63.9 million, or 52
cents a share. Sales climbed to $5.33 billion from $3.86
billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Per-share earnings reflect an increase in the number of
common and equivalent shares to 137 million from the year-ago
122.7 million. ConAgra, as part of the Beatrice acquisition,
issued seller Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. more than 11
million common shares, along with 142,000 shares of
convertible preferred.</p>
<p>In addition, per-share figures in the latest period also
reflect the payment of $6.1 million in preferred dividends:
such payments are deducted before per-share earnings are
calculated. In the year-ago quarter, ConAgra had only a
nominal $147,000 in preferred payments.</p>
<p>The company said its latest earnings were "highlighted by
good earnings balance, aggressive activity in new consumer
products and excellent progress bringing the Beatrice
businesses on board."</p>
<p>Beatrice earnings, only two weeks of which were included
in the fiscal first quarter results, "to date have been ahead
of plan," ConAgra said.</p>
