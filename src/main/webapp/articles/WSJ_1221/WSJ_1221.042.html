	<p class="article-leader">STOCKHOLM -- The Riksbank, Sweden's central bank, decided
to allow foreign banks with branches in Sweden to participate
in the Riksbank clearing and to make overnight borrowings in
the Riksbank according to the same rules that apply to
domestic banks.
   The decision means foreign bank branches can operate in
Sweden under the same conditions as Swedish banks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Participation in the Riksbank clearing and permission to
borrow from the Riksbank had been allowed only to Swedish
banking companies.</p>
<p>The decision further opens the Swedish banking system to
foreign banks. In August, foreign bank branches gained
permission to operate in Sweden. Before that, only
subsidiaries of foreign banks were permitted.</p>
