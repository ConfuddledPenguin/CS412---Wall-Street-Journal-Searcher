	<p class="article-leader">A Canadian Pacific Forest Products Ltd. official said
workers at its Gatineau, Quebec and Thunder Bay, Ontario,
newsprint mills ratified new contracts, ending lengthy
strikes.
   The CP Forest official said a tentative contract agreement
was reached at its Dalhousie, Nova Scotia, mill and workers
there will vote on the pact within the next few days. The
three CP Forest mills have a combined annual capacity of
about 1.3 million metric tons, or about 8% of North American
newsprint capacity. A metric ton equals about 2,204.6 pounds.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The CP Forest said the Gatineau and Thunder Bay mills,
both shut by strikes in September and October respectively,
will return to full operation by Jan. 2. CP Forest, Montreal,
a pulp and paper concern, is 80%-owned by Canadian Pacific
Ltd., a natural resources, transportation, communications and
real estate concern. Both companies are based here.</p>
