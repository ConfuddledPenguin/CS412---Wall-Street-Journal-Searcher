	<p class="article-leader">New Brunswick Electric Power Commission said it signed the
first long-term North American contract for Venezuelan liquid
bitumen, a low-cost fuel produced from the vast deposits of
tar sands in Venezuela's Orinoco Belt.
   New Brunswick Power, owned by New Brunswick province,
signed a multimillion-dollar contract with Bitor America
Corp., a unit of state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela, to
purchase as much as 16,000 barrels a day of liquid bitumen
for 20 years. The utility will use the fuel, which has the
trade name Orimulsion, as power-plant fuel.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>New Brunswick Power said it will spend 338 million
Canadian dollars (US$291.6 million) over the next four years
to convert a power plant to burn Orimulsion. It will install
a new smokestack scrubber to reduce emissions produced from
burning the bitumen, which has a high sulfur content.
Orimulsion is a mixture of water and extra-heavy bitumen, a
tarlike crude. Like conventional crude, Orimulsion can be
shipped by tanker or pipeline, but costs less than half the
price.</p>
