	<p class="article-leader">BETHPAGE, N.Y. -- The president of Grumman Corp.'s
military electronics group, Thomas A. Guarino, resigned amid
news reports of defense-procurement fraud allegedly involving
him, a now deceased Long Island businessman, and former
Grumman Chairman John O'Brien, who resigned in July.
   Mr. Guarino's resignation came one day after a Newsday
cover story titled "The Favored" detailed Messrs. Gaurino's
and O'Brien's alleged involvement with the late James T.
Kane, a Long Island businessman who helped run a
now-disgraced political lobbying group representing area
defense firms. Among other things, the article alleged that
Mr. Kane "showered gifts and favors worth hundreds of
thousands of dollars" on Messrs. Guarino and O'Brien while he
did business with Grumman.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Although I am innocent of any wrongdoing, suggestions
created by Newsday articles may undermine the confidence
people must feel in me as president of the systems group,"
Mr. Guarino, 52 years old, said in a company-issued
statement. "I reached this painful decision out of the
respect that I feel for the people of Grumman and others, in
government and industry, with whom I have worked. I have
always sought the constructive solution; in this case, I
believe that requires my resignation."</p>
<p>An attorney said to be representing Mr. O'Brien declined
to comment.</p>
<p>Grumman systems group, established in April, 1989,
comprises the electronics systems division in Great River,
N.Y, Melbourne systems in Melbourne, Fla., and space systems
in Bethpage. Presidents of those divisions will now report to
Grumman Chairman and Chief Executive Renso L.Caporali, who
succeeded Mr. O'Brien in July.</p>
<p>Mr. Guarino's stated reason for resigning was in contrast
to that of Mr. O'Brien's, who said only that he was leaving
for personal reasons. As previously reported, before his
resignation, Mr. O'Brien became embroiled in the federal
criminal investigation of Pentagon procurement fraud and
corruption involving Long Island companies, as investigators
stepped up their interest in his ties to Mr. Kane, who died
in February. Federal investigators are trying to determine
whether Grumman officials or their families received loans or
other benefits from Mr. Kane or his firms, according to law
enforcement officials.</p>
<p>In May, a former shipping manager at Grumman's aerospace
unit pleaded guilty to charges of conspiring to defraud the
government by submitting to the Pentagon $300,000 of bogus
bills submitted by a subcontractor controlled by Mr. Kane.
The former Grumman manager is cooperating with prosecutors.</p>
