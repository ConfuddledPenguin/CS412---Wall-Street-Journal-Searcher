	<p class="article-leader">Metropolitan Circuits Inc., a Santa Ana, Calif., maker of
printed circuit boards, said it filed for protection from its
creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
   Last month, the company's sole operating unit,
Metropolitan Circuits of California, sought bankruptcy-law
protection. Both petitions were filed in bankruptcy court in
Santa Ana. In recent months, the companies have tried to
raise new capital to pay their debts, among other things. The
unit's filing was made to block a court order obtained by its
largest creditor, General Electric Co., that would have let
GE seize some of the unit's assets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In its filing, the parent company said it has assets of
$1.5 million and liabilities of $3.8 million. Last month, the
unit received preliminary approval from the court to use its
cash for operations; a final hearing on that issue is
scheduled for today.</p>
<p>The parent company filing "is one more step in our ongoing
efforts to realign our business operations for the continued
benefit of our customers, suppliers, employees and
creditors," said Richard J. Sandberg, chief executive
officer.</p>
