	<p class="article-leader">LONDON (AP) -- Angola, a major diamond producing nation,
is re-entering the De Beers Centenary AG diamond powerhouse,
ending a five-year absence, De Beers said.
   Endiama, the Angolan state diamond company, and De Beers
agreed to re-establish their relationship, De Beers said.
Angola has been marketing its diamonds independently since
1985, after civil war prompted De Beers to pull out, a De
Beers spokesman said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the agreement, De Beer's London-based Central
Selling Organization will market Angola's diamonds from its
Cuango region, or about three-quarters of the country's
annual production of one million carats, the De Beers
spokesman said.</p>
<p>De Beers also will provide Endiama with a $50 million loan
to increase production in the Cuango area, and an additional
$50 million over the next five years to develop other diamond
sources in Angola.</p>
<p>About 80% of the world's annual diamond production is
sorted and sold by De Beers's Central Selling Organization,
which had diamond sales of $4.1 billion in 1989.</p>
