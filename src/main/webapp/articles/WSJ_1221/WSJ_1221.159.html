	<p class="article-leader">Asea Brown Boveri Inc. said a unit revised its agreement
to sell its Georgia Kaolin business to ECC Group PLC, after
discussions with the U.S. Justice Department.
   The Justice Department had been reviewing the agreement in
light of antitrust regulations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The revised agreement calls for the ABB unit to sell the
major part of the Georgia Kaolin business to ECC for about
$340 million, with ABB retaining one facility known as Dry
Branch. The Dry Branch facility will have a capacity to
produce 800,000 tons of kaolin a year. Its 1991 revenue is
estimated at about $80 million; ABB said profitability is
expected to increase when the plant is operated as an
independent unit. Kaolin is used as a coating and filler in
producing high quality paper.</p>
<p>As reported, the initial purchase price last May was about
$520 million for the entire Georgia Kaolin business. ABB
acquired the Georgia Kaolin business when it acquired
Combustion Engineering Inc. about one year ago. Georgia
Kaolin had 1989 revenue of $170 million.</p>
<p>Asea Brown Boveri, Stamford, Conn., is part of ABB Group,
Zurich, the world's largest electrical engineering concern
with annual sales of about $25 billion. Asea Brown Boveri's
products and services include those for the power, process,
industrial automation and environmental control markets. It
has about $6 billion in sales in the U.S.</p>
<p>ECC Group, Cornwall, England, is a producer of white
pigments with annual sales of about $1.6 billion.</p>
