	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Consumer spending barely climbed in November
as personal incomes increased only slightly, suggesting that
consumers have hunkered down and won't contribute to economic
strength in the next few months.
   The Commerce Department reported that consumer spending
increased only 0.1% in November to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of $3.727 trillion, after remaining flat in
October. Personal income rose a scant 0.3% last month, to a
rate of $4.711 trillion, also after no gain in October. The
department said that almost all of the November increase in
personal income came from higher federal subsidy payments to
farmers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We are seeing a real retrenchment of the consumer," said
John Silvia, an economist with Kemper Financial Services in
Chicago. Many economists have pointed in recent weeks to
growing consumer fears about the economy as a key factor in
the slowdown in consumer spending. But the report for
November suggested that laggard growth in incomes also is
holding back spending.</p>
<p>Even more striking, consumer spending after adjustment for
inflation fell 0.2% in November after dropping 0.8% in
October. Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of
gross national product -- the nation's output of goods and
services. The recent declines in spending could subtract more
than two percentage points from the inflation-adjusted GNP
growth rate in the fourth quarter, said Michael Penzer, an
economist for San Francisco-based Bank of America.</p>
<p>The vast majority of economists agree that GNP likely will
shrink in the fourth quarter; estimates of the contraction
range from about 1% to 4% at an annual rate.</p>
<p>Moreover, the report suggested spending probably won't
climb for at least a few months because real disposable
income -- after-tax income adjusted for inflation -- has
stagnated. This measure of income was flat in November,
following decreases of 0.8% in October and 0.3% in September.
So far, disposable income is falling at a 4.6% annual rate in
the fourth quarter, Mr. Penzer said.</p>
<p>"There just isn't the income there to support spending,"
he said. "Real disposable income is falling off a cliff. It's
likely to hit first-quarter spending as well."</p>
<p>The savings rate -- savings as a ratio of disposable
personal income -- totaled 4% in November, compared with 3.7%
in October and 3.8% in September. The rate is still at
relatively low levels compared with the last decade. In the
early years of the 1980s, it hovered around 7%. Last year,
the savings rate was 4.6%.</p>
<p>Consumer spending on durable goods -- goods intended to
last more than three years -- fell 1.9% after a 2.6% drop in
October. Spending on nondurables was up 0.5% in November,
following a 0.2% rise the previous month. Spending on
services increased 0.3% after a 0.5% gain.</p>
<p>Wage and salary income decreased a slight 0.1% in November
to a $2.728 trillion annual rate. Manufacturing wages fell
1.7% to a $540.3 billion rate, and wages in
commodity-producing industries dropped 1.5% to a $719.6
billion rate.</p>
<p>Here is the Commerce Department's latest report on
personal income. The figures are at seasonally adjusted
annual rates in trillions of dollars.</p>
