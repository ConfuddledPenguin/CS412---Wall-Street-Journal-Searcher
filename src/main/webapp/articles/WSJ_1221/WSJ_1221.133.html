	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. said the cost of
inspecting and replacing underground fuel storage tanks to
meet federal environmental guidelines will total $71 million,
far higher than an earlier estimate of $12 million.
   The company, a major Coca-Cola bottler that is 49%-owned
by Coca-Cola Co., made the disclosure yesterday in
conjunction with a new common-share buy-back program,
covering as many as 15 million shares.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Coca-Cola Enterprises said the $71 million cost to replace
tanks and clean up the surroundings will be spread out
between 1990 and 1993. It said an earlier $12 million
estimate, covering only 1990 and 1991, was made in its annual
report in March, before the company had completed soil
testing and tank extraction.</p>
<p>The bottler has a large number of underground tanks around
the nation at various distribution centers for storing
gasoline and diesel fuel for its truck fleet. Under a 1988
federal law, companies with underground fuel storage tanks
must inspect them, replace them as needed, and clean up
leakage.</p>
<p>Margaret Carton, a spokeswoman, declined to say how many
tanks the company has, how many have been or will be
replaced, or how many were discovered to be leaking fuel.
However, she said all those that had been leaking fuel have
already been replaced and the company is "completely in
compliance with all federal, state and local laws." Company
spokesmen said the concern had discovered some soil and water
contamination, but didn't know the extent.</p>
<p>Separately, the company said it will buy back shares with
funds from excess cash flow. The period of time for the
buy-back wasn't specified.</p>
