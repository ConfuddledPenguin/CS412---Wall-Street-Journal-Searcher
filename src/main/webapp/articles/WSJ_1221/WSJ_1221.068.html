	<p class="article-leader">BankAmerica Corp. is preparing for a holiday feast
featuring some of the biggest turkeys in the savings and loan
industry.
   The resurgent banking company, which all year has been
gobbling up small banks and defunct thrifts, now is shopping
around in Texas and New Mexico as well as its home turf of
California, senior BankAmerica executives say.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The current offerings on the menu consist of the
Resolution Trust Corp.'s list of failed thrifts. Among the
candidates being eyed by BankAmerica officials are such
thrift disasters as Charles Keating's Lincoln Savings & Loan
Association in Irvine, Calif.; Dallas-based Southwest Savings
Association, which failed twice, and New Mexico's biggest
dud, ABQ Bank. Some officials say BankAmerica may strike a
deal in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>BankAmerica's moves into Texas and New Mexico would be its
first major thrusts into those states. Together with its
continued search for California institutions, the actions
signal a marked escalation of BankAmerica's expansionist
policy. They also indicate that BankAmerica isn't very
worried about possible losses on its California construction
loans, an exposure that troubles some bank analysts.</p>
<p>BankAmerica already has shown it is willing to outspend
its rivals to buy out-of-state market share. It paid rich
premiums -- some say too rich -- in outgunning competitors
such as Wells Fargo & Co. and Security Pacific Corp. in
recent bidding over the remains of failed thrifts in
Washington and Arizona. Just last week, it bought a failed
thrift in Nevada.</p>
<p>"We see an opportunity, and we are seizing it," says Frank
Newman, BankAmerica's chief financial officer. Adds another
BankAmerica senior officer: "Just take the RTC list, and
circle every one in the West or Southwest, and the odds are
probably three-to-one that BankAmerica has a bid in on it."</p>
<p>Driving BankAmerica's binge is chief executive officer
Richard Rosenberg's belief that the failed thrifts present
BankAmerica with a chance to dominate the West, something it
lost during the mid-1980s, when BankAmerica's own problems
forced it to shrink significantly to survive. Between 1985
and 1987, BankAmerica had losses of $1.8 billion, and its
regional ambitions stalled. For instance, it was pressured by
regulators to abandon an agreement to buy an Oregon bank.</p>
<p>But Mr. Rosenberg, who as head of the bank's retail
operations was instrumental in restoring the bank to
profitability before becoming chief executive in April, sees
an aggressive acquisition campaign as pivotal to his plan to
make BankAmerica the West's retail banking powerhouse.</p>
<p>"The goal is to extend our reach throughout the West,"
says Mr. Newman. "We want to be pre-eminent."</p>
<p>Some bankers see risk in BankAmerica's approach. For one
thing, many of the areas into which BankAmerica is moving --
Arizona, for example -- still are economically weak. And
Nevada, though among the fastest-growing states, has the kind
of one-horse economy that makes some bankers nervous.</p>
<p>"If the casino and tourist trade fades there, poof, there
goes Nevada's economy," says one West Coast banker.</p>
<p>Rivals such as First Interstate and Security Pacific
already have bought the banks with number one or number two
market share in one or two states. Others have such low
populations that market share might not mean much. Mr.
Rosenberg himself once professed little interest in
low-population states such as Oregon, noting that the average
increase in California's population every two years equaled
Oregon's entire population.</p>
<p>Moreover, some industry executives believe BankAmerica is
paying too much for its acquisitions. Robert H. Smith,
Security Pacific's chief executive, has said it doesn't make
economic sense to pay more than 4% of the total deposits
purchased when buying failed thrifts. BankAmerica paid a
so-called deposit premium of 4.3%, or $81 million, to buy the
remains of Phoenix-based Merabank. Its premium on its $162.3
million acquisition of Benjamin Franklin Federal Savings &
Loan Association, Portland, Ore., amounted to 6.85% of that
institution's core deposits. People familiar with the bidding
for Benjamin Franklin say BankAmerica's offer topped Security
Pacific's by $50 million.</p>
<p>BankAmerica's Mr. Newman dismisses such criticism. "We've
lost the bidding on some institutions, so some people might
say we underpaid in those cases," he says. "We analyzed the
expected profit stream very carefully, and our capital
strength and financial position puts us in position to do
these deals."</p>
<p>Indeed, BankAmerica has built its tangible common equity
ratio to 4.67% of assets, the second-highest capital ratio
among the nation's ten largest banks. Its profits remain
robust. For the nine months, it earned $828 million, or $3.66
a share.</p>
<p>Beyond that, BankAmerica's cash outlays in these
acquisitions are tiny compared to its $109 billion of assets.
And Mr. Newman notes that its risks are reduced by retaining
few if any of the failed thrift's problem assets. The
government retains most such assets in these deals.</p>
<p>BankAmerica's current prospects, bank executives say,
include New Mexico's largest defunct thrifts, ABQ Bank and
Sandia Federal Savings Association. Both are based in
Albuquerque. ABQ has $970 million of deposits; Sandia has
$950 million of deposits. Investment bankers expect bids for
the two institutions to come in at about $40 million for
each.</p>
<p>In Texas, BankAmerica is believed to be eyeing Southwest,
notorious in thrift lore for being bailed out twice because
regulators' first effort to fix it didn't hold. It has $3.9
billion of deposits.</p>
<p>Among other potential Texas targets:</p>
<p>Commonwealth Federal Savings Association of Houston, which
has $1.71 billion of deposits; and Benjamin Franklin FSA of
Houston, which has $1.66 billion of deposits. The bidding in
Texas is expected to be spirited because of the state's size
and its slow but apparently steady rebound from the statewide
depression triggered by the collapse of oil prices beginning
in 1985. BankAmerica executives say it is also looking to
shore up its California base by mulling bids on what's left
of Lincoln, and Imperial Federal Savings Association, San
Diego, another spectacular California thrift failure. Lincoln
has deposits of about $2.4 billion and Imperial has deposits
of $4.8 billion.</p>
