	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- A condominium developer and real estate salesman
were arrested yesterday and charged by federal prosecutors
with bank fraud involving more than $11 million of
condominium loans.
   The 31-count indictment charged that William W. Lilly, 45
years old, a Lynnfield, Mass., developer, and one of his
sales managers, Donald Glusgol, 62, of Peabody, Mass.,
offered falsified condominium mortgages as collateral for
obtaining $7 million in loans from First Mutual Bank for
Savings, a troubled Boston savings bank.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>First Mutual eventually sold the loans for $9 million to
Royal Palm Savings Association, a West Palm Beach, Fla.,
savings and loan that became insolvent and was placed in
conservatorship in April 1989.</p>
<p>Messrs. Lilly and Glusgol couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
