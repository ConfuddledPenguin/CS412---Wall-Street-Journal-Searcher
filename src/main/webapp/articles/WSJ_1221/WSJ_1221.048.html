	<p class="article-leader">BONN -- A German court ruled Thursday that an
anti-takeover clause Continental AG adopted in 1989 is
invalid.
   Continental, a German tire maker, is the target of a
takeover attempt by the Italian tire maker Pirelli S.p.A.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The district court in Hanover didn't explain its decision.
It ruled on the matter after a Continental stockholder filed
a complaint against the Hanover-based company. Continental
has rejected the financial terms of Pirelli's offer, but it
insists it still is willing to talk to the Italian company
about a merger. Under the 1989 decision reached at the
company's annual meeting, the limit on voting rights can be
changed only with the support of holders of 75% of company
shares. It had required only a simple majority.</p>
<p>Many German companies have clauses that limit
stockholders' voting stakes to 5% even if their holdings are
larger. The measure makes it difficult for potential buyers
to take over a company, an obstacle that is heightened by the
need to get 75% of the votes to change the rules.</p>
