	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The White House budget office wants to pare
Medicare spending next fiscal year by nearly $3 billion
beyond the cuts stipulated in this fall's deficit-reduction
accord with Congress.
   The additional cuts would result from reducing
reimbursements to hospitals and physicians, not from making
beneficiaries pay more, according to Bush administration
officials and documents describing the budget office's
recommendations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Medicare changes are among those being considered as
the administration drafts its fiscal 1992 budget proposal, to
be released in February. Senior administration officials said
that President Bush appears unlikely to push a major package
of tax cuts and reductions in government benefits programs,
but that he still could decide to do so.</p>
<p>For fiscal 1992 through 1995, the remaining four years of
the five-year deficit-cutting accord, the administration
plans to seek about $14.1 billion in Medicare cuts beyond the
$39 billion agreed to for those years in the budget
legislation. Medicare spending amounts to nearly $100 billion
a year.</p>
<p>No major changes in Medicare are included in the
recommendations presented by the budget office this week to
the Health and Human Services Department. The administration
plans only minor changes in the Medicaid health-insurance
program, which serves the poor and was expanded significantly
by Congress earlier this year.</p>
<p>The budget office decisions aren't final. HHS officials
said they expect to appeal some parts of the proposed budget
for their agency, but declined to say if they will contest
the Medicare change.</p>
<p>The $3 billion in Medicare savings could be used to
finance increases in other government benefits or tax cuts --
or could simply be used to reduce the deficit. The budget
documents don't say, and administration officials said a
final decision hasn't been made.</p>
<p>For fiscal 1992, which begins next Oct. 1, the budget
office wants to slice Medicare spending by an additional $2.7
billion beyond the $5.8 billion required by the
deficit-reduction accord. The proposed cuts include reducing
the rate of subsidies to large research hospitals. Most of
the new proposals were brought up in this year's budget
negotiations.</p>
<p>The budget office also is seeking to trim payments to
doctors by $250 million in fiscal 1992 and $2.7 billion over
five years, and plans to offer Congress a list of suggested
ways to meet the goal, a summary of the budget office
recommendation indicates.</p>
<p>The new budget proposals call for no further cuts in
Medicare reimbursements to hospitals for construction or
equipment purchases.</p>
<p>To improve enforcement of laws requiring private insurers
and employers to cover certain expenses of Medicare
beneficiaries, the budget office suggested setting up a
clearing house with a $5 million budget to gather information
on employer-provided or other outside health-insurance
coverage. It recommended adding a line to W-2 forms -- which
employers provide to the Internal Revenue Service for each
employee -- to disclose if employees have insurance coverage.</p>
<p>One of the most controversial parts of the nearly $500
billion deficit-cutting plan was the provision slicing more
than $42 billion from Medicare, the federal government's
insurance program for the elderly and disabled, from fiscal
1991 through fiscal 1995. To achieve the savings, the
administration and Congress hit beneficiaries by raising
premiums and increasing the deductible. They also cut
reimbursements to doctors, hospitals and other health-care
providers.</p>
<p>The summary of the budget office recommendations also
details an explosion in costs of the Medicaid program, which
is administered by the states. In the past four months, the
estimated cost of Medicaid for fiscal 1992 has grown by $3.2
billion, to $57.2 billion. The budget office recommended
improvements in state Medicaid reporting and estimating
practices.</p>
