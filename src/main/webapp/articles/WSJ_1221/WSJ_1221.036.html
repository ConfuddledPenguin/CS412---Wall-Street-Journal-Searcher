	<p class="article-leader">SYDNEY -- Nervous investors sent News Corp. shares
plunging 20% as rumors swirled that the flagship of media
mogul Rupert Murdoch is heading for trouble.
   The shares closed at 4.35 Australian dollars, or US$3.36,
apiece on the Australian Stock Exchange, down A$1.09 from
Wednesday's close, prompting a query from the exchange.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Murdoch, who controls about 45% of the company and is
chief executive, told officials that News Corp. "knows of no
reason for the recent variation" in the price, and he tried
to scotch fears about the progress of the proposed
rescheduling of most of the company's A$10.53 billion
(US$8.13 billion) bank debt.</p>
<p>In a statement, Mr. Murdoch said that News Corp. is "very
pleased" with its bank negotiations and that "a large
majority of banks" in the group "have already indicated
agreement to the terms." News Corp. originally was aiming to
pin the bank rescheduling down by mid-December, but the
company has since indicated that the debt negotiations are
likely to drag into January.</p>
<p>The rumors -- some of them probably fanned by short
sellers, investors who bet that News Corp.'s stock price will
drop -- included talk that the company would be hit with a
tax bill of A$1 billion by the Australian government.</p>
