	<p class="article-leader">From Dec. 4 remarks to the Australian Parliament by Prime
Minister Bob Hawke defending Australia's decision to send
ships to join the international fleet in the Persian Gulf:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>I know there will be some who will ask why we should
contribute in the Gulf when others do not. The essential
answer is this -- that what others do or don't do does not
obviate our responsibility to judge for ourselves what is
right, and what is in our interests, and to act accordingly.
We also need to recognize that not only should we contribute,
but unlike many others, we can contribute -- we have a
relevant capability to contribute.</p>
<p>I know there will be some who will cavil at the leading
role being played in the Gulf by the United States. They will
suspect that other nations who participate will only be
serving American interests. That view is profoundly mistaken.</p>
<p>The U.S. is certainly playing a leading role, as we would
expect from a nation as wealthy and powerful as the U.S.
Indeed, we would be disappointed if the U.S. did not. . . .
But the U.S. role has been clearly at one in this case with
the wider interests of the international community, as
demonstrated by the support for Resolution 678 in the
Security Council.</p>
<p>There are even those who have purported to base their
assessment of the Gulf situation on the presumption of moral
equivalence between the U.S. and Iraqi positions. . . . Let
there be no ambiguity here -- no "mindless muddying" of the
waters. If it comes to conflict, the international community
will not be the aggressor. The United States and the other
allies will not be the aggressor. The aggressor is the nation
that took, occupied and annexed Kuwait in August.</p>
