	<p class="article-leader">STOCKHOLM -- SKF AB, the Swedish rolling bearing group,
said it doesn't anticipate any profit for the last quarter of
1990, following a decline in industrial production and
weakened sales.
   A statement from the group said the "fourth quarter is not
expected to contribute to the group's income for 1990." The
company said adverse market conditions had prompted the
company to substantially reduce production in order to adjust
to the lower level of demand.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At the nine-month interim period, the company reported
earnings after financial items of 1.78 billion kronor ($318.7
million), which, following the group's announcement, is
probably what the group expects full-year results to be. The
figure represents a 31% drop from 1989, when the group's
profit after financial items was 2.59 billion kronor.</p>
