	<div class="article-body"><p>AT 38, FLORIST JAMES McCANN has come full circle in the
world of social service. Armed with a psychology degree from
New York's City College, he began as a full-time counselor in
a home for boys, switched into the flower business ("to feed
the family") and now has taken on the additional job of
raising funds for a home for retarded adults.</p>
<p>A native of New York's Queens County, Mr. McCann's public
service started at St. John's Home for Boys in Rockaway
Beach. In 1976, with a new family to support (he now has
three children), he looked for a business he could handle. "I
come from an entrepreneurial family," he says. He hit upon
flowers because he could start out part time and with a
minimum of capital. "There were no majors in the flower
business," he says, "like McDonald's in hamburgers."</p>
<p>Starting with one shop in Manhattan, he built what is now
the 12-store Flora Plenty chain, with annual volume of $10
million. In 1986, he bought control of a then-money-losing
flowers-by-phone company whose major asset was an 800
telephone number that spelled f-l-o-w-e-r-s. Grafting that
onto his Northeastern retail chain, he added $20 million a
year in volume.</p>
<p>Mr. McCann, however, had never lost his interest in social
service. He still sits on the board of two homes for
children, his original St. John's, and St. Joseph's, a home
for girls run by the Josephite Sisters, as well as on the
board of the Brooklyn Catholic Child Care Society. In 1987,
he took on still another pro bono chore, helping the New Hope
Community, a center for retarded adults located in the
Catskills. Here he had a personal motive; his retarded
brother was in New Hope.</p>
<p>This nonprofit, nonsectarian Catskill community for the
retarded sits in the heart of the borsch circuit. When Mr.
McCann became interested in it, he brought not only his
entrepreneurial and fund-raising skills but ideas he had
acquired while working with the Marianist Brothers in
Rockaway. Like most such institutions, St. John's at first
had housed its boys in dormitories. Most of its residents,
however, had grown up in apartments; the communal dorm life
became an extra psychological problem. To overcome that, the
Marianists decided to create a campus atmosphere, with a
dozen apartments, with each bedroom housing two boys. That
way, nursing, schooling and other services could be provided
in separate quarters. New Hope is organized along similar
lines, with 10 group homes.</p>
<p>The campus milieu, Mr. McCann says, works as well for the
adults in New Hope as it did for the boys in Rockaway. All
the guests are mentally retarded, but Mr. McCann notes that
this is not their only handicap. Some are blind, some in
wheelchairs. The separate homes can offer facilities and aid
tailored to the needs of each group.</p>
<p>Since he joined the New Hope operation, which takes a day
or more out of each working week, Mr. McCann's fund-raising
committee has raised $400,000 toward its $750,000 goal. His
target for 1990 is $100,000, and he has about $40,000 of that
in hand. Additional funds to complete the Catskill "campus"
will come from bonds issued by New York state's Office of
Mental Retardation, money that Mr. McCann says will
eventually be repaid out of New Hope's operating income.</p>
<p>Mr. McCann sees nothing remarkable in all this. "I think
that your life, like diet or exercise, should be kept in
balance. My balance is my family, my business, and this
work." His interest in New Hope, understandably, was sparked
by his brother, who he says was the catalyst for his original
choice of social service as a career. "It's simple," he says,
"I want to be involved."</p>
