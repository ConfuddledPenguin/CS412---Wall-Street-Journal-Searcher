	<p class="article-leader">For anyone who both holds a full-time job and has tried to
complete Super Mario Bros. on a Nintendo videogame system,
this news is what you've been waiting for. A Nintendo
spokesman says that a new device called Game Genie, made by a
competitor, supercharges its games so that characters can
suddenly leap higher, run faster and kill more enemies.
Instead of cheering this victory of man over machine,
Nintendo has sued the maker of Game Genie. Nintendo fears
people will become bored if its games are too easy to play.
Not to worry. Players might use the device once (is it really
true that when Mario rescues the Princess there are several
minutes of credits and nifty music?) but the fun will always
be in the challenge.</p>
