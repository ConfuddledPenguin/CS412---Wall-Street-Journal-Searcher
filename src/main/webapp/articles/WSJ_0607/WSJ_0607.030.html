	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Voters here adopted an ethics package that
requires increased financial disclosures by city officials,
bans outside employment by officials, and requires partial
public financing of campaigns. But it also gives substantial
pay raises to several top officials.
   The ballot measure, affirmed by 57% of the voters, emerged
as a result of controversy last year over Mayor Tom Bradley's
outside financial dealings. At the time, Mr. Bradley
appointed a commission to draft a new city code of ethics.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The ethics package adopted by voters was a combination of
that commission's proposal and separate proposals made by
City Council members. The proposals were the subject of
heated debate, and council members tacked on numerous
amendments, including the pay boosts. The measure increases
pay of the 15 council members 40% to $86,157, and the mayor's
pay 9.2% to $112,004.</p>
<p>Geoffrey Cowan, the public-interest attorney who headed
the outside commission to draft the new code, called the
ballot measure "the most comprehensive package of ethics and
finance reform in the country."</p>
