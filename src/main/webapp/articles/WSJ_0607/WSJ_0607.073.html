	<p class="article-leader">Until we found a Thomas & Thomas catalog in our mailbox
the other day, we hurt a little inside every time we got free
catalogs from mail-order outfits.
   For years it's been painfully obvious that these catalog
companies had our mail-order persona all wrong. They seemed
to think of us as nothing more than a plaid-shirted crappie
fisherman who made his own compost, liked loon T-shirts and
penguin shower curtains.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But when our Thomas & Thomas catalog turned up, we felt
redeemed enough to suppress the suspicion that somebody
muffed their mailing list. This couldn't be a mistake. Thomas
& Thomas is a small, 21-year-old company in Turners Falls,
Mass., that sells fishing tackle. Sort of. Actually it sells
fishing stuff to the SERIOUS FISHING EQUIPMENT INVESTOR. It
isn't for the carp and sucker fishing crowd, the bullhead and
bluegill gravel-pit boys, or even for the pros out on the
Masters Walleye Circuit ($300,000 in prize money and a berth
in the Sept. 13-15 World Walleye Championship in Dubuque).
Even if you're a monster Muskie man, T&T isn't for you.</p>
<p>No night crawlers, bobbers or Uncle Josh pork rinds in
this catalog. It is 71 pages long and there isn't a single
tackle box in it. No Pikie Minnows, Berkley Power Grubs,
Jitterbugs or Dardevles either. We couldn't even find the
Sputterfrog Buzzbait and the Pee Wee Wart, two of the 10
hottest new lures in fishing, according to Gerald Almy,
Sports Afield magazine's lures & flies columnist.</p>
<p>Not that we want a Pee Wee Wart. Back in our semi-pro
fishing days, there weren't any Pee Wee Warts. We lived
within BB-gun range of the Shiawassee River up in Michigan,
and when we came to the realization one day that shooting out
street lights was both dicey and driving up the cost of BIG
GOVERNMENT, we turned our attention to small-mouth bass and
trash fish.</p>
<p>Naturally, we tried to limit our time doing this to normal
school hours. Actually, we probably spent more time wading
around the mighty Shiawassee looking for artificial baits
that beer-drinking grownup fishermen lost on snags, a pursuit
that got much more lucrative after we learned to pre-position
and stake down old rope under the water exactly where we
figured the grownups would cast their lures. Soon our tackle
boxes bulged with spoons and flatfish, Lazy Ikes and River
Runts.</p>
<p>Those, of course, were the days when fish had a chance.
Today's so-called fisherman has depth-sounding sonars such as
the Eagle Ultra, with its "Advanced Fish I.D. System" and a
128-pixel picture with split-screen zoom that not only spots
fish but gives their size, species, range and any special
dietary requirements.</p>
<p>We had to turn over rocks in the Shiawassee to get our
hellgrammites, the carnivorous, dark-brown aquatic larvae of
the dobsonfly, so tempting to small-mouths. Now, through
Cabela's, in Sidney, Neb., you can get 2,500 Class Maggies --
real live blue fly larvae, imported from England and dyed
special colors in a "secret process" -- for $29.95.</p>
<p>Insider information may be a no-no on Wall Street, but in
walleye country they publish an entire Walleye In-Sider
newspaper that one fishing magazine says "is like riding in
the boat with the pros]" And if that doesn't make the fish
just give up and jump into your boat, there's every sort of
plastic worm and spinner and jig, and even the "Fish Laser
Flasher," a silver spoon that has a holographic picture of a
school of actual baitfish on its side.</p>
<p>Thomas & Thomas doesn't sell this stuff. T&T sells bamboo
fly rods that cost as much as my folks paid for our farm.
Sure, that was a few decades back and it was a modest farm --
60 acres, house, chicken coop, outdoor plumbing -- but $2,000
seems a bit steep for a fishing pole you'd actually want to
fish with.</p>
<p>"That's just it," explained Len Codella, one of T&T's
managing directors. "Many of our limited-edition rods are
never used to fish because they border on works of art. If
you spend $3,000 for a rod, you're probably a collector. But
our $1,600 rod, it's bought to fish."</p>
<p>T&T turned out its first limited edition on its 10th
anniversary, in 1979. Ten rods were made, and sold out in
three days for $850 apiece. Current market value: $5,200. Six
other limited-edition rods and one reel have been offered to
the public. A complete set of seven rods and one reel was
sold at auction recently for $33,000.</p>
<p>"There are probably 60 million license-buying fishermen
out there and probably no more than 150,000 SERIOUS fly
fishermen -- and that's our market, guys for whom fly fishing
is a lifestyle," Mr. Codella explained.</p>
<p>They buy more than $1 million of T&T gear annually. Said
Mr. Codella: "We sell everything we can build. We are capable
of building 150 to 175 rods a year. At one point, there was a
one-year wait for a rod. Now it's down to three or four
months."</p>
<p>The Tonkin Cane they use is a very special bamboo from
Guangxi Province in China that takes a T&T craftsman a good
45 hours to turn into a fly rod. The bamboo is split into six
strips, milled to a tolerance of less than a thousandth of an
inch, laminated under pressure into a single hexagon onto
which nickel-silver assembly ferrules, a Portuguese ring cork
grip and a handcarved wood and nickel-silver reel seat are
mounted and guides are hand-wrapped with thread; varnish is
applied and rubbed -- two to four coats.</p>
<p>"Bamboo is fascinating material; it gets people fired up,"
Mr. Codella told us. "There's some magic in bamboo, and great
bamboo rods are kind of like a Strad."</p>
<p>Ronald Reagan got fired up enough to give a matched set of
T&T salmon rods to Prince Charles and Lady Diana, and another
rod to Malcolm Fraser when he was Australia's prime minister.
Eric Clapton, the rock 'n' roller, owns some. So does William
"Jake and the Fatman" Conrad.</p>
<p>We thought Orvis, which sends out about 25 million
catalogs and sells $80 million in stuff annually (more
clothes than fishing gear), bordered on the hoity-toity until
we met T&T. "When guys get tired and bored with Orvis, they
find T&T," Mr. Codella says.</p>
<p>Even the cover of the Thomas & Thomas catalog (100,000
copies go out annually) is for the SERIOUS FISHING EQUIPMENT
INVESTOR. It depicts a painting of a brown trout by Dutch
artist Adrian Swier, a limited 500-copy signed edition of
which can be had for $65.</p>
<p>We think we'll pass. Our eye is on the new Chartreuse
Flake Mister Twister Poc'It Hawger, which the Cabela's folks
say is just the thing for "negative mood bass." Only $1.99.</p>
