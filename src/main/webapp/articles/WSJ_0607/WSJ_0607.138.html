	<p class="article-leader">ETHNIC VIOLENCE SPREAD in a Soviet republic in Central
Asia.
   With authorities in the republic of Kirghizia reportedly
helpless against rioters and gangs of marauding youths, the
official Tass news agency said at least 35 people have been
killed and about 300 injured in clashes between ethnic Uzbeks
and Kirghiz. The unrest, triggered Monday by a land dispute,
was the latest in a series of violent outbreaks challenging
Gorbachev. In Scotland, a U.S. official said Moscow had
assured Secretary of State Baker that it won't impede the
emigration of Soviet Jews despite a threat made by Gorbachev
last week.</p>

military future. The plan was viewed as having the potential
to break an East-West impasse.</p>

<p>Liberia's President Doe has asked the U.S. to help him
flee his country, a Bush administration official said as
Washington reportedly was arranging an airlift to evacuate
Americans from the West African nation. Near Monrovia,
loyalist troops killed the U.S.-trained commander of rebels
who have been advancing on the capital.</p>

<p>South Africa's de Klerk sought cabinet approval to lift
four years of emergency rule, according to government sources
in Cape Town. An end to the country's state of emergency,
which expires tomorrow, is one of the main conditions set by
Mandela and the African National Congress for formal talks on
a black-white political settlement.</p>

<p>China freed 97 people jailed for their part in last year's
pro-democracy demonstrations, bringing to 881 the number of
protesters freed in the past six months. Officials announced
the amnesty after this week's anniversary of the government's
crackdown in Tiananmen Square.</p>

<p>Czechoslovakia detained former Communist Party leader
Milos Jakes, ex-official Vasil Bilak and at least five others
to "clarify their activities" during the 1968 Warsaw Pact
invasion of the nation. The action came ahead of tomorrow's
first free elections since 1946.</p>

<p>A court in West Germany sentenced a retired U.S. Army
sergeant to life in prison for selling classified military
information to Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Clyde Lee Conrad,
43, who settled in Kaiserslautern as a civilian, also was
fined $1.2 million. His 24-day trial was considered the most
serious treason case in West German history.</p>

<p>A Texas scientist found that at least some palladium rods
used in "cold fusion" experiments might have been
contaminated with tritium. But some scientists said the
discovery doesn't undermine other evidence that a certain
kind of strange phenomenon is occurring in various "cold
fusion" experiments.</p>

<p>Medical researchers said a common treatment for chronic
back pain, called transcutaneous electrical nerve
stimulation, isn't any more effective in relieving symptoms
than no treatment at all. About 31 million Americans suffer
from lower back pain, which accounts for about $16 billion in
medical costs each year.</p>

<p>The House passed a bill that would accelerate the transfer
of Western technology to the Soviet Union and the emerging
democracies of Eastern Europe. But the measure, approved
312-86, includes amendments to withhold certain trade
benefits from the Soviets and from China because of
human-rights concerns.</p>

<p>NASA announced that the space shuttle Columbia will have
to be returned to a hangar at Cape Canaveral, Fla., to repair
a fuel leak, indefinitely delaying the spacecraft's astronomy
mission. The space agency statement came after a liquid
hydrogen leak reappeared during a launch-pad test.</p>

<p>Bush met in Washington with South Korea's President Roh,
who reported that during his talks Monday with Gorbachev, the
Soviet leader had agreed to help "melt down the ice" from the
Cold War on the Korean peninsula. Roh also said the San
Francisco meeting would "help greatly the process of
reunification" of North and South Korea.</p>

<p>Quayle was struck with a sheaf of papers by a man who had
called out to the vice president to get his attention on
Capitol Hill. Quayle was unhurt, and a 42-year-old resident
of the Virgin Islands was arrested and charged with assault
under federal law.</p>

<p>The Senate Agriculture Committee voted to ban the export
of unsafe pesticides. The move was an effort to protect U.S.
consumers who eat imported food. A loophole in current law
allows U.S. companies to export pesticides even if they
aren't registered for farm use or tolerated on foods in this
country.</p>

<p>Cambodia's Premier Hun Sen expressed doubts over whether a
guerrilla coalition headed by Prince Sihanouk would honor a
cease-fire accord reached by the two rival leaders Tuesday in
Tokyo. The Khmer Rouge didn't take part in the talks, aimed
at ending the 11-year-old conflict.</p>

<p>Ethiopia will allow the U.N. to act as an observer to
peace negotiations with the Eritrean rebels, signaling what
is considered a major change in policy. The Addis Ababa
government's statement came amid continued fighting between
the army and the insurgents, and followed two days of
intensive meetings among the military leadership.</p>

<p>Most pregnant women don't need multivitamin supplements
because proper diets can provide most of the nutrients they
require, the Institute of Medicine concluded. The study also
said that a weight gain in pregnancy of 25 pounds to 35
pounds is appropriate for women of normal prepregnancy
weight.</p>
