	<p class="article-leader">Exports of machine tools in the first quarter jumped 26%
from a year earlier, and producers say foreign demand
continues strong.
   The nation's machine tool builders exported $289.5 million
of machines in the first quarter, up from $230.6 million a
year earlier, according to the NMTBA -- The Association for
Manufacturing Technology, a McLean, Va., trade group.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Manufacturing companies in Canada, Western Europe, Mexico
and the Pacific Rim all have been buying equipment at a
lively pace in recent months, U.S. machine tool producers
say. Shipments to Canada more than doubled in the first
quarter, while exports to West Germany jumped 55% and sales
to Mexico rose 18%.</p>
<p>Machine tools are complex, often computer-controlled,
machines, ranging from lathes to metal-forming presses, that
shape most metal parts. Rising foreign demand indicates
aggressive efforts by overseas durable goods producers to
increase their productivity, machine tool producers say. That
could spell trouble for U.S. auto makers and other U.S.
companies competing in world-wide markets.</p>
<p>U.S. machine tool imports declined 8.2% during the first
quarter, NMTBA said. But the $538.5 million of imports still
were nearly twice U.S. exports. Imports have accounted for
about half the new machine tools installed in U.S. factories
in recent years.</p>
<p>However, U.S. producers are faring better in world machine
tool trade so far in 1990 than they have during any year
since 1981. Imports last year were 2.5 times exports, and
back in 1986, U.S. machine tool imports were 3.8 times larger
than exports.</p>
<p>Machine tool imports from Japan dropped 23% in the first
quarter, the major factor in the import decline. Japanese
producers, nonetheless, supplied nearly half the machine
tools imported into the U.S. during the latest quarter,
according to NMTBA figures. Imports from West Germany, the
second largest supplier with 14% of the first-quarter total,
were up a slight 1.6%.</p>
