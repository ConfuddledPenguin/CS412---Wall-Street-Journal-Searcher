	<p class="article-leader">Toro Co. said it anticipates that net income for its
fiscal year ending July 31 will be about $1.60 a share, or 20
to 30 cents less than some analysts' forecasts.
   Last year, the Bloomington, Minn., maker of outdoor
maintenance and irrigation equipment earned $22.1 million, or
$2.10 a share, on sales of $643.6 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a statement released after the close of New York Stock
Exchange trading yesterday, Toro blamed its decline on
continuing wet and cool weather in many of its major markets.
It also cited costs from consolidating operations of Lawn-Boy
Inc., the lawn-mower manufacturer it acquired last year from
Outboard Marine Corp.</p>
<p>Toro said its problems will cause it to post a loss of
about 15 cents a share for the fiscal fourth quarter. In the
year-earlier quarter, Toro earned $2.3 million, or 21 cents a
share, on sales of $137.5 million.</p>
<p>The company added that its woes probably will delay
product shipments and hurt earnings in the first fiscal
quarter of 1991.</p>
<p>Toro closed yesterday at $28.25, up 37.5 cents, in Big
Board composite trading.</p>
