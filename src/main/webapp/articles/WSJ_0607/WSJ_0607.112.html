	<p class="article-leader">Schering AG said it won't withdraw from the market or
change an oral contraceptive it has been selling for three
years, despite negative publicity about side effects of the
drug.
   The big West German pharmaceuticals and chemicals group's
shares took a battering in trading on the Frankfurt exchange
yesterday on investor concerns after a German television
report late Tuesday about cases of side effects from
Schering's Femovan oral contraceptive in West Germany.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A spokesman reached at Schering's West Berlin headquarters
said the company "sees no reason to make a change in the
risk/benefit analysis {for the product} now from at the time
of introduction in 1987." The drug first appeared in West
Germany in 1987 and by 1989 had been marketed under various
names throughout Europe.</p>
<p>Schering expects to win approval from the Food and Drug
Administration to market the contraceptive in the U.S. in
1992.</p>
