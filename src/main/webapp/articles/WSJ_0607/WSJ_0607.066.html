	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The largest Federal Housing Administration
fund will be broke by the end of the decade, predicted
Housing Secretary Jack Kemp, who urged higher FHA fees on
mortgages with low down payments.
   Mr. Kemp told the Senate subcommittee on housing and urban
affairs of a five-part strategy the Bush administration is
proposing to Congress "to ensure that the FHA continues to
meet its historic mission to provide affordable
home-ownership opportunities for low- and moderate-income
American families."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The FHA's mutual mortgage insurance fund, which insures
low down-payment mortgages on single-family homes, currently
is solvent, Secretary Kemp said, but posting losses of $350
million yearly. The losses result mainly from defaults on
insured mortgages. The fund's net worth shrank to $2.6
billion at the end of fiscal 1989 from $8 billion in 1979.</p>
<p>"Eventually, therefore, FHA will have a negative net worth
unless something is done," he added in a prepared statement.
"This is the clearest possible evidence of the urgent need to
reform FHA and manage it properly." The FHA is an agency of
the Department of Housing and Urban Development.</p>
<p>The "reform" strategy would impose an additional 0.5%
annual premium onto loans with lower down payments, which are
considered higher risks. The term of the added premium would
vary with the size of the down payment. The current premium
is 3.8% of the loan amount.</p>
<p>Closing costs would no longer be financed in the mortgage,
under Mr. Kemp's plan. "Home buyers would have to pay
two-thirds of the closing costs, in cash, when they buy the
house," he said. "With this change, every home buyer would
have at least 2% real equity in their home, which will reduce
defaults."</p>
<p>The additional premium and the closing-cost proposal would
make it more difficult for low-income families to buy homes,
according to the Mortgage Bankers Association of America. "In
addition to increasing premium fees on those least able to
afford higher fees, the proposals double the amount of cash
the FHA home buyer will need up front to buy a home, thereby
raising the cost of housing and negating the very benefit
that the program has provided to homeowners for the last 50
years," complained Warren Lasko, the association's executive
vice president.</p>
<p>Suzanne Hutchinson, executive vice president of the
Mortgage Insurance Companies of America, said her group
supports greater flexibility in the FHA premiums so they
"more accurately reflect the risk." She suggested, however,
that low-income, first-time home buyers be given special
consideration.</p>
<p>Mr. Kemp told the senators he will announce within the
month a plan to streamline procedures to reduce the FHA's
inventory of properties under foreclosure. The 80,000 houses
in the inventory cost the government $500 million a year to
maintain. "Foreclosed and boarded-up homes do not improve
with age . . . ," Mr. Kemp said. "FHA can achieve substantial
savings if it can cut its losses on foreclosures."</p>
<p>In testimony to the subcommittee, a General Accounting
Office housing expert said that allowing FHA to raise its
loan limit "would have the greatest effect" on increasing the
fund's cash balance. But John Ols, the GAO's director of
housing and community development issues, added that the loan
ceiling, which is currently $124,875, shouldn't be raised
until the fund is sound, which it now isn't.</p>
<p>Mr. Kemp cited a Price Waterhouse accounting firm study of
the FHA that said raising the loan limit wouldn't
significantly affect the status of the fund. "The resources
of FHA should not be committed to allowing relatively
high-income borrowers to buy homes with very low down
payments," he said.</p>
<p>He added that the FHA should stop insuring second homes.
"FHA's job is to help low- and moderate-income families
become first-time home buyers," the secretary said, "not
first-time second home buyers."</p>
