Graphics Corp. with computer equipment valued at up to $400

contract, Mentor will also buy new workstations that
Hewlett-Packard is developing, including machines that use as
their central controller Motorola Inc.'s new 68040
microprocessor. Hewlett-Packard, based in Palo Alto, Calif.,
plans to unveil its 68040 machines on June 18.</p>
