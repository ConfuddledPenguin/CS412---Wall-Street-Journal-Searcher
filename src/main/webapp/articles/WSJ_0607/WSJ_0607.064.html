	<p class="article-leader">A government report shows what many small-business owners
know only too well: It's getting tougher to make a killing.
   The growth rate of small-business profits has shrunk.
According to a U.S. Small Business Administration report,
earnings of non-farm sole proprietorships and partnerships
last year increased only 6.2% from the previous year. That's
a decline from 6.7% in 1988 and 9.2% in 1987 -- and a sharp
fall from 20.8% in 1984.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The figures are important: Non-farm sole proprietorships
and partnerships account for about 80% of the nation's small
enterprises, notes Bruce D. Phillips, the SBA's director of
database development.</p>
<p>The profit-growth slowdown may prompt another round of
belt-tightening, economists say. They think owners will
consider moving into cheaper spaces or trimming their supply
orders. Even more likely, they'll lay off employees, says
David L. Birch, president of Cognetics Inc., a Cambridge,
Mass., consulting firm. Labor accounts for nearly half of the
typical small business budget, he says.</p>
<p>Indeed, the problem has entrepreneurs fretting. Many
small-business owners claim they've already trimmed their
companies as much as they dare. Perry Case, owner of farm
implement stores in McCook, Neb., and Oberlin, Kan., says his
profit margins have dwindled since 1987. He has slashed
employee benefits in recent years and held down pay. He says
he doesn't know where to pare further. Although the
agricultural depression of the 1980s reduced by half the
number of rival dealers in his territory, competition remains
intense. "We're selling more {this year} but making less," he
says.</p>
<p>A few unusual factors have contributed to the sag in
profit growth. The slumping real-estate market has left
real-estate partnerships awash with red ink. And the Tax
Reform Act of 1986, which made partnerships a less attractive
form of ownership, has prompted owners to switch their
enterprises to the corporate form.</p>
<p>Of course, small businesses could be faring far worse.
While small businesses' profit growth rate slipped last year,
corporations' actual profits declined 5%. William C.
Dunkelberg, chief economist of the National Federation of
Independent Business, also notes that his surveys of more
than 2,000 small companies show their earnings have grown
steadily since 1983.</p>
<p>"Though {profit growth rates} might be weakening a wee
tad, small business almost never had it so good," he
maintains. The NFIB is the largest small-business trade
group.</p>
<p>Still, the indicator's regional trends show that no area
of the country had as much growth last year as two years
earlier. Small businesses in the nation's midsection --
stretching from Texas and Louisiana to Montana and the
Dakotas -- have yet to shake off the effects of the oil and
farming recessions. Growth in proprietors' and partners'
income in that area continues to trail the national rate.</p>
<p>Hardest hit has been Wyoming, where earnings actually have
dropped for three years in a row. "In a lot of the towns,
proprietors hang on in hopes they'll continue to survive,"
says John Birch, professor of economics at the University of
Wyoming at Laramie. "It's their home state, and a lot of them
don't want to move."</p>
<p>In Rawlins, Wyo., a town whose fortunes collapsed with the
energy industry, Michael Hickman, a construction contractor,
says he made money in 1988, broke even last year and doesn't
expect a profit this year. Moreover, he's working harder than
ever for the business he gets. He used to rely on local
contracts, but he now travels as much as 300 miles to find
work. This spring brought a new round of disappointments: Few
projects were bid so his summer workload is light.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, though, things look brighter. For instance, in
the western states of California, Arizona, Hawaii and Nevada,
proprietorship and partnership income grew 6.8%, faster than
the national rate. In New York and New Jersey, the measure
jumped 8.5%, the highest rate in any of the country's 10
regions.</p>
<p>Economists explain that the diverse business communities
in New Jersey and New York have enabled them to outpace the
nation for several years running. In New York, not only have
services mushroomed, but other small-business-dominated
industries, such as manufacturing and wholesale trade, remain
strong.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, contractions in the financial and publishing
industries have prompted some laid-off individuals to start
businesses. Tom Cassidy, who lost his sales job at John Wiley
& Sons Inc., a New York publisher, launched his own company
two years ago to sell books in Asia. He said he expects he'll
make $100,000 this year -- 35% more than he did at Wiley.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Despite profit growth, another report suggests there may
be trouble ahead for small businesses in two areas of
entrepreneurial prosperity: the Northeast and the West. The
American Express Co. report on the health of small business
indicates that both areas suffered large declines in new
incorporations during the second half of last year. The
report is based on a semiannual survey of five million small
businesses by Cognetics.</p>
<p>In the survey's nine-state Northeast region, the number of
business starts plummeted 10.5% during the second half from a
year earlier. The 13 Western states saw starts fall 12% -- a
sharp reversal from a 3.8% increase the prior year.</p>
<p>Nationally, starts fell 4.2%, compared with a slip of 0.1%
the year before. Barbara Barsa, vice president of American
Express's Small Business Services, says the drop means small
business will have "less of an impact" on the economy in
coming months because start-ups account for a large share of
employment growth.</p>
<p>In the Midwest, new incorporations in last year's second
half declined only 1.4%. And there's one bright spot for
start-ups: the South. That 17-state area posted a 2.6% uptick
in new incorporations. That's a sign of a possible turnaround
in a region where increases in small-business employment have
been trailing national rates.</p>
