	<p class="article-leader">CHANGES AT AUSCHWITZ</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Poland is removing communist propaganda from Auschwitz,
the Nazi death camp preserved as a Holocaust museum.</p>
<p>Removing the propaganda will amount to giving Auschwitz
back to the Jews, said Stefan Wilkanowicz, secretary of the
government's International Commission on the Future of
Auschwitz. Although more Jews were gassed at Auschwitz than
anywhere else, existing exhibits "are done in such a way that
the fate of the Jews is marginalized," he added.</p>
<p>Most Holocaust historians estimate that more than 90% of
the victims at Auschwitz were Jews. But this is stated
nowhere at the museum, which portrays the Jews as just one of
the 19 ethnic groups or nationalities killed at the camp.</p>
<p>Poland's new Solidarity-led government, embarrassed by a
recent Roman Catholic-Jewish dispute over a Catholic convent
at Auschwitz, has tripled its subsidy for the museum to
$315,000.</p>
<p>PROTECTIONISM IN SWEDEN</p>
<p>Sweden's agricultural sector is among the most protected
in the world, costing consumers an extra 18 billion kronor
($3 billion) a year for basic agricultural commodities such
as cereals, dairy products, meats and sugar, according to a
report by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
According to GATT, the average Swedish household could save
8,500 kronor a year if current protectionist measures were
eliminated. Parliament is scheduled to vote Saturday on a
plan to end some of the protectionist measures.</p>
<p>BRAZIL GOES AFTER SMOKERS</p>
<p>The Brazilian government has instituted new anti-smoking
measures. The measures, which went into effect at the
beginning of June, include a ban on cigarette sales to those
under 18, a ban on TV advertising for cigarettes between 6
a.m. and 9 p.m. and a ban on free samples. Current laws
prohibiting smoking in elevators, on buses and in other
public areas are routinely ignored in Brazil, where an
estimated 54.6 million people -- or about a third of the
population -- smoke.</p>
<p>AFRICA'S TRAGEDIES</p>
<p>One child dies every minute in Ethiopia of malnutrition or
preventable disease, Unicef officials told a news conference.
In Mozambique, they said, one child in three dies before
reaching the age of five. The officials said that war,
drought and donor fatigue combined to produce such grim
statistics in parts of Africa. Unicef has appealed for $15.3
million for emergency work in Ethiopia and $11.7 million for
Mozambique.</p>
<p>NEW COINS FOR TAIWAN</p>
<p>Taiwan's central bank said it would issue gold-bullion
coins early next year to commemorate the 80th anniversary of
the founding of the Republic of China. The coins will be
denominated at 1,000 New Taiwan dollars (US$37) each, the
Central Bank officials said. The new coins will be sold
principally to local consumers, officials said, although they
didn't rule out the possibility that they would be exported
in the future.</p>
<p>PROPOSED FILM BAN IN BRITAIN</p>
<p>Britain's opposition Labor Party called for a ban on a
Pakistani film that depicts the death by lightning of British
author Salman Rushdie. The film "International Guerrillas,"
which portrays Mr. Rushdie as a decadent playboy dedicated to
the overthrow of Islam, has been playing to packed houses in
Pakistan. The real Mr. Rushdie has been in hiding since
Iran's late Ayatollah Khomeini told Moslems to kill him,
charging that his novel "The Satanic Verses" blasphemed
Islam. Labor Party spokesman Donald Anderson said he opposed
censorship but the film could hurt race relations in Britain.</p>
<p>CHINA'S GENDER IMBALANCE</p>
<p>Millions of Chinese men have failed to find a wife, and
eligible women will be in even shorter supply in coming
years, according to a survey published by Beijing's China
News Service.</p>
<p>The service said the serious imbalance in the ratio of men
to women in China would worsen over the next 20 years. A
random check on 100 unmarried Chinese adults showed 93 were
men, it said.</p>
<p>Bachelors were found to outnumber single women by 10
million within the 29- to 49-year-old age group, the news
service said. It said rural men faced the bleakest prospects
as more and more city dwellers turned to rural areas to find
brides.</p>
<p>The report didn't give any reason for the sex-ratio
imbalance. But last February, the service attributed the
disparity to such factors as the drowning of baby girls in
rural areas, modern techniques allowing doctors to identify
fetal gender and the availability of abortion. Many Chinese
still believe it is imperative to bear a son to carry on the
family name.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>Brazilian President Fernando Collor de Mello was slightly
burned on his arm and face when he threw a torch onto a pile
of confiscated narcotics, officials said. The incident
happened when Mr. Collor was visiting a farm in the central
Mato Grosso do Sul state. . . . A new British 5 banknote
portrays Queen Elizabeth II with a double chin, wrinkles and
slight bags under her eyes. "It makes me look so old," one
London newspaper quoted the 64-year-old monarch as telling
the new note's designer. "But then I suppose I am old."</p>
