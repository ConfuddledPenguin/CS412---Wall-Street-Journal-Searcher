	<p class="article-leader">Washington, D.C. -- At the age of 12, I was initiated into
the fraternity of fly fishermen by a pantheistic rabbi who
refused to spray for mosquitoes at the summer camp he owned
because he thought it would upset the balance of nature. He
showed me how to pluck pink-fleshed native brook trout from
the primeval waters of northern Wisconsin spring creeks, and
taught me how to tie flies. Since then, I've been building a
collection of fly-tying materials including hare's ear masks,
junglecock feathers, and tools such as bodkins and
whip-finishers. My waders hang ever-ready in the basement
beside my rod cases, and my fishing vest is loaded with
hundreds of flies. I'm a member of Trout Unlimited, the
Federation of Fly Fishers and the Anglers of the Au Sable. I
dream of trips to prime fishing spots like New Zealand and
Patagonia, but I spend most of my time in Washington, D.C.,
working as a government lawyer. When the so-called "real
world" starts to feel oppressive, I escape for a quick fix of
fly fishing inside the Capital Beltway.
   The full moon glints yellow off the water, as I scan the
surface for the dimples made by rising fish. A flick of my
graphite fly rod, and my "torpedo taper" line snakes out,
dropping a deadly two-inch-long concoction of silver tinsel,
turkey wing feathers and clipped deer hair called a Muddler
Minnow on the ghostly white reflection of the Washington
Monument. A twitch of the fly, a savage strike, and I'm fast
to a chunky large-mouth bass, my 10th of the evening. As I
gently release the fish, people strolling by from the Vietnam
Memorial stop and stare. Once, the spot where I'm fishing was
occupied by "temporary" Quonset huts erected on the Mall
during World War II. Young Richard Nixon worked there in the
wartime Office of Price Administration. As president, he
ordered them torn down, making way for the National Park
Service to create the Constitution Gardens pond. Today, it's
an urban ecological success story, with a self-reproducing
population of bass and bluegills, aquatic plants and insects,
ducks and geese. The pond also contains Japanese koi, a kind
of giant goldfish, but these finicky members of the carp
family can't be induced to strike at my flies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A mile or so from Constitution Gardens, the Chesapeake and
Ohio Canal empties into the Potomac. A pre-railroad
transportation venture by a group of colonial capitalists
that included George Washington, the C&O Canal was a favorite
retreat of the late Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas,
who hiked along its towpath and led the campaign to have it
added to the National Park system. As the canal passes
through the upper part of Georgetown, mulberry trees overhang
its banks, creating another boon for fly fishers in the
federal city. Huge carp loll along the banks in early June,
gorging themselves on the sweet mulberries that fall into the
water. In the 1970s, an artful angler named Barry Serviente
ran a fly shop in Georgetown. After watching the feeding
fish, he had some imitation mulberry flies tied up with deer
hair dyed pink and purple, and bingo, he was catching carp on
a fly] It isn't like catching cutthroats in a pristine
Montana trout stream, but it is serious sport, with some
monster carp topping 20 pounds.</p>
<p>Across the Potomac in Arlington, Va., the boulder-strewn
upper portion of a stream called Four Mile Run flows through
a wooded glade of parkland before it widens into a
cement-lined flood control channel and empties into a marshy
cove just to the south of National Airport. Four Mile Run is
another urban ecological success story. Like other Potomac
tributaries, Four Mile harbored native brook trout before the
area around the Nation's Capital became densely settled. More
than three centuries of successive farming and urbanization
eventually destroyed the prehistoric fish population, and
only a few years ago the creek bed was littered with broken
bottles and other garbage. But in 1988, the Northern Virginia
chapter of Trout Unlimited joined forces with the Arlington
County Recreation Department, and launched an ambitious
project to restore trout to Four Mile Run. After the waters
were tested and found suitable, groups of volunteers spent
two days picking the litter out of the creek bed, and 4,000
trout from a hatchery were stocked. The program is now in its
third year, and has proved that it is possible to have clean
water in an urban environment. Restored though it may be,
Four Mile Run is more often fished by children using the
forbidden "garden hackle" (i.e. earthworm) than fly-rod
purists like me. I have even read reports of people fishing
there in suits] But it still offers a handy bucolic escape.</p>
<p>The most secluded fish venue inside the Beltway is one
I've never actually had the nerve to try: Rock Creek, just
downstream from the National Zoo. Here, the creek is
surrounded by dense woods on both sides, and the only access
is a bicycle path. Most cyclists are too intent on their own
athletic pursuits to notice the large-mouth bass and
bluegills swimming boldly about in these sheltered waters.
Profuse growths of poison ivy line the banks here, no doubt
sheltering copperheads and other pests. The Park Police have
a stable located right around the corner, and I always
thought they didn't want you fishing there. But a new
stream-side sign appeared this year, announcing that fishing
in Rock Creek is permitted with a valid D.C. license. If I
can somehow get through all the snakes and poison ivy and
slip into the stream, I know I'll catch a lot of fish.</p>
