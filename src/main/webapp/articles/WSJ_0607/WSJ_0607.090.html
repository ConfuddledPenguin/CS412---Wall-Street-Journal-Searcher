	<p class="article-leader">SIOUX CITY, Iowa -- Midwest Energy Co. said the Federal
Trade Commission has requested additional information about
the company's proposed merger with Iowa Resources Inc. of Des
Moines.
   The company said the request was made under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1975. Midwest
said the FTC's action extends the waiting period, which would
have expired last Sunday, to 20 days from the date the FTC
receives the new information.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Shareholders of both companies have approved the proposed
merger, which is termed a "merger of equals" by the two
utilities. The merger would create a new holding company
called Midwest Resources Inc., which would have an indicated
market value of about $923 million.</p>
<p>Midwest said it will respond as promptly as possible to
the request.</p>
