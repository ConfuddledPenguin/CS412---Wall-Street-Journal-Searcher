	<p class="article-leader">TRANS MOUNTAIN PIPE LINE Co., Vancouver, British Columbia,
said it plans to issue 35 million Canadian dollars (US$29.8
million) of 11.50% Series C debentures, maturing June 20,
2010. Trans Mountain, an oil pipeline concern 67.1%-owned by
B.C. Gas Inc., British Columbia's natural-gas utility, said
net proceeds of C$34.6 million will be used to reduce
short-term debt. It said the issue, which follows a prior
C$30 million debenture offering, completes financings linked
to a C$61 million pipeline expansion program that is now
completed. The debentures, which are redeemable at the
company's option, will be purchased and subsequently offered
privately by Gordon Capital Corp., a Toronto-based securities
dealer, the company said. The issue is expected to close June
20.</p>
