	<p class="article-leader">State regulators granted Illinois Power Co. a $75 million,
or 7.7%, rate increase, and found the utility's Clinton
nuclear power plant to be 61% "used and useful."
   The Decatur, Ill., utility had asked for a $215.8 million,
or 23%, rate increase, to cover the costs of the $4.2 billion
plant.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While the increase was about a third of what Illinois
Power had sought, yesterday's order also suggested the
company may be able to avoid at least a portion of big
potential write-downs.</p>
<p>A determination of whether financially strapped Illinois
Power will be able to continue paying dividends on its
preferred shares still rests on the outcome of a state court
appeal of an earlier Illinois Commerce Commission ruling.</p>
<p>While the company found the commission's ruling yesterday
the "most favorable yet," it added that the issue of the
plant's funding remains unresolved, and the rate increase
granted is "not enough to set us on a stable financial
course."</p>
<p>State regulations restrict utilities to billing customers
for only as much of a plant's cost as is necessary to meet
the overall demand for power. The percentage of the plant
found to be "used and useful" has thus been seen as the
pivotal matter in the latest request because it might hold
implications for possible further rate requests, as well as
the company's ability to pay its preferred dividend.</p>
<p>The commission said its latest order "sends a message"
that its members "are continuing to recognize the increased
usage of the Clinton nuclear power plant" and that "future
growth also will be subject to regulatory recognition." The
commission's order also "anticipates that all of Clinton's
capacity will be recognized in the foreseeable future."</p>
<p>In November, the commission's staff recommended that the
Clinton plant be declared 100% used and useful and that
Illinois Power be granted $147 million of the rate request.
But the agency's hearing examiner subsequently recommended
that Clinton be declared 42% used and proposed a rate
increase of $27 million.</p>
<p>Yesterday's ruling was the commission's latest say on the
utility's effort to recover Clinton's costs. In March 1989,
the commission deeply wounded the utility's financial
position by ruling that only 27% of the plant was needed and
by raising its calculations on how much Illinois Power had
imprudently overspent on the project to $666 million. In the
wake of that ruling, Illinois Power took a $346 million
write-off, eliminated its dividend on common stock and
trimmed its work force by about 500. Illinois Power has
appealed the March ruling, and the court is expected to rule
on the matter this autumn.</p>
<p>The company has said it is "vital" to get the Clinton
plant declared 100% used and useful because the utility might
face additional charges to write off that portion of the
plant ruled unnecessary.</p>
<p>Illinois Power said the commission's order yesterday
emphasizes "the importance of a favorable decision" in its
pending challenge of the March order. If the company is
unsuccessful in getting the court to overturn the March
ruling, it faces additional write-offs totaling about $408
million.</p>
<p>Should the court's ruling go against Illinois Power this
autumn, the resulting possible write-offs might put the
company in the position of having a negative retained income,
which could block them from paying preferred dividends for a
time. A spokesman said continuation of the preferred payout
will also rest on whether the commission's order, after a
company review, is found to offer a "reasonable level of
confidence" that the plant will be found 100% useful in time.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Illinois
Power shares rose 75 cents to $16.25 yesterday.</p>
