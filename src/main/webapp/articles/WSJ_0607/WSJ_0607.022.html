	<p class="article-leader">Your otherwise-excellent May 11 editorial "Real Soldiers,"
which attacks the myth of Soviet "liberation," repeats the
myth of 20 million Soviet civilian deaths during World War II
(your figure of 27 million total deaths less seven million
military deaths, of which almost half were sustained in the
wars of aggression against Poland and Finland, when the
Soviets were allies of the Nazis).
   In his carefully documented book "Stalin's Secret War,"
Nikolai Tolstoy puts the figure of Soviet civilian casualties
attributable to the Germans at about seven million. The
balance was directly or indirectly attributable to Soviet
policies during the Finnish campaign -- compelling the
evacuation of people suspected of pro-German sympathies; NKVD
purges; unprecedented mortality in the greatly swollen camps
of the Gulag, and 2.5 million Soviet refugees handed back to
the Soviets by the Allies in 1945 (Operation Keelhaul).</p>
