	<p class="article-leader">TransTechnology Corp.'s chairman, Arch Scurlock, said that
fourth-quarter and year-end results for this maker of
aerospace-defense and industrial products would be worse than
expected, and that the company would report a net loss in
both periods.
   TransTechnology also said it would report a loss from
continuing and discontinued operations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Los Angeles-based company didn't specify the size of
the anticipated operating loss, which won't be reported for
two weeks. Lee M. Parker, vice president, investor relations,
characterized it as "significant" for both periods. He said
that larger-than-anticipated inventory write-downs had
produced the losses.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Parker said the company expects revenue
for the year to drop 15.74%, to $198 million. He noted,
however, that in 1989, the company sold two units which had
contributed about $21 million to revenue. The remaining drop
in revenue was due to the closing of a factory, among other
things, he said.</p>
<p>For the year ended March 31, 1989, the company reported
net income of $9.2 million, or $1.80 a share. The net income
included a loss from discontinued operations of $1.2 million.
Revenue for the year was $235.2 million.</p>
