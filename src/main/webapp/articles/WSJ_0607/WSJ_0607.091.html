	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Profit-taking in some high-flying blue chips
and growth stocks knocked the stock market down for the
second consecutive day.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 13.35 to 2911.65.
Among broader averages, Standard & Poor's 500-stock index
fell 1.68 to 364.96, and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index
dropped 1.32 to 339.98. Declining issues topped advancers by
872 to 656 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume
totaled 164,020,000 shares.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Meanwhile, some small stocks gained. The Nasdaq composite
index rose 0.35 to 464.96.</p>
<p>Though large institutions are still looking for cheap
stocks to buy, yesterday they sold many of the key stocks
that have led the rally for the past few weeks. Home Depot,
which is trading at nearly 40 times expected 1990 earnings,
lost 1 1/2 to 58 1/2. Among other growth stocks with prices
at about 20 times expected 1990 earnings: Merck fell 1 to 82
3/4; PepsiCo dropped 7/8 to 74 7/8 and Limited fell 1 to 49
1/4.</p>
<p>Oil shares also fell prey to profit-taking, despite a
rebound in crude oil prices, which came amid unsubstantiated
rumors of a nuclear accident in the Soviet Union. July
futures on West Texas Intermediate crude rose 24 cents a
barrel, to $16.92, in New York trading.</p>
<p>Eugene L. Nowak, an oil analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds,
said Saudi Arabia's discounts on crude oil purchase contracts
for July should hold down oil prices, causing "downward
trading pressure" on energy stocks.</p>
<p>"Right now, it's looking like (the price of oil) might get
a little bit weaker than we've thought," said Mr. Nowak,
although he added that he is maintaining his estimate of $19
to $19.50 a barrel as an average price this year for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude.</p>
<p>Oil stocks ranking among the most active Big Board issues
included Occidental Petroleum, which dropped 5/8 to 26 1/2 on
composite volume of 1.6 million shares; Exxon, which fell 3/8
to 47 7/8, and Texaco, which lost 1 1/2 to 57 7/8.</p>
<p>Among other oil issues, Chevron fell 7/8 to 69 1/2, Mobil
lost 1 to 62 1/8, Amoco slid 3/4 to 52, Royal Dutch Petroleum
fell 1 to 75 1/4 and Atlantic Richfiel lost 2 to 116 1/4.</p>
<p>Amerada Hess dropped 3/4 to 44 3/4; Dean Witter lowered
its estimate of second-quarter earnings from 45 cents a share
to a range of zero to 25 cents.</p>
<p>Oil field-services stocks were active for the second
consecutive session, but prices in the sector stabilized
after dropping sharply Tuesday. Schlumberger gained 1/2 to 56
1/4, Halliburton lost 1/4 to 46, Baker Hughes dropped 1/4 to
27 3/8 and Smith International slid 3/8 to 14 3/8.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, shares of oil refining and marketing companies
bucked the group's decline. This newspaper reported in its
"Heard on the Street" column that Alan Gaines, a money
manager specializing in energy issues, is making a long-term
case for buying the stocks based on the potential for the
companies' properties to increase in value.</p>
<p>Diamond Shamrock, one of several issues Mr. Gaines favors,
gained 1/2 to 25 1/2. Others include Ashland Oil, which
slipped 1/4 to 36; Horsham, which closed unchanged at 8 1/2,
and Crown Central Petroleum, whose Class B shares jumped 1
3/8 to 33 5/8 on the American Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Eastman Kodak climbed 1 7/8 to 41 7/8 on two million
shares in trading fueled by speculation that Hoffmann-La
Roche may be interested in the company's Sterling Drug unit
and that the judge in Polaroid's patent-infringement case
against the company, won in 1985, would delay awarding
damages until next year. Kodak declined comment on the
activity in its stock; Hoffmann, the U.S. unit of
Switzerland's Roche Holding, denied the Sterling rumor.</p>
<p>Upjohn dropped 1 1/4 to 42 on 1.8 million shares as merger
speculation cooled. The stock had advanced 4 5/8 points over
the three previous sessions after Business Week reported that
the company may become the next pharmaceutical maker to seek
a merger partner.</p>
<p>Lowe's fell 1 1/8 to 46 3/4. The company reported that
sales at stores open at least one year rose just 1% from the
year-earlier level.</p>
<p>Construction stocks rallied following the passage of a
California referendum that would double the state's gasoline
tax, to 18 cents a gallon, to provide funds for an $18.5
billion freeway-building program. Beazer rose 5/8 to 10 1/2,
CalMat rose 1 1/4 to 34 3/4 and Perini jumped 3 to 25 1/2.</p>
<p>Several bank issues, which recently rebounded as interest
rates moved lower, fell on profit-taking yesterday. Bankers
Trust fell 1 1/8 to 45; BankAmerica slipped 1/8 to 33 and
Citicorp fell 5/8 to 24 3/8.</p>
<p>Union Carbide, a target of restructuring speculation in
the past, topped the Big Board's list of most active issues.
The stock went up 1 to 21 as nearly 2.1 million shares
changed hands.</p>
<p>Norfolk Southern gained 1 3/8 to 43 5/8. Merrill Lynch
recommended the stock and said it believes the company's
earnings will grow at a significantly faster pace than those
of other railroads.</p>
<p>NCH plummeted 4 1/2 to 58 3/4, reflecting disappointment
with its earnings report for the fiscal quarter ended April
30. Net income for the period fell 3.7% from a year earlier.</p>
<p>TransTechnology skidded 1 7/8 to 7 7/8 after saying
results for the fiscal year ended March 31 were worse than it
had expected. The company said it expects to report losses
for both the fiscal fourth quarter and the year.</p>
<p>General Host gained 5/8 to 7 1/4. The company reported
that net for its fiscal first quarter, a 16-week period ended
May 20, jumped 261% from the comparable year-ago period.</p>
<p>Armco added 3/8 to 9 3/8. The company said a Texas judge
set aside $26 million of the $48.8 million in damages
assessed against the company in a breach-of-contract dispute
over an office lease.</p>
<p>Eagle-Picher Industries rose 1/2 to 4 3/8. The company
said it is putting three units up for sale as part of a plan
to raise cash for payment of asbestos-litigation climbs.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 0.36
to 364.19. Volume totaled 14,490,000 shares.</p>
