	<p class="article-leader">Genentech Inc. said federal regulators will allow the
company to sell its Activase drug as a treatment for
obstruction of the lungs' arteries, providing a new use for
the company's biggest drug.
   The Food and Drug Administration granted the license this
week, allowing the use of Activase in a condition called
acute massive pulmonary embolism in which blood clots block
blood vessels in the lungs. Clinical trials of patients
suffering from pulmonary embolism showed Activase, a
clot-dissolving agent, to be safe and effective, according to
Genentech, which is based in South San Francisco, Calif.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The FDA previously approved Activase for treating heart
attacks. This week's approval broadens the drug's use to
another life-threatening condition and could shore up the
market for the drug, which has been smaller than originally
expected.</p>
<p>About 130,000 patients have been diagnosed with pulmonary
embolism, of which about 10,000 are eligible for the kind of
therapy where Activase would be used, Genentech said.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Genentech closed at $27.25, up 12.5 cents.</p>
