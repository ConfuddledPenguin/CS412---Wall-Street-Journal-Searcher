	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Citing inaccurate testing procedures, a
federal judge quashed thousands of marijuana tests performed
on New York City Transit Authority employees in the
mid-1980s.
   U.S. District Judge Robert P. Patterson, in a 100-page
opinion, also invalidated the Transit Authority's policy of
having employees who are neither suspected drug users nor in
safety-sensitive jobs take urine tests.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We believe this is the first case in which an entire
drug-testing program has been invalidated for violating the
due process rights of public employees," said Edward J.
Davis, staff attorney for the Legal Action Center, which
brought the 1985 class action lawsuit against the Transit
Authority. "Public employers now have to be very careful to
use accurate drug-testing methods, and to provide employees
with adequate opportunity to challenge the results."</p>
<p>A Transit Authority spokesman said the agency had no
comment on the decision other than to say, "We do plan to
appeal it, and feel it will be overturned in the appeals
process."</p>
<p>In his decision, Judge Patterson said urine samples were
frequently contaminated at collection sites, and that
laboratory methods were innaccurate. Moreover, he noted that
employees weren't given adequate notice of test results, or
access to some of their samples, so that they could have them
independently tested to challenge the results.</p>
<p>The decision came after a partial settlement last February
in the same suit. At that time, the Transit Authority agreed
to compensate about 100 employees, including rehiring many
who had been fired after undergoing testing. It paid other
employees compensation of up to $25,000. Yesterday's decision
covered the remaining employees who joined the suit.</p>
<p>Judge Patterson has set a conference for June 19 to begin
defining compensation and to determine whether an injunction
is needed to cover current testing policies.</p>
