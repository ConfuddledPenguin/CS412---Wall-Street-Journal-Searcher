	<p class="article-leader">KANATA, Ontario -- Mitel Inc., a U.S. unit of Mitel Corp.,
agreed to pay as much as $10 million to acquire Coradian
Corp., a U.S. distributor of telecommunications equipment.
   Mitel, a maker of telecommunications equipment, said the
price could be reduced to a minimum of $7.5 million,
depending on Coradian's financial results. Coradian, based in
Latham, N.Y., had 1989 sales of more than $27 million. It
reported a loss of $247,000 for the 1990 first quarter.</p>
