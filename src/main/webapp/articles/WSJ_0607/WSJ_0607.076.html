	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. split
itself into two major divisions -- one taking the resurrected
name of Lehman Brothers -- in the brokerage firm's latest
effort to revive its sagging fortunes.
   Under the long-awaited change, to be completed in August,
Shearson will halve its businesses with each part accountable
only to itself and ultimately to parent American Express Co.
One is a Lehman Brothers division responsible for investment
banking and trading; the other is a Shearson Lehman Brothers
division, with nearly 10,000 stockbrokers, responsible for
individual-investor brokerage activities and money
management.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Shearson hopes the revival of the 140-year-old Lehman
Brothers name, dormant since Shearson's 1984 takeover of
Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb Inc., will rally the troops after
months of management and financial turmoil at Shearson. It
remains to be seen whether the name change will have any real
benefit.</p>
<p>The changes mean that Shearson traders, investment bankers
and research analysts will announce themselves as "Lehman
Brothers" employees; stockbrokers who deal with the public
will be called "Shearson Lehman Brothers" brokers.</p>
<p>In effect, the regrouping recognizes that two major
takeovers undertaken by Shearson in its rapid expansion in
the 1980s, first of Lehman Brothers and then of E.F. Hutton &
Co., never really worked.</p>
<p>Some say Shearson should never have tried to force the
integration of Lehman, in particular, into the rest of
Shearson, the nation's second-biggest securities firm. It was
"a major mistake" when Shearson deemphasized the
tradition-rich Lehman Brothers name, said Peter J. Solomon,
who was a Lehman partner for 29 years and now runs Peter J.
Solomon Co., an investment banking firm. "There's always been
value to the Lehman name."</p>
<p>It's more than symbolic that under the regrouping the
Shearson name is de-emphasized and the Hutton name, acquired
in Shearson's ill-fated purchase of Hutton after the 1987
stock market crash, is purged completely. Earlier plans
called for "Hutton" to remain at least in the name of the
holding company.</p>
<p>Shearson's top officials acknowledge that at this point,
Lehman Brothers is the best they have in their family of
names, and the names Shearson and Hutton clearly aren't in
that category.</p>
<p>"Clearly, Lehman Brothers is one of the premier names,"
said Howard L. Clark Jr., Shearson chairman, who will now be
chairman of both new divisions as well. "I don't think it has
lost its luster. And bankers and traders are looking forward
to the resurrection of the name."</p>
<p>Analysts say dividing the firm into two separate
businesses makes sense, noting that other securities firms
that are more narrowly focused, such as investment bank
Morgan Stanley Group Inc. and the A.G. Edwards & Sons
brokerage firm, have done well lately.</p>
<p>"A nickel and a nickel is still a dime in terms of what
they ultimately earn, but to the extent it helps the capital
markets side of the business, it's a plus," said Lawrence
Eckenfelder, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.</p>
<p>But the split is only a first step, analysts said. "It's a
good game plan," said James Hanbury, an analyst at Wertheim
Schroder & Co., "Now they have to go ahead and run it."</p>
<p>The regrouping triggered several new executive
appointments and is likely to cause weeks of additional
middle-level employee shuffling at Shearson, officials
familiar with the plans said.</p>
<p>Shearson will rename itself Shearson Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc.; its broker-dealer unit will be renamed
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.</p>
<p>As expected, the Lehman Brothers division will be headed
by Richard S. Fuld Jr. and Sherman R. Lewis Jr., who will be
co-chief executive officers. Mr. Fuld will also be president,
and Mr. Lewis will be vice chairman and head of the executive
committee.</p>
<p>As previously reported, heading the Shearson Lehman
Brothers division as president and chief executive will be
Jonathan S. Linen, an American Express official who just
joined Shearson.</p>
<p>For now, Shearson's big Boston Co. money-management
company will remain a separate subsidiary, but there are
plans to fold it into the Shearson Lehman Brothers division
later in the year.</p>
<p>The Shearson regrouping is part of American Express's
effort to revitalize Shearson after a series of financial
setbacks and management turmoil, including the forced
resignation of Shearson Chairman Peter A. Cohen early this
year. American Express, which long had wanted to reduce its
Shearson stake, instead has had to pump more than $1 billion
into the firm in a plan in which it will acquire the shares
of Shearson's common it doesn't already own.</p>
<p>To pay for retrenchment efforts, Shearson took $787
million in charges in the first quarter, giving it an
industry-record $915 million loss.</p>
<p>Mr. Clark said the regrouping has "both strategic and
symbolic significance. By placing similar businesses under
common management," Mr. Clark said, Shearson will foster
"`entrepreneurialism and teamwork."</p>
<p>At the very least, the split will make each division
easier to spin off or sell in the future, analysts said. Mr.
Eckenfelder said such takeover speculation has already been
"a plus" for American Express stock, "although it shouldn't
attach a couple points to it."</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
American Express stock closed at $31.25 a share, down 12.5
cents and off its 52-week high of $39.375.</p>
<p>Some Lehman veterans now at other Wall Street firms are
angry at Shearson for reviving the Lehman name they still
cherish, especially while few top former Lehman partners,
among them Mr. Fuld, remain at Shearson.</p>
<p>Purging the 86-year-old Hutton name, meanwhile, doesn't
sit too well with some former Hutton employees. "It's a shame
to lose the name. It was a great name for many, many years,"
lamented Scott Pierce, Hutton's president from December 1983
through late 1985.</p>
<p>Still, Mr. Pierce, now a top official at Prudential
Insurance Co. of America, said it probably makes sense from
Shearson's viewpoint to lose the Hutton identity because
Shearson was the acquiring firm and Hutton doesn't have the
tradition of Lehman Brothers.</p>
<p>There are practical benefits to the Shearson regrouping,
said Mr. Clark. For example, only about one-third of the
mutual funds Shearson brokers now sell are its own, said Mr.
Clark. "By grouping asset management and {brokerage
activities}, we hope to have them work more closely together
and sell more of our own products," he said.</p>
<p>Shearson cut 2,000 employees early in the year. As for
further staff reductions, Mr. Clark said, "We have more
fine-tuning to do, as opposed to significant layoffs. What I
don't want to do is to cut into muscle."</p>
<p>Mr. Clark said he will head a companywide executive
committee whose members include Messrs. Fuld, Lewis and
Linen. Other members are: John R. Laird, Boston Co. chairman;
Jerome H. Miller, who directs the money-management business;
Joseph J. Plumeri II, who heads the domestic branch network;
Ronald J. Yoo, chief administrative officer; Robert Druskin,
chief financial officer; and David S. Hershberg, chief legal
officer.</p>
