	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Merrill Lynch & Co., a New York-based securities
firm, said it launched Austro-Hungary Fund Ltd., a $50
million closed-end fund to invest in listed stocks in the
Austrian and Hungarian markets. A closed-end fund issues a
fixed number of shares that are traded like stocks.
   The dollar-denominated fund is expected to be the first
foreign company listed on the Hungarian Stock Exchange when
that market reopens on June 21, said Charles Lillis, a
director of Merrill Lynch's international unit here.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The fund's portfolio will be equally divided between
Austrian and Hungarian issues, with the Austrian investments
emphasizing companies with business links to Hungary, said
Peter Kysel, a managing director of Lloyds Investment
Management International, the new fund's adviser.</p>
