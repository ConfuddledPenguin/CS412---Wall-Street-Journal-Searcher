	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The credit squeeze that is making it hard
for some businesses to get loans hasn't pinched consumers so
far.
   Consumer borrowing has slowed noticeably since Jan. 1.
Many economists expect the Federal Reserve's latest set of
consumer credit numbers, due out today, to show an increase
for April at an annual rate of about 3%, far slimmer than the
gains of the past year and well below the double-digit growth
earlier in the 1980s.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But that slowdown seems to reflect a new caution among
consumers rather than a tightening of bank-lending practices.
Indeed some banks, in their effort to steer clear of risky
real-estate loans, seem anxious to put even more of their
money into higher-profit consumer loans. Many say there are
fewer credit-worthy consumers to go around.</p>
<p>"Financial institutions are actually going after consumer
loans," says Sung Won Sohn, chief economist of Norwest Corp.,
whose banks are becoming increasingly cautious in lending to
businesses. "Consumer loans are enormously profitable. For
credit cards, depending on the region you can charge 22% or
23%. Those are huge margins. You build in significant
losses."</p>
<p>William Seidman, one of the nation's top banking
regulators as chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., agrees. Despite more frequent defaults, consumer loans
still provide "higher-than-average margins," he says, adding:
"Right now, it's a reasonably profitable area."</p>
<p>To be sure, scattered banks, jittery about rising
delinquencies and record personal bankruptcies, are beginning
to tighten their consumer credit spigot a bit. "We're seeing
a little bit of that," says Fritz Elmendorf, vice president,
communications, for the Consumer Bankers Association. "It's
not necessarily a lot but on the margins there are
adjustments that are being made. It is an effort to improve
the quality of some of the loans."</p>
<p>To buy a $15,000 car with help from Connecticut National
Bank, a customer has to put down $3,000. Last year, the bank
wanted $1,500 down.</p>
<p>In addition to doubling the required down payment on auto
loans to 20%, the Hartford-based bank has also lowered its
ceiling for a home equity line of credit to 75% of the home's
value from 80%.</p>
<p>"We felt that the real estate market in the Northeast was
softening and despite the fact that our home equity portfolio
didn't mirror the rest of the region in foreclosures or
losses we felt it was good prudent business practice to heed
the warnings," says Donald Grigley, head of consumer lending
at the bank.</p>
<p>But Treasury officials watching the credit situation
closely see no threat of a widespread effort to curb consumer
lending. Indeed, the Fed's most recent survey of senior bank
loan officers found banks generally more willing to make
consumer installment loans.</p>
<p>Conversations with bankers generally confirm the
observations of federal officials. NCNB Corp., the large
Southern bank holding company, is soliciting credit card
customers as aggressively as ever, and an official says there
aren't any plans to change. In the face of a slumping auto
industry, Liberty National Bancorp. of Louisville, Ky., has
even expanded the kinds of auto loans it offers.</p>
<p>"We haven't changed our policy on direct lending at all,"
says Thomas Kaplan, senior vice president and chief lending
officer at First Pennsylvania Bank.</p>
<p>Most likely, analysts believe, the slowdown in consumer
borrowing stems from the softening economy. "Generally,
consumer credit is growing at about the same pace as consumer
spending in general," said Charles Luckett, a Federal Reserve
economist who specializes in consumer credit. "It's more
sluggish than during most of this economic upswing."</p>
<p>At Shawmut National Bank in Boston, where the local
economy has deteriorated sharply from its 1980s boom, an
average of 75 to 80 consumer-loan applications are coming in
daily, compared with between 100 and 150 daily earlier this
year. "It's slowed down in all areas, really," says Dexter
Gasper, a senior loan analyst, adding: "Home equity, personal
loans, auto loans. Everything."</p>
<p>But even with the worsening economic conditions, Shawmut
hasn't tightened its standards or terms for dispensing
consumer credit. "Not a bit," Mr. Gasper stresses. "Why
should we?"</p>
<p>After a long economic expansion, fueled in a large part by
consumer borrowing and spending, a number of banks are also
finding that fewer loan applicants meet their standards.</p>
<p>George Williams, the AmSouth Bancorp executive in charge
of auto loans, used to accept about half the loan
applications that came across his desk. Now, he says, only
between 25% and 35% of applicants for car loans meet the
Birmingham, Ala., bank's criteria for approval.</p>
<p>"We're seeing basically the same number of applications,
but the quality has deteriorated, which is basically the
result of people being over-indebted and having bad credit,"
Mr. Williams says.</p>
<p>"There has been a slow erosion in consumer credit
quality," Mr. Seidman says. "It's something that has to be
watched."</p>
