	<p class="article-leader">PHOENIX, Ariz. -- Valley National Corp. said it has hired
CS First Boston Corp. to solicit offers for its Utah and
California bank subsidiaries.
   Valley National Corp.'s main bank is Valley National Bank
of Arizona with assets of $9.2 billion. Units to be sold are
Valley Bank & Trust Co. of Utah, with assets of $944 million,
and California Valley Bank, with assets of $111 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company said that it decided to concentrate its assets
in Arizona and that the sale of the units will strengthen its
financial structure. The units will be sold at a price in
excess of book value.</p>
<p>Valley National Corp., the holding company for Arizona's
largest bank, has been undergoing difficult times because of
the depressed Arizona real-estate market and nonperforming
real-estate loans. In the first quarter, profit was $607,000,
or three cents a share, compared with $18.9 million, or 96
cents a share, a year earlier. In 1989, Valley National had a
loss of $149.2 million, or $7.55 a share, compared with
profit of $67.3 million, or $3.41 a share, in 1988.</p>
<p>A large number of investors are evidently betting that the
price of the company's shares will decline in the future. A
spokesman said that 25% of the company's shares are held as
shorts. In a short sale, an investor sells stock he doesn't
yet own by borrowing it from a broker to deliver it to the
purchaser. The investor hopes to make a profit by buying an
equal number of shares later at a lower price to replace the
borrowed stock.</p>
