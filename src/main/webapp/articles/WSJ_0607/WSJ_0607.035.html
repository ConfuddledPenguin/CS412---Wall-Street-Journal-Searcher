	<p class="article-leader">MOUNT LAUREL, N.J. -- Tyco Toys Inc. said that talks
between it and a party seeking to acquire the company were
terminated without an agreement being reached. The party's
identity wasn't disclosed.
   The toy maker said last week that it received an
unsolicited approach from the potential buyer. Tyco's stock,
which rose on heavy volume following that announcement,
closed yesterday at $22.75 a share in national
over-the-counter trading, down $4.75.</p>
