	<p class="article-leader">Texas Air Corp. said it would change its name to
Continental Air Holdings Inc.
   The move reflects the company's consolidation of its
holdings chiefly to its Continental Airlines unit. Texas Air,
Houston, owned Eastern Airlines until a bankruptcy judge in
April appointed a trustee to run the unit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The name change, announced at the company's annual
meeting, will take effect Monday.</p>
<p>Shareholders also approved the addition of three new
directors to the Texas Air board to represent preferred
shareholders. Texas Air was forced to add the new board
members because its loan covenants called for them if the
company failed to pay dividends on its preferred stock for
six consecutive quarters. Texas Air stopped paying dividends
in the fourth quarter of 1988.</p>
<p>The new members are Gerald Tsai Jr., former chairman of
Primerica; James A. Lawrence, chairman of LEK Partnership;
and Lindsay Fox, a former Eastern Airlines board member.
Texas Air boardmember Robert Garrett also was appointed to
represent preferred holders.</p>
<p>Shareholders also re-elected the current board members.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Corrections & Amplifications</p>
<p>TEXAS AIR Corp. will change its name to Continental
Airlines Holdings Inc. effective Monday, and its stock will
then trade on the American Stock Exchange under the symbol
CTA. The new name was misstated in yesterday's edition.</p>
