	<p class="article-leader">Bass PLC said it plans to add more than 50,000 rooms to
its Holiday Inn hotel chain over the next three to five
years, boosting total capacity by 16%.
   The British food, drinks and leisure concern's 1,576
hotels world-wide will have about 365,000 rooms, up from
around 315,000 currently. About 30,000 of the rooms will be
added in North America.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Bass also said cost-saving plans at its Holiday Inn
business in North America are expected to save $17 million a
year. The company said the move will result in a $20 million
charge against earnings.</p>
<p>The U.K. group purchased the North American assets of
Holiday Corp. in August for $1.98 billion after paying $475
million for the company's international hotels businesses in
1988.</p>
<p>Bass also said it plans to sell four of its Crest hotels
to Buckingham International PLC, a Holiday Inn franchisee.
Terms weren't disclosed.</p>
