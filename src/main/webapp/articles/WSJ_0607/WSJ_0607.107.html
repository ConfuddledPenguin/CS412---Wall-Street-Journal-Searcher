	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. and four other
utilities agreed to absorb a total of $263 million of cost
overruns on their Nine Mile Point 2 nuclear power plant as
part of a final settlement of litigation with New York state.
   In Albany, Paul L. Gioia, analyst at First Albany Corp.,
said the settlement should have only a "minor impact" on
Niagara Mohawk, the largest plant owner.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Nine Mile Point 2 went into commercial operation in April
1988, some eight years behind schedule and billions of
dollars over its estimated cost. Since going into service, it
has been hit with equipment and other operating problems that
have led to numerous lawsuits involving defendants that
include the plant's contractors.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the New York state Attorney General's office
said that customers of the five utilities will receive $28
million in refunds. That sum represents money previously
collected from customers to cover the cost of buying
replacement power from other utilities when Nine Mile Point 2
was forced out of service in October 1988.</p>
<p>Niagara Mohawk said its customers will receive the largest
refund, about $18 million, reflecting the utility's 41% stake
in the generating facility. Other plant owners are Long
Island Lighting Co., 18%; New York State Electric & Gas
Corp., 18%; Rochester Gas & Electric Corp., 14%; and Central
Hudson Gas & Electric Corp., 9%.</p>
<p>The five utilities also will absorb $203 million in
construction costs that they had wanted to pass on to their
customers. Niagara Mohawk said its share of this disallowance
will total $66 million, but it added that its books already
reflect the writedown.</p>
<p>In addition, the utilities gave up their fight to increase
the cap on how much of Nine Mile Point 2's total $6.59
billion cost they could collect in rate increases from
customers. The now-permanent $4.16 billion cap was set in
1986.</p>
<p>A separate part of the agreement calls for General
Electric Co. to provide $32 million of maintenance and
equipment on the plant to settle litigation with the
utilities arising from the plant's problems.</p>
