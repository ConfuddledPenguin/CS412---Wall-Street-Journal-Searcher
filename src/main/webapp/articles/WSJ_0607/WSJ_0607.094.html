	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co.
financial service operations topped all commercial banks in
1989 as the nation's largest holders of U.S. commercial and
industrial loans, according to a study by SMR Research Corp.
   The study showed that GM ended the year with $23.2 billion
in commercial and industrial loans, a drop of 0.4%. That
decline compared with a 60% rise in loans by Ford to $16.8
billion. Most of GM's commercial and industrial loans
financed car dealer inventories and other property. Ford's
big increase came from the acquisition last year of the
Associates Corp. finance company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Citicorp, the nation's largest commercial bank holding
company, came in third, according to the study with $16.3
billion of the loans. That figure represents a 4.4% decline
in the U.S., although Citicorp dominated world-wide business
lending because of the company's sizable portfolio of loans
to foreign corporations. At year end, Citicorp had $37.6
billion in commercial and industrial loans outstanding.</p>
<p>Stuart A. Feldstein, SMR president, said many banks have
been large originators of business loans, but resell the
loans to other lenders.</p>
<p>The SMR study found that the total domestic commercial and
industrial loan market reached $815.2 billion last year -- up
5.5% from a year earlier. Growth of the loans at banks, which
still hold about three-quarters of the market, was 4.3%.</p>
