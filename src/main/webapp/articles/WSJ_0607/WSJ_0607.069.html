	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Standard & Poor's Corp. said it formed a new
industry group from the Retail Specialty group to consist
only of apparel retailers. The concern also transferred Nacco
Industries from the coal group to the manufacturing group.
   The new group in the company's 500-stock index, Retail
Specialty (Apparel), has four companies: Charming Shoppes,
Gap Inc., Limited Inc. and TJX Cos. The remaining companies
in Retail Specialty are Circuit City, Home Depot, Lowe's
Cos., Melville Corp., Price Co., Tandy Corp. and Toys "R" Us.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Standard & Poor's said the shift of Nacco reflects its
change from primarily coal production to manufacturing. The
company also makes forklift trucks and household appliances.</p>
