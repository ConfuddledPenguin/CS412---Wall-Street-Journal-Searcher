	<h3>Your Money Matters: Life-Insurance Breaks: Being Methuselah Isn't Enough</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">Life insurance companies are increasingly drawing a
distinction between people who are basically healthy and
those they consider "preferred" risks.
   The idea is that people whose health and life style make
them likely to live longer than others of the same age and
sex deserve to get a break on their insurance premiums.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The difference can be significant. On a term policy, where
the savings is most visible, preferred status can cut annual
premiums by as much as 35%, compared with the same company's
premiums for a "standard" buyer.</p>
<p>But while some life insurance buyers are getting
especially low rates, some others are apparently getting
taken in by misleading claims.</p>
<p>"There are agents who quote preferred rates and don't
disclose that, first of all, they are preferred rates, and,
second, what it takes to get those rates," says Jeffrey
Arnett, general manager of InsuranceQuote Services Inc., a
Chandler, Ariz., agency that sells term insurance by
telephone and mail.</p>
<p>William N. Scott, a vice president in Transamerica Corp.'s
life insurance operation, agrees that preferred rates are
sometimes "misused" by agents who don't tell clients the
whole story. "It can leave an impression of almost a
bait-and-switch thing" when such a buyer is denied preferred
status, he says.</p>
<p>The qualifications for preferred treatment differ from
insurer to insurer, and a person may qualify at one company
and not another. In general, people can't get preferred rates
if they are overweight, have medical problems such as high
blood pressure or engage in such hazardous activities as
flying their own planes.</p>
<p>The special rates are also usually limited to people who
don't smoke. But some companies offer preferred smoker rates
that are lower than their usual smoker rates and higher than
rates for nonsmokers.</p>
<p>Some of the factors that can disqualify an applicant from
preferred status may come as a surprise. For instance, some
insurers exclude people who have gotten more than a couple of
speeding tickets in recent years. Others rule out people who
are healthy but who have had an immediate relative die before
age 60 of a heart problem or other specified ailment.</p>
<p>Insurance buyers may also be denied preferred status
because of conditions they aren't aware of, such as a high
cholesterol level uncovered through a blood test.</p>
<p>Just how many people actually make the preferred grade?
That depends on whom you ask.</p>
<p>Issuers such as San Francisco-based Transamerica and
Midland Mutual Life Insurance Co., a big term insurer based
in Columbus, Ohio, say more than 80% of their nonsmoking
business is being written preferred. But Ted Bernstein, a
Chicago life-insurance consultant, says only 20% to 30% of
the clients he directs to those firms and others qualify for
preferred rates. Mr. Arnett's estimation is a similar 15% to
25%.</p>
<p>While being accepted as a preferred risk clearly makes an
insurance buyer feel good, some people can be misled by the
designation, says Lawrence E. Worthey, chief underwriter for
Midland Mutual. Some companies' preferred rates are no lower
than some other insurers' standard charges, he says. Yet
buyers usually opt for the policies labeled preferred.</p>
<p>"What's the difference?" he asks. "The buyer does not want
to be considered not preferred."</p>
<p>There are other ways as well that distinctions between
preferred and standard status can trip up unsuspecting
insurance buyers.</p>
<p>For instance, Peter C. Katt, a West Bloomfield, Mich.,
insurance adviser, encountered an unusual situation in which
an insurance agent had a financial incentive not to propose
preferred coverage to people who might qualify. The insurance
involved: the Preferred Ultimate One and regular Ultimate One
whole-life policies from Jackson National Life Insurance Co.
of Lansing, Mich.</p>
<p>Unlike most companies, Jackson National has some policies
that are only for "preferred" risks and other, similar
products that are written on a standard basis. In the case of
the Ultimate One contracts, an agent gets twice as high a
commission for selling the standard product.</p>
<p>Mr. Katt suspects that's why a law-firm client of his was
not offered the preferred contract by a previous agent. The
two policies "exist side by side so the agents can choose the
level of commission they want to earn on a particular case,"
he charges. Mr. Katt's client couldn't be reached.</p>
<p>William A. Gray, a Jackson National vice president, says
he can't comment on the specific case. But the Jackson
National official also explains that the commission
"necessarily had to come down" from the level in the standard
product in order to offer very competitive rates to preferred
risks.</p>
<p>"Clearly a person who can qualify for a preferred-risk
product ought to buy it when it's available," Mr. Gray says.
He says he believes agents rarely propose the standard policy
to someone who might qualify as preferred -- but also says
that there is no mechanism for Jackson National to intervene
if they do. "We can only issue a policy based on what is
applied for," he says.</p>
<p>For people who don't qualify for preferred status at a
given company, the best advice may be to check the rates at
companies that don't make a preferred-standard distinction.
Their standard rates may be lower because they are based on a
diversified population, not just applicants who have failed
the preferred test.</p>
<p>Mr. Bernstein, president of Assured Enterprises Ltd.,
recently worked with a 37-year-old smoker who was seeking a
$1 million term policy with a level premium for the first
five years. The man applied for one company's preferred
coverage at $1,720 a year; he was rejected and offered
standard coverage at $2,320. He ended up paying $2,060 to a
company that doesn't segment its smoker class.</p>
<p>Mr. Bernstein often recommends that clients apply to two
or more insurers at once or sequentially -- something they
can usually do without multiple physical exams or blood
tests, he notes.</p>
