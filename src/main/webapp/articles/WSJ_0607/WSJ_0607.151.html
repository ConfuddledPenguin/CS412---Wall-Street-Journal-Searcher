	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Whittaker Corp. posted a 49% increase in
fiscal second-quarter net income to $75.1 million, or $9.06
cents a share, swollen by a $80.5 million nonrecurring gain
that more than offset a loss from continuing operations.
   The one-time gain, equal to $9.71 a share, was related to
discontinued operations. In the year-ago quarter, Whittaker
had restated net income of $12.6 million, or $1.75 a share,
including a gain from discontinued operations of $5.1
million, or 72 cents a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The loss from continuing operations was $3.3 million, or
40 cents a share, compared with year-ago restated income from
continuing operations of $3.2 million, or 43 cents a share.</p>
<p>Sales climbed 12%, to $51.2 million, from $45.5 million.
Whittaker said that its year-ago figures were restated to
reflect the sale in March of the company's special chemicals
segment, and the reinstatement to continuing operations of
two businesses in its aerospace segment. Whittaker's
continuing operations are now in aerospace and biotechnology.</p>
<p>The company blamed the sharp declines in income mainly on
increased expense related to its recapitalization last June.
The quarter also was negatively impacted by a $4.3 million
net charge, equal to 52 cents a share, for the write-off of
certain unamortized loan costs related to financing of the
recapitalization plan.</p>
<p>Whittaker borrowed $360 million from a $432.5 million
credit facility for the recapitalization after rejecting a
takeover bid from a closely held investment concern in
December 1988. Earlier this week, Whittaker replaced the
facility with a new $140 million facility from a group led by
Security Pacific National Bank. Of the $140 million,
Whittaker said it has borrowed $47 million.</p>
