	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A big Wall Street firm found a way to profit
from the upheaval in Eastern Europe.
   Salomon Brothers Inc. was picked by the U.S. Overseas
Private Investment Corp. to be financial adviser to OPIC's
fledgling Eastern European Growth Fund.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The securities firm, a Salomon Inc. unit, beat out nine
other investment banks to get the job.</p>
<p>The fund expects to raise $200 million from investors in a
private placement. Its launch represents an unusual step by
OPIC, a U.S. government agency that insures companies
investing overseas against political risk.</p>
<p>The fund can invest only in three countries where OPIC has
a mandate: Hungary, Poland and Yugoslavia. The agency is
holding negotiations with Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>The fund is seeking to attract large investors, such as
pension funds and insurance companies, in the next few
months; $50 million of its assets will be backed by OPIC
guarantees.</p>
<p>Under the Bush administration, OPIC has become more of a
U.S. foreign policy tool. The agency provides investment
data, financing and risk assurances -- usually for big
institutional investors -- in 116 countries in Latin America,
Europe, Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>Because the new fund will be structured as a limited
partnership, it won't be actively traded. The investment will
have a 15-year life, and investors can't get their money out
until at least four years have passed, Salomon said.</p>
<p>The fund is likely to invest in serviceoriented companies,
such as communications and environmental concerns, said
Michael Holland, chairman of the fund and head of Salomon
Asset Management Inc. Mr. Holland said he expects the fund to
be able to invest in many more countries during its life.</p>
<p>Salomon isn't saying what its fee will be for advising the
project, except to say that its financial reward will be
based on how well the fund performs.</p>
<p>The Eastern European Growth Fund isn't the first fund
venture for OPIC. The agency has launched an African Growth
Fund for development in Sub-Sahara West Africa, run by
Equator Bank, Hartford, Conn. The African fund, which seeks
to raise $20 million, hasn't raised all the money, OPIC said.</p>
