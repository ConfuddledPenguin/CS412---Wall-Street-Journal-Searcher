	<p class="article-leader">FRANKFURT, West Germany -- Although the final cost of
unity is still an open book, West Germany's aim to help
finance German unification with economic growth is taking on
credibility.
   West Germany's statistics office announced that the
country's gross national product grew by an
inflation-adjusted and seasonally-adjusted 2.5% in the first
quarter from the preceding period. The measure of output of
goods and services was up a real 4.4% from the first quarter
of 1989 after adjustments for inflation, raising prospects
for bigger tax flows.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At the same time, however, news from East Germany worsened
with a report that unemployment had almost tripled in just
two months, depicting a rapidly unraveling East German
industry structure.</p>
<p>East Germany's minister for labor and social affairs,
Regine Hildebrandt, said this week that unemployment had
jumped to just over 100,000 by the end of May from 65,000 in
April and 35,000 in March.</p>
<p>On the brighter side of the wall, economists predict that
West Germany's first-quarter business expansion can be
sustained for the full year as domestic industry continues
boosting production and expanding capacity to rebuild East
German industry and integrate the two economies. Scores of
West German firms already are shifting resources into East
Germany for access to eastern markets, though the full force
of West German capital won't begin to be felt until after
monetary and economic union on July 1.</p>
<p>Continuing to break from its former reliance on export
trade for growth, Europe's largest economy again imported
more goods in the first quarter than it sold abroad,
reflecting a rising dependence on foreign industries to help
overcome emerging capacity bottlenecks at home. First-quarter
imports rose 12.7% in a year, compared with a 10.2% rise in
exports.</p>
<p>Another warm winter boosted West German construction
activity 7.4% from a year ago. West German companies
accelerated expenditures on the modernization and expansion
of production facilities, reflected in an inflation-adjusted
15.9% jump in capital spending from the first period of last
year. Private consumption rose by 4% over the same span,
bolstered by income tax cuts in January and the nearly one
million immigrants arriving from Eastern Europe since early
last year.</p>
<p>Booming domestic business activity has accommodated many
of the new arrivals. Some 552,000 jobs have been created over
the past year, helping to reduce West Germany's jobless rate
in May to 7% from 7.3% in April, the government's labor
agency said yesterday. The unemployment measure was West
Germany's lowest since June 1982, when 6.8% of the work force
was without jobs.</p>
<p>Bonn expects to rake in 8.2 billion marks ($4.86 billion)
more in 1990 tax revenue than originally planned. But the
windfall could be quickly forgotten next year if Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's government sticks to its promise to introduce a
25 billion mark corporate tax relief in January.</p>
<p>"The economy is performing beyond most expectations and
clearly will boost tax revenue," said Hermann Remsperger,
chief economist for Berliner Handels & Frankfurter Bank. "But
the question is whether spending growth can be held in check,
whether current tax structures stay intact."</p>
<p>West German inflation, running at a mere 2.3% annual rate
in May, could begin climbing toward 4% and beyond by next
year after the mark becomes East Germany's official currency
in July, adding more than 100 billion marks to the
Bundesbank's money supply.</p>
