	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Senate Agriculture Committee voted to
ban the export of unsafe pesticides.
   The move was an effort to protect U.S. consumers who eat
imported foods from the so-called circle of poison. A
loophole in current law allows U.S. agrichemical companies to
export pesticides even if they aren't registered for farm use
or aren't tolerated on foods in this country. Illegal
residues of these pesticides, including some suspected
carcinogens, often are found in imported fruits and
vegetables as well as some beef and dairy products.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"If the Environmental Protection Agency says a pesticide
is too unsafe to be used on American-grown food, then it is
too unsafe to be used on foreign-grown food," asserted Sen.
Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.), the committee chairman.</p>
<p>The panel adopted the legislation, part of the 1990 farm
bill, by voice vote despite the objections of the National
Agricultural Chemicals Association, a trade group comprising
pesticide manufacturers whose export sales totaled $2.2
billion last year. The group warned that the bill, among
other things, could impede trade in agricultural products and
force companies to move plants overseas, eliminating jobs in
the U.S.</p>
<p>The Senate committee's vote was expected to spur House
action on an identical measure sponsored by Reps. Leon
Panetta (D., Calif.), Dan Glickman (D., Kan.) and Mike Synar
(D., Okla.). Rep. Synar already has held hearings on the
circle-of-poison issue.</p>
<p>The U.S. imports 33 billion pounds of fruits and
vegetables a year, roughly one-quarter of its total
consumption. The Food and Drug Administration inspects only a
tiny fraction of the imports, but government inspectors have
found about 5% to be tainted with pesticides. Recent FDA
sampling showed 10% of imported peas and 8% of imported pears
contained illegal residues, while U.S.-grown peas and pears
contained none.</p>
<p>Besides barring exports of unsafe pesticides, the Senate
legislation would prohibit imports of any food tainted with
pesticides that are banned in the U.S. It also would revoke
residue tolerances that remain on the books for such
pesticides. This provision would put U.S. farmers on the same
competitive footing as foreign growers, who currently can use
certain effective pesticides that aren't registered for use
on U.S. farms.</p>
<p>"The point of this legislation is to eliminate the double
standard in pesticide policy," said William McNichol, a
director of a consumer group fighting what it considers
pesticide misuse. The bill, if enacted, would be first
substantial change in pesticide law since 1978.</p>
<p>Among other things, the bill would require U.S.
manufacturers to obtain prior consent from foreign countries
before shipping potentially hazardous pesticides across their
borders. And it would require safety instructions on
pesticide labels to be written in the language of the
importing country.</p>
<p>To help the FDA screen imports, the measure would require
U.S. importers to list the pesticides generally used on
imported foods. The bill has 25 co-sponsors in the Senate.</p>
