	<p class="article-leader">Reed International PLC, a British publishing company, said
pretax profit for the year ended March 31 rose 11% to #302
million ($509.3 million) from #271 million a year earlier, at
the top of market expectations and boosted by strong results
in the enlarged U.S. business publishing unit.
   Sales edged up 1.5% to #1.58 billion from #1.55 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Increases of 11% also were posted in profit after taxes
and minority interests to #211.3 million from #189.7 million,
and earnings per share to 38.2 pence from 34.5 pence. Net
profit attributable to shareholders fell 55% to #211 million
from #498 million; the year-earlier figure was boosted by an
extraordinary gain of #308.4 million largely from the sale of
a business.</p>
<p>In the U.S., where, among other acquisitions last year,
Reed in November paid $303.7 million to buy the legal
publisher Martindale-Hubbell Inc., operating profit on
business publishing soared 76% to #80.2 million, and sales
increased 45% to #464 million.</p>
