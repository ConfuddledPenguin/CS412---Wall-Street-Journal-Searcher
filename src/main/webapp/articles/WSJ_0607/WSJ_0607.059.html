	<div class="article-body"><p>Du Pont Co. -- $1.85 billion redemption amount of
zero-coupon convertible subordinated notes due June 14, 2010,
priced at $218.55 for each $1,000 note for a yield to
maturity of 7.75%. The size of the issue was increased from
an originally planned $1.1 billion. The notes can be put back
to the company in the fifth, 10th and 15th years for cash,
common or subordinated repayment notes, at Du Pont's option.
The notes are convertible into common at $47.375 a share,
representing a 19.56% premium over yesterday's closing price.
Rated double-A-3 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and
double-A-minus by Standard & Poor's Corp., the issue will be
sold through First Boston Corp.</p>
<p>Georgia-Pacific Corp. -- $600 million of credit-sensitive
notes in a two-part offering priced through underwriters led
by Bear Stearns & Co. The first part, $300 million of 10%
notes due June 15, 1997, was priced at par. The non-callable
notes were priced at a spread of 150 basis points above the
Treasury's seven-year note. The second part, $300 million of
10.10% notes due June 15, 2002, was priced at 99.937 to yield
10.109%. The non-callable notes were priced at 165 basis
points above the Treasury's 10-year note. The notes are
called credit-sensitive because the coupon on the securities
will be adjusted upward in case of a credit rating downgrade
and downward in the event of a rating upgrade. The issue is
rated Baa-3 by Moody's and double-B-plus by S&P.</p>
<p>Southern California Edison Co. -- $200 million of 9 1/4%
first and refunding mortgage bonds due June 15, 2021, via a
group led by Salomon Brothers Inc., to be reoffered at 95.919
to yield 9.67%. The bonds, which are non-callable for five
years, were priced at 123 basis points above the Treasury's
30-year bond. The issue is rated double-A-2 by Moody's and
double-A by S&P.</p>
<p>Staples Inc. -- $70 million of 7% convertible subordinated
debentures due June 1, 2015. The debentures are priced at par

<p>                     MORTGAGES</p>
<p>Federal National Mortgage Association -- $300.1 million of
Remic mortgage securities offered in 13 classes by Shearson
Lehman Hutton. The offering, Series 1990-76, is backed by
Fannie Mae 9 1/2% securities with a weighted average coupon
rate of 10.20% and weighted average remaining term to
maturity of 29.50 years. Price and yield data weren't
immediately available.</p>
<p>Federal National Mortgage Association -- $300 million of
Remic mortgage securities offered in 11 classes by Goldman
Sachs & Co. The offering, Series 1990-77, is backed by new
stripped mortgage securities formed from Fannie Mae 10 1/2%
securities. Goldman Sachs took all the principal-only strips
from the new strips trust, 79-CL, and most of the
interest-only strips from the trust and used them as
collateral. The use of a portion of the interest-only strips
effectively lowered the coupon rate on the collateral. The
remaining interest-only strips not pledged to the Remic were
sold separately. Price and yield details weren't provided.
There is a weighted average coupon rate of 11.11% and a
weighted average term to maturity of 28.5 years.</p>
