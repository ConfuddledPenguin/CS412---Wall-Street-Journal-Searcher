	<p class="article-leader">A federal judge excoriated two lawyers who filed thousands
of asbestos-related claims, saying greed motivated them to
solicit and pursue many cases that apparently were
groundless.
   The two California lawyers, Gordon A. Stemple and Richard
F. Gerry, represented 6,000 asbestos claimants against
Raymark Industries Inc., an asbestos maker that paid $16
million to tire workers nationwide for injuries claimed by
Messrs. Stemple and Gerry. The company then sued the two
lawyers in 1987 challenging the validity of the claims and
alleging fraud and racketeering.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In response to a pretrial motion seeking dismissal of the
suit, Judge Patrick F. Kelly, of Wichita, Kan., answered with
a scalding 63-page opinion. He accused the two lawyers -- and
three doctors they employed to evaluate the claims -- of
fraud, deceptive solicitation and "reckless disregard of the
truth."</p>
<p>"It appears that this unusual, distasteful and
disappointing case emanates from the attorneys' greed, which
has clouded their professional judgment; i.e., their
indifference as to whether any of the 6,000 claims meet
professional standards or not," Judge Kelly wrote.</p>
<p>Messrs. Stemple and Gerry formed the National Tire Workers
Litigation Project in 1986, equipped vans with X-ray machines
and traveled to Raymark tire plants across the country in the
"examobiles" to conduct massive employee examinations. In his
order, the judge called the technique an "unethical
nationwide solicitation process" and charged that the three
doctors involved compromised their professional
responsibility by using flawed screening procedures to churn
groundless claims.</p>
<p>"There is evidence in this case which indicates that
{Messrs.} Stemple and Gerry violated ethical obligations by
conducting a contrived and deceptive solicitation program,"
the judge wrote.</p>
<p>Reached at his office in Century City, Calif., Mr. Stemple
said he disagreed with the opinion and predicted that he, Mr.
Gerry and the three doctors will prevail when the case goes
before a jury. Mr. Gerry, of San Diego, was out of town and
couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Raymark was a unit of Raytech Corp., a Bridgeport, Conn.,
maker of fastners and brake and clutch materials, that
stripped the company of its non-asbestos-related assets and
spun it off in 1988 to distance itself from asbestos
litigation. Raymark has been forced into bankruptcy-court
proceedings under the weight of more than 68,000
asbestos-related claims. Last year, Raytech sought
bankruptcy-court protection.</p>
<p>The company has been known for particularly aggressive
litigation tactics, said Mr. Stemple, pointing to the suit
against him as the most recent example. But Raymark lawyer
William L. Myers Jr., of the Philadelphia firm of Ballard,
Spahr, Andrews & Ingersoll, said Judge Kelly's opinion was a
"timely expression of judicial disapproval of mass-produced
lawsuits."</p>

<p>STUDENT-LOAN INQUIRY leads to indictment of ex-official at
Florida thrift.</p>
<p>A federal grand jury in Tampa, Fla., returned a 25-count
indictment against Jeffrey A. Flatten, charging that he
conspired to defraud the U.S. Department of Education in
connection with its Guaranteed Student Loan Program. The
program makes low-interest loans available to students for
college expenses.</p>
<p>Mr. Flatten, who headed Florida Federal Savings Bank's
student-loan division, was also charged with committing mail
fraud and stealing government funds.</p>
<p>The indictment follows Florida Federal's conviction by the
federal jury for falsifying statements related to
government-backed student loans. Last month, in what is
believed to be the largest student-loan case ever prosecuted,
the federal jury found the company guilty of 43 counts of
falsifying statements between November 1986 and July 1987.
Two former officers were convicted of falsifying statements.</p>
<p>In 1988, Florida Federal came under scrutiny for allegedly
filing as many as 17,000 fraudulent insurance claims on $35
million in student loans. The investigation helped spark a
management shake-up that resulted in the resignation of the
thrift's chairman.</p>
<p>The indictment against Mr. Flatten alleges that from
November 1986 to September 1987 he conspired with other
officers and employees of Florida Federal to submit the
17,000 fraudulent claims. Those claims, the indictment says,
were supported by documents falsely reflecting that Florida
Federal performed required collection activity on the loans.</p>
<p>In St. Petersburg, Fla., Florida Federal officials hadn't
any comment. Mr. Flatten couldn't be reached.</p>

<p>METROMEDIA WINS damages of $46 million in fraud suit.</p>
<p>Metromedia Co. sued William D. Fugazy in 1987 for
allegedly fraudulently overstating the value of Fugazy
Express Inc., a limousine service that Metromedia acquired in
1985. Fugazy Express, which Metromedia owned for two years,
is in bankruptcy-law proceedings.</p>
<p>In the civil-racketeering suit, Metromedia claimed Mr.
Fugazy overstated the value of the company by $7 million,
said Martin Shelton, an attorney for the Secaucus, N.J.,
communications company. Mr. Shelton said Metromedia,
controlled by billionaire John Kluge, had to invest an
additional $30 million in the company because of the alleged
misrepresentations.</p>
<p>The jury hearing the case in federal court in Manhattan,
N.Y., awarded damages of $15 million, which Judge Robert
Carter trebled under racketeering law.</p>
<p>Anthony Princi, an attorney for Mr. Fugazy, plans to
appeal the decision.</p>

<p>FEES MOUNT in Southmark Corp. bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
<p>Lawyers alone are seeking more than $8.7 million in fees
in the reorganization of the real-estate and thrift concern.
Investment bankers and accountants aren't far behind with fee
requests totaling $7.7 million, bringing the total
professional fees to $16.5 million up to March 31.</p>
<p>"That is a big chunk of assets out of this estate that
would otherwise be available to pay creditors," U.S. Trustee
George McElreath said during a hearing on the fees before
Dallas Bankruptcy Judge Steven Felsenthal.</p>
<p>Southmark has proposed paying its creditors about $300
million in cash, notes and stock to settle debts of $2
billion. The company's counsel alone are seeking almost $6.5
million in fees, with the largest single amount, $3.4
million, to go to the New York law firm of Shearman &
Sterling. Judge Felsenthal took the fee applications under
consideration.</p>
<p>In his comments to Judge Felsenthal, Mr. McElreath cited
another Dallas bankruptcy judge who frequently criticizes
lawyers' high fees by saying they're "buying a Cadillac when
they could buy a Ford."</p>
<p>"In this case," Mr. McElreath said, "we're paying for an
Indy race car."</p>

<p>ARNOLD & PORTER will market services with defense
consultant.</p>
<p>The Washington, D.C., law firm entered a "teaming
agreement" with Interpar, a new defense-consulting firm that
will specialize in accords between foreign governments and
companies to market arms to more than one country. The
venture is aimed at helping the defense and aerospace
industries adjust to the decline in defense budgets here and
abroad as the Cold War winds down.</p>
<p>In recent years, Arnold & Porter has launched several
subsidiaries that perform non-legal work, including the
consulting firm Apco Associates. But according to Arnold &
Porter partner Jeffrey H. Smith, a former general counsel to
the Senate Armed Services Committee, Interpar isn't an Arnold
& Porter subsidiary, and has no financial links to the law
firm. Interpar Chairman Milton Lohr and President Vitalij
Garber are former high-ranking defense officials in the
Reagan and Carter administrations.</p>
<p>Under the "teaming agreement," lawyers for Arnold & Porter
will make joint presentations with Interpar to potential
clients. The two firms will also notify their own clients
that the firms are available to work together, although
clients will be required to hire the concerns separately.
According to Mr. Smith, the company determined that separate
transactions are required by the legal canons of ethics.</p>
<p>Separately, a top Arnold & Porter trade litigator, Patrick
Macrory, will leave the firm for the Washington office of
Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld.</p>
<p>According to Akin Gump Managing Partner Bruce McLean, Mr.
Macrory will be working on trade matters in the firm's
Washington office and also in a new 25-lawyer Brussels office
that the firm opened last year.</p>

<p>FDIC SUES LAWYERS: The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is
seeking $30 million in damages from three Texas lawyers who
advised the defunct Western Savings Association of Dallas to
make a series of loans that allegedly violated federal
regulations. Named in the suit, filed in Dallas federal
court, are Waco lawyers Michael J. Vaughn and Donald B. Lynn
and Austin lawyer A. Rick Hightower. Mr. Lynn said, "It's our
position that the whole case is without merit, and we are
going to litigate it."</p>
