	<p class="article-leader">Federal Express Corp., the air-express carrier, was stung
yesterday with lower ratings on about $1 billion of long-term
debt.
   Moody's Investors Service Inc., which made the downgrades,
cited the more difficult than expected merger with Tiger
International Corp., and Moody's belief that cash flow
measurements, among other things, will remained constrained
"over the intermediate term."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts said they weren't surprised by the downgrades,
which largely reflect the company's well-publicized problems.
Late last month, Federal reported a sharp and unexpected drop
in April shipment growth, an announcement that sparked a 10%
tumble in the company's stock price.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Federal's common closed at $48.25, down 25 cents.</p>
<p>The rating cut isn't "market moving" news, said Kevin
Murphy, an airline analyst with Morgan Stanley & Co. "Federal
is in the black and paying the bills, but there's no
visibility to earnings momentum," he said. He called the
rating analysis "rational and well done."</p>
<p>Moody's said it cut the ratings on Federal's senior notes
and industrial revenue bonds to Baa-2 from Baa-1. It also
lowered the rating on Tiger's convertible subordinated
debentures to Baa-3 from Baa-2. The ratings for Flying Tiger
Line Inc.'s industrial revenue bonds ratings were downgraded
to Baa-1 from A3.</p>
<p>In Memphis, Tenn., Federal declined to comment.</p>
