	<p class="article-leader">Ground Crew Sometimes
   Grounds a Flight</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>MODERN jetliners fly through thunderstorms, blizzards and
hail, but often it's the most mundane problems that ground
flights.</p>
<p>Mishaps on the runway are often the most troublesome. They
range from a driver ramming a baggage cart into the side of a
plane to a handler thrusting baggage containers so hard that
they dent the cargo bin. Because planes aren't supposed to
fly with even the smallest damage, they must be repaired
immediately.</p>
<p>"The catering truck might slam into the catering door. The
wing tip can catch on the gate area. Anything that can happen
will happen," says William Reed, acting assistant manager of
the Federal Aviation Administration's aircraft maintenance
division. "It could be a delay from several minutes to a
cancellation."</p>
<p>The problem had become such a big one at Pan American
World Airways that the carrier started giving its operations
employees bonuses if damage incidents decrease on a monthly
basis.</p>
<p>In an internal memo in December, Robert L. Gould, senior
vice president of operations at the Pan Am Corp. unit, said:
"Ground damage is killing us."</p>
<p>Systemwide incidents ballooned 2 1/2 times to 295 in 1989
from 120 in 1986, according to the memo. Repair bills were
"unbelievable," it said. Another repercussion: loss of
customer good will. Fleet-service employees were warned to
slow down and to stop driving underneath planes.</p>
<p>From Jan. 1 to May 31, Pan Am says, ground-damage
incidents have dropped 30% from a year earlier.</p>
<p>Fliers are mostly kept in the dark about such incidents;
the Transportation Department's monthly reports on
cancellations and delays don't include schedule glitches due
to "mechanical problems." In fact, a carrier with such delays
could still appear among the top carriers on the department's
on-time list.

<p>Hints on Tipping</p>
<p>Doormen at Curbs</p>
<p>AT THE FOUR Seasons Hotel in Chicago, Horand M. Vogel
whisked by a doorman holding open a cab door. Did the
well-heeled consultant misstep by not tipping the doorman?</p>
<p>"Absolutely not," says Mr. Vogel. "Going in and out of
taxis isn't a tip-worthy affair." Or is it?</p>
<p>There are etiquette rules that dictate how to tip waiters,
cabbies, bartenders and bellmen but none for the men -- and a
few women -- working at curbside. (They aren't the ones
carrying luggage to rooms.) Most depend on tips. In one
union, their salary is just $29 a day.</p>
<p>Here are suggestions from Elizabeth L. Post,
granddaughter-in-law of Emily Post and author of etiquette
books.</p>
<p>Her tips: If doormen hail a waiting cab in good weather,
no tip; in bad weather and they get wet, $1. If they have to
scare up a cab in good weather, $1. If they carry a couple of
bags to the lobby, $1; to the curb, no tip. In big cities
such as New York or Chicago, $1 is the norm; in smaller
cities, 50 cents will do.</p>
<p>Never tip more than $1 for anything from keeping an eye on
a bag to holding an umbrella for you in rainy weather. The
exception is a $2 tip at the end of a visit in which you've
tipped zilch. "Is it confusing?" says Mrs. Post. "Yes, oh,
certainly."</p>
<p>As for Mr. Vogel, he didn't err, says Mrs. Post.</p>
<p>Kids-Fly-Free Gimmick</p>
<p>Is Unlikely This Summer</p>
<p>DON'T EXPECT an encore of last year's kids-fly-free
promotion.</p>
<p>Last summer, a kid could fly free or for a nominal $1 when
traveling with an adult. Families saved hundreds of dollars
on vacation costs. The gimmick was so hot that airlines
blamed it for trashing third-quarter revenue.</p>
<p>It's probably too late now for similar hoopla to start
this year.</p>
<p>Texas Air Corp.'s Continental Airlines unit was the first
to make the pitch last year, announcing its promotion in
April. Most of the industry had matched it begrudgingly by
the first of May.</p>
<p>Continental says it's not going to give away seats this
year. "We don't feel the need to do the kids-fly-free," says
John Nelson, executive vice president of marketing at
Continental. The big reasons, he says: Continental's market
share nationally has improved "dramatically" since a year
ago, and vacation fares are cheaper than last year. "New York
to Florida fares were $129 last year. This year, they're $89.
When you look at $129 vs. $89, the $89" oneway fare generates
enough traffic, he says.</p>
<p>One of the few deals for kids this summer is the
restricted $29 and $39 one-way fares being offered by some
airlines on flights from the Northeast to Florida.</p>
<p>But airlines cringe at the idea of introducing a
children's freebie. Says Randall Mailen, USAir Group Inc.'s
executive vice president of marketing: "We will not initiate
the program."</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>CONSIDER the query Northwest Airlines Chairman Alfred
Checchi faced: Would he fire an employee who posed nude in
Playboy? In a letter to a flight attendant considering such a
move, Mr. Checchi said the woman wouldn't be fired so long as
Northwest wasn't named and she kept "company standards" on
the job. He added: "A company should stand for something --
have values. . . . You owe it to all of us to consider the
possible effect on our efforts if one of our people poses in
Playboy." The flight attendant isn't posing, for now. . . .
People registering travel agents at the International Travel
Industry Expo earlier this spring got a memo from organizers
warning that "although 99% of these people are educated
adults, they will probably act like three-year-olds."</p>
