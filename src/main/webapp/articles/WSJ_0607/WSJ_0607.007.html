	<p class="article-leader">PUERTO CORTES, Honduras -- In Nicaragua, the Contras are
handing in their weapons. In El Salvador, guerrillas are
talking peace. But in this usually placid tropical port, war
has broken out.
   A banana war.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>On one side is the Honduran subsidiary of the U.S. company
Chiquita Brands International Inc. -- formerly United Brands
Co., earlier United Fruit Co. On the other is an upstart
ex-subsidiary of Chiquita's, Fyffes Group Ltd., now owned by
the big Irish-British fruit importer Fyffes PLC. Fyffes
precipitated hostilities this year by ordering bananas from a
grower that Chiquita says has an ironclad contract to supply
Chiquita.</p>
<p>The outside world's appetite for bananas is strong, and
demand will grow with Europe's economic integration and
Eastern Europe's developing ability to import. But the supply
of green gold, so-called by banana men because it is cut and
shipped green, is limited. It greatly disturbs Chiquita that
a major supplier has defected to Fyffes. Chiquita says it
will enforce compliance with its contract, but strictly by
legal and ethical means.</p>
<p>"We can't afford to let Fyffes get that fruit," says
Manuel Rodriguez, a Chiquita vice president wearing a
guayabera in his temporary office in the old company town of
La Lima. Fyffes Chairman Neil McCann counters: "We will stay
here as long as necessary."</p>
<p>In Honduras, Chiquita's 80 or 90 other independent growers
are following the war with great interest. The independents
account for nearly one-third of the 34 million boxes of
bananas Chiquita shipped from Honduras last year. "This is
{Chiquita's} biggest and best division," says Laurence Swan,
a Fyffes marketing executive. "Lose it here, and that's it."
Independent banana growers in Ecuador, Panama, Costa Rica and
Colombia would love to see more competition from buyers and
are watching the fight, too. "If people realize Fyffes can
induce producers to break contracts, then everybody will do
it," says Chiquita's Mr. Rodriguez.</p>
<p>"It's the most serious threat the U.S. banana companies
have had to their privileged position, perhaps since the
beginning of the century," says Mark Rosenberg, a Honduras
expert at Florida International University.</p>
<p>For the moment, Chiquita -- whose United Fruit predecessor
was called "the Octopus" by Hondurans -- has prevailed. El
Tiempo, Honduras's most influential newspaper, has
editorialized acidly that the "banana republic system" is
alive and well in Honduras, if nowhere else. The main
casualties of the war have been bananas. Chiquita has
obtained a court order that has empowered officials to
confiscate about 300,000 boxes of Fyffes-bound bananas, worth
about $3.6 million abroad.</p>
<p>Some of the seized fruit has been pilfered and some has
spoiled. Most has been sold for small change in Honduras,
where the demand for bananas is not exactly insatiable. This
strikes Fyffes partisans as tragic. "As a professional banana
man, I'm appalled," says Tim Stickney, a Fyffes agricultural
specialist in Belize.</p>
<p>At the heart of the war is a contract dispute between
Chiquita and the Echeverri family, Honduras's largest
independent banana growers. Chiquita accuses Fyffes of paying
the Echeverris $2.5 million to break their company's
long-term contract with Chiquita in order to sell to Fyffes,
which offers higher prices -- and pays in dollars, rather
than the shaky Honduran lempira.</p>
<p>The Echeverris assert that the contract has expired and
that, in any case, Chiquita itself had violated certain
provisions, thereby voiding it. Fyffes says that the
Echeverris are free to sell to whom they please and that it
has done nothing wrong.</p>
<p>One Honduran judge has ruled for Chiquita. In a different
legal action, another judge has ruled that the Echeverris can
sell their fruit to Fyffes. Chiquita's judge, however, seems
to have more muscle.</p>
<p>Through legal maneuvering -- and, Chiquita men say, the
intimidating presence of hundreds of banana workers at the
port -- Fyffes and the Echeverris were able to ship three
boatloads of bananas from Puerto Cortes in early spring.
Since May 11, however, a Fyffes freighter, the Frost Cetus,
has bobbed fruitlessly at the harbor, at a cost of $5,000 a
day.</p>
<p>Court officials, accompanied at times by soldiers in
combat gear, have confiscated truckload after truckload of
fruit. Chiquita's Mr. Rodriguez says that the Honduran
government and military, initially confused by the legal
maneuvering, now are fully aware of Chiquita's superior legal
position.</p>
<p>In March and April, court officials supervised the
unloading of more than 2,000 tons of bananas from two vessels
chartered to Fyffes by Seatrade Groningen B.V., a Dutch
concern. In one instance, the ship company says, the captain
reported that his ship was unloaded at gunpoint -- although a
judge on the scene denied in an affidavit that any force was
used. More recently, three trainloads and 68 truckloads of
green gold were confiscated. On the way to port, one
fruit-laden train was derailed when its locomotive, crewmen
said, hit a railroad spike that someone had jammed into the
space between two lengths of rail. At a press conference two
days later, lawyers for Chiquita's subsidiary denied any
responsibility for the incident.</p>
<p>On a recent night at the port, a police lieutenant,
toothpick firmly planted in his jaw, orders the confiscation
of three truckloads bound for the Frost Cetus. A woman in a
flaming pink dress, Marta Moran, who is a lawyer for the
Echeverris, suddenly appears on the scene and waves a court
paper in the officer's face. "Show me your order]" she barks.
"My paper against your paper]"</p>
<p>Sullen stevedores press in on the lieutenant and his four
men, who carry rifles. "Load the bananas]" one of the dock
workers shouts. "I have four cubs at home who have to eat."</p>
<p>The police retreat, but the Fyffes-Echeverri victory is
short-lived. The judge on Chiquita's side has been found
partying at Studio 54, a discotheque, and again approves
seizure of the bananas. The lieutenant returns to the dock
with a court order -- and a dozen soldiers in battle gear.
The three truckloads of bananas are impounded.</p>
<p>In another recent incident, witnesses say, police with
automatic rifles, accompanied by at least two Chiquita
employees and a Chiquita lawyer who is an alternate member of
the Honduran supreme court, burst into a hotel here. They
sought to detain for questioning a Fyffes official and the
Fyffes agent who arranged the Echeverri agreement.</p>
<p>Confronted by the hotel manager, the raiding party was
unable to produce proper warrants. The Fyffes men had escaped
anyway; one had ducked out a back entrance. But a visiting
Fyffes director who resembled one of the wanted men was
almost arrested, witnesses say. Chiquita says its lawyer was
there to identify the Fyffes men, for whom there were valid
arrest warrants.</p>
<p>Some Fyffes officials now travel with bodyguards and mask
their identities. Two executives carry 90,000-volt stun guns
bought in Miami. "I'll take one {captor} with me, if need
be," one jokes nervously.</p>
<p>Peace talks have begun. Last week, about eight security
guards from both sides waited in the lobby of a hotel in San
Pedro Sula, their guns discreetly hidden from view, as
lawyers from Chiquita and Fyffes held what a Fyffes man
called a "tense" three-hour meeting. Both sides pledged to
seek ground on which to resolve their dispute.</p>
<p>There are diplomatic pressures to do so. The two sides met
this week after gentle prodding from the American and British
ambassadors here; they had responded to a request from the
president of Honduras. Ireland, the home of Fyffes PLC, has
no representation here. But the Fyffes Group subsidiary is
headquartered in London. The British ambassador to Honduras
is Peter Streams, a heavyset, cigar-smoking diplomat given to
wearing pale-pink safari outfits on his visits to Puerto
Cortes. He says he has "expressed concern" over the dispute
many times to the Honduran government.</p>
<p>Also on the diplomatic front, Fyffes offcials have met
with officials of the European Community in Brussels.
Chiquita officials, Mr. Streams says, have explained their
position to the British Foreign Office in London. U.S.
Ambassador Cresencio Arcos says the dispute has become a
"loselose" situation for Honduras, with total victory by one
side or another damaging the nation's reputation either in
the U.S. or in Europe. He is counseling the antagonists to
reach a "mutually acceptable agreement."</p>
<p>As a Chiquita subsidiary, Fyffes Group had acquired most
of its bananas from former British colonies -- Belize,
Jamaica, the Windward Islands -- and from Surinam, and sold
them in the British market. In 1986, FII PLC bought Fyffes
Group. As part of the deal, United Brands (now Chiquita) got
a minority interest in the new FII Fyffes (now Fyffes). Then,
last September, United Brands sold its interest in Fyffes.
"We didn't think it was a very valuable company," says a
Chiquita spokeswoman in Cincinnati.</p>
<p>Mr. Swan says Fyffes never meant to start a war with
Chiquita. But it needed an additional source of bananas, and
to enter Honduras -- next door to Belize, where Fyffes had
long sent ships -- "was a logical geographic decision," he
says.</p>
<p>Fyffes is the fifth-largest company whose shares are
traded on the Dublin stock exchange. But with total sales of
$600 million a year it is dwarfed by Chiquita, whose banana
sales alone last year were $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>If Chiquita has been winning the legal side of the war,
the affair has been a public-relations disaster. The
spectacle of Chiquita squashing a Honduran grower that had
managed to get better terms from Chiquita's much smaller
competitor has rekindled Hondurans' historical resentment of
"the Octopus." In the bad old days, Hondurans say, the
company "made and unmade presidents."</p>
<p>Some U.S. diplomats are irritated by all this. One says
that tactics of the Fyffes and the Echeverris have exploited
the negative side of the U.S. firm's history in Honduras and
"sparked a smear campaign."</p>
<p>As recently as 1974, during the last banana war (which was
set off by a fight for market share between United Brands and
Castle & Cooke Inc.'s Latin American subsidiary, Standard
Fruit Co.), United Brands paid $1.25 million to Honduran
government officials to lower a banana export tax. In 1975,
shortly before the bribes became public knowledge, United
Brands Chairman Eli Black committed suicide by jumping from
his New York office window. The Honduran government later
collapsed.</p>
<p>In the green fields and tin-roofed packing stations of the
Echeverri farm, the sympathies of sweat-drenched banana
workers clearly lie with Fyffes. Since the Echeverris began
dealing with Fyffes, wages have jumped, in some cases even
doubling to about $10 for a 12-hour day from $5. Sunday
overtime at double pay has become common. Fyffes accepts even
the smaller bananas at the bottom of a bunch, for which
Chiquita had no use.</p>
<p>"Chiquita threw away down from here," says Oscar Bonilla,
a lanky man with a mouthful of gold teeth, his hand halfway
down a strand of bananas hooked to a wire assembly line.
"With Fyffes, we use the whole strand. We pack more boxes, we
earn more money."</p>
<p>Workers say that for years, under the Chiquita contract,
the Echeverris were strapped for cash and couldn't meet some
of the obligations they had agreed to in labor negotiations.
(Chiquita says the farm has been badly run.) But if Fyffes's
money keeps flowing in, the workers expect more benefits,
including housing, that had been stalled earlier. "If we have
to go to the port 20 times, we will do it," vows Mr. Bonilla.
"If we have to load the fruit ourselves, we will do it. If we
have to fight, we will do it."</p>
<p>But in Puerto Cortes, Simon Templeman, Fyffes's bearded
shipping manager, sits slumped on the dock watching as
another truckload of confiscated bananas is driven away.
"This is what happens in a banana republic," he says
dejectedly. "The big guys win."</p>
