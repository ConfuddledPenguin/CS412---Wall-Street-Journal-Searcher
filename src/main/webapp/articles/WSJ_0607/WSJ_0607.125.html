	<p class="article-leader">The California Public Utilities Commission adopted a set
of rules for the mushrooming cellular-telephone business
designed to encourage price cuts and discourage rate
increases.
   The new regulations in California, the country's largest
cellular market, also protect resellers against
anti-competitive behavior by cellular companies. Resellers,
which are non-utility companies that buy cellular service at
wholesale prices and resell them to retail customers, have
expressed concerns that cellular companies undercut their
prices.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The commission decided that applications for rate
reductions -- as much as 10% at a time -- would be effective
as soon as they are filed. Increases, however, require formal
applications and a 30-day comment period before they go into
effect.</p>
<p>"The cellular-telephone market is an exciting and dynamic
new industry, but if we are to realize its full potential,
prices have to come down," said PUC President G. Mitchell
Wilk. The commission, however, defined cellular service as
"discretionary," and declined against a more rigid approach.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Pacific Telesis Group, the San
Francisco-based regional Bell company that provides cellular
service in much of California, said the company is "generally
satisfied with the PUC's decision." However, the company
would have liked more flexibility to raise prices, especially
since cellular systems will need to upgrade in the future to
meet growing capacity and convert to digital transmission,
she said.</p>
<p>Like California, many states have been adopting rules
designed to encourage competition in the cellular industry
and hold prices in check.</p>
<p>Separately, in a decision that could serve as a model for
other states, the commission adopted safeguards for consumers
using pay phones in most of the state. The rules were sparked
by numerous consumer complaints about difficulties using pay
phones or exorbitant costs of making long-distance and local
calls.</p>
<p>Within 60 days, the commission said, pay phones must allow
customers without a coin to dial emergency assistance,
directory assistance and repair service, as well as
long-distance access codes, operator assistance, and 800
numbers.</p>
<p>In addition, the commission ruled that the phones must
allow customers to make local or long-distance calls with
coins or calling cards. And the phones must have signs that
give information on long-distance charges, dialing
instructions and the name and number of the pay-phone
provider.</p>
