	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Eastman Kodak Co. apparently has failed in
its efforts to persuade the government to drop an
investigation that could lead to higher tariffs or import
quotas on fixed-focus 35mm and 110-type cameras from Asia,
Latin America and other parts of the world.
   The investigation was launched in response to a complaint
by Keystone Camera Products Corp., Clifton, N.J., calling for
import restrictions "on behalf of the U.S. industry." Despite
objections from Kodak, the U.S. International Trade
Commission was readying a letter notifying the Rochester,
N.Y.-based company that it would continue the inquiry, U.S.
officials said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The officials said the ITC will decide in late July
whether to recommend to President Bush that he order
restrictions on the imports.</p>
<p>The Keystone petition was filed under a provision of the
1974 Trade Act which allows the government temporarily to
block imports that are harming a domestic industry, even if
the harm doesn't result from any trade violation.</p>
<p>Keystone argued that without such protection, it will be
forced to shift its production to other countries. It charged
that Kodak "has, for all intents and purposes, abandoned U.S.
production {of the fixed-focus cameras} in favor of importing
from facilities in low-cost countries."</p>
<p>Kodak attorneys replied that the company is producing and
assembling 35mm cameras in U.S. factories, although they said
it has been assembling some U.S.-manufactured parts for 35mm
and 110-type cameras in factories in Mexico and Brazil for
eventual sale in the U.S. market.</p>
