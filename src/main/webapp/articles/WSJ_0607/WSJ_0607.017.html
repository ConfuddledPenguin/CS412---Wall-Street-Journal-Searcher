	<p class="article-leader">I was amused and dismayed by your May 4 article "GM Begins
Quest to Win Back Consumer Confidence." I was amused because
GM management has taken 10 years to admit publicly what
owners of 1980s vintage GM cars know by heart: The cars were
poorly designed, shabbily constructed and erratically
supported. GM's continuing drop in market share shows the
buying public is not as naive as the marketing professionals
believe.
   I was dismayed that some forces in GM management still
have not learned the lessons of their 1980s failures. The
belief that better marketing will improve their car sales is
a delusion. Consumers desire quality products offered at a
reasonable price. Engineering and production quality are
necessary to produce a competitive product. The auto maker
should not expect improved sales until its cars match the
performance of competitive models.</p>

<p>GM's cold relations in my case was topped only by its
computer calling me at 3 a.m. to ask if I was happy with my
'86 Buick in the midst of its 71 days in the shop the first
year.</p>
<p>It's too late, GM.</p>

<p>Despite the $40 million ad campaign, and the hundreds of
millions spent to buy out H. Ross Perot, GM doesn't have 25
cents to send me a letter explaining why it won't stand
behind the pile of junk it sold me labeled "Chevrolet."</p>
<p>From all the GM people I interacted with, I encountered
the attitude that it's foolish to expect much when you
purchase a GM product. I've learned my lesson.</p>

<p>Perhaps GM would be better served by taking the $40
million it's going to spend on advertising and putting it
toward a money-back-guarantee program. Any average guy on the
street knows from experience that what any company tells you
about its quality and service really doesn't mean anything
unless the company puts it in writing with a money-back
guarantee.</p>
<p>I haven't forgotten the new 1981 Oldsmobile that was in
the shop 21 days in the five months I owned it. I haven't
forgotten the burned-out transmission hundreds of miles from
home and the consequential damages that weren't covered.</p>
<p>By the way, the Toyota's going strong after nine years and
116,000 miles. It has required little besides ordinary
maintenance.</p>
