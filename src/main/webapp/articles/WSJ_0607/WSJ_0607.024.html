	<p class="article-leader">TURNBERRY, Scotland -- The Soviet Union assured the U.S.
that it won't impede the emigration of Soviet Jews despite
its public threat last week to do so, according to a senior
U.S. official.
   During a private meeting Tuesday night in Denmark, Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze told Secretary of State
James Baker that Moscow has "no plans to change {its}
approach to emigration," the official said. The Soviets have
allowed virtually unrestricted emigration during the past 18
months, and Mr. Shevardnadze emphasized that Moscow is
"committed" to continuing this policy, the official added.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The clarification helps avoid what could have become a
contentious issue between Washington and Moscow. Messrs.
Baker and Shevardnadze were in Denmark to attend an
international human-rights meeting. The U.S. official briefed
reporters aboard Mr. Baker's plane as it departed for a
meeting here of foreign ministers from members of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.</p>
<p>Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, during a news
conference in Washington last Sunday after his summit meeting
with President Bush, threatened to slow or halt the issuance
of exit permits unless Israel promises to stop settling the
Soviet-Jewish refugees in occupied Arab territory. Mr.
Gorbachev said he has been "bombarded" with complaints from
Arab governments about resettlement in the occupied
territories. Mr. Gorbachev's remark produced sharp criticism
in the U.S. and puzzled American officials because he hadn't
said it privately.</p>
<p>Mr. Shevardnadze explained to Mr. Baker during their
meeting Tuesday that the Soviet president's statement was
meant "to demonstrate that we {the Soviets} would like to
have certain understandings from the Israelis because there's
a problem here as far as we're concerned," according to the
U.S. official's account.</p>
<p>The Bush administration strongly supports the
unconditional emigration of Soviet Jews. But it, too, has
pressed Israel to bar the refugees from settling in the
occupied territories, saying that their settlement there
would be an obstacle to peace efforts. As the flow of Soviet
Jews to Israel has reached 10,000 a month, Arab governments
have grown increasingly alarmed that the refugees will
displace Palestinians.</p>
<p>Israel claims that fewer than 1% of Soviet-Jewish refugees
settle in the occupied territories. President Bush disagrees
with this figure, however, because it doesn't include Soviet
Jews who have settled in the outskirts of East Jerusalem,
which Israel occupied after the 1967 Six-Day War. Israel
considers united Jerusalem its capital. Mr. Bush provoked a
storm of protest in Israel earlier this year when he urged
Israel to stop settling refugees in the occupied West Bank
and East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The senior American official also said that Mr.
Shevardnadze wasn't certain when the Soviet Union's
parliament, the Supreme Soviet, would approve a pending law
codifying Mr. Gorbachev's open-emigration policy. Earlier
this year, the Soviets had predicted the law would be passed
before the Washington summit. But Mr. Shevardnadze told Mr.
Baker that with the new political freedom in the Soviet
Union, Mr. Gorbachev doesn't control the Supreme Soviet's
legislative calendar. Right now, he said, the parliament's
"whole preoccupation" is with economic reform.</p>
<p>President Bush signed a trade pact with Mr. Gorbachev at
the summit, but he won't submit it to Congress or grant
Moscow most-favored-nation trade status until the Soviet
emigration law is passed. The Soviet delay in passing the law
takes some pressure off Mr. Bush. Congress is expected to
resist approving a trade agreement until the Soviets lift
their economic embargo of Lithuania and begin talks with its
government.</p>
