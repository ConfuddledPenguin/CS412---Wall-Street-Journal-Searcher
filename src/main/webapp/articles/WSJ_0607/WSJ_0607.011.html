	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- A federal judge here barred Girard Partners
L.P. from soliciting shareholder support for its campaign to
oust Pic 'N' Save Corp.'s board until Girard makes certain
additional disclosures about itself.
   U.S. District Court Judge Robert Bonner ruled that Girard
can't resume solicitation of shareholder consents and proxies
until 10 days after the information is filed. He also ordered
Pic 'N' Save to delay the annual meeting until July 2 from
June 20 and extended the deadline for Girard's delivery of
consents to Pic 'N' Save to June 22 from June 10.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Pic 'N' Save, a Dominguez, Calif., discount retailer, said
that in granting the preliminary injunction, the court found
that Girard's solicitations violated U.S. securities laws.
The court also dissolved that portion of an order issued last
week that restrained Pic 'N' Save from soliciting revocations
of consents and proxies for the annual meeting.</p>
<p>In La Jolla, Calif., David H. Batchelder, Girard's
controlling shareholder, didn't return telephone calls for
comment.</p>
<p>Pic 'N' Save recently put itself up for sale in an
apparent attempt to convince investors that the incumbent
board is more dedicated than Girard to promoting shareholder
interests. Girard holds a 6.7% stake in the company and is
trying to gain a majority of board seats.</p>
