	<p class="article-leader">Thames Water PLC, one of Britain's recently privatized
utilities, reported a pretax profit of #179 million ($106.1
million) for the year ending March 31, topping the forecast
it made last November.
   The pretax profit compares with the #170 million forecast
in the privatization prospectus published a month ahead of
the December share sale.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The results aren't directly comparable with a year
earlier, when pretax profit totaled #207 million, due to
changes in the firm's capital structure and the exclusion of
the government-owned National Rivers Authority from the
latest year.</p>
<p>Sales rose 9.5% to #611 million from the #588 million
Thames gathered under government ownership a year earlier.</p>
<p>Profit after taxes totaled #166.3 million, while per-share
earnings were 43.6 pence.</p>
<p>Extraordinary charges of #18.7 million, compared with #3.2
million a year earlier, were comprised of #11.3 million in
costs related to the share sale and #7.4 million relating to
unfunded pension liabilities.</p>
<p>Net profit attributable to shareholders after the
extraordinary items stood at #147.6 million in the latest
year.</p>
