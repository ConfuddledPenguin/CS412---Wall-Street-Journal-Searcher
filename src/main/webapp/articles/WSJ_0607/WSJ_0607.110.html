	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered its
rating on New York state general obligation debt, expressing
concern about the state's financial condition, its heavy debt
load, and economic uncertainties in the region.
   The ratings agency lowered to single-A from single-A-1 its
rating on $4.27 billion of general obligation and fully
guaranteed bonds. Only two states, Louisiana and
Massachusetts, have a lower rating.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>New York has seen its short and long-term credit ratings
shrink this year amid efforts to balance the budget against
spending pressures, regional economic slowdown, and
resistance to higher taxes. State legislators in late May
agreed on a $49.8 billion budget and tax package.</p>
<p>Standard & Poor's Corp. jolted the bond market in March
when it cut its New York state rating two notches, to
single-A from double-A-minus. At that time, Moody's rated the
state's long-term debt single-A-1, a medium-grade ranking it
had granted in 1986. During the previous decade, Moody's had
rated New York state single-A.</p>
<p>Like S&P, Moody's in March had lowered its rating on
short-term notes, but held up issuing a new long-term rating
while awaiting results of the budget negotiations. The latest
announcement by Moody's puts the two major ratings agencies
in agreement for long-term debt ratings as well.</p>
<p>In response to the latest ratings, Dall W. Forsythe, state
budget director, said the decision by Moody's "was not
unexpected, particularly after a six-week delay in enacting a
budget." He said the state's new budget includes a number of
fiscal reforms, including eliminating spring borrowing and
retiring an accumulated deficit, as well as imposing a
spending cap. Thus, he added, "we are confident that as the
fiscal reforms achieve their intended effects, the rating
agencies will re-evaluate and restore the state's credit
rating."</p>
<p>Moody's assigned a MIG-2 rating to a $4.1 billion issue of
tax anticipation notes expected to be sold June 8. It
affirmed at single-A its rating on limited-liability lease
and contractual obligation issues. The state's gross debt
totals about $26.2 billion.</p>
<p>In assigning an SP-1 rating to the new notes issue, S&P
affirmed its single-A general obligation debt rating and
other ratings on about $17.4 billion of New York state
obligations.</p>
<p>Both ratings agencies expressed reservations about the
state's ability to make good on its promised intentions of
improving its budget situation. "Unfortunately, the state's
track record in deviating from prudent fiscal paramaters"
isn't so great, said Hyman Grossman, a managing director at
S&P.</p>
<p>The lower rating presumably will make it more costly for
the state to borrow in the future. "The lower rating would
indicate a higher degree of risk," said George Leung, vice
president and managing director of state ratings at Moody's.</p>
<p>To boost its credit ratings, he said, the state would have
to show "improvement in its financial condition," including
avoidance of one-time measures that contribute to problems in
future years.</p>
<p>Moody's noted that the state's budget balance "remains
narrow, measures intended to add revenues are reliant on
taxes that have proven difficult to predict, and internal
sources of liquidity have eroded."</p>
<p>And, it added, "spending pressures pose a risk,
particularly in the areas of Medicaid, social services and
corrections. With the election of all major state
office-holders in November, the recent budget process did not
resort to spending cuts in a substantial way."</p>
