	<p class="article-leader">A Texas scientist found that at least some of the
palladium rods used in "cold fusion" experiments might have
been contaminated with tritium.
   The surprising discovery is likely to add new confusion
and controversy to the "cold fusion" story, although
scientists said it doesn't undermine other evidence that some
kind of strange phenomenon is occurring in various "cold
fusion" experiments.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Tritium is a form of hydrogen that is created during
certain nuclear reactions. In the past year, as many as two
dozen laboratories have reported finding tritium in their
"cold fusion" experiments that wasn't present at the
beginning of the experiments. The tritium findings have been
cited as one of three types of evidence that hint nuclear
fusion reactions might be occurring in the experiments.</p>
<p>The new discovery raises questions as to whether some of
the experiments might have been inadvertently contaminated
with tritium.</p>
<p>Kevin Wolf, a physicist in the Cyclotron Laboratory at
Texas A&M University in College Station, said that his
finding of contaminated palladium was made during attempts to
discover why his "cold fusion" experiments were failing to
duplicate the results of separate "cold fusion" experiments
two blocks away in the chemistry department at Texas A&M.</p>
<p>The "cold fusion" experiments in both Texas laboratories,
as well as in most other laboratories, involve taking a rod
of palladium metal, encircling it with a platinum wire,
inserting it in a flask of "heavy" water and applying an
electric current. The heavy water is rich in doubly-heavy
hydrogen atoms known as deuterium atoms. The "cold fusion"
controversy centers on whether such experiments are producing
excess energy as a result of the nuclei of deuterium atoms
fusing together. The formation of tritium, a triply-heavy
form of hydrogen, would be one indication of nuclear fusions.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf said that since the "cold fusion" uproar broke
out in late March 1989, his lab has run dozens of experiments
and currently has 100 "cells" operating. But, he explained,
only two of the cells have ever produced any tritium. This
contrasts sharply with the results in the chemistry
department, where chemist John Bockris and his colleagues
have reported production of large amounts of tritium by "cold
fusion" cells.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf said he recently analyzed several pieces of
palladium used in his experiments and found that four of them
contained tritium. Some of these pieces were used in "blank"
experiments that used ordinary "light" water instead of heavy
water. The light water experiments hadn't produced any
tritium and presumably no fusion reactions had occurred.</p>
<p>The physicist said the only conclusion was that the
palladium had tritium in it before the experiments began. All
the tritium-contaminated pieces, he said, came originally
from Hoover & Strong Inc., a metals processor in Richmond,
Va.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf said the contamination might explain the tritium
he found in his two experiments, but he declined to say that
the finding accounts for the tritium found by Mr. Bockris and
other experimenters. "I'm not trying to explain the world's
results, just our results," he said.</p>
<p>Over at the chemistry department, Mr. Bockris said he was
startled by Mr. Wolf's findings. "I've been thinking about it
for two days," he said. But, he added, "I haven't changed my
mind" that the tritium in his experiments is coming from some
kind of nuclear reaction. He explained that he and others had
pondered some "worst case" scenarios involving
tritium-contaminated palladium and none of the scenarios
produced as much tritium as he has found in his experiments.</p>
<p>The chemist also noted that it is highly unlikely that
positively charged tritium atoms could escape from the
negatively charged palladium. Therefore, even if the
palladium was contaminated, the tritium couldn't leak out
into the surrounding heavy water, he argued.</p>
<p>Mr. Bockris, however, noted that "about two-thirds of our
work" used palladium from Hoover & Strong, although not from
the same batch of metal that Mr. Wolf analyzed.</p>
<p>Hoover & Strong vice president Dan Pharr said he was
unfamiliar with "cold fusion" research and "I wouldn't know
how to comment one way or the other." The company, he said,
refines and reprocesses palladium primarily for the jewelry
trade and thus isn't as concerned about purity as scientists
might be.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf's finding is likely to give new ammunition to
critics who charge that "cold fusion" is an illusion and that
most of the reported positive results can be explained by
errors in measurements or by contamination. However, Mr. Wolf
himself said evidence that many of the experiments have
produced low levels of neutrons is still "pretty solid." He
said he soon will move some of his experiments into a
subterranean salt dome to see if he can detect neutrons while
shielded from extraneous radiation.</p>
<p>"Right now, the implications {of contaminated palladium}
aren't very important" in the overall "cold fusion" picture,
said David Worledge, a scientist at the Electric Power
Research Institute in Palo Alto, Calif. The
industry-supported institute is funding several "cold fusion"
efforts, including those of both Messrs. Wolf and Bockris.</p>
<p>Mr. Worledge explained that attempts to produce tritium in
"cold fusion" experiments had run their course and didn't
hold much further promise in trying to resolve the
controversy over whether fusion was actually occurring. The
question is more likely to be resolved by new experiments to
detect neutrons and to explain the production of excess heat,
he said.</p>
