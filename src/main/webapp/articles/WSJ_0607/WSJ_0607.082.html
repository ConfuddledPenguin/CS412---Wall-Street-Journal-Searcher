	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Morgan Stanley Group Inc., in the wake of a
management reshuffling, named two successors to Joseph G.
Fogg III, who recently was named head of investment banking.
   The big securities firm said Robert A. Jeffe and W. Carter
McClelland will be co-directors of its world-wide corporate
finance department, which Fogg had led since 1985.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Jeffe, 40 years old, joined Morgan Stanley in 1974,
and most recently was a managing director, heading energy
coverage for the firm's investment banking division. Mr.
McClelland, 44, joined the firm in 1973 and recently headed
its high-technology and defense investment-banking
activities.</p>
<p>Mr. Fogg's new position helped fill the gap created when
Robert Greenhill, vice chairman and head of investment
banking, was recently recommended by Morgan Stanley
management to be named president.</p>
<p>Separately, Morgan Stanley named Robert Lessin to run a
newly created strategic development department. This group
will coordinate the business development and marketing plans
for the firm's investment banking division.</p>
<p>The 35-year-old Mr. Lessin, who joined the firm in 1977,
has run a similar strategic group for Morgan Stanley's
mergers and acquisition department since 1983. Now that group
will be folded into the new development department for all of
investment banking, Morgan Stanley said.</p>
