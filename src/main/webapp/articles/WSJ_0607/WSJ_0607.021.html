	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- National Broadcasting Co. said it expects a
shortfall of $200 million in advertising revenue this year
because of a decline in the broadcast network audience and
NBC's own faltering prime time lineup.
   NBC President Robert C. Wright disclosed the expected
shortfall at a meeting with the network's 200-plus affiliates
at NBC's annual convention in Washington, D.C.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>NBC, a unit of General Electric Co., has experienced a
slide in viewership from key demographic groups. The result
was the network had to give advertisers free time, or make
good, when a show failed to deliver the audience size
guaranteed to a sponsor.</p>
<p>In the past TV season, NBC was off 12% from last year in
women viewers 18 to 49 years old and 14% in men 18 to 49,
according to A.C. Nielsen Co. figures.</p>
<p>All three major broadcasting networks have been hurt by a
sharp drop in ratings that network officials said is the
result of problems with Nielsen's methods of compiling data.
Nielsen officials insisted there is nothing wrong with its
system, although it has agreed to examine ways of improving
it.</p>
<p>Although NBC finished the 1989-90 season No. 1 for the
fifth year, its ratings were down 9% from last year. And last
month, CBS Inc.'s TV network finished only one-tenth of a
ratings point behind NBC. May is one of four months each year
that local stations use ratings to determine advertising
rates.</p>
