	<p class="article-leader">Tambrands Inc., a women's care products maker based in
Lake Success, N.Y., plans to move its headquarters to
Westchester County, north of New York City, to cut costs by
choosing a smaller site.
   The company said it will sell its Long Island offices and
expects to complete the move by the end of 1991. The new head
office site, which hasn't been determined, will be closer to
Tambrands' Technical Center in Palmer, Mass., and to its U.S.
plants, all in New York state or New England, which have a
total of 1,300 employees. Of the 200 employees in Lake
Success, 50 will be offered posts at the Technical Center,
which has 210 employees, and 150 will move to Westchester.
Tambrands has 4,100 employees world-wide.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the past year, the company has determined to focus on
feminine care, with its Tampax tampons and Maxithins sanitary
pads. Tambrands has been praised by analysts for its strong
restructuring moves, including payroll cuts and stock
buy-backs.</p>
