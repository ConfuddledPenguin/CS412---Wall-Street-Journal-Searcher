	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The House passed a bill that would speed up
the transfer of Western technology to the Soviet Union and
the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe.
   The measure, approved last night by a 312-86 vote, was
timed to prod the Bush administration into expanding its
offer to relax export restrictions on computers,
telecommunications equipment and machine tools that the West
can sell to these countries. The U.S. and 16 of its European
and Asian allies are currently meeting in Paris to discuss
how they can safely meet the demands of the Soviet Union and
its former satellites for Western products and know-how.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The House bill would allow the U.S. to freely sell the
Soviet Union and East European countries computers with a
capacity of 550 megabits of information per second. Current
rules set a limit of 78 mps. The administration has offered
to raise it to 275 mps, but would allow shipments of more
powerful computers if the purchasing governments promise to
guard against unauthorized military use. The legislation
would require the administration to seek the 550 mps level in
negotiations with its allies, who would have to ratify any
change.</p>
<p>The higher standard would permit East European nations --
and the Soviet Union under some conditions -- to buy some
U.S. mainframes as well as practically all personal computers
available in the West.</p>
<p>While the Bush administration offer stops short of giving
East Europe access to telecommunications systems powered by
digital switching, the House bill would give the West the
discretion of selling even the top-of-the-line systems.</p>
<p>The Bush administration has expressed opposition to the
bill, saying that it pre-empts the administration's
authority. In the Senate, the Banking Committee plans to
begin work soon on its version of the bill.</p>
<p>Before passing the bill last night, the House attached
amendments to withhold certain trade benefits from the Soviet
Union and China because of continuing concerns over human
rights in those countries.</p>
<p>Reacting strongly to Soviet attempts to squash Lithuania's
moves towards independence, the House approved an amendment
to deny the Soviets the higher levels of technology until
President Bush certifies to Congress that the Soviets have
entered into "serious negotiations" with Lithuania's
duly-elected government and are conducting these talks
without coercion. The amendment, introduced by Rep. Richard
Durbin (D., Ill.) and passed on a 390-24 vote, would
effectively freeze current restrictions on the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Mr. Durbin vowed that the U.S. won't "abandon Lithuania in
its efforts for self-determination."</p>
<p>Signaling its distaste for China's human-rights record,
the House approved an amendment that would strip Mr. Bush of
his discretionary power to allow U.S. owners of
communications satellites to buy launch services from China.
Rep. Gerald Solomon (R., N.Y.), the amendment's sponsor, took
Beijing to task for failing to make amends for the massacre
of democracy marchers in Tiananmen Square a year ago.</p>
<p>Last December, Mr. Bush, invoking a national-security
waiver from existing sanctions, authorized the shipment of
three U.S. satellites to be put in orbit by China. However,
he would lose such leeway if this provision becomes law. The
Solomon amendment was approved 395-15.</p>
<p>The House bill, a bipartisan effort steered by Rep. Sam
Gejdenson (D., Conn.) and Rep. Toby Roth (R., Wis.), would
also create a "license-free zone" for exports among the U.S.
and 16 of its cooperating allies. Such a step eliminate
licensing requirements for exports of all but the most
sophisticated equipment, and would rid the U.S. licensing
bureaucracy and exporters of one-third of their normal
paperwork.</p>
<p>The bill's "sunset" provisions would automatically
eliminate export controls on whole categories of commodities
after a prescribed period, unless the authorities can justify
reinstating controls on individual items.</p>
