	<p class="article-leader">Anheuser-Busch Cos. said it filed a complaint with the
Federal Trade Commission charging rival brewer Adolph Coors
Co. with "false and deceptive" advertising practices for
touting its Rocky Mountain roots.
   The flap began after Coors started testing an advertising
campaign that brags about the "Clean, fresh, pure Rocky
Mountain Spring water" used to brew its beer. The 30- and
60-second television advertisements cut back and forth
between quiet scenes of Colorado mountains and pictures of
the crowded highways of big cities.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Anheuser took its gripe public after Coors announced on
Tuesday its plans to buy a Memphis, Tenn., brewery from Stroh
Brewery Co. "We wonder how that company can maintain its
`Rocky Mountain identity' while brewing in Memphis," said
Michael J. Roarty, executive vice president of corporate
marketing at Anheuser-Busch.</p>
<p>Mr. Roarty said that the Coors campaign implies that its
beers are brewed using only Colorado water. But Coors
actually makes some beer in a packaging facility in Virginia
by mixing local water with beer concentrate, according to Mr.
Roarty. The water is fine, but "the advertising is deceptive,
and we think they should stop it," he said.</p>
<p>In Golden, a spokeswoman for Coors said all Coors beer is
currently brewed in Golden with Rocky Mountain spring water,
and "we've made no decision to brew anywhere else." The
spokeswoman also said that all beer starts as "high-gravity
beer," including beers made by Anheuser-Busch, which are
later blended with water and carbon dioxide to meet
government alcohol-content requirements. Coors does ship
about 15% of its high-gravity beer to Virginia, where it is
blended with water and packaged, the spokeswoman said.</p>
