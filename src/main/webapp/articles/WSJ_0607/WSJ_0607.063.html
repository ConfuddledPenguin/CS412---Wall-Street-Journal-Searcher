	<p class="article-leader">DODGEVILLE, Wis. -- Lands' End Inc.'s top merchandising
executive resigned at a time when analysts believe the
catalog company isn't doing enough to freshen its selection.
   Russell C. Gaitskill, a department-store veteran who
joined Lands' End less than two years ago as its executive
vice president of merchandising, said he left to pursue
"other things" including the possibility of starting his own
manufacturing business.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Lands' End named David Dyer as his successor. Mr. Dyer, 40
years old, joined Lands' End in July as managing director in
charge of launching a separate catalog of bed and bath items
and other home accessories. He had been a merchandising
executive at the Burdines unit of Federated Department Stores
Inc.</p>
<p>A spokesman said Mr. Dyer's appointment doesn't signal any
change in direction at Lands' End. "We're going to continue
to focus on freshening our product line," he said.</p>
<p>The 41-year-old Mr. Gaitskill nevertheless hinted in an
interview that he may have had differences with senior Lands'
End executives over product introductions. He said he
"absolutely" wanted to bring in new merchandise, but wouldn't
comment on the reaction of his superiors.</p>
<p>"I don't think it's a matter of being unhappy," he said of
his decision to leave Lands' End. "It's a matter of being
mismatched."</p>
<p>Mr. Gaitskill drew a distinction between his background in
merchandising at Federated's Lazarus unit and Lands' End,
which he described as "more of a marketing" company. "One is
the medium and one is the product," he said.</p>
<p>Analysts attribute Lands' End's current troubles to its
failure to introduce enough fresh merchandise to capture the
imagination of its customers. Just 11.5% of the company's
catalog items this past year and 8% the year before were new.
Lands' End plans to increase that percentage this year to 15%
to 18%. A separate children's clothing catalog is planned for
August and the bed and bath catalog is due next year.</p>
<p>But the company, which sells mostly traditional casual
clothes like khaki pants and rugby shirts, has already hit
some serious snags. After sailing smoothly through the 1980s,
ringing up annual sales and profit gains of more than 40%,
net income for the year ended Jan. 31 fell 10% to $29.1
million, or $1.45 a share, on sales of $545.2 million.
Earnings for the first quarter ended May 4 plunged 64%. And
analysts say earnings for the current fiscal year could
decline more than 10%.</p>
