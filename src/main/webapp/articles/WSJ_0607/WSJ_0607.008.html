	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The multivitamin supplements that many women
take during pregnancy aren't generally necessary, because
proper diets can provide most of the nutrients expectant
mothers need, an Institute of Medicine study concluded.
   A lengthy study by medical and nutritional experts found
that "iron is the only known nutrient for which requirements
cannot be met reasonably by diet alone." It recommends
low-dose iron supplements during pregnancy.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In addition, the study takes a more relaxed view of weight
gain during pregnancy, saying that increases in the range of
25 to 35 pounds are appropriate for women of normal
prepregnancy weight. The new range is an increase from the 20
to 25 pounds suggested 20 years ago.</p>
<p>These recommendations, which are in line with existing
standards, aren't likely to have much impact on current
practices. Taking multivitamin supplements, which include
iron, during pregnancy "is a deeply ingrained custom; it's
generally regarded, particularly by patients, as something
that you do," said Roy Pitkin, the chairman of the medical
school and the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the
University of California, Los Angeles. Dr. Pitkin headed the
study for the Institute of Medicine, which is affiliated with
the National Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>However, Dr. Pitkin suggested that part of the Institute's
report, entitled "Nutrition During Pregnancy," could moderate
growing interest in the so-called periconceptional use of
vitamin supplements -- their use in a span of several months
immediately before and after conception. Several recent
studies have reported the periconceptional use of vitamin
supplements containing folate, or folic acid, may provide
some protection against neural tube defects, which can cause
such birth defects as spina bifida. But the study concluded
that there isn't enough evidence to support a recommendation
for periconceptional use of vitamins.</p>
<p>The vitamin industry promptly attacked the panel's
finding. J.B. Cordaro, president of an industry group called
the Council for Responsible Nutrition, said, "This
outrageously anti-health report potentially dooms thousands
of children to an early death or at best substantial
disability due to serious birth defects." The Council said
there is "growing evidence that women who take multivitamins
containing folic acid as part of their normal life style have
a signficantly lower risk" of having babies with neural tube
defects.</p>
<p>The panel recommended further research on the connection
between multivitamins containing folate and neural tube
disease. In the meantime, it suggested that women of
childbearing age increase their consumption of fruits,
vegetables, legumes and whole-grain breads and cereals, all
good sources of folate.</p>
<p>The study, which was sponsored by the maternal and child
health bureau of the Department of Health and Human Services,
recommends that women of normal prepregnancy weight who are
carrying single fetuses aim for a weight gain of about one
pound a week during the second and third trimesters.</p>
<p>Its recommendation is somewhat higher than the 22 to 27
pound range suggested by the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, but it's in line with the
weight-gain many physicians feel comfortable with, Dr. Pitkin
said. Over the last few decades, physicians have become more
relaxed about weight gain during pregnancy. In general,
larger weight gain reduces the number of low birth-weight
babies, but it also can make it more difficult for mothers to
lose weight after pregnancy, the report warned.</p>
<p>The report notes that women of less than normal weight
should gain in the range of 28 to 40 pounds.</p>
<p>Although the report recommends against the use of
multivitamin supplements for most women, it says that
high-risk groups -- women who are malnourished or carrying
more than one baby, along with smokers and drug and alcohol
abusers -- should take supplements.</p>
<p>The college agrees multivitamin supplements aren't
necessary for healthy women on well-balanced diets. However,
unlike the institute, the group recommends supplements of
folic acid, as well as iron.</p>
<p>Leading multivitamin supplements for pregnant women are:
Materna from the Lederle Laboratories division of American
Cyanamid Co.; Natalins from the Mead Johnson division of
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.; and Stuartnatal and Stuart Prenatal
from Stuart Pharmaceuticals, a division of ICI Americas Inc.
ICI is a subsidiary of Imperial Chemical Industries PLC.</p>
<p>Kate Ruddon, an official of the college, agreed that
another finding that multivitamin supplements aren't
necessary won't change use patterns. "Our recommendations
have been around for a long time, and most fellows of the
college know what they are and most still recommend a
multivitamin supplement," she explained.</p>
