	<p class="article-leader">Clea Shawn, the middle-aged heroine of Lisa Alther's
shrewd, funny fourth novel, "Bedrock" (Knopf, 325 pages,
$19.95), is a cosmopolitan woman if ever there was one. She
lives in a Manhattan townhouse, works as a travel
photographer, and enjoys an open marriage to an executive for
whom she feels a "sororal affection." Though she's had a
number of affairs -- hormones, we're told, are "her
recreational drug of choice" -- a recent mugging and a newly
empty nest have somehow turned her off romance.
   Instead, she's drawn to Roches Ridge -- a seemingly
idyllic Vermont hamlet where she buys a second home. Far from
being a paradise, though, Roches Ridge proves to be just what
its name suggests: a pesthole. Among other things, it has a
separatist-lesbian colony, a newfangled mortuary called
Deathworks, and a restaurateur who derives her beliefs from
Shirley MacLaine. That there's only a skin-deep difference
between the godless city and this corner of God's Country is
underlined by Clea's discovery that directly beneath the
local topsoil lies solid bedrock.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But Clea's fantasies die hard. That's her flaw as both
woman and artist: A specialist in escapist amours and glibly
pretty photographs, she's loath to confront the bleaker
aspects of reality. Not so her best friend, Elke, a Holocaust
survivor and sculptor (her name a near mirror image of
Clea's) who traffics almost exclusively in violent images. To
Elke, Clea's a hopeless idealist, an embodiment of "American
innocence." Yet the two share not only friendship but an
unconsummated mutual passion. Together, we're meant to see,
they might (a) make a splendid couple and (b) help each other
grow as artists.</p>
<p>In the neat contrasts it draws between these women, and in
the orderly way it leads them to their fates, "Bedrock" may
be a tad overcalculated. It doesn't read that way, though.
Consistently, Ms. Alther's wit gives breath and bite to what
might otherwise seem contrived. This is not her first book in
which lesbian love threatens a marriage; but the fairness and
irony with which she observes everyone -- man and woman,
straight and gay -- keeps her from coming across simply as a
booster for extreme feminism or homosexuality.</p>
<p>Ms. Alther makes plain her belief in the centrality of
feeling to artistic creation, and her disdain for faddish art
that is "designed to thwart, obscure, and mock both
engagement and passion, substituting novelty and whimsy,
alienation and absurdity." Granted, "Bedrock" is at times
less engaged and passionate than it is mocking and whimsical
(and even absurd), but that won't disappoint admirers of her
best selling "Kinflicks." Surely the serious story of Clea
and Elke's friendship often seems to occur a world away from
the novel's more bizarre subplots. And Clea may strike some
readers as preposterously blinkered, taking far too long to
realize she's been "photographing chateaux while most people
are huddling in shacks." Yet this is on the whole a wise,
highly diverting novel, one that ponders contemporary urban
sensibilities with both a compassionate heart and a sardonic
eye.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Scott Spencer is -- well -- another matter. His 1979 best
seller "Endless Love" was routinely dopey, but his fourth
novel, "Secret Anniversaries" (Knopf, 257 pages, $19.95), is
truly a standout -- the plot exceptionally fatuous, the
execution astonishingly amateurish. It's 1940, and Caitlin
Van Fleet, a poor Hudson Valley girl, is caught by a rich
couple in bed with their son. Naturally, they ship her off to
Washington to work for the congressman who happens to be
their dinner guest that evening. Soon she's having a fling
with the congressman's female assistant, who eventually dies
in an airplane explosion set by a Nazi sympathizer.</p>
<p>It's all as synthetic as can be. The gay stuff is
thoroughly unconvincing; and the political message -- for a
political message is what this book boils down to -- is
spelled out in the most callow terms. Mr. Spencer wants to
remind us that before Pearl Harbor the U.S. had a powerful
right-wing isolationist movement, led by the likes of Charles
Lindbergh and Father Coughlin. The novel's bad guys are of
this company, as we can tell from their tidy little
anti-Semitic speeches. Some of the good guys are communists,
whose allegiance to Stalin is surely as shameful as
Lindbergh's isolationism, though we don't hear about this in
other little speeches.</p>
<p>Mr. Spencer attempts to complicate his simple story by
jumbling the chronology. Then he tries to dress up his
rudimentary prose with an occasional pseudo-poetic locution.
He is spectacularly bad at this. "It was winter, dead
winter," he writes, "the very core of the coldest time." When
Caitlin's parents sleep, she hears "the noises of their
repose."</p>
<p>Even more conspicuous is Mr. Spencer's penchant for inept
imagery. Every page offers another ungainly metaphor or
baffling simile. Trudging through snow, Caitlin's shoes "made
a noise like a dog chewing a chunk of charcoal." Her passion
for the rich boy is "like signals from a radio tower in a
world without radios." Later in life, she tries "to find her
reflection in a mirror over which time had cast an
impenetrable shadow." One gets the impression that Mr.
Spencer wrote "Secret Anniversaries" in order to use up all
the figurative language he'd scribbled in his notebook over
the years. That's as good an explanation as any for this
book's existence.</p>
