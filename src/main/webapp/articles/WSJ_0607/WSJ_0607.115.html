	<p class="article-leader">Tuesday's defeat of two initiatives on the California
ballot that would have limited gerrymandering is a big
political coup for Willie Brown, the powerful Democratic
Assembly Speaker. For now anyway, his political castle is
secure.
   In 1984, Mr. Brown defeated a similar reform effort,
backed by the liberal group Common Cause, with demagogic TV
commercials featuring actors Jack Lemmon and Jack Klugman.
Afterward, the Fresno Bee reported he called a news
conference and boasted that the ads represented "the most
extensive collection of con jobs I've ever seen."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>This year, Speaker Brown pulled out all the stops to kill
two new redistricting initiatives. One backed by the League
of Women Voters would have set up a bipartisan commission to
draw more compact and competitive districts. Another would
have required a two-thirds, rather than a majority, vote of
the Legislature to pass a redistricting plan. The Democratic
majority in the Legislature is based largely on the spoils of
a 1982 gerrymander, which more or less ended competitive
elections in California. In the 400 races for the state
Legislature since then, only seven incumbents have lost.</p>
<p>This time, Speaker Brown took no chances that the drawing
of the post-1990 Census lines would threaten his power base.
He once again sent forth a series of emotion-drenched ads
that tied redistricting reform to corporate greed and
polluters.</p>
<p>The most widely used featured actor James Garner of "The
Rockford Files," and deserves its own niche in a Museum of
Propaganda. It began with the sounds of a ship crashing,
followed by images of the Exxon Valdez on the rocks and a
dead, oil-covered otter being pulled out of the muck. Mr.
Garner said the two initiatives "could let big business
exploit our oceans, trees and few remaining wilderness
areas."</p>
<p>When pressed to explain the logic of tying dead otters in
Alaska with redistricting reform in California, Karin Caves,
a spokeswoman for the anti-initiative campaign, said the
Garner ad was based on the fact that backers of the
initiatives are among "the worst polluters in California."
She said the initiatives would further threaten the
environment because they could result in more Republicans
being elected.</p>
<p>Carole Wagner Vallianos, president of the California
League of Women Voters, called the ads "an attempt to confuse
the voters." They worked. Anti-gerrymander sentiment in the
state was strong: Last year a Field Poll found 82% of
Californians opposed the concept of gerrymandering, and both
initiatives led in the polls only two weeks ago.</p>
<p>But to fight the threat to their duchies, incumbents
raised more than $5 million. Democratic Members of Congress
also pressured several corporations not to support
redistricting reform. One executive told Sacramento Bee
columnist Dan Walters that he was given "a pretty stern
lecture" by one Congressman. "We were told that anyone who
gave wouldn't get any help," he said.</p>
<p>The gerrymandering issue isn't going away.</p>
<p>This week, a group of Hispanic and liberal activists
convinced a federal court that Los Angeles County supervisors
had unconstitutionally gerrymandered their districts so that
no Hispanic has been elected to any of the five seats.
Federal Judge David Kenyon will further rule today on whether
to throw out the results of two supervisor races that were
held Tuesday under the current lines. The gerrymandering was
clearly designed to protect the Democratic and Republican
incumbents who drew the lines, and only had the incidental
effect of reducing the chances of a Hispanic victory.</p>
<p>The courts are not likely to let liberals have it both
ways. Gerrymandering for partisan purposes of limiting voter
choice and competition is just as wrong as gerrymandering
that denies minorities a fair chance at representation. In
1987, the Supreme Court indicated that drawing district lines
to deny a political minority its rights can also be
unconstitutional. Speaker Brown may yet lose what he and his
merry fellows now regard as a divine right.</p>
