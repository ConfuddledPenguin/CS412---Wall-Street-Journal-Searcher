	<p class="article-leader">Seagram Co.'s net income fell 4.6% in the first quarter
ended April 30, reflecting lower unremitted equity earnings
at Du Pont Co., the Wilmington, Del., chemical and energy
concern in which the Montreal-based distiller holds a 24.3%
interest.
   Unremitted equity earnings are reported in Seagram's
results, although the company doesn't get any payments.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Net dropped to $187 million, or $1.97 a share, from $196
million, or $2 a share, a year earlier when more shares were
outstanding. The unremitted earnings, representing Seagram's
share of Du Pont's profit, fell 27% to $79 million from $108
million. Dividend income from Du Pont rose 14% to $66 million
from $58 million.</p>
<p>Operating earnings rose 26% to $157 million from $125
million, while sales advanced 5.4% to $1.29 billion from
$1.23 billion. The rises reflect strength in international
wine and spirits operations, particularly at the Brazilian
affiliate, which was strong, prior to economic controls
imposed by the country's new government.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Seagram's shares fell 62.5 cents to $86.25.</p>
