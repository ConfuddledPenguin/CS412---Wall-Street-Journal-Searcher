	<p class="article-leader">Eagle-Picher Industries Inc. said it intends to sell three
businesses as part of a previously announced plan to fund
asbestos litigation liability.
   The businesses to be divested -- its Trim, Orcomatic and
Injection Molding divisions -- make a variety of molded
rubber and trim parts for the automotive industry. They
accounted for less than 5% of Eagle-Picher's $729.9 million
in sales for the year ended Nov. 30, 1989, a company
spokesman said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Eagle-Picher, Cincinnati, is a defendant in about 60,000
separate lawsuits stemming from its manufacture, from 1934
until 1971, of an asbestos-containing insulating cement used
principally in shipbuilding and refinery construction. The
company said it has already paid nearly $500 million in
asbestos claims, and expects to pay at least that amount to
resolve current and future litigation.</p>
<p>At the end of its fiscal first quarter, ended Feb. 28,
Eagle-Picher had an underfunded reserve of $462 million for
such litigation. Proceeds from the sale of the three
designated divisions will be used to fund that reserve.</p>
