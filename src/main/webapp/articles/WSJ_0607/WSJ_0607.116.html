	<p class="article-leader">PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) -- The government rounded up
at least seven former Communist Party leaders yesterday in a
move likely to hurt the chances of Communist candidates two
days before the nation's first free election since 1946.
   The party is running a distant third in opinion polls.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Detained was Vasil Bilak, the former party official
thought to have invited in the Soviet troops who crushed the
"Prague Spring" reform movement of Alexander Dubcek in 1968.
At least six other former senior Communists were questioned.</p>
<p>In another political development, Josef Bartoncik, a major
Christian Democratic politician accused of having been a
secret police informer, was denounced by the minister charged
with investigating past secret police operations and urged to
quit politics.</p>
<p>Yesterday's developments seemed likely to benefit the
Civic Forum movement of President Vaclav Havel, already
favored to win tomorrow's elections. The Christian Democrats
are running second in the surveys.</p>
<p>The state news agency CTK said Mr. Bilak was held "on
suspicion of committing serious criminal activity."</p>
<p>Prominent Communists questioned yesterday included former
president and party chief Gustav Husak; Milos Jakes, the
party chief ousted in last winter's pro-democracy revolution;
and former Premier Jozef Lenart, state TV news said.</p>
