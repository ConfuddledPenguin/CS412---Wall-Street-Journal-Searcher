	<p class="article-leader">In regard to "Setting the Vietnam Record Straight,"
editorial page, May 4: Without questioning the honest intent
of Arthur Kobler, W. Gage McAfee and Warren Williams, their
attempt to justify the U.S. invasion of Vietnam by proposing
that the legacy "is profoundly constructive" is redolent of
the immortal phrase, "the patient died, but the operation was
successful."
   The record can never be set straight until participants
and historians forbear making such statements as "it was
devastating . . . but . . . " The inclusion of that awful
word "but" is the standard political justification for
keeping open options for the next conflagration. The honor
and dignity of the 55,000 American servicemen who died in
Vietnam cannot be sustained (or vindicated) by economic
successes. Their lives were much more important.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Perhaps the three gentlemen have overlooked the recent
events in Europe where, without bloodshed, an economically
free society has emerged from 45 years of communist
aggression. And we didn't use one napalm bomb.</p>

<p>I quote Messrs. Kobler, McAfee and Williams, " . . . the
transcending legacy of the U.S. war effort is profoundly
constructive: It is the growing prosperity of the 300 million
people who live in Southeast Asia outside of Indochina and
Burma." Apparently, the domino theory will never die. I
suggest they read Barbara Tuchman's "The March of Folly,"
especially the chapter titled "America Betrays Herself in
Vietnam," and Michael Sheehan's "A Bright and Shining Lie."
They should address themselves to Ms. Tuchman's and Mr.
Sheehan's profoundly disturbing analyses of the domino theory
as the rationale for America's war in Vietnam. As for the
transcending legacy of Vietnam: Why not include the loss --
perhaps forever -- of America's high moral reputation, the
disintegration of authority, widespread drug use and the
crippling of presidential power. This legacy from Vietnam has
had an undoubted and profoundly transcending effect on
America, destructive not constructive.</p>

<p>The U.S. committed three gigantic errors in the Vietnam
War. If we citizens forget them, our leaders may err again.</p>
<p>1. We had no overall goal or purpose.</p>
<p>2. Our leaders didn't know, or didn't want to know, how
badly the war was going.</p>
<p>3. Our troops had so many restrictions placed on them
there was no way they could win.</p>
<p>Elected and appointed officials who made a mess of things
can never be brought to trial. However, we should remember
our Vietnam debacle -- that we may never repeat it.</p>
