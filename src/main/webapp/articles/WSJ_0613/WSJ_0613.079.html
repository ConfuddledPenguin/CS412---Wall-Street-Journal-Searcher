	<p class="article-leader">OLD GREENWICH, Conn. -- The rating on about $1.7 billion
of American Brands Inc.'s debt was boosted to single-A-3 from
Baa-2 by Moody's Investors Service Inc.
   The rating concern also upgraded a shelf registration of
senior debt of the tobacco, consumer products and insurance
company to preliminary single-A-3 from preliminary Baa-3. And
Moody's confirmed its prime-2 rating on the company's
commercial paper.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A "more-focused" American Brands "is generating increasing
free cash flow from non-tobacco businesses, while continuing
to benefit from {tobacco} volume and price gains in the
important United Kingdom and U.S. markets," Moody's said.</p>
<p>Potential impediments to greater cash generation from the
company's tobacco and distilled spirits businesses include
continued declines in per-capita consumption of cigarettes,
Moody's said. A material increase in excise taxes or an
adverse tobacco product-liability judgment are major external
risk factors, Moody's added.</p>
