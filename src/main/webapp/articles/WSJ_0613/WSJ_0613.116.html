	<p class="article-leader">TULSA, Okla. -- Kinark Corp. said three directors have
been elected to its eight-member board, including two
candidates who opposed Kinark's nominees.
   Elected were Garry Brainin, chairman and president of
Altair Corp., and George B. Collins, Altair's assistant
secretary. But a third Altair candidate was defeated by
Kinark nominee Ivan Himmel, chairman of Chicago-based
Maritime Partners Limited Partnership. Maritime is Kinark's
second-largest stockholder, with 7.8% of the common shares,
while Altair is third, with 6.7%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Paul Chastain, Kinark's deputy chief executive officer,
said the Altair slate was pressing for more aggressive growth
by the company, which owns galvanizing plants and
chemical-storage facilities. The previous board rejected last
month an unsolicited $24.8 million offer from Steel Partners
Limited Partnership, but said it would consider additional
proposals. Mr. Chastain wouldn't comment on how the new board
would respond to such offers.</p>
<p>Messrs. Brainin and Collins couldn't be reached for
comment.</p>
