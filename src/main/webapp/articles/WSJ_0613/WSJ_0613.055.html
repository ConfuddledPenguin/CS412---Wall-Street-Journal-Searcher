	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Chevron Corp. jumped on the environmental
bandwagon, announcing a reformulated blend of unleaded
premium gasoline.
   Chevron's step follows recent product announcements by
other oil companies, including Shell Oil Co.'s April
introduction of a similar unleaded premium gasoline sold at
2,000 stations in nine cities. The trend started with
Atlantic Richfield Co.'s unveiling last August of a cleaner
fuel for older cars; that product is sold mostly in the Los
Angeles market.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Chevron's Supreme Unleaded is to be offered at 550
stations in Los Angeles and San Diego. Sales began at some
stations yesterday, replacing an existing premium brand. The
San Francisco-based oil company also plans to offer the new
fuel in Houston and Baltimore later this summer. The four
cities are among those the Environmental Protection Agency
said have the most severe air-quality problems.</p>
<p>Willis J. Price, vice president of Chevron and president
of its Chevron USA unit, said the new gasoline will cost
about two cents more a gallon to produce. He declined to say
if that cost would be passed to consumers.</p>
<p>Chevron officials said the new gasoline could reduce
hydrocarbon emissions 9% and carbon monoxide emissions 7% --
compared with gasolines currently on the market.</p>
<p>Chevron also announced a cleaner diesel fuel that will be
available at about 100 outlets in Southern California. The
new diesel product, which will replace the existing
formulation, will cost the company about one cent a gallon
more to produce.</p>
