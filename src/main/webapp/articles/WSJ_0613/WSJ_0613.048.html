	<p class="article-leader">Lawsuits filed by seven states contend Mobil Chemical Co.
exploited popular misconceptions by making environmental
claims for Hefty trash bags that it knew were false.
   The actions allege the unit of New York-based Mobil Corp.
claimed Hefty bags are "degradable" to obtain a marketing
advantage, even though documents show company officials knew
the bags wouldn't break down in landfills or help reduce
solid waste.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It's a myth that degradable products quickly disappear or
provide any benefits to the environment in a landfill -- and
Mobil knew it," says New York Attorney General Robert Abrams.</p>
<p>Mobil Chemical spokesman Allen Gray says the company
denies the allegations and will fight the lawsuits. "We have
scientific evidence fully substantiating our degradability
claims," Mr. Gray says. The company acknowledges plastic
Hefty bags won't break down fast enough in landfills to make
room for more garbage, but denies that its claims would
mislead consumers.</p>
<p>As previously reported, a task force of attorneys general
in seven states filed lawsuits to stop Mobil Chemical from
selling or distributing trash bags making degradability
claims. The states are also requesting fines totaling several
million dollars. No hearings have been scheduled, although
two states, New York and Wisconsin, have requested immediate
injunctions. In New York, Mr. Abrams is requesting warning
labels on existing inventory stating that Hefty "provides no
environmental benefit when disposed of in a landfill or
incinerated." State officials say a two-month to three-month
supply of Hefty bags with offending labels exist in several
states, including California. Hefty has about 25% of the
plastic trash bag market.</p>
<p>The New York lawsuit says Mobil Chemical's marketing
surveys found consumers would respond positively to
"degradable" bags because they believed they would "simply
disappear." Hefty bags contain an additive that makes plastic
break down faster after exposure to sunlight.</p>
<p>According to statements by Mobil officials included as
exhibits in the lawsuits, however, the company didn't believe
this attribute would help reduce solid waste. "The only time
photodegradability comes into play is when materials are on
the surface of the earth and can be reached by sunlight. If
these materials are buried in a sanitary landfill, then
photodegradability is not a useful additive," a Mobil
official said at a company-sponsored symposium on degradable
plastic and the environment, according to the suit.</p>
<p>In addition, the suit says degradation can harm the
environment by producing polluting byproducts.</p>
<p>In response to widespread criticism, Mobil agreed in March
to remove all environmental claims from Hefty packaging. But
the lawsuits complain that existing inventory is still being
sold and that Mobil has taken no steps to warn consumers. Mr.
Gray says new packaging, which makes no environmental claims,
is starting to reach stores and "soon" 25% of the Hefty line
will have it.</p>
<p>The lawsuits were filed in New York, California, Texas,
Minnesota, Wisconsin, Massachusetts and Washington. They
represent the first actions in a continuing investigation of
products claiming to be degradable, recyclable or otherwise
environmentally friendly.</p>
