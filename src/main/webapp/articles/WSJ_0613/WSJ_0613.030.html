	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- When the new television season begins this
fall, "Cop Rock" will serve up the bizarre tandem of
cops-and-robbers cum song-and-dance. Now advertising
executives must bet on whether the unlikely musical series
will be a daring breakthrough -- or a silly flop.
   Betting right is the tough part. "Cop Rock" is one of 35
new weekly series that will open in the fall on the three
major networks and their stepsister, Fox Broadcasting Co. Ad
agencies, now bracing to order $4.4 billion of commercials in
the annual summer ritual known as the "up-front market," are
trying to separate the future hits from the likely failures.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Choosing what is hot is tricky business in television, but
it will be more troublesome than usual this time around. Ad
executives must comb through more new series than ever, now
that News Corp.'s Fox network is adding a fourth and fifth
night of programming and nine new series. Moreover, in
picking the hits, advertisers previously had a safety net:
Ratings guarantees promised free spots when shows drew puny
audiences. But now the networks are trying to narrow the
scope of the guarantees; NBC yesterday made the latest move
in that direction.</p>
<p>Sticking with the hit shows from last season is safer, but
much more expensive. In the up-front market, expected to open
this week, a commercial in a new episode of ABC's "Roseanne,"
the No. 1 show last season, could cost $375,000 for 30
seconds -- enough to feed Roseanne's snotty kids until
they're well out of grad school. Spots in an unheralded new
series can go for a mere $60,000, with the outside chance
that the show will break through and draw millions of extra
eyeballs -- free eyeballs -- to sponsors' product-pushing
messages.</p>
<p>Just one problem: Ad agencies often guess wrong. Last
season, almost no one predicted the surprise success of CBS
Inc.'s real-life series "Rescue: 911." Most forecasters
hadn't expected the fast flop of the Mel Brooks comedy "Nutt
House" on NBC. And most everyone on Madison Avenue had
predicted "Chicken Soup" would be the next big hit, helped by
caustic comic Jackie Mason in the lead and by the time slot
following "Roseanne." But ABC killed it after only a few
weeks.</p>
<p>The vast majority of new shows die in their first season
on the air. Of 53 new series introduced by NBC, ABC and CBS
in the past year, only 13 were renewed for this fall, says
Steven Sternberg, a vice president at ad agency Bozell Inc.
By that measure, only eight or nine of the 35 new shows
premiering in September will still be on by the first
snowfall.</p>
<p>So which ones are the keepers? Ad agencies make their
picks by previewing the pilots, analyzing reams of ratings
data and studying the schedule as if it were a chessboard.
But now and then they resort to the fragile ways of gut
instinct and a frequently faulty crystal ball; anyone's guess
can be as good as theirs.</p>
<p>One of the few certainties is that viewers are more
fidgety-fingered and fickle than ever. The 1990-91 TV season
will be "the year of the remote control," says Susan
Auerbach, a group vice president at media buyer Vitt Media
International Inc. Viewers will flit to and fro and hither
and yon, she says, because they will have so many new shows
to sample, especially half-hour comedies for which they can
quickly get a feel. The zapping makes the "television
environment so erratic, so volatile, that viewing patterns
have become unpredictable," says Betsy Frank, a senior vice
president at Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising.</p>
<p>Only a few new series are consistently mentioned by ad
executives as possible hits next fall: an ABC clone of its
immensely popular series "America's Funniest Home Videos";
NBC's "Fresh Prince of Bel Air," starring a rap singer named
Wil Smith (of DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince); and
perhaps "Babes," a Fox comedy about three fat sisters sharing
a cramped apartment in New York City. The sisters will follow
spike-haired cartoon kid Bart Simpson on Thursday nights.</p>
<p>The probable flops are more plentiful and easier to pick
out, ad people say. "Hull St. High" on NBC, a unit of General
Electric Co., depicts students singing and dancing down the
halls of a Los Angeles high school. "That's hokey," says
Thomas Winner, an executive vice president at
Campbell-Mithun-Esty.</p>
<p>Nor do advertisers hold out much hope for the new NBC
drama that will follow "Hull St." on Sunday nights. "Signs of
Life" will depict illness from the patient's viewpoint. "It's
going to be dead on arrival," says Thomas DeWitt, president
of DeWitt Media Inc., a media-services firm.</p>
<p>Ad brass also say "The Flash," airing on CBS on Thursdays
opposite "The Cosby Show" on NBC and "The Simpsons" on Fox,
will disappear in a hurry. So might CBS shows "Uncle Buck,"
adapted from the movie of the same name, and "The Green
Machine," about an environmental crisis team.</p>
<p>But some ad executives cite several shows that could turn
out to be sleepers, catching on unexpectedly. CBS has "WIOU,"
about a local TV newsroom, which Paul Schulman of the
media-buying firm Paul Schulman Co. calls "excellent." NBC
may hit with something called "The Fanelli Boys," about four
grown Italian brothers living with their mama in New York,
says Bozell's Mr. Sternberg.</p>
<p>Then there's Fox's "True Colors," which takes up the
unusual topic of an interracial marriage. And ABC has "Going
Places," a Friday night comedy about a group of young TV
producers, created by the same team that produces the
network's three other comedies the same night.</p>
<p>Opinion is split on many other series, such as "Gabriel's
Fire" on ABC, a unit of Capital Cities/ABC Inc. The show,
starring actor James Earl Jones, is about a former "lifer"
who is freed from prison and works for a woman lawyer. Mr.
DeWitt calls the show "a natural" for ABC's Thursday night
lineup and says the competition on NBC, "Cheers," "is ready
to be knocked off." But others say James Earl Jones may be
too intense for a weekly visit into America's living rooms.</p>
<p>The ad industry is further divided on the chances for "Cop
Rock," made for ABC by respected producer Steven Bochco. Paul
Schulman says, "When you're watching and all of a sudden a
jury bursts into song singing `guilty,' it doesn't fit. You
just can't really enjoy it." Ms. Auerbach of Vitt Media says
interest in "Cop Rock" will wane quickly.</p>
<p>But DeWitt's Gene DeWitt counters that he expects "Cop
Rock" to work well. He notes that the producer's wife,
Barbara Bosson, who has had roles in previous Bochco shows,
plays the mayor in "Cop Rock." Mr. DeWitt figures it this
way: "I don't think Bochco's going to put his wife in a dud."</p>
