	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Sterling Drug Inc. agreed to pay $375,000 in
civil penalties to settle charges that it made false
advertising claims for its Midol brand pain reliever, the
Federal Trade Commission said.
   The commission said the New York-based drug manufacturer,
a unit of Eastman Kodak Co., claimed in advertisements in
1985, 1986 and 1988 that one of the active ingredients in
Midol is a muscle relaxant that relieves menstrual cramps. In
other advertisements that ran in 1986 and for a period after
November 1988, the company claimed the drug relieves all the
symptoms of a condition known as premenstrual syndrome, as
well as menstrual bloating or water retention.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>According to the FTC, the company didn't have reliable
scientific evidence to back the claims. The agency said the
company thus violated a commission order, that became
effective in 1985, prohibiting Sterling and several other
aspirin manufacturers from making baseless therapeutic claims
for their products. Aspirin is a principal ingredient of
Midol, which is sold over the counter.</p>
<p>Sterling also has agreed not to violate the FTC order in
the future. The company said it believes its claims were
adequately supported, but that it decided to sign the consent
decree rather than fight the FTC in court. It said all the
advertisements questioned by the commission have been
discontinued.</p>
