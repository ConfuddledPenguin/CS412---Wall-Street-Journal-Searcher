	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Japan's May trade surplus narrowed slightly from
the year before, but economists said the rate of decline is
slowing and the surplus may start to expand again in a few
months.
   The Finance Ministry said that the May surplus, measured
when goods pass through customs, dropped 16.6% to $3.13
billion from $3.76 billion a year earlier. In April, by
contrast, the surplus fell a sharp 51.4% from the year
before. Exports in May declined 0.9%, to $21.52 billion from
$21.7 billion. Imports grew at a slower pace than recently
posted, rising 2.4% to $18.38 billion from $17.95 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The trade surplus with the U.S. also narrowed, falling
11.4% to $2.44 billion from $2.76 billion in the previous
year. Exports to the U.S. dropped 4.5% to $6.82 billion, but
imports also fell 0.2% to $4.38 billion.</p>
<p>Ministry officials said that although Japan's global
surplus continued to shrink, "the amount of decline seems to
have narrowed." One reason for the slowdown, the official
explained, was falling oil prices. Higher crude-oil prices
last year made an important contribution to import growth. In
May, however, crude-oil prices dropped from the year before
to $16.79 per barrel from $18.02 a year earlier. So although
the volume of crude oil imports rose 3.1% to 16,200
kiloliters, imports in value terms dropped 4% to $1.71
billion.</p>
<p>Economists said the lower value of the yen against the
dollar was also putting a brake on the pace of decline in the
surplus. The ministry calculated that the dollar's average
exchange rate in May was 156.98 yen compared with 133.88 yen
a year ago. A weaker yen makes imports more expensive. At the
same time, the exchange rate makes the price of exports more
competitive in the world market.</p>
<p>Although the dollar-denominated value of exports dropped,
the volume of exports actually grew 8.4%, said Kazuko Mizuno,
an economist at Baring Securities (Japan) Ltd. Export growth
was especially high for motorcycles, rising 32.2% to $150.67
million, and ships, increasing 30.9% to $319.1 million.
Exports of office equipment, another area in which Japanese
companies are very competitive, also rose 8.9% to $1.54
billion.</p>
<p>Import volume, on the other hand, grew at a slower pace of
6.5%, compared with the average pace of 7.8% in 1989.
Although economists expect the surplus to continue narrowing
for a few more months, "this can't go on forever," said
Takayuki Tanaka, an economist for Japan's Long Term Credit
Bank. "The drop in the growth of imports may lead to an
expansion in the surplus," added Ms. Mizuno of Baring
Securities, possibly starting in August or September.</p>
<p>That would bring additional pressure to bear on the
Japanese government from the U.S. Recently, Japanese
officials have sparked a debate by asserting that although
Japan is committed to reducing its trade surplus further,
retaining an overall external surplus that allows Japan to
remain a capital exporter is essential to a healthy world
economy.</p>
<p>On a seasonally adjusted basis, the overall trade surplus
grew 6.9% in May from April to $3.41 billion from $3.19
billion. Adjusted exports grew 2.2%, to $21.48 billion from
$21.03 billion, while adjusted imports also grew 1.3%, to
$18.07 billion from $17.84 billion. Adjusted figures on a yen
basis showed a wider increase, with the surplus in May rising
37.2% from April to 656 billion yen from 479 billion yen.</p>
<p>In trade with the U.S., Japan's exports dropped in a
number of areas, in part because Japanese companies' American
factories supplied more and more U.S. demand, said Mr. Tanaka
of Long Term Credit Bank. In particular, exports of engines
fell 32.2% to $193.87 million from the year before, while
exports of semiconductors dropped 19.7% to $299.95 million.</p>
<p>The trade surplus with the European Community narrowed
26.4% to $1.2 billion. Exports increased 7.1% to $4.07
billion, while motorcycle exports rose 52.4% to $89.9
million. Meanwhile, imports from the EC rose 32.3% to $2.87
billion. The growth in imports was seen in cars, mainly from
West Germany, which doubled to $535 million. Imports of
alcoholic beverages rose 34.5% to $114.7 million, and Japan's
purchases of art from the EC countries doubled, reaching
$157.1 million in May.</p>
