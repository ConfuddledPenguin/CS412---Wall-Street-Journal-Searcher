	<p class="article-leader">WARSAW -- "There's too much work here, too much
paperwork," the foreign minister says, crossing his reception
room and taking a seat with his back to a picture of Cossacks
hunting in the snow.
   In striped shirt and bow tie, Krzysztof Skubiszewski is
what Poles call "the genuine prewar article." A scholar of
international law, he has little time for visitors and no
patience for a ministry full of Communist-drilled diplomats.
Visitors he can get rid of; diplomats he's stuck with.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I came to a ministry which was a tool of the Communist
Party," he says. "The personnel were not prepared to follow
everyday activity involved in my policy."</p>
<p>Among Eastern Europe's new faces, Mr. Skubiszewski's
doesn't shine. A 62-year-old bachelor, he hung back in
academe through Solidarity's revolution. But the dilemmas of
a newly freed Poland suit him; they look as prewar as he
does.</p>
<p>"We haven't got an easy position between the Soviet giant
and Germany, which soon will become another giant," he says.
"I would like to transform the difficulties of that position
into an asset." Behind in this lonely endeavor, he flees to
his pile of paper.</p>
<p>Through its years as a "captive nation," Poland starred in
the superpower struggle as the Soviet Union's greatest
foreign policy irritant and the West's greatest hope. Last
year, Solidarity came through, setting the pace for the fall
of the Soviet empire.</p>
<p>The West has swung its spotlight onto a reuniting Germany.
It gives Solidarity no end of advice on reinventing
capitalism. But at a turning point in Europe's history,
Poland's out-of-shape diplomats have to reinvent foreign
policy on their own.</p>
<p>Having walked the Moscow line for decades, every one of
Eastern Europe's liberated countries faces the same task: to
find a place for themselves in the new order their
revolutions made possible.</p>
<p>Diplomats of the European Community, North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, the "four powers" and the two Germanys are
racing up one summit and down the next this year. The foreign
ministries of Hungary, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Romania and
Poland are panting to keep up.</p>
<p>South of here, the less strategic countries of Russia's
late empire can let the heavy diplomatic traffic roll by. Or,
like Czechoslovakia's president Vaclav Havel, they can toss
around grand designs for universal peace. Poland can't.</p>
<p>Mr. Skubiszewski's history-laden turf is too vital for
such fancies. A unifying Germany to the west and a
splintering Soviet Union to the east threaten to recreate
Poland's old role as a battered buffer state. Yet its
diplomats have little more hope than in 1939 of throwing real
weight.</p>
<p>"Poland is too big to say whatever it likes," says
political commentator Kostek Gebert, "but too small and too
weak to have any decided political clout."</p>
<p>The Foreign Ministry's building in Warsaw seems as drowsy
today as it did before September, when Mr. Skubiszewski moved
in. But upstairs, a few people have begun to work hard.</p>
<p>Shadowy types at the Communist Party's Central Committee
used to make all the decisions. They took orders from the
Soviets. "They told us their opinion -- but it was understood
as an instruction," says Jerzy Nowak, who has stayed on as
head of policy planning. Lowly foreign ministries didn't get
involved.</p>
<p>That's over. The Party is through, the Central Committee
vacant. Foreign ministers finally sat in for party chiefs at
a Warsaw Pact meeting this year. The Soviets, accustomed to
speaking first, spoke last. They wanted the Pact to oppose
the West's demand that a unified Germany join NATO. The
others said NATO can have Germany. For the first time, the
Soviet Union was isolated within its own alliance.</p>
<p>For Poland, taking that stand was new and brave. Up to
now, its security has come from the East. The alternatives
aren't obvious, and the public debate that helps Western
democracies solve their dilemmas has barely begun here.</p>
<p>The Polish policy establishment consists so far of a tiny
think tank in the Senate. Otherwise, Mr. Skubiszewski
sketches tactics freehand. "There is a group that has the
minister's trust," says Artur Hajnicz, the think tank's head.
"Apart from them, there are a lot of people who cannot be
replaced and cannot be trusted either."</p>
<p>Of 400 diplomats in the ministry and 600 abroad, nearly
all stayed in the Party until its last gasp in January. A
Solidarity newspaper says a good number moonlighted for the
secret police, and probably still do.</p>
<p>Yet not one has been dismissed. Poland needs diplomats.
Mr. Skubiszewski has to trust the ones he has to obey his
golden rule: Don't let ideology blur your idea of the
national interest.</p>
<p>Poland's interest, as he sees it, is to end Europe's split
"into the poor and schizophrenic East, and the rich and
rational West." But on a recent trip to Czechoslovakia, he
watched even that simple hope run into a roadblock.</p>
<p>Czechoslovakia's president, Vaclav Havel, had called a
summit in Bratislava's hilltop castle to ask whether the
East's freed nations could coordinate their "return to
Europe." When the Poles arrived Mr. Havel threw bear hugs
around his old comrades in dissidence. But when they heard
what he had to say, their spirits fell.</p>
<p>Mr. Havel read out his list of Eastern Europe's mutual
concerns and never said a word about Germany, Poland's
bugaboo. Nor did he mention Lithuania or the Soviet Union.
Poland, he hinted, might feel more at home with the Baltic
states, not those along the Danube.</p>
<p>"I have no obsession with Germany," Mr. Skubiszewski said
at day's end. But the Poles left feeling that in
post-communist Europe they would remain caught in their
custom-made cage.</p>
<p>"Poland is out," says Mr. Gebert, the Polish commentator.
"If Lithuania gets independence, all they'll remember is that
the Poles didn't endorse them; if we did, from Moscow's view
we'd be exporting revolution. On the south, we're blocked by
the new Hapsburgs. And on the German question, we have
absolutely no allies."</p>
<p>Not that Poland hasn't looked. From the moment they
learned unification talks had been set, its leaders have
sought a say on Germany's war-making powers, and a guarantee
of Poland's western frontier. But at the unity talks, which
have now begun in earnest, it's plain that good relations
with Germany, not Poland, top everyone's list.</p>
<p>Poland will take part in the round of talks set for July,
and have a say on its border -- but that's all. "It's nothing
like negotiating pressure," Mr. Gebert says. "We don't have
that."</p>
<p>Now Mr. Skubiszewski has begun to speak of Poland and
Germany finding a "community of interests." The Germans are
happy to start looking. In Warsaw's Foreign Ministry, a few
of the apparatchiks are willing to help.</p>
<p>"I belong to the old regime," admits the the policy
planning chief, Mr. Nowak. "Some of us were purely cynical.
Some, like me, were pragmatic. I realized that the chances of
pursuing our own interests were limited. I waited 30 years
for this. For the first time in my life I can speak, act and
think -- the Polish way."</p>
