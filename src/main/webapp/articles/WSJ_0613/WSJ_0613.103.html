	<p class="article-leader">The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., known as Freddie
Mac, revamped its mortgage securities program to meet
increasing competition from its chief rival, the Federal
National Mortgage Association, called Fannie Mae.
   Freddie Mac has been losing market share, because many
investors and lenders viewed its securities as inferior to
Fannie Mae's. Both Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are
government-sponsored, publicly traded companies that dominate
the secondary mortgage market. They buy loans from lenders
and package them into securities for sale to investors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Freddie Mac said that beginning with mortgage securities
issued in October, the gap between the time homeowners make
monthly mortgage payments and when investors receive their
payments from Freddie Mac will be shortened to 45 days from
75 days. Fannie Mae's mortgage securities have a 55-day
payment delay.</p>
<p>The new securities, called Gold PCs, for participation
certificates, will pay investors actual mortgage prepayments,
not estimated prepayments. And Freddie Mac will guarantee
investors the timely payment of principal and interest, even
if mortgage servicers fail to make the payments.</p>
<p>Barney Buscemi, vice president, structured finance and
investor marketing, said the company had been studying how it
could meet investor needs better, and came up with the Gold
PC program. The company's objective, he said, is to raise the
security price, pleasing both investors and seller-servicers
who are motivated by price.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the part of Freddie Mac's earnings derived from
the short-term float will be reduced, while income from
guarantee fees will rise. Guarantee fees, Mr. Buscemi said,
not only are a more stable source of income, but also are
easier for analysts and others to predict.</p>
<p>"We didn't simply want to mimic Fannie Mae," Mr. Buscemi
said. "We designed a superior product."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Peter Treadway, an analyst at Smith Barney,
Harris Upham & Co., said Freddie Mac had been slipping in
product development. "What you're seeing is that the company
is coming back to life," he said.</p>
<p>At the same time, Freddie Mac announced that Citicorp
Mortgage Inc. agreed to swap $5 billion of single-family
mortgages in exchange for Gold PCs over the next year -- a
record transaction for the secondary market.</p>
<p>Mr. Buscemi said that Freddie Mac doesn't know how many
holders of its securities will convert to the Gold PCs, but
that liquidity of the old securities won't be hampered. The
company, which has nearly $290 billion of mortgage securities
outstanding, will give investors the option of converting to
Gold PCs for a fee. About one-third can't be converted,
because they are held for collateral for derivative
securities such as Remics, or real estate mortgage investment
conduits. A Remic is a type of security authorized by the
1986 tax law; underwritten by Wall Street firms, Remics
provide a method of dividing up the income flows from many
mortgages into new securities with various interest rates and
maturities to attract banks, insurers and other big investors
to the home-mortgage market.</p>
