	<p class="article-leader">IBERIA-AMERICAN DISPUTE</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Iberia, Spain's national airline, said it is withdrawing
today from Sabre, the computerized reservation system of AMR
Corp.'s American Airlines unit, despite possible sanctions
from the U.S. Department of Transportation.</p>
<p>The move may result in a sharp drop in Iberia's U.S. sales
if other U.S. companies ban Iberia from their computerized
reservation systems, Iberia officials said. By pulling out of
Sabre in Spain, Iberia automatically is barred from using the
system in the U.S., forcing the company to seek alternative
sales outlets there, the officials said.</p>
<p>The dispute broke out late last year after Iberia
announced its decision to withdraw from Sabre to protest what
it called the system's unfair trade practices in Spain. An
Iberia official said Sabre "dumped" its services in Spain by
offering its computers free of charge to all travel agencies
meeting a minimum sales quota on its reservation system.
Iberia's booking company, Savia, charges clients a yearly fee
to rent a computer terminal.</p>
<p>Iberia officials said the carrier will take its case to
the U.S. courts if it is excluded from other reservation
systems.</p>
<p>ARRESTS IN CAMBODIA</p>
<p>The human-rights group Asia Watch expressed concern over
the arrests in late May of at least six senior government
officials and army officers in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. All are
suspected of trying to form a new political party, Asia Watch
said. "These men were apparently trying to take advantage of
a changed international climate and move Cambodia toward a
multiparty system," said an Asia Watch official. "It looks
like they may have jumped the gun."</p>
<p>There were 3,000 registered nurses in Trinidad and Tobago
in 1987; since then, some 1,200 have quit. Registered Nurses
Association spokeswoman Yvonne Pilgrim said the flight of
nurses, attributed to early retirement or better-paying jobs
in North America, has caused a dramatic shortage of nurses in
area hospitals. She made her remarks to explain a one-week
protest by Trinidad nurses last week over working conditions
and salaries.</p>
<p>FRANCE'S FAST TRAINS</p>
<p>France plans to spend 190 billion French francs ($33.3
billion) to expand its high-speed-train network 2,200 miles.
Transportation Minister Michel Delebarre said the expansion
would require construction of 400 new engines. The project
requires approval by regional officials, Mr. Delebarre said.
Winegrowers already have protested plans to lay tracks for
the high-speed trains through prized vineyards in southern
France.</p>
<p>FIGHTING PHILIPPINE POVERTY</p>
<p>Philippine President Corazon Aquino launched a movement to
combat poverty and denied it was intended as a political
force to fight for her re-election in 1992. In an
Independence Day speech yesterday, Mrs. Aquino said the
Kabisig ("Arm in Arm") movement was designed to speed up
grass-roots projects aimed at improving living standards. She
said the movement would be spearheaded by cabinet ministers,
provincial governors and mayors and community organizations.</p>
<p>VENICE BOWS OUT</p>
<p>Italy gave in to a world-wide protest and withdrew Venice
as a candidate to be the site of the Expo 2000 world fair.
The decision was announced to parliament by Prime Minister
Giulio Andreotti yesterday. Tomorrow, a Paris-based
organization meets to select the host city for the world
fair; the other two candidates are Hanover, West Germany, and
Toronto. Venice lovers around the world had argued the city
would collapse under the strain of accommodating hordes of
extra tourists if the fair were staged there.</p>
<p>JAPAN'S SAGGING BIRTHRATE</p>
<p>Quoting unnamed cabinet sources, a Japanese news agency
reported that Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto suggested
the trend for Japanese women to obtain higher education is
responsible for the nation's sagging birthrate.</p>
<p>The agency said the suggestion was part of a cabinet
discussion yesterday about ways to encourage women to bear
more children. Government officials are reportedly alarmed at
statistics showing that Japan's birthrate hit an all-time low
of 1.57 children per woman in 1989, down from 1.66 babies per
woman in 1988.</p>
<p>Mr. Hashimoto was quoted as suggesting that the government
alter its policy of enabling all students who so desire to
pursue higher education so that Japan won't suffer shortages
in the labor force.</p>
<p>At a news conference, Chief Cabinet Secretary Misoji
Sakamoto said the government is hoping to reverse the sharp
birthrate decline because otherwise the welfare burden for
Japan's aging society will be difficult to manage.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>More than 180 past Nobel Prize winners have accepted
invitations to celebrate the Nobel Foundation's 90th
anniversary in Sweden and Norway in 1991, the organization
said. They include U.S. economist Milton Friedman, British
author William Golding and Mother Teresa of Calcutta. . . .
The Times of London revised its style guide for the first
time since the 1960s. The newspaper will now permit such
contemporary terms as the title "Ms.," which will be
automatically used in references to U.S. women but only in
special cases for other nationalities.</p>
