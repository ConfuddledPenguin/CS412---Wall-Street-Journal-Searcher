	<p class="article-leader">NEW ORLEANS -- For the 12th consecutive year, a
fundamentalist was elected president of the Southern Baptist
Convention.
   At the denomination's annual meeting, the Rev. Morris
Chapman of Wichita Falls, Texas, received 21,471 votes, or
57.7% of the total, to defeat the Rev. Daniel Vestal of
Dunwoody, Ga., who received 15,753 votes, or 42.3%. Mr.
Vestal was the candidate of the convention's moderate
faction, which has accused the fundamentalists of launching a
purge of Southern Baptist seminaries and other organizations,
targeting persons who don't accept a literal interpretation
of the Bible.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A recent Page One story in The Wall Street Journal
described how the struggle between the two factions had led
to a decline in active membership, seminary enrollment and
appointment of missionaries in the denomination, which claims
to be the largest Protestant body in the U.S.</p>
<p>A total of 38,241 clergy and lay people registered at the
New Orleans convention, making the gathering the third
largest in Southern Baptist history, after the 1985
convention in Dallas and the 1986 convention in Atlanta.</p>
