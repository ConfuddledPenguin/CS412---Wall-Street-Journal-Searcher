	<p class="article-leader">HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Chrysler Corp. and Renault S.A.
said they agreed to terminate their joint venture to produce
a new mini-sport utility vehicle because the venture "is no
longer economically attractive."
   The U.S. and French auto makers didn't provide much detail
about why they are scrapping the venture, but persons
familiar with the deal say it was plagued with problems and
unanswered questions.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>One of the biggest problems was just how well the little
Jeeps, codenamed "JJ," would sell. When the venture was
established in 1989, Chrysler said U.S. sales might reach
100,000 a year. "Clearly, the way that market is performing,
there is no way it could support that many units," said
Christopher Cedergren, director of competitive assessments at
J.D. Power & Associates, a California market research firm.</p>
<p>This is partly because of increasing competition from
products such as General Motors Corp.'s Chevrolet Geo
Tracker, Daihatsu Motor Co.'s Rocky, and Suzuki Motor Co.'s
Samurai and Sidekick.</p>
<p>In addition, consumers seem to prefer larger sport utility
models including Chrysler's Jeep Cherokee and Ford Motor
Co.'s Explorer. As a result, Chrysler isn't the only U.S.
auto maker to rethink plans for little sport utility
vehicles. Mr. Cedergren said Ford scrapped about a year ago a
mini-Jeep-like vehicle codenamed "UW52."</p>
<p>It isn't clear whether Chrysler will abandon JJ
completely. In a statement, the No. 3 U.S. auto maker said it
"intends to continue" with the project and is "reviewing
various implementation alternatives." But a spokesman said JJ
is "still iffy. . . . We aren't going to build any vehicle we
can't make money on."</p>
<p>One Chrysler executive said the U.S. auto maker had
recently taken a "fresh business look" at the venture in the
wake of the mid-May resignation of international operations
vice president Michael N. Hammes to take a top job at Black &
Decker Corp.</p>
<p>Chrysler officials were said to be concerned about several
issues. One involved Chrysler's ceding four key markets to
Renault, including France and Italy. In addition, Chrysler
wanted to build the four-door version first; Renault favored
the two-door.</p>
<p>The manufacturers budgeted $500 million for the venture
but neither would say how much they've actually spent. The
Chrysler spokesman said Chrysler will reimburse Renault for
expenses incurred during the feasibility study but he
wouldn't be more specific.</p>
<p>The initial agreement called for JJ to be built in North
America and Europe and sold world-wide, with European
deliveries estimated at 50,000 a year. European production
was to begin in July 1992, with North American output
following about six months later.</p>
<p>In February, the companies said they had chosen a Renault
factory in Valladolid, Spain, as the European source.
Chrysler hadn't confirmed the North America location, but
Chrysler's Toledo, Ohio, Jeep plant was expected to get the
job.</p>
<p>A United Auto Workers union spokesman said union members
at the plant ratified a tentative contract Monday that would
keep the plant open until 1997. The contract includes a
commitment from Chrysler that if JJ is built in North
America, it will be built in Toledo. But the tentative
contract is contingent on "a lot of ifs," the UAW spokesman
said.</p>
