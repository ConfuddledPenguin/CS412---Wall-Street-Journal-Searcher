	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Yields on certificates of deposit at major
banks and brokerage firms were little changed in the week
ended yesterday.
   Average yields on small-denomination CDs sold directly by
banks were down slightly. The average yield on a one-year
consumer CD went to 7.87% from 7.93%, while five-year CDs
fell to 8.11% from 8.15%, according to an 18-bank survey by
Banxquote Money Markets, an information service.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"There was no significant move in interest rates, so rates
remained in a holding pattern," said Norberto Mehl, Banxquote
chairman.</p>
<p>While none of the banks in the survey offered a yield as
high as 9%, investors can still find consumer CDs at some
banks yielding that much or more.</p>
<p>Average yields on most small-denomination CDs sold by
leading broker-dealers were up slightly. Two-year maturities
were the exception, with the average yield down to 8.30% from
8.35%. Average yields on six-month CDs rose to 8.27% from
8.22%, while average yields on five-year CDs went to 8.51%
from 8.43%, according to Banxquote.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, average yields for large-denomination CDs,
which typically require deposits of $90,000 or more, were
largely unchanged. Average yields on one-year jumbo CDs edged
up to 7.98% from 7.97%, while five-year maturities eased to
8.25% from 8.28%.</p>
