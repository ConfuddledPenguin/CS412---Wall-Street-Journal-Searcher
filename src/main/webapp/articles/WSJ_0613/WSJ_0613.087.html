	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Two House members introduced legislation
that would switch oversight of stock-index futures to the
Securities and Exchange Commission from the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission.
   The bill was introduced at the administration's request by
Reps. John Dingell (D., Mich.) and Norman Lent (R., N.Y.),
the ranking members of the Energy and Commerce Committee,
which oversees the SEC.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The bill would give the SEC the power to regulate
stock-index futures, which allow investors to bet on the
movement of a basket of stocks without buying the actual
securities. The bill also would create federal regulation of
futures margins, the good-faith money needed to trade.
Currently, margins are set by the commodities exchanges and
can be changed by the CFTC only in an emergency.</p>
<p>The legislators haven't taken a formal position on the
proposal, a committee spokesman said. The legislation is
supported by SEC Chairman Richard Breeden and Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady, but it is strongly opposed by CFTC
Chairman Wendy Gramm, the futures industry, and members of
the House and Senate agriculture committees.</p>
<p>In a statement, Mr. Dingell said that the complex
legislation warranted "careful, thorough and detailed
hearings" and that his committee intends to begin the process
as soon as possible.</p>
