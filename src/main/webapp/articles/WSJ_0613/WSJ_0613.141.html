	<p class="article-leader">Sweden's Stora AB said its pretax profit in the first four
months of the year tumbled 22% to 1.12 billion kronor ($183
million) from 1.43 billion kronor a year earlier, dragged
down by increased competition and unfavorable cost trends.
   The forestry giant said group sales dropped 1.7% to 13.61
billion kronor from 13.84 billion kronor. Excluding the
effects of corporate acquisitions and divestitures, sales
increased 366 million kronor, or 3%, it said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Stora said in a forecast that the relative profit decline
is expected to remain for all of 1990. It said, however, that
it expects its profit to pick up once the effects of its
recent acquisition of West German chemicals and engineering
concern Feldmuehle Nobel AG become noticeable.</p>
