	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Exxon Corp. said a natural gas discovery in
Latimer County, Okla., about 13 miles southwest of Wilburton
tested at rates of about 40 million cubic feet of gas a day
through a one-inch choke with a flowing tubing pressure of
1,470 pounds a square inch.
   The oil and energy company holds a 66% working interest in
the well. Chicago-based oil and energy concern Amoco Corp. is
the other major partner, with 33%.</p>
