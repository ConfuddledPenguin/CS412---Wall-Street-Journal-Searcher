	<p class="article-leader">OMAHA, Neb. -- No doubt about it, ConAgra Inc. isn't a
sexy company. It mills flour, corn and oats, sells fertilizer
and frozen foods, and raises chicken, beef and even the lowly
catfish. Its chairman is a balding, overweight, aw-shucks
kind of guy. Its corporate history is titled, "ConAgra Who?"
   Which is exactly what many people were asking last week
when ConAgra agreed to buy Beatrice Inc. for $1.34 billion,
in a deal that would solidify its position as the nation's
second largest food-processor, behind Philip Morris's Kraft
General Foods.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In fact, its unassuming chairman, Charles M. Harper, has
over the past 16 years quietly built ConAgra into a
food-industry giant with $15 billion in revenue and 10
straight years of earnings increases. A share of ConAgra
bought for $3 in 1974 when Mr. Harper took over would now be
worth -- following stock splits -- $430.</p>
<p>ConAgra's stock has even gone up since the Beatrice deal
was announced, unlike the usual case, when the acquiring
company declines on the news. That's partly because the
proposed Beatrice acquisition would strengthen ConAgra's
supermarket fare -- notably the frozen-food brands Banquet,
Chun King, Healthy Choice and Kid Cuisine -- with Beatrice's
Hunt's tomato products and Wesson cooking oils. It also would
give ConAgra the strong grocery-store distribution network it
now lacks.</p>
<p>So far, ConAgra's success has been based on a relentless
quest for new food-business acquisitions, giving the company
enough diversity to protect it from cyclical downturns. By
"operating across the food chain," a favorite saying of Mr.
Harper's, ConAgra has benefited from various trends in the
food business -- even some the company never anticipated.
"We're not smart enough" to specialize in any single food
business, says the chairman.</p>
<p>For example, ConAgra's commodity trading operations
established an enviable toehold in Eastern Europe, buying
fertilizer from the Soviet Union and selling grain to the
Soviets and other East bloc countries, long before the fall
of Eastern European communism. Analysts say the company is
now positioned to take advantage of the new openness there,
and last fall it began selling poultry to the Soviet Union
and Romania.</p>
<p>Mr. Harper's modesty belies what is an extremely
aggressive operating style. The 62-year-old chairman, who
also stands six feet, six inches tall, monitors this rapidly
expanding conglomerate with unusual attention to detail.</p>
<p>Built into the wall behind his desk is a setup resembling
an air traffic controller's work station, with a microphone
jutting out over a computer screen and rows of digital
clocks. This apparatus allows Mr. Harper to beam himself into
ConAgra's many operating units, where each week he grills
operating managers on their progress in meeting targets in
sales, profits and inventories.</p>
<p>Mr. Harper is one to buck convention in his personal life
as well. He likes to tool around Omaha in a bright red
Corvette complete with a "fuzz-buster" just in case any of
the city's finest should seek to monitor his speed.</p>
<p>Assimilating Beatrice will pose the second biggest
challenge yet to Mr. Harper's tenure, rivaled only by the
near-bankrupt status he found the company in when he joined
in 1974.</p>
<p>Assuming the Beatrice deal closes, Mr. Harper, who has
specialized in small acquisitions that let him keep debt
quite low, will lead a company with more debt than its used
to and nearly 16,000 more employees (bringing the total to
70,000).</p>
<p>The Beatrice deal would also put 15% of the company's
stock in the hands of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., the
leveraged buy-out firm which owned Beatrice -- and which, in
recent years, hasn't hesitated to protect its investments or
pursue a hostile buy-out. KKR says it would treat its ConAgra
stake as a long-term investment.</p>
<p>Despite the risks, Mr. Harper felt such an acquisition was
vital given the growth-through-acquisition of rivals like
Philip Morris, which have beefed up their distribution
capability and gained valuable control of store shelf space.
The Beatrice acquisition also recoups Mr. Harper's loss when
he was outbid last year for a major acquisition, Holly Farms
Corp., by Tyson Foods Inc.</p>
<p>For a moment last week, it seemed the Beatrice deal could
be in jeopardy too. Last Thursday morning, halfway through
the ConAgra board meeting called to consider the acquisition,
a tornado warning was issued for Omaha. Mr. Harper
reluctantly halted the meeting and herded the directors into
a stairwell. "Uh oh," thought Robert J. White, a ConAgra vice
president, "here comes an act of God." The tornado, however,
missed Omaha.</p>
<p>The company hasn't always had such good fortune. It began
in 1919 as Nebraska Consolidated Mills Co., four small mills
that went public in an undersubscribed stock offering that
brought in $840,000. Early forays into consumer goods didn't
work out. Nebraska Consolidated started up the Duncan Hines
cake mix line, but lacking the marketing muscle to take it
national, was forced to sell the brand to Procter & Gamble in
1956.</p>
<p>In the early 1970s, ConAgra suffered big futures-market
losses when it tried to hedge its soybean-meal inventories,
used to feed broiler chickens. When Mr. Harper became chief
executive in 1974, many on Wall Street didn't think the
company would last very long.</p>
<p>Mr. Harper had other ideas. The son of a one-time bank
examiner, he grew up in South Bend, Ind., got an engineering
degree and went to work for the Oldsmobile division of
General Motors. After five years, though, he looked at the
many-layered GM organizational chart and grew discouraged. "I
figured I could become CEO of GM when I was 347 years old,"
Mr. Harper says.</p>
<p>He jumped to Pillsbury Co., helping to modernize plants,
and soon moved up to run several businesses, including a big
poultry operation. Pillsbury sold the business in 1973, and
Mr. Harper, who friends say was at odds with senior
management, was offered a variety of jobs he found less
appealing.</p>
<p>"Life was not too joyous for him at Pillsbury" after the
sale of the poultry unit, says Seymour Levy, an industrial
psychologist who met Mr. Harper while doing consulting work
for the Minneapolis food company. Mr. Levy introduced Mr.
Harper to another friend who was on the board of ConAgra.</p>
<p>Once in charge of ConAgra, Mr. Harper quickly sold assets
to reduce its crushing debt load, even while formulating a
goal of widespread diversification.</p>
<p>Wall Street scoffed. Eric Gleacher, an investment banker
Mr. Harper had hired when he was at Pillsbury, had never
heard of ConAgra at the time, and says he was among those who
didn't expect the company to last long. Securities analysts
weren't interested in the company, so Mr. Harper traveled
from town to town in the Great Plains talking up the company
to individual stockbrokers.</p>
<p>Mr. Harper soon started buying businesses and trying to
develop new ones. The basic stuff -- such as milling
operations -- worked out fine, but some of the fancier ideas
flopped. Taco Patio, a chain of Mexican fast-food outlets,
bombed. And Bow Wow -- "the dog food dogs ask for by name" --
never took off, despite having the Peanuts comic strip
character Snoopy as its spokesdog.</p>
<p>Bow Wow did bring one benefit, however. In about 1978, a
dog-food broker in St. Louis told a ConAgra executive that
RCA Corp. wanted to sell Banquet Foods, the big frozen-dinner
company. RCA wanted more than $200 million, which no one was
offering. Mr. Harper decided to bide his time and wait for
the price to drop. In 1980, RCA accepted his $55 million cash
and stock offer.</p>
<p>Banquet was cheap for a reason. It lacked new products,
and it had a full year's inventory of frozen fried chicken,
much of it on the verge of spoiling. But with a bigger budget
for advertising and for new products, Banquet turned around
quickly, and paid for itself by 1984.</p>
<p>One early large-scale acquisition that got away from Mr.
Harper was a Wichita meatpacking firm then named MBPXL. In
1978, ConAgra had a signed agreement to acquire the firm in a
stock swap, but Cargill Inc., the big Minneapolis grain
processing firm, swooped in and bought MBPXL, later renamed
Excel. The deal cemented Cargill's No. 2 position in
meatpacking, one which ConAgra has since overtaken.</p>
<p>The Cargill acquisition scenario replayed itself last year
when Tyson, already bigger in the poultry business than
ConAgra, paid $1.29 billion to outbid ConAgra for Holly
Farms. The loss of that deal infuriated the chief executive,
and to tweak him, ConAgra executives and their spouses all
wore Tyson's corporate colors -- khaki, red and white -- to a
party last fall.</p>
<p>The events leading up to the Beatrice move began in 1988
when Mr. Harper met Henry Kravis, the deal-maker who at the
time was buying RJR Nabisco Inc. Mr. Kravis needed a
well-regarded executive to run the huge company, and Mr.
Gleacher, then head of mergers and acquisitions at Morgan
Stanley & Co., suggested the ConAgra man. It never reached
the point of an offer, says Mr. Harper. "I thought there had
to be something in it for the ConAgra shareholder," he says.</p>
<p>But Messrs. Harper and Kravis got along well, and their
needs dovetailed in the Beatrice agreement. Mr. Kravis wanted
a tax-free deal for his investors, one that was at least 50%
stock rather than all cash, which would have been taxable.
That was good for ConAgra, too, which needed to issue stock
anyway to keep its debt-to-equity ratio from going too high
as a result of the purchase. Mr. Gleacher, who now heads his
own firm, put together the deal.</p>
<p>One concern analysts have about the acquisition is how
ConAgra will fare after Mr. Harper, who plans to step down in
September 1992 at age 65. They credit him not only for his
takeover acumen but for his spirited leadership.</p>
<p>In 1987, for example, he publicly threatened to move the
company's headquarters to another state unless Nebraska
legislated some big tax breaks. He won, after a nasty
political battle, and sought to mend fences the next year by
performing at an Omaha press-club dinner. Dressed up like
Gen. Patton, he sang to the tune of "America the Beautiful":</p>
<p>"In Omaha, in Omaha</p>
<p>That's where we want to be</p>
<p>You paid the price to keep us here</p>
<p>Instead of Tennessee."</p>
<p>ConAgra is using the tax breaks to build a new
headquarters on the edge of downtown here, a sprawling campus
of buildings connected by tunnels.</p>
<p>Mr. Harper recently elevated Philip B. Fletcher, an
experienced consumer products executive who came to ConAgra
in 1982, after stints at Campbell Soup Co., Heinz, and
Heublein, to the post of president and chief operating
officer. Mr. Harper says he is trying to share his job more
with Mr. Fletcher, 56, who is expected to succeed him.</p>
<p>In recent years, Mr. Harper "has fought off a tendency to
micro-manage," says Mr. White, the ConAgra vice president. A
heart attack Mr. Harper suffered five years ago "made him
focus on the necessity to not be overinvolved in things," Mr.
White says.</p>
<p>And the heart attack yielded even more direct benefits for
ConAgra. Once a heavy smoker, big eater and lover of spicy
foods, Mr. Harper changed his habits, forgoing beef and
convalescing on his wife's turkey chili. The experience led
Mr. Harper to launch a line of low-salt, low-calorie frozen
dinners. Now the "Healthy Choice" line is one of ConAgra's
most successful, albeit bland, new products.</p>
