	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Sterling rose following a report that the U.K.
Treasury favors making Britain a full member of the European
Monetary System as early as September or October. The dollar
ended trading mixed.
   The report in the London Financial Times, which quoted
senior figures involved in government discussions on the
topic, also said the British government would strive to
negotiate a relatively high EMS entry level for the pound.
The Financial Times didn't specify a level.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A wide EMS trading range that would allow fluctuations of
as much as 6% rather than the standard 2.25% is an additional
goal of U.K. authorities, according to the report. Market
predictions for the pound's entry level have ranged between
2.60 marks and 2.90 marks. The pound, which currently
fluctuates independently of the EMS exchange rate structure,
is now trading near the top of that range.</p>
<p>The dollar, meanwhile, was moderately higher against the
mark and a bit lower against the yen in activity muted ahead
of the release beginning today of a series of U.S. economic
indicators.</p>
<p>The market seized on the EMS news as a good reason to buy
the British currency, which already was favored for its
comparatively high interest rate returns, market participants
said. Traders have long maintained that the U.K. currency's
resiliency in the face of poor economic fundamentals has
stemmed from the attractiveness of relatively high British
interest rates. Base U.K. interest rates are currently at
15%.</p>
<p>"The fact that someone is naming months" gives the market
the impression that there is a planning process under way,
whereas market enthusiasm for the pound's full entry into the
EMS previously was restrained by confusion about timing, said
Susan Babcock, vice president of corporate foreign exchange
at Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. in New York.</p>
<p>Entry is seen as positive for the pound based on the
reasoning that a preset trading band for sterling would
enforce discipline on British monetary authorities and
obligate other EMS central banks to support the currency.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the Financial Times report, U.K.
Chancellor John Major reiterated that inflation remains an
obstacle to full British EMS membership, but the market
didn't pay much attention. Inflation currently is expected to
reach an annual rate of 10% by fall.</p>
<p>Late in New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6965
marks, up from 1.6930 marks late Monday. The U.S. currency
also was quoted at at 154.55 yen, down from 154.77 yen.
Sterling was trading at $1.7035, up from $1.6860 late Monday.</p>
<p>In Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar was trading at 154.80 yen
soon after opening at 155.08 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S.
currency was trading at about 1.6970 marks, up from Tuesday's
Tokyo close of 1.6900 marks.</p>
<p>U.K. Chancellor Major said that reduction of inflation
must precede full EMS membership for the pound, the same
position he has taken in the past. Market participants said
the comment, though discounted, did create hesitation to push
the British currency over long-term resistance at $1.7075, a
level it didn't approach in world trading yesterday.</p>
<p>In addition to rising against the dollar, the pound
recorded strong gains against the mark and yen.</p>
<p>The dollar strengthened modestly against its West German
counterpart on continued nervousness about the domestic
German cost of unification. The potential impact of Soviet
opposition to a united Germany's membership in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization also weighed on the mark,
traders said.</p>
<p>Conversely, the yen stopped the dollar's recent advance.
The Japanese currency was propped up by market sentiment that
there is some room for the Bank of Japan to increase interest
rates, said Charles Spence, a vice president of foreign
exchange at First Interstate Bank of California in Los
Angeles.</p>
<p>The Japanese currency is receiving additional support from
a market consensus that the Japanese economy is performing
well despite concern about rising inflation and the stability
of financial markets there, Mr. Spence said.</p>
<p>"As long as the promise of higher rates is there, it keeps
people from bashing a currency," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Spence and Ms. Babcock of Hongkong & Shanghai noted
that trading of the dollar was slowed by anticipation of a
slew of U.S. economic indicators scheduled for release
beginning today.</p>
<p>The report today on U.S. retail sales for May isn't likely
to have a big impact on trading unless it's much different
from expectations, market participants said. Retail sales for
last month are estimated to be unchanged from April.</p>
<p>The market is much more interested in the release tomorrow
of the U.S. producer price index for May and Friday's
announcement of May's consumer price index. Those reports are
being watched for their potential impact on U.S. interest
rates following last month's weak jobs growth, traders said.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $355.70 an ounce, down 70 cents.
Estimated volume was a light 2.5 million ounces.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was quoted at $354.50 an
ounce.</p>
