	<p class="article-leader">RENFRO VALLEY, Ky. -- There's an identity crisis brewing
in this quiet backwater town 50 miles south of Lexington.
   The trouble began when a group of well-heeled investors
bought the trademarked and copyrighted property of the late
John Lair, who 51 years ago established the Renfro Valley
Barn Dance, Kentucky's version of the Grand Ole Opry.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The investors contend that the purchase gives them
exclusive use of the Renfro Valley name for a new $12 million
country-music theme park they're constructing. And to protect
their rights, the investors, Renfro Valley Folks Inc., have
told townspeople that only attractions associated with the
park may continue to use the name Renfro Valley.</p>
<p>For the four existing businesses in town that already use
the name, that could mean drop it -- or else. The businessmen
say they've received a letter from the investor group
threatening legal action unless they change the name of their
stores and remove paraphernalia that displays the name Renfro
Valley.</p>
<p>The businessmen, who have consulted a Washington, D.C.,
law firm, are steamed. "They didn't buy the whole valley,
they just bought a piece of it," snaps Willard Collinsworth,
the 64-year-old proprietor of the Renfro Valley Country
Store.</p>
<p>And his wife, Aline, adds: "I think it's terrible. These
local businessmen have been here for many years, and now
these people are just coming in trying to take over. They
just don't care about the little people."</p>
<p>Not true, says Ralph Gabbard, president of Renfro Valley
Folks. He contends that the whole town would benefit from the
project -- a 110-acre theme park that would be a sort of
cross between Opryland U.S.A. and Walt Disney World. Most
townspeople support the plan because of the jobs it would
bring.</p>
<p>And though Mr. Gabbard promises to resolve the dispute in
a "peaceful way," he insists the businessmen are fighting a
losing battle.</p>
<p>Maybe so. Joe Allen, owner of the Renfro Valley Record
Store, concedes that for the moment all the local businessmen
can do is "wait and worry." But while he initially painted
over the Renfro Valley in his store's name, he has now
restored the original wording.</p>
<p>"They're multimillionaires. They intend on running us
little independent people out," Mr. Allen says, defiantly
adding: "We can't give in."</p>
