	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Thinking of investing abroad? Fasten your seat
belt.
   Stock-price gyrations in the U.S. in recent years have led
to outcries from investors and prompted inquiries by the New
York Stock Exchange and others -- yet the U.S. has actually
been one of the world's least volatile markets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We look very stable when compared with the rest of the
world," says John Markese, executive vice president and
director of research at the American Association of
Individual Investors in Chicago.</p>
<p>U.S. stock prices have been less volatile over the past
five years than have prices in such major markets as Japan,
West Germany, Britain and France, according to statistics
compiled by Morgan Stanley Capital International, a unit of
Morgan Stanley & Co. And in the past 12 months, the U.S.
market has been less volatile than 18 of the 19 other markets
in the firm's survey; only Canada has seen smaller price
moves in that time.</p>
<p>This shouldn't deter investors from thinking globally,
though. Another set of Morgan Stanley numbers shows that even
though U.S. stock prices now are at near-record levels, most
other stock markets have offered higher returns than the U.S.
since 1985, at least in dollar terms.</p>
<p>Over the five years ended May 31, the U.S. market ranked
next to last among 18 major world markets in total investment
return, measured in U.S. dollars. Over the past 12 months,
the U.S. market's 16.9% gain pales by comparison with
Austria's 114.6% surge or West Germany's 61.7% increase. Many
investment advisers expect that returns overseas, especially
in Europe, will continue to exceed those in the U.S. over the
next decade.</p>
<p>Moreover, adding foreign stocks to the mix can actually
reduce the volatility of a portfolio that was invested
exclusively in the U.S. That's because foreign price moves
tend not to closely track those in the U.S.: When stocks in
the U.S. zig, foreign stocks often zag.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, for example, investors with 70% of their
money in U.S. stocks and 30% in foreign stocks enjoyed both a
higher return and lower overall volatility than investors
with 100% of their money in U.S. stocks, according to Rowe
Price-Fleming International Inc., a joint venture of T. Rowe
Price Associates Inc. in Baltimore and Robert Fleming Group
in London.</p>
<p>Still, a few foreign markets are so mercurial that even
some professional investment managers now are steering clear.</p>
<p>One example is Hong Kong, by far the most volatile market
over the past year among the 20 in Morgan Stanley's index.
Hong Kong's investment returns also trail those of most other
markets, reflecting fears about last year's turmoil in China
and what will happen in 1997, when Hong Kong is due to revert
to Chinese control.</p>
<p>Some money managers think fears about Hong Kong are
exaggerated, but many others remain skeptical. "I personally
am scared," says Maurits E. Edersheim, deputy chairman of
Smith Barney, Harris Upham International Inc. and chairman of
the Fenimore International Fund. "I am scared Mr. Deng
{Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping} will say something about Hong
Kong that could jolt the market overnight." Fenimore doesn't
own any Hong Kong stocks.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't touch Hong Kong," agrees Claire B. Benenson of
New York, a director of four mutual funds. "It's much too
volatile."</p>
<p>Several money managers are leery of other countries, such
as Australia, whose stock markets have combined high
volatility with mediocre returns over the past few years.
Australia's market was the fifth most volatile over the past
five years, but its total return ranked fifth lowest.</p>
<p>Americans who invest overseas need to pay close attention
not only to international stocks but also to currency
markets, says Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs
International, a unit of Goldman, Sachs & Co.</p>
<p>"That's extremely important," he says, because even the
smartest international stock picks can be whipsawed by
unexpected exchange-rate movements. "When you buy foreign
stocks, you're betting that they will go up in their home
market, that their national currency will go up against the
dollar, or both," he says.</p>
<p>For many individual investors, the easiest way to play the
foreign stocks game is through mutual funds, which offer
professional management and diversification. Some
international funds have turned in dazzling results in recent
years. For example, Fidelity Investments' Fidelity Overseas
fund ranked No. 1 among all types of mutual funds in the five
years ended March 31, according to Lipper Analytical Services
Inc. Its total return was 304%.</p>
<p>Some investors are turning to global index funds, set up
to replicate broad market indexes spanning many countries.
Index funds have grown increasingly popular in the U.S.
because of their low costs and because they have outperformed
most of their rivals in recent years.</p>
<p>But the choices are small for those seeking global index
funds. Colonial Group in Boston offers such a fund, which now
holds about 600 non-U.S. stocks. And Vanguard Group recently
announced plans to start a global index fund this month.</p>
<p>The Vanguard fund offers investors three choices. One
portfolio is designed to match the performance of a Morgan
Stanley index of European stocks. Another is set up to
replicate an index of Asia-Pacific stocks. The third is
supposed to match a broad world-wide index, excluding the
U.S. Each portfolio has a minimum initial investment of
$3,000.</p>
<p>Investors should also realize that an index doesn't
automatically guarantee broad diversification. Vanguard's
portfolio for the Asia-Pacific region seeks to mimic a Morgan
Stanley index that consists mostly of Japanese stocks. That
would have been a bad choice in this year's first quarter,
when Japanese stocks plunged.</p>
<p>To reduce its dependence on Japanese stocks, Colonial
International Equity Index Trust switched to a different
Morgan Stanley index based on the size of each nation's
economy, a Colonial portfolio manager says. Nevertheless, the
fund still was hammered in the first quarter by Japan's stock
plunge.</p>
<p>"There will be periods of underperformance" by index
funds, says Brian S. Mattes, a vice president at Vanguard.
"But the longer period of time you look at, the better they
look."</p>
<p>How much of an investor's portfolio should be overseas?
"There's no hard and fast formula," says Madelynn Matlock,
director of research at Bartlett & Co., an investment
management firm in Cincinnati. Among the major factors are
the investor's age, how much is to be invested, what the
investor's other holdings are and the person's risk
tolerance.</p>
<p>For Americans with less than $500,000 to invest, it's
probably wise to limit the plunge into foreign markets to
"about 10% or 15% of their holdings," Mr. Edersheim of Smith
Barney says.</p>
