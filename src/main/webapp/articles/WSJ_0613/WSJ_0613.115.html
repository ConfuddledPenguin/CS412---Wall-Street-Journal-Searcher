	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. has raised about
$1.7 billion in cash from its investors that it plans to
inject into RJR Nabisco Inc. to try to bolster RJR's sagging
bonds, according to people familiar with the proposed
transaction.
   KKR, which quietly raised the money from investors in its
$5.6 billion leveraged buy-out fund this week, hopes that the
cash infusion, together with other financial restructuring
moves, will cause $6 billion of RJR Nabisco junk bonds to
rise above their current depressed trading levels. In raising
the $1.7 billion, KKR was drawing upon previous commitments
by its investors to the $5.6 billion fund.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>If the RJR Nabisco junk bonds rally, that will make it
easier for KKR to fulfill a requirement that it reset the
interest rate on the bonds to make them trade at their face
value, or par, no later than next April.</p>
<p>Bonds of the largest RJR issue in question, which traded
at prices below 60 cents on the dollar earlier this year,
rallied late yesterday to close at 69.375 cents on the
dollar.</p>
<p>The main result of the new cash infusion is likely to be
lower overall returns for investors in KKR's leveraged
buy-out fund. But if the financial restructuring of RJR is
successful, it will allow RJR to avoid paying extremely high
interest rates on the reset bonds in the future.</p>
<p>Though RJR's basic businesses recently have performed
well, the company's junk bonds have been depressed by concern
about the company's heavy debt load and general weakness in
the junk bond market.</p>
<p>Spokesmen for RJR Nabisco and KKR declined to comment on
the planned equity infusion.</p>
<p>KKR took the food and tobacco giant private last year in a
record $25 billion leveraged buy-out.</p>
<p>KKR hasn't yet completed all the details of the financial
restructuring moves it will take to deal with the reset bond
problem, according to people familiar with KKR. However, the
moves are likely to include new bank loans, if attractive
terms can be arranged, and may include an offer to buy back
the reset bonds from holders or to exchange them for newly
issued bonds, these people said.</p>
<p>People familiar with the RJR transaction said that
investors in KKR's $5.6 billion leveraged buy-out fund each
were asked to deliver their share of the new $1.7 billion
cash infusion by last Monday. In addition to the new money
from the outside investors, KKR itself may also invest a
small amount of additional money.</p>
<p>KKR's fund originally invested $1.5 billion to help
finance the RJR buy-out. While a new equity investment would
more than double the amount of the original investment,
several people familiar with the transaction said that RJR's
financial performance had proved so strong since the buy-out
that KKR's institutional investors still expected to obtain a
return of 20% to 30% a year on their investment in RJR.</p>
<p>Such returns would rank the RJR buy-out as significantly
less successful than many of KKR's earlier and much smaller
buy-outs, which once generated annual returns of nearly 80% a
year. For the moment, however, KKR's investors seem pleased
with RJR's prospects.</p>
<p>"All their major investors are very happy," said one
person involved in the RJR fund-raising. "They are going to
be earning up to 30% on absolutely huge amounts of money," he
said of the big investors.</p>
<p>The investors in KKR's LBO fund include insurance
companies, pension funds, endowments and other large
institutions. As limited partners in the LBO fund, these
partners have no control over the investment decisions taken
by KKR.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, KKR takes pains to keep its partners
informed on its investments. In May, for example, KKR's
investors were invited to a portfolio review meeting in San
Francisco at which KKR partners painted a glowing picture of
RJR's cash flow and other financial barometers.</p>
<p>KKR further smoothed the way for adding new equity to the
RJR deal last week by selling Beatrice Cos. to ConAgra for
$1.34 billion in cash and stock, plus the assumption of
Beatrice debt. The sale price was less than originally hoped,
but still provided KKR investors returns of about 50% a year
while KKR owned Beatrice.</p>
<p>The RJR recapitalization is expected to involve several
phases; the structure and timing of each step will depend in
large measure on the market reception given to the reset
bonds after the previous step.</p>
<p>"There is going to be a plan for everything, but it is
evolving," said one person familiar with KKR's preparations
to deal with the RJR reset notes.</p>
<p>KKR has some flexibility in deciding how to deal with the
reset problem. Although the deadline for determining a reset
rate is next April, KKR can reset the interest rate at any
time before that. The exact rate must be agreed upon by
investment bankers representing KKR and by Lazard Freres &
Co. and Dillon Read & Co., which were the investment banking
firms representing the former publicly traded RJR Nabisco.</p>
<p>Although the firms must agree that the new interest rate
on the bonds would cause the bonds to trade at their full
face amount, there isn't any requirement that the bonds
actually trade at that price.</p>
<p>If the RJR bonds don't rally, KKR could be forced to reset
interest rates at 20% or more. While those rates wouldn't
necessarily cripple RJR, it would severely depress the
profits for KKR and its investors, and would send a
disturbing message to the junk bond market, which has viewed
RJR Nabisco as one of its strongest credits.</p>
