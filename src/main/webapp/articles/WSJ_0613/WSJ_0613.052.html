	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Federal regulators said first-quarter
earnings at the nation's banks dropped 14% to $6.23 billion
from $7.25 billion a year earlier, and warned that problems
with real-estate loans are increasing in the Midwest and
Northwest, adding to the well-documented woes of the
Northeast.
   The earnings decline was mostly attributable to large
provisions that banks set aside for possible losses on
real-estate loans, said Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
Chairman William Seidman.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Despite the real-estate situation, the first quarter's
earnings were a rebound from meager net income of $2.1
billion in the fourth quarter of 1989 and a loss of $603
million in the third. "It's not a bad result, given all the
real-estate problems," Mr. Seidman said.</p>
<p>Results for the first quarter included $5.76 billion set
aside for possible loan losses, an increase of more than $2
billion from the year-earlier quarter. Federally chartered
banks in the Northeast set aside $1.2 billion, more than
triple the provision in the first quarter of 1989. Regulators
have been sweeping through New England banks, pushing them to
take write-downs and provisions for losses.</p>
<p>The FDIC's report showed that woes from real-estate loans
are becoming a bigger problem for banks throughout the
country. Overall, the percentage of noncurrent real-estate
loans -- those that are 90 days overdue or on which banks
aren't earning interest -- rose in all but 11 states. In
particular, banks in the Midwest and Northwest are joining
those in New England in showing troublesome increases in
noncurrent real-estate loans.</p>
<p>In Ohio, such loans rose to 2.17% of all real-estate loans
at the end of the first quarter, from 1.89% at the end of
1989. In North Dakota, the figure jumped to 2.38% from 1.78%.
Washington, Montana and Colorado also registered increases,
as well as Utah.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, noncurrent real-estate loans dropped
significantly in Texas, to 6.76% at the end of the first
quarter from 10.34%. They also fell a bit in Arizona, to
11.18% from 11.8%, though that is still the highest in the
country.</p>
<p>Regulatory scrutiny of the real-estate situation is sure
to increase, because real-estate loans are currently the
biggest single category of bank lending and continue to show
the fastest growth. Banks ended the first quarter with $770.7
billion in real-estate loans outstanding, up 11% from last
year's first quarter. That increase accounted for about 94%
of total loan growth during that period.</p>
<p>The FDIC also revised its report of fourth-quarter bank
earnings to reflect restatements made by Northeast banks
because of problems from real-estate loans. The revised net
income of $2.1 billion originally was reported as $2.68
billion. Third-quarter results, originally reported as a $744
million loss, were restated because of other adjustments to
show a $603 million loss.</p>
