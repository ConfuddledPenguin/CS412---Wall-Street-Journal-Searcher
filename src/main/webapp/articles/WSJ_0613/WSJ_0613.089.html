	<p class="article-leader">Ask Americans what nation has the strongest overall
economy, and they'll tell you Japan. Ask Japanese the same
question, and they'll say the United States.
   Who's right?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>By most measures, the U.S. remains the world's economic
powerhouse. Its annual output is nearly twice that of Japan.
And while the Japanese may be the leaders in many important
manufacturing industries, U.S. businesses remain, overall,
the most productive in the world.</p>
<p>To be sure, the Japanese have in recent years reported a
higher income per person than Americans. But that's a
statistical fluke, due largely to the dollar's decline since
1985. Income in Japan is higher only if the Japanese exchange
all their money for dollars and spend it overseas. If they
spend money in their own country, the advantage is quickly
devoured by exorbitant prices for housing and other goods.
Adjusted for local purchasing power, the average Japanese
earns only three-quarters as much as the average American.</p>
<p>But while the U.S. remains in the lead, that lead is
rapidly narrowing, and many economists believe it may
disappear over the next decade.</p>
<p>Hisao Kanamori, chairman of the Japan Center for Economic
Research, is one of the leading Japanese optimists. Sitting
in his corner office in downtown Tokyo, a pipe in his hand,
he confidently predicts Japan will grow at roughly a 5%
annual rate during the 1990s, while the U.S. grows at about a
3% rate. The result: By the year 2000, Japan will have an
economy roughly the same size as America's, and its
per-person income will be nearly double that in the U.S.</p>
<p>That's a stunning prediction, but it isn't without reason.
Many economists see savings and investment as the engines of
future growth, and in both areas the Japanese continue to
beat the U.S. hands down. Last year, for instance, Japanese
households saved nearly 17% of their after-tax income,
compared to just over 5% in the U.S. And Japanese businesses
had gross investment equalling 26% of the nation's output,
compared with 15% in the U.S.</p>
<p>Moreover, Japan's edge in many high-tech industries will
help fuel its growth in the coming decade, Mr. Kanamori says.
"The things that Japan is strong at are the things of the
1990s," he notes.</p>
<p>Official estimates put Japanese growth over the next 10
years considerably lower. And lately, in the wake of turmoil
in the Tokyo stock market, some commentators have begun to
argue that the Japanese miracle is over. "My perception is
that Japan is now at its peak in terms of industrial power,"
says Akira Kojima, an editorial writer for the Nihon Keizai
Shimbun, the major Japanese business daily.</p>
<p>Eager to calm American fears, Japanese government
officials also push the notion that Japan has peaked --
especially when they are speaking to overseas visitors. The
savings rate is slowly declining, they say, and young people
lack the vigorous work ethic of their elders. Moreover, a
rapidly aging population will be a drag on the economy in the
coming years.</p>
<p>"The Japanese days are over," says Tadashi Nakamae, an
economic consultant who is among the most pessimistic. He
says Japanese manufacturers will soon find they have
"invested too much," and as a result face excess capacity.
And they won't be able to sell their products overseas, he
says, without competing with their own overseas subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Mr. Kanamori dismisses such concerns. "The government's
position is too conservative," he says. "The government is
always too conservative." As for the problem of an aging
population, the 66-year-old economist says that can be eased
by letting people work longer.</p>
<p>If history is any guide, Japan's anxiety over its economic
future may prove one of its great strengths. The Japanese
have always worried that their economic strength is a fragile
blossom, ready to blow away with the wind. As a result,
they've worked harder to preserve it.</p>
<p>During the oil-price spikes of the 1970s, for instance,
the Japanese fretted that their oil-dependent economy had met
its match. But the oil crisis only prompted them to make
their manufacturing industries more fuel-efficient.</p>
<p>And when the yen rose sharply in the mid-1980s, making it
harder for the Japanese to sell their exports around the
world, they again worried about the beating their
manufacturers would take. But in the end, after cost-cutting
and new productivity campaigns, the Japanese emerged stronger
than ever.</p>
