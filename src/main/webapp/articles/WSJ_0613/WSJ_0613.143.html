	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The number and value of continental European
companies targeted for mergers and acquisitions more than
doubled in the first quarter from a year ago, a financial
data-base company said.
   IDD Information Services, a unit of United Newspapers PLC
of Britain, said the number of continental European companies
selected for acquisition in the first quarter rose to 715
from 319 a year ago. The value of the transactions increased
to $18.4 billion from $7.3 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The reason for the increase is largely due to continental
European companies' shift in focus from the U.S. to their own
markets, in preparation for the unification of the European
market in 1992, IDD said.</p>
<p>The information service also found that the value of
transactions in Britain increased, although the number of
transactions decreased. In the 1990 quarter, 513 U.K.
concerns were targeted for acquisitions valued at $17.8
billion. That compares with 560 U.K. concerns valued at $11.8
billion.</p>
<p>IDD said the number of targeted companies in Europe and
Britain for the first time exceeded the number in the U.S.,
which was 1,054 companies. The value of the U.S. transactions
was $62 billion.</p>
<p>The number of continental European companies targeted by
U.S. companies increased to 34, from 26. But their total
value declined to $77.5 million from $210.5 million, IDD
said.</p>
