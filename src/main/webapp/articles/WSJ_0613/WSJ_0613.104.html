	<p class="article-leader">Sarah Flores is one step away from becoming the first
Hispanic elected to the Los Angeles County Board of
Supervisors since 1875. But she is caught in a Catch-22: The
November runoff election she is favored to win is likely to
be canceled by a federal judge. Reason: He believes her
district was intentionally gerrymandered so that no Hispanic
can be elected.
   The stakes are big. Los Angeles County supervisors oversee
a $10 billion budget and an area more populous than that of
42 states. Mrs. Flores says that while the districts were
gerrymandered to protect the incumbents of both parties who
drew them, her first-place showing in last week's election
proves an Hispanic can win.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>You'd think Hispanic leaders, the ACLU and the other
liberal groups who sued to overturn the districts would agree
with her and now ask the judge, who has already ordered new
district lines, to delay elections under them until 1992. But
no, they want to throw out last week's election results,
dramatically change Mrs. Flores's constituency and hold new
elections.</p>
<p>They contend that even if Mrs. Flores wins, it doesn't
settle their claim that Hispanics would still not have
elected a candidate of their choice to the board. "The Voting
Rights Act protects communities, not candidates," says ACLU
attorney Mark Rosenbaum.</p>
<p>Mrs. Flores says that the Constitution, a higher law, was
meant to protect individuals. She says she is one of the most
qualified candidates to ever run for supervisor, having
worked her way up in county government from secretary to a
top deputy for a county supervisor. Last week she won 65% of
the Hispanic vote and 35% overall -- 15 points ahead of her
runoff opponent, a conservative Anglo judge. Why then are
liberals trying to pull the electoral rug out from under her?
Her backers believe it's because she's a Republican who would
continue conservative control of the board.</p>
<p>"These same liberal groups are silent on gerrymandering
when it protects liberal incumbents," says Ron Smith, a
Flores campaign consultant. "When it comes to gerrymandering
they don't like, they want to invalidate elections and hold
new ones so a minority they want wins instead of someone they
can't control." As with Bush Justice Department appointee
William Lucas last year, liberals have a big stake in cutting
down any minority individual who dissents from their dogma.
Otherwise, minorities might start straying from the Liberal
Plantation or Barrio.</p>
<p>Gary Mendoza, a lawyer for Mrs. Flores, wants federal
Judge David Kenyon to let voters decide in November on
expanding the board from five to seven members. That would
make the drawing of a majority Hispanic district much easier.</p>
<p>Judge Kenyon, a Jimmy Carter appointee, appears likely to
deny that request. One day before Mrs. Flores's first-place
finish, he struck down the existing districts saying "an
Hispanic candidate is unable to be elected to the Board under
the current configuration of supervisorial districts." When
Mr. Mendoza tried to argue at a hearing that Mrs. Flores's
showing proved an Hispanic could win under the old lines,
Judge Kenyon cut him off. "I don't want politics in here,"
the judge snapped.</p>
<p>But if gerrymandering is clearly all about politics, then
so too would be a judicial decision to throw out Mrs.
Flores's showing in a district where Hispanics are already
47% of the population. Gerrymandered districts are a major
obstacle to effective democracy, but selective court action
to invalidate some map-making abuses while overlooking others
is little more than a shameless attempt to grant backdoor
political power.</p>
