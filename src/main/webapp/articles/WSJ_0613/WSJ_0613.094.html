	<p class="article-leader">Macmillan Inc., a New York-based unit of Maxwell
Communication Corp. in London said it acquired 51% of an
Israeli publisher and bookseller, Keter Publishing House Ltd.
Terms weren't disclosed, but a spokesman for Macmillan said
Keter Publishing has annual sales of between $12 million and
$15 million.
   A spokesman said Keter, a major Israeli publisher, also
owns about 34 bookstores in Israel. It is 75%-owned by Clal
Ltd. of Israel, which will maintain a 24% interest in Keter.
Macmillan said that most of Keter's books are published in
Hebrew, but more will now be translated into English and
distributed by Macmillan in the U.S. The spokesman said
Maxwell is negotiating to buy additional publishing
properties in Israel.</p>
