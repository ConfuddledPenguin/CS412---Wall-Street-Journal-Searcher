	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Harold F. White
approved the appointment of Barry L. Zaretsky, a Brooklyn Law
School professor and counsel to the international law firm of
Kelley Drye & Warren, as examiner in the Revco Drugstores
bankruptcy case, according to the law firm.
   Appointment of an examiner in the case was requested by
U.S. Trustee Conrad J. Morgenstern.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The law firm said that Prof. Zaretsky, with Kelley Drye as
his counsel, will investigate the failed $1.25 billion
management-led leveraged buy-out of the 2,000-drugstore
chain. It was the first major junk-bond-financed LBO to enter
Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code under which a company is
given protection from creditors while it tries to work out a
plan for paying its debts.</p>
<p>Prof. Zaretsky will seek to determine whether the Revco
LBO involved fraud and is to submit a preliminary report July
16.</p>
<p>The law firm said that if Prof. Zaretsky's investigation
finds that the LBO was fraudulent and if the courts
ultimately uphold such findings, it would further jeopardize
junk-bond-financed LBOs as a method of corporate acquisition.
The law firm added that if fraud is found in the Revco case,
it could retroactively call into question billions of dollars
of LBO debt outstanding.</p>
