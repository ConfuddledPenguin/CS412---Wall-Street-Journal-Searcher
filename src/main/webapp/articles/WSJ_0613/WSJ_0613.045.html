	<p class="article-leader">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- The Massachusetts Institute of
Technology's executive committee recommended that Charles M.
Vest, provost of the University of Michigan, be named
president of MIT.
   If his nomination is approved, Mr. Vest, a 48-year-old
specialist in optics and former dean of Michigan's
engineering school, would be MIT's 15th president. He would
succeed Paul E. Gray, who is scheduled to resign in July to
become chairman of MIT's governing board.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Vest is MIT's second choice for the prestigious post.
Earlier this year, the committee nominated Philip A. Sharp, a
prominent MIT biologist, to be president, but after a few
days, he withdrew his name from consideration, choosing to
continue his research and teaching.</p>
<p>The nomination of Mr. Vest is subject to a vote by the
65-member MIT Corp., the school's governing body.</p>
