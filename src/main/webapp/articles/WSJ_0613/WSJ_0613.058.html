	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Financial distress at British & Commonwealth
Holdings PLC is forcing the sale of its U.S. subsidiary,
Oppenheimer Management Corp., which manages $14 billion in
mutual funds.
   Oppenheimer, which is one of the country's 20 largest
mutual fund companies, manages more than 40 mutual funds sold
largely through financial planners. (The firm isn't related
to Oppenheimer & Co., the U.S. securities firm.)</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A management group, led by Oppenheimer President Jon S.
Fossel, is putting together a bid for the company. But
British & Commonwealth's investment banker, S.G. Warburg &
Co., said at least 10 companies in Europe and the U.S. have
expressed an interest in acquiring Oppenheimer.</p>
<p>"Management is one of the potential buyers," said Alistair
Defriez, a corporate finance director with S.G. Warburg in
London. "But it's by no means clear that the management
proposal is the one that will succeed."</p>
<p>The planned sale, which was first reported in Fund Action,
a mutual fund industry newsletter, is part of a larger effort
by British & Commonwealth to raise $2 billion to pay off
debt. British & Commonwealth, a United Kingdom financial
services group, has been looking to sell assets since April,
when it was forced to write off more than $900 million in
losses at another subsidiary, Atlantic Computers PLC. Earlier
this month, the firm entered "administration," the U.K.
equivalent of Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law proceedings.</p>
<p>Shortly before the 1987 stock market crash, British &
Commonwealth acquired Oppenheimer Management from another
British firm, Mercantile Holdings. "I think, given how well
the company has done, it is likely to be sold at a
substantial gain," said Michael Goldstein, an analyst with
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.</p>
<p>"I heard {a price for the planned sale of} $150 million,
but that seems like a very low figure to me," said Stanley
Egener, president of New York's Neuberger & Berman Management
Inc. Mr. Egener noted that a purchase price of $150 million
is barely more than 1% of Oppenheimer's assets under
management. "The last few sales I've seen have been closer to
2% than 1%. But who knows what the Brits are doing?" Other
observers put the likely purchase price at closer to $200
million.</p>
<p>Mr. Egener speculates that if the fund group isn't bought
in a management-led leveraged buy-out, then it will probably
be acquired by a company not currently involved in the fund
industry.</p>
<p>In terms of mutual fund performance, "they have
consistently scored as being very, very mediocre," said Tyler
Jenks, chief investment analyst with Kanon Bloch Carre & Co.,
a mutual fund research firm in Boston. "But they are getting
better," he added. Kanon Bloch gives high ratings to
Oppenheimer Gold & Special Minerals and Oppenheimer Global
funds.</p>
<p>The fund business saw a flurry of acquisitions last year.
In 1989, Criterion Group Inc. was bought by Transamerica
Corp., and Keystone Management and Federated Investors were
purchased in management-led leveraged buy-outs. Since the
stock market crash of 1987, many other mutual fund company
acquisitions have been rumored, but few have gone through.</p>
