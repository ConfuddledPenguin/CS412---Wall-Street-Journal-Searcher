	<p class="article-leader">GF Corp., Youngstown, Ohio, said it sold most of the
assets of its GF Furniture Systems Inc. unit to C.T. Ten, an
affiliate of Tang Industries Inc., a Chicago-based steel
concern. The price wasn't disclosed.
   GF Corp. and GF Furniture filed for protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankrutcy Code last
April, after failing in earlier efforts to sell the furniture
business. At the time of the filing, GF said it had agreed in
principle to sell most of its assets to a Tang affiliate.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The new company will operate under the name GF Office
Furniture Ltd. It operates plants in Gallatin, Tenn., and
Chicago. General management, sales and marketing operations
are in Youngstown, where GF Furniture recently closed its
original manufacturing plant.</p>
