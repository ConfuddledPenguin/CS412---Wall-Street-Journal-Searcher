	<p class="article-leader">Federal prosecutors and securities regulators are seeking
to block a scheduled appearance by Michael R. Milken before a
House subcommittee later this summer, government officials
said.
   The House Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee voted
unanimously last month to subpoena Mr. Milken, the former
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. junk bond wizard, and offer him
immunity in exchange for his testimony. A subcommittee
official said Mr. Milken's testimony will likely be held
before Aug. 3, when the House is scheduled to begin recess.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Prosecutors are concerned that Mr. Milken's testimony
could interfere with his accord with them in April, when he
pleaded guilty to six felony counts relating to securities
and tax fraud and agreed to pay $600 million in fines and
restitution. Until Mr. Milken is sentenced by U.S. District
Judge Kimba Wood in Manhattan, he has the right to withdraw
his plea agreement and go to trial.</p>
<p>Government officials said that if the plea bargain
collapses, it would become more difficult for prosecutors to
indict Mr. Milken on expanded charges, because the government
would have to show that new evidence didn't derive from
testimony for which Mr. Milken received immunity.</p>
<p>SEC officials and prosecutors also worry that Mr. Milken's
testimony prior to sentencing may convince his sentencing
judge to be lenient and might impede the government's
investigation of individuals who were associated with Mr.
Milken.</p>
<p>As a result of these concerns, the officials said the
Securities and Exchange Commission and prosecutors from the
U.S. attorney's office in New York and the Department of
Justice in Washington, D.C., are seeking to prevent the
subcommittee from calling Mr. Milken to testify before he is
sentenced on Oct. 1.</p>
<p>Justice Department officials have notified the
subcommittee that they will object to the subpoena. Any
subpoena would have to be approved by a federal judge, and
Justice Department officials could be heard in opposition to
such a subpoena.</p>
<p>Alan Cohen, chief of the Manhattan U.S. attorney's
office's securities fraud unit, said yesterday "it would be
inappropriate for me to comment" on the dispute. Officials of
the SEC declined to comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Milken's lawyer for the subcommittee hearings, Stuart
E. Eizenstat, said it's Mr. Milken's "position that if he is
granted full immunity, he will testify and comply with any
subpoena." Mr. Eizenstat, a partner at the Washington law
firm of Powell, Goldstein, Frazer & Murphy, served as
executive director of the White House Domestic Policy Staff
under President Jimmy Carter.</p>
<p>The subcommittee and the full Energy and Commerce
Committee, which must approve the immunity grant, are headed
by Chairman John Dingell (D., Mich.). Mr. Dingell said, "I
assume that the U.S. attorney has dealt with the Milken case
to the fullest extent of his business. If we were informed
that there would be additional criminal proceedings against
Mr. Milken, the subcommittee would be strongly motivated to
respect that position. But if they've completed their work in
the criminal proceedings, there's no reason for the
subcommittee not to proceed."</p>
<p>Subcommittee officials said that before they hear from Mr.
Milken, they will first take testimony from Fred Carr,
chairman and chief executive officer of First Executive
Corp., and Ivan F. Boesky, the convicted former stock
speculator whose 1986 guilty plea led to the government's
investigation of Drexel and Mr. Milken.</p>
<p>Mr. Carr is scheduled to testify on Monday and won't be
seeking immunity. Subcommittee officials are negotiating the
terms of Mr. Boesky's testimony and no subpoena has yet been
issued to him.</p>

<p>SMITHKLINE SUES Bolar and its former president for fraud.</p>
<p>The civil racketeering suit, filed in federal district
court in Philadelphia, accuses Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. of
fraudulently obtaining federal regulatory approval for a
generic version of SmithKline Beecham PLC's Dyazide
blood-pressure medicine. Seeking treble damages of
unspecified amount, the suit also names as defendants Schein
Pharmaceutical Inc. and Vitarine Pharmaceuticals Inc.</p>
<p>Bolar's troubles have been big news since last summer,
when Congress widened its inquiry into how certain
generic-drug companies won U.S. aprovals for their versions
of Dyazide. SmithKline's suit alleges that Bolar and its
former president, Robert Shulman, deliberately deceived
regulators by submitting false testing data that represented
as Bolar's generic product what was actually a batch of
SmithKline's Dyazide.</p>
<p>Bolar, which is based in Copiague, N.Y., received FDA
approval for marketing its generic drug in August 1987.
SmithKline's Dyazide had annual sales of about $320 million
in 1987. Those sales plunged 52% in 1988 because of the
generic competition, the suit alleges.</p>
<p>Bolar repeatedly has denied any wrongdoing. A spokeswoman
said the company hasn't seen the suit and couldn't comment.
She added that Bolar's version remains off the market along
with most of its other drugs.</p>

<p>JUDGE IN DREXEL CASE will require joint disclosure of
reorganization plans.</p>
<p>The unusual arrangement ensures that both Drexel Burnham
Lambert Group Inc. and its creditors' committee will be kept
at the starting gate until Nov. 15. Under the judge's
arrangement, which is expected to be finalized this week,
Drexel's and the creditors' respective reorganization plans
wouldn't be disclosed until then.</p>
<p>In federal bankruptcy court in Manhattan, Judge Howard
Buschman III said that under the agreement, Nov. 15 will also
be the deadline for most claims against Drexel to be filed.
Judge Buschman said a goal of the arrangement will be for
hearings on approving a reorganization plan to begin next
February.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, a debtor in bankruptcy has a period during
which it can propose a reorganization plan exclusively. After
that period, creditors can propose their own alternatives.
Under the new agreement, however, Drexel, its creditors and
its shareholders' committee will continue to negotiate before
any reorganization plan is unveiled. Drexel filed for
protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on
Feb. 13.</p>
<p>"This is a substantial push for the parties to negotiate
with each other to reach a consensual plan," said Barry
Dichter, of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, which represents
the central bank of Portugal, a creditor. "This equalizes the
bargaining position of the creditors with that of the debtor.
. . . The creditors are no longer hostage to the debtor's
exclusive right to propose a plan."</p>
<p>First City Bancorp., which is head of the creditors'
committee, however, said it isn't optimistic that a
consensual plan can be reached by November. After the hearing
before Judge Buschman, Robert Ladd, an executive vice
president at First City, Texas-Houston, the company's main
banking subsidiary, said, "There's a possibility there would
be a consensual plan. But based on what Drexel presented to
creditors and the creditors' own plan, {the two sides'
proposals} are different in many respects."</p>
<p>A Drexel spokesman said the company is pleased with the
time frame set forth in the arrangement Judge Buschman
announced. He said the Nov. 15 deadline "is a reasonable one
to put forth a consensual plan that we think will satisfy the
creditors and equity holders."</p>

<p>LAWYER SENTENCED to 15 years in Texas drug-smuggling case.</p>
<p>The penalty against former Miami attorney Hiram Lee Bauman
was stiffer than that imposed on three non-lawyer
co-defendants, who received 12-year prison sentences from
U.S. District Judge Kenneth Hoyt in Houston. All were
convicted of conspiring to import cocaine into the U.S.
between 1981 and 1984. The jury had found Mr. Bauman guilty
of laundering drug profits for clients involved in the
smuggling operation.</p>
<p>In sentencing Mr. Bauman, Judge Hoyt apparently accepted
the argument of Assistant U.S. Attorney Lawrence Finder that
an attorney should be held to a higher standard of conduct.
"The others were just common criminals," says Mr. Finder.
"Lee Bauman had taken an oath to uphold the Constitution."
The Florida Supreme Court disbarred Mr. Bauman in March for
violating a six-month suspension.</p>
<p>Ron Guralnick, a Miami attorney who represented Mr.
Bauman, said the conviction would be appealed. He called the
sentence "extremely excessive" and disagreed that attorneys
should be sentenced under a higher standard. "This is a
frightening case," he said.</p>
