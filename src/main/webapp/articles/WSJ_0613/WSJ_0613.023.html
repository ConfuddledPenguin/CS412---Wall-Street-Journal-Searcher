	<p class="article-leader">HRE PROPERTIES said trustees of the New York-based real
estate investment trust, as expected, restored the quarterly
dividend to its regular level of 45 cents a share, after a
one-time cut to 25 cents in the previous quarter because of
costs of HRE's defense against a takeover attempt by
Kimco-Orentreich Group. The latest dividend is payable July
20 to stock of record June 29. Separately, HRE reported that
net income for its second quarter ended April 30 fell 12% to
$1.1 million, or 20 cents a share, from $1.2 million, or 21
cents a share, a year earlier. The results included gains of
$162,000 in the latest quarter and $121,000 in the
year-earlier period, both from sales of properties. At April
30, the average number of shares outstanding fell to 5.4
million from about six million.</p>
