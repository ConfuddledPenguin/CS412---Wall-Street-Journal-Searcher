	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Proponents of high-definition television,
bloodied from battles with the Bush administration, are
launching a counterattack to promote U.S. development of the
technology.
   As part of that strategy, the House Democratic leadership
plans to unveil a package of legislation as early as this
week to boost U.S. commercial technology, including HDTV. The
bill, according to lawmakers and staffers, would create a
national commission to plot a strategy on HDTV and provide
$50 million in Pentagon funding for the technology.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In addition, the package earmarks $100 million for a new
Commerce Department program in such advanced technologies as
HDTV, and $200 million in loan guarantees for small
businesses doing high-technology work and for U.S. firms
exporting technology products.</p>
<p>The technology initiative, put together by House Majority
Leader Richard Gephardt, (D., Mo.), and Rep. Norman Mineta
(D., Calif.), packages a variety of bills and budget
resolutions that have already been introduced, but haven't
become law. For instance, a House-passed bill that encourages
the formation of joint production ventures is part of the
package.</p>
<p>"If you have seven separate bills, the president can pick
you apart," says Rep. Mineta. "If you have one bill, he may
like six parts, and it will be harder to veto." Nevertheless,
the funding sought in the bill will likely be pared back
because of expected administration opposition and because of
pressure on the appropriations committees to reduce spending.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the HDTV counterattack advanced on two other
fronts yesterday. The Office of Technology Assessment, a
research arm of Congress, released a report calling HDTV
crucial for "a number of technologies that will be important
to future generations of computer and communications
equipment." Another report by Lester Thurow, dean of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of
Management, railed at the administration for failing to
invest in HDTV and other commercial technologies.</p>
<p>"If the administration persists in this attitude," Mr.
Thurow wrote in a report released by Rebuild America, a group
tied to Rep. Mel Levine, (D., Calif.), "the U.S. could be a
second- or third-rate industrial power in the year 2000, and
President Bush will be remembered as the Herbert Hoover of
U.S. industrial competitiveness."</p>
<p>HDTV refers to a host of new technologies aimed at
producing video displays with super-sharp images and sound.
The first sets are expected to go on sale in Japan next year
and cost at least $5,000. They would be marketed in Europe
after that, and in the U.S. in the mid-1990s. Prices would
surely drop as sales pick up. Offshoots of the technology
would be used to make wall-sized displays and computer
screens.</p>
<p>The technology also has come to symbolize an increasingly
bitter debate over the proper role of government in nurturing
commercial technology. The administration has taken a
hands-off approach, figuring that U.S. companies should
decide how to invest funds without guidance or money from the
government. But critics consider that view naive, given that
Japanese and European governments are spending heavily to
protect their electronics and other high-tech industries.</p>
<p>The OTA report and an unpublished study by a Pentagon
manufacturing panel detail the heavy HDTV investment made
abroad. While the U.S. government and industry have probably
spent about $100 million on HDTV research, Japan Broadcasting
Co. and other Japanese government agencies have invested $400
million in HDTV research, and private industry has added
between $670 million and $1.3 billion, the Pentagon report
estimates. Japan Broadcasting has divided HDTV research
projects among Japanese firms, while other government
agencies have provided low-interest loans and tax breaks.</p>
<p>Moreover, the OTA report says, the Japanese government has
a new $100 million initiative, called the Giant Electronics
Project, to develop a 40-inch video display by 1996 that's
not much thicker than a picture frame. The Pentagon report
estimates that Japanese firms are spending $1.3 billion
developing flat-panel displays of various sizes. Electronics
analysts in the U.S. and abroad consider the development of
big flat panels to be crucial for the success of HDTV because
the bigger picture size shows off the technology's detail.</p>
<p>In Europe, countries have banded into an HDTV venture
called Eureka Project 95. The first phase of project, which
ended in December, cost $318 million, the OTA report says.
European governments chipped in 40% of the cost.</p>
<p>Japan has been pushing to get its system adopted as a
world standard, with Europe so far successfully blocking its
attempts. Politics is more important than technology in this
effort. An international technical group organized by the
Soviet Union recently compared Japanese and European systems
for producing HDTV programming. In an interim report, dated
June 4, and provided to this newspaper, the Japanese system
was rated superior "mainly because it was free from
large-area flicker." Further tests are planned. The Soviet
Union organized the test to help it decide which system to
choose.</p>
<p>In the U.S., meanwhile, the HDTV effort has been
fractured, with the Bush administration repeatedly turning
back efforts to increase funding for research. Congress
recently freed $20 million in additional HDTV funding for the
Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa),
on top of $10 million already approved. But that small
victory has as much to do with pork-barrel politics as with
technology policy.</p>
<p>Rep. John Murtha, (D., Penn.), chairman of the defense
appropriations subcommittee, pushed for the additional funds
largely to help a small Pittsburgh company, Magnascreen
Corp., congressional staffers say. Magnascreen has already
been awarded a $1 million Darpa contract to produce a
flat-panel TV, and according to Pentagon documents, could win
as much as $9.5 million of the additional funds.</p>
<p>But turning the U.S. into an HDTV competitor would take
far more money than that. Darpa has said it could use $100
million annually to research flat-panel displays, and the
Pentagon report recommends that level of funding. But the
administration has fought to keep HDTV funding to a fraction
of that, and the Pentagon ousted the Darpa director, Craig
Fields, who lobbied for big increases.</p>
