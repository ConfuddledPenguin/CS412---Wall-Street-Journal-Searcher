	<p class="article-leader">CAMARILLO, Calif. -- Troubled Alpharel Inc. said it's
dismissing its secretary and chief financial officer, William
H. Lane, because it simply can't afford to keep him anymore.
   "It wasn't a good-guy or bad-guy thing," Robert T. Bruce,
chairman of the maker of computerized document management
systems, said in an interview. "We just have to cut back on
the number of non-revenue generating people" at the company.
Mr. Lane, according to proxy material, earned $91,246 last
year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Lane, a former Honeywell Inc. executive and private
business consultant who came to Alpharel a little more than a
year ago, will be succeeded this week by John W. Low, who has
been corporate controller of the company since August 1987.</p>
<p>In January, Alpharel said it would trim costs by reducing
its work force to 19 from 40. In the first quarter, the
company had a net loss of $313,000, or three cents a share,
on revenue of $1.1 million.</p>
<p>Prior to Alpharel, Mr. Low was with Price Waterhouse for
seven years, most recently as manager in their
Entrepreneurial Services Group.</p>
<p>Mr. Lane couldn't immediately be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Separately, Alpharel said Roger H. Erickson has been
appointed vice president, engineering. The five-year company
veteran, who has served as, among other things, director of
technical projects, succeeds Don T. Miller. Mr. Miller will
leave Alpharel in August, the company said.</p>
