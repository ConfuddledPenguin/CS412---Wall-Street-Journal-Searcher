	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A federal appeals court panel struck down
the Securities and Exchange Commission's "one share, one
vote" rule, a move that could reshape the way some companies
protect themselves from takeovers.
   The panel, in a 3-0 decision, told the SEC that it had
overstepped its authority under federal securities law and
had entered corporate governance, an area traditionally
determined by state law. The court told the SEC that if the
rule were validated, "the commission would be able to
establish a federal corporate law by using access to the
national capital markets as its enforcement mechanism."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The ruling could encourage more companies to try to create
multiple classes of stock in efforts to help protect
incumbent management. Several lawyers and academics suggested
that the ruling is likely to help boost the role of "white
knights," who are often brought in by management to help fend
off hostile bidders. Those investors could get shares with
enhanced voting rights as part of their stake in a company.</p>
<p>The SEC, which said it was "disappointed," hasn't decided
whether to appeal the ruling by a panel of the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia in favor of the Business
Roundtable, a group of 200 major corporations. The agency
could appeal either to the full appeals court or to the
Supreme Court. But the agency is likely to ask the exchanges
to adopt uniform voting procedures on their own, amending the
rules that way.</p>
<p>Even if the appeals court ruling stands, it's unclear how
many companies would be able to get shareholder approval for
multiple classes of stock with unequal voting rights.
Institutional investors have emerged as a substantially more
active group in recent years and aren't likely to placidly
watch corporate managements take steps that could entrench
themselves.</p>
<p>Dual voting is "clearly the most potent and ultimate
protective device because it does a lot more than prevent
hostile takeovers," said John Pound, finance professor at
Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government.
"Management is effectively insulated from unwanted changes."</p>
<p>He said institutional investors, particularly public
employee funds that have been the most active in pressing
shareholder-rights issues, were likely to take a strong stand
against the introduction of new dual stock classes. "I think
this would generate real outrage among those institutions
concerned with good governance issues," he said. "That might
be a real restraint at major companies" tempted to introduce
new stock classes, he added.</p>
<p>At the time the rule, called 19c4, was enacted by a 4-1
commission vote, 60 New York Stock Exchange companies had
disparate voting rights or planned to introduce them. In
addition, 182 companies on the National Association of
Securities Dealers automated quotation system and 117
American Stock Exchange concerns had such structures,
according to SEC figures.</p>
<p>While those companies with two classes of stock already in
place were "grandfathered" and allowed to retain those
classes, the SEC rule said that companies couldn't in the
future abolish or reduce shareholder voting rights and remain
on an exchange or Nasdaq.</p>
<p>By setting up the rule that way, the SEC tried to skirt
state corporate-governance problems because the agency
regulates the exchanges. But the appeals court rejected the
SEC argument, citing a 1977 Supreme Court ruling that said,
"we are reluctant to federalize the substantial portion of
the law of corporations that deals with transactions in
securities."</p>
<p>The exchanges, led by the Big Board, will be watching the
SEC carefully. The New York exchange pressed the SEC for
rule-making help in 1988 when it was forced to reconsider an
exchange rule that prohibited multiple classes of stock. That
was during the takeover binge of the 1980s when a host of
companies were eager to protect themselves from corporate
raids.</p>
<p>At the time, the Amex had a more permissive rule allowing
companies to list several classes of shares, and the Nasdaq
didn't have any rule governing the voting structure.</p>
<p>After the SEC passed its rule, the exchanges adopted
similar rules. If the appeals court decision stands, the
exchanges will be forced to decide how to handle their own
rules.</p>
<p>The Business Roundtable applauded the ruling. "American
shareholders won an important victory today," said Bruce
Atwater, chairman of the group's corporate governance task
force and chief executive officer of General Mills Inc. "The
court has resoundingly affirmed their right to determine for
themselves what kinds of equities best serve their
interests."</p>
<p>But some observers said the ruling could hurt
shareholders. "It's hard to justify having national policy on
issues like this made by a handful of individual states at a
time when the capital markets are becoming more
international," said Ronald Gilson, an expert on corporate
governance at Stanford Law School. "The effect of it is to
leave decisions about share voting largely to individual
state law."</p>
<p>Washington lawyer Richard Phillips said he expected
several companies to seek multiple classes of voting stock
"as the hostile takeover comes back into vogue." But he added
that the SEC certainly would appeal the decision. "No way
they'll leave this one alone," he said.</p>
<p>SEC market regulation director Richard Ketchum called on
the exchanges to adopt uniform 19c4-type rules. "There's
always been a wide degree of consensus {among the exchanges
and the NASD} that there should be voting rights rules," he
said. "I hope that staring into the vacuum, they will
respond."</p>
<p>One potential benefactor of the ruling may be "white
knights," investors who are brought in by companies to
protect against hostile bids. In the past few years, those
investors weren't able to demand better voting terms before
making their investments. That could change, said Meredith
Brown, the head of mergers and acquisitions at Debevoise &
Plimpton. "This might open up the possibility of voting
arrangements" favorable to white knights, he said.</p>
<p>Arthur Fleischer, a takeover lawyer at Fried Frank Harris
Shriver & Jacobson, agreed. "Assuming you can justify it from
a corporate point of view, you are no longer restricted by
19c4 to have a proportional voting test," he said.</p>
<p>But he added that he thinks the court ruling is "more
symbolic than practical." Except in certain specific cases,
he said, he doubts shareholders would approve multiple
classes.</p>
