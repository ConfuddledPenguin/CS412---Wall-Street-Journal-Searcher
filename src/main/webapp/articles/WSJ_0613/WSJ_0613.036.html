	<p class="article-leader">Corn-futures prices are expected to rise today on the
strength of a government estimate of greater corn-export
demand and projections of dwindling corn stockpiles.
   The Agriculture Department boosted its estimate of corn
exports for the marketing year ending Aug. 31 by 50 million
bushels and lowered, in turn, its estimate of corn stockpiles
next September to 1.28 billion bushels.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Stronger export demand and tighter supplies also are
expected to raise cash-corn prices by five cents into the
range of $2.35 to $2.40 per bushel during the rest of the
marketing year.</p>
<p>At the same time, the department gave wheat farmers a
double dose of reassuring news, sticking with its May
forecast for the largest winter-wheat crop since 1981 and
boosting its forecast of Soviet wheat buying by one million
tons.</p>
<p>Government analysts projected a winter-wheat harvest of
2.09 billion bushels, up 44% from last year's drought-damaged
crop. The forecast was almost unchanged from the previous
forecast -- down fewer than five million bushels from last
month.</p>
<p>Private commodity analysts said they don't expect wheat
prices to change significantly when trading opens today.</p>
<p>Winter-wheat yields are expected to average 41.2 bushels
per acre. Winter wheat, which is planted in the fall and
harvested in June and July, accounts for 75% of U.S. wheat
production; spring wheat makes up the rest.</p>
<p>The harvest is just beginning in Kansas, the nation's No.
1 wheat state. The Kansas crop is expected to total 460.2
million bushels, more than double last year's crop.</p>
<p>The Agriculture Department didn't cut its one-month-old
forecast for an 8.1 billion-bushel corn harvest. However,
private analysts speculate that unusually cold and wet spring
weather may have forced farmers to plant roughly two million
acres fewer than government analysts expected.</p>
<p>The department would probably reduce its corn-production
estimate if the condition of the emerging crop doesn't
improve markedly. About half of the crop is in fair to poor
condition. The early season situation is the worst in six
years, according to Daniel W. Basse, director of market
research at AgResource Co., Chicago.</p>
<p>All these factors are expected to keep pressure on corn
prices for the foreseeable future. The department's
projection of a 1.28 billion-bushel stockpile by Sept. 1
would be the smallest since the 1983 drought helped deplete
the nation's stockpile.</p>
<p>If the 1990 harvest proves mediocre, some analysts
speculate that the stockpile would fall below the one
billion-bushel level by the time farmers begin harvesting the
1991 crop.</p>
<p>In a separate report on the Soviet Union's grain outlook,
the department stuck with its May prediction that Soviet
grain production will total 215 million tons in 1990. Also
unchanged from a month ago is the department's projection
that the Soviets will import 36 million tons of grain during
the 1990-91 marketing year beginning July 1.</p>
<p>But department analysts raised their estimate of Soviet
wheat imports by one million tons to 16 million tons, which
would be the largest since 1987-88. At the same time, they
lowered their estimate of Soviet coarse-grain imports by one
million tons to 19 million tons. Rice and miscellaneous
grains will account for the rest of the import total.</p>
