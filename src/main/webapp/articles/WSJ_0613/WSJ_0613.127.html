	<p class="article-leader">Western Union Corp., New York, debt-laden and struggling
to avoid bankruptcy court, again revised its proposed
recapitalization plan to satisfy its bondholders.
   The communications and financial services company now
wants to offer a different package of debt securities and
common shares to holders of its 19.25% senior secured reset
notes due Dec. 15, 1992, and to holders of its 16% notes due
June 15, 1991. The revision affects $530 million of debt.
Western Union is also seeking to reclassify its preferred
stock into new common shares.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the latest revision, the company seeks to change the
principal amounts of two new notes and plans to offer a
different mix of common, Class C and Class D shares, in
exchange for each $1,000 face value of the 19.25% and 16%
notes. In addition, Western Union is seeking a change in
interest payment terms on one new note, including the rate
and form of payment.</p>
