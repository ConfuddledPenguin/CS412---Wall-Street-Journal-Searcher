	<p class="article-leader">Hispanic Businesses
   Suffer Flat Sales</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>FOR THE 500 largest Hispanic-owned businesses, sales
barely grew in 1989 and, at $8.35 billion, remain below the
record of $8.7 billion set in 1985, according to the annual
survey and ranking by Hispanic Business magazine.</p>
<p>Food-and-drink-related companies continue to dominate the
top spots. Bacardi Imports of Miami, with $500 million in
sales, and Goya Foods Inc. of Secaucus, N.J., with $320
million, were the top two, as they have been since the
listing began in 1983.</p>
<p>The list is featured each June by the Santa Barbara,
Calif., magazine. It's the only comprehensive look at
Hispanic business, but self-reported data make conclusions
difficult. Turnover on the list is high; some 121 companies
disappeared from the list this year. Only five of the 500
companies are publicly traded.</p>
<p>The magazine attributes most of the weakness in Hispanic
businesses to the sluggish economy. Some companies absent
from the list have folded. Joseph Wells, research editor,
suspects others declined to disclose sales to avoid reporting
a drop in revenue.</p>
<p>One problem with the survey, is that some businesses don't
want to be identified as Latino-owned, Mr. Wells says. "They
don't consider it a major asset."</p>
<p>Black Businesses Bond</p>
<p>With a City -- but Slowly</p>
<p>RESEARCH SHOWS that black mayors deliver for black-owned
businesses. But the rumble over who will manage and sell New
York City's general obligation bonds shows the process isn't
smooth.</p>
<p>Last Friday, Mayor David Dinkins and Comptroller Elizabeth
Holtzman named five large Wall Street firms senior managers
of New York's general obligation bond program. Some 30 firms,
including eight owned by minorities or women, were in the
running for slots on the syndicate. At least two such firms,
emboldened by the election of the city's first black mayor,
asked to be considered for a senior manager position.</p>
<p>WR Lazard & Co., one of only two minority firms ever to
co-manage a New York city issue, was one of these
disappointed hopefuls. "We thought it would be a good pat on
the back for us for doing a good job for the city," says
Wardell Lazard, president.</p>
<p>However, Sally Hernandez Pinero, deputy mayor for finance,
says the senior managerships shouldn't be the litmus test of
the city's intentions for minority firms. The city plans to
give plenty of business to minority businesses, she says. In
fact, also on Friday, Grigsby Branford & Powell, a
black-owned firm, and Artemis Capital Group, owned by women,
were named co-senior managers of an equipment financing
program.</p>
<p>Some Wall Street types aren't so keen on the city's
efforts. The Bond Buyer newspaper recently questioned both
the prudence of spreading the wealth and the competence of
minority firms.</p>
<p>Ms. Hernandez Pinero responds: "For a long time the same
people had a lock on the business. Why don't they cry
favoritism when it goes the other way?"</p>
<p>Pride Swells Market,</p>
<p>Markup, for Black Art</p>
<p>BLACK professionals are satisfying "the need to celebrate
ourselves," by investing in black art, says George Walters,
who runs the Design Masters Intergroup Galleries in New York.</p>
<p>Mr. Walters organized a partnership to purchase a limited
edition of 120 lithographs by painter Jacob Lawrence last
January. He is selling the prints for $3,500 each, with an
unusual two-year guarantee to buy them back for at least the
same price paid. Mr. Walters is making a similar offer to
buyers of signed works by the late Romare Bearden.</p>
<p>"Not only have we jumped into the market for the sale of
black art, but we're supporting the market," Mr. Walters
says. Last December, 130 paintings by black modern artists
were sold in Washington, D.C., for $6 million, a record for
such a collection.</p>
<p>Modern masters of black themes, such as Mr. Lawrence,
Vincent Smith and the late Charles White, have been valued by
white collectors for years, but only recently have they
become the rage for blacks with money to spend on art.
Washington art consultant Deborah Donelson says some pieces
by black artists that her clients acquired for $3,000 in 1983
are now worth $30,000.</p>
<p>"It wasn't too long ago that you could meet a black person
with money and they'd have no images on their walls at all,"
says Mr. Walters. "That's changed."</p>
<p>M.B.A. Programs Add</p>
<p>Reality to Curriculum</p>
<p>BUSINESS SCHOOLS are trying new ways to make getting an
M.B.A. more meaningful for minorities.</p>
<p>A Wharton School program, for example, sent a team of
mostly minority students on three trips to St. Croix, in the
Caribbean, this spring to help rebuild small businesses hurt
by hurricane Hugo.</p>
<p>And last month, Columbia University's business school
awarded M.B.A.s to the first five graduates of its Corporate
Executive Fellows program, which takes working minority
professionals and enrolls them in a three-stage plan for an
advanced degree.</p>
<p>The recent group of graduates began by attending classes
from May through December 1988. But then, in January of 1989,
each participant was paired with a senior corporate executive
for a nine-month internship at major corporations including
Equitable Insurance Co. and Citicorp. Mentor executives
supervised the students in staff assignments and provided
performance feedback.</p>
<p>The participants then returned to Columbia full time in
September to complete their degrees.</p>
