	<p class="article-leader">From an April speech by Paul Volcker, chairman of the
National Commission on the Public Service:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Roosevelt was accused of politicizing the executive branch
when (exclusive of ambassadors) he had fewer than 100
presidential appointees. . . . Now there are over 500
positions subject to presidential appointment with Senate
confirmation and another 2,500 "political" appointees.</p>
