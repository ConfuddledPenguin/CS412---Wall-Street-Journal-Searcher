	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Parlux Fragrances Inc. said Gerard Semhon
resigned as president, chief executive officer and a director
to pursue other interests. Robert Kaufman, a new director,
succeeds him as president.
   A spokesman for Parlux, a fragrance company that recently
resolved a dispute with its largest shareholder by
effectively giving this holder's group control of the board,
said the management changes weren't related to that
agreement.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The spokesman said the chief executive's post will be
filled, but not in the "immediate future." Mr. Semhon, 53
years old, who has an 8% stake in Parlux, said through the
spokesman that he will remain a consultant to the company.</p>
<p>Parlux also is no longer exploring the sale of any of its
divisions, the spokesman said, but is "looking into the
acquisition" of other companies, which he couldn't specify.
Parlux, which has annual revenue of more than $20 million,
said earlier this year that it intended to sell all or part
of the company. Parlux has world-wide marketing rights to
fragrances such as Spectacular by Joan Collins, and Anne
Klein.</p>
<p>Mr. Semhon's departure from the board reduces the number
of directors to eight. It means that five directors are
appointees of a group headed by Ilia Lekach, a director and
Parlux's largest holder, with a stake of about 30%. After the
board shift was announced several weeks ago, Mr. Lekach
agreed to drop his request for a special meeting of holders
to consider the removal of three Parlux directors.</p>
<p>Parlux said at the time of the agreement that Mr. Kaufman,
36, one of Mr. Lekach's associates, would join the company as
executive vice president. Parlux also said then that Mr.
Lekach wouldn't seek further board or management changes.</p>
