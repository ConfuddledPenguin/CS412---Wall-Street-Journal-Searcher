	<p class="article-leader">Most of American culture today is in turmoil or in court.
The battle lines are drawn again over the American flag. Pop
music is in jail in Florida, which doesn't seem to think it
has to endure a rap group's obscenity. Is there no respite?
Turns out there is, in the form of 43-year-old pitcher Nolan
Ryan's no-hitter Monday over the World Champion Oakland A's,
his sixth. No danger, we assume, that a court will try to
overturn it.</p>
