	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A midafternoon rally sparked by
futures-related buying sent the stock market soaring for the
second consecutive session, with the Dow Jones Industrial
Average just barely missing another record high.
   The industrial average, which climbed 30.19 points Monday
in rebounding from a four-session losing streak, rose another
40.85 to 2933.42 -- less than two points short of its
all-time best close of 2935.19, set six sessions earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Although broader measures also failed to surpass their
record levels, Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index climbed 4.62
to 366.25, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index jumped
2.24 to 199.66 and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index gained
4.09 to 340.98</p>
<p>Some 1,003 issues advanced in Big Board trading, compared
with 545 decliners. Trading was moderate as uncertainty about
this week's round of economic reports and the expiration of
June stock-index futures and options remained a drag on the
market, but Big Board volume improved to 157.1 million shares
from 119.6 million Monday.</p>
<p>The market's late surge, in which the Dow industrials
jumped more than 36 points in about half an hour and peaked
just above 2940, stood in sharp contrast to its initial
attempt to add to Monday's gains.</p>
<p>The average barely managed a double-digit rise before the
early buying interest dried up, and stocks spent most of the
session drifting on either side of the previous day's closing
levels before their midafternoon surge.</p>
<p>Traders cited buy programs resulting from stock-index
arbitrage, which involve the purchase of baskets of stocks
and the sale of index-futures contracts in order to profit
from price differences between them, as the catalyst for the
later move.</p>
<p>Buying by market players concerned about the possibility
of missing another rally fueled the advance as well. "Those
who are expecting a retreat are getting a little bit uneasy
here, and they're afraid the market's going to run away from
them again," said Michael Metz, a market strategist at
Oppenheimer & Co.</p>
<p>Several stocks included in the Major Market Index, a
measure of 20 blue-chip issues that is designed to mirror the
Dow industrials, rode the wave of index-arbitrage buying to
solid gains. Merck gained 2 5/8 to 83 3/8, Procter & Gamble
jumped 3 1/4 to 84 1/4, General Motors climbed 1 1/8 to 50
1/4, General Electric went up 1 3/8 to 70 1/4, Exxon rose 1
to 48 7/8 and Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing rallied 2 to
85 1/8.</p>
<p>However, two other blue chips included in the Major Market
Index were left behind in the market's advance: American
Express, which fell 1/4 to 30 3/8, and Eastman Kodak, which
dropped 1/4 to 41 3/8. Both issues had shown strength in
recent sessions.</p>
<p>This week's round of key economic reports gets under way
today with the release of May retail sales data. The
consensus of economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets
Report is calling for sales to be unchanged.</p>
<p>Tomorrow and Friday will bring the release of May figures
on producer and consumer prices, respectively. Friday also
brings the "triple witching hour," or the quarterly
expiration of index futures and options.</p>
<p>Oppenheimer's Michael Metz says stocks appear to be "in a
no-win situation" as far as the economic reports are
concerned, as the market's two-day surge indicates that
investors already have factored a favorable outcome into
stock prices.</p>
<p>"Unless they're astonishingly good," Mr. Metz said, prices
don't appear likely to make another immediate move higher. "I
don't see any great hysteria among undercommitted portfolio
managers to hop aboard," he says.</p>
<p>Semiconductor stocks were active following news that the
industry's leading indicator, the book-to-bill ratio, climbed
to 1.14-to-1 in May from 1.09-to-1 in April. The reading
indicated that the industry's modest rebound from a sales
slump in the second half of last year continued.</p>
<p>Advanced Micro Devices rose 1/8 to 9 7/8 in Big Board
composite trading of 2.2 million shares, while Analog Devices
slid 1/8 to 8 1/8 on 1.1 million shares. Among other chip
producers, Motorola rose 1 7/8 to 85 3/8, Texas Instruments
rose 1/8 to 40 1/2, National Semiconductor added 1/4 to 8 1/8
and Cypress Semiconductor rose 1/8 to 14.</p>
<p>Chase Manhattan dropped 1/2 to 26 after Moody's Investors
Service cut its rating on the company's senior debt
securities as a result of deterioration in Chase's commercial
real-estate portfolio. Analysts told Dow Jones Professional
Investor Report they anticipate that the company will
announce major reductions in its work force and asset sales
in an effort to turn around its sagging earnings. A Chase
spokesman declined to comment.</p>
<p>Other big city bank issues were mixed in the wake of
Moody's action. Citicorp rose 5/8 to 24 1/8 and BankAmerica
added 1/2 to 32 7/8, while Manufacturers Hanover fell 3/8 to
36 1/2, Bankers Trust New York lost 1/4 to 44 3/8 and J.P.
Morgan fell 1/8 to 38 1/8.</p>
<p>ITT jumped 3 1/4 to 60 5/8 following news of its plans to
sell a 7% stake in its Alcatel joint venture for $640 million
to its partner in the venture, Generale d'Electricite of
France, and to use the proceeds primarily to buy back its
common shares.</p>
<p>Kollmorgen rose 1/2 to 11 5/8 in activity highlighted by a
block trade of 646,700 shares, or about 5.9% of its shares
outstanding. The company confirmed that it had "decisively
won" its proxy fight at last month's annual meeting with
Vernitron, its hostile suitor.</p>
<p>Kay Jewelers fell 1/2 to 8 7/8. This newspaper, in its
"Heard on the Street" column, cited the company as one of
several firms whose stock appears to be performing
considerably better than its bonds.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 1.99
to 364.31. Volume totaled 11,650,000 shares.</p>
<p>New Line Cinema added 3/4 to 13 1/4. The company declared
a 5-for-4 stock split.</p>
<p>Dataram rose 1 1/4 to 17 7/8 after reporting that net
income for the fiscal fourth quarter, ended in April, climbed
61% from a year ago.</p>
