	<p class="article-leader">MONTREAL -- BCE Mobile Communications Inc. said it will
sell three million special warrants at 25.25 Canadian dollars
(US$21.56) each to Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc., RBC Dominion
Securities Inc., Scotia-McLeod Inc. and Trilon Securities
Corp., all securities firms.
   BCE Mobile said each special warrant entitles the holder
to purchase a unit consisting of one BCE Mobile common share
and the right to purchase by April 30, 1991, another common
share at C$27.25.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The cellular-telephone and communications concern said net
proceeds, excluding proceeds from the exercise of the share
purchase warrants, will be about C$72.8 million.</p>
<p>BCE Mobile said the investment firms have an option until
June 14 to increase the size of the issue to 3.5 million
special warrants. It said proceeds will be used mainly to
fund planned capital spending of its Bell Cellular Inc. unit.</p>
<p>BCE Mobile is currently 73% owned by BCE Inc., a
Montreal-based telecommunications, energy, and real estate
concern. However, BCE Mobile said that on completion of the
special-warrant sale, BCE Inc.'s interest in BCE Mobile will
decline to 69.7%. Assuming full exercise of the share
purchase warrants, BCE's ownership would decrease to 66.6%.</p>
<p>On the Toronto Stock Exchange, BCE Mobile closed at
C$23.75, down 75 Canadian cents.</p>
