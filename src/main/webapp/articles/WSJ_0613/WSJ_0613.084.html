	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The New York Stock Exchange's new trading-halt
proposal, which would have shut down the Big Board during
last October's "minicrash" and the 1987 crash, drew
complaints from many quarters yesterday.
   Traders, investors and corporate executives all criticized
the proposed halts, recommended after an exchange panel's
six-month study of ways to curb stock-market volatility. The
"four-tier circuit breaker" starts with a one-hour cessation
of trading of stocks, stock-index futures and options when
the Dow Jones Industrial Average moves up or down 100 points,
and goes up to two-hour halts when the Dow moves 300 points
and 400 points. The halts mean that a huge market move late
in the day, like the 190-point drop on Oct. 13, 1989, would
effectively close the exchange.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I would have basically gone for shorter trading halts,"
said James Cloonan, president of the American Association of
Individual Investors and a member of the Big Board panel that
made the recommendations.</p>
<p>Charles Wohlstetter, who is chairman of Big Board-listed
Contel Corp. and who criticizes the exchange for catering to
big institutional investors, called the proposed trading
halts "wrong and wrongheaded" because historically, "the
strength of the NYSE was that it was a continuous market,
come what may."</p>
<p>One big institutional investor, J. Thomas Allen, president
of Advanced Investment Management Inc., was equally critical
of the trading halts. "The great thinking is that everybody
can sit back and catch their breath and you can alleviate
panic. We don't think it is academically valid."</p>
<p>The reaction came as the Big Board's 19-member
"Blue-Ribbon Panel on Market Volatility and Investor
Confidence" yesterday released a 380-page report with eight
recommendations about market volatility, including the
proposed new trading halts. The recommendations, which were
expected, will be reviewed by the Big Board's directors and
management.</p>
<p>The panel, headed by General Motors Corp. Chairman Roger
B. Smith, was formed to study program trading and
market-structure problems amid an outcry over program trading
after the Oct. 13 stock-market plunge.</p>
<p>Program trading involves rapid-fire, computer-aided trades
of large baskets of stocks -- in the Big Board's definition,
15 or more stocks valued at $1 million or more. The most
common form of program trading is index arbitrage, in which
large amounts of stocks, futures and options are bought and
sold to profit from price differences in the different
markets.</p>
<p>Even GM's Mr. Smith said he isn't convinced that long
trading halts are the answer to stock-market gyrations.</p>
<p>During a news conference yesterday in the exchange's board
room, Mr. Smith said: "Nobody knows if circuit breakers will
stop the market from declining. But they could be a
significant factor for a breathing spell" in the markets.</p>
<p>John J. Phelan Jr., Big Board chairman, said, "I've been
in markets all my life, and I don't like circuit breakers --
but I have to adjust like everybody else."</p>
<p>Richard Breeden, chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, said he was "extremely pleased" by the Big Board
panel's call for a single regulator for stocks and
stock-index futures. A Treasury Department spokeswoman said,
"The panel's recommendations of four-tier circuit breakers
deserves serious consideration."</p>
<p>The Big Board never formally halted trading on Oct. 19,
1987, when the Dow plunged a record 508 points. The next day,
known as "Terrible Tuesday," trading virtually ground to a
stop, and the Big Board came within minutes of a trading
halt. But the exchange never ordered a shutdown.</p>
<p>The Big Board panel's report argues that the circuit
breakers would "give buyers and sellers a chance to catch
their breath and calmly assess their positions during periods
of market stress." The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a panel
member that dissented from some other parts of the report,
generally approved of the circuit breakers, saying they would
"alleviate the possibility of uncoordination during
substantial market movements."</p>
<p>Even Mr. Cloonan, the panel member who dislikes trading
halts, agreed that in some drastic situations an exchange
shutdown might help. "There's no sense in having it open if
nobody knows what's happening besides the people standing
around the {trading} post," he said.</p>
<p>But others, especially big-block traders, maintain that
trading halts can substantially increase risk for everyone
and prevent buyers and sellers from coming together. Trading
halts can also induce panic in a market that otherwise might
fix itself, some say.</p>
<p>"When you have people with a profit motive transacting in
a free market, at some point prices will stop dropping," said
Mr. Allen of Advanced Investment Management. "Cutting that
person off might hurt the markets, and it definitely adds to
the uncertainty of the institutional market."</p>
<p>Besides the new trading halts, the Big Board panel's
report, as expected, suggested these steps to deal with
unruly markets: an easing of restrictions on stock buy-backs
by corporations and on options trading by the exchange's
market makers; the introduction of unspecified new products
to shield small investors from rapid price moves on a given
trading day; and improved surveillance for trading abuses
across markets.</p>
<p>A majority of panel members also endorsed a single federal
regulator for the stock and stock-index futures markets, and
a single regulator to oversee requirements for margin, or
good-faith, money needed to trade stocks and futures.
Dissenting from these last two recommendations were the
Chicago Merc; Merton H. Miller, finance professor at the
University of Chicago; and Mr. Cloonan of the investors'
association.</p>
<p>Leo Melamed, chairman of the Chicago Merc's executive
committee, complained that most of the panel "didn't review
any facts or evidence on the issue," but instead "simply
mirrored a popular perception that consolidation of
regulation seems desirable."</p>
<p>Several Wall Street brokerage firms had pulled back from
index arbitrage after the outcry over last October's market
plunge. Critics charged that the stock-market drop was
exacerbated by program trading. Some firms had said privately
they would reconsider their position once the Big Board
report finally came out.</p>
<p>At yesterday's news conference, Mr. Phelan said it would
be "irresponsible" for brokerage firms to abandon their
pullback from index arbitrage immediately. He said firms
should wait until some of the report's recommendations are in
place, including a provision that any program trading once
the Dow moves 50 points should be "stabilizing." This means
only selling during a rising market, or buying during a
declining market.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley & Co., the most active
program trader on Wall Street so far this year, said: "We
have no plans to enter proprietary index arbitrage," or
program trading for its own account. But the firm continues
to execute program trades for customers. Merrill Lynch & Co.,
the nation's biggest brokerage firm, said it would execute
program trades for itself or for its clients.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Corrections & Amplifications</p>
<p>MERRILL LYNCH & Co. will continue its policy of refraining
from stock-index arbitrage trading for itself and for its
clients until the firm decides that proper regulations are in
place to address excess volatility. Merrill's position on
stock-index arbitrage, one form of program trading, was
misstated in yesterday's edition.</p>
