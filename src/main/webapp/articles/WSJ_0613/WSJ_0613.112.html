	<p class="article-leader">Foxboro Co., Foxboro, Mass., said it received "several"
takeover proposals in connection with its previously
announced search for a strategic partner to make an equity
investment.
   The maker of industrial-process control systems said that
its investment adviser, Salomon Brothers Inc., and two law
firms are helping it evaluate the proposals and will assist
in negotiations. It added that it hasn't decided whether to
sell out.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Foxboro has advanced technology but has reported losses in
recent quarters and omitted its dividend earlier this year.
For all of 1989, it reported a net loss of $4.6 million, or
37 cents a share, on sales of $597.8 million.</p>
<p>Analysts speculate that descendants of the founding
Bristol family, who hold nearly one-third of the stock, may
be restive due to the dividend cuts. In addition, in April,
the company added to its board two representatives of a
stockholder group that had accumulated a 4.8% stake. The
group agreed to hold its purchases below 10% this year and
said its directors wouldn't comment publicly on Foxboro
matters.</p>
<p>Foxboro declined to disclose details about the takeover
offers. In New York Stock Exchange trading, its stock closed
up $2.375 at $32.375.</p>
