	<p class="article-leader">MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Sun Microsystems said that Mentor
Graphics Inc. agreed to purchase $300 million of Sun
computers over the next three years, the first time Mentor
has broken its practice of buying only Hewlett-Packard Co.
machines.
   Mentor, a maker of software used in designing
semiconductors and other electronic parts, announced in
January that it would stop dealing exclusively with
Hewlett-Packard and begin making its software available to
Sun. Mentor buys computers, loads them with Mentor software,
and then resells them under the Mentor nameplate.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The union between Sun and Mentor could prove a boon to
both. Mentor's software will now be available on products of
the two largest workstation makers. For Sun, a link with
Mentor's widely used software could spur acceptance of Sun's
so-called SPARC computer architecture, which is different
from Hewlett-Packard's workstation architecture. Sun and
Hewlett-Packard have been battling to establish their
respective architectures as the standard for the workstation
market.</p>
<p>In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Sun closed at $33,
up $1.375. Mentor closed at $24.25, down 25 cents.</p>
