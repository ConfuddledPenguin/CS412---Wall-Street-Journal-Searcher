	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. isn't
likely to permit banks to underwrite insurance, its chairman,
William Seidman said, despite a new law in Delaware that
permits banks to engage in that activity.
   Citing new risk to the bank-deposit insurance fund, Mr.
Seidman said the agency staff will recommend restrictions on
the two-week-old Delaware law, which has already drawn major
banks to the state to launch insurance operations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In an FDIC meeting yesterday, Mr. Seidman said the most
likely course would be for the agency either to prohibit
insurance underwriting inside banks or restrict it to
separately capitalized subsidiaries. The recommendation also
is expected to apply to bank investments in real estate.</p>
<p>The agency has examined the issue in the past, but hadn't
any reason to act until the Delaware law was enacted. In the
wake of the savings-and-loan crisis, in which taxpayers are
expected to pay about $300 billion over the next 10 years,
regulators are taking a dim view of exposing the FDIC to new
potential losses. Last year, the bank-deposit insurance fund
had an $800 million loss, marking only the second year it
operated in the red.</p>
<p>"This opens up a whole host of issues about safety and
soundness" of the insurance fund, Mr. Seidman said. "It's
time, given recent developments, to review this issue."</p>
<p>Already, big banks have announced plans to take advantage
of the Delaware law, including Chase Manhattan Corp. and
Citicorp, both based in New York.</p>
<p>It wasn't clear how damaging the FDIC's position is for
banks' entry into insurance. If the insurance activity is
restricted to separately established subsidiaries, banks
still might engage in insurance underwriting and brokerage
activities.</p>
<p>Several banks that were contacted yesterday, including
Chase Manhattan, were aware of Mr. Seidman's remarks and
declined to comment.</p>
<p>The FDIC move could set off conflicts between the state
and federal regulatory agencies. Keith Ellis, Delaware state
banking commissioner, met yesterday with FDIC officials to
discuss their concerns. The Federal Reserve Board also is
considering changes in regulations on bank power and safety,
and is expected to make recommendations to Congress, possibly
next year.</p>
<p>The Delaware law allows banks to engage in all aspects of
the insurance business through separate divisions or
subsidiaries. As much as 25% of a bank's capital could be at
risk in the insurance operation, but assets, liabilities and
records of the insurance units are to be kept separate from
those of the bank.</p>
<p>Banks have lobbied furiously for years for the ability to
underwrite insurance, and have won limited activities to sell
or underwrite insurance in some states. But because the
Delaware law is the most farreaching, bank lobbyists said
they expect some sort of federal revision, as part of the
regulatory give and take.</p>
<p>"It was widely anticipated that the FDIC would look at
this," Edward Yingling, lobbyist for the American Bankers
Association, said. One likely scenario might be restrictions
on allowing banks to issue certain types of insurance, but
not on others, he said.</p>
<p>Regulators also must wrangle with whether the insurance
operations will be considered units of bank holding companies
or divisions of the banks, a banking regulator said. A group
of five insurance trade associations asked the Federal
Reserve to block the Delaware law, contending that federal
bank holding company regulations bar the sale of insurance by
a bank's non-banking subsidiary. The Fed hasn't acted.</p>
