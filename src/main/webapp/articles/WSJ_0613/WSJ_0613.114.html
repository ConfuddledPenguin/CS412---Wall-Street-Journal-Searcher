	<p class="article-leader">Pansophic Systems Inc., Lisle, Ill., said it plans to shed
its graphics business, taking an estimated $27.1 million loss
on its disposal.
   The software concern said the divestiture -- together with
net one-time charges of $7.2 million associated with the
closing of its Brazilian subsidiary and the reorganization of
its continuing operations -- resulted in a net loss of $28.5
million, or $1.53 a share, for the fourth quarter ended April
30, on revenue of $66.4 million. For the fiscal year, the net
loss was $12.9 million, or 69 cents a share, on revenue of
$218.4 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In April, the company announced that planned special
charges would erase its earnings for the year. At the time,
Pansophic said it would write down certain assets of its
graphics operations, and incur other one-time costs as part
of a plan to "refocus" the operation.</p>
<p>The company said it has now decided to get out of the
graphics business altogether, because the line is "no longer
complementary to its long-term strategic direction" and would
require financial resources better invested in Pansophic's
systems and applications software businesses.</p>
