	<p class="article-leader">ITT Corp. said it would sell 7% of Alcatel N.V. to
Compagnie Generale d'Electricite, its partner in the European
telecommunications joint venture, for $640 million.
   The sale will result in a gain of $139 million, which the
company plans to use primarily to buy back its common stock.
The sale is expected to close tomorrow, and the profit will
be reflected in second-quarter results.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>ITT's shares, which had moved slightly higher in early New
York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, jumped
several points when the news was released in the middle of
the afternoon. The shares closed up $3.25 at $60.625.</p>
<p>News of the sale comes one month after ITT indicated it
might be willing to sell some or all of its 37% stake in
Alcatel, which analysts were valuing at between $2.5 billion
and $4 billion. The sale of 7% of Alcatel at $640 million
puts the value of ITT's 37% stake at about $3.4 billion.</p>
<p>"It's a step in the right direction for ITT," said Theresa
M. Gusman, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. "It's a clear
indication that ITT is reviewing the value of its assets."
She had been valuing the 37% Alcatel stake at about $3
billion, but now she believes the value could increase
rapidly as Alcatel becomes more profitable.</p>
<p>Alcatel was formed in 1986. To create it, ITT, a New
York-based conglomerate, sold its European telecommunications
operations to CGE in exchange for $1.3 billion and 37% of the
stock of the newly combined CGE-ITT operations. CGE, a French
telecommunications concern, owned the remaining 63%.</p>
<p>When Alcatel was created, Wall Street wondered if ITT
would ever recoup its initial investment in this joint
venture. But Alcatel has grown more rapidly than analysts and
ITT's management anticipated.</p>
<p>"Our Alcatel shares have more than doubled in value in
three years," said Rand V. Araskog, ITT chairman and chief
executive officer. "The sale of 7% allows us to take
advantage, for our shareholders, of a portion of this
increased value, while retaining an ownership, which we feel
will continue to appreciate at an exceptional rate," added
Mr. Araskog, who is also chairman of Alcatel's supervisory
board.</p>
<p>In the past few years, Alcatel has benefited as the
development of one common European market has intensified.
Alcatel is also poised to profit from the opening of the
Eastern bloc. Mr. Araskog recognizes that the value of ITT's
investment in Alcatel has been enhanced by this rapid
progress.</p>
<p>A Belgian government official said Alcatel Bell, a unit of
Antwerp-based Alcatel, is close to signing a tentative
agreement to supply digital telephone exchange equipment to
the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The official, Willy Vandenberghe, an adviser to the
Belgian trade minister, estimated the value of the project at
one billion European currency units ($1.2 billion). Alcatel
and Soviet authorities are likely to sign a "framework
agreement" on the venture early next month, he added. Further
details, including financing, would be worked out later.</p>
<p>Mr. Vandenberghe said last week's meeting in Paris of the
Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls
removed a major obstacle to the long-discussed Alcatel
venture with the Soviets. Cocom, which includes
representatives of the U.S. and 16 Western allies, agreed to
loosen limits on exports of computers, telecommunications
equipment and other high-tech products to the East bloc.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, industry sources said, Alcatel Bell
would first export from Belgium exchange equipment with
capacity for at least 50,000 telephone lines. Later, a joint
venture factory would be set up in the Soviet Union to
produce exchange equipment. In a possible third phase,
another joint venture plant would be built in the Soviet
Union to make sophisticated semiconductors, known as VLSI
chips, to be used in the exchanges.</p>
<p>Mr. Vandenberghe said Cocom's new guidelines would allow
the early stages of the venture to go ahead, but the question
of transferring the most sophisticated technology involved
would have to be reviewed by Cocom.</p>
<p>In New York, ITT said retired Gen. Edward C. Meyer, an ITT
director, would join Alcatel's nine-member supervisory board,
succeeding another ITT representative. Robert Burnett,
another ITT director, is already a member of Alcatel's board.</p>
<p>ITT also said it has established a coordination center,
named ITT Europe N.V., for the European operations of all of
its nine operating units.</p>
