	<div class="article-body"><p>The U.S. 7th Fleet is chasing a renegade Japanese nuclear
submarine through the Straits of Moluccas in the Western
Pacific when suddenly the high-tech sub decides to show the
Americans that bigger is not always better. In maneuvers of
unsurpassed skill, it singlehandedly cripples six U.S.
submarines. Captain Umieda, its commander, declares as his
goal "a war for independence" from U.S. domination.</p>
<p>"Japan hasn't changed a bit since Pearl Harbor," snarls
the commander of the defeated American fleet.</p>
<p>Sound far-fetched? It's the plot of a comic book called
"Silent Fleet," read today by a quarter-million young
Japanese. The story is pure fantasy, but it is rooted in
sentiments spreading rapidly through the popular culture of
both countries.</p>
<p>The underlying message: Something is seriously askew in
U.S.-Japan relations.</p>
<p>The two nations, of course, remain fast allies, and with
each passing year their interests become more closely aligned
and their economies more thoroughly intertwined. But with
each year mutual resentment grows as well.</p>
<p>Trade disputes are the most visible sign of the problem,
though those disputes are mere surface ripples. Strong
undercurrents of fear and distrust are flowing through the
national psyches. In the U.S., people worry that Japan's
rising economic power is threatening America's future
prosperity and its place in the world. Across the ocean, the
Japanese are torn between pride in their new affluence and
fear that foreign resentment could leave them isolated in an
unfriendly world.</p>
<p>"There seems to be a race," says James C. Abegglen, a
longtime business consultant in Japan, "between economic
interdependence and political and social antagonism."</p>
<p>In the past year, that race has become even more intense.
Trade talks between the two nations have evolved into an
extraordinary series of negotiations in which each side is
criticizing the other's internal economic affairs. At the
same time, the political glue that has bound the two allies
-- fear of the Soviet Union -- has been weakened by
communism's new travails. In both countries, some people are
now questioning the very basis of the alliance.</p>
<p>Is Japan really a threat to the United States? Does its
rapid rise in economic power mean America is on the decline?
And do the Japanese have reason to worry that a resentful
U.S. will turn against them?</p>
<p>These are questions The Wall Street Journal has been
exploring since the first of this year, in interviews with
hundreds of people ranging from top business and government
leaders on both sides of the Pacific to ranchers in Nebraska
and Judo students in Kyoto. The result is a series of
articles, beginning today.</p>
<p>The anxiety in America is strikingly demonstrated in a new
Wall Street Journal/NBC poll, which shows that while 63% of
American voters say it is "very important" for the U.S. to be
the leading economic power in the world, 69% believe Japan
has already passed the U.S. Fully 63% say the Japanese have
leaped ahead in science and technology, and 69% feel Japan
invests "too much" in the United States.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in a separate poll conducted for the Journal in
Japan, 43% of Japanese say it's time for their government to
develop a foreign policy more independent of the U.S. Only
17% oppose such a move.</p>
<p>In the years since World War II, Americans have grown
accustomed to the idea of being at the top, and they don't
want to give it up. Virtually all Americans "feel they have
to be the leader of the world," contends Mitsuko Shimomura, a
Japanese journalist who recently did an extensive tour of the
U.S. "They are like missionaries. They really believe there
is nothing better than America in this world."</p>
<p>The Bush administration's budget director, Richard Darman,
agrees. "If Americans aren't No. 1," he says, "forget it."</p>
<p>In the end, relations between great nations come down to
relations between human beings. For an understanding of where
U.S.-Japan relations have come from and where they may be
headed, here are six conversations with people at the
forefront of dealings between the two countries.</p>
<p>Mitsuya Goto: The Vanquished
</p>
<p>It was May of 1945, and young Mitsuya Goto sat wide-eyed
on the roof of his ancestral home in Nagoya as more than 500
B-29 bombers roared overhead. Most of the city's inhabitants
had scrambled into air-raid shelters, but the young Goto sat
entranced by the awesome sight.</p>
<p>"I wasn't afraid," he recalls. "I could see the faces of
the pilots, and I was very impressed. I felt the strength and
the power of the U.S., and the industrial might of a country
that could deploy so many B-29 bombers. I wasn't mad at the
U.S. I was mad at the Japanese government. I said aloud: `My
God, what have we done?'"</p>
<p>In the years that followed, Mr. Goto came to embody the
postwar attitudes of many Japanese: He was awed by the
superior power of the U.S. and, despite the war's
destruction, embraced his nation's former enemy.</p>
<p>The young Goto worked on his family's farm in Nagoya, but
he rushed home each evening to listen to Armed Forces Radio,
eagerly mimicking the words of the GI announcers. When his
English was good enough, he applied for a job as a translator
with Gen. Douglas MacArthur's occupation forces. And when the
mother of an American friend offered him a chance to study in
the U.S. he jumped at it, earning a degree from Wabash
College in Crawfordsville, Ind. His commencement speech
focused on the image of a frog in a well. "The frog in the
well," he explains, "doesn't know the existence of great
oceans."</p>
<p>The quiet, slender man crossed the great oceans many times
over the next forty years, first as a delegate to the
International Labor Organization and then as a special
assistant to the chairman of Nissan Motors. He became one of
Japan's rare breed of "internationalists," working to
solidify friendships with his country's conquerors. His
generation, he explains, "is still fascinated by Americans.
We remember how generous Americans have been."</p>
<p>But in recent years, as managing director of the Japan
Center for International Exchange, Mr. Goto has watched
attitudes between the two countries take a disturbing turn.
Especially worrisome, he says, is the younger generation of
Japanese, which didn't see the sky-darkening hordes of
bombers overhead. "Some Japanese have become a bit arrogant,"
he says. "I don't like it. The Japanese need to understand
the kind of problems that America has that Japan doesn't."</p>
<p>There is little alternative, he believes. "We have so much
at stake. We have to remain partners."</p>
<p>If Mitsuya Goto is the face Japan showed to the U.S. after
World War II, then Edwin Reischauer is the face the U.S.
showed to Japan.</p>
<p>Born and reared in Japan and married to a Japanese woman,
Mr. Reischauer has lived a life between two cultures. After
starting a Japanese-studies program at Harvard University, he
was named ambassador to Japan by President Kennedy and served
five years in the post. Today, sitting in his retirement home
in San Diego next to a picture of Mount Fuji, he can recite
chapter and verse the major U.S.-Japan scuffles of the
postwar years.</p>
<p>"The first" he recalls, "was the one surrounding the
security treaty of 1960." A residue of harsh feelings from
the war led many Japanese to oppose their country's decision
to form a close military alliance with the U.S. In 1964, one
dissident even attacked Ambassador Reischauer, driving a
knife into his leg. But the security treaty, which was
designed to counter the spread of communism, became a firm
bond that held the two countries together for three decades.</p>
<p>Today, Mr. Reischauer argues, the decline of the Soviet
empire is one reason U.S.-Japan relations have become
strained: The common threat is gone. "You unfortunately find
some people have to have an enemy," he says. "We lost the
Soviet Union, so people got excited about the economic
competition" with Japan. For the first time, he says,
relations between the two countries are "getting close to
what you might call a crisis."</p>
<p>Mr. Reischauer's bicultural background gives him an
unusual understanding of the problems Japanese have in
dealing with the West. There is, for example, Japan's
attention to hierarchy, which leads Japanese to think of
themselves as either subservient or superior to others. "The
Japanese jump immediately from Pax Americana to Pax
Nipponica," he says.</p>
<p>But he puts most of the blame on the U.S. "We've allowed
our industrial skills not to improve as much as we should,"
he says. "We are in danger of becoming a second, a third
world country.</p>
<p>"Cleaning up our own problems," he adds, "would be the
quickest way to foster good relations with Japan."</p>
<p>Wataru Hiraizumi: Newly Confident</p>
<p>"When you look back at what the 20th century was all
about," says Wataru Hiraizumi, slowly sucking on a piece of
Swiss candy, "the big problem was not the cold war, but the
question of Germany, Japan and the U.S." And the biggest
problem of the three, he makes clear, is the U.S. "People
don't realize how dangerous the U.S. can be."</p>
<p>Born in 1929, Mr. Hiraizumi is the son of Kiyoshi
Hiraizumi, a professor of Japanese history who, before the
war, was a passionate nationalist and a believer in the
superiority of Japanese culture. The younger man shared his
father's intellectual pursuits. Now a member of the National
Diet and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, he sits in the
midst of a huge library with titles in Japanese, French,
English and German.</p>
<p>As he speaks, Mr. Hiraizumi pulls an occasional book off
the shelf, such as a 1937 work called "Forty Years of
American-Japanese Relations," which documents "the decline of
American influence and prestige in the Far East before the
relentless growth of Japanese political and economic power."</p>
<p>Most political leaders in Japan try to avoid offending
foreign visitors, but Mr. Hiraizumi enjoys being provocative.
"The U.S. is very difficult to deal with," he explains. "It
is an artificial creation. It was created by people who left
their country to create the best nation in the world. You
consider yourselves superior."</p>
<p>After a pause, he grins and adds: "You have to consider
yourself the best. Otherwise, why don't you go back to Italy?</p>
<p>"The original sin of your culture is your cult of
individuality. It means you cherish `A' people. But the
important thing is how to organize and discipline and educate
`B,' `C,' `D,' `E' and `F' people. You value A people; we
value B, C, D, E and F people. Who wins?" he asks, and with a
smile suggests the answer.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Mr. Hiraizumi believes Japan should be
careful about flexing its muscle and assuming the mantle of
world leadership. "Americans can become very wicked. You
should always try not to anger them," he says.</p>
<p>Robert Mosbacher: Trade Warrior</p>
<p>A needlepoint pillow that used to sit on the sofa in
Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher's office read: "Happiness
is Being an American." Lately, he has replaced it with one
slightly less offensive to his foreign guests: "Free Trade
Avenue is a Two-Way Street."</p>
<p>Mr. Mosbacher is an American -- no apologies. He is also
the Bush administration's leading trade hawk. It is Mr.
Mosbacher who argued in April, unsuccessfully, that the U.S.
should once again cite Japan for unfair actions under the
Trade Reform Act. And it is Mr. Mosbacher who has tried, with
only limited success, to get Washington to provide more aid
to industries fighting Japanese competition.</p>
<p>"I think the American people are just about filled to the
top with this feeling they've been had," he says.</p>
<p>When he talks about relations with Japan, the commerce
secretary uses the term "economic security" as if the nation
were under siege. He happily admits to his desire to see
America remain No. 1. "You could be No. 2 or 3 and lose
control over your economic and possibly military security,"
he says. A picture on one wall shows him standing between two
Sumo wrestlers. Nearby hangs a plaque with a quote it
attributes to Vince Lombardi, the legendary football coach:
"Winning is not a sometime thing, it's an all-time thing."</p>
<p>On at least one occasion the White House has taken him to
task for his hardline views. In response he has learned to
toe the adminstration's line, and even express support for
Secretary of State James Baker's proposal for a "global
partnership" with Japan. But he repeatedly returns to the
idea that Japan is unfair. "You can't be allies," he says,
"with somebody you think is getting to you."</p>
<p>Shunji Taoka: Taking Offense</p>
<p>Mr. Taoka, gaunt-faced writer and editor for the popular
Japanese magazine Aera, sits in a coffee shop in Tokyo and
spins out the following scenario:</p>
<p>"It is the year 2000. Total American overseas debt is more
than $2 trillion. Annual interest payments are $160 billion,
far exceeding today's trade deficit. The U.S. faces two
solutions. It can default on its debt. Or it can print more
dollars and create inflation.</p>
<p>"America decides to default. In response, Japan and other
countries refuse to lend any more to the U.S. So, in the
American tradition, your nation loads up its guns, jumps on
its horse, and heads for the bank." Translation: The U.S.
invades Japan.</p>
<p>Mr. Taoka is quick to say he doesn't believe the
likelihood of such an invasion is high. But he clearly places
it in the realm of possibility.</p>
<p>"This year is the 30th year of the U.S.-Japan security
treaty," he explains. "There have been three radical
developments in this 30th year." The first is the change in
U.S.-Soviet relations. The second is America's soaring
federal debt and the resulting pressure for defense cuts. And
the third is "rising anti-Japan feeling as a result of
Japanese economic power."</p>
<p>Together, he argues, these three changes have cut the
foundation out from under the U.S.-Japan security alliance.</p>
<p>On the coffee shop table, Mr. Taoka lays a copy of the
latest issue of his magazine. The cover story quotes Major
General Henry C. Stackpole, a Marine divisional commander in
Okinawa, as saying that if the U.S. cuts back its forces in
the Pacific, Japan will beef up "what is already a very, very
potent military." The U.S. forces, he said, "are a cap on the
bottle."</p>
<p>Mr. Taoka finds the "cap on the bottle" image -- and other
recent suggestions that Japanese power needs to be
"contained" -- insulting. "It's like giving a room of your
house to a friend who asks for food, and then money, and then
finally goes to your neighbors and says, `My landlord is a
strange person. I'd better stick around and keep an eye on
him.'"</p>
<p>Yet for all his resentment of American attitudes, Mr.
Taoka says he, too, is not yet ready for Japan to chart a
course that is independent of the U.S. "It's not necessary
for Japan to become a superpower," he says. "What is the
benefit? Somebody who is satisfied as head of the Chamber of
Commerce doesn't need to become mayor."</p>
<p>Harry Lonsdale: No Colonization</p>
<p>"My hot button is trees," says Harry Lonsdale, eating
salmon in a 30th-floor restaurant overlooking the city of
Portland. "I think we have to preserve our forests." His
proposal for doing that: Stop exporting logs to Japan.</p>
<p>Flying over Oregon, it's easy to understand why Mr.
Lonsdale feels so strongly. The mountainous state looks like
a patchwork quilt from the air, scarred by rectangular and
trapezoidal bare spots -- the work of loggers. Roughly a
quarter of this timber is exported, mostly to Japan.</p>
<p>Mr. Lonsdale is a candidate for the U.S. Senate,
challenging incumbent Mark Hatfield. As an environmentalist,
he has opposed cutting trees. But as a politician, he has had
to consider as well the interests of the state's lumber
industry.</p>
<p>At a time when the U.S. trade deficit with Japan is still
running at $50 billion a year, stopping any U.S. export to
Japan may seem foolhardy. But Mr. Lonsdale has caught on to a
fundamental truth: It's not just whether the U.S. exports
that matters, but what it exports. "Exporting raw materials,"
he says, "is a third-world task." Or worse, the task of a
colony.</p>
<p>If he could force the Japanese to buy finished wood and
lumber products rather than logs, Mr. Lonsdale figures he
could create more jobs and destroy fewer trees. "In 1980,
Indonesia was shipping raw logs to Japan, and in addition
providing only 1% of Japan's plywood," he notes. "Now they
prohibit raw log exports, and they're shipping 18% of Japan's
plywood."</p>
<p>Mr. Lonsdale's fears about losing pre-eminence to Japan
recall a prediction made by the late Shigeru Yoshida, who was
Japan's prime minister from 1946 to 1954 and who signed the
security treaty giving the U.S. rights to bases in Japan. At
the time, critics said Mr. Yoshida was going to make Japan a
colony of the U.S. But he took a longer-term view.</p>
<p>"Just as the United States was once a colony of Great
Britain but is now the stronger of the two," he said, "if
Japan becomes a colony of the United States, it will also
eventually become the stronger."</p>
