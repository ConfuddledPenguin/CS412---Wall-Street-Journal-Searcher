	<p class="article-leader">LIONEL Corp. -- Standard & Poor's Corp. cut the rating on
the New York-based toy retailer's $59 million of subordinated
debt to triple-C-plus from single-B-plus. The credit-rating
company removed the issue from its CreditWatch list, where it
had been placed Feb. 20. Lionel declined comment on the
rating action. The downgrade stems from a weakening operating
and financial position at the toy retailer, plus "diminishing
prospects for a significant recovery," S&P said.</p>
