	<p class="article-leader">GORBACHEV PROPOSED a looser federation of sovereign Soviet
states.
   In an attempt to hold together a splintering Soviet Union,
the Kremlin leader told the presidents of all 15 republics to
nominate representatives and prepare drafts for a union "that
would have elements of a federation, a confederation or some
such pluralistic relationship." Gorbachev also met separately
with the leaders of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia, the first
such talks since he termed their independence bids illegal,
and progress was reported toward ending the impasse.
Meanwhile, Russia approved a resolution proclaiming its
sovereignty. Gorbachev also indicated flexibility on a united
Germany's membership in the Warsaw Pact and NATO.</p>

"have fallen short of the mark."</p>

<p>The Senate failed by a margin of two votes to override
