	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Business is improving for private antitrust
lawyers, and they have James Rill to thank.
   The Bush administration's chief antitrust enforcer talks
tough. In response, chief executive officers are fretting
about proposed mergers that would have sailed forward during
the hands-off Reagan years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The cop is back on the beat," says John Shenefield, the
Justice Department's antitrust chief in the late 1970s, who
now practices privately here. Joe Sims, a Washington lawyer
and former antitrust official, says he knows of several deals
that have died because of heightened antitrust anxiety.</p>
<p>After only a year in office, Assistant Attorney General
Rill has convinced many in corporate America that, despite
the eight generally dormant years of the Reagan
administration, antitrust enforcement isn't dead. What's
surprising is that he has accomplished this without
challenging any notable mergers cases. In fact, after
preliminary investigations, Mr. Rill has backed away from
several large mergers, including the acquisition of Uniroyal
Goodrich Tire Co. by the French manufacturer Groupe Michelin
and two major accounting-firm mergers that reduced that
business's Big Eight to the Big Six.</p>
<p>Though troubled by those cases, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum
(D., Ohio), a harsh critic of the Reagan antitrust effort,
says of Mr. Rill, "I am far more encouraged with him being in
that position."</p>
<p>Charles Rule, Mr. Rill's Reagan administration
predecessor, says, "From what I can tell, there isn't a case
{brought by Mr. Rill} that I would not have brought."</p>
<p>Mr. Rill says, "If people are taking a hard look at
competition analysis of proposed mergers, that's all to the
good." But he adds, "I'm certainly not trying to jawbone
mergers that would pass muster under the {government's}
guidelines."</p>
<p>Mr. Rill says he has challenged 10 mergers since taking
office last June, while his predecessor challenged six in the
comparable period from June 1988 through May 1989. The
difference is greater than the numbers would indicate.</p>
<p>Mr. Rill has commanded attention by launching potentially
explosive investigations of alleged price-fixing by elite
Eastern colleges and by the major airlines. Even dentists
have become targets: Earlier this year, Mr. Rill had three of
them indicted in Tuscon, Ariz., for conspiring to fix patient
fees.</p>
<p>"He has carried through on previous threats" to police
health care, and other service industries could be next, says
Irving Scher, a past president of the American Bar
Association's antitrust section.</p>
<p>Lately, Mr. Rill has led the Bush administration's effort
to inject U.S. antitrust law into trade relations. He has
helped elicit promises from Japanese officials that they
would enforce their own long-dormant antitrust laws against
Japanese firms that collude to exclude U.S. imports. Going
further, Mr. Rill has threatened to prosecute foreign
companies that violate U.S. antitrust laws, even if the
"anti-competitive" actions take place overseas.</p>
<p>Compared to his Reagan administration predecessors, most
of whom came from academic backgrounds and adhered to an
extreme version of free-market economic theory, Mr. Rill is a
pragmatist. A career private attorney, he is more interested
in facts and figures than in arguments that mergers improve
overall efficiency. In this regard, he has a philosophical
ally in Janet Steiger, the relatively new chairman of the
Federal Trade Commission, which shares antitrust authority
with the Justice Department.</p>
<p>The Reagan administration's attitude toward antitrust
"invited transactions that otherwise wouldn't have been put
forward," says Robert Pitofsky, who teaches antitrust law at
Georgetown University.</p>
<p>Though he hasn't challenged any huge mergers yet, Mr. Rill
sends a message with the smaller cases he brings: his taking
legal actions that led to a restructuring of Gillette Co.'s
recent acquisition of some of Wilkinson Sword Inc.'s
international shaving-blade business. The result was the
preservation of Wilkinson's U.S. blade business as a separate
competitor against Gillette. Under the Reagan administration,
says Mr. Pitofsky, the deal "would have gone through" as
originally proposed.</p>
<p>Mr. Rill applauds the 15-year trend in antitrust law
emphasizing economic analysis instead of the populist
anti-corporate rhetoric of earlier eras. But in contrast to
his predecessors, he believes in enforcing the laws as
they're written. The Reagan regulators didn't prosecute a
single case of so-called vertical price-fixing, which can
take the form of a manufacturer conspiring with list-price
retailers to shut out discount retailers. Mr. Rill says that
he's now considering bringing the first such case in a
decade.</p>
<p>But concerning antitrust situations involving Japanese
companies, Mr. Rill faces a sizable problem. Japanese
officials can't be counted on to eliminate collusive
corporate practices which they have spent years perfecting,
notes William Perry, an international trade lawyer. Moreover,
if Mr. Rill attempts to sue foreign companies in U.S. courts,
he'll face stiff jurisdictional defenses.</p>
<p>Moreover, Mr. Rill doesn't have the troops to fight all
his court battles at home, let alone to start new ones
abroad. The Reagan administration cut the Antitrust Division
staff by roughly 50%. Mr. Rill has added reinforcements for
the first time in nine years, but his tiny additions aren't
secure and could disappear next year as the Justice
Department continues to shift resources toward anti-drug
enforcement.</p>
<p>Many private lawyers charge that the quality of the
division's lawyers fell during the Reagan years. Mr. Rill
disputes the charge but acknowledges that it's tough
recruiting young lawyers who can earn far more working for
private firms than the government's starting salary of
$30,000.</p>
<p>If he is to leave a lasting imprint, Mr. Rill will have to
win White House backing to rebuild an enforcement unit that
abated in the 1980s.</p>
