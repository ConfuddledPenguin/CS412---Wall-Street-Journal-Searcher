	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Diamonds may become one of the world's most
glittering technologies.
   A report by the National Research Council said that new
ways of making thin coatings of synthetic diamond and other
superhard materials may revolutionize electronics, optics and
machinery. "The ultimate economic impact of this technology
may well outstrip that of high-temperature superconductors,"
said the report, referring to the discovery of a new class of
materials that conduct electricity without resistance.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The report by the council, an arm of the National Academy
of Sciences, projected a host of uses for diamond technology.
Computer chips made from superhard materials should be able
to function at higher power, speed and temperature than
conventional ones. That could improve the performance of
machinery ranging from spacecraft to supercomputers, the
report predicted.</p>
<p>The report did not predict when these potential uses would
come into being. "Despite this promise, there are relatively
few applications currently being realized," it cautioned.
That's partly because chemists don't yet understand well
enough exactly how the synthetic diamonds form and grow, and
how to speed up the process.</p>
<p>John Venables, a former Martin Marietta Corp. scientist
who led the council's study, said he expected it will take
about five years to develop advanced optical coatings and 10
years to develop diamond computer chips.</p>
