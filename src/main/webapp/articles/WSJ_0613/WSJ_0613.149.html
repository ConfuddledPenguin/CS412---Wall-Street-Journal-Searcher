	<p class="article-leader">Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken of Sweden said group
operating profit for the first four months of this year
jumped 10% to 1.64 billion kronor ($267.3 million) from 1.49
billion kronor a year earlier, and predicted a 10% increase
for the full year.
   Sweden's biggest bank, known as SE Banken, cited a 40%
surge in foreign currency-denominated lending. But as foreign
currency credits have lower profit margins than lending in
kronor, SE Banken's net interest margin fell to 2.23% from
2.41%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>SE Banken also outlined plans for a 600 million-kronor
offering of new shares to its three allies in Scandinavian
Banking Partners. The offering, representing about 3% of SE
Banken's share capital outstanding, will be subscribed by
Union Bank of Finland, Den norske Bank of Norway and Unibank
Denmark. The four banks formed the group five years ago to
circumvent regulations that then prevented cross-border
banking in Scandinavia. They agreed to swap stakes, but SE
Banken was barred from this by laws banning foreign ownership
in Swedish banks, a curb Sweden's parliament is expected to
scrap soon.</p>
