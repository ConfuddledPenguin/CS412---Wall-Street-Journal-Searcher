	<p class="article-leader">Here's what Jerrold Ziman got when he bought a $280,000
four-story house in Manhattan: an 11-by-13-foot
bedroom-kitchen-dining-living room and six years in court. He
made a mistake. He assumed the law would protect his property
rights.
   New York's housing market has long been the standard model
for Econ 101 lessons on how rent control leads to housing
shortages, tenants who can't afford to move and landlords who
can't afford to keep up buildings. Abstract principles are
hard reality for the Ziman family.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>When Jerrold and Ellen Ziman moved from Los Angeles to New
York with their two young children, they found a small town
house on quaint Minetta Street in Greenwich Village. The
200-year-old house had been divided into small apartments,
and three were occupied by rent-control tenants. The Zimans
planned to make it a one-family home again.</p>
<p>Their nightmare began soon after they bought the house in
February 1984. At the time, owners could leave the rental
market and evict tenants if they planned to occupy the
property themselves. The Zimans asked the state housing
regulators to start the eviction process.</p>
<p>But in June 1984, New York changed the rules. A new law
said that tenants who had lived in apartments for more than
20 years could not be evicted just because the owner wanted
to occupy his property. Instead, owners would have to prove
"undue hardship," meaning an annual return of less than 8.5%.
The two tenants in the Ziman house pay regulated monthly
rents of $159 and $180, a fraction of the going market rate
or the $20,000 annual expense of maintaining the rental
units.</p>
<p>So proving hardship should have been easy, but it wasn't.
It took two audits over several years for bureaucrats in the
rent-control agency eventually to admit the Zimans were
suffering financial hardship. Then the state concocted a
bizarre new argument to deny the eviction request. The Zimans
should lose, the agency argued, because they were motivated
chiefly by the desire to occupy their house, not chiefly by
the bankrupting economic losses.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the Zimans said this was unconstitutional and
absurd. "They have lost the ability to exclude strangers from
their house, they have been forced to become landlords and
they have been required to bear a hugely disproportionate
share of the costs" of rent control.</p>
<p>After years of hearings, litigation and appeals, New
York's highest court two weeks ago ruled for the Zimans. A
one-page opinion found "unrefuted evidence of hardship." The
court ruling means the housing agency must begin eviction
proceedings against the tenants, but the agency hasn't acted
yet.</p>
<p>The Zimans eventually should be able to make a home of
their house, but the cost has been enormous. The family has
lived in what they assumed would be temporary quarters of an
apartment in the house of less than 350 square feet-smaller
than the typical hotel room. In 1986, they got access to
another 350-square feet on another floor, where their
adolescent son now sleeps.</p>
<p>Mr. Ziman, who jokes that he became a "jailhouse lawyer,"
gave up his career in entertainment for his newly found
specialty, real estate. He has legal bills of $100,000, which
would be much more without voluntary legal help from two
free-market public-interest groups, the Competitive
Enterprise Institute in Washington and the Pacific Legal
Foundation in California. CEI lawyer Sam Kazman, who handled
much of the litigation, calls this case "a small step for the
Zimans, one giant step for Manhattankind."</p>
<p>Mr. Kazman plans to file a further lawsuit that might
teach bureaucrats a lesson. Recent U.S. Supreme Court cases
say that the Constitution's Fifth Amendment takings clause
entitles people to reimbursement for even temporary takings
of their property through unlawful government action. The
Zimans want payments from New York for the years of lost use
of their house. The state already lost a takings case to
owners of unlawfully regulated single-room-occupancy
buildings.</p>
<p>Getting housing regulators to think twice about giving
owners the runaround would help many landlords who can't
afford legal help. An Arthur D. Little study in 1985 found
that most landlords owned one building, had incomes of
between $10,000 and $40,000 -- 30% had incomes less than
$20,000 -- and were immigrants. Who else would be naive
enough to invest in residential apartments in New York?</p>
<p>Tenants tend to be from a different class. Rent-controlled
apartments are mostly in middle- and upper-class
neighborhoods. The Zimans say one of their holdout tenants
goes on an opera tour of Italy every summer. In his recent
book, "The Excluded Americans: Homelessness and Housing
Policies," William Tucker disclosed several regulated sweet
rents in a city where $1,000 is market rent for a standard
one-bedroom apartment:</p>
<p>Mayor David Dinkins pays $711.99 for a three-bedroom
apartment in a middle-class development. When he was mayor,
Ed Koch paid $411.49 for a one-bedroom apartment in Greenwich
Village. A former housing-court judge, Jay Stuart Dankberg,
paid $75.15 for a two-bedroom near Gramercy Park. Among
apartments overlooking Central Park are those of Manfred
Ohrenstein, Democratic leader in the state Senate ($2,070.67
for 11 rooms); Mia Farrow ($2,272.43 for 11 rooms); and
Alistair Cooke ($1,357.66 for eight rooms).</p>
<p>Token rents and high costs at the lower end of the market
help explain why some 1,500 units of housing are simply
abandoned in the city every month. State legislators issued a
report in 1987 entitled "Bleak House" of how hyperregulation
causes "hardship for thousands of people every year and in
the most extreme cases directly contributes to displacement
and homelessness."</p>
<p>An upstate legislator last week introduced a bill that
would end rent control for any family with an income of
$100,000. A vicious circle makes a political solution
unlikely-rent control causes a limited supply of housing
causes higher market prices causes winners in the
rent-control game to dig in their heels.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Zimans say some of their friends are
ambivalent about their victory because they can't imagine
life without their own rent-controlled apartments. "My
friends in New York just don't understand that a free market
could get them better housing at a better price," Mrs. Ziman,
a pre-school teacher, says.</p>
<p>Economics aside, Mr. Ziman says he's discovered that rent
control creates a perverse mentality that sounds a lot like
what we recently called Soviet-bloc thinking. "Rent control
makes thieves of normal people," he says. "The city and state
undermine common honesty and integrity by allowing a system
built on a few winners and many losers of their own
property."</p>
