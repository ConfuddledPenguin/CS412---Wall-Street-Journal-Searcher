	<p class="article-leader">PREPAID-TUITION TRUSTS press the IRS in court and in
private for exemption.
   At least a dozen states are working on plans to help
parents finance college costs with prepaid contracts made
while a child is young. Innovator Michigan has amassed over
$350 million from over 40,000 contracts. But backers say the
programs' growth is being stifled by an IRS ruling that the
Michigan Education Trust must pay annual corporate taxes on
its earnings, in addition to the deferred taxes that students
will pay as gains are withdrawn for tuition. So Michigan and
Ohio are taking the offensive.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Michigan's trust paid its first taxes for fiscal 1988.
Last month, it sued in federal court for a refund on
constitutional and other grounds, arguing it performs an
exempt essential government function for the state.
Meanwhile, the Ohio Tuition Trust is urging the IRS to
reverse itself and rule that the plans are exempt essential
functions and is lobbying the White House and Congress for
support. Ohio hopes to get an IRS ruling by next fall.</p>
<p>Ohio figures taxes add 10-15% to the price of its tuition
contract.</p>
<p>THE IRS GEARS UP to clamp down on filers that don't give
IDs to banks.</p>
<p>The 1983 tax act requires financial institutions that make
interest, dividend, and other nonwage payments to report
recipients' Social Security or other identification numbers
to the IRS. Recipients that don't supply numbers are subject
to a 20% withholding tax; payers that don't use due diligence
to get correct numbers are subject to penalty. But in working
out the procedures, the IRS repeatedly has delayed the
enforcement program.</p>
<p>Now the IRS says it is ready to crack down. It is about to
send to payers lists of customers for which the payers' 1988
reports lacked numbers or had faulty ones. Within 60 days,
payers must certify that they have exercised due diligence.
Later this year, the IRS adds, it will inform payers of
discrepancies on 1989 reports. Then the payers must notify
the customers that the 20% withholding will begin if they
don't supply correct numbers within 30 days.</p>
<p>A BIZARRE VICTORY over the IRS ends with a financial
setback.</p>
<p>Thomas J. Smith, once an Illinois state tax official
handling liaison with the IRS, won the victory in January
1989. As we reported, he hadn't filed federal returns for two
years. IRS District Director Ira Loeb informed Smith's boss;
Smith later lost his job. He sued the U.S. for illegal
disclosure of taxpayer data. U.S. Judge Mills ruled that Loeb
had ignored procedures meant to protect taxpayer privacy,
making the U.S. liable for damages. The judge scheduled a
further trial to determine the amount.</p>
<p>Smith sought $6 million in compensatory and punitive
damages. But earlier this year, Judge Mills said the illegal
disclosure didn't cause Smith's discharge and awarded only
$1,000 and certain costs, as prescribed for the federal-law
violation. Smith's lawyer, whose fee was contingent on the
outcome, spent 1,000 hours and $18,735 of his own money on
the case. Now, in a "postscript," the judge says Smith hasn't
met the narrow standard for winning legal fees.</p>
<p>Further, only a small share of the lawyer's expenses
qualify for recovery.</p>
<p>VISITORS TO CANADA are to get fast rebates of the 7% goods
and services tax due to take effect Jan. 1 if the Canadian
Senate approves. Besides giving rebates by mail, Revenue
Canada will authorize duty-free shops to issue instant cash
rebates of certain hotel and merchandise taxes.</p>
<p>HIDDEN INCOME that the self-employed omit from Schedule C
of personal returns accounts for 40% of the personal tax gap,
the IRS figures. Now it's extending to 1988 and 1989 returns
a special Schedule C audit program that has covered 1983-87
returns reporting receipts exceeding $100,000.</p>
<p>WIPE OUT GRAFFITI, says the California state Senate. It
adopts a bill that would permit the creation of special
districts to tax marking substances and applicators to pay
for the removal of graffiti in public places. The bill goes
next to the state Assembly.</p>
<p>MULTINATIONALS LOBBY to overturn IRS rules on state-tax
deductions.</p>
<p>States are barred from taxing corporate income earned
beyond their borders, but many use formulas for taxable
income that the IRS says result in taxes attributable to
income from foreign sources. After more than a decade of
wrestling with the issue, the IRS in 1988 proposed rules
requiring multinationals to allocate certain state taxes to
foreign income, thus denying deductions from U.S. income.
Companies say they are caught between state and IRS
positions.</p>
<p>The companies say the rules increase their costs,
especially in comparison with foreign concerns operating in
the U.S. So they have mounted a lobbying campaign for two
bills -- H.R. 4512, backed by Rep. Thomas (R., Calif.) and
others, and S. 2584, entered by Sen. Boren (D., Okla.) and
others. The bills would let companies allocate all deductions
for state and local income and franchise taxes to U.S.
income. The lobbyists include the U.S. Chamber of Commerce
and several industry associations.</p>
<p>The Multistate Tax Commission supports the bills on behalf
of 23 states.</p>
<p>BRIEFS: To pamper the environment, Wisconsin exempts cloth
diapers and diaper services from sales tax, but not
disposable diapers. . . . Texas has no income tax. It adds
other distinctions with new law to reform education
financing: A 15-cent rise to 41 cents a pack gives it the
highest state cigarette levy. Its 6.25% sales tax becomes the
highest in the 15 southern states.</p>
