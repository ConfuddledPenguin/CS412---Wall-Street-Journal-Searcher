	<p class="article-leader">GALVESTON, Texas -- Black, billowing smoke turned to gray
and white as firefighters conquered the blaze aboard the Mega
Borg oil tanker 57 miles southeast of here in the Gulf of
Mexico.
   Coast Guard officials and firefighters said chances are
now slim that the disabled ship will sink, but that crude oil
from the Mega Borg continues to pour into the Gulf and a
major spill is still a possibility.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But even as the fight to save the tanker appeared to show
signs of success, Smit International Group -- the
Rotterdam-based marine salvage firm handling the fire --
found itself criticized for moving too slowly. Critics allege
that the company wasted valuable hours after the fire started
early Saturday bringing in special equipment from overseas,
shunning locally available materials and equipment.</p>
<p>If Smit had moved sooner to use foam, some critics
contend, the blaze might not have taken as long to bring
under control. After a series of explosions on Sunday
afternoon, the fire grew so large that foam could no longer
be used effectively. "I'm no expert in this matter, but it's
my reasoned speculation that if we had the equipment
available at a short distance, we might have been able to
contain it sooner," said Tom Henderson, special assistant to
the Texas Land Commissioner.</p>
<p>Williams Boots & Coots Inc., a firefighting and material
supplier, claimed that it and Minnesota Mining &
Manufacturing Corp. had their proposal for on-the-spot local
equipment and chemicals rejected by Smit while it searched
for equipment compatible with its own chemicals. "The talents
and the hardware and the chemicals that were here to get the
foam to the fire were not used," said Dwight Williams,
president of Williams Boots.</p>
<p>A Smit official in Rotterdam declined to comment on the
allegations, but he maintained that Smit can get its European
coordinators on the spot to manage affairs anywhere in the
world within 12 hours.</p>
<p>Most of the oil spill appears to be contained -- for the
moment, at least. Of the more than 100,000 gallons of crude
oil that has spilled since fire broke out on the Mega Borg
early Saturday, only about 2,000 gallons remain on the waters
of the Gulf. The rest of the light crude either burned away
as it left the tanker, was sucked up by skimmers or
dissipated by dispersants and evaporated. By comparison, the
Exxon Valdez dumped nearly 11 million gallons of heavy crude
into the waters of Prince William Sound, Alaska, in March
1989.</p>
<p>But authorities are still preparing for a major spill,
possible if the Mega Borg loses more of its 38.2 million
gallon cargo when attempts are made -- perhaps late this week
-- to steady the listing ship in order to move the remaining
crude oil onto another vessel.</p>
<p>Just in case, additional skimmers have been borrowed,
including one that's coming from Tampico, Mexico, at 10 miles
an hour and will take several days to arrive. Contractors are
lining up other equipment in case of a major spill.</p>
<p>Mr. Henderson, the Land Commission official, said that if
the bulk of the Mega Borg's cargo spills, it's a lost cause.
"Nobody's ready for a spill that size," he said. "We don't
have the capability to clean up that kind of spill."</p>
<p>He and other government and industry officials hope that
the threat posed by the Mega Borg's fire and explosion will
be enough to speed plans to improve the nation's preparedness
for major oil spills. Despite widespread studies, proposed
programs and legislation since the Valdez accident last year,
little has actually changed.</p>
<p>A Texas governor's oil-spill advisory committee --
established because of and since Valdez -- has prepared
extensive recommendations on procedures and equipment
necessary to prevent and fight oil spills, and specifically
took note of the dangers involved in "lightering" -- the
process of unloading crude from one ship to another that the
Mega Borg was involved in when the fire broke out. He added
that some 70 to 80 such transfers take place each month off
the coast of Texas alone.</p>
<p>An ambitious $400 million plan by the oil and
petrochemical industry to establish five regional centers,
each with 52 staffers and $24 million in equipment, is
stalled until Congress works out sticky liability questions.
And even once Congress acts, "it's {another} two years before
there is full operational capability," estimates Bill Taylor,
a spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute, a trade
group.</p>
<p>Mosvolds Rederi AS, operator of the Mega Borg, said that
it holds $700 million in extended pollution insurance
coverage through Gard Assuranceforening, a mutually owned
Norwegian insurer. Mosvolds is a 90-year-old, family-owned
shipping concern based in Farsund, a port city on Norway's
southwestern coast. Mosvolds holds a 40% stake in the limited
partnership that owns the Mega Borg and has operated it on
charter since 1984, company officials said.</p>
<p>Geir Larsen, Mosvolds's president, declined to discuss
possible legal liability for the cleanup of the Mega Borg oil
spill. "We'll leave that to the lawyers."</p>
<p>The cause of the fire and explosions that ripped through
the tanker still hasn't been determined. Norwegian goverment
officials will start an investigation today, talking to the
captain and crew of the ship.</p>
