	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- Japonica Partners said it acquired $25.1
million of Allegheny International Inc. senior unsecured
claims from a group of insurance company holders.
   Japonica said that with the latest purchase its debt
holdings would translate into more than 50% ownership under
Allegheny's proposed plan of reorganization, and that the New
York investor group has begun negotiating a "change of
control" agreement with management.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But an Allegheny spokesman asserted that "there are no
negotiations regarding a change of control." Moreover, he
added, "Allegheny questions Japonica's calculations" about
how much stock Japonica's debt holdings are actually worth.
Allegheny is operating under Chapter 11 of the federal
Bankruptcy Code.</p>
<p>Japonica and Allegheny have proposed rival reorganization
plans for the company, whose major businesses are Sunbeam and
Oster small appliances. The Allegheny management plan to
exchange stock for creditor claims was voted down by
creditors. However, the company filed suit claiming that
Japonica acted in bad faith in buying up creditor claims with
the intent to vote them against management's reorganization
plan. Japonica countered with a lawsuit of its own. Those
lawsuits are still pending.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, creditors voted late last week on a plan from
Japonica to pay creditors about $655 million in cash, much of
it borrowed from banks. Results of that vote will be reported
to the bankruptcy court later this month, but several people
involved in the dispute said the Japonica plan was rejected.</p>
<p>Wilbur Ross, a senior manager for Rothschild Inc., New
York, who represents Allegheny's unsecured creditors, said
that "if our math is right, Japonica would have an absolute
majority of the stock {under Allegheny's reorganization
plan}. Ultimately, control follows ownership." He added,
however, that the exact time and form of the transfer of
control are difficult to predict because the bankruptcy
proceedings have been complicated.</p>
