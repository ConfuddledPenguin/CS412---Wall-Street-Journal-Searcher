	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- A dissident director of Goldcorp Investments
Ltd. and a former director of the company's subsidiaries have
launched a proxy battle against management to gain seats on
the Goldcorp board.
   James McCartney, a partner at the Toronto law firm of
McCarthy Tetrault, said he and Robert Simon, senior vice
president and treasurer of Brascan Ltd., plan to stand for
election at the Goldcorp annual meeting, scheduled for June
25. Goldcorp is an investment concern based here.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. McCartney said Mr. Simon currently serves on the
Goldcorp board but hasn't been renominated by management.
Last April, Mr. McCartney was replaced by management nominees
on the boards of Dickenson Gold Mines Ltd. and Wharf
Resources Ltd., both Goldcorp subsidiaries.</p>
<p>In a proxy solicitation document, Mr. McCartney and Mr.
Simon question, among other things, the fees paid by Goldcorp
to CSA Management Ltd., which controls virtually all the
votes in Goldcorp through its holding of common shares.</p>
<p>Goldcorp's Class A shareholders, with limited voting
powers, are entitled to elect two directors, which are the
positions that Mr. McCartney and Mr. Simon are hoping to
fill.</p>
<p>CSA Management is 51% controlled by the family of Robert
McEwen, who serves as president of Goldcorp, and as chairman
and chief executive of Dickenson and Wharf.</p>
<p>Mr. McEwen said allegations made in the proxy solicitation
circular are "without merit." He said the Goldcorp board will
meet tomorrow to come up with a response.</p>
