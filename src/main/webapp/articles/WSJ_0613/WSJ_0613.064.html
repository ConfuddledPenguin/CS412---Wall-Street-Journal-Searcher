	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- The Chicago Sun-Times dismissed a free-lance
feature columnist who it accused of plagiarizing two stories
from the New York Times.
   Editor and Senior Vice President Dennis A. Britton told
readers in a page 3 "apology to our readers" that columnist
Ken Dychtwald had copied material from two news stories in
the Times. Mr. Dychtwald's Age Wave column on health and
longevity trends is syndicated nationally by King Features
Syndicate, a division of Hearst Corp. The Sun-Times had an
independent contract with the writer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The stories in question appeared only in the Sun-Times,
according to a spokeswoman for Mr. Dychtwald.</p>
<p>Based in Emeryville, Calif., Mr. Dychtwald wrote two
columns on aging in March and April that Mr. Britton said
contained portions of two bylined stories from the Times. Mr.
Britton's letter apologized for a "breach of one of the most
basic tenets of journalism." He also apologized to the two
Times reporters.</p>
<p>The Sun-Times also published a statement from Mr.
Dychtwald, in which he said that one of the incidents was an
"inadvertent" error by his staff. He said that in the other
instance, he "mistakenly believed" that he needed to cite
only a study referred to in the Times article and not the
Times story itself.</p>
<p>Mr. Dychtwald and spokesmen for King Features couldn't be
reached for comment.</p>
