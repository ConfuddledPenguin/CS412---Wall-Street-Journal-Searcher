	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Key players in the budget summit agreed to
try to jumpstart the stalled talks next week in the hopes of
making significant headway before the end of the month.
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.) told
White House Budget Director Richard Darman and Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady that he will convene negotiators
"night and day or weekends" beginning next Wednesday,
according to Senate Budget Chairman James Sasser (D., Tenn.),
who was present when they met. The administration officials
and other important congressional negotiators concurred.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sen. Sasser and House Budget Chairman Leon Panetta (D.,
Calif.), said they expect the negotiators finally will begin
discussing deficit-reduction proposals next week. But aides
to Republican negotiators were far less sanguine, saying
there was little new reason to be optimistic about the talks.</p>
<p>Administration and congressional negotiators have met
twice a week for a month, but so far they have accomplished
little besides studying the federal budget and various
economic scenarios. "We're delighted that there's a mutual
interest in speeding up the process," an administration
official said yesterday.</p>
<p>Mr. Gephardt told Mr. Darman and Mr. Brady over lunch at
the Capitol that he still is aiming for some sort of
deficit-reduction accord before July 4. Administration
officials are skeptical that can happen. But Sen. Sasser, who
has been more pessimistic than his colleagues about the
budget summit, said yesterday that the odds of an agreement
by that date are "better than 50-50."</p>
