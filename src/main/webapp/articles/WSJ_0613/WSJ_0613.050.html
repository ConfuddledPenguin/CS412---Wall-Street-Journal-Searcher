	<p class="article-leader">CAMPEAU Corp. (Toronto) -- Conrad Black, a Toronto
financier and Hollinger Inc. chairman and chief executive
officer, resigned as a director of this real estate and
retailing concern, citing demands on his time, reducing board
membership to 10. Campeau said two new independent directors
will be named in due course. Mr. Black was appointed a
director last September, when Campeau named a new board and
said it would attempt to restructure its U.S. retailing
units, Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores
Corp., which last January sought protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.</p>
