	<p class="article-leader">The people who run the College Board exams want to put
office workers to the test.
   Educational Testing Service, publisher of the Scholastic
Aptitude Test and other educational and professional exams,
is developing a series of products that would assess basic
workplace skills, from computer know-how to secretarial savvy
to memo-writing ability.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Today the Princeton, N.J., company is to announce its
first products for the office-testing field, a series of
software packages to probe proficiency on a variety of
word-processing programs used in millions of businesses
around the country. Tests for less concrete skills are still
in the developmental stage.</p>
<p>If they catch on, the new E.T.S. tests -- billed by a
spokeswoman as the "S.A.T.s" of the workplace -- could prompt
a shake-up in the burgeoning employee evaluation industry.
E.T.S.'s prominence as the nation's best-known testing
company stands to give its workplace tests added credibility.
This could encourage the spread of employee testing,
especially among employers concerned about liability for
administering tests that are deemed unfair, experts say.</p>
<p>Companies now can sort among thousands of testing products
and techniques, from written personality and integrity tests
to computer-based simulations of corporate dilemmas. A recent
Ford Foundation study charged that much workplace testing has
grown out of control, with little regulation existing to
verify test validity and to ensure that tests aren't biased
in themselves or misused by companies.</p>
<p>E.T.S. hasn't escaped criticism. Some educators say the
company hasn't done enough to discourage colleges from using
its tests as the sole standard to judge applicants. And the
company's new workplace tests could be abused because
employers will be free to buy and administer them without
supervision.</p>
<p>But E.T.S.'s reputation is bound to give it a strategic
edge. One possible result, observers say, could be the first
nationally accepted benchmarks for judging secretaries,
clerks and other entry-level workers, a group assailed by
many employers for lacking basic qualifications.</p>
<p>"E.T.S.'s entry into this kind of testing will clearly add
value and credibility," says Walter M. Haney, a senior
research associate with Boston College's Center for the Study
of Testing, Evaluation and Educational Policy.</p>
<p>E.T.S. itself isn't shy about heralding its impact. The
name "is like a Good Housekeeping seal of approval," a
spokesman says.</p>
<p>The company is "not looking to make bundles and bundles of
money in the short run" with workplace testing, says Alice
Irby, an E.T.S. vice president overseeing the venture. E.T.S.
revenue, which has increased steadily for the past five
years, reached $256 million in the year ending June 30, 1989.</p>
<p>But E.T.S. faces troubles in its largest longtime market:
college admissions testing. A decline in the population of
high school seniors caused a modest slide in the S.A.T.
business last year, to just under two million tests
administered. And if demographic projections hold, demand may
drop for the company's range of professional-school
admissions tests, too.</p>
<p>E.T.S. has moved to diversify. The company makes
certification and licensing tests for dozens of industries
and professions, from architecture to food preparation to
teaching. E.T.S. also has taken on a variety of private
companies as clients in recent years, evaluating their
internal training and testing programs.</p>
<p>Overall demand for employee evaluation is huge. About half
of all companies conduct some form of competency testing,
mostly among job applicants, according to a recent American
Management Association survey. And the number is expected to
grow, as companies step up their efforts to find the best
workers they can in a shrinking pool of young people.</p>
<p>E.T.S. contends its new products will differ from many
current personnel tests because they will be computer-based,
and will generate diagnoses for further training as well as
assessments. "One thing that's happened in corporate training
programs is that companies never know whether that training
takes," Ms. Irby says.</p>
<p>The software packages set for announcement today are
designed to test users of WordPerfect, DisplayWrite, and
Microsoft Word, three popular word-processing programs. The
tests will take between 20 and 30 minutes each. They will run
through a variety of tasks and then score performance -- and
recommend additional training -- in such areas as editing
skills, file management and document creation. Each
test-taker will also receive one of three ratings: junior,
senior or specialist. (Anyone taking a test presumably would
have at least some experience with the program in question.)</p>
<p>E.T.S. developed the tests in conjunction with closely
held Kee Incorp, Columbia, Md., which markets computer
training classes. Kee had tried to develop the tests on its
own, but clients balked because they weren't certain about
the validity of the exams, says Doug Becker, Kee's executive
vice-president.</p>
<p>E.T.S. agreed to become a partner but "required that we
rebuild the test from scratch" to ensure fairness, he says.</p>
<p>Kee says it trained 300,000 people last year in one-day
classes on various software programs. The new software tests
are to be marketed through subscriptions costing $795
annually, with additional charges for each product. "Demand
for a program like this is in the tens of millions of
dollars," Mr. Becker says.</p>
<p>Kee and E.T.S. are beginning work on tests, expected about
a year from now, that will gauge expertise on Lotus 1-2-3 and
other spreadsheet programs. Other exams are under
consideration to measure how well people can handle data base
and operating system programs, Mr. Becker says.</p>
<p>More broadly, E.T.S. is developing a variety of "workplace
literacy" exams for testing and training employees at all
corporate levels, from clerks to managers, Ms. Irby says.</p>
<p>It's too early to know how such tests will turn out, Ms.
Irby says, but they will probably involve interactive
video-based systems, offering test-takers a chance to answer
questions via computer. Such technology is the basis for a
new 20-hour training and testing program E.T.S. has helped
develop for appraising nursing assistants, Ms. Irby says. The
tests for general office skills may be ready within two
years, she adds.</p>
<p>One arena likely to be affected by the word-processing
exams is the temporary-help industry. Olsten Corp., Westbury,
N.Y., is installing the E.T.S./Kee programs in its 540 temp
offices, and believes they will lead to a "more precise
match" between client needs and the secretaries sent into the
workplace. But the nation's largest temp company, Manpower
Inc., based in Milwaukee, questioned whether the new exams
would prove superior to word-processing tests it developed
for its offices.</p>
<p>Testing industry experts say that the new tests, simply
because their focus is so specific, may mark an improvement
over many broad-based employment exams currently available.</p>
<p>But the tests could prove problematic, they say, if
employers set fixed cutoff scores and use the exams to
exclude workers who may be worth hiring and training. "A test
is a tool that can be used or applied poorly," says Mr. Haney
of Boston College.</p>
<p>Cinthia Schuman, executive director of the National Center
for Fair and Open Testing, a Cambridge, Mass., test-reform
group, says employers shouldn't latch onto the tests simply
because they may be billed as "validated" by E.T.S., given
the company's role in developing them, too.</p>
<p>"Where are the people completely outside the system who
have no financial stake in the outcome?" she asks. "Where are
they in the process? That's what independent validation is."</p>
