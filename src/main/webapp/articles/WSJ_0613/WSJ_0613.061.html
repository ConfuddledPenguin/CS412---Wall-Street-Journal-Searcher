	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- UAL Corp.'s Chief Financial Officer John C.
Pope, as expected, said he would resign if the proposed
employee buy-out of United Airlines succeeds.
   United's three unions have made no secret that they want
to oust Mr. Pope, who is second in rank only to Chairman
Stephen M. Wolf.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The labor group already picked Chrysler's former vice
chairman Gerald Greenwald to succeed Mr. Wolf, and now is
seeking an airline executive to take over many of Mr. Pope's
duties. Mr. Pope also served as UAL's executive vice
president for marketing.</p>
<p>Relations between Mr. Pope and UAL's pilot union have been
strained ever since an earlier union-management bid collapsed
last fall. Mr. Pope handled the financing effort for that
bid. When it failed, banks cited Mr. Pope's negotiating
tactics, in part, for their refusal to finance the offer.</p>
<p>Mr. Pope is the second top executive to announce his
resignation. On Monday, Barry A. Kotar resigned as chief
executive officer of the Covia computerized reservations unit
to take a post with NWA Inc., parent of Northwest Airlines.
The UAL employee group intends to spin off Covia if the $4.38
billion buy-out succeeds.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwald, the employees' chairman-designate, visited
UAL headquarters yesterday in an effort to convince most
members of senior management to remain. Mr. Greenwald must
show banks that UAL will have a strong management team under
employee ownership in order to obtain financing for the
offer.</p>
