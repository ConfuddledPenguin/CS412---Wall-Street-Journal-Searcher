	<p class="article-leader">MINNEAPOLIS --Michael Foods Inc. has removed John M.
Stafford as head of its egg division, which represents about
half the company's sales.
   A former chief executive officer of Pillsbury Co., Mr.
Stafford, 53 years old, had served in that position only a
few months. He remains executive vice president and a
director of the company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Stafford, who confirmed his removal from the post,
declined further comment beyond saying there were several
projects he may be assigned to. A Michael Foods spokesman
declined to discuss the unannounced change, saying the
company doesn't comment on personnel matters.</p>
<p>Succeeding Mr. Stafford will be Daniel Gardner, 65,
chairman of Milton G. Waldbaum Co., a Wakefield, Neb., egg
producer, which Michael recently acquired.</p>
<p>The management change came as a rival concern, Papetti
High-Grade Egg Products Co. of Elizabeth, N.J., confirmed it
is supplying a pasteurized egg product to Burger King Corp.,
the fast-food chain unit of Grand Metropolitan PLC. Burger
King is believed to be the largest customer for Michael's
Easy Eggs ultra-pasteurized product.</p>
