	<p class="article-leader">To all outward appearances, Joshua is a healthy, normal
two-year-old. But his medical record may permanently brand
him as undesirable to insurers and employers.
   Joshua has been diagnosed as suffering from an inherited
disorder called polycystic kidney disease. But he's not
really suffering. The disease, which damages the kidneys,
usually doesn't cause health problems before adulthood and
may progress slowly even then.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yet when Joshua's father recently changed jobs, the new
employer's health insurer wouldn't cover the child because of
his predisposition to the disease. "We finally got health
insurance for Josh" with a different insurer, says his
mother, "but we didn't tell the company about his disease."</p>
<p>Joshua's case illustrates an issue usually raised only by
experts gazing darkly into crystal balls and foreseeing the
classification of people by their genes. A number of similar
cases have surfaced, suggesting that the issue already is
hitting home. Besides grappling with insurance problems,
people known to have disease-associated genes reportedly have
been denied jobs and the chance to adopt children.</p>
<p>Such anecdotal reports -- circulated among genetics
experts recently -- aren't "hard evidence" that genetic
discrimination is occurring, cautions Philip Reilly, head of
Boston's Shriver Center for Mental Retardation. "But concern
is appropriate. . . . The reports may be very early warning
signs" of discrimination, which "could be a big problem 10
years from now, when we might have 100 tests for genetic
diseases." Such tests could put millions of people into
high-risk disease categories, branding them for insurance and
employment purposes in much the same way those diagnosed with
AIDS infections are often marked.</p>
<p>Health and life insurance companies typically require
access to the medical records of people seeking coverage and
ask about pre-existing medical conditions; people who don't
disclose such conditions risk losing their insurance.</p>
<p>Research advances of the past decade already have vastly
amplified doctors' ability to diagnose and sometimes palliate
disorders caused by faulty genes. But cures generally remain
years or decades away. Meanwhile, insurers and employers --
squeezed by soaring health-care costs -- are trying harder to
minimize financial risks posed by chronic, costly diseases.
Improved tests for genetic diseases give them new, powerful
tools for limiting their exposure to those risks.</p>
<p>"If an individual had undergone genetic tests and had
information about them, an insurer would want to know" when
making coverage decisions about the person, says Jude Payne,
a senior policy analyst for the Health Insurance Association
of America, a trade group. "While some people might consider
that discrimination, the insurance industry would consider it
standard policy."</p>
<p>But testing for a genetic disease typically gives a
prediction of illness that says little about the course of
the disease and the costs it might entail. The age of onset
and the severity of gene-associated diseases vary widely due
to patients' differing life styles, treatments and
little-understood effects of the "expression" of genes. It's
"cockeyed" to base insurance or employment decisions on such
hazy predictions, argues Paul Billings, who directs genetics
at Pacific Presbyterian Medical Center in San Francisco.</p>
<p>That, however, is just what a number of insurers and other
organizations are starting to do, according to a survey of
geneticists and other medical professionals that Mr. Billings
recently conducted with three other researchers. Among 29
cases of "genetic discrimination" reported to them were ones
in which:</p>
<p>-- A patient diagnosed as carrying a gene for Gaucher's
disease was denied a government job because of the diagnosis
despite the fact that the patient wasn't expected to get
sick. The disease, which causes liver enlargement and other
problems, occurs only in people whose cells each have two
copies of its "recessive" gene -- one from each parent.</p>
<p>-- A pregnant woman whose fetus was diagnosed with cystic
fibrosis was told by her health maintenance organization that
it wouldn't cover the child's medical expenses. The HMO later
reversed the decision after the woman complained.</p>
<p>-- A couple's application to adopt a child was denied
because one spouse had a family history of Huntington's
disease and was at risk for the inherited disorder, a fatal
disease that causes progressive mental degeneration.</p>
<p>Insurers question the validity of such anonymous
anecdotes, which may omit or distort crucial facts. And even
if genetic discrimination sometimes occurs, anecdotal reports
say nothing about its prevalence. "I really disagree . . .
that there is rampant discrimination," says Robert Pokorski,
chairman of the American Council of Life Insurance's genetic
testing committee. "Insurance companies can't make money by
denying risk."</p>
<p>Moreover, in a preliminary study at Johns Hopkins
University, researchers found that people with
neurofibromatosis, a genetic disease that can cause
disfigurement, "lacked insurance at about the same rate as
the general population," says Reed Pyeritz, who led the
study.</p>
<p>Still, many medical experts worry that rapidly
proliferating genetic tests are cracking open a Pandora's
box. More than 4,000 genetic disorders have been identified,
and tests for dozens of them are now possible. (For economic
and other reasons, many potential tests aren't yet practical
for wide use.)</p>
<p>The dizzying pace of genetic findings is expected to
accelerate further as the $3 billion federal Human Genome
Project, which is aimed at identifying all 100,000 or so
human genes, takes off in the coming year. Among other
things, the 15-year project promises to elucidate genes that
contribute to major scourges such as heart disease, cancer
and Alzheimer's disease. "The insurance issues raised by
genetic screening are about to grow phenomenally," says Harry
Ostrer, a geneticist at the University of Florida.</p>
<p>Currently, all 50 states require screening of newborns for
certain diseases, including genetic ones. And optional
prenatal testing for genetic disorders is surging.</p>
<p>Last year Kim Roembach-Ratliff of Prairie Village, Kan.,
had prenatal tests that showed her son would be born with
spina bifida, a crippling disorder associated with faulty
genes in which part of the spinal column is exposed. About
the same time, her husband applied for health coverage under
his new employer's insurer.</p>
<p>"When we called the agent {for the new insurer}," she
says, "he told me, `I'm sorry, we can't extend insurance to
you'" because of her child's expected health problems. Those
problems have turned out to be relatively minor, she adds,
and her six-month-old son probably will be able to walk with
leg braces. Meanwhile, the couple has been able to get an
18-month extension of coverage under the previous employer's
health insurance program.</p>
<p>In Columbia, Mo., Mark Gibson, a manager with American
Fidelity Assurance who handled the couple's application, says
it was denied because the spina bifida diagnosis represented
a "pre-existing" medical condition not coverable under the
company's rules.</p>
<p>Most tests for genetic diseases are now done prenatally or
at birth. But there may soon be more testing of adults,
partly because of a trend toward self-insurance among
employers. (Self-insured companies directly fund their
employee's health plans.) Such employers "have a strong
incentive to find out about employees' health risks,"
including genetic diseases, says Deborah Stone, a Brandeis
University professor of law and social policy.</p>
<p>Few, if any, employers are believed to be testing workers
for genetic diseases. But a federal study indicated that more
than half of employers medically screen job applicants, and
many companies request access to medical records that may
contain the results of genetic tests.</p>
<p>Fearful of being denied insurance or other things, some
people who suspect they carry disease-associated genes --
perhaps because of family histories of a disease -- decline
to use new tests that could put black marks on their medical
records. "We get about a call a day from people asking about
getting tested for Huntington's disease," says Richard Myers,
who directs a testing program for the disease at Boston's
Massachusetts General Hospital. "But we only do about three
or four tests a year." One reason is that a Huntington's test
can cost $3,000 to $4,000. But "the greatest deterrent to
getting tested," he adds, "is that it makes people feel more
vulnerable to losing whatever protection they now have" via
jobs or insurance.</p>
<p>Currently, "the legal protections against genetic
discrimination are quite fuzzy," says Brandeis's Ms. Stone.
It's unclear, for example, whether laws barring
discrimination by employers and insurers against people with
disabilities apply to people with genetic diseases.</p>
<p>Laws to protect people with medical problems don't always
work, anyway. "AIDS testing by employers is illegal
everywhere, but it's still done by some companies," says Mark
Rothstein, a University of Houston authority on medical
screening.</p>
<p>Some states have set up "high-risk" pools for insuring
people who can't get commercial health insurance, typically
funded in part by insurers. But the pools probably would be
overwhelmed by the number of risky cases potentially
identifiable through genetic testing. "Ultimately," says the
Shriver Center's Dr. Reilly, "the best solution to the
problem may be some sort of national health insurance."</p>
