	<p class="article-leader">BUSH IS FOCUSING on agricultural issues at the economic
summit in Houston.
   The president will urge leaders of the major Western
nations -- especially the European Community -- to commit
themselves to certain changes in agriculture in order to
guarantee success in the current round of global
trade-liberalization talks, U.S. officials said. Bush's
comments will ensure a contentious opening day at the
three-day summit. The U.S., a major agricultural exporter,
favors sharp cuts and the eventual elimination of farm
subsidies, while the EC has argued that it can't do away with
the subsidies without damaging its social fabric.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The group isn't likely to agree on economic aid for the
Soviets. The U.S. believes the aid would be wasted without
certain preconditions -- such as a commitment to free-market
principles.</p>

<p>GORBACHEV TOLD farmers and workers to back him or find a
new leader.</p>
<p>The Soviet president, addressing a gathering of workers on
the eve of nominations for Communist Party leader, asked the
group, "Am I needed by you? You will decide." Delegates at a
party congress will vote on the nominations later this week,
and both hard-liners and moderates say Gorbachev appears
certain to weather the sharp criticism of his policies and be
re-elected general-secretary of the party. But the rest of
the ruling Politburo, which the congress also will elect,
could be completely overhauled, with a new generation of
conservatives rising to power.</p>
<p>A Soviet spokesman said Moscow's assistance to Cuba will
"fade away, but not tomorrow." The U.S. has said aid to the
Kremlin depends on such a move.</p>

<p>Louisiana's Legislature passed a bill that would send
doctors to prison for up to 10 years for doing abortions. The
bill, which also sets a $100,000 fine, would allow abortions,
however, in cases of rape or incest. The Senate earlier
yesterday had failed to override Gov. Roemer's veto of a
similar bill that didn't include the exceptions.</p>

<p>The U.S. and Canada agreed to begin negotiations on a
treaty to cut acid-rain emissions. Canadian leader Mulroney
and President Bush, both in Houston for the economic summit,
said the talks would start next week. Bush said he decided to
proceed with talks even though Congress has yet to pass a
Clean Air Act.</p>

<p>The U.N. secretary-general sent an envoy to Albania to try
to help solve the crisis in Tirana, the capital, where up to
6,000 dissidents have taken refuge in foreign embassies.
Perez de Cuellar, who is acting as an intermediary, said he
was hopeful some people would be allowed to leave Albania but
that "most should stay in their country."</p>

<p>Bulgarian student leaders demanded that more of the
country's ruling Socialist Party leaders step down after
public protests forced President Mladenov to resign. The
53-year-old leader, who ousted Communist hard-liner Zhivkov
in November, quit Friday because of charges that he requested
tanks to crush a December demonstration.</p>

<p>Greek and U.S. officials signed a defense treaty allowing
two major U.S. military bases to remain in Greece for at
least eight years. Washington sweetened the pact by providing
Athens with 62 warplanes and four naval destroyers. The U.S.
agreed to sharply reduce American military personnel in
Greece and to close two other bases.</p>

<p>Bush will permit U.S. commercial satellites to be launched
by Soviet rockets, according to Baker. But the secretary of
state said he didn't know when the first American satellite
would be carried by a Soviet rocket. Plans call for the
rocket to be launched from a base in northern Australia.</p>

<p>More than 22,000 youths die each year from injuries, with
homicides and suicides accounting for one-fifth of the
fatalities, according to a report produced for Congress by
the Centers for Disease Control. The study calls for schools,
local governments and families to put an increased emphasis
on injury prevention.</p>

<p>Nine white extremists were detained in connection with a
series of recent bombings aimed at anti-apartheid targets,
South Africa's minister of law and order said. He stated that
they hadn't yet been charged.</p>

<p>Two Kenyan lawyers were given refuge in the U.S. Embassy
in Nairobi, according to a newspaper owned by the ruling
party. The lawyers were described as leading opponents of the
country's one-party rule.</p>

<p>Stefan Edberg of Sweden won the Wimbledon men's singles
tennis title for the second time, defeating defending champ

Martina Navratilova of the U.S. captured a record ninth
women's Wimbledon title by winning her match against American
Zina Garrison in straight sets.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>West Germany won the World Cup soccer title for the third
time by beating Argentina, 1-0, in Rome. The West Germans had
lost to the Argentines in the 1986 final in Mexico.</p>
