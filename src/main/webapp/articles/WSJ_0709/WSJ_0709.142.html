	<p class="article-leader">CHANNELVIEW, Texas -- Investigators of a fiery Arco
Chemical Co. plant explosion that killed 17 workers here late
last week are trying to determine whether contract workers
were a factor, but the cause of the blast isn't yet known.
   The explosion is the latest in a recent rash of
petrochemical and oil refinery blasts that has prompted
closer scrutiny of plant operations by government, industry
and union officials and tougher enforcement of safety rules.
A Phillips Petroleum Co. explosion killed 23 workers in
October at a chemical plant about a dozen miles from here.
Hundreds of other workers have been injured or killed in the
past two years as such accidents seem to be on the rise
around the country.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We are concerned about what is happening in the
petrochemical industry," said Gerard Scannell, head of the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration, in an
interview. Mr. Scannell and OSHA investigators were on the
scene at Channelview within hours of the explosion.</p>
<p>Industry officials are searching for answers and many have
reviewed their safety practices. "We can't explain this
bunching {of accidents}," said Lodwrick Cook, chairman of
both the chemical company and Atlantic Richfield Co., the oil
giant that owns 83% of the chemical company. "It's
troubling."</p>
<p>"This situation is accelerating," said Joseph Misbrener,
president of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers union in
Denver. "It is definitely a crisis." The union has been
distributing a videotape narrated by Ralph Nader called "Out
of Control" on the industry's problems.</p>
<p>The Arco blast occurred at a waste-water treatment tank
where maintenance workers were about to fix a compressor,
said Arco officials, who wouldn't speculate on the cause of
the accident until the company and federal authorities
complete their separate investigations.</p>
<p>The eruption and ensuing blaze that began around 11:30
Thursday night destroyed an area about the size of a city
block at the plant. Tremors from the blast were felt for
miles. It took firefighters four hours to put out the fire at
the facility here, about 20 miles east of Houston.</p>
<p>OSHA and industry critics have been focusing on the
increased reliance of contract workers in chemical plants and
refineries who, they say, often don't get the same training
as company workers. Mr. Scannell said OSHA commissioned a
study, due by the end of summer, to see if there's a
correlation between the use of contract workers and safety
problems.</p>
<p>Of the 17 who died here, five were Arco employees, 11 were
contract employees working for Austin Industrial Inc. and one
was a truck driver, Arco said. The plant employs about 350
Arco workers and 80 contract workers full time.</p>
<p>Arco officials said the contract workers they use receive
the same training as Arco employees. "We treat the contract
employees, who are routinely part of our work force and part
of our plant, as we do our own employees," said Jack Johnson,
senior vice president. Austin Industrial officials couldn't
be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Union officials maintain that companies use contract
workers because they receive lower wages and benefits than
full-time company employees. While acknowledging that
contract workers are less expensive, Arco officials insisted
the plant uses them to maintain flexibility, not to cut
costs.</p>
<p>Past accident investigations have also focused on a lack
of preventive maintenance, excessive overtime, inadequate
safety practices and the running of equipment at or above
capacity.</p>
<p>OSHA has stepped up penalties against companies it
believes made willful and flagrant violations. The agency
levied a $5.7 million fine against Phillips, which the
company is contesting. In the past, OSHA penalties involving
worker deaths often totaled in the hundreds of dollars.</p>
<p>Arco officials said it could take several months for the
entire plant to restart but that some portions could be
brought on line much sooner. The plant makes a much-in-demand
gasoline additive, methyl tertiary butyl ether, which has
received a big environmental push because it reduces gasoline
evaporation. Arco officials said production could resume
within a few weeks, which analysts said shouldn't affect the
market.</p>
<p>The plant also makes propylene oxide, used to make foam in
seat cushions and mattresses, and styrene monomer, used as a
food-packaging material. An extended shutdown could boost
prices of these chemicals, analysts said.</p>
