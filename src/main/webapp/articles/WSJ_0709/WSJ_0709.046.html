	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Lord, Geller, Federico, Einstein, the
beleaguered WPP Group PLC ad agency that never fully
recovered from the defection of its top executives two years
ago, is being merged into another WPP unit.
   London-based WPP late Friday said LGFE would be folded
into its Brouillard Communications unit, which would be
renamed Brouillard/LGFE.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The merger that marks the end of the LGFE agency caps a
tumultuous couple of years there. The agency, once known as a
creative hot shop that dreamed up the Charlie Chaplin-like
"Little Tramp" ads for International Business Machines Corp.,
had billed an estimated $220 million in 1987. But after its
six top executives walked out in a bitter fight with Martin
Sorrell, WPP's chief executive, the agency went into a
tailspin from which it never fully emerged.</p>
<p>The latest blow came last week, when Schieffelin &
Somerset Co., perhaps its largest client, pulled its $7
million Hennessey cognac account from the shop.</p>
<p>As of Friday, LGFE had shrunk to $43 million in billings,
WPP said. New York-based Brouillard, an agency specializing
in corporate-image programs that was once a smaller sibling
to LGFE, bills about $70 million, putting the combined shops'
billings at an estimated $110 million.</p>
<p>"The loss of Schieffelin & Somerset brought LGFE below the
critical mass that we thought was necessary to justify a
separate agency," a WPP spokesman said.</p>
<p>The merger also puts Brouillard executives in day-to-day
control of operations. James H. Foster, president and chief
executive officer of Brouillard, will retain that post in the
merged company. Agi Clark, who had been LGFE's chief creative
officer, will be chairman. The management lineup throws into
question the futures of LGFE's top executives, Tim Elliott,
who had been chief executive officer, and J. William Wardell,
who was president.</p>
<p>The WPP spokesman would say only that both of those
executives are "committed to make sure there is a smooth
transition of LGFE clients to the merged agency." The roles
of Norman Geller and Gene Federico, both board members who
aren't involved in day-to-day operations, aren't likely to
change, the spokesman added.</p>
<p>Executives at a number of LGFE's clients couldn't be
reached, and it's not clear whether all will follow to the
merged shop. Remaining clients include Prince Manufacturing
Inc., Sheridan Distributors Inc. and Chemical Bank.</p>
<p>The LGFE defectors formed their own agency, Lord Einstein
O'Neill & Partners, in March 1988. That shop, after a strong
start, had some big setbacks, including the loss of its
largest account, Saab-Scania AB, earlier this year. However,
the agency recently won an assignment from American Telephone
& Telegraph and several brands from Perrier Group of America
Inc.</p>
