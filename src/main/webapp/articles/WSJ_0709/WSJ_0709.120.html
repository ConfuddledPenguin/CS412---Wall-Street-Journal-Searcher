   Of Soda-Bottle Plastic</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>UNCLE SAM may open up plastic beverage bottles for
recycling.</p>
<p>Kenneth Falci, a consumer safety officer and recycling
expert with the Food and Drug Administration, says the agency
is leaning toward permitting soft drink bottles and water
jugs to be made from recycled polyethylene terephthalate
(PET) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE), respectively.
Each currently is made from the virgin material.</p>
<p>A ruling is still several months away, says Mr. Falci, and
will depend in part on whether the agency is convinced there
is a consistent supply of uncontaminated recycled plastic
available. "It can probably be done successfully," he says.</p>
<p>Others aren't so sure. Dennis Sabourin, vice president of
Wellman Inc., the largest U.S. plastics recycler, says
there's an acute lack of plastic collection and sorting
facilities. Wellman, he says, could use twice as many bottles
as it can buy for the fiber products it makes. Moreover, he
says, recycled bottles could cost much more to make than
virgin bottles because it's necessary to break the bottle
down into its base chemicals, then go through a costly
repolymerization.</p>
<p>Still, a spokesman for PepsiCo Inc. says the company is
working with its packaging suppliers on a recycled-PET pop
bottle, and hopes to have one ready within 12 to 24 months.
Coca-Cola Co. didn't return repeated phone calls.</p>
<p>Power-Line Radiation
</p>
<p>DOES POWER-LINE radiation cause cancer? The debate spreads
to the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
<p>The controversy over powerline radiation has been building
for a couple of years, spurred by a spate of inconclusive but
suggestive new epidemiological and animal studies. Unwilling
to wait for definitive proof, some communities and
individuals have sued their local electric utilities to stop
construction of overhead lines.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, EPA analysts recommended that the
agency classify power-line radiation a "probable" human
carcinogen. They were overruled, however, by the EPA's
director of Health and Environmental Assessment, William
Farland, who decided there isn't yet enough evidence to
justify such a warning. The analysts' recommendation was then
leaked to Microwave News, a New York newsletter.</p>
<p>An EPA spokeswoman calls the disagreement "an interoffice
squabble." She says Mr. Farland "chose very wisely," adding
that, "it can serve no purpose . . . to jump out there {with
a warning} right now."</p>
<p>In their written recommendation, the analysts acknowledged
there is only limited evidence linking power-line radiation
to cancer. They also acknowledged that nobody yet understands
the interaction between power-line radiation and human cells.</p>
<p>The deleted recommendation was part of an EPA report that
reviewed the scientific literature on low-level radiation's
health effects. That report, minus the recommendation, is to
undergo scientific peer review, the spokeswoman says, adding
that the reviewers could decide that there's enough evidence
to warrant reinstating the analysts' warning.</p>
<p>Landfill in New York</p>
<p>Dumps Its Higher Prices</p>
<p>NEW YORK CITY wants its garbage back.</p>
<p>In December 1988 the Big Apple more than doubled the fee
at its huge Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island. Haulers
balked, diverting 25% to 30% of the landfill's intake -- a
monstrous 10,000 tons of trash a day -- to less expensive
landfills in Ohio, Pennsylvania and other states.</p>
<p>The diversion inflamed a border war originally touched off
by New Jersey's policy to ship vast amounts of its garbage to
other states. Last month, Indiana Sen. Dan Coats tried to
attach an amendment to a chemical-weapons bill that would
have let states ban or otherwise impede the flow of
out-of-state garbage. (It was killed by a cloture vote.)</p>
<p>With New York buried under a fiscal crisis, a spokesman
for the city's sanitation department says the department has
proposed rolling back the Fresh Kills dumping fee, to $25 a
cubic yard from $40 for garbage from which recyclables have
been removed. Though that's still higher than the $18.50
haulers were paying before the fee increase, sanitation
officials hope they can woo back 3,500 tons, enough coffee
grinds and chicken bones to raise an extra $20 million a year
in revenue.</p>
<p>Whether or not the plan works, however, it isn't going to
douse the border war. An aide to Sen. Coats says, "States
should have the ability to control their overall destiny."
Will the amendment be reintroduced? "We live to fight another
day," says the aide.</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>SOUTHWALL Technologies Inc. of Palo Alto, Calif., claims
its "Superglass" window glass insulates as well as wooden
walls. The glass consists of two panes, lined with two
polyester films pulled tight. Each film has a metallic
coating that reflects the heat in or out, depending on the
time of year. The pockets between the panes and the films are
filled with argon and other insulating gases. . . . Next
summer's mulch could come from this winter's Christmas trees.
Residents of Kingsport, Tenn., with an assist from Waste
Management Inc., collect Christmas trees and grind them into
mulch, which is then spread on city property. The program won
an award last year from Keep America Beautiful, a nonprofit
group, which says other communities have copied the idea. . .

voice social consciousness, uses recycled-paper packaging for
its latest album.</p>
