	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Program trading accounted for an average of
10.9% of New York Stock Exchange volume, or 15.6 million
shares daily, in the week ended June 22, the exchange said.
   This was down from an unusually large 22.3% of volume the
previous week, which included program trading associated with
the quarterly expiration on June 15 of stock-index futures
and options.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Big Board's latest weekly data on program trading
showed that the biggest program traders in the week ended
June 22, accounting for about 70% of all program activity,
were Morgan Stanley Group Inc., the Kidder, Peabody & Co.
unit of General Electric Co., Susquehanna Investment Group,
the First Boston Corp. unit of CS First Boston Inc., and
Merrill Lynch & Co.</p>
<p>Program trading is the simultaneous, rapid-fire purchase
or sale of 15 or more, and often hundreds, of stocks. The
most common form is stock-index arbitrage, in which stocks
are bought and sold with offsetting trades of futures and
options. The Big Board said that of the five most active
program-trading firms, only Merrill Lynch's program trading
didn't involve index arbitrage.</p>
