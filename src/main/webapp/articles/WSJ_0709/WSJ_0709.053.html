	<p class="article-leader">London -- In a time of world upheaval -- even when what is
being heaved up looks pretty good -- it's reassuring that
Wimbledon, bless 'er, remains an anchor of stability. The
world capital of turf tennis last weekend crowned two singles
champions whose names have become familiar to people who
don't know a volley from a trolley.
   The men's winner, on an untypically British sunny Sunday,
was lanky Stefan Edberg of Sweden, who has been in three
consecutive finals here and won two of them. As in the
others, his last-day foe was the German redhead Boris Becker,
a three-time Wimbledon winner. They've already become to
grass-court tennis what Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran are to
boxing, and because they're both young (Stefan is 24, Boris
22) could easily wind up the better-known pair.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The women's champ, crowned on Saturday, was 33-year-old
Martina Navratilova, an even-more-familiar face and forehand.
Her straight-sets victory over Zina Garrison gave her a ninth
silver plate here, a 52-year record. The previous mark was
held by Miss H.N. Wills and Mrs. F.S. Moody, which is to say
Helen Wills Moody. Martina's mark also gets a hyphen of
sorts, because she's won Wimbledon both as a Czech and, since
1981, an American. (But no, she assured one midweek
questioner, she wasn't going to move back home to Prague
however democratic it has become.)</p>
<p>From a competitive standpoint the men's bout was the
better event, going the full, five-set distance. Edberg,
serve-and-volleying beautifully, took the first two sets,
both 6-2, and Becker, doing the same things more
purposefully, if not more artistically, took the next two,
both 6-3.</p>
<p>The pair played "after you" for a while in the last set,
when two Edberg doublefaults led to a Becker service break
and 3-1 game lead, only to have Becker reciprocate by missing
two easy-looking volleys to lose his serve in the next game.
Edberg smacked a couple of backhand service-return winners to
break again in game nine, and made it game, set, match and
championship, 6-4, in the next when Becker clunked a service
return wide off his racket frame.</p>
<p>Becker attributed his fatal slow start to tiredness,
traceable to his previous six matches. Especially draining,
he said, was his four-set, two-tiebreaker semi on Friday
against Goran Ivanesvic, an 18-year-old Yugoslav who serves
as hard as a 17-year-old Becker said he once knew; namely,
himself as 1985 Wimbledon champ. Ivanesvic is one of those
grass-court naturals who might prevent a future Edberg-Becker
rematch or two here.</p>
<p>The same cannot be said for No. 1 ranked and top-seeded
Ivan Lendl. His three-month drive to win the only Grand Slam
title that has eluded him ended Friday at Edberg's hands.
It's true Stefan played near-perfect tennis, but it's
probably also true that Ivan lacks the grass knack.</p>
<p>Edberg said he found that win bracing instead of tiring,
and an aid to his Sunday win. Another help, he said, was the
memory of his loss to Becker in this event last year after
beating him in 1988. "Once you have won here, it is never
good to come in second," said the fella who's also won two
Australian Opens. In other words, winning is better than
losing.</p>
<p>The biggest news on the ladies' side wasn't Martina's win,
but that her finals' opponent was Garrison. The 26-year-old
former public-courts player from Houston had been a
decade-long tennis tourist, but while she had considerable
cash to show for her travels (about $2.5 million in prizes)
she'd always come up semishort in Grand Slam events, as in
semifinals. She'd been in three of those but never made a
final round, a circumstance she attributed both to her stars
and herself.</p>
<p>"I've never had that little, bitty breakthrough," she said
at midweek, later adding, "Maybe it was because I wanted to
win so bad I'd tighten up."</p>
<p>In two memorable three-setters, though, Garrison shed her
loser's label and added her name to the short-but-growing
list of players who are, at long last, making Slam womens'
sides more than the one-gal show they were in 1988 and '89,
when Steffi Graf gobbled up seven of the eight. Garrison's
breakthrough wins were quarterfinal victory over Yugoslavia's
Monica Seles, the 16-year-old French Open winner, and her
semifinal triumph over Graf.</p>
<p>The Seles match was the more dramatic, if only because
Garrison lost the first set and faced a match point at 6-7 in
the third. But she fought that off with a ferocious,
down-the-line forehand winner and never looked back, taking
the set, 9-7.</p>
<p>Match point in Garrison's victory over Graf was equally
decisive, coming on a service ace. As in the Seles bout,
Garrison rushed the net effectively, overcoming her foe's
base-line power. Graf, who lost only two singles matches all
last year, now has failed to win her last three tournaments.
"Fraulein Forehand" has excuses, including a nagging sinus
condition and a tabloid feast over allegations that her
father has fathered a child with a young woman not his wife.
But it just could be that the rest of the pack has gained a
step on her.</p>
<p>The final, though, was all Martina, as were all her
matches here. She skimmed through the draw without losing a
set, which meant that her oft-times shaky composure never was
tested. Against Garrison, whom she'd beaten 27 of 28 times
going in, she banged home 75% of her first serves, won the
race to the net, and forced numerous errors, mostly from
Garrison's backhand. The score was 6-4, 6-1, and the match's
last six games were hers. "She was a step ahead of me every
time," said Garrison.</p>
<p>Martina said that she played better in this tourney than
she ever had, and that her three-year Slam-title drought made
her victory all the sweeter. "This one tops it all," said
she.</p>
<p>Garrison said that, after the match, Navratilova told her
this would be her last Wimbledon, but that was perhaps
wishful thinking, because Martina herself later said it
wasn't so. "I said I thought she would win, and that I
probably wouldn't be here when she did. But I meant six or
seven years from now, not next year," the champ smiled.</p>
