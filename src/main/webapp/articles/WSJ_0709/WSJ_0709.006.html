	<p class="article-leader">WE'VE ALL SEEN the photos. The unshaven mountaineer with
the opaque sunglasses and the impossibly white teeth is
holding his country's flag aloft while he strikes a
conquering pose atop some Himalayan peak. In his other hand
he holds an ice ax. That's all.
   He didn't sprint up five vertical miles of frozen mountain
with only an ice ax. What we don't see are the faceless,
plodding porters who have lugged tons of tents, oxygen
bottles, radios, cameras, toilet paper and freeze-dried
chicken Florentine from the flatlands almost (but not quite)
to the top, just so this heroic picture could be taken. They
are sherpas, and most people can't climb the Himalayas
without them.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Heads of state can't climb summits without them either.</p>
<p>All the nations at the Houston summit have sherpas. Their
more prosaic designation is "personal representative," and
each government, plus the European Community, has had one or
two of them fetching and carrying for the past seven months
just so their bosses can look informed and masterful during
two days in Houston.</p>
<p>Few outside their circle know who they are, which is fine
with the sherpas. Their First Law: cultivate anonymity.
"Sherpas are invisible," declares one of them -- insisting on
anonymity even for this.</p>
<p>But much of the really important summit work -- the
selection and shaping of issues -- is done by the sherpas.
They work long hours, shuttling from meetings with their
counterparts to briefings with the heads of government they
serve. "I've always believed that the {summit} event itself
was incidental," says Sylvia Ostry, a former sherpa for
Canada. She has a point, for it is during the preparation,
rather than during the summit itself, that governments find
out what their allies are really thinking.</p>
<p>The idea is to avoid nasty surprises, insofar as they can
be avoided. That's not always possible. Sherpas can't
anticipate "X-factors" -- terrorist acts, the Tiananmen
Square massacre, or sudden shakeups in a government -- that
erupt at the last minute and beg for some response from the
summit.</p>
<p>But most issues can be anticipated and shaped. "The sherpa
tees the ball up," says a veteran U.S. sherpa from summits of
the 1970s. "How well it's teed up can determine how well the
heads of state can hit it."</p>
<p>A good sherpa keeps the boss from appearing isolated,
silly or uninformed. Collectively, the sherpas succeed if at
the summit all the leaders have the chance to look sensible,
statesmanlike, and, if possible, even visionary.</p>
<p>But never at one another's expense. The sherpas strive to
avoid framing issues in such a way that one or more summit
participants might be embarrassed by the outcome. They are
fearful of what a Bush adminstration official calls "the
political nuclear weapon" -- a summit that ends in an open
fracas or one at which a particular government's policies are
criticized in the final communique.</p>
<p>At the same time, they must also avoid turning everything
into an agreeable mush; certain kinds of controversy are
dangerous, but a total lack of controversy, of push and tug
between the powers, is worse. A summit that produces nothing
but bland platitudes is not only an empty exercise but also
lousy theater.</p>
<p>The needed preparatory work is extensive, and the Houston
summit, in effect, actually began last January with the
initial sherpa meeting in Key West, Fla. Since then, the
sherpas have talked in San Francisco, Paris, Washington,
Newport, R.I., and finally Houston. As the summit date drew
closer, the early phase -- a dispassionate sifting of issues
to select those for the summit agenda -- gave way to
cajoling, wheedling and hard questioning.</p>
<p>All the while the ground was shifting under the sherpas'
feet in a way unknown at previous summits; the world kept
rearranging itself while they talked. "This year," says one,
"it became obvious that there is greater uncertainty, and
higher historical stakes."</p>
<p>Eastern Europe was in ferment. One summit partner, West
Germany, moved toward unification with East Germany --
raising all sorts of financial and political uncertainties
for the other six summit participants. And the Soviet Union,
a prominent though uninvited presence at all summits, was
changing practically from one sherpa meeting to the next.</p>
<p>By the time they convened in Paris in May, the sherpas
were gnawing their fingernails over the Soviet problem; the
Great Thaw in the East Bloc, they felt, wasn't playing out
all that constructively in the U.S.S.R. There, reform seemed
chiefly to have blown open a Pandora's box full of ethnic
hatreds and economic chaos. Moscow no longer threatened the
free world with military domination but with its own economic
disintegration.</p>
<p>During last year's summit, Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev sent a surprise missive reminding the leaders that
his country also was a part of the world order and that he
wanted greater economic interraction with capitalist
economies. Given what has happened since, said one sherpa
after meeting with his colleagues in Paris, "This year he may
knock on the door."</p>
<p>Whether he does or not, the capitalist leaders will have
to address the economic plight of the Soviets and what they
might do to help out. Says one European sherpa: "This is
delicate because the Soviet Union is a superpower. But the
West should be prepared for a situation where maybe we hear a
cry for help. We haven't yet found answers."</p>
<p>The sherpas spent most of one meeting grilling Horst
Koehler, sherpa to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The
two Germanys were poised to push through economic and
monetary unification a week before the Houston summit, and
Germany's summit partners wanted assurances about its likely
effects.</p>
<p>Economists were edgy about West Germany exchanging its
marks for East German currency at a rate highly favorable to
the East Germans. Wouldn't this touch off a bout of
inflation, the sherpas asked, a virus that other economies
would catch? And if this happened and interest rates had to
be jacked up to quell inflation, wouldn't this stifle growth?</p>
<p>Not to worry, said Mr. Koehler, a skilled debater. The
German money supply would be expanded only in line with an
expansion of productive capacity, a limit that would help
keep inflation in check. Interest rates wouldn't have to be
raised, investment capital would tend to flow to the East,
and productivity there, now low, would quickly grow under the
nourishment of capital and West German industrial know-how.</p>
<p>Mr. Koehler managed to put most of the worries to rest. As
a result, it's likely that the summit communique will mention
German unification in positive terms, noting that the new
Germany will contribute significantly to economic growth
elsewhere.</p>
<p>In another development, the risk of a possible slam at the
U.S. -- open summit criticism of its budget deficit -- has
also been largely defused. After taking considerable heat
from its allies, the Bush administration convened a "budget
summit" with lawmakers to break the political deadlock over
how to shrink the deficit. Although the success of this step
is still much in question, the fact that it has been taken
has probably spared President Bush the embarrassment of being
criticized in his home state for the U.S. government's lake
of red ink.</p>
<p>Besides these issues, the sherpas have had to agonize over
a host of others, smoothing away sharp edges and dodging
potential stalemates where they could. They include the
environment (Germany, with strong backing from France, wants
specific commitments to cut carbon dioxide emissions thought
to cause global warming, but the U.S. doesn't) and sticky
trade issues, particularly those involving agricultural
subsidies that shield European farmers from competition.</p>
<p>The sherpas haven't been able to settle every difference
in advance; nobody expects that much, and every summit
outcome has its surprises for them as for everyone else.
Their best reward would simply be a harmonious summit at
which substantial initiatives are taken. Their next best
reward: important new jobs for some of them, jobs in the
spotlight instead of the shadows.</p>
<p>Many sherpas go on to top positions in government and
finance. They include Robert Hormats, a summit veteran of the
'70s who is now vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International;
Karl Otto Poehl, president of the West German Bundesbank; and
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. At
least one sherpa working this Houston summit, Jacques Attali
of France, already knows where his next paycheck will be
coming from. He will become the first president of the new
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.</p>
