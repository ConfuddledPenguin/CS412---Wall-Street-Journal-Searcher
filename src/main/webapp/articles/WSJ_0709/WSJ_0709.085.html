	<p class="article-leader">MADRID -- Spanish truck maker Empresa Nacional de
Autocamiones S.A., or Enasa, looks increasingly like it will
have to seek an alternative to plans for its linkup with MAN
AG and Daimler-Benz AG.
   Though Spanish officials insist that they still hope to go
ahead with the plan to sell 80% of Enasa to the two West
German companies, the likelihood that MAN will withdraw from
the plan appears to be increasing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The European Community Commission and the West German
cartel office have opposed the accord on the grounds that it
infringes competition rules.</p>
<p>MAN, meanwhile, appears to have decided that the
transaction is less attractive than it thought, because of
new business opportunities in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>If MAN does pull out, Spanish Industry Minister Claudio
Aranzadi said, Daimler will seek a new partner to join it in
taking over the Spanish truck maker.</p>
<p>For its part, Mr. Aranzadi said, the Spanish government
won't go ahead with plans to purchase 8% of MAN's shares.</p>
<p>Terms of the original agreement signed with the two West
German companies in December valued Enasa at 36 billion
pesetas ($356 million); MAN and Daimler were to take 60% and
20% of Enasa, respectively.</p>
<p>Since the agreement, however, the uncertainty surrounding
Enasa's future has caused its sales to fall, while MAN's
shares have risen sharply.</p>
