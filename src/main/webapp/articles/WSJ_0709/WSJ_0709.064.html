	<p class="article-leader">With Marlboro decals on toy cars, Marlboro billboards in
video racing games, and Marlboro logos scrawled across tiny
tots' T-shirts, Marlboro maker Philip Morris certainly looks
like it wants kids to smoke.
   Philip Morris has denied that it encourages children to
smoke, and today the mammoth cigarette company will try to
prove that: It plans to announce a crackdown on the
unauthorized use of its cigarette logos by children's toy and
game companies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In recent months, Philip Morris and other cigarette makers
have been criticized for standing by idly while their logos,
or close likenesses of them, pop up on video games, toy cars,
and candy. Philip Morris doesn't give permission for its
brand names to be used for kids' toys, but it hasn't actively
cracked down on many transgressors, either.</p>
<p>The crackdown, and the hoopla Philip Morris hopes to stir
with its announcement today, isn't about to appease the
company's critics, who are already attacking the move as
posturing.</p>
<p>They charge Philip Morris with hypocrisy for suddenly
"discovering" that children's products use the Marlboro
trademark without permission.</p>
<p>"If Philip Morris really wanted to stop {the kids'
products}, it could have" done so years ago, says Michael
Pertschuk of the Advocacy Group, a Washington anti-smoking
group. But since it hasn't bothered, "the assumption was that
Philip Morris pushed its cigarettes to kids. Whether or not
that's true, it's a cheap public relations shot for Philip
Morris to cross their hearts and swear they never intended to
do any such thing."</p>
<p>The critics take Philip Morris to task, too, for accusing
other companies of exposing its cigarette brands to kids --
when Philip Morris itself, intentionally or not, does
precisely that.</p>
<p>"It's a little bit absurd, when this is a company that
{pays} to put Marlboro logos where kids can see them," such
as in sports arenas and race tracks, says David Blum, whose
anti-smoking group, Doctors Ought to Care, has been one of
Philip Morris's loudest critics. "Are they going to go after
Shea Stadium and all the other places where they pay good
money to expose their logos to kids?"</p>
<p>Earlier this year, DOC asked the Federal Trade Commission
to investigate Philip Morris after it uncovered several video
games chock full of Marlboro logos. In one, Super Monaco GP,
dozens of Marlboro billboards, logos and signs appear on a
race track. Sega Enterprises, the San Jose, Calif., company
that created the video, says that following complaints from
Philip Morris, it is removing the logos, which it didn't have
permission to use.</p>
<p>Other cigarette companies have come under fire for
marketing programs that critics insist are aimed at kids. A
recent Winston Cup newsletter, published for fans of the
cigarette-sponsored car races, for example, included a "Kids'
Korner" with a contest offering a Winston Cup sweatshirt as a
prize. And an ad for free Camel T-shirts in Sports
Illustrated prompted some teens to call a toll-free number
and say they were older than the offer's limit of 21. After
the shirts arrived, so did coupons for free packs of
cigarettes. Both Winston and Camel are made by RJR Nabisco.</p>
<p>An RJR spokeswoman says that the cigarette company doesn't
market to kids, and that it "very vigorously" cracks down on
companies that use its logo illegally. She notes that the
company took legal steps against five different candy
cigarette makers between 1979 and 1981, and that "we aren't
aware of any others" using RJR logos or look-alikes.</p>
<p>Philip Morris executives declined to comment on their new
crackdown. But one executive close to the company says that
Philip Morris "hadn't aggressively sought out" firms that
helped themselves to its logos before.</p>
<p>Philip Morris is taking the offensive now, the executive
adds, because "it doesn't need this kind of scrutiny. The
next time somebody holds something up and says Philip Morris
encourages kids to smoke, it can say, `Time out -- that's not
the case.' "</p>

<p>Mullen Loses Smartfood</p>
<p>Frito-Lay pulled its estimated $10 million Smartfood
popcorn account from Mullen and awarded it to Levine,
Huntley, Schmidt & Beaver in New York.</p>
<p>Mullen, based in Wenham, Mass., lost the Smartfood
business after it created a commercial for another client,
Veryfine Products, that pitched Veryfine juice as an
alternative to sodas such as Pepsi and Coke. Frito-Lay is
owned by PepsiCo and executives there judged the account to
be a conflict, Mullen said.</p>
<p>Jim Mullen, the agency's president, said his shop will
retain the public relations assignment for Smartfood popcorn,
an account it has handled since 1986.</p>
<p>The account is a big win for Levine Huntley, whose
Frito-Lay roster has been growing. It creates ads for
Frito-Lay's Light snack line and also a new product,
Sunchips.</p>
