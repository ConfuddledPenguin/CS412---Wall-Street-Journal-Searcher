	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Bond investors are giving up hope that the
long-predicted bond market rally will soon materialize.
   Friday's employment report, coming on top of stronger than
expected auto sales data on Thursday, has convinced investors
that interest rates won't fall significantly and that the
Federal Reserve will probably keep credit policy on hold.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the bond market, that bodes an extended period of
trendless trading activity providing little room for
investors to profit.</p>
<p>"It's going to be a dreadfully slow summer," said Charles
Lieberman, director of financial-markets research at
Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp. If bond-market players
"had any sense they'd all go away on long vacations." Mr.
Lieberman said the only excitement could come on days when
there is news out of Washington regarding congressional
efforts to reduce the size of the budget deficit.</p>
<p>"If you want to make money in a hurry, the Treasury bond
market is not the place to be right now," said Sung Won Sohn,
senior vice president at Norwest Corp. "Rates aren't going
anywhere. This is what we call a hiatus and it might continue
through the summer."</p>
<p>Call it the bond-market blahs, and note that Messrs.
Lieberman and Sohn aren't the only ones infected. Up and down
Wall Street, money managers, traders and economists alike are
grumbling about what they expect will be a slow summer in the
bond market.</p>
<p>The Department of Labor's June employment report set the
mood. Although employment growth was sluggish in June, many
economists said the report overall wasn't weak enough to
prompt the Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy any time
soon.</p>
<p>The government said the unemployment rate declined to 5.2%
from 5.3%, while only 40,000 new non-farm jobs were created.
But perhaps more stunning was the huge upward revisions of
the May data, which were revised to show employment growth of
355,000 instead of the previous estimate of 164,000.</p>
<p>Shortly after the employment report was released, bond
prices plunged. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 1
1/8 point, a loss of about $11.25 for a bond with a $1,000
face amount. The issue's yield, which moves in the opposite
direction of its price, slid to 8.5%.</p>
<p>Though he expects the market to settle into a trading
range now that Friday's rout is over, Mr. Lieberman said the
market could see a few exciting days later this month if
Congress "comes up with a budget deal" before the summer
recess. Although Congress will return in September,
politicians will be off hitting the campaign trail in
October, not leaving much time for budget negotiations.</p>
<p>"That leaves a small window to achieve progress on the
budget package; during that small period of time the bond
market will be very vulnerable to information," said Mr.
Lieberman.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, money managers are busy restructuring their
portfolios.</p>
<p>Edward A. Treichel, investment strategist at Van Kampen
Merritt Inc., said that many institutional investors are
"shortening" their fixed-income portfolios in an effort to
match their holdings to the major bond-market indexes, such
as the Salomon Brothers Broad Investment Grade Index or the
Shearson Lehman Hutton T-Bond Index.</p>
<p>Shortening, which simply means that money managers are
buying shorter-term bonds and possibly selling longer-term
bonds, is a sign that portfolio managers are bearish or
neutral on the market.</p>
<p>Mr. Treichel said that prior to Friday, many money
managers had "lengthened" their fixed-income portfolios
relative to the indexes. Lengthening is a sign that investors
are bullish. Because long-term bonds are more volatile than
short-term bonds, lengthening a portfolio can boost
performance when the market is rising but it can also be a
drag on performance when the market is falling.</p>
<p>An example of this took place during Friday's market
decline, when the benchmark 30-year bond fell 1 1/8 points,
or $11.25 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. But two-year
notes fell only 1/4 point, or about $2.50 for a bond with a
$1,000 face amount.</p>
<p>When investment managers aren't sure about the direction
of rates, they often simply match their portfolios to the
major indexes, seeking to perform as well as the market. Some
of Friday's portfolio shuffling was meant to achieve this
end.</p>
<p>Michael M. Spencer, vice president at One Federal Asset
Management, Boston, was among the managers who were busy
going shorter on Friday.</p>
<p>"This is the third time this year that we thought the Fed
would ease and short-term rates would fall and it didn't
happen," said a disappointed Mr. Spencer, who manages only
high-grade bonds. He believes that to make money in the third
quarter will require investors to go for yield since he
doubts that the market will move strongly enough to provide
capital appreciation in the way of higher bond prices.</p>
<p>On Friday, Mr. Spencer sold two-year Treasurys and bought
high-quality commercial paper of companies such as General
Motors Corp. Yields on commercial paper, short-term IOUs that
in many cases mature in 30 days, are about the same as yields
on short-term Treasurys. But because they are held for such a
short period, investors incur very little interestrate risk.</p>
<p>"It's time to stop expecting short-term rates to fall and
just go back to collecting income" from interest payments,
said Mr. Spencer.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>Bond prices plunged Friday after the latest employment
data dashed hopes for an immediate easing of interest rates.</p>
<p>"It was a day of unfulfilled expectations," said F. Ward
McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research
Associates Inc.</p>
<p>The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond tumbled 1 1/8 point,
a decline of $11.25 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The
bellwether bond was quoted late at a price of 102 18/32 to
yield 8.5% compared with 103 22/32 to yield 8.40% on
Thursday. Shortterm rates jumped. The discount rate on
three-month Treasury bills, for example, rose 0.10 percentage
point on Friday to 7.76% for a bond-equivalent yield of 8.0%.</p>
<p>Most of the selling in the bond market occurred in the
first hour after the release of the jobs data. After that,
bond prices held steady.</p>
<p>In the corporate bond market, negative comments by a
securities analyst hurt the junk bonds of Quantum Chemical
Corp. Avi Nash at Goldman, Sachs & Co. was said to have cut
his second-quarter earnings estimate and recommended that
holders sell their Quantum stock, according to Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report. Officials at Goldman wouldn't
confirm the reports.</p>
<p>Quantum stock dived on the news, falling 8% or 1 1/4
points to 15 3/8 in volume more than triple the stock's daily
average.</p>
<p>The junk bonds fell in sympathy with the stock. The 12.5%
senior subordinated notes ended the day 87 1/2, down 1/2
point, while the company's 13% senior subordinated debentures
also slipped 1/2 on the day to 86.</p>
<p>Quantum's bonds have been under pressure in recent weeks
as a spate of analysts have reported gloomy earnings
forecasts for cyclical and recession-sensitive industries.</p>
<p>Most other junk bonds, which are high-yield, high-risk
corporate securities that have low credit ratings or no
credit ratings at all, barely budged Friday.</p>
<p>In the investment-grade market, bonds slipped 1/8 to 1/4
point in thin trading.</p>
<p>Tax-exempt municipal bonds outperformed the Treasury
market on Friday as they did for most of the week, buoyed by
talk out of Washington that taxes may be about to rise. Some
long-term municipal bonds fell just 1/8 point on Friday.</p>
