	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Bankers said they have deluged RJR Nabisco
Inc. with $7 billion of loan commitments for its debt
refinancing plan, more than triple what the tobacco and food
company needs.
   The banks' rush before a deadline of last Friday suggests
that big money is once again becoming available for
leveraged-company transactions, after a yearlong halt.
Citibank's head of leveraged lending, Todd Slotkin, predicted
that the RJR loan would help "bring back confidence" in bank
lending to heavily indebted companies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>RJR is seeking to retire more than $4 billion of
high-yield junk bonds whose interest rates must be reset by
April. Those bonds had been seen as potentially ruinous to
RJR because their rate must be reset so that the bonds trade
at face value. The bonds had sunk as low as 58 cents on the
dollar last winter, raising the specter that RJR might have
been forced to reset their interest rate at 20% or higher.</p>
<p>In its refinancing package, RJR plans to use $2.25 billion
of fresh bank loans to help buy back bonds. Other money for
the refinancing will come from an equity infusion by Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts & Co., new preferred stock and existing
bank-credit facilities. In total, bankers calculated, only
about 32% of the $7 billion that banks pledged to RJR will
actually be borrowed. The remaining loan commitments will go
unused.</p>
<p>As recently as three weeks ago, bankers said they didn't
know how much difficulty RJR and KKR, the company's major
shareholder, would face in borrowing money from the banks.
"This loan really snowballed," said a Japanese banker who
worked on the RJR refinancing.</p>
<p>Several bankers said they were attracted to the RJR loan
by the big fees involved, as well as a belief that the
refinancing package will improve RJR's creditworthiness. RJR
last month agreed to pay fees as large as 4%, some of the
most lucrative bank fees on record, after protracted
negotiations with the banks.</p>
<p>The banks' rush into the loan the past two weeks may cause
some chagrin for RJR's chief financial officer, Karl von der
Heyden, and KKR. The two companies declined to comment. It's
understood, however, that KKR and Mr. von der Heyden
grudgingly accepted the high fees this spring on the belief
that banks wouldn't lend otherwise.</p>
<p>Still, bankers insisted they weren't bluffing KKR and RJR
during the fee negotiations or trying to make up for
practices during the great debt boom of the 1980s, when banks
put up much of the money but got little of the profit.
Instead, bankers said the high fees were needed to get banks
to relax the leveraged-lending limits they had imposed on
themselves in the past year.</p>
<p>"Getting this thing moving was a lot like breaking the ice
on a frozen river," said a veteran leveraged-company lender.
"You need something drastic to break the ice. Once you do
that, the river flows along quite nicely."</p>
<p>Bankers said the RJR loan will be made by nearly 30 banks,
led by seven agent banks that have each pledged $350 million.
The agents are: Security Pacific Corp., Fuji Bank, Long-Term
Credit Bank, Chase Manhattan Corp., Citicorp's Citibank,
Bankers Trust New York Corp. and Manufacturers Hanover Corp.
Formal loan documents are expected to be signed in the next
week.</p>
