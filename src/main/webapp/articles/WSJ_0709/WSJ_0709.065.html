	<p class="article-leader">The tumult over at the National Endowment for the Arts
reached a mini-climax of sorts, when the Endowment finally
rejected funding for four theater artists, whose creative
endeavors have been causing a stir in recent weeks.
   One of those refused grants was Karen Finley, known for
solo theater performances in which she smears chocolate and
bean sprouts over her mostly nude body. Another, no less
distinguished expression of her past artistry has involved
the use of vegetables, which Miss Finley inserts into her
body. In recommending Miss Finley for an NEA grant, the panel
described her work as "courageous and candid" social
criticism.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The NEA also rejected funding for John Fleck, an
underground artist of sorts, who had been recommended for an
NEA grant by an enthusiastic peer panel. Mr. Fleck's onstage
specialty includes urinating into a toilet bowl made up like
a shrine, and bedecked with a picture of Jesus Christ. In an
interview, Mr. Fleck told us that since he considered his
body sacred, what came out of his body was therefore also
sacred. Mr. Fleck also explains that his performances express
a political and social vision. The same is true of Miss
Finley who has explained that she is "being punished because
I am a morally concerned artist." Holly Hughes and Tim
Miller, whose artistic endeavors run along similar lines,
also were rejected for funding.</p>
<p>It is self-evident to most people that the government is
under no obligation to finance art -- regardless of merit --
simply because that art represents a particular political,
social or sexual viewpoint. This simple fact has apparently
eluded vocal "arts" supporters and pundits across the nation,
who have divined an act of censorship in the rejection of the
four grants. Thus the NEA's decision has raised the usual
cries of alarm, and the usual suggestions that the dark night
of fascism is about to descend on the United States -- that
is, if it had not already done so.</p>
<p>A panel of academics and others involved in theater arts
at once issued a statement expressing their "alarm" and
warning that the rejections would create "a climate of fear
for artists and audiences throughout America." Most
Americans, we suspect, will recognize these forebodings as
blather of a familiar sort.</p>
<p>Those sounding these warnings appear to be confused about
some elementary matters. Apparently they believe -- or they
want the citizenry to believe -- that the right of free
expression is somehow at issue in the decision to refuse a
grant. But the refusal of a grant, of course, has nothing to
do with the curtailment of free expression, or First
Amendment rights. Those who keep insisting it does should at
least bear in mind that the argument can cut both ways.
Americans who look at a work offered as art, and who decide,
on the basis of their tastes, discrimination and view of
community standards, that it is a piece of garbage not worth
funding, also are entitled to the right of free expression.</p>
<p>A considerable number of troubling questions about the NEA
remain, one of which is the question of its direction.
Chairman John Frohnmeyer has, at best, provided uncertain
leadership. When the Senior Deputy Chairman, Alvin
Felzenberg, tried to caution Mr. Frohnmeyer about some of the
more questionable projects being put forward for funding, Mr.
Felzenberg's days were numbered. Then, in May, Mr. Felzenberg
returned a phone call made by Evans and Novak, who were
preparing a column on Karen Finley's theater act, at the time
in the running for a grant.</p>
<p>Agitated over the growing, and in our view, well-merited,
notoriety connected with certain NEA grants, Chairman
Frohnmeyer focused his suspicions on the Senior Deputy. He
then ordered a complete computer search of Mr. Felzenberg's
phone records. Shortly thereafter, Chairman Frohnmeyer fired
Mr. Felzenberg -- a man who has, by all accounts, compiled a
sterling record as an arts administrator. None of this speaks
well for Chairman Frohnmeyer's tolerance of diversity -- that
same tolerance that we hear the National Endowment has been
trying to do so much to nurture.</p>
<p>In the end of course, the important issue is that of the
NEA itself. The question of whether government should be in
the business of funding art has always been a thorny one. The
Endowment was originally intended as an educational
enterprise, whose mission was to transmit the values of
civilization, to make great works of art, from the past to
the present, available to citizens.</p>
<p>It is now involved heavily in something a far cry from
those original purposes, having arrogated to itself the role
of funder for "cutting edge" creativity as represented by
Miss Finley and Mr. Fleck. Those Members of Congress who want
to salvage the Endowment would do well to consider
legislation that would bring the agency back in line with its
original purpose.</p>
