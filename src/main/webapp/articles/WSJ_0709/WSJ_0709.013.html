	<p class="article-leader">SO MUCH TO talk about. And so little nerve. The
contentious issues seem endless. A unified Germany. A unified
Europe. The end of the U.S.-British special relationship.
U.S.-Japanese trade squabbles. EC trade squabbles with just
about everybody. At the end of their meeting, the summit
leaders will issue a communique saying everything is just
splendid. But before they do, imagine some of the private
conversations -- even if they're probably too candid ever to
occur.
