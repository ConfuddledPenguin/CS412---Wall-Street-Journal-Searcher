	<p class="article-leader">Renault Vehicules Industriels, boosting its bet that it
can turn around troubled Mack Trucks Inc., plans this week to
start a $99 million tender offer for the 55% of Mack it
doesn't already own.
   If the Renault offer succeeds, the French truck maker will
have taken over Mack as the U.S. company faces a still
sluggish market for heavy-duty trucks, draining financial
losses and an urgent need to refinance its debt.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Paris-based Renault, a unit of government-owned Regie
Nationale des Usines Renault, is trying to shore up Mack,
which gives Renault an entry into the U.S. market amid an
international consolidation in the truck industry. Renault
already puts the famous Mack name on some trucks it exports
to the U.S.</p>
<p>At a Mack board meeting in Paris Friday, Renault disclosed
its plans to begin a $6-a-share tender offer Thursday for the
16.5 million common shares of Mack outside Renault's control.
The offer is conditioned on agreement by Mack's lenders to
relax the terms of their loans to Mack.</p>
<p>The market anticipated a higher bid to surface as Mack
shares Friday rose $1.25 to close at $6.50 apiece. Mack was
the most active stock in national over-the-counter trading,
with 2.6 million shares changing hands. The stock traded
higher than $15 as recently as early 1989.</p>
<p>The Mack board, four of whose nine members are Renault
officials, didn't immediately respond to the proposal except
to say it had set up a committee to study it. But Ralph
Reins, Mack's chairman and chief executive officer, said in a
letter to employees that he views the Renault bid as "a very
positive development in the longterm restructuring efforts of
Mack."</p>
<p>Analysts noted that, in addition to the chance the board
might negotiate a higher price by Renault, there has been
speculation that another big U.S. truck maker, such as
Navistar International Corp., might yet make a rival offer
for Mack.</p>
<p>Mack isn't a big player in the long-haul truck market, but
its strong position in the "vocational" market that includes
mining, refuse and construction vehicles might be attractive
to another bidder. Yesterday, Navistar couldn't be reached
for comment.</p>
<p>Mack, based in Allentown, Pa., has been a souring
investment for Renault, which began to accumulate its current
45% ownership in 1979. The parent Renault also owns a warrant
and convertible debentures in Mack that raise its position to
61% on a fully diluted basis.</p>
<p>In recent years, Mack has struggled through the rocky
start-up of a plant in South Carolina, contentious relations
with the United Auto Workers union and foulups in introducing
a new long-haul truck model. Currently, its share of the
North American heavy-duty truck market stands at between 12%
and 13%, down about six points from a decade ago.</p>
<p>Though a new, Renault-approved management has taken charge
of Mack during the past year, the company still faces a
sagging domestic market. Sales of heavy-duty trucks in the
U.S. in 1990 could fall 14% from 1989 levels to 125,000
units, according to Gary McManus, an analyst at Merrill Lynch
Research/U.S. The Mack work force has been pared by another
870 people this year to 7,000, after drastic cuts in previous
years.</p>
<p>In Paris, Elios Pascual, a senior vice president of
Renault and a member of Mack's board, told Dow Jones
International News Service that Renault has "started to see a
change in mentality at Mack, but we came to the conclusion
that it would be impossible to carry out the restructuring of
Mack that is necessary without having complete control" of
the U.S. company.</p>
<p>As Renault announced its plans to lift its stake to 100%,
Mack was making some downbeat forecasts. Though Mack early
this year had hoped to achieve profitability by the end of
1990, it said it now doesn't expect to break into the black
before 1992. It projected losses of about $90 million,
including a charge of $21 million related to warranty
reserves, for the first half of 1990, and a loss of about
$130 million for the full year.</p>
<p>Last year, the company incurred losses of $185.4 million,
or $6.24 a share, on sales of $1.75 billion.</p>
<p>Renault said its tender offer will be conditioned on
waivers from Mack's lenders that would allow Mack to remain
in compliance with its loans through 1990.</p>
<p>Currently, Mack expects to be in technical default of
terms of an agreement with a group of banks led by Citicorp's
Citibank and Credit Lyonnais, once Mack's second-quarter
results are announced. That agreement, reached this year,
covers a three-year term loan of $148 million. Mack is also
seeking a long-term extension of the maturity date of a $350
million revolving credit agreement between its Mack Financial
Corp. subsidiary and a second banking group.</p>
<p>Vincent Hartnett, an executive at Penske Truck Leasing
Co., one of Mack's biggest customers, said an acquisition by
Renault would strengthen Mack. "Renault had a commitment as a
stockholder, but that commitment will only be stronger as a
full owner," he said.</p>
<p>But Winfred Weldon, a Detroit-area Mack dealer who owns
4,000 shares of Mack stock, called Renault's offer low,
because he believes Mack has taken its biggest lumps and will
do well in the future. "Where could a {bidder} buy a
corporation as big as Mack Trucks for this kind of money?" he
asked.</p>
<p>Renault said its tender offer will expire Aug. 8.
Conditions in addition to the waivers by lenders are approval
of the offer by Mack directors unaffiliated with Renault, and
the tendering of sufficient shares to give Renault a 90%
stake in Mack before the exercise of Renault's warrant or the
conversion of its debentures.</p>
