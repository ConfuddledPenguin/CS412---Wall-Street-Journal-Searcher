	<p class="article-leader">BALTIMORE (AP) -- The state Human Relations Commission has
charged Domino's Pizza Inc. with religious discrimination for
refusing to hire a bearded Sikh man, whose religion bars him
from shaving.
   The nationwide chain requires all employees to be
cleanshaven, but no Maryland health law prohibits food
service employees from having beards.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The June 28 commission complaint said that Prabhjot S.
Kohli, of Catonsville, was refused employment when he applied
for a job as manager of a Domino's store in December 1987.</p>
<p>Herb James, personnel director of LOOC Inc., the Domino's
franchise that interviewed Mr. Kohli, said the complaint was
"a slap in the face to us when we are desperately trying to
work things out with this individual."</p>
<p>Mr. James, quoted in Saturday's Baltimore Sun, said Mr.
Kohli knew the dress code and policies when he interviewed
for the job and that he also was unwilling to work the
weekend and night hours required. He said other company jobs
that did not involve contact with the public were available,
but Mr. Kohli refused to consider them.</p>
<p>Mr. Kohli, now an engineer with the State Highway
Administration, said he applied for the advertised position
of senior manager because he had 18 years' experience as a
salesman. He said he was not interested in the other jobs.</p>
<p>The complaint, filed with the state administrative hearing
examiner, asks that Domino's pay Mr. Kohli for two years of
lost earnings and that he be hired as a Domino's manager. The
examiner's office will hold a public hearing later.</p>
