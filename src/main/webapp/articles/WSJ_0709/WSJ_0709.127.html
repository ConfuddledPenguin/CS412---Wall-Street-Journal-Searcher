	<p class="article-leader">BERN -- Switzerland's cost-of-living index in June inched
up 0.1% from May and rose 5% from a year earlier, the
government said, noting that more favorable oil and energy
prices helped slow the pace of inflation.
   The increases represented a slowdown from May's rises of
0.5% from the preceding month and 5.1% from a year earlier.</p>
