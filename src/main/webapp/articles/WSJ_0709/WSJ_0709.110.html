	<p class="article-leader">How's this for loyalty?
   Six months ago, John Tauer recommended SciMed Life Systems
Inc. in this column's stock-picking contest. The stock has
since gained more than 51%, beating out those issues selected
by three other investment professionals in January. And that
earns a return visit for Mr. Tauer, who is director of
research for Minneapolis brokerage firm Piper, Jaffray &
Hopwood.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>So what stock does Mr. Tauer pick for the next six months?
SciMed. The company, based in Minneapolis, makes balloon
angioplasty catheters -- tubes with a tiny expandable balloon
attached that can be inserted into arteries in the heart to
unblock clogged passageways.</p>
<p>Mr. Tauer is the first Investment Dartboard winner under
new rules that make it strictly a six-month contest. The
change was made mainly to minimize the impact of short-term
jumps in the recommended stocks immediately after
publication.</p>
<p>In the six months through June, the four investment pros
who picked in January outpaced a random "dartboard
portfolio," which was selected by Journal staff members
tossing darts at stock listings. The pros averaged a 12.7%
gain. The four dart picks were unchanged (on average) for the
period, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.5%.</p>
<p>Mr. Tauer's decision to stick with SciMed flies in the
face of many investors' belief that chasing big gainers isn't
wise. But Mr. Tauer thinks SciMed still has a long way to go.
He'd buy it at anywhere near Friday's closing price of
$38.50, up 87.5 cents on the day, and says it "certainly
could go into the 50s by the end of the year."</p>
<p>Sales and earnings are growing quickly. Sales were only
$27 million in the year ended in February 1989. Sales grew to
$67 million in fiscal 1990, and Mr. Tauer expects them to hit
$126 million in the current year. Meanwhile, per-share
earnings have shot up to $1.29 from 33 cents. Mr. Tauer looks
for $2.15 this year.</p>
<p>He cautions that SciMed is an "aggressive" pick that
carries real risks. SciMed has only one major product. The
stock sells at a high multiple of earnings (18 times this
year's estimated earnings, 25 times the past 12 months'
earnings). And there are some patent-infringement suits
pending against the company.</p>
<p>Still, he says, "They've got an extremely good product.
This is a pure play in . . . a fast-growing area of
medicine."</p>
<p>Finishing second for the past six months, with an 8% gain
in Snap-On Tools Corp., was Randall Eley, president of Edgar
Lomax Co., a money management firm in Alexandria, Va. Mr.
Eley's new pick is V.F. Corp., a clothing maker in
Wyomissing, Pa., best-known for its Wrangler and Rustler
brand jeans and Jantzen sportswear.</p>
<p>But its jeans are the part of the business that's been
struggling a bit, Mr. Eley says. V.F.'s three other lines --
sportswear, intimate apparel and occupational apparel -- are
all "experiencing steady growth."</p>
<p>Steady earnings appeal keenly to Mr. Eley as the economy
sputters. He doesn't necessarily expect a recession this
year, but he is picking investments "on the basis that a
recession could occur -- or could be under way."</p>
<p>In June, Standard & Poor's Corp. and Moody's Investors
Service Inc. both said they were considering downgrading
V.F.'s debt. S&P cited "manufacturing, marketing and
distribution problems" in jeans and sportswear. Mr. Eley says
the announcement "is a concern" but that the bad news has
caused the stock to drop to a bargain level.</p>
<p>As for those jeans, Mr. Eley says V.F. has lost some
market share to competitors but has taken steps to bolster
profitability by closing some plants and cutting costs. This
"ought to keep the line profitable," he says. "My team is
projecting earnings of $2.50 a share as the worst possible
case."</p>
<p>V.F. closed at $26, up 75 cents Friday. Mr. Eley would pay
as much as $28 for it, with a target price of $38. He thinks
the target might be hit within six months "if everything
falls into place."</p>
<p>The other two contestants this month, Alan Bond and
Jonathan Steinberg, would have been winners under the
previous rules.</p>
<p>Mr. Bond, equity portfolio manager at W.R. Lazard & Co. in
New York, likes Nike Inc. The Beaverton, Ore., athletic shoe
and apparel maker sold Friday for $80, up $2, but Mr. Bond
thinks a fair target is $95 within a year.</p>
<p>He says Nike is doing very well with "cross training"
shoes (usable for more than one sport) and hiking shoes and
is increasing its percentage of revenue derived from clothing
other than footwear. Though the stock has performed well, it
isn't too high-priced, he says, selling for 14 times the past
12 months' per-share earnings.</p>
<p>As a kicker, Mr. Bond says Nike's board is likely to
approve a stock split and listing on the New York Stock
Exchange, two steps that may help the stock attract a wider
group of buyers.</p>
<p>Mr. Steinberg, publisher and editor of Individual Investor
magazine, recommends Iomega Corp., a South Roy, Utah, maker
of computer equipment, especially disk drives. The drives,
used in some IBM and Apple Macintosh computers, are "very
cheap, very reliable," Mr. Steinberg says.</p>
<p>"This was a company founded in 1980. At one time it was a
high-flyer," Mr. Steinberg says. "It stumbled in 1986 and
1987 {overestimating demand and having to write off excess
inventories}. The stock was hammered. It has not received
much attention since then."</p>
<p>Mr. Steinberg says Iomega quietly turned profitable in
1988 and 1989 and showed dramatic growth in the first
quarter, with earnings up 57% over the previous year's first
quarter as sales grew 17%. The balance sheet is strong, and
the stock -- which closed at $4.9375, up 6.25 cents Friday --
trades at only about six times earnings.</p>
<p>"The average {price-earnings} multiple for companies like
this is 13," Mr. Steinberg says. If Iomega even comes close
to that, he says, "it's an $8 stock."</p>
<p>Through the end of the year, the pros' picks will compete
against a dartboard portfolio consisting of Clark Equipment
Co., Great Western Financial Corp., Northrop Corp. and Wells
Fargo Co.</p>
