	<p class="article-leader">Exploration Co. of Louisiana Inc., Lafayette, La., said it
agreed to buy additional working interest in the Berry R. Cox
Field area in south Texas for $40 million, a purchase that
will make it the field's operator.
   The company said the area, still in the early development
stage, has nine producing wells and proven reserves of
approximately 200 billion cubic feet of gas. The working
interests in the producing wells vary from 28% to 49% and
include proven reserves of about 60 billion cubic feet.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>To pay for the acquisition, Exploration said it would
begin a rights issue of 600,000 units, each comprising one
share of preferred stock and 10 warrants. The rights issue is
expected to raise about $50 million, the balance of which
will be used to reduce bank debt and provide additional
working capital.</p>
