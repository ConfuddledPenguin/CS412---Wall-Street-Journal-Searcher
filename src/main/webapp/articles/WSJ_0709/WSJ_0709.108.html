	<p class="article-leader">CMS Energy Corp. said a Michigan circuit court judge
removed restrictions on the company's use of its $1.5 billion
of debt and equity interests in the Midland Cogeneration
Venture.
   But the court said that CMS's Consumer's Power Co. utility
unit must maintain a $450 million corporate bond, as ordered
earlier by Michigan regulators.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In its ruling, the court removed all restrictions on the
use by Dearborn, Mich.-based CMS of the $1.2 billion in notes
and $300 million in equity it received in return for its
contribution to the cogeneration venture. The venture is a
1,380-megawatt power plant converted from CMS's failed effort
to build a nuclear plant in Midland.</p>
<p>The court action also relieved CMS of having to file a
$100 million surety bond previously required by another
court.</p>
<p>CMS said the decision will become effective Aug. 3, and
the company isn't planning an appeal.</p>
