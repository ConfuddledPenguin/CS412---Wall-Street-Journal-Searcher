	<p class="article-leader">B.F. Goodrich Co. said it agreed to sell its Off-Highway
Braking Systems business to Carlisle Cos. Terms weren't
disclosed.
   The business, based in Bloomington, Ind., makes brakes and
hydraulic controls used on construction, mining and other
off-highway vehicles. It had sales of about $47 million in
1989.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Goodrich, an Akron, Ohio, maker of plastics, specialty
chemicals and aircraft parts, said the divestiture reflects
its belief that the business would be a better fit "within a
company specializing in groundtransportation equipment."
Carlisle, of Syracuse, N.Y., makes products for automotive,
industrial and construction markets.</p>
<p>Goodrich said the sale is subject to approval by
appropriate governmental agencies.</p>
