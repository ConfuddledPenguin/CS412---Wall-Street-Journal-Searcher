	<p class="article-leader">JAPAN'S REPRESENTATIVE at the Houston summit, Toshiki
Kaifu, is a boyishly telegenic 59-year-old who honed his
considerable skills in public speaking as a college
oratory-society star. For a media event like a seven-nation
economic summit meeting where imagery is everything, Central
Casting couldn't have picked a better man to play the role of
Japanese prime minister.
   "He is the type who will do well at a summit," says
Shinsaku Kohei, a Kyorin University political scientist.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But if they gave an award in Houston for "World Leader
Most Fortunate to Be Here," Mr. Kaifu would win hands down.
As his recent political history attests, the relationship
between a Japanese prime minister's summit skills and his
domestic power base can range from indirect to inverse.</p>
<p>Only a few months ago, Mr. Kaifu's days as Japan's prime
minister seemed numbered. A member of a small faction in the
ruling party, he had never been a power hitter in Japanese
politics. The ruling party's faction bosses, who normally
select a prime minister from among their own ranks, had
chosen him last August only because it temporarily suited
their convenience. Unlike all of them, he was untainted by
scandal, and scandal was the hot political issue of the
moment. But by early this year some of them were already
scheming to replace him. Pundits were speculating that
someone else might be representing Japan in Houston.</p>
<p>Today that's all ancient history. Not only is Mr. Kaifu
still prime minister but he has for much of the spring been
scoring high popularity ratings in public-opinion polls. His
enemies among the faction bosses have stopped sniping at him.
And the pundits are now saying he could easily rule through
the end of next year, perhaps longer.</p>
<p>Mr. Kaifu saved himself with a foreign-policy triumph. He
defanged a nasty spat with the U.S. over "structural
impediments" to trade that could have undone even a stronger
prime minister. At the risk of domestic criticism for
appearing to kowtow, he flew to California on short notice
for talks with President Bush. Returning to Japan, he dodged
further attacks over his handling of the meeting and pleaded
personally with recalcitrant bureaucrats and politicians for
concessions, stressing that the measures the U.S. was
demanding were in Japan's own interests.</p>
<p>The risk paid off: The face-to-face session with the
president made it easier for him to overcome domestic
opposition, and made the U.S. more inclined to give the
benefit of the doubt to the concessions he eventually
produced. The "structural-impediments" issue flared again in
June, but by then Mr. Kaifu's public popularity was secure.
When his performance won acclaim both in Washington and at
home, one of his critics in the party, Toshio Yamaguchi, paid
him a wry compliment. "Kaifusan has gone from the smallest
and weakest faction to the largest and strongest -- the Bush
faction," Mr. Yamaguchi told a Japanese magazine.</p>
<p>Mr. Yamaguchi's one-liner encapsulates some of the central
verities of Japanese politics: The public doesn't elect a
prime minister; party faction bosses do. But a prime minister
who is weak with the faction bosses can hang on to his job if
the public likes him. And one way to win public support is to
handle foreign policy well.</p>
<p>Because his factional power base is so weak, Mr. Kaifu is
an especially stark example of how to do well with diplomacy.
Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone also bolstered his
popularity by his handling of foreign policy, but Mr.
Nakasone was a faction boss in his own right. Mr. Kaifu, on
the other hand, "knows that his only way to survive is to be
liked by the Japanese people," says Kenichi Takemura, an
author and television commentator. "The party can't dump him
when President Bush seems to be backing him up and when the
majority of the Japanese think he has done well for us."</p>
<p>The party also can't dump Mr. Kaifu as long as he has the
support of former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, whose
strong faction of Liberal Democratic Party Diet members makes
him perhaps the single most powerful figure in Japanese
politics. Earlier this year, when Mr. Kaifu was under fire,
Mr. Takeshita's attitude toward him was at best unclear. More
recently, Mr. Takeshita has expressed strong support.</p>
<p>Mr. Kaifu, the son of a photo-studio owner, was first
elected to the Diet at age 29 from his home prefecture of
Aichi in central Japan. He is an avid swimmer and is often
shown on Japanese television doing laps in hotel pools. His
strong-minded wife, Sachiyo, at first refused to move into
the cramped residence for prime ministers, but later
relented.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Kaifu has never held the cabinet portfolios
associated with diplomacy -- foreign affairs, finance, or
trade and industry -- he wasn't totally unprepared to play
the foreign-policy card. He has been active in
parliamentary-exchange associations between Japan and a
number of countries, including West Germany. And in 1975 he
attended the first economic summit as an aide to his mentor,
the reformist Prime Minister Takeo Miki.</p>
<p>The problem with the foreign-policy card is that, like
most cards, it's two-edged. The LDP faction leaders dumped
Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki in 1982 because they thought he
was causing relations with the U.S. to deteriorate. The
bosses moved against Mr. Suzuki although he was an LDP
faction leader himself. Even a less serious foreign-policy
slip could undermine a prime minister whose main basis of
support is foreign-policy acumen.</p>
<p>The already-shaky government of Mr. Kaifu, for example,
would have been pushed even closer to the brink by a critical
U.S. response to his report on structural impediments. "Had
the U.S. government expressed strong displeasure with the
report and doubt about Mr. Kaifu's leadership, his
administration could have been placed in a position of being
on the verge of collapse," Toru Hayano, associate political
editor of the newspaper Asahi, wrote. That may sound extreme
to foreigners, who may find it hard to imagine their own
government being so vulnerable to foreign criticism, but many
Japanese would not find it extreme at all. Despite the
enormous economic strides their country has made, many
Japanese still fear being isolated in the world, and despite
growing resentment of U.S. bullying over trade, most Japanese
still see their country's relationship with the U.S. as
critical.</p>
<p>So Mr. Kaifu will be on his toes in Houston. He'll try to
keep his tie out of his soup and to avoid incautious remarks
on domestically sensitive topics, like Japan's ban on rice
imports. He'll be well briefed on issues ranging from Eastern
Europe to the environment, and unlike some previous Japanese
summiteers, he may even actively participate in the debate.</p>
<p>If Mr. Kaifu takes his cues from Japan's past master of
summitry, Mr. Nakasone, his first priority will be
maneuvering himself to the center of the group photographs.
When Mr. Nakasone first did that, at the Williamsburg, Va.,
summit in 1983, Japan collectively tingled with pride. Mr.
Nakasone's popularity ratings soared seven percentage points
in one month.</p>
<p>In 1988, when Prime Minister Takeshita got jostled to the
edge of the photo at the Toronto summit, a Japanese wire
service wrote a story about the important event, noting in
the lead that it was "the first time for Japan to miss out on
an inside spot" since 1982.</p>
<p>"As the cameras clicked," the story concluded, "Takeshita
found himself standing almost stiffly at the extreme end, the
same position where Takeo Miki, Japan's first prime minister
to join the annual event, started 14 years ago."</p>
