	<p class="article-leader">MONTREAL -- Canadian financier Paul Desmarais and
Belgium's Albert Frere cemented their new alliance but stayed
mum on their ultimate plans for the two European holding
companies they control, Pargesa Holding S.A. and Groupe
Bruxelles Lambert S.A.
   Messrs. Desmarais and Frere said they agreed in principle
to formally combine their holdings in Pargesa and GBL. Their
combined 50% interest in Pargesa, a Swiss investment concern,
will be transferred to a new holding company equally owned by
the Frere group and by a subsidiary of Power Corp. of Canada,
which is controlled by Mr. Desmarais.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Frere's 8% interest in GBL will be transferred to a
second new holding company, also equally owned by Mr. Frere's
group and the Power Corp. subsidiary. Pargesa holds an
additional 37% of GBL, giving Messrs. Frere and Desmarais
effective control of GBL. Mr. Frere is also chairman of GBL.
A Power Corp. official said the 37% block of GBL will
continue to be held by Pargesa.</p>
<p>Messrs. Desmarais and Frere announced in February that
they hold 50% of Pargesa and intended to work together
closely. Since then they have been working out the details of
their alliance, but haven't said much about their investment
plans or how the partnership will work.</p>
<p>A Power Corp. official said Friday that "our intention is
jointly to actively develop the holdings of Pargesa and GBL."
He declined to elaborate. He said the agreement in principle
will be signed by the end of the summer.</p>
<p>Pargesa and GBL have been cleaning house since Messrs.
Frere and Desmarais teamed up. In a series of sometimes
complex transactions the two concerns have sold certain
interests in other companies and reorganized their respective
links to French banking concern Cie. Financiere de Paribas.
Through various companies Mr. Frere and Mr. Desmarais hold
nearly 10% of Paribas, giving them an important voice at the
merchant bank.</p>
<p>As Pargesa and GBL tidy up, they are accumulating cash,
giving Messrs. Frere and Desmarais a war chest of unknown
size. Pargesa and GBL officials have said both companies are
actively seeking new investments.</p>
<p>Bolstering their cash position is Mr. Desmarais's
substantial funds in Canada. Mr. Desmarais said last month
that any Power Corp. investment in Europe will be funneled
through Pargesa. Power Corp. and its Power Financial Corp.
subsidiary each sold major interests in other companies last
year. At March 31 Power Corp. had about 750 million Canadian
dollars (US$645 million) in cash and short-term investments.</p>
<p>Emile Quevrin, a GBL director, said recently that part of
the proceeds from GBL's asset sales will be used to help
raise the company's interest in Petrofina S.A., a big
Brussels-based oil and petrochemical concern, to 25% from
about 20%. But Mr. Quevrin said "we aren't in a hurry" and
that GBL will wait for favorable market conditions.</p>
<p>Regarding other possible investments, Mr. Quevrin would
only say GBL will favor industries with which it has some
experience. At a shareholders meeting at the end of May, Mr.
Frere said the company will seek high-quality companies where
it can have a significant influence.</p>
<p>That may reflect in part Mr. Desmarais's influence. A
successful investor in North America, Mr. Desmarais's Power
Corp. usually seeks a controlling stake in companies it
invests in.</p>
