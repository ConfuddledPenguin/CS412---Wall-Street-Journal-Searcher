	<p class="article-leader">PRAGUE -- Anti-communist political leaders from the Soviet
Union meeting here last week had little interest in what the
world press sees as a historic event back home, the 28th
Congress of the Soviet Communist Party in Moscow. They
believe that the party already is dead, incapable of
self-reform. As hard-bitten veterans of prison camps and
other indignities, they are not so naive as to imagine that
the Communists in the governing soviets will voluntarily fire
themselves. But they think that the system is collapsing and
that it soon will be possible to build new, democratic,
free-market edifices on its shards.
   A letter was read to the group from Gennady Cherepanov, a
dissident lawyer who didn't make it to Prague because the
Soviet authorities had thrown him in jail. "The time of hope
is over," he wrote. "To sweeten communism is impossible. It
has to be destroyed." Few disagreed with that. There was a
consensus that Western attempts to prop up Mikhail Gorbachev
can only prolong the agony.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The Communist Party is losing strength every day," said
Yuri Yarim-Agaev, president of the Center for Democracy in
the U.S.S.R., a U.S.-based group that helped organize the
conference. Even if the party congress produces something
other than tedium before it winds up Friday, it will not put
food on Soviet tables or lessen the anger of the people.
World chess champion Gary Kasparov, here as leader of the new
Democratic Party in Russia, repeated his prediction that
there will be no Soviet Union by the end of next year.</p>
<p>With all due allowance for exaggerated hopes of political
dissidents, the Kasparov prediction is not beyond belief. As
the Journal's David Brooks, Paul A. Gigot and Peter Gumbel
reported last week, the signs of disintegration within the
party and the state are unmistakable. All over the U.S.S.R.,
party and nonparty factions are engaged in turf battles over
who will control buildings, newspapers and broadcasting
stations. Outright fighting in Azerbaijan, Armenia and
Uzbekistan in recent months has demonstrated the potential
for civil war. One knowledgeable Russian, not involved with
the Prague meeting, says that Armenia has 90,000 young men
available for guerrilla warfare.</p>
<p>Western leaders, such as Francois Mitterrand of France,
see a danger of catastrophe -- war, famine, civil disorder
and epidemics caused by a breakdown of water and sewage
systems. Such fears are realistic. But the dissidents believe
a breakdown is inevitable, and necessary if there is to be
true reform.</p>
<p>It may well be. Mikhail Gorbachev's five-year effort to
reform Soviet communism from within has produced nothing but
expanded economic disorder. Anti-communism has been spreading
rapidly, particularly in the non-Russian republics, where new
national fronts have begun to achieve significant power and
to demand independence from the "center," meaning Moscow. The
stage at the Prague Palace of Culture, where the conference
was held, had seats for representatives of separatist
movements in 11 non-Russian republics, plus places for
Russian democrats, a representative of the Crimean Tatars and
an envoy of the Jewish movements.</p>
<p>Georgi Chanturia, representing the National Democratic
Party of Georgia, said that the use of Soviet troops and
poison gas to put down demonstrations in the Georgian capital
of Tbilisi in April last year enraged Georgians. They now
reject Gorbachev hints at confederation and are demanding
total independence, he said.</p>
<p>Tafik Gasymov represented the Popular Front of Azerbaijan,
which had for all practical purposes seized control of the
republic's government before Soviet troops shot their way
into Baku early this year. Since then, he says, "the movement
has become much stronger. Freedom cannot be driven away." Mr.
Gorbachev's blockade of Lithuania has done little to damp
down demands for independence in the Baltic States.
Moldavia's delegate said that his country, populated by
people who regard themselves as Romanians, was raped along
with the Baltic States by the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact and the
resulting Soviet occupation in 1940. Byelorussia's
representative claims Stalin massacred 100,000 of his
countrymen in the war years. Stalin's wartime deportation of
the Crimean Tatars to Kazakhstan, with more than half dying
along the way, was recounted.</p>
<p>In short, there is a long list of grievances against the
Communist Party. It still has its "sword and shield," the
KGB, to help it control populations. But Georgi Katsenkov, a
former apparatchik for the Central Committee of the party,
said the KGB too is being disrupted from within, as evidenced
by the recent disloyalty of retired KGB Maj. Gen. Oleg
Kalugin. He broke secrecy to describe a vast KGB network of
spies and "agents provocateur" operating within the Soviet
population.</p>
<p>"There also are certain trends toward dissolution in the
army," said Mr. Katsenkov. "The standard of living for
officers, even generals, is low. Lower-level officers exploit
the privates. Over five years, more people have died inside
the army than were killed in Afghanistan."</p>
<p>The conference had as its theme "The Peaceful Road to
Democracy" but its communique warned of civil war and accused
the central authorities of provoking ethnic conflicts "so
they can represent themselves as the instruments of peace and
quiet." This policy, the communique said, is "turning the
country into a giant Beirut." To resolve the problem and
prevent bloodshed "it is necessary to dissolve the union and
permit the establishment of independent democratic states."</p>
<p>The Soviet economy continues to spin downward.
Distribution of goods has been disrupted by rail-car tie-ups,
generating food shortages. The country is short on foreign
exchange and its credit rating is sinking. Communist Party
members have been defecting in droves in such places as the
Western Ukraine. Moscow clearly is worried about defections
by local militias, or police forces, of the type that
occurred in the Trans-Caucasus. Mr. Gorbachev took pains to
disarm the police in Lithuania. Army desertions and refusals
to serve have been spreading.</p>
<p>But there was one note of warning. Karen Simonyan, a
member of the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R., said that the
new "islands of freedom" within the Soviet Union "bear the
burden of the unknown." There is a danger of famine, he said,
and "what may happen in the near future could be tragic."
Hence, public rancor may turn against the democratic
movements. The Communist apparatchiks could say to the
people, "Now you have democratic leaders and look what you
have. You can have us and stability or democratic leadership
with chaos and anarchy."</p>
<p>Perhaps that is a danger, but it may be an irrelevant one
if the Soviet system is in fact heading down the road to
total collapse.</p>
