	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- A federal judge set aside a jury's $5.7 million
damage award to the investor group that bought a subsidiary
from Baxter International Inc.
   U.S. District Judge Suzanne B. Conlon upheld the panel's
finding that Baxter had defrauded the investor group, Medcom
Holding Inc., when Baxter sold the group its Medcom Inc.
medical-training materials operation in 1986.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the judge ordered a new trial on the issue of damages,
saying that the jury's award wasn't "rationally related to
the evidence." The jury had also awarded Medcom Holding $10
million in punitive damages; Judge Conlon postponed a ruling
on the reasonableness of the punitive damages award until the
conclusion of the new trial.</p>
<p>The judge let stand, however, the federal jury's March
finding that Baxter violated securities law, breached its
contract with Medcom Holding and committed common-law fraud
in the sale.</p>
<p>Baxter paid more than $50 million when it acquired Medcom
in 1982. It took losses on it for the next several years, and
eventually sold it to the investor group for $3.8 million.
The group had contended that Baxter provided a misleading
balance sheet and misrepresented the value of Medcom's
inventory of medical-training films when it offered the unit
for sale in 1986.</p>
<p>A Baxter attorney declined to comment on the ruling.</p>
