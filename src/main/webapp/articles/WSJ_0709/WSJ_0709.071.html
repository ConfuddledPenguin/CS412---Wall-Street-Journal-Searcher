	<p class="article-leader">MONTREAL -- Workers at three Stone Container Corp. paper
mills in Quebec narrowly ratified new labor contracts, but
the settlement, which sets the pattern for contracts covering
30,000 pulp and paper workers in eastern Canada, may run into
trouble at other mills.
   "We still face some difficulties in the rest of Canada,"
said Don Holder, president of the Canadian Paperworkers
Union. He said some companies may be reluctant to grant
workers perquisites, such as bonus vacation pay, which are
included in the contracts at Stone Container, a Chicago-based
paper and packaging concern. Given the slim margin of
approval at the three Stone Container mills, rejection of the
contract at some other mills is a possibility, Mr. Holder
said. He said the union leadership is satisfied with the
settlement.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Just 56.4% of workers at the three Stone Container mills
voted in favor of the contract. The three-year agreement
includes an hourly wage increase of 85 Canadian cents (73
U.S. cents) in the first year and 5.5% pay increases in each
of the following two years. The current base wage at mills in
eastern Canada is 15.37 Canadian dollars (US$13.22) an hour.</p>
<p>The three paper mills are operated by the
Stone-Consolidated Inc. unit of Stone Container. In New York
Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Stone Container
shares closed at $15.75, up 12.5 cents.</p>
<p>Analysts said the settlement may face a rough ride at
certain mills but generally expect that it will be adopted
without major problems throughout the region by the end of
the summer. They said the agreement at the Stone Container
mills removes the threat of an industrywide strike in eastern
Canada, because in pattern bargaining, other sites usually
fall in line with the initial settlement. This in turn may
force North American newsprint producers to give up a June 1
price increase. "There's definitely going to be pressure,"
said Stephen Atkinson, an analyst at Deacon BZW Ltd.</p>
<p>The threat of a strike helped most major North American
newsprint producers push through price increases of about 5%
last month. Eastern Canada is a major source of newsprint for
U.S. and Canadian publishers. The benchmark Eastern U.S. list
price for newsprint rose 5.4% to $685 a metric ton from $650.
A metric ton is 2,204.6 pounds. A similar increase took
effect in other markets, where the pricing system is slightly
different. Newsprint now is sold at about a 19% discount from
list price.</p>
<p>In anticipation of a possible strike, publishers built up
their inventories of newsprint this spring. Analysts said
publishers now will probably reduce inventories.</p>
<p>Separately on Friday, the Canadian Pulp and Paper
Association said Canadian production of newsprint in May rose
2% from a year earlier, as the industry operated at 97% of
capacity.</p>
<p>The industry group said Canadian mills produced 847,000
metric tons of newsprint in May, compared with 830,000 tons a
year earlier. For the first five months of this year,
production fell 1.6% to 3,971,000 metric tons from 4,037,000
tons.</p>
<p>The 97% operating rate in May was up from 93% in April and
96% in May 1989.</p>
<p>The association said U.S. consumer stocks at the end of
May totaled 1,299,000 metric tons, a 40-day supply, up from
1,276,000 tons at the end of April, a 37-day supply. Canadian
mills' stocks at the end of May totaled 358,000 metric tons,
down from 372,000 tons at the end of April.</p>
