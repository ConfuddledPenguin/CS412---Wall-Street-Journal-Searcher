	<p class="article-leader">NEURUPPIN, East Germany -- Margot Ohm still remembers the
day -- July 22, 1983 -- when a Soviet missile exploded behind
her house in the nearby village of Frankendorf, blowing off
the roof and shattering all the windows.
   "Fortunately, we were away for the day, at my son's
wedding," recalls Mrs. Ohm, who works in a state-run shoe
store. Soviet and East German officials rushed to the scene,
but they offered no explanation of why the rocket had landed
in her back yard instead of on the nearby target range. "That
wasn't the sort of thing you asked about back then," she
says.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But those days are over.</p>
<p>When a Soviet warplane accidentally dumped three bombs on
another nearby village last month, local citizens launched a
petition and penned a testy letter to Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev.</p>
<p>While this might seem a normal response anywhere else,
it's remarkable in East Germany, where for decades no one
dared criticize the Soviets. Now, however, the Soviets are
under mounting pressure to get their 380,000 troops out of
East Germany. In villages where daily life is often disrupted
by a Soviet air base and target range, the sentiment is that
the sooner they're gone the better.</p>
<p>Indeed, finding a way to ease the Soviets out without
alienating them threatens to slow German unification.</p>
<p>The West, eager to keep a united Germany in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, is packaging concessions aimed
at smoothing the way for a graceful Soviet exit. The deal may
bring drastic cuts of the united Germany's armed forces,
perhaps down to 200,000 men, from the combined total of
almost 600,000 now.</p>
<p>But East German officials, who met with their Warsaw Pact
allies this month, say the Soviets are planning to stay for
at least seven more years.</p>
<p>Many East Germans may not be willing to wait that long.
Just days after last month's accidental bombing, protesters
marched to Neuruppin's sprawling air base. About 100 East
Germans from the crowd of 6,000 scrambled over a coil of
barbed wire and rushed onto the airport's runway, turning
back only after confronting armed Soviet soldiers.</p>
<p>Even if East Germans are willing to tolerate a long
transition, last week's introduction of the West German mark
into East Germany shatters an economic system that supported
the Soviet presence.</p>
<p>Soviet officers were active in East Germany's thriving
black market, swapping such commodities as gasoline for East
and West German currency, which they used to buy goods
difficult to obtain at home. They also operated an extensive
gray market for labor, sending their wives and even
conscripts to work in East German factories.</p>
<p>Neuruppin's large meat packing plant, for instance, has 20
Soviet women among its staff of 250. "It happened
everywhere," says Reiner Frank, who was Neuruppin's mayor for
the past two years.</p>
<p>Much of this activity will come to a grinding halt after
East Germany converts to a market economy. As of last week,
the Soviets were paid in West German marks.</p>
<p>On the official level, East Germany is hardly a hotbed of
anti-Soviet sentiment. But in everyday life, East Germans
sneeringly refer to their Soviet "guests" as "Ivan." These
feelings are especially strong in towns and villages close to
military installations.</p>
<p>Neuruppin's air base, for instance, is nestled close to
the town's central business district. Planes taking off and
landing create a racket that begins at 6 a.m. and often goes
on until midnight.</p>
<p>Citizens have quietly lobbied against the base for two
years, writing letters that disappeared into the vast Soviet
military bureaucracy. Only since November have they become
bold enough to stage public rallies. The one last month
featured placards reading: "Ivan, aren't you homesick?"</p>
<p>Unlike bases in West Germany, where community relations
are considered routine, the Soviets don't have anyone to
formally hear East German complaints.</p>
<p>"I telephoned the Soviet commander every night for five
weeks before I finally got through to somebody to complain,"
says Norbert Arndt, the gardener in Neuruppin's cemetery,
which lies right under the airport's flight path.</p>
<p>Leading a visitor down a dusty path between rows of
headstones, Mr. Arndt points to the graveyard where all trees
were removed 20 years ago so that planes could fly even
lower. "Most days," he says, "you can smell the burning jet
fuel -- a really nice touch for a funeral."</p>
<p>In the nearby village of Raegelin, where three bombs fell
last month, the top 33 feet of the town's church steeple were
removed in the early 1970s to make it easier for warplanes on
their way to the target range. "It wouldn't have occurred to
anyone to complain," says Hartmut Pieper, the town's mayor.</p>
<p>Working his way through the tall grass on the edge of a
farm pond, Mr. Pieper points to a muddy gash -- the only
evidence left from a bomb that slammed into the ground here,
narrowly missing a group of children who were fishing.</p>
<p>"We're just finding out that we have a voice in these
matters, and that's new for us," says Margaritt Gerlich, a
spokeswoman for the Neuruppin chapter of the political group
New Forum, which supports an immediate halt to all Soviet
flights in the region.</p>
<p>While eager to see the Soviets leave, many East Germans
seem to accept the past injustices as another legacy of the
nation's troubled history. "To most of them {the Soviets},
we're still fascists -- whether we're East or West," says
Jeorg Schultz, an unemployed truck driver.</p>
<p>Crouched over the bar at Zum Brauhof, one of Neuruppin's
watering holes, Mr. Schultz says that the Soviets live
separate lives and that he prefers it that way. They
certainly aren't welcome in this bar. "They have their own
places," says Frank Grothe, the bartender.</p>
<p>Neuruppin, a shabby town dominated by spires of a
12th-century church, reflects the tense relations that exist
between Soviets and East Germans. Although nearly as many
Soviets live here -- about 28,000 -- as Germans, the two
groups almost never mix.</p>
<p>About the only point of daily contact is the town's
cobblestoned main street, where Soviet officers and their
wives shop for goods not available in their own commissary.
And this is where tempers really flare. East Germans complain
that the Soviets buy up whole stocks of scarce items, such as
children's shoes.</p>
<p>There is a still darker side to the tensions. "I would
never walk on a side street here alone at night," says a
young East German housewife. "There are simply too many
stories about women attacked by soldiers."</p>
<p>Local officials say it is impossible to quantify the
amount of crime linked to the Soviet air base, but even Mr.
Frank, the former mayor, concedes, "I don't know if the
police were allowed to keep records of it."</p>
<p>The Soviets conduct their own foot patrols in Neuruppin --
always two soldiers accompanied by an officer. Locals
complain, however, that their own police would never take
action against a Soviet soldier. "If I got jumped by a
Russian, they'd ask me how I knew," says Mr. Grothe, the
bartender. "And if I said it was by the way he talked, they
would tell me the Poles talk the same way. Of course, we have
a lot more Russians here than Poles."</p>
<p>The prospect of a Soviet pullout is giving some East
Germans a new sense of perspective. Mrs. Ohm, who says she
was very upset about damage to her house, has now decided
that authorities did the best they could to make amends.
Soviet troops cleared the rubble, and East German workers
made the repairs at no cost. The East German government even
bought her new furniture. "At least they were fair," she
says. "They fixed it up nicer than it was before the
accident."</p>
