	<p class="article-leader">Southwestern banks, plagued by continuing credit-quality
problems and sluggish loan demand, generally are expected to
report weaker earnings for the second quarter.
   "A lot of banks are planning to take an unusually heavy
provision for loan losses, trying to build up reserves," said
Bruce Hoyt, an analyst with Boettcher & Co., Denver. "This
will probably be one of the toughest quarters of the year."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts are even starting to question the health of some
banks that have already been bailed out, such as First City
Bancorp. of Texas and the former Texas banking network of
First RepublicBank Corp., which was bought by NCNB Corp.,
Charlotte, N.C., in 1988. (First RepublicBank isn't related
to First Republic Bancorp of San Francisco.)</p>
<p>Both rescues included massive infusions of federal aid
that purged the books of sick loans and drastically lowered
the risk to the new owners. But now, concern is rising about
possible problems in the loans extended by the new
managements since they assumed control. Analysts are
particularly worried that the bailed-out banks have been
risking too much of their capital in nationally syndicated
loans financing highly leveraged companies.</p>
<p>"We think that a story that has been viewed as being
without risk is now taking on a different flavor," writes
Charles W. Peabody, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody & Co., in
a recent report to investors.</p>
<p>He notes, for example, that loans in NCNB's Texas bank
grew 14% in the year ended March 31, 1990, adjusted for bad
credits that were sloughed off to the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. as part of NCNB's takeover agreement. This
increase came despite weak loan demand in Texas. During the
same period, credits extended by banks in the state fell by
13%, according to regulatory statistics.</p>
<p>Mr. Peabody views this as evidence that a significant
portion of the NCNB-Texas loan growth occurred outside of
Texas in syndicated loans. "We expect additional problems to
surface in the NCNB-Texas bank's portfolio" in the second
quarter, Mr. Peabody writes.</p>
<p>But Timothy Hartman, vice chairman of NCNB-Texas, denied
Mr. Peabody's assertions. He said that bank's loans actually
grew more than 20% during the period and that "the vast
majority of the loans were to businesses and consumers in
Texas." Mr. Hartman said NCNB-Texas sold more national
credits than it acquired during the period and said
nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans will be
less than 0.8 of 1% in the second quarter, or below the
percentage at the end of the first quarter. He also said he
expects the Texas unit's earnings to be "comparable" to the
first-quarter figure of over $75 million.</p>
<p>At First City, a Houston-based bank holding company
acquired in 1988 by an investor group led by A. Robert
Abboud, some problems with out-of-Texas loans have already
bobbed to the surface. Since the beginning of the year, four
major out-of-state borrowers that owe the bank a collective
$72.5 million have filed for bankruptcy-court protection,
including Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Federated
Department Stores Inc.</p>
<p>Mr. Abboud, former chairman of Chicago-based First Chicago
Corp., says he expects to collect the full amount due on the
loans and believes the rise in nonperforming assets is
slowing. But the problems helped contribute to disappointing
earnings during the first quarter. At the end of June, First
City said it expects to report that second-quarter net fell
to between 75 cents and 95 cents a share from $1.08 a year
earlier.</p>
<p>The weaker earnings also reflect the expense of
consolidating First City's disparate operations. Before the
takeover, First City had 59 separate banks. With the advent
of branch banking in Texas, the new management team has
slimmed that number down to 20, and has consolidated many
back-office functions. Mr. Abboud said he expects to further
reduce staff by about 700 during the next year, or 10%,
through a combination of dismissals and attrition.</p>
<p>A final reason for First City's poor quarter was a
slowdown in sales from the company's collecting bank, a
separate institution set up to liquidate bad loans that were
on the books before Mr. Abboud's group took over in April
1988. First City, which receives an incentive fee for selling
the assets, said gross collections were around $45 million in
the second quarter, less than half the $104 million collected
in the year-earlier period.</p>
<p>Mr. Abboud said collections slowed in part because buyers
are waiting to see whether sales by government regulators of
real estate seized along with failed thrifts will drive
prices lower. He said First City held some property off the
market to allow time for demand to rise again. "We will not
discount," he said.</p>
<p>But some analysts suggest a gloomier explanation: The
collecting bank may have already unloaded most of its
easy-to-sell assets, they say, and further sales might
require deeper price cuts. First City says it doesn't expect
that scenario to happen.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the Southwest, several other banks also
reported bad news during the second quarter. First Commerce
Corp., New Orleans, said it expects second-quarter earnings
to fall to between 35 cents and 40 cents a share from 58
cents a share last year.</p>
<p>First Commerce blamed the decline in part on a rise in
nonperforming assets caused by continued weakness in the New
Orleans and Alexandria, La., markets. The bank holding
company said it doubled its provision for loan losses for the
quarter to $12 million from $6 million in the comparable
period a year ago.</p>
<p>In Albuquerque, N.M., Sunwest Financial Services Inc. said
it recorded additions to loan-loss reserves and write-downs
totalling $7 million due to a regulatory exam in April. The
bank holding company said in May that it expected "additional
adjustments" due to the exam, as well. The problems "reflect
the continuation of the extremely weak real estate sector and
the slow-growing Albuquerque economy," the company said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Standard & Poor's Corp. recently lowered its
ratings on First Security Corp.'s senior debt to triple-B
from triple-B-plus, citing worries that the Salt Lake City
bank holding company has put creditors at greater risk by
warehousing problem credits at a nonbank subsidiary and using
debt to fund the unit.</p>
<p>"Although First Security's exposure to commercial real
estate and construction loans has decreased dramatically
since 1985, and little new business has been booked, problems
within the portfolio continue to arise," the rating agency
said.</p>
