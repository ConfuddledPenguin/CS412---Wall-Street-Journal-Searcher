	<p class="article-leader">MOSCOW -- The Soviet Communist Party appears set to emerge
from its landmark 28th Congress with a new lineup of leaders
who will wield a lot less power.
   As the congress enters its final week, delegates on both
left and right say Mikhail Gorbachev seems sure to weather
sharp criticism of his policies and be re-elected
general-secretary of the party. But the rest of the ruling
Politburo, which the congress will also elect, could be
completely overhauled, with a new generation of conservatives
rising to power.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>More than half of the current Politburo members, including
Mr. Gorbachev's closest allies, have signaled their intention
to give up their party posts. Senior officials say Mr.
Gorbachev is hoping to compensate for these potentially
damaging losses by stripping the Politburo of much of its
current political power.</p>
<p>According to Ivan Frolov, the editor of Pravda and a
Gorbachev confidant, moves are afoot to prevent members of
the recently created presidential council from serving on the
Politburo.</p>
<p>Such maneuvering fits with Mr. Gorbachev's overall plans
to transfer political power from the party to the government.
If he can win backing for a clear division between the
Politburo and the presidency, he could remove the party from
government decision-making. Among those serving on the
presidential council are Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze, Alexander Yakovlev, a Gorbachev confidant, and
the heads of the army and KGB.</p>
<p>Messrs. Shevardnadze and Yakovlev have already hinted they
will leave their party posts, but much hinges on the army and
KGB chiefs. Radicals are demanding an end to party control of
both, but conservatives reject such calls.</p>
<p>It remains uncertain whether Mr. Gorbachev will seek the
backing of the conservative-dominated congress for such a
move. Mr. Frolov, the Pravda editor, said he didn't expect
the division to be written into party rules, which are being
revised.</p>
<p>The expected election of a conservative-dominated
Politburo under Mr. Gorbachev's leadership is likely to cause
alarm among radicals grouped in the so-called Democratic
Platform, who are a distinct minority at the congress.
Liberals worry that Mr. Gorbachev might not be able to
contain the conservatives. A more conservative Central
Committee "will be able to grind the reforms of any leader,
to turn him into a figure who reigns but doesn't rule," wrote
delegate Pavel Voshanov in the daily Komosomolskaya Pravda.</p>
<p>But the radicals remain deeply divided about their
tactics. Some are calling for a walkout at the congress,
followed by the formal establishment of an alternative party.
But others argue that it is better to work for change from
within.</p>
<p>"We have a group of comrades who will stay regardless of
the outcome of the congress. They see their role as the
democratic balance in the party," says Vyacheslav
Shostakovsky, a founder of Democratic Platform who is also
rector of the Moscow Higher Party School.</p>
<p>Some now predict there won't be a formal split. "It's more
likely to be a big exodus of people who just turn in their
party cards," says Nikolai Seleznov, a Democratic Platform
member and congress delegate from Sverdlovsk. Yuri Prokofiev,
a moderate who heads the Moscow Communist Party organization,
has predicted that as many as one-third of the party's 19
million members could leave.</p>
<p>The party thus seems set to lose much of its clout and
many members, at the same time as it shifts to the right.
Such a scenario was outlined Friday by Boris Yeltsin, the
former radical Politburo member who was recently elected
president of the Russian Republic. In a calm speech, received
attentively but coolly by the congress, he warned the party
that it faced "historic defeat," unless it agreed to a
radical overhaul. "Those who think about other variants
should look at the fate of the Communist Parties in Eastern
Europe," he warned. "They were separated from the people . .
. and found themselves sidetracked."</p>
<p>One indication of how the congress delegates already seem
out of step with the feelings of ordinary Soviet citizens was
contained in an opinion poll published over the weekend in
Izvestia. It showed that when asked about the future of
agriculture, a key issue, a majority of congress delegates
thought that the present collective and state farms held the
best prospects for the future. In contrast, 80% of ordinary
people who were polled disagreed.</p>
<p>Such a division was also clear in a pair of meetings that
Mr. Gorbachev has held recently. Meeting with first
secretaries of city and regional party committees, a layer of
bureaucracy that is particularly resistant to change, Mr.
Gorbachev was sharply attacked for failing to listen to their
problems and defend their interests.</p>
<p>But the tone was completely different at a session with
lower-level party workers, those who organize party
activities in factories and institutions. Political analyst
Pavel Gutyonov wrote in Izvestia that support there is
greater for Mr. Gorbachev's policies than for the
middle-level officials' demands.</p>
<p>One miner and party organizer from Kuzbass complained that
his own region's first secretary was constantly using the
workers' movement "as his personal truncheon" in the battle
to retain conservative policies. "He isn't correct," the
miner said. "The president {Mr. Gorbachev} is closer to us
than the first secretary is."</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev remains determined to hold the party
together. On Saturday, he crushed an attempt by conservatives
to separately evaluate the personal performance of each
Politburo member. "I want to tell you something," Mr.
Gorbachev said, "If you want to split the party, if you want
to bury it, then you're going the right way about it."
Shortly afterward, the congress approved a counterproposal to
vote on the leadership as a whole.</p>
