	<p class="article-leader">I cannot agree with your argument for leniency toward John
Poindexter with regard to his lying to Congress
("Poindexter's Punishment," Review & Outlook, June 8). Your
example of Robert McNamara's lying to Congress about the deal
to remove missiles from Turkey does not vindicate the
practice of lying. In "Vietnam: A History," Stanley Karnow
reveals that Mr. McNamara also lied to Congress over American
involvement in the South Vietnamese naval operations that led
to the Gulf of Tonkin incident. This pattern of deceit by the
executive branch led to the passing of the War Powers
Resolution, the type of clumsy regulation that the Journal
frequently argues against.
   The best way to prevent this type of regulation is to
facilitate truthful communication to the public of executive
operations where propriety is in question. In this manner,
information can act as a catalyst for democracy to check
specific executive policies. This type of check is more
efficient than the long-term regulations resulting from
congressional dissatisfaction with duplicitous and deceitful
executive communications. Testimony before congressional
committees not only informs the committee members but also is
a process to mobilize the check of democracy.</p>

<p>---</p>
<p>Once again you mounted your bully pulpit to put forth
another Alice-in-Wall-Street-Land argument based on patently
absurd analogies.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the fact that the Iran-Contra affair and
the Cuban missile crisis are about as historically analogous
as the invasion of Grenada and the bombing of Hiroshima, you
have gone off the deep end in using such an analogy to
attempt to exonerate Mr. Poindexter for his management role
in a scheme in which millions of taxpayer dollars were
misdirected, and from which the profits are still missing.</p>
