	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A few fearless investors are venturing out
among the wreckage of the savings institutions.
   Nobody is predicting that investors will suddenly embrace
the savings industry as they did a year ago, when thrifts
were among the darlings of the over-the-counter market. But
there's hope for at least a handful of thrifts' shares,
market watchers say.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Investors are in no hurry to repeat the mistake of last
year, when they expected the thrift-bailout bill to cleanse
the scandal-ridden industry and groom it for acquisitions by
bank holding companies. Those hopes dimmed as problem real
estate loans multiplied and big banks' shares sagged,
diverting their attention from the acquisition field.</p>
<p>"A lot of people were burned, anticipating massive
acquisitions and takeover activity directly after the signing
of the bailout bill" last August, says E. Gareth Plank of San
Francisco, thrift analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds.</p>
<p>In fact, this year's first half brought a 12% decline in
the Nasdaq "other financial" index, which includes many small
savings-and-loans. (The year-ago half saw an increase of
about the same size.) As the thrifts sagged in the six months
through June, the broader Nasdaq Composite Index of OTC
stocks climbed 1.2% and the Nasdaq Industrial Index jumped
10.9%.</p>
<p>"There's nothing safe about {investing in thrifts} unless
you take a lot of time to differentiate among the few
companies that are survivors, the few companies that are
well-run and the few companies that have successfully
balanced risk and return," says Nick Adams, portfolio manager
of New York's $70 million First Financial Fund, which invests
largely in thrift issues.</p>
<p>Among 400 publicly traded thrifts, about half have met the
tough new minimum-capital and other requirements of the
government's thrift bailout legislation, says Allan G.
Bortel, a Sutro & Co. vice president and veteran thrift
industry analyst. Before recommending a stock, Mr. Bortel and
some other analysts apply higher standards than the
government does.</p>
<p>"An investor should first look at capital," advises Mr.
Bortel. "Everything else flows from that."</p>
<p>New federal regulations require thrifts to maintain 3% of
their total assets in "core capital," notably common
stockholders' equity. Mr. Bortel says he looks for savings
concerns with 4% to 6% of their total assets in core capital.
He also values management expertise, preferring 20 to 30
years of experience in the highly cyclical thrift industry,
and inside ownership of stock and stock options. And he keeps
an eye on expenses, preferring to see them held to 1% or 1.5%
of total assets for a traditional portfolio lender.</p>
<p>As a general rule of thumb, he says, a thrift with core
capital equaling 4% to 6% of total assets shouldn't have more
than 1.5% to 2% of total assets tied up in nonperforming
loans. Other factors to consider are the kinds of loans made
by a thrift (single-family loans are safest); whether a
portfolio is well-matched in terms of maturities of deposits
and loans; and whether spreads -- the gap between what a
thrift pays out on deposits and what it earns on loans -- are
expanding or shrinking.</p>
<p>Sound thrifts may prove to be more attractive takeover
candidates than the laggards seized and auctioned by the
federal government, says Dean Witter's Mr. Plank. Many
suitors are likely to have more appetite for healthy thrifts
than for the "freebies from the government," he says.</p>
<p>Investing in S&Ls as takeover possibilities is risky, Mr.
Plank says, as thrift mergers can easily unravel during the
lengthy regulatory reviews required. "You have to buy {thrift
stocks} based on fundamentals," he says. "If you can't buy
them on fundamentals, you have no business looking at them on
a takeover basis."</p>
<p>Among the various analysts' favorite thrifts are:</p>
<p>Bay View Capital of San Mateo, Calif. With a core capital
ratio of just under 6% at year's end and about 1% of its
total assets tied up in nonperforming loans, Bay View is
"quite a contrast to the horror stories you read about," says
Mr. Plank. Last October's San Francisco-area earthquake not
only rattled Bay View's headquarters but pummeled its stock,
Mr. Bortel notes. At 17 7/8, the stock is trading below book
value of about $26 a share and selling at less than six times
Mr. Plank's estimated 1990 earnings for the thrift of $3.50 a
share.</p>
<p>Washington Mutual Savings Bank in Seattle is benefiting
from the relatively strong economy and housing market in the
Pacific Northwest, says Mr. Plank. The thrift has a core
capital ratio of just under 6%. A rumored takeover candidate,
Washington is trading at a small premium. It was at 16 7/8
Friday, more than seven times Mr. Plank's estimated 1990
earnings of $2 to $2.30 a share.</p>
<p>JSB Financial, New York. The holding company for Jamaica
Savings Bank, JSB Financial recently converted to a federally
chartered stock savings bank from a mutual savings bank,
raising $160 million from the public, depositors and
employees. "People have gone crazy about the huge amount of
capital they're sitting on," says Mr. Bortel, noting that the
thrift has a core capital ratio of about 18%. Its
nonperforming loans are "virtually non-existent," at about
0.14% of total assets at the end of 1989.</p>
<p>America First Financial Fund 1987-A. A partnership that
went public in 1987, America First owns EurekaBank, of Foster
City, Calif., which it bought from the government. As of
March 31, its core capital was 6.5% of total assets. Mr.
Bortel calls its Northern California market an "excellent
franchise."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>Over-the-counter stocks managed to recover from Thursday's
loss in slow trading.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 1.35 to 460.54, a 0.3%
gain, as volume rose to more than 101 million shares from
97.8 million Thursday. Advancing issues outpaced decliners,
956-843.</p>
<p>St. Paul Bancorp dropped 1 1/2 to 9 5/8 after the Chicago
thrift reported a loss for the second quarter of $1.72 a
share. It had net income of 45 cents a share a year earlier.
The loss reflects a $30 million loan-loss provision,
including a $26 million addition to reserves at the thrift's
principal subsidiary, St. Paul Federal Bank for Savings,
directed by the Office of Thrift Supervision. Without that
reserve, St. Paul said second-quarter net would have been 43
cents a share.</p>
<p>Sun Sportswear fell 1 1/4 to 8 1/4 after the Kent, Wash.,
maker of casual sportswear said sales for the second quarter
were 12% below the year-earlier period, pushing net
"considerably below" a year earlier.</p>
<p>Mack Trucks surged 1 1/4 to 6 1/2 after France's Renault
said it will launch a $6-a-share bid Thursday for the 55% of
Mack that it doesn't already own. The French auto maker
currently owns about 44.5% of the Allentown, Pa., truck
manufacturer. Mack also said it expects to report a $130
million loss this year and may soon be in default of certain
provisions of its credit agreement with Citibank and Credit
Lyonnais.</p>
