	<p class="article-leader">MONTERREY, Mexico -- A wisp of cigar smoke, the calling
card of a foreign investment banker, hangs in the air of
Alfonso Romo's office.
   "Last year I was begging that banker to talk to me," Mr.
Romo, president of the conglomerate Grupo Pulsar S.A., says
of the dealmaker who has just walked out the door. "Now I'm
not only getting calls from him but from one or two new
bankers each week."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It's the same story nearby in the slick corporate offices
of Grupo Alfa S.A., Mexico's largest private company. "If we
had one banker every three months visiting us two years ago,
it's now one a week," says Peter Hutchison, senior vice
president for corporate finance. "They're smelling business."</p>
<p>With its recent decision to negotiate a free-trade
agreement with the U.S., Mexico has finally captured foreign
capitalists' attention, if not yet their investment. Mexican
businessmen say more foreign moneymen have been crawling
around the country in the past few weeks than at any time
since the lending frenzy that triggered the 1982 debt crisis.</p>
<p>In Monterrey, the center of Mexico's heavy industry and
home to its most internationally competitive companies,
foreign dealmakers are exploring joint ventures. In Mexico
City, the American Chamber of Commerce reports a 50% increase
in inquiries about investment. The Canadian Chamber of
Commerce, which shut down during the depths of Mexico's
recent economic crisis, reopened last month amid talk of a
free-trade zone extending from Quebec to Quintana Roo.</p>
<p>Even the Japanese, who had been bluntly critical of
Mexico's investment climate, are perking up. Kimihide
Takimura, chief of a Mitsui Group unit and the dean of
Japanese businessmen in Mexico, recently traveled to Toronto
to study details of the U.S.-Canadian free-trade pact. "We
have to learn the mechanics of these agreements and look at
Mexico more seriously now," he said.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Mexico, looking is about all investors
are doing at the moment. The burst of investor activity
hasn't been translated into a flurry of new projects or an
inflow of foreign capital.</p>
<p>But the interest excited by Mexico's free-trade gambit
contrasts sharply with the yawn that greeted its previous
efforts to lure foreign investors. Last year, President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari played two cards to attract foreign
investors: a modest liberalization of Mexico's nationalistic
investment law and a renegotiation of its foreign debt. But
the total value of new investment projects has hardly
changed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mexico's need for foreign exchange has only
grown more urgent. The pillars of Mexico's low-inflation
economic strategy -- a reduction of trade barriers and a
stable exchange rate -- have ignited a surge of imports.</p>
<p>This year, Mexico will post a deficit in the current
account, the broadest measure of trade, of around $5 billion.
In the short term, the government can cover such deficits
with the $8 billion to $10 billion it will earn -- much of it
in dollars -- through privatizations of the state telephone
monopoly, the commercial banks and a steel company. "The
privatizations have bought time through the end of 1991,"
says Salvador Kalifa, a leading Monterrey economic
consultant.</p>
<p>By then, Mexican officials hope to be well on their way
toward negotiating the free-trade agreement. The assured
access to the U.S. market, they predict, will bring in a
steady flow of foreign investment.</p>
<p>"My only doubt is the timing," says Lorenzo Zambrano,
director general of Cementos Mexicanos S.A., one of the
biggest cement makers in North America. "How quickly can
negotiations move? How soon will the investor interest we're
now seeing be translated into new projects?"</p>
<p>The pressure of time has some Monterrey businessmen
worried. They fret that the Mexican government's acute need
for foreign exchange will cause it to rush into an
unfavorable trade deal that will harm Mexican industry.</p>
<p>But most businessmen are upbeat. "So far the political
management has been brilliant, and one has to think President
Salinas has a few more cards up his sleeve," says Mr.
Zambrano. Three-quarters of Monterrey executives
participating in a recent newspaper poll thought a free-trade
pact would benefit Mexico.</p>
<p>Most industrialists here have their minds on the foreign
business partners who might arrive with free trade rather
than on the foreign competitors who also would enter Mexico.</p>
<p>"Traditionally it has been difficult to do joint ventures
with foreign companies in Mexico because there was no
certainty of access to the U.S. market," says Eugenio
Clariond, director general of Grupo IMSA S.A., a steel, auto
parts and construction company.</p>
<p>For instance, IMSA and a U.S. partner last year reached a
preliminary agreement to build what would have been the
largest auto battery factory in North America. They even
obtained an option on the land. But the project was scrubbed
after competing U.S. battery makers began lobbying to stop
preferential customs treatment of batteries imported from
Mexico. Mr. Clariond says a free-trade agreement would halt
such protectionist tactics; he says the number of inquiries
he has received about joint ventures has "skyrocketed" since
Mexico started preliminary negotiations.</p>
<p>The prospect of free trade is the most important reason
investors view Mexico differently, but it isn't the only one.
Only a few months ago, Alfa's Mr. Hutchison was concerned
about competition for funds from the newly liberalized
economies of Eastern Europe. But increasingly, investors he
talks with complain of the frustrations of doing business in
a region without a free-enterprise tradition. "Eastern
Europe's proving not to be the land of milk and honey, and
Mexico's looking like a safer bet," says Mr. Hutchison.</p>
<p>Finally, Mexico's attractiveness to investors has been
enhanced by its easing of anti-inflationary price controls
that have hamstrung many companies. Increasingly, the
government has relied on competition from imports to keep
prices in line, rather than on artificial controls.</p>
<p>Grupo Gamesa S.A., a big Monterrey food maker, says its
products now are underpriced by about 10%, compared with 20%
last year. "The increased flexibility on pricing makes it
easier for potential foreign partners to make clear financial
projections," says Alberto Santos, president of Gamesa. Mr.
Santos says it's no coincidence that he has received six
calls from foreign investment bankers in the past month, more
than he received in most years in the past decade.</p>
