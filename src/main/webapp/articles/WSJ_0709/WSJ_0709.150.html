	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Trickle-down from June's so-so jobs report
should damp industrial-output data and focus attention on the
next economic bugaboo: inflation.
   Economists surveyed after Friday's employment-report
release said they expect June industrial production, due out
next week,to fall far short of May's 0.6% gain. Meanwhile,
attention turns toward the June producer price index, which
is expected to show a slight increase. The PPI is due out
Friday along with June retail sales. This week's other major
indicator is May's consumer credit, due out today.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Much attention lately has focused on whether the Federal
Reserve will ease credit, giving the flagging 7 1/2-year-old
economic expansion a shot in the arm. Economists generally
viewed the June jobs data as inconclusive: soft, but not weak
enough to prod the Fed to lower interest rates.</p>
<p>Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns & Co.,
New York, said the next checkpoint for possible Fed action
may come with the June inflation figures.</p>
<p>"That's where the rubber could meet the road," he said.
Mr. Kudlow expects only a 0.1% increase in the June PPI after
May's 0.3% advance. And he envisions another tame inflation
reading from next week's June consumer price index. He holds
that lower inflation, against the backdrop of a slower
economy, could encourage the Fed to ease credit and help
stimulate the economy. "I think this economy is really on the
cusp of recession," he said.</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone agrees with Mr. Kudlow about
recession. David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities
International Inc., New York, said that the "best read on the
{jobs} number" is simply that it confirms "that the economy
isn't growing very much." The slowdown in manufacturing jobs
has been discernible for some time, he said. And the recent
slackening of job growth in the important services area
"doesn't seem to be causing widespread weakness in the
service sector as yet -- with the emphasis on yet," noted Mr.
Resler.</p>
<p>He expects industrial production to show a rise of 0.4%
for June, with half the gain coming from stronger mining and
utility production. The consensus view calls for only a 0.2%
increase in June output, according to MMS International, a
unit of McGraw-Hill Inc., New York. In May, industrial
production rose 0.6%. Capacity utilization is expected to
remain unchanged at 83.6%, according to the MMS survey.</p>
<p>The consensus view on the June PPI calls for a rise of
0.2%, down slightly from May's 0.3% advance. Consumer prices
are expected to show a rise of 0.3% for June, up slightly
from May's 0.2% increase.</p>
<p>Economists said producer prices should benefit from
another drop in energy prices, helping to offset upward
pressure from capital-goods prices. Higher tobacco prices are
expected to tug upward on the index.</p>
<p>Donald Fine, economist at Chase Manhattan Bank, New York,
believes "the threat of a recession right now is fairly
small," although he noted there aren't any great signs of
vigor, either. "The economy is sort of bopping along at a
1.5% growth rate and that, in the long run, will help
moderate inflation," Mr. Fine said. He expects both the June
PPI and CPI to increase 0.3%.</p>
<p>A rebound in auto sales in June is thought to have helped
retail sales move into the plus column after two months of
fairly steep declines. The consensus view calls for a 0.6%
gain in retail sales, according to MMS. Excluding auto sales,
that gain narrows to 0.3%, it said.</p>
<p>In May, sluggish auto sales, along with subdued
general-merchandise buying, are thought to have contributed
to another sluggish consumer-credit report. In April,
consumer credit expanded $600 million.</p>
