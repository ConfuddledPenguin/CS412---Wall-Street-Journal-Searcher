	<p class="article-leader">Finnish economists and trade officials are scrambling to
sort out consequences of a threatened end to the country's
unique system of trade with the Soviet Union.
   As recently as last October, the Soviet Union and Finland
signed a pact extending their 40-year-old bilateral trade
system to 1995. Under the trade plan, Finland pays for oil
and gas purchased from the Soviet Union with exports of
industrial goods and ships, plus certain consumer and food
products.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Frequent snags have tarnished the system in recent years.
Finnish exports have plunged along with world crude-oil
prices. And with economic turmoil sweeping the Soviet Union,
many analysts warned the latest extension of the trade pact
might be the last.</p>
<p>Still, it came as a surprise last month when the Soviets
told Finnish Premier Harri Holkeri they wanted to scrap the
bilateral trade system prematurely -- possibly by the end of
this year. Flustered Finnish politicians conceded that
abolishing the sheltered barter trade likely would be a
healthy step for both sides -- at least in the long run.</p>
<p>But in the short term, the possible loss of the trade
agreement looms as an untimely blow to Finland's shaky
economy, some economists warn. The Soviet Union still
accounts for about 17% of Finnish exports. And because orders
received under the bilateral trade accord aren't subject to
competitive bidding, they normally carry hefty profit margins
for Finnish companies, these economists add.</p>
<p>"It's impossible to say much of Finland's Soviet trade
would disappear along with the bilateral system," says Veijo
Manninen, an economist for Union Bank of Finland in Helsinki.
"But there definitely will be problems if the transition
period is only a few months," he cautions.</p>
<p>Jerry Raybould, chief equity trader for Kansallis Osake
Pankki, another big Helsinki bank, cites potential erosion of
Finland's trade with the Soviet Union as a prime reason for
the Helsinki stock market's lackluster performance so far
this year.</p>
<p>The announcement by the Soviets confirms fears that
Finland will "lose ground because it doesn't have the kind of
money to throw at the Soviet Union that bigger European and
North American nations do," Mr. Raybould said.</p>
<p>It still isn't clear how much of the bilateral trade
system is likely to be dismantled. "The Soviets have proposed
leaving the bilateral trade and payments system and instead
going over to a multilateral system using convertible
currencies," says Kari Holopainen, head of the bilateral
trade office at Finland's central bank.</p>
<p>Such a move would be in line with proposed economic
reforms in the Soviet Union -- in particular, "changes they
plan in decision-making procedures for foreign trade," Mr.
Holopainen says.</p>
<p>The effects of a trade pact collapse could be severe in
industries ranging from apparel and shipbuilding, which rely
heavily on exports to the East bloc, to energy.</p>
<p>Soviet purchases of Finnish clothing, shoes and textiles
have plunged in recent years as overall volume of bilateral
trade dwindled. But Eastern bloc markets still account for
almost 25% of the Finnish textile industry's output. "If the
(trade) system is abandoned, textiles will be hit hard --
they have practically no price competitiveness compared to
manufacturers in Southern Europe or the Far East," said
Markku Lammi, a foreign trade specialist for the Research
Institute of the Finnish Economy, a Helsinki think tank.</p>
<p>The demise of Soviet barter trade could open Finland's
tightly controlled petroleum market, industry analysts say.
Finland imports virtually all its supplies of crude oil and
natural gas from the Soviet Union. For years, Western oil
companies have struggled against a host of curbs -- from
price controls to a ban on importing their own crude or
refined oil products for sale in Finland. The Finnish
government forced most foreign companies (except
state-controlled Soviet oil concern Teboil Oy) to buy refined
products from Finland's state oil concern Neste Oy.</p>
<p>Finland long claimed the closed market policy was
necessary to prevent disturbances in the politically
sensitive bilateral trade program.</p>
<p>As the volume of bilateral trade with the Soviet Union
declined steadily in recent years, some Finnish companies
moved outside the system and stepped up export sales settled
through payment in convertible currencies. Last year, exports
paid in convertible currencies accounted for about 14% of
Finland's 14.5 billion markka ($3.7 billion) exports to the
Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Finland's big forestry-products industry has aggressively
expanded the share of exports settled in convertible
currencies. Industry officials estimate that roughly
one-third of last year's three billion markka shipments to
the Soviets were outside the barter trade system.</p>
<p>But convertible-currency transactions also expose
companies to increased financial risks. Under the barter
trade system, Finnish exporters receive payment directly from
Finland's central bank, which thus assumes credit risks
toward Soviet customers.</p>
<p>Last week Finnpap, the Finnish forest-products industry's
national marketing organization, threatened to halt further
deliveries of paper products to the Soviet Union until
overdue bills are paid. A senior Finnpap official said nearly
100 million markka in bills remains unpaid. On Thursday, the
Soviets began paying the paper exporters and Finnpap said it
wouldn't halt deliveries.</p>
<p>But citing such payment difficulties, Mr. Lammi, the
Helsinki economist, has trimmed his earlier estimate that
increasingly frequent hard-currency transactions would lead
to a rise in total Finnish exports this year. "We're much
more pessimistic now because Finnish firms have to worry so
much about when -- or if -- they'll get paid," Mr. Lammi
says.</p>
<p>But greater uncertainty is something Finnish companies are
going to have to learn to live with, according to Mr.
Holopainen, the central bank official. "The traditional
five-year bilateral trade agreements gave an indication about
what the Soviet market would be years in advance -- a sort of
guarantee in practice," he adds.</p>
<p>"In the future, Finnish companies will obviously try to
export as much as they can," Mr. Holopainen says. "But it's
difficult to foresee what will happen."</p>
