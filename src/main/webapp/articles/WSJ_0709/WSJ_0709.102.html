	<h3>Heard on the Street: Carrington Labs May Have Overstated Case For Experimental AIDS and Cancer Drug</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- How can investors appraise the merits of a
company whose future rides on developing an experimental and
technologically sophisticated product?
   Often, it's impossible to predict how the product will
fare. In such cases, investors should pay particular
attention to the quality of the company's disclosures.
Consider the case of tiny Carrington Laboratories.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Irving, Texas, company has $8 million in sales, $7
million in net worth, and no earnings. Yet its stock is
valued at $125 million -- largely because Carrington is
touting the potential of a drug it produces from an extract
of aloe vera.</p>
<p>On a radio broadcast in February, a Carrington official
spoke of improvements by acquired-immune-deficiency-syndrome
and cancer patients who had received either the drug or juice
from the aloe plant itself. Carrington also says its drug
might be useful in treating scores of other ailments.</p>
<p>And at a recent AIDS conference in San Francisco,
Carrington said its drug "significantly improved the
effectiveness of AZT in a six-month clinical trial of 47
patients infected with the AIDS virus." AZT, marketed by
British-based Wellcome, is the only drug approved for
treating AIDS.</p>
<p>Carrington, in a news release, went on to say that based
on the results of the trial, conducted in Belgium,
"researchers" have recommended a larger study and that
Carrington "plans to market {its drug}, when approved, under
the trade name Carrisyn."</p>
<p>This is news to quicken one's pulse. However, for some
years, Carrington has been saying that the Belgian trial
would test whether Carrisyn would, by itself, be effective in
treating AIDS, and whether it would enhance AZT's
performance.</p>
<p>Nathan Clumeck, head of infectious diseases at St. Pierre
University Hospital in Brussels, performed the trial. He says
the trial -- by no means conclusive -- didn't show any
benefit from using Carrisyn alone, or that Carrisyn is an
anti-viral agent.</p>
<p>Carrington's news release didn't refer to results of
testing Carrisyn on its own. Also, of the 47 patients
referred to in the release, the "significant" result is based
on only 18 patients. The others either dropped out during the
trials or were participating in the trial of Carrisyn on its
own. (This was disclosed by Dr. Clumeck in a technical
abstract in San Francisco.)</p>
<p>Carrington denies that its new release is incomplete.
Clinton Howard, Carrington's president and largest
stockholder, says, "It doesn't matter" how many people
participate in the trial "as long as you achieve statistical
significance." But experts put great emphasis on the size of
such trials. Dr. Clumeck says, "This compound could act as an
immunal stimulant in patients who receive AZT. {But} this was
a small number of patients. It was a very preliminary study."</p>
<p>Carrington says it didn't disclose the result of testing
Carrisyn on its own because the test was "inconclusive."
Nonetheless, William McAnalley, Carrington's chief of
research, says, "Its more significant {AIDS} use will be in
conjunction with AZT."</p>
<p>If so, Carrisyn's uniqueness is far from clear. Joyce
Thomson, a spokeswoman for Wellcome in London, says that
according to company scientists, "there are tens and tens of
potential products, some of which are being tested with AZT
and some of which have shown some promising results."
Wellcome has contacted the makers of some of these other
drugs, though not, as far as she knows, of Carrisyn.</p>
<p>Carrington also didn't disclose that, after a 30-minute
presentation by the company in May to the National Institute
for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the latter decided
against recommending federal funds for clinical trials of
Carrisyn. Carrington says not all its results from the
Belgian trial were available in May.</p>
<p>"There is a real story here," Mr. Howard says. "For five
years a group of short-sellers have been saying that Carrisyn
was just a hoax. Now a world-class scientist has done a very
well-controlled study showing it is effective." Indeed,
though it has yet to seek approval from the Food and Drug
Administration, Mr. McAnalley says "There is no question in
my mind we will get approval to sell it." An FDA spokesman
says, "That's their opinion."</p>
<p>In general, officials of Carrington, which relies on
periodic stock sales to fund operations, describe their drug
more or less as a front-runner in the AIDS battle. One says
that, compared with other drugs, Carrisyn is "overwhelmingly
significant."</p>
<p>But the clear impression from scientists, drug industry
executives and the alternative AIDS research community is
that aloe vera -- long used for healing wounds -- is one of a
large number of "maybes" in the AIDS battle. John James,
editor of Aids Treatment News in San Francisco, says "I've
been aware of it for years. I knew several people using it,
but right now there is less interest in it."</p>
