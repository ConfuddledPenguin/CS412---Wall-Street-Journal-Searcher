	<p class="article-leader">We have become a nation of education assessors, test
givers, chart makers, speech givers, strategists and
consultants. But after all the reform-movement rhetoric since
the early 1980s, after all the blue-ribbon conferences,
reports, conventions, articles and books on how to reform
education, we find that students haven't made any significant
gains in their reading and writing and thinking abilities.
   According to the National Assessment of Educational
Progress, "Levels of writing performance in 1988 appeared to
be substantially the same as in 1974. Many students continued
to perform at minimal levels on the writing assessment tasks,
and relatively few performed at adequate or better levels."
NAEP added that while "the overwhelming majority of young
adults adequately perform reading tasks at the lower levels,
sizable numbers appear unable to do well on tasks of moderate
complexity, and only a relatively small percentage of this
group is estimated to perform at levels typified by the more
complex and challenging tasks."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>NAEP went on to say that "it is clear that there is no
single step or simple action, which if taken, will allow all
individuals to become fully literate. Becoming fully literate
in our society is a lifelong pursuit affected by such factors
as home environment, economic situation, aspirations,
opportunities, and education. As a result, we must recognize
the intergenerational effects on literacy."</p>
<p>But there is a simple step, there is a single action that
will have the most significant effect on a child's literacy
-- on his or her whole being -- and that step is to make the
reading of real literature on an everyday basis the principle
upon which the foundations of our education reform movement
rest. It is time to step away from stultifying readers and
textbooks, work sheets and drills.</p>
<p>The very best curriculum for our schools can be found in
the best bookstores, not in the corporate-developed,
committee-written textbook series that cost millions of
dollars and take several years to produce. Have you ever
caught a child secretly reading a textbook under the bed
covers with a flashlight?</p>
<p>Children reading "My Father's Dragon" on their own in the
first grade or "James and the Giant Peach" on their own in
the third grade are the secret to education reform. Children
reading and understanding "Anne of Green Gables" on their own
in the sixth grade will reduce dropout rates. Children
reading and understanding "To Kill a Mockingbird" and "Iron
and Silk" in the ninth grade are the answer to poor SAT
scores. Teen-agers reading and understanding "A Tale of Two
Cities," "Death of Ivan Illyich" and "One Hundred Years of
Solitude" will make poor writing skills a thing of the past.</p>
<p>For the past 14 years, I have made an observation about my
own high school students: The very best are those students
who came from strong homes and read many, many real books on
their own.</p>
<p>The average students came from strong homes, but depended
exclusively on schools and mind-numbing textbooks for their
"education," which meant that the students were taught to
read, but they didn't.</p>
<p>The weakest students came from weak homes and depended
exclusively on textbook reading programs for their
"education."</p>
<p>There are many reading programs in this country utilizing
real books as the core of the curriculum, such as the Ohio
Reading Recovery program, the Open Sesame program in some New
York City schools, and the California Reading Initiative. The
results prove again and again that if you give a child a rich
and varied reading experience, that child will succeed in
school.</p>
<p>But these programs do not add up to a thousand points of
light. Most schools are still teaching children with one
dreary fill-in-the-blank work sheet after another. Most
schools have not given children a reading habit, a writing
ability or a thinking power.</p>
<p>In a survey sponsored by Pizza Hut last fall, the nation's
governors listed their favorite children's books. Robert
Casey of Pennsylvania cited "The Red Badge of Courage." Mike
Sullivan of Wyoming remembered Dr. Seuss and "Winnie the
Pooh." Robert Martinez of Florida listed "Lassie Come Home."
Mario Cuomo of New York enjoyed "The Swiss Family Robinson"
and William Donald Schaefer of Maryland mentioned "The Tale
of Peter Rabbit." The list went on and on.</p>
<p>Will our governors work to bring class sets of books like
these into the hands and hearts of all children in America?
If we continue to place any other priority at the very center
of our education reform movement, we will simply continue to
fail.</p>
