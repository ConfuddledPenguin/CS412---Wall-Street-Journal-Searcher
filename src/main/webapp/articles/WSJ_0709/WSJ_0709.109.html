	<p class="article-leader">Peoples Bancorp of Worcester Inc., a bank holding company,
said it agreed to acquire about $300 million in insured
deposits of Milford, Mass.-based Milford Savings Bank from
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   Milford Savings was declared insolvent and closed by the
Massachusetts banking commissioner on Friday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the agreement, Peoples Bancorp, based in Worcester,
Mass., will assume Milford Savings' total deposit liability
of about $300 million from the FDIC for a premium of
$100,000. Peoples Bancorp also will have the option, for 90
days, to buy certain loans after reviewing Milford's loan
portfolio. Peoples Bancorp said the five Milford Savings
offices will reopen as Peoples Bancorp branches today.</p>
<p>The Milford acquisition is Peoples Bancorp's second
regulatory-assisted acquisition of a failed Massachusetts
bank. In April 1989, the company assumed certain assets and
the deposits of Leominster, Mass.-based First Service Bank
for Savings, which was closed by the state banking
commissioner in March 1989.</p>
