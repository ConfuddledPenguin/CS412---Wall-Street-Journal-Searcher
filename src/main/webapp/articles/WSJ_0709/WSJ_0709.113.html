	<p class="article-leader">Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd. said it made further changes in
an agreement to sell its Australian breweries to associate
company Bell Resources Ltd.
   Australia-based Bond Corp. has extended a deadline for
completing the sale of the Australian breweries to July 31
from June 30.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Bond Corp. said in March that it intended to sell the
Australian breweries to 58%-owned Bell Resources for 1.85
billion Australian dollars (US$1.48 billion), as part of a
program to reduce debt by selling assets. Bond Corp. owes
Bell Resources about A$1 billion, which has been turned into
a deposit for the breweries.</p>
<p>However, Bond Corp. said in a statement late Friday that
if the sale isn't completed by July 31 it will be required to
repay the deposit on Aug. 17.</p>
<p>Terms of the purchase price also have been altered, Bond
Corp. said, to include certain brand names in Britain.</p>
<p>Bond Corp. also said it has altered terms of a previously
announced agreement to sell some of its stake in Bond Media
Ltd. to Bell Resources.</p>
