	<p class="article-leader">FIRST, A LITTLE back-patting all around seems in order.
   As they gather today in Houston for the 16th annual
economic summit, the seven leaders of the capitalist world
can be forgiven for feeling smug. With the astonishing
collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, their former foes
have practically overnight become converts to free markets --
devouring tracts by Adam Smith and clamoring for membership
in major capitalist economic clubs like the World Bank.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>And why not? While Communist economies have simply fallen
apart, the free-world economy dominated by the Seven -- the
U.S., Japan, Britain, France, Italy, Canada and West Germany
-- has shown both durability and flexibility. It has
continued to chug along, posting reasonable growth, averting
inflation for the most part, and overcoming nasty
stock-market nose dives in the U.S. and Japan. So break out
the champagne.</p>
<p>But now comes the hard part.</p>
<p>The very victory of free-market forces has made this
economic-summit agenda one of the most challenging and
complex ones ever. Once the Seven needed to tend mainly to
their own knitting. Now they must find ways to finance
reconstruction of the failed "command economies" of the old
East Bloc.</p>
<p>They also must discuss the massive changes in East-West
relations that are taking place, and when -- and on what
terms -- they will help the ailing Soviet Union. West Germany
and France are more eager to support the $20 billion Western
lifeline that Moscow is seeking. But the U.S.-backed by
Japan, Britain and Canada -- wants to wait for more political
and economic reform in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The Seven also must nurture the birth of the new unified
Germany without unleashing inflation. The U.S. and Japan also
will want to show their summit partners that they have
successfully negotiated differences over their economic
relationship in their yearlong dialogue -- the so-called
Structural Impediments Initiative. And, perhaps above all,
the Seven must ready their nations for a new world in which
trade will define relationships between nations more than
adversarial superpower politics will.</p>
<p>Specifically and immediately, this means agreeing on the
importance of current GATT talks and ensuring that they
succeed, at least to the extent that the seven most powerful
economies in the free world can make that happen. GATT (the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the world's most
comprehensive trade organization) could use a kick in the
pants.</p>
<p>Its current talks, the so-called Uruguay Round, are
supposed to be completed in December but are proceeding at a
stately pace -- too stately, according to many. "The
potential gains from a good {GATT} agreement are extremely
high, but the sense we get is that this is an agreement that
is behind schedule," says David Germany, an economist at
Morgan Stanley & Co.</p>
<p>In previous rounds of talks, GATT has dealt generally with
tariffs on manufactured goods. In the current round, the
negotiators of 97 nations are attempting a vast expansion of
the treaty to cover the one-third of world trade, about $1
trillion, that is outside the agreement now.</p>
<p>This round is expected to cover no fewer than 15 different
trade segments, including completely new ones such as
intellectual property (software, for example), services,
finance and investments, textiles, and agricultural products.
At the same time, the negotiators will be trying to toughen
disciplinary measures so that violating the rules will be far
costlier. This, advocates say, is needed to reverse a
continuing backward drift toward protectionism and to end the
need for unilateral trade legislation.</p>
<p>The wide scope of the current talks and the touchy nature
of some of the issues only compound another chronic problem
-- the tendency of negotiators at meetings such as GATT to go
on talking in circles until their political masters tell them
it's time to fish or cut bait. The Houston summiteers won't
be dealing in details of the treaty, but the U.S., for one,
is expected to demand that the summit participants commit
themselves as a body to giving their minions at GATT that
needed kick in the pants.</p>
<p>"We'll insist very strongly that the importance of this
trade negotiation be recognized and it be given impetus from
the highest levels, " says David Mulford, the U.S. Treasury
undersecretary for international affairs. That's as it should
be, says Allan Meltzer, an economist at Pittsburgh's Carnegie
Mellon University. "The biggest stimulus to world growth of
the past 40 years has been trade," he says, noting that
prosperity from commerce also tends to consolidate democratic
movements.</p>
<p>So the desired goal is to get from the summit an
unequivocal commitment to the success of the GATT talks
(meaning an agreement that covers the maximum amount of
trade) and to their completion on time, come hell or high
water.</p>
<p>Getting such firm backing will be harder than it might
seem, for everyone at the summit table will have constituents
to protect. European nations and the U.S., for example, still
shield their textile industries against developing nations,
which are pressing to have trade barriers lowered so that
their advantages in labor costs can come into play.</p>
<p>Agriculture is even more sensitive. The Houston summit may
be the last chance for Europe and the U.S. to resolve their
considerable differences over farm commodities. These
agricultural commodities are still heavily subsidized by
Western European powers and the U.S. But the Europeans have
so far been reluctant to cut or abandon export subsidies in
particular and thus expose their farmers to greater
free-market pressures.</p>
<p>If the Europeans don't endorse a GATT agreement that would
include freer trade in commodities and many other products,
the fortunes of the East Bloc countries will be hurt. Their
struggling new governments desperately need open markets if
they are to earn the hard currency required to climb out of
the hole they've dug themselves into over the past 45 years,
and agricultural exports in particular would help a lot.</p>
<p>The entire spectrum of East Bloc problems will consume a
lot of discussion time at the summit. How to clean up a
degraded environment -- and how to pay for it -- is one of
the biggest individual issues.</p>
<p>Under a Communist rule that emphasized production above
all, much of the region has become an environmental sinkhole.
Lacking control devices, its power plants and factories belch
poisonous fumes and particulates into the atmosphere, and its
water supplies are degraded. Poland is a mess, and East
Germany, with 17 million people, produces more acid rain than
West Germany, which has 60 million. In the Soviet Union, the
population is just starting to learn of and respond to the
enormous consequences of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster of
four years ago.</p>
<p>Initiatives addressing a reeling Soviet economy will
certainly be raised, and not just for the sake of the Soviets
themselves. Because of Eastern European dependence on Soviet
energy and markets, "Soviet economic collapse presents the
greatest threat to the new democracies of Eastern Europe and
could even derail their progress toward democratic
market-based economies," says Robert Hormats, vice chairman
of Goldman Sachs International and a member of the U.S.
delegation at eight consecutive economic summits during the
Carter and Reagan administrations.</p>
<p>In another initiative, the U.S. is certain to press for a
wider and deeper level of cooperation in battling the drug
scourge. It will probably want greater commitment to
international campaigns against drug traffic, particularly
efforts to hunt down money-launderers.</p>
<p>On top of all this, the Seven will have the usual -- and
vitally important -- task of ensuring that their own economic
machinery, which dominates the world economy, continues to
run smoothly. The current economic expansion, mature and
somewhat sluggish after eight years, shows no sign of ending
imminently. But it has slowed down; growth is expected to be
only 2% to 3% this year.</p>
<p>As always, the summit participants will have to steer
between the twin threats of inflation and recession. The
former has been a greater concern lately; a combination of
stronger inflationary pressures and greater competition for
capital has led the major central banks to tighten their
monetary policies in recent months. The ensuing higher
interest rates have crimped growth projections, causing some
economists to shave their estimates for expansion this year.</p>
<p>But the summiteers will probably be reluctant to loosen
the reins; continuing vigilance will be needed because the
economic integration of the two Germanys has the potential
for increasing inflation. So interest rates are expected to
remain fairly high.</p>
<p>Instead, the participants may seek to revitalize the world
economy by calling for higher rates of savings and
investment. And Japan and the European allies will probably
pressure the U.S. to reduce its budget deficit.</p>
<p>They'll be preaching to the converted. "A budget deal is
essential for continued strong growth," says economist John
Taylor, a member of President Bush's Council of Economic
Advisers. To get the nation's long-term savings rate up, he
adds, reduction of the deficit is essential.</p>
<p>The Seven will probably not need to take any sweeping,
sudden steps to reduce trade imbalances, though fine-tuning
will probably be discussed. These imbalances, though
persistent, have remained under control, and there is no
strong evidence that they will suddenly and significantly
worsen.</p>
<p>So far, the surge of the dollar against the yen hasn't
aggravated the trade imbalance between Japan and the U.S.,
and the two nations have recently agreed on steps to whittle
it down. The projected revival of Eastern Europe and the
economic integration of Western Europe in 1992 are expected
not only to increase growth but also to slim down Germany's
big trade surplus.</p>
<p>The economic integration of the two Germanys will
certainly be discussed, including the likely effects of its
currency union, which officially took effect last week.
Germany (shedding the "West") has a lot on its plate. "Much
of our capacities will be devoted to developments east of the
Elbe," says Stefan Auwaerter, international economist at
Deutsche Bank AG in Frankfurt. He says that his country's
primary goal will be to ensure that "the transformation to a
market economy proceeds without too much shake-up" in the
form of unemployment or excessive emigration from the East.</p>
<p>Don't expect, however, any summit agreement on another
much-touted step toward economic integration -- a single
European currency. "It's something of a pipe dream," says Tim
Congdon, economist at the London bond firm of Gerrard &
National PLC. Unifying German currencies is one thing. Trying
to convert the long-term debt markets of several major
currencies into a new Euromoney is another thing entirely, he
believes.</p>
<p>"The United States of Europe will be a long time coming,"
he adds, "and certainly in the British case we don't want to
be a member of the United States of Europe."</p>
