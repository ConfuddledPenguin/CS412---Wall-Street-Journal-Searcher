	<p class="article-leader">Ingersoll-Rand Co., Woodcliff Lake, N.J., is considering
the possible sale of its Schlage Electronics Inc. unit, a
maker of security systems.
   A spokesman for Ingersoll-Rand, which also makes products
including equipment for road construction and well and rock
drilling, was unable to provide annual sales for Schlage,
Santa Clara, Calif.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company retained Merrill Lynch Capital Markets to
evaluate alternatives for Schlage. Ingersoll-Rand's spokesman
couldn't say why Ingersoll-Rand took that step for the
security-systems unit, which is profitable. But he did say
the business is a smaller part of the locks unit of the
parent's bearings, locks and tools segment. Schlage has 300
employees. The parent had 31,600 employees at the end of
1989.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
Ingersoll-Rand shares closed at $58.125, up 37.5 cents.</p>
