	<p class="article-leader">It seems to me that for several years a large number of
economists were nagging the president about the need to
reduce the budget deficit and to raise taxes for that
purpose. Now President Bush has relaxed his objection to a
tax increase. And all of a sudden economists are being quoted
in the papers warning that the tax increase would cause a
recession.
   These warnings are issued in the sacred name of John
Maynard Keynes. For example, an article in the New York Times
(June 28) contains this statement: "Keynesian theory, still a
mainstay among Western economists, holds that . . ."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A few anecdotes from a long life with such talk may
indicate how many grains of salt need to be taken with it.</p>
<p>Almost 55 years ago, when I was in Jacob Viner's economics
class at the University of Chicago, a student had the
termerity to stand up and say, "The consensus of economists
is . . ." The professor glared at him and asked, "When did
you take the census?"</p>
<p>Lesson: Be careful of judging what is the opinion of
"economists."</p>
<p>About 40 years ago there was a big dispute in this country
about the Federal Reserve's policy of supporting the price of
government bonds. The name of Keynes was entered into this
dispute, and I wrote an op-ed piece for the Washington Post
about what Keynes (who had died in 1946) would have said. On
the morning when my article appeared, I received a call from
a man with a cultivated British accent who identified himself
as Geoffrey Keynes, the economist's brother, and who said
that I was exactly right about what J.M. would have thought.
I was in Seventh Heaven, until the caller dropped the accent
and revealed himself as a young economist friend who was just
pulling my leg.</p>
<p>Lesson: Be careful of judging what Keynes would have said
in circumstances that he did not confront.</p>
<p>At the end of 1965, Time magazine celebrated the successes
of Keynesian economics with a long story and Keynes's picture
on the cover. The article quoted Milton Friedman as saying,
"We are all Keynesians now." This surprised me until I read
in Time's letters column next week a complaint from Prof.
Friedman that the magazine had failed to quote the rest of
his sentence, which was ". . . and there are no longer any
Keynesians."</p>
<p>Two lessons: Be careful in reading journalistic reporting
of what an economist thinks, because essential points may be
lost in transmission, and be careful in judging the state of
Keynesianism in the economics profession.</p>
<p>In 1971, after submitting a budget in which he said that
it was his policy to balance the budget at high employment,
President Nixon said to a reporter, "Now I am a Keynesian."
(He is almost always misquoted as saying that we are all
Keynesians now, which was actually Time's misquotation of Mr.
Friedman.) As a member of the Council of Economic Advisers at
that time I had the job of drafting soothing letters to irate
Republicans, in which I explained that he did not mean
permanent deficits, or fine-tuning or free love, but only to
continue a stable policy through the fluctuations of the
economy.</p>
<p>Lesson: The Keynesianism of presidents, like their other
"isms," is of a limited and expedient kind.</p>
<p>Having said all that, I can hardly now say what
"economists" or "economics" tell us about a possible tax
increase and deficit-reducing package in the current
situation. But I can say something about what the current
situation is and about what I would distill from the present
muddy state of economics.</p>
<p>Back in 1985, when the federal budget deficit was 5.4% of
the gross national product, Congress passed the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, which required reduction of the
deficit in six annual steps to zero in 1991. On the average,
that meant reducing the deficit as a percentage of GNP by
0.9% a year. In response to the fear that this path of
deficit reduction might in some circumstances worsen a
decline of the economy, the act provided for deviation from
the path in the event of an actual or officially forecast
recession.</p>
<p>After G-R-H was passed, the budget deficit declined from
about $200 billion in fiscal 1984-86 to about $150 billion in
fiscal 1987-89, and from about 5% of GNP to about 3% of GNP.
But it seemed to be stuck at the $150 billion and 3% level.</p>
<p>In January of this year, President Bush submitted a budget
that had a deficit of $124 billion for fiscal 1990 and $64
billion for fiscal 1991, or 2.3% and 1.1% of GNP,
respectively. (These, and subsequent figures, exclude the
costs of the S&L bailout.) Now it appears that the deficit
for the current fiscal year, 1990, will be about $155
billion, or about 2.8% of GNP again, and that without a
deficit-reducing package the fiscal 1991 deficit might be
$160 billion, or about 2.7% of GNP. A deficit-reducing
package of $50 billion, which I understand is what is being
considered, would reduce the 1991 deficit to about $110
billion, or about 1.9% of GNP. This is a smaller reduction of
the deficit between 1990 and 1991, both absolutely and as a
percentage of GNP, than was proposed in the January budget.</p>
<p>Real GNP in the past year has increased by about 2%. In
the first quarter of 1990 it increased at an annual rate of
1.9%. The rate of unemployment has been stable at about 5.3%
for a year and a half. In January, when the budget was
submitted, the Blue Chip consensus of economists (there are
some things on which we do take a census) was that the GNP
would rise by 1.7% in 1990 and 2.2% in 1991. In June the
consensus was that the GNP would rise by 1.9% in 1990 and
2.3% in 1991. In short, the U.S. is not in a recession, a
recession cannot be confidently forecast, and the outlook for
the economy is no more worrisome than it was six months ago
when a budget was submitted that called for even more of a
deficit reduction than is now being contemplated.</p>
<p>So the question now is whether a deficit reduction equal
to about 1% of GNP can be safely absorbed by an economy that
is not in recession and that has available to it a
complementary monetary policy to increase the supply of money
if the reduction of the deficit should reduce interest rates
and lead to an increased demand for money. There are versions
of Keynesianism in which the answer to that is "no."</p>
<p>It might be held that the American economy cannot reach
high employment without a federal deficit equal to, say, 3%
of GNP. It might be held that, whatever the starting point, a
budget deficit can never be reduced without depressing the
economy. But these are extreme views of Keynesian doctrine.
They are as extreme as would be the opposite view that
reduction of a budget deficit no matter how large can have no
effect on the macroeconomy even in the absence of supportive
monetary policy.</p>
<p>Reducing the budget deficit is a two-sided transaction.
Cutting expenditures and raising taxes, by themselves, have a
negative effect on demand and output, which is what
Keynesians worry about. But on the other side of the
transaction, reducing the government's borrowing requirement
will reduce interest rates, stimulating investment; raise the
value of assets, like stocks and bonds, stimulating
consumption; and reduce the dollar exchange rate, stimulating
exports. It is this side of the transaction that the
administration apparently counts on.</p>
<p>In my opinion the net of this, in either direction, is
likely to be small, partly because the deficit reduction is
small and partly because we have a monetary policy that aims
to stabilize the economy and contain shocks arising from the
budget or elsewhere. Others may think the risks greater than
I do. But even so there is no realistic ground for sounding a
Keynesian alarm if the government now takes moderate steps to
get on to the deficit-reducing path that it has been seeking,
unsuccessfully, for the past five years.</p>
