	<p class="article-leader">FRANKFURT -- After two decades of grooming, Germany is
ready to take a leading role on the world economic stage.
   The question now is how Bonn will play this role. Will it
act as Germania Rex, the haughty leading man who hogs the
spotlight and steals the scenes? Or will it become more of an
ensemble player, a willing partner of and respected spokesman
for a more unified European Community?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The answer appears to be that Germany will focus on German
problems. At least for a time, the risky merger between the
East and West German economies, put into effect last week,
will dominate Bonn's fiscal and monetary priorities.</p>
<p>Chancellor Helmut Kohl is issuing assurances that Germany
can deal with the jolting union between a thriving
free-market economy and a socialist economy. But Mr. Kohl
also has his heart set on political reunification in
December. With West Germany's own treasury sapped by East
German support programs, Mr. Kohl is turning to his Western
allies to fashion a huge Soviet aid package to help win
concessions from Moscow on German unity. Just for starters,
Bonn arranged a $3 billion credit for the Soviet Union last
month.</p>
<p>Bonn believes it's in a good position to ask for help.</p>
<p>For 20 years, Germany has been bolstering its status in
world financial markets. In May, it got a big boost -- one
that carries more prestige than West German officials may
care to admit. A major world body, the International Monetary
Fund, designated West Germany and Japan to share second-place
voting power in the organization, putting them behind only
the United States. Britain dropped to a share of third place,
with France. The IMF ranking, which is based on a complex
measure of a country's overall economic size in the world
economy, is the barometer used to determine the pecking order
in the Group of Seven, the informal banding together of the
world's leading economic powers.</p>
<p>The new rankings could end up creating, in effect, a Group
of Three within the G-7. Bonn's finance minister, Theo
Waigel, likens this development to winning at the Olympic
Games. West Germany and Japan shared the silver medal, he
says, while Britain and France split the bronze.</p>
<p>Mr. Waigel may be betraying more than Bavarian humor. By
the end of the 1990s, a united Germany -- an economic
juggernaut in the center of Europe -- will undoubtedly tilt
the global economic scales further toward the Continent. And
many senior financial officials in Europe say they expect
Germany to flex its muscles in its new and more powerful
role.</p>
<p>At the same time, that emerging role reawakens old fears
in Europe and even within Germany itself that an unchecked
German growth machine could -- as in the past -- become a
threat to European economic and political stability. For this
reason, West German political leaders are trying to make
their country's resurgence coincide with moves to enhance the
power and cohesiveness of the 12-nation European Community.</p>
<p>The time will come, most senior European officials say,
when the U.S. and Japan must choose between coordinating
policy with the individual European states or with the EC as
a unit. Most small countries in Europe hope that the EC, and
not Germany alone, will be the choice.</p>
<p>"You can't have it both ways," says Onno Ruding, former
finance minister of the Netherlands. He says the small EC
nations already are highly dissatisfied with the exclusive
G-7 club, which excludes the smaller European countries. The
EC Commission president attends the summits along with the
seven national leaders. Nevertheless, the smaller countries
fear, now more than ever, that Germany, Japan and the U.S.
will end up calling most of the shots.</p>
<p>Publicly, West Germany is effusive in its commitment to
European economic and monetary union, including the eventual
creation of a common currency issued by a pan-community
system of central banks. This system is scheduled to start
operating by the late 1990s. Yet some West Germans,
particularly the Bundesbank, the country's central bank,
retain deep reservations about ceding national monetary
control to a new European entity.</p>
<p>"It's not without misgivings that we view the
possibilities of attaining a cohesive monetary policy" in the
EC, says one monetary official, referring to divergent
policies within the community on spending and inflation.</p>
<p>Moreover, after 45 years of playing a secondary political
role in Europe, many Germans say unification will let them
show the face of a new Germany. Proud of their country's
economic and political achievements, they see no reason why
they shouldn't exercise power as other states do.</p>
<p>Thanks to strict fiscal policies and controls on inflation
in Germany, the strong mark ranks as the world's
second-largest reserve currency, trailing only the U.S.
dollar. Some 800 billion marks were circulating abroad at the
end of 1989 -- funds that the Bundesbank claims "anchor" the
EC's European Monetary System.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank's key role is further strengthened by the
exchange-rate mechanism of the monetary system, which
requires members to keep their currency fluctuations within a
narrow range. In practice, because of the mark's stability,
this means the Bundesbank already acts somewhat as a central
bank for other EC states.</p>
<p>But can that monetary stability survive the union of East
and West German currencies? That's a point on which Messrs.
Waigel and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl need to
reassure both their fellow Germans and other EC members
before a united Germany can assume a stronger G-7 role.</p>
<p>Other European and G-7 nations already are concerned by
speculation that the Bundesbank will raise West Germany's
official interest rates by a full percentage point this year
to stem the expected inflationary impact of German monetary
union, which took effect last week. U.S. officials, in
particular, fear a world-wide rate spiral if Germany acts in
1990.</p>
<p>The inflation would result, many economists fear, from
West Germany's replacement of the unconvertible East German
currency with highly spendable West German marks. The surge
in the supply of marks could cause prices to rise. And by
1991, the costs of unification could drive the combined
German budget deficit to as much as 100 billion marks (the
equivalent of nearly $60 billion), increasing the country's
borrowing and possibly also fueling the inflationary spiral.</p>
<p>Economists observe that countries with widening deficits
usually hold weakened positions inside the IMF.</p>
<p>"At first, Germany's position in the G-7 could actually be
weaker, because Waigel and Poehl still face a lot of
uncertainties at home," says Heine Flassbeck, a monetary
analyst at the German Institute for Economic Research in West
Berlin. It is one of five think tanks regularly advising the
Bonn government on policy.</p>
<p>But Bonn officials argue that absorbing East Germany's
economy and work force could swell Bonn's gross national
product by 15% and add one percentage point of real GNP
growth annually as East Germany modernizes. The extra output
would increase tax revenues without increasing tax rates,
thus holding down the deficit, they say.</p>
<p>"The transition period could take two to three years
before East Germany begins recovering and German companies
begin penetrating Eastern Europe. Then one might see a much
stronger Germany in international policy," says Mr.
Flassbeck. He adds, however, that Germany will act carefully.
"Everybody in Bonn is sensitive to the fact that many of its
trading partners worry about the concept of a Greater
Germany."</p>
<p>Still, any changes in the G-7 won't be easy -- even if the
EC, and not Germany, steers policy for Europe. Membership in
the G-7 is coveted by European nations. "It's one of the
stages on which Britain and France can still play roles as
world leaders," says an EC official. "The reality may be
different, but as a symbol it is very, very important."</p>
<p>For this reason, former French President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing says he doesn't expect the G-7 structure to change
for at least five years, even as Germany plays an
increasingly important role. But by then, the EC should have
moved considerably closer to its goals of economic, monetary
and political union.</p>
<p>"There will always be a role for the individual member
states in the Europe we are building," he says. "The
important thing is that we share the same goals and
aspirations."</p>
