	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, already badly wounded by troubles with the
Hubble Space telescope and the space shuttle, is facing two
more potentially crippling blows.
   Congress is threatening to cut off funds in December for
NASA's proposed $37 billion space station because it's
overweight, underpowered, hasn't proven it can perform
important scientific experiments and may require extra space
shuttle flights for assembly in orbit. "This is the last
point at which we can pull the plug," says Rep. Bill Green of
New York, the ranking Republican on the House appropriations
panel that oversees NASA.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In addition, the White House is reconsidering its support
for NASA's next big science project, a plan to spend as much
as $50 billion for six enormous satellites that will monitor
the Earth's environment. Officials at the National Space
Council, headed by Vice President Dan Quayle, fear that
NASA's design is too risky, too complex and too likely to
overrun its budget -- just as the space telescope did. "The
question is, do we have a design that has an acceptable level
of risk and {provides} a maximum return as quickly as
possible?" says Elizabeth Prestridge, a spokeswoman for the
Space Council.</p>
<p>These new problems, coming on top of the grounding of the
shuttle fleet and the crippling of the space telescope,
promise the most painful re-examination of the nation's space
program since the space shuttle Challenger blew up four years
ago. Congress plans at least three sets of hearings on NASA's
problems after it resumes its session tomorrow, and two
investigations of the space station.</p>
<p>President Bush's plans for the U.S. to land an astronaut
on Mars by 2019, which already faced long odds of winning
funds on Capitol Hill, may be the first victim of the
criticism directed at NASA. Another victim will probably be
the already strained relationship between NASA and the Space
Council, which blame each other for problems encountered in
the space program.</p>
<p>"At the present time, NASA's eyes are bigger than its
stomach," says Sen. Albert Gore, the Tennessee Democrat who
heads the Senate science and space subcommittee. He doesn't
believe the agency could cope with a new exploration project.</p>
<p>The debate over NASA also will stoke the growing
resentment on Capitol Hill and in the scientific community
against big science projects, which scarf up a bigger
fraction each year of the government's $62 billion a year
research-and-development budget and invariably run into
trouble.</p>
<p>Since 1983, the U.S. has spent more than $25 billion on
big research projects such as the Strategic Defense
Initiative, the space station, the National Aerospace Plane,
the Human Genome Project and the Superconducting
Supercollider. None has advanced further than the design and
testing stage. Next year, the Bush administration plans to
propose a $400 million supercomputer network, too. If these
projects are ever completed, their total cost would rise into
the hundreds of billions of dollars.</p>
<p>"There may be a move away from big science because of the
problems {with Hubble}," says Lyman Spitzer, the Princeton
astronomer who conceived the idea of an orbital telescope 44
years ago and who still supports big projects. "It will
strengthen the argument that big, expensive instruments are
just a mistake."</p>
<p>Even before the Hubble problems, the House voted to kill a
proposed $200 million laser, which would be used to test
Einstein's theories of gravity, because of fears it would
reduce money available for individual scientists.</p>
<p>NASA thought it had put its problems behind it after it
reorganized following the Challenger disaster in 1986, flew
10 successful shuttle missions and drew rave reviews when the
unmanned Voyager spacecraft explored Neptune last summer. "We
have a new NASA," says William Lenoir, the agency's associate
administrator for space flight. "We think we have rebuilt our
organization, rebuilt our processes."</p>
<p>But the events of the past few weeks have made the new
NASA look distressingly like the old one. The agency
discovered that two of its shuttles were leaking potentially
explosive hydrogen fuel and suspects the problem may involve
a set of valves that initially failed a series of acceptance
tests in 1983. NASA has grounded the fleet indefinitely while
it investigates. The agency also found a fundamental defect
in one of the mirrors on the $2.5 billion Hubble Space
Telescope that leaves the craft myopic and puts off for at
least three years many of the experiments astronomers had
planned.</p>
<p>In many ways, Hubble set an unenviable model for NASA's
big science projects. The space agency hyped Hubble's promise
-- claiming it could see to the edge of time -- signed up
scientists to act as lobbyists, divvied up jobs among a
number of NASA centers that don't work well together and
underestimated the project's costs. By the time cost-overruns
and other problems surfaced, NASA already had invested so
much in Hubble that Congress, which approved the added funds,
didn't have the gumption to kill or revise it.</p>
<p>Now, NASA managers say that the space station -- the
agency's biggest project since the Apollo moon landings --
faces serious design problems that could increase its cost.
Already, the project is running quadruple its $8 billion
price tag.</p>
<p>NASA envisions an orbital station the size of the U.S.
Capitol, outfitted with three laboratories, living quarters
and a crew of eight. The station would be built in 18
different giant pieces on the ground and assembled in orbit
during 28 space shuttle missions that would take 4 1/2 years
to complete, beginning in March 1995.</p>
<p>The roots of the station's problems are its complexity and
its reliance on the fragile space shuttle for construction.
Thousands of different pieces must come together, like an
enormous jigsaw puzzle, to build the space station. So far
the pieces don't fit right.</p>
<p>Consider the U.S. space station laboratory. (Japan and
Europe are building their own labs for the station.) Early in
the project, NASA hoped to launch the laboratory on one
shuttle, but the proposed lab has grown so heavy that NASA
now counts on two launches -- one for the laboratory and one
for the equipment -- and may have to add a third. Once in
orbit, astronauts in bulky space suits will have to carry
racks of lab equipment into the tight confines of the
laboratory like moving men lugging big couches up narrow
staircases.</p>
<p>During recent design reviews, NASA has added up the weight
of all the parts to be hauled into space to see whether space
station components could fit into the projected number of
shuttle flights. The station is now about 30% overweight, or
about 150,000 pounds, according to a NASA report obtained by
Space Station News, a Washington, D.C., newsletter. As a
result, the agency probably will have to add more shuttle
flights to construct the station and reduce the size of some
station facilities.</p>
<p>At the same time, the number of hours required for
astronauts to service the space station is growing, raising
doubts about whether the station can be adequately
maintained. NASA expects two astronauts in spacesuits to
replace defective parts during periodic, six-hour maintenance
checks of the station. Space walks are inherently risky
because of the possibility of accidents and the unknown
effects on humans of prolonged exposure to space radiation.</p>
<p>In February, two NASA officials reported that the station
would require 2,284 hours of space walks annually. That's
about one walk every other day, about 15 times as many as Mr.
Lenoir's goal for the project. Now space agency officials
expect that a final space walk report will add at least
another 250 hours.</p>
<p>Even more serious is the shrinking amount of power for
experiments. "That will be harder to fix," says James Sisson,
a space station manager at Marshall Space Flight Center.
"With weight, you can always add shuttle flights. With {space
walks} you can accommodate more time. But with power, you're
limited to what comes out of the solar arrays."</p>
<p>The space station will have a total of 75 kilowatts
available. But the operation of the station itself will
require so much power that so far it has only 10 to 15
kilowatts available for experiments -- less than the 30
considered adequate for the labs.</p>
<p>The House appropriations committee was so spooked by the
station's problems that it passed a provision, which cleared
the House in June, that could cut off space station funding
unless NASA can certify during a December design review that
the station will have adequate power and fully equipped
laboratories. If the Senate goes along, Congress is expected
to appoint a panel to monitor the station's progress. "We
don't want the station to turn out to be a floating can with
a couple of wall sockets in it," says Kevin Kelly, the senior
staffer of the Senate appropriations panel overseeing NASA.</p>
<p>Mr. Lenoir, who has responsibility for the space station,
says the agency will be able to meet Congressional
requirements. He argues that the space station is early
enough in its design life for problems to be fixed. He says
engineers have vastly overestimated the number of
measurements that must be taken to monitor whether the craft
is working well. Reducing those measurements will reduce the
number of sensors required -- saving weight -- and release
more power for experiments. "Unless we're way wrong, I don't
expect a budget or schedule problem" as a result of the
station problems, Mr. Lenoir says.</p>
<p>But others are less sanguine. "The potential is there for
years of delay or billions of dollars in additional costs,"
says Mark Oderman, managing director of CSP Associates Inc.,
a Boston space consulting firm that tracks the space station.</p>
<p>The station's other major problem is its reliance on the
space shuttle to cart station segments into space. Even if
the shuttle turns out to be 98% reliable -- a higher
reliability rate than the shuttle has yet demonstrated --
Congress's Office of Technology Assessment calculates that
there is an 88% chance of a shuttle crash before the station
is complete. (NASA didn't comment on that estimate.) Should
an accident occur during a launch of a crucial station
component -- say, the laboratory -- it could set the station
back years because NASA isn't making spares.</p>
<p>Similar uncertainties face the agency's next big science
project: a grand plan to launch a series of climate
satellites called the Earth Observing System. The White House
is re-evaluating its support because of fears NASA may be
gambling too much on this project, too.</p>
<p>Each of the $3 billion EOS satellites would carry up to 16
different instruments, including some as big as Volkswagen
Beetles, making the satellites the most complex and costly
ever launched. If NASA's schedule holds up -- it's already
about three years behind -- the first satellite, EOS-A, will
go into orbit in 1998. Five other satellites will follow over
15 years.</p>
<p>When EOS was first proposed in 1982, NASA expected
astronauts to be able to repair the climate satellites either
from the space shuttle or from a craft docked to the space
station.</p>
<p>The space agency later canceled those repair plans when it
became clear that shuttle couldn't reach the right orbit for
EOS, but an unmanned Titan rocket could. But NASA didn't
reduce the complexity of the climate satellites. Now, if one
important system on EOS should fail, such as the power or
propulsion, all the instruments aboard would fail too,
without any chance of fixing the problem in orbit. That could
cripple U.S. climate research.</p>
<p>"They've taken a spacecraft design that makes good sense
on a shuttle, and put it on a Titan, where it makes terrible
sense," says John Pike, a space analyst for the Federation of
American Scientists.</p>
<p>The problem with Hubble -- where a fundamental flaw in the
craft's most important instrument, its mirror, was only
discovered after launch -- brought home the riskiness in EOS
to the White House. Now the National Space Council says it is
awaiting the results of several EOS studies before deciding
whether it should try to restructure the program.</p>
<p>The first study, by the National Academy of Sciences, is
due out early next month and is expected to suggest that NASA
could replace some of its huge satellites with constellations
of smaller, less-expensive ones. In October, a harsher report
is expected, which will challenge the underlying premise of
EOS -- that big, complex satellites are necessary to answer
pressing climate questions.</p>
<p>This study is being conducted by the Marshall Institute, a
small Washington think tank led by Robert Jastrow, a
prominent space scientist who once worked at NASA and is held
in high esteem at the White House. An earlier Marshall
report, which took a skeptical look at predictions of global
warming, is believed to have influenced White House Chief of
Staff John Sununu's hard-line views on the subject.</p>
<p>Mr. Jastrow says EOS is wrongheaded and far too expensive
because it doesn't zero in on the most important climate
questions, such as whether clouds are increasing or
decreasing. (Clouds reflect heat into space, potentially
eliminating much of the feared increase in global
temperatures.)</p>
<p>NASA could save money and get results more quickly, he
says, if it launched a half-dozen small satellites, at a cost
of $1 billion to $2 billion, specifically to measure clouds.
"Like Hubble, EOS is another example of mega-science," Mr.
Jastrow says. "NASA is going for the big project at the
expense of an incremental approach" that could yield valuable
information sooner.</p>
<p>(NASA didn't respond to requests for comments on Mr.
Jastrow's views, but it has defended the big-satellite
approach as providing the best way to get a complete look at
changes in the environment.)</p>
<p>Lennard Fisk, NASA's head of space science, says that the
problems with Hubble don't foretell problems with EOS. Hubble
suffered because its management was split between two
competing centers, he says, not because of the spacecraft's
inherent complexity. With that experience in mind, he says,
he insisted that EOS be run from a single center, Goddard
Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.</p>
<p>But the coalescing of so many problems at one time does
suggest a pattern. The space shuttle, space station,
telescope and EOS all have their antecedents in the days
before the Challenger disaster, when NASA's budgets were flat
and the agency was struggling to find a mission. "NASA had to
do everything at a higher level of risk then," says John
Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George
Washington University. "It's come back to bite us."</p>
