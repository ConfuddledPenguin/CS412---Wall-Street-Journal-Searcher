	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- WMS Industries Inc. said it expects to report
a fiscal fourth-quarter net loss, citing weaker-than-expected
sales of amusement games and a $3 million charge to cut staff
and move its headquarters to Chicago.
   WMS makes pinball machines under the Williams and Bally
names and video games under the Williams and Bally/Midway
names. The company also owns and operates hotels.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The $3 million charge for the quarter ended June 30 equals
about 35 cents a share, based on an average 8.5 million
shares outstanding at March 31. In the year-earlier fourth
period, WMS earned $2.4 million, or 28 cents a share, on
revenue of $42.7 million.</p>
<p>Eleven of the 15 staff members at headquarters won't make
the move, WMS said. Overall, the company has 1,700 employees
in its hotel operations and 1,500 on the games side. WMS
estimates the head office relocation will save $2 million a
year.</p>
<p>With the relocation come some executive changes. Louis
Nicastro, WMS's 62-year-old chairman and chief executive
officer, adds the post of president. Neil Nicastro, 34, the
chairman's son, becomes chief operating officer and remains
executive vice president and treasurer. Norman J. Menell, 59,
formerly president and operating chief, becomes vice
chairman.</p>
<p>Harold H. Bach Jr., a 58-year-old former partner at the
accounting firm Ernst & Young, becomes WMS chief financial
officer, succeeding Paul Shackford, 40, who isn't making the
headquarters relocation, which the company expects to
complete this month.</p>
<p>WMS also said it expects to post a loss for the fiscal
year, reflecting operating losses, the fourth-quarter charge
and a third-quarter write-off of $7 million, or 83 cents a
share, on the company's shareholding in Divi Hotels N.V.</p>
<p>WMS attributed the operating deficits to last year's
Hurricane Hugo and its effects on the hotel business and to a
delay in the introduction of new video-game models.</p>
<p>The senior Mr. Nicastro said, however, that as these video
games are unveiled, WMS "expects to secure a significant
share" of the world-wide market. He said WMS's "hotel and
casino properties are in better condition, with more
facilities than ever before."</p>
