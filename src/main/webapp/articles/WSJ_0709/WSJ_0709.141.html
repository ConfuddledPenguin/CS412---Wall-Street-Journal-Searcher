	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Is it possible to suffer from hardening of
the arteries at the age of five? Not likely, maybe, but that
is precisely what some financiers think is happening to the
Group of Seven.
   The G-7, as it's commonly known, is not to be confused
with the the summit group meeting this week, which is led by
heads of state and which frequently is called the Seven. The
G-7, by contrast, has 15 members -- the finance ministers and
central-bank chieftains of those same seven countries, plus
the head of the International Monetary Fund.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Formally established in 1986, the G-7 is the world's most
exclusive and powerful economic club. It will play an
important part in translating into action some of the
initiatives that the heads of state decide upon at this
summit, but its writ runs well beyond that into regulation of
a huge hunk of the global economy, and its pronouncements
frequently move world markets.</p>
<p>In its first years of life, G-7 used its clout effectively
in dealing with major economic problems. It did much to
stabilize an unruly U.S. dollar, it coordinated interest-rate
moves on an unprecedented global scale, and it intervened
speedily to help ensure that the world-wide stock-market dive
in 1987 didn't drag the planet into recession.</p>
<p>But it hasn't done an awful lot lately, and people are
beginning to wonder whether the club members aren't napping
in their wing chairs, victims of early senescence. G-7's
statements, critics point out, have grown more and more
predictable, constantly calling for lower inflation and
higher savings without spelling out concrete steps to achieve
either. Over the past couple of years, its meetings have
produced no major initiatives beyond some relatively modest
fiddling with the industrialized nations' strategy for
handling Third World debt.</p>
<p>"Has the G-7 become irrelevant?" asks Thomas Berger, a
former U.S. Treasury Department official and now director of
a unit of Swiss bank Lombard Odier & Cie. Increasingly, yes,
he and others believe. In a recent essay, he concluded that
"the essential elements of the current G-7 strategy were
formulated in 1985. Like an automobile of this vintage, it is
time for an overhaul."</p>
<p>Balderdash, say the club members. If something isn't
broken, they ask, why fix it? If G-7 is quiet now, they
maintain, that's because its policies have worked so well.</p>
<p>Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady says the U.S. and its
partners have been "successful in maintaining growth,
reducing trade and current account imbalances, containing
inflation and promoting exchange-rate stability." He contends
that G-7 strengthened and lengthened the economic expansion,
now into its eighth consecutive year, and increased its
resiliency in the face of periodic financial market
instability.</p>
<p>There is a great deal of truth in this, and even the
critics do not contest it. But there is also a growing
feeling the G-7 is not being vigorous enough now in managing
currency-exchange rates and other undramatic financial chores
-- work that, if left undone, could lead to bigger problems
later. "The wolf isn't at the door," says Robert Solomon of
Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. "It's just
that we've got termites in the woodwork."</p>
<p>The G-7 may not agree, but it knows that in the world of
international finance perception can be as important as fact.
So, at its next meeting -- a fall conclave is probable -- a
new item is likely to be on the agenda: a discussion of
charges that the group has been resting on its laurels. For
now, the critics can only hope that the response will mean
closer management of the world economy by the members of the
club.</p>
