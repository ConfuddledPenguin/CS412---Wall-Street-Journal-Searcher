	<p class="article-leader">WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. -- BKLA Bancorp expects a
second-quarter loss of $400,000 to $425,000, reflecting loan
write-offs and an increase in loan-loss reserves at its
principal subsidiary.
   The unit, Bank of Los Angeles, wrote off $988,000 in
problem loans and bolstered its loss reserve by $700,000,
partly based on discussions with federal regulators who
completed an examination of the bank in June, BKLA said. In
the year-ago quarter, BKLA had net income of $267,000.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The bank holding company said it expects to return to
profitability in the third quarter and be profitable in the
year. BKLA said that its capital-to-assets ratio continues to
exceed regulatory requirements and that the company's
"liquidity position remains sound."</p>
