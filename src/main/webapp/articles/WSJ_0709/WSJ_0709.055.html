	<p class="article-leader">An analyst at Amsterdam-Rottendam Bank N.V. predicted that
N.V. Philips, the troubled Dutch electronics giant, wouldn't
pay a dividend for 1990.
   A spokesman for the Dutch electronics concern declined to
comment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Last week, Philips's new chairman, Jan Timmer, announced
plans to eliminate 10,000 jobs, or 3.5% of the company's work
force, and forecast a loss of about two billion guilders
($1.1 billion) this year, compared with net profit of 1.37
billion guilders in 1989. At that time, he refused to say
whether Philips would be able to afford a dividend.</p>
<p>In 1989, the dividend was two guilders a share, the same
rate the company has paid since 1983.</p>
<p>The Amro analyst, Peter Berg, urged investors to be
cautious in buying Philips shares because the company had
released only a rough outline of its strategy for stanching
huge losses in its computer and semiconductor divisions.</p>
<p>On the Amsterdam Stock Exchange Friday, Philips shares
slipped to 30.20 guilders from 30.50 guilders Thursday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Timmer said in an interview with Philips's
in-house newsletter that the company needs a "change of
culture" and urged executives to shed their bureaucratic
habits, while advising employees to renounce "the mentality
of meekly accepting . . . things because you think you are
fighting a losing battle."</p>
