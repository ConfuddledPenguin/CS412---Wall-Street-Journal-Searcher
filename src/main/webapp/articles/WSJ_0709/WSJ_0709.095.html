	<p class="article-leader">SAN ANTONIO, Texas -- Datapoint Corp. said a federal court
of appeals has reversed significant portions of a 1988 trial
court decision in a patent infringement suit, raising the
possibility of a "highly material" adverse financial impact
against the company.
   The troubled computer systems maker was sued in 1982, at
the height of its economic success, by Northern Telecom Inc.,
a unit of Montreal-based BCE Inc., which claimed Datapoint
had violated a data entry computer patent. But the case
wasn't tried until 1987, after Datapoint had suffered a
string of financial reverses, and resulted in a ruling that
Datapoint had infringed the patent but that the patent was
unenforceable.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The more recent decision reverses that part of the trial
court ruling that found the patent unenforceable and paves
the way for possible award of damages. Datapoint said it will
seek to have the appeals court decision reversed.</p>
<p>Although Datapoint said it could not predict the amount of
any award, it acknowledged that any award to Northern Telecom
"could be highly material." Northern Telecom initially
claimed its damages were at least $65 million.</p>
<p>An award of that magnitude would be a serious blow for
Datapoint. For its third quarter ended April 28, Datapoint
reported a loss of $8.4 million, or $1.07 a share, compared
with a loss of $21.3 million, or $2.35 a share, in the same
period a year earlier.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Datapoint
shares closed Friday at $2.375, up 25 cents.</p>
