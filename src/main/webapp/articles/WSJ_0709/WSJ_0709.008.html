	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- Societe Generale, France's third-largest
commercial bank, announced the sale of its controversial
East-West trade subsidiary.
   The subsidiary, Sogexport, has been charged by French
authorities on two separate occasions in recent years with
illegally trying to export high-technology equipment to the
Soviet Union. In both cases, the equipment in question could
have been used to manufacture advanced semiconductors, which
in turn could be used in missiles and military jets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The two cases still are pending or under appeal. Societe
Generale, which has insisted that its subsidiary didn't do
anything wrong, said the company sale wasn't linked to the
controversy.</p>
<p>"Those exports represent only a tiny part of Sogexport's
businesses," a Societe Generale official said. "We simply
decided that banking and international trade were very
different busineses. Other banks have reached the same
conclusion and withdrawn from the trading business."</p>
<p>Sogexport's buyers are Societe Auxiliare d'Entreprises, a
construction group, and Finexport, an investment group. One
Societe Generale official said that, because the construction
business is increasingly international, it might make more
sense for SAE and a group of investors to own Sogexport.</p>
<p>Societe Generale didn't disclose the price. But the
complexity of East-West trade together with East Europe's
financial troubles have taken their toll on the Societe
Generale subsidiary. After showing a profit of two million
francs ($361,020) in 1987, Sogexport posted losses of 10
million francs in 1988 and 27 million francs in 1989.</p>
<p>Societe Generale created Sogexport in 1977 and held 91% of
its shares. Under a special agreement, Societe Generale
agreed to continue its involvement in Sogexport's
mining-equipment export business, notably including a
long-term coal-mining project in northern China.</p>
