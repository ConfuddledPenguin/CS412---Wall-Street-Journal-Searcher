	<p class="article-leader">ROSLYN, N.Y. -- To most coin-operated-laundry
entrepreneurs, collecting all those quarters is just a chore.
But to Jan Sussman, president of Coinmach Industries Co., it
is an opportunity to squeeze out more profit.
   Priding himself as a master of coin-collection efficiency,
Mr. Sussman has programmed Coinmach's computer to predict
when each of the 75,000 machines the company handles will
have taken in the $40 necessary to justify a trip. It
continually redraws routes for collectors who will handle 340
million quarters this year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For Mr. Sussman, all this also conjures up a vision of new
expansion. "Our next step is to take a look at our expertise
in coin handling and security," he says. "I believe I can go
into any Long Island town and collect coins from parking
meters at half the cost."</p>
<p>While the parking-meter diversification move is still a
pipe dream, the approach shows how Mr. Sussman has made a
mundane business grow in a saturated market. Coinmach's
revenues have surged nearly fivefold in less than a decade,
to a projected $85 million this year from $18 million in
1981. Its work force has multiplied to 340 from 80 over the
period. The company has become one of the largest operators
in the highly competitive New York metropolitan area
coin-laundry market.</p>
<p>Mr. Sussman's basic formula is simple: Improve your core
business activity and find new niches that really make sense.
"You have to redefine yourself by asking, `What am I really
good at,'" he says. That may seem obvious, but he claims,
"When you ask those questions, the world kind of opens up to
you."</p>
<p>His primary activity remains installing and servicing
washing machines and dryers in leased space in apartment
buildings. To make the operation more efficient, he designed
a computerized "management-information" system. He says this
enables Coinmach to handle 1,500 daily phone complaints
within 10 seconds each, guarantee repair calls within nine
hours and achieve a 98.2% "hit rate" in getting the right
parts from the storage room to the repair crews. This
compares with a 75% industry average, he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Sussman also initiated motivational programs for
employees. As blue-collar workers move along a "growth path"
of four "personal achievement categories," they win bonuses
-- and the right to wear shirts of progressively lighter
shades. Starting with blue shirts, they move on to light blue
with thin stripes, then light blue with wide stripes and
finally pure white. They advance in the shirt hierarchy by
attending classes (one is taught by Mr. Sussman),
demonstrating their skills and undergoing performance
reviews. In the Coinmach classroom, signs bearing
inspirational slogans, such as "I'm Super Good, but I'll Get
Better," adorn the walls.</p>
<p>By giving his rank-and-file more incentives and greater
responsibilities, the 38-year-old Mr. Sussman claims he has
been able to eliminate a layer of supervisers. "One reason
U.S. companies almost got wiped out by the Japanese is that
we overmanaged," he says.</p>
<p>But Coinmach is also looking for diversification
opportunities. One of its fastest-growing divisions sells
turnkey laundromats to investors. If a would-be entrepreneur
has trouble raising the money to buy a store, Coinmach's
recently created Credit Control Co. will lend the money (at a
hefty profit for itself).</p>
<p>In addition to all this, Coinmach:</p>
<p>-- Sets up on-premise laundries in res taurants, hotels,
health clubs and the like. Among the 200 or so clients are
Manhattan's upscale Tavern on the Green restaurant and Har
vard Club.</p>
<p>-- Builds ready-to-operate dry-cleaning establishments for
investors.</p>
<p>-- Sells commercial laundry parts at discount prices via
an 800 number.</p>
<p>-- Remanufactures its own run-down machines at the rate of
125 a week, stripping the paint in acid tanks and installing
new motors.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Sussman says he is mulling the idea of
remanufacturing machines for households. He's also
considering ways to market service-information software
programs.</p>
<p>Coinmach's growth hasn't been without its glitches. The
company recently lost its biggest Manhattan location, the
giant Peter Cooper Village-Stuyvesant Town housing complex
with 1,100 machines, to rival Gordan & Thomas Cos. of East
Orange, N.J. And it made an embarrassing stumble in the
mid-1980s, a joint venture with a group of small telephone
companies to set up a network of pay telephones. "The phones
didn't work. They were terrible," Mr. Sussman says. Worse,
the flop undermined his reputation. After 18 months, he says,
"I got out. It was the worst period of my life." It taught
him, he said, not to venture too far afield.</p>
<p>Mr. Sussman's competitors certainly aren't convinced he's
got a magic formula, and they bristle at his boastfulness.
(He says he is "absolutely positive I'm the industry leader"
and has "dazzled" visitors from rival firms.) Gordon & Thomas
President Thomas Litwin thinks steady growth -- "just
plugging along," as he calls it -- is a better guarantee of
long-term success than the Sussman approach.</p>
<p>Instead of flair, Mr. Litwin says, "We offer better
service and better equipment, and we generate more revenue"
for apartment complexes, which often get a percentage of the
take.</p>
<p>But criticism hasn't dented Mr. Sussman's ambition and
confidence. Indeed, he once said his goal was to stand atop
the Empire State Building and be able to say he owned all the
coin-operated washers and dryers in all the buildings in
sight.</p>
<p>Mr. Sussman plans more expansion. Last October, he
engineered a leveraged buy-out at Coinmach. His family
retains a 30% stake and exerts control with a small group of
investment partners. The LBO raised $15 million for
acquisitions, and Mr. Sussman says he is "actively working on
three" possible purchases.</p>
<p>Where the rush to expand Coinmach will lead remains to be
seen. Ben Russell, editor of American Coin-Op magazine in
Chicago, says he's intrigued by Mr. Sussman's strategy. "It
may be that other people will be forced to go into different
directions like that because the market is so oversaturated,"
Mr. Russell says.</p>
