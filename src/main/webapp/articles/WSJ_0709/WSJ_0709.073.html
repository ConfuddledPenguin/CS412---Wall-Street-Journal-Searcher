	<p class="article-leader">Kathleen Orzech, vice president of personnel at First
American Bank in New York, was having problems with the
employees on the first rung of her company's ladder. "I
wasn't having trouble finding entry-level employees. But I
was having problems with their quality and attitude. There
aren't many people willing to be dues-payers," Ms. Orzech
says.
   The answer to Ms. Orzech's problem was offered by John
Ingram, an old associate who heads an executive search firm.
This certainly wasn't an executive-level search, but Mr.
Ingram had become involved in an employment program designed
specifically to bring enthusiastic entry-level employees to
corporations at reduced costs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ms. Orzech was skeptical when Mr. Ingram asked that she
take part in this program, which places mentally ill people
in part-time "transitional" jobs. She hadn't even heard of
the organization sponsoring it: Fountain House, a 42-year-old
independent, nonprofit organization aimed at rehabilitating
New Yorkers who have spent time in mental hospitals.</p>
<p>This was three years ago. Today, Ms. Orzech is a leading
booster of the Fountain House clubhouse's Transitional
Employment Program. "You can't beat it," she says. "There's a
work ethic. The program prepares them well." Ms. Orzech's
enthusiasm for the program has led her to chair the Fountain
House Employers Advisory Council, whose 16 employer-members
are charged with trying to expand the employer base, which
has shrunk some of late due to corporate layoffs. She also
has impressed her bosses with the cost savings offered by
Fountain House.</p>
<p>Employers that hire Fountain House participants are spared
the expense of providing them with such costly
company-mandated benefits as medical insurance, pension
contributions, profit-sharing and vacation days. And although
Fountain House participants stay only about six months at a
job, employers are spared the expense of retraining, since
all training is done by Fountain House staff placement
managers (there are 57 in all who share responsibility for
managing the system). Additionally, all absences are covered
by Fountain House members or staffers.</p>
<p>Ms. Orzech says the first Fountain House employees had to
be "forced down the throat of the mailroom supervisor." But
when another job opened up three months later, the same
supervisor asked for a Fountain House member to fill the
slot. The bank now has four outdoor messengers, an office
assistant and a porter from Fountain House. "They are just
part of us now, not any different from anyone else," Ms.
Orzech says.</p>
<p>Katherine Kenworthy, head of technical services at
Cravath, Swaine & Moore, the large law firm, is one of the
newest members of the cheering section.</p>
<p>Cravath took its first Fountain House member, Jerry, in
December of last year. "He was a model worker: never late,
never absent, never complained," says Ms. Kenworthy. "And he
is so smart and would quietly help out even when not asked
to. We wish we could have kept Jerry, but that isn't the
arrangement." Now the firm has two new Fountain House members
and Ms. Kenworthy is "very happy with them."</p>
<p>The Cravath employees' duties are varied. They work in the
library sorting incoming mail, shelving, and gluing pockets
in books. They cover the firm's 13 floors, hand-delivering
rush orders of articles, printouts and books, and man the
conveyor belts that deliver information that can take a
slower route. "They are always looking for things to do. They
never chitchat, and there is no goofing off," she says in the
tone of someone who has seen a lot of both in her time. "They
are highly motivated and appreciate the opportunity. I highly
recommend the program."</p>
<p>The Transitional Employment Program, developed in 1957, is
the linchpin of Fountain House's vocational rehabilitation
program. Members are paid market-rate wages (from minimum
wage to $10 an hour) by 31 New York employers. These vary
from big law firms, media companies, ad agencies, and banks
to the Bronx Zoo, the Natural Resources Defense Council, a
nursing home and a hardware store.</p>
<p>Once trained, the members work side-by-side with employees
hired the old-fashioned way in such jobs as mailroom clerk,
indoor messenger, outdoor messenger, plant-care worker, news
assistant (at this newspaper) and office assistant. Last
year, Fountain House members earned nearly $585,000 at 168
transitional placements.</p>
<p>And if an employee doesn't work out? Some members do fail
in a transitional employment placement, but it is a
relatively painless experience both for members and
employers. Fountain House workers are assured that they will
be given as many opportunities as they need to try again and
succeed, and employers know that help is just a phone call
away. A Fountain House staff manager quickly comes in and
takes the member out. And if a replacement worker cannot be
quickly found, the staff manager does the job.</p>
<p>"I've tried other agencies {that place handicapped
workers}," says Charlotte Pentek, director of corporate
office services at Continental Insurance, "and it doesn't
work without the support system." Twenty-one Fountain House
members have gone through Continental's mail/shipping area
and five through the legal department since July 1987.</p>
<p>A relatively new program for companies needing help with
tedious, seasonal work is Fountain House's Enclave Program.
Started two years ago, it is targeted at more severely
disabled members or those not ready for more traditional
transitional employment placements. Members work in
supervised groups, doing such things as tagging goods at
Hoffritz, sorting proxies at Prudential-Bache and stuffing
envelopes at Columbia University.</p>
<p>When members are ready to move on to full-time employment,
Fountain House staffers in the Full-Time Employment Program
help them. Last year, about 50 members got independent jobs
through the fulltime program, a triumph announced by the
ringing of a bell in the clubhouse. One "graduate" is quoted
in the 1988-89 Fountain House Report: "As I was growing up,
doctors, teachers, and even some members of my family thought
I wouldn't work full time because of my illness. If you hear
that for a long enough period of time, you start to believe
it. . . . After {the Fountain House Transitional Employment
Program}, I started my full-time job, and now I'm working my
fifth year on that job."</p>
<p>The transitional employment strategy is belatedly catching
on across North America. Some of the clubhouses with the
largest transitional employment programs (there now are about
150) are Beach House in Virginia Beach, Va.; Gateway House in
Greenville, S.C.; Genesis Club in Worcester, Mass.; The Green
Door in Washington, D.C.; Independence Center in St. Louis;
Lakeside House in Richmond, Va.; Laurel House in Stamford,
Conn.; New Frontier Center in Everett, Wash.; Progress Place
in Toronto; The Club in New Brunswick, N.J., and Vail Place
in Minneapolis. There even is a Fountain House in Malmo,
Sweden, the first clubhouse in Western Europe to provide
transitional employment.</p>
<p>In a time when the phrase "mentally ill" seems linked in
the public mind with "homeless" and "helpless," that is good
news indeed. Hiring the mentally ill can be both a good deed
and a good deal.</p>
