	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- My career as a summit-watcher reached a climax on
a sunny June day in Venice three years ago.
   The industrial world's leaders were huddled in solemn
conclave in the library of a beautiful old monastery on an
island in Venice's lagoon. The world's press was shoehorned
into a hot building on another island, and the White House
press corps kept to itself on yet a third island. All of us
summit-watchers dutifully shuffled from stuffy room to stuffy
room, listening to the British prime minister's press
secretary tell us nothing had happened yet, carefully
checking this against the words of the French president's
spokesman, and making sure that the Germans weren't leaking
anything for the moment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The upshot of all this non-activity was going to be the
release of a banal communique that no one would read,
followed by televised press conferences at which each leader
would explain that he or she won a lot and gave nothing away,
for the benefit of the voters back home. But before this
would happen, there were two more days in which to rush from
briefing to briefing, two more days of joining knots of other
reporters as the Italian deputy finance minister would
periodically enter the press center to declare that he had
nothing to say.</p>
<p>In a moment of lucidity I decided to chuck all this and go
see some of Tiepolo's paintings in a nearby church. For once,
enlightened irresponsibility was rewarded: Also playing hooky
from the formal summit proceedings was a top aide to French
Prime Minister Jacques Chirac. And in a delightful 30-minute
stroll he told me everything that had happened and was likely
to happen at the summit.</p>
<p>Moments like that are unfortunately rare. For as the
annual meeting of the seven most powerful people in the world
developed from an informal chat into an institution, another
institution inevitably grew up alongside: that of the
summit-watcher. Summit-watching, a sort of Westernized
version of the now-passe Kremlin-watching, involves many of
the same skills. The summit-watcher must be able to endure
long periods of utter boredom, run himself or herself ragged
chasing down nonexistent scoops, draw sweeping conclusions
from droplets of usually insignificant information, and at
the end of it all recycle a mountain of platitudes into a
plausible rendition of what the leaders talked about, what
they decided, and what it all means. Most important of all,
after doing all this, the summit-watcher must be prepared to
do the whole thing again a year later.</p>
<p>For those who think they've got what it takes, here are a
few tips:</p>
<p>Know your jargon. Summits are places where participants
and their spokespeople talk in code, both to save time and to
sow confusion. If you know what words like "automaticity,"
"subsidiarity," and "conditionality" mean, and what acronyms
like IMF, BIS, OECD, and EBRD stand for, you can probably
skip all the briefings and go to a rodeo in Houston.</p>
<p>Beware interim distractions. Given that very little
actually happens at these summits, any hint of action usually
starts the summit-watcher's juices flowing. Sometimes
prematurely.</p>
<p>In past years, and especially at the contentious European
Community summits of the early 1980s, the French Walkout Ploy
was always good for excitement. This involved a rumor,
usually started by an Englishman, that a long line of
limousines bearing French flags and with running engines had
been sighted outside the summit hall. The French delegation,
it was said, was so disgusted that it was leaving early. This
actually never happened, but never mind.</p>
<p>The ploy enjoyed a brief revival earlier this year at a
European community summit in Dublin. An Irish reporter
thought he had a big scoop when he noticed that the final
press conference was moved up a couple of hours so that
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl could get back to Bonn. The
chancellor patiently explained that he wasn't walking out in
anger, but rather had an important speech to deliver that
night to a gathering of German Boy Scouts.</p>
<p>Find a comfortable chair and stay there. This is the most
important tip of all. The key to summit-watching is to stay
awake all the way until the end. At the Venice summit three
years ago, the final communique, a particularly long one, was
read aloud, as is customary, by the host country's
representative. This meant listening to the prime minister of
Italy drone on in Italian for 40 minutes. Up on the platform
President Reagan had help to keep awake: Each time he seemed
to be dropping off to sleep, Secretary of State George Shultz
or Treasury Secretary Jim Baker would lean over and say
something into his ear. Summit-watchers in the audience had
no such service, and many of those who had spent two days
rushing around after scoops slept through the summit's
conclusion.</p>
