will hear either gripes or jokes.
   In "Lawyers and Thieves: Legal Shenanigans, Courtroom
Scandal, and the Endless Hunt for Money" (Simon & Schuster,
224 pages, $19.95), by New York attorney Roy Grutman with
Bill Thomas, a former reporter for the Baltimore Sun, we get
both, beginning with the opening line. "My mother has sued
everyone in our family but me," writes Mr. Grutman. He is
eager to prove the legal system is more like waste treatment
than justice.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As Mr. Grutman tells it, the book is not about attorney
shopping but "about how much they cost, in money, time and
trouble," and not about ethics "but about the constant
competition for cases that keeps the courts clogged and makes
sure lawyers are always on the prowl."</p>
<p>Some of the lawyers he describes are Louis Nizer (a
"shrunken head in a three-piece suit"), Edward Bennett
Williams (whose clients included John Connally and Jimmy
Hoffa), Gerry Spence (who just walked Imelda Marcos out of
racketeering and fraud charges) and Melvin Belli (the aged
king of torts, whose "stewardess wives" and son Caesar Mr.
Grutman loves to disparage).</p>
<p>According to Mr. Grutman, one of the truisms about lawyers
is that they will represent anyone. After all, he himself has
represented pornographers and preachers, and for 18 years
handled cases for Penthouse. Another client was the Rev.
Jerry Falwell, who hired Mr. Grutman to go after Hustler
publisher Larry Flynt although the Moral Majority leader had
already tangled unhappily with Penthouse in court.</p>
<p>"Clearly he understood the most essential truth about the
legal profession," writes Mr. Grutman. "A lawyer is a
utensil, like a knife or fork. It doesn't make any difference
who ate with it last, only that it was sufficiently sanitized
between meals."</p>
<p>Now with the firm of Grutman, Greene & Humphrey, Mr.
Grutman shares other insights dating from 1950s
personal-injury scams in the Bronx to his time with Finley,
Kumble, the megafirm that collapsed in a mountain of debt and
egos. At Finley, Kumble for six years starting in 1970, Mr.
Grutman writes he was there while firm head Stephen Kumble
"proceeded to turn the practice of law from a profession into
a bicoastal bait-and-switch operation."</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the book, he insists that "of course, not all
lawyers are thieves." But Mr. Grutman is not shy about
bashing lawyers like Mr. Belli for suing on behalf of a dead
man.</p>
<p>Switching to corporate law, Mr. Grutman discusses New York
takeover-specialist Joseph Flom of Skadden, Arps, who he says
would never be confused with an ambulance chaser. "Yet every
year Flom earns between $3 million and $5 million cleaning up
after corporate collisions."</p>
<p>While not naming names, he likes to remind people that
there are overbillings galore in law. And in an amusing piece
of advice, Mr. Grutman suggests caution about starting legal
action, especially libel. "Think of the worst thing that
could be said about you. Now imagine hearing it announced in
a courtroom by an attorney with a very loud voice whose job
it is to tear you to shreds."</p>
<p>Among the problems with this book is that when anecdotes
give way to general discussion, the prose goes dry. And Mr.
Grutman often inflates his ego a notch or three. Returning to
Mr. Belli, Mr. Grutman boasts of representing Mr. Falwell
during the PTL scandal when Mr. Belli handled Jim and Tammy
Bakker. "By the time the two of us met on TV . . . even Belli
must have realized that the more exposure the case got the
less his clients benefited . . . he stalked off the set in a
huff."</p>
<p>Mr. Grutman is mostly on the mark though in his discussion
of the jury system. Noting that it thrives on an uninformed
populace, he writes that at the trial of Oliver North,
lawyers sought jurors with little knowledge of the
Iran-Contra affair. "Was this a jury of North's peers or a
cross-section of global-village idiots?"</p>
<p>He also attacks a favorite target of lawyers -- insurance
companies -- saying insurance commissions are stocked with
ex-insurance people "the same way the Russians send KGB
agents to work at the U.N."</p>
<p>After doing his share of trashing his own profession, Mr.
Grutman tries to redeem it a bit, recalling the words of the
late Mr. Williams, who won cases no one else would take: "No
doctor worthy of the name turns away a patient . . . no
clergyman . . . turns away a suppliant sinner . . . only a
lawyer is expected to turn away a client because society
regards him as . . . obnoxious."</p>
<p>Nonetheless, writes Mr. Grutman sadly, the system has its
inequities. "Plenty of legal help is available for someone
who wants to file a multimillion-dollar lawsuit. If you
simply happen to be the victim of a crime, you are on your
own."</p>
<p>While the book is entertaining, one is left with several
questions, including which lawyer may sue Mr. Grutman first.
More important, if the legal system is such a low way of
earning a living, why is Mr. Grutman still hanging out his
shingle?</p>
