	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, as expected,
signed into law an interstate banking bill that allows banks
outside New England to buy or open banks in the state.
   The law will take effect in 60 days. A bank, however, can
choose to opt out of the interstate banking provisions until
July 1, 1992, if two-thirds of its directors vote to do so.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Until now, only other New England-based banks have been
able to enter the Massachusetts market.</p>
<p>Gov. Dukakis said, "By opening up Massachusetts to
out-of-state banks, we will help stabilize our banking
industry, as well as increase the amount of capital available
which can potentially help the credit crunch in this state."</p>
<p>Analysts, however, don't expect out-of-state banks to
descend on Massachusetts any time soon. Many of the state's
banks are suffering from slumps in the local real-estate
market and economy, and therefore aren't considered
attractive takeover candidates.</p>
