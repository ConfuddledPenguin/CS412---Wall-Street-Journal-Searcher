	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Next month, Z. Lou Guttman will celebrate his
second anniversary as chairman of the New York Mercantile
Exchange. While the exchange has posted impressive gains in
volume since he took office, some futures traders think Mr.
Guttman and the exchange could be more aggressive in building
trading.
   That's ironic because Mr. Guttman, a platinum trader, is
described as a street fighter by some exchange members. And
he hasn't been accused of a lack of aggressiveness in his
first steps to reorganize the Merc.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In July 1989, he and the Merc board engaged in a bitter
fight with Rosemary McFadden, then the Merc's president. That
battle culminated in a 14-hour board meeting in which Ms.
McFadden was forced to resign. Ms. McFadden was replaced by
R. Patrick Thompson, one of the exchange's own executives.</p>
<p>At age 40, Mr. Guttman is the elder statesman of the major
futures exchanges in New York. The Commodity Exchange's
chairman, Martin Greenberg, took office in March of this
year.</p>
<p>The Merc is the largest commodity exchange in New York and
the third biggest in the U.S., and the largest market in the
world for futures and options on crude oil, heating oil and
gasoline.</p>
<p>The total volume of futures and options traded on the Merc
in the first six months this year was up 31% from the similar
1988 period -- before Mr. Guttman took office. This reflects
a world-wide surge in oil trading. However, some traders
complain that the exchange has been losing more and more
crude oil trading business to off-exchange dealings.</p>
<p>Some traders say the growth in these dealings could have
been slowed had the Merc gone more aggressively after the
business of large traders who typically work off the floor.
They see some discontent among major oil producers with the
way the exchange has catered to their needs. A long-time
crude oil trader at a sizable oil company says, "The power
base of the exchange is still one dominated by locals,"
independent floor traders who deal for their own accounts.</p>
<p>Marianne Hughes, vice president of Coastal Corp. and the
only Merc board member from a major oil firm, said she
doesn't believe that the exchange is indifferent to the oil
industry. It would be useful to have more oil-industry people
on the Merc board, she said, but industry people are
reluctant to seek the positions: "Maybe they don't want to
commit the time, or their firms don't want them to put in the
time."</p>
<p>Mr. Guttman came to the U.S. from Hungary when he was
eight years old and grew up in Brooklyn. He assumed the post
of Merc chairman in August 1988 when the previous chairman
resigned. He was elected to a two-year term in March 1989.</p>
<p>Since that time, he has put in place his own
administrative team. "The last piece in the {reorganization}
package was put into place in May when we succeeded in hiring
Bob Davis as senior vice president for planning and
development," says Mr. Guttman. Mr. Davis had been a member
of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission since 1984. Mr.
Guttman now says, "For the first time in two years, it's
starting to become a pleasure to be chairman of the
exchange."</p>
<p>Little of Mr. Guttman's time today is spent on the
goings-on in the platinum pit, where he started at the Merc,
though he still does some trading from his office. He is more
likely to be looking for another contract to follow the
natural gas contract introduced April 3.</p>
<p>It was the first successful launch by any futures market
of a nonfinancial contract in many years. Since the beginning
of June, daily volume in natural gas has averaged more than
500 contracts a day, while open interest (the number of
contracts outstanding) has climbed to more than 5,000. The
contract had been in the works for 10 years, but as one
former Merc board member says, "Lou finally got {the
contract} out the door."</p>
<p>The Merc is now working on a contract for so-called sour
crude, or high-sulfur oil. The exchange, however, has been
criticized for coming in third in the race to develop this
contract. The Singapore International Monetary Exchange
started trading a sour-crude contract within the past month,
and the London-based International Petroleum Exchange will
begin trading one late this month.</p>
<p>Mr. Davis says the delay is due to the creation of a
contract that permits physical delivery of oil by ship on the
U.S. Gulf Coast. "Physical delivery is more complicated than
a cash-settled contract and requires detailed groundwork to
establish the delivery mechanism," he says. But he goes on to
point out that physical delivery provides a more reliable
convergence of futures prices to the cash market and seems to
be what the oil industry wants. The other two sour-crude
contracts are settled with cash payments.</p>
<p>Several former Merc board members agree that the fact the
Merc probably won't be trading its contract before June 1991
won't necessarily be fatal. One says, "U.S. refiners will
definitely use it if it's well-written, because it will
reduce a lot of risk that the present futures contract
presents for sour crude."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Guttman continues to handle the on-again,
off-again discussions on merging New York futures exchanges.
The only serious negotiations taking place now are between
the Merc and New York's second-largest futures exchange, the
Comex. Such a move should reduce costs and give the two more
clout in dealing with the two Chicago exchanges, which do
about 75% of the futures and options business in the U.S.</p>
<p>One former crude trader predicts that if the Merc "comes
out with a good sourcrude contract, then all the other
criticisms will be forgotten." The Merc still has what
amounts to a virtual monopoly on energy trading, and "It's
awfully difficult to lose a monopoly," he says.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:</p>
<p>Energy</p>
<p>Crude oil prices slipped as production in Norwegian
offshore oil fields continued to return to normal. Wildcat
strikers at some operations are still refusing to return to
work. But market participants have perceived that not enough
of the 1.6 million barrels of daily production from the
Norwegian sector of the North Sea will be halted to help
whittle down the largest overhang of inventories in eight
years. In addition, reports that Venezuelan officials are
considering among themselves whether to request a higher
quota from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
unnerved some traders. Such a request from the typically
conservative cartel member could unleash a number of similar
requests from other OPEC producers, causing further chaos in
the market. Kuwait, which has been pumping beyond its
assigned quota for months, has also said that it wants a
greater allotment. Despite lower crude oil prices, gasoline
prices rose. A deadly explosion at an Arco Chemical Co. plant
outside Houston was one of the reasons. The plant makes among
other things 27,500 barrels a day of methyl tertiary butyl
ether, an additive used in the production of no-lead
gasoline.</p>
<p>Livestock and Meats</p>
<p>Consumer resistance to rising bacon prices and mounting
supplies of frozen pork bellies are likely to continue to
push pork belly futures prices lower, analysts said. Prices
for bacon, which is made from pork bellies, average $1.57 a
pound across the U.S. and are as much as 20% higher than that
in many urban areas, compared with an average of $1.42 a
pound a year ago, said Charles Levitt, a futures analyst with
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in Chicago. Prices for frozen
pork bellies have declined in recent days, mainly because of
sluggish retail demand, analysts said. On Friday, pork belly
futures for delivery this month fell the daily limit of two
cents a pound to close at 54.17 cents a pound on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. Traders are expecting figures due out
after the close of trading tomorrow to show that frozen pork
belly supplies are mounting in warehouses around Chicago, on
the basis of lower-than-expected shipments to processors.</p>
<p>Cotton</p>
<p>Futures prices continued to decline at the end of the
week, with the October and December contracts falling two
cents a pound -- their daily limits -- to 78.74 cents and
73.62 cents, respectively. The July contract closed 1.36
cents lower at 91.44 cents a pound. This week will see the
expiration today of the July contract. Ed Whitten, cotton
specialist at Balfour Maclaine Futures in New York, said he
expects the contract to expire without any "fireworks." There
is one large Memphis, Tenn., cotton merchant holding most of
the previously purchased contracts, and it is widely believed
that this merchant sold a few contracts Thursday and Friday
to reduce pressure on the market. Cooler weather with some
precipitation was forecast for parts of the Texas coast, but
Mr. Whitten said it wouldn't be enough to help the crop. He
said support for the October contract should be initially
felt around 78 cents a pound, with stronger support between
75 and 76 cents. He expects significant support for December
cotton at about 71 cents. Resistance to higher prices can be
expected at recently set life-of-contract highs. "I would
look for a continued sell-off early in the week with a
recovery later in the week," Mr. Whitten said. "It all
depends on what the {commodity} funds do. They dominate the
market now."</p>
