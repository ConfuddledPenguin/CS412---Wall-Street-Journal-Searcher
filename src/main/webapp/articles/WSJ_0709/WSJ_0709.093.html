	<p class="article-leader">NORWALK, Conn. -- Bolt Technology Corp. said it can't
repay $6.7 million in debt principal and has entered into
discussions with its bankers to avoid seizure of collateral.
   Separately, the maker of seismic equipment for mineral
exploration said Chairman Bernard Luskin, 65 years old, had
retired as president and chief executive officer. Succeeding
him will be Raymond M. Soto, formerly treasurer and senior
vice president, finance.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Soto said in an interview that a bankruptcy-court
filing by Bolt is a "possibility but not a probability,"
adding, "We'll be having discussions with the bank over the
next several days." The loan is owed to Connecticut Bank &
Trust Co., a unit of Bank of New England Co.</p>
<p>For the first nine months of the fiscal year ended June
30, Bolt posted a loss of $2.4 million, or 51 cents a share,
compared with a loss of $1.1 million, or 22 cents a share, a
year earlier. Revenue for the first nine months of fiscal
1990 totaled $4.2 million, compared with $6.1 million the
year before.</p>
<p>Mr. Soto declined to specify results for the quarter just
ended but said they "were in line" with the trend for the
first nine months.</p>
