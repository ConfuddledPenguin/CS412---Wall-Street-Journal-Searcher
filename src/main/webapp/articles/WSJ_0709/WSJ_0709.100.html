	<p class="article-leader">GREENWICH, Conn. -- Pittston Co. named Joseph C. Farrell
to the new position of president and chief operating officer,
making him the odds -- on choice to succeed chief executive
Paul W. Douglas when he retires next year.
   The 63-year-old Mr. Douglas, who is scheduled to step down
in September 1991, said the promotions of Mr. Farrell, 54,
and David L. Marshall, 51, who was named to the new post of
vice chairman, would make for an "orderly process of
transition."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Messrs. Farrell and Marshall were previously executive
vice presidents.</p>
<p>Mr. Douglas became chief executive of Pittston in 1984
with the charge of streamlining the then-troubled coal mining
and transport concern. He has largely succeeded, though not
without suffering a nine-month coal miners' strike that ended
in January. Mr. Farrell was the company's chief negotiator in
the contract talks with the United Mine Workers union.</p>
<p>In addition to the promotions, Pittston said it formed a
new, four-man office of the chairman, consisting of Messrs.
Douglas, Farrell and Marshall and Robert D. Duke, senior vice
president and general counsel.</p>
