	<p class="article-leader">Hyatt Legal Services is reducing its chain of law offices
and spinning off a profitable division that sells and manages
prepaid group legal plans.
   Joel Hyatt, the founder and senior partner, said the
spinoff will raise $35 million in capital for Cleveland-based
Hyatt. However, the restructuring plan is the latest
indication that the firm may have grown too rapidly. After a
long period of adding new offices, it has been cutting back
its outlets in recent years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Hyatt's moves also reflect broader changes in the
legal-services industry. When Mr. Hyatt founded the company
in 1977, he tapped a big market of blue-collar clients by
opening offices in shopping centers and offering simple
wills, uncontested divorces and other consumer legal products
for low, standardized fees. But after Hyatt dominated the
industry along with Jacoby & Meyers in New York, other firms
began moving into the field. An increasing number of lawyers
began advertising their wares.</p>
<p>"There's definitely more competition for legal retail
services," says Richard Neimand, executive director of
marketing for Jacoby & Meyers.</p>
<p>By spinning off its group legal services division, Hyatt
apparently is seeking to exploit a successful part of its
business. It has sold prepaid employee legal service plans to
such companies as General Motors Corp. and PepsiCo Inc.
Prepaid employee plans now account for about 20% of Hyatt
Legal Services' revenue, Mr. Hyatt said.</p>
<p>The group-plan business is being sold to a newly created
company called Hyatt Legal Plans Inc. The new company is
owned by Hyatt Legal Services' three senior executives,
including Mr. Hyatt, as well as two outside investors, Sheet
Metal Workers' National Pension Fund and a group led by
Robert Bass, one of the wealthy Bass brothers of Texas. The
investors are putting up $35 million, Mr. Hyatt said, in
return for a combination of securities that includes senior
debt, subordinated debt, preferred and common stock.</p>
<p>Mr. Hyatt said the three Hyatt executives would own the
largest share of the new company, but declined to elaborate.
He said the new capital would be used to beef up television
advertising for Hyatt's law offices, to improve their
computer systems and to pay off debt. He also said Hyatt
Legal Services plans for the first time to create partnership
opportunities for some of its staff attorneys.</p>
<p>Retrenchment plans call for Hyatt to close or sell 24 of
its 168 law offices. The offices are located in Portland,
Ore.; Houston; the Minneapolis-St. Paul area and the
Tampa-Orlando, Fla., area. Mr. Hyatt said some, but not all,
of the offices were losing money. He said the cutbacks would
affect about 50 of Hyatt's 450 attorneys, but noted that some
of them would purchase their offices. Plans for cutbacks in
Northern California and Denver are also under way.</p>
<p>In 1986, Hyatt Legal Serices had 200 offices in 22 states.
After the cutbacks, Mr. Hyatt says, there will probably be
between 130 and 135 Hyatt offices in 19 states. He declined
to say whether the law-office chain as a whole is profitable.</p>

<p>LIABILITY OF DES MANUFACTURERS limited by Illinois Court.</p>
<p>The Illinois Supreme Court ruled that a DES plaintiff
cannot collect damages unless she can prove which company
manufactured the drug her mother took.</p>
<p>In a decision last week, the court refused to adopt a
theory of liability that holds all manufacturers in an
industry jointly responsible for damages from defective
products. The ruling is a setback for DES plaintiffs who
often cannot identify the drug manufacturer that caused the
alleged damage.</p>
<p>DES, or diethylstilbestrol, was marketed during a 30-year
period beginning in the 1940s. The drug was often prescribed
to reduce the chances of miscarriage during pregnancy. It is
now believed to have caused cancer and other health problems
in the womens' offspring.</p>
<p>Sandra Smith, 36 years old, who learned in 1978 that she
had a form of vaginal cancer, filed suit in 1980 alleging
that she developed the cancer because her mother took DES
while pregnant. The eight defendants include Eli Lilly & Co
of Indianapolis, Ind., Abbott Laboratories of Abbott Park,
Ill., and William H. Rorer Inc. of Fort Washington, Pa.
Rorer, a unit of Rorer Group, has since changed its name to
Rorer Pharmaceutical Corp.</p>
<p>DES was regarded as a generic drug and rarely was
prescribed by brand name. The doctor who prescribed the drug
to Ms. Smith's mother had died by the time Ms. Smith filed
her suit. But under the collective liability theory known as
"market share," each company that manufactured the drug might
have been held liable for damages in proportion to its share
of the market at the time the product was used. Four states
-- California, New York, Washington and Wisconsin -- have
adopted some form of "market share" liability in DES cases.
The highest state courts in Iowa and Missouri have rejected
the theory.</p>
<p>In its decision, the Illinois Supreme court said that
little reliable information existed concerning the companies'
market share. The judges worried that trying to establish
such percentages would be too costly and time consuming. And
the court said it was speculative to impose liability when it
was possible that the company that actually sold the product
wasn't in the case.</p>
<p>Adopting the theory, the court wrote, "would alter our
tort law significantly while only providing a markedly flawed
alternative with unclear future ramfications."</p>
<p>Joseph A. Power, Jr., a lawyer for Ms. Smith, said:
"Ninety-nine percent of the DES daughters will now be
disenfranchised. It's almost impossible to prove the
manufacturer of the specific drug their mothers took." Mr.
Power, of the Chicago law firm of Hayes & Power, said he
plans to ask the court to reconsider the case.</p>
<p>In a dissent, Justice William G. Clark wrote that
"wrongdoing manufacturers" would benefit from the court's
decision.</p>
<p>But Richard C. Bartelt of the Chicago law firm of Wildman,
Harrold, Allen & Dixon, Lilly's lawyer, said "this
re-establishes fairness in civil lawsuits."</p>

<p>WESTINGHOUSE WON an age-discrimination suit brought by the
EEOC.</p>
<p>The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission had turned
down a $35 million settlement offer from Westinghouse
Electric Corp. two years ago. But last Thursday, the federal
agency -- and the 4,000 retirees it represented -- walked
away empty-handed.</p>
<p>In an about-face, a federal appeals court in Philadelphia
reversed itself and ruled that Westinghouse hadn't violated
federal law when it forced 4,000 laid-off employees to retire
before age 70. The EEOC claimed the workers should be
eligible for both severance and retirement pay. But the court
agreed with Westinghouse that the layoffs didn't represent
involuntary retirement because they weren't age-related.
Therefore, the court ruled, the workers weren't entitled to
both severance and retirement benefits.</p>
<p>The workers were offered a choice by Westinghouse of
either early-retirement benefits or severance.</p>
<p>The EEOC brought suit against Pittsburgh-based
Westinghouse, an electrical products and broadcasting
concern, in 1983. The ruling came after the U.S. Supreme
Court remanded the case to the appeals court last October
because of a June 1989 ruling in which the high court said
employee benefit plans were exempted from federal age
discrimination laws.</p>
<p>"Westinghouse is pleased with the Third Circuit court
ruling," said company spokesman Jim Schmitt. "It indicates
and confirms the position which Westinghouse has argued
before the courts for nearly 10 years . . . that the company
doesn't discriminate against older workers."</p>
<p>If the EEOC had accepted Westinghouse's $35 million
out-of-court offer, it would have paid $8,750 in severance
benefits to each of the 4,000 plaintiffs.</p>

<p>DIET-PILL FIRMS were shut and their operators criminally
charged in Florida.</p>
<p>Five officials of Health Care Products Inc., based in
Lutz, Fla., and Overeaters Inc., based in the Tampa area,
were charged with scheming to defraud customers nationwide by
making misrepresentations about weight-loss products.</p>
<p>Health Care Products sells Cal-Ban 3000, which is largely
guar gum, authorities say. It has been advertised in
Cosmopolitan, the National Enquirer and other publications.
Iowa blocked the sale of Cal-Ban 3000 earlier this year.
Overeaters and Fat Busters Inc., which were merged into
Overeaters, distributed products called Dietol-7 and
Bodi-Trim, respectively, authorities said.</p>
<p>Bill James, the state attorney in Hillsborough County,
said contrary to the companies' advertising, "These pills
alone aren't going to cause anybody to lose weight without
diet and exercise."</p>
<p>In a parallel move, the U.S. Attorney in Tampa obtained
court orders to unplug the companies' toll-free 800 telephone
lines. In court papers, the U.S. attorney said the defendants
had been selling pills by phone and delivering them by United
Parcel Service to try to circumvent earlier court orders
obtained by the Postal Service barring sales of the pills by
mail.</p>
<p>Attorneys for Overeaters couldn't be reached for comment.
Frank Winkles, an attorney for Health Care Products, said
criminal charges are uncalled for since his clients had no
criminal intent to defraud customers.</p>
<p>Medical experts differ on Cal-Ban 3000's effectiveness, he
says, adding the company offers full refunds to dissatisfied
customers.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Noted: Kirkpatrick & Lockhart, a 300-lawyer Pittsburgh law
firm, has merged with the Boston law firm of McDermott &
Rizzo, which has 10 lawyers. Kirkpatrick & Lockhart already
has five lawyers in Boston. . . . John McDermott has joined
Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, a 275-lawyer New York law
firm, as a litigation partner in the firm's Los Angeles
office. Mr. McDermott previously headed the litigation
department at the Los Angeles office of the Chicago-based law
firm of McDermott, Will & Emery.</p>
