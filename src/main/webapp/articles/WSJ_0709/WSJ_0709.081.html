	<p class="article-leader">Months of budgetary paralysis ended Saturday morning when
the Massachusetts Legislature passed a tax increase of as
much as $1.6 billion -- including a 5% levy on the fees of
lawyers, accountants, engineers and architects in one of the
nation's broadest taxes on services.
   The bill, expected to be signed today by Gov. Michael
Dukakis, immediately came under fire from business leaders
and representatives of professional groups, who said it will
further cripple the already sluggish economy of
Massachusetts.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Inevitably, the bill's passage will strengthen forces
behind a petition on the November ballot to roll back taxes
and spending, adding unlikely activists such as engineers and
accountants to the state's growing anti-tax movement.</p>
<p>"This bill's outrageous," said Eugene M. Freedman, an
executive at the accounting firm of Coopers & Lybrand and
chairman of the Massachusetts Business Roundtable. "It will
be damaging an already fragile economy and creates an
impression that this state is hostile to business. The fact
is, this Legislature has still done nothing to arrest the
rate of growth in expenditures; they don't understand that,
like a business, if you don't have the revenues, you don't
spend the money."</p>
<p>After spending several contentious weeks in a conference
committee, the tax bill passed Saturday is, in fact, much
less sweeping than the original sales tax proposal, proffered
by the state Senate, which extended to many more areas of the
service economy. The original plan, proposing a tax on
everything from financial services to banking and real
estate, was watered down after vigorous opposition by
business leaders and threats by several companies to leave
the state.</p>
<p>In taxing the service economy to balance its budget,
Massachusetts is going further than other industrialized
states, such as Connecticut and New York, which have
attempted similar initiatives during the past year.</p>
<p>Services are expected to constitute 70% of the nation's
economy by the year 2000, versus only 30% in 1950,
emboldening an increasing number of state officials to begin
looking toward the service sector for much-needed revenue.
New York's proposed tax, however, crumbled under opposition
from professional groups. In Connecticut, a similar bill
passed last year, includes only architects and engineers,
along with several other service industries.</p>
<p>A similar proposal in Florida three years ago set off a
national outcry among lobbyists and was defeated.</p>
<p>The Massachusetts bill will raise almost $1.1 billion for
this fiscal year which began July 1 and $1.6 billion in
fiscal 1992, helping to ease the state's continuing budgetary
crisis. Even with the new taxes, most of which would go into
effect on Dec. 1, state officials concede that more spending
cuts will be needed to balance the budget for the current
fiscal year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, officials at the Massachusetts revenue
department reported that tax receipts were even more sluggish
than expected in June, closing out fiscal 1990 with a 3.3%
decline in total collections from the previous year,
including a 19.3% plunge in corporate-tax receipts.</p>
<p>The newly passed tax bill slightly raises the state's
income tax rate to 5.95% retroactively to Jan. 1, and then to
6.25% for 1991 and back to 5.95% for 1992 and subsequent
years. Even though the rate was due to drop from 5.75% to 5%,
the new higher rates are still lower than that of many
industrialized states, such as New York and California.</p>
<p>In the more controversial area of sales tax, the new bill
applies a 5% tax to 594 services -- everything from car
repair to commercial photography -- with an array of levies
and exemptions that many tax specialists are already calling
confusing and possibly unenforceable.</p>
<p>Among the most notable provisions is one waiving the sales
tax for professional bills of less than $20,000, allowing
small businesses and most private clients to be excluded from
taxes for using a lawyer, accountant, architect or engineer.</p>
<p>In any event, tax specialists note that the bill, like
taxes on services tried in other states, will cause confusion
that may make the state's tax-collection task difficult and
expensive. For instance, a Massachusetts business that
employs an out-of-state accounting firm, will have to pay a
"use fee" equal to the newly passed sales tax on such a
service. Similarly, out-of-state companies that use a taxable
service in Massachusetts will have to pay the 5% based on
verification of where the service is actually delivered.</p>
<p>"There are a host of legal problems that may cause this
tax to collapse, because the way services, especially
professional services, are delivered is not easy to measure,"
said John Dubitzky, a Boston attorney who represents a number
of financial services groups. "One thing's certain: For those
who have the good fortune of being tax lawyers, there will be
an awful lot of litigation and new business."</p>
