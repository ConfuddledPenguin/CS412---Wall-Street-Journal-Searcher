	<p class="article-leader">TAIPEI -- Taiwan's new finance minister says he would like
to open the country's stock market to foreign institutional
investors "as soon as possible," but the move could be
delayed a year or more while Taipei considers major political
reforms and revamps market regulations.
   Wang Chien-shien, who took the finance post last month,
said in an interview that because of the government's current
state of flux and the need to draft regulations for the
market opening, the best he can predict is that it will come
"within one or two years."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"This is my personal goal," Mr. Wang said. "But our market
is so small that we have to be careful about limiting them
{foreign institutional investors} when they first come in."</p>
<p>In the past week, officials of Taiwan's Securities and
Exchange Commission told foreign brokers that a limited
number of foreign institutional investors may be allowed to
invest in the stock market within a year, and perhaps as soon
as six months from now.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang said another reason it was difficult to specify
when the opening would take place was because the country is
on the verge of major political changes. At a National
Affairs Conference in Taipei that began June 28 and ended
Wednesday, political and business leaders drew up a blueprint
for revamping the government. Their suggestions have included
direct presidential elections and holding new elections for
all members of the three-chamber Parliament as soon as next
year.</p>
<p>"So many things are unpredictable at this time," Mr. Wang
said. "We don't even know what kind of political system we
will have in the future."</p>
<p>The stock exchange's weighted price index has plummeted
62.6% since the market peaked in mid-February. Because of the
market's overall bearish nature and Mr. Wang's pledge to rein
in local market speculators, a consensus has been building
both within and outside the government that it is time to let
in foreign institutional investors.</p>
<p>Government officials believe that foreign investors will
be long-term holders of stocks and so bring more stability to
the market. The government also expects that foreign
institutions will help modify the violent swings the Taiwan
index has experienced in the past few years by acting as
contrary investors: selling as the market reaches new highs
and buying during downturns. Taiwan investors tend to do some
of their heaviest buying near market peaks, and then try to
bail out as the index falls.</p>
<p>Institutional investors account for less than 10% of the
market volume, which averages between 800 million and one
billion shares a day. The individual investors -- who
constitute one of every five people on this island -- are for
the most part speculators who trade solely on rumors. Often
these rumors are spread by about two dozen big investors who
"ramp" the market, buying large blocks of shares and then
selling out to unsophisticated local investors who jump in as
the prices rise.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang said he is determined to eliminate the influence
of these big investors. He also has announced a crackdown on
insider trading that is aimed at Taiwan company directors who
ramp their own shares. Mr. Wang concedes that the crackdown
won't be easy to accomplish because more than a dozen Taiwan
legislators serve as executives at brokerage houses, and many
of the big investors are politically influential.</p>
<p>Because of joint ventures and foreign investments in
Taiwan companies, foreigners currently own almost 10% of
Taiwan's shares outstanding. But trading these blocks of
shares is a cumbersome process that requires approval by the
Ministry of Economic Affairs.</p>
<p>The SEC is currently studying how other countries have
opened their markets. One of several methods under
consideration would be to split off separate blocks of shares
for foreign investors so that they couldn't buy a majority of
a company's shares. Another would involve allowing foreigners
to buy only nonvoting stock.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang said that whatever system is adopted, the market
at first is likely to open to selected institutional
investors who meet standards set by the SEC.</p>
