	<p class="article-leader">MADRID -- For the 1992 commemoration of Columbus's
discovery of America, Madrid plans to transform the Linares
Palace into the House of America, but for now it has a house
of horrors on its hands.
   The uninhabited 19th-century mansion has always had a
bizarre reputation among Madrid residents, beginning with an
allegedly tragic marriage, a murder and suicide. Rumors of
hauntings have floated around for years, but they were never
taken seriously until the appearance of parapsychologist
Carmen Sanchez de Castro.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A few weeks ago, Ms. Sanchez de Castro's recordings and
photographs purporting to give evidence of ghosts unleashed a
Spanish media circus. Her photographs showed weird lights;
the recordings are said to have captured the words
"murderers, murderers."</p>
<p>The circus intensified with Ms. Sanchez de Castro's arrest
in connection with a bad check written nine years ago.
However, she was released the following day, apparently
protected by a statute of limitations.</p>
<p>Now everyone's wondering what the next twist will be in a
project that, if not cursed, has acquired some bizarre
attributes. Some even speculate that the alleged hauntings
reflect sinister undercurrents in Madrid's real estate
market.</p>
<p>"This building has been a black spot on the Madrid
property market for years," says a Madrid-based writer and
specialist in paranormal phenomena, who asks not to be
identified. "A series of things have been happening which may
be coincidence, or may not."</p>
<p>Built in 1873 for Jose Murga, first marquis of Linares,
the lavishly decorated three-story mansion occupies a prime
site in the central Plaza de Cibeles, diagonally across from
the Bank of Spain.</p>
<p>Popular lore alleges that the marquis's wife, Raimunda,
was discovered to be the illegitimate daughter of the
marquis's father and a beautiful cigarette-factory worker.
Some say the couple lived in celibacy after the discovery.
Others hold that a child was born, only to be murdered at
once and its corpse hidden inside the building. The marquis
is alleged to have later committed suicide.</p>
<p>Whether or not such blood-curdling stories are true --
they were roundly denied by a member of the Spanish Academy
-- the palace's subsequent history has been problematic.</p>
<p>Upon the marquis's death, the mansion went to his
goddaughter Raimundita. If one believes in the curse, it was
perhaps fated that at the start of the Spanish Civil War,
Raimundita's daughter would be visiting her aunt and uncle in
a village outside Madrid when a group of militiamen came to
call. As the men began to arrest the aunt and uncle,
Raimundita's daughter tried to intervene. The three were shot
together.</p>
<p>For a while, the house was rented to a shipping company.
In the 1960s, it was sold to the Confederation of Spanish
Savings Banks, but its plans to convert the mansion into a
new headquarters languished, and for years the palace was
left empty.</p>
<p>The building was recognized as a national monument in 1976
and was used as a movie set a few years later.</p>
<p>Ill fortune apparently didn't visit again until 1988, when
a property company sold the palace to Emiliano Revilla, a
former sausage maker who was launching a new career as a
property developer. A band of terrorists, however, had other
plans for Mr. Revilla. Soon after purchasing the palace, he
was kidnapped by the Basque separatist group ETA. His
eight-month kidnapping is the longest by the ETA to date.</p>
<p>In a theory held by the Madrid writer, Mr. Revilla had
been warned to stay away from the palace. Rather than being
of a ghostly nature, though, the writer says these warnings
were part of a real estate "war."</p>
<p>In February, Mr. Revilla reached an agreement with the
Madrid city council to exchange the building for another
piece of real estate in a transaction valued at 3.1 billion
pesetas ($30 million). And so came about the seemingly
ordinary plan to design the House of America in connection
with the 1992 World's Fair in Seville.</p>
<p>But then the vague rumors about hauntings began to
surface, culminating two weeks ago with a furor of public
comment after the release of Ms. Sanchez de Castro's
findings.</p>
<p>Reporters and private citizens broke into the mansion,
forcing security guards to call the police to get them out. A
few days later, a radio crew with permission to spend the
night there claimed to have recorded voices in a well saying,
"Raimunda," "No, no, no," and "Never again."</p>
<p>Pictures and tapes aside, security guards say they've
never noticed anything abnormal at the palace. And a
representative of an association that investigates the
paranormal is accusing Ms. Sanchez de Castro of fabricating
evidence to publicize a book she apparently has hoped to
publish.</p>
<p>City officials, meanwhile, don't discount the possibility
of spectral voices in the palace, but they say the hauntings,
true or not, won't affect their plans. Restoration of the
future House of America is scheduled to start this autumn,
says a spokesman.</p>
