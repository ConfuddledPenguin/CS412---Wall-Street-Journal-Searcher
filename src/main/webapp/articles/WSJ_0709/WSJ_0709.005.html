	<p class="article-leader">REDWOOD CITY, Calif. -- A tiny software company has
developed what is probably the best defense yet against
computer snoops, hackers and viruses, but the National
Security Agency is blocking efforts to expand the
technology's use.
   RSA Data Security Inc.'s approach is already widely used
in Europe. In the U.S., a number of companies, including
Novell Inc., Lotus Development Corp. and Digital Equipment
Corp., have licensed the technology for use in their
products. A Pentagon logistics agency and InterNet, the
nation's premier computer network for researchers, also use
the technology. And now, based on the premise that private
industry won't adopt a computer-security standard until
government does, the U.S. is considering endorsing RSA Data's
approach. If that happens, computer companies will have a
greater incentive to invest in the technology.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But according to government officials, the National
Security Agency -- the government's largest intelligence
agency and most skilled code breaker -- is objecting to the
choice of RSA Data's technology and is generally reluctant to
move forward on any standard in the field known as public-key
cryptography. The probable reason, the officials say: The RSA
system is too effective. The snoopers blocked by the system
could include the NSA itself.</p>
<p>Some see the RSA case as a classic example of domestic
companies being deprived of ready access to a valuable
product by national security interests. "The unintended
effect is that the most interesting cryptographic research is
going on outside of the U.S.," says John Gilmore, a computer
consultant in San Francisco. Adds Martin Hellman, a Stanford
University professor: "NSA has a vested interest in not
getting all the knowledge (about security) applied."</p>
<p>The NSA won't comment on its role, but there's no doubt
that not adopting a standard is costly. Hackers appear to
have little trouble penetrating many computer networks,
sometimes leaving damaging computer viruses. Users of such
networks have no ironclad way of knowing who sent them
messages, making it nearly impossible to safely transmit
legal documents, such as contracts. Moreover, the failure of
U.S. computer makers to offer more stringent security
features seems likely to hamper their sales in foreign
countries, where RSA Data's technique is becoming widespread.</p>
<p>"There's an economic price to be paid for the inability to
resolve this conflict," says New Jersey Democrat Robert G.
Torricelli, chairman of a House subcommittee that will hold a
hearing tomorrow on computer security. "We are accomplishing
nothing but losing a foreign market."</p>
<p>RSA Data's products are generally praised by security
experts because they are an advance over traditional
"one-way" encryption. Each user has a secret key, or code,
and a public key published in a directory, and both keys are
produced -- and linked -- by a mathematical formula. Senders
use the addressee's public key to route their messages, and
recipients use their secret key for deciphering. Moreover,
the messages bear "digital signatures," imprinted with the
sender's secret key, which provide proof of the sender's
identity.</p>
<p>RSA Data was founded by three Massachusetts Institute of
Technology professors who invented the approach in 1977.
Because a description of the company's chief invention was
first published in an academic journal, RSA Data's most
important patent isn't enforceable outside the U.S. The
company's revenue, which is less than $5 million annually,
has also been limited by customer unwillingness to spend
money on security and periodic questions about whether RSA
Data's codes can be cracked.</p>
<p>But many security experts say RSA Data's solution is
superior to any of the alternatives. "From a technology
perspective, there really isn't an alternative," says Robert
Schleelein, Digital's manager of strategic relations.</p>
<p>It is unusual for the government to endorse a standard
that requires royalty payments. But such a move may be
justified in this case because "RSA is close to being a de
facto standard," says Dennis Branstad, a computer scientist
at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the
Commerce Department agency that creates technical standards.</p>
<p>An NSA spokeswoman denies the agency harbors any ill will
toward the company. In fact, some experts believe the NSA
uses RSA Data's technology itself, and the spokeswoman says
that "NSA would never go out and say we don't like RSA's
products."</p>
<p>But James Bidzos, RSA Data's chief executive, isn't so
sure. He says that in 1982 the Commerce Department began
considering RSA Data's technology as the basis for a standard
for public-key cryptography. RSA Data was asked to submit
technical information and did so, but it never heard anything
from the department.</p>
<p>The NSA was behind the government's sudden loss of
interest in RSA Data, says a Commerce Department official who
confirms Mr. Bidzos's story. "The project was put on the back
burner" because it was "unclear who was really responsible
for developing standards -- the NSA or us," the official
says.</p>
<p>The NSA has long influenced the civilian use of electronic
security measures, partly by intense political lobbying and
partly through federal limits on the export of cryptographic
products. In 1987, a report by the Office of Technology
Assessment criticized the NSA's sway over civilian uses of
cryptography, saying the agency's actions had been
"inconsistent," and raised questions about "the boundary
between civilian and military authorities."</p>
<p>Seeking to shift some control of computer security,
including cryptography, back to civilians, Congress several
years ago approved a law giving the Commerce Department's
Institute of Standards and Technology the power to set
commercial, non-military standards in the area. Last year,
Rep. Torricelli's subcommittee told the institute to develop
a standard for public-key cryptography but allowed the NSA to
help.</p>
<p>More than a year later, the two agencies still haven't
produced a draft standard. The NSA spokeswoman says the
agency is "cooperating" with the institute, but Rep.
Torricelli thinks the two are deadlocked. "There are
conflicting interests between a perceived need to allow
intelligence agencies to operate freely and (providing)
sufficient protection for our private businesses," he says.</p>
<p>Complicating matters further, the institute seems
ill-equipped to handle the task of forging a new standard,
which is likely to consist of a series of highly technical
proposals. Even the institute's Mr. Branstad concedes that
the department's work has been hampered by a severely
restricted budget.</p>
<p>The obstacles to progress have made some of the
institute's advisers in private industry despair that a
federal standard will ever emerge. But even without one,
industry executives believe that RSA Data's products will
catch on as customers become more security conscious.</p>
<p>Novell, for instance, adopted RSA Data's approach last
month. It made its move, says Richard King, vice president of
software development, because "if you wait around for these
committees to make a decision, you'll go out of business."</p>
