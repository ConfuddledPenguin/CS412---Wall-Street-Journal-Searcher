	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- In a recent telex to all U.S. ambassadors,
Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger urged the
embassies to become more involved in promoting U.S. exports.
Times have changed, he wrote, and "it's no exaggeration to
say that our economic health and our ability to trade
competitively on the world market may be the single most
important component of our national security as we move into
the next century."
   Welcome to the new age. As traditional cold-war diplomacy
subsides, "commercial diplomacy" appears to be on the rise.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, for one, has been
eagerly intervening with foreign governments to try to
advance the cause of U.S. business. The secretary's staff
hands out summaries maintaining that Mr. Mosbacher's personal
interventions with Japanese Minister for International Trade
and Industry Kabun Muto and other Japanese officials have
helped win business for General Datacom Industries, Motorola
Inc., Chrysler Corp., Allied Signal and Toys "R" Us. The
summary also contends Mr. Mosbacher successfully went to bat
against the French for Guardian Industries.</p>
<p>"We've got examples of all -- the president, vice
president, the secretary of state -- making calls to help the
U.S. be competitive," says Mr. Mosbacher, acknowledging that
this is a change in approach from the Reagan years. "The
private sector has got to do the majority, but we in
government can be helpful in a lot of ways." The
administration has also set up a new trade promotion
coordinating committee, an interagency group to help U.S.
business abroad.</p>
<p>Even more significant is the administration's new
willingness, albeit reluctant, to help exporters with
"tied-aid" credits -- a combination of government export
financing and foreign aid. In an unprecedented move, the
Export-Import Bank and the Agency for International
Development recently joined to set up a $500 million pool of
tied-aid funds for projects in Thailand, Indonesia, Pakistan
and the Philippines. The money will be used to provide
cut-rate financing for transportation, power,
telecommunications and construction-equipment projects in
those countries, provided U.S. contractors and equipment are
used. These are already "spoiled markets," explains Ex-Im
Bank President John Macomber, referring to other countries'
liberal use of tied-aid credits in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>To be sure, the U.S. is a laggard in the tied-aid game.
Japan and France in particular have provided their exporters
with generous assistance. From 1984 to 1987, those two
countries offered $14.5 billion in tied-aid credits --
accounting for 41% of all such aid from Western nations. The
U.S., on the other hand, accounted for just over $1 billion.</p>
<p>Some recent studies suggest U.S. businesses have paid
dearly for that imbalance in tied aid. An Ex-Im Bank report
to Congress on tied-aid credits estimated that the U.S. loses
$400 million to $800 million annually in sales because other
countries are more aggressive in using such credits. And
Ernest Preeg of the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, a Washington think tank, puts the lost sales even
higher, at $2.4 billion to $4.8 billion a year.</p>
<p>"In recent years, official export finance is a dimension
of overall U.S. trade competitiveness that has received
low-to-zero priority," Mr. Preeg complains. American economic
aid has rather concentrated on "direct help to the poorest
people and balance of payments support to strategically
important governments rather than on projects that utilize
U.S. exports."</p>
<p>Officially, the Bush administration's position is to curb
such export-related aid, arguing it distorts the free flow of
global trade. In May, the administration initiated a new
round of negotiations at the Paris-based Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development aimed at reducing tied
aid. And Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady told reporters
last week that tied aid is "something that the summiteers
could easily spend some time on" at this week's economic
summit in Houston, Texas. U.S. officials hope the talks will
result in recommendations for reducing government trade aid
by next summer, in time for next year's summit meeting of the
seven leading industrial nations.</p>
<p>"There's no way the tied-aid credit issue is going to be
solved at the trade level," said Mr. Macomber in a recent
interview. "It's got to be at the cabinet or heads of
government level."</p>
<p>In the meantime, as the recent South-east Asian deal
illustrates, the U.S. itself is getting more aggressive about
tied-aid credits. "We've given up trying to set the pace
purely by example," says James Sharpe, the Ex-Im Bank's
executive vice president and U.S. negotiator at the OECD
discussions.</p>
<p>In recent years, the Ex-Im Bank has maintained a "war
chest" -- $110 million in fiscal year 1990 -- designated for
countering the tied-aid credit practices of other
governments. And many in Congress would like the
administration to adopt a much larger tied-aid program, on a
European or Japanese scale. Democratic Senators David Boren
of Oklahoma and Lloyd Bentsen of Texas have even proposed
legislation -- the Aid for Trade Act of 1990 -- that would
tie American foreign assistance to exports. Dubbing the
administration's current program "reactive, piecemeal and
generally ineffective," the senators said "it's time to
adjust to what our economic competitors are doing."</p>
<p>As the push for commercial diplomacy increases, such calls
for tied aid are certain to grow louder. "Trade aid is just
like dope," says Mr. Sharpe. "You get on it and you can't get
off."</p>
