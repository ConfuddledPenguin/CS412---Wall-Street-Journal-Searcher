	<p class="article-leader">A Los Angeles federal judge spared Thomas A. Spiegel from
a government demand to immediately deposit $19 million in an
escrow account, dealing the Office of Thrift Supervision at
least a temporary setback in its landmark case against the
former Columbia Savings & Loan Association executive.
   Columbia, based in Beverly Hills, Calif., is currently
insolvent, reflecting roughly $1 billion in losses and
write-downs of its once lucrative junk-bond portfolio,
developed over the years because of a close relationship
between Mr. Spiegel and former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
junk-bond exponent Michael Milken. Columbia is currently
attempting to sell the bonds to minimize further losses,
although most people believe the government will eventually
seize the thrift.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Federal Judge Stephen Wilson agreed to a
government-requested freeze of the assets of Mr. Spiegel and
his wife and ordered Mr. Spiegel to post a $1 million bond by
this Wednesday. The order allows the couple to continue
paying reasonable living expenses but subjects single
expenditures of more than $5,000 to government review and
possible court challenge.</p>
<p>Last week, the OTS alleged in an administrative complaint
that Mr. Spiegel improperly diverted $19 million in funds
belonging to Columbia for such disparate personal uses as
airplanes, condominiums, guns and concert tickets. The
action, believed to be the largest attempt to obtain
restitution from a thrift executive, also sought a $5 million
civil penalty against Mr. Spiegel. Originally, the OTS had
ordered Mr. Spiegel to meet the escrow demand by noon PDT
last Friday.</p>
<p>At a Friday court hearing, however, lawyers for Mr.
Spiegel argued that the law under which the OTS was
proceeding didn't authorize the agency to obtain funds in
advance of a hearing, especially where the individual being
attacked wasn't any longer an employee of the institution and
a direct threat to its financial well-being. Mr. Spiegel
resigned as Columbia's president and chief executive officer
last December and as a consultant in May.</p>
<p>"Congress intended to give the OTS authority to issue
these kinds of extraordinary orders when it was necessary to
protect the financial integrity of a thrift. That {authority}
does not exist when you have a former officer," asserted
Dennis Perluss, a Los Angeles lawyer for Mr. Spiegel.</p>
<p>While deferring final judgment on the ultimate legal
questions, Judge Wilson said there were enough grounds to
temporarily enjoin the government from requiring the $19
million escrow because "this case clearly raises serious
questions and that the balance of hardships tips sharply in
plaintiff's favor," according to his order. He set a hearing
for July 30 to consider Mr. Spiegel's request for a further
preliminary injunction.</p>
<p>An OTS spokesman said the government was nonetheless
pleased with the financial restraints that the judge imposed
on Mr. Spiegel.</p>
