	<p class="article-leader">HONG KONG -- Despite pleas for leniency and promises of
future cooperation with government investigators, the former
chief of the commercial crime unit of Hong Kong's Legal
Department was sentenced to eight years in prison for
corruption.
   Charles Warwick Reid last month pleaded guilty to a charge
of possessing assets deemed disproportionate to his official
income.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At Friday's sentencing, Hong Kong's chief justice, Sir Ti
Liang Yang, ordered Mr. Reid to pay the local government
HK$12.4 million ($1.6 million), the value of his assets when
he was formally charged in March 1989. Mr. Reid has 28 days
to appeal the court's decision.</p>
<p>Chief Justice Yang allowed a two-year reduction of the
maximum penalty of 10 years because of Mr. Reid's guilty plea
and his willingness to cooperate with the government.</p>
<p>Mr. Reid's lawyer, Anthony Corrigan, Queen's Counsel,
argued that the court's leniency would elicit assistance from
the defendant in bringing other corrupt government officials
and businessmen to trial.</p>
