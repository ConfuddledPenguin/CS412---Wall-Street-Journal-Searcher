	<p class="article-leader">Thanks to Congressman Jack Kemp's legislative program of
tax cuts for millionaires, the U.S. hasn't the fiscal
wherewithal to follow HUD Secretary Jack Kemp's new plans to
help the poor out of poverty ("Liberate America's Other
Economy," editorial page, June 12).
   Urban homesteading, housing vouchers, an expanded
earned-income tax credit and magnet schools all cost money.
Yet with his unrelenting call for a capital-gains tax cut,
Secretary Kemp would ask for even less support for his
program than those with the greatest ability to pay currently
provide.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In real dollars, the median U.S. family income has been
stagnant for more than a decade. The poorest fifth have lost
14% of their buying power since 1978. Meanwhile, the average
real-dollar, after-tax incomes of those in the top 1% have
more than doubled. Would that Secretary Kemp's 1990s advocacy
for the poor also includes a plan to end the debt binge and
the upward wealth transfer that Rep. Jack Kemp loosed upon
the country in the 1980s.</p>

<p>Mr. Kemp's thoughtful, evocative article should be must
reading for all members of Congress and their staffs. It
makes such good sense; it might cause some to stop and think.
Implementation of his suggestions for a national agenda
could, over time, so truly and dramatically improve the lot
of countless millions that even those most responsible for
leading the nation into this sorrowful dilemma will stand and
cheer.</p>

<p>The highlighted text from Mr. Kemp's article referred to a
mother and two children. Among other topics, Mario Cuomo's
solutions, apparently, included redistribution of wealth.</p>
<p>How about a better form of redistribution? How about a
redistribution of the children? Fathers typically make more
than mothers, so why not routinely grant the custody of their
own children to them? We live in a society of strange values,
in my opinion, when we automatically grant custody to the
parent earning less income (or none at all), and then bleat
that our nation's children are living in poverty.</p>
