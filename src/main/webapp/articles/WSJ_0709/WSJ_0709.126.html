	<p class="article-leader">A SHADOW WILL HANG over Houston as it has over all the
previous summits -- the shadow of the have-nots who haven't
been invited to debate with the haves.
   But this year's shadow will throw matters into a relief
starker than usual. Since last year's summit, walls have
tumbled, dictators have fallen, and the hopes and demands of
the underdeveloped have soared. The opening of Eastern Europe
has propelled a new batch of poorer countries into the aid
scramble, competing for limited assistance with the
traditional lineup of African, Latin American and Asian
countries. And there's a new twist: With everybody rushing to
help the new kids on the block, the long-poorer sections of
richer countries -- such as big chunks of rural Spain -- fear
they will lose aid and investment to the East.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Western aid to the Soviet Union as a way to shore up
Mikhail Gorbachev's reform program will be hotly debated in
Houston. The French and Germans are pushing hard for a big,
rapid injection of cash -- $20 billion has been suggested --
while the U.S. so far is being more cautious but may
ultimately go along.</p>
<p>Every political "victory" brings with it new demands for
rebuilding -- not just Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union,
but also Panama, Nicaragua, Vietnam, and on and on. The
unprecedented prosperity of the summit countries has led to
unprecedented demands to help an unprecedented number of
countries, as well as to eradicate poverty and unemployment
at home.</p>
<p>Who's going to pay for it all?</p>
<p>Carlo De Benedetti, the canny chairman of Ing. C. Olivetti
& Co. has no doubt who's going to pay for Eastern Europe.
"Communism has gone, but the problems remain," he says. "The
only answer is the infusion of the market economy into the
East. Who will pay the bill? We will pay the bill. We will
print more money and raise interest rates to finance those
countries. The long-term, but only very long-term, effects
will be positive. But first we have to pay, then maybe we'll
see results."</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the prospect of paying doesn't appeal to
most Western Europeans. According to surveys done for the
European Community, 57% of West Germans say they don't want
to sacrifice any part of their living standards to raise
those of East Germans; only 25% said they would be willing to
give up 5% of their income to help East Germany. (When the
source of funds is more general, Europeans are more generous.
Another EC survey found that 59% of West Europeans favored
the EC's increasing its budget to aid the East, although only
30% wanted funds diverted from EC aid programs for Southern
Europe.)</p>
<p>"I fear that regarding the Third World, and especially
Africa, the West is going to close up more and more," says
Piero Bassetti, chairman of the Federation of Italian
Chambers of Commerce. "There will be 100 million new workers
along the southern rim of the Mediterranean in the next five
years. The problem is too expensive to solve by aid."</p>
<p>Some aid, of course, will be available. It's just that
even big numbers pale before the costs of bringing everybody
up to Western living standards. The summit countries recently
agreed to increase the International Monetary Fund's capital
by 50%, to $180 billion, making more money available for
Third World countries. The EC itself recently raised its aid
package to sub-Saharan Africa to $14 billion over five years,
and then more than doubled its aid to North Africa, to more
than $1.5 billion for the five years ending in 1996.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the EC's haves are pledged to give its
have-nots -- mainly Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland --
more than $15 billion a year in aid for roads, sewers and
factories. That's part of the deal that got the smaller
countries to agree to the EC's program to abolish most
intra-EC trade barriers by the end of 1992.</p>
<p>But it's clearly Eastern Europe that has become the focus
of the industrialized world's attentions. That's partly for
political reasons -- to cement the victory of the free market
over the planned economy. But it's also for commercial
reasons -- it is a potential big new market and source of
cheap labor. The recently approved European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development will channel more than $11
billion in aid mainly to private industry in Eastern
countries, including the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The Houston summit will give another chance for those most
involved to talk over how best to help. At last year's
summit, the EC's Executive Commission (whose president,
Jacques Delors, attends the summits along with four EC member
states, Germany, France, Britain and Italy) was given the
task of coordinating about $12 billion of aid to Poland and
Hungary if those countries moved toward democracy. This
year's summit is expected to increase that aid and add
Czechoslovakia and perhaps Bulgaria to the program.</p>
<p>All of this aid is supposed to help do something that's
never been done before -- that is, turn stultified Communist
economies into vibrant free-market ones -- by building new
roads, training managers and buying new equipment. But it
won't even begin to tackle an even more ominous and costly
legacy of the past 50 years: the horrifying environmental
mess in most of these countries. German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl will press his summit colleagues to set up a special
fund to pay for the cleanup. But the costs will be
staggering. The EC estimates that just reducing by one-half
the level of pollution in the river Elbe in East Germany
would cost more than $17 billion. The total cost of cleaning
up all of Eastern Europe has so far defied a reliable
estimate.</p>
<p>But although the precise costs remain unclear, the East's
expectations aren't. Poland's Solidarity leader, Lech Walesa,
has said that if Poland's experiment with democracy fails, it
will be at least in part because the West didn't give enough
economic aid. Laszlo Lang, deputy director of the Hungarian
Institute for International Affairs, says that after 45 years
of fruitless Soviet domination, Eastern Europe now actively
wants to be dominated by the EC. "Our best chance for
economic survival is to come under the hegemony of a united
EC that includes Germany." He adds: "We don't want Western
Europe or America to throw loans at us -- we've already got
too much debt -- but rather to invest in industrial projects
and to help us make our currencies convertible."</p>
<p>Hungary's new prime minister, Jozsef Antall, says his
country wants to join the EC, thus making Western Europe
directly responsible for raising Hungarians' living standards
to those of the other EC members. (Technically, all European
countries, East or West, can apply to join the EC.) The EC --
already faced with applications from Turkey and Austria --
says it can't take any new members before 1992, and probably
not before 2000. Instead, it is busily signing association
and aid agreements aimed at stalling formal membership
demands.</p>
<p>But this tactic has the poorer EC members worried. Spain,
Portugal and Greece were all admitted to EC membership in the
early 1980s, largely to shore up their fragile democracies.
They've all benefited from joining but haven't received all
they've been promised. Says Mario Antao, a Portuguese
economist: "I fear the needs of the Eastern countries will be
far, far higher than publicly announced, and the only way to
meet these needs will be to cut into the structural funds
earmarked for countries like Portugal and Greece." He adds:
"There's no doubt that aiding the East is correct and that in
the long run all of Europe will benefit. But in the medium
term there will be nasty disputes over sharing out this aid.
When the present EC aid program expires in 1993, Portugal
will ask for more money. Will we get it?"</p>
<p>But not everyone sees a problem. Some economists say the
West should concentrate on how much money the East could
sensibly use without horribly distorting its economies or
overheating the world system, rather than worry about how
much the East is asking for. Ernst-Moritz Lipp, chief
economist for West Germany's Dresdner Bank, has calculated
that all of Eastern Europe (excluding the Soviet Union) could
absorb a maximum of $65 billion a year in aid and investment,
a number he calls "trivial" when compared with the U.S.
budget deficit of more than $100 billion or the big West
German annual trade surplus. With the European capital
markets able to raise more than $300 billion a year for
companies and countries, "$65 billion a year won't crowd out
Spain or Portugal or anybody else," Mr. Lipp says.</p>
<p>In addition, he says, rapid economic growth in East
Germany and the other Eastern countries, fueled by one-time
productivity gains on the order of 15% when factories are
reorganized and new machines brought in, will quickly
generate money that can be reinvested, so the dependence on
Western help will fall off.</p>
<p>Eberhard von Kuenheim, chairman of auto maker BMW, says
West Germany wouldn't have problems paying for East Germany's
refurbishment, even if nobody else helped. Citing the fact
that West German companies invested the equivalent of about
$60 billion outside the country last year alone, he says
confidently: "We can afford it. It's not a question of money.
It's a problem of speed -- to switch from one system to
another." The West German government has proposed a $70
billion fund to help East Germany through 1994.</p>
<p>But according to East German officials, they're going to
need every pfennig and more. Juergen Klose, an East German
economist, says every day new astronomical estimates are
coming in for rebuilding the devastated economy. His current
estimates: $20 billion to rebuild the phone system, $250
billion for new roads, and $30 billion to create an
agricultural market economy.</p>
<p>As a start, Mr. Klose says, the united Germany should ask
that what used to be East Germany be classified as an
underdeveloped region of the EC, and ask for $5 billion a
year from the EC. That request would be more than a third of
all EC aid money now earmarked for Spain, Portugal, Greece
and Ireland.</p>
