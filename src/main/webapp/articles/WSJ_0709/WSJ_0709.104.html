	<p class="article-leader">SKOKIE, Ill. -- Brunswick Corp. said it plans to close
eight plants and lay off 610 workers in response to "ongoing
softness in the demand for marine products."
   This maker of pleasure boats said the moves are a
continuation in its consolidation process, started last fall.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Brunswick said the employee cutbacks will affect 8% of the
work force in two of its largest divisions, the U.S. Marine
and the Sea Ray. It expects to take action within the next
two months.</p>
<p>The company said it plans to close four of its U.S. Marine
division's boatbuilding plants on Sept. 10. It will also
close a plant that produces component parts.</p>
<p>As a result of those five plant closings, Brunswick said
350 workers will be laid off. The plants' current production
operations will be transferred to the U.S. Marine division's
remaining 15 plants.</p>
<p>Also, Brunswick said its Sea Ray division is laying off
260 employees at three plants, but the plants' production
operations will continue.</p>
<p>The company said that these actions will not hurt its 1990
financial results. Instead, it anticipates that "they will
improve efficiencies and cut costs."</p>
