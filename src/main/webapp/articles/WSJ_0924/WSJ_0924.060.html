	<p class="article-leader">NEW BRIGHTON, South Africa -- Mkhuseli Jack, one of the
generals in the economic war against white minority rule,
points through the dusk to what appears to be a junkyard of
plywood and tin. A woman balancing a baby on her back and a
sheet of corrugated iron on her head disappears into the
mess. It is her home.
   "Squatters," says Mr. Jack. "Four or five weeks ago, those
shacks weren't there."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The battlefield inspection continues. Unemployed men, both
young and old, loiter in small groups on every corner. Flimsy
shanties, some merely a patchwork of cardboard billboards --
"whiter whites, brighter brights," says a detergent ad now
part of a living room wall -- occupy every available space.</p>
<p>Mr. Jack winces at the price of victory. "Sanctions," he
admits, "have required a sacrifice."</p>
<p>South Africa's present recession, hastened by
international trade and financial sanctions against Pretoria
for its policies of racial segregation, has hit the blighted
black townships of Port Elizabeth particularly hard. So has
corporate disinvestment. When Ford and General Motors left
town four years ago, 6,500 people lost their jobs. Most of
them are still unemployed today.</p>
<p>Mr. Jack turns another corner. More jobless, more
squatters, more shacks. "We must act quickly to end this
sacrifice," he says. "We don't want to inherit a country in
ruins."</p>
<p>The sanctions sword is turning against its blacksmith. The
African National Congress, South Africa's main black
liberation group, forged its sanctions strategy as a means of
pressuring the government to abandon white-minority rule.
And, to this end, it has worked. Earlier this year, President
F.W. de Klerk, desperate to return South Africa to
international acceptability, unbanned the ANC and other
political groups, released ANC leader Nelson Mandela from 27
years in prison, began repealing segregation laws and opened
negotiations with the ANC designed to lead to a new
constitution and black-white power sharing. Today Mr. de
Klerk, carrying a report on his reforms, will be the first
South African head of state to visit the White House in
nearly half a century.</p>
<p>Having thus prodded the government into action, sanctions
now are prodding the ANC. Back home after 30 years in exile,
the ANC is swamped with its impoverished constituency's
rising expectations for improved living conditions. The ANC,
now a partner with the government in shaping the country's
future, is eager to restructure the economy to better meet
black needs, an overhaul that will rely heavily on foreign
investment. But it can't begin as long as measures designed
to punish the economy and isolate South Africa are still in
place. And many countries, such as the U.S., have locked in
their sanctions until the ANC says it is satisfied with
current negotiations between the government and the black
opposition.</p>
<p>Thus, the ANC finds itself under pressure to move as
swiftly as possible in the talks; it hopes significant
progress can be made by the end of the year. To boost
negotiation prospects, the ANC last month took the initiative
to suspend its guerrilla war. Mr. Mandela also says the
organization may settle for a "statement of intent" from the
government on the shape of a new constitution, rather than
actual progress, as a trigger for the lifting of sanctions.</p>
<p>"The realization of the damage that sanctions would do to
the economy, and to social stability, if they continue to be
applied has brought both the government and the ANC to their
senses," says Ronald Bethlehem, an economist at one of the
country's big mining houses. "Neither are prepared to accept
the long-term costs of sanctions."</p>
<p>After more than five years of sanctions, applied in
varying degrees by individual countries, and after a huge
exodus of direct investment by U.S. corporations, the costs
are adding up. The cutting off of financial credits from the
major Western banks has triggered a net capital outflow of
more than $10 billion, mainly through debt repayment. Efforts
to hold down imports to finance these payments have strangled
growth. Black unemployment, high even before sanctions and
disinvestment, is rising by at least 200,000 a year. Without
foreign aid, development programs, such as low-cost housing,
are sputtering. More than seven million squatters, fully
one-quarter of the black population, encircle the country's
urban areas.</p>
<p>In some ways, the First World component of the economy --
driven by the white-owned gold, diamond and platinum mines --
has perversely benefited from sanctions. Local companies and
businessmen snapped up disinvesting companies at fire-sale
prices. New trade routes, plied by sanctions-busting
entrepreneurs, opened almost as soon as others closed. The
country's export base actually widened, thanks to government
incentives. Industries neglected in the past have blossomed;
in response to the arms embargo against it, the country has
become one of the world's largest weapons makers.</p>
<p>The net result has been to widen the already huge gap
between whites and blacks. The staggering black unemployment
-- more than 50% in some areas -- has sharpened workplace
tensions; more than 1.2 million man-days were lost during the
first half of this year because of strikes, triple the level
of last year. Moreover, the housing crisis is fueling
township unrest. Squatter camps and migrant labor dormitories
have been the flashpoints of the recent orgy of political
violence, which has left nearly 800 blacks dead.</p>
<p>"I shudder when I see the black economy," says Roger
Matlock, the Port Elizabeth director of the Urban Foundation,
a privately funded development agency working toward a
post-apartheid South Africa. "It has never been worse."</p>
<p>That certainly is true at the S.O.S. Old Aged Soup Kitchen
for the Needy Children.</p>
<p>Long gone are the glorious days when a surprise delivery
of hot food from the Ford canteen would add a veritable feast
to the usual ladel of soup. These days it's just soup and
bread, bread and soup. The old wood-burning stove donated by
General Motors in 1981 has seen better days. And when, wonder
the old women of the neighborhood, was the last time they
gathered for a sewing bee, turning the automakers' scrap
cloth and leather into dresses and Bible covers? The memory
fades.</p>
<p>"My Americans, they looked after me," says 87-year-old
Daisy Davids as she shows off the GM stove puffing away at
the foot of her bed in her rickety two-room shack in the
"colored," or mixed race, part of Port Elizabeth. "I was so
sorry to see them go."</p>
<p>Ford left town lock, stock and hubcap in 1985, first
merging with a Pretoria-based auto maker, then disinvesting
entirely. General Motors left a year later by selling to
local managers. The departures were hailed by anti-apartheid
activists as the crowning glories of the disinvestment
campaign. But they devastated Port Elizabeth, which at the
time was known as the Detroit of South Africa.</p>
<p>GM's successor, Delta Motors, is making a profit,
something that eluded GM here for years, but it is doing so
with about 1,500 fewer workers. Ford left 5,000 people
unemployed. The companies' contributions to community
development programs vanished. In the cruelest irony, Ford's
recreation center near the black townships was taken over by
the police; some activists who among other things advocated
disinvestment were later detained and interrogated there.</p>
<p>Mrs. Davids sits on a chair in front of her shack and
squints at the bottom line. "The government is finally
talking to our people. This is very good," she says. "But
what about my children?" Inside, two bags of powdered soup
lean against a wall, below a painting of the Last Supper.</p>
<p>Her "children," some of them sons and daughters of former
Ford and GM workers, flock to the S.O.S. kitchen from the
school across the street. For most, a cup of soup will be
their only hot meal of the day.</p>
<p>"I feel it is my duty to worry about them," says Mrs.
Davids. "Nobody else does." Suddenly, her tired eyes brighten
with a flash of optimism. "My Americans," she wonders, "do
you think they will ever come back?"</p>
<p>Across town, Welfit Oddy no longer worries about that
question. One of the area's prominent white businessmen, he
leans back in his office chair, satisfied that he has beaten
all that the world beyond South Africa's borders can throw at
him. Disinvestment and sanctions should have ruined him.
Instead, he is prospering as never before.</p>
<p>"I remember saying back then that a lot of people will
benefit from this," he says now.</p>
<p>In 1985, his family's company, which began as a wagon
builder in Port Elizabeth nearly a century ago, was making
150 bodies a day for Ford pickups and trucks. It was 25% of
his business and, based on assurances from Ford that it
wouldn't disinvest, he had just built a new factory. But Ford
went anyway.</p>
<p>"It was a shock," he says. "The country was in the middle
of a recession, and then they take off." He cut his work
force and scrambled to diversify away from the auto industry.
As his losses mounted, he settled on the production of
stainless steel transport containers. He found an export
market and business has boomed.</p>
<p>"If Ford hadn't gone and this opportunity presented
itself, I might have sat back and said, `No, I'm quite
happy.' As it is, I'm pleased Ford went," says Mr. Oddy.
"When the whole world is against you, you've got to survive."</p>
<p>Outside the factory gates, the squatter shacks from the
black township across the road continue their inexorable
advance toward his property. The mixed-race community down in
the valley is in flames; riots over living conditions will
kill more than 40 over the next two days. Production suffers
as workers take off to defend their homes. Meanwhile, the
recently unbanned South African Communist Party canvasses the
factory floor with the rhetoric of "workers control."</p>
<p>Mr. Oddy manages a withering smile. Is it possible, he
wonders, to beat the world but lose at home?</p>
<p>In the cold office of the Unemployed Workers Union in
downtown Port Elizabeth, ten black men, who know all about
losing, sit upright and proud on white plastic chairs. In the
anti-apartheid crusade, some of their comrades were killed,
others were imprisoned, many went into exile. These men lost
their jobs. They were all Ford workers.</p>
<p>"We aren't ashamed of sanctions. It is our contribution to
the struggle," says Michael Qwesha, a young man with
dreadlocks flowing from beneath a black beret. The beret is
embroidered with the hammer and sickle logo of the South
African Communist Party; a button -- "ANC leads, ANC lives"
-- dangles from his sweater. After he lost his job, he says,
he was arrested and detained without charge for three years
for his anti-apartheid activity. He has been free, and
unemployed, for a year now.</p>
<p>"Whatever steps the government has taken," he says, "have
been because of us, the masses."</p>
<p>But beneath the pride there is ironic bitterness. In
unison, the men say that Ford and GM and all the other
disinvesting companies were right to leave, but wrong in the
way they did it. The severance packages, they grumble,
weren't enough to compensate for the coming years of
unemployment.</p>
<p>"During our time of working we never had anything to save,
anything to put away," says Johnny Mke, who worked for Ford
for 22 years. Adds Prince Parlie: "They didn't give us any
warning. We were building our future, our children's future,
on Ford."</p>
<p>That is the problem with capitalists, says Patrick Shwempe
of the Unemployed Workers Union, which seeks to organize the
jobless into a political force. "Unemployment wasn't just
caused by sanctions and disinvestment, although that added to
it," he says. "Unemployment is a creation of capitalism, to
hold over the heads of workers who want to strike."</p>
<p>Still, the 10 men would welcome the capitalists back
tomorrow. They are eager to get back to work. "We have the
skills they need," says Mr. Mke. "We can be the Detroit of
South Africa again."</p>
<p>It is the ANC that now must contend with these rising
expectations.</p>
<p>"Every resident in the area is expecting an ANC government
to quickly improve the situation," says Michael Xego, the
ANC's publicity officer in the Port Elizabeth area. "But no
one can expect the shacks, the unemployment, to just go away,
poof, overnight."</p>
<p>Where once the ANC sought to exploit the impoverished
township conditions to create social instability --
"ungovernability" was the revolutionary word -- it is now
desperate to maintain stability. "We are going to inherit
most of the problems here," says Michael Ndube of the ANC's
youth branch.</p>
<p>He catalogs the poverty around him. Unemployment is
running at 50%. An average of 20 families a day are moving
into the city, each looking for a job and a house. The
shortage of classrooms is so severe that existing schools are
being used in shifts; one group of students in the morning,
another in the afternoon.</p>
<p>"We have to do things now," says Mr. Jack, turning up
another street and explaining why the ANC decided to suspend
its armed struggle ahead of all its demands being met. "If we
delay, things only get worse."</p>
<p>Another corner, another squatter neighborhood. "It's very
difficult giving the ordinary people what they need with
limited resources," he says. "The needs of our people are so
great."</p>
