	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Richard Roberts, President Bush's nominee to
the Securities and Exchange Commission, voiced support for a
plan that would leave regulation of controversial stock-index
futures with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
   The plan, being floated on Capitol Hill, is an alternative
to White House-sponsored legislation that would shift index
futures to the SEC.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Stock-index futures, often used in computerized
program-trading strategies, allow investors to bet on the
move of a basket of stocks without owning the actual shares.</p>
<p>Mr. Roberts's stance, expressed at his confirmation
hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, is significant
because it would swing the balance on the SEC. Agency
Chairman Richard Breeden strongly favors a jurisdiction
shift, as does Commissioner Philip Lochner Jr. But Edward
Fleischman has voted against any such power transfer, and
Mary Schapiro has endorsed a third plan that would merge the
two agencies.</p>
<p>The administration's plan, severely weakened by strong
opposition from the Chicago futures exchanges and Capitol
Hill Agriculture committees that oversee the CFTC, appears
dead for this legislative session. Moreover, without solid
backing from the SEC, it's unlikely Congress will press ahead
with the plan and might focus exclusively on a compromise
next year.</p>
<p>At the hearing, Mr. Roberts also offered support for
another tenet of the Capitol Hill alternative -- a provision
to shift the regulation of margins on stock-index futures to
the Federal Reserve Board. Margins -- the good-faith money
needed to trade the futures -- currently are set by the
exchanges, with the CFTC allowed to intervene only in
specifically defined emergencies. A similar switch is
included in the administration's proposal.</p>
<p>Mr. Roberts also told the senators that he "intends to
improve communications with the CFTC" and create a "better
spirit of cooperation" between the futures agency and the
SEC.</p>
<p>The committee is expected to approve his nomination this
week, after which he isn't likely to have any difficulty
passing the full Senate. Mr. Roberts, 39 years old, is a
former top staffer for Sen. Richard Shelby (D., Ala.), a
Banking Committee member who was one of only two senators to
quiz Mr. Roberts at the hearing. The questioning was friendly
and generally supportive of the conservative Democrat from
both Sen. Shelby and committee Chairman Donald Riegle (D.,
Mich.).</p>
<p>Mr. Roberts wondered whether the SEC was doing enough to
confront "front-running," which frequently involves trading
in futures or stocks in front of a large order in the other
market. He said he is concerned that the SEC isn't generating
many of its own cases, instead relying on the exchanges to
provide referrals. The SEC hasn't been able to bring
front-running cases, and the agency contends that's because
it can track only the stock side of the transaction and not
the futures side.</p>
<p>Mr. Roberts focused largely on Wall Street-related
problems in his testimony. Asked what his biggest enforcement
priorities were, the nominee said they were "rooting out
insider trading, stopping penny-stock fraud" and slowing
fraudulent investment advisers.</p>
