	<p class="article-leader">WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. -- RJR Nabisco Inc., which already has
plans to ship 14 billion cigarettes to the Soviet Union, said
it agreed to ship an additional 3.2 billion smokes.
   The food and tobacco company, controlled by Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts & Co., also said it agreed in principle to
expanded long-term cooperation with the Soviet tobacco
industry. The agreement includes technical assistance to
improve manufacturing facilities throughout the Soviet Union.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts estimated RJR's original plan to provide 14
billion cigarettes to the Soviets would generate about $40
million in operating profit. In 1989, RJR's operating profit
from tobacco exports totaled $328 million. The company
declined to comment on the original estimate, or to project
what the added tobacco shipments might contribute to
earnings.</p>
<p>RJR said the first air-freight shipments of cigarettes are
expected to begin this week, with cigarettes arriving on
Soviet shelves before the end of the month. Shipments of the
total 17.2 billion cigarettes, the company said, will
continue over the next 12 months.</p>
