	<p class="article-leader">Your Aug. 22 page-one article on computer "hackers"
continues a longstanding malignment of an important group.
Those of us who call ourselves hackers, and who go to the
annual Hackers' Conference, are upstanding citizens, many the
discoverers of key technologies and founders of important
companies in Silicon Valley. The term "hacker" as we use it
means, essentially, someone who works fiercely on problems
and ideas, without regard to normal schedules of meals and
sleep.
   The people the press calls "hackers" are criminals who
break into computer systems. This use came about when Donn
Parker of Stanford used the term to reporters, which he now
regrets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>We ethical hackers consider "hacker" a badge of honor, as
it is used in the true Hacker Community, and we are not about
to change the word. So we ask that you at least give the
legitimate meaning of the word an equal presentation.</p>
