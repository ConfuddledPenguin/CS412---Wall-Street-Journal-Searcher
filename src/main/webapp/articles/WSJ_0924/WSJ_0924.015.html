	<p class="article-leader">FRANKFURT, West Germany -- Auto production in West Germany
climbed 16% in August to 309,000 from 266,784 a year earlier,
boosted by a higher number of work days, but fell 2% when
adjusted for the extra days, the West German Automobile
Association said.
   Because holiday-related plant closings last year fell
earlier in the summer than this year, there were 16.5 work
days in August, up from 14 days in August 1989.</p>
