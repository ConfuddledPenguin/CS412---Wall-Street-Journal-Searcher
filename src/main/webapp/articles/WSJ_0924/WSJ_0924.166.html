	<p class="article-leader">My husband, Phil, and I own Racing Strollers Inc., the
manufacturer of the Baby Jogger, our patented stroller for
runners. We are perhaps a parody of an entrepreneurial
company; Phil had the proverbial "light-bulb" experience that
gave him the idea for the stroller, and we started the
business on our kitchen table. In the early years, we usually
went about things the hard way. Our travails in getting
product liability insurance are an example.
   We sold our first Baby Jogger in early 1984, and by the
end of the year it occurred to us that we might want some
insurance. I called three or four agents, put it on a back
burner, and eventually noticed that none had called me back.
Doesn't that seem odd, an insurance agent who doesn't call
back? When I finally got through to one, she told me that her
company did provide product liability insurance, but they
just weren't interested in anything to do with babies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Some time passed. The insurance question came up again.
After all, we hadn't gone under yet] Maybe it was time to act
like a real company and have liability insurance. Besides, a
lot of our customers buying Baby Joggers seemed to be
lawyers. For some unknown reason, they liked to call us up
and give us free legal advice, which boiled down to "wait
till someone in Taiwan rips you off" and "boy, are you ever
going to get sued someday." Usually they would sum it up by
saying that it was so risky to be in business that no
sensible person would ever do this.</p>
<p>So we were feeling a little more nervous, and I made
another round of calls to insurance agents. This time I
called around 10 of them -- everyone in the Yellow Pages who
had an ad mentioning business insurance. By now we realized
that we had to do a little selling on this, so I would
mention that we had an impeccable safety record, we met all
the regulations for strollers and that our first two dealers
had been pediatricians. I offered to bring in letters from
pediatricians and other physicians who were using our
stroller and not only felt it was safe, but also more stable
than other strollers because of its tripod-shaped base. Not a
nibble.</p>
<p>The very few agents that I could get through to told me
that it didn't really matter what proofs we could come up
with: Since it involved little babies, no one would ever
touch it.</p>
<p>Another year went by, the business was starting to support
us, and I made yet another fruitless round of calls. Now we
ran into another wrinkle.</p>
<p>In 1986, we moved into our first real office and
warehouse, and our landlord asked us very nicely to get
business insurance so that he wouldn't get sued if someone
slipped on our steps. "Oh sure," we thought, "certainly we
can get this kind of insurance." After all, we'd always had
car and house insurance, our credit rating was fine and all
those little businesses one passes by in our town had regular
business insurance. Why not us?</p>
<p>Wrong] This time a few agents called back voluntarily.
Gee, they really wished they could help out. It really was
too bad, but the courts had a nasty habit of ruling that if
an agency insured a company for fire, theft or premises
liability, then they were also responsible if anything went
wrong with the product. We offered to write a very specific
release. "Wouldn't do any good," we were told. Luckily, our
landlord didn't throw us out.</p>
<p>A few months later, my husband took our insurance needs
out to bid once more. We were really excited when we heard a
company was interested in writing it up. Then the bid came
in: $60,000. This was a year that our sales were half a
million, with a loss of $28,000. We never thought we'd pass
up the chance to have product liability and business
insurance. But our rapid growth was killing the cash flow
anyway without this added burden.</p>
<p>We were starting to run into some nasty consequences of
not having the insurance. It may have been one reason we had
such difficulties getting bank financing at that time -- why
should a bank get involved when one lawsuit could mean our
demise? We had almost gotten the stroller into the Sharper
Image Catalog, certainly a major thrill for two young
entrepreneurs. Then we lost Sharper Image at the last minute.
We hadn't the practical experience with catalogs at that time
to know that they all require product vendor insurance.
(Sharper Image did pick the stroller up later on.)</p>
<p>At this same time, we had begun to work with a very
experienced businessman and consultant, Bill Blair. He had
horror stories of how customers had sued his hotels for
things like getting drunk and falling off the balcony, and he
told us that it wasn't a matter of virtue or whether we made
a good stroller. It was simply a matter of when. He said:
"Don't wonder if you're going to be sued. Just wonder when."
This was news to us; we had been naive enough to think that
if we just did our very best, and put lots of sensible
cautions in our literature, we would be protected. (Can you
hear me knocking on every piece of wood in my office?)</p>
<p>Finally, in 1987, a local Conover Insurance agent, Dave
Helm, took our policy to blessed American States Insurance.
It came in with a bid for $8,000, and we jumped for it. For a
long time we thought that the reason we obtained coverage was
because we had passed the magic fourth year in business. But
this week I asked Dave Helm if that was what made the
difference, and he laughed and said: "No, I had to really go
to bat for you. The other companies I sent it to all thought
I was crazy to want to insure you."</p>
<p>If there is a lesson to be learned in all of this for the
company desperate for insurance, it is that there is always
someone who will say yes if you knock on enough doors. But
you must be persistent. We went from assuming that insurance
was our natural right to realizing that, at least in the case
of liability, you have to "sell" your case to the agent just
as you sell your product. We offered customer letters,
physician references and results of safety tests. We were
even obsequious when that was appropriate. Was it worth it?</p>
<p>After we got our insurance, we could really sleep easy for
the first time, knowing that all our hard work had a chance
of surviving. You have no idea how great it feels to say,
"Sure, we're covered]"</p>
