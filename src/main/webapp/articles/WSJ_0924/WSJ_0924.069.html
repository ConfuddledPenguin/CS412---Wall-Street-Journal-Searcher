	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The Soviet Union's chief accountant expects to
issue new standards for all enterprises by June, and he wants
to set up a professional group resembling the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
   At a meeting organized by Ernst & Young here, Nicholai
Panteleev, chief accountant for the Soviet Ministry of
Finance, also said that by early next year he hopes to make
some other rules changes regarding accounting for joint
ventures. Mr. Panteleev heads the accounting rule-making body
in the Soviet Union.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the most part, Soviet accounting is predicated on a
centralized form of government. The Soviet accounting system
"now resembles an army code," Mr. Panteleev said. He said he
would like to make the system "more democratic," and he wants
to pass some of the functions that the government handles to
an outside group.</p>
<p>With the current system, "if it directs to turn right, one
can't possibly turn left," he said. The current accounting
model was designed "strictly to forward the plans and
direction of the government," Mr. Panteleev said. Current
standards "are largely used for economic statistics as
opposed to financial reporting," said James Searing, national
director of Ernst & Young's international business services.</p>
<p>The government only recently allowed joint ventures to
record revenue on an accrual rather than a cash basis. In the
past, an enterprise would have to actually receive a cash
payment before it could record a sale. Although Mr. Panteleev
didn't specify what the joint-venture changes might be, one
might be to also move expense accounting to accrual from a
cash basis.</p>
<p>Mr. Panteleev said his goal is to bring Soviet accounting
rules closer to internationally accepted standards. But it is
difficult to envision a Soviet accounting system until
questions about how a free-market economy will work are
answered. And those questions, Mr. Panteleev said, are best
left to the politicians.</p>
<p>Mr. Panteleev said the biggest challenge seems to be to
establish a system of auditing and review, such as the one
that operates in the U.S. The concept of auditing didn't
exist in the Soviet Union until recently.</p>
<p>"Under new market conditions, there will be a great
necessity to have an independent body to exercise control,"
Mr. Panteleev said. "The issue of accounting management is
connected directly with the issue of any market standard," he
said.</p>
<p>Mr. Panteleev visited the Securities and Exchange
Commission and apparently was impressed. The SEC has
statutory authority to establish accounting and reporting
standards for public companies, though it has largely left
that role to the private sector. The SEC also enforces the
rules.</p>
<p>Mr. Panteleev said he would like to create a private
organization similar to the AICPA for licensing. But he
didn't say when that might happen.</p>
<p>Other issues involve developing standards that are more
similar to those the rest of the world uses. A task force of
the United Nations Centre on Transnational Corporations has
been advising the Soviet Union on how to accomplish this
goal, and it has provided expertise on international
accounting standards.</p>
<p>Mr. Panteleev also sees re-educating professionals as a
major goal. The Soviet Union has about two million
bookkeepers and about 300,000 in-house chief accountants.
"They have to move from a bookkeeping culture to an
accounting profession," said Mr. Searing of Ernst & Young.</p>
