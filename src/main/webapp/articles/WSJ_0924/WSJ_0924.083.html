	<p class="article-leader">Authoritative new estimates show that members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are pumping
enough oil to forestall -- at least until winter --
world-wide energy shortages because of the Middle East
crisis.
   However, rising prices are building political pressures to
tap stockpiles such as the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve
even though these were established as buffers against
physical shortages, not volatile markets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Total OPEC output has rebounded from the August low of
19.7 million barrels a day to 22 million barrels a day or
more for September. That level generally hadn't been expected
until October.</p>
<p>The extra oil is coming mainly from Saudi Arabia, the
United Arab Emirates and Venezuela. It's enough to replace
three-fourths of the four million barrels a day of embargoed
Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil.</p>
<p>Demand for OPEC's oil still is higher than its output,
partly as a result of panic buying. But rising flow rates
combined with high world inventories make it unlikely that
the International Energy Agency's emergency oil-sharing
mechanism will be triggered when the governing board of 21
oil-consuming nations meets again in Paris Friday.</p>
<p>The increased output doesn't bar individual nations from
dipping into their strategic oil reserves to alleviate high
prices. Nor does it completely rule out a possible supply
crunch later this year. "It's going to be a touch-and-go
winter," said Thomas A. Petrie of Petrie Parkman & Co., a
Denver investment firm specializing in energy. "We could
still see some pretty tight conditions in November and
December in some fuels."</p>
<p>It's true that supplies of some petroleum products --
including kerosene, jet fuel and naphtha, a petrochemical
feedstock -- already are tight in some areas, particularly in
regions of the Persian Gulf and Asia. "This reflects the loss
of Kuwait refining capacity and the added demands associated
with the military buildup in the Gulf," Cambridge Energy
Research Associates reported Friday.</p>
<p>But crude oil supplies are ample everywhere even though
some refiners worry that some oil replacing the lost Iraqi
petroleum is of lower quality. In the U.S., according to the
latest count by the Department of Energy, crude oil
inventories total 373.1 million barrels, 35 million above the
year-earlier level. And in Europe, according to Energy
Security Analysis Inc., crude oil inventories are 25 million
barrels higher than they were a year ago.</p>
<p>Energy Security Analysis is a Washington-based firm that
monitors oil supplies world-wide. It estimates that at the
end of August commercial onshore inventories of crude oil and
chief petroleum products totaled 2.93 billion barrels. That
was 87 million barrels above the year-earlier level. If
government stockpiles are included, total global inventories
were 113 million barrels higher than a year ago.</p>
<p>"We've seen no statistical evidence that inventories are
being drawn down significantly," said Sarah Emerson, a vice
president of Energy Security Analysis. Still, she said, the
surplus is getting smaller just as demand increases
seasonally. "No one is going to run out of crude," she said,
"but in a month or two we could start having problems on
products."</p>
<p>Oil markets appear to be expecting severe disruptions of
supplies. Petroleum prices underscore that sentiment. They
continued their run-up last week, reaching a nine-year high
of more than $35 a barrel.</p>
<p>On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the futures price of
crude oil for November delivery settled Friday at $35.43 a
barrel -- up $2.01 a barrel for the day and $4.27 a barrel
for the week. Gasoline and heating oil futures also continued
to show sizzling gains, each advancing toward $1 a gallon.</p>
<p>U.S. and European energy officials foresee some problems
in the distribution of petroleum products, as is happening
already in Asia. Still, many are concerned that the potential
for a supply crunch exists, even if war doesn't break out in
the Middle East, because the global systems to produce,
transport and refine oil have grown taut in the wake of the
Persian Gulf standoff over Iraqi-occupied Kuwait."We are
operating in a fragile environment," one official explained.
"At every level, from the wellhead through the refinery, we
are at capacity."</p>
<p>Still, energy representatives of oil-consuming nations
have been pleasantly surprised at the rapid increases in
production by Saudi Arabia and others. According to most
estimates, the kingdom already is producing the additional
two million barrels a day it had pledged, putting its current
output at between 7.3 million and 7.5 million barrels. And it
is understood to be pushing to expand its output to eight or
8.5 million barrels a day.</p>
<p>Actual "supplies" from OPEC -- exports of oil plus the
volumes refined and used domestically -- exceed production at
the moment. That's because Saudi Arabia and others are
selling oil from storage as well as from current production.
Petro-Logistics Ltd. of Geneva monitors both the volumes
refined and exported by OPEC and estimates that such supplies
currently total 22.2 million barrels a day.</p>
<p>But surveys of oil in tankers at sea by Petro-Logistics
indicate that so-called producer-owned stocks afloat are
beginning to shrink.</p>
<p>Further evidence of the declines in oil at sea comes from
tanker charterings, which dropped sharply in recent weeks.
However, according to Robert Boslego, a Winchester, Mass.,
oil consultant who monitors such charterings, there has been
"a significant rebound in tanker chartering fixtures since
the depths reached in August."</p>
