	<p class="article-leader">Boston Edison Co. said the U.S. Court of Appeals in Boston
reversed a $39.3 million antitrust judgment against the
company.
   The company last year was ordered to pay the damages to
the towns of Concord and Wellesley, Mass., after a jury found
that wholesale rates the utility charged the towns violated
antitrust laws. The towns alleged price discrimination,
anticompetitive restrictions and price squeezing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The appeals court, however, noting that the towns could
have purchased power from other suppliers, said the towns
failed to prove that Boston Edison had a monopoly.</p>
<p>Boston Edison said that the 1989 judgment hadn't been
reflected in the company's financial statements, and thus the
appeals court decision won't affect the company's earnings.</p>
