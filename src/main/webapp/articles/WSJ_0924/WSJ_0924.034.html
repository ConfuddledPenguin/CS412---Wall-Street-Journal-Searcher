	<p class="article-leader">We've read for months that the U.S. needs a "post-Cold War
strategy," and the House of Representatives has now provided
one. It has simply reverted to a pre-Cold War defense policy,
the one the U.S. pursued to such good effect in the 1930s.
   That's the only way to describe the $283 billion defense
bill passed by the House last week. For all the superficial
talk of "unity" on Iraq, the House has acted as if Saddam
Hussein didn't exist. Its strategy seems to be hobble U.S.
ability to project force overseas, strangle new technologies,
ignore emerging threats, but fortify useless bases in the
U.S. Come home, America, as George McGovern used to say. If
Armed Services Chairman Les Aspin's "strategy" prevails, the
U.S. simply wouldn't be prepared to deter some future Saddam
by the mid-to-late 1990s.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>No one disputes that defense spending can fall after the
buildup of the 1980s. The debate is about the pace and kind
of build-down. Defense Secretary Cheney's proposal would cut
spending by 2% a year, adjusting for inflation, to a 50-year
low of 4% of GNP by 1995. In other words, real but not rash
cuts.</p>
<p>The goal is a military that can meet a reduced but
unpredictable threat in Europe, continue to deter against the
growing Soviet missile force, as well as meet emerging
threats from regional powers like Iraq. The Soviet Union is
undergoing a revolution, with great promise but also the risk
of a Bonaparte. The rest of the world continues to throw up
its share of pirates and lunatics.</p>
<p>But Congress wants to sign its version of the
Kellogg-Briand pact, the treaty that outlawed war in the
1920s. Since peace will always prevail, the House bill
requires that virtually all nonnaval U.S. forces be based in
the U.S. by 1994. This would end a 50-year strategy of
"forward deployments" intended to deter aggression and
reassure allies. GIs would head home from Japan, Korea,
Okinawa, Europe, Turkey, and most likely the Persian Gulf
too. Never mind that some of these deployments are heavily
subsidized by the host country; the Members care more about
isolationist symbolism than saving money.</p>
<p>The House bill also bars the Pentagon from spending money
to transfer the 401st Air Force Fighter Wing to Crotone,
Italy, from Spain. The rest of NATO is happily paying much of
the cost, but Les Aspin's House troops seem to have lost all
interest in NATO's southern flank. Saddam Hussein is sure to
get Mr. Aspin's message, since the 401st is now deployed in
Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>If the U.S. can't project power with troops, how about
aircraft? Sorry, the House clipped the Air Force, too. It
endorsed Les Aspin's effort to kill the B-2 Stealth bomber,
following the advice of military masterminds Ron Dellums (D.,
Calif.) and John Kasich (R., Ohio). So the $35 billion
already sunk into the B-2 will buy only 15 planes, about $2.3
billion apiece. U.S. pilots will lose a weapon that can fly
10,000 miles (with one refueling), carry a big payload, and
detect targets with minimal losses. The airmen who are shot
down flying lesser planes over some future Baghdad can thank
Mr. Aspin.</p>
<p>The CIA says 15 nations could have ballistic missiles by
the year 2000, but the House won't help there either.
Florida's Charlie Bennett rolled out an amendment to cut
spending on strategic defense by about half to $2.3 billion.
Following Georgia Senator Sam Nunn's work in the Senate, Mr.
Bennett is making sure that SDI is RIP. We hope they get
credit on the political coroner's report.</p>
<p>Lest we be unfair, the House bill does prepare for an
invasion of the U.S. mainland. An amendment sponsored by Mr.
Aspin and Colorado's Pat Schroeder tries to make sure no
domestic military base will ever close. The Pentagon wants to
shut at least 35 bases, and reduce forces at 20 more. But
Aspin-Schroeder demands "study" upon "study," and requires
that the military spend no less than 75% of the average spent
at any base over the past five years -- regardless of need.</p>
<p>This bill isn't about defense or "strategy"; it's about
politics. About pork-barrel raids favored by House Democrats
and some Republicans. And about the ideological lenses that
still dominate the Democratic nominating process -- even
after Iraq, and even after Dukakis. Mr. Aspin wants to stay a
committee chairman, so he appeases the mob. Preparing for a
presidential run, Sam Nunn wants to tell liberal primary
voters how he killed SDI.</p>
<p>As we are now learning, however, the U.S. will have
foreign interests and foreign responsibilities even if the
Cold War is over. If ever a bill was veto bait, this is it.</p>
