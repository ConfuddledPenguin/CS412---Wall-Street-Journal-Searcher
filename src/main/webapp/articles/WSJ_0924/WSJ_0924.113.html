	<p class="article-leader">West Germany's Bayer AG said it received permission from
both Investment Canada and the West German antitrust
authority, the Bundeskartellamt, to acquire the Polysar
Rubber division of Nova Corp. of Alberta. Nova said in May it
was selling the division to Bayer for 1.25 billion Canadian
dollars (US$1.08 billion).
   All necessary approvals for the acquisition have now been
received and closing is expected to take place in a few
weeks. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission and Canada's Bureau
of Competition Policy previously approved the acquisition.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>After the acquisition, Polysar will assume responsibility
for Bayer's rubber activities in North America under the name
Polysar Rubber Corp., to be based in Toronto. Bayer said it
intends to invest about C$120 million in Polysar's Canadian
operations within the next three years. Research activities
based at Sarnia, Ontario, are to be intensified.</p>
