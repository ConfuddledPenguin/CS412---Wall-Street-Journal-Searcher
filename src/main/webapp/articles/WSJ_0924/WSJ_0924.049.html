	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, as
expected, approved a "statutory interpretation" that crude
oil sold under so-called 15-day Brent oil contracts isn't a
futures contract as defined in the Commodity Exchange Act.
   The commission, by a 3-1 vote, declared that the contracts
describe cash sales of commodities for deferred shipment or
delivery. As such, these contracts are excluded from the
CFTC's regulatory jurisdiction.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The issue arose in April, when U.S. District Court Judge
William Connor in New York ruled in a case brought by
Transnor (Bermuda) Ltd. that forward trading in Brent, a
widely traded North Sea crude, should be regulated in the
same way as a U.S. futures contract.</p>
<p>Judge Connor's opinion initially placed a cloud over the
entire crude oil market. Non-U.S. participants feared
entering into Brent contracts that might subsequently be held
unenforceable. U.S. participants shied away from the market,
believing they could be held in violation of the Commodity
Exchange Act.</p>
<p>CFTC Chairman Wendy Gramm and Commissioners Kalo Hineman
and William Albrecht voted to approve the statutory
interpretation, and Commissioner Fowler West dissented.</p>
