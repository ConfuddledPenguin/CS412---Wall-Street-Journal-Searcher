	<p class="article-leader">LAUGHLIN, Nev. -- For this gritty gambling town, it pays
to be behind the times.
   Market jitters, volatile fuel prices and recession fears
are supposed to be flattening U.S. tourism, but word hasn't
reached this corner of the Mojave Desert. While Atlantic
City, N.J., struggles with the Northeast economy and Las
Vegas tries to digest a record building boom, Laughlin
thrives as if it were the '80s. Hilton Hotels Corp., Nevada's
biggest employer and a giant presence 90 miles to the north
in Las Vegas, just launched the newest and biggest casino
here -- a $190 million, 2,000-room resort that promises to
lure younger, more affluent customers to this largely
blue-collar playground.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Laughlin's gambling revenue rose 16% in 1989, although
some pessimists doubt anything like that can be sustained.</p>
<p>Now, big developers yearn to convert Laughlin into a Palm
Springs on the river, complete with ritzy golf courses and
shopping malls. But even Laughlin isn't immune to economic
chills: Money is as scarce as water, which may spell trouble
for such grand projects.</p>
<p>Few people come to Laughlin for the view. The town is
wedged between California and Arizona, where the murky
Colorado River oozes through sweltering, ragged hills on its
way to Mexico. The new Hilton swells the city's room count to
7,200-handily outnumbering the population of about 5,000. And
the casino marquees here boast "real mashed potatoes,"
defying the champagne-and-caviar glitz of Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Older customers flock here to relive the past of cheap
rooms, cheap food and lots of low-tech gambling. In the fall
and winter, snowbirds in recreational vehicles roost here and
across the river in Bullhead City, Ariz., and younger
blue-collar gamblers pop in on weekends when they're not
soaking up the sun at nearby lakes.</p>
<p>Laughlin feeds largely off Southern California, which has
a huge and relatively stable economic base. A rise in
gasoline prices won't prevent people from going there; fuel
doesn't take up much of a weekend vacationer's budget. The
town also attracts customers from Las Vegas's older and less
glamorous downtown.</p>
<p>Atlantic City, in comparison, is stuck in the Northeast.
Casino-hotel rooms there cost at least three to four times as
much as Laughlin rooms, and there's a real shortage of
lodging space. Atlantic City feeds off day trippers, and
still buses in scads of low rollers from New York. And fixed
costs -- building costs, debt, overhead -- tend to be quite
high.</p>
<p>As for Las Vegas itself, it's still holding its own and
trying to absorb the biggest building boom it has ever
experienced. The city caters to a wide range of customers --
high rollers, families, middle Americans and locals. Because
of that, a typical big casino must pay to offer a little of
everything: lines of credit, shows, some star performers,
cheap food, expensive food.</p>
<p>Not in Laughlin. Room service is practically nonexistent.
Until recent customer complaints, some hotels balked at
putting the little bars of soap in the bathrooms in favor of
cheaper liquid soap dispensed from wall machines. And lots of
places offer showers instead of bathtubs.</p>
<p>Laughlin has few showrooms, few big headliners, and no
limousines or high-roller comps or parties. Customers will
put up with a lot for $32 a night.</p>
<p>Credit lines? Playing on casino credit in Laughlin is as
rare as summer rain. Atlantic City, Las Vegas and Tahoe have
to offer credit to attract their more diverse clientele. But
Laughlin does most of its casino business off machine games
like slots and video poker. They're more predictable and less
expensive to operate. Table games require more manpower and
involve more risks, thus making operating profits far less
predictable.</p>
<p>As the mercury nears 100 one midmorning, retiree Ed Layton
pulls his wheezing green Pontiac into a casino parking lot. A
bimonthly visitor, he's ready for a hectic day pumping
quarters into video poker machines, an enterprise to be
interrupted by a $2.99 buffet lunch.</p>
<p>"What else is there for an old guy like me to do?" he
laughs. And there is a bonus, he adds with a smile: "It's a
good place to meet nice ladies."</p>
<p>If the big developers succeed, a new crowd may be on its
way to town. John H. Midby & Associates, which owns hundreds
of acres of prime Laughlin property, has started the first
phase of a proposed billion-dollar development scheduled to
include four hotels, 125,000 square feet of casino space, a
7,000-seat amphitheatre and other big-city trappings. And
developer Louis Walter of Beverly Hills, Calif., plans a big
island-themed resort complex with at least 1,000 rooms and
facilities for meetings and conventions.</p>
<p>But experts question whether the area can support such
projects, especially by developers who lack casino-hotel
operating history. And while those representing both new
projects say foreign financing is in the works, industry
observers aren't holding their breath. "It's easy to `just
say no' on exotic projects now," says Jay Kornmayer of First
Interstate Bank of Nevada.</p>
<p>In fact, Midby & Associates apparently has new problems by
the river. The partnership that owns Sam's Town Gold River
Hotel & Gambling Hall, a newly expanded casino built by Midby
and managed by the Boyd Group, said last Thursday that it is
unlikely to make a bond payment due Nov. 1. It also said it
probably won't be able to make a $1.2 million bondholder
payment required under certain bond indentures by Oct. 19.</p>
<p>In a statement, the partnership said it reported a
combined net loss of $3.5 million for July and August, but it
didn't elaborate. It's unclear whether the problems stem more
from operations or from problems lining up financing.
Officials at the Midby-controlled partnership and Boyd Group
didn't return calls seeking an explanation of the troubles.</p>
<p>Some experts warn that casino towns are far from
recession-proof. Harold Vogel of Merrill Lynch & Co. says he
is "very skeptical" of Laughlin's ability to maintain
double-digit growth next year in an era of higher oil prices
and consumer wariness.</p>
<p>Even Don Laughlin -- the wiry, silver-haired entrepreneur
who helped build today's go-go growth spot from a single
bankrupt motel -- concedes, "We're kind of in a catch-up
period."</p>
<p>But optimism prevails up and down newly widened Casino
Drive. So far, visitor counts and occupancy rates have stayed
strong despite the added capacity from Hilton, indicating
that the new property may be attracting new customers, rather
than simply stealing them from others. Last year Laughlin
played host to more than three million people and took in
$346 million in gross gaming revenue.</p>
<p>"I think we'll see 16% to 17% increases {in local gambling
revenue} with the Hilton capacity this year," says Richard P.
Banis, president of Circus Circus Enterprises Inc. Circus
dominates the market with the huge riverboat-themed Colorado
Belle property and neighboring Edgewater casino, which is
under expansion. Other casinos, including the Golden Nugget,
Harrah's Del Rio and the Ramada Express, hope to expand when
the time is right.</p>
<p>Casinos here don't have to be big or fancy to make piles
of money. The 412-room Pioneer, one of the smallest and
darkest joints on the river with decor straight out of a
spaghetti Western, rakes in more than nearly all its
competitors.</p>
<p>"You can't argue with success," says Paul Lowden, whose
Sahara Resorts of Las Vegas bought the family-owned Pioneer
about a year and a half ago. He plans to spruce up and expand
the place, but he balks at anything that could disturb his
coveted $1 and $5 slot players.</p>
