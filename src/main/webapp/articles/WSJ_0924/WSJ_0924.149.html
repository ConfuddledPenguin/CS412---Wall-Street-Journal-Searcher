	<p class="article-leader">Assicurazioni Generali S.p.A., Italy's largest insurance
concern, said parent-company gross earnings for the first
half rose less than 1% to 349.7 billion lire ($297.3 million)
from 346.8 billion lire a year earlier.
   Generali, which has more than 50 units world-wide, cited a
fundamental downturn in the insurance sector, especially in
foreign sales and the Italian non-life sector. An official
said increased inflationary pressure, exchange-rate
instability and the plunge in financial markets following
Iraq's occupation of Kuwait created concern about second-half
results. Nonetheless, he predicted year-end performance to be
"in line" with year-earlier profit, which rose 15% to 390.2
billion lire.</p>
