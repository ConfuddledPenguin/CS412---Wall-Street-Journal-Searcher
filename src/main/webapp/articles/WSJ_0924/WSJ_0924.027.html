	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- The Bank of England lifted its seven-week-old
freeze on National Bank of Kuwait assets, agreeing to grant
resident status to the bank's operations in Britain.
   The freeze, which Britain imposed on all Kuwaiti
institutions when Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, had
prevented the largest Kuwaiti bank from transferring any of
its assets in Britain outside the country.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>By receiving resident status, the Kuwaiti bank, which has
been using its London branch as its operational headquarters,
is able to conduct business more freely. The bank is still
barred from transferring assets back to Kuwait or to Iraq, in
line with an international embargo following the Iraqi
invasion.</p>
<p>The bank expressed hope that Britain's decision will help
"regulatory authorities in those few remaining countries
where the operations of National Bank of Kuwait continue to
be fettered by the impact of the freezing orders." It
declined to specify these countries, though bankers mentioned
Canada. The bank also has New York, Singapore and Bahrain
branches, and Paris and Geneva financial-services units.</p>
