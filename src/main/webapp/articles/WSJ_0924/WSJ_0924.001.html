	<p class="article-leader">Rising oil prices have stalled a proposal by Toronto's
Reichmann family to create Canada's biggest domestically
owned oil producer by merging Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. and
Home Oil Co.
   The merger process "has been somewhat complicated" by the
price surge set off by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, said
Ronald Watkins, vice president, industry and government
relations, for Interhome Energy Inc., Calgary, Alberta, which
owns Home Oil. "Everyone has had to sit down and re-examine
their oil price forecasts, which form the basis for valuation
assumptions," he said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Spot prices of West Texas Intermediate, a benchmark grade
of U.S. crude oil, have risen more than $13 a barrel since
the invasion and subsequent trade embargo against oil and
other products from Iraq and occupied Kuwait.</p>
<p>The Reichmanns' plan, announced in April, called for the
merger of Gulf Canada Resources, a Calgary-based oil and gas
producer, and Home Oil this summer. It also sought the
spinoff of Interhome's Interprovincial Pipe Line Ltd. unit as
a separate public company by year's end.</p>
<p>The Reichmann family owns 74.3% of Gulf Canada through its
real estate flagship, Toronto-based Olympia & York
Developments Ltd. Companies controlled by the Reichmanns,
including Gulf Canada, own a combined 63.5% of Interhome.</p>
<p>Gulf Canada and Home Oil would have joint daily output of
132,000 barrels of oil, more than any other Canadian-owned
oil producer, and assets of about five billion Canadian
dollars (US$4.3 billion).</p>
<p>But with the Iraqi situation unresolved and the outlook
for oil prices unclear, a Gulf Canada spokesman asked, "How
do you get an agreement on price?" He added that "the
intention now is to see if we can go ahead with this merger
before the end of the year." The proposed spinoff of
Interprovincial could proceed at the same time, he said.</p>
<p>Financial advisers are expected to submit proposed terms
for the merger next month to committees set up by Gulf Canada
and Interhome. The committees will then submit the
recommendations to their respective boards. The proposed
terms should be disclosed shortly thereafter, the Gulf Canada
spokesman said.</p>
<p>The delay in the merger won't have any direct impact on
the Reichmann family's wealth, and the merger doesn't involve
the sale of any assets to raise cash. The Reichmanns' energy
assets are held separately from their vast real estate
holdings.</p>
