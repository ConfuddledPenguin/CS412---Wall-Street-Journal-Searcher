	<p class="article-leader">Newell Co. said it "could have some negative impact on
earnings" from a strike that has started at a unit's plant in
Monaca, Pa. It didn't elaborate on the possible impact.
   Newell, the maker of home do-it-yourself products based in
Freeport, Ill., said 450 employees at the plant have rejected
a tentative labor agreement and are now on strike. The
company said the employees are members of American Flint &
Glass Workers Locals 512, 36, 67 and 544.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The plant is operated by Phoenix Glass, a unit of Newell's
Anchor Hocking Industrial Glass division.</p>
<p>Newell said a cooling-off period is now in effect. The
company said it's "hopeful" that negotiations will soon
resume and an "acceptable" agreement can be reached.</p>
<p>Newell said the plant continues to operate with office and
supervisory personnel. It said that "if necessary," the
company can shift "some" production to Newell's Anchor
Hocking Consumer Glass plant in Lancaster, Ohio.</p>
<p>Net income for the second quarter just ended fell to $21.9
million, or 36 cents a share, from $46.1 million, or 76 cents
a share, during the year-ago period.</p>
