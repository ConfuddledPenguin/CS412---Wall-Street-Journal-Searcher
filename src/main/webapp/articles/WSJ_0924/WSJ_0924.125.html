	<p class="article-leader">Honda Motor Co.'s U.S. sales arm in Gardena, Calif., said
base prices for 1991 Acura Integra models will range from
$11,950 to $17,675, with some versions of the car showing no
price increase from a year ago and others rising $500.
   The Integra is the Japanese auto maker's third-best
selling car line in the U.S., and accounts for about 60% of
the volume in its Acura luxury division. The Integra is a
sporty car designed to compete with so-called near-luxury
European models, such as BMW 3-series sedans. Honda's
relatively restrained pricing for the 1991 Integra reflects
increasing competition in this segment from European
manufacturers and new Japanese entries such as the Infiniti
G20, which will have a base price of $17,500.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The price of the least expensive Integra RS hatchback,
$11,950, is unchanged from a year ago, as is that of the
least expensive Integra RS four-door at $12,850. The
better-equipped Integra GS four-door with automatic
transmission will start at $17,175, up $500, or 3%. The rise
for the GS sedan reflects an added sunroof.</p>
