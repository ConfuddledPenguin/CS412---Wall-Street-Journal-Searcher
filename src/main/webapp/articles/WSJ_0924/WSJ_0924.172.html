	<p class="article-leader">We stand on the eve of this century's third great wave of
financial reform, as giddy stock markets and merger fever
once again yield to fear and retrenchment followed by reform
and regulation. The bull market of the early 1900s and the
rise of big trusts led to the 1912 Pujo hearings, spurring
the Federal Reserve Act a year later. The 1933 Pecora
hearings exposed Wall Street's Jazz Age excesses, speeding
passage of the Glass-Steagall Act. Now the savings and loan
crisis and the mounting toll of bad property, LBO and Third
World loans will force a fundamental revamping of the U.S.
banking system.
   Once again reform will come when cool heads are least
likely to prevail and when the political power of the banks
stands at its nadir. Many of today's banking problems,
indeed, have roots in the sensational Pecora probe, which
straddled FDR's national bank holiday of March 1933. A
disenchanted public wanted to slay the bankers rather than
hear their problems. Not surprisingly, the reform that
emerged had a strongly populist tinge, reducing the scope of
banks' activities and fragmenting the banking system. The
fragmented banks, epitomized by the S&Ls, were unable to
carry diversified portfolios or spread their risks over
different businesses. This is a recipe for risk and failure.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As our own post-Crash recession looms, once again populist
indignation will demand that the culprits be stripped of
their powers, like children of their toys. But the next
reform cycle must favor deregulation and consolidation of the
banks, rather than further atomization -- political passions
to the contrary. The last crumbling remnants of
Glass-Steagall (the 1933 act that separated commercial from
investment banking) and the McFadden Act (the 1927 law that
forbade interstate banking) must fall. By granting J.P.
Morgan & Co. the power to trade and underwrite corporate
stocks, the Federal Reserve Board last week took a momentous
step in the right direction. Such a change will satisfy no
public craving for revenge. Rather, it will seem as if
brazen, self-serving bankers are being rewarded for their
blunders just when they should submit to condign punishment.</p>
<p>Things were simpler in the New Deal. After the 1929 market
crashed, Main Street surveyed the wreckage with
"Schadenfreude." The political outrage gathered force only
when people began to trace their joblessness to Wall Street
speculation. Wall Street financiers -- yesterday's idols --
were suddenly pilloried by a pugnacious new populist hero,
Senate counsel Ferdinand Pecora.</p>
<p>In retrospect, the Glass-Steagall Act seems a historical
"non sequitur." It addressed glaring evils, such as the
ability of commercial bankers to waylay depositors into risky
securities investment. But it didn't curb speculation or
repair the banking system's instability.</p>
<p>Glass-Steagall's architects wanted to insulate savings
from speculation. Safe, humdrum commercial banking would be
shielded from volatile investment banking. The result has
been otherwise. For 20 years now, our commercial banks have
courted disaster. The list of their lending fiascoes --
shipping, real estate investment trusts, farmland, oil, Third
World debt, leveraged loans, commercial property -- is truly
astounding. Unless we assume that all commercial bankers are
dunces, we must suspect some deep, systemic flaw behind this
flirtation with disaster.</p>
<p>By no coincidence, the tide of bad loans has risen with
the defection of corporate clients to the capital markets and
depositors to money-market funds. As corporations have
bypassed banks to issue securities, commercial banks have
been saddled with less creditworthy customers. In the 1920s,
Latin debtors issued bonds. In the 1970s, they resorted to
banks because bondholders would have balked at their
sovereign junk. Bolstered by creditworthy clients, investment
banks have seemed safer havens than commercial banks,
subverting Glass-Steagall's intention.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the geographically segmented banking system
created by the McFadden Act turns regional downturns into
full-blown banking catastrophes. Instead of large,
diversified national banks, such as England, France, and
Germany enjoy, the U.S. supports 13,000 localized banks. In
the 1920s, many Southern and Western banks failed when oil
and agriculture slumped. In the 1980s, the S&Ls eerily
re-enacted this precedent. A bank's fortunes are now tied to
Texas oil, Nebraska wheat or Boston real estate. When the
regional economy falters, the bank fails; these bank failures
then aggravate regional distress.</p>
<p>National banks could resist local downturns through
offsetting profits in prosperous regions. Banks that offered
a fuller range of financial services than Glass-Steagall
permits wouldn't be victimized by changes in the way
companies finance their operations. They could simply shift
emphasis along with their clients. With diversified
portfolios, banks could more readily enforce prudential
limits on the amount loaned to any single country, company,
region or industry. And since banks increasingly package
loans into securities, the distinction between commercial and
investment banking has become meaningless.</p>
<p>A system of diversified, national banks would encounter
the historic American antipathy toward concentrated financial
power -- the main reason for the splintered U.S. banking
system -- an antipathy aggravated by recession. Populist rage
will boil over as property, Third World and LBO disasters
dangerously drain the deposit insurance fund.</p>
<p>Some differences between the present and the 1930s do
offer hope. This time, banking reform will occur against a
backdrop of foreign competition. In the 1930s, American banks
were global powers and could afford some shrinkage of their
domestic market share. Today, the four biggest U.S.
commercial banks scarcely make the world's top 50. Seven of
the 10 largest banks are Japanese; two are French. It's hard
to rail against concentrated financial power when America's
giants are dwarves abroad.</p>
<p>Americans may also be shedding their sentimental faith in
small-town banks. In the 1920s and 1930s, thousands of
small-town banks foundered upon corruption or mismanagement,
but political anger was directed against the New York banks,
which had for the most part survived intact. (Franklin
Roosevelt feared deposit insurance would prop up small-town,
Republican banks.) The S&L crisis has again shown how fraud
and cronyism can riddle small banks. Perhaps taxpayer
disenchantment with the thrifts may create a new receptivity
toward national banks. The growth of strong regional banks
over the past decade -- thanks to regional banking pacts --
will buffer any raw power plays by New York banks.</p>
<p>Back in the days of Pierpont Morgan or Jacob Schiff, there
was some truth in the stereotype of the all-powerful banker.
When capital was scarce, bankers lorded it over companies and
investors. Now multinational corporations that issue debt and
institutional investors that buy it have slashed the power of
financial intermediaries. In the 1980s, companies
circumvented banks, selling debt straight to institutional
investors. Banks compete with clients. General Electric
Financial Services, with $91 billion in assets, would rank
fourth if listed as a commercial bank, nosing out J.P. Morgan
& Co., GE's traditional banker.</p>
<p>The power of investment bankers has eroded too. This
sounds strange in an age when yuppie bond traders and
deal-makers earn astronomical salaries. But trading and
deal-making are secondary functions of the financial system.
They have grown important because of a crisis in the primary
system: the provision of money for business, whether through
commercial bank credit or issuing securities. And in this
primary activity, fierce competition is shrinking margins.
Wall Street's "creativity" in the 1980s was a desperate
attempt by commercial and investment banks to find
comparative advantage in a commodity business.</p>
<p>One advantage of deregulating commercial banks right now
is that for the moment they cannot capitalize excessively on
new opportunities. Hobbled by scant capital, poor credit
ratings and low stock prices, they lack the means to expand
rapidly. Best to let the tiger out of the cage when he's not
hungry. The Federal Reserve should insure a gradual
transformation of the system through friendly,
well-capitalized mergers. The process has in fact already
begun, as out-of-state banks buy up ailing thrifts.</p>
<p>Politicians who understand the need for reform, but fear
being tarred as buddies of the banks, may want to portray the
repeal of Glass-Steagall as a populist assault on investment
bankers -- the fat cats of the 1980s. As commercial banks
enter capital markets, they will intensify the pressures in a
profitless underwriting scene. Nor need politicians fear that
these guests at a bleak banquet will reap "obscene" profits.
Nobody will be making much money from underwriting anytime
soon.</p>
<p>Universal banks will make the current regulatory structure
obsolete. A new federal regulatory structure based on
function must be designed. In exchange for new powers,
universal banks will have to accept stricter, broader
supervision from banking authorities; as an additional
safeguard, some form of risk-based deposit insurance would
enforce discipline on the use of small depositors' money.</p>
<p>Reforms in banking regulation can make bank failures less
likely, but they can never eliminate them. Nonetheless, a
broader range of bank powers, joined with tougher
supervision, seems preferable to the mix of narrow powers and
lax supervision that has led to the frightening present
impasse. The need to face unpleasant realities is urgent:
More than a thousand commercial banks are already in trouble
and the downturn has just begun.</p>
