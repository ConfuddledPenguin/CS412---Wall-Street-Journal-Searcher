	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Japan's economic expansion continues, owing to
robust domestic demand led by personal consumption and
corporate-equipment investment, the Bank of Japan said in its
monthly report.
   The central bank's report, reviewing the country's
monetary and economic trends, also said that mining and
industrial production is on the rise, and that corporate
business sentiment remains strong.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Economic Planning Agency also painted a bright picture
of the economy in its latest monthly report, making it
official that the economy has entered into its 46th
consecutive month of growth. The assessment means higher oil
prices and rising interest rates as a result of the Middle
East crisis have had little significant effect on Japan's
economy.</p>
<p>The central bank's report said that "both manufacturers
and non-manufacturers are maintaining a buoyant attitude
toward investment plans. Personal consumption continues firm
against the background of increasing disposable income, and
housing starts are also at a high level."</p>
<p>The Bank of Japan believes prices are maintaining
stability, even as it noted in its report that "domestic
wholesale prices continued to rise, though by a small margin.
. . . Consumer prices rose mainly due to higher perishable
foodstuff prices."</p>
<p>Despite the price stability, Bank of Japan officials have
warned that it is necessary to keep prices under close
surveillance, as the effect of the Mideast crisis on the
economy may be gradual.</p>
