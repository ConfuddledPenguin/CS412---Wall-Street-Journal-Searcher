	<p class="article-leader">Aluminum makers' efforts to break into the lucrative
automotive industry have idled over the years. But now, they
may be about to pick up speed.
   This summer, Honda Motor Co. pulled in with its Acura NSX,
which it bills as the world's first all-aluminum car in
production. This acclaimed lightweight sports car can go from
0 to 60 miles an hour in 5.6 seconds. Problem is, with a
price tag of $60,000, it can make the average consumer's
heartbeat go from 60 to 0 in about the same time.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Though the Acura NSX is a high-performance car whose price
stems from much besides its metal content, cost has been a
perennial problem for aluminum in its automotive crusade.
Aluminum is half the weight of steel, making it more fuel
efficient and environmentally friendly. But it also costs
about four times as much -- a trade-off that car makers have
been reluctant to make.</p>
<p>Aluminum's high cost and wide price swings, combined with
the hefty investment needed to convert to aluminum, makes
many in the auto business queasy. "It's not very near term,"
says John Johnson, senior research engineer at General
Motors' research labs. Adds Kidder, Peabody metals analyst
Robert Hageman: "This can be overdone."</p>
<p>Aluminum, says steel maker USX Corp.'s automotive
marketing manager Peter T. Peterson, is merely a "transitory"
solution. "With the inherent cost and fabrication problem of
aluminum, the auto makers are naturally leery." Unless
aluminum makers can convince car companies that it is in
their financial interests to convert to aluminum, the metal
will never make a dent in high-volume, lower-cost cars.</p>
<p>That may change now, because of possible increases in
federal fuel-efficiency standards and changes in the aluminum
industry's technology and marketing tactics. Nowadays, says
C. Fred Fetterolf, president of Aluminum Co. of America, "you
could get pretty close to an all-aluminum {mass-produced}
car."</p>
<p>That isn't just bluster. The amount of aluminum on the
average car will rise to 600 pounds in 2000 from 140 pounds
now, says Stewart Spector, an aluminum analyst. Though such
projections may prove optimistic, the aluminum industry's
efforts to get more of their metal in cars appear to be
finally turning the corner.</p>
<p>The Persian Gulf crisis, reinforcing fuel-efficiency
concerns in Washington, promises to strengthen aluminum's
hand. A bill before Congress would raise auto makers'
fuel-economy standards 20% by 1995 and 40% by 2000. Under
these regulations, which carry financial penalties, aluminum
would look a lot brighter to auto makers, which have shrunk
their cars about as much as they can.</p>
<p>Though mass-produced all-aluminum cars remain a futuristic
concept, the future is fast approaching. Alcoa has entered a
partnership with Audi AG, a unit of Volkswagen AG, to produce
an aluminum-intensive car, and Alcan Aluminium Ltd. is
working with Ford Motor Co.'s Jaguar subsidiary on another
aluminum-loaded model. Both are expected in the 1992 model
year. Alcan and Alcoa hope the cars will show other auto
makers the possibility for mass-produced aluminum vehicles.</p>
<p>In parts applications, too, aluminum is winning more
converts. Honda uses aluminum for all of its engines, and
Nissan Motor Co. plans to have only aluminum engines by 1995.
Even General Motors Corp., which previously abandoned
aluminum engines after problems during the 1970s with its
Chevrolet Vega, has returned with aluminum engines in
Cadillac, Saturn and Corvette models. How far aluminum can
go, says Mr. Johnson, the GM research engineer, "is just a
matter of fuel-efficiency numbers over time."</p>
<p>The budding partnerships between car and aluminum makers
represent a reversal in the industry's marketing strategy,
from piecemeal applications -- a fender or body panel here, a
wheel or casting thereto entire cars. For decades, aluminum
makers relied on such approaches as eye-glazing appeals about
gasoline mileage and glossy ads with petite women lifting
aluminum parts. In the late 1970s, Reynolds Metals Co. pushed
its "Automotive Diet Plan." Alcoa offered rebate certificates
to encourage owners to recycle rather than junk cars with
significant amounts of aluminum. "They just didn't buy it,"
says David W. Schlendorf, manager of Alcoa's aluminum vehicle
program.</p>
<p>Volatile aluminum prices also have "been very damaging to
our efforts," adds William O. Bourke, Reynolds's chairman and
chief executive officer, who worked at Ford before joining
the No. 2 U.S. aluminum producer.</p>
<p>Even when the government introduced strict fuel economy
standards after the energy crises of the 1970s, aluminum's
gains proved tenuous. If a car was near the bottom of one of
the weight classes that the Environmental Protection Agency
factors into its mileage estimates, the auto maker might
substitute an aluminum part, dropping the car into a lighter
class and boosting its fuel-efficiency rating. But the next
year, the car company would find a cheaper alternative to the
aluminum part, or redesign the car.</p>
<p>Frustrated with meager 4% annual growth in the metal's use
on cars, aluminum companies have turned to ties with the auto
makers -- "fewer parts and more partnership," in the industry
vernacular. Alcan, in addition to its venture with Jaguar,
hired a roving team of marketing and technical experts to
make contacts with auto makers. Alcoa, already working with
Audi and others, last month created a new position for
world-wide automotive products, a $500 million-a-year
business for the company. Reynolds has been working
principally with Ford and is considering offers from three
Japanese companies to form partnerships.</p>
<p>But alliances and contacts alone won't make auto makers
buy the costly metal. So aluminum companies and their
automotive partners are trying to find a cheap way to
mass-produce aluminum cars.</p>
<p>Alcoa thinks it has found one in its "space frame." The
Pittsburgh producer says the space frame, a car's interior
skeleton made of aluminum extrusions and castings, would be
cheaper than a frame made of welded steel, because it is
easier to make and install. Alcoa's Mr. Schlendorf says the
space frame will overcome the cost obstacles and put
mass-produced aluminum-intensive cars on the road.</p>
<p>"Aluminum will become the structural frame {for cars}, and
it will do it on an economically viable basis," predicts
Chuck Haddad, Ford's manager of advanced engineering. Mr.
Haddad says aluminum frames could save processing and welding
costs associated with steel, ultimately reducing the size of
assembly plants by two-thirds. The lighter cars that would
result, he adds, could lead to smaller tires, wheels and
engines, saving more money.</p>
<p>Alcan, the Canadian giant, is also developing an aluminum
body structure, this one made with aluminum stampings.
Honda's new all-aluminum Acura uses a "unit-body" frame that
weighs 462 pounds, 40% less than steel.</p>
<p>Of course, steel isn't standing still. After napping for
decades, the industry is starting to defend its turf. It has
tried to reduce its tooling costs. It is increasing efforts
to make automotive steel more corrosion-resistant. And it has
found ways to decrease automotive steel's thickness while
making it stronger.</p>
<p>Aluminum frames, says Mr. Peterson, USX's automotive
marketing manager, "mean a major shift, a major rethinking in
strategy. I don't think that's going to happen."</p>
<p>Adds metals analyst Charles Bradford: "It's important that
{aluminum makers} go after this market, but the economics of
it aren't as good as they think they are."</p>
<p>Says Mr. Peterson, whose sales to auto makers will exceed
$500 million this year: "It's a rather large crap game, isn't
it?"</p>
