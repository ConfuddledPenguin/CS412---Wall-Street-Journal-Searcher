	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- These may be hard times on Wall Street, but
some people who invested in the leveraged buy-out binge of
recent years are still reaping handsome profits as their
companies go public again.
   For instance, Scholastic Corp., the well-known publisher
of children's books, is planning to go public this week at
about $19.50 a share, more than 14 times the original
investment of some selling shareholders.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A few of the LBO investors in NRM Steelastic will make
nearly 123 times their investment of about 11 cents a share
if the maker of equipment for tire manufacturers goes public
again at $13.50 a share, as planned. Last week, Citicorp
Venture Capital Ltd., a unit of Citicorp, cashed in its 1986
investment in Pamida Holdings, at 25 times its original
investment of 20 cents a share.</p>
<p>Not that the selling shareholders are getting everything
they want: The Citicorp group had envisioned getting 75 times
its original investment in Pamida, a Midwestern discount
retail chain. The NRM Steelastic offering has been delayed;
20% of the company's revenue is tied up in Iraq. The new
issues market has been battered by weakness in the economy
and the stock market, leaving similar deals -- such as one by
Musicland -- stranded as they wait to go public.</p>
<p>"In a bear market, there are limits to what you can ask
people to {pay} without offending their sensibilities," says
Roger McNamee, co-manager of T. Rowe Price Associates' New
Horizons Fund. For LBO investors cashing out, "we're talking
about the difference between spectacular and ridiculous
success."</p>
<p>Scholastic will offer a test of how high a price a company
that is favorably viewed can command from shell-shocked
investors. Founded in 1920 by Maurice R. Robinson, this New
York publisher of children's books and other educational
materials has a franchise and international distribution
network widely praised by analysts.</p>
<p>In 1987, after trading publicly for 18 years, Scholastic
was taken private in a leveraged buy-out by Richard Robinson,
chairman, chief executive and a son of the founder, and other
Robinson family members and company executives.</p>
<p>The buy-out is generally considered a success. Revenue in
the 1990 fiscal year ended May 31 was $374.6 million, more
than double the $180.3 million in fiscal 1986. Scholastic
turned an operating loss of $6.7 million in fiscal 1989 into
operating income of $24.2 million in fiscal 1990.</p>
<p>The company now plans to raise between $75.6 million and
$88.2 million by offering 4.2 million common shares to the
public at between $18 and $21 apiece; of that, 3.27 million
shares will be sold by the company and the rest by
shareholders who originally paid about $1.35 a share.
Proceeds will be used to help repay more than $46 million in
debt. After the offering, current shareholders will control
67.3% of the company, with 32.7% held by the public. The
stock will trade over the counter.</p>
<p>Scholastic "has done an excellent job of increasing
profitability," says Robert Natale, new-issues analyst for
Standard & Poor's Corp. But when he compares the proposed
stock price to those of comparable companies, he concludes
the offering is overpriced. "Investors would do well to buy
it at $14.50 a share or less," he advises.</p>
<p>Mr. Natale isn't alone in balking at the planned offering.
Mr. McNamee of T. Rowe Price points out that Mr. Robinson and
other executives were granted options in May to buy stock at
$9.64 a share, about half the planned price of the initial
public offering. While other publishing stocks have taken a
beating this year, "it hardly seems fair that they get a 100%
mark-up," he says.</p>
<p>"They'll all be spectacularly wealthy," Mr. McNamee adds.
"It's just a question of playing chicken with the market and
seeing how much they can get." As does Mr. Natale, he likes
the company's prospects and hopes that it will strike a
compromise with willing investors.</p>
<p>For venture capitalists eager to cash in on their
investments, last week's offering of Pamida Holdings shows
what it takes to lure skeptical investors in today's fragile
market. Pamida, publicly owned from 1969 to 1981, was bought
by an employee stock ownership plan in 1981. In 1986, a group
led by Citicorp Venture Capital bought the company in a
leveraged buy-out.</p>
<p>Originally, Pamida filed in June with the Securities and
Exchange Commission for an offering of 2.8 million shares at
$14 to $17 each; of that, the company planned to sell two
million shares to raise funds. Later, the price was lowered
to $13 to $16 a share, but the offering was increased to four
million shares.</p>
<p>Last week, Pamida finally went public on the American
Stock Exchange at $5 a share, with only 1.5 million shares
offered -- Citicorp Venture Capital's entire stake. At
one-third the hoped-for price of $15 a share, the discount
seemed steep enough to satisfy investors: Pamida closed
Friday at $6.375. And Citicorp Venture Capital cashed out at
25 times its original 20 cent-a-share investment.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some other "reverse LBOs" on the public
equity agenda are drawing cautious reviews from analysts and
money managers. Reverse LBOs refer to companies taken private
in a leveraged buy-out that, theoretically, have matured and
are now going public to seek debt relief or allow their
investors to cash profits.</p>
<p>Steelastic, an Ohio maker of tire-manufacturing equipment,
was bought in a 1986 LBO by a group of investors led by John
D. Vazzana. In 1987, Steelastic bought Goodyear's
tire-retreading equipment business; this year it bought NRM
Corp., a maker of tire building machines and other equipment.
Pro forma net income jumped to $8.2 million on sales of
$117.8 million in fiscal 1990 ended March 31, from income of
$1.1 million in fiscal 1986 on sales of $8.3 million. While
the acquisition of NRM Corp. contributed to a big jump in
sales, it also added to the company's debt load.</p>
<p>To pare $48 million in long-term debt down to about $20
million, or about 25% of total capitalization after the
offering, NRM Steelastic plans an initial offering of 3.35
million shares at $12 to $15 each. The company plans to sell
2.8 million of those shares. Certain shareholders who
originally bought stock for 11 cents a share will sell the
rest.</p>
<p>Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has put the offering on hold.
Company officials were out of the country and not available
to comment on what the invasion has done to NRM Steelastic's
operations in Iraq, which accounted for 20% of pro-forma net
sales in fiscal 1990.</p>
<p>Even without its problems in the Mideast, NRM Steelastic
is vulnerable to a slowing economy. "The tire business is not
the kind of company you want to own in a recession," says
S&P's Mr. Natale.</p>
