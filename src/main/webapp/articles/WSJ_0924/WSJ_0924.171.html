	<p class="article-leader">Last week's Massachusetts primary for Governor
demonstrated once again why it is competition that makes
politics work, and that it is the lack of competition that
breeds voter cynicism and apathy. Now New York is
demonstrating the same thing.
   In Massachusetts, John Silber's surprise victory in the
Democratic primary has reinvigorated an intellectually
bankrupt party and given it a better chance to hold on to the
Governor's mansion after the Dukakis debacle. But Mr. Silber,
the fiery president of Boston University, barely squeaked by
the anti-democratic rule that no one can run in a primary if
he does not win 15% or more of the delegates at a state
convention. Except for a public outcry over his possible
exclusion, party bosses probably would have succeeded in
barring Mr. Silber from the primary ballot.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the New York Republican Party, the bosses succeeded in
handpicking their candidate, and their party is now paying
the price. The party is in danger of permanent collapse, and
the man principally responsible is State Senator Roy Goodman,
who picked Gubernatorial Candidate Pierre Rinfret by leafing
through his address book. Mr. Goodman was looking for an
alternative, any alternative, to New York University Dean
Herbert London, already the Conservative Party nominee. Mr.
Goodman and other bosses wanted a less conservative and more
pliable candidate.</p>
<p>As soon as Mr. Goodman rammed his choice through a party
convention, it developed that Mr. Rinfret, an economist of
eccentric views, was not even a registered Republican. Mr.
Rinfret was said to have promised to spend $600,000 of his
own money on the campaign, but it now develops he hasn't done
that either.</p>
<p>Indeed, Mr. Rinfret has done little but embarrass
Republicans. Last week, he denounced Jack Kemp as a "traitor"
and a "lackey for Governor Cuomo." He then threatened to "go
sailing" until the election if the party didn't come up with
$1 million. On Friday, he finally promised to stay in the
race -- for now.</p>
<p>But Republicans have lost a golden opportunity to
challenge the Cuomo fiscal record, which more and more
resembles that of Michael Dukakis's Massachusetts. Worse, the
Rinfret disaster threatens to lower Republican voter turnout
to dangerously low levels. That could hand control of the
State Senate to the Democrats, giving that party the power to
gerrymander New York into a one-party state. Senator Goodman
himself could be swept away in a sudden Democratic tide.</p>
<p>There is still some hope for New York Republicans. The
state election code allows the party to replace any candidate
who leaves the state for an extended period of time. If Mr.
Rinfret were indeed to "go sailing" until the election, then
Republicans could nominate the estimable Mr. London to lead a
united front against Mr. Cuomo. A Cuomo victory would still
be likely, but a laughing-stock landslide wouldn't be.</p>
<p>The biggest challenges to effective democracy today are
the efforts of entrenched interests to stifle new ideas and
political competition. The Democratic reinvigoration in
Massachusetts and the Republican collapse in New York both
suggest that the cure for the alienation and apathy that
pollsters constantly find among voters is to bring back the
rough-and-tumble of real, competitive politics.</p>
<p>There are lessons here for both parties. The near debacle
in Massachusetts came in the state headed by the national
Democrats' most recent standard-bearer, after all, and
clearly even the rank and file of their own party is looking
for something new. The Republican collapse comes in the state
most dominated by respectable, go-along, slice-of-bread,
permanent-minority Republicans. There is still a lot of that
sentiment in Washington as well, and Republicans should look
where it leads.</p>
