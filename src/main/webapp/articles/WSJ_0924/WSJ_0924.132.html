	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- One week before the 100th anniversary of
Yosemite National Park, a group of affluent environmentalists
are expected to announce today its plan to start a company
that might one day bid against the park's sole
concessionaire, an entrenched institution that has been
accused of rapidly reducing America's most beloved national
site into a theme park.
   The environmentalists said that they would need to raise
at least $200 million to launch their company, the Yosemite
Restoration Trust, which would press for less construction
and fewer cars in the park and, if all else fails, put in a
bid for the federal concession contract when it comes up for
renewal in 1993.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"This doesn't have anything to do with running a
concession," said Bob Maynard, president of the Aspen Skiing
Company and one of the environmentalists heading up the
group. "The real interest is just to try to get the National
Park Service and the concessionaire to try to work together
to implement the master plan." This master plan, recommended
by the Park Service in 1980, would curtail traffic, reduce
lodging and move other buildings to the periphery of the
park.</p>
<p>The current concessionaire, MCA Inc.'s Yosemite Park &
Curry Co., has held the contract since 1973. In that time, it
has made millions while paying the federal government only
0.75% of its annual revenue, among the lowest franchise fee
paid by any national park concessionaire.</p>
