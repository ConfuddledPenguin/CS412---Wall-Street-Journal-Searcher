	<p class="article-leader">Security Pacific Corp. said it paid $44.4 million to
assume certain assets and liabilities of Mercury Federal
Savings & Loan Association, the Huntington Beach, Calif.,
thrift that was seized by the federal Resolution Trust Corp.
last February.
   Los Angeles-based Security Pacific said it is acquiring
$1.4 billion in total deposits, including $1.3 billion in
core deposits. It is also assuming $340 million in loans from
the thrift, most of them residential loans.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The purchase price, which is slightly more than 3% of core
deposits, appears to be at the lower end of what banks have
been paying for core deposits of failed thrifts in recent
months.</p>
<p>Mercury Federal had total assets of $1.7 billion and total
liabilities of $1.8 billion, as of July 31.</p>
<p>Security Pacific is the parent company of Security Pacific
National Bank.</p>
