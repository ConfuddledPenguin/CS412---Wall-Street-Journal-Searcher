	<p class="article-leader">TUCSON, Ariz -- Tucson Electric Power Co., seeking "an
immediate and positive sign to creditors," said it applied to
Arizona regulators for an 11.6% rate increase and a further
2% temporary fuel surcharge.
   The requested increases, which would raise $55 million in
permanent new annual revenue and $15.5 million through the
temporary surcharge, are substantially lower than analysts
have said is eventually needed to put the utility on a sound
footing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The application, filed Friday with the Arizona Corporation
Commission, seeks to forestall an important reckoning of rate
recovery for Tucson Electric's controversial new, $829
million Springerville 2 coal-fired generating plant.</p>
<p>In its application, the utility asked the commission for
permission to defer about $100 million annually of interest
and other expenses related to the facility. Tucson Electric
said it expects to file for recovery of Springerville 2's
costs late next year.</p>
<p>The application for cost recovery, which could mean a rate
boost of 15% or more on top of the latest application, faces
considerable resistance whenever it is filed. Two members of
the three-member Arizona Corporation Commission have
questioned whether the plant is needed in a region awash with
generating capacity, raising the painful possibility that
Tucson Electric might be barred from recovering some or all
of its investment.</p>
<p>The wounded electric utility, Arizona's second largest
after Arizona Public Service, which also filed for a rate
increase Friday, said its requests for rate increases are
"the initial step to returning Tucson Electric to a
reasonably sound financial condition."</p>
<p>As previously reported, Tucson Electric had a net loss of
$87.4 million, or $3.62 a share, on $233.1 million of revenue
in the first six months of the year. The total included $27.4
million in losses from continuing operations and $59.9
million of one-time charges and losses from discontinued
operations.</p>
<p>The utility said its request for a temporary 2% fuel
surcharge is intended to recover about $15.5 million in fuel
and purchased power expenses incurred between Jan. 1 and June
30, 1989, adding that it is seeking "expedited consideration"
of the surcharge, in hopes that the levy could start in
mid-November.</p>
<p>The Arizona Corporation Commission has twice dismissed
Tucson Electric's requests for recovery of fuel expenses for
the six months in question and the entire issue of fuel and
purchased power recovery is the subject of litigation in
state and federal courts in Tucson.</p>
<p>However, a company spokesman said an earlier commission
order opened the way for the company to reapply for the
money. "We are persistent," the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Tucson Electric last was granted a rate increase in
October 1989 when the Arizona commission approved an 11.9%
boost.</p>
