	<p class="article-leader">DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia -- U.S. and Saudi generals are
discussing proposals to set up a joint military command to
improve overall control of the international forces
confronting Iraq, according to officials from both countries.
   Such an arrangement, with top Saudi and U.S. officers
essentially becoming vice commanders and sharing power under
a central structure, would have important symbolic and
military implications.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In addition to the top tier, other countries with troops
in Saudi Arabia presumably would be represented in this new
arrangement, giving them a larger political stake and a
chance to participate more formally in important decisions,
these officials said. Proponents also contend there would be
improved coordination and more clear-cut control over
British, French and Arab troops.</p>
<p>Senior U.S. and Saudi officials haven't agreed on a
specific plan, and any decision is probably weeks away. But
the issue became the focus of renewed attention over the
weekend in the wake of complaints by British and American
officers about the current makeshift command arrangements.</p>
<p>Regardless of the outcome, American forces are certain to
remain under the direct control of the U.S. In the same way,
Saudi leaders have insisted from the beginning of the Gulf
crisis that they must maintain command over their own
soldiers. But with more than 50,000 additional troops slated
to arrive soon from Britain, France, Egypt and Syria, the
proposals under discussion could significantly improve the
overall readiness of the multinational forces.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Saudi military and government leaders have
stepped up private messages urging the Bush administration to
take military action against Iraq if economic sanctions don't
produce clear-cut results in the next few weeks. Some Saudi
leaders, according to one government official, weeks ago
called on Western countries to cut off commercial and mail
service to Iraq. They also warned the White House that the
fragile Arab coalition opposing Iraq may begin to erode if
the standoff stretches into next year, this official said.</p>
<p>The sensitive question of who is in charge of the growing
international strike force became public after British
defense chief Tom King highlighted the issue during a meeting
last week with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. Mr. King agreed
that British forces would be under day-to-day American
control in most combat situations, but he also suggested that
a broader arrangement may be in the works that would put a
British officer "in the overall command structure" in Saudi
Arabia.</p>
<p>French Defense Minister Jean Pierre Chenvenement, on the
other hand, before leaving for a visit to the Middle East
said last week that his government will retain "autonomy of
decision and autonomy of action" regarding almost 5,000
specially trained desert fighters France is sending to Saudi
Arabia.</p>
<p>If fighting breaks out, a single chain of command may be
essential to transform this hodgepodge of soldiers, tanks and
aircraft from at least 11 countries into an effective
fighting force. "The British have prompted a lot more
attention to the whole question of a unified command," one
senior military official said, adding: "But it's still in the
early talking stages."</p>
<p>In the meantime, Saudi and U.S. commanders have assigned
their ground forces to defend specific sections of the
northeastern border with Kuwait, and the two countries are
conducting separate but coordinated 24-hour patrols by
fighter jets to guard against Iraqi air attacks. British
pilots are flying their own missions alongside the two other
air forces.</p>
<p>A number of U.S. and British pilots, however, have
complained to reporters that existing procedures may be
unworkable in combat because it would take too long for them
to receive authorization from U.S. and Saudi ground
commanders to fire on hostile planes.</p>
<p>American naval commanders have tried for weeks, apparently
with only limited success to obtain European approval of a
detailed plan outlining how Western warships can work more
closely together to interdict Iraqi shipping in the Gulf.</p>
<p>Without creating a single, well-defined command structure,
"missions will be duplicated and {some of the vessels} will
be at risk for the lack of an organized defense against
possible Iraqi attacks," according to a report released last
week by a European parliamentary group.</p>
<p>Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the commander in chief of U.S.
forces in the region, has said, "there isn't one supreme
commander" in Saudi Arabia "and there doesn't need to be
one." But other U.S. and Saudi officials stressed that his
Saudi counterpart, Gen. Khaled bin Sultan, the top Arab
commander, only recently assembled a full-fledged staff to
help him deal with the complex problems of coordinating
foreign troops.</p>
<p>While emphasizing that the current system is working well,
Mr. Cheney told reporters earlier this month that "if it
becomes necessary in this instance" to set up a unified
command, "I'm certain we could work something out."</p>
<p>In Washington, a spokesman for Gen. Colin Powell, chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said, "I don't sense that there
is any movement at this end" to change the current
arrangements. But like Mr. Cheney, he left the door open for
possible changes as the military situation evolves.</p>
