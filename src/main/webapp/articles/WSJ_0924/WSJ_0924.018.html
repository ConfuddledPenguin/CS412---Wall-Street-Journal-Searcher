	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Japan's output of cars, trucks and buses grew
8.1% in August from a year earlier to 962,257 units on strong
domestic demand, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers'
Association said.
   The total was a record for August, surpassing the high of
890,339 units set a year earlier. Output in July was up 10%
to 1,211,000 units.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Domestic sales rose 14% in August from a year earlier to
478,588 units, breaking the record for the month of 421,493
set in August 1989. Export data weren't yet complete, but
association officials said they expect them to show a drop of
about 1% from year-earlier levels.</p>
<p>The vigorous domestic demand reflected sustained economic
growth fueled by healthy personal spending, among other
things, the officials said. Japan's economy now has been
expanding for 46 months in a row. That's its second longest
postwar stretch of growth, after the 57-month skein from
October 1965 to July 1970.</p>
<p>In August, production of passenger cars climbed 12% from a
year earlier to 709,785, also a record for the month.
Medium-sized cars showed a 19% rise to 138,498, while small
cars registered a 6.1% gain at 507,845. Production of
minicars surged 64% to 63,442.</p>
<p>Truck output slid 1.7% to 249,436. Medium-sized trucks
registered a 3.4% drop at 89,394, while small trucks had a
6.2% gain to 88,568. Output of minitrucks dropped 7.9% to
71,474. Bus production climbed 12% to 3,036.</p>
<p>By maker, Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's biggest car
manufacturer, reported production of 292,780 units, up 18%
from a year earlier. Nissan Motor Co., the second largest,
produced 168,929 cars, trucks and buses, a drop of 1.3%.
Mitsubishi Motors Corp. made 7.8% more motor vehicles than in
the year-earlier month, or 98,008 units. Production by Mazda
Motor Corp. rose 8.9% to 101,950.</p>
