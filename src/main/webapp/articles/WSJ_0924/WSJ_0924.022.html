	<p class="article-leader">WILLOUGHBY, Ohio -- Figgie International Inc. suspended
its share-repurchase program because of market conditions,
the company said.
   The consumer, industrial and technical concern announced
the buy-back program earlier this year to restore the balance
between the number of Class A and Class B shares outstanding.
Under the program, the company repurchased about 150,000
shares of Class B common, which have greater voting power.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Figgie had 18,909,822 average outstanding shares for the
year ended Dec. 31, 1989.</p>
