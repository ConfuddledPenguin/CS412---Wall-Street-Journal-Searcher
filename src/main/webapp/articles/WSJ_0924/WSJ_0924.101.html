	<p class="article-leader">Durable-goods producers are proceeding with plans to
upgrade their factories despite the economic uncertainty.
   Machine tool orders in August rebounded briskly from the
vacation-affected July lull, rising 27% from a year earlier
and 23% from July.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Furthermore, buyer interest at the International Machine
Tool Show in Chicago early this month indicates that business
will continue brisk into the fall, if the economy doesn't
actually plunge into recession, machine tool industry
officials say.</p>
<p>Orders placed at U.S. machine tool plants in August jumped
to $288.1 million from $227.1 million a year earlier and
$234.3 million in July, according to NMTBA -- The Association
for Manufacturing Technology, a McLean, Va., trade group.</p>
<p>The August total was bolstered by at least one large
automotive order. Litton Industries Inc.'s Lamb Technicon
unit at Warren, Mich., received an order for about $40
million of equipment to machine transmission cases for
Chrysler Corp.</p>
<p>"We were very encouraged by the show," said Robert J.
Siewert, president of Monarch Machine Tool Co., a Sidney,
Ohio, producer of lathes, machining centers and equipment to
process coils of sheet metal. "Many people came to us with
plant-improvement projects, and some actually came with
drawings. We were amazed; after a relatively slow summer, we
didn't expect that much interest."</p>
<p>Salesmen and executives of Hurco Cos., Indianapolis,
obtained twice as many sales leads at this year's machine
tool show as they got at the 1988 show, said Michael K.
Campbell, senior vice president and chief financial officer.
"Manufacturers have decided that if they want to be in
position to compete beyond 1991, they need to invest in
equipment now."</p>
<p>Cincinnati Milacron Inc., the nation's largest machine
tool concern, booked more orders at the show than officials
had expected. A machine shop owner bought one of the machines
Milacron was demonstrating and took it home in his pickup
truck after the show.</p>
<p>Machine tool distributors, who handle imported as well as
U.S.-made machines, also did far more business than usual at
the recently concluded show, said Robert A. Gale, president,
American Machine Tool Distributors' Association, Rockville,
Md. He said some U.S. manufacturers have concluded that
there's less risk in borrowing heavily to buy new machinery
in uncertain times than there is in trying to compete with
obsolete equipment. "They'd rather go out fighting" than to
be slowly squeezed out by more efficient competitors, he
added.</p>
<p>Part of Monarch's recent order rise results from a
recovery in the oil patch, Mr. Siewert said, but Monarch has
received inquiries and orders from "a very broad cross
section of industry." September orders will be higher than
for any of the summer months, he said, and "October looks
like it will be good too."</p>
<p>Machine tool industry executives have been expecting the
auto makers to resume active buying. Industry orders dropped
noticeably in the spring of 1989 when auto companies began
deferring decisions on equipment purchases.</p>
<p>The Middle East crisis, which is creating uncertainty for
most businesses, may resolve some of the questions troubling
engineers at the auto companies. They've been uncertain about
whether to buy machinery to make six-cylinder engines, which
the performance-oriented buyers have been seeking, or more
fuel-efficient 16-valve, four-cylinder engines.</p>
<p>Auto companies are concerned that if they produce more of
the six-cylinder cars, they'll exceed federal government
limits on average fuel consumption per car. But they have
also worried that the thrifty cars Uncle Sam wants them to
produce wouldn't sell. If Saddam Hussein can hold the price
of gasoline up in the present range, however, those
four-cylinder cars may sell briskly, particularly if they're
equipped with new four-speed automatic transmissions. Both
the engines and transmissions would require large purchases
of machine tools.</p>
<p>August orders for lathes, machining centers, milling
machines, boring mills, grinders and other machines to shape
metal parts by cutting totaled $240.5 million, up 54% from
$156.3 million a year earlier, the NMTBA said. Even excluding
the Lamb order from Chrysler, orders would have been up more
than 25%.</p>
<p>Orders in August for metal-forming presses and other
machines to shape metal with pressure were $47.6 million,
which was down 33% from $70.9 million a year earlier. Figures
for both years were reduced by unusually high cancellations
of foreign orders.</p>
<p>Machine tool shipments in August totaled $242.3 million, a
7.3% rise from a year earlier, which is in line with an 8.7%
shipment increase for the first eight months.</p>
