	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- Groupe Michelin surprised analysts by posting a
larger-than-expected loss for this year's first half.
   Michelin, which became the world's biggest tire company
when it acquired Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. this year, posted
a first-half loss of 363 million francs ($68.7 million), and
warned that the second half is looking even worse. It said a
loss is likely for the full year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Michelin said first-half sales declined 4.4% to 27.22
billion francs. It blamed the decline on currency
fluctuations.</p>
<p>The loss compares to a 1.46 billion-franc profit in 1989's
first half, and a 2.45 billion-franc profit for all of 1989.
Michelin said it is making a large effort to return to
profitability in 1991.</p>
<p>As with other tire makers, it blamed the loss on heavy
price competition, on sluggish auto sales in both the U.S.
and Europe, on rising costs and on a plan announced in June
to cut its French labor force by 2,260 people. To cover
severance, early retirement and retraining costs, it made a
special 350-million franc provision.</p>
<p>One problem Michelin didn't point to is finance.
Michelin's more than $1.5 billion Uniroyal Goodrich
acquisition has pushed up its already heavy debt. Net finance
charges in the first half jumped to 1.06 billion francs, more
than double the year-earlier figure.</p>
<p>Michelin did warn, however, that because the acquisition
was completed in May, the impact of interest payments on its
results would be more severe in the second half.</p>
<p>Michelin said in a statement that efforts to cut
production, stocks and overhead would be "pursued and
reinforced.</p>
