	<p class="article-leader">KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Stuart Hall Co.'s growing distribution
base and "an exceptionally good" back-to-school season
contributed to a boost in earnings for the fiscal third
quarter, ended Aug. 31, Charles G. Hanson, chairman and chief
executive officer, said.
   Mr. Hanson said net income for the office- and
school-products company was "50% over last year's"
third-quarter earnings of $544,000, or 14 cents a share. But
the comparison benefits from a $188,000 net charge, from
inventory write-down, that substantially trimmed year-earlier
results. The 1989 quarter also was hurt by an unusually large
$289,379 pretax bad-debt provision.</p>

<p>Total sales for the quarter are expected to be $40.4
million, a 28% increase from $31.6 million for the
year-earlier period. Mr. Hanson said he expects continued
earnings growth of 30% to 40% next year.</p>
<p>"We are adding constantly to our distribution base. We
estimate that some 46,000 outlets now carry a pretty broad
base of our product," Mr. Hanson said in an interview.</p>
<p>Upgraded office-supply products, which he called "the
backbone" of Stuart Hall's office product lines, also added
to increased sales, but earnings growth was stunted
nonetheless by the effects of a "depressed pricing structure
throughout the industry," Mr. Hanson said.</p>
<p>"This year was probably the worst for pricing structure
that I can recall," he said. "Had it not been for that we
would have done substantially better."</p>
<p>Mr. Hanson said he expects to benefit from some "very fine
equipment" purchased from a German-based paper-supply company
that closed its American operation. The equipment purchased
from Herlitz Co. will be placed in Stuart Hall's Kansas City
headquarters, its Bessemer, Ala., facility, and in a new
Woodland, Calif., facility scheduled to open in December, he
said.</p>
<p>Mr. Hanson said the company will release within the next
30 to 45 days a new line of about 50 products made from 100%
recycled paper products.</p>
<p>People are "caught up in the recycling movement but are
not willing to pay more for a recycled sheet of paper," he
said. "We are delighted" with the new recycled product, he
added, because "the consumer will have an opportunity to buy
a 100% recycled product at the same price he's spending for
the product now."</p>
<p>Mr. Hanson wouldn't project how much the new products
might affect earnings, but he said "it will have a favorable
impact on our bottom line. It will be a major introduction,
the largest thing that's happened to us in 1990."</p>
