	<p class="article-leader">John O. Sillin accurately describes the energy situation
in the non-transportation sector ("The Nuclear Energy
Weapon," editorial page, Aug. 23). But this nation rolls on
oil. Practically everything we move is powered by gasoline,
diesel fuel and jet-engine fuel.
   Los Angeles has decreed major changes in auto and truck
fuel over the next 10 to 20 years. The solutions include
alcohol from grain that will demand fertilizers from natural
gas, methanol from natural gas and electric-powered cars.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It would be ironic if the electric cars now being
developed go into production and we end up charging their
batteries with electricity generated by burning oil and gas
in power plants. Nuclear plants are base-loaded; they already
serve current demand day and night. Utilities meet additional
daytime loads with hydro, coal and natural gas.</p>
<p>All available hydroenergy is used each season, and that
means that even if all batteries are charged at night, more
coal, gas and even oil will have to be burned for electricity
generation. Society is willing to give up some energy
efficiency to reduce urban smog and to save limited resources
of oil and gas. But it does not make sense to miss both of
those objectives while uranium and a good technology to
utilize it sit waiting for public understanding.</p>

<p>Between the dangers of global warming and imminent war in
the Mideast, our need for non-polluting energy independence
has never been more obvious. Yet, a march down the path to
nuclear power, as Mr. Sillin encourages, is like walking
blindfolded. No one, in or outside the nuclear industry, has
proposed a safe treatment for nuclear waste. These waste
products will remain insidiously damaging to most forms of
life for thousands of years. If Mr. Sillin shortchanges our
ingenuity and industriousness in developing solar, biomass or
other renewable forms of energy to a commercially viable
level, does he really think we can build containment vessels
that will last for a few thousand years?</p>
<p>In the area of transportation, we already have the
technological solution: Hydrogen burns cleanly and can be
used by existing vehicles with minor engine modifications and
a different storage tank. If it were mass produced, using
solar energy to convert water or biomass, its price would be
comparable with the pre-Persian Gulf conflict gasoline price
levels. We would eliminate the threat of global warming, oil
spills, toxic storage leaks and at least one trigger for
armed conflict.</p>

<p>The American Nuclear Society believes that the U.S.
government should heed Mr. Sillin's warnings. We are
concerned that the Department of Energy's National Energy
Strategy (NES) is taking shape slowly, and may not fully
reflect the critical importance of new base-load
electric-generating plants in our nation's energy future.</p>
<p>The NES should characterize the risks of all of our
electricity-supply options, including the strategic risks of
falling back on more imported oil. It should also clearly
consider the risks to our nation of
electric-generating-capacity shortages. We have had regional
brownouts and rolling blackouts this year. These are warning
signals that we will need new capacity soon, yet nothing much
is being ordered.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the nation will conserve and use electricity
more efficiently. Nevertheless, we will still need additional
capacity if our expectations for the future and our desires
to clean up our environment are to be realized. We cannot
meet demand and replace older, less-efficient, power plants,
and those that may be shut down as a result of the new Clean
Air bill without new base-load power plants.</p>
<p>This will require action at the federal level on
standardized nuclear-plant licenses, and action by Congress
to ensure regulation that is stable, predictable and has a
sound technical basis.</p>
<p>Moreover, we need to stop pretending that there are
unsolvable scientific issues that prevent real progress on
nuclearwaste disposal. We need to remove this important
national obligation from state and local politics.
Radioactive wastes already exist, and must be disposed of
safely and permanently, even if every nuclear plant in the
world were shut down tomorrow. Obviously, if we can safely
dispose of the wastes that already exist, handling future
wastes will be no different.</p>

<p>Mr. Sillin has raised false hopes by concluding that more
nuclear-power plants can help us "to deal with thugs like
Saddam Hussein" who threaten our oil supply.</p>
<p>Generation of electricity is hardly a significant factor
anymore in our dependence on foreign oil. The U.S. generated
only 5% of its electricity from oil in 1986 through 1988,
down from 17% in 1973, according to Edison Electric Institute
data. This current usage in turn represents only 4% of the
total petroleum used in the same current period, again down
from 9% in 1973. Transportation is the big culprit, consuming
63% of the total. This is followed by industrial use,
including chemical feedstocks, at 25%. Residential and
commercial users account for the remaining 8%.</p>
<p>Nuclear power is an important future resource, and the
public deserves a clear and objective picture of the role it
should play in the U.S. energy picture. This understanding is
not served by an attempt to justify it as a response to an
irrational world leader like Saddam Hussein.</p>
