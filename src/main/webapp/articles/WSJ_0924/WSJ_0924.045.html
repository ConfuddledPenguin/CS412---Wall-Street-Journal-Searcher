	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Federal regulators said they retained the
New York law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore to help try to
recover millions of dollars of thrift and bank junk-bond
losses from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   The agreement, which was expected, was sought by a Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. task force. The U.S. Bankruptcy Court
in New York has set a Nov. 15 deadline for asserting claims
against Drexel, which filed for protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code earlier this
year. Recoveries could come from Drexel's bankruptcy estate
or two restitution funds.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Cravath Swaine has committed itself to provide whatever
legal staffing is necessary, including senior trial partners
Thomas Barr and David Boies, who are among the country's
best-known litigators.</p>
<p>The government contends that Drexel's former junk-bond
chief, Michael Milken, helped thrifts that were big Drexel
customers fraudulently swap high-risk, high-yield junk bonds
and record artificial profits on the sales. No such charges
have ever been filed against Mr. Milken or Drexel.</p>
