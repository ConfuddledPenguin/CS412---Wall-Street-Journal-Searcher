	<p class="article-leader">Hongkong Land Holdings Ltd. said its interim after-tax
profit surged 32% in the first six months of 1990, helped by
higher lease renewals despite the softening of the local
property market.
   The Hong Kong landlord, which owns a swatch of the
colony's most valuable downtown property, also said it
intends to follow in the footsteps of its parent group,
Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd., and sister company, Dairy
Farm International Holdings Ltd., by obtaining a listing on
the International Stock Exchange in London and by keeping its
accounts in U.S. dollars. The moves, which it said are aimed
at enhancing its international corporate profile, come at a
time when it is seeking to purchase properties overseas.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Hongkong Land's after-tax profit rose to US$129.6 million
from $98.3 million in the year-earlier first half, equal to a
32% rise in per-share earnings to 5.10 cents from 3.86 cents.
Turnover rose 35% to $176.9 million from $131.4 million.</p>
<p>The group's directors proposed raising its interim
dividend to 2.75 cents from 2.05 cents a year earlier.</p>
