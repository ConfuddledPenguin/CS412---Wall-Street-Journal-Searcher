	<p class="article-leader">NORWOOD, Mass. -- Phoenix Technologies Ltd., continuing to
struggle, said it expects to post a loss of about $8.5
million for the fiscal fourth quarter, ending Sept. 30, in
part because of a restructuring charge.
   Phoenix, which makes software for personal computers, has
been hurt by diversification moves that haven't worked out
and by increased competition. But it said it hopes to return
to profitability "before the end of fiscal 1991" next
September.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Phoenix said it expects to report a loss before
restructuring charges of about $2 million for the fourth
quarter, and a loss after a restructuring charge, bad debts
and taxes of about $8.5 million. In the year-ago fourth
quarter, the company has a loss of $11.9 million after a
restructuring charge of $3.6 million. Revenue will rise to
about $10 million from $4.5 million a year ago.</p>
<p>The restructuring charges are largely the write-off of
fixed assets and related facilities costs.</p>
<p>Ron Fisher, president and chief executive officer, said
the company's plan calls for it to become profitable by the
end of next fiscal year by becoming more efficient. The
company has cut expenses while putting more resources into
growing market segments, such as notebook PCs, printer
controllers and graphics-oriented PCs, he said.</p>
<p>The fourth-quarter loss means that the company will have a
substantial loss for the current year; through the first nine
months, it had a loss of $14.2 million, including a
restructuring charge of $1 million, on revenue of $25.8
million. For all of fiscal 1989, Phoenix had a loss of $7.7
million, including a charge of $5.5 million, on revenue of
$52.6 million.</p>
