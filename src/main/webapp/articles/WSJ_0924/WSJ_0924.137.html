	<p class="article-leader">French industrial holding company Chargeurs S.A. posted a
67% rise in net profit after payments to minority interests
in the first half of 1990, largely as a result of gains from
the sale of airline UTA to Air France.
   The company said net profit came to 1.54 billion francs
($292 million), up from 921 million francs in the year-ago
half. Chargeurs recorded a one-time capital gain of 1.55
billion francs from the UTA sale.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Disregarding financial gains, the group's operating profit
was actually down 48% to 219 million francs from 422 million
a year earlier.</p>
<p>Consolidated revenue, meanwhile, fell 41% to 6.11 billion
francs from 10.47 billion. The latest figure takes account of
a marked decline in textile sector sales.</p>
