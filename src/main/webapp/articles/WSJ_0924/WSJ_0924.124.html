	<p class="article-leader">Electrolux AB of Sweden, an appliance concern, put up for
sale its commercial services division, in an effort to
concentrate on its core operations of making and selling
consumer and industrial equipment. It didn't disclose an
asking price.
   The commercial services unit, which has 30,000 employees
world-wide in environmental cleaning and janitorial services,
had 1989 revenue of 3.9 billion kronor ($675.1 million), and
profit after depreciation of 260 million kronor, the company
said. It accounts for only about 5% of Electrolux's business.
Electrolux said the division's profit and revenue for this
year are expected to increase.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>An official, explaining the decision to sell, said the
business "differs markedly in character from other areas" of
the company. The unit's sale will mean that "the capital
which will be released will increase our freedom of action in
future developments in our main areas," the official said.</p>
