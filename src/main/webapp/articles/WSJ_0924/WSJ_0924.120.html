	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- U.S. auto makers plan to build just 9.6% more
cars in the fourth quarter than they did in a weak
year-earlier period, but analysts say those schedules won't
hold if the economy continues to weaken.
   The 10 U.S. auto makers plan to build 1,741,955 cars in
the fourth quarter, up from production of 1,589,215 in 1989's
final quarter, according to industry sources. But the latest
output plans are still the second-lowest since 1982, when a
recession-wracked industry built just 1.2 million cars. Some
analysts say auto makers will have to trim their
fourth-quarter plans or face bloated inventories at year end.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Meanwhile, there are signs that higher fuel prices are
prompting some Americans to buy smaller cars. That bodes well
for Japanese auto makers who are boosting their U.S. output,
and also for new small cars from Ford Motor Co. and General
Motors Corp. GM's new Saturn division will launch its
subcompact models late next month, and Ford is stepping up
efforts to spur sales of its 1991 Escort subcompacts.</p>
<p>But sales of some of Detroit's larger models are starting
to suffer. GM, blaming sluggish sales, said last week it will
idle the plant that builds the big, V-8 powered Chevrolet
Caprice until Oct. 8, and operate just one production shift
for the following four weeks. GM had a 96-days' supply of the
cars at the end of August, nearly 50% above the ideal level.</p>
<p>The slowdown in sales of the newly redesigned Caprice
reflects a shift toward smaller cars in recent weeks. In
August, compact cars accounted for 24.7% of all cars sold in
the U.S., up from 23.3% a year earlier. Meanwhile, full-sized
cars such as the Caprice saw their share of the market drop
to 6.2% from 7.0% in August 1989, according to the industry
trade publication Ward's Automotive Reports.</p>
<p>But analysts warned the auto industry could be headed for
a broad slowdown as higher gas prices and uncertainty over
the Persian Gulf buffet an already shaky U.S. economy.</p>
<p>"Consumers have led this economy into and out of
recession," said John Casesa, an auto industry analyst with
Wertheim Schroeder in New York. "And it looks to me like
right now they're leading us into one."</p>
<p>If U.S. auto makers are to maintain their current
production schedules without boosting inventories, cars will
have to sell at a rate of seven million units in the quarter,
says John Qualls, an analyst with Hill & Knowlton Inc. in St.
Louis. That's roughly the pace sales have averaged since
early July. But Mr. Qualls said more gloomy economic news
could depress sales below that level.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Japanese auto makers still plan to make
gains, largely at the expense of the Big Three. Honda Motor
Corp. is planning to build 26% more cars in the fourth
quarter than a year ago, reflecting increased production from
a new plant in East Liberty, Ohio. Honda also is planning to
boost by around 30,000 cars the number of Civic sedans it
imports to make up for production lost during the startup of
the East Liberty factory.</p>
<p>Here are the output plans for the fourth quarter:</p>

<p>As the third quarter closed, Detroit continued to shave
its original output plans for the period. Ford last week said
it would idle two of its U.S. car plants and one truck plant
this week because of sluggish sales. In all, Ford has cut
45,000 cars out of its original third-quarter production
schedules. The company now plans to build 311,199 cars in the
July to September period, down 8.1% from a year ago. GM,
meanwhile, cut about 20,000 cars out of its original
third-quarter production schedule within the last month.</p>
