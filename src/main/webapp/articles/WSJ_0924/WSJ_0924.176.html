	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- In July 1989, just weeks before American
Express admitted its secret campaign against Swiss banker
Edmond Safra, Robert F. Smith retired as chairman of American
Express Bank. At the time, the company gave no explanation
for Mr. Smith's departure from the post he had held for
nearly five years.
   In fact, several former American Express executives say,
Mr. Smith was under pressure to resign after company lawyers
spent months investigating a series of questionable financial
transactions, including dealings between a prominent Mexican
businessman and Mr. Smith's son, a Shearson Lehman Hutton
stockbroker in Boston; bank payments to contractors on a home
Mr. Smith was building on New Hampshire's Lake Winnipesaukee;
and the banker's purchase of a $40,000 antique car with a
check from American Express bank.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Both Mr. Smith and American Express assert that no
evidence was found of illegal activity on Mr. Smith's part.
Mr. Smith admits only to a single technical violation of New
York state banking laws. In a statement, American Express
said: "Any allegations or suggestions that Bob Smith caused
the company or its clients any losses or that he
misappropriated company or client funds are totally
incorrect. Mr. Smith was a dedicated professional who made
important contributions to the company during his tenure."</p>
<p>Former aides defend Mr. Smith's conduct, saying the banker
was the victim of an internal struggle with former American
Express president Louis Gerstner, whose corporate allies so
disliked Mr. Smith they referred to him as "Hitler." These
people say Mr. Smith angered Mr. Gerstner by, among other
things, refusing to report to him instead of James Robinson.</p>
<p>While playing down Mr. Gerstner's role in his departure,
Mr. Smith acknowledges the breach with the former American
Express president, whom he terms "an arch enemy." After Mr.
Smith refused to report to him, "Gerstner was taking snipes
at me whatever I would do," Mr. Smith says now. Mr. Gerstner
now chief executive of RJR Nabisco Inc., declines comment.
Others trace Mr. Smith's fall from favor to 1987, when he and
other executives looked into the possibility of buying
American Express Bank in a leveraged-buy-out.</p>
<p>Mr. Smith's formal troubles began in 1988, when company
accountants called into question his dealings with the
Mexican businessman, a major American Express Bank client who
had opened brokerage accounts with Mr. Smith's son Robert at
Shearson's Boston office.</p>
<p>"We had difficulties with the guy. He threatened to move
his account," says Mr. Smith. "He wasn't happy with our
service. I said, `Look, we'll put the account over with my
son, but basically I'll manage it for you.'" Mr. Smith was
cleared of any conflict of interest after a lengthy internal
review, according to him and some of his associates.</p>
<p>No sooner was that matter resolved than investigators
questioned Mr. Smith's use of bank funds to purchase a 1954
Cadillac Eldorado convertible. According to Mr. Smith and
another former bank executive, Mr. Smith had approached
Robert Budenbender, the bank's chief financial officer,
several years before and asked for a $100,000 cashier's check
to use as proof of credit at an auction of antique cars. An
avid car collector, Mr. Smith agreed not to use the check to
purchase a car, since doing so might amount to an
unauthorized loan. He used the check twice as agreed, but on
a third occasion he used it to purchase the 1954 Cadillac.
The following week, these people say, Mr. Smith gave Mr.
Budenbender a $40,000 personal check to reimburse the bank.</p>
<p>"Technically," Mr. Smith acknowledges, "that's a violation
of New York state bnaking laws. Theoretically, I should have
gone down to another bank and gotten my own check. I should
have done it with someone other than my own bank."</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Smith acknowledges that he authorized the use
of bank funds to repay contractors working on his New
Hampshire home. Mr. Smith says this was done as a convenience
while he was on overseas trips, that the amounts involved
were minuscule and that he promplty repaid them each time he
returned.</p>
<p>Mr. Smith denies being pressured to resign, saying he
elected to retire after tiring of corporate politics.
Whatever the case, he remained an American Express consultant
for a year after his retirement. He now lives in New
Hampshire.</p>
