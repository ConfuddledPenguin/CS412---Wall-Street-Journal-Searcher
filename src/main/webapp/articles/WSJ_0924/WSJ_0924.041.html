	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Donald E. Petersen, who led Ford Motor Co.'s
financial and product revival in the 1980s, plans to write a
book expounding his people-oriented management philosophy.
   Those curious about the former Ford chairman's
sometimes-rocky relationship with members of the Ford family
or gossip about the company's internal politics apparently
will be disappointed. Mr. Petersen and his co-author, USA
Today financial writer John Hillkirk, plan not an
autobiography but a "new way of looking at corporations using
examples from (Mr. Petersen's) experience at Ford," said
Henry Ferris, the Houghton Mifflin Co. senior editor in
charge of the project.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It's a very idea-oriented book," Mr. Ferris added. The
work, as yet untitled, is due out next fall.</p>
<p>Mr. Petersen retired from Ford in March, two years earlier
than expected. During his tenure at the top, he tirelessly
preached the gospel of teamwork, and pushed the company's
product planners to put appealing designs and quality ahead
of short-term profits. But profits, specifically Ford's feat
in outearning General Motors Corp. from 1986 to 1988, are
what established Mr. Petersen as one of American industry's
most admired figures during the past decade.</p>
<p>How much, if any, profit Mr. Petersen will get from his
book venture isn't clear. Houghton Mifflin declined to
discuss its advance. The publisher is expected to order a
first printing of about 50,000 to 75,000 copies.</p>
