	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Continuing to pare marginal foreign operations
as it comes under pressure at home, Lloyds Bank PLC has put
its Asian banking operations on the block, according to
people familiar with the decision.
   These people said Lloyds has retained the investment
banker Morgan Stanley & Co. in London to sell its four
commercial-retail branch offices in Asia, and its Australian
and New Zealand bank units. The four branches are in Tokyo,
Hong Kong, Singapore and Seoul.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A Lloyds spokesman said that he had heard "market
speculation" the operations were for sale, but that the bank,
one of Britain's four largest, "has a standard rule about not
commenting on market speculation." Morgan Stanley declined to
comment.</p>
<p>Lloyds generally doesn't break out overseas results by
country, but all international operations in the first half
earned #71 million ($133.1 million) before taxes, double the
year-earlier performance, and accounted for 17% of the bank's
pretax earnings. But earnings of its National Bank of New
Zealand unit, included in the overall international figure,
were flat at #17 million.</p>
<p>Lloyds has divested itself of a number of peripheral units
in recent months. The spokesman said this was "the general
strategy of the bank. Where we aren't a strong player and
aren't getting a reasonable return on equity, we have moved
out." He declined to say whether this strategy applied to
Lloyds's Asian operations.</p>
<p>The bank's international operations were built with an eye
toward making Lloyds a world banking power. But like many
other major U.S. and British banks with similar dreams,
Lloyds was blindsided in the 1980s by the Third World debt
crisis.</p>
<p>Though it has shored up that debt exposure with massive
reserves, Lloyds, along with its British counterparts, has
found another specter looming. Loans to British businesses,
mainly in construction and real estate, have become
increasingly risky, as high interest rates have hobbled
building and accelerated business failures in several
sectors.</p>
<p>In the first half, Lloyds more than tripled its domestic
loan charges to #190 million from #60 million. The bank's
first-half pretax profit of #408 million, though more than
quadruple the year-earlier #93 million, disappointed many
investors, mainly because of the riskier domestic loan
exposure. Lloyds shares closed Friday at 235 pence, down 2
pence, equaling its 1990 low. The shares have traded as high
as 316 pence this year.</p>
<p>In June, Lloyds sold its Portuguese operations to
Madrid-based Banco Bilbao Vizcaya for an undisclosed sum. In
February, it sold Lloyds Bank Canada to Hongkong & Shanghai
Banking Corp. for 190 million Canadian dollars (US$164.5
million). That same month, it sold its stake in Yorkshire
Bank PLC to National Bank of Australia. And last September,
it sold its U.S. commercial banking unit to Daiwa Bank of
Japan for $200 million.</p>
<p>The sales helped produce a #94 million extraordinary gain
in the first half. Most of the gain came from the sale of the
Yorkshire Bank stake, though the U.S. and Canadian sales
contributed a total of #11 million.</p>
