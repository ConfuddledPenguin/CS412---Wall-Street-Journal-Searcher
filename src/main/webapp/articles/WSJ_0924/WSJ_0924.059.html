	<p class="article-leader">By the time this appears the first installment of "The
Civil War" will have aired on PBS. Continuing tonight through
Thursday, this extraordinary series by filmmaker Ken Burns
brings the American Civil War to life as no history has ever
been brought to life on a screen, including the large one
called the movies. This may sound like a large claim but it
is an understatement itself compared with the critical praise
already-deservedly-heaped on these 11 hours. What hours. What
history. Diary excerpts, letters, paintings, lithographs,
3,000 photographs, contemporary footage (of the old
battlegrounds), music and narrative all were fused to produce
a whole of the most remarkable immediacy.
   The bitterness and gallantry and slaughter pour out in
unhurried detail. The war is in the living room. Here are the
armies, the generals, the music, the food, the battle of the
ironclad ships Monitor and Merrimack, the battle of Shiloh,
where 2,400 died, Cold Harbor, where 7,000 men perished in 20
minutes, and Antietam. Also, the South's madly heroic Nathan
Bedford Forrest, who wheeled his horse around and charged
directly at a mob of Union troops in hot pursuit, ultimately
yanking one up on his horse for use as a shield. Here are
Grant and his friend Sherman, and the president actually
shown (via photographs) leaving the field after the speech at
Gettysburg. The sense of actuality produced by Mr. Burns's
camera and his still photos grows, so that by the time we
come to the Gettysburg Address (read by Sam Waterston) it is
hard to remember that this is not the real Lincoln, whom we
have after all just seen walk through the crowd after an
address he considered a dismal failure.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It helps, of course, that history here is reported largely
in 19th-century prose culled from diaries and letters of
enormous eloquence. This was not a tongue-tied age. It is
impossible to forget the words of Maj. Sullivan Ballou of the
Second Rhode Island Volunteers, who sent a letter to his wife
just a few weeks before his death at the Battle of Bull Run.</p>
<p>The major wrote of his certainty that American
civilization depended on the triumph of the government. "I am
willing, perfectly willing, to lay down all my joys in this
life to help preserve this government . . . My love for you
is deathless, it seems to bind me with mighty cables. And yet
my love of country comes over me like a strong wind and bears
me with all those chains to the battlefield . . . If I do not
return, dear Sarah, never forget how much I loved you . . . I
shall always be with you in the brightest day and the darkest
night -- always, always."</p>
<p>Here also are the letters written by former slaves, and
Frederick Douglass, played by Morgan Freeman. Mr. Burns
ranged far and wide to assemble his cast of voices, which
include Arthur Miller as William Tecumseh Sherman and Studs
Terkel in the role of Gen. Benjamin Butler. Then there's Jody
Powell. It's hard to absorb the notion of Jody as Stonewall
Jackson, whom a contemporary describes as a "pious blue-eyed
killer" who sucked constantly on lemons and was utterly
untroubled by the likelihood of death.</p>
<p>Never before had so many aspects of war found so many
chroniclers among a citizenry. Even the decisive moment
spelling the end has its witness, a fellow worshipper who
recorded the sudden ashen look of Confederacy President
Jefferson Davis as he read a hopeless note from Gen. Lee,
slipped into his hand during services. In 11 hours layered,
however delicately, with almost nothing but vignettes of the
rawest emotional force -- Lee's last hours with his weary
troops, the surrender at Appomattox, the salute of the Union
troops as Lee departs -- these are the events most likely to
threaten a viewer's composure. Many elements prepare the way
for that effect, among them old patriotic tunes that lose no
character for all that they are turned into a dirge. A lot of
people this week are going to find themselves singing, "The
Union forever, hurrah boys hurrah]" and similar lyrics not
heard in shower stalls for some time. Mississippi author and
Civil War historian Shelby Foote, a vivid presence throughout
this series, will win new fans. It took the 37-year-old Mr.
Burns, a documentary filmmaker (whose previous subjects were
Huey Long and the Brooklyn Bridge), five years to accomplish
this work, whose equal we are not likely to see soon again.</p>

<p>In another part of the forest, we have NBC's new series,
"American Dreamer," from "Family Ties" creator Gary David
Goldberg, who appears to be in some other business instead of
comedy this season. Some business with a lot of contemporary
relationship-babble on its mind. Like a lot of new shows,
this one also has its quotient of physiological jokes,
grunts, people guzzling and slobbering water and looking
repellent -- all the wild, wonderful wit in short that our TV
writers have decided the world is yearning for. In addition
to this problem, there is the lead, Robert Urich, an actor
born to spew earnestness if ever there was one. Shouldn't it
occur to somebody -- the producers, say -- that an actor's
gift for comedy or lack of one is an issue to consider when
handing out lead roles in a sitcom? On the other hand, the
show has two bright spots. One is Carol Kane in the role of a
secretary, and the other is the splendidly mordant Jeffrey
Tambor. Both of them know what a comic line is, which is a
lot more than one can say of the writers.</p>
