	<p class="article-leader">BEIJING -- China's foreign trade dropped 2.04% in the
first eight months of this year, because imports fell 16% to
$32.08 billion, compared with year-earlier levels, the
official Xinhua News Agency said, citing customs figures.
Exports rose 15% to $36.27 billion.
   In August, exports grew 15% and imports fell 10% from a
year earlier. The data exclude items imported for foreign
investment and raw materials exchanged for processing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The drop in imports is part of China's strict government
austerity program instituted in late 1988 to bring down
inflation that peaked at nearly 40%. Imports of foreign
cigarettes, liquor, luxury cars and certain electronics have
all been banned. August prices rose only 2.7% from a year
earlier.</p>
