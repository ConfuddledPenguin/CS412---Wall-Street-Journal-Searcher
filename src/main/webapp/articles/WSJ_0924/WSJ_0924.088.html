	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- Researchers at Emory University say a new
treatment could lead to a cure for the symptoms of
Parkinson's disease, the muscular ailment that affects more
than 350,000 Americans.
   The research, published in the current issue of Science
magazine, involves the subthalamic nucleus, a part of the
brain that scientists previously regarded as being
unconnected to Parkinson's.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>By deactivating cells in the nucleus, however, researchers
found they could relieve the tremors and loss of muscle
control that characterize the disease.</p>
<p>The study indicates this particular part of the brain "is
playing an important role in producing the signs and symptoms
of Parkinson's disease," said Mahlon DeLong, a physician and
chairman of the department of neurology at Emory. "Knowing
this, we can design better forms of treatment for the
disorder."</p>
<p>The next step will be to perform additional tests on
monkeys, Dr. DeLong said, noting that surgical treatment or
medicine for humans is still "some years away."</p>
<p>But he characterized the current research as encouraging.
"It gives us a better idea of where the problem is," he said.</p>
