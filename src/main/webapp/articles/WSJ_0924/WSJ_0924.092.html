	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Charles H. Keating Jr. remained behind bars
after a California state-court judge refused to reduce the $5
million bail imposed early last week on the indicted former
chairman of American Continental Corp.
   The unusual two-day bail hearing, filled with allegations
by the state of deception by the four defendants and
countercharges of prosecutorial grandstanding, presages a
contentious trial for the 66-year-old Arizona businessman.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The indictment launched the first criminal case resulting
from the 1989 collapse of Lincoln Savings, among the largest
thrift failures ever.</p>
<p>The state alleges that Mr. Keating and three associates
made fraudulent claims in selling unsecured American
Continental subordinated debentures through the Phoenix,
Ariz., holding company's Lincoln branches in California.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said they identified 17,458 of about 23,000
bondholders who incurred losses totaling $250 million when
American Continental filed for federal bankruptcy-court
protection last April, rendering the bonds practically
worthless.</p>
<p>Judge Gary Klausner, who stunned defendants last Tuesday
with bail far higher than amounts they had informally
discussed before surrendering to the Los Angeles County
district attorney's office, again surprised Stephen C. Neal,
a Keating attorney, on Friday. Mr. Neal argued that his
client's bail should be reduced because there was a low risk
he would flee from prosecution.</p>
<p>The embattled Mr. Keating, who claims that his liabilities
exceed assets by $5.2 million, is interested only "in
preparing a vigorous, strong defense" against the various
criminal and civil charges facing him, the lawyer said.</p>
<p>But after sharply lowering the $1 million bail for the
other defendants, the judge said that the "picture painted
here . . .  {of} creditors knocking at the door and lawsuits
all around him" gives Mr. Keating "significant reasons not to
stay around." Of the $5 million bail, Judge Klausner noted
that "simple calculation will tell you it's 2% of what the
actual loss was."</p>
<p>District Attorney Ira Reiner hailed the high bail as an
example for white-collar criminals, saying Mr. Keating's mug
shot "ought to be posted in every boardroom in the United
States." Mr. Reiner, who led a seven-month grand jury
investigation of American Continental's bond-sales practices,
told a news conference: "Whether someone wears an expensive
suit or a cheap mask, stealing is stealing."</p>
<p>Asked about why a man once considered among Arizona's
leading citizens would flee, Mr. Reiner said one "can't
escape the thought of Robert Vesco in a case like this." Mr.
Vesco, accused of masterminding the huge I.O.S. Ltd.
investment scam, fled in 1973 to Central America and remains
a wealthy fugitive.</p>
<p>Mr. Reiner brushed off criticism of his office by the
judge, who expressed from the bench being "troubled" by how
prosecutors first favored much lower bail, then urged no
reduction. Defense attorneys suggested the change in position
reflected the heavy anti-Keating publicity the case has
garnered.</p>
<p>Mr. Keating wore the rumpled blue suit he exchanged for
county-jail grays for his court appearances, and seemed at
ease as Mr. Neal addressed the two factors the judge
identified as central in bail determination: risk of flight
and the seriousness of the offense.</p>
<p>Mr. Neal said Mr. Keating "has never failed to appear at
any hearing or interview he was scheduled for" in the
numerous inquiries since Lincoln's seizure by federal
regulators. He also noted lower "presumptive bail" amounts
that the court recommends for violent crimes-$50,000, for
example, in a kidnapping with intent to commit a sexual
offense and $10,000 in terrorism cases.</p>
<p>Mr. Neal, who later told reporters he planned to appeal,
said in court that a debt-laden Mr. Keating could post bail
of only $500,000 if several family members encumbered their
houses and other assets. Financial records were produced
showing a net worth of $40 million in 1987, when his American
Continental compensation was about $3 million and he was a
large political contributor. But most assets listed were in
now-worthless American Continental stock.</p>
<p>Prosecutors, in their questioning, have hinted that Mr.
Keating is hiding assets accumulated during the five years
American Continental owned Lincoln. They noted that in ruling
against Mr. Keating's own suit challenging the thrift's
seizure, a federal judge said transfers of funds to American
Continental "amounted to a looting of Lincoln."</p>
<p>After the judge reduced bail to $200,000 for American
Continental's former president, Judy E. Wischer, and to
$100,000 for former Lincoln presidents Robin S. Symes and Ray
C. Fidel, the three posted bail and were released. Mr. Reiner
said he expects the trial of the four, who each face maximum
sentences of 10 years in prison and fines of $10,000, to
begin before year end.</p>
