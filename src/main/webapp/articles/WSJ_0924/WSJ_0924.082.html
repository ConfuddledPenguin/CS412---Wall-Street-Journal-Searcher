	<p class="article-leader">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Index Technology Corp. will introduce
tomorrow a product to help corporate software experts update
old mainframe software programs, Richard Carpenter, chairman
and chief executive officer, said.
   The product, XL/Recover, marks a move into a new area of
the software-engineering field that Index helped pioneer. It
will be available next week. Index, the nation's biggest
maker of products for the computer-aided software-engineering
market, known as CASE, has previously made software tools to
improve the productivity of programmers writing new programs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In an interview, Mr. Carpenter said the XL/Recover
software program, which will sell for $9,800 and runs on
IBM-compatible personal computers, "is a major thrust in our
offerings for 1991." He declined to predict sales but said it
will "probably account for 10% to 25% of revenue" in the
future.</p>
<p>Last year, Index earned $2.3 million, or 50 cents a share,
on revenue of $38 million. During this year, Index has
continued to grow rapidly, but earnings have declined.
First-half net was $961,000, or 20 cents a share, down 21%
from $1.2 million, or 27 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose 39% to $24.4 million from $17.5 million.</p>
<p>Mr. Carpenter declined to predict earnings for the current
quarter or the rest of the year. "This is continuing to be an
investment year for Index. The good thing is we're beginning
to get the results of all that investment into the
marketplace," he said.</p>
<p>The company's new product addresses what should be a
substantial market, Mr. Carpenter said. He added that in most
companies, 60% to 80% of the software-development budget is
spent adjusting old software programs to address new business
conditions rather than designing new programs. For example,
when a company eliminates a layer of bureaucracy in the
credit-approval department, software has to be rewritten to
make sure that bills don't still require approvals from those
job titles.</p>
<p>XL/Recovery helps systems analysts look at the old COBOL
software code that runs on most companies' mainframe
computers. It can read the code, determine the logic and
business rules used in the application, and draw charts of
the structure of the code, making it easy for programmers to
see how changing one part of the program will affect other
parts.</p>
<p>Several other companies, including Cambridge-based Bachman
Information Systems Inc., already make programs that
automatically turn old COBOL "spaghetti code" that is
extremely complex and hard for humans to follow into
better-organized code. But Index said XL/Recovery goes beyond
that by capturing information about both the data involved
and the process by which it is manipulated.</p>
<p>John Dunkle, an analyst with WorkGroup Technologies Inc.,
Hampton, N.H., said, "Other CASE vendors are talking about
this capability, but nobody is delivering it yet." He added
that for Index to pioneer the technology is surprising
because "usually the largest companies in any market are
somewhat sluggish. The small companies usually tend to
introduce technologies faster."</p>
<p>Mr. Carpenter said the company plans a major publicity
campaign starting tomorrow. He said: "We're very eager to see
how folks respond to it. We have to wait to see the market
reception." He added that Index plans several other
significant product announcements later this year, but he
declined to comment on the products involved.</p>
