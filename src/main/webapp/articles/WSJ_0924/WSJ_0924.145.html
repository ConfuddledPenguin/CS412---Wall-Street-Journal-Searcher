	<p class="article-leader">Salant Corp., an apparel maker operating under protection
of the bankruptcy laws, reported its fiscal second-quarter
net loss widened to $33.3 million from nearly $9 million a
year earlier.
   On a per-share basis, Salant's loss for the second period,
ended June 26, amounted to $9.64 compared with $2.62. Sales,
which were hurt by weakness at the retail level, fell 31% to
$77.4 million from $101.4 million. Sales also were
interrupted in the two weeks before Salant filed its
bankruptcy-law petition, the company said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For July, the New York company posted nearly $2.4 million
in profit on $43.2 million of sales. The profit reflected
factors including the elimination of interest expense on
Salant's debt; the company neither accrues nor pays such
interest while it operates under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy
Code.</p>
<p>Salant also estimated that in August it earned more than
July's profit on some $54 million of sales.</p>
