	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Are Japan's medium-sized securities companies
headed for trouble?
   As the Tokyo Stock Exchange sinks, the pubs and noodle
shops around Kabutocho, the stock market district, have
buzzed with worried talk of a shakeout in Japan's
once-prosperous securities industry.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>With stock prices down 40% in the past nine months and
trading volume down by nearly two-thirds, Japan's brokers
have good reason to be nervous.</p>
<p>The first clear signs that the market's reversal has taken
its toll on the Japanese securities industry surfaced two
weeks ago. Japan's Big Four -- Nomura Securities Co., Daiwa
Securities Co., Nikko Securities Co. and Yamaichi Securities
Co. -- drastically cut pretax earnings projections for the
half-year ending Sept. 30.</p>
<p>Nomura said pretax profit would drop almost 50% to 125
billion yen ($908.1 million) in the first half. At Daiwa,
officials projected a 62% decline, while Nikko and Yamaichi
said earnings would plunge 73% and almost 75%, respectively.
The projected profits are about a third of what the firms
previously estimated. Pretax earnings are the clearest
indication of the firms' operating results.</p>
<p>At the moment, few worry that the Big Four are in serious
difficulty. Although it's also not clear sailing for the
four: On Friday, Standard & Poor's Corp. said it now has a
negative long-term outlook for the big securities companies,
but added that it won't necessarily lower the houses'
ratings. S&P said its new opinion reflects sharply lower
earnings expectations and uncertainty about when and how long
any rebound would last, but said the four maintain good
financial positions.</p>
<p>But at midsized securities firms, which have high fixed
costs and rely more heavily on equity brokerage commissions,
the shock of a suddenly depressed market is proving harder to
withstand. Many of the second-tier securities houses are
projecting midterm earnings declines of more than 75%.
Midsized brokerages -- many of which were in the middle of
expanding operations -- will have trouble shrugging off those
declines.</p>
<p>"The big brokers can take a hit more easily," says Stuart
Matthews, a financial analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd
Securities Ltd. "Medium-sized firms aren't as diversified, so
when revenue from commissions dries up there isn't much for
them to fall back on."</p>
<p>The plight of Japan's midsized firms may be best
illustrated by difficulties faced in recent days by Sanyo
Securities Co., Japan's only major family-run brokerage
house.</p>
<p>Just a few years ago, the firm was flying high. Buoyed by
soaring stock prices, Sanyo -- Japan's eighth-largest
securities company in terms of revenue and trading volume --
racked up record profits. With Tokyo stocks climbing into the
stratosphere, Sanyo's ambitious young president, Yoichiro
Tsuchiya, decided the time was right for a bid to join the
ranks of the major securities houses. He pushed Sanyo, which
is 12.8%-owned by company controlled by Nomura Securities,
into new types of trading, such as warrants and futures,
increased staff by more than a third and significantly
expanded international operations.</p>
<p>The centerpeice of Mr. Tsuchiya's bold vision for Sanyo's
future was an eight billion yen trading center replete with
giant wall-to-wall electronic display boards, lightning-fast
computers and a daunting array of gee-whiz telecommunications
equipment.</p>
<p>Mr. Tsuchiya -- who declined requests for an interview --
told a monthly magazine soon after the center was opened that
he felt the trading center was necessary to bolster the
confidence of his sales force. "When a strong tailwind is
blowing, victory goes to the boat with the biggest sail," he
was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>But Mr. Tsuchiya's strategy may have run aground. Earlier
this month, the market was abuzz with unsubstantiated reports
that Sanyo was about to lose as much as 50 billion yen in the
futures market. Other rumors suggested that Sanyo was in
danger of losing billions of yen from its holdings of
commercial paper issued by a recently failed New Zealand
investment bank. Reports about Sanyo's position in the
futures market appear to have been false. The contracts were
said to expire Sept. 13, but that deadline passed without
noticeable interruption of Sanyo's business.</p>
<p>Sanyo officials confirm, however, that the firm holds $90
million in commercial paper issued by DFC New Zealand Ltd., a
formerly state-owned investment bank that floundered after
being privatized. But while acknowledging that they haven't
been able to collect on the loans -- which came due in
October 1989 -- Sanyo officials say they still believe the
firm will get most of its money back. "The conclusion on this
matter has yet to be drawn," said a Sanyo spokesman. "We
aren't worried about this at all," he added, "because it is
an issue with the New Zealand government."</p>
<p>As if the talk about Sanyo isn't bad enough, some traders
have begun whispering that Sanyo's trading operations are
sinking -- not financially, but physically. Rumors have it
that Sanyo's giant trading floor, erected on a swath of
reclaimed land along the Tokyo waterfront, is slowly receding
into the muck. Sanyo officials say the reports are
preposterous.</p>
<p>If Sanyo or any other securities firms are really
floundering, it is doubtful that Japan's financial
authorities would let them drown. When Yamaichi Securities
teetered on the brink of collapse in 1965, officials at the
Bank of Japan intervened to pump it full of emergency funds.
Many here think regulators at the central bank and the
Ministry of Finance remain ready to rescue the nation's
securities institutions before they fail.</p>

<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>Tokyo stock prices rebounded strongly from midday lows in
the last hour of the session Friday, posting the first daily
gain in seven trading days.</p>
<p>The Nikkei Index of 225 issues was up 174.85 points at
23777.83.</p>
<p>Financial markets in Tokyo were closed for a public
holiday Monday.</p>
<p>Friday's volume on the first section was estimated at 430

were unchanged.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section gained was up 1.80 points, or 0.10%, to
1769.77.</p>
<p>In London, stocks ended higher and at intraday peaks after
staging a major recovery from morning lows triggered by
widespread stock-index futures selling.</p>
<p>Once the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index
dropped below 2000, "buyers just came out of the woodwork," a
trader said. The FT-SE 100 closed up 8.6 points at 2025.5.
The Financial Times 30 Share Index rose 6.3 points to 1537.3.
Volume was 553.7 million shares, compared with Thursday's

Stockholm ended at 1990 lows. South African gold stocks

Manila and Singapore, mixed in Seoul and higher in Taipei.</p>
<p>Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.</p>
