	<p class="article-leader">SALISBURY, Md. -- Second National Federal Savings Bank,
facing a deteriorating real-estate market, suspended its
dividend and increased its loan-loss reserves following an
investigation by federal regulators.
   Second National increased specific loan-loss reserves by
$7,880,000 and general loan reserves by $8,750,000. The
company said it plans to increase general loan reserves an
additional $8,750,000 over the next 18 months.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company, which has $1.8 billion in assets, said it
decided to suspend the dividend because it wouldn't be the
"most prudent expenditure of shareholder capital." The
company's quarterly payout had been nine cents a share, but
last month, Second National announced it intended to cut the
dividend 50%.</p>
<p>Second National said real-estate developers aren't able to
"produce sufficient cash flow to support their borrowings"
and more stringent reserve requirements "have precluded
additional borrowing for interest carry."</p>
<p>The company's nonperforming assets have risen to $62
million from $30 million in March.</p>
