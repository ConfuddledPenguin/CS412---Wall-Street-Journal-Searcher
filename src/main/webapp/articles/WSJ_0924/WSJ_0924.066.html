	<p class="article-leader">SANTA MONICA, Calif. -- Management Co. Entertainment Group
Inc. said it retained Neilson, Elggren, Durkin & Co., an
accounting firm, to conduct an internal investigation into
"certain corporate transactions."
   The company said it took the step due to "certain recent
allegations of corporate misconduct." A profile of the
troubled independent movie production company appeared in
this newspaper on Sept. 13th. Jonathan D. Krane, chairman and
chief executive officer, resigned on Sept. 14th.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>MCEG is in default on more than $100 million in debt, and
movie director Nicolas Roeg and two other creditors have
taken steps to force the company into liquidation. MCEG has
been hurriedly negotiating with creditors, including the GE
Capital unit of General Electric Co., and potential investors
in an effort to reach a restructuring agreement.</p>
<p>The company also said on Friday that it has halted an
unusual commercial paper program created last July with the
help of the General Electric's Kidder Peabody & Co. unit. The
program was hailed by analysts as the first financing of its
type in the entertainment industry, but questions have been
raised recently about the value of the underlying security.</p>
<p>The paper was backed by foreign film receivables -- or
money owed to MCEG by overseas distributors for the licensing
rights to future films. The company persuaded Bayerische
Vereinsbank AG (Union Bank of Bavaria) to guarantee the
paper, and it was sold through Kidder Peabody, allowing MCEG
to raise a total of $26 million.</p>
<p>However, the Bavarian bank decided to halt the program
last week after a monthlong review of the underlying
securities, says Raymond H. Godfrey, president and chief
executive officer of MCEG. On Thursday, he says, the bank
paid holders of the paper about $19 million, the full amount
owed, and the bank is now left with the foreign receivables.
"They decided it wasn't the type of business they wanted to
be in," says Mr. Godfrey.</p>
<p>Officials at the bank didn't return calls on Friday. Early
last week, Walter Koch, a vice president of the bank said,
"There are some questions about the security but I don't have
all the details. If anyone has a problem it's us."</p>
<p>It isn't clear how much the bank may lose. The security
includes certain rights to five MCEG movies which haven't yet
been released including, "Chains of Gold," starring John
Travolta, and "Boris and Natasha," starring Sally Kellerman,
the wife of Mr. Krane.</p>
<p>Stuart B. Rekant, an MCEG executive vice president who
masterminded the program, said early last week that the
delayed delivery of MCEG movies has created "timing gaps" in
payments by overseas distributors. Mr. Rekant didn't return
calls on Friday.</p>
<p>An internal MCEG letter indicates there are problems with
other receivables. MCEG acquired Virgin Vision Ltd., a
British distribution company, from Richard Bramson's Virgin
Group last July for $83 million. Shortly before the
acquisition, MCEG sold Virgin Vision certain rights to movies
from its Manson International film library for $3 million.</p>
<p>Mr. Rekant says the $3 million in Virgin Vision
receivables were among those that backed the commercial
paper. However, in a letter dated Aug. 1, 1990, Peter Coles,
director of acquisitions and business affairs of MCEG Virgin
Vision, charged that the value of those rights was "grossly
misrepresented" by MCEG's unit. The letter demands
cancellation of the transaction. Mr. Coles didn't return
calls seeking comment.</p>
