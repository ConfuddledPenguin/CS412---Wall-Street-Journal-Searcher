	<p class="article-leader">Harley-Davidson Inc., signaling troubles in the
recreational-vehicle market, said it is laying off 180
employees, or 10% of the work force at its Holiday Rambler
Corp. subsidiary.
   Harley, based in Milwaukee, cited softness in demand for
recreational vehicles and consumer skittishness prompted by
the Middle East crisis. The company said the layoffs involved
hourly and salaried employees.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The action doesn't appear to be an indication of wider
troubles at the company, which has posted hefty profit
increases, largely as a result of its strong
motorcycle-manufacturing business.</p>
<p>Harley added that it expects to report third-quarter costs
of $1.1 million as a result of closing two operations. The
company said it is discontinuing Holiday Rambler's Aviator
Van Conversions operations in Milwaukee and closing a
Woodland, Calif., facility that produces Utilimaster, a
commercial vehicle.</p>
<p>Harley said the two operations had 1989 combined sales of
$8 million and only $1.6 million for the first six months of
1990.</p>
