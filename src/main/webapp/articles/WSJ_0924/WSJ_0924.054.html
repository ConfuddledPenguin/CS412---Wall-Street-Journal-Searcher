	<p class="article-leader">RENO, Nev. -- It seems the federal government won't be
operating one of the nation's most celebrated brothels after
all: On Friday, a judge lifted the stay order that would have
put a bankruptcy trustee in charge of running The Mustang
Ranch.
   But the federal government will still ultimately be
calling the shots here; by lifting the stay, the judge freed
the Internal Revenue Service to put the brothel on the
selling block.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>An IRS official said the agency planned to seize the
brothel as soon as possible and put it up for sale at a
public auction, probably within about 30 days.</p>
<p>Mustang Ranch shut down last Tuesday, following a
bankruptcy liquidation order. By the following day, the
bankruptcy trustee was trying to reopen the ranch under
federal management, with plans to run it until the government
was able to find a buyer for the brothel.</p>
<p>At the hearing Friday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James
Thompson refused to grant the bankruptcy trustee the
clearance she needed to operate the brothel. The trustee,
Jeri Coppa, told the judge that the county wouldn't allow her
to run the brothel without court permission to assume the
current owner's license. Getting her own license would take
another 90 days.</p>
<p>But the judge declined, ruling that the seven-year battle
between the brothel and the IRS, the brothel's largest
creditor, had gone on long enough.</p>
<p>Even so, the brothel's owners -- Joe and Sally Conforte --
are hoping for a reprieve. "They can't foreclose yet," said
Pete Perry, the Confortes' attorney, because earlier last
week he filed yet another petition for bankruptcy protection
under Chapter 11 -- this time using Mr. Conforte's name. (The
last one was filed by Mrs. Conforte.) To foreclose, the
federal government will have to petition the court yet again.
"We will be filing all kinds of litigation," Mr. Perry added.
"This is an attorney's field day."</p>
<p>Ron Smith, chief of special procedures for the IRS in
Nevada, said the IRS will seek a "clarification" from the
judge on whether Mr. Conforte's latest Chapter 11 filing can
block liquidation. He said that while it may postpone the
sale for a while, it is unlikely to prevent it.</p>
<p>Already, several prospective buyers have called the IRS
office, Mr. Smith said, but "no one's mentioned money at this
point."</p>
<p>In the last few years, the Confortes have attempted
several times, unsuccessfully, to sell Mustang Ranch. They
complain that the sales fell through because of IRS
interference.</p>
<p>The bankruptcy trustee has maintained that the Confortes
were generating interference themselves, by trying to thwart
the government's efforts to operate the 105-room brothel.</p>
<p>The IRS says Mustang Ranch's owners owe $13 million in
back taxes; the Confortes say they own less than half that
amount.</p>
<p>"One of the real tragedies of the thing is that 200 people
are going to be out of work because of this," Mr. Perry said.
And the local economy will be out "millions of dollars," he
said.</p>
<p>Mustang Ranch first opened for business in the late 1950s,
when prostitution was illegal -- but winked at by Nevada
officials. It was legalized by the county in 1971.</p>
