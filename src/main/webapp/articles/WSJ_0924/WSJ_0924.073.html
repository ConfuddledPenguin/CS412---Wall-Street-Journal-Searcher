	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Iraq threatened wide-scale Mideast war and
the U.S. played down diplomatic solutions to the Gulf crisis,
as the Bush administration prepared to send Congress this
week a roughly $10 billion arms package for Saudi Arabia.
   In a statement broadcast yesterday by state-run Radio
Baghdad, Iraq warned that it would destroy Middle East oil
fields and include Israel in an all-out war if the West tried
to "strangle the people of Iraq." The statement, which was
monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus, by wire services, said: "The
oil areas in Saudi Arabia and in other states of the region,
all the oil installations, will be rendered incapable," and
"Israel will be transformed into something different from
what they are now."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Meanwhile, Secretary of State James Baker, yesterday on
NBC's "Meet The Press," reiterated that the U.S. ruled out
any diplomatic compromise regarding United Nations
resolutions demanding that Iraq withdraw from Kuwait and
restore its government.</p>
<p>In fact, Mr. Baker noted that he will be joining other
foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council tomorrow to consider a further tightening of
sanctions against Iraq by imposing an air embargo. He said
that the U.S. had nothing to negotiate about with Baghdad and
that only after Iraq complies fully with the U.N. resolutions
"then you might see some discussions between Kuwait and Iraq"
about their differences.</p>
<p>At the same time, Mr. Baker said, "I don't think we're
running out of nonmilitary-type sanctions," to the Gulf
crisis.</p>
<p>Mr. Baker also said that while the U.S. would continue to
work with the U.N., one exception might be if there were an
Iraq-sponsored terrorist attack against Americans. In this
case, he implied, the administration would make "an
appropriate response" on its own.</p>
<p>The arms sale to Saudi Arabia would be the first phase of
what the administration hopes would be a $20 billion package.
The administration bowed to congressional pressure and split
the package when some legislators, led by pro-Israel members,
complained that Saudi Arabia didn't need all the weapons
immediately and that such a mammoth sale would threaten the
qualitative military edge that the U.S. has guaranteed to
maintain for Israel. Among items the Pentagon is likely to
push to send quickly are TOW anti-tank missiles, which might
be needed in a fight with Iraq, U.S. officials say.</p>
<p>The most high-profile items the administration wants to
sell to Saudi Arabia, including M-1 tanks and 24 F-15 Eagle
fighters, are likely to be put off until the second phase,
which would be submitted to Congress in January or February,
U.S. officials said. The overall package also would include
Patriot Air Defense Missiles and more than 40 tank-killing
Apache helicopters.</p>
<p>A Saudi official said his government "is confident we will
get the entire package in the long run."</p>
<p>Separately, Saudi Arabia over the weekend ordered several
diplomats from Jordan, Yemen and Iraq to leave the country,
asserting that they were involved in spying for Baghdad and
helping to prepare for possible terrorism. The expulsions
reflect the deep rift in the Arab world between those
sympathetic to Iraq and the Persian Gulf states that feel
threatened by Saddam Hussein. U.S. officials say that Persian
Gulf leaders have refused to send any money to Jordan to
compensate for its losses as a result of the international
economic sanctions against Iraq, which Jordan insists it is
honoring.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia also has stepped up pressure on its Southern
neighbor, Yemen, to support the embargo against Iraq. Saudi
officials have withheld millions of dollars of aid they
routinely would have supplied to Yemen in recent weeks. The
Saudi government also withdrew special privileges that
allowed some 750,000 Yemen citizens to work and own property
in the kingdom.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jordan's King Hussein appealed directly to the
American people, in an address broadcast on the Cable News
Network, to support a peaceful resolution of the
confrontation with Iraq. King Hussein asserted that he has
never accepted Iraq's right to invade Kuwait but believed
that Iraq could be persuaded to leave shortly after the
invasion. That chance, he implied, was lost when Saudi Arabia
invited U.S. troops to the kingdom in large numbers.</p>
<p>In Washington, the administration, which has had
widespread domestic support for its responses to Iraqi
aggression, is being criticized for taking too soft a line
toward Saddam Hussein in the weeks before the August
invasion. Yesterday, Mr. Baker said, "I'm not going to deny
what the policy was," but he complained that "now we've got
some 20-20 hindsighting going on."</p>
<p>Mr. Baker defended some State Department officials,
including the U.S. ambassador to Iraq, April Glaspie, who
told Saddam Hussein the U.S. wouldn't get involved in
inter-Arab disputes. But at the same time, he appeared to be
distancing himself from direct responsibility for some of
Ambassador Glaspie's actions. He said, "probably 312,000
cables, or so" go out under his name each year, implying that
he didn't have direct knowledge of the instructions sent to
Ms. Glaspie before her July meeting with Saddam Hussein.</p>
