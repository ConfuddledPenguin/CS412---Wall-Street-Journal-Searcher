	<p class="article-leader">Slowly, with a hint here, a comment there, a question
began to dawn on some American Express executives: Was a top
aide to James D. Robinson III, the company's chairman and
chief executive officer, up to something they would be wise
to steer clear of?
   Harry L. Freeman was given to flashes of both brilliance
and bad judgment, but Mr. Robinson's reliance on him was
unquestioned. The two frequently began their day at 6:45 a.m.
over a pot of coffee in the chairman's corner office. Special
projects were Mr. Freeman's bailiwick, and associates say
that didn't please the company's top lawyers, Gary A. Beller
and Lawrence Ricciardi, who fretted that one of Mr. Freeman's
operations might one day blow up in their faces. "We've got
to stop this guy," Mr. Ricciardi said on more than one
occasion. "He's going to destroy us."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Few knew quite what Mr. Freeman was up to this time, but
it was clear he had targeted one of the company's thorniest
competitors, the international banker Edmond Safra, a man who
some American Express officials were obsessed with defeating.</p>
<p>When Matthew Stover, then an American Express public
relations executive, asked about the project, he says, "I was
always told, `You don't want to know.'" Finally, in the
summer of 1988, Mr. Ricciardi, the lawyer, confronted Mr.
Freeman. "Harry, I don't know what you're up to," he said.
"But if I were you, I'd stop what you're doing immediately."</p>
<p>The warning was apt, but it was too late. In a stunning
disclosure, American Express admitted last year that it had
engaged in a covert campaign to ruin Mr. Safra's reputation
by spreading rumors and articles in the international press.
The company made a painful, public apology for what its
chairman, Mr. Robinson, called an "unauthorized and shameful
effort," and paid $8 million to Mr. Safra and charities he
selected. As part of the agreement, details of this "shameful
effort" were to remain secret.</p>
<p>Afterward Mr. Freeman announced his retirement, saying he
had done nothing wrong, but taking responsibility for the
affair because it had happened "on my watch." Company
officials privately blamed the incident on a handful of
unnamed low-level employees. Other top officials to this day
insist, as one puts it, "no one did anything he believed was
wrong or beyond his authority."</p>
<p>But a lengthy investigation by this newspaper reveals
evidence suggesting the effort to smear Mr. Safra was in fact
overseen from Mr. Freeman's office, only steps away from Mr.
Robinson's.</p>
<p>Mr. Freeman supervised and approved the hiring of the two
American Express operatives who carried out the Safra
campaign: One a private detective, the other a public
relations executive who frequently worked directly for Mr.
Robinson as an aide. For at least two years, the operatives
investigated Mr. Safra and then spread rumors and news
articles containing patently bogus information about him. The
articles linked Mr. Safra to drug trafficking, money
laundering and murder, and to criminal elements ranging from
Colombia's Medellin drug cartel to the late Mafia figure
Meyer Lansky. Mr. Freeman met often with one of the
operatives, and approved expense vouchers for the other.</p>
<p>For American Express, a company that has enjoyed a
virtually unrivaled reputation for integrity, the Safra
affair reveals a willingness to engage in unseemly corporate
revenge when confronting a rival, and, at the very least a
jarring lack of oversight on the part of top company
officials.</p>
<p>Despite regular contact with one of Mr. Freeman's
operatives, there is no concrete evidence that Mr. Robinson
knew of the smear campaign against Mr. Safra. Indeed, he and
other top American Express officials, including Mr. Freeman,
have vehemently denied any prior knowledge of the anti-Safra
effort. Instead, they argue that a legitimate investigation
of a competitor's activities was simply taken too far by
overzealous employees.</p>
<p>The Safra affair is a story of corporate intrigue played
out on three continents. Suspecting that American Express was
behind the outbreak of specious stories that began surfacing
in early 1988, Mr. Safra hired numerous detectives who
engaged the American Express operatives in a cloak-and-dagger
pas de deux that resulted in proof of the company's
culpability roughly a year later.</p>
<p>In response to repeated inquiries, American Express
yesterday issued a statement denying that any of its
employees knowingly spread false information. The company has
steadfastly declined to discuss details of the matter.
Instead, it turned to Arthur Liman, the noted New York
attorney, who in two phone calls over the past two months
said he would urge the company to sue this newspaper if it
published defamatory statements about the anti-Safra
campaign, suggesting that "this is a textbook case of what
libel is about." Mr. Liman emphasized that to comment further
would violate "the moral spirit" of the settlement with Mr.
Safra. In early August, Mr. Robinson telephoned Mr. Safra and
said he had "personally told my people," including Mr.
Freeman, not to talk to this newspaper.</p>
<p>Last week, an attorney representing Mr. Freeman, John
Walsh, wrote this newspaper to say that this article would be
"actionable" if it contained any statements implying that Mr.
Freeman had engaged in or covered up "any campaign of
disinformation" against Mr. Safra.</p>
<p>This article was pieced together from interviews with
dozens of people involved in the Safra affair, including
American and European journalists, private detectives and
more than 15 current and former American Express executives.
Among the few executives willing to comment on the record was
Robert F. Smith, former chairman of American Express Bank,
who left the company under a cloud last year.</p>
<p>From Rivalry to Obsession:</p>
<p>A Merger Gone Bad</p>
<p>The feud between American Express and Mr. Safra developed
soon after Mr. Robinson's decision in 1983 to buy for $550
million Mr. Safra's Geneva-based Trade Development Bank,
known as TDB, one of the crown jewels of the rarefied world
of Swiss banking. Mr. Safra, born in Beirut and descended
from a long line of Syrian traders and bankers, had founded
TDB's predecessor bank in 1956, after having founded his
first bank in Brazil. In the 1960s Mr. Safra started a U.S.
bank, Republic National Bank of New York, and the firms' rise
made him one of the world's most influential bankers.</p>
<p>The union of American Express's international banking arm,
American Express Bank, and TDB was doomed from the beginning,
largely because of Mr. Safra's inability to function within
the rigid framework of a multinational conglomerate.
Associates say Mr. Safra might have stepped out of an
18th-century portrait, a formal, secretive billionaire whose
Swiss bank offered unmatched personal service to its wealthy
Middle Eastern and Latin American clients. Befitting his
image, Mr. Safra lives in a castle-like villa, La Leopolda,
the King of Belgium's former estate on the French Riviera.</p>
<p>In image and experience, Mr. Safra's new boss, Jim
Robinson, could hardly have been more different. Mr.
Robinson, a Harvard MBA and the son of a legendary Atlanta
banker has in his 13-year reign generated generally strong
financial results and reaped publicity so relentlessly
favorable that, until this year's near-collapse of the
company's Shearson Lehman Hutton unit, he was sometimes known
as "The Teflon Executive." The formal, unfailingly polite Mr.
Robinson speaks again and again of the importance of quality
and integrity.</p>
<p>Mr. Robinson's image has had a paradoxical quality that
has become more pronounced in recent years. Although he is
portrayed as a hands on manager who pores relentlessly over
briefing papers and knows the names of low-level employees at
company field offices, he is also depicted as an executive
who gives subordinates a great deal of leeway, a fact that
has often forced -- or enabled -- him to plead ignorance when
plans go awry.</p>
<p>Mr. Robinson's efforts to bring Mr. Safra and TDB into the
21st century failed miserably. Mr. Safra abhorred memos;
American Express demanded them. Mr. Safra emphasized
longstanding relationships; American Express wanted more
loans and higher margins. Mr. Safra deplored publicity;
American Express thrived on it. American Express executives
thought Mr. Safra high-handed and imperial; Mr. Safra felt
excluded from Mr. Robinson's inner circle.</p>
<p>After less than two years, the two men parted ways. In
December 1984 Mr. Safra resigned as chairman of the
TDB-American Express Bank combination, but agreed not to
found a new Swiss bank until March 1988. Mr. Robinson,
anxious to make the split appear amicable, gave him the means
to do so, selling Mr. Safra some minor operations in Paris
and London and, more importantly, TDB's Geneva headquarters,
the symbol of Mr. Safra's Swiss power.</p>
<p>Simmering resentment burst into open hostility during Mr.
Safra's severance negotiations, when the two sides couldn't
agree on a price for the Geneva headquarters. Matters grew
worse in the months following Mr. Safra's departure, when
officials at American Express Bank suspected that Mr. Safra
was hiring away employees with an eye to his 1988 re-entry
into Swiss banking. Incensed, Bob Smith, the banker who
succeeded Mr. Safra as chairman, launched a full-scale
investigation, even hiring detectives to follow the employees
in question. "I told Jim {Robinson} what we were doing," Mr.
Smith says today. "I told him it was necessary to keep it
secret."</p>
<p>Fear of Mr. Safra mounted as Mr. Smith constantly warned
Mr. Robinson of the threat posed by Mr. Safra's looming
return to Swiss banking. Inside American Express, the feeling
spread that any effort by Mr. Safra to reclaim his former
customers could be a death blow to the weakened bank.</p>
<p>Their worries were fanned by Mr. Smith's inability to
trust his own executives, many of whom had worked for Mr.
Safra, and by the bank's status as a poor-performing orphan
within the American Express empire. Headquarters had tried to
sell the bank in 1981; Mr. Smith and his aides also explored
a leveraged-buy-out.</p>
<p>Mr. Smith, by his own admission, had become obsessed with
stopping Mr. Safra. His aides began looking for anything that
might harm Mr. Safra, investigating whether the banker might
be using his corporate jet for personal trips -- although
there is no evidence he did so -- and probing his U.S. tax
situation for weaknesses -- although the IRS has never
brought an action against Mr. Safra. "I said, `If the son of
a bitch competes with us, we'll turn him in to the IRS,'" Mr.
Smith recalls. When Mr. Safra learned of these efforts, he
protested to Mr. Robinson on a number of occasions between
1985 and 1987. With regard to such protests, Mr. Smith
recalls telling aides, "Screw {Safra}, we've done nothing
wrong."</p>
<p>Mr. Smith's anger spread to other American Express
executives. In early 1987 American Express finally took legal
action, filing a criminal complaint against Mr. Safra in
Geneva for unfair competition, mentioning the stolen
employees -- the banker's companies had hired as many as 23
American Express Bank employees -- and a key computer tape
that turned up missing. When Mr. Safra applied for his
banking license that May, American Express lawyers filed
papers to block it.</p>
<p>Months ticked away. Then, in January 1988 Swiss
authorities approved the licensing of Mr. Safra's new bank,
rejecting the American Express brief out of hand. The fight
should have ended there, and to outward appearances it had:
American Express declined to appeal, allowed its criminal
complaint to lapse, and Mr. Robinson called and graciously
congratulated Mr. Safra. In fact, it was only the beginning.</p>
<p>A Matter of Honor:</p>
<p>The Hunter Is Hunted</p>
<p>The summer of 1988 began joyously for Edmond Safra. In
March, he opened his new bank at the site of his old one, 2
Place du Lac in Geneva, the city's pre-eminent banking
address. In August, he invited thousands of guests, including
Prince Rainier and Princess Caroline of Monaco, to his
birthday party at La Leopolda.</p>
<p>The celebratory mood ended two weeks later, when Mr. Safra
was shown a curious article in La Depeche du Midi, a French
newspaper based in Toulouse. A jumble of fact and fiction,
the story linked Mr. Safra to the Mafia, South American drug
traffickers, the CIA and the Iran-Contra scandal. To Mr.
Safra's surprise, it also referred to similar stories in
Peruvian and Mexican publications, and to a previous article
in La Depeche that March linking Mr. Safra to drug
money-laundering.</p>
<p>Mr. Safra's alarm grew when the other articles crossed his
desk. A Lima-based newspaper named Hoy had run a full-page
article July 4 profiling Mr. Safra and his banks as the pawns
of drug traffickers and tying him again to New York
gangsters, the CIA and the Iran-Contra affair. "Mafioso
bankers turn their eyes to the south," the headline read.
Five days later, a left-wing Mexico City paper named Uno Mas
Uno had reprinted much of the Hoy story.</p>
<p>The articles posed a potentially devastating attack on Mr.
Safra's reputation for honesty and discretion. But they also
thrust at the dark underside of Swiss banking -- the fact
that its vaunted secrecy laws attract money from criminal
enterprises of all stripes to its institutions, including,
from time to time, Mr. Safra's. Too many people, his aides
could see, might believe the stories.</p>
<p>As Mr. Safra's aides studied what to do, a bombshell hit.
In Paris, an extreme right-wing, anti-Semitic newspaper named
Minute published on Aug. 31, 1988, an article charging that
Mr. Safra was actively involved with cocaine traffickers and
the Mafia. "Billionaire of the White Stuff," the headline
read.</p>
<p>Horrified, Mr. Safra summoned his top aides to La Leopolda
to discuss what to do. The articles had a number of common
elements, and the assembled executives agreed on one thing:
If the articles represented an organized campaign, only
American Express had the world-wide resources -- and the
motive -- to carry it off. "But you know," Walter Weiner,
Republic Bank's chairman, said at one point, "we'll never be
able to prove that."</p>
<p>In the meantime, Mr. Safra sued Minute, but only after the
paper published four more lurid articles that fall, alleging
Mr. Safra's ties to Manuel Noriega, the Medellin cartel and
Meyer Lansky. Then, when proceedings in the libel suits began
later that fall, one of Mr. Safra's French lawyers made a
startling discovery. Near the top of a 1967 Life magazine
article on the Mafia, which never mentioned Mr. Safra but
which Minute had produced to defend information in one of its
articles, a fax "telltale" could clearly be seen: "FEB 25 '88
21:26 AMEX CORP COMM NYC." The article had been transmitted
by a fax machine at American Express's New York corporate
communications department.</p>
<p>The Safra camp's jubilance over the discovery was tempered
when they realized that the "telltale" was far from
conclusive. Among the few other pieces of evidence they had
was a name: Tony Greco. It had come thirdhand, from the
boyfriend of a Minute clerk. When Mr. Weiner, Republic Bank's
chief, hired a detective to look into Mr. Greco, he found
nothing.</p>
<p>Then, in February 1989, as the Safra forces pondered their
next move, they got a break. The Miami office of Republic
Bank of New York received a call from a Peruvian named Victor
Tirado, who claimed to have information about an organized
smear campaign against Mr. Safra. The call was forwarded to
Republic's general counsel, Ernest Ginsberg, who then called
Mr. Weiner and exulted: "I just got a call and I can't
believe my ears]"</p>
<p>A Safra detective traveled to Washington to meet Mr.
Tirado, who, to the Safra team's surprise, turned out to be
deputy press attache at the Peruvian embassy and a former
press secretary to the then-president of Peru, Alan Garcia.
The rotund Mr. Tirado told the detective that a friend named
Antonio Greco was behind stories about Mr. Safra in Peru, and
probably in Europe as well.</p>
<p>Mr. Tirado's second contention was even more provocative:
"Greco claims he's working directly with Jim Robinson." While
that assertion was never proven, it gave the Safra forces
added incentive to probe Mr. Greco's activities.</p>
<p>Mr. Tirado offered little more, but said he would if paid
a $10,000 "honorarium." After considerable soul-searching,
Mr. Safra, worried about the propriety of paying a foreign
diplomat, decided against making the payment.</p>
<p>It was the last time the Safra executives heard from Mr.
Tirado, but his call persuaded them to bring in expert help.
An even greater impetus was the continued spread of
anti-Safra articles, which began appearing in U.S.
publications that spring of 1989. Mr. Safra hired Stanley
Arkin, a pugnacious New York attorney known for defending
figures in Wall Street's insider-trading scandals, and
charged him with stopping the articles.</p>
<p>Before he could stop the articles, Mr. Arkin saw, he had
to know what was behind them. For investigative work Mr.
Arkin turned to Palladino & Sutherland, a small but respected
San Francisco detective agency known for work on behalf of
fallen auto executive John Z. DeLorean. The firm is run by a
husband-and-wife team, Jack Palladino, an attorney and former
Ford Fellow, and Sandra Sutherland, who is also a published
poet.</p>
<p>Mr. Arkin's charge was simple: Find out whether the
anti-Safra articles represent an organized campaign. If so,
was American Express behind it? And who was the mysterious
Mr. Greco?</p>
<p>Aware that reporters don't typically turn over
confidential sources to strangers, much less private
detectives, Ms. Sutherland journeyed to Europe that spring
under disguise. In visits to publications in France, Italy
and Switzerland, she posed as an Australian free-lance writer
researching Mr. Safra for a book on money-laundering. At
Minute and La Depeche, journalists promised to put her in
touch with their Safra sources. At both stops, she was shown
the same strange, hand-drawn chart purporting to link Mr.
Safra to many criminal organizations. Clearly, Ms. Sutherland
reported to Mr. Arkin, the articles were coming from a single
source.</p>
<p>Ms. Sutherland had hoped her inquiries might flush out the
anti-Safra sources, and before long, she succeeded. Arriving
in Geneva in April 1989, Ms. Sutherland had just checked into
a hotel when her phone rang. A deep, ominous voice, speaking
in Italian, told her: "I'm a friend. You don't know who I am,
but we should talk." The talk went nowhere, but the American
detective had a strong hunch her bait had been taken.</p>
<p>At the same time, Ms. Sutherland became aware that
someone, perhaps the mysterious caller, was counterattacking,
spreading rumors that she was working for the CIA. Some Swiss
journalists canceled meetings with her as a result.</p>
<p>As Ms. Sutherland crisscrossed Europe, Mr. Safra's forces
pressed parallel investigations in Latin America and the U.S.
A Palladino detective was dispatched to Peru, where he posed
as a journalist in search of information on Mr. Greco. In
Peru, he found, Mr. Greco was known as an international
businessman with a large home in Spain, outside Barcelona.</p>
<p>Mr. Arkin, meanwhile, was tipped that the elusive Mr.
Greco had a second home on a secluded cul-de-sac in an
Italian area of New York's Staten Island. The lawyer brought
in a second detective agency, a Connecticut-based group of
former FBI agents. These detectives kept Mr. Greco's home
under surveillance and even went through his garbage. But Mr.
Greco seemed to be constantly traveling, and they made little
progress.</p>
<p>By May 1989, Mr. Arkin's luck was changing. In Paris, Ms.
Sutherland had begun negotiations with a Minute reporter to
meet the paper's source. One meeting fell through when the
source didn't show. When the source finally arrived in early
May, Ms. Sutherland was out of touch in Australia. In
desperation Mr. Arkin directed that Ms. Sutherland's Parisian
translator, an aging former starlet named Sophie Hardy, be
sent to the meeting.</p>
<p>Identifying himself as "Jaime," a journalist based in
Santiago, Chile, "the source" turned out to be a small,
swarthy man of 50 or so who, over dinner at an expensive
Chinese restaurant on the Champs Elysees, questioned Ms.
Hardy intently about Ms. Sutherland. "He was a very strange
person . . . acting like a spy," recalls Ms. Hardy. "He told
me I had been duped, that {Ms. Sutherland} was working with
the CIA." When Ms. Hardy was unable to reveal more about Ms.
Sutherland -- she didn't know her true identity -- "all of a
sudden he launched into this very brutal behavior" and
abruptly ended the dinner, Ms. Hardy recalls.</p>
<p>When Ms. Sutherland reached Paris several weeks later, she
showed Ms. Hardy pictures of several unidentified men,
including a surveillance photo of Mr. Greco. "Yes]" Ms. Hardy
exclaimed, pointing to Mr. Greco. "That's him]"</p>
<p>All that remained was linking Mr. Greco to American
Express, something Mr. Safra's lawyers were uncomfortably
aware they hadn't yet done. Frustrated, Mr. Arkin switched
surveillance teams on Mr. Greco's Staten Island home,
dropping the Connecticut detectives and hiring a third
agency. Within days the new team got a break. An operative
followed Mr. Greco's car to Bouley, a discreet, lower
Manhattan restaurant, where Mr. Greco was photographed dining
with an unidentified woman. Afterward the detective shadowed
Mr. Greco as he dropped off the woman at an apartment
building on Central Park West. On a hunch, Mr. Arkin put a
second tail on the woman. The next day detectives followed
her to work. As the surprised operatives looked on, the woman
disappeared inside American Express headquarters.</p>
<p>Harry Freeman Launches</p>
<p>His `Secret Weapon'</p>
<p>The woman's name was Susan Cantor, and she was a newly
minted senior vice president at American Express Bank,
specializing in wealthy Latin American clients. But as a
former associate producer of investigative projects for ABC
News, Ms. Cantor was no ordinary banker. More than a year
before Mr. Greco's activities attracted notice, her mix of
investigative and journalistic talents had made Ms. Cantor so
valuable that Harry Freeman referred to her as his "secret
weapon" in the fight against Edmond Safra.</p>
<p>Ms. Cantor joined ABC in the early 1980s after receiving a
masters degree in international relations from Yale in 1981.
Moving from posts in a documentary unit to World News Tonight
to the investigative unit, she became known as an avid
conspiracy theorist whose intelligence, ambition and Latin
American expertise seldom translated into solid stories.</p>
<p>One of her former ABC supervisors describes Ms. Cantor as
more adept at conspiratorial thinking than journalism. "She
was great on the latest conspiracy theory coming off the
Hill, the latest person running the secret war in Nicaragua,"
the supervisor says. "I would say, `Susan go nail it down.'
And she couldn't nail it down."</p>
<p>In a statement released yesterday, Ms. Cantor says she
resigned in 1986 to pursue other opportunities. Some ABC
co-workers say that decision came after her boss repeatedly
suggested she wasn't suited for network news. Her failure to
translate rumor and theory into usable Latin American stories
had alienated a number of correspondents.</p>
<p>In early 1987, at a time when American Express's fear of
Mr. Safra was approaching its height, Mr. Freeman interviewed
and hired Ms. Cantor for a job in American Express's public
relations department. Walter Montgomery, then the department
head, told co-workers Ms. Cantor's television experience
would be invaluable. But Ms. Cantor wasn't destined to do
much P.R. work. Almost immediately upon her hiring, Mr.
Freeman tapped her for a top-secret "special assignment."</p>
<p>When American Express Bank officials began raising the
alarm about Mr. Safra in the mid-1980s, they had found a
willing ear in Mr. Freeman. Trained as a lawyer, he had come
to American Express in 1975 after years of government work as
an executive for the Overseas Private Investment Corporation.
Of the four top aides who shared American Express's 51st
floor executive suite, Mr. Freeman was probably closest to
his boss. Though half his duties were supervising the
company's extensive government, advertising and corporate
relations apparatus, Mr. Freeman always said the other half
was "crisis of the day" work with Mr. Robinson.</p>
<p>Though his ideas could be innovative, as when dealing with
international trade, his penchant for unorthodox projects
worried American Express lawyers. In 1987, for example, Mr.
Freeman was blamed internally when American Express admitted
it had secretly funded a supposedly nonbiased newsletter's
survey of credit card interest rates that The Wall Street
Journal routinely referred to until it learned of American
Express' involvement. Mr. Freeman said at the time he saw
nothing wrong with funding the newsletter.</p>
<p>As bank executives in Europe probed charges that Mr. Safra
was hiring away employees, Mr. Freeman grew convinced that
Mr. Safra was intent on destroying American Express Bank. He
began collecting the darkest rumors about Mr. Safra, that he
was involved in money laundering, drug trafficking and had
ties to the CIA and French and Israeli intelligence.</p>
<p>Ms. Cantor's "special assignment" to investigate these
rumors initially centered on allegations reported by Swiss
papers and the New York Times in December 1986, that a plane
owned by Mr. Safra may have been used to transport former
national security advisor Robert MacFarlane to Iran as part
of talks in the Iran-Contra affair. Interviews with European
journalists, as well as current and former American Express
officials, suggest that in the coming months, Ms. Cantor's
mission evolved from gathering information on Mr. Safra's
plane, to helping reporters investigate him, to spreading
rumors and negative articles on the banker's alleged drug
ties.</p>
<p>Ms. Cantor said in her statement: "I never intended or
sought to disseminate false information concerning Edmond
Safra to anyone, and I never instructed, asked or engaged
anyone to spread such information."</p>
<p>From the beginning, she sought to hide her ties to
American Express. In February 1987 she traveled to Geneva,
where she met with at least two journalists, including Maya
Jurt, a veteran Swiss writer who had reported the story of
Mr. Safra's plane two months earlier. When Ms. Cantor dined
at Ms. Jurt's home on February 8, she didn't mention American
Express. "She said she was writing a big piece on Iran Contra
for Time magazine," recalls Ms. Jurt. "She wanted to know
what I had {on Mr. Safra}, what kind of proof I had. I showed
her all my documents."</p>
<p>By the time Ms. Cantor returned to New York, she had
gathered quite a bit of information. A former ABC producer
who kept in touch with her recalls, "She begins to blow in my
ear, `Hey, Safra this; hey Safra that; hey, MacFarlane and a
plane that.' I said, `Hey, if you can confirm any of this, I
might be interested.' But she couldn't."</p>
<p>Her file on Mr. Safra bulging with European news articles
and records from Geneva's corporate registry, Ms. Cantor next
traveled to Washington to share it with the House select
committee investigating the Iran-Contra affair. Joseph P.
Saba, a staff counsel probing Oliver North's various Swiss
transactions, met Ms. Cantor in a public room in the capitol
one day when she arrived unannounced, file in hand.</p>
<p>Ms. Cantor identified herself "as a former journalist
whose current employer knew nothing of what she was doing,"
Mr. Saba recalls. "She said she was doing it for primarily
journalistic reasons."</p>
<p>The lawyer, accustomed to zealots with similarly vague
explanations, took Ms. Cantor's file and promised to
investigate. In coming months, as Mr. Saba followed lead
after dubious lead on Mr. Safra, Ms. Cantor phoned and
visited frequently. "It was always, `Here's what I've got,
what do you think?' And my answer was, `Not much,'" says Mr.
Saba.</p>
<p>At one point, Mr. Saba asked the committee's press liaison
to find out more about Ms. Cantor. When he learned that she
worked for American Express, "we said that was fine," Mr.
Saba recalls. "Motive wasn't something I was interested in."
When Mr. Saba confronted her, Ms. Cantor acknowledged working
for American Express. She told him stories about her snooping
trips to Europe, insisting her work was for personal reasons.</p>
<p>When not probing Mr. Safra, Ms. Cantor assumed a number of
duties at American Express that placed her in direct contact
with the chairman, Mr. Robinson. Former executives say Ms.
Cantor spent much of her New York time working for Mr.
Robinson on his much publicized plan to solve the Third World
debt crisis. Among her jobs was assembling briefing books for
Mr. Robinson and arranging Mr. Robinson's schedule for his
Latin American trips; in this role, she once quizzed a Wall
Street Journal international banking reporter on officials
for Mr. Robinson to visit in Mexico City. A former banker in
Shearson Lehman's debt group says she also took on heftier
duties, mediating, at Mr. Robinson's request, a dispute
between Shearson and American Express Bank over how to handle
the bank's Third World debt.</p>
<p>Much of her focus, however, continued to be on Mr. Safra.
In the months to come, Ms. Cantor punctuated her increasingly
frequent European travels with whirlwind stops by American
Express's London office, where her appetite for dirt on Mr.
Safra was matched only by her willingness to talk about it.
To other executives Ms. Cantor spoke excitedly of how she
changed her hair color and appearance on her travels and of
how she secretly photographed Mr. Safra's villa, La Leopolda.</p>
<p>In September 1987 Ms. Cantor returned to Geneva, where she
met with Irene Hirsch, a Swiss-based economic correspondent
for a Spanish paper. She told Ms. Hirsch she was working on a
"top secret story" on the Iran-Contra affair to appear in The
Washington Post. Ms. Hirsch, who knew Ms. Cantor actually
worked for American Express, was confused. "Why was somebody
working for American Express saying they were working for The
Washington Post?" she wondered. "I felt in some way she was
fishy."</p>
<p>Ms. Cantor's poses seemed to change from stop to stop.
While dining at Maya Jurt's Geneva home September 1, she told
the writer she was researching a book on Mr. Safra and the
Iran-Contra affair.</p>
<p>Ms. Cantor denies ever having posed as an author, or as a
reporter for Time or the Washington Post. She also denies
ever having disguised her appearance.</p>
<p>Ms. Jurt, who was working on a second article on Mr.
Safra, responded eagerly when Ms. Cantor, offering to help,
referred her to Mr. Saba, the Iran-Contra lawyer. Eager to
swap leads, Mr. Saba faxed Ms. Jurt copies of telexes
pertaining to the use of Mr. Safra's plane. Ms. Jurt used
this information in an article exploring the banker's
possible Iran-Contra connections in Bilanz, a Swiss magazine,
two months later. (By that time Mr. Saba had met with Mr.
Safra's attorneys and concluded that neither the banker nor
his plane had any significant role in the Iran-Contra
affair.)</p>
<p>When Ms. Cantor faxed the names of pilots believed to have
flown Mr. Safra's plane, Ms. Jurt was surprised to see an
American Express "telltale" on the fax. "I asked her point
blank, didn't she think it was very incompatible, what she
was doing," Ms. Jurt says. "She said, yes, it was very
difficult," explaining that she was working for American
Express part-time because she needed the money, Ms. Jurt
adds. "She was very smooth about the whole thing." Later Ms.
Cantor boasted of her Latin American travels with Mr.
Robinson, although she never said that Mr. Robinson knew of
her Safra activities.</p>
<p>For his part, Mr. Saba, who learned the full dimensions of
American Express's activities years later, says of his
dealings with Ms. Cantor, "I'm a little pissed that I got
used."</p>
<p>Irked as well, Ms. Jurt says she refused to follow up
when, in coming months, Ms. Cantor slipped her articles from
Peru, France and Mexico alleging Mr. Safra's ties to drug
traffickers. "That stuff she gave me, I just said, `I won't
touch it,'" Ms. Jurt says. "It was ridiculous. Just because a
paper reported something, that doesn't mean it's worth
printing."</p>
<p>Ms. Cantor frequently telephoned Mr. Freeman from Europe
in the presence of co-workers and journalists, and even told
one journalist, Ms. Hirsch, she was working for Mr. Freeman.
But some people sympathetic to Mr. Freeman insist he didn't
know details of her work and didn't supervise her closely.</p>
<p>Trafficking in Rumor:</p>
<p>The Evolution of a Smear</p>
<p>By early 1988, when Switzerland approved the licensing of
Mr. Safra's new bank, Mr. Freeman's concern about Mr. Safra
had deepened. To him, the Swiss move only showed how powerful
the banker was. By the time Mr. Smith and his aides began
scrambling to keep customers from defecting to Mr. Safra that
spring, Mr. Freeman had approved the hiring of a private
detective, Antonio "Tony" Greco. His activities would lead
American Express' campaign against Mr. Safra into a new, more
aggressive phase.</p>
<p>According to several former American Express executives,
Mr. Greco's employment was suggested by Paul Knight, a former
federal narcotics agent and chief of American Express
security for Europe and the Middle East. Mr. Greco was said
to be a discreet, professional investigator. He had done work
for American Express for more than a decade.</p>
<p>Police records in two countries, however, paint a
different picture of Mr. Greco. The detective has a record of
arrests and convictions in Italy and the United States going
back to 1962. He has also, several former law enforcement
professionals acknowledge, operated as a paid informant for a
number of government agencies. A Wall Street Journal request
to review his file at the Immigration & Naturalization
Service's New York office was denied because, in the words of
spokesman Charles Troy, "the file appears to be classified."</p>
<p>"Greco peddles information; he's fairly well known in the
law enforcement community," says Michael Hershman, a former
federal investigator and head of Fairfax Group, a private
security agency. "There's a thousand guys like him around;
he's not unusual. What is unusual is that a company like
American Express would use someone like that. That strikes me
as poor judgment."</p>
<p>Working with government agencies and American Express,
however, hasn't kept Mr. Greco out of trouble. According to a
computer printout that appears to be Mr. Greco's complete
Italian criminal record, he was convicted in 1982 of
conspiracy and handling stolen goods by a court in Genoa,
Italy, and sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison.
Earlier, in 1980, the document indicates, a court in Rome had
convicted Mr. Greco of theft and sentenced him to a year in
prison. According to the document, both sentences were
commuted as part of a general amnesty. In the U.S., Mr. Greco
was arrested at least five times between 1968 and 1972 for a
variety of offenses ranging from smuggling to carrying an
unlicensed pistol; each of the charges was subsequently
dropped. Mr. Greco couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether Mr. Freeman or Ms. Cantor knew of
Mr. Greco's criminal record. For Mr. Freeman, hiring a
detective wasn't unusual: American Express retains an
estimated 200 or more investigators, many of them former New
York City policemen and FBI agents, to combat credit card and
travelers check fraud.</p>
<p>Some at American Express say Mr. Freeman believed that Mr.
Greco was only gathering, not spreading, information on Mr.
Safra, and Mr. Freeman has told friends he has never even
seen the detective. There is evidence that suggests Mr. Greco
reported to Ms. Cantor, who reported to Mr. Freeman.</p>
<p>Still, when Mr. Greco began traveling on his new
assignment, it was Mr. Freeman who approved his expenses.
According to a person who saw Mr. Greco's contract in 1988,
the detective was paid $15,000 a month, plus $500 a day in
expenses.</p>
<p>Full details of Mr. Greco's travels for American Express
are presumably still in the company's files. But he can be
linked to at least three of the most widely distributed
articles charging Mr. Safra with criminal activities. At La
Depeche, the French paper that alleged Mr. Safra's drug links
in March and August 1988, reporter Jacques Bertrand
acknowledges knowing Mr. Greco, at one point calling him his
"ami," or his friend, but wouldn't elaborate.</p>
<p>According to a person who has known Mr. Greco for 25
years, in early 1988 Mr. Greco looked up his old friend
Victor Tirado in Lima, Peru, and told him he was interested
in placing a story in the newspaper Hoy, where Mr. Tirado had
once worked as a columnist. Mr. Tirado, this person says,
gave Mr. Greco a contact at Hoy, then thought little about
the matter until seeing the paper's article on Mr. Safra's
drug ties and remembering Mr. Greco's own comments about the
banker.</p>
<p>The selection of Hoy may not have been accidental. The
Peruvian newspaper, like the French newspaper Minute, has
carried anti-Semitic articles, according to Morton Rosenthal,
a Latin American expert for the Anti-Defamation League of
B'Nai B'Rith. Mr. Rosenthal, who looked into the Safra affair
at Mr. Safra's request, says the Peruvian article was
reprinted in the Mexico City newspaper, Uno Mas Uno, after
being transmitted by a Lima representative of Prensa Latina,
the official news agency of Cuba.</p>
<p>The most detailed version of Mr. Greco's activities comes
from former journalists at Minute, the Parisian newspaper
that printed articles linking Mr. Safra to criminal elements
ranging from the Mafia to the Medellin Cartel. Jean Roberto,
the senior reporter who wrote the articles, says in an
interview that Mr. Greco first contacted Minute in August
1988, identifying himself as a detective probing
money-laundering activities and hinting that he worked for
the CIA or the FBI. Mr. Greco promised to supply information
on a prominent banker -- who turned out to be Mr. Safra --
who was laundering money for, among others, former Panamanian
dictator Manuel Noriega.</p>
<p>In coming months, Mr. Roberto says, he met regularly with
Mr. Greco, often at his hotel, The Intercontinental. Each
time Mr. Greco offered more sensational tales about Mr.
Safra, complete with graphs charting his criminal contacts,
and documents, including an Interpol inquiry on Mr. Safra's
Iran-Contra links. Mr. Roberto printed the document alongside
his first article on Mr. Safra, "Billionaire of the White
Stuff."</p>
<p>When Mr. Greco claimed that Mr. Safra was living in fear
of Colombian drug traffickers he had double-crossed, Mr.
Roberto wrote in a second article that Mr. Safra was hiding
out in his Riviera estate, "perspiring in fear" of the drug
cartel's assassins. Mr. Greco also passed on clippings from
Hoy and other newspapers as well as photos of La Leopolda,
all of which Minute used in its increasingly lurid articles.</p>
<p>Whether by accident or design, the seed Mr. Greco planted
spread to other publications, as Mr. Roberto shared his
information and documents with other European journalists.
Mr. Roberto, for instance, recalls "spending an afternoon"
with Jean-Claude Buffle, a Swiss journalist who has since
written extensively on Mr. Safra's supposed drug ties in a
magazine named L'Hebdo. Mr. Buffle's stories, in turn, were
followed by other Swiss reporters, who produced a spate of
articles linking Mr. Safra to drug money in 1989. Mr. Safra
has gained retractions from some publications; others, like
L'Hebdo, he has sued.</p>
<p>"Mr. Greco had a lot of information about Mr. Safra, and
that's why I had confidence in him," says Mr. Roberto, who
has left Minute. Adds Jean-Claude Goudeau, Mr. Roberto's
editor at the time: "Greco seemed solid." Asked why Mr. Greco
would choose to pass information to Minute, which is known
for anti-Semitism, Mr. Roberto says simply: "Because Mr.
Safra is a Jew."</p>
<p>What Was Susan Cantor</p>
<p>Up To, Anyway?</p>
<p>As anti-Safra articles began appearing in international
publications, the Safra effort encountered some internal
opposition. In mid-summer 1988, James McGrath, then American
Express' world-wide security chief, telephoned Mr. Ricciardi,
the associate general counsel whose duties included
overseeing the company's security force. Mr. McGrath was
curious why Ms. Cantor had called and, invoking Mr.
Robinson's name, told the London security chief, Mr. Knight,
to return to New York "for a very important meeting."</p>
<p>After Mr. McGrath related the call, a puzzled Mr.
Ricciardi phoned Ms. Cantor. According to a person familiar
with the conversation, their exchange went like this: "Who
are you investigating?" Mr. Ricciardi asked.</p>
<p>"I'm not sure I can say," Ms. Cantor replied. But when Mr.
Ricciardi pressed, Ms. Cantor said it was Mr. Safra.</p>
<p>"This is very important," she explained. "I work for Harry
Freeman. This is for Jim Robinson. This is his show."</p>
<p>Mr. Ricciardi seemed wary when Mr. Freeman's name was
mentioned. "You tell Jim Robinson to call me if he wants to
use Paul Knight," he told Ms. Cantor. There's no indication
Mr. Robinson ever did so. It was at that point, however, that
a worried Mr. Ricciardi, with Mr. McGrath in tow, went to Mr.
Freeman's office and warned him to stop whatever he was
doing.</p>
<p>In coming months Mr. Ricciardi repeated his concerns to
Mr. Beller, and to his superior, Aldo Papone, head of the
travel-related services unit, American Express' largest, and
a member of the company's board. But those concerns weren't
expressed to Mr. Robinson, the man in a position to stop the
operation.</p>
<p>Despite intense secrecy, hints of the Safra project wafted
through American Express. "We heard there was investigative
work going on," says a former executive in travel-related
services, "but the word coming down from corporate was,
`Don't get your noses in it.'"</p>
<p>One person who grew curious was Bob Smith at American
Express Bank, who became Ms. Cantor's new boss when she
transferred from public relations into a bank position with
loosely defined duties in mid-1988. Mr. Smith says he hired
Ms. Cantor after a phone call from Mr. Robinson, who
suggested she might be useful in courting Latin American
clients.</p>
<p>Different people give different reasons for Ms. Cantor's
transfer. Two people familiar with the move say Ms. Cantor
was shifted after pressure from the general counsel, Mr.
Beller, who purportedly wanted to distance her anti-Safra
work from Mr. Robinson and other executives; Ms. Cantor told
at least one bank executive this. Other people familiar with
Ms. Cantor's work said they knew of no such pressure. Ms.
Cantor, these people say, simply wanted a "line position"
that would give her greater responsibility. "She told me Jim
Robinson told her to get a line job, that it would be good
for her career," recalls a former Shearson executive.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, in her new position Ms. Cantor
continued reporting to Mr. Freeman, spending much of her time
on the Safra project. Mr. Smith knew Ms. Cantor was
investigating Mr. Safra, but says he was told her findings
were to be passed on to Swiss and other European bank
regulators, not newspapers. Ms. Cantor was handling payments
to Mr. Greco, and at her request, Mr. Smith took over the
task of approving them, sometimes in increments of $30,000 or
more.</p>
<p>"I did it because Harry Freeman had approved what she was
doing," Mr. Smith says today. "{Cantor} was working for
Freeman, a corporate vice president, who worked directly for
Robinson. I had no need to protect my ass."</p>
<p>Mr. Smith was the only bank executive with an inkling of
Ms. Cantor's actual duties, and below him, rumors about her
swirled. Ignorant of banking procedures, Ms. Cantor embarked
on a training regimen that was frequently interrupted by
unexplained overseas trips. Soon other executives, hearing of
her journalistic background and Latin American expertise,
began whispering that Ms. Cantor was secretly working on an
unauthorized book about American Express, or with the
Nicaraguan Contras.</p>
<p>Even Mr. Smith had doubts. "To tell you the truth, I
always thought she worked for the CIA," he says. Mr. Smith
adds: "She was always with Freeman. She had lunches with
Freeman. She was always off with him . . . or on some
Robinson project."</p>
<p>In addition, Ms. Cantor helped the bank, making
introductions in Mexico and Venezuela. At a Mexico City
dinner celebrating the election of President Carlos Salinas
de Gortari in 1988, "she knew everyone at the table," Mr.
Smith says, including a dozen senior Mexican officials. "I
never went to a cocktail party with someone who knew so many
people."</p>
<p>The bank wasn't the only one Ms. Cantor helped. At one
point, according to a former Shearson executive, she urged
Shearson to hire Mr. Greco in an effort to secure the
Peruvian government as a client. After wrangling for weeks
over a fee -- Mr. Greco insisted on being paid by the hour --
the detective arranged a meeting in New York between Shearson
executives and a group of Peruvian officials, including the
finance minister. Though Shearson never got the business, at
Ms. Cantor's insistence Mr. Greco received about $15,000,
says the former Shearson executive.</p>
<p>As Ms. Cantor settled in, Mr. Smith and his deputies
watched the surge of negative articles about Mr. Safra. Soon
customers were asking who was behind them. Mr. Smith was
fairly sure he knew.</p>
<p>Worried that any wrongdoing might be blamed on the bank,
Mr. Smith says he confronted Mr. Freeman about the Safra
articles and Ms. Cantor's "special assignment" in the fall of
1988. "I said, `What the hell is going on? Are you doing
anything?'" Mr. Smith recalls. "He just kind of looked at me
and smiled. I said, `Look, if you are involved in this,
you're out of your mind.'"</p>
<p>He continues: "I told Harry, I told Susan, I had no desire
to know what they were doing. I didn't want to know. I wanted
nothing to do with it." He says Mr. Freeman, while denying
that he was spreading anti-Safra articles, told him: "`Well,
Susan is so busy with her banking now, it's just about
over.'"</p>
<p>After talking with Mr. Freeman, Mr. Smith says he began
keeping a close eye on Ms. Cantor. "At that point in time, I
said, `Let's make sure this gal is real busy,'" he says. "We
started to really crank up the workload on her. We said,
`Okay, you can't just fly off {someplace} if you feel like
it. You've got to tell us why you're going.' From that point
in time, she was pretty much under control."</p>
<p>Ms. Cantor was submerged in a crash course on banking and,
by the fall of 1988, when Mr. Smith, Mr. Robinson and Ms.
Cantor flew to Venezuela on an American Express jet, Mr.
Smith was fairly certain her "special assignment" was over.</p>
<p>Final Confrontation: Safra</p>
<p>Plays His Trump Card</p>
<p>By the spring of 1989 anti-Safra articles were appearing
in U.S. publications for the first time. Mr. Safra was so
desperate to end the articles that he began weighing criminal
charges against American Express. In an effort to avoid such
a high-profile maneuver, the banker flew to New York to
confront Mr. Robinson with his growing suspicions.</p>
<p>"We know it's your people, Jim," he told Mr. Robinson in a
mid-March meeting at Mr. Safra's Manhattan apartment. Mr.
Robinson said he would be "dumbfounded" if it were true, but
promised to look into the matter. Ten days later Mr. Robinson
told Mr. Safra he had checked and found no evidence of a
smear campaign. American Express' explanation, spoken
privately, has been that Mr. Freeman, ignorant of the extent
of what Mr. Greco and Ms. Cantor were doing, told Mr.
Robinson this.</p>
<p>Then in May Mr. Safra's lawyer, Mr. Arkin, suggested a
more subtle threat. After a thorough review by Mr. Safra's
aides, the lawyer published, in his regular column for the
New York Law Journal that June, the hypothetical story of a
corporate executive who "cherishes his Boy Scout image," but
whose aides had spread rumors that a competitor was involved
in the drug business. "Spreading false of malicious rumor or
flat-out lies . . . may well amount to a criminal fraud," Mr.
Arkin mused in the column.</p>
<p>According to a top American Express executive, neither Mr.
Robinson nor his aides initially saw the intended shot across
their bow. The fact that Mr. Safra was mulling criminal
charges came to American Express's attention via a circuitous
route: Then Shearson Chairman Peter A. Cohen learned of it
from a top private detective, Jules Kroll, who had heard it
from a friend of Mr. Arkin.</p>
<p>Days later, Mr. Safra was in his Geneva office when a
secretary told him Mr. Robinson was on the phone. "Jim
Robinson?" he asked in amazement. According to a person
familiar with their conversation, an angry Mr. Robinson
didn't mention Mr. Arkin's column, but told Mr. Safra: "I
know you've been following my people, and I want a stop put
to it."</p>
<p>When Mr. Robinson finished, Mr. Safra replied simply:
"I've got you, Jim. We've got mountains of evidence. Don't
tell me about following your people. We've got you."</p>
<p>A Deal and an Apology,</p>
<p>But Is It Over?</p>
<p>By the end of June American Express lawyers began
negotiating a settlement with Mr. Arkin. To their inquiries
of how much the Safra forces knew, Mr. Arkin's mention of a
single name, "Tony Greco," seemed enough. American Express
agreed to pay $8 million, half to Mr. Safra, half to four
charities, to avoid a lawsuit or criminal charges.</p>
<p>American Express's subsequent internal investigation sent
a number of executives diving for cover. The general counsel,
Mr. Beller, brought in representatives from three outside law
firms, including a former U.S. Attorney, John Martin, Jr., to
handle the questioning.</p>
<p>According to a senior company official, Mr. Martin
encountered unswerving denials from a number of key
executives thought to have knowledge of the Safra project. In
London, Paul Knight, the American Express corporate security
official, walked into a colleague's office and announced that
his Safra file had mysteriously disappeared, a statement the
colleague took as a signal that his file should disappear as
well. Mr. Martin might have learned more had he interviewed
journalists like Mr. Roberto and Ms. Jurt, but they weren't
contacted.</p>
<p>At American Express Bank, Ms. Cantor found herself an
outcast. "Susan became a member of the lepers colony," says a
former bank executive. "People didn't want to be seen with
her. You didn't go into her office for fear you'd get a call
from Gary Beller." In June, when Maya Jurt, the Swiss writer,
last saw Ms. Cantor, she was pregnant, concerned about her
baby's health, and "she looked 10 years older," Ms. Jurt
says.</p>
<p>Within a week of Mr. Robinson's public apology, Mr.
Freeman announced his retirement. Mr. Freeman's fall was
cushioned by consulting contracts with an estimated total
value of more than $100,000 a year. Privately, Mr. Freeman
maintained that Mr. Robinson had tried to get him to stay on.
He also said that Mr. Robinson pledged to make him whole
financially if he did choose to leave. Afterward Mr. Freeman
continued many of the same duties he had at American Express,
including oversight of a lavish company-sponsored celebration
of Dwight Eisenhower's centennial. Today, he is one of the
most respected experts on the multilateral trade talks in
Geneva.</p>
<p>The results of American Express's internal investigation
were submitted to the audit committee of the company's board.
That panel concluded, "while the people involved -- all of
whom said they did not intend to disseminate inaccurate
information -- were motivated by what they considered to be
the company's best interests, their actions set off a chain
of events that resulted in the maligning of a competitor."
People familiar with the situation say the company has since
tightened its internal controls and disciplined Ms. Cantor by
withholding her 1989 bonus.</p>
<p>Ms. Cantor took a maternity leave, but if she thought she
could leave the murky world of corporate espionage behind,
she was wrong. As Edmond Safra sorted through the damage to
his image, his operatives delved deeply into Ms. Cantor's
life and reported back on all they found. Susan Cantor
ultimately had her baby, and Mr. Safra's detectives know
where, when and how it was delivered.</p>
<p>Though Mr. Safra won a clear victory, he was far from
satisfied. American Express refused to accede to a key
request: Identifying publications where its operatives spread
misinformation. To do so, American Express felt, might be
tantamount to taking responsibility for rumors it didn't
disseminate. Without that knowledge, Mr. Safra has been
unable to try to counter negative articles until they appear.
Today he is regularly forced to rebut charges of
money-laundering and other nefarious activities. This spring
Safra lawyers scrambled to counter old charges in a
Guatemalan newspaper, a French newswire report and a Swiss
author's book. Mr. Safra is said to be resigned to the fact
that such allegations may dog him to his grave.</p>
