	<p class="article-leader">Search the caves of Postojna, Yugoslavia, for the
mysterious "Brilliant." Scour Malacca, Malaysia, for Wah Aik,
the last remaining artisan of Chinese bound-foot shoes. Find
Juliet's balcony in Verona, Italy.
   Welcome to the Humanrace, competitive division -- an
international scavanger hunt that promises challenge, exotic
locales and glamour.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Spurred on by a world-wide, elbows-out, $5,300-entry-fee
race among 30 adventurers last year, backers of the event are
thinking up ways to expand. There's talk of local scavenger
hunts, with contestants battling it out on the freeways of
Los Angeles or the subways of New York, ending in a race for
the national and international title.</p>
<p>Jonathan Bassan, a Montecito, Calif., traveler, one-time
importer, and real-estate developer, organized the event last
year to "take businessmen and professionals otherwise
primarily stuck in offices all day and open them up in new
ways. How you get there is the most significant thing."</p>
<p>But will it be any fun? Judging by last year's results,
and with a $20,000 first prize at stake, not necessarily.</p>
<p>Instead of an enjoyable romp on, say, the Orient Express,
last year's teams zoomed through cities in pursuit of brass
ear-cleaning spoons (Singapore) and receipts from Cafe della
Grazie (Italy).</p>
<p>"It was a nightmare," laments Kay Finegan, who at 78 was
the oldest Humanracer. In Jakarta, Indonesia, Ms. Finegan
raced up a temple's 354 stairs in 104-degree heat to take a
photo from its top.</p>
<p>Another racer endured a 12-hour ride to Luxor on a packed
Egyptian bus complete with live chickens and recorded Islamic
prayers.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Humanrace's top finishers found the
competition thrilling. "It was a great challenge," says Andy
Valvur, a 36-year-old stand-up comic and writer who ran up
the stairs to the crown of the Statue of Liberty and back in
seven minutes. But his team had a few problems. "Right after
the race my girlfriend said I looked 10 years older," he
concedes. "We probably didn't expect not to sleep; we didn't
expect not to eat."</p>
<p>The quick pace leaves little time for sightseeing. "We did
Paris in 3 1/2 hours. We were in the Louvre for eight
minutes. We did the Champs Elysees, Arc de Triomphe, Eiffel
Tower, Notre Dame, Ile Saint-Louis and bingo] We were out of
there," says Mr. Valvur.</p>
