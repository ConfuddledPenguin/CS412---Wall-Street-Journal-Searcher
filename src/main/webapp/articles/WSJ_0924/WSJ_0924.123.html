	<p class="article-leader">BURLINGTON, Vt. -- You don't have to be J. Edgar Hoover to
spot the subversive at the breakfast meeting of the South
Burlington Rotary Club. He's the one who isn't wearing a tie.
Bernard Sanders -- former socialist mayor of Burlington,
current independent candidate for Congress, and the morning
speaker at the local EconoLodge -- has entered the belly of
the capitalist beast.
   Polite but restrained applause greets the silver-haired
radical when he ascends the podium. In the working-class
accent of his native Brooklyn, Mr. Sanders praises Sweden,
denounces South Africa, and calls for a publicly financed
national health-care system and a five-year, 50% reduction in
defense spending.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Such rhetoric hardly seems calculated to woo the merchant
class. But by the time the meeting ends, at least one
plutocrat is won over. "I think I'm going to vote for
Sanders," says retired life-insurance executive Harold
Engelman, explaining that "a message needs to be sent" to
Washington.</p>
<p>Socialism may be on the wane in Eastern Europe, but in
Vermont democratic socialist Bernie Sanders' red star has
never shone brighter. This is the seventh time Mr. Sanders
has sought statewide office; six times he failed. But he made
a strong showing in his 1988 congressional race (Vermont is
one big congressional district) against former Lt. Gov. Peter
Smith -- 38% to Republican Smith's victorious 41% -- while
the Democrat, a prominent state legislator, trailed far
behind.</p>
<p>This year, Mr. Sanders and freshman Rep. Smith meet in a
rematch. "I think the race is very close," says Garrison
Nelson, a political-science professor at the University of
Vermont, noting that the most recent independent poll,
published in July by the Burlington Free Press, placed the
two candidates in a dead heat. If elected, Mr. Sanders would
be the first socialist elected to Congress since the 1950
defeat of Rep. Vito Marcantonio of New York, who ran on the
American Labor Party ticket.</p>
<p>The contest has left the state's historically weak
Democratic party in serious disarray. Although its support is
technically behind Dolores Sandoval, a little-known black
education professor at the University of Vermont who earlier
this month won a narrow primary victory, in reality the party
has virtually abandoned the field. Prominent Democratic
officeholders like Sen. Patrick Leahy and departing Gov.
Madeleine Kunin are remaining emphatically neutral, while
other state officials divide their support between Rep. Smith
and Mr. Sanders. Even the party's executive director, Craig
Fuller, declines to state personal support for the Democratic
candidate, while the national party is "sitting on the
sidelines," according to Howard Schloss, spokesman for the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in Washington.</p>
<p>Rep. Smith, with his preppy demeanor, liberal politics,
and high Washington profile on issues ranging from the
savings-and-loan crisis to the civil-rights bill, has strong
appeal among moderate Republicans and the state's burgeoning
yuppie ranks. But with a sigh, the 44-year-old congressman
describes the race as "the most intense political exercise
that I've been involved in in my life."</p>
<p>The man responsible for this turmoil is a self-proclaimed
socialist who hung the Soviet flag in the Burlington mayor's
office (in honor of its sister city, Yuroslavl) and
celebrated the sixth anniversary of Nicaragua's Sandinista
victory with Daniel Ortega in Managua. Mr. Sanders, 49, still
praises the Sandinistas for "fighting for women's rights" and
"economic justice," but emphasizes that his brand of
democratic socialism bears little relation to the
Marxist-Leninist model. For Mr. Sanders, socialism means "the
powers and abilities of government should be used anywhere
and everywhere" -- he pauses for emphasis -- "where it makes
sense."</p>
<p>In practice, Mr. Sanders' socialism until now has meant
little more than keeping the streets and parks of
picture-post-card Burlington well tended. As mayor from 1981
to 1989, Mr. Sanders switched the city's revenue burden away
from property taxes -- which he viewed as an undue hardship
on the middle class and elderly -- and made up the difference
in room and meal taxes exacted from tourists and higher taxes
levied on utility companies. He attempted to institute a city
income tax, but was foiled by the state government in
Montpelier. He also mimicked penny-pinching Yankee
capitalists by reinvesting the city's pension funds and
subjecting its insurance contracts to competitive bidding.
Indeed, a 1985 poll showed that one-third of Ronald Reagan's
Burlington supporters also supported Bernie Sanders.</p>
<p>"Bernie is definitely in favor of business," says Ben
Cohen, chairman of the ice-cream maker Ben & Jerry's Homemade
Inc. "But he's in favor of businesses which are caring
members of society."</p>
<p>Still, Mr. Sanders promises to shake things up if sent to
Washington. Asked if he would vote to eliminate the "bubble"
whereby marginal taxes drop for the wealthy -- a feature of
the tax code Democrats seek to eliminate -- Mr. Sanders rolls
his eyes. "Pssh -- eliminate the bubble," he sneers. "I would
develop a steeply progressive income tax."</p>
<p>Mr. Sanders seeks to fan the same voter dissatisfaction
with the bipartisan status quo that has already led to upset
gubernatorial primary victories for two relative newcomers in
nearby Massachusetts. He blames low voter turnout on the
inability of the two major parties to solve the nation's
problems -- particularly those of the poor -- and cites his
own record of doubling Burlington's voter turnout when he was
mayor during the 1980s.</p>
<p>He also lashes out at Rep. Smith for accepting campaign
contributions from corporate political-action committees.
(Mr. Sanders refuses to take money from pro-business
political-action committees, but has received substantial
help from labor PACs and other out-of-state contributors.)
"In Washington, they're crooks," Mr. Sanders tells his
Rotarian audience. "Sometimes I wonder about my insanity
about wanting to go down there."</p>
<p>One Rotarian angrily questions Mr. Sanders about his
refusal, as mayor of Burlington, to fly the United Way flag.
Mr. Sanders corrects him: He did agree to fly the flag -- but
not on the same flag pole as the U.S. flag. "This is not the
time of Charles Dickens, when people flipped coins to
starving children," he retorts.</p>
<p>In an odd twist, Mr. Sanders stands to benefit from
Vermont's backlash against growing national support for gun
control -- an issue usually associated with the left. Both
Mr. Sanders and Rep. Smith support federal limits on assault
weapons, but Rep. Smith's position is viewed as a betrayal by
members of the state's gun lobby, who claim that before he
was elected, Rep. Smith promised to oppose all forms of gun
control. Steven Herchenroder, president of the powerful
Sporting Alliance for Vermont Environment, says his
organization is unlikely to endorse either Mr. Sanders or
Rep. Smith, but "there are going to be sportsmen that will go
out and vote for Sanders because of what Smith did to them."</p>
<p>For his part, the normally loquacious Mr. Sanders grows
quiet when asked whether he supports current legislative
efforts to require a seven-day waiting period for the
purchase of firearms. "I've got to talk to more people about
that one," he says.</p>
