	<p class="article-leader">BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- Hilton Hotels Corp., whose stock
has been battered by weak earnings and worries about the
travel and tourism industries, announced plans to buy back as
many as six million common shares, or about 12.5% of the
outstanding stock.
   The buy-back, part of a previously authorized plan,
reflects an apparent change of heart by the hotel and casino
operator's board. A week earlier, senior Hilton officials
told a group of investors and analysts in Las Vegas, Nev.,
that the company had no plans for a buy-back despite the
drubbing the stock has taken since hitting an all-time high
of $115.50 last summer during the company's aborted auction
process.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>John V. Giovenco, who heads Hilton's casino operations,
also told investors at the conference that operating profits
for the third quarter ending Sept. 30 will decline about 50%
because of increased competition and other problems. Hilton's
stock closed at $30.25 Friday, up 87.5 cents in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
<p>This year, Hilton's board turned down proposals offering
about $90 a share or roughly $4.3 billion for the company's
profitable casinos and hotel operations. Last month, the
company scrapped an offering of liquid-yield option notes
with a principal amount of $650 million when the stock's
decline made the offering impractical.</p>
<p>Analysts and institutional investors, stung by the recent
barrage of bad news, were reserved about the announcement.
"It's hard to say how aggressive they'll be on the buy-back,
although it appears they'd be buying pretty close to the
bottom," said Joseph Doyle, an analyst with Smith Barney,
Harris Upham & Co.</p>
<p>"We're not supporting the price of the stock," said Leroy
A. Judge, a Hilton vice president. "We simply see it as a
good investment." The purchases will be made periodically in
the open market or through negotiated purchases, and the
current authorization may be extended beyond the current Dec.
31, 1990, expiration date if conditions warrant. Hilton has
about 48 million commmon shares outstanding.</p>
