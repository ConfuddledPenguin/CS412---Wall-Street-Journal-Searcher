	<p class="article-leader">Apparel companies are likely to report another quarter of
depressed earnings in coming weeks, analysts say, as worries
about the economy heighten already sluggish retail sales.
   In August, retailers failed to get the expected boost from
early fall and back-to-school merchandise, causing analysts
to become more negative in their third-quarter outlook for
the apparel sector.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The third quarter is going to be tough," says Jay
Meltzer, an apparel industry analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Co.
"There is still a discernible amount of inventory to work off
at retail. . . . Most apparel makers are finding that
retailers are playing it much closer to the vest than ever
before, which has made it tough for {apparel companies} to
make their plans."</p>
<p>Observes Josie Esquivel of Shearson Lehman Brothers:
"Back-to-school didn't happen, and the first couple of weeks
in September were weak. Things look very bleak for the third
quarter."</p>
<p>For the 16 apparel companies she follows, Elizabeth
Armstrong of Prescott Ball & Turben Inc. projects
third-quarter earnings will rise an average of 4.1% from a
year earlier. But the chasm between strong companies and the
weak ones has become more pronounced this year, she and other
analysts said.</p>
<p>Expected to continue posting decent third-quarter gains
from a year earlier are Liz Claiborne Inc., estimated to gain
about 15%; Fruit of the Loom, climbing between 15% and 20%;
and Leslie Fay Co. increasing about 11%, according to
estimates by Deborah Bronston, an analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc.</p>
<p>But stagnant retail sales in August and early September
have clobbered weaker players in the apparel group, and those
companies will report lower third-quarter earnings. These
include VF Corp., where jeans sales continue to lag; Bernard
Chaus Inc.; and Hartmarx Corp., where analysts expect a
third-quarter loss compared with a year-earlier profit.</p>
<p>"During the first half of 1990, apparel and textile
inventories were up, and manufacturer shipments were down,"
says Patricia L. Ryan of Raymond James Associates. "And now,
with the problems of the Middle East heating up and reducing
consumer confidence," retailers such as giant Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. are holding back commitments for orders, she adds. For
fleecewear maker Russell Corp., for example, she notes that
the company has healthy orders and backlogs, but is waiting
for retailers to commit to a shipment date.</p>
