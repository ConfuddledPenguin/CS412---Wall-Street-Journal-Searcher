	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole, breaking
with the White House in a bid to resolve the budget deadlock,
endorsed higher income taxes on the wealthy to offset
President Bush's proposed cut in the capital-gains tax rate.
   The Kansas Republican went public with his overture
yesterday just hours before he and seven other negotiators
from Congress and the Bush administration resumed their
closed-door talks on a deficit-reduction deal. Those
four-month-old talks, aimed at cutting the federal budget
deficit by $50 billion in fiscal 1991 and $500 billion over
five years, have assumed new urgency as the Oct. 1 start of
fiscal 1991 approaches -- threatening government chaos in the
absence of a budget accord.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It is unclear whether Sen. Dole's position has enough
support in either party to herald a breakthrough. For many
Democrats, something less than a 33% top rate, as Sen. Dole
suggested, would not be high enough to shift more of the tax
burden to the rich. It is certain to inflame some
Republicans, especially in the House, who demand a
capital-gains tax cut but adamantly oppose higher taxes. And
as Sen. Dole himself acknowledged, House GOP support is
critical because Democratic congressional leaders have
insisted that any deficit-cutting deal must have the votes of
a majority of Republicans in both the House and Senate.</p>
<p>In the wake of President Bush's retreat from his
no-new-taxes campaign pledge, negotiators tentatively have
agreed to tax increases on a variety of things such as luxury
goods and alcoholic beverages. But some Republicans had
calculated that if income taxes weren't raised, they could
argue that the president hadn't really broken his vow. They
also want to preserve their identity as the anti-tax party
going into the November elections.</p>
<p>Sen. Dole suggested the trade-off between a capital-gains
tax cut and higher income-tax rates during an appearance on
CBS News's "Face the Nation" with Senate Democratic Leader
George Mitchell of Maine. Democrats previously proposed a
similar exchange, with a top marginal rate of 33% or 35% for
the richest Americans.</p>
<p>Sen. Dole said negotiators should explore "how we can
increase taxes on upper-income {taxpayers} in a way that will
pierce the so-called bubble, but maybe not go clear to 33%."</p>
<p>The "bubble" refers to an anomaly in the tax code whereby
the wealthiest Americans pay a 28% top marginal rate, while
some higher-income taxpayers who make less pay a 33% top
rate. Ending the anomaly would raise revenue, but, more
important, would help satisfy the Democrats' demand that the
rich shoulder more of the tax burden. Because lower
capital-gains taxes would mostly benefit the wealthy,
Democrats have made higher income-tax rates their price for
supporting a tax cut.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, some administration officials privately
discussed a plan to eliminate the bubble with a new, 31% tax
rate. The result would be a tax increase for the richest
families but a cut for many more families who are now within
the bubble range. Total government revenue would be
unchanged, allowing the president to argue he hadn't raised
income taxes.</p>
<p>Sen. Dole has split with the Bush administration before,
notably a year ago when he helped resolve a similar budget
impasse by unilaterally jettisoning a capital-gains proposal.
Last week, he peeved administration officials by suggesting
that the capital-gains provision be stripped from any
deficit-reduction pact, and be passed separately in a package
containing revenue-losing provisions and Democratic spending
initiatives.</p>
<p>Sen. Dole likewise bared his own pique toward the
administration negotiators -- White House Chief of Staff John
Sununu, Budget Director Richard Darman and Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady. "I don't know what else they've got to do
this year," he said, "but I've got a lot of things I'd like
to do."</p>
<p>The remark reflects Mr. Dole's zeal for legislating and
his frustration with the budget standoff that is slowing
congressional action on many other issues. A traditional
Republican for whom cutting deficits is more important than
cutting taxes, Sen. Dole called for a budget agreement "with
or without capital gains."</p>
<p>In remarks after the CBS program, Sen. Dole all but washed
his hands of the issue. "My view is the White House ought to
negotiate capital gains," he said. "If any of the rest of us
say anything, it will be perceived by some in the White House
of being disloyal. So let Sununu work that out. He's the
expert . . . I just want to get {a budget agreement} done. I
think we're really sort of a laughingstock now."</p>
<p>Sen. Mitchell reiterated Democrats' claim that White House
insistence on the tax cut was holding up an accord.
Republicans dispute that, and negotiators do remain far apart
on questions of defense and domestic spending cuts, tax
increases and methods of enforcing any agreement over five
years. Sen. Dole noted the other differences, but agreed with
Sen. Mitchell that "right now the big hurdle is capital
gains."</p>
<p>Failure to reach a budget agreement this week threatens
congressional Democratic leaders' plans to pass a short-term
spending bill. Such a bill is essential to keep the
government financed in the first weeks of the fiscal year
because regular appropriations.</p>
<p>Action is also needed to delay at least $85 billion in
automatic across-the-board cuts, which would be required by
the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. But the Bush
administration and GOP lawmakers have said that in order to
maintain the pressure on negotiators, they would try to
defeat any attempt to avert fiscal crisis until a budget pact
is reached.</p>
