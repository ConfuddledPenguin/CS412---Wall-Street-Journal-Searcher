	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Barred from meeting in person with a special
committee of the Lockheed Corp. board, NL Industries Inc.
sent the group a videotape last week attacking Lockheed's
poison-pill plan to deter hostile takeovers.
   The videotape marks the latest move in Dallas financier
Harold Simmons' campaign to increase his stake in the
nation's sixth largest Pentagon contractor. Mr. Simmons, who
lost a proxy battle for control of Lockheed in April,
controls a 19.8% stake in the company through NL Industries,
a Houston chemical concern that he controls.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the poison-pill provision, acquisition by Mr.
Simmons of more than 20% of Lockheed's stock could trigger
the issuance of shares that would dilute his stake. Mr.
Simmons has asked Lockheed to amend the provision and allow
him to buy 10 million Lockheed shares now controlled by the
trustee of Lockheed's employee stock-ownership plan.</p>
<p>In a lawsuit filed in federal court in Los Angeles last
April, NL attacked the plan as an attempt by Lockheed
management to entrench itself. Also included in last week's
SEC filing was a previously sealed amended complaint
involving that lawsuit.</p>
<p>The amended complaint charged that Lockheed had hidden
from shareholders the potential size of the plan, which NL
claimed is operating as "a creeping, management-led, employee
buy-out of the company."</p>
<p>In Calabasas, Calif., a Lockheed spokesman said it
considered the NL complaint "to be without merit and simply
more harassment."</p>
