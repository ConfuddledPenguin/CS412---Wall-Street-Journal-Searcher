	<p class="article-leader">Antonio Greco's criminal record goes back nearly 30 years
and includes three convictions in Italy, one as recently as
1982, and a half-dozen arrests in the U.S. According to a
computer printout that appears to be his complete criminal
record in Italy, prison sentences for each of his Italian
convictions were commuted as part of general presidential
amnesties. All U.S. charges were dropped.
   Mr. Greco was born in Italy in 1939 to a family whose
members own and operate a number of Italian hotels. According
to the printout, he was convicted of theft in 1962 by a Rome
court and sentenced to one year and four months in prison.
That same year, according to a person who has known Mr. Greco
for 25 years, Mr. Greco moved to Lima, Peru, after
befriending a Peruvian diplomat who had stayed in one of his
family's properties. In Lima, this person says, Mr. Greco
opened an Italian restaurant that was frequented by senior
government officials.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>By 1968 he had moved to America. In the next four years,
U.S. police records show, Mr. Greco was arrested at least
five times for a variety of offenses: December 1968, New
Orleans, smuggling counterfeit Omega watches; July 1969,
Miami, violating immigration laws; April 1970, Pompano Beach,
Fla., illegally selling watches from a hotel room and
attempting to bribe a police officer; December 1971, Miami,
possessing false identification cards and an unlicensed .25
caliber pistol; September 1972, Miami International Airport,
possessing airline tickets stolen the previous summer from a
Lindhurst, N.J., travel agency. (Mr. Greco was rearrested ten
years later for the last offense when, after he narrowly
avoided an accident with a Miami police car, a routine check
of his driver's license revealed an outstanding arrest
warrant.) For various reasons, each of these charges was
dismissed.</p>
<p>According to several people familiar with his work, by the
mid-1970s Mr. Greco was operating as a paid informant in
Europe for the federal Bureau of Narcotics, a predecessor
agency to the Drug Enforcement Administration. His "handler"
was Paul Knight, a federal agent who later became American
Express's European security chief. In the late 1970s, these
people say, Mr. Greco helped American Express break a major
European fraud case, and has done work off and on for the
company ever since. He has also worked for a Washington-based
detective agency. A former American Express executive says
company security officials believed the detective to be
generally above-board, although security officials "knew he
had some trouble in one or two countries."</p>
