	<p class="article-leader">Robert Goldberg's Sept. 5 Leisure & Arts story, "Math and
Pizza-Making," discussing the PBS and CBS shows on how the
current education system can be fixed makes me think of the
many Soviets who still think they can tinker with the
socialist economy and fix it.
   Both the Soviet economy and the American school system
suffer from the same problem -- they are owned and operated
by the government. Socialism is widely recognized as a
failure, but many people who should know better will not give
up on it. Only when the American public realizes that the
U.S. has a "socialist education system" will we will take the
first step toward solving the problem.</p>
