	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Just as the U.S. is coming to grips with the
consequences of years of cozying up to Iraq, it risks heading
down the same path with another of the world's bad actors --
Syria.
   When Secretary of State James Baker met with President
Hafez Assad in Damascus recently, his purpose was to bolster
the U.S.-led effort against Mr. Assad's longtime foe, Iraq's
Saddam Hussein.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That may have been a reasonable tactical maneuver in a big
crisis. But unless the sudden warming of relations with Syria
is carefully contained, it could well embolden that country's
ruthless regime, just as Iraq was strengthened by the support
it won from Washington during its war with Iran. Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait demonstrates the hazards of setting aside
longterm considerations in favor of building ties to an
enemy's enemy.</p>
<p>Already, there are troubling signs of a softening of U.S.
attitudes toward Syria on the most important issue separating
the two nations -- Syrian support for terrorists who have
killed hundreds of Americans over the past decade.</p>
<p>"There are still problems revolving around this question
of terrorism," Mr. Baker blandly said at a Damascus news
conference that the Assad regime had packed with sullen
secret police trying to look like journalists. He then gave
the floor to Syria's foreign minister, who blamed "the media
in the West" for "exaggerating the terrorism issue in our
region."</p>
<p>President Assad, for his part, pleaded with Mr. Baker that
he was being unfairly branded as a backer of terrorism.</p>
<p>How could the U.S. expect him to help solve the Pan Am
Flight 103 bombing case, Mr. Assad asked, when the Central
Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation
were refusing to provide him details of their investigation?
If he had hard evidence, Mr. Assad said, he'd be willing to
put on trial in Syria the Damascus-based terrorists the U.S.
blames for the atrocity, the Popular Front for the Liberation
of Palestine-General Command.</p>
<p>Mr. Baker apparently took this request seriously. He told
reporters: "There is . . . a disagreement between us on the
sufficiency of the evidence. We will work to resolve that
disagreement." Last week, meetings began here among U.S.
officials to see what more about the case could be told to
Mr. Assad.</p>
<p>In the past two years, Mr. Assad has taken pains to
quieten his public role in terrorism, much as Iraq did in the
early 1980s. Syria also has tried to curry favor here by
"facilitating" the release of U.S. hostages in Lebanon.</p>
<p>But Mr. Assad isn't an innocent bystander, a landlord with
an open mind whose country happens to house a few killers.
According to U.S. intelligence officials, he has been an
active backer of terrorists who kill Americans. In fact, they
believe he is far worse on this score than Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>"I've been around long enough to recognize the need for
democratic societies to make temporary alliances with
unsavory regimes for immediate military advantage," says Rep.
Tom Lantos (D., Calif.). "But I particularly caution the
State Department not to portray President Assad of Syria and
the Syrian regime as an ally. That regime in terms of its
recent history is no less bloodthirsty, no less brutal . . .
than the bloodthirsty regime of Saddam Hussein."</p>
<p>The Syrian government created, and still controls, the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command
-- the group believed to have planted the bomb that went off
on Pan Am Flight 103 as it flew over Lockerbie, Scotland, in
December 1988, murdering 270 people, including 189 Americans.
The group's leader, Ahmad Jibril, is a former Syrian army
captain who is believed to report to Syrian intelligence
officials close to Mr. Assad.</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence believes Mr. Assad already has all the
detailed evidence he would need against the PFLP-GC. The
group is thought to have bombed the Pan Am airliner under
contract to Syria's ally, Iran, with Syrian permission.</p>
<p>The leader of the cell that is thought to have assembled
the bombs for the Pan Am attack entered Germany before the
bombing on an official Syrian passport. And that cell leader,
Hafez Dalkamoni, is under indictment in Germany for trying to
blow up two U.S. troop trains there. If he had succeeded, he
would have slaughtered hundreds of the same U.S. soldiers
with whom Syrian troops now stand shoulder to shoulder
against Iraq.</p>
<p>And that isn't all. Throughout the 1980s, Mr. Assad helped
Iran organize the Shiite terrorist network that took U.S.
citizens hostage and staged the 1983 bombing of the U.S.
Marine barracks in Lebanon that killed 241.</p>
<p>The intelligence and counterterrorism arms of the U.S.
government are resisting turning detailed information on Pan
Am 103 over to Mr. Assad because that might enable him to
find out how much they know about the bombing and how they
learned it. They fear such information would soon be in the
hands of the terrorists themselves, who could use it to
improve their security.</p>
<p>The counterterrorists also are loath to see the PFLP-GC
tried in the friendly confines of Damascus instead of in
Scotland, where the crash occurred. But it remains to be seen
whether they will be able to resist State Department pressure
to compromise with Mr. Assad.</p>
