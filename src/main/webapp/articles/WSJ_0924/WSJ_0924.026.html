	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency said it
would continue to ban imports of European wine containing a
fungicide while it studies whether the substance is harmful.
   The move, which drew an angry response from the National
Association of Beverage Importers, came even though
preliminary EPA analysis suggests that the levels of the
chemical don't pose a health threat. Under EPA procedures,
the soonest that wine containing the chemical could be back
on the U.S. market is next summer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The fungicide, procymidone, has been found in 20% of the
French wines sampled by the Food and Drug Administration, 6%
of the Italian wines and 2% of the Spanish wines. In Europe,
where wine containing procymidone residues is legal and
considered safe, the fungicide is used to kill the botrytis
fungus on grapes. It isn't used in the U.S.</p>
<p>In an interview, EPA chief William Reilly said, "I have
looked carefully for ways to avoid disruption of trade and
still ensure compliance with the law and fully protect the
public health against any risk, however remote."</p>
<p>The beverage importers association, however, said it is
"very disappointed" by the EPA decision, which it said "could
have a disastrous impact on international trade relations and
invite retaliatory action by the Europeans." The group urged
the U.S. "to fully consider the ramifications of the EPA
action and the potential for European trade embargoes against
U.S. food products."</p>
<p>Under federal law, the government must block the import of
any food or beverage containing residues of a pesticide for
which the EPA hasn't set a tolerance, or allowable level. The
FDA began confiscating shipments of wine found to contain the
chemical after it turned up during a routine test last
February.</p>
<p>Mr. Reilly emphasized, though, that consumers needn't stop
drinking European wine, even if it was purchased before the
procymidone was detected. "People shouldn't worry about
this," he said. "I intend myself not to worry about it."</p>
<p>But he was critical of Sumitomo Chemical Corp., maker of
the chemical, which failed to obtain a tolerance for
procymidone before shipments started. Wine industry officials
also have criticized the company.</p>
<p>In April, the company did ask the EPA to set a tolerance
level and sought expedited proceedings that would have
allowed it to ship wine containing residue while the EPA
studied the matter. The EPA declined, but said it is
expediting its review of the data. Such a review normally
takes several years, but the EPA is seeking public comment on
whether to propose an interim tolerance level that would
allow shipments to resume next summer.</p>
