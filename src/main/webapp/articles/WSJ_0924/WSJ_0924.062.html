	<p class="article-leader">If you think President Bush is going to flex a little
muscle in the Persian Gulf without setting off yet another
dawdling debate about the separation of powers, think again.
   Actually, the confluence of the publication of Louis
Henkin's "Constitutionalism, Democracy and Foreign Affairs,"
(Columbia University Press, 125 pages, $25) and Michael
Glennon's "Constitutional Diplomacy" (Princeton University
Press, 353 pages, $35) with the current U.S. military
engagement is coincidental, though instructive nonetheless,
as it reminds us just why such windbags are in business.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Both professors begin from a premise that no reasonably
informed undergraduate would believe for a minute: That in
the past two decades, a turbo-charged executive branch has
trounced on the foreign-policy authority of a supine
Congress.</p>
<p>It is as if the authors were stuffed in a time capsule
when Arthur J. Schlesinger's "Imperial Presidency" was
brought out in 1973. How else to explain their total
disregard of the real post-Vietnam story: the delving of
Congress into every nook and cranny of the policy process,
from micromanaging the defense budget to scrutinizing the
intelligence agencies?</p>
<p>One answer does leap from these pages. Plainly, Mssers.
Henkin and Glennon were ticked that Ronald Reagan refused to
play nice-nice with scurvy thugs like Moammar Qaddafi and
Daniel Ortega. So they've penned the opening missives in what
portends to be another endeavor, by the puling precincts in
the academy and the media, to ordain any presidential use of
force a "constitutional crisis."</p>
<p>As befits the noted Columbia scholar, Mr. Henkin is lucid
and fairly detached in arguing, as he long has, for
congressional supremacy in foreign affairs. Not so Mr.
Glennon, an ex-congressional staffer now at the University of
California at Davis, whose methodology proves both abstruse
and pernicious.</p>
<p>Both professors construe narrowly the foreign-policy
powers of the president spelled out in the Constitution and
see Congress's broadly. But the main contest between the two
branches continues to be in what Supreme Court Justice Robert
Jackson tagged the "twilight zone," where the Constitution is
either ambiguous or silent.</p>
<p>The authors wish to define this zone not through the
political process, as has been the admittedly imperfect case
historically, but with the liberals' last refuge, judicial
fiat. Mr. Glennon goes a step further, arguing that the
courts ought to regard "international law as our law."</p>
<p>In practice, this would mean that any time a president
acted when Congress hadn't officially spoken, as is currently
the case with Iraq, he could be hauled into court by a
dissenting member of Congress or a flaky lobbyist. And if the
court agreed with Mr. Glennon, any U.S. action not in sync
with the bogus idea of international law would be ruled
unconstitutional (i.e. Grenada, Nicaragua, Libya, Panama).</p>
<p>Thus far, the courts wisely have dismissed most cases of
this type as non-justiciable political matters. Applying Mr.
Glennon's loaded criteria in the few foreign-policy powers
cases where grounds for a ruling have been found, virtually
every decision ever won by the executive would be decided in
favor of Congress. This is a recipe not for more cooperation
and accountability between the branches, but for a
superannuated presidency and a despotic Congress.</p>
<p>Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan takes us to the same dead end
in "On the Law of Nations" (Harvard University Press, 224
pages, $22.50). Mr. Moynihan writes in ostensible protest of
the "insistent American disavowal of international legal
norms" in the 1980s. His conceit is the presumption that
"international law exists," not merely as an idea, but as
law. There is no attempt to convince the reader why the U.S.
should vest its security in the International Court of
Justice, whose U.N.-appointed members, more often than not,
represent bandit regimes without the faintest regard for
common decency, much less any sort of law or democratic
principle.</p>
<p>The senator is onto something when he exposes the annoying
habit of U.S. presidents to "do what {they} want to do in the
reasonable expectation that in time someone . . . will put
out a brief demonstrating that, whatever the decision, it was
legal." Would that he heeded the logic of his complaint and
put the case against Reagan-Bush interventionism on its
merits, instead of captiously marking it "illegal."</p>
<p>Already, as everywhere, there are too many lawyers with
their fingers in foreign policy. And we know the sole
"result" of an earlier attempt to litigate an
executive-legislative policy clash, in the Iran-Contra cases:
Special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh's jowls have been embedded
firmly in the federal feed bag for 45 months, and counting.</p>
<p>The implication of such paralysis for foreign policy per
se is even graver. Should the weak sisters in Congress decide
enough is enough in the Persian Gulf, for instance, they will
find plenty of cover in these books to hide their policy
choice in high-flown constitutionalist rhetoric. The result
would be foreign policy unworthy of the name.</p>
