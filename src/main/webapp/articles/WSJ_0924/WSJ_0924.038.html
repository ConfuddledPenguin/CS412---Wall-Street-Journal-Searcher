	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense consultant William Galvin was
sentenced to 32 months in prison after pleading guilty to
bribing two senior Pentagon officials to influence the
awarding of lucrative military contracts.
   Mr. Galvin, a major figure in the defense procurement
scandal, was also fined $10,000 by U.S. District Judge Claude
M. Hilton in Alexandra, Va., on his guilty plea to charges of
conspiracy, bribery and tax evasion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Along with another 32-month prison term given to a former
Unisys Corp. executive, Mr. Galvin's sentence was the longest
imposed in the long-running probe of Pentagon procurement
fraud.</p>
<p>Mr. Galvin, 59 years old, faced a possible 40-year prison
sentence and fines of as much as $1 million. But prosecutors,
citing Mr. Galvin's "extraordinary cooperation" with the
investigation, asked Judge Hilton to impose a shorter prison
term. Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Aronica told Judge
Hilton that Mr. Galvin is expected to be "a critical witness
in future prosecutions."</p>
<p>Mr. Galvin pleaded guilty in March to arranging payments
through a Swiss bank account to then-Assistant Navy Secretary
Melvyn R. Paisley for helping an Israeli company sell
pilotless intelligence airplanes to the Pentagon. Mr. Galvin
also said he paid $123,100 from 1983 to 1985 to a friend of
Victor D. Cohen, then a deputy assistant Air Force secretary,
knowing that some of the money would be given to Mr. Cohen to
influence the awarding of a contract on radar-warning
devices. Mr. Paisley and Mr. Cohen haven't been charged but
both are under investigation.</p>
<p>Under his plea, Mr. Galvin agreed to pay the Internal
Revenue Service $648,548 in back taxes and interest.</p>
