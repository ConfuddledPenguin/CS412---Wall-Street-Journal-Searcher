	<p class="article-leader">SBA'S NO. 2 gets the ax, but did her boss or the White
House wield it?
   Kay Bulow, whose aggressive style as the Small Business
Administration's deputy administrator alienated some people,
was given her walking papers late last week. SBA chief Susan
Engeleiter, who had fought to bring Ms. Bulow to the agency,
says her deputy is leaving by mutual agreement because the
two differ in management style. SBA officials claim Ms.
Engeleiter took the initiative.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But others familiar with the situation say White House
Chief of Staff John Sununu pushed the eject button after Ms.
Bulow demoted and transferred some longtime staffers in the
SBA's finance department. Members of the small-business
lending community were so unhappy, they started calling the
White House.</p>
<p>Pressure from all sides may have toppled the powerful SBA
aide, whose influence grew, some staffers say, because of Ms.
Engeleiter's frequent travel schedule. Ms. Bulow made enemies
inside and outside the agency with her tough style. When
staffers asked an SBA expert how to alert Ms. Engeleiter to
the Bulow problem, he warned: "When you shoot, don't miss."</p>
<p>But some agency workers and outside officials have praised
Ms. Bulow as a manager who would make decisions. Some said
her rough and tumble style would play differently if used by
a man. The new acting SBA deputy will be June Nichols, the
agency's Atlanta regional director. Ms. Bulow couldn't be
reached for comment.</p>
<p>One lender who deals with the SBA regularly says the Bulow
ouster may make Ms. Engeleiter realize "she can't delegate
leadership at the agency."</p>

<p>CLEAN-AIR BREAKS can be given to small firms by states,
Congress decides.</p>
<p>A House-Senate conference committee settling differences
on a final clean-air bill agreed that states can offer small
companies extra technical help, time and flexibility in
complying with the law. The committee adopted provisions
saying each state must set up programs to tell small
companies how they can cut pollution and how to handle the
act's paper-work requirements. Each state would designate an
official to be the small-business ombudsman and also create
an advisory panel to monitor the assistance program.</p>
<p>If they wish, states also can set up a no-fault inspection
system to check compliance with the law. State or private
inspectors would do regular audits of small companies to
point out illegal practices that must be corrected, but
without assigning fines. However, establishing a no-fault
system, as well as giving a concern flexibility and extra
time to comply with the law, would be options, not
requirements. Reps. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) and Rick Boucher
(D., Va.) pushed for the changes on the House side, while
Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R., Minn.) sponsored an amendment
included in the Senate bill.</p>
<p>"We wanted to make sure firms like dry cleaners and
furniture makers wouldn't be thrown into a bureaucratic ocean
where it's presumed they have the lawyers and experts that
bigger companies do," says Rep. Wyden.</p>

<p>RALLY ROUND THE CHAIRMAN: Several small-business groups
will honor House Small Business Committee Chairman John
LaFalce (D., N.Y.) at a dinner this week to show appreciation
for his unsuccessful effort to broker a compromise on
language in the civil-rights bill. He proposed a change
limiting monetary damages for violations of the new
legislation. This infuriated House civil-rights forces who
had counted him as a friend. Rep. Major Owens (D., N.Y.)
fumed that Rep. LaFalce had "crawled out of the sewer." The
dinner's sponsors include the National Federation of
Independent Business, National Association of Manufacturers,
U.S. Chamber of Commerce and four other groups.</p>

<p>FRANCHISE FLAP: The Federal Trade Commission continues on
the trail of errant franchisors. The FTC charged Lifecall
Systems Inc. of Camden, N.J., whose franchisees sell
emergency alert units for elderly or sick people, with
failing to provide prospective franchisees with required
information and misrepresenting the business's profit
potential. Lifecall, without admitting or denying the
charges, agreed to a consent order to change its practices
and pay a $150,000 fine.</p>

<p>CONFUSION MARKS smaller firms' views on a unified European
market.</p>
<p>As Washington policy makers ponder the impact of the 1992
advent of a single European market on U.S. business, a new
survey of nearly 300 U.S. chief executives of smaller
concerns shows that nearly half are confused about what the
change will mean to them. More than half think it will either
hurt or have little effect on profits. A third of those
responding think the plan will create a fortress Europe
atmosphere hostile to U.S. exporters.</p>
<p>The survey, conducted by Market Access Europe, a
London-based research and public affairs company, also shows
that 70% of the small companies understand the general
principles of a unified common market, but not its detailed
proposals.</p>
<p>American companies "have a serious information gap" about
Europe's new single-market plan, says David Boddy, Market
Access's chairman. Without detailed information on new
regulations and technical specifications, he says, a firm
could find itself barred from the 12 member countries instead
of just from one. He also argues that now is the time for
exporters to help shape the new rules. "If the U.S. wants
this country to trade its way out of the economic slump,
there's a lot of work to do," Mr. Boddy says. European
concerns already are gearing up for the American market, he
adds.</p>
<p>Respondents view the German and British markets favorably,
except for high labor costs, but are more dubious about Italy
and Greece. About a third believe the French are
unsympathetic to the U.S. style of business.</p>

<p>SMALL TALK: The House and Senate have approved legislation
authorizing a White House Conference on Small Business, to be
held in early 1994, following state and regional conferences
starting in 1992. . . . The Federal Communications Commission
sponsors a conference on Minorities and Telecommunications
Enterprise in Washington, D.C., this week to offer
minority-owned concerns information on entering common
carrier telecommunications businesses.</p>
