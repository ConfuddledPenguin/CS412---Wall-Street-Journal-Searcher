	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Economists aren't expecting any surprises in
this week's economic indicators, but the numbers aren't
likely to provide much comfort on the economy's direction,
either.
   This week's reports are likely to solidify the belief that
the economy is sliding into a recession. "There's a move
toward pessimism," says Robert Dederick, chief economist of
Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. "A month ago, there were more
diverse views. Now we're all shifting to the other side of
the boat."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Few economists expect any significant change in the
government's final version of second-quarter gross national
product, scheduled for release tomorrow, which was previously
estimated to have grown at a 1.2% annual rate. Real gross
national product is the inflation-adjusted value of the
nation's total output of goods and services.</p>
<p>Instead, they are looking to indicators that provide sneak
previews of the economy's third-quarter performance and give
some new insight on the economic impact of the Mideast
crisis. The focus is on durable goods and personal
consumption for August, both scheduled for Wednesday,
followed by personal income on Thursday. Other important
indicators scheduled to be released this week include
mid-September auto sales, the Commerce Department's index of
leading indicators for August, new jobless claims and August
agricultural prices.</p>
<p>While economists note that orders for durable goods are
volatile and hard to predict, the consensus view holds that
the latest figure will reflect a significant drop in
manufacturers' confidence in the economy. MMS International,
a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc., New York, says its weekly survey
of economists shows durable goods orders plunging 1%. That is
a big change from the 2.8% increase in July.</p>
<p>Because of the general weakness in the economy, economists
expect orders for metals, machinery and transportation
equipment to be down substantially. July's 2.8% increase
reflected stronger-than-expected aircraft orders. MMS
International says the survey of economists indicated that
few expect aircraft orders to be as strong as they were in
July. Truck and auto sales also are expected to be off.</p>
<p>Gary Cimenero, chief economist at Fleet/Norstar Financial
Group in Providence R.I., doesn't see much hope in personal
consumption or income data. In line with the consensus, he
predicts a sluggish 0.3% rise in personal consumption and a
0.4% rise in personal income. But when adjusted for
inflation, which is creeping up, both figures show declines
in real terms. If so, Mr. Cimenero says, the data "would
reinforce the idea that consumers are really pulling in their
horns on spending." Moreover, he expects continued weak
employment data.</p>
<p>Mid-September auto sales due tomorrow may provide other
clues on how consumers are reacting to the prolonged crisis
in the Middle East. Brian J. Fabbri, chief economist at
Midland Montagu, New York, notes that although car dealers
push hard in September to move out old models to make way for
new ones, sales have been weak so far. In the first 10 days
of September, U.S. car sales totaled 7.1 million units. Mr.
Fabbri expects a similar to slightly lower figure for
mid-September, with early 1991 sales dropping off sharply
once the initial promotions are finished.</p>
<p>So how negative is the overall outlook? The Commerce
Department's index of leading indicators, statistics that are
expected to move up or down ahead of the economy, will be
reported on Friday. It has remained unchanged for the past
two months, but is expected to have tumbled nearly 1% in
August.</p>
<p>Fleet/Norstar's Mr. Cimenero notes that eight of the 11
components of the index -- including stock prices, consumer
expectations, unemployment insurance claims and
manufacturers' unfilled orders -- should have influenced it
negatively.</p>
<p>Economists say that while the impact of the Mideast crisis
is just beginning to work its way into a variety of
indicators, the continuing uncertainty plays prominently as
they move toward third-quarter GNP forecasts. "The Middle
East is dominating all these numbers," says Robert T. McGee,
chief economist at the Tokai Bank's regional headquarters in
New York. "Every time the price of oil goes up a dollar, it
adds to the likelihood that inflation will be greater and
that the economy will be weaker."</p>
