	<p class="article-leader">Michael Milken is scheduled to be sentenced for his crimes
in a week and the battle over what the government may tell
the public about the former junk bond king -- and when -- is
well under way.
   A federal judge is expected to hear arguments today from
lawyers for Mr. Milken, his brother, Lowell Milken, several
media organizations and others about a sentencing memorandum
that the government has filed with the court about Mr.
Milken. The sentencing memorandum, filed under seal this
month, contains information about the six securities
fraud-related crimes to which Mr. Milken pleaded guilty in
April, as well as a host of other alleged crimes that the
government believes he committed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The government's sentencing memo, which is understood to
total more than 200 pages, is intended to persuade U.S.
District Judge Kimba Wood to issue a stiff sentence when Mr.
Milken appears before her next Monday. Mr. Milken's lawyers
have had the opportunity to rebut the government's
allegations in their own memo.</p>
<p>Lawyers for Lowell Milken asked Judge Wood late Friday to
order prosecutors to delete those portions of their
sentencing memo that refer to Lowell Milken. Lowell Milken
was employed by the Beverly Hills, Calif., junk bond
department that his brother headed for Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc. Drexel filed for bankruptcy this year.</p>
<p>Lowell Milken had been charged with securities and tax
fraud in an indictment filed last year. But the government
agreed to dismiss all charges against Lowell Milken when his
brother agreed to plead guilty. His lawyers said that "the
government has pursued a meritless case against Lowell
Milken," and that any mention of him in his brother's
sentencing memo would violate his Fifth Amendment rights. The
Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution forbids the
government from publicly charging a person with the
commission of crimes unless he has the opportunity to defend
himself at trial.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Judge Wood also will decide whether any portion
of the sentencing memo can be released prior to Mr. Milken's
sentencing. Several media organizations, including this
newspaper, have argued that the public has a right to view
the memo before Mr. Milken is sentenced. However, Mr.
Milken's attorneys oppose any release of the memo before next
week, arguing that early release could lead to "undue public
clamor and improper pressure" on the court.</p>
