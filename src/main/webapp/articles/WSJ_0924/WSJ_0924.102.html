	<p class="article-leader">MILPITAS, Calif. -- LSI Logic Corp. said it will unveil
today a set of chips that will drastically reduce the cost of
video conferencing and other "multimedia" technologies.
   LSI said it will introduce a family of so-called
full-motion video compression chips, chips that shrink video
images into small amounts of data so that the images can be
processed by telephone lines and computers that otherwise
couldn't handle the information. Called the L64700 family,
LSI's chips will help bring the cost of a typical
teleconferencing system down to $5,000 in 1992 from about
$50,000 today, said LSI Vice President Brian Halla.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts see teleconferencing, which allows people in
different locations to hold meetings by watching each other
on TV screens, as a big growth market in the 1990s. And
computers of the 1990's are expected to be used increasingly
to display and edit movielike images. But such systems cost
too much today for broad acceptance, in part because
conventional technology can't squeeze moving images enough to
fit on cheap telephone lines. LSI said a kit of its L64700
chips that function as a standard "codec," a coder and
decoder of video information, will cost under $700.</p>
