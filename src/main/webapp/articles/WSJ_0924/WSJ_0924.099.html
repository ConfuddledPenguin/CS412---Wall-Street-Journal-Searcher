	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Analysts, glimpsing how even the first shock
waves from surging oil prices are souring consumer sentiment
and crimping spending, are forging new corporate earnings
estimates -- this time with a recession in mind.
   Since Aug. 15, 75% of all revisions on estimated 1991
earnings have been decreases, according to Zacks Investment
Research, Chicago, which tracks some 4,000 companies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"This is the worst set of readings since the last
recession in 1981," says Benjamin Zacks, executive vice
president of the company. "These numbers are getting very,
very bleak."</p>
<p>And so are the market's reactions. Even minor adjustments
in earnings forecasts are triggering torrents of sell orders.
On Friday, for example, Scott Paper fell 17% after company
executives told investors that third-quarter and full-year
profit may fall below year-earlier results.</p>
<p>Analysts have even reversed their optimism in formerly
bullish groups as recessionary trends become more apparent.
From June 15 through Aug. 15, analysts raised 27 estimates on
semiconductor companies and lowered 11, Mr. Zacks says. But
in the past month, only five estimates were raised while 25
were lowered.</p>
<p>Reinforcing the "safe growth" theme, estimate revisions
have gone up for hospital management companies, such as
Humana, U.S. HealthCare and United Healthcare, Mr. Zacks
says, as well as for drug makers and mining concerns. And in
general, big makers of nondurable goods for consumers with
dependable earnings growth, such as Warner-Lambert, Philip
Morris, Johnson & Johnson and Procter & Gamble "are holding
to slight earnings upgrades," Mr. Zacks adds.</p>
<p>Those are the few stocks that investors are holding onto
as they run for cover, shares of companies in which they
retain any confidence that profit projections will be
fulfilled. Stocks that aren't as well known by investors and
aren't as closely followed by Wall Street analysts are being
hammered hard as safety-first investors dump them.</p>
<p>This pattern shows up in the market barometers. So far
this year, on a total return basis, which includes both price
change and reinvested dividends, the Dow Jones Industrial
Average is down 6.16%, and Standard & Poor's 500-stock index
is off 9.61%. But the rest of the market, as measured by the
Wilshire 5000 index minus the 500 S&P stocks, has sunk
16.51%.</p>
<p>This isn't to say big brand-name stocks are escaping
unscathed from this round of second-guessing earnings
strength. This month, through last Thursday, the S&P 500 has
fared a bit worse than the remaining stocks in the Wilshire
5000: On a total return basis the S&P 500 fell 3.24%,
compared with a 3.07% decline in the Wilshire remainder.</p>
<p>"You have total capitulation -- no tolerance to own stocks
with a question regarding the fundamentals," says James Awad,
president of BMI Capital Corp., a money management company.
This shooting down of stock by stock has occurred on such a
scale that the overall damage "is as bad as if there had been
an aggregate cleanout in the market, as in October 1987," he
says.</p>
<p>Even the year's all-stars aren't being spared from the
rash of earnings revisions.</p>
<p>Claire's Stores shares, which gained more than 34% in the
second quarter, dropped 25% last week. On Wednesday, Alex.
Brown & Sons analyst Chris Vroom trimmed his profit estimate
for the women's specialty retailer's current fiscal year by
no more than 10 cents a share to $1.20.</p>
<p>Sell-offs in stocks such as Scott Paper means money is
shifting from those shares to either "safe growth" issues or
out of the stock market altogether.</p>
<p>But even the big blue chips may not withstand selling
pressures in coming days, says Stefan Abrams, chief
investment strategist at Kidder Peabody. Investors already
are selling stocks of companies with earnings prospects that
are relatively invulnerable to economic troubles, he says.</p>
<p>"You can see it in top tier growth issues -- Coke, Pepsi,
and hospital and drug stocks," Mr. Abrams says, asserting
that the market is "in the early stages of capitulation."</p>
<p>Robert Stovall, president of Stovall/Twenty-First
Advisers, observes that hoarding blue chips is typical
behavior early in a bear market. But if a sell-off
accelerates to stampede proportions, the big, easily traded
shares are the ones investors are likely to sell first.</p>
<p>Mr. Abrams of Kidder says the S&P 500 is about 12% above
"fair value," which is based on the yield of the one-year
Treasury bill. "The first reasonable expectation of a
stopping point in the current decline is fair value," he
says. That would be roughly 273 on the S&P 500, which closed
Friday at 311.32, down 0.16; a comparable decline in the
industrial average would bring the average to 2210.89 from
Friday's finish at 2512.38, down 5.94. "The greatest
vulnerability will be in the most liquid stocks -- what
people sell in a capitulation phase," he says.</p>
<p>What could precipitate such a sell-off? "It could be event
driven -- such as an outbreak of war. It could be the
continuing sand-papering of the investment community by a
crude oil price that keeps edging up," Mr. Abrams says.</p>
<p>Whatever happens, Mr. Abrams advises investors to sell
stocks of any company with "questionable" profit prospects
and hang on to cash, perhaps investing in "a short-term
instrument of impeccable quality."</p>
<p>He adds: "It is no time to go foraging around for a few
extra percentage points of yield."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 5.94 to 2512.38
because of rising oil prices, declining hopes for a quick
budget accord in Washington, and bad news in the banking
industry. The loss for the week was 51.73, or 2%.</p>
<p>Friday's loss would have been greater, were it not for
program buying related to the "triple-witching" expirations
of September stock-index futures and options, and options on
individual stocks.</p>
<p>Program activity also was responsible for pushing volume
to 201,050,000 shares on the New York Stock Exchange, the
busiest since Aug. 23 when the industrial average hit its low
for the year. Average volume the previous four days last week
was 136.1 million shares.</p>
<p>Iraq's expulsion of diplomats from the U.S., Egypt and
several other countries helped boost November crude-oil
futures contracts $2.01 a barrel to $35.43. That price jump
hurt stocks, as did the news that the chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee would seek a postponement of
automatic budget cuts, which take effect next week if no
deficit-cutting budget accord is reached by then.</p>
<p>Also weighing on the market was a broad sell-off in bank
stocks in the wake of Chase Manhattan announcing sweeping
restructuring moves. Shares of Chase fell 1 to 12 3/4 on Big
Board volume of 2.6 million shares. The company set a
third-quarter restructuring charge at $350 million and a
loan-loss provision at $650 million, and said it plans to cut
the dividend to 30 cents a share from 62 cents.</p>
<p>Among other money-center bank issues: Citicorp dropped 7/8
to 15 3/4; Manufacturers Hanover tumbled 2 7/8 to 23; Bankers
Trust New York fell 1 3/4 to 34 1/4; BankAmerica slid 1/2 to
20 1/4, and J.P. Morgan fell 3/4 to 32 1/8.</p>
<p>But General Electric, which had lost 9% earlier this week
amid concerns about possible problems at its
financial-services unit, gained 3/4 to 55 7/8. While some
critics say the company's profit growth will slow because of
the prospects for the unit, GE Capital, this newspaper
reported that analysts remain positive on the stock.</p>
<p>Scott Paper plunged 6 7/8 to 34 3/8 after the company said
operating earnings for the third quarter and full year could
fall short of year-earlier levels. Shares of Kimberly-Clark,
a competitor in the paper-products business, fell 2 1/8 to 72
3/4.</p>
<p>Four utility issues that Smith Barney, Harris Upham cited
as havens amid the market's current jitters moved higher.
PacifiCorp rose 7/8 to 19 1/2; Public Service Enterprise
Group added 1/2 to 23 1/4; American Electric Power rose 3/8
to 26 1/2, and Dominion Resources gained 1/4 to 42 7/8.</p>
<p>Hilton Hotels advanced 7/8 to 30 1/4. The company said it
plans to buy back six million common shares, or about 12.5%
of its shares outstanding.</p>
<p>Primerica added 1/8 to 20 3/4. The company's board
approved the buy-back of as many as three million common
shares.</p>
<p>Milton Roy jumped 3 3/4 to 26 3/4 after reaching a
definitive merger agreement with Sundstrand, which is
offering $28 a share for the company. Corroon & Black dropped
1 5/8 to 29 1/4.</p>
<p>Aon withdrew its $40-a-share takeover bid for the company,
which had rejected the offer in favor of pursuing a
stock-swap merger with Britain's Willis Faber.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 1.17
to 316.01, extending its loss for the week to 1.7%.</p>
<p>Howtek fell 3/4 to 7 1/2. Business Week magazine reported
Dean Witter Reynolds, which controls about 20% of the
company, is battling short sellers that collectively own more
than one million shares, or a 13% stake.</p>
<p>Shares of Nichols Institute, which estimated that
third-quarter earnings could be 10% below analysts' highest
forecasts, tumbled 1 7/8 to 12 3/4.</p>
