	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The dollar rose against the Japanese yen
yesterday, shrugging off modest intervention by central banks
and a weekend statement of concern about the yen's weakness
from the major industrial nations.
   Most of the big action occurred in early Far Eastern
trading, where the dollar bounced like a yo-yo because of
differing interpretations of a Saturday communique from
finance ministers and central bank heads of the Group of
Seven countries. The dollar was mixed against other
currencies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The dollar initially jumped 1.3% to 159.65 yen in very
early New Zealand trading, on initial disappointment that the
communique wasn't more forceful in supporting Japan's
currency. Later in Tokyo, the dollar tumbled as low as 155.70
on Japanese newspaper reports that the G-7 would intervene
heavily to boost the sagging yen.</p>
<p>It didn't happen.</p>
<p>In late New York trading, the dollar wound up just 0.4%
ahead at 158.23 yen, compared with 157.65 yen late Friday.
The U.S. currency was marginally lower at 1.6935 West German
marks, compared with 1.6950 marks before the weekend. The
British pound fell to $1.6338 from $1.6425 on Friday.</p>
<p>Early Tuesday in Tokyo, the yen quickly gave up gains it
had made Monday in Tokyo, plus some. The dollar was trading
at 158.08 yen at midmorning, down slightly from the New York
close but up sharply from the Monday close of 156.45 yen in
Tokyo and even higher than last Friday's close of 156.47 yen.
Monday's optimistic expectations of coordinated central bank
intervention were gone by the market's opening because such
action failed to materialize overnight, and Tokyo traders
were much more cautious.</p>
<p>Following a one-day meeting in Paris, representatives of
the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and
Canada said that the yen's recent decline against the dollar
and European currencies has "undesirable consequences." The
G-7 also reaffirmed their commitment to economic policy
coordination, including "cooperation in exchange markets."</p>
<p>The G-7, however, failed to agree on a Japanese request
for a coordinated interest-rate package to support the yen.
This package would have included lower U.S. and West German
rates, steps that theoretically would reduce the allure of
the dollar, the mark and other European currencies tied to
the mark.</p>
<p>The Bank of Japan did sell dollars for yen, and the
intervention was followed later in the day by the central
banks of Britain, West Germany, France and Switzerland and
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Currency traders
weren't especially impressed.</p>
<p>They said the sales -- including those by the Bank of
Japan -- were small, looking more like a sign of central-bank
solidarity and an attempt to smooth markets than a campaign
to push up the yen.</p>
<p>Dealers estimated the combined intervention at a few
hundred million dollars, and the Bank of Japan's dollar sales
at less than $200 million. That's one-fifth of the estimated
$1 billion a day that Japan had been throwing at the rising
dollar in past weeks.</p>
<p>Several dealers speculated that Western central banks may
have been acting primarily on behalf of the Japanese central
bank. "The odds are better than 50-50 that it was Bank of
Japan money," said James T. McGroarty, a senior vice
president at Greenwich Capital Inc., a Greenwich, Conn., unit
of the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, he said the G-7 communique shouldn't be read
as negatively as it has been by many traders. "The joint
statement does mean that {the G-7 countries} are concerned,"
said Mr. McGroarty. "It doesn't necessarily mean they want
the dollar at 130 {yen}, but they are concerned about the
yen's level and its potential to unsettle world-wide
financial markets." Thus, he believes the dollar could
decline to about 153 yen.</p>
<p>Richard Witten, head of foreign exchange trading at
Goldman, Sachs & Co., isn't so sanguine. "It seems that all
the references to Japan and the yen were strained and the
product of strained negotiations," he said of the joint
statement. "So on its face, reading the communique -- in
contrast to other communiques -- shows there is less
agreement that markets are incorrectly pricing currencies.
And there is less will expressed to make a change in the
currency markets."</p>
<p>Since mid-February, the dollar has risen 10% against its
Japanese counterpart. Behind the weak yen are a combination
of factors, including the recent plunges in Japanese share
prices, increased capital flows from Japan to foreign markets
and bickering between the Japan's Ministry of Finance and
Bank of Japan over whether to raise interest rates.</p>
<p>Confidence in Japan's currency and its monetary
authorities also has been eroded as U.S. officials several
times rebuffed Tokyo's requests for aid in supporting their
currency.</p>
<p>Despite the threat that a weak yen poses for a wider U.S.
trade deficit, analysts believe the U.S. is more concerned
about domestic inflation. The yen's weakness is viewed
primarily as a Japanese problem. That same view appears to be
held by West German authorities. A strong dollar helps damp
inflationary pressures by reducing import prices, as well as
those charged by domestic companies that compete with
imports.</p>
<p>Even so, traders don't expect the yen to fall much
farther.</p>
<p>After perhaps drifting for a couple of weeks, "the dollar
will resume its upward path to the low 160 {yen area}," said
Mr. Witten of Goldman Sachs. "Most of the upward movement in
the dollar has happened already; there's more, but not a heck
of a lot more."</p>
<p>Yoichi Sakaguchi, chief trader at Sanwa Bank Ltd. in New
York, said that "people are buying dollars but very
cautiously," because they remain fearful of central bank
intervention.</p>
<p>He added that although many U.S. banks are focusing on the
U.S. currency's positive aspects, "Japanese investor attitude
is changing toward the dollar from bullish to cautiously
bullish or flat."</p>
<p>Mr. Sakaguchi said that since the April 1 start of the new
Japanese fiscal year, "we expected a lot of Japanese interest
in buying dollars. But it hasn't occurred, at least so far."</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery dropped $4.70 to $376 an ounce. Estimated volume was
a moderate 3.2 million ounces.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong, gold opened Tuesday at $376.69 an ounce.</p>
