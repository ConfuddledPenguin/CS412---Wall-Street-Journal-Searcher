	<p class="article-leader">Outboard Marine Corp., citing softening demand
"industrywide," said it expects to post a loss of as much as
$5 million for its second quarter, ended March 31, on sharply
lower sales.
   The Waukegan, Ill., maker of marine engines and
recreational power boats said it anticipates a loss of from
$1 million to $5 million, or five cents to 25 cents a share,
on sales "as much as 25% below" the year-ago period's $403
million in sales from continuing operations. Net from
continuing operations in the year-earlier period was $9.2
million, or 47 cents a share, Outboard Marine said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the year-ago second quarter, the company had net income
of $11.9 million, or 62 cents a share, on sales of $474.9
million. Those figures included results from Outboard's
Lawn-Boy and Cushman operations, both of which it sold in the
latter part of 1989.</p>
