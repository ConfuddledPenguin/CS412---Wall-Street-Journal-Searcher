	<p class="article-leader">Augusta, Ga. -- It was deja vu all over again at the
Masters golf tournament Sunday. Nick Faldo, the
matter-of-fact Britisher, rallied to win on the second extra
hole of a sudden-death playoff, just like he did last year.
Also like last year, a Yank had the winner's green jacket
almost on his shoulders, only to let it slip off. Darn
polyester has a way of doing that.
   Yeah, there were differences. The weather was terrible
last year and perfectly gorgeous this year. Last year's
victim was youngster Scott Hoch, who missed a short putt on
the first extra hole to allow Faldo's eventual winning putt,
while this time it was 47-year-old Ray Floyd, who had given
hope to an athletically disadvantaged group -- the
middle-aged -- before plunking a seven-iron shot into the
pond in front of the green on the finale, the par-four,
455-yard 11th.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Faldo said that remembrances of things past were much with
him at playoff time. "I hit into the same bunker on 10 {the
first extra hole} that I did last time, and once again saved
with a par. On 11, I recalled last year and thought, `Maybe
this will be my hole again.' And it was."</p>
<p>Floyd, the 1976 winner, began the day two shots up on
Masters rookie John Huston and three up on Faldo. He led the
tall, 32-year-old native of Surrey, England, by four shots
with just six holes to go, but gave in to gloomier thoughts
once the outcome was clear. "It was devastating. I never felt
like that before, ever," he said. "At this stage in my
career, I have to wonder how many more chances I'll have."</p>
<p>This was the third Masters in four years to go to a
playoff, and the third straight to be won by a Brit, Scotsman
Sandy Lyle having prevailed in 1988. Faldo's repeat victory
was only the second in the tournament's history, following
Jack Nicklaus's in 1965 and '66.</p>
<p>Faldo now has collected three firsts in golf's "majors" --
the other being the 1987 British Open at Muirfield in
Scotland -- and while post-tourney talk about him being the
sport's new No. 1 was inconclusive, he got what sounded like
a vote from Nicklaus, an ex-rex. "He hits the ball at the
flag every shot, and he's always straight -- always right
there. That's tough to beat," said Jack, a sixth-place
finisher Sunday.</p>
<p>The champ himself had a few remarks on the subject. "They
say you have to grind it out in the majors, but I don't think
that's the right word," said he. "You have to be patient,
keep playing, keep trying to do something right. And it's
blooming nerve-wracking, you know. Lucky there's {drinking}
water on every hole."</p>
<p>As Masters go, this was a good one on a number of grounds.
Augusta National's crowds are made up mostly of middle-aged
or early-elderly longtime ticket holders who cherish the
familiar. The tourney delivered plenty of that, with four
former titlists (Nicklaus, Floyd, Faldo and German Bernhard
Langer) among the six players who began the final day in
contention.</p>
<p>The galleryites love a mano-a-mano, and they had it in
Faldo and Floyd, whose 72-hole scores of 278, 10 under par,
were five strokes better than anyone else's. They love a late
charge, and Faldo provided it with his three birdies on the
last six holes that forced overtime.</p>
<p>If the fans could have voted, the 50-year-old Nicklaus,
whose record six green jackets are enough to open a
haberdashery, would have won, and the weathered Floyd, from
nearby North Carolina (Go Tarheels]), in his 26th visit here,
would have been second. But even so, their showings cheered
the long-in-tooth.</p>
<p>"No reason someone over 50 couldn't win a major if he
keeps himself in shape," asserted muscular Gary Player, 54, a
three-time former champ here whose 291 was good for 24th
place. Noted Floyd on Saturday night after his second
straight 68 gave him the third-round lead: "We {golfers}
don't have to run, tackle or hit. Golf's much more of a
mental game."</p>
<p>Ironically, Floyd confessed after his Sunday round that a
mental factor -- his approach toward having a large lead --
contributed to his failure to become the event's oldest
winner. "When nobody ran at me early today, that dictated
play, because I started playing for pars," he said. "On the
{par-five} 13th and 15th holes, I didn't go for the greens on
two like I might have. I don't know if I did it purposely --
it's a natural thing to do in the situation. But I did it,
and it cost me."</p>
<p>Floyd's last-day score of 72 was even par, but not dull.
He took a Cook's Tour of the course, visiting trees, traps
and other out-of-the-way places. His short game -- his forte
all week -- kept him competitive. He one-putted six times,
five for pars, and might have won if a birdie putt from the
fringe on the 405-yard 14th hadn't hit playing-partner
Huston's ball marker and veered away. Floyd's sole three-putt
green came after a pulled nine-iron left him 50 rollercoaster
feet from the pin on 17, and it cost him his lead.</p>
<p>Faldo was even-par through 12 holes, at which point his
deficit had grown to four. But he said a par three he made on
that hole from a difficult sandtrap lie started his rally. He
birdied 13 and 15, which Floyd cautiously parred behind him,
and the par-three 16th on an uphill putt he guessed was 12
feet long but looked more like 20. Pars on 17 and 18 gave him
a 69 for the day.</p>
<p>Floyd hit a lovely iron shot to 15 feet of the flag on the
first extra hole. He putted for the tourney but came up
short. Then came his pulled seven-iron shot on 11. "My first
thought was, `Don't go follow him in {the water},'" Faldo
said. "But once I hit mine, I knew I had it."</p>
<p>Huston, a 28-year-old Floridian, qualified for the Masters
by winning his first tour event last month. He dropped six
strokes to par through 10 holes Sunday, but birdied 15, 16
and 17 to finish third at 283.</p>
<p>Nicklaus began the day five back and wound up seven in
arrears. Still, he said his back felt good for the first time
in years, and was peppy even in defeat. "Can't hang around;
got to get ready for the next seniors event," said the man
who once denigrated that form. But he sounded like he had
other, grander goals. Again.</p>
