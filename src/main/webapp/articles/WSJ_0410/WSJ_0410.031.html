	<p class="article-leader">New York -- For years the odds of catching Donald Fagen in
concert looked only slightly better than those on the Berlin
Wall falling. Steely Dan, the pop vehicle he piloted with
Walter Becker, had released the last of its sophisticated pop
albums back in 1980. And some time before that the pair had
abandoned both touring and the pretense of bandhood, using
Steely Dan as the banner under which a loose confederation of
studio musicians could record.
   But there it was a few weeks ago in the Sunday paper -- an
ad for something called the "New York Rock and Soul Revue."
Mr. Fagen's name appeared in fine print, sandwiched between
singers Patti Austin and Michael McDonald, with Phoebe Snow
as the chaser. This was one concert I wasn't going to miss --
even if I didn't know quite what to expect.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Neither did many of those who packed the Beacon Theatre
last week for what was billed as a one-time event (though
several of the participants may do a concert or two later
this year). Some were clearly hoping for a Steely Dan show --
they were the ones shouting, "Aja]" "Haitian Divorce]" and
the titles of other Dan favorites. Some were anticipating an
evening with the former Doobie Brother, like the guy who
bellowed, "We love you, Michael]" But when the red lights
finally illuminated the stage, to the accompaniment of a
tenor sax, neither Fagen nor McDonald was on it. Instead
there were three horns, four singers, and a band of studio
musicians called Curious George, and they were driving
full-throttle into Isaac Hayes's "You Got Me Hummin'."</p>
<p>It wasn't until the third number that the headliners made
their entrance. Mr. McDonald, his prematurely silver locks
giving him the look of Kenny Rogers' younger, thinner
brother, sat down at the Rhodes piano stage right. Mr. Fagen,
in suit and horn-rims, crossed to the grand piano stage left.
And Ms. Snow, wearing the broad grin of somebody who's right
where she belongs, planted herself center-stage and launched
into "Knock on Wood."</p>
<p>Growling, gritty, the voice was a revelation to anyone
acquainted only with the jingle queen of the past few years
or the folky chanteuse of her first and biggest hit, "Poetry
Man." As she soared and swooped through the blues -- and her
four-octave range -- putting even Mr. McDonald's duetting
tenor in the shade, you couldn't help wondering what
monumental screwups had kept this talent from making a record
for eight years. And whether there wasn't some producer out
there who could match Ms. Snow with worthy material.</p>
<p>The cheers had just about died down when the rhythmic
figure opening "Black Friday," the first Steely Dan song of
the evening, got the crowd yelping all over again. (The
number dated from Mr. McDonald's brief pre-Doobies stint with
the ensemble in the mid-70s.) At first Mr. Fagen's voice
sounded too forced, compared with its hipster-cool ease on
the recordings. But things improved as the aptly named
guitarist Drew Zing stepped in, wisely playing his own lines
instead of echoing Larry Carlton's stinging lead breaks on
the original. Next came "I'm Sorry," and no one, not Patti
Austin, who gave the song a smoothly swinging reading, nor
Mr. Fagen, who provided sensitive piano accompaniment, had
anything to regret.</p>
<p>Then the spotlight swung to Mr. McDonald for "Minute by
Minute," one of his syncopated pop smashes. His singing was
every bit as soulful as expected. But what really made the
song special was the rich texture the musicians gave it --
now with bright brass lines, next a swell of background
harmony, then Mr. McDonald's keyboards playing off Mr. Zing's
fluid guitar. Through the number -- as throughout the concert
-- there was always the understated musicianship to listen
to, instead of just a series of star turns. The intelligent
playing made even a standard like "Que Sera, Sera" sound
fresh -- Ms. Austin led a full-throated gospel version over
Mr. Fagen's rolling jazz piano -- in a way that's all too
rarely encountered in pop.</p>
<p>And in true revue spirit many of the unfamiliar faces were
given a chance to shine. Jeff Young, Curious George's
keyboard player and singer, got the second half off to a
rousing start with his "Man Smart," a syncopated vamp in
Little Feat's footsteps. Pure-voiced Phillip Hamilton joined
deep-throat Sam Butler for some stellar harmonizing on
"Soothe Me." Mindy Jostyn blew a mean harmonica.</p>
<p>It would be hard to single out a high point in this
evening that went from strength to strength, though a
sentimental favorite would have to be Messrs. Fagen and
McDonald reteaming on the Dan classic "Pretzel Logic" --
flying in the face of the song's lyric, "Those days are gone
forever, over a long time ago . . ." About the only tune I
could have done without was Ms. Snow's "Poetry Man," a
security blanket it's time for her to let go of. But she
quickly redeemed herself with wrenching versions of the blues
"Shaky Ground" and "At Last."</p>
<p>For the big finale, "In the Midnight Hour," Austin and
Snow shared the stage at last, looking like twins down to
their identical close-cropped curls. The pair swayed and
tried not to step on each other's toes, musically or
literally, as the song turned into a vocal pepper game,
Austin to McDonald to Snow to Jeff Young and back again. As
Mr. Fagen bobbed behind the piano and the band played on, it
was one of those evenings nobody wanted to end.</p>
