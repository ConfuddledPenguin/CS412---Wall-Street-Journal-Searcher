	<p class="article-leader">Over-the-counter stocks barely budged in light trading as
some investors headed home early to begin celebrating
Passover and others prepared for a day off on Good Friday.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index of OTC stocks edged down just
0.72, or 0.17%, to close at 430.18. Heavy trading in MCI
Communications, which fell 1 1/8 to 35 3/4 after announcing
it would pay $42 a share, or $1.25 billion, for long-distance
carrier Telecom USA, helped flatten the index.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Trading is expected to be light all week because of the
two religious holidays. "I expect a quiet week and don't see
any big swings," said Peter DaPuzzo, head of OTC trading for
Shearson Lehman Hutton. "As traders, we'll provide our normal
liquidity, but I don't expect people to be aggressive or go
out on a limb on a week like this."</p>
<p>OTC indexes are market weighted, magnifying the effect of
MCI's drop on the overall market. The New York Stock Exchange
composite index closed about 0.3% higher.</p>
<p>OTC decliners led advancers 850 to 1,014. National Market
System volume fell to 84,575,100 shares, compared with
Friday's 102,138,400 shares. Trading in MCI accounted for
more than 3.4 million shares.</p>
<p>MCI's announcement sparked excitement in another regional
telecommunications concern, Advanced Telecommunications.
Shares of the Atlanta-based company jumped 24% in sympathy
with Telecom to close up 3 1/4 at 16 3/4, on about 586,000
shares, or 10 times normal volume.</p>
<p>Advanced Telecommunications is the nation's second largest
regional long-distance carrier, behind Telecom, in an
industry facing a "hot-bed" of consolidation, according to
analyst Mark Dunkel of Robinson-Humphrey Co.</p>
<p>Mr. Dunkel says that Advanced Telecommunications looks
particularly attractive in light of the nearly 100% premium
MCI will pay for Telecom, or a multiple of 26 times his
estimate of Telecom's 1990 earnings.</p>
<p>Before yesterday's gain, Advanced Telecommunications was
trading at just under 10 times Mr. Dunkel's estimated
earnings for the company of $1.40 a share for fiscal 1991,
ending in March. The company has a "very valuable" customer
base in Florida, Georgia and Texas and will be one to keep an
eye on amid continuing consolidation of regional long
distance carriers, Mr. Dunkel says.</p>
<p>Several stocks that recently took a beating rebounded in
robust trading. Among them were Novell, up 1 1/4 at 40, which
tumbled 4 1/8 Friday after Lotus Development agreed to
acquire the company for stock. Also recovering in brisk
trading was Oracle Systems, which rose 3/4 to 16. Both stocks
were "oversold" last week, but regained favor yesterday, said
Jerry Newman, a San Francisco-based institutional salesman
with Cowen & Co.</p>
<p>Also on the active list, 3Com, added 1/8 at 13 3/8 after
announcing that it will buy back up to one million common
shares, or about 3.5% of its outstanding common stock.</p>
<p>Michael Foods fell 1 1/4 to 13 7/8. Dain Bosworth lowered
its 1990 and 1991 earnings estimates for the company because
of its recently completed acquisition of the remaining 50% of
Milton G. Waldbaum Co. that it didn't previously own,
according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. Michael
Foods said it doesn't expect the acquisition to dilute
earnings.</p>
