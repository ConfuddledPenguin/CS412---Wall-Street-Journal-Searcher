	<p class="article-leader">General Development Corp., which filed for bankruptcy-law
protection Friday, said it closed its homesite-development
division, laying off its 239 workers.
   The cash-short Miami developer, which wasn't able to pay
more than $10 million in property taxes due April 1, said
"until we get our reorganization plan approved, we can't
spend any money on home-site construction." In recent months,
the company has laid off or fired approximately 1,600 other
workers, or more than one quarter of its work force.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>General Development's troubles stem from a grand-jury
investigation of its selling practices. Last month, the
company pleaded guilty to a federal charge of conspiracy to
defraud about 10,000 home buyers by charging inflated prices
based on improper appraisals. The company's former top two
executives also pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy.</p>
<p>Separately, citing the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing,
Moody's Investors Service lowered its ratings on about $275
million of the company's senior subordinated and subordinated
debt to Ca from Caa.</p>
