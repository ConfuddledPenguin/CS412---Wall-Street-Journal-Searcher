	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- Equimark Corp. said it expects to report a
first-quarter net loss of between $13.5 million and $15.5
million, or $1.21 a share and $1.38 a share.
   In the year-earlier quarter, Equimark earned $5.7 million,
or 50 cents a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Separately, Equimark said it agreed to sell most of its
credit-card receivables to Banc One Corp. in Columbus, Ohio.
Terms weren't disclosed. The sale includes about $350 million
in Equimark accounts. Equimark will keep about $113 million
in noncredit-card revolving credit receivables.</p>
<p>Equimark indicated in January that it would sell the
credit-card business because consolidation in that industry
makes it increasingly difficult for smaller credit-card
issuers to compete.</p>
<p>The diversified financial services company has been
selling certain assets to help finance its federally assisted
acquisition of ailing National Bancshares of Texas, based in
San Antonio.</p>
<p>For the latest quarter, Equimark's projected loss is due
to a "significant increase" in the company's provision for
possible loan losses and to losses related to the sale or
write-down of certain nonperforming real estate.</p>
<p>Equimark said its reserve for possible loan losses at
March 31 is projected to be about $6 million higher than the
year-end 1989 balance of about $42 million. The loan loss
reserve is also projected to cover about 75% of the total
nonearning assets at the end of the quarter, as compared with
63% at the end of 1989.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Equimark closed at $9.375, unchanged.</p>
