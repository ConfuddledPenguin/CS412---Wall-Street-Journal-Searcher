	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- Lotus Development Corp. and Novell Inc.,
which previously announced plans to merge, said they intend
to combine customer-service operations with that of
WordPerfect Inc., a closely held firm based in Orem, Utah,
that dominates the market for word-processing software.
   The move is further evidence that Lotus and Novell intend
to compete aggressively against Microsoft Inc., generally
viewed as the most influential software supplier in the
computer industry.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Jim Manzi, Lotus chief executive officer, said the joint
service operation makes sense because each of the three firms
share many customers. "Wouldn't it be wonderful if a customer
gets to call one place and gets an answer to their question,"
Mr. Manzi said.</p>
<p>Lotus already exchanges technology with WordPerfect, but
Mr. Manzi said WordPerfect isn't interested in merging with
Lotus and Novell.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Lotus and Novell say cooperating with
WordPerfect will benefit them. The trio of companies "are now
in a position where they can help guide the {personal
computer} industry," said Raymond Noorda, Novell chief
executive.</p>
<p>Mr. Manzi predicted that the deal between Lotus and
Novell, which would give the combined company greater revenue
than that at Microsoft, should be completed in 90 days. He
said he expects shareholders of both companies to vote on the
proposed deal in early July.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Corrections & Amplifications</p>
<p>LOTUS DEVELOPMENT Corp., Novell Inc. and WordPerfect Inc.
will assist one another in answering questions from
customers, but the service operations of each software
company will remain independent. In last Tuesday's edition
such efforts were described incorrectly.</p>
