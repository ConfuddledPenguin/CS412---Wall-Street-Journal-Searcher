	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- In the latest step bringing cable operators and
broadcasters closer together, Turner Broadcasting System Inc.
and Tribune Broadcasting Co. entered into a 10-year pact to
produce and share both news and entertainment programming.
   While the cable and broadcasting industries traditionally
are adversaries, the two sides increasingly are cooperating
in order to improve programming and cut costs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Turner-Tribune pact provides for the two companies to
collaborate on news, documentaries, specials and original
long-form productions, including two miniseries a year.
Financial terms of the agreement weren't disclosed.</p>
<p>The two companies said they plan to produce quarterly news
specials on a wide range of subjects, including environmental
issues, drugs and crime. "Hopefully, there will be an attempt
to provide stories with both local and national interest,"
said Russell Barry, president of Turner Program Services, the
world-wide distribution subsidiary of Turner Broadcasting.</p>
<p>The agreement also calls for all Tribune television
stations to become CNN television affiliates, in which both
companies will be able to share news services and stories.</p>
<p>The two miniseries, according to the agreement, would be
produced for Turner's TBS Superstation and the Tribune
stations, as well as for general domestic syndication. While
Turner previously has worked with independent producers in
developing entertainment programming, "This is the first time
we've worked with a station group," said Mr. Barry.</p>
<p>The venture isn't the first time that a cable company and
a broadcaster have joined forces. In late 1988, General
Electric Co.'s National Broadcasting Co. unit and Cablevision
Systems Corp. formed a joint venture to develop entertainment
programming and regional sports and news networks for cable.
NBC contributed its fledgling cable network, Consumer News
and Business Channel (CNBC), to the venture and provided
capital to Cablevision as well.</p>
<p>The cable industry and the broadcast industry are
adversaries on many issues -- in Washington, for example,
broadcasters are lobbying hard for re-regulation of the cable
industry. But increasingly, as cable reaches more households
and needs higher quality programming, both sides are finding
it advantageous to team up to produce and distribute
programming.</p>
<p>Tribune Broadcasting, a unit of Chicago-based Tribune Co.,
has used its own station group, the largest in the country,
to launch new programming. But the company also sells its
programs to other independent and network-affiliated or
network-owned stations and has also supplied programs to
cable networks, home video and international markets. Its
shows run the gamut from "U.S. Farm Report" to "Soul Train."</p>
<p>For its part, Turner held talks this year with both CBS
Inc. and NBC concerning possible joint news-gathering
operations. Neither set of talks, however, has yielded any
agreements.</p>
<p>The companies announced their joint venture after the
markets closed yesterday. In New York Stock Exchange
composite trading, Tribune Co. rose $1.875 to $43.50. In
American Stock Exchange composite trading, Turner's Class A
shares closed at $44.875, up 12.5 cents.</p>
