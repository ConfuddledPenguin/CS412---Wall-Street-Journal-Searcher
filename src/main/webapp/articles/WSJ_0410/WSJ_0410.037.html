	<p class="article-leader">It seems that if they want to find out more about Belgium,
Belgians ought to read The Wall Street Journal Europe.
   A week ago today, the government of Prime Minister
Wilfried Martens temporarily suspended King Baudouin's
constitutional powers after the latter refused to sign a law
legalizing abortion that had been voted on and approved by
the lower house of the Belgian Parliament. Before the law was
approved by the upper house last fall, The Wall Street
Journal Europe published an article in which I stated that
King Baudouin would not sign the abortion bill. This had been
confirmed to me by reliable sources.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A law in Belgium needs the approval of both houses of
Parliament and the king. The king never refuses to sign a
democratically approved text, but in this case he had
conscientious objections. King Baudouin is a Catholic with
close links to the charismatic renewal movement, and as such
he sees abortion as a form of murder. Furthermore, he and his
wife, Queen Fabiola, are childless and as a result care
deeply for children. "For many years we struggled to fathom
the meaning of this sorrow. But gradually we came to
understand that, having no children ourselves, we have more
room in our hearts for loving all, truly all children," the
king told the nation some years ago.</p>
<p>A refusal on the part of the king to sign a democratically
approved law might, however, have severe consequences for
Belgium's constitutional order. The king seems to have known
this, and was prepared to take the risk. "I would sooner
abdicate than legalize abortion," he said.</p>
<p>When, last October, I heard the news about the king's
objections I informed my newspaper's editor in chief. He is
the former spokesman of Prime Minister Martens, still belongs
to the prime minister's inner circle, and often uses the
newspaper as an instrument for the prime minister's Christian
Democratic Party. The Belgian Christian Democrats, although
they opposed the abortion law, were not prepared, for the
sake of their Socialist coalition partners, who favor
abortion, to risk a government crisis over the issue.</p>
<p>My editor in chief was not interested in the story. The
Wall Street Journal Europe, however, was. It ran my piece on
the king's position and the looming constitutional dispute in
Belgium in its Nov. 1 issue.</p>
<p>The Belgian newspapers made no mention of the king's
stand. They apparently considered the position of the Belgian
head of state to be something the Belgians should not be
informed of. The Christian newspapers all wanted to keep the
news down, as they all have close links to the Christian
Democratic Party. The Socialist and liberal newspapers did
not like the news, as they favored the abortion legislation.
And Belgium has no neutral newspapers, free of political
partisanship. Which is why for many Belgians the news of the
king's refusal to sign the law might have come as a surprise.</p>
<p>After the Journal ran my article, my editor in chief told
me I could no longer write for foreign publications as a
journalist of his newspaper.</p>
<p>I did make one false prediction, however, in my article
for the Journal. I concluded that the king's refusal might
lead to a constitutional crisis. This did not happen. The
politicians just ignored the constitution. Mr. Martens simply
suspended the king's powers for two days and had the
government sign the abortion law instead. In order to do this
the government invoked Article 82 of the Belgian
constitution, which had been used during World War II when
the king was in the hands of the enemy -- the Nazis -- and
the government had taken over the king's powers. Apparently,
the government supposes that the king is in the hands of the
enemy again -- not the Nazis, but his own conscience.</p>

He was fired after this article appeared in The Wall Street
Journal Europe.</p>
