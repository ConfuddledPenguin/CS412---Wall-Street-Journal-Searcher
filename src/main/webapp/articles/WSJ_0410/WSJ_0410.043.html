	<p class="article-leader">Trade negotiators from Washington and Tokyo have completed
a pact that even Democratic Senate trade hardliner Max Baucus
of Montana has lauded. Among other things, the Japanese would
agree to loosen the restrictions on creating large retail
outlets, increase government public works spending,
deregulate the nation's distribution system and stiffen
antitrust enforcement.
   The Japanese concessions, which would benefit European
Community traders as well as the two principal nations, is a
continuation of Japanese efforts to lighten up on its
economy. The bureaucratic elites at MITI made a show of
noting the limitations of the agreement, and some U.S.
interests spoke of the need for "monitoring" and
"enforcement" procedures, evoking the world of nuclear
first-strikes and arms-control treaties. At the more sensible
level of the voting public, though, there is strong evidence
that what Americans and Japanese want most is to receive the
full benefits of a free trading system.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Japanese electorate has demonstrated a desire for an
open economy that more clearly favors consumers. Overall,
Japanese imports shot up 40% between 1985 and 1988. The
Japanese current account surplus between April 1989 and
January 1990 was down 36.8% from a year earlier. This past
weekend's agreement comes on the heels of Japanese
concessions on the import of supercomputers and satellites.</p>
<p>Those who want to claim that the recent concessions are a
victory for the Super 301 bludgeon should remember that none
of the other nations named as part of the act have been as
forthcoming. The Japanese have demonstrated how much they
want good relations with the U.S., so much in fact that the
leaders of the Liberal Democratic Party were willing to set
aside their power squabbles to unify behind this deal.</p>
<p>But as the trade agreements go to the politicians in the
respective legislatures, this progress could be undone. Some
congressional Democrats have apparently decided that the
party can establish its macho credentials by being Ramboesque
on trade.</p>
<p>If the coming months see a revival of congressional
Japan-bashing in the United States, the Japanese may decide
that concessions don't produce long-term improvements in
relations. They'll conclude, correctly, that Japan-bashing by
U.S. politicians exists mainly to serve domestic political
needs and is unconnected to Japanese behavior. More bashing
or more Super 301 activity would strengthen protectionists in
the Japanese Diet. Japan has its own domestic politics, where
for instance the operators of mom-and-pop stores oppose
opening the kinds of large department stores that will
provide Japanese consumers the imported goods they've been
calling for.</p>
<p>More than domestic demagoguery threatens the accord. In
the past, U.S. protectionists have been mesmerized by the
trade deficit figures. It seems silly, but it is an article
of faith among many protectionists that any trade surplus is
proof of unfair trade barriers. Congressional leaders have
already declared that this pact will be deemed a failure if
the trade figures worsen in coming months. The figures have
dropped from their highs, mainly because of lessened U.S.
demand. But in the course of normal fluctuations in U.S.
consumption, they could widen again, through no fault of the
Japanese.</p>
<p>For their part, U.S. negotiators made concessions in
several broad or vague areas, such as the savings rate,
budget deficit and the quality of U.S. education. Of these,
getting the education system back on track would probably
make the strongest contribution to ensuring the
competitiveness of U.S. exporters.</p>
<p>For now, the important goal is to avoid letting relations
between the U.S. and Japan deteriorate over trade frictions.
With the post-Cold War world evolving and with the political
economy of Europe being transformed daily, this is hardly the
time for the U.S. and Japan to go off in a corner for a round
of trade retaliation. The weekend's agreement suggests that
these two important governments are trying to stay out of
that corner and remain in the business of building a new
world order.</p>
