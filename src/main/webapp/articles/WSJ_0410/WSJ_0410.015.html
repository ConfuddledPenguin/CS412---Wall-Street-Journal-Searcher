	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- CBS Inc. canceled "The Pat Sajak Show," its
first full-throttle effort into the lucrative late-night
arena in two decades. The talk show's failure is a major
disappointment for CBS's television network, which will
finish third in prime-time ratings for the third consecutive
year.
   Last year, the three major networks earned combined
advertising revenue of more than $430 million in the
late-night period, which begins at 11:30 p.m.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The cancellation of the show, after 14 months of bad
ratings, was expected. Mr. Sajak, the show's host -- who was
called affable, yet dull by TV critics -- won't be out of
work; he recently renewed his contract to continue as the
host of "Wheel of Fortune," the No. 1-rated game show
produced by King World Productions.</p>
<p>CBS is working on various late-night projects, including
two 15-minute shows being developed by Norman Lear, the
producer behind such past CBS hits as "All in the Family,"
"Maude" and "One Day at a Time." But it has the daunting task
of coming up with at least two hours of new programming for
the period beginning at 11:30 p.m. And CBS faces the
unenviable chore of once again trying to persuade its
200-plus stations to broadcast a network-supplied show.</p>
<p>Currently, CBS programs one-hour action/adventure shows,
such as "The Prisoner," after the Sajak show. But the network
wanted to program youth-oriented, comedy-oriented shows at
12:30 p.m. to run opposite "Late Night with David Letterman"
on NBC. Rod Perth, vice president of late-night programming,
said the network is developing other shows. Also, Michael
Wiseman, executive producer of the Sajak show, will remain
with CBS's late-night development planning.</p>
<p>For the time being, some affiliates said that they
wouldn't air shows offered by CBS until the network announces
its plans for next fall. "I have my own reruns of old network
shows," said Cullie M. Tarleton, senior vice president of
WBTV, the CBS affiliate in Charlotte, N.C. "I'll program that
time period myself and keep all the advertising revenue,
instead of splitting it with the network."</p>
<p>Mr. Sajak's final CBS broadcast was last Thursday and
substitute hosts will be used until the final show on Friday.
A CBS spokeswoman said that beginning next week, the network
will program reruns of shows, such as "Wiseguy," until its
new plans are finalized.</p>
<p>Mr. Sajak was out of the country yesterday and couldn't be
reached for comment.</p>
<p>The show also competed against "The Arsenio Hall Show,"
which critics considered far hipper and which is sold
directly to TV stations by Paramount Television, a unit of
Paramount Communications Inc.</p>
<p>Since the Sajak show premiered in January 1989, it
underwent numerous changes. CBS cut it to one hour from 90
minutes and altered its format so it would look less like a
clone of "The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson" on NBC, a
unit of General Electric Co.</p>
<p>But none of the changes helped. Last week, the show was
viewed by only 2.3% of the available audience, compared with
5.9% tuned to Mr. Carson, according to the A.C. Nielsen Co.</p>
<p>CBS had hoped that Mr. Sajak, whose two-year contract
expires this summer, would be an alternative to Mr. Carson.
The network built a state-of-the-art studio for the show at
Television City, the network's Los Angeles-based
headquarters, for about $4.5 million.</p>
<p>Mr. Sajak was brought to CBS by Michael Brockman, who was
in charge of its late-night programming. Mr. Brockman left
about two months after Mr. Sajak began, to join Capital
Cities/ABC Inc.'s TV network as president of daytime,
children and late-night programming.</p>
<p>"The cancellation is not surprising," Mr. Brockman said.
"But the show did not become what we had planned. It was
never supposed to be a clone of `The Tonight Show.'" Mr.
Brockman noted that ABC is poised to launch "Into the Night
Starring Rick Dees" on July 16 and "I don't want to give away
any secrets that I may have taken with me from CBS on how the
{Sajak} show should've been done."</p>
<p>The ABC project, a comedy/variety show with Mr. Dees, a
Los Angeles disk jockey, is the latest effort to develop a
companion show to follow ABC News's "Nightline."</p>
<p>Jack Sander, president of WAGA, the CBS affiliate in
Atlanta, which didn't broadcast Mr. Sajak's show, said the
network must come up with programming that affiliates would
want to broadcast. "For a network to be a full-service
network," he said, "it must have shows in all parts of the
day."</p>
