	<p class="article-leader">BATTLE CREEK, Mich. -- Kellogg Co. soon will introduce its
first presweetened cereal for kids in 15 years, a four-grain
flaked product called Bigg Mixx.
   The ready-to-eat product includes rolled oats, rice,
toasted corn flakes and whole-grain wheat, flavored with
brown sugar and cinnamon. One variety also comes with
raisins.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Most of Bigg Mixx's $22 million rollout budget will focus
on a fanciful creature -- part chicken, wolf, moose and pig
-- that will speak for the product. The character, named for
the cereal, joins Tony the Tiger and Toucan Sam in Kellogg's
marketing menagerie.</p>
<p>The last successful presweetened item from the world's
largest maker of ready-to-eat cereals was Frosted Krispies, a
1975 rollout.</p>
<p>Kellogg's hopes for a new hit with kids and their parents
last year was S.W. Graham, a graham-flour cereal with a
nostalgia advertising campaign. But when initial sales didn't
meet expectations, the company quietly took it off the
market.</p>
