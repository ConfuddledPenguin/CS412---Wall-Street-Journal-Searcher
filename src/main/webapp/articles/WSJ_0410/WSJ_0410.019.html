	<p class="article-leader">I respond to Larry Wallberg's March 13 Leisure & Arts
article, "No Oreos Allowed: A Yank `Takes Tea' in London,"
with a modest report of an experience I had in London the
other year.
   My British wife (Welsh from a little South Wales valley
mining town) and I were visiting with a girlhood chum of hers
who lives and works (as a teacher of French) in London. After
spending time in the Victoria and Albert, we ended up sitting
in the lobby of the Hotel Rembrandt across Cromwell Road. As
it was tea time we were hoping for some refreshment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The ladies were reminiscing briskly about bygone school
days. Time passed, but no one came to tend to us. Finally, I
excused myself and walked over to the bar in the corner,
where I asked the bartender, in my American accent, if
someone could please help us.</p>
<p>"Certainly, sir, I'll be right over," was the response.
And when he reached our table he rubbed his hands together
and said, in that unctuous manner adopted by serving people
the world over when they think they have an unsuspecting
tourist, "May I bring you proper English tea."</p>
<p>"I'm Welsh, and I'll have coffee]" was the response from
one lady. And from the other, "I'm also Welsh, and I'll have
coffee, too."</p>
<p>The poor fellow was positively undone.</p>
<p>Oh, by the way, I had a pot of tea and a scone.</p>

<p>I would like to thank Mr. Wallberg for making such a good
impression on his host country. When you consider that he
"lives and writes in New York City," it is sad to think that
he never ventured to the Hotel Pierre or the Helmsley for
afternoon tea. Please, Mr. Wallberg, save your money
traveling across the Atlantic -- you can make a fool of
yourself right here at home. With unofficial American
ambassadors like yourself, we will soon be restricted from
the finer hotels abroad.</p>
