	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- A French diamond-exploration company has filed a
$195 million lawsuit against Sunshine Mining Corp., alleging
breach of contract and failure to perform duties associated
with a joint venture in a diamond mining project in Sierra
Leone.
   The Boulle Group, a partnership based in Troyes, France,
alleges that it began a relationship with the Sierra Leone
government in 1971 and developed a diamond-mining prospect
there. In 1989, the brothers Jean-Raymond and Franco Boulle
signed a joint venture agreement with Sunshine Mining, a
Dallas-based precious metals mining company, to develop the
project.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the lawsuit filed in federal court in Dallas, the
Boulles allege that Sunshine officials withheld information,
executed exclusive agreements and misappropriated funds in an
attempt to take the project for themselves, excluding the
Boulles. Sunshine also evicted the Boulles from the joint
venture offices in Dallas, the brothers allege.</p>
<p>The brothers attempted to work out the problems with
Sunshine to save the venture, said their attorney, Robert C.
Odle Jr. of Weil, Gotshal & Manges in Washington, D.C. But
when that attempt failed, they filed suit, asking the federal
court to either dissolve the disputed joint venture or enjoin
Sunshine from interfering in the project. The Boulles are
also asking for $65 million in actual damages and $130
million in exemplary damages.</p>
<p>The two parties are still partners in the Arkansas Diamond
Development Co., which has proposed a diamond exploration
project in southwestern Arkansas. That project has been
controversial because it would convert a publicly owned state
park to private use.</p>
<p>Several officials from Sunshine Mining weren't available
for comment, and others didn't return phone calls.</p>
