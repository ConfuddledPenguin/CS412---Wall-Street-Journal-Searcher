	<p class="article-leader">With proxy fights proliferating, takeover defense lawyer
Martin Lipton has a new idea for companies worried about
their directors being voted out of office: don't let
shareholders vote as often.
   Mr. Lipton, a partner at Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz,
suggests that directors ought to be elected to terms of five
years, instead of one or three, in what he calls a
"quinquennial system." Under his proposal, the annual meeting
would be eliminated, and shareholders would only meet every
five years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Currently, most companies either elect all their directors
annually, or have staggered boards, with one-third up for
election each year. Staggered boards came into widespread use
early in the 1980s as an anti-takeover defense.</p>
<p>"We need to strike a balance," Mr. Lipton said in a memo
to clients. "A balance that facilitates long-term planning by
corporations but does not entrench bad management." With such
a system, he added, "directors would run on the corporation's
record for the past five years and the corporation's
strategic plan for the next five years."</p>
<p>However, Mr. Lipton acknowledged the idea would require
changes in state laws, federal securities laws and stock
exchange rules.</p>
