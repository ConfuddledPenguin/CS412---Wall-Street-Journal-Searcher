	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The cosmetics industry is making little
effort to comply with the Food and Drug Administration's
voluntary regulations, the General Accounting Office said.
   According to a GAO report, fewer than 40% of cosmetics
manufacturers and packers have registered their plants with
the FDA, and fewer than 4% filed reports with the agency
about product-related injuries. Both figures are slightly
below those measured by GAO in 1978, when the congressional
watchdog agency last did such a study.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The FDA is authorized by law to oversee cosmetics, but its
power over the $18 billion-a-year industry is limited. It
doesn't have the authority to approve or disapprove new
cosmetics, as it does with drugs. Nor does it have the power
to require cosmetics companies to register products and
submit information on product-related injuries. Instead, the
FDA asks companies to submit this information voluntarily.</p>
<p>"People call up and say, `Why don't you do this? Why don't
you do that?'" says Dr. Heinz Eiermann, who heads the FDA's
cosmetics division. "All these questions are raised, which
are made on the assumption that we have all the authority to
get information or require manufacturers to do the testing,
which we don't have."</p>
<p>Each year, the FDA receives around 250 consumer complaints
about cosmetic products, most of them involving allergic
reactions.</p>
<p>The bulk of consumer complaints are made to the companies
themselves. Avon Products Inc., which sold 420 million units
of cosmetics in the U.S. last year, received 102 complaints
-- all allergic reactions. None of these were
life-threatening, and all were reported to the FDA, according
to a company spokesman.</p>
<p>The GAO found that many cosmetics manufacturers refuse to
disclose the results of safety tests to FDA inspectors. But
Michael Petrina, vice president for legislative relations at
the Cosmetic Toiletry and Fragrance Association, said he knew
of no instances where the industry had refused cooperation on
"serious safety questions." Mr. Petrina said cosmetics
companies are less cooperative when FDA inspectors on routine
inspections decide to go on a "fishing expedition."</p>
<p>Mr. Petrina cited a letter sent last year by former FDA
commissioner Frank Young praising the industry's willingness
to submit data on consumer hazards "of broad public concern."</p>
<p>Rep. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) disagrees. "This industry seems
to be unaccountable," says Rep. Wyden, who headed hearings on
cosmetics regulation in 1988 and commissioned the GAO report.
Rep. Wyden plans to submit legislation to require cosmetics
companies to register with the FDA and disclose safety tests
and injury reports.</p>
<p>Mr. Wyden also called for the FDA to review 884
potentially toxic ingredients found in cosmetics. According
to the GAO report, industry researchers see "no major safety
concerns" with any of them.</p>
