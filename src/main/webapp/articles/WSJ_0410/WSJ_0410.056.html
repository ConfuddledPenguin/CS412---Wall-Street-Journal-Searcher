	<p class="article-leader">Ames Department Stores Inc., hurt by the disastrous
results of the Zayre department stores it acquired in 1988,
said it plans to close 74 stores and expects to report a $228
million loss for the year ended Jan. 27.
   Ames, based in Rocky Hill., Conn., said it is negotiating
with its banks for a new credit agreement and has hired
investment advisers "to assist . . . with a restructuring
that will include a capital infusion."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Even though the troubled department-store chain had said
it would report a loss for the year, the amount estimated --
which is subject to a final audit -- was larger than
anticipated. The company has blamed disappointing sales at
its Zayre stores for its lackluster performance.</p>
<p>In fiscal 1989, Ames had net income of $47.2 million, or
$1.20 a share, on sales of $3.36 billion.</p>
<p>In heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday,
Ames shares recovered to close at $3.25, down 25 cents, after
falling sharply earlier in the day. The loss was disclosed
after the market closed.</p>
<p>Ames said the loss will include a charge of about $150
million to cover the costs of closing 74 unprofitable stores,
which would reduce the number of stores it operates to 606.
The company had posted a loss of $27.7 million, or 99 cents a
share, for the first nine months of the fiscal year,
indicating that its fourth-quarter loss will be about $200.3
million.</p>
<p>"The operating loss for the year resulted primarily from
substantially lower than anticipated sales and gross margins
in the former Zayre stores," said Peter Hollis, Ames's chief
executive officer. "The profitability of the original Ames
stores has been maintained."</p>
<p>When Ames paid $800 million for the 392-store Zayre chain
in November 1988, it had high expectations that it could turn
the chain around. The cut-price retailer, competing against
such chains as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and K mart Corp., had
been battling sagging sales for at least two years prior to
the sale.</p>
<p>Ames thought it could do a brisk business if it shed the
heavy discounting practice of the former Zayre chain and gave
Zayre a new "every-day low price" pitch. Ames closed 74 of
the chain's worst stores and spruced up the interior decor of
the remaining stores to set it apart from the often
disheveled image many Zayre stores presented. With new paint,
brighter lighting and quicker computerized cash registers,
the stores failed to woo new Zayre customers. The effort, in
part was impeded by a souring economy in the Northeast, where
much of Ames's business is done.</p>
<p>Still experimenting, Ames last year continued to spiff up
its stores, eliminated the Zayre name and rechristened all
the stores with the more upscale Ames name. Hope was that the
chain would turn the corner last holiday shopping season. To
boost financial results, Ames even opened its doors for
business on Thanksgiving Day. But the new tactic hasn't yet
worked.</p>
<p>Comparable-store sales for December at the remaining units
acquired from Zayre were down 13%. Sales at the rest of the
chain, however, increased 5%, the company said.</p>
<p>"We were trying to re-educate the Zayre customer but
weren't as successful as we had anticipated," said Douglas
Ewing, a company spokesman. Results of the fourth quarter and
the year have been disappointing to Ames. "The real picture
began to unfold as we examined our numbers {in recent
weeks}," said Mr. Ewing, "long after we had met with analysts
on Jan. 12." "The size of the loss was not known until
recently when we started getting details of the full fiscal
year. Performance came in well below expectation."</p>
<p>As recently as this month, most analysts had been
expecting Ames to report a loss of about $10 million for the
year following estimated profit of $12 million for the
quarter. Most weren't expecting a $150 million charge.</p>
<p>As for the future, Mr. Ewing expressed confidence that the
company would be able to negotiate a new credit agreement
with lending institutions later this month. He declined to
discuss details or comment on whether Ames was in violation
of current lending agreements.</p>
<p>Ames also said it has retained the investment banking
firms of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Wertheim Schroder &
Co. to help in a restructuring that will include "a capital
infusion." The company didn't elaborate.</p>
