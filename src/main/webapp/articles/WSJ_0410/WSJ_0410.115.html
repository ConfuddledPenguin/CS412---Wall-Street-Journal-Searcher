	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Fitch Investors Service, which has been
struggling to become a power in the credit-rating business,
stunned traders with a downgrade of securities backed by the
credit cards issued by Sears, Roebuck & Co.
   The downgrade startled the market because Sears is
considered one of the premier issuers in the $30 billion
credit-card securities market. The move marks the first time
a credit-card issue has been downgraded.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Fitch lowered its ratings on two Sears issues, Sears
Credit Account Trust Certificates 1988-C and 1989-A, to
double-A from triple-A. The action reflected Fitch's
downgrade of Sears, Roebuck & Co. to single-A from
double-A-minus, and concerns about the structure of the
credit-card deals.</p>
<p>But the two credit rating giants, Standard & Poor's Corp.
and Moody's Investors Service Inc., affirmed the triple-A
ratings on the more than $5 billion of Sears credit-card
deals. Duff & Phelps also maintains a triple-A rating on the
Sears issues.</p>
<p>Some dealers said the Fitch downgrade hasn't yet had much
impact on the market, in part because the agency still
doesn't carry as much clout as its larger rivals.</p>
<p>But the downgrade does raise question about the
"bullet-proof" status of some asset-backed securities
offerings. Fitch said one reason for its move was uncertainty
about whether asset-backed securities investors would be
fully protected if Sears Roebuck were ever forced into
bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
