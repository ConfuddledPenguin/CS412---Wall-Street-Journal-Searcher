	<p class="article-leader">STAMFORD, Conn. -- Savin Corp. expects to report a profit
for the first quarter, compared with a year-earlier loss, as
it began to benefit from placements of its Prism I color
copier, said E.P. van den Boogaard, the copier marketer's new
chairman.
   Savin also announced a long-term supply accord with
Colorocs Corp., which designs the Prism I. And the company
also is still accepting and counting votes from holders of
common shares on four proposals. Savin had asked its
shareholders to, among other things, give the company more
flexibility when paying dividends and to let the company
award certain options.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the first quarter, Savin estimates pretax earnings of
$400,000, compared with a year-ago loss of $1.1 million.
Savin declined to disclose the after-tax number, but Mr. van
den Boogaard said it would be printed in black ink. A
year-earlier, Savin had a loss of $930,000, or three cents a
share.</p>
<p>Savin estimated that revenue advanced 3.3% to $92 million
from $89 million. The first quarter is usually Savin's
weakest, said Mr. van den Boogaard, who took the top post
late last month.</p>
<p>Mr. van den Boogaard, 46 years old, also is president and
chief executive officer of HCS Technology N.V., an Amsterdam
distributor of facsimile machines, copiers, and computer
hardware and software. HCS recently boosted its voting stake
in Savin to 55% by buying the Savin holding of Colorocs Corp.
Mr. van den Boogaard took the chairman's post from Charles
Muench, president and chief executive of Colorocs.</p>
<p>At a special meeting last month, Savin presented eight
proposals to shareholders. Holders agreed to cut the par
value on the common and four classes of preferred stock; to
let Savin pay dividends on Series-A preferred in common
stock; to increase authorized Series-C shares; and to make
some changes in a stock-option plan.</p>
<p>The special meeting was postponed to March 29 and then to
April 20 to allow common-share holders to continue to vote on
proposals to let Savin pay Series-C dividends with more
Series-C; to grant certain stock options; to grant an option
on three million Series-C shares to HCS; and if this third
proposal fails, to grant to HCS as much as $10 million of
common or Series-C stock.</p>
<p>If HCS receives and exercises the option on the three
million Series-C shares, it would invest as much as $21
million in Savin, increasing its voting stake to 63%.</p>
<p>The votes that are coming in still largely favor the
proposals, Savin said, declining to provide specific numbers.
The company has said that the initial failure of the four
ballot measures, which require approval from two-thirds of
the common shares, stemmed from the difficulty of getting its
many holders to vote.</p>
