Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries totaled
24,090,000 barrels a day in March, up from 23,620,000 barrels
daily in February, according to estimates published by the
Cyprus-based oil industry newsletter Middle East Economic

recorded in December, and represents the highest monthly OPEC
production since 1981.</p>
