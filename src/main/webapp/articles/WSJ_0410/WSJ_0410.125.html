	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stocks closed mixed in one of the lightest
trading days of the year.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 4.95 points to
2722.07. Broader averages also gained: Standard & Poor's
500-stock index rose 1.29 to 341.37. But 839 issues declined
on the New York Stock Exchange while only 652 advanced. Big
Board volume totaled 114,970,000 shares, the second-lightest
trading day of the year. The lowest volume in 1990 so far
occurred March 12, when 114,790,000 shares changed hands.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The slow trading reflected in part the absence of many
investors because of Passover and Good Friday observances
this week, traders said. U.S. exchanges will be closed on
Friday for the latter.</p>
<p>But concerns about first-quarter earnings reports are also
keeping some investors away from stocks, said Eugene Takach,
fund manager at Eagle Investment Associates, a
money-management subsidiary of the First National Bank of
Boston.</p>
<p>Goodyear said yesterday it would report lower
first-quarter earnings and the stock slipped 1/2 to 35 3/4.
The company cited a drop in sales to auto makers, "severe
pricing competition" in both North America and Europe, and "a
sizable drop" in profit from Brazil.</p>
<p>Investors looking for a place to hide from bad earnings
reports bought shares of consumer-products and food
companies.</p>
<p>Quaker Oats gained 1 1/4 to 50 3/4. First Boston boosted
the stock's investment rating to "buy" from "hold." Elsewhere
in the food group, Hershey Foods rose 1 to 33 5/8, Kellogg
gained 1 1/2 to 63 5/8, CPC International added 1 1/8 to 70
7/8, and Ralston Purina rose 1 to 85 3/8.</p>
<p>Bank stocks formed another leading industry group. A Heard
on the Street column in yesterday's Wall Street Journal
suggested that many bank issues were oversold. Also, Charles
Peabody, senior bank analyst at Kidder Peabody, raised
investment ratings on several bank stocks yesterday, with buy
recommendations on J.P. Morgan, Mellon Bank, and Norwest
Corp.</p>
<p>"We decided {the bad news} was well washed out," said Mr.
Peabody. "A stronger economy in the second half of the year
should allow credit quality fears to recede and earnings
momentum to pick up."</p>
<p>Some investors remained cautious, however. "I think bank
stocks deserve a bounce, but we haven't heard all the bad
news yet," warned Richard Pike, bank analyst at Chancellor
Capital Management.</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan jumped 1 1/8 to 35 3/4, Mellon Bank gained 7/8
to 25, but Norwest slipped 1/4 to 18 3/8.</p>
<p>Citicorp rose 3/4 to 23 5/8 on volume of 1.5 million
shares, Chase Manhattan gained 1/2 to 28 1/8, and Chemical
Banking rose 3/8 to 23 1/4, Manufacturers Hanover climbed 5/8
to 31 5/8, and BankAmerica gained 7/8 to 26 3/8 on one
million shares.</p>
<p>Regional bank stocks followed suit.</p>
<p>Bank of New York climbed 1 to 31, First Fidelity Bancorp
advanced 1/2 to 19, NCNB rallied 3/4 to 36 1/8, and MNC
Financial rose 7/8 to 16 7/8.</p>
<p>Federal National Mortgage Association climbed 1 3/8 to 33
3/8 on 1.2 million shares and Federal Home Loan Mortgage
gained 1 3/8 to 66 5/8. The concerns about shaky real-estate
loans that spurred last week's selling in the banking sector
had also buffeted those issues.</p>
<p>PepsiCo climbed 1 1/2 to 66 1/2. The company extended its
reciprocal trade agreement with the Soviet Union through the
year 2000 and said it plans to boost its sales in the country
by upgrading and expanding its operations there.</p>
<p>Coca-Cola, Pepsi's principal rival, gained 1 3/8 to 79 1/4
to contribute to the advance in the industrial average. Other
consumer stocks that lifted the average included Philip
Morris, which went up 5/8 to 41 7/8; Merck, up 5/8 to 73 3/8,
and Procter & Gamble, up 1 1/8 to 69 3/4.</p>
<p>Household International fell 1 1/4 to 49 1/2 on
speculation that its first-quarter results would include a
write-off related to its commercial real-estate portfolio.
The company denied the rumors.</p>
<p>Telecom USA soared 16 1/4 to 38 1/8 as 3.6 million shares
were traded. MCI Communications agreed to acquire its
long-distance competitor for $42 a share, or about $1.25
billion. MCI eased 1 1/8 to 35 3/4 on the national
over-the-counter market.</p>
<p>Windmere, which won a $30 million judgment in an antitrust
case against N.V. Philips, added 1 to 8 1/8. Under antitrust
law, the damage award will automatically be tripled. Philips
slid 1/4 to 21 1/4.</p>
<p>UAL fell 2 1/2 to 161. In reiterating a sell
recommendation on the stock, Goldman Sachs analyst Glenn D.
Engel said the buy-out offer by the three main unions at
United Airlines doesn't have a high probability of succeeding
unless the unions can install "a proven management team" or
find a substantial equity partner, according to Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report.</p>
<p>MGM/UA Communications climbed 1 5/8 to 18 1/4 on news that
Time Warner's movie unit would arrange a $650 million bridge
loan for Pathe Communications' use in its $20-a-share
takeover offer for the company. Pathe gained 1/2 to 4 3/4;
Time Warner added 7/8 to 93 7/8.</p>
<p>Network Equipment Technologies plummeted 5 3/4 to 15 1/8.
After saying last week that earnings for the fiscal fourth
quarter ended in March could fall short of the year-earlier
33 cents a share, the company gave its specific forecast for
the latest period: about 10 cents a share. Also, the company
noted that shipments made in connection with an order found
to be invalid would depress its latest results.</p>
<p>Ames Department Stores fell 1/4 to 3 1/4 and traded as low
as 2 3/4, a 52-week low, as 4.1 million shares changed hands.
The company has delayed its earnings report for fiscal 1990
at least twice; analysts have said uncertainty tied to the
delays is behind the stock's fall.</p>
<p>De Soto dropped 1 1/8 to 43 1/8. Sutton Holdings, which is
offering $50 a share for the company, said a commitment from
Creditanstalt to provide $215 million in financing for its
tender offer expired over the weekend.</p>
<p>Amre fell 5/8 to 6 7/8. The company said a management
group that holds 56% of its common shares decided against
making a planned offer of $8.75 a share for the rest.</p>
<p>Tucson Electric Power slipped 3/4 to 13 after its
auditors, Deloitte & Touche, said in a letter to shareholders
that the company faces a number of contingent liabilities and
other uncertainties.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 1.33
to 359.68. Volume totaled 12,560,000 shares, compared with
15,060,000 shares Friday. There were 240 issues advancing,
330 declining and 247 were unchanged.</p>
<p>Frederick's of Hollywood gained 7/8 to 15 7/8. The company
reported net income of 54 cents a share for the fiscal second
quarter ended March 3, compared with 41 cents a share a year
earlier.</p>
