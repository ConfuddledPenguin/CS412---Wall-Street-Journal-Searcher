	<p class="article-leader">Centocor Inc. plans to report that its drug for treating
certain potentially fatal bacterial infections clearly
reduces mortality rates.
   According to a summary of a Centocor report to be made at
a scientific conference in May, the mortality rate fell 39%
when patients whose blood was infected with so-called
gram-negative bacteria were treated with the Centocor drug,
as against patients who receive a placebo. The summary calls
this reduction "highly significant" statistically.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Of 200 patients studied, 49% of those on the placebo died
within 28 days, while only 30% of those on the drug died.
Moreover, the summary says, the drug reduced mortality 42%
among those patients who had gone into septic shock.</p>
<p>The summary was prepared as a help for the press at the
May conference but made available by the journal Clinical
Research. The lead investigator, Elizabeth Ziegler of the
University of California at San Diego, and Centocor officials
said they hadn't intended that the summary should be released
so soon and declined to comment. Clinical Research today will
publish the official, more technical abstract of the report
to be made in May.</p>
<p>The summary, though sketchy on details, suggests how
Centocor, based in Malvern, Pa., hopes to answer a report by
rival Xoma Corp., issued last September. Like Centocor, Xoma,
based in Berkeley, Calif., is still seeking marketing
approval from the Food and Drug Administration for a drug to
treat gram-negative infections, which can follow abdominal
wounds, surgery and contamination of the catheters used in
hospitals.</p>
<p>Any information divulged by the two biotechnology
companies is intensely scrutinized by Wall Street because
their similar products could be the first big-selling drugs
made from monoclonal antibodies, or proteins like those the
body produces naturally to fight disease. Mark Simon, an
analyst at Robertson Stephens & Co., estimates that the U.S.
market for the drugs could total $350 million in 1993.</p>
<p>According to some estimates, 200,000 people in the U.S.
develop gram-negative infections each year, and some 80,000
people die from them. The infections today are treated mostly
with antibiotics.</p>
<p>The earlier report by Xoma indicated that its own drug,
for now called E5, also reduced mortality rates, but only
before patients entered what Xoma calls "severe refractory
shock," defined as sharply lower blood pressure and other
conditions. Yesterday, Patrick Scannon, Xoma's president,
noted that the summary of the Centocor study doesn't explain
how it defined shock -- a key part of the scientific debate.</p>
<p>Dr. Scannon also noted that the Centocor study, at least
as presented in the summary, looked only at patients whose
blood was infected. He said the Xoma study had looked also at
other types of infection by gram-negative bacteria and so
that study is difficult to compare with the Centocor study.</p>
