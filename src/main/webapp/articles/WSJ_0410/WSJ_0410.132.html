	<p class="article-leader">Most Americans would like to believe that rationality
underlies public policy. Given the seriousness of
homelessness, we might suppose that policy decisions are
based on an understanding of the issues.
   But this is not so, as a colleague, Marjorie Honig, and I
found in surveying the research on homelessness in the U.S.
Many assertions have gained credibility merely through
repetition, while basic issues regarding the causes of
homelessness have rarely been addressed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>What do we know, then, about homelessness in America?</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>How Big Is the Problem?</p>
<p>We have only a ballpark estimate of the number of people
currently living in public places or shelters (including
hotels). In 1984 the Department of Housing and Urban
Development estimated a homeless population of about 350,000,
a figure confirmed by several other studies. In every city
with an actual count, this count was equal to or less than
the HUD estimate for that city.</p>
<p>These numbers fall far short of the three million to four
million claimed by advocacy groups, which often expand the
definition to include those they call the "hidden homeless"
-- that is, those who do not have their own dwellings
(including people sharing housing with friends and
relatives). One group of congressmen has defined the homeless
as including everyone on a waiting list for any federally
assisted housing program. Such definitions are so imprecise
that they have little relevance for homeless policy and have
not found wide acceptance. Estimating the current number of
homeless requires combining the HUD figure for 1984 with an
assumption about growth rates since then, something we know
little about.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Are Things Getting Worse?</p>
<p>Although many believe homelessness has been increasing in
recent years, there is little evidence to support this
assertion. We know that more people are sleeping in shelters.
The number of shelters, however, has increased rapidly. Thus
we may be observing an increase in the total homeless
population, or a constant population may be more likely to
sleep in shelters. Reliable estimates of growth are available
for only one city, Nashville. Researchers at Vanderbilt
University have counted the homeless there every six months
for the past several years and found no increase in
homelessness. Replication of earlier counts elsewhere is
needed to determine what has happened in larger cities.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>What Do the Numbers Mean?</p>
<p>The number living in the streets or in shelters may mean
less than it appears. Many homeless (particularly families)
enter shelters directly from sharing housing with friends and
relatives. The importance of focusing on this group is to
remind us that the scope of the problem is ambiguous. Some of
the poor who currently make other housing arrangements may
become homeless in the future. Furthermore, the more generous
the programs for the homeless are, the greater this number
will be as people respond to the incentives created.</p>
<p>We do not know how the behavior of the potential homeless
will differ if either the economy or public policies change,
since we know little about the alternative arrangements of
the near-homeless -- including the conditions in which they
are living. We also do not know how many of those now in
shelters would be thrown into the streets, as opposed to
being taken in by their families and friends, if there were
no shelters. Ultimately, the homeless problem is difficult to
distinguish from the problem of the very poor in general.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Who Are the Homeless?</p>
<p>We know a great deal about who is homeless. The bulk
(between 60% and 80%) are single men. Most suffer from one or
more pathologies, especially mental illness and substance
abuse. The widely cited figure that a third of the homeless
are mentally ill is roughly the percentage who claim prior
treatment in a mental hospital. This is undoubtedly a lower
bound on the extent of mental illness among the homeless. Our
knowledge of the current mental health of the homeless is
hampered by the wide range of definitions used and the fact
that few studies involved professional diagnoses. Those that
did use such diagnoses show rates of mental illness
substantially greater than one-third.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best data come from a 1989 study of adult
homeless people (most of whom were single) in Baltimore
conducted by clinicians from Johns Hopkins University. In
this study, 42% of the men and 49% of the women were found to
suffer from "major mental illness (including schizophrenia
and dementia)." An additional 30% of the men and 46% of the
women suffered from other mental illnesses, such as phobias
and anxiety disorders.</p>
<p>We also know that substance abuse is common. Many
published estimates of its extent are low because they
include only people institutionalized for treatment and deal
only with those in shelters, many of which explicitly exclude
the intoxicated. Once again, the rare studies with actual
diagnoses provide the best data. In Baltimore, 75% of the men
and 38% of the women were found to be substance abusers.
Contrary to popular impression, alcohol remains the drug of
choice among the homeless. The Baltimore study is typical of
many others, with 53% of the men abusing just alcohol, 7%
abusing other drugs only, and 15% addicted to both alcohol
and another drug.</p>
<p>Although the common perception is that mental illness and
substance abuse cause homelessness, homelessness itself may
also contribute to mental illness and substance abuse. The
same applies to crime. Homeless men have more convictions
than other low-income men. We do not know, however, whether
this is because some men have characteristics that make them
more likely to commit crimes and to become homeless, whether
a criminal record makes it harder to get and hold a job
(increasing the probability of homelessness), or whether
homelessness itself makes men more likely to commit crimes.</p>
<p>Homeless families are very different. They are almost
exclusively headed by women. Most enter homelessness directly
from shared housing, but very few have lived recently with
either a husband or boyfriend. Most are eligible for public
assistance, but only a minority receive benefits. Mental
health, drug and alcohol problems, and criminal records are
more common than in the general low-income population but do
not approach levels among homeless single men. Heads of
homeless families are, however, more likely than very poor
mothers with homes to have had traumatic childhoods,
including being abused and living in foster homes.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>What Causes Homelessness?</p>
<p>Our understanding about who the homeless are is much
better than our knowledge about what causes homelessness.
Despite the implication of the word "homeless," we know
almost nothing about the connection between homelessness and
housing markets. There is no reliable evidence that
homelessness is more extensive in cities with tight housing
markets. The assertions that homelessness is linked to rent
control or low vacancy rates are intuitions with little
empirical support. We do not know the role that changes in
housing markets (including the replacement of public housing
programs with housing vouchers, stricter building and zoning
codes, and the explicit policies designed to reduce the
number of single-room occupancy hotels) have played in
creating homelessness.</p>
<p>Although few of the homeless currently work, we know
little about their work histories. Neither do we know if
their non-participation is because of lack of interest or
inability to find work. If the latter, we do not know if the
reason is lack of skills or personal characteristics that
make it hard for some to adapt to an increasingly structured
labor market with fewer day-labor jobs. We also do not know
whether these problems are mitigated by tight labor markets
and whether, therefore, homelessness would decline if
macroeconomic policies became more stimulatory.</p>
<p>Although many homeless individuals and most homeless
families are eligible for public assistance, these programs
have not enabled them to avoid homelessness. We do not know
if this is because benefit levels are inadequate, or if
severely dysfunctional people do not take advantage of
available programs.</p>
<p>Issues of causality are complicated by the fact that many
factors are interrelated. We cannot yet disentangle these to
discover the most cost-effective points for policy
intervention. For example, whether mental illness or
substance abuse renders an individual incapable of working
depends on the nature of the illness and the structure of the
available jobs. People with functional problems may be unable
to cope with a tight housing market or slack labor market but
might, in other circumstances, earn enough to purchase
shelter.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>When facing a crisis, the impulse to adopt policies
quickly rather than wait for the slow pace of research to
help design these policies is understandable. But in a time
of budgetary stringency, every dollar must count. Although we
should not wait for a full understanding of the causes of and
cures for homelessness before we begin to act, it is
imperative that we begin to ask the right questions before we
waste resources on ineffectual solutions.</p>
