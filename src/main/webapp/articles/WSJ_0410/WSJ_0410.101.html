	<p class="article-leader">Freeport-McMoRan Inc. said it is extending the period for
assured minimum 60-cent quarterly cash distributions on
publicly held units of Freeport-McMoRan Resource Partners
L.P. through the second quarter of 1993. The
minimum-distribution period initially was scheduled to
conclude with the second quarter of 1991.
   James R. Moffett, Freeport-McMoRan Inc. chairman and chief
executive, said the New Orleans exploration and mining
company feels confident in extending the minimum distribution
for two years because the partnership's previously announced
asset sales are expected to generate about $575 million in
1990 that will help reduce debt and fund development of its
major sulfur discovery.</p>

of Freeport-McMoRan Inc., said directors approved a policy of
paying a 10-cent annual dividend. It said the initial
dividend will be declared in December, payable in January
