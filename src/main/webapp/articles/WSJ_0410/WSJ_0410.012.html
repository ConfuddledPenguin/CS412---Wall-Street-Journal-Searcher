	<p class="article-leader">It is difficult to reconcile George Melloan's pessimistic
view of Israel's economy (Global View, op-ed, March 5) with
the fact that 150 U.S. companies are successfully operating
facilities in Israel. While the Israeli government does
impose certain controls -- as do most countries -- the fact
remains that U.S. companies are manufacturing
state-of-the-art products in Israel.
   Intel (California) has invested $100 million in a
high-tech factory in Jerusalem. It will now add an additional
$80 million investment that will enable it to export more
than $100 million from Israel annually.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Motorola (Illinois) operates five facilities in Israel
with exports also exceeding $100 million. National
Semiconductor (California) recently announced that it will
add $50 million to its Israeli investment.</p>
<p>Vishay (Pennsylvania) has operated two factories in Israel
and will now add a third. Its additional investment will be
$60 million. The Limited, one of the world's largest
retailers of women's fashions, announced that it will
increase its investments in Israel. Its four plants currently
employ more than 750 workers. It forecast exports of $50
million for 1990.</p>
<p>Some of the bureaucracy that exists in Israel is due to
the fact that the government provides grants up to 39% of a
foreign corporation's investment. In addition, the government
provides export insurance, tax-free holidays, etc.</p>
<p>American companies understand how to live within an
economy that is slowly showing signs of improvement. Israel
is moving toward a freer economy. It is putting up for sale
24 government-owned companies according to a plan designed by
First Boston Corp.</p>
<p>It will not be an easy task for Israel to absorb large
numbers of Russian immigrants, but Israel -- the land of
miracles -- will do as it has done in the past -- rise to the
occasion. Israelis will not let this historic opportunity
grind to a halt for lack of providing jobs to Soviet Jews
emigrating to Israel.</p>
