	<p class="article-leader">Stock and bond prices moved in narrow ranges as investors
started a new week worried about first-quarter earnings and a
hefty new supply of government debt scheduled for auction
this week.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 4.95 points, to
2722.07. But declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange
were ahead of gainers and volume was anemic. Long-term
Treasury bond prices slipped in thin trading.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While currency traders scrambled to interpret the outcome
of the weekend meeting of the Group of Seven industrial
nations, neither bond nor stock investors were much
influenced by the dollar's gyrations. Instead, analysts said
investors in each market had enough to worry about without
trying to track the currency.</p>
<p>The stock market's overriding concern remains
first-quarter earnings. Last week, bank stocks were hammered
by prospects of disappointing quarterly results, providing a
preview of what is in store for companies that surprise
shareholders with less-than-expected profits. Those stocks
rebounded somewhat yesterday after some analysts indicated
conditions affecting banks don't warrant the gloomy outlook.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the stock market probably has some rough
going ahead. Although analysts have been steadily revising
estimates of corporate earnings lower during recent weeks,
investors have reacted mostly with caution, standing pat with
their holdings rather than selling.</p>
<p>One indication of the deep uncertainty afflicting
investors is that stock prices barely budged in New York
after a sharp rally in Tokyo. The Nikkei Index of 225 stocks
rose 1119.15, or 3.8%, to 30397.93 in a broad-based rally.
The best the Dow Jones Industrial Average could muster in
early trading yesterday was a gain of about 12 points, much
of it because of computer-assisted buy programs, that faded
later in the morning.</p>
<p>Bond prices didn't fare as well. An early plunge in the
dollar in Far East trading set the stage for some selling as
trading opened in New York. But as the currency rebounded,
bond prices recouped some of their losses.</p>
<p>The big factor overhanging the bond market, however, is
the auction today of $3.5 billion in Resolution Funding Corp.
40year bonds, followed tomorrow by the sale of $7.5 billion
in seven-year Treasury notes. Traders said prices fell
because market participants aren't sure how wellreceived the
two auctions will be.</p>
<p>In major market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices rose in light trading. Volume on the New York
Stock Exchange totaled 115.0 million shares. Declining issues
on the Big Board were ahead of gainers 839 to 652.</p>
<p>Bond prices were off. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year
bond fell a little more than a quarter of a point, or more
than $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount. The yield on the
issue rose to 8.54%.</p>
