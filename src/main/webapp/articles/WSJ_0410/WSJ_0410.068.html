	<p class="article-leader">Eastern Airlines' preferred shareholders, frustrated by
repayment proposals that would nearly wipe out what they are
owed, proposed that a federal bankruptcy court wrest control
of the carrier from its parent, Texas Air Corp., and turn it
into an independent company.
   A committee of preferred shareholders said it filed a
proposed Chapter 11 bankruptcy-code reorganization of
Eastern, now a Texas Air unit, that would create a new,
stand-alone airline. The new company would be 95%-owned by
unsecured and preferred creditors and run by new management.
That management would become eligible for the other 5%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The unexpected filing is the latest development in
steadily crumbling relations between Eastern and its creditor
groups, and may set the stage for a free-for-all for control
of the ailing carrier.</p>
<p>Until recently, creditors and the carrier have engaged in
protracted negotiations aimed at reaching agreement on a plan
for the airline to emerge from Chapter 11.</p>
<p>But the preferred holders' unilateral proposal to make
Eastern into an independent company highlights the breakdown
of those efforts.</p>
<p>On Friday, Eastern disclosed it intends to propose its own
reorganization plan, forgoing creditor approval, some time
this week. And earlier last week, Eastern's powerful
unsecured creditors committee rejected the airline's last
repayment plan, and said it wants a trustee appointed to run
the carrier and, if possible, sell it.</p>
<p>Under the plan proposed by preferred shareholders
yesterday, Eastern's unsecured creditors would receive new
preferred stock convertible into 50% of new Eastern common
stock. Current preferred holders would get a 45% stake and
the remaining 5% would be reserved for an as-yet unnamed
management for Eastern. The plan proposes all of the stock be
issued in publicly tradable form.</p>
<p>The fate of the preferred holders' plan is uncertain. The
court isn't required to respond immediately. But its approval
is unlikely without support from at least Eastern's unsecured
creditors or the airline itself.</p>
<p>And that, according to people familiar with the case, is
highly improbable. Eastern and Texas Air are certain to
oppose giving away ownership. A spokesman for both declined
comment yesterday. Unsecured creditors didn't say anything
about the plan last night, but it is understood they are
likely to balk, particularly at the provision that gives
preferred holders such a large stake.</p>
<p>Eastern's unsecured creditors, who are owed roughly $1
billion, are pivotal players in the bankruptcy case and stand
ahead of preferred shareholders in the creditor hierarchy.
Only Texas Air ranks behind preferred holders.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the plan set forth by preferred holders
yesterday would give unsecured creditors -- in addition to
half-ownership of the company -- proportionate shares in a
new $200 million issue of collateralized Eastern bonds and
$50 million in cash.</p>
<p>That part of the plan is similar to what Eastern offered
the unsecured creditors last week -- a proposal they quickly
rejected as inadequate. But it differs from Eastern's last
offer by adding an additional $70 million payment in the form
of notes to be paid out of proceeds, if any, from lawsuits
that would be filed against Texas Air. The suits would allege
damages for pre-bankruptcy transfers of Eastern assets by
Texas Air.</p>
<p>Last month, a bankruptcy court examiner concluded that
between $285 million and $403 million in claims could
possibly be pressed against Texas Air for a dozen such
transactions. But Texas Air and the examiner negotiated a
settlement valued at $280 million. The fate of that pending
settlement is unclear under the preferred shareholders'
proposal.</p>
<p>Eastern's preferred holders have been increasingly
irritated by the carrier's repayment plans. "You needed a
microscope to see what they were offering us," charged Robert
Miller, attorney for the preferred committee, yesterday. Five
classes of preferred stock with a liquidation value of $680
million would have received various new preferred shares with
a liquidation value of about $50 million under the latest
Eastern plan.</p>
<p>Separately, Eastern asked for bankruptcy court approval to
withdraw $80 million from its escrow account to support
second quarter operations.</p>
<p>Eastern's request for money follows U.S. Department of
Transportation tentative approval last week of the proposed
sale of the carrier's Latin American routes to AMR Corp.'s
American Airlines unit.</p>
<p>The Transportation Department also approved a related
transaction in which American would acquire Continental's
Miami-London route and other assets for $102 million.
However, it rejected for now Eastern's proposal to sell
American its Miami/Tampa-Toronto route, saying that it will
start a proceeding to see whether the route should be sold to
American or another carrier.</p>
