	<p class="article-leader">Aileen Inc., New York, said it abandoned plans to look for
buyers of all or part of its business, because of improved
prospects for growth and profitability.
   The women's apparel manufacturer and retailer said it may
continue to dispose of plants, machinery and equipment that
aren't necessary for its operations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At its annual meeting, Abe Oberlin, chairman, said Aileen
adopted a program to reduce overhead, simplify manufacturing
operations and manage inventories more efficiently. He said
Aileen had hired a merchandising manager, whom he didn't
identify.</p>
<p>Mr. Oberlin said he anticipates a return to profitability
in the fiscal second quarter, based on a 28% increase in
retail sales for the first nine weeks of the quarter. For the
fiscal first quarter ended Jan. 27, Aileen had a net loss of
$1.2 million, or 22 cents a share, on sales of $10.6 million.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Aileen closed at $2 a share, up 12.5 cents.</p>
