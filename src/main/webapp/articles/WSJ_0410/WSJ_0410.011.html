	<p class="article-leader">CLARKSBURG, W.Va. -- Alamco Inc. said it expects to record
a second-quarter after-tax gain of about $1.4 million, or 56
cents a share.
   The extraordinary gain is from the prepayment of a note to
a trade vendor.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The producer of oil and natural gas reported net income of
$436,000, or two cents a share, for the year-earlier second
quarter. That figure includes a tax credit of $194,000, or
one cent a share.</p>
