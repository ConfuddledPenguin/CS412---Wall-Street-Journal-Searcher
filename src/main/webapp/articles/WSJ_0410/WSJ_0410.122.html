	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- McHaffie Inc., its owner, and two employees
pleaded guilty to criminal charges involving a scheme to
falsify test data on bolts the Sylmar, Calif., defense
contractor made for use in various military jet-aircraft
engines.
   The company and its 56-year-old owner, Norman McHaffie,
pleaded guilty to conspiracy and two false-statement counts,
the U.S. attorney's office said. James Hicks, 45, pleaded
guilty to conspiracy and one false-statement count. William
Whitham, 37, pleaded guilty to two false-statement counts.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The defendants admitted that they failed to test the bolts
and submitted fraudulent certifications to the government,
said an assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted the case. The
certifications indicated that the bolts had been tested and
met all manufacturing standards and other specifications. The
scheme continued during an eight-year period beginning in
1979.</p>
<p>The company faces a maximum fine of $1.5 million. Mr.
McHaffie faces a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison and a
$750,000 fine. Messrs. Hicks and Whitham, who cooperated with
the government in its inquiry, each face a maximum sentence
of 10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine.</p>
