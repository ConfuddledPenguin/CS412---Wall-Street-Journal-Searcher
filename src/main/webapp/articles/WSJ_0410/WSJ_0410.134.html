	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- For Tetsuro Ozawa, daily life in Japan can be a
real pain. Mr. Ozawa is forever bumping his head. He also has
trouble scrunching his legs under dinner tables while sitting
on the floor. He is more than six feet tall, 6-feet-1 in
fact.
   Not only is he particularly tall, as Japanese men go, he
has big feet, which are hard to squeeze into the smallish
slippers people provide guests to wear indoors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The 31-year-old lawyer dreads business trips. The beds in
Japan's compact business-hotels are too compact for him. "My
feet are always dangling over the edge," he complains.
Ryokans, the traditional Japanese inns, aren't much better.
The futons are too short. So are the bathrobes. "I always
have to call the desk and ask for an extra-large," he says.</p>
<p>For centuries, the Japanese have thought of themselves as
short people, and that is part of the stereotype foreigners
have of them. They have always built houses with low ceilings
and doorways that Westerners tend to knock their heads on.</p>
<p>But truth to tell, the shape of this little island nation
is changing: The Japanese are getting bigger. By turning
small things into something big (from Hondas to the Sony
Walkman to semiconductors), the Japanese earned fame and
fortune. The latter has afforded more protein in the diet.</p>
<p>Today's average 17-year-old boy is 5feet-8-inches tall,
some four inches taller than a fellow of that age was in
1926, and only an inch shorter than the average adult
American male (according to insurance-company statistics).
Japanese girls, too, are topping the charts, at 5-feet-3, up
three inches from 1926, according to the Ministry of
Education, which measures every schoolchild every year
through high school. How much taller they get after that
isn't tracked.</p>
<p>"There are a lot of tall people now," says Toshinobu Sato,
a physician with the education ministry's school health
division -- and a man of 5-feet-11 1/2 inches.</p>
<p>The growth would seem to be easily explained. The protein
and additional calcium make for longer, stronger bodies,
doctors say. But there is a more popular explanation, one
that even some Japanese doctors buy: the tatami-mat-to-chair
theory, according to which the shift from sitting, eating and
sleeping on the floor to using modern, Western-style chairs,
tables and beds has given people more room to stretch out.</p>
<p>Whatever the explanation, the growing pains are real. "I
can't sit with my legs tucked under me on the tatami mat too
long," says Katsumi Kusuhara, a 5-foot-11-inch advertising
executive at Dentsu Inc. "When I go to a Japanese funeral, I
have to excuse myself and sit cross-legged." Kneeling at
length puts his feet to sleep.</p>
<p>In the schools, where students are bursting out of old
classroom furniture and towering over their teachers, the
discomfort is more acute. The education ministry is studying
whether the time has come to make chairs and desks a little
bigger, as it has done three times since World War II. Jiro
Kohara, a professor of human engineering at Chiba Institute
of Technology and a specialist in chairs, says the government
can no longer ignore the growing number of students who are
pushing six feet.</p>
<p>Seating tall people isn't just a problem in classrooms.
Japanese baseball stadiums, theaters and concert halls have
narrow seats with little legroom between rows -- very hard on
the knees. Airlines get complaints about close quarters on
domestic flights, which have half the space between rows that
international flights do. While cramped planes are hardly
unique to Japan, the carping here is of recent vintage. "I
guess we can't cram people into the seats anymore," says Yuko
Kitano, spokeswoman for All Nippon Airways Co.</p>
<p>Public-relations-conscious All Nippon last year raised the
minimum-height requirement for female flight attendants more
than an inch, to 5-feet-4. "If everyone is getting taller, it
doesn't look good if the flight attendants are too short,"
says Ms. Kitano. Meanwhile, rival Japan Airlines says it is
going to increase the distance between business-class seats
on domestic flights.</p>
<p>Attention always seems to be focused on the lower body.
The education ministry, which closely monitors changes in
seated heights, says most of the change in the dimensions of
Japanese schoolchildren is in the legs, not the torso. A
peculiarly Japanese explanation for this is that, as rice
eaters, people developed longer intestines and, in
consequence, a longer upper body. But as eating habits have
changed to include more meat and less rice, bodies made their
own compensating adjustments resulting in shorter trunks,
longer legs. Western doctors find this theory hard to
swallow.</p>
<p>Though why many Japanese would consider taller better than
short isn't clear, given their historical success as a
nation, people here revel in their added stature. "We've had
such a complex that we didn't measure up," says Prof. Kohara,
who stands 5-feet-8. "Internationally, Japan is reaching a
higher position. Physically, people are getting taller. It's
a nice correlation."</p>
<p>The recent summit meeting that Japan's 59-year-old prime
minister, Toshiki Kaifu, and President Bush had in Palm
Springs, Calif., served as a painful reminder, however, that
the island nation must look to the next generation of
politicians in one respect. Japanese television viewers
cringed to see their 5-foot-6-inch leader dwarfed by Mr.
Bush, at 6-feet-2. The foreign ministry says it is aware of
the short-image thing but can't do much about it. "We can't
fake anything," says an official. "These guys are short. We
have to face it."</p>
<p>But by and large, people here are proud to see young
sprouts outgrow old stereotypes. Keiko Isobe, a 5-foot-8-inch
housewife in her 50s, has always been self-conscious about
her height. "Thirty years ago when my husband and I walked
down the street, we really stood out. People stared. I used
to be so embarrassed." Now Mrs. Isobe boasts about having
three daughters who look down on her. "People . . . are
jealous," she says.</p>
<p>After years of frustrating shopping trips, Mrs. Isobe is
pleased now to find her size in the tall women's section of
the Isetan department store.</p>
<p>She should be grateful to Yoshihiro Nihei, sales manager
of the tall and large size departments. At 6-feet-2, he can
relate to her problems. Finding suits, shirts and shoes that
fit has been a tall order for this fashion-conscious
33-year-old. He can afford imported Giorgio Armani suits and
Allen Edmonds shoes, but he is determined to improve the
quality of life for tall people generally. "Japan really
needs to size up," he says. "Buses, movie theaters are all
too small. We need to think about improving public spaces."</p>
<p>Various businesses are trying to take advantage of this
growing trend. Nishikawa Sangyo Co., a Tokyo bedding
wholesaler, says sales of extra-long blankets and futons are
soaring. Mitsui Wood Products Inc, a home-design firm, now
builds certain ceilings one foot higher than those in
standard homes -- 270 centimeters instead of 240. The company
is going after three-generation families trying to live under
the same roof. One of its ads has a grandfather standing next
to a tall young boy. The old man says, "Even if it's just
right for me, my grandson finds a normal home too cramped."</p>
<p>One last sign of the times: Basketball is becoming popular
in Japan. Tim Andree, a 6-foot-10-inch American imported five
years ago to play for Toyota Motor Corp's industrial-league
team, says: "The teams are getting better. The coaching is
improving. Within a few years, Japan may be able to compete
in the Olympics." Maybe by then Japanese players will be
taller still.</p>
