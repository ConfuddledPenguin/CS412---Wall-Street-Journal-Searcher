	<p class="article-leader">The long-running takeover battle for United Airlines
parent UAL Corp. has the makings of a long-running soap
opera.
   Will the pilots complete their fourth bid in three years?
Can Chairman Stephen Wolf survive? Can Coniston Partners get
out alive? Will the arbitragers suffer another takeover-stock
bloodbath? How can the directors get out of this mess?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Eugene Keilin, one of the pilots' investment bankers, says
the siege has been "like the Thirty Years' War." The union
proposal for a $4.38 billion buy-out that was approved by UAL
directors Friday "is either a truce or the end of the war."</p>
<p>Although the finale remains in doubt, the latest episodes
-- which began with a $5.4 billion bid last August by Los
Angeles billionaire Marvin Davis -- have already produced
plenty of heroes and villains, winners and losers.</p>
<p>                       WINNERS</p>
<p>Marvin Davis. After setting up Northwest Airlines parent
NWA Inc. for a takeover last spring, Mr. Davis put UAL in
play last summer by acquiring 3% and making a bid. Assuming
he bought 650,000 shares for an average of $140 a share, and
sold at roughly double that level before the labor-management
buy-out collapsed in October, his indicated profit would be
about $90 million. Mr. Davis wouldn't comment.</p>
<p>Saul Steinberg. His Reliance Group Holdings Inc. bought
1.5 million shares of UAL for an average of $110 before
takeover fever hit the airlines last year. So even though he
still held about one million shares when the first bid
collapsed last October, he got out at an average of $210,
making a $150 million profit on a $165 million investment.</p>
<p>American and Delta Air Lines. United's takeover morass has
meant expansion opportunities that will only ripen if United
assumes more than $4 billion in extra debt for this buy-out.
Both AMR Corp.'s American and Delta, which have kept their
debt levels low while other airlines leveraged up, should
compete more aggressively for international routes.</p>
<p>Machinists Union. United Machinists chief John Peterpaul
and his investment banker, Brian Freeman, have emerged as
winners in both phases of this deal. Their opposition helped
kill the first pilot-management buy-out. When the pilots
wanted to make a new bid, they went to the machinists. Mr.
Peterpaul's price for cooperation: Mr. Wolf's scalp.</p>
<p>Pilot advisers. Led by the law firm of Paul Weiss Rifkind
Wharton & Garrison, banks and advisers to the pilots and Mr.
Wolf racked up fees of $58.7 million, despite failing to
compete the first deal. When Mr. Wolf was excluded from the
latest bid, he got his law firm, Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &
Flom, hired by the board.</p>
<p>Other pilot advisers include Salomon Brothers Inc. and
Keilin & Bloom.</p>
<p>                       LOSERS</p>
<p>UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf. Riding high six months ago, Mr.
Wolf saw his reputation dented with the collapse of the first
deal, which would have gained him $76 million for his stock
and options. A man some believe is more motivated by ego than
money, he retreated from the action and refused to lead a new
buy-out attempt. Now, if the unions complete their bid, he is
probably gone. Ditto his No. 2, Jack Pope, a former financial
whiz whose hardball tactics with the banks helped sink the
first deal.</p>
<p>Arbitragers. Takeover-stock traders sustained losses of
more than $1 billion when UAL stock plummeted to $121 from
$293 after the deal collapsed last October and initial
efforts to revive it faltered. Firms that lost big included
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., Bear Stearns Cos.,
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. and Paine Webber Inc. For
them and others, UAL became known as "the deal from hell."</p>
<p>UAL's board. The siege has left many with the view that
UAL directors lack leadership. After allowing former chairman
Richard Ferris to buy hotels and rental cars and rename the
company Allegis Corp., they ditched Mr. Ferris under fire,
but haven't extricated United from the morass. Directors
include Manufacturers Hanover Corp. Chairman John
McGillicuddy and Hertz Corp. Chairman Frank Olsen.</p>
<p>Board advisers. The board's investment banker, First
Boston Corp., and law firm, Davis Polk & Wardwell, have been
tarnished by their mere association with the endless deal,
some takeover experts say. Davis Polk could bill at its
regular hourly rates, but First Boston has only been getting
$250,000 per quarter plus expenses. If the latest deal
closes, First Boston gets $10 million; but it won't get a
bonus for topping Mr. Davis's first bid of $240 a share. The
pilots' new bid is only $201.</p>
<p>Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. These two banks
collected $8 million in fees for saying they were "highly
confident" they could raise $7 billion for the first buy-out.
But their reputation suffered from their highly embarrassing
failure to deliver.</p>
<p>United's pilots. Pilot union leader F.C. "Rick" Dubinsky
and his long-time investment banker, Eugene Keilin, have been
pursuing a buy-out like the Holy Grail. However nobly
inspired, the effort has clearly debilitated UAL. Whether
they can turn it into a success for United's 6,500 pilots
depends on whether they find management, obtain financing,
and revive the airline. If the deal flops, Mr. Dubinsky could
face political problems with his members in the fall.</p>
<p>Coniston Partners. The partners in this investment firm
thought they were scooping up UAL at bargain prices after the
$300-a-share deal collapsed. Its average disclosed cost:
$161. Coniston faced a $100 million loss on its 11.8%
position when the stock went as low as $121, as the pilots
struggled to mount a new bid. Even with an agreed-to deal,
Coniston is still in the hole after carrying costs, and its
losses will deepen if the unions don't get financing.
Yesterday, UAL stock closed at $161, down $2.50 a share in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>British Airways PLC. This United ally backed the first
deal with a promised $750 million investment. Its top two
executives engaged in public bickering after the first deal
fell apart; and British Air steered clear this time. Now it
may get involved again.</p>
<p>Consumers. The flying public could wind up paying higher
air fares to help United make its interest payments. "Higher
debt levels can ultimately mean higher fares," says Cornish
Hitchcock, legal director of Aviation Consumer Action Project
in Washington, D.C.</p>
