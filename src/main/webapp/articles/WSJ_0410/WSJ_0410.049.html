	<p class="article-leader">In a severe setback for the insurers of former asbestos
manufacturers, a New Jersey state judge ruled that
Owens-Illinois Inc.'s insurance companies will have to pay as
much as $960 million to cover asbestos-related claims against
the company.
   Owens-Illinois sued several of its insurers in 1980 when
they balked at paying the asbestos-related claims. Judge
Erminie Conley of Superior Court in New Brunswick, N.J., on
Friday rejected the insurers' arguments that Owens-Illinois's
policies don't cover asbestos damages. The judge said the
policies cover a combined maximum of $960 million in
property-damage and personal-injury claims. The maximum for
personal-injury claims, which account for most of the damages
being sought in suits against Owens-Illinois, is $620
million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Gita Rothschild, an attorney for Owens-Illinois, called
the ruling "a total victory. It's a vindication of the rights
of policyholders."</p>
<p>David D'Aloia, an attorney for two of the insurance
companies, United Insurance Co. and Allstate Insurance Co.,
said, "I was stunned by the ruling. . . . We disagree with
the judge's ruling and are evaluating it for appeal."</p>
<p>The other companies that were either primary or secondary
insurers in the case are General Reinsurance Corp., Cigna
Reinsurance Co. and Owens Insurance Ltd. Owens, which is a
subsidiary of Owens-Illinois, had entirely reinsured its risk
through the other companies, Ms. Rothschild said.</p>
<p>The policies would cover suits filed against
Owens-Illinois for damages that came to light after 1977,
which would account for most of the tens of thousands of
asbestos-damage suits pending against the company. Claims
against Owens-Illinois before September 1977 are covered by
the company's previous policies. From 1948 to 1958,
Owens-Illinois made pipe insulation from asbestos, which
causes respiratory illnesses.</p>
<p>The insurers had claimed their policies didn't apply to
any asbestos health injuries, such as lung cancer, because of
exclusions added to the policies. They also accused the
company of fraud, alleging that Owens-Illinois didn't inform
the insurers of various asbestos-related suits.</p>
<p>As a result of Judge Conley's ruling, Owens-Illinois would
receive "hundreds of millions of dollars in coverage that
wasn't meant to be included and that wasn't paid for by the
company," Mr. D'Aloia said.</p>
<p>The judge's decision, however, doesn't mean that any of
the money will go directly to Owens-Illinois. Instead, if
upheld, it would guarantee that insurers will have to pay a
huge portion of settlements and damages awarded in the
company's asbestos cases.</p>
<p>"All of the money will go to asbestos victims," said Ms.
Rothschild. "The policyholder should get the coverage that it
thinks it is buying. It shouldn't have to fight to get the
coverage that it thinks it has been paying for all these
years."</p>

<p>NEW FEDERATED STORES bankruptcy court filing is linked to
possible effort to get back $500 million from banks.</p>
<p>With Campeau Corp.'s two U.S. retailing units already
under court protection, the units' holding company, Federated
Stores Inc., also filed a bankruptcy-law petition on March
30. While the company presented the filing as a housekeeping
matter, it appears to be more than that.</p>
<p>By filing under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code
before April 7, the holding company gained a significant
advantage in the event it attempts to get back $500 million
paid to the Bank of Montreal and Bank Paribas on April 7,
1989.</p>
<p>The payment was made as part of a refinancing of Allied
Stores Corp., a Campeau unit. Under bankruptcy law, an
insolvent company can sometimes get money returned that it
had paid out within a year prior to the Chapter 11 filing. If
Federated had filed for bankruptcy court protection after
April 7, it would have forfeited this possible right.</p>
<p>In the weeks prior to Federated's filings, creditors of
the two units, Allied and Federated Department Stores Inc.,
had put pressure on the parent's chairman, G. William Miller,
to file under Chapter 11 so that the company -- and hence its
creditors -- might get a crack at the $500 million. "We were
saying that we were concerned and we didn't want to see that
{April 7} date passed," said Lawrence M. Handelsman, counsel
to the Federated bondholders committee.</p>
<p>While Allied creditors are participating in the Allied and
Federated Department Stores proceedings in Cincinnati, parent
Federated chose to file its own Chapter 11 petition in a
different city: San Francisco. This concerns some creditors,
who may want a role in the fight for the $500 million because
they believe that it ultimately belongs in Allied's coffers.</p>
<p>If the creditors ultimately decide to sue to get the money
for themselves, they would likely rely on the doctrine of
fraudulent conveyance. In such a suit, anyone damaged when a
leveraged buy-out goes bad can bring suit on the grounds that
the buy-out was designed or destined to render the resulting
company insolvent.</p>
<p>Bankruptcy lawyers say that the judge in San Francisco
will have separate debtors and creditors to protect. Thus, it
could be more difficult for Allied and Federated creditors to
pursue actions in that court. "I think it's strategy. . . .
It does remove those actions from the main arena {in
Cincinnati}," says a lawyer for Allied creditors.</p>
<p>Mr. Miller, Federated's chairman, points out that three
other Federated holding companies had earlier filed for
bankruptcy-law protection in San Francisco and that to file
Federated's petition elsewhere would have been "confusing."</p>
<p>He says he believes that bondholders knew that FSI would
try to preserve their rights and complains that "lawyers like
to stir up activity."</p>

<p>PEAT MARWICK WINS VERDICT dismissing $21 million damage
suit in Texas.</p>
<p>A state court jury in Houston threw out the negligence
case after nearly three weeks of trial. Most such cases don't
get so far because liability insurers often prefer to settle
to avoid the possibility of a big judgment. The insurers
believe many people see accountants as a source of "deep
pockets" to recoup business losses.</p>
<p>"It's difficult to run the risk, but Peat Marwick felt
strongly in this case," said Cliff Gunter, an attorney in
Houston with Dallas-based Bracewell & Patterson, counsel for
the accounting firm.</p>
<p>The case reflects a trend in which more investors are
suing accounting firms, claiming they lost money in business
deals by relying on misleading documents prepared by
accountants. Filed in March 1987, the suit was brought by 13
members of a real estate limited partnership known as 320
Associates, which was established for the construction of a
downtown Houston office building. Lenders foreclosed on the
project.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs, a group of locally prominent professionals
and business people, alleged that Peat Marwick didn't
properly prepare partnership tax returns for 1981. They
contended it negligently misrepresented certain partnership
agreements in the tax returns, causing them to continue
financial commitments they otherwise would have withdrawn. In
a verdict issued last Thursday, the jury exonerated Peat
Marwick.</p>
<p>"This case was yet another example of the alarming trend
in our society where one party makes a business mistake and
tries to make another pay for it," said Mr. Gunter. Attorneys
for the plaintiffs couldn't be reached for comment.</p>

<p>CHICAGO LAW FIRMS want foreign legal advisers licensed to
consult in Illinois.</p>
<p>The petition submitted to the Illinois Supreme Court would
allow foreign attorneys to advise corporations based in their
countries about U.S. law. The lawyers also would be able to
counsel U.S. firms on foreign matters. They would not,
however, be permitted to represent clients in domestic cases.</p>
<p>Nine major Chicago law firms, including Sidley & Austin,
Jenner & Block, Kirkland & Ellis and Mayer, Brown & Platt,
are behind the petition. But it is not an altruistic
endeavor. Chicago lawyers can't practice in some foreign
countries, notably Japan, because foreign lawyers can't work
in Illinois. The firms say the reciprocity problem also
hinders the growth of international business and trade in
Illinois. New York, Alaska, California, Washington, D.C.,
Hawaii, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio and Texas already have
rules similar to the Illinois proposal. Wisconsin also is
considering licensing foreign lawyers as consultants. The
Cook County state's attorney's office says it will not oppose
the effort as it did five years ago.</p>
<p>At that time, the state's attorney's office feared that
unlicensed foreign attorneys would mislead and exploit
immigrants and foreign residents.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>A CONTEMPT RULING was upheld against an attorney who
refused to identify his client.</p>
<p>Chipping away further at the attorney-client privilege,
the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta affirmed a
contempt ruling against Jerald W. Newton, a Santa Monica,
Calif., attorney. Asserting the so-called "last-link
doctrine," Mr. Newton refused to reveal the identity of a
client whose fees were paid by a third party. He was asked to
make the disclosure by a federal grand jury in South Florida
investigating money laundering.</p>
<p>The last-link doctrine protects lawyers from having to
disclose client information which, though not ordinarily
privileged, becomes so because it would be the last link in
proving a crime. The appeals court said that since the "John
Doe" client was already under indictment, he couldn't have
reasonably expected his identity to be kept confidential. Mr.
Newton said he hadn't decided what to do about the ruling.</p>
<p>The ruling is the second in a month from the 11th circuit
dealing with attorney-client privilege and the doctrine. In
another case last month, Chief Judge Gerald B. Tjoflat said
he would like to see the full panel review the last-link
concept and toss it out.</p>
<p>The law is developing rapidly in this area. In a Seventh
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals opinion in March, the court
upheld the attorney-client privilege in a case involving a
Chicago lawyer, David Cherney, who refused to reveal who paid
his client's fees.</p>
<p>Mr. Cherney said that the third party had consulted him
about his own possible involvement in a conspiracy.</p>
