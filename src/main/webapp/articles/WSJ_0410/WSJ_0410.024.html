	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- The new voice of the American Medical
Association is Brahmin in accent and blunt in message:
   In health care, Americans need to "retrench back to a
reasonable benefit schedule."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Supply and demand don't meet in medicine, thanks to
insurance: "Every patient that walked into my office, I could
find something wrong with. The average human body has 123
moles on it."</p>
<p>Basic coverage ought to be rationed using success ratios:
"You don't do a technical operation on somebody who has
virtually no chance of survival. Yet that's what's being done
today. People are talking about possibilities -- we want to
talk scientific probabilities."</p>
<p>Different attitudes toward human life distort how the U.S.
measures itself against the world: "You go to France or
Germany, you don't see any 500-gram {18-oz.} babies in the
neonatal intensive-care unit. You see viable infants that are
going to grow up and be self-supporting."</p>
<p>Congressional repeal of the "catastrophic" tax reflected
avarice of the Medicare elite: "You've got 100,000
millionaires drinking out of the public trough, and you've
got kids dying in the inner cities from diseases {against
which} they could have been immunized. That's obscene."</p>
<p>James Todd is the acting top AMA executive and under
consideration for a permanent appointment. But he doesn't
seem to be holding back, nor is it an easy time to do so. As
James Sammons's 16-year reign ended in February amid
financial scandal, the AMA was undertaking a major drive to
influence the new order in U.S. medicine that seems to be
looming in every legislative session.</p>
<p>Health Access America is the AMA's plan. It combines
recognition of large-scale economic imperatives with a denial
that the price match between individual buyer and seller, the
basis for all economy, can ever hope to re-emerge in
mainstream medicine.</p>
<p>In that respect, it is similar to trial balloons floated
in recent months at the federal and state levels. It would
require employers to cover their workers' households,
universalize Medicaid for the uncovered poor, create state
risk pools for those of modest means who are now
"uninsurable," and tax medical fringe benefits.</p>
<p>Dr. Todd isn't putting a price tag on this. "The Pepper
Commission gave its report and the minute somebody said $66
billion everybody threw up their hands and said, `That's a
nice exercise,'" he recalls. The cost would depend on how
spartan the basic benefit package is (the AMA wants to
pre-empt state add-on requirements). If the doctors get
malpractice-liability suits curbed, that will hold it down.
High deductibles and co-payments will, too. Lots of
economists would agree to all that.</p>
<p>Then comes physician price controls. Oh, they're not
called that. Rather, they're "practice parameters" -- still
to be worked out -- designating what's appropriate (read:
reimbursable) treatment. And a relative-value scale for
specialists that sets fees based on a doctor's overhead,
including his training, equipment and insurance.</p>
<p>How does that element of the proposal sit with Dr. Todd's
membership? "Uncomfortably," he admits. However, he sees no
prominent defections. And he says doctors will accept such a
setup, together with other components of the package, as a
way to dispel an existing adversarial climate vis-a-vis
patients, insurers and the government, along with the
intrusive monitoring that springs from it. Although Canada
still is a fighting word with physicians, Dr. Todd's
health-care vision owes more to that nation's lower-cost,
less-technological system than he'd like to admit.</p>
<p>Dr. Todd, 59, is a Harvard product who once was chief
resident at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York. A
general surgeon in suburban New Jersey until 1985, he
maintains that fees in medicine already are a function of
"complexity, severity, experience" -- input costs really --
but with some bills larded because full insurance eliminates
consumer resistance. No "perfect" market works in this
circumstance, it follows, and objective rate schedules are
the best way to impose restraint. The wealthy would be free
to pay extra (Dr. Todd is not a utopian), but for the mass
market, price couldn't be a reward for extraordinary talent
or an inducement to practice in undesirable surroundings.</p>
<p>This represents a remarkable, if gradual, break from
historic AMA policy. For much of this century, progressives
considered the group reactionary for jealously guarding the
prerogatives of physicians (and acting to limit their
number). It also stood foursquare against government mandates
for health-care coverage. Now, that too is out. Dr. Todd, who
talks of his meetings with "Henry" and "Ron" (Reps. Waxman of
California and Wyden of Oregon, Democrats active in writing
laws for medicine), says the AMA's "maturation" stems from
realizing "ideologies of the past really aren't that
appropriate to the future."</p>
<p>Today the group's headquarters are staffed with lawyers,
ethicists and others with more than an M.D. after their
names. It's a far cry from the 1930s and 1940s, when Morris
Fishbein was a one-man policy shop in his editorship of the
AMA Journal, and even from the 1950s, when the doctors made
early use of political consultants and PACs to shape debate.</p>
<p>Losing the fight against Medicare in 1965 broke the back
of the old AMA. Now restoring the fiscal health of Medicare
is a key item in Health Access America. The AMA wants workers
to pre-fund the program so that compound growth of its assets
will carry them through acute and long-term care.</p>
<p>Could the undoing of Medicare's catastrophic-care mandates
last year mean that the country is now moving back toward
less-regulated and -subsidized medicine, even as the AMA is
pushing ahead? Dr. Todd rejects reading any significance into
last year's political phenomenon. "It was about 40,000
people" who "didn't want to pay the extra money, even though
it would be ultimately to the benefit of the whole program,"
he says.</p>
<p>Whatever the price tag for a redrawn health-care system,
Dr. Todd expects some new taxes to be needed, and says
(contra the AMA's stance in the early '70s) the fairest is a
head tax. "A sin tax really doesn't work. It probably
adversely affects those least able. You're not going to stop
the disadvantaged, the poor from using alcohol and tobacco
and drugs because that's their escape from the situation they
find themselves in."</p>
<p>Only about 43% of U.S. physicians belong to the AMA today,
down from 73% at the time of the Medicare fight. However,
dues are nearly 10 times what they were then, in nominal
terms -- and the rolls have dipped with each big hike. Among
doctors under age 45 the membership percentages rose in the
1980s. So whether Dr. Todd speaks for American medicine is
subject to debate. But like the sound of his words or not,
you find the AMA is outspoken again, even as it goes along to
get along with the lawmakers.</p>
