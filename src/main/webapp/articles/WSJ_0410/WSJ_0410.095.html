including 266,900 bought from March 22 to March 30 for 93.75
cents to $1.375 a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The group said it acquired its Transcon stock for
investment purposes, but that its intentions are "subject to
continual review and re-evaluation."</p>

<p>In Beverly Hills, Calif., Transcon officials couldn't be

1989 had revenue of $226.5 million and operating losses of
$31.6 million.</p>
