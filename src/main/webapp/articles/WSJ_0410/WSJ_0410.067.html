	<p class="article-leader">Thank you for conceding the important differences between
New York's fiscal problems and those of Massachusetts
("Cuomo's Ghost," Review & Outlook, March 22).
   In analyzing New York's budget policies, you also
acknowledged that New York must address extraordinarily
serious social problems, such as AIDS and drug abuse.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>With agreement on those important points, we differ only
with your commentary regarding the figures you cite.</p>
<p>You stated New York's spending rose by 104% during Gov.
Mario M. Cuomo's first seven years in office. That figure is
simply inaccurate. The actual increase in New York's spending
supported by state taxes during that period, according to the
National Association of State Budget Officers, was 69%. That
was below the average state budget increase of 71% for the
period. Even if federal aid is included, and NASBO didn't
include it in either New York's or the other 49 states'
figures, New York's growth figure is only 81%.</p>
<p>In addition, U.S. Census figures show that, in 1988, 12
states took in more revenue as a percentage of residents'
personal income than New York did.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the increase of 9.3% you cite for this year's
proposed budget is misleading in that it includes federal
aid. The governor's proposed growth in revenues from state
taxes is only 4.49%, a figure below the projected inflation
rate.</p>
<p>Finally, we could not agree more with your conclusion that
government budgets reflect the political philosophy of chief
executives, and we were pleased that you chose to compare
Gov. Cuomo with President Ronald Reagan.</p>
<p>President Reagan's philosophy, as reflected in his
budgets, was to spend up to $200 billion a year more than you
are willing to raise in revenue, and leave the bill for your
successors. This philosophy tripled the national debt to $3
trillion during his eight short years in office.</p>
<p>In contrast, Gov. Cuomo's philosophy, as reflected in his
budgets, is to raise all the revenue you determine is
necessary to meet government's legitimate obligations, and
not spend what you do not raise.</p>
<p>Which philosophy is sounder? That's easy. Just ask
yourself which one you think President Bush wishes his
predecessor had followed.</p>

<p>Albany, N.Y.</p>
