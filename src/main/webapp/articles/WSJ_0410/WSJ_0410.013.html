	<p class="article-leader">STOCKHOLM -- AB Volvo of Sweden said its proposed
strategic alliance with France's Renault S.A. would have
boosted 1989 pretax profit by 306 million Swedish kronor ($50
million), or 4.4%, had it been in effect last year.
   In a memorandum detailing the planned alliance for
shareholders, Volvo said it expects to reap average annual
cost savings of 800 million kronor between the second and
fifth years the Renault partnership is in force. Those gains
would soar to two billion kronor a year by the time full
effects of the cooperation are achieved by years eight to 10
-- about 1999, the Swedish auto maker said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The bullish analysis is part of a hard sell Volvo is
giving the proposed Renault partnership to quell complaints
by several big shareholders. The transaction requires
approval by shareholders at Volvo's annual meeting on April
25.</p>
<p>Initial reactions to the Volvo-Renault association were
generally favorable when it was unveiled in February. But
questions have surfaced following recent comments from
Renault officials ruling out certain areas of potential
cooperation, such as joint development of heavy truck models
or engines, that promised big payoffs.</p>
<p>"If that's the case, there's very little sense in their
getting together," said Philip Ayton, auto analyst for London
securities firm Barclays de Zoete Wedd. "The alliance is a
way of solving some of the problems Volvo is facing. But as
it stands it's too woolly to have even much medium-term
impact."</p>
<p>The annual two billion kronor cost reductions projected by
Volvo would be evenly divided between trucks, buses and cars.
The Swedish concern estimated that within five to 10 years
(using current truck and bus operations as a base) shared
production, purchasing and product development with Renault
would trim costs 6% to 8% each year. On the car side,
cooperating with Renault would enable Volvo to cut costs by
up to 5% by the late 1990s. Volvo said there is also
potential for significant short-term cost savings, although
it didn't quantify them.</p>
<p>A company spokesman said the cost cuts would generate
bigger profit increases at the truck and bus division than
cars. "The reason is that you have more obvious synergies on
the truck side," he said. "And you can go further in
cooperating without endangering each company's trademark
image in trucks than cars."</p>
<p>It took Volvo and Renault more than a year of negotiations
to agree to their test marriage. Stopping short of an
outright merger, the two big auto concerns outlined a plan
leaving them legally independent but closely tied in
practice.</p>
<p>Under the pact, the companies swap 45% minority stakes in
their respective truck and bus units. Volvo would also
acquire 20% of the parent Renault, which includes the French
concern's auto operations, with an option to raise the stake
to 25% within three years.</p>
<p>Renault, in turn, is to buy 25% of Volvo's car division.
The French concern also agreed to gradually accumulate a
voting stake of up to 10% in the parent Volvo concern through
open market purchases.</p>
<p>The net financial effect of the transactions call for
Volvo to pay Renault 7.9 billion kronor. (The figure would
jump to 12.5 billion kronor if Volvo exercises its option to
buy an additional 5% of the Renault parent concern.)</p>
<p>Repeating earlier arguments, Volvo cited overcapacity and
competition, exacerbated by stringent environmental
regulation and a faster pace of product development, as
reasons it must increase output of both cars and trucks to
stay afloat in increasingly cutthroat European car markets.
The Renault alliance would allow Volvo "to retain its
independence while simultaneously strengthening its
competitiveness," the Swedish concern said.</p>
<p>Not everybody agrees. Mats Guldbrand, head equity fund
manager at pension fund SPP of Stockholm, a big Volvo
shareholder, said he's "still skeptical about the deal." One
reason is that he remains uncertain about the price Volvo is
paying for Renault, which he calls a "difficult company to
value" in its present form.</p>
<p>But he frets even more about potential flaws in an
alliance of independent companies, especially a case such as
this one, where a full merger apparently was thwarted because
neither partner would cede control. Citing a recent meeting
with big shareholders where Volvo Chairman Pehr Gyllenhammar
repeated a litany of points on which he wouldn't consider
concessions to Renault, Mr. Guldbrand said: "That approach
isn't going to help cooperation."</p>
