	<p class="article-leader">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Biogen Inc. said Merck & Co. licensed
rights to Biogen's hepatitis B vaccine technology from
SmithKline Beecham PLC, which had licensed it earlier from
Biogen.
   Terms weren't disclosed. The licensing agreement covers
production of genetically engineered hepatitis B vaccine
world-wide, except in Japan, Biogen said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The new licensing agreement eliminates the possibility of
a legal battle over rights to the vaccine technology between
SmithKline and Merck, the two main sellers of genetically
engineered vaccines for hepatitis B. The agreement also will
give Biogen a significant additional source of revenue from
its hepatitis B technology at a time when concern is growing
about the liver disease. Biogen said it expects to receive
revenue of more than $20 million in 1990 from its hepatitis B
technology.</p>
<p>In 1987, Biogen, a biotechnology concern, won a broad U.S.
patent on genetically engineered hepatitis B products. In
1988, Biogen licensed SmithKline to make and sell hepatitis B
vaccine products in the U.S. and other countries, except in
Japan. The licensing had set up the possibility of a legal
showdown between SmithKline and Merck, whose vaccine might
have infringed Biogen's patent.</p>
<p>A SmithKline spokesman confirmed the agreement. A Merck
spokesman also confirmed the pact, adding that it's part of a
broader cross-licensing of hepatitis patent rights between
Merck and SmithKline. Merck negotiated the licensing
agreement, he said, "because we didn't see any business sense
in dragging out" a dispute over patent rights to the vaccine.</p>
<p>Hepatitis B is a virally caused liver disease that kills
an estimated 4,000 to 6,000 Americans annually. About two
million people in the U.S. are chronically infected with the
hepatitis B virus, which is responsible for an estimated $600
million to $700 million annually in health-care costs.</p>
<p>The disease, a major cause of liver cancer, is spread by
sexual contact or by exposure to blood of infected persons.
High-risk groups include homosexual men, drug users who share
needles and sexually active heterosexuals. Some 30% of
patients with acute hepatitis B have no known risk factors,
however, according to a recent study.</p>
<p>U.S. efforts to reduce incidence of hepatitis B have
proven ineffective, and recently some doctors have called for
wider vaccination to prevent the disease. "Controlling
hepatitis B will require a change of strategy, away from
targeting those at high risk and toward universal hepatitis B
vaccination," Jay H. Hoofnagle, a doctor at the National
Institutes of Health, recently concluded in an editorial in
the New England Journal of Medicine. Dr. Hoofnagle added,
however, that the cost of the vaccine -- about $120 to
immunize an adult -- may impede efforts to institute
universal vaccination.</p>
