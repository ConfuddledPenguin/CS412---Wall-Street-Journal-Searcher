	<p class="article-leader">FREE-MARKET PRINCIPLES</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A 35-nation East-West economic conference in Bonn
yesterday prepared a document that firmly commits formerly
communist countries to free-market principles.</p>
<p>The document is to be signed tomorrow at the end of the
four-week long Conference on Economic Cooperation in Europe.
It merges key elements of U.S. and European Community
proposals, both of which focused strongly on East bloc
countries' needs to turn their economies around in Western
fashion.</p>
<p>According to the communique, the 35 participating nations
-- the U.S., Canada and all European countries except Albania
-- acknowledge that "increased reliance on market forces"
should improve economic performance. In addition, the
communique commits nations to either implement or maintain a
wide range of free-market-style reforms.</p>
<p>Western delegates said that although the Soviet Union will
sign the document, that country retains some reservations.
"The Soviet Union is not at all as far with its reforms as
its former satellites," said Piet Bukman, minister of foreign
trade of the Netherlands.</p>
<p>FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN KUWAIT</p>
<p>Kuwait's cabinet approved legislation that for the first
time enables foreign residents to invest in Kuwaiti companies
through investment funds. Kuwait's minister of state for
cabinet affairs, Rashed Abdul-Aziz al-Rashed, said that
non-Kuwaitis, subject to certain rules, will be allowed to
use the funds to invest in local equities and real estate.
Economists and bankers said the measure was part of recent
government attempts to revitalize the local economy. Foreign
workers and their families make up 60% of Kuwait's 1.8
million population.

<p>DISPOSABLE LIGHTER INQUIRY</p>
<p>The European Community's executive commission has begun an
inquiry into imports of disposable lighters from China, South
Korea and Thailand after receiving a complaint from the
European Federation of Lighter Manufacturers. The federation
alleged that the Asian manufacturers charge less for their
lighters in the EC than they do in their domestic markets; as
a result, the Asians' unit sales in the 12-nation market rose
to 55.7 million in 1988 from 22 million in 1986. The Asians
had 22% of the market in 1988, valued at seven million
European currency units ($8.4 million).</p>
<p>RESTORING FRANCE'S GARDENS</p>
<p>France's Culture Minister Jack Lang launched a $122
million project to restore some of the nation's most famous
public gardens. The project will involve restoring Paris's
Tuileries, which the daily Le Monde recently described as a
dusty repository for unwanted statues. "The idea with the
Tuileries is to make it . . . so beautiful that it gives a
message of hope to a world asphyxiated by pollution," said
Marc Simonet-Lenglart, a gardening historian in charge of the
project.</p>
<p>HELPING SOUTH AFRICA'S BLACKS</p>
<p>Liberty Life Association of Africa Ltd., one of South
Africa's largest life insurers, announced the formation of a
new social foundation to help the black community. The
foundation will, over a period of five years, spend over 100
million rand (about $38 million) in such areas as improving
educational facilities, housing and support for black
entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>SWEDISH MILK BLOCKADE</p>
<p>Heavily subsidized Swedish farmers, fearing a reduction in
government support, blocked milk and other dairy
product-deliveries to shops across the country. A spokesman
for the Federation of Swedish Farmers said farmers picketed
dairy plants, stopped trucks from making regular pickups and
left shops without fresh supplies. He said he wasn't sure how
long the protest would last. Farmers fear that the Social
Democratic government, shifting towards emphasis on high-tech
industries with high export earnings, will decrease
agriculture support.</p>
<p>JAPANESE MERGERS</p>
<p>In the first three months of 1990, Japanese companies were
involved in a total of 209 merger and acquisition cases,
suggesting that the total for the year could surpass the 660
cases recorded in all of 1989, according to a survey by
Yamaichi Securities Co.</p>
<p>The survey included mergers and acquisitions by Japanese
corporations domestically and overseas, as well as
acquisitions of Japanese concerns by foreign enterprises.
Japanese companies purchased 126 foreign firms in the period,
according to the report, while foreign companies acquired or
merged with only two Japanese companies.</p>
<p>The price tag put on M&A activities in the three months
reached 1.075 trillion yen ($6.82 billion), Yamaichi said.</p>
<p>Japanese companies' overseas M&A activity was strong in
the three months despite the yen's weakness on the
foreign-exchange market, Yamaichi said.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>Trash piles mounted at Madrid's Barajas International
Airport as a weeklong strike by janitors continued. The work
stoppage has left hallways and waiting rooms covered with
refuse, prompting the closing of 30% of the airport's
bathrooms. . . . Cuba's Communist Party daily Granma said the
1989-90 sugar harvest was 600,000 tons behind schedule and
appealed for an exceptional effort from sugar workers to save
it from failure.</p>
