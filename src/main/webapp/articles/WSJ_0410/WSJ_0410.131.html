	<p class="article-leader">West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl wisely ignored the
advice of all his economists, and of Bundesbank chairman
Karl-Otto Poehl when he campaigned in March in East Germany
on behalf of his Christian Democratic Party's eastern
partner, the East German Christian Democrats. In a brilliant
stroke, Mr. Kohl promised a monetary union with the East that
would preserve the hard-earned savings of the people of East
Germany. His learned advisers argued such a promise would be
inflationary. The East German people showed their support for
Mr. Kohl with a dazzling mandate for his conservative
partners.
   Now we hear that the economists may have won after all.
Where Chancellor Kohl had clearly pledged to honor an
exchange rate of one East German mark for one West German
mark in the new union, the Bundesbank now proposes a
two-for-one rate for all savings above 2,000 marks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That is, an East German's life savings of 50,000 East
German marks will be worth only 26,000 West German marks
($15,288), not 50,000 West German marks ($29,400) as
promised. "It's a swindle, pure and simple," said an East
Berliner quoted by Reuters. Of course it is.</p>
<p>Just as Western capitalists are inviting the Eastern
communists to enjoy the benefits of a system that rewards
effort, powerful financial institutions in Europe are playing
Robin Hood with the savings of the most industrious of East
Germans. Why bother changing communists for capitalists?</p>
<p>In the uproar, Chancellor Kohl has at least appointed a
commission to mull this over. The commission should discover
that there is no reason that the one-for-one exchange should
be inflationary. It could easily recommend that all East
German savings that can be legally accounted for be converted
at that rate. The move would energize the East German economy
and set an example for the entire East bloc, including the
Soviet Union.</p>
<p>There are other ways to organize the mark-mark exchange.
No inflation would occur if the government issued bills,
notes and bonds in a combination that satisfied demands for
these in the new monetary union. The Bundesbank would know
the right combination by observing the price of gold against
West German marks as exchanges were made, or by observing the
price of U.S. dollars in West German marks. This is because
all inflations, everywhere, have begun by a rise in the gold
price, or a fall in the value of the currency in question
against a foreign currency of stable value.</p>
<p>The bank would begin by issuing 10-year bonds in exchange
for East German marks. Most East German marks are held as
savings, and in an exchange, the recipients would continue to
wish to hold interest-bearing instruments, not cash. If they
desired cash, the citizens who acquired the 10-year bonds
would be able to get cash for them in the marketplace, from
those willing to give up cash for bonds.</p>
<p>This activity would stretch the supply of currency,
causing an incipient deflation that pressed down the DM price
of gold. This would send a signal to the bank to buy bonds
with new currency until the gold price returned to its
original level. What bonds would it buy? It would buy East
German bonds.</p>
<p>During the conversion period, creditors in East German
marks would be pulling their savings from East Germany to buy
the West German bonds. East Germany would then have to retire
obligations denominated in East German marks and float new
bonds denominated in West German marks.</p>
<p>Will the market buy DM bonds issued by East Germany? Of
course it will. West Germany, in fact, will buy them as a
means of injecting currency into the economy to prevent the
price of gold from falling, as the currency supply is
stretched. The public inside and outside the Germanys will
also buy the bonds, observing that the process of political
integration is now underway, and that as it is completed, the
assets of East Germany will be added to the balance sheet of
West Germany.</p>
<p>As long as the marketplace understands by word and deed
that the Bundesbank is carrying out this strategy with a
determination to keep the West German mark steady against
gold, commodities and the G-7 currencies, matters will
proceed smoothly. The bank can issue five-year bonds and a
schedule of notes as well, to satisfy all the liquidity
demands. With computers and a little creativity, the whole
thing could be done in a matter of weeks. If Ludwig Erhard,
the man who engineered the first steps to West Germany's
economic miracle, were still around as finance minister,
computers would not be needed.</p>
<p>Western economists are concerned that the one-to-one ratio
would cause massive unemployment in East Germany, because
East German exporters would be unable to sell at that ratio.
This, we're told, is because East German workers would be
"paid too high a wage." But these are textbooks assertions
that have validity only in countries where workers are
debtors as well as creditors.</p>
<p>In East Germany, workers have no debts in East German
marks to speak of. Thus, they could readily readjust their
wages downward. They would not have to worry about
liquidating debts while earning a nominally lower wage. They
would accept the nominal change, as their real wages would be
higher than before. And the cost of capital would have fallen
dramatically.</p>
<p>The greatest benefit to the unified economy of a
one-for-one exchange is that it preserves a pool of capital
in the hands of those most likely to make good use of it --
the people who scraped it together bit by bit by the sweat of
their brows. The quickest way to get East Germany running is
by putting liquid assets into their hands, not enriching the
state by having it repudiate its obligations. The accumulated
savings of the East German workers is the stuff of
enterprise, stuff to be preserved.</p>
