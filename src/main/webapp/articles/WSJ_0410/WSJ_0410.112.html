	<p class="article-leader">STATE OF CONNECTICUT -- Moody's Investors Service lowered
its ratings on the state's general-obligation bonds to
double-A from double-A-1. It pointed out that "a
third-successive operating deficit will fully eliminate the
state's remaining budget reserve and leave the state with a
sizable operating imbalance for the fiscal year ending June
30." Last week, Standard & Poor's Corp. lowered its ratings
on $28 billion of Connecticut's general obligation bonds.</p>
