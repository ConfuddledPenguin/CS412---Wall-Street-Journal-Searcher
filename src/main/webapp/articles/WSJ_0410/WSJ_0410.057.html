	<p class="article-leader">NEW DELHI, India -- After four months in office, Prime
Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh seems more intent on undoing
his predecessor's legacy than on establishing a program of
his own, analysts say. In the process, his government is
sending bleak signals to foreign investors.
   Investigations ordered by the new government are putting
pressure on former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, his political
and business allies, and even foreign companies that got too
close to the previous administration.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Singh government hasn't withdrawn the welcome mat for
foreigners that Mr. Gandhi put out in 1984. But its actions
"have not given outside investors reason to have much
confidence," says a Western diplomat.</p>
<p>In the past four months, Mr. Singh's government has:</p>
<p>-- Launched investigations into the alleged payment of
bribes to Indians by Europe's Airbus Industrie consortium; AB
Bofors, an artillery-gun-making unit of Nobel Industries
Sweden AB; and Hawaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft, a West German
submarine manufacturer.</p>
<p>-- Rejected an investment application by Coca-Cola Co.
that the Gandhi government was close to accepting last year.</p>
<p>-- Announced it would seek to void last year's $470
million settlement by Union Carbide Corp. over the 1984
Bhopal gas disaster.</p>
<p>-- Accused a Japanese group of paying illegal commissions
to a government corporation and withdrawn the companies'
access to certain projects.</p>
<p>Some of the investigations could well expose dirty deals.
Charges of corruption hobbled Mr. Gandhi and his party at the
polls last November. Mr. Singh, who ran as a "Mr. Clean"
candidate, vowed to wipe out the perennial grime of Indian
politics.</p>
<p>But analysts say the Singh government is starting to look
vindictive. And while the actions against foreign companies
don't reflect any stated policies of the government or Mr.
Singh, they do seem to reflect a change in attitude.</p>
<p>Mr. Singh has cabinet ministers who approve of
multinational investments and those who condemn them. Finance
Minister Madhu Dandavate is a longtime socialist. Mr. Singh
was the architect of Mr. Gandhi's economic liberalizations,
which encouraged foreign investment. But he comes from a
landed-aristocratic background, where anti-business attitudes
are common.</p>
<p>All of this, taken on top of India's traditional economic
xenophobia, which Mr. Gandhi only dented, is bad news for
foreign investors. "There's a genuine reluctance on this
government's part to entertain too much foreign investment,"
says a New Delhi-based foreign diplomat.</p>
<p>When Mr. Singh came to power in December, he made a
careful effort to avoid the appearance of vindictiveness
toward his predecessor. It was a lesson he learned from
history. In 1977, when the Janata Party took control of the
government from Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, it arrested
Mrs. Gandhi and appointed a commission to investigate her
alleged abuses of power. The actions backfired: Mrs. Gandhi
was seen by many Indians as a martyr, and that helped her
regain power in the 1980 elections. She was assassinated in
1984 and succeeded in office by her son Rajiv.</p>
<p>When Mr. Singh took over from Mr. Gandhi, he said he would
let due process take its course and ordered a range of
investigations. The probe into the purchase of the guns and
submarines, simmering scandals that helped turn the elections
in November, are making headway. In late March, a former
civil-aviation secretary and several middle-level managers of
state-owned Indian Airlines were accused of taking bribes
from Airbus Industrie in the purchase of 31 Airbus A-320s.</p>
<p>Indian newspapers have been cluttered recently with news
of Gandhi-era civil servants being investigated, charged or
dismissed. And in the private sector, the government is
trying to remove the Ambani family, closely connected with
the Gandhis, from the board of a large engineering company it
acquired last year. This could signal an investigation into
all takeovers and stock issues of the past few years, which
could shake the Bombay stock exchange, India's largest.</p>
<p>During the Gandhi years, India's stock markets boomed, as
did takeovers. The Gandhi government delayed bringing
Western-style regulation to the markets, preferring to keep
control through the Ministry of Finance and government-owned
banks and financial institutions, which have large
shareholdings in many companies. As a result, most big stock
deals that took place in the past five years had approval
from New Delhi, analysts say -- and many might now be
reversed.</p>
<p>If hard times have arrived for foreign companies in India,
some have probably earned them with questionable business
practices. In March, the government charged a Japanese group
-- made up of such heavyweights as Sumitomo Corp., Sumitomo
Heavy Industries Ltd., Mitsui & Co., Marubeni Corp., C. Itoh
& Co., Mitsubishi Corp., Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. and
NKK Corp. -- with making kickbacks to win two pipeline
contracts. Their punishment: None will get future government
petroleum contracts.</p>
<p>Union Carbide's four-year struggle to resolve the Bhopal
case seemed concluded in February 1989, when it settled with
India for $470 million. But Mr. Singh made it a campaign
promise to reopen the case. The Supreme Court is now hearing
arguments against the constitutionality of a Gandhi-era law
that made the government sole representative of the victims.</p>
<p>Last month, the government rejected an investment proposal
by Coca-Cola without giving any reasons. Analysts say it was
reacting in part to Mr. Gandhi's 1988 decision to allow
PepsiCo Inc. to sell its soft drink in India. The Singh
government is also taking a second look at Pepsi's project.
The U.S. Embassy in New Delhi warned the government that
canceling an approved investment is more serious than denying
an investment application.</p>
<p>Pepsi has already begun selling snack foods and is to
launch its soft drink this month. In Parliament last month, a
member demanded to know if Pepsi had paid kickbacks to the
Gandhi government; a Singh minister said he was unaware of
any kickbacks. But he said the government was investigating
whether Pepsi will be allowed to use its brand name, which
the company had planned to do.</p>
<p>The wrangling over Coke and Pepsi is reminiscent of the
expulsion of Coca-Cola from India in 1977, which helped erase
India from the foreign-investment map for nearly a decade.
Coke's problems with India began while Mrs. Gandhi was in
power, but the expulsion took place under the Janata
government in 1978. The expulsion was championed by George
Fernandez, once again a powerful minister, who has publicly
stated he wants Pepsi thrown out.</p>
