	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Ford Motor Co.'s British unit said it decided to
reduce its proposed #725 million ($1.19 billion) investment
in an engine plant in South Wales to #500 million.
   Ford said the outstanding #225 million will be diverted to
the company's production plant in Cologne, West Germany. The
company cited the "unreliability" of supplies from the United
Kingdom engine plants and other factors as the reason for its
decision to switch the investment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As a result of the switch, the South Wales plant, which
was initially expected to produce 850,000 of the company's
new multivalve lean-burn engines, will now produce only
300,000 engines a year.</p>
<p>Ford's South Wales plant employs 14,000 hourly workers and
produces 50,000 Escort, Orion and Fiesta car engines a year.
The spokesman said jobs at the plant won't be put at risk due
to the decision to switch the investment.</p>
<p>Commenting on Ford's proposal to create more than 3,000
new jobs from the investment plan, a company spokeswoman said
only that "the position of those jobs is as yet unclear."</p>
<p>She repeated company claims, however, that the British
plants affected may still be granted fresh production
contracts if supply and productivity problems that have
afflicted the unit can be ironed out.</p>
