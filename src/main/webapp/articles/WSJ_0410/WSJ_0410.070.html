	<p class="article-leader">Time Warner Inc. agreed to help arrange financing for
about half of the $1.2 billion that Pathe Communications
Corp. will need to complete its acquisition of MGM/UA
Communications Co. -- even if the debt-laden Time Warner must
provide the money itself.
   Time Warner's Warner Bros. studio said it would "arrange
for or provide on a bridge loan basis" a $650 million bank
loan to MGM/UA. The sum would be guaranteed by Time Warner,
which itself already carries $10.6 billion in debt from its
recent merger, and would be secured by the UA film library.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The announcement lessened concern that Pathe, headed by
Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti, wouldn't be able to
complete the financing for the acquisition. Yesterday, Pathe
made the second of four $50 million payments that are
required by the purchase agreement.</p>
<p>MGM/UA shares closed at $18.25, up $1.675 in composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Pathe, an
entertainment company, is offering $20 a share.</p>
<p>"It certainly removes a great deal of the skepticism that
the transaction could be completed," said Jeff Logsdon, an
analyst at Crowell, Weedon & Co. in Los Angeles. "Now half
the foundation is in place, and Pathe has a better-than-even
chance of buying the company."</p>
<p>The financial assistance apparently was offered in return
for what could grow into a lucrative "support services"
agreement for Warner Bros. The studio will handle Pathe and
MGM/UA releases for theatrical, television and home-video
distribution. Warner would take what some sources said may
amount to about half the usual 25% to 30% distribution fee
used in most movie-distribution deals, while bearing none of
the risks of promoting a film that ends up as a flop.</p>
<p>Moreover, Time Warner also obtained the right to acquire
warrants that would amount to a 20% stake in the combined
Pathe-MGM/UA company at some point in the future. Specific
terms and prices weren't disclosed.</p>
<p>But some Wall Street analysts privately questioned why a
company with a large debt burden of its own would risk
getting involved in the takeover of MGM/UA, which has been
the target of several scuttled merger attempts in the past.</p>
<p>Moreover, Time Warner's involvement may include an
additional $200 million -- above and beyond the $650 million
in bridge-loan money. In an interview that appeared Monday in
Les Echos, France's leading business daily, Mr. Parretti was
quoted as saying he expects Time Warner to contribute a total
$850 million to the bid for MGM/UA. Executives close to the
transaction explained the higher figure by saying Time Warner
is expected to provide an additional $200 million for movie
production at MGM/UA after the acquisition is completed.</p>
<p>A Warner spokesman had no immediate comment on the $200
million sum. He also countered analysts' doubts about Time
Warner's role by saying that the distribution deal would
generate substantial cash flow and help Time Warner finances.</p>
<p>In addition, some industry observers noted that by having
the $650 million secured by the United Artists film library,
Time Warner could pick up the entire film vault for that
price -- about half its actual worth -- should the merger go
through and the combined companies later collapse.</p>
<p>The Les Echos interview also quoted Mr. Parretti as saying
Pathe is currently talking to European and U.S. banks about
arranging $300 million in loans for the acquisition. And the
story notes that Pathe recently sold British and Dutch
theaters for more than $200 million.</p>
<p>The Time Warner announcement yesterday describes a
convoluted three-step process for the loan. First, Time
Warner would make the loan to MGM/UA, which in turn would
acquire certain assets of Pathe Communications. Pathe would
then use the money MGM/UA paid it to turn around and acquire
all of MGM/UA.</p>
<p>"It's a classic American leveraged buy-out," Mr. Parretti
said in the French interview. "You pay with what you buy. I
don't understand why all the press is wondering how we will
finance the operations."</p>
<p>The announcement seems to end the recent confusion over
which studio would be distributing films made by the Pathe
Entertainment unit of Pathe Communications. The Pathe unit is
headed by Alan Ladd Jr., a former top executive at MGM/UA,
and has been working on a string of new movies.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time Warner has backed Pathe,
formerly called Cannon Group Inc. Four years ago, Cannon
received a $75 million investment from Warner, saving the
company from a financial crisis. In return, Warner received
certain shares, warrants and options. Moreover, Steve Ross,
co-chairman of Time Warner, and Mr. Parretti are friends.</p>
