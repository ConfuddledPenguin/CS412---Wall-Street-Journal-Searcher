	<p class="article-leader">Amre Inc. said that a management group that for several
months has been considering making an offer to take the
company private won't make a bid after all.
   The Dallas-based direct marketer of home-improvement
products said that its president, Steven D. Bedowitz; its
executive vice president, Robert Levin; and its senior vice
president, Ronald L. Wagner decided over the weekend that an
offer for the company wasn't in the best interests of Amre's
minority shareholders, the company itself or the management
group. The group said its decision wasn't influenced by
questions about whether it could get financing for an offer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Just last week, the group said it planned to make an offer
to acquire the 44% of Amre it didn't already own for $8.75 a
share, or roughly $54.3 million. The group met with a special
committee of the company's directors to discuss its expected
bid.</p>
