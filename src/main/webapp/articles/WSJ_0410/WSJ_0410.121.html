	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- American Telephone & Telegraph Co. is expected
to announce today an agreement to transfer its computer
terminal business to Memorex International N.V. in return for
a minority stake in the computer company, according to
individuals close to the negotiations.
   Under the agreement, AT&T will transfer its IBM compatible
dumb terminal business to Memorex-Telex, Tulsa, Okla. In
return, AT&T could receive 5% to 10% in the unit's parent,
Memorex. These individuals also say AT&T will get a seat on
Memorex's board.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Use of dumb terminals, which need to be hooked to powerful
central computers to operate, has been slowing as corporate
customers have begun to switch to personal computers linked
to networks.</p>
<p>But the real attraction for AT&T may be Memorex's
international presence. AT&T has been eager to boost its
share of the international computer market where AT&T is
almost invisible. And Memorex, which posted revenue of $2.24
billion for 1989, has extensive overseas distributions, and
has 10,000 employees world-wide.</p>
<p>AT&T's computer business mostly involves minicomputers,
personal computers, networking products and software.
Terminals account for a small percentage of the company's
business.</p>
