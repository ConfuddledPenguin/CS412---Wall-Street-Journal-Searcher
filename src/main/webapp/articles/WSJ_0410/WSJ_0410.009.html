	<p class="article-leader">Bruce Perry has tacked a drawing of a fox caught in a trap
over his desk. It's a grim joke on his work of the past 20
years, an unauthorized biography of Malcolm X that draws on
newly discovered letters written by the black-power activist.
Just as Mr. Perry was preparing to publish his book, a new
judicial interpretation of the copyright law came down -- and
now none of the letters can be used.
   "I'm in the process of emasculating parts of my own book,"
Mr. Perry said. "I heard a terrible story about how an animal
caught in a trap chews off his leg to save his own life.
That's what I'm doing here."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The letters -- including Malcolm X's correspondence to an
unknown first love -- were a cornerstone of Mr. Perry's book.
But thanks to a series of rulings that have made it legally
dangerous to quote even the smallest amounts of unpublished
material without the copyright owner's consent, Mr. Perry
could see his book barred from publication by Malcolm X's
estate if even a trace of the letters remain.</p>
<p>Mr. Perry, like every other author or journalist, now must
operate within a highly restricted new definition of the
doctrine of fair use. The Supreme Court started the
juggernaut rolling in 1985, by ruling that the Nation had
overstepped fair-use protections when it printed excerpts
from a stolen copy of Gerald Ford's yet-unpublished memoirs,
on the grounds that first publication is the writer's
prerogative. In 1986, J.D. Salinger sued to block publication
of a biography that quoted from his unpublished letters.
Finding that the market value of Mr. Salinger's letters was
at stake, the court ordered the quotations expunged and even
barred close paraphrases.</p>
<p>Then, last April, New Era Publications International, a
Danish press affiliated with the Church of Scientology, tried
to stop Henry Holt & Co. from publishing a book that used
excerpts from L. Ron Hubbard's private diary and letters.
Although New Era filed too late to have the book stopped, the
U.S. Second Circuit Court agreed that the book could hurt the
market value of any future authorized biography.
Subsequently, four members of the court went still further,
stating that there could be virtually no unauthorized use of
unpublished material -- "even if the work is a matter of . .
. high public concern." The Supreme Court refused to rehear
the case in February, dashing many publishers' and writers'
hopes for a reversal.</p>
<p>"I think {the decision} has universal ramifications for
scholarship," said Sanford Thatcher, director of Penn State
Press, who tracks copyright issues for the Association of
American University Presses. "As these cases develop, these
trustees will see they have power more and more, and can call
for high fees or deny permission altogether, and that's going
to stop scholarship in its tracks."</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone sees it that way. The people who
wrote the letters, diaries or notebooks -- not to mention
their spouses and heirs -- sometimes fail to understand why
other writers should be able to exploit them for personal
gain, or why the public's right to know should take
precedence over their privacy and property rights.</p>
<p>"The copyright law says you can't protect Mr. Hubbard's
ideas or facts about him, but you really can protect his
creative expression," said Michael Lee Hertzberg, lawyer for
New Era, "that's one thing that Mr. Hubbard and any writer
really is entitled to."</p>
<p>But publishers and many writers charge that the court's
rulings have effectively transformed the copyright law into a
more powerful weapon than ever for public figures and their
estates desiring to control or even thwart books they'd
rather not see written. In many cases, the documents in
question are on open and sometimes unrestricted deposit at
university libraries and archives.</p>
<p>Now writers such as Mr. Perry, who does not have the
copyright owner's cooperation, find themselves caught in a
Catch-22 in which even requesting permission can expose them
to legal action. Trade publishers are turning the job of
editing critical biographies and other high-risk books over
to their legal departments, where unauthorized quotations
either are purged or drastically reduced.</p>
<p>"You start looking at very practical factors -- like what
would be the likely plaintiff's means of suing us and the
author," said Amy Jenkins, associate counsel for Warner
Publishing Inc., which now is being sued by Richard Wright's
widow over a published biography that quotes from six
unpublished letters. Doubly cautious, Warner has even begun
to require that all writers provide taped or written
permission for interview excerpts, on the theory that a taped
or transcribed conversation also is subject to copyright.</p>
<p>Academic presses, with their shallower pockets, aren't so
gun-shy yet. "I don't think we've got anywhere near as much
at stake," said Walter Lippincott, director of Princeton
University Press. "With most academic books we are printing
1,500 or fewer copies, and at that level nobody really cares
. . . the books we publish get such little attention on the
most part."</p>
<p>But that wasn't the case at the University of Tennessee
Press back in 1986, when director Carol Orr decided not to
publish Victor Kramer's critical selection of James Agee's
early work after Mary Newman, trustee of the Agee estate,
objected to his use of unpublished, "second-rate" writings
that had been acquired by the University of Texas in 1964.
Although Mr. Kramer had received formal permission from a
previous trustee, Ms. Orr decided to shelve the book, the
product of 20 years of research, rather than risk a lawsuit.</p>
<p>"I'm not entirely in disagreement with the author and the
author's heirs when they say they have a right to control the
material and how it's used," Ms. Orr said. "If it weren't an
important principle, then all kinds of unscrupulous people
could use the material for their purposes."</p>
<p>Ms. Newman's attorney, Mark Budwig, maintains that Mr.
Kramer wants to reprint so much of Mr. Agee's work that he
has gone beyond fair use as it was defined even before the
Hubbard case. However, Martha Pearson, one of Mr. Kramer's
three lawyers, said efforts to compromise on the length of
the excerpts have led nowhere. The Hubbard decision may prove
to be a "major factor," she said, in the legal battle over
publication.</p>
<p>Fearful of Mr. Kramer's fate, many writers are
deliberately censoring their most original material, and
trimming the scope of their work accordingly. Linda
Wagner-Martin's literary biography of Sylvia Plath became
"just a biography," she says, when Plath's estate insisted
that massive amounts of published and unpublished writings be
removed. James Reston Jr. thought he had hit pay dirt when he
discovered letters between John Connally and Lyndon B.
Johnson, but he used only the tiniest excerpts in his
biography of Connally rather than risk an injunction. Without
this original material, and with close paraphrasing
off-limits too, a book can lose its immediacy and force.</p>
<p>"In one letter, he says `I died inside,'" Mr. Perry said,
quoting Malcolm X. "Now how do I paraphrase that in such a
way to convey that pain, without getting sued?"</p>
<p>Since the Supreme Court showed no sympathy in this regard,
publishers, writers and academics gathered in Washington last
month to lobby Congress. In response to them, Rep. Robert
Kastenmeier and Sen. Paul Simon both have introduced bills to
eliminate the distinction between published and unpublished
works where fair use of quotations is concerned.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Second Circuit Court may undermine even
this effort at mitigating its previous decisions. This month,
the court will consider whether to uphold a ruling in favor
of New Era Publications, which managed to enjoin another book
about Mr. Hubbard -- this time, by challenging the author's
use of the Scientology founder's published writings. Perhaps
it's time for someone to start writing the biographies of the
judges of the Second Circuit Court. Their attacks on fair use
certainly have made them fair game for the muckraking
scholarship still legal in this country.</p>
