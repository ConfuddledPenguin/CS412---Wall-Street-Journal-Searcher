	<p class="article-leader">SUNNYVALE, Calif. -- Advanced Micro Devices Inc. said it
expected to post flat first-quarter revenue, lower than the
company had anticipated.
   However, Advanced Micro said an extraordinary gain from a
previously announced technology transfer with Sony Corp.
pushed first-quarter net income above the nine cents a share
it earned in the year-earlier period.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Advanced Micro said revenue was about the same as the
$269.6 million the semiconductor concern generated in 1989's
first quarter. It didn't give an estimate for per-share
earnings. The company blamed the revenue results on
lower-than-anticipated prices on chip products, notably
Eproms, a type of chip that is one of Advanced Micro's main
products.</p>
<p>Advanced Micro has been struggling for many quarters to
overcome problems stemming from a broad slump in the chip
industry and some basic strategic errors. Its results for the
latest quarter mirror the problems encountered by several
other chip makers.</p>
<p>W.J. Sanders, chairman and chief executive officer, said
orders picked up late in the period, especially in
international markets. He said that increase, coupled with
already-implemented cost cutting measures, should result in
better operating margins in the current quarter.</p>
<p>In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Advanced Micro
closed at $8.50, down 37.5 cents.</p>
