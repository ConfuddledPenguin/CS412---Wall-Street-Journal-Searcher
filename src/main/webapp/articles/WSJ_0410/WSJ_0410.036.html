   For the Home, in Deed</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>THE AMERICAN DREAM of owning a home apparently encompasses
a lot of the things that go inside.</p>
<p>Homeowners in the U.S. are more likely than renters to
have washers, dryers, dishwashers, and even telephones,
according to a new housing survey from the Census Bureau.
Refrigerators and stoves are virtually universal for both
owners and renters. But only 86% of renters have a phone,
compared with 97% of owners. Homeowners are more than twice
as likely as renters to have washers, 93% vs. 42%.
Eighty-four percent have dryers, compared with 33% of
renters. Over half -- 55% -- have dishwashers, compared with
31% of renters.</p>
<p>Homeowners have more money to buy such things. They also
have more room for them. Nearly half -- 47% -- of homeowners
have a separate dining room, compared with 24% of renters.
Forty-three percent have two or more living or recreation
rooms, compared with just 9% of renters. To keep this space
comfortable, owners are more likely to have air conditioning
and fireplaces.</p>
<p>Owners also are more likely to have outdoor space. Fully
83% of homeowners have a porch, deck, patio, or balcony,
compared with 61% of renters. Seventy-two percent have a
garage or carport, compared with 29% of renters.</p>
<p>When it comes to waste, however, renters are nearly tied
with owners. Thirty-six percent of renters have a disposal in
their kitchen sink, close to the 38% share of homeowners.</p>
<p>Travel Paths Diverge</p>
<p>With Older Americans</p>
<p>EVERYONE KNOWS that the retired are a good travel market.
But there are different travel segments within the older
population.</p>
<p>A new study from New York-based Mediamark Research found
that 52% of adults aged 55 and older took a domestic trip of
200 miles or more in the past year, close to the average for
all adults. They make up 26% of the total adult travel
market.</p>
<p>Most mature Americans are retired, which means they have
the time to take longer trips. They are 10% more likely than
the average adult to go away for one to two weeks, and 50%
more likely to go away for more than two weeks.</p>
<p>Many of those aged 55 to 59 still work, and they dominate
the short-trip market. Forty-four percent went away for a
week or less, compared with 35% of all older Americans.
People 60 to 64 dominate midlength trips. Seventeen percent
were away for one to two weeks, compared with 14% of all
older Americans. Ten percent of those 65 to 69 were away for
more than two weeks, compared with less than 9% of all mature
Americans.</p>
<p>The younger segment of the older market is more likely to
travel than the older segment, probably because they have
more money and better health. Twenty-one percent of those
aged 55 to 64 took at least one trip outside the continental
U.S. in the past year, compared with 18% of all mature
Americans.</p>
<p>There is something of an age limit to traveling. Those
aged 75 and older are less likely than average to travel.
Even so, 41% of these oldest Americans took a domestic trip
in the past year, and a vigorous 12% went abroad.</p>
<p>One Roof Overhead,</p>
<p>Separate Costs Below</p>
<p>THE OLD SAYING that two can live as cheaply as one is a
slight exaggeration. In fact, two-person households spend 68%
more than one-person households, according to a 1988 Bureau
of Labor Statistics survey.</p>
<p>It's true that some expenses are more economical when
shared. Two-person households spend just 53% more than
single-person households on housing. In dollar terms, this
comes out to $4,074 per person, compared with $5,335 for
one-person households. Two-person households spend only 48%
more on clothing than single-person households; they spend
$663 per person, compared with $893 for singles.</p>
<p>Two-person households spend twice as much as one-person
households on health care and on personal insurance and
pensions. They also have twice as many cars on average, and
spend twice as much on transportation, $5,403 compared with
$2,700.</p>
<p>Alcohol is the only major spending category for which the
old adage is true. The average two-person household spent
$278 on alcohol in 1988. So did the average single-person
household.</p>
<p>Middle Age at 26.1:</p>
<p>Hispanics Are Youngest</p>
<p>HISPANICS ARE the youngest population in the U.S., with a
median age of 26.1. New Census Bureau estimates for 1989 show
that fully 68% of Hispanics are under age 35, compared with
54% of the general population. Only 5% of Hispanics are aged
65 and older, compared with 12% of the total population.</p>
<p>Blacks are slightly older than Hispanics. Their median age
in 1989 was 27.7. Sixty-three percent of blacks are under 35,
and 8% are aged 65 and older. Asians and native Americans are
slightly older than blacks, with a median age of 29. Some 61%
are under 35, and 7% are 65 and older.</p>
<p>Whites are the oldest population group in the U.S., with a
median age of 33.6. Some 53% are under age 35, and another
13% are aged 65 and older. Whites also have a
higher-than-average share of middle-aged people. Thirty-four
percent of whites are aged 35 to 64, compared with 32% of
other races, 28% of blacks, and 27% of Hispanics.</p>
<p>The young median age of Hispanics is attributed to higher
fertility and immigration rates. Blacks also have higher
fertility rates than whites. Asians have higher immigration
rates.</p>
