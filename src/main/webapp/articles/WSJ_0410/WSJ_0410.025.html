	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- President Bush invites him to the White
House and takes his counsel seriously.
   "He's been my friend since 1981," says Vice President Dan
Quayle. "I enjoy his company."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"He deserves credit because he is willing to work out
differences whenever possible to come up with a workable
package," says John Sununu, White House chief of staff.</p>
<p>Who is this extraordinary confidant of the conservatives
who run the country?</p>
<p>Stand up and be recognized, Edward M. Kennedy,
Massachusetts Democrat, chief keeper of the liberal flame --
and counselor to the president, deal-maker with the chief of
staff and friend of the vice president.</p>
<p>"It's different these days," says Sen. Kennedy, chairman
of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee. "President
Bush has his views and he stands by them, but he's willing to
listen and sometimes to agree with us."</p>
<p>Mr. Kennedy concedes this is an unusual experience -- he
never found common ground during the eight years Ronald
Reagan was president. (Nor did he find much to share with
Jimmy Carter, he might have added.)</p>
<p>In recent weeks, Mr. Kennedy has maintained a hectic
public pace, partly in reaction to a spate of newspaper and
magazine stories that have commented on his drinking and
womanizing. Critics say the pace is an effort to bolster his
fading image.</p>
<p>The relationship between Mr. Bush and Sen. Kennedy is to
some degree tribal. Though the president is WASPish and Mr.
Kennedy is Irish, they are both New Englanders and both came
of age in privileged surroundings. Mr. Kennedy notes that the
president's father, Prescott, served in the Senate with his
brother, John. In fact, says the senator, when he was a
University of Virginia law student and needed a speaker to
address a student forum, Prescott Bush volunteered, as a kind
of tribal duty.</p>
<p>President Bush has opened his house to receptions for the
Special Olympics, a Kennedy-supported program for mentally
impaired athletes, "and my sister Eunice and I appreciate
that," Mr. Kennedy says. Both the president and Mr. Sununu
have been helpful in trying to resolve upkeep and maintenance
problems at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts,
according to Mr. Kennedy.</p>
<p>They exchange convivial notes from time to time. Sen.
Kennedy points out one of the presidential notes -- he's
framed it and hung it on the wall. That exchange, he says,
started with a photograph a constituent mailed to him shortly
after the last Democratic national convention, when Mr.
Kennedy blistered Mr. Bush with the chorus line, "Where was
George?" The photo shows a highway billboard with bold print
saying "Where's George? In the White House, Teddy]"</p>
<p>Mr. Kennedy mailed the photo to Mr. Bush, who replied with
the thank-you note that's framed on the wall ("Ted," it
concludes, "have a wonderful family Thanksgiving. George").</p>
<p>Recently, the relationship has become more substantial.
After returning from a trip to Moscow, where he talked to
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, Sen. Kennedy was invited
to the White House to make a personal report to President
Bush about the Soviet Union's problems with breakaway
Lithuania. Mr. Kennedy told the president that Mr. Gorbachev
was under heavy pressure to take a hard line, and he urged
caution in dealing with the situation, a view that Mr. Bush
adopted.</p>
<p>Mr. Kennedy's comfortable relationships with Messrs. Bush,
Quayle and Sununu is hard for doctrinaire conservatives to
swallow. But Mr. Kennedy as a presidential adviser is far
worse. "Lithuania," says Howard Phillips, chairman of the
Conservative Caucus, "is the defining moment for the Bush
presidency -- and he is allowing Kennedy to define it for
him. He {the president} is laying the groundwork here for a
primary challenge in 1992."</p>
<p>Vice President Quayle concedes it isn't always easy being
a friend of a man conservatives dislike. "I take a lot of
heat from my conservative friends," he says. "I tell them,
`Look, it's one of those friendships you strike up in the
Senate. He isn't buying into my philosophy and I'm not buying
into his.'"</p>
<p>The Bush-Kennedy relationship is a formal one; the
Kennedy-Quayle relationship is informal, more a high-fiving,
rib-poking affair between two politicians who empathize over
the lumps they take in the press (Mr. Kennedy for his alleged
rambunctious personal life; Mr. Quayle for his alleged
intellectual shortcomings).</p>
<p>It serves Mr. Kennedy's interests to be seen as a White
House intimate, just as it serves Mr. Quayle's interests to
be taken seriously by Mr. Kennedy.</p>
<p>They've been to each other's houses for dinner and every
now and again Mr. Kennedy drops by the vice president's
office for breakfast and a little chat. "We talk about a lot
of things," says Mr. Quayle, "but we don't commiserate a lot
about each other's bad press."</p>
<p>Back on Feb. 22, Mr. Kennedy dropped by for breakfast --
to be greeted by a birthday cake. It was his 58th birthday,
and Mr. Quayle's birthday gift was an invitation to join him
the following month as an official delegate to the
inauguration of Chile's new democratically elected
government. Mr. Kennedy already had been invited, but he says
he was touched by the invitation to be part of the official
party.</p>
<p>"He was very constructive {on the trip}," says Mr. Quayle.
"He avoided emphasizing the differences in our views on South
America."</p>
<p>Sen. Kennedy, some say, was more supportive of Mr. Quayle
than another official in the party, Bernard Aronson,
assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs and a
favorite of Secretary of State James Baker. The vice
president and Mr. Baker don't always share a comfortable
relationship.</p>
<p>During a flight from Barbados to Chile, Mr. Kennedy came
swinging down the aisle wearing a New England Patriots
football jersey. The name on the back was "Quayle," the
number, "96."</p>
<p>"Everybody got a big laugh out of that," says the vice
president.</p>
<p>When the trip was over, Mr. Kennedy wrote a two-page
letter to Mr. Bush, praising, among other things, Mr.
Quayle's performance. "I thought he represented the country
well," says Mr. Kennedy. "I thought he made the
administration's points well. He gave as good as he got. He's
serious about his job."</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest surprise of all is the way Sen.
Kennedy, from liberal Massachusetts, and Mr. Sununu, the
White House chief of staff and former governor of tightfisted
New Hampshire, work together. They have gone head to head on
bills to aid the disabled and to raise the minimum wage, and
they are still grappling with child-care and civil-rights
legislation. "He {Sununu} argues his points well, and he's
fair," says Mr. Kennedy.</p>
<p>The two men -- opposites in temperament and ideology --
sometimes have managed to accommodate each other, and that's
been a surprise to both of them.</p>
