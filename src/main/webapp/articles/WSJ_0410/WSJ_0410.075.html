	<p class="article-leader">Sir James Goldsmith was dealt a blow in his attempt to
acquire B.A.T Industries PLC, as California insurance
regulators declined to approve a change in control of B.A.T's
Farmers Group Inc. insurance unit.
   Sir James and his Hoylake Investments Ltd. have proposed
that if his acquisition of B.A.T goes through, the Farmers
unit would immediately be sold to Axa-Midi Assurances of
France for $4.5 billion. Sir James has proposed to offer 13
billion pounds (US$21.35 billion) for B.A.T, the British
tobacco, retailing, paper and financial services giant. He
brought the French insurer on as a partner last summer in the
hopes that U.S. insurance regulators would be more likely to
approve a transfer of ownership of Farmers to another
insurer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In denying the applications of Hoylake and Axa, California
insurance commissioner Roxani Gillespi noted that Hoylake has
"no real offer" for B.A.T on the table, having dropped its
formal bid last September because of complications with
British takeover law.</p>
<p>As for Axa-Midi's application, Ms. Gillespi said that
"while Axa-Midi has an outstanding European record, the
leverage of this deal is such that it would endanger"
Farmers.</p>
<p>Axa chairman Claude Bebear said he was encouraged that
"California recognized our competence as an owner for
Farmers," even though it had "reservations for our plan of
financing." He declined to say whether Axa would appeal the
decision to California state court, though he said "we are
continuing to seek approvals in the other states." Hoylake
said it would study the California decision and make an
announcement in a few days as to how it will proceed. "We are
committed to aggressively pursuing the regulatory approval
process in the U.S.," a Hoylake spokesman said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, B.A.T and Farmers were celebrating the victory.
"We look forward to getting on with managing our business," a
B.A.T spokesman said.</p>
<p>However, the negative ruling is by no means a death knell,
as B.A.T and Farmers well know. When B.A.T was trying to
acquire Farmers in 1988, the California insurance
commissioner ruled against its $4.5 billion hostile tender
offer, but a state court later overturned the ruling on
appeal by B.A.T. Once Farmers agreed to accept a sweetened
$5.2 billion offer from B.A.T, regulators in other states who
had rejected B.A.T readily gave their approval.</p>
<p>Hearings on the proposed change in control of Farmers have
already been conducted in Illinois, Oregon, Idaho and
Washington, but no decisions have been issued. Texas
regulators began hearings yesterday, and regulators in
Kansas, Ohio and Arizona haven't yet scheduled hearings.</p>
<p>The regulatory hurdles have proved a linchpin in B.A.T's
takeover defense. In September, Sir James was forced to
shelve his original #13.4 billion bid for B.A.T, as the
lengthy regulatory process promised to drag on well beyond
Britain's usual 60day takeover timetable. Sir James received
an unusual extension from Britain's Takeover Panel allowing
him to bid again within 21 days of receiving approval from
the U.S. regulators.</p>
<p>B.A.T has also embarked on a major divestiture plan to
fight off Sir James, with plans to shrink itself to just
tobacco and financial services operations by spinning off or
selling more than #3 billion in assets by the end of June. It
is auctioning off its U.S. retail chains Saks Fifth Avenue
and Marshall Field.</p>
