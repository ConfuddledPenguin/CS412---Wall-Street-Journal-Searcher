	<p class="article-leader">George Bush's warning to Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze against the use of force in Lithuania was both
diplomatic and ambiguous -- a bit too much of both. It
stressed the importance of the U.S.-Soviet relationship to
the U.S. It could have laid more emphasis on the importance
of U.S. friendship to a foundering Soviet Union.
   The President explained that U.S. relations with the
U.S.S.R. affect the lives of people all over the world. No
one quarrels with that. He cited arms control, human rights,
the exodus of Soviet Jews and regional questions. "I want to
keep that going." So, on Lithuania, "we're not dictating, or
attempting to -- couldn't do that anyway -- but we're saying
we want it to be peaceful."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>To be sure, subtle diplomacy often is more effective than
the public loudspeaker. The administration also has a point
in wanting to treat the Lithuanian secession carefully so as
to not endanger the chances for a Soviet-Lithuanian accord.
But the U.S. has publicly favored Lithuanian
self-determination. It doesn't necessarily further that cause
by merely warning the Soviets against the "use of force."</p>
<p>One might argue that the Soviets already are using force,
having beefed up army and KGB forces in Lithuania and having
stormed several key buildings. Moscow also is sealing
Lithuanian borders to make it difficult for the outside world
to know whether or not force is being used. It isn't
necessary to employ a lot of force. The Lithuanians have
little choice but to behave peacefully, at least for the time
being. The Russians have most of the weapons.</p>
<p>Surely Lithuanian independence is worth a more vigorous
U.S. defense. The U.S. never recognized the legitimacy of
Stalin's 1940 rape of the Baltic states. So what is it
prepared to do about it now that the issue has come to a
head? Are there more important issues in the world than the
right of self-determination?</p>
<p>Indeed, that is what is fundamentally involved in several
of those other sensitive U.S.-Soviet issues President Bush
cited, such as Soviet backing for oppressive regional
regimes, the emigration demands of Soviet Jews and, for that
matter, the entire human rights panoply. If the U.S. is going
to walk on eggs in defending self-determination for the
Baltic peoples, in what way does that further its moral
position in dealing with the other issues?</p>
<p>But, goes the counterargument, look at how the Soviets are
so forthcoming elsewhere. Didn't Mr. Shevardnadze say in
Washington that the Soviets would not insist on a "neutral"
Germany after unification?</p>
<p>First of all, the Soviets are no more eager than the West
to have a unified Germany that is unattached to any alliance.
They want a Germany with strings and Mr. Shevardnadze didn't
say that none of those strings would be Soviet. He did not
concede to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's insistence
that Germany will be a part of NATO. The Soviets are hardly
in a position to get tough with Germany. As they try to save
their economy by drawing trade and investment from the West,
they need Germany as badly as they need the U.S. But neither
are they playing dead.</p>
<p>There also is the well-worn argument that Mr. Gorbachev
must be treated kindly because his own position is precarious
and he might be superseded by a Soviet hard-liner. One could
rephrase that and give it some validity. It is true that Mr.
Gorbachev is a skillful politician and the world is safer
having a skillful rather than a clumsy politician in his
chair. But there is little basis for the notion that the West
has to prop up Mr. Gorbachev by offering him concessions. No
Russian czars have had more power than he now commands.</p>
<p>The West should assert its most valued principles and let
Mr. Gorbachev deal with his domestic politics. That requires
an understanding that Mr. Gorbachev will give only what he
has to give. He won't give self-determination unless there is
significant pressure from the U.S.</p>
