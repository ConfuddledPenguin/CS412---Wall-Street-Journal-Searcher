	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Budd Co. agreed to pay $1.5 million to
settle Labor Department charges of workplace noise and other
safety and health violations at the company's Philadelphia
automotive-panel plant.
   Budd also agreed to set up corporatewide worker-hearing
conservation and record-keeping programs, the department's
Occupational Safety and Health Administration said. Budd,
based in Troy, Mich., and a unit of Thyssen AG in West
Germany, agreed to the settlement without admitting the
alleged violations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>OSHA last December proposed penalties totaling $3.3
million against Budd for the alleged Philadelphia violations.
But as with many accords, the regulatory agency agreed to the
smaller fine in return for a commitment for corporatewide
abatement of the alleged unsafe practices.</p>
<p>At the time, the $3.3 million was the fourth-largest
proposed penalty for a company in OSHA history. The agency
had charged Budd with noise-rule violations, including
failure to tell workers they had suffered hearing loss and to
have doctors review problem cases; with violations of
engineering-control regulations; and with willful violations
of record-keeping rules, such as the required notation of
medical treatment for injuries.</p>
<p>The agreement calls for Budd to reduce excessive noise at
the Philadelphia plant by April 30, 1991, and to begin a
hearing-conservation program at all its facilities by Sept.
1, 1990.</p>
<p>Budd also will audit injury and illness record-keeping
since Jan. 1, 1987, to see that the records comply with
federal requirements, and to keep future records in
compliance, OSHA said.</p>
