	<p class="article-leader">The nation's machine tool builders have earned sparse
profits during the current economic expansion, and so far
1990 doesn't signal any improvement.
   Earnings in the March 31 quarter will reflect weaker
orders in recent months, continued tough price competition
and restructuring costs at two large producers. Builders hope
for a stronger second half, but that's contingent on improved
orders.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Machine tools are complex, parts-making machines such as
metal-cutting lathes and metal-forming presses. They shape
metal parts as diverse as refrigerator doors and industrial
bearings.</p>
<p>Since mid-1989, uncertainty about the economic outlook has
caused many durable-goods makers to hold back on buying
machine tools. Auto and truck companies, auto-parts producers
and defense contractors, all major machine tool users, have
slashed orders, as have some small machine shops. There are
exceptions, such as producers of commercial aircraft, who are
ordering briskly.</p>
<p>However, in the eight months ended Feb. 28, orders placed
with U.S. machine-tool plants dropped 25% from the
year-earlier period, according to NMTBA-Association for
Manufacturing Technology, a McLean, Va., trade group.</p>
<p>Shipments held up well through the end of last year, but
the backlog of unshipped orders is dwindling, forcing
production cutbacks.</p>
<p>Based on current production schedules, Cincinnati Milacron
Inc., the nation's largest machine-tool producer, expects
much lower profits for the first quarter. The second quarter
will be better than the first, the company says, but probably
will be below a year earlier. Besides the lower orders,
Milacron's first quarter will reflect some continued costs of
a restructuring of production.</p>
<p>Milacron had profit from operations of 23 cents a share in
the 1989 first quarter and 16 cents a share in the second.
Tax credits brought net income for the first quarter to $10
million, or 41 cents a share, and for the second quarter to
$5.2 million, or 21 cents a share.</p>
<p>Ronald Petrie, machinery analyst with McDonald & Co.,
Cleveland, expects relatively weak machine-tool profits for
the first and second quarters. However, he's forecasting an
upturn in manufacturing by midyear that will spark
machine-tool sales and result in higher profits for the
second half.</p>
<p>Mr. Petrie figures Milacron will earn $1 a share for the
year, in spite of a slow start. A Milacron spokesman
indicates that may be a bit optimistic, but the company also
is expecting an improved second half. For 1989, profit from
continuing operations was $18.4 million, or 75 cents a share,
and net income, after tax credits and losses on a
discontinued business, was $17.4 million, or 70 cents a
share.</p>
<p>Mr. Petrie expects Cross & Trecker Corp., Bloomfield
Hills, Mich., to break even for the year ending Sept. 30,
compared with a fiscal 1989 loss from operations of $15.3
million and a net loss of $46.5 million, or $3.76 a share,
including restructuring charges. Company officials have
forecast a return to profitability during the year, but
declined to say whether profits late in the year will balance
off losses in early months.</p>
<p>However, intense import competition also is curbing
profits for U.S. machine-tool builders. Machine-tool imports
last year rose 17% to a record $2.4 billion, NMTBA said.
Imports supplied about half the new machine tools purchased
by U.S. factories last year. And transplant factories owned
by Japanese concerns are a growing part of U.S. production.</p>
<p>Exports are a bright spot for U.S. machine-tool builders.
U.S. machine-tool exports in 1989 totaled $949.8 million, up
24% from a year earlier, NMTBA said. However, even those
markets are threatened. The declining value of the Japanese
yen against the dollar makes Japanese machine tools even
tougher competitors in Canada, Mexico, Europe and the Pacific
Rim, all areas where U.S. machine-tool exports have been
growing.</p>
<p>U.S. machine-tool builders say Eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union are promising long-term markets, as those
countries attempt to modernize inefficient factories.
However, 1990 sales in that region aren't likely to be large
enough to affect the bottom line.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, some of the specialized machine-tool
companies, especially those that do a large business in
Western Europe, are likely to report higher profits for the
first quarter and full year. European companies have been
investing heavily in new equipment in recent months.</p>
<p>Hurco Cos., Indianapolis, reported net for the first
quarter ended Jan. 31 of $2.2 million, or 38 cents a share,
on revenue of $22.7 million, up from year-earlier net of $1.3
million, or 28 cents a share, on revenue of $18.4 million.</p>
<p>Hurco specializes in small milling machines and machining
centers equipped with electronic controls. About half of this
year's sales will be overseas, says Michael K. Campbell, vice
president, finance and chief financial officer.</p>
<p>Mr. Campbell says Hurco's earnings for the fiscal second
quarter will exceed the year-earlier's 40 cents a share, and
he has no quarrel with an estimate by McDonald & Co.'s Mr.
Petrie that net for the year ending Oct. 31 will rise to
$2.10 a share from $1.70 a share in fiscal 1989.</p>
<p>Some analysts also forecast higher profits for Brown &
Sharpe Manufacturing Co., North Kingstown, R.I., which makes
measuring machines used with automated-manufacturing
equipment.</p>
<p>Giddings & Lewis Inc., Fond du Lac, Wis., specialist in
computer-directed manufacturing cells and systems, is likely
to report higher profits for the first quarter and year, says
F. John Mirek, machinery analyst for Blunt Ellis & Loewi,
Milwaukee. "They started the year with a strong backlog of
orders that are priced higher than the backlog of a year
ago," says Mr. Mirek. He's estimating first quarter net at 40
cents a share, up from 31 cents a year earlier, and profit
for the year of $1.80 a share, compared with 1989 net of
$17.1 million, or $1.65 a share. Giddings & Lewis declines to
comment on the earnings estimates.</p>
