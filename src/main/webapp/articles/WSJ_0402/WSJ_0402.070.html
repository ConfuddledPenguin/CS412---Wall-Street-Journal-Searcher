	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Molson Cos. said it plans to spend 90 million
Canadian dollars (US$76.8 million) over three years on its
chemicals unit and intends to sell some retailing operations
as part of a strategy to focus on industries with high-growth
potential.
   The company, Canada's largest brewing concern, said it
expects a one-time, after-tax charge of C$45 million in the
year ended Saturday as a result.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Molson said C$30 million of the charge is attributable to
moves to streamline the product line and upgrade the
manufacturing processes of its Diversey Corp. unit, a
specialty chemical maker.</p>
<p>Molson said the remaining C$15 million is linked to the
sale of part of its retailing operations, which had a loss of
about C$3 million in the fiscal year.</p>
<p>Company officials declined to comment on the prices they
expect to receive for the retailing operations. The stores to
be sold include chains of kitchenware, lighting, hardware and
kitchen appliance stores. Molson said it plans to retain its
lumber and do-it-yourself chain, Beaver Lumber, as well as a
chain of home decorating stores, B.B. Bargoon's. A spokesman
for the company said those two chains account for about 90%
of Molson's revenue from its retailing division.</p>
<p>The spokesman said the company is "very close" to
concluding the sales of some of the retailing chains.</p>
<p>The company didn't estimate fiscal 1990 income. In fiscal
1989, Molson had net income of C$87.1 million, or C$2.65 a
share, on revenue of C$2.6 billion. And in the latest nine
months, the company had net of C$157.6 million, or C$4.79 a
share, including a one-time gain of C$62 million, on revenue
of C$2 billion.</p>
<p>Molson said the C$90 million in capital spending planned
for Diversey will go toward converting manufacturing
facilities to state-of-the art processes. The company said
that about C$65 million will be internally funded, by
reducing working capital and redirecting spending priorities.
Molson didn't give further details.</p>
<p>Diversey, which makes cleaning and sanitation products,
has 51 operating facilities in 37 countries. It accounted for
about 28% of Molson's revenue in fiscal 1989, and about 31%
of operating profit.</p>
<p>Some analysts weren't surprised by Molson's move to divest
itself of most of the retailing chains, which are vulnerable
to an expected downturn in the business cycle. The analysts
said they have been expecting such a move since Molson's
president and chief executive officer, Marshall Cohen, who
has a reputation as a deal maker, joined the company in
November 1988.</p>
<p>In addition to Diversey and the retailing operations,
Molson has holdings in a malting company and an investment
concern. Molson also owns the Montreal Canadiens hockey team
and other sports and entertainment assets.</p>
