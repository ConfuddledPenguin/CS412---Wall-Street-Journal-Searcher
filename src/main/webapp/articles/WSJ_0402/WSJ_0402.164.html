	<p class="article-leader">Uniforce Temporary Personnel Inc., New Hyde Park, N.Y.,
said it is no longer considering a sale or merger of the
company.
   In May, Uniforce said it had retained Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets to evaluate strategies to maximize the
company's value to shareholders, including a possible sale or
restructuring.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Uniforce said it decided instead to raise the quarterly
dividend rate and to increase its borrowing facility from $5
million, to $15 million, "in connection with its intention to
expand operations through the acquisition and conversion of
existing temporary services."</p>
<p>The dividend will be three cents a share, up from 2.5
cents, and payable May 4 to stock of record April 20.</p>
<p>Through its Uniforce Temporary Services, the company
operates a national network of offices providing temporary
office and light-industry workers. Uniforce's 1989 net income
grew to $3.9 million, or 84 cents a share, from 1988 net of
$3.1 million, or 67 cents a share. Sales rose to $110.5
million from $101 million.</p>
