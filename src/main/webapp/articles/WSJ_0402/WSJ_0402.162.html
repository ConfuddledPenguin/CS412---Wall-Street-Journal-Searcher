	<p class="article-leader">Curtice-Burns Foods Inc. said it expects third-quarter
earnings to drop about 50% from year-earlier period on an 8%
sales rise.
   The third quarter ended Friday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A year ago, the Rochester, N.Y., company had net income of
$3.2 million, or 39 cents a share, on sales of $204.1
million. The per-share figure reflects a 3-for-2 stock split
paid in December.</p>
<p>David J. McDonald, Curtice-Burns president and chief
executive officer, said the earnings decline reflects a poor
crop year in the Northeast and high ingredient costs in the
meat snack business. Sales of the company's oat bran products
have also declined and prices on certain canned and frozen
vegetables have dropped.</p>
