	<p class="article-leader">It was a mountaintop in Afghanistan, and it was hot. My
two companions, clad in Nike running shoes and the
traditional "shalwar kameez" -- baggy cotton trousers covered
by a long flowing shirt -- spread out their prayer rug and
made their obeisance to Allah. I leaned up against a tree,
wiped the sweat-soaked dust from my eyes and stared at the
glory of the Afghan countryside.
   The men I was with were not fanatics. Though they spoke of
jihad (holy war), of martyrdom, of Islam, no one in their
company would mistake them for the frenzied mobs that rail
against Great Satan America from Tripoli to Tehran.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>My problem then was the same others covering the war have
had -- how to convey this difference to an American audience
within the confines of an op-ed piece. In "Soldiers of God:
With the Mujahidin in Afghanistan" (Houghton Mifflin, 258
pages, $19.95), Robert D. Kaplan puts it this way: "These
were not the sorts of perceptions that would have survived
the brutal reductions of the television camera, the narrow
boundaries of hard-news writing, or the quantifications of
the think-tank analysts in Washington and London."</p>
<p>Mr. Kaplan, until recently a free-lance reporter based in
Athens, is also the author of "Surrender or Starve," a book
about the barbarous, government-manufactured famine in
Ethiopia, and his experience shows. Indeed, his admitted
hostility toward other manifestations of Islam makes his
appreciation of the Afghans all the more impressive.</p>
<p>"(B)ecause Afghans harbored no political insecurities and
were more relaxed in their faith than Arabs or Iranians," he
writes, "Islam in Afghanistan manifested a certainty and
unintimidating dynamism that did not exist in Iran, Pakistan,
or any of the Arab countries I had visited."</p>
<p>His combination of firsthand war experience inside
Afghanistan and extensive reporting out of Peshawar -- base
of the seven-party alliance -- makes him sensitive to
distinctions that often escaped even devoted promoters of the
muj, local shorthand for the freedom fighters. The Peshawar
crowd, often ridiculed the more Westernized mujahedeen, many
of whom had relatives in Britain and the U.S. The national
Islamic Front of Afghanistan, for example, was dubbed the
"Gucci muj" and compared unfavorably with more rustic
warriors. But "the fact that members of their families were
abroad meant that they had other options," writes Mr. Kaplan,
who wonders whether that makes their decision to stay and
fight all the more significant.</p>
<p>Equally telling are his criticisms of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar,
the one fundamentalist party leader whose zealous struggle to
turn Afghanistan into a centrally controlled theocracy
recalls the Ayatollah Khomeini. Mr. Hekmatyar has long been
accused of killing more muj than Soviets, but that never
stopped a disproportionate share of U.S. aid from flowing
through Pakistan into Mr. Hekmatyar's coffers.</p>
<p>Just last week, a report by the House Republican Task
Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare wondered why
Mr. Hekmatyar's party's "fracticidal fighting against other
resistance groups, its close and growing cooperation with
both Tehran and Kabul, and its active participation in
anti-U.S. international terrorism" have had "little or no
effect on the delivery of CIA assistance."</p>
<p>By contrast, there is Abdul Haq, the charismatic self-made
commander responsible for the Kabul area, who is often
unjustly lumped with Mr. Hekmatyar. Though no less devout,
Mr. Haq's vision of Afghanistan couldn't be more distinct: a
decentralized, traditional Afghanistan where local rulers
hold real power. His visit with Margaret Thatcher and Ronald
Reagan, moreover, is credited with Washington's decision to
provide the Afghans with the all-important Stinger missiles.</p>
<p>"I told Mrs. Thatcher that my great-grandfather and his
father before him fought the British, who invaded Afghanistan
to keep the Russians out," remembers Mr. Haq. "So I asked
her: Now that the Russians have finally come, as the British
once feared, why are you so quiet?"</p>
<p>Mr. Kaplan rounds out his story with nicely detailed
descriptions of the minor but no less colorful types drifting
through Peshawar. There is John Wellesley Gunston, the
British army officer turned photojournalist; Savik Shuster,
the Jewish refugee from Lithuania who reported on the war for
Radio Liberty/Radio Free Europe; Koshiro Tanaka, a Japanese
wouldbe Rambo whose goal is to kill a Russian with his bare
hands. At the outset of the book, Mr. Kaplan dismisses many
of them as "war freaks." But it seems hardly fair for him to
blast the big-name press and the international organizations
for their reluctance to assume great risks and hardships in
covering Afghanistan, and then complain about the few hardy
souls who did rise, however imperfectly, to that challenge.</p>
<p>But this is a quibble with an otherwise first-rate account
of the determined hillmen who shot the Brezhnev Doctrine full
of holes, setting the stage for the dramatic events now
unfolding in Eastern Europe. However harsh the muj could be
on the battlefield, moreover, they did it without the
terrorist attacks on civilians that characterize most wars of
national liberation these days. In the face of the most
powerful weaponry, the latest strategies and the most modern
equipment, the stubborn Afghans taught the world an age-old
lesson.</p>
<p>As one of Mr. Kaplan's colleagues put it: "Had the
Russians read Kipling more carefully, they might never have
invaded Afghanistan."</p>
