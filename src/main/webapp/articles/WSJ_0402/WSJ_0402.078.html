	<p class="article-leader">BONN -- The West German trading concern Kloeckner & Co., a
unit of the conglomerate VIAG AG, said it sold its building
materials trading division to London-based Meyer
International PLC. Terms weren't disclosed.
   Kloeckner said the division has annual sales of about 300
million marks ($176.8 million) and was a "peripheral part" of
its operations. Shedding the unit is in line with Kloeckner's
strategy of concentrating more on international activities.
The construction materials trading units only operate within
West Germany.</p>
