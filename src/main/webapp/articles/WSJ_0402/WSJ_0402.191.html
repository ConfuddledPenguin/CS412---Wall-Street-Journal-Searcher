	<p class="article-leader">MONTREAL -- The Group of Seven industrialized countries
will discuss the International Monetary Fund's proposed
capital increase at a meeting in Paris on Saturday, according
to Canada's Finance Minister Michael Wilson.
   Mr. Wilson adding that he hopes for agreement on the issue
at the meeting.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The IMF has sought to double its capital to $240 billion
from $120 billion. But the U.S. and several other powerful
members have proposed lesser amounts, and it is likely the
agency will receive a capital increase of about 50% or $60
billion.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilson, who also heads the IMF's powerful
policy-setting interim committee, said he didn't think the
coordination of economic policies -- carried out through the
G-7 -- needs "revitalizing." But he said "coordination hasn't
produced results" recently. That may not be possible, he
said, because "we don't sit there with seven sets of levers
and make things happen."</p>
<p>The G-7 groups the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France,
Britain, Italy and Canada. Mr. Wilson will fly to Washington
today for a pre-G-7 talk with U.S. Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, foreign-exchange intervention by Japan,
the U.S. and big European countries has failed to stem the
weakening of the yen and the strengthening of the dollar. Mr.
Wilson declined to comment on the strained yen-dollar
relationship. But several other bankers and financial leaders
at this year's annual meeting of the Inter-American
Development Bank, held here during the weekend, said Japan
will soon have to raise interest rates to shore up the yen.</p>
<p>Commenting on recent talks between the U.S. and Mexico
concerning a bilateral free-trade agreement, Mr. Wilson said
a separate bilateral accord between Canada and Mexico
wouldn't be necessary.</p>
