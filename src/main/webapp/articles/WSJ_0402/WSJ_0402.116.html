	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- CBS Sports said it isn't renewing the contract
of its lead anchor, Brent Musburger, whose four-year
contract, worth $2 million annually, expires in June.
   Mr. Musburger, who has been with the CBS Inc. sports unit
for 15 years, will have his final CBS broadcast tonight with
the National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball
championship.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A CBS official said Mr. Musburger and the network couldn't
come to terms on a new agreement. The Associated Press
reported that Ted Shaker, executive producer of CBS Sports,
said network officials believed Mr. Musburger's workload was
too heavy, but the broadcaster resisted attempts by CBS in
contract talks to have him cut down.</p>
<p>Mr. Musburger, in a statement, said he was "surprised" by
CBS's announcement, but it has been "a great run." He said he
plans to take an extended vacation.</p>
