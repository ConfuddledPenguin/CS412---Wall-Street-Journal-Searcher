	<p class="article-leader">Self-proclaimed progressives have held that the interests
of the poor are best served by socialism, and that it is only
because of capitalist manipulation and deception that workers
everywhere did not "unite and throw off their chains." That
theory has crashed into the brick wall of reality with the
recent elections in Nicaragua, East Germany and Hungary. In
each country, it was the working-class areas that most
emphatically rejected socialism and voted for free-market
parties.
   The first socialist country to throw Marxism into the
dustbin of history in fully free elections was Nicaragua in
February. It is true that UNO, the opposition coalition that
defeated the ruling Sandinista regime, was made up of 14
parties whose views ranged from free-market to far left. Its
economic platform, however, called for free markets and
privatization.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The election results published in Barricada, the
Sandinista newspaper, show the depth of the repudiation the
party suffered in areas it had long considered its own.</p>
<p>As expected, the Sandinistas turned out their loyal voters
in the capital of Managua. Middle-class areas filled with
homes that had been confiscated for use by government
loyalists voted for the Sandinistas. Many of the city's poor
barrios, however, rejected them. "In Monsonor Lezcano, UNO
won two to one," Barricada reported mournfully. In working
class San Judas, a Sandinista stronghold, UNO nearly won. The
day after the vote, Reuters reported, barrio residents burned
the Sandinista flag in the streets.</p>
<p>The isolated southern area along Nicaragua's Caribbean
coast is probably the poorest region in the country. It gave
UNO more than 60% of the vote, its second-highest result in
any region. By way of contrast, the Rio San Juan area
bordering Costa Rica, perhaps the richest in Nicaragua, gave
the Sandinistas 58% of the vote and their best showing.</p>
<p>In the area where the most severe contra fighting took
place, around Matagalpa and Jinotega, the Sandinistas claimed
voters would give them a landslide victory to express their
outrage at the U.S.-backed contra war. Instead, UNO won 58%
of the vote, the Sandinistas only 36%.</p>
<p>Nicaragua's results should have prompted Western observers
to question media reports from East Germany that claimed
voters wanted to retain large elements of socialism. Carl
Bernstein, writing in Time magazine in January, said he
"could hardly find any citizens who said they wanted a
reunified, single Germany." He reported that "they love their
country. The German Democratic Republic, not the Federal
Republic of the West. They believe in socialism. Still."</p>
<p>Mr. Bernstein could file this amazing dispatch only
because his interviews were done in East Berlin, the one part
of East Germany that clearly resisted the free market tide in
favor of rapid unification. The reform Communist Party won
30% of the vote in Berlin and the leftish Social Democrats
(SPD) and Alliance 90 another 41%. In the rest of the
country, the parties of the left won only 36% of the vote.
The high Berlin vote for the left reflected the high number
of Communist Party functionaries, court intellectuals and
policemen in the capital.</p>
<p>Some Western analysts have attributed the conservatives'
victory to their supposedly massive rural support, but the
results indicate otherwise. Conservatives ran behind the vote
for the parties of the left in the most rural regions of the
country.</p>
<p>But the conservatives triumphed in the densely populated
industrial areas of Thuringia and Saxony, the prewar
heartland of German socialism. The left won only 26% of the
vote in the Dresden district, and in the soot-begrimed
industrial region of Karl Marx Stadt, only 29%. Erfurt, where
the Social Democratic Party issued its political program in
1891, gave the SPD only 19% of the vote.</p>
<p>The Social Democrats did poorly in part because many
workers harbored bitter memories of the years during which
the West German Social Democrats cooperated with the
Communist regime of Erich Honecker. "As time went on, the SPD
came to identify helping East Germans with helping the
Communist Party," bricklayer Olaf Wohlleben told John Barnes
of the Detroit News. Overall, exit polls showed that 60% of
working-class voters plumped for the conservatives and what
West German pollster Wolfgang Hartenstein called West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's "petit bourgeois certainties."</p>
<p>Support for those same values dominated Hungary's
elections last week. The two leading parties, Democratic
Forum and the Free Democrats, disagree only on how rapidly to
move to a market economy. Together they won nearly half the
vote. The Socialists and Communists won a total of 15% and
were swamped by the pro-market Free Democrats, even in the
poorer areas of Budapest.</p>
<p>Despite this sweeping repudiation of socialism, it would
be an exaggeration to say a majority of people in these
countries have become convinced capitalists. People are
voting not only for a different political and economic
system, but also to make their societies less political. When
Lech Walesa visited the Journal last November, he was asked
what the Polish people wanted. "We want to rejoin the ranks
of normal societies," he said. "It isn't an issue of
ideology, it simply means we want a system where politics
isn't everything and people can live normal lives."</p>
<p>Having lived in countries where every aspect of life from
university exams to child care was politicized, voters in
Eastern Europe and elsewhere are embracing a little-heralded
feature of the free society -- the freedom not to be obsessed
with political questions. They can instead immerse themselves
in family, career, church or self-improvement. In normal
societies people may forget about politics and concentrate on
the serious business of living. Socialism even in its most
benign form is a bureaucratic committee meeting that never
ends.</p>
