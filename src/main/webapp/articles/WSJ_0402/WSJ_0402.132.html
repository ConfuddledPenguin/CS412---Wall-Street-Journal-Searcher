	<p class="article-leader">MINNEAPOLIS -- For sale: The Federal Reserve Bank of
Minneapolis building.
   After months of study, bank officials decided the
structure not only is too small but also that removing
hazardous asbestos insulation would be too costly.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Built in 1972, the structure is an award-winning example
of suspension-bridge architecture. Its 10-story
reflective-glass office tower seems to hang between two
pillars on a block-sized downtown plaza. The bank's vault is
underground.</p>
<p>Initially, the bank's staff recommended temporarily
relocating while asbestos was removed and other renovations
and repairs were made. But officials abandoned that plan
after determining that the 550,000-square-foot structure
couldn't be easily expanded to meet growing space
requirements.</p>
<p>Bank officials now are seeking to build, buy or lease a
larger facility. A spokesman said the current building could
be sold, leased or perhaps traded. "We're open to all
options," he said.</p>
