	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- The U.S. parent of Campeau Corp.'s department
store units filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection in
what it said was a "procedural step" in the continuing
Chapter 11 reorganization of the retail units.
   Federated Stores Inc., formerly Campeau Corp. (U.S), said
it filed for Chapter 11 protection in U.S. Bankruptcy Court
in San Francisco. That is the same court where three
Federated holding companies and a U.S. Campeau real estate
unit filed for Chapter 11 protection on Jan. 15.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Federated is the holding company for Federated Department
Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., which filed for Chapter
11 protection in Cincinnati on Jan. 15. It also holds two
U.S. real estate units and a joint-venture development
partnership with Edward J. DeBartolo Corp., a Youngstown,
Ohio, shopping mall developer that lent Campeau $480 million.</p>
<p>Federated said its filing is "meaningless" to Federated
Department Stores and Allied Stores, and won't affect their
ability to meet their continuing obligations in the normal
course of business. It said the filing doesn't affect Ralphs
Grocery Co., Campeau's Southern California supermarket chain,
which isn't under Chapter 11 protection.</p>
<p>Federated and Allied are receiving merchandise shipments
from 98% of their "key" vendors and their department store
inventories are on a par with year-earlier levels, said Allen
Questrom, chairman and chief executive officer, and James
Zimmerman, president, in a statement.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Federated said she couldn't comment on
whether the bankruptcy filing would effectively freeze the
Campeau/DeBartolo mall development partnership. The
spokeswoman also said Federated's filing wasn't related to
the Canadian parent's latest cash woes.</p>
<p>Campeau Corp. didn't pay about $18.9 million of interest
due last Saturday on two debenture issues, and for the second
straight month likely will skip a $5.2 million monthly
interest payment due today to two major creditors.</p>
<p>Campeau said the debentures will be in default if the
payments aren't made by April 30, and it wants to defer
paying the interest until it has a new business plan for its
Canadian and U.S. real estate operations.</p>
<p>Campeau is already in default on $705 million of loans
from Olympia & York Developments Ltd. and DeBartolo because
it deliberately declined to pay February's $5.2 million
interest payment.</p>
<p>A Campeau spokesman said it wouldn't be in the company's
best interest to pay the interest now. He said Campeau is
"pretty confident" the debenture holders will agree to defer
the payments. Approval of 66% of the debenture holders is
needed for such a deferral. He said the company is up to date
on paying interest due on other loans.</p>
<p>Olympia & York declined to comment, but a source close to
the real estate development concern closely held by Toronto's
Reichmann family said it probably would be amenable to
deferring payments. DeBartolo officials weren't available for
comment.</p>
<p>Analysts weren't surprised by Campeau's decision to skip
the interest payments on its debentures.</p>
<p>"It wasn't totally unexpected given the negotiations they
must get through with their creditors on debt owed by the
parent company," said Ross Cowan, of Toronto-based Levesque
Beaubien Geoffrion Inc.</p>
<p>Analysts expect Campeau's business plan will include
renegotiated loan agreements and an accelerated program of
asset sales, including some of Campeau's prime properties
that are encumbered under loans.</p>
<p>Campeau's debt crisis became acute when Federated and
Allied sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection. The
Canadian parent company needed the cash flow from Federated
and Allied to service debt taken on during its $6.6 billion
takeover of Federated in 1988.</p>
<p>The interest payments Campeau missed Saturday include
about $13 million due on its $260 million of 7% convertible
debentures, all of which are held by Olympia & York, and 6.9
million Canadian dollars (US$5.8 million) due on C$184
million of 7.5% convertible debentures, of which C$46.6
million is held by Olympia & York. The interest rate on the
7% debentures was increased to 9.86% last September.</p>
