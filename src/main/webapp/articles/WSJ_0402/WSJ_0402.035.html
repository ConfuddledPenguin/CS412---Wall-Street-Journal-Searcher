	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- After squeaking through the Senate Banking
Committee, the Bush administration's nominee to be its top
savings-and-loan watchdog may be in for a tough fight on the
Senate floor following the disclosure of his drug use in the
early 1970s.
   The nomination of Timothy Ryan was approved 11-10 by the
committee and sent to the Senate floor Friday, the day after
committee Chairman Donald Riegle (D., Mich.) announced that
Mr. Ryan appeared to lack enough votes to win approval as the
director of the Office of Thrift Supervision.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Both Democrats and Republicans had expressed skepticism
about the nominee's lack of financial experience. If
confirmed, Mr. Ryan would take charge at a time of industry
crisis and record losses.</p>
<p>The disclosure that Mr. Ryan, who was special counsel to
the Bush presidential campaign, tried marijuana and cocaine a
few times in the early 1970s, cast some new uncertainty on
the nomination. It has propelled the administration into high
gear to push for his approval in a full Senate vote, which
could occur Wednesday.</p>
<p>Mr. Ryan disclosed the information to the Federal Bureau
of Investigation during its background check, and the Senate
Banking Committee had that information before voting and
before NBC News reported it Friday evening. "Prior to my
nomination, I disclosed both on my FBI forms and verbally to
the White House and Treasury and the FBI that early in the
1970s, I smoked marijuana on a few occasions and tried
cocaine once, perhaps twice," said his statement after the
NBC report. "I regret this mistake. I don't regret having
voluntarily disclosed this information."</p>
<p>Treasury officials said Secretary Nicholas Brady
telephoned senators over the weekend to push for Mr. Ryan's
nomination. He had telephoned and visited many members of the
committee the morning of the panel's vote, as well. "We knew
about this issue because the nominee voluntarily disclosed
the information," Mr. Brady said. "We do not believe the
reported incident should deter the full Senate from acting
promptly and favorably on Mr. Ryan's nomination."</p>
<p>Some Republicans agreed that such a long-ago and
short-lived brush with drugs shouldn't tarnish Mr. Ryan's
chances. "There's a whole generation that's coming up for
posts in this kind of circumstance," said Sen. John Warner
(R., Va.), who sponsored Mr. Ryan in the Banking Committee.
"We can't write off those persons who many years ago have
experimented with controlled substances."</p>
<p>Some in the Senate said that negative votes on Mr. Ryan
would be more likely to stem from general dissatisfaction
with the rocky progress of the bailout law passed last August
than from the drug issue. Republican leaders, including
Kansas Sen. Robert Dole, have warned that the thrift crisis
could haunt the party in elections.</p>
<p>Even those who supported him said it was better to have
someone in the post with little financial background than no
one at all. "He might not have been my choice," said Sen.
Phil Gramm (R., Texas). "But there's not a hell of a lot of
people lined up for this job."</p>
<p>Mr. Ryan, a former Labor Department lawyer, received
unanimous endorsement Friday from the committee's
Republicans. Two Democrats, Sen. Terry Sanford of North
Carolina and Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama, surprised the
committee by voting for Mr. Ryan.</p>
<p>"I have vacillated both ways," Sen. Shelby told the
committee Friday. "If we were voting last night, I would have
voted against him." Sen. Sanford wasn't present for the vote
Friday, and cast his ballot by proxy. An aide said the
senator always had intended to support Mr. Ryan.</p>
<p>He won the nomination despite protests from Sen. Howard
Metzenbaum (D., Ohio), who said that Mr. Ryan skirted ethics
requirements in several instances, such as when he served on
an advisory council to the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act at the same time he represented a business group
with interests in the issue. Mr. Ryan subsequently resigned
from the council, at the request of the Labor Department.</p>
<p>The committee vote Friday was a blow to Sen. Riegle, in
the wake of his forecast. "That can happen in a situation
like this," he said after the vote. "I won't make a
prediction for the full Senate." He said he wouldn't comment
on the drug issue.</p>
<p>A pending court case could affect the confirmation
proceedings. An appeals court decision, due April 11, could
throw into question the standing that the Office of Thrift
Supervision's current director has to seize insolvent savings
and loans and to do other work of the S&L bailout. That
possibility more than anything else may make Mr. Ryan's
nomination likely to succeed.</p>
