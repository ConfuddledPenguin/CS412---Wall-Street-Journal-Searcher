	<p class="article-leader">In an order that eased worries among computer makers that
a vital chip supply might be cut off, a U.S. District Court
judge stayed an injunction ordering Motorola Inc. to stop
selling its flagship chip in the U.S.
   U.S. District Court Judge Lucius Bunton in Austin, Texas,
granted the stay Friday, a day after he ordered Motorola to
stop selling its 68030 microprocessor chip, which he found to
infringe on a Hitachi Ltd. patent. Sharply chiding the
companies for not settling out of court, the judge also found
Hitachi in violation of certain Motorola patents and ordered
Hitachi to stop selling the offending chips.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Friday's stay brought reassurance to computer makers who
use the 68030 chip, who worried that their supplies might be
cut off. "It certainly brings a sigh of relief," said a
spokesman for Stratus Computer Inc., a Marlboro, Mass.,
company that uses the chip in some computers and plans to
unveil new 68030 machines today.</p>
<p>The stay allows Motorola to keep selling the 68030 chip,
which is used by big computer makers such as Apple Computer
Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co. and NCR Corp. The chip, along with
related semiconductors that often sell with it, brought
Motorola about $450 million in revenue last year, estimated
analyst David Angel of Dataquest Inc., a market-research
firm.</p>
<p>The stay also lets Hitachi continue selling its chips,
which Mr. Angel estimates brought Hitachi about $30 million
in revenue last year. The stay is in effect for both
companies pending an appeal of the judge's decision, which
also calls for the companies to pay each other damages.</p>
<p>Neither company was saying what it plans to do next. A
Motorola spokesman said that "it's reasonable to expect that
we might" appeal the judge's ruling, which also calls for the
Schaumburg, Ill., company to pay Hitachi $500,000 in damages.
Another option, he said, was a settlement with Hitachi. "At
this time we've not entered into any negotiations" with
Hitachi, he said. But "it's reasonable to assume that it may
take place." A Hitachi spokesman said the Tokyo-based company
was studying the ruling and wouldn't have a comment on the
company's next move until early this week.</p>
<p>Industry analysts suggested that a rapproachment --
providing for cross-licensing, say, or licensing payments --
is a likely option for the sparring chip makers, especially
given the judge's strong words in Thursday's ruling.</p>
<p>Calling the yearlong case a "travesty of justice" that
unnecessarily tied up the court with complex issues and
motions "replete with bickering and petty insults," Judge
Bunton said in his ruling: "The parties would have saved
time, money, feelings and relations had they curbed their
emotions and sat down to settle their difference out of
court. In short, this suit is not the sort of thing federal
courts should spend time and energy upon."</p>
<p>"It's very clear from the ruling," said Dataquest's Mr.
Angel, "that the judge wants the parties to go off and solve
the thing themselves."</p>
<p>The Austin judge's injunction Thursday touched off 24
hours of scrambling by computer makers for information on
supplies of the chip. Stratus, for example, stepped up
security around its inventory of 68030 chips, which it said
is enough to last until June. The chip, the spokesman said,
would have become "a hot commodity" should the judge's
injunction have stuck.</p>
<p>Motorola's stock closed Friday at $65, down $2.50, in
heavy composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
