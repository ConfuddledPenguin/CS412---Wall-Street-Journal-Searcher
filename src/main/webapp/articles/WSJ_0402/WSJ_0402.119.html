	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- After another outbreak of strike violence, GLI
Holding Co.'s Greyhound Lines Inc. said it would not take
part in a renewed round of bargaining with the Amalgamated
Transit Union, which represents 9,300 Greyhound employees who
have been on strike since March 2.
   The two sides had been set to resume negotiations in
Tucson, Ariz., today, but within hours after the resumption
of bargaining was announced last Thursday, two more Greyhound
buses had been hit by sniper fire and a bomb threat was
phoned into the company's Chicago terminal.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We cannot resume negotiations while the violence
continues," Greyhound chief labor negotiator P. Anthony
Lannie said in a letter sent Friday to Edward Strait,
president of the Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local
Unions, the ATU's bargaining unit.</p>
<p>The company said that if there is no further violence, it
would be willing to meet with the union on April 9.</p>
<p>Mr. Strait responded angrily to the company's action,
calling it a "smokescreen."</p>
<p>"This union has repeatedly and publicly condemned
violence," Mr. Strait said. "But these isolated incidents
have no bearing on Greyhound management's legal and moral
obligation to negotiate in good faith, a fair and equitable
contract for Greyhound employees."</p>
