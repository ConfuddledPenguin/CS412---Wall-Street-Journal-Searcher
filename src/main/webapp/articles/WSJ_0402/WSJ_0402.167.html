	<p class="article-leader">Graphic Scanning Corp. moved to answer Gabelli Group
Inc.'s objections to the Englewood, N.J., telecommunications
company's proposed slate of directors to be voted at the
annual meeting.
   Gabelli, which controls the equivalent of 38.8% of Graphic
Scanning shares, had said it couldn't support the slate and
suggested the company nominate "knowledgeable industry
professionals" to the board.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Graphic responded by adding two more candidates to the
slate -- James L. Greenwald, president and chief executive
officer of Katz Communications Inc., and Robert Price,
president of Price Communications Corp. If both men are
elected, the board would increase to 10 members. Graphic also
postponed the meeting until April 19. Katz and Price are
based in New York.</p>
<p>Mario J. Gabelli, who heads the investor group, said he
couldn't say whether the move would satisfy the group's
concerns, until he sees the new proxy material. He did say,
however, that he believed reducing the size of the board to
six would have been better than expanding it to 10.</p>
