	<p class="article-leader">Last year, our publication came out with its annual list
of the largest jury awards in personal-injury cases. The
leader was a more than $152 million verdict in a case
involving lung disease. A Baltimore jury awarded more than
$76 million each to two workers who had been exposed to
asbestos in factory and shipyard jobs.
   The defendant was Celotex Corp., a building products
manufacturer based in Tampa, Fla. Celotex made litigation
history with this mistake: It had offered only $2,500 to
settle one of the cases, and only $150 in the other. Celotex
lawyers had used a chart, which listed an asbestos victim's
disease in one column and the settlement offer in the next.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>This failure to make a meaningful offer in a lawsuit
involving serious injury is one of the common, yet easily
avoidable, mistakes that result in multimillion-dollar jury
awards.</p>
<p>Experienced plaintiff lawyers see the same mistakes again
and again, and profit from them. One such lawyer is Richard
Grand of Tucson, Ariz., who has won 60 jury verdicts or
settlements of $1 million or more in 31 years of law
practice. He hasn't lost a jury trial since 1962. The total
amount insurance companies have paid in his cases is about
$200 million. According to Mr. Grand, corporate managers and
insurance companies can avoid the unnecessary mistakes that
lead to these electrifying verdicts by handling litigation
more carefully.</p>
<p>-- Make a meaningful offer. The seven- and eight-figure
verdicts typically involve a victim who suffered burns,
paralysis, brain injury, death or a birth injury. Insurance
companies have statistics on what these cases settle for. The
defense should write appropriate offers to settle these
lawsuits -- even if there is no settlement demand (and even
though this goes against the common insurance-industry
practice).</p>
<p>Preceding every million-dollar verdict Mr. Grand has
obtained, he never has had an offer greater than 25% of the
amount the jury awarded. Most of the offers were zero
dollars. For example, in a 1985 case a five-year-old girl was
severely burned when a camp stove spurted a stream of flaming
fuel onto her. She sued Coleman Co., the camp-stove
manufacturer, and Coleman made no offer to settle. At trial
Mr. Grand proved that Coleman had known about the blowhole
fuel defect for 20 years, and the jury awarded $7.86 million.</p>
<p>Coleman refused to make a settlement offer after the trial
or during the appeal. After the state Supreme Court affirmed
the verdict, Coleman paid $8.54 million, including interest.</p>
<p>-- Look at the courtroom record of the plaintiff lawyer.
Insurance companies pay based not only on the injury but also
on their fear of the plaintiff lawyer. According to Mr.
Grand, insurance companies are "grossly overpaying" to settle
cases where the plaintiff lawyer has never won a jury verdict
of $1 million or more. Any lawyer can make a demand for seven
figures, but only a limited number of lawyers can
consistently persuade a jury to make such an award.</p>
<p>For example, the defense should determine if the opposing
lawyer is a member of the Inner Circle of Advocates. Members
of this organization have tried at least 50 cases to a
verdict, including at least one with a jury award of $1
million or more. The average age is 60, and these are
seasoned plaintiff lawyers who consistently obtain large
settlements. Other "trial" associations and academies include
lawyers who have never tried a case.</p>
<p>-- Start settlement negotiations early. It is true that
90% of all lawsuits settle, but most high-stakes injury cases
are settled on the courthouse steps before the trial. Late in
the proceedings, both parties will be hardened in their
positions, and will have spent great sums on experts and
depositions. An insurance carrier will spend $500,000 to $2
million to defend a big case. Late settlements are costly
settlements.</p>
<p>But early on, a plaintiff lawyer will have incurred few
costs and may agree to limit his contingency fee to settle
the case.</p>
<p>-- Retain a plaintiff lawyer as a defense consultant. In
negotiations, you should speak the language of the other
side. Insurance companies, however, rarely heed this advice.
A highly seasoned plaintiff lawyer retained by the defense
will be an effective negotiator in settlement talks.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, lawyers in America tend to line up along
the plaintiff or defense side and stay there, as has Mr.
Grand, but it doesn't have to be this way. "Most great
lawyers really would like to do what barristers do in
England, which is handle either side of a case," Mr. Grand
says.</p>
<p>Plaintiff lawyers routinely engage settlement consultants
and negotiators. These are skilled specialists who advertise
their availability for wrongful death and injury cases. The
defense should not go it alone either, especially when the
case may end with a seven-figure verdict. Just as investment
bankers are brought in to assist with corporate mergers, the
defense should retain a plaintiff lawyer in a major injury
case.</p>
<p>-- Get the case into arbitration. It's not just for labor
disputes any more. The goal from the plaintiff's side is to
get money into the victim's hands. The goal from the
defense's side is to end the case. Arbitration is a quick and
less formal way to resolve an injury case.</p>
<p>Many lawyers are reluctant to try arbitration. Alternative
dispute resolution isn't familiar, and lawyers are taught
little about it in law school. But the ADR movement is
growing, and a record 55,520 cases were filed in arbitration
in 1989 to settle $2.4 billion in claims, according to the
American Arbitration Association. Many were insurance and
accident claims.</p>
<p>In a case where a seven-figure verdict is possible,
litigation will almost certainly take years, and appeals will
add more time. Mr. Grand represented a policeman who was
paralyzed from a gunshot wound in 1978. He won a $3.6 million
jury award that was upheld in 1982. The judgment was finally
paid in 1984, but only after the defense spent hundreds of
thousands of dollars vainly fighting the case, and filed for
bankruptcy-law protection because of the verdict.</p>
<p>-- Is the defense lawyer in a feud? Most plaintiff lawyers
do not have a good relationship with defense counsel. Defense
lawyers have emotions too, and can make their careers by
defeating a famous trial lawyer. A blood feud, however, can
lead to a seven-figure verdict.</p>
<p>Corporate managers should interview their lawyers, just as
they would a new job applicant, and inquire at length how
they feel about the plaintiff lawyer.</p>
