	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Treasury recommended drastically
simplifying the system for calculating the income tax of
widely held partnerships.
   In a report to the tax-writing Senate Finance and House
Ways and Means committees, the Treasury and the Internal
Revenue Service concluded that the requirements for reporting
income of large partnerships "are overly complex and
inefficient."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A simplified reporting system would ease the burden and
cost of compliance on partnerships and make it easier for the
IRS to administer that area of tax law, the two agencies
said.</p>
<p>In general, the agencies are recommending radically
reducing the number of items that must be reported separately
to partners. Instead "all income and expense, including
capital gains and losses, would be netted at the partnership
level," the report said.</p>
<p>"The goal of these proposed changes is not to increase or
decrease the overall tax due partnerships," the report said.
But it added, "We recognize that the total income tax
attributable to a partnership subject to the simplified
reporting system would almost certainly vary to some degree
from the total income tax under the current rules."</p>
