	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- Texas Meridian Resources Ltd. said that it
agreed to acquire a 65% interest in American National
Petroleum Co. for $4.50 a share, or about $18.4 million, and
that it intends to merge the two companies' businesses.
   Texas Meridian, an oil and gas master limited partnership,
will buy its largest block, nearly 3.5 million shares, from
San Francisco-based Ironstone Group Inc. for $15.6 million.
Ironstone owns a total of about 4.2 million shares, or about
63% of American National. Ironstone said it expects to
realize a pretax gain of about $6.3 million on the sale.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The balance of Texas Meridian's purchase of nearly 4.1
million shares will be from certain shareholders
contractually related to Ironstone. As part of the
transaction, American National will also sell to Ironstone
some energy-related investments not part of its primary oil
and gas exploration and production business.</p>
<p>Texas Meridian's purchases depend on the signing of a
definitive agreement for the combination of the two
companies' businesses into a Texas Meridian subsidiary, plus
certain other conditions.</p>
<p>Details of that business combination haven't been
completed, said Michael J. Mayell, Texas Meridian president.
But he said holders of the two companies would share in the
resulting operation according to the value of each firm's the
oil and gas properties. A combination would need approval by
American National and Texas Meridian directors and
stockholders or unitholders.</p>
