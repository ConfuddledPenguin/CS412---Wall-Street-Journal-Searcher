	<p class="article-leader">WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. -- Great Pacific Capital Ltd., a New
York investment concern owned by a Canadian financier, Jim
Pattison, said it raised to 11.13% its stake in Ipco Corp.'s
common shares outstanding from 9.37% last November.
   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Great
Pacific said it holds 563,600 Ipco shares, including 77,800
acquired between Jan. 30 and Tuesday, for $7.125 to $8.125
each. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
Ipco shares closed at $7.75, down 25 cents.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ipco operates a chain of about 250 Sterling Optical and
Ipco Optical stores in 20 U.S. states and Canada, which
generated earnings last year of about $453,000 on sales of
$123.9 million.</p>
<p>Ipco officials weren't available to comment on the filing,
and a Great Pacific executive wouldn't elaborate. Great
Pacific said previously that it may buy additional Ipco
shares or "make a proposal with respect to a business
combination," among other things, depending on market
conditions and other factors.</p>
<p>Mr. Pattison, based in Vancouver, British Columbia, has
various closely held companies that generate aggregate annual
sales of more than two billion Canadian dollars (US$1.71
billion). He formed Great Pacific in 1987 to search for U.S.
acquisitions.</p>
<p>In a recent interview, Mr. Pattison said that he wants to
acquire U.S. assets to help diversify his holdings, and that
he is mainly interested in retail or consumer product
companies. "We're comfortable serving the public," he said.
Mr. Pattison's holdings include car dealerships, grocery
stores, and advertising and packaging companies.</p>
