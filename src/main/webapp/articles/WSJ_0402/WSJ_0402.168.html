	<p class="article-leader">Gillette Co. said it agreed to sell its European skin care
and hair care businesses to Nobel Consumer AB, a division of
Nobel Industries of Sweden, for $107 million. Gillette also
will retain some $30 million in receivables.
   Gillette said in Boston that it expects the sale to be
completed within 60 days.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The European brands being sold to Nobel include Silkience
hair care products, Antica Erboristeria herbal toiletries in
Italy and La Toja toiletry products in Spain.</p>
<p>Gillette isn't selling its European deodorant,
anti-perspirant and shaving preparations lines, which it will
continue to make and market.</p>
<p>Gillette had said last December that it planned to sell
certain European toiletries businesses as part of a
realignment of its North Atlantic shaving and personal care
products into one operating unit.</p>
