	<p class="article-leader">THE SOVIET UNION SENT military reinforcements to
Lithuania's capital.
   As the breakaway Baltic republic's legislature met to
consider its next moves, dozens of Soviet military vehicles
lumbered through the streets of Vilnius, and the last Western
journalists were ousted from the republic on orders from the
Soviet government. The activity prompted some Lithuanians to
express concern about an impending Kremlin military
crackdown. On Saturday, Gorbachev had urged the republic to
renounce its March 11 proclamation of independence and to
enter talks with Moscow.</p>

said the republic would send negotiators to Moscow today to
arrange talks with Soviet officials.</p>

<p>THATCHER BLAMED extremists for turning a tax protest into
a riot.</p>
<p>The British prime minister, as well as opposition
politicians, criticized "extreme groups who used violence"
for the "mayhem" that erupted Saturday at an anti-tax protest
in London. More than 130 people were injured and about 340
arrested in the rioting, considered the worst in decades.
Sporadic unrest flared yesterday as the unpopular tax, which
generally replaces a property tax with a levy on each adult,
took effect in England and Wales. Thatcher made clear she
won't back down over the issue.</p>
<p>About 300 inmates rioted at an overcrowded prison in
Manchester, England, occupying rooftops and setting fires.
About 50 people were injured.</p>

<p>East Berlin officials warned that a Bundesbank proposal
for a 2-to-1 conversion rate for East German marks into West
German marks could hinder the unification of the two
Germanys. The recommendation marked a retreat from pledges
made by Bonn's leader during recent East German elections.</p>

<p>Mandela offered to meet with South Africa's President de
Klerk to discuss how to end violence, but said police conduct
would determine when the African National Congress holds
talks with the government. The black nationalist leader
indicated that there were differences within the ANC, which
canceled April 11 negotiations with Pretoria.</p>

<p>Police in China barred the general public from entering
Beijing's Tiananmen Square, where dissidents had urged a
silent protest against last year's government crackdown on
student-led demonstrations. Paramilitary forces ringed most
of the huge square in the latest sign of tightened security
in the capital ahead of anniversaries marking unrest.</p>

<p>Idaho Gov. Andrus vetoed what would have been the nation's
most restrictive abortion law. The legislation would have
prevented about 95% of the state's abortions. Friday's veto
by Andrus, considered an opponent of abortion, left
anti-abortion leaders searching for new opportunities to
press their efforts before the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Hundreds of civilians in Lebanon fled the country's
Christian enclave as a cease-fire ended two days of fighting
between rival Christian forces. More than 60 people were
killed and about 130 injured in the battles. The truce, the
15th in two months of fighting, was negotiated by a
three-member mediation committee backed by the Vatican.</p>

<p>Cases of venereal disease are rebounding at gay clinics in
Los Angeles, Seattle and Denver, and the rate of new
AIDS-virus infections in Chicago has risen for the first time
in five years. The increases were attributed by some to a
return to unsafe-sex practices within the homosexual
community and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Medical researchers reported that damage from spinal-cord
injuries, frequently the cause of paralysis, can be reduced
by a common generic drug. Such injuries afflict about 10,000
people a year. Researchers said that large doses of
methylprednisolone, an anti-inflammatory drug, given within
eight hours of injury can limit damage.</p>

<p>Zimbabwe's President Mugabe vowed to press ahead with
plans to turn the nation's democracy into a one-party state
after results from last week's elections gave the country's
ruling party all but three of the 150 seats in Harare's
legislature. But the 66-year-old Mugabe indicated that
opposition parties wouldn't be immediately outlawed.</p>

<p>Honduras's military pledged to search for gunmen who
attacked a bus carrying 28 U.S. airmen about six miles north
of Tegucigalpa, leaving eight wounded, at least two
seriously. A leftist rebel group, the Morazano National
Liberation Front, claimed responsibility for the assault
Saturday.</p>
