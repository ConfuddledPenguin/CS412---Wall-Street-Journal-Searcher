   For a Hurried Populace</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>DESPITE requirements for tamper-resistance and
child-proofing, Americans are demanding and getting quicker
access to packaged food and other products.</p>
<p>"There's an explosion of convenience packaging in the
marketplace," says Mel Druin, vice president at Campbell
Soup.</p>
<p>Yielding to complaints from young and old, Campbell has
replaced the peel-off adhesive tab on its 12-ounce V-8 juice
can with an "easy-open stay-on tab."</p>
<p>A Richard Simmons salad dressing now comes in a bottle
with a pump top. And popcorn for microwave ovens is sold in
bags that can be pulled open easily by grasping opposite
ends.</p>
<p>New York inventor Sanford Redmond has developed a
"portion" package for condiments and other products that
opens with one hand. Mr. Redmond's "dispenSRpak" consists of
two soft miniature sacks resting on a stiff layer of plastic,
which has a "fault line" across it. Squeezed in one hand, the
package breaks open at the fault, and out squirts mustard,
shampoo or whatever.</p>
<p>Mr. Redmond, who worked on the atom bomb, says his package
will replace those ketchup pouches that require "two hands, a
scissor or your teeth to open."</p>
<p>John Stanton, professor of food marketing at St. Joseph's
University in Philadelphia, says one-handed packaging could
prove popular, noting that 20% of commuters eat breakfast
behind the wheel. "People want to steer a car and deal with
other things, like eating food," he says.</p>
<p>Computers Play Artist,</p>
<p>Selecting Palettes</p>
<p>LIKE EVERYTHING else, color is becoming computerized.
Designers can create just about any color they want, while
makers of ink, textiles, plastics and other products can
match the designer's conception, quickly and cheaply.</p>
<p>Colorcurve Systems Inc. of Minneapolis makes software that
allows designers to review the spectrum, assign numbers to
the color they want and communicate their selection
numerically to manufacturers. Applied Color Systems Inc. of
Princeton, N.J., makes the hardware.</p>
<p>In arriving at the perfect color, a designer may make many
proofs, a task complicated by the fact that ordinary computer
screens don't provide an accurate picture of what color will
look like in real life. So Barco Inc. of Smyrna, Ga., makes
computer monitors that automatically correct themselves when
their color deviates from true.</p>
<p>Someday it may be possible to think a colorful thought,
tap a few keys and bring up just the right color to match the
thought. Kuan Kuo, a graduate student at the Illinois
Institute of Technology's Institute of Design, has developed
software that will produce a palette of colors when prompted
by words such as "warm" or "cool," "hard" or "soft,"
"conservative" or "liberal."</p>
<p>Computers certainly have their drawbacks. Ariel Peeri, a
New York graphic designer, says that because his computers
allow him to go directly from idea to finished proof, they
eliminate much of the "back and forth" he used to have with
clients. Computers save time and money, Mr. Peeri says, but
leave some clients feeling "thwarted."</p>
<p>With Two Dials, Clock</p>
<p>Gives Kids Helping Hand</p>
<p>IN CALIFORNIA, a psychologist thinks he's got a better way
to teach children -- and maybe adults -- to tell time.</p>
<p>Dominic Massaro, professor of psychology at the University
of California, Santa Cruz, says traditional clocks are "a
legacy of history, not the result of good design principles."
Thus, children often confuse minutes with hours.</p>
<p>Mr. Massaro's new clock has a separate dial of minutes
outside the hour dial. This isn't entirely a new idea.
Judy/Instructo, a Minneapolis company, has long been selling
a double-dialed clock for classroom instruction. But Mr.
Massaro has added other cues of color and size. His hour hand
is small and red and points to small red hours; his minute
hand is large and green and points to large green minutes.</p>
<p>The Judy clock is just a demonstrator. Mr. Massaro says he
plans to make both demonstrators and real, working clocks and
watches -- for both children and grown-ups. Adults, he says,
could get "a quicker picture of time."</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>KRIEGER WATCH Corp. of Miami Beach, Fla., produces a
moon-movement chronometer, indicating the best times to hunt
and fish. . . . A plastic device, shaped like a seahorse,
helps long-fingernailed women open car doors and beverage
cans, release seat belts and dial the phone. The designer,
Laura Penwarden of Santa Ana, Calif., calls it "Gentleman's
Hand."</p>
