	<p class="article-leader">An Eastern Airlines pilot fired in March after he
allegedly bought crack cocaine from an undercover police
officer had tested positive for cocaine use seven months
earlier.
   Dain Schneemilch, a 36-year-old flight engineer at
Eastern, was arrested Feb. 23 and charged with buying one $20
rock of crack from a police officer in Key Largo, Fla.
According to the police records, the transaction was recorded
and videotaped.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the letter notifying Mr. Schneemilch of his dismissal,
Eastern said the pilot tested positive for cocaine use July
19 during a routine back-to-work physical examination. Mr.
Schneemilch struck the carrier in March 1989 along with most
members of the Air Line Pilots Association, but crossed the
picket line to return to work.</p>
<p>Although he failed the drug test, Mr. Schneemilch flew as
a second officer, or flight engineer, on Eastern's Boeing 727
jets. He was promoted to first officer in October, and was in
training when he was arrested. Mr. Schneemilch couldn't be
reached for comment.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Eastern said Mr. Schneemilch's positive
drug test went unnoticed because of "an oversight." The
airline last summer hired 1,000 pilots to replace pilots
still striking the carrier, "and somehow his results went
into the file with all the negative results," the spokesman
said. Mr. Schneemilch "never touched the controls. There was
not a thing in his performance to indicate he had a problem."</p>
<p>Eastern has since examined all the drug tests of all
pilots hired or re-hired since last year to be certain no
other results were similarly misfiled. "The pilot records are
clean," the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Separately, Eastern said the possibility of a liquidation
at the financially ailing carrier was "exceedingly remote"
and not in the interest of unsecured creditors.</p>
<p>The company was responding to reports last week that its
unsecured creditors threatened to look into liquidating the
carrier if Eastern's parent, Texas Air Corp. of Houston,
doesn't agree to play a bigger role in the reorganization.
The creditors took that position after Eastern told them it
must withdraw from an agreement to pay them 50 cents for
every dollar owed.</p>
<p>In a statement issued Friday, Eastern said it was
confident that when negotiations with its creditors committee
continue that "reason will prevail and the outcome will be
one that allows Eastern to successfully emerge from
bankruptcy."</p>
