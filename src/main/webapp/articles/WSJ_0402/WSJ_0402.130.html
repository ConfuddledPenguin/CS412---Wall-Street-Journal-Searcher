	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- McHaffie Inc., a Sylmar, Calif., defense
contractor, was charged by the U.S. Justice Department with
falsification of test data on bolts the company made for use
in various military jet aircraft engines.
   In a criminal information filed in federal court in Los
Angeles, the government alleged that McHaffie failed to test
the bolts and submitted fraudulent certifications to the
government over an eight-year period beginning in 1979. The
certifications indicated that the bolts had been tested and
met all manufacturing standards and other specifications, the
government charged.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The information named as defendants the company; its
56-year-old owner and president, Norman McHaffie, and two
employees, James Hicks, 45, and William Whitham, 37.</p>
<p>Attorneys for Mr. McHaffie and Mr. Hicks said they hadn't
seen the information and couldn't comment. Neither Mr.
Whitham nor his attorney could be reached.</p>
<p>The company faces a maximum fine of $1.5 million, the
government said. Mr. McHaffie faces a maximum sentence of 15
years in prison and a $750,000 fine. Messrs. Hicks and
Whitham, who cooperated with the government in its
investigation, each face a maximum sentence of 10 years in
prison and a $500,000 fine.</p>
