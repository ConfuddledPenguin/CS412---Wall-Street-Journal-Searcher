	<p class="article-leader">McDonnell Douglas Corp. confirmed that it received an
order from Japan Air Lines Co. valued at about $2 billion for
10 of its MD-11 aircraft and options for 10 more that could
be converted into orders for a new stretched version of the
MD-11.
   Analysts said that McDonnell Douglas had been planning a
relatively simple variation on the wide-body, triple-engine
jet for a couple of years, but that now it appears to be
moving toward a more radically modified aircraft, the MD-12X,
which could involve a costly redesign of the wing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>JAL's interest in the bigger plane, which would seat
roughly 100 more passengers and compete with medium-range
versions of Boeing Co.'s 747 jetliner, gives the MD-12X a
"significant lift," said a spokesman for McDonnell Douglas's
commercial aircraft unit in Long Beach, Calif. "We expect to
have a business plan ready for approval by the board around
mid-year."</p>
<p>St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas beat out Airbus
Industrie, the European aircraft consortium, for the JAL
contract. "After studying it (the two aircraft) from various
angles, we concluded that the MD-11 was the best buy," JAL
President Susumu Yamaji said at a press conference in Tokyo
on Friday. He didn't say specifically what tipped the
decision in McDonnell Douglas's favor.</p>
<p>Mr. Yamaji denied that the decision to buy American rather
than European airplanes was a political move to deflect
tensions over Japan's $49 billion trade surplus with the U.S.
But analysts said the political element could not be
completely discounted. "(JAL's) reputation in the U.S. is
very important to them," one Tokyo analyst said.</p>
<p>JAL, Japan's largest domestic and international airline,
said the MD-11s would be used to replace its current fleet of
16 DC-10 models. The purchase is part of the airline's plans
to add 20 medium-capacity jet aircraft to its fleet between
1993 and 1998. A decision on which engines will be installed
hasn't been reached. Delivery of the MD-11s is set to begin
in late 1993, McDonnell Douglas said.</p>
<p>McDonnell Douglas said the JAL order brings to 340 the
total of firm orders and "other commitments" for the MD-11.
The jetliner, an updated version of the DC-10 model, made its
first flight test in January. "We're shooting for (Federal
Aviation Administration) certification in October, with
deliveries to begin soon thereafter," the company spokesman
said.</p>
<p>McDonnell Douglas said that JAL may convert some of its
MD-11 options to MD-12X orders if the company launches the
proposed program by the end of the year. The MD-12X could
seat up to 441 passengers in a two-class configuration,
compared with 323 passengers in the MD-11, the spokesman
said. The MD-12X would have a range of about 5,600 miles,
versus 8,000 miles for the MD-11. McDonnell Douglas declined
to disclose any cost estimates for the proposed MD-12X.</p>
<p>"If it needs new wings, which is almost certain, it would
be a formidable cost factor," said Paul Nisbet, an aerospace
analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. The development
cost could be more than $2 billion, he estimates. That is
roughly triple the $700 million the company has said it will
spend on the MD-11, which uses essentially the same wings and
fuselage as the DC-10.</p>
<p>Mr. Nisbet said the proposed MD-12X triple-engine jet
could be more fuel-efficient than the Boeing 747, which has
four engines, on trans-Atlantic and other medium-range
routes. The MD-12X wouldn't be able to carry enough fuel to
fly from the East Coast of the U.S. across the Pacific Ocean.
However, he cautioned that the plane is "more or less wishful
thinking" until the company has firm orders, prices and
delivery dates.</p>
