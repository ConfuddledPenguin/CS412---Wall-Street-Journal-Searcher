	<p class="article-leader">MONTREAL -- Canadian production of market pulp in February
dropped 7.3% from a year earlier, as the industry operated at
91% of capacity.
   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry
group, said Canadian mills produced 534,000 metric tons of
market pulp in the latest month, compared with 576,000 tons
in February 1989. A metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62
pounds.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The 91% operating rate in February was down from 99% in
January and 101% a year earlier. Operating rates can exceed
100% because some mills may operate for a limited period at
higher capacity than that for which they are rated.</p>
<p>For the first two months of this year, Canadian mills
produced 1,180,000 metric tons of market pulp, a 4.5% decline
from 1,236,000 tons a year earlier. The industry operated at
95% of capacity in the first two months, down from 103% a
year earlier.</p>
<p>Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to
producers of paper, sanitary and other products. The
statistics exclude pulp consumed at the producing mill or
shipped to another mill that is affiliated with the producing
mill. Canada is the world's largest producer of market pulp.</p>
<p>Total market shipments in January dropped 16% to 505,000
metric tons from 599,000 tons a year earlier. Shipments to
all markets were down.</p>
<p>Market shipments for the first two months dropped 13% to
998,000 metric tons from 1,146,000 tons a year earlier.</p>
<p>Canadian producer inventories at the end of February were
541,000 metric tons, a 30-day supply, compared with 512,000
tons, a 28-day supply, at the end of January, and 327,000
tons, a 15-day supply, at the end of February 1989.</p>
