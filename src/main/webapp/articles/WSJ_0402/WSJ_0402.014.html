	<p class="article-leader">SAN ANTONIO, Texas -- American Century Corp. said its
creditors committee approved in principle a modified
reorganization plan that would allow the company to emerge
from federal bankruptcy court proceedings by merging with
Houston-based Tescorp Inc.
   American Century said the board of Tescorp, which makes
and distributes oilfield products, also approved the merger
in principle. The reorganization plan would give Tescorp
shareholders almost 93% of American Century, which owned
Commerce Savings Association, a thrift that was placed in
federal conservatorship last year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Recently modified terms call for American Century
debenture holders to receive 7.25% of the stock of the
reorganized company, changed from 5%. The plan also provides
for 700,000 shares of a new class of $5 par value convertible
preferred to be issued to debenture holders. Those holders
also would receive warrants to purchase a total of two
million common shares over three years at an initial exercise
price of $3.50 a share.</p>
<p>Current American Century shareholders, meanwhile, would
get no shares; previously, they were allotted a 2.25% stake.
However, these holders would be given warrants to purchase a
total of 857,000 shares in the new company over a three-year
period for an initial exercise price of $3.50 a share,
American Century said.</p>
<p>The merger and the reorganization plan remain subject to
approval by the bankruptcy court, American Century's
debenture holders and Tescorp shareholders.</p>
