	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- The National Park Service here released
figures indicating MCA Inc. posted revenue of about $85
million in Yosemite National Park last year.
   The Park Service said MCA paid the government a franchise
fee of $635,772 to do business in Yosemite in 1989. Under
terms of its contract, MCA pays the government three-fourths
of 1% of annual revenue from Yosemite.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In 1988, MCA paid a franchise fee of about $590,000,
indicating revenue of about $78 million. Neither the
government nor MCA will disclose how much the company earns
from Yosemite.</p>
<p>MCA, a diversified entertainment concern that owns
Universal Studios, is the concessionaire for Yosemite,
providing lodging, meals, souvenirs, tours and recreational
activities. As reported, monopolistic concessionaire
contracts in national parks have been criticized by those who
believe the agreements are too favorable to private
companies.</p>
<p>After visiting Yosemite, Secretary of the Interior Manuel
Lujan called for a review of concessions policy nationwide.
Results of that review are expected in about a month. Renewal
of all concession contracts is on hold until the department
determines whether the policy should be changed.</p>
<p>MCA pays one of the lowest franchise fees among the more
than 500 concessionaires at national parks around the nation.
Though MCA's contract calls for the fee to be renegotiated
every five years, the amount hasn't been raised since the
contract was written in 1963. MCA purchased the concession
rights in 1973.</p>
