	<p class="article-leader">GALWAY, Ireland -- European Community finance ministers
agreed on the "overall design" of a plan for economic and
monetary union.
   In their first detailed discussion of the plan, 11 of the
12 ministers said they reached a consensus on the broad lines
of a system that would include an independent, federal
central banking system. British Chancellor of the Exchequer
John Major, who doesn't support a central bank, refused to
endorse the joint conclusions.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Most ministers said the meeting of minds would give
impetus to technical work that needs to be done before treaty
negotiations on the plan begin at the end of the year. "All
delegations indicated a large measure of agreement on the
ultimate objective," said Irish Finance Minister Albert
Reynolds.</p>
<p>The 11 ministers agreed they would create an "independent
and federally structured central banking institution" similar
to the "EuroFed" proposed late last month by the EC
Commission. But they failed to back the European Currency
Unit as a future single EC currency.</p>
