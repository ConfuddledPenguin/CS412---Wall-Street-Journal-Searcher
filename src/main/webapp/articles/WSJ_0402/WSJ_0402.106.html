	<p class="article-leader">Advisers to United Airlines labor unions and directors
conferred during the weekend in an effort to reach agreement
on an employee acquisition of UAL Corp. before a board
meeting today.
   Both sides were seeking an accord before the outbreak of
hostilities in a proxy fight by UAL's largest shareholder,
Coniston Partners, which supports the employee bid and is
seeking to oust UAL directors at the annual meeting April 26.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The biggest outstanding issue between the unions and
directors is price. The labor group has offered roughly $185
a share, or about $4 billion, for a 75% stake, and the board
is seeking about $220 a share, or $4.8 billion. Other open
questions include financing and the composition of
management.</p>
<p>Today's board meeting is scheduled to be conducted by
telephone. If no agreement is reached but the two sides are
making progress, some people familiar with UAL said the talks
might continue. But both Coniston and the board are ready to
unleash attacks on each other that could make a peaceful
agreement more difficult to reach.</p>
