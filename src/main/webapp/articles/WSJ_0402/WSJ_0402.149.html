	<p class="article-leader">Is the stock market running out of gas?
   Trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange has been
ebbing this year. In January, an average 172.5 million shares
changed hands each day, more than the 165.5 million shares
that traded on the average day in 1989. But in February
average daily volume fell to 155.9 million, and last month
daily trading averaged 152.6 million shares.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Prices haven't followed the volume pattern. From a high in
the Dow Jones Industrial Average of 2810.15 on Jan. 2, prices
slipped 9.5% in January. They regained some of that lost
ground in February and reclaimed even more in March to end
3.7% lower than the record.</p>
<p>To investors already nervous about high interest rates,
rising inflation and an uncertain economic outlook, however,
the increasingly sluggish trading activity is one more reason
to be wary of the stock market.</p>
<p>But some analysts argue that with few exceptions, volume
isn't a very good indicator of where prices are headed. In a
1988 study that tracked volume and price moves as far back as
1915, Laszlo Birinyi, president of Birinyi Associates, a
stock market strategy firm, found that "volume is not a lead
indicator of any sort of reliability."</p>
<p>Mr. Birinyi says his study showed that there were links
between prices and increases and decreases in trading volume,
but that the links were coincident, not predictive. For
instance, in bull markets he found that either volume peaked
long before prices or else volume fluctuated widely during
the course of a rally. In short, he says, "any relationships
between price and activity are random."</p>
<p>Bear markets show similar patterns. In the 1977 market
decline, for example, volume fluctuated while prices fell.
"We doubt that investors could have relied on current volume
trend as a way to avoid losses in this period," Mr. Birinyi
says.</p>
<p>The only exception -- and it is a dangerous one -- is if
volume expands rapidly in a falling market. "If you do have a
pickup in volume in a declining market, then you have to
worry," he says. "The most dangerous patterns seem to be
trading increases of nearly 100% during a bear pattern. In
these times, price declines are especially severe."</p>
<p>But predicting major moves based on volume is futile, Mr.
Birinyi asserts. In the three months before the 1982 bull
market began, for instance, the volume of trading in the Dow
Jones Industrial Average stocks declined. "The relationship
between volume and prices or rallies just doesn't exist," he
says.</p>
<p>Nonsense, counters Mark Leibovit, author of the Volume
Reversal Survey, a Sedona, Ariz., newsletter that relies
heavily on trading volume to predict what's ahead for stock
prices.</p>
<p>"There's an old adage that says volume precedes price,"
says Mr. Leibovit. "I've been doing this for 20 years and
I've never found a better indicator."</p>
<p>He contends that volume signals overall demand for stocks.
When a big move up is beginning, he says, high volume cleans
out many of the investors or traders who wanted to sell,
leaving the remaining demand to drive prices higher. "Like a
balloon, prices begin rising because there's no resistance,"
he says.</p>
<p>Similarly, at the beginning of a big down move a big surge
in trading volume satisfies the waning demand for stocks and
further selling drives prices lower. "That's when prices go
down like a lead balloon," he says.</p>
<p>March's price gains have been welcome, says Mr. Leibovit,
but the sluggish volume in recent days likely means the rally
is about exhausted. "I'm not ready to throw in the towel
yet," he says, "but my basic view is that if we're not at the
top already, we're only about 50 points away."</p>
<p>After that, he says, the longer-term trend down will
reassert itself. He saw that trend beginning in January when,
for three consecutive weeks, prices fell on expanding volume.
"That, to me, was pretty negative," he says. He expects
prices to eventually work their way back down to the January
closing low of 2543.24 or even lower. "I paint myself more in
the bear camp long term," he said.</p>
<p>Kenneth Spence, a technical analyst at Salomon Brothers,
also finds trading volume useful in assessing stock market
performance, although he cautions that investors shouldn't
rely too heavily on volume alone. Breadth, or the number of
stocks rising compared to the number falling, is also
important, he says.</p>
<p>"What technicians get concerned about is rising prices on
narrow breadth and light volume," says Mr. Spence. "That's
indicative of selective strength, not broadbased strength.
The broader the base, the more sustainable the health of the
market."</p>
<p>Narrow breadth and light volume is confronting investors
right now in the stock market, he says. And while he doesn't
predict an imminent decline in stock prices, Mr. Spence urges
caution. "The volume and breadth don't tell us anything about
how far prices could fall, but they are flashing a big yellow
light."</p>
