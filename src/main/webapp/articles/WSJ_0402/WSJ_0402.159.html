	<p class="article-leader">TAIPEI, Taiwan -- The Finance Ministry of Taiwan said it
will sell 46.3 million shares valued at 25.76 billion New
Taiwan dollars (US$975.7 million) of three state-owned banks
on the Taiwan Stock Exchange to quicken the pace of its
public-offering plan.
   The ministry said it will sell 23 million shares of First
Commercial Bank, 2.2 million shares of Hua Nan Commercial
Bank and 21.1 million shares of Chang Hwa Commercial Bank.
The Bank of Communications will be underwriter. The stocks
will be sold from April 14 to 19.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The underwriting price for First Commercial Bank will be
at NT$561.96 a share, NT$587.35 a share for Hua Nan
Commercial Bank and NT$545.88 a share for Chang Hwa
Commercial Bank.</p>
<p>The Taiwan provincial government is also planning to sell
more than 100 million of its shares later. The government
holds stakes of 74.4% in First Commercial, 58.1% in Hua Nan
and 56.2% in Chang Hwa. The sales will leave the government
with 51% of the shares of the three banks.</p>
<p>Brokers expected the news to boost the stock market.</p>
<p>Taiwan launched its public-offering drive in March 1989 by
selling about 150 million shares of state-owned China Steel
Corp. The proposal to slash the government holdings in the
three banks was approved by Taiwan's cabinet in May 1989. The
government has also agreed to a public offer or partial
public offer of 15 other state-owned companies such as China
Shipbuilding Corp. and Taiwan Machinery Manufacturing Corp.</p>
