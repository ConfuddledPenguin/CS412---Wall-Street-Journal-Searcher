	<p class="article-leader">MANILA, the Philippines -- Nobody was closer to Ferdinand
Marcos than Eduardo "Danding" Cojuangco Jr.
   Given monopoly control of the nation's biggest industry,
coconuts, he built a patronage base for his boss that
permeated every level of Philippine society. Mr. Marcos named
Danding the godfather of his son, "Bong Bong." Danding named
his own boy "Marcos."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Now, nobody is closer to becoming this nation's next chief
of state than Danding Cojuangco. Even the strenuous
opposition of President Corazon Aquino seems unlikely to
derail his attempt to succeed her.</p>
<p>The comeback of this crony king, a feared hatchet man who
has been charged by the Aquino government with stealing
control of more than $1.5 billion of corporate assets, casts
a dark cloud over democracy in the Philippines. In three
decades of public service, Mr. Cojuangco has never shown any
desire to share power with anyone but Mr. Marcos. And he's
dead.</p>
<p>"There's no way Danding could lead within a pluralistic
system that held him accountable," says Stephen Bosworth,
U.S. ambassador to the Philippines from 1984 to 1987. "He
operates best in the netherworld."</p>
<p>Two currents are pushing a back-slide in the Philippines:
Mr. Cojuangco's own enduring power and the chronic weakness
of his first cousin and political enemy, Cory Aquino. With
shortages of rice, water, electricity, transportation and
other necessities growing, a drumbeat is building here for an
autocrat to take charge again. Mr. Cojuangco, who adroitly
built his own political base to weather Mr. Marcos's
downfall, is emerging as the leading candidate for the job.
Even if Mrs. Aquino survives the military discontent that has
bred six coup attempts in her four years of power, she or a
chosen successor will have difficulty beating a Cojuangco-led
ticket in elections set for 1992.</p>
<p>"Danding is more ruthless, more cunning than the rest" of
Mrs. Aquino's opponents, says Bren Guiao, governor of
Pampanga province and a close Aquino ally. "He has better
political acumen, but more importantly, he has more
resources."</p>
<p>Other likely presidential candidates include Vice
President Salvador Laurel and Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile. Both
are better known abroad than Danding, but neither enjoys his
stature in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Though well aware that Washington loathes him, Danding and
his supporters insist that as president he would make every
attempt to maintain strong relations with the U.S. Danding
himself hasn't taken a public position on the U.S. military
bases in the Philippines -- a perennial source of controversy
between the two countries. But some of his supporters sound
as if they are bending over backwards to accommodate the
Americans. "If we have our way, they can have the bases
without any rent," says Eliodoro Castro, one of Danding's
oldest allies in his home province of Tarlac.</p>
<p>The rehabilitation of "Boss" Danding could only happen in
one of the most peculiar political cultures in the world.
While U.S. officials exult over the restoration of democracy
under Mrs. Aquino, Philippine politics remains much the same
today as during Mr. Marcos's 20-year rule and prior regimes.
It is a system rooted in the ancient ways of clan warfare,
molded by four centuries of Spanish feudalism, and coated
with a thin gloss of U.S.-style democracy.</p>
<p>Issues and ideology mean little. Political parties and
platforms are window dressing for patronage and personality
cults. What counts is who can deliver the favors, who can buy
the votes, who can arm the goons.</p>
<p>In these black arts, the 54-year-old Mr. Cojuangco is
without equal, say friends and foes alike. Danding, who was
interviewed for this story but wouldn't allow direct
quotations, says his reputation is exaggerated.</p>
<p>During the Marcos era, he amassed a security force of
thousands, drilled by Israeli mercenaries. But as one friend
put it, Danding preferred to "kill with kindness"; he
personally handed out Christmas bonuses to employees of the
many companies he controlled, pretending the money came from
his own pocket, workers say. His underlings continue to
arrange surgery for peasants, loans for teachers and
vote-buying funds for ward captains.</p>
<p>Despite his bitter conflicts with the Aquinos, Danding
helped pay for the Boston home in which they lived during
exile. And while in exile himself a few years ago, Mr.
Cojuangco phoned an ally on the island of Negros -- 28 years
to the day after the two warlords first hooked up.</p>
<p>"How can you turn your back on a guy like that?" remarks
Alfonso Lacson, the recipient of the call. "I couldn't do
anything but cry."</p>
<p>Mrs. Aquino, however, despises Danding. While she doesn't
believe her cousin actually plotted the 1983 murder of her
late husband, Benigno "Ninoy" Aquino Jr., she is convinced he
knew about the plans, confidants say. Danding vehemently
denies any knowledge of the plot to kill Ninoy.</p>
<p>"Danding is capable of taking lives," says his lawyer,
Gabriel Villareal. "But he didn't do that."</p>
<p>Mrs. Aquino, unimpressed by such denials, canceled the
passports of Danding and his family just after a U.S. jet
evacuated the Cojuangcos and Marcoses to Hawaii in 1986. Of
the nearly $4 billion of corporate assets allegedly stolen by
cronies of Mr. Marcos and now sequestered by the Aquino
government, Danding controlled roughly half.</p>
<p>Until last fall, Danding lived quietly in exile in
Riverside, Calif. But on Nov. 26 -- a few days before the
bloodiest coup attempt against the Aquino government -- he
slipped back into the Philippines with a passport obtained in
Los Angeles through some consular officials, who have since
been recalled. Danding announced he had returned to
"vindicate my honor and that of my family."</p>
<p>In a rambling conversation at lunch in his mother's
suburban Manila home, Mr. Cojuangco fumes over his treatment
by the government. He quips that the next president will be
less vindictive than Mrs. Aquino, as a coterie of his
brother, his lawyer, his public-relations man and several
maids chuckle nervously. The elegant fish and rice dishes
come in waves over a long afternoon. Danding smokes heavily
but avoids fatty foods on doctor's orders.</p>
<p>His homecoming has thrown Philippine politics into
disarray. Most of the same 80 or so powerful clans that
supported Mr. Marcos, and presidents before him, still
control the provinces for Mrs. Aquino. But many members of
this political elite resent her advocacy of land reform and
fear her inability to control the military and provide basic
services. Moreover, Mrs. Aquino's promise to step down in
1992 has sent politicians scurrying for new patrons. Many are
lining up behind Danding.</p>
<p>"Those who rode on Cory's popularity are facing a serious
decision," says Rafael Coscolluela, vice governor of the
province of Negros Occidental and an Aquino ally, though now
edging toward the Cojuangco camp. "Danding is the only
obvious opposition candidate who has a chance of winning. But
he could be bad for the country in one sense: He'll bring the
polarization to a head."</p>
<p>He already has. The sharpest reaction to Danding's return
has come from cousin Cory. A few days after Danding arrived,
she ordered Solicitor General Francisco Chavez, a slick,
machine-gun-toting prosecutor who likens himself to Eliot
Ness, to take personal charge of the government's legal cases
against Mr. Cojuangco. And she publicly suggested that her
cousin might have been involved in a December putsch that
left more than 100 people dead, though she presented no
evidence. Danding says he had no knowledge that a coup was in
preparation.</p>
<p>He insists he is the victim of political persecution. He
defends his management of the coconut business and others,
convinced that his creation of cartels helped Filipinos
extract higher commodity prices from multinational
corporations. And he says he doesn't understand why his
family is forbidden to come home.</p>
<p>"They've taken his passport, his assets and now his
family," says Selen Saguyod, a judge and Danding disciple.</p>
<p>The Cojuangco feud dates back decades. The oldest son of a
half-American mother and a father who died when the boy was
16, Danding became a maverick within the wealthy Cojuangco
clan at an early age. While his more-genteel cousins such as
Cory earned degrees in the U.S., Danding dropped out of an
agricultural college in California and returned home to run
his family's businesses.</p>
<p>He soon angered relatives by leading a strike against one
of their sugar mills by planters demanding more money. Some
years later, Danding was ousted from a family-run bank and
forced to sell his shares.</p>
<p>In 1965, he ran for Congress against Mrs. Aquino's younger
brother, Jose "Peping" Cojuangco Jr., under the banner of a
new patron, a presidential challenger named Ferdinand Marcos.
In an election marked by violence and record vote-buying,
Peping retained his seat, but Danding helped the new
president carry Tarlac province, northwest of Manila.</p>
<p>Two years later, Danding was elected provincial governor
when Benigno Aquino, a Marcos enemy, didn't run for
re-election. As governor, Danding armed vigilante groups to
fight local Communist insurgents with whom Mr. Aquino had
been on relatively good terms. The cousins tried to make
peace for a time, but in 1969, the mayors and ward captains
of Tarlac again had to choose sides when Danding challenged
Peping for Congress. After some early campaign skirmishes,
Peping bowed out and Danding won.</p>
<p>It was during Marcos martial law, 1972 to 1980, that
Danding reached the apex of crony capitalism. In 1975, he
gained control of a Cojuangco bank, First United, when Mrs.
Aquino's family was forced to sell it because of new capital
requirements. Danding arranged for the Philippine Coconut
Producers Federation to buy the Aquino shares at a 100%
premium -- a family favor since forgotten, friends grouse. He
took a 10% stake in the bank himself as a commission, and a
contract to manage it.</p>
<p>The United Coconut Planters Bank, as it was renamed, grew
into one of the most powerful financial institutions in
Southeast Asia, thanks to a series of generous presidential
decrees. In one, Mr. Marcos extended a levy on the sale of
coconut products and mandated that the money be deposited
interest-free in the industry's new bank. The levy's
ostensible purpose was to back development projects for the
coconut industry. The fund gave Danding control of $500
million, which he managed like a personal fortune.</p>
<p>According to government documents, he ingratiated himself
with Imelda Marcos, the dictator's wife, by doling out
coconut funds to her pet cultural projects and the Miss
Universe Pageant (she was once chosen Miss Manila). With levy
money, Danding took a controlling stake in San Miguel Corp.,
the Philippines' giant food and beverage conglomerate, and
then bankrolled a new chemical company.</p>
<p>Above all, though, Danding used the levy funds to buy up
coconut-oil mills and create a national milling and trading
cartel that he controlled. His rationale was simple. Although
the Philippines supplied 80% of the world's coconut trade,
multinational traders bought the coconut meat -- called copra
-- from Filipino farmers, waited for prices to rise, and then
sold for hefty profits to oil millers overseas.</p>
<p>Under the system Danding created, farmers were forced to
sell all copra to his new cartel, which became the sole
authorized exporter of coconut oil. The monopoly increased
hard-currency earnings for millers -- most of whom were
partners or associates of Danding -- but at the expense of
small coconut farmers.</p>
<p>"Danding monopolized the whole thing," says Emmanuel
Pelaez, then a coconut farmer and now Philippine ambassador
to the U.S. In 1982, Mr. Pelaez was severely wounded in an
ambush after helping some farmers sell their copra directly
to foreign buyers.</p>
<p>Danding didn't stop with coconuts. Once the bank was up
and running, he made loans to partners and friends in a
variety of businesses. He grew particularly enamored of
monopolies. He tried creating cartels in rice, sugar, flour,
groceries and soft drinks, but ran out of time when "people
power" -- as the popular uprising was called -- overthrew Mr.
Marcos in 1986.</p>
<p>The entire coco-fund empire, including the bank, the oil
mills and the San Miguel shares, are now under sequestration
by Mrs. Aquino's special anti-crony commission. The
government has asked the courts to declare the coconut levy a
"public fund," which would help clear the way for regulators
to confiscate the assets. Danding's lawyers counter that the
funds came from "private" contributions by oil millers, and
were invested properly on behalf of the coconut industry.
They say the assets belong to farmers, who entrusted them
with Danding to manage.</p>
<p>The Philippine Supreme Court, in ruling on a motion
several months ago, signaled agreement with the government's
position. But it may take years for the nation's plodding
judiciary to determine the fate of the coco-fund empire. In
the meantime, officials responsible for the sequestered
assets say there is little to prevent Danding from siphoning
funds from the properties to help finance his run for the
presidency. His executives still manage most of the
companies, under loose supervision from low-paid government
auditors who have more to gain from helping him than foiling
him.</p>
<p>A Cojuangco reconciliation still isn't out of the
question. Though Mrs. Aquino isn't likely to make peace with
Danding, her brother, Peping, a congressman and leader of the
ruling party, may. The two cousins, who are about the same
age, were playmates growing up, and have remained on speaking
terms over the years despite their political run-ins.</p>
<p>People close to both Cojuangco camps say the male cousins
may have already agreed to cooperate if Mrs. Aquino doesn't
run for re-election. Danding won't comment on such an
alliance, but he acknowledges that even while he was in
California exile, Peping flew there to meet with him. Peping
declined to be interviewed.</p>
<p>Danding's supporters aren't waiting to find out if the
alliance is fact or fiction. Throughout the Philippines, his
henchmen are holding local neighborhood meetings. They are
drumming up sympathy, much as followers of Ninoy Aquino did a
decade ago, for their "persecuted" patron. And they are
circulating petitions demanding that the boss run for
president.</p>
<p>Support is building within the Manila business class as
well. In the Makati financial district, many Filipino
executives speak of Danding as the one Marcos crony who
reinvested his money in the Philippines, and whose businesses
expanded. He is particularly admired for his staunch
nationalism: the perception that he tried to throw off the
yoke of foreign exploitation in the coconut industry.</p>
<p>Mrs. Aquino's strategy for clipping her cousin's wings
rests on the courts. But Danding's people also worry about
another force of political suasion: the U.S.</p>
<p>In Washington, where congressional support for Mrs. Aquino
and her "people power" revolution has been almost unanimous,
Danding's resurgence is being met with incredulity.</p>
<p>"Given Danding Cojuangco's intimate involvement in the
Marcos kleptocracy," says Rep. Stephen Solarz, the democrat
who chairs a key House subcommittee on Asian affairs, "it's
hard to believe the Filipino people would willingly turn the
reins of government over to him."</p>
<p>An officer at the U.S. embassy here warns that the
re-emergence of Marcos cronies would strain relations between
the two countries. But Mr. Bosworth, the former ambassador,
says that at least initially the U.S. would have to deal with
Danding "on a normal and legitimate basis" if he were
constitutionally elected. "The tone and nature of the
relationship would obviously depend on how he governed," he
adds.</p>
