	<p class="article-leader">GREENWICH, Conn. -- Finevest Foods Inc. said it suspended
its quarterly dividend of three cents a common share because
of a deficit resulting from its 1989 operating loss.
   Finevest, a dairy processor and wholesale distributor of
frozen foods and dairy products in the Southeast, said it
will save about $1.3 million annually from the payout
suspension. The company's 1989 net loss was $19 million on
sales of $700.8 million. The loss included a third-quarter
charge of $10.7 million from restructuring the company's
dairy operations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>With improved operating efficiencies from the
restructuring and with declining raw-milk costs this spring,
Finevest said it expects its dairy operation to return to
profitability this year.</p>
<p>Finevest shares fell 50 cents, to close at $7.50, in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday.</p>
