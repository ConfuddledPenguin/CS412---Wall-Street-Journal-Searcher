	<p class="article-leader">The dollar should remain near its current levels against
the yen in April following efforts by Japan and the six other
major industrialized nations to support the battered Japanese
currency, analysts said.
   The dollar will likely rise against the mark this month,
however, as nervousness over a continuing lack of clear-cut
plans for reunification with East Germany weakens the West
German currency, the analysts predicted.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Over the next 90 days, modest growth in the U.S. economy
and steady interest rates will prevent the dollar from losing
much ground against a more confident yen and the mark,
according to the average forecast of 10 currency analysts
surveyed by Dow Jones International News Service in Tokyo,
Frankfurt, London and New York.</p>
<p>The average estimate places the dollar at 156.73 yen at
the end of April, with the U.S. unit at 155.80 yen by the end
of June. Projections for April were fairly tight compared
with a month earlier, and ranged from a high of 162 yen to a
low of 147 yen. The 90-day outlook was also spread fairly
evenly between 162 yen and 150 yen, except for one bearish
forecast of 136 yen.</p>
<p>In the March survey, the dollar was seen at 148.05 yen at
the end of March, and the January survey predicted the dollar
would be at 139.63 yen on March 31. The dollar closed late
Friday in New York at 158.35 yen.</p>
<p>The average of analysts' estimates pegs the dollar at
1.7150 marks by the end of April, with a fall to 1.6980 marks
by the end of June. The range of predictions for the mark's
level at the end of April was from a low of 1.65 marks to a
high of 1.75 marks.</p>
<p>Forecasts for the 90-day period were more widely
scattered, reflecting different long-term inflation and
interest-rate scenarios for West Germany; the U.S. unit was
seen trading as high as 1.80 marks and as low as 1.65 marks
at the end of June. That is more varied than predictions
voiced in last month's survey.</p>
<p>In March, the dollar was pegged at 1.6760 marks, and the
January outlook placed the U.S. unit at 1.6820 marks by the
end of last month. The dollar finished in New York Friday at
1.6940 marks.</p>
<p>In Tokyo late Monday morning, the dollar was trading at
160.20 yen, up from 159.97 yen at the opening and up from
Friday's Tokyo close of 157.65 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S.
currency was trading at about 1.6990 marks, unchanged from
the opening quote, but up from Friday's Tokyo close of</p>
<p>Over the short term, capital outflow from Japan will
continue because of interest-rate differentials with the U.S.
and Europe, keeping the yen weak, said Robert White, vice
president and manager of corporate trading at First
Interstate of California in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>His view was shared by several other analysts, some of
whom emphasized that little will help the yen return to
significantly higher levels until structural changes occur in
the Japanese economy.</p>
<p>"It will take more than interest-rate hikes" to sort out
the pressures the yen has recently come under, said Christa
Bleyleben, a vice president at Bank of Boston. The Japanese
discount rate stands at 5.25%, to which it was raised March
20 by the Bank of Japan.</p>
<p>Analysts say the yen might get some help from this
weekend's meeting of G-7 treasury officials in Paris, where
exchange rates and world economic issues are expected to be
discussed. Besides Japan and the U.S., the G-7 consists of
West Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italy.</p>
<p>The meeting could produce a new accord on cooperation
among G-7 central banks to support the yen, as well as lead
to measures by the Japanese to restore foreign investors'
faith in the country.</p>
<p>Lack of support by other G-7 central banks for the Bank of
Japan's policy of relentlessly intervening to prop up the yen
has been a factor in the Japanese unit's recent tumble,
bolstering the market's view that Japanese monetary officials
are isolated and confused by the recent turmoil in their
financial markets.</p>
<p>Even if the Bank of Japan doesn't raise interest rates
again, money-market rates should rise enough to help the yen,
said one analyst. Another analyst, Richard Urwin, foreign
exchange economist at S.G. Warburg & Co. in London, said: "A
lot of the yen's bad news is {already} in the market."</p>
<p>A steadily clearer picture of how West Germany plans to
deal with German reunification should strengthen the mark
after an initial period of weakness in April, analysts said.</p>
<p>"The clearer the picture becomes, the better the mark will
do," said Susan Babcock, vice president of corporate foreign
exchange at Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp. in New York.
But until there are further policy announcements, the dollar
will gain against its West German counterpart, she said.</p>
<p>Over the longer term, however, the mark will firm as the
fundamental strength of the West German economy and growing
confidence in the Bundesbank's ability to manage inflation
undermines mark bearishness, analysts said.</p>
<p>"Fears about {West} German inflation are exaggerated . . .
the Bundesbank will handle inflation," said Earl Johnson, a
vice president at Harris Trust & Savings Bank in Chicago.</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson and others also cited the ability of the West
German economy to attract capital as a factor in favor of a
strengthening mark. The wide gap between West German
inflation and interest rates will provide a strong stimulus
to invest there, said Dieter Manderbach, a trader at
Norddeutsche Landesbank-Girozentrale in Hanover.</p>
<p>The March cost of living in West Germany rose a
preliminary 0.2%, up 2.8% from a year earlier; the current
interest rate on three-month Euro-mark deposits is 8 1/16%.</p>
<p>The British pound will be helped by high interest rates
this month, the analysts said. The British currency, plagued
by Britain's economic woes and the travails of Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher, is seen slipping from its recent levels to
an average of $1.6100 in 30 days and falling further to
$1.6075 in 90 days. Last month's survey placed the pound at
$1.6940 on March 31; January's estimate saw sterling at
$1.6362.</p>
<p>The pound finished at $1.6455 in New York on Friday.</p>
<p>Sterling will remain a high-yield, risky investment,
analysts said, as current high interest rates are maintained
while the British economy stagnates and the problems of the
ruling Conservative Party mount.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold for
current delivery settled at $370.20 an ounce, down 60 cents.
Estimated volume was a heavy 4.7 million ounces.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong Monday, gold was quoted at $369.75 an ounce.</p>
