	<p class="article-leader">MIAMI -- Grand Metropolitan PLC expects a 15% increase in
earnings per share in fiscal 1990 and believes that its U.S.
businesses will generate half its profits, Chairman Allen
Sheppard predicted.
   The forecast assumes a 5% inflation rate and 10% real
earnings growth, Mr. Sheppard said. In the year ended last
Sept. 30, the London-based food, retailing and drinks concern
posted per-share earnings of 55.6 pence, an 18.5% gain from
fiscal 1988.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Sheppard made his prediction while addressing
analysts, primarily from Britain, who this week toured some
of Grand Met's U.S. properties, including Heublein
distillers, Pearle health services, Pillsbury food and the
Burger King fast-food chain.</p>
<p>Contending that "we don't have any bad businesses," Mr.
Sheppard said Grand Met will concentrate near-term on
expanding Burger King and Pearle as "international
brandings," while developing "critical mass" for its food
businesses in Central Europe.</p>
<p>"We're looking for a stable of international brands --
that's our strategy," Mr. Sheppard said, adding that Grand
Met also is searching for "another Pearle that everybody else
has missed in service retailing."</p>
<p>Mr. Sheppard and Group Finance Director David Nash also
said they hope to have Grand Met American Depositary Receipts
listed on the New York Stock Exchange by September. ADRs are
receipts for shares of a foreign-based corporation, which
trade much like stock in the U.S.</p>
<p>"If we list I'd like to be able to issue some stock," Mr.
Nash said, indicating a total offering of perhaps $100
million. He and other Grand Met executives told analysts they
would expect considerable demand for such an offering in the
U.S.</p>
<p>Grand Met has received the first round of bids for its
U.S.-based Alpo Petfoods Inc. unit and is "in the middle of
conversations with a number of serious purchasers," the
company said.</p>
<p>Grand Met recently put Alpo up for sale because its goal
of building it into a billion-dollar business seemed
unobtainable, said Ian Martin, chief executive of Grand Met's
food sector.</p>
<p>Mr. Martin termed Alpo's recent entry into the cat-food
business "very successful." Although its market share is only
around 1%, he said would-be buyers have been "surprised at
the success" of the new business.</p>
<p>Reviewing Grand Met's extensive retailing (licensed
restaurants) group in Europe, Mr. Sheppard acknowledged that
Grand Met had "misread" the eating-out market in the United
Kingdom but is "back on track now."</p>
<p>As for overseas expansion of Pillsbury brands, Mr. Martin
said he foresees "significant" opportunities for Green Giant
vegetables and Haagen-Dazs premium ice cream. He said the
company is seriously considering building a Haagen-Dazs plant
somewhere in Europe.</p>
