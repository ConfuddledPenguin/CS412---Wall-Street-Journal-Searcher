	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo's stock prices continued to plunge Monday, as the
dollar soared above 160 yen and institutional investors
apparently began an aggressive sell-off.
   At the close of the morning session, the Nikkei index, an
average of 225 issues, was off 1720.13 points, or 5.7%, to
28260.32. That was sharply below the previous intraday low
for the year of 28830 on March 22.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The stock market was undercut by the surging dollar. The
U.S. currency met little resistance as it jumped to 160.25
yen late Monday morning, up from 158.35 yen late Friday in
New York.</p>
<p>That sent the stock market tumbling. Its slide also was
greased by fears that Japanese insurance companies would
begin selling stock at the start of their new fiscal year
this morning. A report in the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's
leading economic daily, suggesting that life and casualty
insurers -- among the country's biggest institutional
investors -- would reduce their Japanese stock holdings
appeared to be coming true, one stockbroker said Monday
morning. "They are selling already," she added.</p>
<p>The report magnified the market's troubles on Friday, when
fast-paced sell-offs by institutions trying to raise their
cash positions by the end of the fiscal year compounded
uncertainty about the market's direction.</p>
<p>On Friday, the indicator plunged 1045.71 points, or 3.4%,
to 29980.45, closing below the 30000-point level for the
second time in March. On March 22, the index dropped to
29843.34. The index lost 237.41 points Thursday.</p>
<p>Tokyo stock prices plunged in moderate trading Friday
because of fast-paced selloffs by institutions that raised
cash positions on the last trading day of fiscal 1990.
Uncertainty about the market's future deepened.</p>
<p>The Nikkei Index of 225 issues fell 1045.71 points to
29980.45, closing below the 30000-point level for the second
time in March.</p>
<p>In London, meanwhile, stocks fell as most investors closed
existing positions on the last trading day of the first
quarter and found little inspiration to trade anew.</p>
<p>Tokyo traders said volatile moves in the foreign-exchange
market and higher yields on the bond market dried up buying
interest. Meanwhile, the pace of decline in stock prices was
accelerated by index-linked program selling by foreign
brokerate houses, traders said.</p>
<p>The Nikkei index, which ended the Friday morning session
with an 850.15-point loss, rebounded moderately in
midafternoon with the help of buying by some investment trust
funds. But the index tumbled again, to the intraday low of
29827, in final rounds of sell-offs, before the average
collected 150 points in the last 15 minutes of trading.</p>
<p>Volume on the first section was estimated at about 500
million shares, down from 685 million shares Thursday.</p>
<p>Losers outnumbered gainers 866 to 133, while 93 issues
were unchanged.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section was down 59.37 points, or 2.59%, to 2227.48,
after falling 20 points Thursday.</p>
<p>The second section index fell 37.45 points, or 0.97%, to
3817.90. The index gained 11.10 points Thursday. Volume was
estimated at nine million shares, down from 10 million shares
Thursday.</p>
<p>The market had seen small-capital stock prices pushed up
by "window dressing" operations by some institutions, which
evaluate year-end values of their holdings according to
Friday's close. These stock prices had been expected to add
further gains Friday.</p>
<p>But such expectations were shattered when the market began
the day with active selling by foreign investors. The strong
selling pressure made institutions give up strategic buying
and begin reducing their positions instead, analysts said.</p>
<p>Dealers also refrained from buying Friday.</p>
<p>"Every Japanese brokerage house couldn't do anything
beyond remain on the sidelines because they knew that if they
bought, they'd only be battered by heavy selling," said
Yoshihiro Ito, general manager of stock trading at Okasan
Securities.</p>
<p>As the Nikkei index extended losses during Friday
afternoon, individual investors finally joined the selling
activity, as prices fell to levels that require investors to
place additional margin, the official said.</p>
<p>Shin Tokoi, deputy general manager of stock trading at
County NatWest Securities, said market expectations that the
yen will weaken further and top the 160-yen level against the
dollar was strong, despite the yen's temporal recovery in the
middle of the day.</p>
<p>The heavy selling by foreign investors and the continually
weakening yen led some investors to blame Japanese politics,
which are often poorly appraised by foreign nations.</p>
<p>Traders predict stock prices will drift at low levels this
week.</p>
<p>"The market has no strength for a strong rebound at the
moment," one analyst said, adding that the Nikkei index will
fluctuate around the 30000-point level this week.</p>
<p>High-technology shares, which advanced strongly this past
week on expectations that these exporters will benefit from
the yen's weakness, were targets of active profit-taking
Friday.</p>
<p>Fanuc plummeted 320 yen to 7,450 yen ($2.05 to $47.62).
Kyocera fell 210 yen to 7,560 yen. NEC dropped 50 yen to
2,120 yen and Hitachi Ltd. declined 50 yen to 1,590 yen.</p>
<p>NTT rose 30,000 yen to 1,160,000 yen following the
government's announcement to freeze discussion over a breakup
of the giant telephone company for five years, until 1995.
But market sentiment was too sluggish Friday to respond to
the news widely, traders said.</p>
<p>In London, shares languished within a very narrow band
much of the day, as traders said participants were waiting
for the opening of a new quarter this week.</p>
<p>But an early weak start on Wall Street gave London shares
a fresh nudge lower, although traders said there wasn't much
behind the drift downward.</p>
<p>Some traders said trading probably would remain sparse
until fresh earnings and indicators were disclosed later this
week.</p>
<p>"We're not inclined to do anything just at the moment,"
said one dealer. "I'm afraid there's a lot of market maker
price movement but not a lot behind it."</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 share index was off
15.1 points to 2247.9, and just above its late Friday
afternoon intraday minimum of 2245.5, but lower than its
midmorning peak of 2271.</p>
<p>The Financial Times 30 share index fell 12.5 points to
1768.7. Volume amounted to a sketchy 453.7 million shares,
little changed from Thursday's 435.2 million issues.</p>
<p>In the extremely quiet market, dealers said there were few
overall features to discuss. Many said a large part of any
price movement among the major stocks came as a result of
market makers adjusting prices to see if they could lure some
fresh buyers to the scene.</p>
<p>Among individual shares, British Steel gained 4 pence to
144 pence (6.5 cents to $2.36). Analysts said the shares
gained after the company said that because of a pension fund
surplus, results for the next few years will be better than
expected.</p>
<p>Grand Metropolitan, the food and drinks giant, shed 11
pence to 585 pence in mild profit-taking after a very strong
surge in the week, thanks to bullish news emerging from
analysts' visits to the company's Burger King, Pearle Vision
and Pillsbury operations in the U.S.</p>
<p>Pearson, the publishing conglomerate, climbed 4 pence to
695 pence after saying that 1989 pretax profit gained 26%,
beating market expectations. Polly Peck jumped 7 pence to 400
pence on the back of strong earnings disclosed Thursday.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Europe, prices closed higher in Brussels,
Paris, Frankfurt, Milan, and Zurich, and mixed in Amsterdam
and Stockholm. South African gold stocks closed lower.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, stocks ended down in Sydney, Singapore and
Wellington; and higher in Taipei and Seoul. Prices ended
little changed in Manila and Hong Kong.
