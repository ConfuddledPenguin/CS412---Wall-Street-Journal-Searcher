	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The International Monetary Fund warned
Liberia that it is facing expulsion from the 152-nation
organization because of its $395.3 million in loan arrears.
   The IMF executive board on Friday approved a "declaration
of non-cooperation" that could lead to the removal of Liberia
from the IMF by Aug. 30, unless it "resumes active
cooperation" with the IMF in resolving its overdue
obligations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>IMF officials said this was the first time the IMF has
adopted such a policy declaration involving a member country
with overdue loan payments. The IMF soon may issue a similar
warning to the Sudan, which is about $1.2 billion in arrears
on its IMF loans.</p>
<p>The IMF said Liberia has "persisted in its failure to
fulfill it obligations" to the IMF, although it has made
payments to other creditors.</p>
