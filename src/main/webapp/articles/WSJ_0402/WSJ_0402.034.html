	<p class="article-leader">The Office of Thrift Supervision agreed to postpone the
appointment of a receiver for Franklin Savings Association of
Ottawa, Kan., pending the trial of a lawsuit challenging the
thrift office's dealings with Franklin.
   Franklin, in turn, agreed to withdraw its request for an
injunction that would have prohibited the OTS from appointing
a receiver and liquidating any of the thrift's $11.4 billion
in assets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The agreements effectively forestalled a court ruling on
the constitutionality of M. Danny Wall's appointment as
director of the OTS.</p>
<p>"We just didn't touch that issue and didn't have to," said
Judge Dale E. Saffels, who is presiding over Franklin's
lawsuit in federal court in Topeka, Kan.</p>
<p>Franklin and a handful of other thrifts are seeking to
block certain OTS actions because, they argue, Mr. Wall
should have been appointed by President Bush rather than
Congress. The OTS is currently appealing a decision favoring
that argument in a lawsuit brought by Olympic Federal Savings
& Loan Association of Berwyn, Ill. In a similar lawsuit
brought by Benjamin Franklin Federal Savings & Loan
Association of Portland, Ore., the OTS won the first round
when Judge Helen J. Frye of Portland refused to block the
appointment of a receiver for the thrift. Benjamin Franklin
was placed in conservatorship on Feb. 21.</p>
<p>Franklin Savings was placed in conservatorship Feb. 16
after the OTS forced the institution to immediately recognize
about $119 million in losses on futures positions it held as
a hedge against losses in its $10.26 billion portfolio of
mortgage-backed securities.</p>
<p>Franklin filed suit against the OTS on March 12 and won an
order from Judge Saffels, temporarily barring the OTS from
appointing a receiver. The suit also challenges Mr. Wall's
appointment and the OTS's use of new thrift accounting rules
in determining whether the institution was in need of a
conservator. Judge Saffels scheduled the trial for June 25 in
Topeka.</p>
