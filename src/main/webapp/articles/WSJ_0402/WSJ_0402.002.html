	<h3>Abreast of the Market: Stocks That Soared in 1st Quarter Could Run Out of Gas by the Fall</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Will the first quarter's dream portfolio
become nightmare stocks by the fourth period?
   It could happen. Investors don't expect all of the first
quarter's winning industry groups to be still flying high at
year end. The ideal portfolio in the just-ended quarter was
full of growth stocks and some shares of companies whose
fortunes swing with the economy; stocks sensitive to interest
rates were notable by their absence.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But things change, and the transformation from dream to
nightmare could begin this quarter. Economic-cycle stocks
could be vulnerable the rest of this year, some analysts say,
while certain financial stocks could rebound.</p>
<p>Few forecasters are predicting a recession this year,
though the sharp rise in interest rates during the first
quarter could slow domestic demand. Exports also could slow
because the dollar has strengthened.</p>
<p>"Sales and inflation figures are going to start to
moderate," predicts Michael Strauss, chief economist at UBS
Securities Inc. "Underlying growth in the economy should be
weaker in the second quarter." Overall growth in the second
half of the year could be less than 1.5%, says Mr. Strauss,
who expects the Federal Reserve to respond to slackening
growth by nudging short-term interest rates a bit lower
around mid-year.</p>
<p>Slowing growth could test the courage of investors who
hoped that a reacceleration of the economy would continue to
boost cyclical shares.</p>
<p>"We think there is enough uncertainty in the economic
growth outlook that as we move through the year people will
lose conviction in cyclicals," says David Rajala, vice
president at One Federal Asset Management. "The
`safety-first' theme will resurrect itself."</p>
<p>In the first quarter, "safety" meant growth stocks.
Winning industry groups, such as semiconductors and software,
are full of companies generating strong earnings because of
their dominant franchises and unique products.</p>
<p>Air freight was the quarter's hottest industry group with
a gain of 19.6%. Federal Express, one stock in that group,
advanced 21.8% last quarter, partially due to takeover rumors
but mainly because of price increases in the freight industry
that promise stronger earnings ahead.</p>
<p>"The swing from price cutting to an environment of price
increases has put life in these stocks," says David Guthrie,
analyst at Morgan, Keegan & Co.</p>
<p>Storage Technology, the best-performing stock on the New
York Stock Exchange with a gain of 81.9%, has all the
characteristics of a first-quarter favorite.</p>
<p>First, the company is slicing debt from its balance sheet.
Storage Technology issued six million shares last month to
help pay down $285 million in high-coupon debt.</p>
<p>Second, the company has a product that makes it dominant
in the computer-tape library market, says Mark Morris,
analyst at Hanifen, Imhoff Inc. "They own the tape library
market with no real competitor," he adds.</p>
<p>And, Storage Technology's earnings could grow 32% this
year to $1.86 a share, Mr. Morris estimates, an increase in
line with proven growth stocks.</p>
<p>EMC Corp., the No. 2 gainer on the Big Board, has a strong
alliance with Storage Technology. But the maker of computer
memory products also has other hallmarks of a first-quarter
winner, such as a broad, diversified customer base and a
niche product. Moreover, Richard Egan, chief executive
officer, says EMC finished the quarter with little debt and a
lot of cash on the balance sheet.</p>
<p>Investors choosing among the cyclical stocks looked for
companies that had dominant positions in their industry.
Fluor, a part of the heavy-construction industry group, which
rose 13.2% for a No.3-ranked increase, is a world-wide leader
in engineering and construction. Its shares rose 16.3% in the
quarter.</p>
<p>Stocks in the construction, heavy machinery, industrial
technology and factory-equipment industry groups also
benefited during the quarter from perceptions of higher
investment in factory and infrastructure rebuilding in the
U.S. and around the world. The rise in these shares reflects
"a shift in the economy to capital spending" and away from
military spending and consumption, says Alan Dorsey, analyst
at Dillon Read.</p>
<p>Some analysts say the direction of interest rates will
tell the stock market's story at the end of 1990. Their
near-term bet is that short-term rates will fall a bit while
long-term rates stay where they are or even rise. If that
happens, many of the shares of well-run savings-and-loan
associations and financing companies that can buy money
cheaply and lend it more expensively could benefit, according
to Nancy Spady, analyst at Morgan Stanley.</p>
<p>But investors should venture cautiously into thrift
stocks, Ms. Spady says. "You really want to focus on the
single-family housing lenders," she says. She is recommending
three: H.F. Ahmanson, Great Western Financial and Golden West
Financial.</p>
<p>Poor first-quarter performers included banks with suspect
loan portfolios, insurance companies with suspect bond
portfolios and highly leveraged companies of any type. But
some good companies were tarred, and investors are beginning
to differentiate the good financial stocks from the bad.</p>
<p>"We have begun to purchase selected insurance stocks such
as General Re and Chubb," says William Kufta, senior vice
president at Pitcairn Financial Management. Mr. Kufta also is
"looking for values" and preparing to buy bank stocks. "We're
doing our best to identify the true risks in loan
portfolios," he adds.</p>
<p>In another category, Joseph McAlinden, director of
research at Dillon Read, thinks basic materials stocks will
outperform the market in the months ahead. Last quarter, the
basic materials sector, which includes companies such as
Aluminum Co. of America and Union Carbide, lagged behind the
Dow Jones Equity Market Index of 704 stocks.</p>
<p>"Companies that are sensitive to GNP {gross national
product, or a nation's total value of goods and services} can
be risky as we go into the second quarter," Mr. McAlinden
concedes. But he argues that companies have just about worked
off once-bloated raw materials inventories. Soon, they will
go back out into the market and start bidding up prices for
copper, aluminum and other essential industrial commodities,
he says.</p>
<p>"You want to be emphasizing the materials companies now,"
he says, adding: "Amax in the aluminum stocks, and copper
stocks such as Phelps Dodge."</p>
<p>What about the dollar's recent strength? Won't that make
U.S. basic materials producers less competitive?</p>
<p>"It's not that you have had a strong dollar but a weak
yen," he says. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar is
not significantly higher, he asserts.</p>

<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>Stocks closed lower and ended the first quarter with the
lightest weekly volume in three months. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average fell 20.49 to 2707.21.</p>
<p>End-of-quarter buying from institutions seeking to round
out portfolios before reporting to clients wasn't sufficient
to offset the influence of a weak bond market and rounds of
futures-related sell programs. Broader market measures, which
lagged the Dow industrials through the quarter, didn't move
down as sharply Friday.</p>
<p>For the first quarter, the Dow industrials posted a loss
of 45.99 points, or 1.7%, but managed a gain of 2.93 points,
or 0.1%, for the week. The S&P 500 fell 3.8% during the
quarter, the New York Stock Exchange Composite lost 4.2% and
the Dow Jones Equity Market Index slid 4%.</p>
<p>Motorola retreated 2 1/2 to 65 as 1.4 million shares
changed hands. The company was ordered to halt sales of one
of its biggest-selling chips as part of a judge's ruling in
its dispute with Hitachi over patent rights, which ended in a
draw. Hitachi lost 3 3/4 to 98 3/4; stocks of other Japanese
companies traded in the U.S. also fell in the wake of a
selloff on the Tokyo stock market.</p>
<p>L.A. Gear rallied 1 3/8 to 38 7/8 on 1.6 million shares
after posting earnings for the fiscal quarter ended in
February that exceeded analysts' estimates. Net income surged
to 69 cents a share from 31 cents a year earlier.</p>
<p>On the takeover front, Unocal rose 5/8 to 31 7/8 as 1.6
million shares changed hands amid renewed speculation about a
possible offer from British Petroleum. BP and Unocal both
declined to comment on the rumor.</p>
<p>Eljer Industries advanced 1 3/4 to 19 3/4 on a report by
Cable News Network that someone has been accumulating the
company's stock and may hold more than 5% of its shares as a
prelude to a possible takeover bid.</p>
<p>CBS gained 2 1/8 to 176 7/8. USA Today reported that Walt
Disney might be pursuing a secret plan to acquire the
company, as has been rumored for several months.</p>
<p>General Development, which said earlier this week that
several groups have expressed an interest in buying all or
part of the company or making a major investment, added 1 1/8
to 5 7/8.</p>
<p>But Amax, the Big Board's most active issue for the second
session in a row, fell 1 1/8 to 27 3/4 on 2.4 million shares
as speculation about a potential offer eased. Another target
of takeover rumors, Armstrong World Industries, lost 1 1/8 to
33 1/8.</p>
<p>Lockheed dropped 5/8 to 36 after claiming victory in its
proxy fight with Dallas investor Harold C. Simmons. The
company granted last-minute concessions in an effort to
attract the vote of major shareholders.</p>
<p>More than 1.3 million shares of Irish Investment Fund, the
newest entry on a growing list of closed-end, single-country
mutual funds, changed hands on its first day of trading. The
stock closed at 12, unchanged from the price of its initial
offering of five million shares.</p>
<p>Baroid added 3/8 to 10 3/8 on 1.4 million shares. An
offering of 11 million shares was sold at $10 each.</p>
<p>Banc One gained 7/8 to 28 3/8. The company agreed to buy
credit-card receivables from the credit union of the American
Association of Retired Persons and to provide a Visa
credit-card program to the association's 30 million members
for 10 years.</p>
