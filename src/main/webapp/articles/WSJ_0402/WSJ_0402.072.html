	<p class="article-leader">Anyone who thinks that a court decision is the final word
in American justice should check with one of the nation's
largest legal-information networks.
   Last year, Mead Data Central's legal-research service,
named Lexis, sued Toyota Motor Corp. for coming a little too
close with the Lexus name that the Japanese auto maker chose
for its new brand of luxury cars. The case went all the way
to a federal court of appeals before Toyota won the right to
use the Lexus name.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Problem is, Toyota didn't win the war. The Mead Corp. unit
is coming back with a contest for its 400,000 regular
customers. The contest's name: "Win an Infiniti from Lexis."
Infiniti, of course, is the new luxury car line just
introduced by Toyota's archrival, Nissan Motor Co.</p>
<p>The sweepstakes contest will run from this month until
June. The lucky person who logs on a Lexis computer-research
terminal at just the right moment will win a shiny new
$38,000 Infiniti Q45 sedan. The winner also gets a Lexis
workstation for the office and can designate a professional
school, most likely a college of law, to receive another
Lexis system.</p>
<p>It's the first time that Mead Data Central, which is based
in Dayton, Ohio, has run such a contest. To make sure enough
people know about it, the company is running advertisements
coast to coast in major legal publications such as the
National Law Journal, the ABA Journal, Texas Lawyer and
California Lawyer. The ads feature a picture of the Infiniti.
That's something that Infiniti itself didn't do in its own
ads until recently.</p>
<p>Is Lexis trying to get revenge on Lexus? No way, contends
spokesman Michael A. Winter. "This isn't an overt attempt to
take a shot at the Lexus cars."</p>
<p>So why give away an Infiniti car instead of a BMW or
Cadillac -- or even a Lexus? "We thought the Infiniti was one
of the most talked about cars in the market right now, and we
wanted to offer a car that is uppermost in people's minds,"
Mr. Winter says. "Besides, we think the cars have a lot of
intrigue." He acknowledges Lexis doesn't exactly have warm
feelings toward Lexus. "We had our day in court and we have
to abide by that decision. That doesn't mean we're happy
about it."</p>
<p>Toyota isn't taking the bait. Last year it vigorously
defended the Lexus name in court, but now mum's the word.
Says spokesman Arthur Garner: "We really don't have anything
to say on this."</p>
