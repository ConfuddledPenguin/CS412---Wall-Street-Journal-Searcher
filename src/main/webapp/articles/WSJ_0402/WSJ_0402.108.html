	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Federal health officials need to plug holes
more aggressively in the Medicare program or risk losing
several billion dollars through unnecessary payments on
medical claims, a new report concludes.
   The Medicare program for the elderly has been losing as
much as $1 billion a year because it paid claims for which
private health plans were liable, according to the report
issued by Richard P. Kusserow, inspector general for the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>HHS's Health Care Financing Administration had proposed
new legislation that would have provided data it needed to
identify and stop the unnecessary payments, but the Office of
Management and Budget objected, and HHS consequently backed
off. That decision, said Mr. Kusserow, could cost the
Medicare program $2.7 billion in unnecessary payments over
the next five years. The dollar figure "is too large to
ignore," he said. While HCFA has taken some administrative
steps to identify the overpayments, he added, "none has
proven completely effective."</p>
<p>HHS has known of these unnecessary payments for years, but
until recently did little to stop them, investigators found.
Nine insurance companies, including some of the nation's
largest, are now being investigated by federal authorities
for failing to pay claims.</p>
<p>Mr. Kusserow, in a separate report, asked the HCFA to
pressure private health plans into reimbursing Medicare for
billions of dollars that should have been paid previously.
Under the inspector general's plan, insurers would have one
year to voluntarily make restitution, or be subject to treble
damages, plus costs, for each claim uncovered by the
government.</p>
<p>The federal financing agency called Mr. Kusserow's
suggestion appealing, but thus far has failed to back it
fully. "We believe that the magnitude of the program losses .
. . compels us to take creative approaches, such as the
voluntary disclosure proposal," Mr. Kusserow said.</p>
<p>Gail R. Wilensky, recently appointed director of HCFA,
said she wants to study the issues before deciding what to
do.</p>
<p>In 1982, Congress tried to contain rising Medicare costs
by making Medicare a "secondary insurer" for the so-called
working aged. That made the employer-sponsored health plan
the "primary insurer" for any claimant whose employer
provided medical benefits.</p>
<p>Federal health officials, however, made little effort to
identify those individuals who should have had their claims
paid by private health plans. One reason was because the
government turned over administration of the program to some
of the very insurance companies that stood to benefit from
erroneous payments. Some insurance companies looked the other
way when they discovered Medicare overpayments that benefited
their own companies, according to government investigators.</p>
