	<p class="article-leader">Walt Disney Co. said it would open its first "Mickey's
Kitchen" restaurant adjacent to a Disney retail store later
this month.
   A Disney spokesman confirmed a United Press International
report that the restaurant was under construction in
Montclair, Calif., saying it was a "prototype" and that no
others were being built. "We'll study it," he said, before
rolling out more.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Disney, based in Burbank, Calif., has been operating
restaurants in its theme parks and hotels for years, but this
would be the first tied to its fast-expanding retail-store
business. The company has about 45 stores open nationwide
selling Disney paraphernalia. Currently, it is opening about
three a month, with a goal of more than 100 by 1992.</p>
