	<p class="article-leader">New York -- At the beginning of "Lettice and Lovage," the
comedy that opened recently at the Ethel Barrymore Theater,
Maggie Smith takes the stage with a flair and an authority
that few actresses of our time can match. Repeating the role
of Lettice Douffet, which she created in London, Ms. Smith is
a comedienne at the top of her form.
   When "Lettice and Lovage" opens we are in the Grand Hall
of Fustian House, a stately English home in Wiltshire
operated by the Preservation Trust. The guide who meets the
eager tourists as they arrive is Lettice Douffet; the only
problem, as Lettice is well aware, is that Fustian House is
the dullest house in England, with a 400-year history during
which absolutely nothing has happened. Initially Lettice
gives the unvarnished history of the staircase in the Grand
Hall, but it is rather tedious. And so the next time around
she begins to embellish. Queen Elizabeth I, when visiting the
house, had made an entrance at the top of the stairs and
slipped, but was saved by the owner, John Fustian.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>With each successive lecture, the story gets wilder and
wilder. Eventually Queen Elizabeth trips because her train is
encrusted with hundreds of pearls, and John Fustian, in a
single bound from the foot of the stairs, catches her in his
arms. As a reward, she knights him on the spot; not only
that, she tears five pearls from her train to be embedded in
the handle of the sword she presents to him. Ms. Smith, an
exceptionally talented performer, also can be an
exasperatingly flamboyant one. Here, however, her impeccable
comic timing, her varied vocal deliveries -- from mock
surprise, to deep-throated declarations, to nasal ennui --
and her sweeping hand gestures are perfect for the character.</p>
<p>At the end of one of Lettice's more extravagant lectures
on Fustian House, a singularly plain woman steps forth to
question the veracity of the narrative. This turns out to be
Lotte Schoen, a supervisor with the Preservation Trust who
has had numerous complaints about the excesses of Lettice's
performance. Practical, literal-minded Lotte is the ideal
foil for Lettice, especially as performed by Margaret Tyzack.
One of Britain's most accomplished actresses, with a range
that extends from inspired classical interpretations with the
National Theater and the Royal Shakespeare Company to
memorable film and television roles, Ms. Tyzack proves her
mettle as a comic performer here.</p>
<p>Scene two of "Lettice and Lovage" takes place in Lotte's
London office, where Lettice has been called to show cause
why she should not be fired. Rather than apologizing for her
actions, Lettice defends them. Appearing in an Elizabethan
long cloak and wearing a hat with a flowing plume, she says
that she has enormous respect for history. Her mother was a
Shakespearean actress who could not find work in England and
so led a troupe of women in France, performing Shakespeare in
French, but always the history plays. Thus, Lettice has a
double heritage: history and the theater. When history turns
out not to be dramatic, however, she feels it her duty to
enliven and enhance it.</p>
<p>Lotte remains unconvinced and Lettice is fired, whereupon
Ms. Smith magisterially rises from her chair and proceeds to
reenact the role of Mary Queen of Scots facing her
executioner. Journalistic ethics prohibit revealing the exact
nature of her reenactment; suffice it to say that Ms. Smith's
final moments afford an unforgettable climax to the act.</p>
<p>"Lettice and Lovage" is by playwright Peter Shaffer, whose
recent plays, "Equus" and "Amadeus," have been serious, but
who returns here to the farce form he employed earlier in his
career. As with his serious work, the theme of "Lettice and
Lovage" is the contrast between the artistic, imaginative
free spirit, personified by Lettice, and the rational,
earthbound Type. A personality exemplified by Lotte. As
always, the latter finds the liberating qualities of the
former irresistible.</p>
<p>Having fired Lettice at the end of act one, the
guilt-ridden Lotte comes to visit her in act two at her
apartment. Lettice induces Lotte to try her Renaissance
liqueur -- a concoction that includes, along with generous
portions of alcohol, an aromatic herb called lovage. Not
surprisingly, Lotte loosens up, and under the influence of
Lettice and her lovage reveals her own long-dead aspirations.
She had once wanted to be an architect, one whose mission
included subversive acts against the monstrosities of modern
architecture she saw rising around her. When given a chance,
however, to sabotage one of these temples of mediocrity, she
had a failure of nerve and ended up in her bureaucratic job
at the Preservation Trust.</p>
<p>Mr. Shaffer, having maintained a firm grip on the comic
spirit through act one and most of act two, lets it slip away
from him rather seriously in act three, when the actions of
the two women become silly. He develops an involved,
far-fetched plot that has his heroines engaged in mock
historical executions, one of which lands Lettice in court
with Lotte scheduled to serve as a witness against her.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the comic momentum of the production carries
us through this lapse and we come away remembering the
exhilaration of the earlier scenes and the artistry of Ms.
Smith and Ms. Tyzack. Added to this are excellent supporting
performances by Bette Henritze as a mousy secretary and
Paxton Whitehead as a pompous, befuddled lawyer, all adroitly
directed by Michael Blakemore.</p>
