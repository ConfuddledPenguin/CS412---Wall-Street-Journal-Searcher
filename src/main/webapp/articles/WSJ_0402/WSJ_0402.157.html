	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Southmark Corp. said it filed a new
reorganization plan drafted with the help of the unsecured
creditors' committee, leading the committee to drop its
motion to file a competing plan.
   Arthur G. Weiss, Southland's chairman, characterized the
new plan as a "complete consensual agreement" with the
creditors' committee. He added that the development could
allow the big thrift and real-estate concern to emerge from
bankruptcy-court proceedings by July, or just a year after
the company filed for protection from its creditors under
Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"That's probably the fastest any major, complicated
bankruptcy has been ended," Mr. Weiss said.</p>
<p>However, some advisers to the committee cautioned that
such talk may be be premature. "I think it's overbroad" to
say creditors have reached a consensus, said John Flowers, an
attorney for I.C.H. Corp., Louisville, Ky., a major creditor.
Lewis Kruger, counsel to the creditors' committee, said "it
looks to me like we're on the way to a transaction," but
added: "I'm not sure {July} is a realistic timetable."</p>
<p>The new plan is similar to the first reorganization
proposal Southmark filed in January, and which creditors
initially threatened to oppose. Creditors would receive
anywhere from a few pennies to perhaps 33 cents on the dollar
for the company's more than $1.2 billion in total public
debt. And Southmark still would end up as little more than a
holding company for troubled San Jacinto Savings Association.</p>
<p>But the new plan would give creditors more cash up front,
and also would grant them the option to halt Southmark's
current agreement with federal thrift regulators to pump an
additional $100 million in cash and notes into the ailing
Houston thrift.</p>
<p>On the effective date of the new plan, Southmark would
distribute as much as $75 million to senior creditors and as
much as $1 million to holders of allowed subordinated claims.
If sufficient cash isn't available, a new board elected by
creditors could decide to abrogate the agreement to invest
more in San Jacinto, Southmark said.</p>
<p>But Southmark advisers said they didn't expect that to
happen. Although some creditors had objected earlier to
Southmark's plan to reorganize around a Texas thrift -- and
to pump in more money at that -- the alternative isn't
attractive. If creditors renege, federal thrift regulators
would be free to assert claims against Southmark on behalf of
San Jacinto estimated at $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>"I think {creditors} are coming to the same conclusion
that we had, that that's a very difficult, very expensive
piece of litigation," said Paul Wickes, a senior bankruptcy
attorney for Southmark. He added that the company is
"reasonably confident" the cash will be there for creditors.</p>
<p>Representatives of the creditors' committee couldn't be
reached immediately for comment on the plan. Southmark said
the committee agreed to withdraw its pending motion to end
the company's exclusive right to file a plan.</p>
<p>Terms of the new plan call for Southmark to issue $75
million in new secured notes to senior creditors. Those
notes, bearing annual interest of 12%, would be repaid with
proceeds from the sale of Southmark's real estate, brokerage,
health care, oil and gas and insurance assets.</p>
<p>The company also would issue $100 million in new preferred
stock, of which senior creditors would receive $88 million
and subordinated creditors $12 million. Rather than being
redeemed with the proceeds of asset sales, as contemplated in
the earlier plan, the preferred stock would pay special
dividends from the proceeds to allow for more favorable tax
treatment, the company said.</p>
<p>Southmark also slashed the stake current equity holders
would be given in the reorganized company. Under the new
plan, senior creditors would receive 64.7% of the company's
new common stock, while holders of senior subordinated debt
would receive 18.5%. Subordinated debt holders would receive
11.3%; preferred shareholders 3%; and holders of common
shares 2%. Previously, preferred and holders of common were
to have received a total of 11%.</p>
<p>Shareholders haven't approved the new plan, company
officials said.</p>
