	<p class="article-leader">The increase in savings deposit insurance to $100,000 from
$40,000 became law in 1980. Friday's Potomac Watch column
wrongly attributed the increase to the 1982 Garn-St Germain
act. Sen. Jake Garn was the ranking Republican on the Senate
Banking Committee in 1980, not its chairman.

Scandal If a Senator Did It" -- WSJ March 30, 1990)</p>
