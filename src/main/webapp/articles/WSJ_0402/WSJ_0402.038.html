	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- A former shareholder of the defunct Southwest
Savings & Loan Association of Abilene, Texas, agreed to plead
guilty to artificially inflating the thrift's net worth to
raise its lending limits.
   Raymond Foy Phillips, 54 years old, was a prime
beneficiary of the increase in Southwest's lending limits,
according to documents filed Friday in connection with his
plea agreement in Dallas federal court.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The defunct Abilene thrift, which is unrelated to
Southwest Savings Association of Dallas, had $162.5 million
in assets and negative regulatory capital of $202.7 million
in August 1988. Two months later, Southwest was sold with 10
other thrifts to the Adam Group, an owner of cable television
stations based in Bryan, Texas. The thrifts are now part of
Olney Savings Association.</p>
<p>Mr. Phillips, who acquired a significant block of
Southwest stock in 1983, used several different company names
to borrow funds from the thrift for the purchase of 292 acres
of land in Houston, according to court documents.</p>
<p>When Southwest reached its legal lending limits, based on
its net worth, Mr. Phillips agreed to purchase certain assets
of the thrift at inflated prices, allowing it to book false
profits and boost its net worth. In one instance, Southwest
lent Mr. Phillips $2.4 million to enable him to purchase its
own assets, according to court documents.</p>
<p>Mr. Phillips, who is charged with conspiring to pump up
Southwest's net worth, is the first person to face criminal
charges in connection with the thrift's failure. He is
cooperating in further investigations by U.S. Justice
Department's Dallas Bank Fraud Task Force.</p>
