	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Increased bookings for cars helped produce a
modest rebound in factory orders in February, the Commerce
Department said.
   New orders increased 1.8%, the department said, after a
revised 5.5% plunge in January. That was the largest decline
since 1974 and stemmed from a record 10.5% drop in orders for
durable goods, or products that are expected to last at least
three years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In February, durable-goods orders climbed 2.6%, compared
with the 3.3% figure the department gave in a preliminary
report.</p>
<p>Behind the growth in durable goods was principally a 10.4%
jump in transportation equipment -- mostly cars -- which came
despite a 23.1% plunge in orders for aircraft and parts.</p>
<p>The February rebound in the auto industry wasn't a
surprise, because production was low in January.</p>
<p>And analysts weren't concerned about the decline in
aircraft. Although orders and production tend to be
synonymous in the auto industry, aircraft orders don't
reflect current sales. "We know the aircraft industry is one
of the healthiest in the economy," said Gregory Fager, chief
economist at First City Bancorp. of Texas, Houston.</p>
<p>Many economists agreed that the report reflects continued
sluggishness in the manufacturing sector, however. "The rate
of decline seems to have eased, but we're not in the midst of
recovery," Mr. Fager said. He said the manufacturing sector
"is more or less holding its own."</p>
<p>Joan Schnieder, money market economist at Continental Bank
of Chicago, said the report provided confirmation of "the
sense of stagnation we've had about the manufacturing sector
over the past year."</p>
<p>Orders for nondurable goods rose 0.9% in February after
rising a revised 0.6% in January.</p>
<p>Manufacturers' inventories fell 0.1% in February after
rising 0.9% in January. Durable-goods inventories dropped
0.3%, while stocks of nondurable goods were up 0.2%.</p>
<p>February shipments increased 3.3% after a decline of 1.8%
in January. Shipments of durable goods jumped 5.5% after
slipping 4.3% in January. Shipments of nondurables rose 0.9%,
the same as they did in January.</p>

manufacturers in billions of dollars, seasonally adjusted.</p>
