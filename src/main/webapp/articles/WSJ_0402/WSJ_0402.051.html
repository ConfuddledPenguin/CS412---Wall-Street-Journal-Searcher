	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- A British study found a defective blood protein
that may help develop the first diagnostic test for
Alzheimer's disease, an incurable, mind-destroying ailment
common among the elderly.
   The research also signifies the first time scientists have
uncovered a possible explanation for why aluminum builds up
in brain cells of Alzheimer's patients. Aluminum long has
been suspected to play a role in the debilitating
neurological disorder, which afflicts about 2.5 million
Americans and kills 100,000 a year. In Britain, about 750,000
people suffer from the disease.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At present, doctors lack a clear-cut way to diagnose the
illness in a patient, except by eliminating other possible
causes for mental deterioration.</p>
<p>The small-scale study suggests aluminum may accumulate in
brains of Alzheimer's patients because they have defective
transferrin, a blood protein to which aluminium normally
binds in the blood stream.</p>
<p>"People without this defect would be protected from the
neurotoxic effects of aluminum," concludes the report in this
week's issue of Lancet, a U.K. medical journal. "The presence
of the defect could be used as a diagnostic test for
Alzheimer's disease," adds the report, written by nine
British and French researchers.</p>
<p>Paul Altmann, a nephrologist at London Hospital and one of
the study's authors, said the research "is quite an important
step forward" in understanding Alzheimer's disease. If
scientists can use the research to craft a simple diagnostic
blood test, he added, "it opens the door to developing the
therapeutic maneuvers in the future. But these are things
that will take some time to develop."</p>
<p>Other Alzheimer's experts were even more cautious. The
finding "sounds promising. But a great deal more work has to
be done to test this hypothesis," said Nora Graham, chairman
of Britain's Alzheimer's Disease Society and a London
neuro-geriatrician.</p>
<p>John Candy, a neuro-scientist at England's Newcastle
General Hospital, criticized the research's methodology as
flawed. "I remain skeptical," he said.</p>
<p>In the Lancet study, the scientists analyzed blood samples
from 62 individuals divided into five groups: a control
group, plus patients undergoing kidney dialysis and patients
with Alzheimer's, stroke-related dementia or a form of mental
retardation called Down's syndrome. The investigators used
gallium, a metal similar to aluminum, to measure whether
aluminum's binding to transferrin was impaired.</p>
<p>Significant impairment showed up in both Alzheimer's and
Down's syndrome patients. For these patients, "the amount of
binding to transferrin is less than half the normal amount,"
said Dr. Altmann. Transferrin "doesn't detoxify the metal"
and so more aluminum apparently slips into the patients'
brain cells. "This whole story strengthens the evidence for
aluminum playing a role" in Alzheimer's disease, he added.</p>
<p>Previous research has found aluminum deposits in brain
cells damaged by Alzheimer's disease and Down's syndrome.
Down's syndrome patients also tend to develop Alzheimer's
later in life. In January 1989, a British government study
concluded that adults who consume water with high
concentrations of aluminum run a 50% greater risk of
developing Alzheimer's disease than people whose water
contains virtually no aluminum.</p>
