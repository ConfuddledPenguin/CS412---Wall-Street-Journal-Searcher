	<h3>Economy -- Tracking the Economy: Vigorous Data May Reflect Detour's End And Not a New Trend, Economists Warn</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- As one quarter slides seamlessly into the
next, economists offer this advice: Don't confuse recovery
with vigor.
   The March purchasing managers' index, to be released this
morning, is believed to have gained ground -- particularly
after a strong regional report last Friday from Chicago-area
purchasers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But economists caution that a better tone to the index --
as in some other indicators lately -- may simply reflect the
end of a short detour, rather than the start of a new
economic trend. Similarly, analysts plan to take with a grain
of salt Friday's important employment report for March,
because of some odd factors that help boost job totals. The
week's other offerings include March auto sales and February
data on consumer credit, the index of leading indicators and
construction spending.</p>
<p>An improved purchasers' index "is more auto-related than
anything else," Donald Fine, chief economist at Chase
Manhattan Bank, New York, said. "The auto industry virtually
shut down in January. In combination, February and March
brought back production levels to near where they were in the
fourth quarter."</p>
<p>Michael P. Niemira, economist at Mitsubishi Bank, New
York, said the rebound in Chicago purchasers' data reaffirm
his view that a "mini-inventory correction" that began at the
end of last year may have run its course. Last Friday, the
Purchasing Management Association of Chicago reported its
index of area business activity rose to 55.1% on an
unadjusted basis in March from 51% in February.</p>
<p>The broader report, which is to be released today by the
National Association of Purchasing Management, is expected to
inch ahead to 48.5% from 48.3% in February, according to a
survey by MMS International, a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc. The
purchasing data have become increasingly important to
economists and traders who are eager for data on economic
activity and the possible direction of interest rates. In
addition, the report usually provides the month's -- and the
new quarter's -- first reading on the nation's manufacturing
pulse.</p>
<p>A reading above 50% indicates an expanding economy, while
a reading below 50% suggests contraction. The National
Association of Purchasing Management index has been under 50%
since May 1989.</p>
<p>The MMS survey on the national purchasers' index,
conducted after Chicago's data were reported, showed a
strengthening of 1.2 percentage points from a week earlier,
when the median expectation was for a 47.3% reading on the
national gauge.</p>
<p>Mitsubishi Bank's Mr. Niemira said he too raised his
estimate of the association's index to 49% from 48.5% after
the Chicago report came out. Still, he said: "The Chicago
report should be kept in perspective. It's right where it was
in the fourth quarter. Things aren't exactly booming."</p>
<p>Samuel Kahan, chief economist at Fuji Securities Inc. in
Chicago, agreed that his city is "still enjoying a rebound"
that probably plumped the local purchasers' report. But he
also noted that numbers without context can be misleading.
Pointing to the recent hearty employment data, he said:
"People are taking the employment numbers at face value and
extrapolating them to what the economy is doing. The truth
is, I'm not sure you can hypothesize."</p>
<p>The unemployment rate for March is expected to remain
unchanged at 5.3%. And new job growth, while a bit less
significant than that in January and February, is likely to
be fairly strong, with 175,000 nonfarm jobs created,
according to MMS. But economists noted that early-year data
were influenced by an unusual increase in construction jobs
owing to mild weather. Recent jobs data have been affected by
the ebb and flow of auto jobs. In addition, this week's
report is likely to reflect the first major addition of
specially hired census workers.</p>
<p>All in all, Mr. Kahan said, "It looks to me like the
economy isn't gathering steam, but that we are continuing to
flounder at this level."</p>
<p>While the unemployment rate is expected to be unchanged,
estimates on new-job creation range broadly, from 100,000 to
303,000, according to MMS. In February, 275,000 new jobs were
generated. In addition to job totals, economists are keeping
a close eye on wage levels and their possible effect on
inflation. Hourly earnings in March are believed to have
increased about 0.2%.</p>
<p>February construction outlays, in a report to be released
today, are expected to have risen about 0.5%, following a
1.8% increase in January, when the weather was unseasonably
warm.</p>
<p>Economists don't expect much forecasting help from
tomorrow's leading indicators index. The February index is
believed to have dropped a sharp 0.7%, largely because of a
steep drop in the number of housing permits issued. Housing
permits skyrocketed in the previous month, as developers
rushed to escape new handicapped-access rules.</p>
<p>Consumer credit, another indicator tied firmly to auto
sales, is expected to have fallen in February. The credit
tally, to be issued Friday, is expected to have slowed to
about $3 billion, following January's $3.5 billion gain.</p>
