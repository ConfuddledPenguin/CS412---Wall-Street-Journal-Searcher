	<p class="article-leader">HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Chrysler Corp. said it is
temporarily halting production at four production facilities
this week because of sluggish sales.
   The No. 3 auto maker is idling assembly plants in
Belvidere, Ill., Newark, Del., Toledo, Ohio, and Sterling
Heights, Mich. The facilities are scheduled to resume
production April 9. A total of about 12,700 workers will be
affected.</p>
