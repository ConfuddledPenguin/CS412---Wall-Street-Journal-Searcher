	<p class="article-leader">Rubbermaid Inc. will post first-quarter net income of
about $33 million, or 45 cents a share, up 13% from $29.3
million, or 40 cents a share, a year earlier, Stanley C.
Gault, chairman and chief executive officer, said.
   The expected earnings increase reflects higher sales of
Rubbermaid's housewares and lower raw-materials costs, the
executive said in an interview.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Gault said revenue in the quarter rose slightly from
$349 million in the 1989 first quarter. The revenue gains
would have been stronger, officials said, had Rubbermaid not
held back on its retail inventory-building due to concerns
about the economy. "We want merchandise to move through the
stores, not just get the numbers up," Mr. Gault said.</p>
<p>In its core housewares division, orders from retailers
were "on the light side" during the early weeks of the
quarter but have improved, said Walter W. Williams, president
and chief operating officer.</p>
<p>Despite some worries about the economy, Rubbermaid
continues its fast-paced rate of new product rollouts. The
company unveiled 187 new housewares and specialty products in
January, including a 50-item line of brooms and brushes.</p>
<p>Rubbermaid is optimistic of fast growth in that category,
despite the mature state of the market. The reason: larger
retailers could choose to stock the Rubbermaid line instead
of buying a variety of products from numerous suppliers.</p>
<p>Besides, Rubbermaid hopes to create more demand by
boosting its advertising and promotion spending on that
product line and others. "We want to further enhance our
image with the consumer," Mr. Gault said. Last year's
advertising and promotion budget was about 3.6% of sales, or
about $45 million.</p>
<p>For 1990, that will increase slightly, although the
company officials didn't offer details. One factor is how
much Rubbermaid saves on its raw-material costs. The company
expects polyethylene prices to drop during the year as
suppliers add capacity to plastic plants.</p>
<p>Rubbermaid's Little Tikes toy division is expected to post
sales gains of between 10% and 12% over the year-ago quarter,
Mr. Williams said. The division's new management is
considering how to expand that business.</p>
<p>The company's commercial products business should show
"average growth" in the quarter after lagging behind in 1989,
Mr. Williams said. One factor is the cautious spending among
food-service companies and others.</p>
<p>For all of 1990, Rubbermaid agrees with analysts' earnings
estimates of between $1.80 and $1.85 a share, Mr. Gault said,
with revenue for the year topping last year's $1.34 billion.
However, the revenue figure won't include about $70 million
in sales from the housewares business in Europe. Those sales
are now part of a joint venture that isn't consolidated in
Rubbermaid's income statement.</p>
<p>Capital spending is expected to climb 17% to about $100
million in 1990. The increase will cover new product
introductions, equipment replacements and other improvements,
Mr. Williams said.</p>
<p>During the year, Rubbermaid will focus on management
succession in anticipation of Mr. Gault's retirement in May
1991. Mr. Williams is expected to become chief executive. "I
won't be running the company, but I'll be around to talk
about things," said Mr. Gault, who will remain a board
member.</p>
