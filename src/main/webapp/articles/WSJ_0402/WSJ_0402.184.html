	<p class="article-leader">Major steelmakers stumbled in the first quarter as
continued price erosion nibbled away at their profits.
   Some producers may have even been unprofitable, analysts
warn. John Jacobson, who monitors steel for AUS Consultants,
believes the industry, including many mills, will actually
lose about $400 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts said profits for each ton of steel shipped will
range from $15 to $25 in the first quarter. That result
compares with $26 in the fourth quarter of 1989 and $39 a ton
in last year's robust first quarter.</p>
<p>Among major steelmakers, USX Corp. appears to have fared
the best in the latest period, partly reflecting the
company's labor cost advantages. Analysts predict that the
Pittsburgh steel and energy concern should earn between 55
and 60 cents a share compared with a $1.09 a year ago.</p>
<p>Most major steelmakers, except for USX, had higher
first-quarter labor costs stemming from new labor pacts
negotiated last year. Bethlehem Steel Corp., the first major
steelmaker to sign a contract last year, is expected to earn
about 15 cents a share in the latest quarter compared with 78
cents last year.</p>
<p>The automotive sector, which consumes about 23% of U.S.
mills' output, was weak through much of the quarter, picking
up toward the end. As a result, steelmakers, such as National
Steel Corp., that are largely dependent on auto-related
customers are expected to fare badly. Analysts expect
National Steel, a Pittsburgh joint venture owned by National
Intergroup Inc. and NKK Corp. of Japan, to earn about $12 a
ton.</p>
<p>The outlook for the rest of the year is mixed. Mr.
Jacobson said he initially thought the steel industry would
suffer at least two quarterly losses in 1990. But now he
expects a quicker upturn as prices begin to climb. "I think
we're pretty much out of the woods," he said.</p>
<p>Other analysts, though, expect the lackluster first
quarter to persist through 1990. "Look for anemic profits in
1990" said Peter Marcus, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. He
cited flat shipments, higher labor costs and continuing price
weakness as reasons for the slump.</p>
<p>Some analysts, such as John Tumazos of Donaldson, Lufkin &
Jenrette, believe softness in automotive and construction
markets will extend to the previously strong capital goods
market. "Historically, after the consumer segment is weak for
two to four quarters, the capital goods market begins to
ease," he said.</p>
<p>Steelmakers suffered from lower prices in the first
quarter, a trend that began in the second half of 1989. Mr.
Tumazos said average first-quarter prices fell to $491 a ton
from $503 a ton in the fourth quarter. "I don't think the
public will be aware of how deep the discounts were until
they see the first-quarter results," he said.</p>
<p>Price declines have been most severe for commodity-type
products such as hot rolled sheet. Mr. Marcus noted that the
base spot price for that product fell to about $310 a ton
from $325 in the fourth quarter and $400 a ton last spring.
Moreover, world spot prices for even high quality products
like cold rolled sheet recently fell an additional $40 a ton,
partly as a result of overproduction, Mr. Marcus said.</p>
<p>Those steelmakers with more long-term contracts and less
exposure to the spot market, such as Armco Inc., Parsippany,
N.J., and Chicago-based Inland Steel Industries Inc., are
less vulnerable to spot price discounting.</p>
<p>Also hurting first-quarter results, noted analyst
Christopher Plummer of WEFA Group, were lower operating
rates. Those rates were about 82% in the first quarter
compared with the year-earlier quarter's 90%. As a result,
fixed interest and labor costs were spread over fewer tons of
steel shipped. "It's enough of a drop to have a significant
impact on earnings," he said.</p>
<p>Still, shipments held up relatively well in the quarter
despite the lackluster economy. One reason was the low level
of imports. First-quarter shipments should total about 20
million tons, slightly higher than the fourth quarter but
lower than the 1989 first quarter's 21.9 million tons. The
strength in shipments is expected to continue in the second
quarter as buyers rebuild inventories, a move that should
also relieve some pressure on pricing.</p>
