	<p class="article-leader">Price discounting spread in the North American forest
products industry in the first quarter, and some analysts
warn that investors are in for nasty earnings surprises over
the next few weeks.
   "I think first-quarter earnings will be very, very
disappointing," said Salomon Brothers analyst Sherman Chao.
"The year-over-year declines are going to be fairly
alarming," he said, adding that he wouldn't be surprised by
drops of 40% to 50% in some cases.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In Canada, the world's largest exporter of pulp and paper,
the outlook isn't any brighter. "There will be more earnings
disappointments than the Street expects," said Brian F. Topp,
an analyst with Capital Group Securities in Toronto. "I think
things will get progressively worse this year," Mr. Topp
said. He said he expects Canadian producers as a group to
report lower earnings in all four quarters of 1990, compared
with year-earlier levels, and expects earnings for the year
to be down 50%.</p>
<p>The biggest change for North American producers in the
first quarter was the spreading of price discounting to the
premium grade of market pulp, known as Northern bleached
softwood kraft pulp. For the first time in three years,
discounts from list prices were readily available, analysts
and industry sources said.</p>
<p>Prices began slipping in January as producers' shipments
dropped to a five-year low and inventories shot up. Although
the current discounts of $15-$30 a metric ton from the list
price of $830 a metric ton aren't yet painful, they are
believed to presage much bigger discounts. A metric ton is
2,204.6 pounds. Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open
market to makers of paper and sanitary and other products.</p>
<p>Prices for lower-quality grades of market pulp began
sliding last year, and discounting accelerated in the first
quarter. Prices for the lower grades took "a very significant
drop" of about $50 a metric ton in the first quarter, one
producer said, and are now about $100 a metric ton, or 12% to
14%, below list prices.</p>
<p>Analysts expect pulp prices to fall further this year and
again next year because several producers will be starting
new mills. Mr. Topp said that in a worst-case scenario the
price of Northern bleached softwood pulp could bottom out at
about $550 a metric ton, or more than 30% below current
levels, by the end of this year or the beginning of 1991.</p>
<p>Analysts said Weyerhaeuser Co., Federal Paper Board Co.,
Georgia-Pacific Corp. and International Paper Co. are among
the U.S. producers with a major exposure to market pulp and
are expected to report lower earnings. Major Canadian
producers of market pulp include Noranda Forest Inc., Repap
Enterprises Inc., Canfor Corp., Canadian Pacific Forest
Products Ltd. and Fletcher Challenge Canada Ltd., a
subsidiary of Fletcher Challenge Ltd. of New Zealand.</p>
<p>Newsprint makers were hit early and hard by price
discounting, and after a two-year slide, producers are trying
to nudge prices back up. Led by Abitibi-Price Inc., most
major newsprint producers announced they will raise the U.S.
East Coast list price by $35 a metric ton to $685 a metric
ton, effective June 1. The pricing structure is slightly
different in the West, where newsprint makers are seeking a
comparable increase.</p>
<p>But producers don't expect customers to actually pay $685
a metric ton for newsprint. Instead they are trying to lift
the discounted or transaction price from about $525 to $540 a
metric ton to around $560 to $575.</p>
<p>Newspaper publishers are somewhat sympathetic to the
newsprint makers' pleas for relief -- Abitibi said in
announcing the price increase that it runs a loss on every
ton of newsprint it sells.</p>
<p>But with newsprint in abundant supply, publishers and many
analysts doubt the increase will stick. "If the suppliers
stick together," said James Correu, director of operations at
the Dallas Morning News, the list price increase might go
through. But, he said, "we've already had overtures from some
suppliers about special discounting" that would leave
transaction prices unchanged.</p>
<p>The one wild card for newsprint and pulp suppliers and
buyers is the prospect of a strike in Eastern Canada.
Contracts at most mills in the region expire April 30, and
the Canadian Paperworkers Union is seeking substantial wage
gains. "If a prolonged strike takes hold, then transaction
prices will increase," Mr. Topp of Capital Group said.</p>
<p>Markets for other major forest commodities also softened
in the first quarter, but prices for a few products remained
firm.</p>
<p>In packaging grades, bleached board prices showed
strength, analysts said. Transaction prices for linerboard
dropped to $380 a short ton from a list price of $410 a short
ton, but "nobody seems to be expecting that prices are going
to continue slipping from there," one analyst said.</p>
<p>Prices for photocopy paper, business forms and other
uncoated white papers are about 10% to 15% below list prices,
but a 5% price increase that went into effect at the start of
this month is expected to halt the discounting.</p>
<p>In coated papers, prices for the fanciest grades are
holding up well. List prices for coated magazine paper are
being discounted about 5%, analysts said, with little
prospect of a price increase.</p>
<p>One bright spot is building products. The lumber market is
"pretty healthy," a Weyerhaeuser spokesman said. Weyerhaeuser
is also a major producer of other products such as pulp and
has interests in financial services and real estate.</p>
<p>"Overall, the year will be down somewhat from 1989," the
spokesman said, but first-quarter earnings will "probably be
pretty close" to analysts' estimates of 50 to 55 cents a
share, compared with 70 cents a share a year earlier.</p>
<p>That decline is in line with the 19% year-on-year drop in
first-quarter earnings that Shearson Lehman Hutton analyst
Mark Diverio expects forest product companies to report as a
group. Mr. Diverio said he expects the industry to continue
reporting quarterly earnings declines through mid-1991 as
capacity increases outrun demand for several forest
commodities. Mr. Chao at Salomon Brothers expects just four
U.S. forest products concerns to report earnings gains for
the first quarter: Temple-Inland Inc., Willamette Industries
Inc., Potlatch Corp. and Kimberly-Clark Corp.</p>
<p>J.A. Parsons, chief financial officer at Willamette, said,
"I think certainly the building products side will be up. The
question mark is the paper side." He declined to make an
earnings forecast.</p>
<p>Analysts expect almost every Canadian forest products
concern to report a drop in first-quarter profit, and some
expect one or two Canadian companies to report losses.
Several Canadian companies, including Abitibi-Price, Canadian
Pacific Forest Products, Domtar Inc. and Donohue Inc., have
already warned shareholders that 1990 will be a difficult
year. "We're living in difficult times," said Alain Lemaire
at Quebec-based Cascades Inc.</p>
