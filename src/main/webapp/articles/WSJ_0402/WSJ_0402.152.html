	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Corporate treasurers' skittishness over
interest rates -- and fallout from the collapse of Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., the big junk-bond underwriter --
combined to batter the market for corporate debt offerings
during the first quarter.
   Corporations issued just $25.6 billion worth of new bonds
in the period. That's 33% less than a year ago and the lowest
level in more than four years, Securities Data Co. says.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The bankruptcy-law filing by Drexel's parent company,
Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc., dragged down an already
reeling junk-bond market. Just three new issues of these
high-risk, high-yield bonds were launched in the quarter,
raising $10.8 million. That was down sharply from 26 issues
totaling $151 million a year earlier. Junk-bond traders and
analysts don't expect a rebound any time soon.</p>
<p>But the collapse of the $200 billion market for publicly
traded junk bonds bolstered issuers of mortgage and
asset-backed bonds. One reason: Investors nervous about
taking on risks amid the turbulence in the junk market felt
more comfortable turning to higher quality mortgage bonds
backed by the U.S. government, analysts say.</p>
<p>The volume of mortgage and asset-backed bonds surged 46.6%
from a year earlier, raising $43.3 billion for the quarter --
the first time this debt tallied more than half of the total
new-issue volume. For Merrill Lynch & Co. and Goldman, Sachs
& Co., mortgage and asset-backed securities accounted for
about 40% of their total underwriting volume.</p>
<p>Issuers keen on getting assets such as credit-card loans
off their books found a ready market. The volume of
asset-backed bonds surged 77% to $9.4 billion, Securities
Data says. Merrill Lynch emerged as the leader in
asset-backed securities for the quarter, with a market share
of 24%, managing $2.3 billion. Merrill's strength stemmed
from its ability to underwrite securities using revolving
credit lines as collateral.</p>
<p>Among mortgage-backed managers, Bear Stearns Cos. stood
out, raising $5.5 billion; Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
managed $3.9 billion.</p>
<p>But here's the hitch: Much mortgage and asset-backed debt
typically doesn't generate fat fees. While the deals foster
relationships, securities firms "aren't making a penny on
it," says Securities Data's Francine Wissak.</p>
<p>There, in a nutshell, is Wall Street's big problem: Few
tidal waves of cash these days. After the 1987 stock-market
crash, at least merger activity and junk bonds thrived,
picking up the slack from retreating individual investors.
But not much, it seems, is booming now.</p>
<p>"The big-ticket items have slowed to a standstill," says
Perrin Long Jr., senior analyst at Lipper Analytical
Securities Corp. "The only thing putting any money into
(securities firms') pockets are the day-to-day commodity type
businesses," he says. And they don't make much cash.</p>
<p>New-issue volume in the municipal, or tax-exempt, bond
market edged up 3% from the year-earlier quarter to $23.4
billion. Merrill Lynch, with a 12% market share, led Goldman
Sachs and Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. in the municipals
marathon. Securities Data's volume and firm rankings are
based on the principal amount of municipal securities with
final stated maturities of 13 months and longer; private
placements and remarketed issues are excluded.</p>
<p>Here are how last year's new issues stacked up: Mortgage
debt accounted for 43.2%; investment-grade corporate debt,
32.4%; asset-backed debt, 12.5%; initial public offerings,
5.5%; secondary common stock, 3.6%; preferred stock, 1.5%;
junk bonds, 0.5%; taxable municipal bonds, 0.4%; and
convertible bonds, 0.3%.</p>
