of its Sifto Salt division to North American Salt Co.,
Mission, Kan. Terms weren't disclosed.
   The sale largely completes the disposal of Domtar's
chemical and energy interests, which the Montreal forest and
building-products concern began last year. A small specialty
chemicals concern, Clough Chemicals Inc., remains to be sold.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Domtar said the salt assets sold include a rock salt mine
in Goderich, Ontario, evaporated salt plants in Goderich,
Amherst, Nova Scotia and Unity, Saskatchewan, Nickell Salt
Co. in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, and related distribution
facilities.</p>
