	<p class="article-leader">Howard Savings Bank, Livingston, N.J., said it plans to
add about $30 million to its loan-loss reserves for the first
quarter, causing a loss of about $17 million, or $1.16 a
share. In the 1989 first quarter, Howard earned $8.5 million,
or 59 cents a share.
   Howard also said its board suspended payment of the
quarterly dividend.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Leo J. Rogers Jr., president, said the additional reserves
became necessary "because of both the continuing weakness in
the region's real estate markets and a further deterioration
in loans previously identified by the bank as problem loans."</p>
<p>After the addition to reserves, the bank's allowance for
loan losses will be about $112 million, compared with $84.9
million at the end of 1989. The bank anticipates that its
nonperforming loans will increase to about $410 million at
the end of the first quarter from $314.8 million at year end.
Howard said it remains in compliance with all applicable
capital standards.</p>
<p>In national over-the-counter trading Friday, Howard shares
closed at $5.125, down 12.5 cents.</p>
