	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Bridgestone Corp. and Sumitomo Rubber Industries
Ltd., two of Japan's major makers of tire and other rubber
products, reported strong gains in consolidated pretax
earnings for 1989.
   Bridgestone, the No. 1 tire producer, said its pretax
profit climbed 15% to 110.33 billion yen ($705.5 million)
from 95.56 billion yen in 1988. But net income plunged 76% to
9.644 billion yen, or 12.60 yen a share, from 39.96 billion
yen, or 55.73 yen a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A company official attributed the sharp fall to foreign
exchange losses amounting to 20.67 billion yen. While pretax
profits are measured at an exchange rate prevailing when each
overseas sale is made, the official explained, net is gauged
with the same currency rate at year end, thus often leading
to a sharp difference in pretax and after-tax earnings.</p>
<p>Also dragging down net were large losses stemming from
rising corporate and resident taxes, and a sluggish
performance by Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., a U.S. subsidiary
that the official said was saddled with heavy interest
burdens and increasing equipment investment.</p>
<p>In the U.S., Bridgestone's sales fell conspicuously in the
fourth quarter, as the U.S. economy slowed down, the official
said. Unstable economic conditions in Latin America and
fierce sales competition in Europe hurt
Bridgestone/Firestone's international tire operations.</p>
<p>But Bridgestone's overseas sales, accounting for 59% of
overall sales, surged 82% to 999.9 billion yen from 549.7
billion yen in 1988. In the domestic market, sales rose 7% to
689.1 billion yen from 641.6 billion yen, owing to the robust
domestic demand-led economic expansion.</p>
<p>Sumitomo Rubber, Japan's third-largest tire maker,
reported a 15% rise in pretax profit to 12.69 billion yen
from 11.04 billion yen in 1988. Net rose 30% to 6.69 billion
yen, or 46.83 yen a share, from 5.16 billion yen, or 37.91
yen a share.</p>
<p>Sales rose 8.1% to 478.61 billion yen from 442.8 billion
yen.</p>
<p>A Sumitomo official said the favorable performance
resulted from robust domestic demand.</p>
<p>Sales of tires totaled 376.24 billion yen, up 8.2% from
347.73 billion yen. Sporting goods sales rose 3.3% to 69.75
billion yen from 67.49 billion yen.</p>
<p>Sumitomo's overseas performance, including Dunlop Tire
Corp. of the U.S., Dunlop France S.A., SP Tyres UK Ltd. and
SP Reifenwerke G.m.b.H. of West Germany, was relatively
sluggish, compared with that in Japan, where demand for new
and replacement tires was strong.</p>
