	<p class="article-leader">We recently noted that while millions of small businesses
have to endure the paper work of the revised minimum-wage
law, Rep. Frank Annunzio of Illinois, chairman of the House
Administration Committee, wants to kill an extension of the
law to cover the House's own 10,000 employees. Rep. Annunzio,
a liberal Democrat, says that, after all, the Senate exempts
itself from the law and the record-keeping would tie up the
House in knots. He told ABC News recently, "We talk about
eliminating bureaucracies. We're building another bureaucracy
that is not necessary, not needed; it's too expensive, and we
ought to say so, and we ought to cut it out." Hmmm. He better
not repeat that too often. Voters might think he is referring
to Congress itself.</p>
