	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Senate voted to eliminate a clean-air
provision that would have allowed factories whose fumes pose
cancer risks to buy out adjoining neighborhoods to create a
buffer zone.
   On a voice vote Friday, the Senate adopted an amendment by
Sen. Albert Gore (D., Tenn.) rejecting the creation of what
environmentalists had branded "dead zones" around polluting
plants. The provision had been written into a clean-air
agreement between the White House and Senate leaders to help
plants avoid mandatory shutdowns if they can't eliminate most
of the cancer risks posed by their emissions.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Environmentalists had loudly criticized the provision for
proposing to permit factories to move people out of their
homes rather than reduce toxic-air emissions to unthreatening
levels. While industry still is worried that the Senate's
toxic-air requirements could shut some plants down, industry
spokesmen said the buffer-zone provision wasn't crucial for
them.</p>
