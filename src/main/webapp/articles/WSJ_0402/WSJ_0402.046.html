	<p class="article-leader">After years of observing safe-sex practices that
dramatically reduced the spread of AIDS and other sexually
transmitted diseases, the gay community is experiencing a
relapse in its ranks, threatening recent health gains.
   Cases of venereal disease are rebounding at gay clinics in
Los Angeles, Seattle and Denver. More alarming, the rate of
new AIDS virus infections in Chicago has risen for the first
time in five years. While still below the 7.5% annual growth
rate of 1984, new infections within a study group doubled in
the year ended June 1989 to 2% from 1% a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>No one knows if the upturn will prove to be a temporary
blip or a new wave of the epidemic. Nor is it certain other
cities will follow Chicago. However, a rise in venereal
diseases like gonorrhea could presage an increase in acquired
immune deficiency syndrome infection, which takes months
longer to show up as a positive antibody test.</p>
<p>"We've been able to change sexual behavior in the past
five years and drop the rate of {AIDS} infection fivefold,"
says Lawrence Kingsley, a University of Pittsburgh scientist
who heads the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, or MACS, which
is tracking the AIDS virus in 5,000 men in Baltimore,
Chicago, Los Angeles and Pittsburgh. "But still we're left
with annual increases of 1% to 2%. This is unacceptable from
a public health point of view."</p>
<p>Given a conservative estimate of five million to 10
million gay men in the U.S., Dr. Kingsley worries that even a
1% to 2% growth rate means 50,000 to 200,000 new infections
every year. "To me," he says, "that's staggering." The
Chicago increase, detected in a group of 1,100 men, is
especially disturbing because all MACS volunteers get
intensive AIDS education, he says. He fears other men at risk
"may be experiencing a higher rate of infection than our
men."</p>
<p>George Lemp, an epidemiologist with the San Francisco
Department of Public Health, found a disturbing rate of
relapse in a telephone survey of 400 gay households there.
Almost one in five men (18%) said they had had intercourse
without a condom in the past year. Even among those men who
had made a commitment never again to engage in unprotected
sex, 16% said they had slipped in the past year, 12% of them
with casual partners.</p>
<p>Scientists and activists say they are alarmed but not
surprised by some erosion in safe sex. Activist groups in
several major cities have met quietly to discuss educational
strategies to deal with relapse. One group, the Gay Men's
Health Crisis of New York City, called relapse "a specter
haunting the gay community."</p>
<p>Many activists explain the phenomenon is similar to the
experience of people who try to quit smoking, drinking or
overeating. A slip now and then is inevitable. But "falling
off the wagon once won't kill you," says San Francisco
activist Pierre Ludington. "Falling off the safe-sex wagon
{can}."</p>
<p>Risky encounters carry an especially heavy price in the
hardest-hit cities like San Francisco, where half of the
city's estimated 60,000 gay men are believed to carry the
virus. Still, given human nature, the denial of risk dies
hard.</p>
<p>One avowed practitioner of safe sex recently acknowledged
the tragic aftermath of a single lapse in a letter to Pat
Christen, executive director of the San Francisco AIDS
Foundation. In a recent speech on the problem of relapse, Ms.
Christen read excerpts from his letter:</p>
<p>"I am one of the people you are talking about," the
unidentified man wrote. "I practiced only safe activities
since 1987. I was not infected, and made a strong
{commitment} to stay uninfected. Unfortunately, several
months ago, I slipped once. . . . I have never done it since,
and I slipped just once, but I just found out that I am now
infected with the AIDS virus." He added, "I hope you can get
to others so it's not too late for them."</p>
<p>Michael DeMayo of the Gay Men's Health Crisis of New York
City attributes such slippage to denial, low self-esteem and
alcohol or drug use. Also, he says that after years of
decline in bathhouse attendance, "there are now a couple
{underground clubs} in New York where you can go and have
unsafe sex." Other cities also report resurgence of sex
clubs, although some are said to enforce condom use.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center
reports a rise in sexually transmitted diseases among its
clinic clients. Psychologist Scott Brooks of the Edmund
Edelman Health Center clinic says: "About 30% of our people
are being diagnosed with some form of gonorrhea." Though
that's lower than rates of the early 1980's, Mr. Brooks says,
"It's most definitely higher than we'd like to see."</p>
<p>In Seattle, Hunter Handsfield, director of sexually
transmitted disease control for the Seattle-King County
Health Department, says that city's gonorrhea incidence
plunged to 33 cases in 1988 from 1,300 cases in 1982. But
there was a resurgence in 1989, when cases more than tripled
to 102.</p>
<p>"We've seen similar rises in every STD -- syphilis,
herpes, genital warts and chlamydia -- all in gay men," he
adds. "We have no other rational explanation than that
there's been a behavior change," that is, a retreat from safe
sex.</p>
<p>In Denver, which had seen an 80% drop in venereal
diseases, there's also "a small increase in gonorrhea in gay
men," says Gary Sky of the Colorado AIDS project. "Gays who
have been practicing safe sex for years are getting tired of
it."</p>
<p>To combat relapse, the Colorado project has published a
pamphlet on how to "negotiate" for safe sex. It urges people
to tell their partners: "No condom, no sex." It also reminds
those already infected that unsafe sex places both their
partner and themselves at risk because any additional assault
on a weakened immune system can accelerate the course of
AIDS.</p>
<p>Older gays, veterans of the epidemic, are "war weary,"
explains epidemiologist Ron Stall of the University of
California, San Francisco. Having succeeded in a massive
behavior modification, some gay men found it as hard to
maintain as any health regimen. Men in committed
relationships sometimes abandon safeguards in the interests
of intimacy, he adds.</p>
<p>On the other hand, younger gay men in their early 20s --
who were boys when the epidemic struck a decade ago -- shun
condoms because they see AIDS as a problem of the older
"leather-bar" generation, Mr. Stall says, which is a fatal
illusion. He says if something isn't done, "I'm afraid we're
going to lose the next generation."</p>
<p>Gabe Kruks of the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Community
Services Center says recent strides in AIDS therapy may have
given lapsers a false sense of security. "The epidemic isn't
over," he says. "It's not yet a chronic manageable illness."</p>
<p>Samuel Broder, National Cancer Institute director and
developer of such drugs as AZT, DDC and DDI, cautions: "No
drug in existence, or even on the drawing boards, is better
than prevention."</p>
<p>Advocacy groups suggest that education programs have been
hurt by their own success. AIDS control worked so well among
white gay professionals that it masked a lack of similar
success among minorities and young men in their teens and
20s. Funds need to be renewed, programs retargeted, they say.</p>
<p>Education programs should stress continuation of safe sex,
promote role models of healthy intimacy and "eroticize safe
sex," they say, to make healthy practices desirable, not
merely antiseptic.</p>
<p>Of course, sexual risk-taking isn't confined to gay men.
In a recent letter to the New England Journal of Medicine
headlined "Sex, Lies and HIV," two Southern California
scientists said a survey found Los Angeles area college
students admitted lying regularly about their intimate
histories to obtain sex. And the Rev. George Exoo, a gay
Episcopal priest in Charleston, S.C., says bisexual married
men frequent highway rest stops near his parish for
clandestine encounters. Activists urge that safe-sex messages
be written to reach everyone, not simply urban gays.</p>
<p>Programs for young people should break through their sense
of immunity and immortality, activists add. "We have to
rethink our prevention efforts," Mr. Stall says. "Declaring
victory and abandoning the field is a recipe for disaster."</p>
