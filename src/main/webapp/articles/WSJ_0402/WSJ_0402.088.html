	<p class="article-leader">SANTA ANA, Calif. -- Janet Faye McKinzie, business manager
and executive consultant for the late president of the
now-insolvent North America Savings & Loan Association, was
found guilty by a federal jury of stealing $15.5 million from
the thrift.
   The jury found Ms. McKinzie guilty of 22 counts of
racketeering, conspiracy, wire and bank fraud, and interstate
transportation of stolen property. Under the various counts,
she could be sentenced to a total of 175 years in prison. A
sentencing date hasn't yet been set.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Thrift regulators said the collapse of Santa Ana-based
North America Savings is one of the worst examples of insider
corruption ever found at an S&L. The thrift's demise
eventually cost taxpayers $120 million, regulators said.</p>
<p>The jury of six men and six women took eight days to
return its verdict, after a trial that lasted eight weeks.</p>
<p>Ms. McKinzie had pleaded innocent by reason of insanity.
Her attorneys had argued that her judgment was impaired by
prescription drugs she was taking. She couldn't be reached
for comment.</p>
<p>Duayne D. Christensen, a Westminster, Calif., dentist,
invested $6.4 million to open North American Savings in 1983.
Ms. McKinzie was a consultant to Dr. Christensen in operating
the thrift. In 1986, the thrift lost $8.9 million in the
first 11 months. Government prosecutors charged that the two
lived a lavish life style, using thrift funds to buy Rolls
Royce autos, a $125,000 gold eagle statue and an $18,500 gold
letter opener.</p>
<p>In 1987, a week before federal regulators declared the
thrift insolvent, Dr. Christensen, 57 years old, died when
his Jaguar crashed into a freeway overpass. The Orange county
coroner classified the cause of his death as undetermined,
failing to rule whether it was an accident or suicide.</p>
<p>The jury will decide in a second trial in April whether
Ms. McKinzie will forfeit benefits from a $10 million life
insurance policy left her by Dr. Christensen. Government
prosecutors contend that Dr. Christensen purchased the policy
with proceeds from the theft of North America's assets. The
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. also is trying to seize the
insurance proceeds in a case pending in Los Angeles federal
court.</p>
