	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Merrill Lynch & Co. is still tops among global
underwriters of all stocks and bonds, but its grip slipped in
the first quarter as world-wide financing volume eased.
   Merrill, the nation's largest securities firm, saw its
underwriting lead in the U.S. cut in half from a year
earlier. Goldman Sachs & Co. is hot on Merrill's heels in
both the U.S. and global underwriting races. And Morgan
Stanley & Co. and Bear Stearns Cos. made headway at the
expense of First Boston Corp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Merrill does well when the run-of-the-mill company is
seeking additional funds," says Perrin Long Jr., senior
securities analyst for Lipper Analytical Securities Corp.
"When it becomes quality-type companies, the top-tier
investment bankers -- Morgan Stanley and Goldman -- do well."</p>
<p>Merrill was hard hit by the pullback of financial
institutions from issuing new securities. These firms,
including commercial banks and savings and loans, raised just
$13.5 billion in the first quarter, down nearly 50% from
year-earlier levels. This helped pull down the volume of
conventional debt offerings underwritten by Merrill to $6.5
billion from $9.8 billion a year ago.</p>
<p>Merrill officials say many corporate issuers are sitting
tight, waiting for clues to the direction of interest rates.
And Merrill contends that it's difficult to draw conclusions
from just one quarter.</p>
<p>"It's a little bit like talking to the coach at the end of
the first quarter in a basketball game," says Edson Mitchell,
a Merrill managing director.</p>
<p>Despite its slip, Merrill continues to lead in most
sectors of the debt market. It's still the leading manager of
domestic new issues, raising $12.4 billion, and tops in
global new issues, raising $12.8 billion in the first
quarter, according to Securities Data Co.</p>
<p>And Mr. Mitchell expects Merrill to continue its dominance
because of what he says are a strong capital markets
operation and trading and distribution outlets.</p>
<p>Overall, a burst of new issues in the past two weeks
propped first-quarter stock and bond offerings in the U.S. to
$77.7 billion, up from $73.3 billion a year earlier. But
political and economic uncertainty hammered overseas
activity, particularly the Japanese market; the volume of
global stock and bond issues slipped 10% from 1989's first
period.</p>
<p>The collapse of the junk-bond market, meanwhile, helped
trigger a pickup in mortgage and asset-backed debt.
Investors, skittish about junk, turned to high-quality
mortgage paper backed by the U.S. government, analysts said.
For the first time, mortgage and asset-backed securities
accounted for more than 50% of total new-issue volume of
stock and debt securities.</p>
<p>But the traditional leaders of this sector -- Salomon
Brothers Inc., First Boston and Goldman -- were toppled. Bear
Stearns took the crown for the period, underwriting $5.9
billion of mortgage-backed bonds for a market share of 13.7%.</p>
<p>Goldman's overall strong performance stemmed from common
stock offerings; it raised $1.4 billion for a market share of
19.1%. (Overall, issuers of common stock raised more than $7
billion in the first quarter, an 82% increase from a year
earlier.) Goldman also topped the list of initial public
offerings, underwriting $926.6 million in the period.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley led the pack in underwriting conventional
debt securities, raising $7.6 billion, a market share of
nearly 30%. The bulk of Morgan Stanley's success in the
quarter stems from $1.7 billion raised for employee stock
ownership trusts and the firm's strong relationship with
federal credit agencies, especially the Student Loan
Marketing Association, or Sallie Mae.</p>
<p>Sallie Mae, 1990's largest issuer of corporate debt,
called on Morgan Stanley to underwrite 49% of the $3.9
billion it issued so far this year.</p>
