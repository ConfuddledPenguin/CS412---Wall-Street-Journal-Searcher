	<p class="article-leader">TAIPEI -- The Taiwanese Finance Ministry said it will
lower the tariff on small passager cars to 30% from 40%.
   During the annual tariff reduction meeting, ministry
officials said the cut for imported autos is in line with the
six-year Auto Industry Development Plan that expires in 1991.
The plan is aimed at gradually opening the local market to
foreign cars.</p>
