	<p class="article-leader">The U.S. is already waist deep in the big muddy of the
Savings and Loan crisis, and both legislators and regulators
are slogging deeper. With Senators insisting on a thrift
supervisor who will carry their political water, and with
regulators incredibly suggesting that the U.S. government may
default on obligations it has assumed, the morass is growing
more expensive for taxpayers and threatening to the general
economy. It is becoming a financial Vietnam.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Same Old Stand</p>
<p>One would have thought that some residual sense of
self-awareness and human decency would have restrained
members of the Senate Banking Committee in the confirmation
hearings on Timothy Ryan's nomination as director of the
Office of Thrift Supervision. After all, the nomination was
intended to fix a problem they had caused in trying to
install M. Danny Wall in the post. A federal court ruled that
Mr. Wall had been appointed unconstitutionally, and that the
work of the OTS is therefore null and void. While this ruling
has been temporarily stayed, the only sure fix is a new
nominee properly nominated and approved.</p>
<p>Then too, five Senators, including Banking Committee
Chairman Don Riegle, are in political hot water for leaning
on regulators to go easy on Lincoln Savings & Loan. In
addition to hanging uninsured paper on widows, Lincoln's
Charles Keating had showered PAC contributions on Senators.
He showed up at the hearings to oppose Mr. Ryan as lacking
experience in the ways of the thrift world. For that matter,
the Senators and their House colleagues pretty much caused
the thrift crisis with legislation, notably the expansion of
deposit insurance to $100,000 an account, designed to reward
their thrift contributors and their allies, real-estate
magnates in every Congressional District.</p>
<p>But no, it seems that some members of The World's Greatest
Deliberative Body are immune to the least flicker of shame.
The likes of Chairman Riegel and Senator Alan Cranston
assaulted Mr. Ryan for lack of experience and for some
remotely imagined conflict of interest (as best we can make
out, hiring the same person in private life he'd earlier
hired in government). When the committee took its vote on Mr.
Ryan Friday, two Democrats joined the panel's nine
Republicans to squeak the nominee through, 11 to 10. Within
hours, someone leaked to NBC the fact that Mr. Ryan, 44, had
included in his FBI report an admission of some drug use when
he was in law school, and some pious Democratic Senators were
quick to start discussing an end to the nomination. Well,
it's spring and the traditional Beltway slime is oozing
again.</p>
<p>We ourselves have little idea what Mr. Ryan may do in the
office, but we're willing to take our chances with anyone of
some independence. The objecting Senators' real problem is
precisely Mr. Ryan's independence, in particular his
statement that he had no opinion on whether the thrift
industry ought to be preserved; acting director Salvatore
Martoche has no more experience in thrifts, but was warmly
received in Congress after taking the pledge to make sure a
thrift industry survives.</p>
<p>In fact, in the current financial environment there is no
public-policy justification whatever for a separate and
distinct Savings and Loan industry. The good thrifts should
become banks, or perhaps in some cases financial firms
without deposit insurance. The rest should be put out of
their misery with the least damage to anyone else. It is
precisely because the thrifts' protectors in Congress know
this to be true that they make an issue of the point. In
short, Congress got us into this mess by showering
preferences on a narrow industry with deep pockets for
contributions. In their reception of Mr. Ryan, many of the
same Senators are back at the same old stand.</p>
<p>Franklin and Other Blunders</p>
<p>Officials of the Resolution Trust Corp., another head of
the hydra that runs the thrift bailout, meet today with Wall
Street types over the turmoil in the mortgage-backed bond
market caused by the seizure of Franklin Savings & Loan of
Ottawa, Kansas. No one had doubted that Franklin could meet
its interest payments on bonds it had issued, but the
government seized it anyway and is now threatening to default
on its interest payments. This is how regulators stabilize
our financial system.</p>
<p>While there's no reason to question the integrity or
sophistication of Franklin's management, we can understand
why regulators might look cross-eyed. Recognizing that making
real-estate loans was not a particularly good use of thrift
resources, Franklin's Ernest Fleischer decided instead to
invest in mortgage-backed bonds, then to hedge against
interest-rate movements. This left an apparently guaranteed
return, and allowed him to garner enough insured deposits to
balloon the prairie thrift into an $11 billion institution.
But by second-guessing the concern's auditors on when hedge
losses need to be recognized, regulators toppled the empire,
even though it had assets to meet its liabilities.</p>
<p>The Franklin hedge operation is best understood as a way
to distill out the financial essence of the insurance on
thrift deposits. Deposit insurance lowered the cost of
liabilities without affecting the return on assets; with
securities instead of real estate, and with interest rates
hedged, nothing was left but the spread (and, we learn, an
unhedgeable regulatory risk). Very neat, but what public
purpose does it serve to deserve the potential taxpayer
liability implicit in insurance?</p>
<p>In defense of Mr. Fleischer, he didn't make up the rules.
And investing insured deposits in a diversified portfolio of
mortgage-backed bonds serves at least as much public purpose
as investing them in unneeded shopping centers or office
buildings. Ultimately the question Franklin raises is whether
we need any subsidized thrift industry, but its structure
also boiled this issue down into its purest essence. This is
presumably why regulators were uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Franklin was a solvent institution, not likely to go
belly-up soon, at least on the basis of anything public so
far. The problem is simply that there's no reason for
taxpayers to subsidize a hedging operation. The textbook
solution would be to phase down deposit insurance, and
therefore Franklin's spreads. The old-time solution would be
for regulators to take Mr. Fleischer for a walk in the wheat
fields, and tell him to unwind his positions and retire to
Palm Springs. After all, he is the single most qualified
person to undo the positions with minimum disruption.</p>
<p>Instead, the regulators decided to tank Franklin and its
$11 billion in assets. Then they started making noises about
provisions in Congress's bailout masterpiece that might be
interpreted to say that after a thrift is seized, the
government can suspend interest payments on liabilities even
if they are backed with the collateral of firm assets.
Standard and Poor's noticed and reviewed the rating of the
bonds. The markets reacted in shock, and the regulators
retired to scratch their heads. Pending lawsuits, they may
for better or worse destroy the hedge operation, but they
have chosen the course of maximum disruption, maximum cost to
the taxpayer, and maximum risk to the financial system.</p>
<p>Franklin is a dramatic example, but unhappily does not
seem to be an isolated one. Regulators, for example, are
tearing up contracts with people who bought sick thrifts at
their urging the last time around. Aside from the legal
problems this raises and the attendant financial
uncertainties, there is the simple business point. The
regulators' chief task is to dispose of the portfolios they
are seizing; if they welch on their last agreements, who will
deal with them now? They are already coming back to taxpayers
for more money to carry assets they have been unwilling or
unable to sell.</p>
<p>Minding the Store</p>
<p>If we are not to keep sinking deeper in the mire, someone
is going to have to take charge. It's a bit hard to say who
that should be, given that Congress has designed a regulatory
structure ideal for buck-passing. But the best hope is that
Treasury Secretary Nick Brady drops the gentlemanly role and
starts knocking some heads. He should tell Senate Democrats
that if they reject Mr. Ryan they'll get Attila the Hun. He
should tell the regulators twice a day that their job is not
to punish miscreants but to stabilize the financial system.
And he should put his troops at Treasury at work on a plan to
pare back the underlying problem of deposit insurance, so at
the very least the Bush administration can make clear who
wants to solve the S&L mess and who does not.</p>
