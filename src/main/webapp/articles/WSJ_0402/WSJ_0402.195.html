	<p class="article-leader">Columbia Savings & Loan Association disclosed late
yesterday that it is insolvent, making likely an expensive
government takeover of the big California thrift, one of
Michael Milken's biggest allies in revolutionizing the junk
bond market.
   Columbia, based in Beverly Hills, Calif., was once the
nation's most profitable thrift by virtue of its huge stake
in junk bonds, many bought from Mr. Milken and his securities
firm, the now-defunct Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. But
Columbia reported huge losses yesterday from massive
deterioration in that junk bond portfolio over the last five
months, joining many other firms that have foundered as
either buyers or sellers of high-yield debt.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Columbia said it had a loss of $379.1 million, or $19.17 a
share, in the fourth quarter. The losses reflect junk
bond-related loss provisions and write-downs of about $470
million in the quarter. Moreover, the company said it had a
loss of nearly $200 million in the first two months of 1990
because of further junk bond trouble. As of Feb. 28, Columbia
said it had a $121 million shareholder deficit, compared with
equity of $77.6 million three months earlier.</p>
<p>The worse-than-expected results leave troubled Columbia
teetering on the edge of federal receivership. The $9.25
billion-asset institution has been subject to federal
operating restrictions for several months as junk bond losses
have eroded its equity to the point that it violated certain
new federal regulations for minimum capital levels. Because
of federal regulations covering insolvent institutions, the
company will now be barred from making any new loan or
investment without prior regulatory approval, a condition
that regulators say makes it all but impossible to secure a
capital infusion from outside investors.</p>
<p>If Columbia fails, the government would become the
nation's largest holder of junk bonds with a total portfolio,
including junk bonds from other thrift failures, with a face
value well in excess of $8 billion, and indicated losses of
about $2 billion. Regulators weren't available yesterday for
comment on Columbia.</p>
<p>Columbia officials declined to comment beyond a written
statement. Recently, the federal Office of Thrift Supervision
has shown little mercy in handling other capital-shy thrifts'
bids to avoid federal receivership. Edward G. Harshfield,
Columbia's president and chief executive officer, said in the
statement: "Our regulators have been working with us in a
very constructive manner."</p>
<p>Federal regulators have already seized three of the thrift
industry's top five holders of junk bonds in recent months.
The junk bond losses reflect a provision of the thrift
bailout bill last August that requires S&Ls to carry junk
bonds on their books at market prices. The rule's impact on
the industry generally has been limited because relatively
few thrifts bought such bonds, but it has been devastating
for those that did.</p>
<p>Columbia's results also augur possibly
larger-than-anticipated losses at other junk bond-investing
thrifts. In December, Columbia indicated it would take
fourth-quarter write-downs or losses on its junk bond
portfolio of at least $320 million, compared with the $470
million in losses or write-downs that it ended up actually
incurring. Because of write-downs and other factors, the
value of junk bonds and certain preferred stock on Columbia's
books sank to $3.38 billion as of Dec. 31 from $4.36 billion
as of Sept. 30, a decline of 23%.</p>
<p>Columbia is pinning its hopes for avoiding federal
receivership on selling its junk bonds and concentrating on
making mortgage loans and pursuing other traditional thrift
activities. But it is doubtful that regulators will approve
the plan because of the thrift's insolvency and bleaker
prospects. Because of continuing upheaval in the junk bond
market, for instance, Columbia said "significant additional
loss reserves and other asset write-downs" were expected for
the month of March.</p>
<p>Columbia has proposed that it divest itself of all its
junk bonds over five years as a way of meeting new
regulations that bar thrifts from holding such bonds.
Yesterday, Columbia disclosed it had already sold $575
million in junk bonds between last August and this past
February.</p>
<p>As an alternative, the company has also proposed a
one-time divestiture of the bonds as part of a "structured
financing." It said First Boston Corp. had begun discussions
with interested parties but that the plan carried some
drawbacks.</p>
<p>In the year, Columbia had a loss of $591.1 million, or
$30.11 a share, compared with profit of $65 million, or $1.49
a share, in 1988. The 1989 results reflected write-downs and
loss provisions totaling $870 million, most of which were
junk bond-related. At year's end, Columbia said it had
reserves for future junk bond losses of about $275 million,
or enough to absorb a further 7.5% reduction in the value of
its portfolio.</p>
<p>Moreover, Columbia's fourth-quarter report showed that it
is having trouble in some of its hoped-for core businesses.
It reported a $43.7 million loss from real-estate operations
compared with a $22.3 million third-quarter loss and profit
of $5 million in the year-earlier fourth quarter. Its
fourth-quarter net interest income slid 47% to $31.7 million
from $60.5 million, reflecting the higher cost of funds as
well as troubled assets.</p>
<p>Some analysts have questioned whether the company is
capable of successfully making the transition to being a
conventional S&L, saying that it operates a relatively small
29-office branch network and has traditionally gathered a
large chunk of its deposits through Wall Street money
brokers.</p>
