	<p class="article-leader">Occidental Petroleum (Caledonia) Ltd., a unit of Los
Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum Corp., said it discovered
oil and natural gas in the North Sea about 120 miles
northeast of Aberdeen, Scotland.
   The Occidental unit in London said an exploration well
about nine miles southeast of the North Sea's Piper field
tested at a maximum daily flow rate of 6,529 barrels of oil
and 12.5 million cubic feet of natural gas through a
48/64-inch opening. The well was drilled by a
semi-submersible rig on the Westray prospect in Block 15/17
to a total depth of 15,670 feet.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts said they couldn't determine the significance of
the discovery, partly because of its proximity to the Piper
field and its satellite Saltire field. "This at least
confirms that they have a decent-sized discovery at Saltire,"
said Bryan Jacoboski at PaineWebber Inc.</p>
<p>Occidental is the well operator and holds a 36.5% interest
in it.</p>
