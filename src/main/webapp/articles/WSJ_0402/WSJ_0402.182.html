	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve's policy-setting
committee voted in February not to alter monetary policy, but
a newly released summary of the meeting shows that, for the
first time in months, some Fed officials talked of raising
interest rates.
   By an 8-3 vote, the Fed's open market committee decided at
its Feb. 6 and 7 meeting not to push rates up or down. The
committee didn't lean toward any change in rates in the
following weeks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The committee met again last week. It won't disclose last
week's decisions until mid-May, but the Fed has given no
indication of any policy change in its daily dealings in
financial markets. After gradually lowering short-term rates
for six months, the Fed paused at the end of last year.</p>
<p>By early February, as Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has said
publicly, the Fed concluded that the risks of recession were
receding. Most members noted "some pickup in activity" in the
economy, the summary says. And it adds that most "saw little
prospect that significant progress . . . would be made in
reducing the underlying rate of inflation in the quarters
immediately ahead."</p>
<p>Although a few Fed officials regarded that as a
prescription for higher interest rates, the majority
disagreed. "Such a policy would incur too much risk of
creating financial conditions that could lead to a weaker
economy," the summary says.</p>
<p>Several policy makers -- their identities aren't disclosed
in the summary -- "observed a sense of unease and fragility
in the business and financial communities arising from such
factors as declining profit margins, heavy debt burdens and
problems in certain sectors of the financial markets that
were contributing to greater caution on the part of lenders
and a reduced availability of credit to some borrowers,"
according to the summary.</p>
<p>None of the six Fed governors voted to raise rates, but
two presidents of district reserve banks did. Fed Gov. Martha
Seger dissented on the side of easier policy, as she often
does.</p>
<p>Lee Hoskins, president of the Cleveland Fed, wanted an
immediate tightening of the Fed's grip on credit to counter
inflationary pressures. He advocated gradually tightening
monetary policy to wring inflation out of the economy. Robert
Boykin, president of the Dallas Fed, was prepared to accept
unaltered policy for the moment, but dissented because he
wanted to lean toward tighter policy. He cited the "risks of
delaying decisions until there was full confirmation of
inflationary pressures."</p>
<p>Five of the 12 Fed bank presidents vote on monetary policy
at any one time. Mr. Hoskins and Mr. Boykin began serving as
voting members at the February meeting and will continue to
cast votes through year-end.</p>
<p>Minneapolis Fed President Gary Stern cast his vote with
the majority on the direction of near-term monetary policy.
But in a separate vote setting the Fed's goals for growth in
the money supply this year, Mr. Stern joined Mr. Hoskins in
dissenting on the side of tighter credit.</p>
<p>By an 8-3 vote, the open market committee decided that the
money supply, as measured by M2, should grow between 3% and
7% in 1990, the same range as last year. Mr. Stern and Mr.
Hoskins wanted to lower the acceptable range, arguing that
the Fed won't be able to reduce inflation if the money supply
grows as fast as 7% this year.</p>
<p>Some other Fed policy makers shared that fear, the summary
indicates, but said they would go along with a 3% to 7% range
"if its upper limit was viewed as a firm constraint . . . and
if a clear explanation was made of the committee's commitment
to achieve price stability over time." The Fed did explain
the commitment in congressional testimony later in the month.</p>
<p>Ms. Seger wanted to raise the growth targets to between 3
1/2% and 7 1/2%.</p>
<p>The M2 measure of the money supply includes currency as
well as checking, savings and money market accounts.</p>
