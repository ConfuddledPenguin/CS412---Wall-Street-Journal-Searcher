	<p class="article-leader">To be mainstream used to be a blessing for products. Now,
it's becoming the curse of the mundane.
   Solid, middle-of-the-road names such as Sears, Holiday Inn
and Smirnoff, are struggling against a slew of new
competitors that strike from two sides -- above and below.
Encircled by rivals offering either more luxurious goods or
just plain cheaper ones, midpriced products are finding their
market shares dwindling and looking for ways to break away
from the image of being "just average."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Getting stuck in the middle is a terrible fate," says
Laurel Cutler, vice chairman of New York advertising agency
FCB/Leber Katz Partners. "It's the phenomenon of being a mass
brand as the market splinters."</p>
<p>To wit: Swanky stores such as Neiman-Marcus and budget
outlets such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. are prospering, while
the bread-and-butter Sears, Roebuck & Co. flounders. Haagen
Dazs, Ben & Jerry's and other "super premium" ice creams are
thriving -- as are grocers' own bargain labels -- while basic
brands such as Kraft General Foods Corp.'s Sealtest are
struggling to hold their ground. Travelers want either cheap
lodging at chains such as Day's Inn or to sleep in the lap of
luxury, leaving adequate but unexciting hoteliers such as
Ramada Inn and Holiday Inn in the lurch.</p>
<p>"The mainstream brands of old are increasingly under
pressure from both ends of the spectrum," says John Quelch, a
professor at Harvard Business School who specializes in
consumer marketing.</p>
<p>Adds Ms. Cutler, "There's no future for products everyone
likes a little."</p>
<p>The murky-middle problem has some roots in demographics.
The population growth of the 1940s through 1960s that
established mass-market brands has slowed. And while markets
have stopped growing, competition has exploded: The number of
items stocked at grocery stores has soared from a few
thousand 30 years ago to over 40,000 at large supermarkets
today.</p>
<p>But the problem goes beyond just population and
competition. Since the early 1970s, families have hardly
managed to boost incomes. For baby boomers starting out,
that's made upward mobility more difficult -- hence the need
for bargains.</p>
<p>At the same time, it's also made them insecure, argues
Frank Levy, an economist with the University of Maryland's
School of Public Affairs. Feeling their economic status is
precarious, middle-class consumers have become loath to
identify with middle-road products, often wrapping themselves
in prestige brands. "Status anxiety makes niche marketing
very attractive," Mr. Levy says.</p>
<p>This emphasis on image -- not to mention a foreign
invasion -- has put Smirnoff vodka on the defensive. The
domestic brand, a product of Grand Metropolitan PLC's
Heublein Inc., sells for a moderate $6 to $9 a bottle and
faces growing competition from a horde of imported, heavily
advertised rivals, led by Carillon Importers Ltd.'s Absolut.
Last year, U.S. sales of all high-priced imported vodkas,
including Stolichnaya, Finlandia, Icy and Tanqueray Sterling,
rose more than 20%.</p>
<p>Smirnoff remains the nation's best-selling vodka, but unit
sales barely grew at all last year, according to Al Sanchez,
manager of research and statistics for Jobson Publishing
Corp.'s alcoholic beverage unit. To keep from slipping,
Smirnoff has been attempting to strengthen its image of
quality by raising prices and running ads with a more upscale
look. The company is also pursuing a counterattack, pressing
for more sales overseas.</p>
<p>If a middle-price product can't sell on prestige, it has
to compete on value. To make Sealtest stand out from
store-brand ice creams, Paul Litwack, marketing director for
frozen desserts at Kraft, has borrowed some tactics from
fancier brands. It recently added a layer of cellophane
inside the carton -- like the one found in Breyers, a sister
brand -- to slow formation of ice crystals. Kraft, a unit of
Philip Morris Cos., also made the package's graphics cleaner
and more modern. The idea is to keep the price the same,
about $2.99 a half gallon, but come across to consumers as a
better value. Still, the product remains in that not-cheap,
not-expensive limbo. Says Mr. Litwack: "It's a very tough
category."</p>
<p>An average image also haunts retailers J.C. Penney Co. and
Sears, both of which have seen their middle-income customers
defect to discount outlets or trendier specialty stores. Both
chains are scrambling to revitalize sales by trying to
project an image that's a step up from vanilla. They are
stocking more national-brand goods and running slicker, more
stylish ads to herald the change.</p>
<p>Sears maintains its program has been successful in
strengthening its image with consumers. Unfortunately,
perceptions die hard. Despite its much-ballyhooed name-brand
strategy, Sears's profits are flagging. "Sears doesn't stand
for anything customers aspire to," says John Lister,
executive vice president at Lister Butler Inc., a New York
image consultant.</p>
<p>Technology has worked against some middle marketers by
giving a boost to cheap rivals. Seiko Corp. of America, a
unit of Hattori Seiko Co., introduced quartz technology in
1969. In no time, Seiko was faced with threatening,
low-priced competition from Timex Corp., Swatch Watch Corp.
and other companies that could use highly precise quartz
technology in timepieces selling for under $50. "There's no
reason to spend more than $100 on a watch unless you're
looking for diamonds and gold," says C. Michael Jacobi, vice
president of marketing and sales at Timex.</p>
<p>Then, with the advent of the yuppie mentality,
status-oozing Rolex and PatekPhilippe watches took a bite
from the top.</p>
<p>Seiko has responded by expanding its lines beyond the
middle. It now sells the pricey Lassale and the inexpensive
Lorus. It's also trying to blend fashion with its traditional
claim of superior technology. A snappy $325 analog model, for
example, shows the time in 21 different cities.</p>
<p>Although Seiko maintains it has hung on to about half of
the midpriced segment, the business "has been no bed of
roses," says Joe Whall, a Seiko spokesman.</p>
<p>"It's hard for middle-segment watches to compete either on
elegance or on price," says Robert Schmidt, chairman of
Levine, Huntley, Schmidt & Beaver Inc., the agency that, in
1987, created some stylish ads for midpriced Citizen Watch
Co. set to the music of Louis Armstrong and Al Jolson. "We
used style to make people feel good about wearing them." He
says sales of the brand, virtually unknown at the time,
soared to two million units annually, from a scant 200,000.</p>
<p>Despite the success of the ads, Citizen discontinued them
last year and switched agencies. Now, the brand seems to have
lost its momentum. Executives at Citizen couldn't be reached
for comment.</p>
<p>For some, it finally gets to the point where the middle
market just isn't worth it. Marriott Corp. tried to string
its Bob's Big Boy, Allie's and Wag's coffee shops into a
single, national chain of casual restaurants. It was a
nebulous niche that few consumers wanted: The restaurants
weren't as cheap or as appealing to children as fast food.
Nor could they please adults with a nice dining-out
atmosphere. Last December, the hotel chain announced plans to
quit the restaurant business.</p>
<p>"We were sandwiched in the middle," a Marriott spokesman
says. "It would have been too costly to establish a new
national brand."</p>
<p>In the hotel industry, where chains have spread rapidly,
companies are trying to extend their reach both into cheaper
accommodations and higher-priced ones. Holiday Corp.'s
Holiday Inns, which no longer has the casual family traveler
all to itself, has added a more upscale entry called Holiday
Inns Crowne Plaza. Ramada Inn now operates a low-frills
property called Rodeway Inns and a posher chain called
Renaissance.</p>
<p>Prime Motor Inns Corp., which operates Ramada's U.S.
franchise system and owns or franchises such chains as Howard
Johnson, maintains there is still opportunity to serve
middle-market customers. The trick, it says, is to
distinguish itself from midrange competitors. So Prime has
begun building suite hotels, called AmeriSuites and
Plaza-Suite Hotels. Chris Browne, senior vice president of
marketing and reservations for Prime's franchise systems
division, says the company scrimped on common areas and nixed
room service in order to offer rooms with amenities such as
two phones, a microwave and a refrigerator, all at the same
price as Holiday Inns.</p>
<p>Prime predicts an industry shakeout, and expects to
survive. Until then, he says, "If you sit still and do
nothing, you'll be devoured."</p>
<p>The middle isn't nearly as amorphous for many
packaged-goods makers, where there is often less opportunity
to develop prestige brands. But few marketers would dispute
that their business is more complex and more competitive than
ever. Concludes Joel Weiner, a former senior vice president
at Kraft General Foods: "It's a combat zone, and even strong
brands are employing battle tactics to hold their share."</p>
