	<p class="article-leader">The Dutch paper and packaging manufacturing group
Buehrmann-Tetterode N.V. offered a bid of #154 million
($251.9 million) for the U.K. paper distributor Robert Horne
Group PLC.
   The takeover bid has been widely anticipated since
Buehrmann-Tetterode announced in mid-January that it was
conducting talks with Robert Horne.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Buehrmann-Tetterode said that it was prepared to offer for
each ordinary voting share 490 pence ($8.01) while it would
pay 452 pence ($7.39) for each ordinary nonvoting share.</p>
<p>Shareholders of Robert Horne would have the option of
receiving payment in cash, or as much as 30% of the value of
the offer in Buehrmann-Tetterode bearer depositary receipts.
Also, shareholders will be offered loan notes from
Buehrmann-Tetterode or any combination of cash, depositary
receipts or loan notes.</p>
<p>Although the takeover is friendly, with both sides
agreeing to the terms, it is also conditional on
Buehrmann-Tetterode's acquiring 90% of the ordinary voting
and nonvoting shares outstanding.</p>
