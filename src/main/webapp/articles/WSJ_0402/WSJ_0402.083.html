	<p class="article-leader">The Corn Belt will expand a notch this year to a four-year
high of 74.8 million acres, up 4% from 1989, according to the
Agriculture Department's spring planting report.
   The planned increase in corn acreage will more than offset
an expected 1.2 million-acre, or 2%, shrinkage in soybean
planting. Farmers said they intend to plant 59.4 million
acres in soybeans.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The report, based on a survey of 75,000 farmers in early
March, is the first indication provided by the government of
the size of these crops. As such, it is eagerly awaited by
agricultural export and commodity industry analysts as a
harbinger of crop price trends for the year.</p>
<p>The corn planting figure was about what analysts expected.
But the soybean acreage, while down from a year ago, still
exceeded most expectations.</p>
<p>"The soybean figure is a bit of a surprise," said Conrad
Leslie, futures analyst and founder of Leslie Analytical in
Chicago. He said that based on prices offered by grain
elevators and others after the figures were released Friday
afternoon, soybean futures for November delivery could open
for trading about five cents a bushel lower this morning on
the Chicago Board of Trade.</p>
<p>On Friday, November soybean futures closed 7.25 cents
higher, at $6.22 a bushel. The planting figures were released
after the close of trading.</p>
<p>Corn futures for December delivery gained 0.75 cent a
bushel to close at $2.5425 on the Board of Trade.</p>
<p>While no change is foreseen for corn acreage in Iowa and
Illinois, the largest corn growing states, corn growers are
expected this spring to plant an additional 2.5 million acres
elsewhere, including 300,000 acres in Nebraska, 200,000 acres
in Minnesota and 450,000 in Ohio.</p>
<p>In a separate report on grain stocks, the Agriculture
Department said corn stockpiles as of March 1 had declined 8%
from a year ago to 4.81 billion bushels, and soybean
stockpiles grew 19% to 1.06 billion bushels. Wheat stockpiles
dropped 23% to 944 million bushels during the period.</p>
<p>The current inclination to favor corn over soybeans this
spring reflects, among other things, a recent softening in
soybean futures prices as farmers and traders wait to see how
aggressively Brazilian farmers will market their newly
harvested soybean crop, analysts said. If a recent currency
devaluation and other radical economic reforms force them to
be aggressive sellers, the resulting sag in U.S. soybean
prices could impel American farmers to plant more corn at
soybeans' expense.</p>
<p>"There are no soybeans planted yet," says David Asbridge,
an American Soybean Association economist. "Things could
still change."</p>
<p>The survey of planting intentions also shows that the
higher target price for corn under the government's
commodity-subsidy program continues to make corn more
attractive than other less-subsidized feed grains.</p>
<p>Barley acreage is expected to fall 3% from last year to
8.89 million acres, sorghum acreage is expected to fall 9% to
11.5 million acres and oat acreage is expected to fall 9% to
11 million acres. Of that, oat growers are expected to
harvest 6.35 million acres, down 8% from last year, and leave
the remainder as a cover crop.</p>
<p>The department estimates winter wheat acreage -- planted
last fall for harvest by early this summer -- at 57.2 million
acres, up 4% from the previous year. Winter wheat accounts
for three-fourths of the U.S. harvest. A 4% increase would
more than offset the expected 12% drop in durum wheat
planting and a 4% drop in other spring wheat planting.</p>
<p>The decreases foreseen for sorghum and spring wheat
acreage this year may be exaggerated, department analysts
cautioned. Many winter wheat farmers replanted their fields
with spring wheat in Washington state and Idaho, and with
sorghum in Kansas, after cold weather killed their emergent
crop of winter wheat. This inflated the acreage figures for
both crops, they said.</p>
<p>Of all major crops, cotton is expected to show the
greatest expansion -- 17% to 12.4 million acres, which is
slightly more than industry analysts had projected.</p>
<p>Because of a large cotton surplus last year, the
department required cotton farmers to set aside 25% of their
acreage. The requirement was lowered to 12.5% this year as
strong export demand cut cotton stockpiles in half.</p>
