	<p class="article-leader">HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Chrysler Corp. is asking its top
100 executives to own stock equal to a certain percentage of
their salaries in an unusual program to focus their attention
on the auto maker's long-term future.
   The program, promoted by Chairman Lee A. Iacocca, is the
latest such measure aimed at giving Chrysler officials a
direct financial interest in the company's fate above and
beyond the usual executive stock options.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Already, most of the auto maker's top 2,000 officials have
gambled as much as 10% of their base pay on the company's
ability to cut $1 billion from its costs by Dec. 31. If the
cost-cutting drive succeeds, the officials will profit
handsomely. But they lose their money if the goal isn't met.</p>
<p>"We are trying a number of unique methods to get top
management to share the risks or rewards of the next few
years," said company spokesman Steven Harris of the new
stock-ownership program.</p>
<p>In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Chrysler common closed at $16.625, off 25 cents, on
volume of 642,200 shares. In the past 52 weeks, the stock
traded at a low of $15.875 and a high of $27.125.</p>
<p>Separately, Ford Motor Co. reinstated merit-pay raises for
its 55,000 salaried employees effective yesterday. Ford had
suspended merit-pay increases in January because of sagging
financial results, but said then that it would consider
reinstating such raises at the end of the first quarter.</p>
<p>In a letter to employees in the U.S. and Canada, Ford
executives said the company believes the sales downturn has
bottomed out and that the worst is behind Ford. The
No.2-ranked auto maker cautioned employees that many
uncertainties remain this year.</p>
<p>Still, Ford's guarded optimism contrasts with the
austerity mode at Chrysler, which alone among the Big Three
auto makers didn't pay executive bonuses this year.</p>
<p>The Chrysler stock-ownership goal for executives, which
began recently, isn't mandatory. But it does provide each
executive with guidelines on the amount of Chrysler stock
that he or she should own to have a "fair share" of the
company.</p>
<p>The guidelines are based on a formula tied to the
executive's pay and seniority with the No. 3-ranked U.S. auto
maker. Shares the executives already control through stock
options, recent purchases and so-called 401K savings plans
count in the program. Chrysler declined to provide further
details.</p>
<p>It's unclear how many U.S. companies have similar
stock-ownership targets, but such goals don't exist at Ford
or at No. 1-ranked General Motors Corp. Three years ago, GM
did change its management bonus payments to stock from cash.
But because the stock can be sold, that doesn't amount to a
specific stock-ownership goal for executives.</p>
