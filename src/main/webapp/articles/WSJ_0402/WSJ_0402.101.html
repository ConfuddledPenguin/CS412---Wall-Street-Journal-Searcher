	<p class="article-leader">UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. -- Taking note of dizzying
increases in compensation for movie executives, MCA Inc. did
the right thing by its film chief Thomas Pollock, breaking
with tradition and giving Mr. Pollock stock options that had
a value of $7.8 million at the time MCA directors approved
them.
   According to proxy materials mailed to shareholders
Friday, MCA will ask holders to approve the company's first
stock-option plan in a generation, a plan that calls for the
issue of five million new shares. The only beneficiary of the
plan so far is Mr. Pollock, who would receive options to buy
600,000 shares at an exercise price of $55 a share, which
were valued at $68 a share at the time they were awarded last
August.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the shares closed at $51 a share Friday, so they
wouldn't be worth anything today. Mr. Pollock may exercise
the options in 20% yearly increments beginning in July.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Pollock receives a salary increase to
$850,000 a year, from $636,692, as part of a new five-year
contract signed last year. He also receives 95,000 shares of
stock worth $5.7 million, and will receive 150,000 more
shares during the next two years. Company Chairman Lew
Wasserman receives a salary increase to $900,000 a year, from
$559,000, while President Sidney Sheinberg, goes to $900,000
a year from $729,000.</p>
<p>Mr. Sheinberg also received stock valued at $7.3 million.</p>
<p>MCA, with Hollywood's most long-serving management team by
far, has always been relatively conservative about executive
compensation. A stock option plan was adopted by shareholders
in 1968, but never exercised, and though an incentive stock
plan for executives has existed since 1975, the new "stock
awards plan" breaks new ground.</p>
<p>Proxy materials argue that the plan is for "attracting and
retaining executive personnel, motivating executive personnel
by means of growth-related incentives {and} providing
incentive compensation opportunities that are competitive
with those of other major corporations."</p>
<p>These other corporations include Walt Disney Co., whose
chairman Michael Eisner's salary, bonus and options totaled
about $40 million in fiscal 1988. Disney President Frank
Wells realized $72.4 million from the sale of stock bought
through options in 1989, and former Chief Financial Officer
Gary L. Wilson exercised options valued at $47.5 million.</p>
