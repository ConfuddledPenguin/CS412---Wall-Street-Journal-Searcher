	<p class="article-leader">MONTREAL -- Ivaco Inc. and Canron Inc. said Ivaco agreed
to acquire the 21% of Canron it doesn't already own under a
proposed arrangement approved by the boards of both
companies.
   Ivaco and Canron said the arrangement is subject to
approval by regulatory authorities and Canron holders at a
meeting in May. Ivaco, a Montreal-based steel and
steel-products concern, said that under the arrangement it
will make an offer valued at about 42.6 million Canadian
dollars (US$36.3 million) for the publicly held shares of
Canron, a Toronto steel and pipe concern. Under the
arrangement, Ivaco said Canron holders would receive C$20.50
for each Class A or Class B share and C$35 for each Series B
preferred share.</p>

traded Friday before a trading halt at C$11.50, unchanged. In
Toronto, Ivaco Class A shares closed at C$10.25, down 25
Canadian cents.</p>
<p>Paul Ivanier, president and chief executive officer of
Ivaco, said funding for the acquisition would come from the
combined resources of Ivaco and Canron.</p>
<p>Both Ivaco and Canron have been struggling lately. Each
posted a loss for 1989 after extraordinary items and losses
from discontinued operations.</p>
