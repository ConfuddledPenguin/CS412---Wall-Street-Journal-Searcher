	<p class="article-leader">Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.'s Panasonic
Communications & Systems Co. unveiled what it called the
first erasable video disk recorder for a commercial market,
aiming the pricey product at broadcasters but predicting
wider uses.
   The new recorder, which uses lasers to encode up to 60
minutes of television pictures on a 12-inch, two-sided
optical disk, offers a significant advantage over current
videotape recorders: Its pictures can be recalled
instantaneously, without having to rewind through unwanted
footage. That could be a godsend for television sports
producers, for example, allowing them to replay any part of a
game on demand.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The device can also erase and re-record its images at
least one million times, making its laser technology more
economical because disks can be reused. And it has a computer
hook-up, making it useful for big image databases.</p>
<p>Several Japanese companies already make erasable
optical-disk drives for computers. Canon Inc. supplies such a
drive for Next Inc.'s much-publicized workstation. But these
drives store information digitally -- as ones and zeros --
making them impractical for information-intensive video
images. Panasonic's device stores the images in analog form
-- similar to traditional video tape -- rather than in
digital form.</p>
<p>Ed Rothchild, a San Francisco consultant who specializes
in optical storage, said erasable video disk recorders such
as Panasonic's will eventually replace videotape recorders in
the consumer marketplace -- but only when someone figures out
a cost-effective way to fit a feature-length movie on one
side of a disk.</p>
<p>Panasonic didn't announce a price for the recorder, which
will be available in the fourth quarter, but indicated it
will likely cost between $40,000 and $50,000.</p>
