	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Wall Street's profits from underwriting stocks
and bonds teetered near six-year lows in the first quarter.
And the battered junk-bond market promises even leaner times
ahead.
   Fees that firms earned from underwriting new securities
for the first quarter were an anemic $592 million, barely
above the $564 million of a year earlier -- levels not seen
since 1984, according to Securities Data Co. From 1986
through 1988, quarterly fees often topped $1 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The worst may yet lie ahead. That's because the recent
collapse of the junk-bond market makes it all but impossible
that junk underwriting fees will surge after the first
quarter. Fees earned on new issues of these high-yield,
high-risk bonds in the first quarter typically account for
just 15% of the annual total; from 1984 through 1989,
junk-bond fees jumped an average of 50% in the second
quarter, Securities Data says.</p>
<p>These fees until recently were one of Wall Street's big
profit engines; the average junk deal earned a securities
firm $5 million. But the junk market's woe means Wall Street
doesn't have much to look forward to in the next few months.</p>
<p>"Come the end of the next quarter and investment bankers
are really going to feel the pinch," says Francine Wissak, an
analyst for Securities Data. Although some parts of the
underwriting business will rebound, says Edson Mitchell, a
managing director for Merrill Lynch & Co., "the loss of junk
will be very difficult to offset."</p>
<p>Underwriting fees are more important than ever on Wall
Street. That's because with the leveraging binge of the past
decade over, and merger activity down 60% from year-earlier
levels, investment bankers are scratching for ways to make
money. And while quarterly numbers have to be taken with a
grain of salt, first-quarter rankings generally have been
indicative of where securities firms stack up at the end of
the year.</p>
<p>There were a few bright spots. Fees from common-stock
offerings surged 71% to $406 million. And underwriting
profits from initial public stock offerings, bolstered by a
flurry of recent deals, rose 37% to $280 million. Publicly
traded funds continue to dominate IPOs, accounting for 60% of
total volume. The current fad is closed-end funds that invest
in a single foreign country; in past years, the hottest IPOs
were closed-end bond funds.</p>
<p>Still, even with the recent increased activity, fees from
IPOs pale in comparison with the fees of only a few years
ago; in 1986's fourth quarter, for example, they stood at
$541 million -- almost equal to underwriting fees from all
sources during this quarter. So far this year, fees on IPOs
account for nearly half of all money earned from
underwritings in the U.S. market -- up from 36% a year
earlier.</p>
<p>"The types of financing that have driven profitability in
the past have declined notably," says Mark Seigel, a managing
director at Morgan, Stanley & Co. "The outlook for the near
to medium term is mediocre at best."</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the big losers were underwriters of junk
bonds. Disclosed fees from junk-bond underwritings plummeted
to a paltry $10.8 million from a total of just three new
issues. A year earlier, 26 new junk issues earned Wall Street
$151 million in fees.</p>
<p>Of course, February's collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., which virtually created and then dominated the junk
market for much of the 1980s, added to the woes. But few
other firms picked up the slack: In the first quarter, the
only new junk offerings were underwritten by Goldman, Sachs &
Co. (Kroger Co.), Merrill Lynch (Sullivan Graphics) and Dain
Bosworth Inc. (TCF Banking & Savings).</p>
<p>Goldman was the leader in fee income, with $99 million. Of
the 32 issues it underwrote, Goldman's junk offering of
Kroger ($6.3 million in fees) and its IPOs for Readers Digest
Association ($21 million), Teppco Partners L.P. ($17.6
million) and Santa Fe Energy Resources ($9.8 million)
catapulted the firm to the top of the fee heap. Still, it's
been more than four years since the top underwriter based on
disclosed fees earned less than $100 million, Securities Data
said.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch underwrote more issues than Goldman, but
still ended up with less in fee income, earning $86.8
million. Salomon Brothers Inc. jumped to No. 3 from the
eighth spot a year earlier, earning $63.2 million.</p>
<p>But First Boston Corp. slumped badly. The firm, beset by
junk-related troubles and holding some irksome temporary
"bridge" loans, fell to seventh place from No. 3, earning
just $35.4 million on 17 issues. A year earlier, First Boston
underwrote 29 issues, earning $77.7 million in fees.</p>
<p>The last few weeks of the quarter salvaged what could have
been a disastrous period. More than $19 billion of corporate
new issues were sold in the last two weeks of March alone,
hiking 1990 financing volume to $77.7 billion from $73.3
billion in the year-earlier period. Fees from these new
issues in the past two weeks totaled $179.3 million -- or
30.3% of the quarter's total fees.</p>
<p>Mortgage and asset-backed securities continued to
flourish, but they didn't amount to much in disclosed fees
for Wall Street. Such fees totaled just $39.9 million for
securities firms. A year earlier, disclosed fees were $65.3
million.</p>
<p>Issues of other fixed-income debt were more scarce.
Concerned about the specter of higher interest rates,
corporate treasurers in the quarter issued only $25.6 billion
worth of debt securities, including junk bonds, 33% less than
a year earlier and the lowest level since the fall of 1985.
Fees from corporate debt issues slumped to $103.4 million,
from $238.6 million in 1989's first period.</p>
<p>Some industry executives and analysts expect a pattern of
increased common-stock offerings and slower issuance of new
debt to continue over the next several years. After the debt
binge of the '80s, says Alison Deans of Kidder, Peabody &
Co., many companies will be reducing leverage by raising more
equity capital and borrowing less.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the recent heavy layoffs on Wall Street will
help mitigate the impact of currently stunted underwriting
growth, some analysts say. Since the October 1987
stock-market crash, nearly 45,000 securities-industry
employees have been laid off nationwide. Says Michael
Blumstein, an analyst for First Boston Corp.: "At least there
are fewer mouths to feed."</p>
