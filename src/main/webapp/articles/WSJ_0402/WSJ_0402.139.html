	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration said it will keep the fuel economy standard
for 1992-model light trucks and vans at 20.2 miles per
gallon.
   In January, the agency had said it would set the standard
no lower than 20.2 mpg but might increase it to as high as
21. NHTSA administrator Jerry Ralph Curry said the agency
decided to leave the standard unchanged from 1991 models
after considering auto makers' "fuel economy capabilities,
current projections, underlying product plans and possible
technological improvements."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Both Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. praised the
decision to keep the standard at 20.2 mpg. "We had strongly
urged that they set the standard at the low end of the
proposed range and that's what they did," said David L. Kulp,
Ford's manager of fuel economy planning and compliance.</p>
<p>Mr. Kulp said the "the market has been moving in the
direction of full-sized trucks," making it difficult for Ford
to raise its average fuel economy, currently at 20.2 mpg.</p>
<p>Under federal law, the agency must establish fuel economy
standards for light trucks each year. Manufacturers failing
to meet the standards are subject to civil penalties. The
standard for 1990 models is 20 mpg.</p>
<p>The new standard applies to pickup trucks, vans and
utility vehicles with a gross vehicle weight of as much as
8,500 pounds.</p>
