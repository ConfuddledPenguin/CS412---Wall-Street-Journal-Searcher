Philippines dropped 73% to 269.5 million pesos ($11.4
million) in June from one billion pesos a year earlier, the
Securities and Exchange Commission reported.
   The June figures on paid-up foreign equity investments in
domestic and foreign stock companies showed a 64% drop from
739.1 million pesos in May.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The commission noted that investor confidence
significantly waned with the discouraging impact of

the pull-out of Marubeni Corp. from a planned industrial
estate southeast of the capital.</p>
<p>Luzon Petrochemical and its Taiwanese principal, USI Far
East Corp., have been accused of trying to obtain behest
