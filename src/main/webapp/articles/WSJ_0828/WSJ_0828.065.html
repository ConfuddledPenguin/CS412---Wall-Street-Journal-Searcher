	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Even as financial markets are roiled by
Mideast strife and volatile oil prices, U.S. investors
continue to spurn gold.
   Yesterday's steep plunge of $26.70 an ounce in gold to
$388.30 -- the biggest one-day drop in more than seven years
-- is just the latest blow for the gold market that has had
to struggle for its gains since Iraq invaded Kuwait earlier
this month.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales of gold bullion coins in the U.S. -- moribund for
nearly three years -- should be skyrocketing in these times
of uncertainty, dealers and precious-metals analysts say. A
possible Arab war, a sagging dollar and inflation fears are a
combination of perils that seems exactly what used to spur
U.S. investors, at least temporarily, to the "haven" of gold.</p>
<p>So far, though, there has been only a modest increase in
investor interest in gold in the U.S. -- despite the fact
that the stock market, even with yesterday's rally, has
plunged nearly 300 points, or 10%, since Iraq's invasion.
Overseas gold investors, by contrast, have been buying
actively.</p>
<p>Gold prices after yesterday's plunge are just $15 an ounce
above levels before the invasion. And dealers say the sales
activity pales in comparison with levels seen in the weeks
after the 508-point crash of the Dow Jones Industrial Average
in October 1987, when gold rallied briefly to $500 an ounce.</p>
<p>For example, sales of the U.S. Mint's American Eagle gold
coins to distributors, a barometer of individual investors'
interest in gold, have risen to 70,000 ounces so far this
month, nearly double that of August 1989. But that's about
the same as August 1988 -- when gold prices were higher --
and still falls far short of October 1987 (198,000 ounces).
Or even the following November (113,500), to say nothing of
October 1986, the month the Eagle was launched (692,000).</p>
<p>Also, the mint's figures could be overstating the recent
investor interest because they only reflect sales to
authorized distributors. Some of the distributors apparently
have been stocking up, hoping investors will eventually beat
down their doors.</p>
<p>"There's just a lethargic attitude toward investing in
gold," moans Alan Posnick, senior vice president at MTB
Banking Corp., a major precious-metals and foreign-currency
dealer. Adds Fredric Tordella, MTB president: "It's a
wait-and-see attitude."</p>
<p>Gold sales spurted after Iraq stormed into Kuwait, but not
to levels that dealers expected. MTB went so far as to
announce a "Gold Investment Hotline" for the public when the
Mideast crisis flared, to try to stir up interest in precious
metals. Yet jolts such as yesterday's plunge don't exactly
enhance such marketing efforts.</p>
<p>Gold dealers are scratching their heads for answers. Some
say investors are disillusioned by gold's disappointing price
movement in the past decade, when the market pushed ahead and
then consistently fell back. Some say investors increasingly
have swarmed to gold mutual funds in recent years -- not
bullion -- or bypassed gold entirely for foreign-currency
instruments. Still other dealers suggest many investors
aren't expecting a protracted conflict that would trigger a
significant spike in gold prices.</p>
<p>Gold coins are generally bought by longer-term investors,
and these people simply don't yet see a long-term opportunity
here, says Jeffrey Christian, managing director of CPM Group,
precious-metals consultants. "There's always been this
caution that if we avoid war, the price will slam back down.
In that kind of environment, you really wouldn't expect
long-term investors to shoot in. And, by God, they're not."</p>
<p>As much as half of investment demand for bullion usually
is satisfied through coins rather than gold bars. Among
individual investors, coins are the overwhelming choice.</p>
<p>Dealers have seen increased gold-bar demand lately in the
"high end" of the market among institutions and private banks
in Europe. Yet dealers are more interested in coin sales,
because typically if there isn't small-investor reaction to a
market move in gold, the move fizzles.</p>
<p>"Investors are wishing and hoping that this Iraqi thing
goes away," says Bruce Kaplan, president of Kaplan & Co., a
Santa Monica, Calif., firm that advises gold dealers. "They
have lived through a decade of resolved crises and relative
peace; they're thinking this thing is going to be over
tomorrow."</p>
<p>Investors have good reason to be disillusioned with gold's
price movement the past 10 years. After briefly spiking to
$850 an ounce in early 1980, prices have remained depressed
despite a few short-term jumps. In Salomon Brothers Inc.'s
survey of financial and tangible investments, gold ranked 13
out of 14 investments over the past 10 years, with an annual
compound return of minus 4.3%. (Only silver performed poorer,
falling 10.2%.) Stocks, by contrast, jumped 17.3% annually
during the same period, Salomon says.</p>
<p>The muted demand in the U.S. contrasts with the activity
overseas. Donald Mackay-Coghill, chief executive officer of
Gold Corp. of Australia, which sells Australia's legal-tender
gold coins, says European and Southeast Asian investors have
been snapping up bullion coins in recent weeks.</p>
<p>A major reason U.S. investors have shied away, he says, is
that real interest rates -- which are adjusted for inflation
-- aren't narrow enough to justify a stampede just yet. "When
we get negative real interest rates, more people will move
into gold," Mr. Mackay-Coghill predicts.</p>
<p>Small investors haven't been the only ones sitting out
gold's recent rally. Commercial buying by institutions and
other big investors has been poor, Wall Street traders say.</p>
<p>"It's been underwhelming," says Michael Mainzer, a first
vice president and gold trader at Prudential-Bache Metal Co.,
a unit of Prudential Insurance Co. of America. Now, with
gold's recent rally, Mr. Mainzer says, "everyone is afraid
they may have missed their buying opportunity."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some gold specialists question whether gold has
lost its allure as a haven from crises.</p>
<p>"This could be one of the final tests," Mr. Kaplan, the
consultant, says. "If everything plays out -- military
conflict, a declining stock market, inflation -- and gold
stays flat, something materially has changed."</p>
