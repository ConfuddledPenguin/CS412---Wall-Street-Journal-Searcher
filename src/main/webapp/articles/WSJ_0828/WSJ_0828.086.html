	<p class="article-leader">SAN DIEGO -- Telios Pharmaceuticals Inc. said it sold an
equity stake in the closely held drug company and received
"several million dollars" for product research from Ono
Pharmaceutical Co. of Osaka, Japan.
   Under a partnership agreement, Telios sold a 6.5% interest
in the company plus an option that could eventually lift Ono
Pharmaceutical's stake to as much as 13%. Terms weren't
disclosed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ono Pharmaceutical also agreed to pay an undisclosed
amount to fund Telios's research, development and clinical
testing of drugs that inhibit a naturally occurring protein
known as Transforming Growth Factor-Beta (TGF-b) in exchange
for exclusive rights to make and market the drugs in Japan,
Taiwan and South Korea.</p>
<p>"We hope that clinical trials can begin before 1994," a
Telios spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Telios also agreed to give Ono Pharmaceutical the right of
first refusal in those countries to license all but two other
human therapeutical products that Telios might develop.</p>
<p>The agreement comes in the wake of a recent discovery
showing that kidney disease scarring, the leading cause of
chronic kidney failure, can be blocked by neutralizing the
activity of TGF-b. Telios holds the rights to the findings.</p>
