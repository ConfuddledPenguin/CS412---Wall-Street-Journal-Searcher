	<p class="article-leader">Students' weakening verbal skills pulled down scores on
the Scholastic Aptitude Test for the third straight year,
heightening worries about course content and trends in
reading habits.
   Students headed for college this fall achieved an average
combined mathematics and verbal score of 900, down from 903
last year. All of the decline was in the verbal score, which
fell to 424, down three points from last year and tied for
the worst performance ever, recorded in 1980 and 1981. Each
component in the test has a point scale of 200 to 800, for a
combined maximum of 1,600.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Some observers were particularly dismayed because the
decline occurred despite a stable participation rate of about
40% of high school seniors, negating past explanations for
the downward trend.</p>
<p>"We can no longer get away with saying scores are going
down because the number of kids taking the SAT is going up,
reducing the talent pool," said Lynne Cheney, chairman of the
National Endowment for the Humanities. "I suspect the reason
scores are going down is for all the other reasons: textbooks
that are still dumbed-down, teachers who are not as prepared
as they should be and curricula that are not as demanding as
they should be."</p>
<p>The College Board, which sponsors the SAT, attributed the
continuing verbal score decline to an erosion of reading
time. Donald Stewart, president of the New York organization,
said "reading is in danger of becoming a lost art among too
many American students."</p>
<p>The College Board noted that the National Assessment of
Educational Progress, a nationally representative test for
students at three grade levels, concluded earlier this year
that students spend little time reading and writing both in
and out of school. Mr. Stewart said one reason was a
preoccupation with television and video games.</p>
<p>Even some past defenders of schools' performance reacted
soberly to the latest figures.</p>
<p>"Nationally, there's weakness in reading, and it's going
to hurt us down the road," said Bill Honig, California's
school superintendent. "We have to revamp the curriculum
toward more writing, more problem-solving and more
literature."</p>
<p>Mr. Honig has said that school critics aren't seeing the
whole picture in the SAT scores. In California, he says, the
major ethnic groups whose scores are broken out by the
College Board -- whites, blacks, Asians and Hispanics -- all
have shown score improvement of 3% to 4% annually since 1983.
Pulling down the overall average is the higher participation
of blacks and Hispanics, whose scores are much lower than
whites.</p>
<p>The results also yielded a mixed message on new state
education laws in the 1980s. Many of these dictated a higher
graduation standard that included more so-called "academic"
subjects, including mathematics, science, social studies and
English, and fewer vocational electives, physical education
and other courses.</p>
<p>The College Board said that students who took more than 20
high school courses had average scores 50 points higher than
students who took fewer than 20 such courses. But the
proportion of students with 20 or more academic courses
increased to 40% from 39% last year -- and scores still
declined.</p>
<p>Gordon Ensign, supervisor of assessment for schools in
Washington state, said one possible explanation was a decline
in the reading and writing content of courses that some
systems count as academic. He said that high school
journalism and film classes are increasingly counted as
"academic" curriculum, although they make far fewer demands
on students to understand literature.</p>
