	<p class="article-leader">VIENNA -- World petroleum prices crashed even as OPEC oil
ministers were reaching a tentative agreement on a plan
intended to hold prices down for the duration of the Middle
East crisis.
   Early Tuesday in Austria, 10 of the 13 oil ministers of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided
they would endorse plans by three leading OPEC members to
produce a total of as much as three million barrels a day
beyond their current OPEC quotas.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At the same time the ministers were working out that
settlement, oil prices were plummeting as much as $4 a
barrel, largely on the possibility of negotiations in the
standoff in the Persian Gulf. The OPEC talks aimed at
authorizing more oil production added to the selling binge.</p>
<p>In the sharpest one-day decline in the four years of
records kept by the New York Mercantile Exchange, the
benchmark U.S. crude for October delivery plunged $4 a barrel
to $26.91. Brent crude in the spot market for September
delivery tumbled $3.65 a barrel to $27.55.</p>
<p>Gasoline for September delivery also fell sharply, by
17.10 cents a gallon to 87.56 cents. Heating oil for the same
month declined 12.86 cents to 78.10 cents a gallon.</p>
<p>John Lichtblau, chairman of Petroleum Industry Research
Foundation, attributed the price decline to "the realization
that Iraq and the U.S. may try to negotiate their way out of
the crisis rather than go to war with each other."</p>
<p>Despite yesterday's drop, petroleum prices are still 35%
above the level of Aug. 1, the day before the Mideast crisis
began. OPEC has sought in recent years to stabilize oil
prices and markets after a long series of wild price
gyrations. Many OPEC ministers fear a new round of runaway
prices would trigger recessions in the industrialized
economies and ultimately lead to another big loss in their
share of world energy markets.</p>
<p>"I would prefer prices of $21 to $25 a barrel for one
year," said Ginandjar Kartasasmita, Indonesia's oil minister
in an interview last night.</p>
<p>Under the tentative agreement among a majority of OPEC
ministers, Saudi Arabia will be allowed to produce two
million barrels a day more, pushing its total output to 7.4
million barrels a day. Venezuela, which has an OPEC quota of
1.9 million barrels a day, will be cleared to produce as much
as 500,000 a day more -- with most of that attainable within
the next couple of weeks. The United Arab Emirates, which has
a current quota of 1.5 million barrels a day, will be cleared
to go back to its recent rate of two million barrels a day.</p>
<p>The combined extra output from these three will make up
most of the four million barrel shortage created by the
global embargo against Iraqi and Kuwaiti crudes.</p>
<p>It has been clear since early this month that Saudi
Arabia, Venezuela and the United Arab Emirates were prepared
to boost output even if OPEC wouldn't "bless" such a move. In
fact, it is understood the three have already begun pumping
more oil, though Venezuela has claimed it has been storing
its extra output.</p>
<p>But they wanted the full endorsement of OPEC, preferably
via a formal emergency conference. Though chances of that
faded quickly here over the weekend, the tentative agreement
arising from informal talks will satisfy the three nations.</p>
<p>An Indonesian proposal formed the basis of the tentative
agreement. Under it, the three countries -- which have the
bulk of the current extra capacity within OPEC -- would
increase output for the duration of the crisis, with the
understanding the three countries would return to their
quotas when the crisis ends. In exchange, OPEC would call on
oil-consuming nations to dip into their commercial and
government inventories to help make up the rest of the
shortfall and help take care of anticipated rising demand
later this year. Developing countries, hard hit by escalating
oil prices, would receive priority in the distribution of the
added supplies.</p>
<p>Ministers are expected to meet later Tuesday to complete
the agreement. Last night, several said they hoped to get an
11th member, Iran, to go along.</p>
<p>Iran has opposed a production increase at this time, and
yesterday's price drop seemed to help its case. Iran has
argued that world oil supplies still are plentiful despite
the embargo, and that recent price runups reflected
psychological rather than fundamental factors.</p>
<p>"We oppose an increase in production at this time," said a
senior Iran delegate. "We shouldn't decide on this while
there is so much tension" in world oil markets, he said.</p>
<p>The two remaining OPEC members, Iraq and Libya, also
oppose any output boosts. The Iraqi oil minister hasn't
appeared for the talks here; there were some reports that the
Libyan minister might show up Tuesday.</p>
<p>Yesterday's steep price decline "was more abrupt than I
would have imagined," said Tom Burns, manager of economics
for Chevron Corp. But he called the drop an almost inevitable
"clear reaction to the semi-panic buying of the last eight to
10 days which carried prices to above $30 a barrel." The
latest sell-off brings crude down by about $6 a barrel since
Thursday.</p>
<p>Mr. Burns noted that oil inventories are still high. The
threat of war dictates whether those inventories are
considered a valued cushion or simple surplus, he explained.
"Whether the extra barrels are an overhang or not is in the
eye of the beholder," Mr. Burns said. "It's largely
perception."</p>
<p>Despite the sharp price decline and the tentative
agreement to boost OPEC output, oil strategists say prices
won't continue to fall sharply. Many consider $25 to $30 a
barrel realistic -- which still would be far above the prices
in the high teens earlier this year.</p>
<p>"We're not home free yet," said Mr. Lichtblau of the
Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. "The extra pricing
reflecting anticipated warfare may have disappeared. But even
if we make up for much of the Iraqi-Kuwaiti shortfall, the
supply situation going into the winter will be precarious."</p>
