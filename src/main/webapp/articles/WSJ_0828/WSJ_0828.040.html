	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- When Iraqi television began beaming videotape
of a grinning Iraq President Saddam Hussein visiting with
grim British hostages last Thursday -- a meeting the U.S.
State Department condemned as "shameful theatrics" --
executives at NBC News agonized over whether to air the
footage immediately.
   They decided against it. "There was a spirited discussion
and debate around here about airing this propaganda
unedited," says NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw. "The consensus
was we could see all the footage, collect our thoughts and
air it within the hour on a regularly scheduled news digest."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>NBC officials were afraid of being used in the "propaganda
machine" of the Iraqi government, says Steve Friedman,
executive producer of "NBC Nightly News." But some critics
complain that in the first few weeks of the crisis in the
Middle East, the three major broadcast networks and the
24-hour Cable News Network have been less successful in
resisting the propaganda of the U.S. government.</p>
<p>In terms of getting the news and reaching the public,
television has been highly successful in its coverage: Two
weeks ago, the rating for the nightly newscasts for the first
time surpassed that for prime time. For the week of Aug. 13,
the three networks' newscasts drew a combined 59% of the
available audience, according to A.C. Nielsen Co.'s latest
figures, topping a combined 54% of the prime-time audience.</p>
<p>But critics say the broadcast coverage has yet to provide
much of the counterbalance, the usual skepticism that
accompanies such actions as the Bush administration's move to
deploy one of the country's largest buildup of troops and
weapons since World War II.</p>
<p>"Television coverage hasn't been bad, but at the same time
there hasn't been a lot of critical detachment," says Marvin
Kalb, a former correspondent with CBS News and NBC News who
now is a professor at Harvard College. "There is a flavor of
jingoism," he says, that has at times overwhelmed the factual
story.</p>
<p>Ken Bode, a former NBC News political correspondent who
now is director of the Center of Contemporary Media at DePauw
University, says television isn't exhibiting the kind of
skepticism it should.</p>
<p>"If this turns into a war, we're going to look back and
ask ourselves how this got started," says Mr. Bode, who also
is a part-time correspondent for CNN, which is owned by
Turner Broadcasting System Inc. "And what we're going to see
is {there were} lots of network reports quoting joint
newspaper-network polls saying how popular the president is."</p>
<p>It is somehow odd that television -- the medium that
helped turn popular opinion against the war in Vietnam in the
late 1960s and which pointed up the impotence of the Carter
presidency during the Iran hostage crisis in 1979 -- is this
time being criticized for cheerleading as the U.S. risks
heading into a war in the Middle East.</p>
<p>But the Vietnam conflict was a highly unpopular war, and
the polls reflected it. And the Carter presidency was at or
near an all-time low in popularity as the hostage crisis
worsened. This time around, however, President Bush continues
to enjoy broad public support, even as thousands more
soldiers set down in the deserts of Saudi Arabia with each
passing day.</p>
<p>"It's difficult to play devil's advocate, especially
against such a popular president as Bush," says ABC
correspondent Sam Donaldson, who is considered one of the
most aggressive network reporters. But playing devil's
advocate is the press's proper role, he adds. "I was
surprised and dismayed by the jingoistic tone of some of my
colleagues. . . . I don't think the media have been as
skeptical as it could be."</p>
<p>But Ted Koppel, anchor of ABC News's "Nightline," says the
Iraqi situation is a "lengthened" version of "what always
happens when a government agency says something on deadline.
You run with it and play catch-up the next day. During the
first few days, the coverage was unquestioning. But as the
dust settles, journalists are striking out on their own and
bringing back questions that need answering."</p>
<p>One problem the news teams have is that they air only what
people say -- and in the Iraq face-off, even rival
politicians aren't questioning President Bush's policy.
"They've been struck dumb," says Mr. Bode, the former NBC
correspondent. "We need the strength of loyal opposition, and
we're not getting it. It's up to the media to put this in
perspective -- and television isn't doing it."</p>
<p>Moreover, Iraq's unprovoked invasion of Kuwait and its
holding of foreigners as "detainees" brought unified outrage
around the world. That makes it more difficult to cover the
Iraq conflict down the middle.</p>
<p>Indeed, television seems to be having the toughest time
appearing objective when it comes to the hostage issue, the
most inflammatory aspect of the crisis.</p>
<p>On Aug. 21, the "CBS Evening News with Dan Rather" offered
riveting television as Mr. Rather, on his last day of
reporting from the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, interviewed
individuals he described as "hostages . . . a group of
Americans who were forced to seek what they hope will be a
safe haven in U.S. diplomatic housing in Baghdad." The CBS
Inc. anchorman ended the broadcast by staring intently into
the camera and declaring: "Americans in peril."</p>
<p>And over a week ago on "Nightline," Capital Cities/ABC's
TV network correspondents Mr. Koppel and Barbara Walters
grilled the Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations. "All this
nonsense about using euphemisms like detainees and
restrictees is . . . something that belongs in the garbage
can," Mr. Koppel declared on the air. "These people are
hostages, they're being treated like hostages and they're
going to be used as hostages."</p>
<p>Such combative words from the stars of television news
alarm some critics.</p>
<p>"I'm worried the networks are whooping up war fever," says
Tom Shales, television critic for the Washington Post. "The
media has played up the hostage angle because it's easy and
tugs at the heart of America. It's a little scary when
journalists try their hand at diplomacy, like on
`Nightline,'" he adds.</p>
<p>But some network news executives disagree. Don Browne, the
No. 2 executive at General Electric Co.'s NBC News, says the
"overall" television coverage has been "excellent." He
contends the networks haven't dwelled on the hostage story.
"We were pretty restrained until the President used the term
himself," says Mr. Browne. "Then we eased into it."</p>
<p>Whether the networks continue merely to "ease into it,"
however, is another matter, particularly if the Iraqis start
parading Americans before TV cameras.</p>
<p>American TV camera crews and correspondents were allowed
to return to Baghdad this weekend, so viewers can expect more
aggressive coverage on the situation in the region. Even NBC
News and CNN, which had been locked out of the first wave of
visas in the first two weeks of the crisis, were allowed
entry.</p>
<p>Already, "the glow has started to fade" in the networks'
coverage, says Robert S. Lichter, the head of the Center for
Media and Public Affairs in Washington D.C. "Television is
searching for negative stuff on Bush," he adds. Last
Thursday, for instance, reporters could be seen on the air
questioning President Bush about his dedication to energy
conservation given his use of a speedboat for fishing during
his vacation in Kennebunkport, Maine.</p>
<p>Also last Thursday, "NBC Nightly News" aired one of
television's first probing pieces that Mr. Lichter
characterizes as "very strong anti-war." The story focused on
a father whose son, a U.S. Marine, had been ordered to the
Middle East. It was introduced by anchor Tom Brokaw this way:</p>
<p>"So far, President Bush's decision to launch this massive
military operation in the Persian Gulf is solidly backed by
the American public. But as it goes on unresolved, how long
will that support last?"</p>
