	<p class="article-leader">Playboy Enterprises Inc. said it bought back 200,000 of
its nonvoting Class B shares from Industrial Equity (Pacific)
Ltd. for $825,000, or an indicated $4.125 each.
   The Chicago-based publishing and entertainment company had
earlier announced it would repurchase as many as 200,000 of
the nonvoting shares "through open-market purchases and
negotiated purchases." Yesterday, Playboy said its board
authorized the purchase of as many as an additional 200,000
Class B shares, which it said it considers to be
"undervalued."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Playboy created the Class B common as part of a
recapitalization effort designed, in part, to let it issue
new stock without diluting the 71% holding of former Chairman
Hugh Hefner.</p>
