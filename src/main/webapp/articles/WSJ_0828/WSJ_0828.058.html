or cholesterol.
   Steve's Homemade declined to disclose the exact size of

lines of premium ice cream, marketed under the Steve's Super
Premium, Steve's Gourmet Light, and Swensen's brands, and
Heidi's frozen yogurt, said Gary P. Stevens, president of
Steve's Homemade. Steve's Homemade also franchises
restaurants and ice cream shops.</p>
