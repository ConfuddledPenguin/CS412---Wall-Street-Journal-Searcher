	<p class="article-leader">Less M.B.A. Demand
   As '80s Tide Ebbs</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>EAGER corporate climbers are still mobbing business
schools' front doors, but demand at the other end -- for new
M.B.A.s -- looks as though it's slowing.</p>
<p>Several top schools report that recruiting fell off this
past spring, as some companies lowered hiring goals and
strung along prospects longer. As a result, job hunts for
many graduates "were much more stretched out and tougher to
manage," says Jeanne J. Husain, director of placement at the
University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business.</p>
<p>And when decisions did come in, "people tended not to sit
on their offers as long as they had in the past," adds James
J. Beirne of the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School,
where 309 companies came calling this academic year, down
from 335 a year earlier.</p>
<p>The biggest slide occurred among struggling computer
makers; at Carnegie Mellon's business school, Apple Computer
Inc., Data General Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp. canceled
campus interviews this year, while International Business
Machines Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Inc. halved the number of
jobs they offered. "We were just trying to match our
recruiting efforts with what we felt our anticipated needs
would be," says Hewlett-Packard's R. Kemp Bohlen.</p>
<p>The slump in the real estate industry and among Wall
Street investment banks also hurt. Merrill Lynch & Co., for
one, hired 49 new M.B.A.s this spring, down from 62 last
year.</p>
<p>Recruiting activity wasn't down universally. Commercial
banks, consumer-products makers and consulting firms
maintained strong interest in M.B.A.s.</p>
<p>At the University of Rochester's Simon School of Business,
the number of recruiting companies even rose -- to 109 from
101 last year. The school credits tougher application rules
that have boosted the work experience -- and allure -- of its
graduates. But the news isn't all good. Starting pay for
Simon graduates rose just 3.2%, to nearly $44,500, following
a 9.2% jump last year.</p>
<p>Widely Used Test Gets</p>
<p>More Flunking Grades</p>
<p>AFTER BEING used to screen millions of job applicants in
recent decades, a government workplace test is rapidly
falling out of favor.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Labor is proposing suspension of
the General Aptitude Test Battery, which it developed in the
1940s for state and local employment offices. The offices
have used the test to help place people in government and
private jobs, including blue-collar positions with many
Fortune 500 companies.</p>
<p>Criticism of the test began in the 1980s, after the
department implemented a new grading system that effectively
boosted the scores -- and job chances -- of minorities. The
Justice Department challenged that arrangement, charging it
could result in reverse discrimination against whites. Last
year, the National Research Council endorsed the scoring
practice, but questioned the GATB's structure and validity.</p>
<p>At its height five years ago, the exam was taken by nearly
two million people annually in 44 states. Some 35 states were
using it when the suspension was proposed last month, but a
handful have since dropped it and more may follow. Pending a
final decision by year end, the department is planning to
review the exam -- and perhaps overhaul it.</p>
<p>"We're going to mount a vigorous look at what this
instrument is doing in today's labor market," says Robert J.
Litman, deputy director of the department's Employment
Service.</p>
<p>Government job offices have other tests to gauge skills
like typing, but without the GATB they are expected to rely
more on those mainstays of assessment, interviews and
reference checks.</p>
<p>Where the Jobs Are:</p>
<p>At Troubled Firms</p>
<p>AS SAVINGS and loans fail and leveraged buy-outs go sour,
the demand for executives to help run troubled companies is
growing.</p>
<p>This year, says Windle Priem, a recruiter with Korn/Ferry
International, half his searches involve distressed
institutions, mostly banks and thrifts. That's up from 20%
two years ago. But the industry's turmoil is reducing
executives' enthusiasm for moving. As a result, Mr. Priem
adds, troubled organizations are successful only if they
offer prospects a higher-ranked position, a minimum 30%
increase in cash compensation, "three or four times" annual
salary in stock options and an employment contract.</p>
<p>Some look for restless targets, someone "with a troubled
company himself, or one of hundreds of senior staff people"
made redundant by mergers, says J. Gerald Simmons, president
of recruiter Handy Associates.</p>
<p>When recruiting new managers for Western Union Corp.,
which is embroiled in labor disputes and has flirted with a
bankruptcy-law filing, Chairman Robert Ammon sought
risk-takers. "I tended to take people who started their
careers in large companies, but who were also {heads} of
start-ups . . . and maybe had some experiences that got their
noses bloodied a bit."</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>WORDS vs. action: Some 92% of companies consider it
critical to teach employees new skills, but just 23% do that
to "a great or very great extent," finds a survey of 167
companies by the American Society for Training and
Development. . . . The Airmail Envelope, Please: World Trade
Magazine ranks the top North American locales for
international companies. Among surprise winners: Baltimore;
Columbus, Ohio; Huntsville, Ala.; Seattle; Toronto; Tucson,
Ariz.; and Minneapolis-St. Paul.</p>
