	<p class="article-leader">Reid Nagle's recommendation to seize and sell healthy
mutual savings institutions to raise funds for the
savings-and-loan bailout is outrageous, irresponsible,
inaccurate, unconstitutional, unjust and un-American
(editorial page, July 30).
   The depositors of mutual institutions are by definition
"members" of the institution. They have voting rights based
on the value of their accounts (much as stockholders have
voting rights based on the value of their shares) and a
portion of the institution's assets, proportional to the
value of their accounts, belongs to each account holder.
Federal law and regulations provide that all holders of
accounts of a mutual association are entitled to equal
distribution of assets in the event of voluntary or
involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
association. Provisions of state laws provide similar
protection for members of state-chartered associations.
Mutual thrifts, technically and in fact, belong to their
depositors. Mr. Nagle's view that the managers are the only
people who would lose in a government takeover of healthy
mutual thrifts is inaccurate.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>He is advocating the seizure of healthy institutions that
serve their communities well. From 1985 through 1989 the
healthy portion of the thrift industry paid more than $5
billion in increased insurance premiums through a "special
assessment" to support the government's resolution of the
troubled thrifts. Since 1989, they have been paying insurance
rates set by the law that are significantly higher than those
paid by commercial banks. All of this money is being used to
fund the costs associated with resolving the problems of
troubled thrifts.</p>
<p>Disregarding due process and other constitutional
protections, Mr. Nagle proposes that the government seize
private property. Since when has this country advocated the
seizure of private business to finance a government debt?</p>

<p>Mr. Nagle's article bears a strong resemblance to the
Willie Sutton aphorism that he robbed banks because that's
where the money was. Mr. Nagle proposes the theft of property
simply because it is mutually rather than individually held.
He ignores economic realities in suggesting that there is
some gain to the American taxpayer from the confiscation of
mutual savings institutions. And he disregards the needs of
communities that have been well served by mutual savings
institutions.</p>
<p>Next, Mr. Nagle hits us with the fiction of a $10 billion
"windfall" to be realized through the seizure. He ignores the
problem of what exactly is being sold. When a mutual is
"sold" through its conversion to stock, the "buyers" are
actually investors; every dollar of the amount they pay for
the stock stays in the institutions and becomes new capital.
In fact, the conversions of some institutions that took place
in the 1980s were a way of expanding by raising this capital.
But he suggests that there will be buyers for institutions
under a plan in which every dollar paid goes into government
coffers.</p>
<p>State-chartered mutual savings banks, far from being a
"relic of the past," continue to serve local communities
today as they have for more than 175 years. The overwhelming
majority are solvent, successful and crucial to the economic
needs of individuals and businesses in cities and towns
across the country. Rather than destroy these sound
institutions, the industry should learn from them.</p>

<p>Mr. Nagle's illogical scheme to confiscate the reserves of
mutual savings institutions is flawed. No justification
exists for requiring mutual associations to pay for the
problems created by others simply because they operate under
a different corporate structure than stock corporations.
Simply because the U.S. Supreme Court said the depositors in
mutuals were not "technically owners" of the institutions,
for purposes of conversion to stock organizations, doesn't
permit the quantum leap in logic that these companies are
therefore in some sort of ownership limbo. Technical
ownership of a mutual is not the issue.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that Mr. Nagle's business
happens to be converting mutuals to stock organizations. Who
would profit if the government proposed escheatment on
conversion? Oddly enough, Mr. Nagle.</p>

<p>Mr. Nagle suggests that by auctioning off healthy mutuals
and "eliminating" 2,000 savings institutions, $10 billion
could be raised. If 2,000 institutions with an average size
of $225 million are eliminated, his economics break down
rapidly.</p>
<p>With a commensurate average payroll of approximately $2
million per institution, the federal government would lose
(at the 15% tax bracket) $600 million in income-tax revenue
annually. State government would see an approximate $100
million annual shortage. Furthermore, the institutions for
auction, by his own admission, are healthy and therefore
paying corporate income taxes. Based upon industry averages,
we are probably talking at least an additional $200 million
annually. Add to this the lost local real-estate tax revenues
and additional state unemployment-insurance expenses.</p>
<p>More important, the healthy savings institutions pose the
least risk and pay the highest insurance premiums to the
reconstituted FDIC. Mr. Nagle's proposal kills the cash cows
that are paying the most to defray obligations incurred by
the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp./Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp.</p>
<p>The abolition of the local-oriented mutual thrift
institution would be a sad day for communities throughout
this nation, but his disregard for neighborhoods and
communities is evident.</p>

<p>---</p>
<p>Mr. Nagle's conclusions are based on a number of premises
that just ain't so. He believes that depositor members of
federally chartered savings-and-loan associations don't have
property rights in the institution under the Home Owners'
Loan Act. But they do. The case law never has held that
depositors have no property rights.</p>
<p>He further believes that the tangible book value of
solvent mutuals can be obtained for the U.S. government
through some form of "sale," although the potential
purchasers are not described, nor is there a description of
what they would purchase and what, if anything, would remain
behind. This structure ignores the tax consequences of either
the liquidation or the transfer of assets and liabilities of
the S&L. Such a transaction could result in generating
federal tax liabilities at the association level, as well as
to holders of any remaining, distributed net worth of the
institution. Such a transaction generally would prevent or
inhibit the use by the acquirer of any net operating loss
carry forwards, even assuming they otherwise could be used.
The windfall billions wouldn't be billions at all because the
transactions couldn't work the way Mr. Nagle describes them.</p>
<p>He also assumes that 2,000 savings-and-loan institutions
would disappear and there would be fewer federally insured
deposits. How? Does this mean that commercial banks would
pick up all the deposits? That's what's currently occurring
with Resolution Trust Corp. transactions, but would the
acquirers also pick up the mortgages and other assets? If
they didn't, where does this instant money come from? If
commercial banks acquired the deposits, they remain federally
insured, but by a different FDIC fund. The total federal
exposure does not decrease by any relevant amount. If the
article contemplated acquirers purchasing the entire
institutions and operating them as S&Ls, then there aren't
2,000 fewer institutions to be supervised.</p>
<p>At first glance, Mr. Nagle's scheme may appear ingenious,
but the premises used in it don't permit the conclusions he
reaches. Unless quite substantial changes were made in
applicable charter, escheat and tax laws, as well as amending
some relevant provisions of the U.S. Constitution, it can't
work.</p>

<p>---</p>
<p>Mr. Nagle wants those institutions that did almost
everything right to pay for those that did everything wrong
and then to be handed off to "acquirers" in exchange for a
few golden parachutes. He refers to the mutual as a "relic of
the past." If his opportunistic "acquirers" are the symbols
of our industry's future, then I see little hope for the
American consumer in the financial marketplace. I find it
very difficult to consider seriously his solution even
forgetting for the moment that his proposal would pay only 2%
toward the resolutions of the problem while causing a major
disruption of our industry.</p>
<p>I have to believe his outrageous proposal was a bid for
attention and notoriety. Unfortunately, it succeeded.</p>

<p>Mr. Nagle's proposal is something that could happen in a
communist country, but it certainly does not make sense in
America. His concept to just go in and take over 2,000
mutuals with assets of about $450 billion is like robbing a
bank without a gun.</p>
<p>Speaking for one profitable mutual, I had nothing to do
with the S&L bailout. In fact it is not an S&L bailout but a
bailout of the government-sponsored deposit insurance. We
haven't gotten bailed out; we are doing the bailing.</p>
