	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Merrill Lynch & Co. shareholders settled five
lawsuits brought by the holders that involved losses in
trading transactions and certain real estate investments,
according to an attorney for Howard A. Rubin, a former senior
trader of mortgage-backed securities for Merrill Lynch.
   The attorney, George B. Yankwitt, said in a statement that
the holders agreed to have the suits dismissed and that
Merrill Lynch will receive $17,525,000 directly from its
directors' and officers' liability insurers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Yankwitt said three of the suits arose out of an
estimated $250 million loss sustained by Merrill Lynch in
April 1987. In those lawsuits certain Merrill Lynch holders
said a portion of the loss was due to purchases of
mortgage-backed securities by Mr. Rubin and further claimed
that Mr. Rubin's supervisors -- Brian Barefoot, Robert Andres
and Greg Herschell -- had failed to supervise his trading
activities.</p>
<p>The shareholders sought more than $250 million in damages
on behalf of Merrill Lynch. Mr. Rubin has denied engaging in
any unauthorized trades or other wrongful conduct, Mr.
Yankwitt said.</p>
<p>Two of the lawsuits said that directors of Merrill Lynch
violated their fiduciary duties in connection with losses
sustained by Merrill Lynch in other transactions, which
included a lease agreement in the World Financial Center and
a resort development in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Merrill Lynch said that the company
believes all the allegations "except those relating to the
conduct of Howard Rubin" to be "completely without merit."</p>
<p>The attorneys said that the settlement does not require
Mr. Rubin or any of the other individual defendants to pay
any money to Merrill Lynch. The settlement agreement
recognizes that the defendants have denied any liability or
wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Mr. Yankwitt said Merrill Lynch will provide Rubin with a
general release from all potential claims.</p>
