	<p class="article-leader">THE HAGUE -- The Dutch economic affairs minister, J.E.
Andriessen, and the Danish industry minister, A. Lundholt,
said they will propose that the European Community phase out
all forms of shipbuilding subsidies.
   The initiative is timed to coincide with discussions in
Brussels on the seventh directive on aid to the shipbuilding
industry. The current directive expires next Jan. 1.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Andriessen said the firm market in shipbuilding and an
expected long-term upturn in the industry offer a good
opportunity to phase out the subsidies.</p>
