	<p class="article-leader">A federal judge threw out a $148.8 million jury verdict
Liggett Group Inc. won against Brown & Williamson Tobacco
Corp.
   In awarding the treble damages last March, a jury in
Greensboro, N.C., had upheld Liggett's claim that B&W engaged
in predatory price discrimination in the market for
low-priced, generic cigarettes in 1984 and 1985. Liggett
changed its name to Brooke Group Ltd. last month.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But U.S. District Judge Frank W. Bullock Jr. ruled
yesterday in Greensboro that Liggett hadn't proved that B&W's
aggressive pricing policies had damaged competition in
violation of federal antitrust laws. Moreover, he suggested
that companies must meet a stiff burden of proof whenever
they rely on antitrust laws to attack price cutting by
competitors.</p>
<p>"The antitrust laws' goal is to promote consumer welfare,
not to discourage aggressive price competition," Judge
Bullock said.</p>
<p>Liggett said it was "disappointed" with the decision and
believes there are grounds for appeal.</p>
<p>The case stems from Liggett's highly successful strategy
of using volume rebates to sell generic cigarettes in the
early 1980s. By 1984, it was siphoning thousands of smokers
away from other manufacturers and wreaking particular havoc
on B&W. B&W fought back with its own volume rebate plan,
giving rise to Liggett's allegations that B&W engaged in a
predatory pricing campaign designed to "kill" the generic
cigarette category.</p>
<p>The jury agreed that B&W hadn't fought fair, ordering it
to pay Liggett $49.6 million for violations of the
Robinson-Patman Act. The total is automatically tripled under
the law to $148.8 million.</p>
<p>But Judge Bullock said the Robinson-Patman Act bars only
the kind of price discrimination which may "substantially"
lessen competition. In this case, involving a national
market, B&W could only do that if it were in a position to
control prices on a nationwide basis, the judge asserted. And
he concluded that B&W was incapable of exercising such
control.</p>
<p>"With at most 12% of the domestic cigarette market, B&W as
a matter of law could not exercise market power unilaterally
in either the whole cigarette market or the generic segment,"
Judge Bullock ruled.</p>
<p>Nor would the judge accept Liggett's contention that B&W
exercised market control by acting in "tacit collusion" with
other cigarette manufacturers. He said Liggett's own
executives had testified at trial that there wasn't any such
collusion.</p>
<p>In its statement on the decision, Liggett said it was only
one of the victims of B&W's unfair competition, asserting
that the others are "consumers who we still feel have been
and will continue paying higher prices because of B&W's
actions."</p>
<p>But B&W countered by saying the ruling underscores what is
supposed to happen in a free enterprise system. It said in a
statement that its introduction of generic cigarettes created
"more product choice for consumers" and generated "aggressive
price competition" in the industry.</p>
<p>Martin London, an attorney for B&W, called the decision a
"ringing endorsement" of price competition. "It establishes
that companies aren't going to be able to threaten
competitors with antitrust suits merely because those
competitors want to sell at low prices," said Mr. London of
the New York law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &
Garrison. "It says low prices are good, not bad."</p>
<p>On a separate issue in the case, Judge Bullock refused
Liggett's request for a new trial on the question of whether
B&W had infringed Liggett's trademark on design features of
its cigarette packages. The jury had rejected Liggett's
claim.</p>
