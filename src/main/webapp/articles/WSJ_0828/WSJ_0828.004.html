	<p class="article-leader">In uncertain times like these, a lot of stock-market
investors wish they had some sort of security blanket.
   What many of them don't realize is how easily they could
make that wish come true. By using options to hedge
individual stocks or an entire portfolio, they can cushion
the blow of further market drops.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>And days like yesterday and last Friday, when stock prices
rose sharply, are perfect for putting a hedge strategy into
place. Higher prices not only increase the value of an
investor's shares, but they also reduce the cost of
protecting those shares with options.</p>
<p>Stock options give holders the right -- but not the
obligation -- to sell (a put option) or to buy (a call
option) individual stocks or indexes that approximate an
entire portfolio at a fixed "exercise" price for a specified
period. Put options gain in price when the underlying stocks
or indexes decline in value, while call options increase in
price when the underlying stocks or indexes appreciate.</p>
<p>The simplest type of option strategy is to buy put
options. The strategy makes sense for those investors who
"feel good about the companies in which they are invested but
are nervous about the market backdrop," says Bernard
Schaeffer, editor of the Option Advisor, a Cincinnati-based
newsletter. While such investors don't want to sell, he says,
they also don't want to see their portfolios decimated if the
sell-off continues.</p>
<p>Harrison Roth, option strategist for Cowen & Co. in New
York, says that to some extent using put options to hedge a
stock-market investment is similar to buying homeowner's
insurance. "The exercise price can be considered the value of
the policy in case disaster strikes," Mr. Roth says. "The
life of the put, between the date of the put and its
expiration, can be considered the term of the policy. The
amount paid for the put is the premium," he adds.</p>
<p>Investors can purchase individual stock options on more
than 700 stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange,
American Stock Exchange and the over-the-counter market. Each
option protects 100 shares of the stock.</p>
<p>Investors can also buy index put options, which give
holders the right to receive cash depending upon how much the
index on which the option is based has dropped relative to
the option's exercise price. The four most popular indexes
that have options are the Standard & Poor's 100 Index, the
S&P 500 Index, the Major Market Index and the New York Stock
Exchange Index.</p>
<p>Mr. Schaeffer says that he believes investors would be
better off now hedging their portfolios with individual
equity put options rather than index puts. "Index put options
have become extremely expensive in the last couple of weeks,
just as they always do after any major pullback," he says.</p>
<p>Say an investor owns 500 shares of a stock and wants to
protect the entire holding against falling prices. To do so,
the investor could buy five puts with a strike price close to
the current stock price.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, for example, with Digital Equipment
Corp. stock selling for $64.50 a share, an investor could
have bought October 60 put options at 2 1/8, or $212.50 per
100-share option. These puts would reduce the investor's loss
if DEC shares fell below $57.87 (the strike price of the put,
less its cost) before the options expire on Oct. 20. If DEC
shares are at $50 when the put expires, a put owner would
make a profit of $787.50 per October 60 put. That would
offset more than half of the $1,450 loss on 100 unprotected
DEC shares.</p>
<p>Mr. Roth of Cowen & Co. says that buying put options may
be less expensive than it looks. "Frequently, the dividends a
stock pays during the put's life are sufficient to cover the
cost of the put," he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Schaeffer notes that investors could help pay for
individual put options by selling calls with strike prices
above the current price of the stock. If the stock declines
the money received from the call's sale will help pay for the
put purchase.</p>
<p>If the stock rallies an investor who has sold call options
will most likely have the stock called away at a price equal
to the exercise price of the call. But that investor will
also have received the proceeds from the sale of the call,
thus raising the effective sale price.</p>
<p>Using index puts makes protecting an entire portfolio
about as simple as protecting an individual stock. Michael
Schwartz, senior vice president at Oppenheimer & Co. in New
York, says that while index puts have become expensive, it is
still more convenient and probably would involve fewer
commissions to hedge a portfolio with such puts. He says that
this assumes that the value of an investor's portfolio moves
up and down in line with the index on which the option is
based. He adds that index puts shouldn't be used on a
continuing basis because of their cost.</p>
<p>The first step is to figure out how many index puts are
needed. Suppose an investor wants to protect a portfolio with
a current market value of $100,000 with the S&P 100 index
standing at 307.63. The aggregate exercise price of put
options with a strike price of 305 is $30,500, the strike
price times $100. Dividing the value of the portfolio
($100,000) by $30,500 equals 3.27, which can be rounded off
to three options. Recently, a put option that expires in
October with a strike price of 305 cost $1,112.50; the total
gross cost, excluding commissions, for three options was
about $3,337. (Commissions at a discount broker should be
less than 2% of the value of the options.)</p>
<p>If the market declines by 15% from its level yesterday of
307.63 as measured by the S&P 100 index to 261.49, index put
options with a strike price of 305 would have a value of
$4,351 at expiration. An investor who had purchased three of
them would have a profit of $9,717 after deducting their
cost. This would make the value of his hedged portfolio
$94,717 for a 5.3% drop in portfolio value. The unhedged
investor would have lost the full 15%.</p>
