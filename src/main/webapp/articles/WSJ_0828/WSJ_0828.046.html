	<p class="article-leader">CHERRY HILL, N.J. -- Subaru of America Inc. said its
shareholders approved an agreement under which Fuji Heavy
Industries Ltd. of Japan will buy the 50.4% of the auto
distribution company that it doesn't already own in a
transaction valued at about $208 million.
   Under the accord, holders of Subaru, the U.S. distributor
for cars made by Fuji, will receive at least $8.50 a share --
$6 from Fuji and an additional amount equal to at least $2.50
that is expected to come from proceeds of the sale of
Subaru's portfolio of vehicle leases.</p>

years to take complete control of their U.S. distribution
operations.</p>
