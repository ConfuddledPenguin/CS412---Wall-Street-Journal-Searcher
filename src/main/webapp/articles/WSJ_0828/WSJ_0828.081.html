	<p class="article-leader">CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. -- First Chattanooga Financial Corp.
and BMR Financial Group Inc. said they agreed to terminate
BMR's planned $76 million acquisition of First Chattanooga.
   In February, BMR, a bank holding company based in Atlanta,
agreed to acquire First Chattanooga for cash and stock valued
at $27.25 a share. Yesterday, however, the two companies said
that instability in financial markets had made the
transaction less promising and that both companies had agreed
to end their agreement.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In national over-the-counter trading Monday, First
Chattanooga closed at $14.25 a share, down 25 cents. BMR
closed at $6 a share, unchanged.</p>
<p>Separately, First Chattanooga, a thrift holding company,
said its board authorized an increase in the company's stock
repurchase program to $4 million from $1.5 million. First
Chattanooga has about 2.8 million shares outstanding.</p>
