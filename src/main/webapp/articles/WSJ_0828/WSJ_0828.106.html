	<p class="article-leader">ARLINGTON, Va. -- With a slew of monopoly routes and a
fortress hub in Pittsburgh, USAir appeared to have a license
to make money in the 1980s. It didn't do much marketing. It
didn't buy jumbo jets. It didn't offer first class service.
It wouldn't even give customers an extra bag of peanuts.
   While other carriers were mired in red ink, USAir earned a
profit in every year except one following deregulation.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>So confident were the company's executives that they
undertook one of the biggest airline combinations in history
in 1987, acquiring both Pacific Southwest Airlines and
Piedmont Aviation Inc. The two mergers made USAir the
nation's sixth largest airline, and left it with dominant
market shares in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Baltimore, San
Diego, Charlotte, N.C., and Dayton, Ohio.</p>
<p>The mergers, however, also meant that USAir no longer had
things quite so soft. Forced out into the rough-and-tumble
arena of national competition, it suddenly had to worry a
whole lot about the the industry's really tough players.</p>
<p>Moreover, in absorbing two successful carriers into its
system, USAir adopted what it called a "Mirror Image"
strategy of making them do everything exactly its way. In
this, USAir gave up some of the very elements that made the
target airlines successful.</p>
<p>On the West Coast, USAir has been getting clobbered in a
five-way battle with AMR Corp.'s American Airlines, UAL
Corp.'s United Airlines, Delta Air Lines and low-cost
Southwest Airlines. It has had to retreat in a number of West
Coast markets, and many of its Western routes are now
unprofitable. In Philadelphia, USAir is having trouble with
little Midway Airlines and Eastern Airlines. To compete, it
has had to cut fares to below profitable levels. (Overall,
though, the airline says that it is still maintaining its
market share.)</p>
<p>Late last week, USAir announced plans to furlough 3,600 of
its employees, including 500 managers. The layoffs, which
represent about 7% of its work force, are among the largest
ever in the industry. USAir also said it was scaling back its
capacity growth projections to a maximum of 2% next year from
a previously projected 6%. Its stock -- already hurt by the
disclosure of a $113 million deficit in the first six months
-- has plunged from a high of $54.75 last summer to
yesterday's $16.25 close on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>USAir "ran into problems when it began to venture out
beyond its area of natural advantage; now it is really quite
exposed," says Alfred Kahn, former chairman of the old Civil
Aeronautics Board and a pioneer of deregulation. Faced with
intense competition from sophisticated rivals, the airline
"strikes me as being a rather clumsy giant," he adds.</p>
<p>Matters could grow even worse in coming months. That's
because USAir is more vulnerable than other carriers to
rising fuel prices. Its short-hop route system burns up more
fuel because its jets spend less time at cruise altitude.
Half of its 400 jets are more than 10 years old, and these
planes are much less fuel-efficient.</p>
<p>The carrier recently mothballed six of its oldest Boeing
727s and says it may ground as many as 49 older 727s and 737s
in the next 16 months. It also has postponed taking delivery
of 12 new aircraft. A maintenance official says the airline
may try to sell some of its older airplanes. If so, it will
do so in a weak resale market.</p>
<p>USAir also has almost completely missed out on the
high-growth international market where traffic has risen a
healthy 16.9% so far this year, compared to 3% domestically.
While other carriers have been adding overseas flights as
quickly as they can get government approval, USAir has
service only to London and Frankfurt. So it is especially
vulnerable to a U.S. recession.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, pressure is mounting on Edwin I.
Colodny, USAir's reserved, bespectacled chairman, to improve
matters. Mr. Colodny -- who said yesterday that he expects to
retire next year after reaching 65 in June -- is quick to
acknowledge that USAir has had its problems. "There's no way
for me to say that our management didn't make a single
mistake," he says, citing failure to pursue one foreign route
more aggressively. But he also blames the pressures the
entire industry has been under, the heavy discounting in some
markets, and the weakening U.S. economy.</p>
<p>"All of these things have come together," he says. "Growth
has just disappeared." Hence, the cutbacks: "It's prudent for
us to trim back when we don't see the market growing. I can't
promise that 1991 would be profitable. Unless something in
our economy changes dramatically, I can't see that
happening."</p>
<p>USAir has plenty of problems besides the economy.
Government regulators, for example. Justice Department
trust-busters are pressing it for information about its
Pittsburgh operations as part of an investigation into
whether USAir is blocking other airlines from starting
service there. USAir denies any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>The Federal Aviation Administration also is pressing Mr.
Colodny to revise pilot training and crew staffing practices
after USAir Flight 5050 skidded off the runway at New York's
LaGuardia Airport a year ago, killing two passengers. The
flight had paired a new captain with a newly hired co-pilot.
USAir says it has addressed all of the FAA's concerns.</p>
<p>Whether Mr. Colodny's cautious management style is suited
to quick turnarounds may be another question. Given to
micro-managing, the publicity-shy ex-lawyer even chooses the
pictures for the covers of flight schedules. He insists that
senior managers sign off on department expenditures of over
$1,000.</p>
<p>When USAir decided to go to two classes of service on all
routes last year, it moved very cautiously, offering only a
single row of first class seats on many flights. And while
USAir jumped into the merger game in a big way, Mr. Colodny
was one of the last airline chief executives to pursue a
major acquisition. "Basically, he was forced into it," says
an industry official, because other carriers had already
gobbled up their competition.</p>
<p>Some in the industry believe that the company's years of
insulation from major competition gave USAir executives an
inflated opinion of their operating style. This was
particularly damaging when USAir bought PSA and Piedmont.
Rather than learning from the two carriers, it appears, USAir
simply imposed its own way of doing business.</p>
<p>Both PSA and Piedmont had already shown their
profitability and customer appeal. Piedmont, headquartered in
sleepy Winston-Salem, N.C., had attracted a loyal following
with its Southern hospitality and outstanding service. PSA
had wooed West Coast fliers with a playful style that allowed
flight attendants to begin safety briefings with lines like,
"In case you haven't been in an automobile since 1962, this
is a seat belt."</p>
<p>Piedmont had what many in the industry believed was a more
sophisticated ticket pricing system, which balanced full-fare
and discount tickets more profitably. USAir scrapped the
Piedmont system and still uses only its own. "The revenue
differential was astounding" -- and lower -- on many flights,
says one former Piedmont executive.</p>
<p>Mr. Colodny says making practices uniform was necessary to
running the big airline.</p>
<p>His most immediate problem is USAir's unusually high labor
costs, and they too are related to the merger. Labor costs
have climbed to 4.13 cents per available seat mile from 3.57
cents before the merger. Meanwhile, the carrier's yield, or
revenue from ticket sales, dropped to 16.55 cents per
available seat mile in the first half of this year from 17.29
cents in the like period last year.</p>
<p>USAir's labor costs are high because the airline, anxious
to insure labor peace, gave PSA and Piedmont workers hefty
wage hikes after the merger. The move cost USAir an
additional $100 million annually, at least, according to
former Piedmont executives. Some customer service agents who
earned about $14,000 at Piedmont now earn at least $20,000 at
USAir.</p>
<p>With mechanics and flight attendants in contract
negotiations, Mr. Colodny has a chance of tackling the
problem soon. USAir may have to revert to using Piedmont's
more flexible work rules. At Piedmont, customer service
agents earning about $6.75 an hour also worked on the tarmac,
directing aircraft in and out of their gates. At USAir, a
mechanic earning a minimum of $18 an hour performs this job.
USAir had to hire an additional 400 mechanics to service the
same number of Piedmont flights because of this rule.</p>
<p>Mr. Colodny may also have to ask USAir employees for
greater flexibility. At Piedmont, many employees were
crosstrained so that gate agents could load bags when
necessary. Moreover, USAir flight attendants, on average,
work two to three fewer days a month than Piedmont's did, for
much higher wages.</p>
<p>USAir's labor costs are high even when compared with the
rest of the industry. At United, entry-level aircraft
cleaners earn $6.83 an hour; the job pays $10.94 an hour at
USAir. Getting the unions on board promises to be a big
challenge, but Mr. Colodny is optimistic. "We expect to
achieve some changes," he said. "We certainly hope to improve
our labor costs."</p>
<p>Industry analysts say USAir will also have to become more
sensitive to marketing trends and customer preferences. When
USAir cut the old Piedmont practice of serving passengers
whole cans of soda, instead of just a cupful, Piedmont
frequent fliers put their foot down. Cost-cutting was one
thing, but this was downright stingy, they wrote to the
Charlotte Observer. Chastened, USAir started handing out the
cans again.</p>
<p>Passengers on Piedmont had also come to love the baskets
of granola bars, cookies and crackers handed around in first
class and the snacks served on flights of less than two
hours. When USAir cut that admittedly minor service,
complaints again flowed in. Back came the baskets, but minus
the expensive cookies.</p>
<p>USAir's experience with PSA also taught it that hewing to
a not-invented-here philosophy can cost you in the end. PSA
used to hand out cold snacks -- a quick and easy service --
on its short-haul California routes. USAir changed those to
hot meals. But, encumbered by trays and the need to heat
meals, flight attendants couldn't keep up with the short-haul
schedule. Several flights wound up circling airports while
the crew frantically tried to collect trays and stow away
carts.</p>
<p>So USAir is back to cold snacks on those flights. It
still, however, hasn't reinstituted PSA's practice of letting
passengers buy tickets on board or in coupon books. And gone
now are the smiling faces PSA had painted on the nose of its
planes. George Shortley, PSA's former chief financial
officer, says that was a big marketing mistake. "That was one
of the most recognized trademarks in California," he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Colodny says USAir had to take the smile off because
it wanted all the planes to look alike. "It's very difficult
to have a smile on everywhere," he says.</p>
<p>USAir has also been wrestling with its on-time performance
and its baggage service. It chalked up one of the worst
records in the industry most of last year and part of this
year. Part of the problem stemmed from having to integrate
employees of all three carriers -- a daunting task, as other
merged airlines have also discovered. USAir now operates 17
bases from which crews are drawn -- over twice as many as
industry leader United.</p>
<p>The complexity of that structure was quickly apparent. In
the early months of the merger, it wasn't unusual for pilots
to show up for a flight, only to find they were scheduled on
a plane they weren't certified to fly.</p>
<p>USAir says it has worked out its crew scheduling problems.
Its on-time performance has also improved. It was fifth best
in the industry in June, the last month for which statistics
are available. However, in some cases, USAir simply added
minutes to the scheduled arrival time. The flight that used
to be scheduled to leave New York's LaGuardia at 6:10 p.m.
and reach Charlotte at 7:58 p.m., for example, is now
scheduled to leave at 6:15 but arrive at 8:15. USAir says it
revised schedules to make them "more realistic."</p>
<p>In the end, USAir, now that it has joined the big leagues,
is wrestling with many of the same problems plaguing other
major airlines: how to keep service good and meet customer
demands while holding costs down. But in Mr. Colodny's mind,
critics who say the company just isn't used to competing are
wrong: USAir has had to fight for market share in the past.
And while he says he's disappointed by the company's recent
performance, he suggests that some of the criticism of late
hasn't been all that fair. "It's easy to criticize when
you're not making money," he says.</p>
<p>After 33 years with the company, Mr. Colodny now faces
some of his biggest tests -- in his last year. His
announcement that he plans to retire in 1991 (a firm date
hasn't been set) lays to rest widespread speculation that he
might stay on. But whether he will be able to see the
beginning of a turnaround at USAir by then is uncertain. In
an interview, even Mr. Colodny seems doubtful. "It would be
better to have a happy ending" to his career, he says.</p>
