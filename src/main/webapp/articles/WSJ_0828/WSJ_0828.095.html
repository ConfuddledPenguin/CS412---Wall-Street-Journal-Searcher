	<p class="article-leader">"Only the disintegration of the Soviet empire's army into
independent republican defense forces can avert civil war,"
says Hryhoriy Prychodko, a 53-year-old Ukranian Nationalist,
Mr. Prychodko's comments, made while on a visit to the U.S.,
may strike some as alarmist. But this former political
prisoner is suggesting that in the face of deepening
divisions in Moscow, only governments in the Soviet Union's
national republics are now capable of exerting reliable
control over the military and preventing strife.
   There are signs Mr. Prychodko may be on to something. As
Mikhail Gorbachev grapples with economic decline and rising
social unrest, growing splits within a once cohesive Soviet
military complicate his task. More and more of the Soviet
Union's national republics are indicating their opposition to
the maintenance of empire by force and are seeking to restore
the military and militia to their control. Within the
military itself, ideological conflicts are growing between
reformist-oriented younger officers and reactionaries eager
to protect the military budget and defend at all costs the
unity of the "union of fraternal peoples."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>July 30, the Ukraine's Supreme Soviet took another step
along the road to disunity when it demanded that the Soviet
Defense Ministry recall Ukrainian soldiers policing Armenia,
Azerbaijan, Kirgizia and Lithuania. The action by Ukrainian
lawmakers was prompted by a July 25 presidential decree that
implied Mr. Gorbachev may soon use force to stop armed
nationalist groups challenging Moscow's rule.</p>
<p>The growing numbers of small private militias, such as the
Armenian National Army, reflect the increasingly fragile
state of military unity. Last year, 6,500 young men failed to
appear for military duty, most of them from the Baltic
states, where pro-independence forces encouraged resistance
to the "army of occupation." In this summer's military
call-up, astonishing levels of draft-dodging are a barometer
of growing national discontent: In Armenia, only 7.5% of the
recruits have turned up; in Georgia, 27.5%; in Lithuania,
33%; in Estonia, 40%; and in Latvia, 54%. In the Central
Asian republics of Uzbekistan and Kirgizia more than 10% of
the draftees failed to appear.</p>
<p>Soviet draftees, particularly non-Russians, are being
affected by the national reawakening of their republics. Many
have been active in patriotic demonstrations, general strikes
and informal youth organizations. This radicalization creates
conflicts with ethnic Russian recruits and has led to the
mistreatment and even murder of thousands of soldiers from
Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Central
Asia in the past year.</p>
<p>Boris Yeltsin, too, has emerged as a popular figure
capable of fragmenting the army. The president of the Russian
Federation is a strong advocate of radical military reform,
the depoliticization of the army and the general staff, the
removal of Communist Party cells from the military, and the
improvement of living conditions and wages for military
personnel. Mr. Yeltsin's bread-and-butter populism is certain
to win approval from poorly paid noncommissioned officers and
recruits; while his appeal to professionalism finds resonance
within the officer corps. In late June, Mr. Yeltsin took his
case directly to the young officers when he addressed the
graduation ceremonies of the military academies.</p>
<p>As Oleg Rumyantsev, a young associate of Mr. Yeltsin's who
recently traveled in the U.S., put it: "With time, it will be
Yeltsin who has control of the finger on the trigger." Mr.
Yeltsin's popularity suggests that it is not only the forces
of nationalism that are winning the hearts and minds of
draftees and enlisted men. Political groups are tugging at
the loyalty of officers and recruits. A radical officers
group, the Shield, openly backs reformist critics of Mr.
Gorbachev and echoes the programs of such independent groups
as the Democratic Russia bloc, the Democratic Platform, and
the Inter-Regional Group of U.S.S.R. People's Deputies, by
calling for an end to Communist control of the military.</p>
<p>Although soldiers swear an oath of allegiance to the
Soviet Union, Soviet doctrine also teaches that the Soviet
Union is a voluntary union of sovereign republics. Now, as
republics shed rigid party control and proclaim the primacy
of their laws over those of the Soviet Union, and as newly
elected republic parliaments issue calls for the return of
conscripts to their native lands, Soviet soldiers will face
further pressures on their loyalty.</p>
<p>Some see in these trends the signs of a dangerous anarchy.
Yet, the drastic decline in the once-iron discipline of the
Soviet military can also work to build stability in the
Soviet Union. Indeed, one sign of this is Mr. Gorbachev's
decision to back off from his July 25 decree. If
democratically accountable republics eventually control the
deployment of troops and move to eradicate nuclear weapons
from their territories, the Soviet Union and the world can
become a safer place.</p>
<p>The dissolution of a unitary imperial state need not lead
to Balkanization. In most of the national republics,
patriotic pro-independence movements are led by moderate
democratic leaders, committed to inter-group dialogue and
peaceful negotiations. Characteristic of such views are the
recent declarations of the Ukrainian and Byelorussian
parliaments that they seek to become neutral states and
intend to ban the production and deployment of nuclear
weapons on their territories.</p>
<p>In fact, it is not the appearance of a multiplicity of
political groups that has politicized the Soviet military. It
is rather the continued presence of the Communist Party's
retrograde political apparat within the military.</p>
<p>In this context, the greatest danger is of a backlash from
the most reactionary, proimperial segments of the military
establishment. Such reactionary forces can win support from
personnel alarmed at announced cuts in the defense budget and
disgruntled over housing difficulties affecting some 200,000
officers and their families. The new head of the military's
Main Political Administration, Gen. Nikolai Shlyaga, has
sounded reactionary warnings against subversion of the
military and has asserted that "the only real political
force, the most massive and organized, which enjoys absolute
authority in the army is the Communist Party."</p>
<p>Another army leader, Gen. Boris Gromov -- who commanded
the Soviet forces in Afghanistan and is regarded by some as a
potential Bonaparte -- complained last December about
"slanderous attacks" in the Soviet media on the armed forces.
And in February, at a mass rally attended by large numbers of
military personnel, the reactionary political activist Nina
Andreyeva was lustily applauded when, after inveighing
against the threat of counterrevolution in Russia, she
shouted: "Hail to the unconquerable unity of the Soviet army
and the people] Motherland or death]"</p>
<p>A move by the army to repress dissent could of course
bring unpredictable results. Any inclination on the part of
Soviet authorities to apply martial law over large parts of
the Soviet Union could backfire, as well as set back any
prospects for the fundamental reform of the Soviet economy
and society. Mr. Prychodko, who heads a coalition of small,
radical Ukrainian nationalist parties, agrees. "In the
context of the growing Gorbachev-Yeltsin split," he argues,
"it is practically impossible to bring about martial law."</p>
