	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Hopes for peace in the Persian Gulf lifted the
depressed yen yesterday.
   The dollar fell 2.45 yen from Friday, or 1.7%, to 144.25
yen late yesterday in New York, its lowest value against its
Japanese counterpart since it closed at 142.98 yen on Jan.
29.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The dollar also set a record low against the mark in early
European trading, though it recovered slightly to a late
quote in New York of 1.5510 marks, compared with 1.5605 marks
late Friday.</p>
<p>In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar was quoted
at 143.35 yen, down from 144.80 yen at the close there
Monday. Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at about 1.5455
marks, up from Monday's Tokyo close of 1.5450 marks.</p>
<p>Dealers explained the yen's climb simply: The Japanese
currency lost the most from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, so it
had the most to recover from the slightest prospect of peace.
The yen has regained much of the ground it ceded to European
currencies since the Aug. 2 Iraqi attack.</p>
<p>The mark, pound and Swiss franc declined to 93.005 yen,
280.39 yen and 113.182 yen, respectively, from 94.008 yen,
284.67 yen and 115.466 yen.</p>
<p>The yen's correction was the foreign-exchange market's
version of the leveling that took place in other markets
around the world yesterday.</p>
<p>Tokyo and New York stock prices climbed 4% and 3.1%,
respectively, after declining steeply the past few weeks.
Conversely, recent gainers lost ground. On the New York
Mercantile Exchange, the benchmark crude-oil futures contract
lost $4 a barrel to $26.91 a barrel. On the Commodity
Exchange in New York, the gold price fell steeply.</p>
<p>Price movements, especially in currencies, were
exaggerated by the absence of London and Hong Kong traders,
who observed a bank holiday. London is the world's largest
foreign-exchange center.</p>
<p>Foreign-exchange dealers had bid the dollar higher toward
the end of New York trading Friday, expecting a weekend war
over the U.S.'s and other nations' determination to keep open
their embassies in Kuwait despite threats by the Iraqi
occupiers.</p>
<p>The embassies remained open, and nothing happened. Several
U.S. diplomatic dependents held in Baghdad were even allowed
to leave Iraq.</p>
<p>With U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
scheduled to meet with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
Thursday, many currency investors began to take advantage of
the four-day window to liquidate "crisis positions"
accumulated over the past few weeks, said John Lyman, a
senior corporate dealer in New York with Bank of Tokyo.</p>
<p>While in many ways the trend of trading changed yesterday,
the underlying nervousness remained. "People have a tendency
to take profits when they're uncertain," said Dan Brooks,
chief New York dealer for Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank.</p>
<p>Those worries, along with the lower oil price, encouraged
dealers to sell previously bought petrocurrencies, such as
sterling and the Canadian dollar, and buy previously sold
"petrodependent currencies," such as the yen, Mr. Lyman said.</p>
<p>However, sterling was supported by Britain's high interest
rates and closed higher in New York, at $1.9438 compared with
$1.9405 late Friday.</p>
<p>The Canadian dollar dropped to 87.44 cents in New York
late yesterday from 88.11 cents Friday. At its recent peak on
Thursday, the Canadian unit traded at 88.55 cents, a 12-year
high.</p>
<p>An unexpected volley of selling by the Reserve Bank of
Australia toppled the Australian dollar in early Asian
trading, but the currency recovered later, closing in New
York at 82.88 cents, still below 83.05 cents late Friday.</p>
<p>Sydney dealers said the central bank sold the Australian
dollar when it was quoted around 83.20 cents. The Reserve
Bank was said to have chased the currency down to 82.60 cents
in two bouts of selling. A Reserve Bank spokesman said the
central bank doesn't comment on intervention in
foreign-exchange markets.</p>
<p>Without the participation of London banks, trading was
thin in Europe. In addition to its record low set at the
start of European trading, the dollar also posted a record
low Frankfurt foreign-exchange fixing of 1.5411 marks. That
was down from 1.5555 marks at Friday's official pricing and
from the previous fixing low of 1.5432 marks Thursday.</p>
<p>The dollar dropped in active Asian trading, finishing at
144.80 yen in Tokyo, well below its Friday close of 145.70
yen.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery plunged $26.70 to settle at $388.30 an ounce. This
was the lowest close since Aug. 9 and the biggest drop since
Feb. 28, 1983, when it fell $42.50. Estimated volume was a
heavy seven million ounces.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted at $392 an ounce.</p>
