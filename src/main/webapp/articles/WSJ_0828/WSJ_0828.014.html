	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Americans spent money at a fairly healthy
rate in July, the Commerce Department reported, but many
analysts believe subsequent jitters over the economy and
spiraling oil prices will fetter purchases in the months to
come.
   Personal spending grew 0.5% in the month before Iraq
invaded Kuwait, to a $3.667 trillion annual rate, the
department said. The increase came on top of a 1% jump in
spending in June.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At the same time, Americans' incomes increased 0.6%, to an
annual rate of $4.672 trillion, following gains of 0.5% in
June and 0.4% in May. Wages and salaries, the bulk of most
people's income, grew 0.6%.</p>
<p>"There was no recession in these numbers," said Allen
Sinai, chief economist at Boston Co., in New York. "But I do
think it's the last hurrah for consumers." Higher oil prices
generated by the Middle East crisis will squeeze Americans'
discretionary income, he predicted. At the same time, growing
concern about job security could lead consumers to pinch
spending further, analysts said.</p>
<p>Already, said Joseph Carson, senior economist at Chemical
Bank in New York, "We're hearing reports from major retailers
that they're starting to see a pronounced slowdown in
buying."</p>
<p>Consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of
the nation's economic activity, has been quite weak for much
of this year. But in June and July it picked up a bit,
reports show. Most of the growth has been in spending on
services; earlier this month the Commerce Department reported
that retail sales of goods edged up only 0.1% in July
following a 1.1% advance in June.</p>
<p>Most economists believe the gains are now immaterial in
light of the Middle East crisis.</p>
<p>After adjusting for inflation, personal spending still
grew 0.2% in July following a 0.6% gain in June and a 0.1%
dip in May. Spending on services and durable goods --
big-ticket items such as home appliances, expected to last at
least three years -- grew both before and after inflation.
But spending on nondurable goods dropped in both cases,
surprising some analysts.</p>
<p>Generally, durable goods are the first to drop from
consumers' shopping lists during uncertain times because they
are costly and often must be financed. But purchases of
nondurable goods, which include staples such as food and
clothing, tend to hold steadier.</p>
<p>According to the report disposable income -- income after
taxes and other payments to the government -- grew 0.5% in
July, after rising 0.6% in June and 0.3% in May. After
adjusting for inflation, disposable income increased 0.3% in
July, following a gain of 0.2% in June and no change in May.</p>
<p>Americans saved 4.9% of their disposable income in July,
the same rate as June.</p>
<p>All the numbers were adjusted for normal seasonal
variations.</p>
