	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Whittaker Corp. said it may spin off to
shareholders its biotechnology unit, which will contribute
about 17% of Whittaker's expected $190 million sales for the
current fiscal year.
   A Whittaker spokesman said a decision hadn't yet been
reached but said "chances are we'll do it," probably early
next year. The company's directors and secured lenders would
have to approve the transaction, however. It would also have
to be structured on a tax-free basis, Whittaker said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The unit makes and sells diagnostic tests used by doctors
and hospitals and laboratory cell-culture media.</p>
<p>Whittaker also posted results for its third quarter, ended
July 31. In the period, the concern had net income of $4
million, or 47 cents a share, compared with $5 million, or 62
cents a share. Year-earlier net included a loss from
continuing operations of $3.2 million and a gain of $5.5
million on the disposal of discontinued operations. Sales
rose 7.1% to $48 million from $44.8 million.</p>
<p>Whittaker has sold several businesses in the past year as
part of a recapitalization plan. Whittaker's continuing
operations, besides the biotechnology unit, are in aerospace.</p>
<p>For its first nine months, an $85.2 million gain on the
disposal of discontinued operations more than offset a
$363,000 loss from continuing operations. Net was $80.7
million, or $9.61 a share, compared with $22.4 million, or
$3.03 a share.</p>
<p>Marcus Schloss & Co., a New York investment firm, also
disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission that it boosted its stake in Whittaker to 7.6% for
investment purposes.</p>
