	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo's Nikkei index posted a strong gain on low volume
Monday, deferring at least for one day worries about the
Middle East crisis, traders said.
   Prices were higher on most other world stock exchanges.
London and Hong Kong markets were closed for holidays.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Amid an absence of hard news of fighting in the Gulf over
the weekend and Monday, a firmer yen and better bond market
provided the justification for buying at Tokyo, which was
driven by the "Big Four" brokerage firms and by major foreign
house program trading, traders said.</p>
<p>The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues was up 976 points
at 25141.76. The index rose 428.13 points Friday.</p>
<p>In Tokyo Tuesday, the Nikkei index surged 518.52 points to
close the morning session at 25660.28.</p>
<p>Observers cautioned that the rise may be short term,
however, adding that any outbreak of fighting in the Middle
East would spur "Round Two" of the Tokyo Stock Exchange's
unwinding.</p>
<p>Volume on the first section was estimated at 330 million
shares, off from 546.1 million Friday.</p>
<p>Winners outpaced losers, 827 to 163, while 86 issues
remained unchanged.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index (Topix) of all issues listed
in the first section, which rose 16.47 points Friday, jumped
58.87 points, or 3.19%, to 1904.59.</p>
<p>The second section index, which lost 79.41 points Friday,
gained 49.05 points, or 1.40%, to close at 3603.79. Volume in
the second section totaled seven million shares, down from
10.3 million Friday.</p>
<p>"The market's taking some reassurance from the impression
that there's no war to be fought (in the Middle East), at
least not for today," one Big Four trader said.</p>
<p>"It's just a technical bounce," another participant said.
"The market has realized that it oversold on the news" over
the past three weeks since Iraq invaded Kuwait.</p>
<p>The dollar was sold off from early morning as a result of
there being no actual fighting in the Gulf, leaving the yen
to appreciate and Japanese government bond prices to improve
markedly, traders said.</p>
<p>Foreign brokerage houses moved in, buying from 1,000
shares to 15,000 shares apiece on the Nikkei index issues
from early morning.</p>
<p>Although many traders had predicted a much more modest
gain for the Nikkei Monday, buying by the Big Four firms
fueled strong gains in the index, particularly during the
last 30 minutes of trading.</p>
<p>Nomura, Yamaichi, Daiwa and Nikko Securities combined made
up about half of the day's volume, according to one Big Four
trader.</p>
<p>Opinions varied on factors behind the buying by the top
four Japanese firms, but one trader noted the easing of "the
30% rule" in particular.</p>
<p>Thursday, the firms were made aware that the 30% rule --
known as administrative guidance from the Ministry of Finance
saying that no firm can trade more than 30% of any particular
issue, in order to prevent stock-price manipulation -- had
been temporarily abandoned, the trader said.</p>
<p>In other words, traders said, the Finance Ministry, which
only arbitrarily supervises the 30% rule to begin with,
indicated that it would view the firms' actions with a broad
mind. On the other hand, if the freedom is abused, the
ministry probably will reverse course, traders added.</p>
<p>The ministry's move came at the same time that the Tokyo
Stock Exchange Thursday decided to make trading changes,
particularly on futures and options trading, in order to try
to curb arbitrage activity. Arbitrage selling has been
singled out as a major contributor to the market's repeated
plunges, although arbitrage buying hasn't yet been cited for
contributing to recoveries.</p>
<p>The buying by the Big Four Monday ignited broad-based
buying throughout the day, including arbitrage buying all day
and straight index buying on futures in the afternoon,
traders said.</p>
<p>Talk in the market was that Nomura Securities, which just
switched its head office into a new building, was receiving
congratulatory orders for its new trading floor and has
started up a promotion campaign, initiating renewed buying.
Other talk was that new investment trust funds were being set
up to enter the market.</p>
<p>As Nomura has been a heavy seller over the past few weeks
since the Iraqi invasion, its cash position is now much
higher, traders suggested.</p>
<p>Blue-chip stocks led the rally Monday, with Sony rising
260 yen ($1.78) to 7,360 yen, TDK up 200 to 6,060 and Kyocera
up 400 to 7,600.</p>
<p>Hitachi rose 70 to 1,380, while Pioneer gained 250 to
5,200.</p>
<p>Construction stocks were also higher, with Taisei Corp. up
51 to 1,030 and Kajima gaining 60 to 1,450.</p>
<p>Real estate shares such as Mitsui Real, up 70 to 1,410,
and Mitsubishi Estate, up 70 to 1,330, also benefited from
the rebound.</p>
<p>Shipbuilders, steel makers and financial shares also rose.
IHI was up 30 to 740, Mitsubishi Heavy rose 25 to 814,
Kawasaki Steel gained 10 to 490, NKK rose 13 to 506 and
Nomura Securities gained 160 to 1,770.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, stocks closed higher in Paris, Frankfurt,
Milan, Zurich, Amsterdam, Brussels, Madrid and Stockholm.
South African gold stocks closed lower.</p>
<p>Share prices closed higher in Sydney, Wellington, Manila,
Taipei, Seoul and Singapore.</p>
