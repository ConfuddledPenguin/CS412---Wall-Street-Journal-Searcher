	<p class="article-leader">ZURICH, Switzerland -- As tensions mounted in the Persian
Gulf and gold prices gyrated, dealers at the Swiss branch of
the Soviet Union's Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs here
were taking a hard line.
   "You want a discount? No way," Vladimir N. Goriounov barks
into the phone. "We deal at the market. Trading with us is
like trading with any other bank." Lighting another Marlboro,
the chain-smoking, 42-year-old veteran of the war in
Afghanistan observes, "Everyone wants a bargain."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>They should look elsewhere. The Zurich branch of Moscow's
Vnesheconombank doesn't offer cut-rate centrally planned
deals, or Communist ineptitude, either. The branch, one of
the Soviet Union's most important financial footholds in the
West, operates much like a Western commercial bank, offering
a range of services from trade finance to interest-rate
swaps.</p>
<p>The Zurich branch's most significant activity is
overseeing as much as a third of the Soviet Union's official
gold sales, which analysts estimate at nearly $4 billion
annually. The Zurich branch also raises much-needed foreign
exchange through its trading and financing operations in the
international capital markets. "The Russians are very savvy
gold traders with a reputation for smarts," Jeffrey Nichols,
president of American Precious Metals Advisors Inc. in
Toronto, said.</p>
<p>As one of Mother Russia's few windows on world capital
markets, the Zurich branch is the linchpin of Moscow's effort
to become a bigger player in those markets. There may be
bickering back in Moscow about the pace of economic reform,
but the Soviets in Zurich have no doubts. Their central plan
is to make money.</p>
<p>"We run things on a profit basis," says Mr. Goriounov, the
branch's managing director. "It's perfectly normal, just like
Chase Manhattan or Citicorp." Chief dealer Andrei V.
Schjogolev, known by his anglicized name Andrew, said: "We
speculate. We buy low. We sell high. And we take a profit.
This is what everyone does in the international market."</p>
<p>Indeed, the Soviets say playing by free-market rules is
vital if the U.S.S.R. is to assume a more active role in
world markets. The eight Soviets who run the 90-member office
here blend in with their Swiss colleagues; they wear
expensive European suits, drive Mercedes cars and favor
weekend cross-country skiing. The office language is English,
though most of the Soviets speak German. And because the
bankers are paid Swiss-level salaries, they are some of the
Soviet Union's highest-paid workers.</p>
<p>From their office just off the Bahnhofstrasse, Zurich's
Wall Street, the Soviets manage assets of four billion Swiss
francs ($3.18 billion). Mr. Goriounov says 60% of the bank's
activity is export finance; the rest is spread among gold
dealing, securities trading and sovereign lending.</p>
<p>Zurich isn't Moscow's only financial outpost; it has banks
or representative offices in 15 countries, including the U.S.
and Britain. All provide a range of trading services, and all
have Soviet trainees who learn Western financial practices.
This elite returns to Moscow after a year or so to train
others.</p>
<p>But the Zurich branch is Moscow's primary gold dealer in
the West. And because the Soviet Union is the world's
second-largest gold power after South Africa, wildly gyrating
gold prices this year have put the spotlight on the Zurich
branch. Soviet bankers say the government sharply increased
the volume of gold sales earlier this year. Market
specialists believe the Soviets shipped as much as 300 tons
in the first five months, roughly the total for the previous
year. Many analysts believe the Soviets were tapping gold
reserves for cash to pay Western trading partners, who were
complaining about multimillion-dollar payment delays.</p>
<p>In recent months, the sales have slowed, the Soviets said.
And the traders here seem cautiously bullish about gold
prices. They believe events in the Persian Gulf will drive
prices higher.</p>
<p>Western bankers say the Soviets' gold strategy illustrates
how the Zurich branch and Vnesheconombank's Moscow
headquarters are showing increasing sophistication.
Innovative techniques are saving money and supporting the
price of gold.</p>
<p>Bankers say the bulk of the Soviet gold transfers this
year were so-called gold swaps, in which the Soviets sell
gold to a Western counterpart, on condition that Moscow can
buy it back at a fixed price, sometimes as much as a year and
a half later. This gives the Soviets immediate access to
Western currencies, as well as the option to buy back the
gold.</p>
<p>The Soviets haven't always been so sophisticated. They
opened a banking operation here in 1966, mostly to sell gold
and trade foreign currencies. Assignments were handed out as
patronage plums for the party faithful, and the Soviets had
trouble being taken seriously. Some of their habits didn't
help, such as inviting Swiss traders for afternoon
vodka-drinking marathons, where the straight-arrow Swiss were
pressed for inside information.</p>
<p>When gold prices rose sharply in the 1970s, the Soviets
became bolder. This led to their biggest setback in the
Western financial markets: the 1985 collapse of their Zurich
bank, Wozchod Handelsbank, following large
speculative-trading losses.</p>
<p>Moscow shut the bank. It was re-opened as a branch more
tightly under Vnesheconombank control and began to upgrade
the caliber of its employees. "When they started, they had a
lot to learn, and they have learned it," a Swiss trader said.
"Nowadays, they are as sophisticated and professional as
anyone."</p>
<p>The Zurich branch differs from Western commercial banks in
that it is part of a state-owned bank and is used as an
instrument of government policy. The Zurich branch must buy
gold when the government wants to sell. But the Soviet
bankers don't have to turn around and resell the gold
immediately. They can wait if they believe prices will
improve. (The gold sales may be clouded somewhat by the
Russian republic's recent declaration of sovereignty;
republic officials say that because much of the gold comes
from Russia, the republic should at least be consulted on its
sale. The central authorities have declared the republic's
claim invalid, but the issue remains murky.)</p>
<p>But such debates are moot amid the hustle and bustle of
Vnesheconombank's Zurich gold trading room. "Woooooo. Things
are getting hectic," Mr. Schjogolev, the chief dealer, cries
on one recent day as his trading screen flashes green and red
with news from the Persian Gulf. He believes the whipsawing
markets will give him an opportunity to sell a gold position
he bought in the morning from a Hong Kong broker. As prices
hit $414 an ounce, he trades the position to a Swiss bank.
"You and I can do some business," he says to the buyer.</p>
<p>Suddenly, gold starts plummeting, to $413, then $412. Mr.
Schjogolev gets back in the market and buys back the same
position at lower cost.</p>
<p>"That's a $3,500 profit," he says. "Not bad for a couple
of minutes."</p>
