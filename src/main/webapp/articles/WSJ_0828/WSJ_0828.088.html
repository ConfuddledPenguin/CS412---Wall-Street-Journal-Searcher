	<p class="article-leader">ROCHESTER, N.Y. -- Peter Kolokouris, former president of
North Atlantic Fisheries Inc. here, was sentenced to a
$10,000 fine and five years of probation in U.S. District
Court here.
   Mr. Kolokouris had pleaded guilty to filing a false tax
return and filing a false statement with regulators about the
company's initial public offering.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Kolokouris, appearing before federal Judge Michael
Telesca, faced a sentence of as much as 13 years in prison
and $110,000 of fines, said Charles M. Pilato, assistant U.S.
attorney in charge of the case.</p>
<p>In June, without admitting or denying wrongdoing, Mr.
Kolokouris settled a lawsuit filed against him by the
Securities and Exchange Commission by giving up a total $2.1
million of stock in North Atlantic and three other companies.
That suit charged that the executive had a secret ownership
interest in the company's underwriter and that he received
kickbacks from the underwriter.</p>
<p>John Parinello, attorney for Mr. Kolokouris, said his
client had helped to initiate the civil settlement and that
this cooperation was reflected in the outcome of the criminal
proceeding.</p>
<p>The criminal and civil charges both were filed in June
1989. The civil settlement also bars Mr. Kolokouris for five
years from being an officer, or owning 5% or more, of any
public company.</p>
<p>North Atlantic Fisheries, a fish processor, is being
overseen by a court-appointed receiver.</p>
