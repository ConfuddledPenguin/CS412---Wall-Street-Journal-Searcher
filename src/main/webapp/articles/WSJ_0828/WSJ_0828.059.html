	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Because of higher world oil prices, the
International Monetary Fund may lend more money to Brazil and
some other developing countries that import oil, a senior
Treasury official told reporters.
   "The question of access {to IMF resources} may need to be
looked at," the official said. He stressed that no decisions
have been reached, and he made it clear that any broadening
of access to IMF resources wouldn't match the special IMF
lending that followed the severe oil price rises of 1973-1974
and 1979.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Despite a sharp decline yesterday, oil prices remain about
40% above their level of six months ago. According to some
estimates, Brazil's oil import bill may rise by as much as $2
billion a year because of the higher prices, the official
said.</p>
<p>Brazil currently is seeking loans from the IMF to support
economic reforms. It also is talking informally with a few of
its biggest commercial bank creditors; the talks, which are
expected to end by Sept. 14, are designed to enable the
country's biggest lenders to tell Brazil what they want from
a bank debt settlement and to learn more about the country's
controversial economic reforms. Formal negotiations between
Brazil and its commercial bank creditors are expected to
begin this fall in New York.</p>
<p>The current exploratory talks "will probably help in
getting a deal done later," the Treasury official said.
Brazil hasn't paid interest on about $70 billion of its
medium-term foreign bank debt for more than a year.</p>
<p>Of all Latin American countries, Brazil is probably being
hit hardest by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait and the
subsequent international embargo on trade with those
countries. Brazil is a large importer of oil -- particularly
Iraqi oil -- and Iraq has been an important market for
Brazilian airplanes, tanks, and other goods.</p>
<p>The crisis in the Persian Gulf won't affect the
administration's Enterprise Initiative for the Americas, the
Treasury official said. The Treasury is preparing legislation
to back up that initiative, which would offer Latin American
nations closer trade relations, cut the relatively small
loans they owe the U.S. government, and attempt to boost
foreign investment in the region. The legislation will be
"prepared and ready to go to the Hill when Congress gets back
in session," the Treasury official said.</p>
<p>Separately, the official said World Bank Senior Vice
President Ernest Stern will join the new European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, the London-based development
bank that will lend to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
Mr. Stern will be the senior U.S. official in that
institution and is expected to fill the No. 2 job there under
the bank's chairman, Jacques Attali, personal adviser to
French President Francois Mitterrand.</p>
