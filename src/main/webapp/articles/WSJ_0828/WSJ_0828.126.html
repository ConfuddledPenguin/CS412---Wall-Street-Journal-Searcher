	<p class="article-leader">Cherry Hills, Colo. -- Two former San Diego high school
teammates had at it in the finals of the men's U.S. Amateur
Golf Championship here Sunday, and it was a tossup which had
come farthest to keep the date.
   The one who lost was Manny Zerman, a dark-haired,
broad-shouldered young man of 20 who's a sophomore at the U.
of Arizona. He's a South African who came to San Diego to
live three years ago, so his trip covered several thousand
miles.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Phil Mickelson, the winner, made a physically shorter but
more unusual journey: to the "wrong" side of the ball. The
20-year-old Arizona State junior is a natural righthander but
took to whacking golf balls lefty as a toddler and stayed
that way. He's the first of that persuasion to win a
tournament that's been contested 90 times since 1895.</p>
<p>"My dad tried to change me to righthanded when I was about
two years old but I wouldn't let him. I guess two-year-olds
are tough to convince," says the psychology major. "I'm told
that only about 7% of the people who play golf play lefty,
but I never thought it was a handicap."</p>
<p>It was no handicap to Mickelson over a week in which he
played 150 holes through a 36-hole medal qualifier and six
rounds of match play. He was 13 under par for that stretch,
all but one qualifying round of which was played at the
7,110-yard, par 71 Cherry Hills Country Club. He was four
under for the 32 holes of the final, which he won, 5 and 4.
That's match play for five holes up with four to go.</p>
<p>"He hits the ball great, and nothing rattles him," said
Zerman of the guy he's played "a couple hundred" times in
practice since they met as seniors at U. of San Diego High.
Sunday's was the first formal match between the two, but
Mickelson said the others also were important. "They were for
our own cash," he explained.</p>
<p>It was appropriate that two collegians met in the final,
because the "kids" had all the best of it in the rest of this
fest. Of the eight quarterfinalists, only two could be called
workingmen. And that classification might be disputed by
some, because both earn their living at golf.</p>
<p>As luck would have it, they met in one quarterfinal
Saturday morning, and 38-year-old David Eger, an
administrator with the PGA tour, edged Mike Brannan, 34, a
golf club manufacturer's rep, 2 and 1. Then Eger fell to
Mickelson, 5 and 3, in Saturday's afternoon round.</p>
<p>Among the earlier victims here were three tourney
ex-champs. Buddy Alexander, the 1986 winner, failed to
qualify; insurance man Jay Sigel (1982 and '83) lost in the
second round; and Chris Patton, the defending titlist, was a
first-round victim, to Southern Cal soph Chris Zambri, by the
lopsided margin of 8 and 6.</p>
<p>Patton, the rotund ex-Clemson U. player whose victory last
year at the old Merion course near Philadelphia gave the
amateur game a needed shot of pizzazz, remarked that he'd be
turning pro now, in part because his car was falling apart
and he needed a new one.</p>
<p>In Patton's absence, the favorite's role fell to
Mickelson, who has accomplished a lot, linkswise, in his
brief life. He's won the past two NCAA championships, played
in the Walker Cup against the British, and was the low
amateur in June's U.S. Open. His 72-hole score of even-par
288 there was the best effort by a non-pro, relative to par,
since Jack Nicklaus finished two under, and two strokes
behind winner Arnold Palmer, in 1960, here at Cherry Hills.</p>
<p>Mickelson is a tall lad with a lusty, upright swing and an
exaggeratedly stiff-wristed putting stroke. He's a long
hitter by any standard, and attacks a course with
single-minded aggression. "I never lay up on a hole. The
closer you get to the pin, the better chance you have for a
birdie," says he.</p>
<p>Nothing better illustrated this philosophy than his play
of the 17th hole here. It's a 555-yard par five whose
moat-protected green precludes runups. Nonetheless, Mickelson
invariably went for it in two through the light Colorado air,
and his birdies there were instrumental in his closest wins,
a 1-up, third-round squeaker over Mike Swingle of the U. of
Washington, and a quarterfinal triumph, by the same score,
over Bob May of Oklahoma State.</p>
<p>Zerman is a more compact type whose radar iron shots
settled each of his matches save the final before the 18th
hole. A much-traveled player whose titles include the 1986
Chilean Amateur, he was born in Durban, South Africa. He came
to San Diego in 1985 to play in an international junior
tourney, living with a family named Hogue. Two trips later he
decided to stay, and has been legally adopted by the Hogues.
He plans to apply for U.S. citizenship.</p>
<p>His odyssey reminds of those of runner Zola Budd and
tennis player Kevin Curran, who'd previously sought to avoid
strictures against South African athletes by changing
citizenship. "My {birth} parents have been supportive. They
agree what I'm doing is best for my future," Zerman says
quietly.</p>
<p>Sunday's final between the buddies was about as good as
they come, despite the score. Mickelson started as though he
would make a rout of the thing, going two under par through
10 holes to Zerman's two over, and taking a four-hole lead.
But Zerman played the next nine holes in three under par and
cut the lead to one.</p>
<p>Zerman could have pulled even on the day's 21st hole, the
328-yard par-four third, but Mickelson holed a chip shot for
a birdie to go 2 up again. Zerman cut the lead to one by
smacking a seven-iron to two inches of the pin on the
168-yard 24th hole, and rolled in a chip shot of his own for
a birdie two holes later. But Mickelson frustrated him with a
tying, 30-foot putt there, then rolled in.</p>
<p>Both players later said they would stay amateur through
college. Zerman said he liked college life, Mickelson was
more businesslike. "I want to feel I can win every week
before I turn pro," he said.</p>
<p>A couple more years ought to do that.</p>
