	<p class="article-leader">More than six moons have passed since the current occupant
took over this space. Shall we pause as summer's sun wanes?
Moving from subject to subject weekly has left some untied
ends.
   Take Motorola Inc.'s ambitious drug-testing policy,
discussed here a couple of months ago. The company hasn't
backed off from its intended Jan. 1 start-up, but a few
employees called to say that support is far from the 80%
reported here. In Austin, Texas, some Motorolans have teamed
up with counterparts from Texas Instruments, the other major
U.S. employer to urine-test all workers, to lobby the City
Council to prohibit the policy there. About 7,000 work for
the two companies in that liberal city. So far, however, the
councilman sponsoring the ban has yet to line up a majority
to pass it. Now it isn't expected to make the council agenda
until at least October. Meanwhile, fickle public opinion
seems to have downgraded drugs a few notches on the crisis
meter, as old favorites war and unemployment stage a
comeback.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Franklin Savings Association of Kansas still is in federal
conservatorship, awaiting a court ruling after a hearing in
July. The once-burgeoning thrift was taken over by regulators
on Feb. 16 when they alleged that its sophisticated hedge
strategy was masking insolvency. John Scowcroft, the
36-year-old University of Chicago "quant" who was
second-in-command of the brash institution, says he hopes to
be back in the saddle along with Chairman Ernest Fleischer
when a federal district judge rules shortly. Meanwhile, the
holding company's been paying him enough to get by, not the
$524,000 (half in stock) he made in 1989. And the type of
mortgage-backed securities that Franklin relied on, called
REMICS, have shinnied in the volatile investment climate of
recent weeks.</p>
<p>Other financial institutions whose leaders have graced
this space have had a similar rocky flight. About the time
two executives of Chicago's Continental Bank were quoted here
saying their high-leverage transaction financing was right
for the times, Forbes magazine reported it was the wrong
strategy. Continental had a fit, but so far, Forbes is more
right. And Security Pacific Corp. of Los Angeles, which
continues to creep up on J.P. Morgan for the No. 4 slot among
U.S. banks (it hasn't made it yet, despite our premature
crowning), is exasperatingly looking for a way to put some
pounds on its withering stock price. The Southern California
real-estate market may have to show some muscle in support of
the aggressive home lender.</p>
<p>The Golden State got in training for the Iraqi oil scare
by raising its gasoline tax, in spite of all good advice to
the contrary here. It also voted narrowly to build every rail
line in conception, again without our concurrence. In mute
accord with the libertarian admonition to be glad you don't
get the government you pay for, however, officials recently
cautioned that the transit projects can't possibly proceed as
quickly as backers planned. Surprise]</p>
<p>Gov. George Deukmejian's administration also seems to have
given up an effort to bridge deep political chasms and impose
a worker health-insurance requirement on California
employers. A bruising budget battle may have convinced
everybody that no money is in the till for ambitious
undertakings. With luck, the new governor (and old
Legislature, probably) will face a similar triage situation
come 1991.</p>
<p>Over in southern Nevada, the gaming and construction boom
continues, with only a few busted hands. Efforts to lure
industry to Las Vegas continue uneventfully apace, but a
November ballot initiative to impose a state business tax
would "instantly destroy" the state's economy, Democrat Gov.
Bob Miller says. A less-onerous payroll tax is being designed
by the corporatists to fund schools for all the new
residents.</p>
<p>America West Airlines will not have to make good on an
implied threat to move its home base to Las Vegas or
somewhere else, because the city of Phoenix obligated itself
for bonds to build a new maintenance facility for the carrier
at its birthplace, Sky Harbor Airport.</p>
<p>North as the spotted owl flies, opposing sides remained at
loggerheads over timber exports. Sure enough, the
nature-at-any-price lobby went after wood sales to Japan from
private lands as soon as they succeeded in cordoning off
state acreage. The saving grace for employment in the
Northwest may be the enterprising spirit that the region's
many newcomers bring with them.</p>
<p>In Portland, Ore., a setback was suffered by opponents of
throwaway diapers. Gary Hansen, the trash-board member whose
diaper (of choice)-abatement scheme we spotlighted in the
spring, was the bridesmaid in his bid for a Multnomah County
commissioner's seat. No word on whether the ballots were
recycled. California, meanwhile, didn't join in the official
cloth-diaper movement, a rare show of, uh, restraint by the
Legislature.</p>
<p>Four employees of Gibraltar Savings, the wrecked Southern
California thrift whose perquisite package for top managers
included fully paid boob jobs, sued alleging they weren't
given 60 days' notice of termination when the government put
the mess in someone else's lap. The lucky new owner: Security
Pacific (see above).</p>
<p>No buyers have been solicited for the nation's public
airports since the prospect was explored here in March.
However, one blot on the privatization record must be noted:
Last winter we touted SuperShuttle, a van service at Los
Angeles airports and a few others in the Sun Belt, as a model
for reducing commuter congestion. Since then, the author of
this column has twice called on the company to get him on his
way. Both times, SuperShuttle's on-time performance made the
airlines look like Swiss watches (thank goodness for the
private auto as a backup). Posing as an unimportant
passenger, the aggrieved party dropped a letter to the
outfit's president. Two months later, he waits for a reply.</p>
<p>Good news came faster for Dr. James Todd, the acting head
of the American Medical Association when we met up with him
in early April. He is now the fullfledged chief executive of
the AMA. Try as he might wish, though, he's probably too late
with his bid for mandatory health insurance to assist Gov.
Deukmejian in selling the idea to skeptical small-business
people and taxpayers (see above).</p>
<p>Another progressive notion, that young people should not
be toil-bound, brought Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole's
forces out in the field again in June to find some peach fuzz
manning the pizza oven at 11 p.m. To mix food groups, you may
recall our mentioning the candy man, who solicited kids in
housing projects to go door-to-door selling. He got fined
$9,900 and his appeal is pending.</p>
<p>A column on the exploding cost of worker-compensation
insurance brought a few enterprising souls out of the
woodwork to pitch their schemes for keeping employees healthy
on the job. But Steven Kelen, the president of a small Los
Angeles manufacturer, California Webbing Industries, was
probably closer to the mark with a cri de coeur about bogus
claims -- back pain, headache, "stress" -- being filed by
workers as they leave his employment in order to secure a
nice severance. And from a workers' comp official in Michigan
came a brag that "by changing the law to deal with specific
problems such as the overuse of the system by retirees, we
have dropped litigated cases from over 44,000 in 1981 to
about 22,000." Go Blue]</p>
