	<p class="article-leader">Coca-Cola Foods, which produces Minute Maid orange juice,
said it plans to cut the price of its frozen concentrated
juice to reflect cost decreases.
   The Coca-Cola Co. division, the nation's largest orange
juice maker, said it would reduce the price of a 12-ounce can
of frozen juice by 20 cents to 25 cents. A typical can
currently costs about $1.60 to $1.90, the company said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In recent weeks, Brazilian processors have announced price
decreases on orange concentrate, reflecting strong supplies.
In taking advantage of the lower costs, Coca-Cola Foods hopes
to stimulate growth in frozen juice volume, which it
previously predicted would decline at a double-digit rate
this year.</p>
<p>The price cuts may stem some of that decline, but they
aren't deep enough to completely erase price hikes taken
earlier this year to offset a freeze in Florida. In December,
for example, a typical can of Minute Maid frozen orange juice
sold for $1.20 to $1.50.</p>
<p>Still, orange juice is a price-sensitive beverage, and a
price decrease is certain to stimulate demand for frozen
juice, a lethargic category that has suffered from consumers'
preference for the convenience of ready-to-drink, chilled
beverages.</p>
