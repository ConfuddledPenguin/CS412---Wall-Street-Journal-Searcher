	<p class="article-leader">Roussel-Uclaf S.A., the French company that makes the
abortion pill RU 486, reported a 24% increase in consolidated
profit for the first half of 1990 to 319 million francs
($60.9 million) from 258 million francs the previous year.
   The pharmaceutical group, which is 54.5% controlled by
Hoechst AG of West Germany, said its strong profit growth was
based on a 13% gain in consolidated revenue to 6.58 billion
francs from 5.81 billion francs a year before. On the basis
of a comparable group structure, the increase was only 7.1%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Roussel-Uclaf said earlier this year that it expects to
report a 10% rise in its profit for all of 1990, excluding
exceptional items.</p>
