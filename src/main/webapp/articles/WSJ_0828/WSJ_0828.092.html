	<p class="article-leader">A recent federal court ruling -- U.S. v. Fleet Factors
Corp. -- delivers a new and potentially devastating blow to
banks. The ruling drastically expands "lender liability"
under the Superfund law (the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA), and is
proof positive, if any further proof was needed, that
Superfund is a terrible law with terrible economic
consequences.
   Banks, nonbank financial institutions and others with
secured interest holdings: welcome to the cuckoo world of
Superfund liability. Under Fleet Factors -- handed down May
23, 1990 by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the
Eleventh Circuit -- banks may now be liable, on the basis of
past loans, for the same Superfund costs as a polluter or any
other "potentially responsible party."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Fleet Factors goes well beyond the 1986 Maryland Bank and
Trust decision, which held that a bank foreclosing on
contaminated property could be held liable as an "owner" for
clean-up of Superfund sites. The implications of that case
are minuscule when compared with the burdens imposed by Fleet
Factors.</p>
<p>In Fleet Factors, the central issue to be decided was
whether and to what extent the secured creditor exemption in
the Superfund law applies to banks. The question before the
court was: What level of activity would expose a holder of a
security interest to liability?</p>
<p>The new ruling answers this question with a vengeance.
Fleet Factors brings to bear the full force of Superfund's
retroactive aspects. Under the ruling, a lender may be liable
for the entire cost of a cleanup if its involvement with the
borrower ever put it in a position to "affect hazardous waste
disposal decisions if it so chose."</p>
<p>Thus, it may be liable if it lent to an owner or operator
at any time during the period of disposal. It does not matter
that the contamination took place, or the loan was made,
decades before the Superfund law was enacted.</p>
<p>To compound the absurdity, loans of mere thousands of
dollars could conceivably generate liabilities in the
millions. Worse, by virtue of Superfund's use of
joint-and-several liability, a single bank that in 1970 held
a 10% stake in a syndicated loan could -- if it is the only
bank in the group still solvent -- be made to pay 100% of the
clean-up costs in 1990 dollars.</p>
<p>The court advises banks to factor their expanded liability
into product prices -- but this counsel is naive. First, it
assumes a price can be put on the new exposure when, in fact,
the open-ended nature of environmental claims makes adequate
pricing and reserving into a guessing game. Moreover, even if
this risk could be quantified, pricing bank services
adequately may be impossible in today's fiercely competitive
financial services arena.</p>
<p>The court clearly views its opinion as providing
incentives to responsible behavior. It asserts that creditors
facing Superfund liability will more closely monitor their
borrowers' treatment of toxic waste, and that borrowers will
exercise more care since "inadequate hazardous waste
treatment will have a significant adverse impact on their
loan terms."</p>
<p>The court's ruling will actually have the opposite result.
The magnitude of Superfund liability is such that, instead of
taking on the role of monitor, lending institutions will try
to insulate themselves from exposure in this highly
troublesome area. The wording of the decision fails to
provide clear guidelines for financial institutions' future
behavior. Lenders may be reluctant to finance clients with
any involvement in environmental clean-up, recycling or waste
disposal activities for fear that such financial
arrangements, in and of themselves, might establish a
sufficient level of control to trigger liability.</p>
<p>The court's decision has even wider implications. Not only
does it pave the way for the Environmental Protection Agency
and others to sue banks; it also subjects the Resolution
Trust Company charged with disposing the real estate assets
of hundreds of failed thrifts -- in many cases, contaminated
real estate -- to the same fate.</p>
<p>It is vital to understand that the past liabilities
created by Superfund are vast. Estimates of clean-up costs
range as high as $750 billion. Clean-up at an average site
runs from $27 million to $50 million.</p>
<p>Decontamination should be our first priority -- not trying
to pick the supposedly "deep pockets" of innocent parties.
Financial institutions play a central role in our economy. To
saddle lenders with Superfund liability will entangle them in
more and more suits by government, by borrowers and by third
parties -- and may compromise their ability to act as
catalysts of economic growth in the future. Reform of a
system that is patently unfair and ineffective is essential.</p>
<p>In other jurisdictions, cases may be decided in ways that
conflict with Fleet Factors. But for now Fleet Factors is the
law of the land, and it will continue to be the law of the
Eleventh Circuit unless it is overturned by the Supreme
Court. This state of affairs dictates the need for financial
institutions to make their case for legislative reform as
promptly and forcefully as possible.</p>
<p>Such reform should include a program aimed at making
hazardous waste liability equitable and predictable. This is
necessary if financial institutions are to know and insure
their risks, and if they are to be a positive force in the
universal goal of creating a cleaner, safer environment.</p>
