	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- A glimmer of a turnaround is sparking
investors' interest in Cineplex Odeon, the beleaguered
movie-theater chain.
   Even its diehard fans expect no near-term miracles from
this battered stock. New management is shouldering heavy
debts left behind by Cineplex's founder and former chairman
Garth Drabinsky, who was forced out in December. But as the
new team goes about its task of slashing debt, paring
expenses and selling assets, a few investors are warming to
the recession-defying potential of the company's line of
business.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"People are always going to go to movies and buy popcorn
and sodas," says Henry Bonis, a New York businessman and
Cineplex investor.</p>
<p>Mr. Bonis says he owns about 50,000 shares, many of them
acquired in recent weeks. "I've seen their theaters, I have
confidence in the new management," he says. "It's going to
take a year or so, but they'll get back in the black."</p>
<p>Cineplex closed yesterday at $2.50 a share, unchanged, in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
<p>Although many securities analysts still don't recommend
buying Cineplex shares, some, such as Lisbeth Barron, vice
president of S.G. Warburg, say they are contemplating
changing their recommendations to "hold" from sell. "This is
a turnaround that's beginning to work," Ms. Barron says. "It
just remains to be seen whether they can keep it going."</p>
<p>Investors give good reviews to the company's first-half
operating performance. More people are walking through the
doors of Cineplex movie theaters, they say, pointing to a
15.7% increase from a year earlier in first-half admissions
revenue. And Cineplex far outstripped the industry average
increase of only 0.4% for such revenue in the period.</p>
<p>"If somebody has the patience to wait it out, he could
make a bundle on this stock," said Ernest Camponegro, a New
York investment executive who has bought Cineplex stock in
recent weeks and recommends it to his clients. "How many
stocks are there with this kind of visibility, with a
business that's a real cash cow, backed by major
shareholders, that trades at $3?"</p>
<p>Reflecting its former expansion spree, Cineplex had $479.4
million in long-term debt at midyear, down from $578.1
million a year earlier. Besides using $75 million from asset
sales to cut debt, Cineplex's president and chief executive,
Allen Karp, is hoping to refinance, whittling away at
interest expense. "We're looking at every way of doing this,"
he said. "We're in a process that could take several months."</p>
<p>There's little to cheer investors in the company's
first-half net loss, which widened to the equivalent of $1.06
a share from 59 cents a share a year earlier. But in terms of
cash flow, Cineplex had a net outflow of $13.2 million in the
six months, narrower than the $30.6 million outflow a year
earlier. After cutting general and administrative expenses
28% in the second quarter to $5.9 million, Mr. Karp expects
to trim perhaps 10% to 20% more in the second half.</p>
<p>Investors are heartened by the presence of Cineplex's two
controlling shareholders, MCA of Universal City, Calif., and
interests associated with Montreal financier Charles
Bronfman. If Cineplex fails to meet an agreement with its
banks to raise $200 million through asset sales by year-end,
MCA and Mr. Bronfman's Claridge Investments have agreed to
chip in $50 million each to help cut debt; Cineplex
presumably could turn to them for additional support if
necessary.</p>
<p>Cineplex's theaters are in prime locations, such as New
York, and as a result the company may have bargaining clout
with studios over rising costs. A growing supply of new
films, including about seven releases from Columbia Pictures
Entertainment Co., will help boost admissions and concession
revenue in the second half, Cineplex says.</p>
<p>But this month saw the collapse of a $31.8 million plan to
sell some of Cineplex's U.S. theaters to Plitt Amusement Co.,
Los Angeles. Bankers are believed to have been reluctant to
finance an acquisition valued at eight times cash flow. Mr.
Karp insists: "We will not dispose of assets except at fair
value. We're taking a firm stand and I have the strength of
our shareholders {MCA and Claridge} behind me on this." He
says a sale might still be completed, possibly at a lower
price and with Cineplex retaining some of the theaters.</p>
<p>The Plitt affair suggests how hard it is to sell assets
when the movie industry is already what industry people call
"overscreened." As Mr. Karp puts it, "We couldn't have picked
a worse time to restructure the company, from an industry
standpoint." Cineplex may be "out of the woods," but the
executive says he doesn't think "people should be throwing
parties quite yet."</p>
