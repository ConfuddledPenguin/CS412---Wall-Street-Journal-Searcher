	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Mal Lowenthal seems to have landed on his
feet.
   The high-producing stockbroker, fired by Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc. for calling the brokerage business "dirty" in
an article published in USA Today, was hired by Wertheim
Schroder & Co.'s New York office.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Lowenthal, in the Aug. 3 newspaper article, commented
on why there are so many complaints about brokers: "Because
this is a dirty business. Our product is money. And money
attracts scum." He also said a broker is a "dummy" if he
focuses only on his own firm's research ideas. Shearson, an
American Express Co. unit, said in response that Mr.
Lowenthal's views didn't "conform with the firm's philosophy
of quality service."</p>
<p>Wertheim Schroder, by contrast, yesterday called Mr.
Lowenthal a "consummate professional" with a good record and
"an excellent group of clients." The firm said, "He shares
our philosophy of putting our clients' interests first."</p>
