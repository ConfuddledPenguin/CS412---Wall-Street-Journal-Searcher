	<p class="article-leader">THE U.S. EXPELLED Iraqi envoys as Bush voiced pessimism on
"fruitful" talks.
   In response to Iraq's attempt to close the U.S. Embassy in
Kuwait, the White House ordered Baghdad to slash its
diplomatic contingent in Washington by two-thirds. While Bush
expressed doubts, he endorsed plans by the U.N.'s chief to
meet Iraq's foreign minister, but the president indicated the
U.S. wants the talks limited to an unconditional Iraqi
pullout from Kuwait. Baghdad, meanwhile, reportedly ordered
at least one captain of an oil tanker not to defy the
international naval blockade of trade with Iraq.</p>

<p>THE U.N. REPORTEDLY AGREED on a plan to end Cambodia's
conflict.</p>
<p>The permanent members of the Security Council -- the U.S.,
the Soviet Union, Britain, France and China -- formulated a
plan calling for the U.N. to administer key Cambodian
ministries in a transition leading to free elections,
diplomats said. The plan also is said to call for the U.N. to
verify a ceasefire in the decade-old civil war and to verify
that Vietnamese forces have withdrawn.</p>
<p>The proposals, which one official described as "Cambodia's
last hope," will be submitted to Cambodia's warring factions
for their approval.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of blacks held a one-day strike in South
Africa to bury their dead and to demand an end to factional
fighting that has killed more than 500 people. Anglican
Archbishop Tutu blamed police officials and pro-apartheid
whites for the recent violence, and called for the creation
of a new police force acceptable to blacks.</p>

<p>Quebec's premier broke off talks with Indians involved in
a seven-week armed standoff with authorities and ordered the
Canadian army to tear down Mohawk barricades in two
communities. Bourassa, who charged that the Mohawks hadn't
been negotiating in good faith on their demands, didn't say
how or when the army would act.</p>

<p>Eugene Hasenfus lost his bid to be compensated for his
role in the White House-sanctioned Contra supply mission.
Jurors in federal court in Miami rejected the claims of the
crew member of a plane shot down over Nicaragua in 1986. Most
of his claims had been dismissed earlier, reducing his plea
to $500.</p>

<p>A Utah brush fire raged out of control, killing two
firefighters, destroying at least 18 homes and scorching
2,500 acres, officials said. About 300 homes were evacuated
in the path of the wind-driven blaze, which broke out Sunday
in mountains 30 miles east of Salt Lake City. The fire, of
unknown origin, had simmered since late last week.</p>

<p>About 20,000 Bulgarians rallied in Sofia to show support
for the governing Socialist Party, the former Communist
Party, near the party's headquarters, which was attacked and
burned Sunday by anti-Communist protesters. Police were
instructed to use clubs and tear gas if necessary to prevent
further violence in the capital.</p>

<p>A Michigan appeals court ruled that news organizations
must turn over unpublished photographs and notes to people
involved in civil lawsuits. It was the first time that a
Michigan court has considered whether the First Amendment
protects reporters from having to disclose nonconfidential
information.</p>

<p>Scholastic Aptitude Test scores fell for the third
straight year because of students' weakening verbal skills.
Students headed for college this fall achieved an average
combined mathematics and verbal score of 900, down from 903
last year. All of the decline was in the verbal score, which
fell to 424.</p>

<p>Nigerian ships captured a boat carrying weapons for a
Liberian rebel leader, according to a spokesman for the
African forces trying to impose a cease-fire in Liberia's
civil war. An official with the multinational force said the
guns seized were destined for insurgent Charles Taylor, who
heads one of two groups fighting to oust President Doe.</p>

<p>Ousted Pakistani leader Bhutto said charges of illegal
weapons possession brought against her husband were
politically motivated and designed to influence elections
scheduled for Oct. 24. Police officials filed the charges
Sunday night against the ex-prime minister's husband but
didn't arrest the 37-year-old businessman.</p>

<p>Rival Christian forces battled in East Beirut, killing two
soldiers and violating a three-month truce, security
officials said. Troops of rebellious Gen. Aoun reportedly
fought for two hours with militiamen of the Lebanese Forces.
Aoun has rejected an Arab-sponsored peace pact to end 15
years of civil war in Lebanon.</p>

<p>Angola's leftist government opened direct peace talks with
U.S.-backed Unita rebels. The long-delayed meeting, held in
Portugal, was the third in five months aimed at ending the
15-year Angolan civil war. Officials close to the discussions
said they were doubtful that much progress would be made
toward a firm cease-fire accord.</p>
