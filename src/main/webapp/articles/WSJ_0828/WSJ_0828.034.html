	<p class="article-leader">HEWLETT, N.Y. -- Anchor Savings Bank named 47-year-old
Richard W. Dalrymple, formerly Bank of Boston Corp.'s head of
world-wide banking services, as president, chief operating
officer and a director.
   The executive succeeds William G. Schneider Jr., who
resigned last September. Mr. Schneider had claimed his duties
had been reduced by a reorganization initiated by James M.
Large Jr., Anchor's chairman and chief executive officer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In July, the savings bank, which has 13 directors,
reported net income for the fourth quarter ended June 30 of
$40.9 million, or $2.15 a share, versus a net loss of $26.9
million, or $1.75 a share, in the year-earlier period.</p>
<p>The earnings reflect gains from asset sales that are part
of Anchor's effort to fully meet federal capital standards.</p>
<p>In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Anchor
shares gained 12.5 cents to close at $1.75.</p>
