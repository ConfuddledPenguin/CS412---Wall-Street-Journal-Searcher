	<p class="article-leader">Cyprus Minerals Co. said it will spend $92.5 million to
modernize and expand its Miami, Ariz., copper smelter.
   Cyprus said the expansion would command a sizable portion
of the Denver mining company's 1991 capital expenditure
budget, which has been about $200 million a year for the past
couple of years. The expansion, which is designed to make
Cyprus self-sufficient in copper smelting capacity, will be
completed in mid-1992, the company estimated. The move will
increase Cyprus's concentrate smelting capacity to 650,000
tons from 450,000 tons annually.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The completed facility will reduce the consumption of
electric power, the biggest cost in producing copper, a
spokesman said. The upgrading of the facility has been part
of the company's long-term plans since it bought the smelter
from Inspiration Resources Corp. in 1988.</p>
<p>Cyprus said that regardless of the plans for the expanded
smelter, the company will "meet its obligations" in a
copper-concentrate smelting contract it has with Magma Copper
Co., which runs through mid-1996. Magma processes about
150,000 tons of copper concentrates annually for Cyprus at a
San Manuel, Ariz., smelter.</p>
