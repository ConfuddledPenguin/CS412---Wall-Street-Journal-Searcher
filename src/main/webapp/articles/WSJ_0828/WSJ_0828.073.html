	<p class="article-leader">CONSOLIDATED FREIGHTWAYS Inc., Menlo Park, Calif., trying
to recover from continuing losses at its Emery Worldwide
air-freight unit, said it signed agreements with Bank of
America for financing worth $350 million. A spokesman for the
trucking and air-freight company said in June that it had
negotiated an $850 million credit agreement with a subsidiary
of Chemical Banking Corp. But the spokesman said that changes
in the company's management, announced last month, and
improvements in its business resulted in a new credit deal
for a lower amount. The deal with Bank of America calls for
Consolidated to receive a fixed-rate term loan of $100
million and "standby" credit of $250 million. Consolidated
said the financing is subject to "customary conditions," but
declined to provide details. Consolidated, which bought Emery
in 1989 for $470 million in cash and debt, has struggled
financially this year, posting a net loss of $37.5 million
for the first half of the year, mainly because of Emery's
woes. But the company said Emery is on the mend, citing
"stabilized levels of revenue and reduced expenses" at the
air-freight unit.</p>
