	<p class="article-leader">Looking for some reason to feel thankful? Then feel
thankful that you were nowhere near La Plume, Pa., when Lili
Zeigler, then a teacher at Keystone Junior College, ate a
bunch of garlic and tested her breath on innocent people.
   "I went around the college and asked people, `Would you
mind if I blew in your face?'" she says, explaining: "You can
do things like that in an academic community because
everybody loves experimenting."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>What Ms. Zeigler was experimenting with was Dr. Sakai
Garlic, a Japanese innovation that promises "no more garlic
breath." This is important for Ms. Zeigler, since she is a
speech teacher.</p>
<p>Kotaro Sakai, a 58-year-old doctor of agriculture in
Tokyo, touts his garlic bulbs as a leap forward in oral
hygiene, thanks to the pickling solution he has concocted.
The aroma and taste of garlic survive, but, he says, the odor
leaves the breath especially fast. He attaches a caveat for
people with "less-than-common body chemistry."</p>
<p>Mr. Sakai is the president of Sanko Chemical Institute, a
small research center, and he shows up in a Japanese version
of Who's Who as a soil researcher. But his real passion for
20 years has been garlic. He has peeled so many bulbs, he
says, that one time his fingernails fell out.</p>
<p>His product is being handled in America by 56-year-old
Taeko Bybee. A U.S. resident but a Japanese citizen, she is
president of Jewel Rina Inc., a small company in Strausstown,
Pa., controlled by a few Japanese investors.</p>
<p>She had been casting about for her break in business when
she met Mr. Sakai in 1986, the same year his garlic won a
prize at an inventors' convention in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Two of Ms. Bybee's previous entrepreneurial outings,
though flops, appeared to be on-point: breath mints called
ABB (for "anti-bad breath") and a breathalyzer that
supposedly worked as a "bad-breath detector." Ms. Bybee
explains: "We Japanese are quite odor conscious."</p>
<p>Ms. Bybee wanted U.S. marketing rights and Mr. Sakai was
impressed by her zeal, so they clove together. "There will
soon come an age of large garlic consumption," predicts Mr.
Sakai, who talks of potential uses in coffee, in chocolate
and in vitamin drinks.</p>
<p>Voluptuous, parchment-skinned and chemically complex, the
garlic bulb has evoked mystery as well as scorn since the
time of the pharoahs. It's not only found in Caesar salads,
but was found in King Tut's tomb. It's used not only to ward
off vampires, but illness. This week, scientists from several
continents will meet in Washington to ponder garlic's alleged
aid in preventing cancer and heart disease.</p>
<p>Robert Lin, a researcher at Nutrition International Co.,
an Irvine, Calif., consulting firm, explains that a
perplexing cascade of chemical reactions gets under way once
the volatile compounds in garlic are exposed to certain
enzymes. "I would say we're at the kindergarten stage" of
understanding, he says.</p>
<p>But what is well understood is garlic's social liability.
Mr. Sakai argues that the digestion of garlic releases sulfur
compounds known as mercaptans. That's what skunks spray.</p>
<p>It is Mr. Sakai's mission to solve this problem. The
outcome of his labor is the pickling solution. Its recipe is
a secret, of course. But the U.S. patent hints that it
includes an acid commonly found in plants and also a form of
silica, which is the glassy stuff that's in sand and quartz.
The bulbs are soaked, then cooled and dried.</p>
<p>In a test involving five persons, their breath showed
lower levels of mercaptans after consumption of treated
garlic than of untreated, the patent asserts.</p>
<p>In Strausstown, a rural spot in southeastern Pennsylvania,
Jewel Rina's nine workers soak about a ton of bulbs each
week, operating out of a converted chicken hatchery. The
company buys the solution from Mr. Sakai. It orders garlic
from wherever the herb is in season, usually South America or
Gilroy, Calif., "The Garlic Capital of the World."</p>
<p>Quality control is done by a woman on the packaging line,
who periodically chews a slice of the finished product, moves
face-to-face with a co-worker and then gently puffs.</p>
<p>Ms. Bybee drives all over the country in her Toyota trying
to sell the garlic. And she is not easily dissuaded. A former
colleague recalls the time she popped into the office of the
head buyer at a grocery chain. "He'd say, `I'm in a meeting.'
She'd say, `Meeting? Yes, that's exactly what we want.' He'd
say, `No I'm in a meeting with other people.' She'd say,
`Yes, they can listen, too.'"</p>
<p>Some buyers may have needed the hard sell. "It was the
butt of a joke here -- garlic that doesn't smell?" says Ted
Glowiak, a broker at Calkins & Co., a Des Plaines, Ill., food
broker. But now, he says, Calkins has helped distribute the
bulbs to about 300 Chicago-area stores. Elsewhere, too,
various chains -- Acme, Giant Food and Safeway among them --
have signed on for distribution, though sometimes in spotty
quantities.</p>
<p>It sells for about $1.50 for a two-bulb package that
proclaims on the outside that garlic "has been doing
unsociable things to breath for 7,000 years."</p>
<p>The product still must overcome much skepticism. Eric
Block, a professor at the State University of New York at
Albany, has long studied the chemistry of garlic. Of late he
has gotten queries about Dr. Sakai Garlic, so he tested a few
bulbs for a compound called allicin, whose breakdown products
contribute to garlic breath. He says he found "no striking
diminution" in allicin. Pending further investigation, he
questions the doctor's claims.</p>
<p>Eating Well, a food journal with a nose for news, had its
doubts about Dr. Sakai Garlic, too. So a staffer smothered
bread with it for six volunteer eaters and conducted an
informal smell test. The surprise, reported among Eating
Well's product reviews: In five of the six, brush-'em-back
breath "disappeared" within an hour. But the journal noted
that the product was "slightly milder" than ordinary garlic
and cost three times as much.</p>
<p>A Buddhist priest swears by it. He wrote Mr. Sakai a
thank-you note. Finally, he said, he could eat garlic before
his daily chanting sessions without fear of alienating
worshippers.</p>
<p>But whether it works or not, a lot of people put no-smell
garlic in the same league as colorized movies or alcohol-free
wine. Lloyd Harris is author of the Book of Garlic and
founder of a Berkeley, Calif.-based club called Lovers of the
Stinking Rose. He says bulb tinkering smacks of the "white
bread syndrome."</p>
<p>"It's the aftermath of garlic that helps to make it a
celebrated experience, that enables you to linger over it, so
to speak," he sniffs.</p>
<p>Despite such nay-sayers, Ms. Bybee expects to break into
the black for the first time this year, on sales of about $1
million. Mr. Sakai hopes for even faster sales, but Ms. Bybee
says he may underestimate the breadth of the country. "To
conquer every state takes time," she says.</p>
<p>New York has been a hard market to crack, she says, but
sales are brisk in Chicago. "Our product is like a cult
product," says Jack Kazanchy, a manager at Jewel Rina. "It's
sort of underground. People hear about it," appropriately,
"by word-of-mouth."</p>
