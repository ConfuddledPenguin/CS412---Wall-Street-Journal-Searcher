	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A steady decline in stock market prices since
the Middle East crisis began has led a number of companies to
start or extend stock repurchase programs hoping to snatch
their own shares at bargain prices.
   The companies believe the buy-backs will bolster the value
of the stocks in a stock market that has been battered by
Mideast events and investor fears of a recession.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But some companies that had announced buy-back programs
stayed away yesterday because of the market rally.</p>
<p>Russell Banks, chief executive officer of Grow Group Inc.,
a New York-based chemical concern, said the board approved a
750,000-share buy-back in response to the market drop, but no
shares had been purchased because of the rally. The shares
closed yesterday at $7.50, up 37.5 cents, in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading; in July, they traded as high as
$10.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, companies continued to take advantage of
deflated prices yesterday. Liz Claiborne Inc., a New York
apparel retailer, expanded its buy-back and National Pizza
Co., a fast-food chain based in Pittsburg, Kan., said
yesterday it would begin one.</p>
<p>"We think it's a good use of our available cash," said Sam
Miller, chief financial officer for Liz Claiborne, which is
planning to buy back as much as an additional $50 million in
stock. "This should improve our earnings per share and
improve the stock price for our remaining shareholders."</p>
<p>Liz Claiborne closed at $27.50 yesterday, up $1.75, in
national over-the-counter trading. Before the market
rebounded yesterday, Liz Claiborne stock closed at $25.75 a
share Friday, down from $30.75 a share Aug. 1, the day before
Iraq invaded Kuwait.</p>
<p>Since Aug. 1, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had
declined 366 points before rebounding Monday.</p>
<p>National Pizza also took advantage of deflated prices to
initiate its buy-back and in turn watch its stock rise
yesterday. In national over-the-counter trading, National
Pizza closed at $17.75, up from $17 a share Friday, but still
down from $21 a share on Aug. 1.</p>
<p>"At recent price levels our common stock represents an
excellent investment," said Gene Bicknell, chief executive of
National Pizza, which is planning to repurchase as many as
one million shares, or 7.1% of its common outstanding.</p>
<p>Liz Claiborne and National Pizza join more than 50
companies that have announced repurchase programs in the last
week.</p>
<p>Among others, A.O. Smith Corp., a maker of auto, truck and
farm equipment, dusted off its 1987 authorization last week,
to repurchase $7.5 million in stocks while Hasbro Inc., a
Pawtucket, R.I., toymaker, said its board approved the
buy-back of as many as three million shares.</p>
<p>Intel Corp., citing the market's "rapid retreat" and an
opportunity to buy back shares at "attractive levels,"
announced Aug. 23 that it would buy back 20 million shares.</p>
<p>Since the announcement, Intel stock rose to $36.25 a share
at close of national over-the-counter trading yesterday. That
was up from $32.125 a share before the announcement, but
still down from $42.50 a share Aug. 1.</p>
<p>Of course not all companies have the financial wherewithal
to take advantage of deflated stock prices. "Not everyone has
the flexibility to do it," said Liz Claiborne's Mr. Miller.</p>
<p>Other companies that are extending or starting buy-back
programs include Nalco Chemical Co., Naperville, Ill. (one
million additional shares); PacificCare Health Systems Inc.,
Cypress, Calif. (500,000 shares); and Dress Barn Inc.,
Stamford, Conn. (two million shares)</p>
<p>Yesterday, Jan Bell Marketing Inc., a Sunrise, Fla.,
designer and maker of jewelry, said it will buy back as much
as 10% of the 22.6 million shares outstanding, while First
Chattanooga Financial Corp., a thrift holding company in
Chattanooga, Tenn., said its board approved spending an
additional $2.5 million on top of $1.5 million to repurchase
stock. Blount Inc., a manufacturing and construction concern,
said it also plans to buy back as many as 300,000 Class A
common shares, or 4% of shares outstanding.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Corrections & Amplifications</p>
<p>GROW GROUP Inc. plans to buy back 250,000 of its shares.
The number of shares was overstated in yesterday's edition.</p>
