	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Great American Management & Investment Inc.
declared a cash dividend of 83.6 cents a share for its
minority holders as a way to get out of the savings and loan
business.
   In an unusual step, Great American concurrently declared
"a dividend paid in property" of all the shares in a Florida
thrift it owns, to a controlling partnership headed by Great
American's chairman.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Both dividends are payable tomorrow to holders of record
last Friday.</p>
<p>The thrift, Firstate Financial A Savings Bank in Orlando,
Fla., now will be owned by Equity Holdings Ltd., which is the
majority shareholder in Great American. Equity Holdings is
owned by Great American Chairman Samuel Zell and the estate
of his late business partner, Robert Lurie.</p>
<p>"Great American feels that being in the S&L business today
is looked at in a negative light," said company vice
president Susan Obuchowski. "It could hurt Great American in
any kind of refinancing or equity offering. The company
thought it was in its best interests to no longer be in the
savings and loan business."</p>
<p>Ms. Obuchowski said the Orlando thrift, with assets of
$210 million, isn't encountering financial difficulty. The
move, she said, was designed to relieve Great American of any
unpleasant associations with the national savings and loan
bailout.</p>
<p>The dividend to minority shareholders in Great American
was calculated to be equal on a value-per-share basis, to the
Orlando thrift the partnership received.</p>
