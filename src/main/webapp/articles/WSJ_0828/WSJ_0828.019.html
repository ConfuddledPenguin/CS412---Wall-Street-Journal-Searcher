	<p class="article-leader">MORE CONFRONTATION is assured in labor relations.
   That's the outlook for the year ahead as Labor Day nears,
labor and management people agree. Fights will heat up
further over job cuts, manufacturers doing work abroad or
employers pushing harder to compete in world markets, say
union locals and many companies. Unless more job security is
achieved, at a time of big layoffs, "it's gonna come to an
all-out war," says James "Whitey" Hale, head of UAW Local 326
in Flint, Mich.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Unions will resist sales quotas as production goals become
"a forced condition" for employment, says Carter Hawley Hale
Stores. Unions will try to change labor laws, and both sides
will debate paying health care costs, says Tenneco. The Oil,
Chemical and Atomic Workers union sees worker training and
the skills of temporary workers as "critical battlegrounds."
The union says, "It's still us and them."</p>
<p>Relations will be more strained for a while, but "the
survivors will get over it," a Federal-Mogul official says.</p>
<p>A NEW CONNECTICUT LAW targets construction-firm cheaters.</p>
<p>Companies that lose contracts can sue winning bidders who
evade paying unemployment and workers' compensation, under a
law taking effect Oct. 1. James Lohr, director of the
Carpentry Industry Partnership, a labor-industry group based
in Norwalk, says such practices are "a severe problem for
legitimate contractors" who make the required payments.</p>
<p>"I can now make the enforcement people do their job," says
Michael Hobbs, a New Canaan contractor. The IRS says that at
least $1.6 billion a year in tax revenue has been lost
nationally; it estimates that 38% of employers misclassify
workers as contractors, avoiding unemployment, workers'
compensation and Social Security taxes. Joint union-industry
groups in California and Illinois show interest in similar
legislation.</p>
<p>MANY EMPLOYERS refuse to pay reservists' health costs.</p>
<p>Fully 18 of 29 employers polled by consultant Hewitt
Associates said they won't continue medical benefits for
employees called to military duty in the Middle East crisis,
or will do so just for dependents. Over half of 52 firms
surveyed by consultant Towers Perrin will halt medical
benefits for both reservists and dependents.</p>
<p>The IRS, whose tax rulings influence federal benefits
policy, will decide soon whether an employer must continue
dependents' health coverage if the reservist wants, as
benefits law ordinarily requires when an employee leaves a
firm. The Pentagon insists employers have the same obligation
for called-up reservists, but the IRS has argued that the
military's Champus medical plan must pick up the dependent
costs, says consultant William M. Mercer.</p>
<p>Champus is cheaper for reservists than continued employer
coverage, but doesn't cover the cost of dental work, among
other problems.</p>
<p>IRV FLETCHER GOES EAST: The Oregon AFL-CIO president,
seeking support of labor leaders for old-growth-timber
cutting, hits New York this week. He'll warn that federal
policy to protect the northern spotted owl may mean reduced
lumber supply, higher housing costs in New York and other
places, and lower government timberland sale revenues.</p>
<p>SOME 154 TEAMSTERS officials made over $100,000 in
salaries, bonuses and expenses in 1989, and 20 topped
$200,000, a dissident group says, citing reports to the Labor
Department. The leader was Harold Friedman of Cleveland, who
got $1.4 million for five union posts; he was convicted last
year of racketeering and embezzling union funds.</p>
<p>WORRIED OVER COMPETITION, the insurance industry works
hard to curb labor costs. In a study by consultant Hay Group
including 615 companies, 70% of 47 insurance firms raised
their workers' share of health-care premiums, compared with
44% overall. Some 30% of insurers cut work forces by 5% or
more last year; only 13% of companies generally made such
cuts.</p>
<p>EXECUTIVE RECRUITERS scramble, in a more competitive
market.</p>
<p>Search firms boost the time during which they'll find a
replacement, at no fee, for a placed manager who doesn't work
out, to an average of over nine months, says the National
Association of Executive Recruiters. More fired financial and
other executives are job-hunting these days. Many send
resumes directly, R.R. Donnelley & Sons and Super Valu Stores
say. Simon & Schuster often skips searchers for midlevel
jobs.</p>
<p>Less business means firms must "fight harder" to satisfy
employers, says Colin Hanna, president of the Cheshire Group,
a searcher. "Hungry" firms "call me every day," some offering
fee cuts, a BellSouth official says. They're "pushier," says
Quantum Chemical. Dennis Mummert, a Tampa, Fla., recruiter,
forgoes some added fees that he usually gets when a placed
executive's salary exceeds the estimate.</p>
<p>But placement consultant James Challenger says fired
managers are getting new jobs at near-record speed.</p>
<p>THE CHECKOFF: Postal Service bargaining with its biggest
unions on a new, three-year contract starts today. . . . A
total of 85% of 501 human-resource executives polled by
consultant Right Associates foresee a worker-supply crisis,
up from 76% last year. . . . The Commonwealth Fund pays for
joint business-nursing degrees at 10 colleges, aimed at
easing a shortage of nurses in management jobs.</p>
