	<p class="article-leader">CHESTNUT HILL, Mass. -- General Cinema Corp., citing lower
attendance at summer movies and reduced interest income,
posted a 78% drop in fiscal third-quarter profit.
   The specialty retailer and operator of cinemas reported
that earnings for the quarter ended July 31 fell to $5.7
million, or 8 cents a share, from $25.6 million, or 35 cents
a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 3% to $506 million from
$491.3 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company said its lower profit for the latest quarter
reflected a 46% drop in earnings from interest and dividends,
to $22.3 million from $41.4 million a year ago. The drop
stemmed from a reduction in the company's investable funds to
$1.1 billion from $1.7 billion, which resulted from a
capital-gains tax payment of about $600 million that General
Cinema made in January. The company said the tax payment
related to the sale of its soft-drink bottling business.</p>
<p>General Cinema said revenue rose but operating earnings
fell slightly from its 60%-owned Neiman Marcus Group unit.
The company added that its Horchow Mail Order business had a
"substantial loss" in the third quarter, and that its
Bergdorf Goodman unit had lower operating earnings due to "a
softening retail environment in New York City" and expenses
associated with opening a new store.</p>
<p>The company said that during the third quarter, revenues
and operating earnings from its General Cinema Theatres
division fell to $1.3 million from $12.2 million a year
earlier. The division's results reflected lower attendance
levels at summer pictures, which "this year did not attract
the number of patrons which the industry had been
anticipating," the company said.</p>
<p>General Cinema said the theater division's "situation will
likely continue" through the fiscal fourth quarter,
"resulting in a substantial operating loss by the theater
division for that period and for the full year." In fiscal
1989, the division had operating earnings of $9.2 million, a
spokesman said.</p>
<p>For the nine months, General Cinema earned $55.6 million,
or 75 cents a share, from continuing operations, compared
with $98 million, or $1.33 a share, a year earlier. In the
period a year earlier, revenue of $10.8 million from
discontinued operations and a gain of $855.1 million from the
sale of the operations made net income $963.9 million, or
$13.06 a share. Revenue rose 14% to $1.67 billion from $1.47
billion.</p>
