	<p class="article-leader">BOISE, Idaho -- Albertson's Inc. reported net income
increased 16% to $52.9 million, or 40 cents a share, for its
second quarter ended Aug. 2.
   Sales rose 14% to $2.07 billion, although year-earlier
results were slightly depressed by a strike by workers at 34
of its stores in the Seattle, Wash., area. The company
estimated that sales would have increased by only 7.7% if the
strike had not occurred.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the year-earlier period, the company earned $45.6
million, or 34 cents a share, on sales of $1.8 billion.</p>
<p>Albertson's operates 523 grocery stores in 16 states.</p>
