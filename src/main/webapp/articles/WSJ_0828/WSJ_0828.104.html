	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- A shareholder sued Medco Research Inc.,
alleging the company misled investors into thinking it might
soon be sold.
   In a complaint seeking class-action status in federal
court here, Thomas Duffy also alleged that William C. Govier,
Medco executive vice president, sold 41,000 shares of the
company's stock at between $18 and $20 a share just before
share prices dropped sharply.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Last November, Medco retained Oppenheimer & Co. to advise
it on maximizing shareholder value through a possible sale.
No one expressed an interest in buying the Los Angeles-based
drug formula licensor, but Medco announced that several
companies were reviewing the possibility, the complaint said.</p>
<p>Mr. Govier allegedly sold his shares between March 12 and
March 27 this year knowing that no one had expressed an
interest in acquiring Medco. The Medco share price dropped
$3.75 to $15.75 on March 30, the complaint said. Yesterday,
Medco was quoted at $9.75 bid over the counter, up 62.5 cents
from Friday.</p>
<p>The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages. Also named as
defendants are Mr. Govier; Manfred Mosk, Medco's chief
executive officer; and Sanford J. Hillsberg, the company's
general counsel.</p>
<p>Neither Medco nor its officials named in the suit could be
reached for comment.</p>
