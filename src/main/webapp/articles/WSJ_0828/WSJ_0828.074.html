	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Consumer confidence sank to a seven-year low
as the index compiled by the Conference Board plunged almost
18 points to 83.8 in August from July's 101.7.
   The index is now 31 points below the year-ago period and
the decline steeper than that registered immediately after
the October 1987 stock market crash.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Fabian Linden, executive director of the board's consumer
research center, said that a recession is more likely now
than it has been in many years, given the economic
uncertainties in the Middle East.</p>
<p>While consumer confidence has been edging down since the
year began, in this latest survey consumers expressed
increasing concern about current economic conditions and a
marked pessimism in their expectations for the next six
months. The monthly survey, conducted for the Conference
Board by National Family Opinion Inc. of Toledo, Ohio, uses
1985 as a base year of 100 for the index and covers 5,000
households throughout the U.S.</p>
<p>The proportion of consumers who feel conditions are "bad"
rose three points to almost 24%; those who feel conditions
are "good," fell three points to 20%. Almost 19% of those
surveyed fear conditions will worsen in the next six months,
up from 12% in July.</p>
<p>Opinions about employment were especially gloomy. Still,
buying plans retreated only modestly, the board said, citing
respondents' plans for buying homes and cars.</p>
