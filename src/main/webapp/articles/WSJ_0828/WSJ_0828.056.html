	<p class="article-leader">JAPANESE CAR PROJECT</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Japan's Nissan Motor Co. and Hitachi Ltd. are studying the
possibility of creating a new company to develop and
manufacture high-grade, next-generation information systems
for automobiles.</p>
<p>Potential projects include facsimile machines, navigation
systems and digital-telephone and other services to be built
into Nissan automobiles, the two companies said. A Nissan
spokesman said the field is sure to boom, noting that other
Japanese car makers seem to be pursuing similar joint
projects with electronics and communications companies.</p>
<p>Plans haven't yet reached the stage that company
capitalization or an establishment date has been decided, or
that both parties have committed to working together,
spokesmen from Nissan and Hitachi said.</p>
<p>Hitachi's spokesman said that the company's average annual
sales of automobile-related electronics equipment total
roughly 200 billion yen ($1.37 billion).</p>
<p>EUROPEAN CFC AGREEMENT</p>
<p>Seven chemical companies with European operations signed
an agreement with the European Community to reduce the
amounts of atmosphere-damaging chlorinated fluorocarbons used
in foam plastics. The European Isocyanate Producers
Association said the CFC content of foam plastics should be
reduced by 35% by the end of 1991 and by 65% by the end of
1993; the figures are relative to the amounts of CFCs in foam
plastics in 1986. The seven companies are BASF AG, Bayer AG,
Dow Chemical Co., Imperial Chemical Industries PLC,
Montedison Petrolchimica, Rhone-Poulenc S.A. and Royal
Dutch/Shell.</p>
<p>GLOOM IN TAIWAN</p>
<p>Over 70% of Taiwan's business leaders are gloomy about the
local economy during the second half of the year, Taiwan's
Gallup poll reported. The poll was conducted from Aug. 14 to
Aug. 17 with 1,092 managers of selected enterprises in the
country. The survey showed 63.7% of interviewees were
pessimistic and 8.1% were very pessimistic about Taiwan's
economic performance from July through December. Plunging
share prices, rising crime, political instability and a
slowdown in the world economy contributed to the pessimism,
economists said.</p>
<p>DOMINICAN REPUBLIC STRIKE CALL</p>
<p>Labor unions in the Dominican Republic issued a call for a
72-hour general strike beginning Sept. 10. Union officials
said the strike would be a protest against the government's
new economic-austerity program. Workers are also demanding a
150% wage increase, a cut and freeze in food prices, a
solution to energy shortages and reinstatement of 64 labor
activists dismissed from the state-owned Dominican Electric
Corp.</p>
<p>MRS. MARCOS'S REQUEST</p>
<p>Imelda Marcos asked a Philippine anti-graft court to
dismiss ill-gotten-wealth cases filed against her by the
government of President Corazon Aquino. Mrs. Marcos's lawyer
in Manila, Sergio Apostol, filed a motion with the court that
said the former first lady enjoys immunity because she was
following the orders of her husband during his 20-year rule
over the country. Government lawyers opposed Mr. Apostol's
motion. No decision was immediately taken by the three-man
panel of judges.</p>
<p>SOUTH KOREA'S ENERGY PLAN</p>
<p>South Korea will introduce an energy-conservation program,
effective next month, that seeks to cut the nation's energy
consumption by 10%, government officials said. Tourist
hotels, hospitals, railroad stations and other public
facilities would be exempt from the restrictions, they said.
Under the program, elevators would stop at every other floor
and factories and offices would be banned from using
incandescent lamps. The use of outdoor neon signs would be
restricted between midnight and sunset the following day.
Movie theaters wouldn't be allowed to operate after midnight.</p>
<p>INDONESIA LIMITS CENSORSHIP</p>
<p>Indonesia said it was ending press censorship unless
national security was at risk.</p>
<p>"Reporters are no longer restricted. They can write any
news as long as it does not violate the code of ethics of the
Indonesian Journalists' Association and national interests,"
Coordinating Minister for Politics and Security Sudomo said.
He was quoted as telling the Merdeka newspaper group the
issue was discussed at a security meeting last week.</p>
<p>President Suharto's government has kept tight control of
the domestic press and recently embarked on its toughest
censorship of the foreign media in more than two years. But
under the new rules, articles in foreign newspapers would no
longer be blacked out.</p>
<p>Editors received the news with some skepticism. "So far
it's just a statement. . . . The important thing is what is
the reality," said one.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>The grandson of Josef Stalin will portray the dictator in
"War Is War for Everyone," a new Soviet film about World War
II, the Communist Party newspaper Pravda reported. The
grandson, Yevgeny Djugashvili, is a professor at a military
academy. . . . The British Broadcasting Corp. launched Radio
5, its first new national radio network in 23 years.
Programming is geared toward younger listeners, with an
emphasis on sports, entertainment and education.</p>
