	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Stotler Group Inc., the troubled futures
concern, admitted it couldn't solve its financial problems
and filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition at the federal
Bankruptcy Court here.
   The move, which was expected, came three weeks after
commodity funds managed by Stotler forced the company into
involuntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, claiming
Stotler owed them more than $5 million. It was the latest
wrinkle in the collapse of the futures brokerage firm linked
to former Chicago Board of Trade Chairman Karsten Mahlmann.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the bankrupt firm is liquidated
after the courts have determined that reorganization isn't
worthwhile; creditors often receive a fraction of their
claims, and stockholders typically get nothing. In a Chapter
11 proceeding, the company is reorganized and continues to
operate; security holders often get a reduced ownership
position.</p>
<p>Stotler's troubles came to light last month with the
disclosure that it failed to meet Chicago Board of Trade
capital requirements. Mr. Mahlmann, who was Stotler's
chairman, has said he wasn't involved in the firm's daily
operations. But he became the first CBOT chairman in 130
years to resign from the nation's largest futures exchange.</p>
<p>Stotler President Thomas M. Egan said in a statement
Friday that "it is now in the best interests of all creditors
that the further administration of these companies' affairs
be handled in an orderly manner by the bankruptcy court, in
accordance with bankruptcy laws." He added that "a return to
the shareholders of Stotler Group appears unlikely."</p>
<p>Stotler also said it offered to settle Securities and
Exchange Commission charges related to its failure to
maintain sufficient capital, without admitting or denying the
agency's findings.</p>
