	<p class="article-leader">VLSI Technology Inc., San Jose, Calif., said it expects to
report a loss and lower revenue for the third quarter.
   The semiconductor maker said the loss will mainly be the
result of a decision to withdraw from a segment of the
memory-chip business. It said the withdrawal from the static
random-access memory business will result in a one-time
charge to operations of $12 million to $15 million against
third-quarter results.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>VLSI also said it will lay off about 100 of its 2,000
employees between now and the end of the quarter.</p>
<p>Revenue is running below expectations because of declines
in demand for older products, VLSI said.</p>
