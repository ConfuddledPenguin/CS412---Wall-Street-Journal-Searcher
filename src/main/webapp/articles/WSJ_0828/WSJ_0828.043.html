	<p class="article-leader">KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine -- The U.S. turned tougher in its
diplomatic maneuverings toward Iraq, as the State Department
expelled some Iraqi diplomats and President Bush staked out
an uncompromising position for talks with Baghdad.
   The developments indicate that, while international
attention remains focused on diplomatic rather than military
developments in the Persian Gulf crisis for now, the
prospects that diplomacy can succeed appear bleaker than they
looked over the weekend.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In its first direct diplomatic retaliation against Iraq,
the U.S. ordered the size of Iraq's diplomatic contingent in
Washington slashed by two-thirds. The step was taken in
response to Iraq's attempt to shut down the American embassy
in occupied Kuwait by surrounding it with troops and shutting
off its electricity and water.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, President Bush voiced little hope that new
efforts to resolve the confrontation through negotiations
will bear fruit. Mr. Bush endorsed plans by United Nations
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to meet Iraqi
Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz this week, but indicated that the
U.S. doesn't want the U.N. official to discuss anything
except an unconditional Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.</p>
<p>"Saddam Hussein has been so resistant to complying with
international law that I don't yet see fruitful
negotiations," Mr. Bush told reporters at his vacation home
here after a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney. Asked whether he is more hopeful there will be a
diplomatic solution to the crisis than he was two weeks ago,
Mr. Bush replied: "I don't particularly see more hope now,
because it's so clear what the world is demanding of Saddam
Hussein. Clearly the objectives remain the same."</p>
<p>The president said it is "inconceivable" that Mr. Perez de
Cuellar would discuss anything beyond Iraqi compliance with
United Nations resolutions demanding an unconditional
withdrawal from Kuwait and release of foreigners being
detained in Iraq and Kuwait. "Clearly we would oppose any
compromise on these fundamental principles that have been
laid down by the United Nations," Mr. Bush said.</p>
<p>Despite the increased diplomatic tensions, there continued
to be signs that the U.S. and Iraq are trying to avoid
military conflict for the moment. Iraq ordered at least one
captain of an oil tanker in recent days not to defy the
international naval blockade of trade with Iraq, according to
U.S. officials. But they said they were unsure that the
incident reflected any broader Iraqi decision on how to
handle the blockage.</p>
<p>For his part, Mr. Bush indicated again that he hopes
economic sanctions against Iraq will inflict so much pain on
Saddam Hussein's regime that it will choose to withdraw from
Kuwait to ease the pressure. "My policy is to do everything
we can, working with other nations, to enforce the
sanctions," he said.</p>
<p>The administration's order expelling Iraqi diplomatic
personnel represented an attempt to lodge a highly visible
protest against Iraq's treatment of American diplomats in
Kuwait -- without going so far as to block avenues of
communication with Baghdad. The State Department announced
that it is ordering Iraq to cut the staff at the Iraqi
embassy in Washington to 19 from 55. Seven diplomats,
including all those who deal with commercial affairs, and 29
non-diplomatic staff members are being forced to leave, said
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.</p>
<p>In addition, the U.S. is prohibiting the Iraqi diplomats
who remain in Washington from traveling beyond a 25-mile
radius of the city. The Bush administration clearly hopes
that other nations will follow its lead and expel some Iraqi
diplomats, but Ms. Tutwiler said only that the U.S. has
"indications" other nations will follow suit.</p>
<p>The U.S. is particularly angered by Iraq's treatment of
American diplomats after Iraqi officials ordered embassies in
Kuwait closed last week. A small group of diplomats remaining
in the embassy in defiance of that order are basically under
siege, and another group of diplomats who left the embassy
for Iraq are being refused the right to leave Iraq to return
to the U.S. A group of 52 dependents of American diplomats
based in Iraq were allowed to leave Iraq this week, but three
male dependents over the age of 18 were stopped at the
Iraqi-Turkish border as they were about to leave and forced
back to Baghdad.</p>
<p>In addition, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
that 63 other Americans are missing or being held by Iraqi
officials -- 41 in Iraq and 22 in Kuwait.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush clearly wants to keep diplomatic channels to Iraq
open. After his meeting with Mr. Mulroney, he insisted that
Iraq is free to discuss the Gulf crisis with America's top
diplomat in Baghdad. "I'm not saying we're not going to
talk," Mr. Bush said.</p>
<p>But the president also suggested that there's little to
talk about until Iraq withdraws its troops from Kuwait and
the ousted Kuwaiti government is restored to power. "The
position of the international law is not negotiable," he
said. "The United Nations has spoken, country after country
supporting the action taken by the Security Council. So
there's no room for compromise or negotiation on that point."</p>
<p>All told, Mr. Bush's comments and remarks by his aides in
recent days suggest that the administration is willing to let
others explore the possibilities of a diplomatic solution to
the Gulf crisis for a while, now that the U.S. has helped
assemble a significant military force and won sweeping U.N.
legal sanctions against Iraq. But Mr. Bush's tough tone about
the limits of diplomatic discussions is a signal that the
U.S. won't be drawn for now into any bargaining with Saddam
Hussein.</p>
<p>It's likely that Mr. Bush plans to underscore his views
personally to the U.N.'s Mr. Perez de Cuellar. The president
is scheduled to talk with the secretary-general by phone
before Mr. Perez de Cuellar meets Iraq's foreign minister in
Jordan on Thursday.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush plans to take a break from his Maine vacation
today for meetings in Washington on the Gulf crisis. He is
due to meet with some 150 members of Congress to discuss the
crisis, and he then plans to spend Wednesday and Thursday in
meetings and briefings on the Gulf situation as well as
coming budget negotiations with Congress. He is set to return
here Thursday night for the long Labor Day weekend.</p>
