	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Investors went on a stock-and-bond buying
spree, cheered by rising optimism for a peaceful solution to
the Mideast crisis.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average leaped 78.71 points --
the biggest this year -- in moderately active trading to
close at 2611.63. The gain followed a 49.50-point increase
Friday. The advance for the past two sessions totals 128.21
points, or 5.2%, cutting the market's decline since Iraq
invaded Kuwait to 10%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Bond prices jumped sharply before the U.S. stock market
opened and stayed high, largely on positive Mideast news and
falling oil prices. The dollar continued its decline; many
traders bought yen because the drop in oil prices helps the
economy of energy-importing Japan.</p>
<p>Adding to rallies in bonds and stocks were big declines in
gold and oil prices: The October futures contract for crude
oil sank $4 a barrel to close at $26.91. Gold plunged $26.70
an ounce to $388.30, the steepest one-day decline in more
than seven years.</p>
<p>Investors were emboldened by the fact that war didn't
break out in the Mideast over the weekend and by news that
Iraq agreed to meet with the United Nations' secretary
general Thursday, rekindling hopes for a diplomatic
settlement. The perception of easing Mideast tensions first
sparked rallies in stock markets overseas. Those gains, in
turn, helped extend the bargain-hunting frenzy that began in
the U.S. Friday.</p>
<p>Analysts discounted the influence on the stock and bond
markets of a report that the Federal Reserve is ready to cut
interest rates to prevent the U.S. from slipping into a
recession. Byron Wien, chief U.S. investment strategist at
Morgan Stanley, said the failure of war to erupt cleared the
way for investors to pick up where they left off Friday.</p>
<p>Since the sharp decline in prices Thursday, stocks have
remained relatively cheap, Mr. Wien said. Combined with the
positive tenor of news out of the Mideast, those low prices
looked especially attractive yesterday, he said.</p>
<p>"The embargo seems to be working," Mr. Wien said, "and it
looks like we're moving toward a negotiated settlement. The
market interprets anything other than shooting as positive."</p>
<p>Marjorie Corp, fund manager at One Federal Asset
Management, Boston, said that at first the rally "appeared to
be concentrated in the names that were strong before the
invasion. We're not seeing any new direction or leadership."
Indeed, among yesterday's big gainers were PepsiCo,
Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson and Merck --
stocks of consumer companies that many investors consider
strong enough to withstand severe profit erosions should a
recession materialize.</p>
<p>But the rally broadened during the day and by the close
most stock-market barometers registered proportionally
similar gains.</p>
<p>"What propelled the buying," said Ted Eggert, equity
research manager at Yamaichi International, "were plunging
oil prices, rising bond prices and all these tips and clues
about a lowering temperature in the Middle East."</p>
<p>Brian Fabbri, chief economist at Midland Montagu
Economics, noted that bond prices took off initially in
Japan, helped by the rebound in the Japanese stock market.</p>
<p>Part of what boosted bond prices further throughout the
day was the positive effect of investors buying back bonds
they had sold Friday as a hedge against potentially plunging
prices if hostilities had broken out in the Mideast over the
weekend. But the major impetus was falling oil and gold
prices. Long-term U.S. Treasury bond prices rose more than 1
1/2 points, or more than $15 for each $1,000 of face amount,
in light trading.</p>
<p>"I'm just amazed with gold down as much as it was that
bonds didn't go even higher," said Roberta Olson, fixed
income portfolio manager at Banc One Asset Management,
Columbus, Ohio.</p>
<p>While some analysts expected the report of imminent
interest-rate easing in the U.S. to hurt the dollar, not all
traders paid that much attention to it. Ian Foakes, foreign
exchange manager at PaineWebber International, said the
report had no influence on his trading activity. Most of the
day's activity was focused on selling Swiss francs and marks
to buy yen. That move was a bet that oil prices will fall,
giving the import-dependent Japanese economy a lift.</p>
<p>"Frankly," Mr. Foakes said, "the currency market is
trading like a second-stage-of-development animal -- it's all
herd instinct."</p>
<p>In major market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices rose sharply. Volume was 160.2 million shares
on the New York Stock Exchange, where advancing issues far
outnumbered decliners, 1,453 to 256.
</p>
<p>Bond prices jumped. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond fell to 8.99%.</p>
<p>The dollar fell. In late New York trading, the currency
was quoted at 1.5510 marks and 144.25 yen, compared with
1.5605 marks and 146.70 yen Friday.</p>
