	<p class="article-leader">Philip Morris Cos. plans to relocate about 500 of its
1,700 Manhattan employees to Rye Brook in Westchester County.
   The New York-based tobacco, food and brewing company said
its main offices at 120 Park Avenue near 41st Street have
become overcrowded. And its lease on additional space at 100
Park expires in September 1991.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The headquarters of two subsidiaries will be moving; they
are the Philip Morris International tobacco operations and
Philip Morris Capital Corp. financial-services unit.</p>
<p>The move, which will begin later this year, is expected to
take a year to complete, Philip Morris said. The company,
which employs 150,000 world-wide, owns a building in Rye
Brook; the Kraft General Foods International unit already is
headquartered there.</p>
