	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The dollar steadied after two days of broad
declines and as the Treasury's long-awaited debt auction got
under way.
   The auction, which stretches over three days, instilled
caution in market participants. Also inhibiting major
position-taking was the scheduled release Friday of data on
U.S. retail sales and producer prices for April, traders
said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Gillie Augeri, vice president and chief dealer at
Connecticut National Bank in Hartford, said traders generally
expect the $30.5 billion Treasury refunding to go well but
are reluctant to move prior to learning the outcome.</p>
<p>Amid sluggish dollar dealings, activity in non-dollar
exchange rates, particularly the mark-yen cross rate, drew
attention, traders said.</p>
<p>The dollar slipped against the yen in response to buying
of the Japanese unit against the mark, dealers said. The West
German currency was seen correcting a bit against the yen
after a rise Monday in New York to 95.52 yen, participants
said. The mark ended yesterday's New York trading at 95.12
yen.</p>
<p>The $10.5 billion of three-year notes auctioned yesterday
brought an average 8.74% yield, the Treasury announced. The
result, which was in line with expectations, came too late to
affect foreign exchange trading. Preliminary indications
showed good participation by Japanese investors.</p>
<p>The Treasury will sell $10 billion of 10-year bonds today,
followed by the sale of $10 billion of 30-year notes
tomorrow.</p>
<p>The dollar posted a modest gain against the mark on a
slight squeeze of short positions that developed in the wake
of the U.S. unit's two days of declines against the West
German currency, said Valerie Walker, vice president and
corporate foreign exchange manager at Harris Trust & Savings
Bank in New York.</p>
<p>The market is still bearish on the U.S. unit, Ms. Walker
said. Many of those who were squeezed out of their short
positions yesterday are merely waiting for the dollar to fall
to 1.6470 marks before selling it once again, she said.</p>
<p>In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 1.6573 marks, up from 1.6558 marks late Monday, and at
157.62 yen, down from 158.19 yen late Monday. Sterling was
quoted at $1.6705, up from $1.6685 Monday.</p>
<p>In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the U.S. currency was
quoted at 157.30 yen, down from Tuesday's Tokyo close of
158.05 yen. Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at about 1.6575
marks.</p>
<p>The dollar still is suffering from a more pessimistic view
of the U.S. economy after last Friday's disappointing
employment report, said Morris Armstrong, vice president and
manager of foreign exchange at Girozentrale Vienna.</p>
<p>"We have a situation now where you have inflation and no
growth," Mr. Armstrong said, referring to the combination of
Friday's disappointing employment numbers and the rising
inflation shown in the report on first-quarter gross national
product.</p>
<p>In contrast to Ms. Walker, though, Mr. Armstrong said the
dollar seems to have found a comfortable trading area at
current levels against the mark and yen. It must be
remembered that the dollar's lower level against both
currencies is still within trading bands seen this year and
"the more the dollar stays in these (bands), the more you
have to believe it's in equilibrium," he said.</p>
<p>Despite the gains made by the yen against the dollar and
the mark, Ms. Walker, Mr. Armstrong and others said the
Japanese currency won't strengthen appreciably in the absence
of a rise in Japanese interest rates.</p>
<p>Comments by French Economics Minister Pierre Beregovoy
that Group of Seven monetary officials believe the yen
shouldn't decline any further were brushed off by the market,
said Girozentrale's Mr. Armstrong.</p>
<p>With a net outflow of capital from Japan and no rise in
Japanese interest rates, "there's no reason to send the yen
higher right now," he said.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $370 an ounce, down $1.90. Estimated
volume was a moderate 2.5 million ounces.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was quoted at $370.70 an
ounce.</p>
