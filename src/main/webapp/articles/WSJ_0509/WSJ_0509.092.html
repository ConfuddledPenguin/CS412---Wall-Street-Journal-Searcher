   . . . But Don't Call Him a Greenmailer</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">Takao Matsuura and his New York public-relations men did a
beautiful job of portraying me as a greenmailer ("Boone-San,
Either Put Up or Shut Up," editorial page, April 18):
However, in his rather unusual editorial opinion, he forgot
to mention one thing -- I've never asked Koito, or any other
company, for greenmail, and I've never taken it.
   You may recall Mr. Matsuura is an employee at Tokyo-based
Koito Manufacturing Co., where I am the largest stockholder
with 26% ownership. For more than a year now, I've pressed
for ownership rights, asking for board representation and
access to financial information. I've been shut out at every
turn.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>I have even attempted to once and for all put an end to
Mr. Matsuura's greenmail paranoia. In March I submitted an
anti-greenmail resolution to Koito, proposing that the
directors adopt it into the corporate charter. Mr. Matsuura
never acknowledged my proposal.</p>
<p>We've come a long way with shareholder rights in corporate
America. Can you imagine an American CEO telling the largest
shareholder to "put up or shut up?" Mr. Matsuura can get away
with such a statement because his company is not accountable
to the real owners -- the stockholders. Koito is a member of
Toyota's "keiretsu", or cartel, so stockholder rights are not
taken seriously.</p>
<p>In our battle with Koito and Toyota, we are exposing a
rigged Japanese system, and we are revealing how it unfairly
competes with corporate America. We are clearly on the right
side of the issue. I'll be on my way to Japan again in June
for Koito's annual stockholders meeting.</p>

<p>What puzzles me is why Mr. Matsuura is afraid of allowing
Mr. Pickens a seat on his board. A "raider" is a shareholder.
Yet Mr. Matsuura feels Mr. Pickens will bring harm to the
very company he now owns. Why would Mr. Pickens take actions
to jeopardize his substantial investment in Mr. Matsuura's
company (by Mr. Matsuura's estimate, $840 million)? Besides,
what is good for Mr. Pickens is good for the other
shareholders as well.</p>
<p>Reflect back on Unocal. Fred Hartley, who was in the same
position as Mr. Matsuura, claimed he was looking out for his
shareholders' best interest when he launched a stock-buy-back
program by borrowing heavily. What he did was turn Unocal's
balance sheet upside down and put the Employee Stock
Ownership Plan at risk in the process. Why? Because Mr.
Pickens became a shareholder.</p>
<p>How did Mr. Hartley's decision enhance shareholder value?
Mr. Matsuura is hiding behind the same rhetoric as other CEOs
who think their companies are under siege.</p>
<p>If Mr. Matsuura is maximizing the value of Koito why would
he be concerned about who owns the stock? But if he is not
maximizing the value, I can understand his vigorous campaign
to paint such an inaccurate picture of Mr. Pickens as
greenmailer and corporate destroyer.</p>

<p>Arigato, Mr. Matsuura for your enlightenment on Boone-San.
Your article gave me renewed faith in the realization that it
is always wise to reserve one's judgment until you hear the
other side of the story.</p>
