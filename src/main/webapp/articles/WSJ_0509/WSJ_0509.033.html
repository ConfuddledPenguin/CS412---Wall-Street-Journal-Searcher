	<p class="article-leader">Following is a press release from the University of
Northern Colorado, announcing it was withdrawing its
invitation to Linda Chavez to speak at commencement. A
related editorial appears today {see: "REVIEW & OUTLOOK
(Editorial): The Ivory Censor" -- WSJ May 9, 1990}.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>After a day of discussion with students, faculty and
staff, University of Northern Colorado President Robert C.
Dickeson announced Thursday afternoon that the institution
will rescind its invitation to Linda Chavez to speak at its
undergraduate commencement ceremonies May 12.</p>
<p>The selection of Chavez, a former Reagan administration
official viewed by many as an official English advocate, has
drawn criticism from Hispanic groups, UNC's Faculty Senate,
and the UNC student government. All three groups have asked
Dickeson to rescind the invitation.</p>
<p>Dickeson spent more than seven hours at UNC's University
Center Thursday to discuss the matter with members of the
university community. In all, 95 people shared opinions with
Dickeson.</p>
<p>In issuing the decision to rescind the invitation,
Dickeson made five statements:</p>
<p>1) The intent of the University in inviting Linda Chavez
to be the commencement speaker was to be sensitive to
cultural diversity and the committee making the decision
intended to communicate the importance of cultural pluralism.
It is clear that the decision was both uninformed and gave
the appearance of being grossly insensitive.</p>
<p>2) The decision to invite Linda Chavez to be the
commencement speaker is rescinded.</p>
<p>3) Because the university strongly believes in free
exchange of ideas, Linda Chavez is invited to an open forum
on the UNC campus for the same fee, which can be scheduled
during the 1990-91 academic year. Such a forum will allow for
an interactive discussion of issues rather than a unilateral
presentation which a commencement speech implies.</p>
<p>4) In order for the University to make an even stronger
statement of its commitment to diversity, the vice chairman
of the UNC Board of Trustees, Edmundo Gonzalez of Denver,
will deliver a charge to the graduates at the May 12 ceremony
in place of a commencement speaker.</p>
<p>5) The university needs to improve its procedures for the
selection of commencement speakers. The commencement
committee needs to be augmented to assure student and
minority representation. The Faculty Senate and the Student
Representative Council will be asked to recommend specific
ways in which this can be accomplished for the future.</p>
