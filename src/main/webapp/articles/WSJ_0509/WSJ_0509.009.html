	<p class="article-leader">Move over, Casey Jones. Here come the truck-trains.
   The trucking industry plans to begin campaigning soon for
approval to use larger truck sizes and weights, including
100-foot triple-trailer rigs that conjure up images of small
trains rolling on the nation's highways.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"They'll have to put on a caboose and a rear brakeman,"
jokes James Bartley, executive director of the National
Industrial Transportation League, a shippers' group.</p>
<p>Truckers, promising shippers big productivity gains, say
the larger vehicles will help counter higher taxes and other
rising costs by reducing the number of cabs and drivers
needed. "You can be damn sure that the question of larger and
more efficient trucks is high on our productivity hit
parade," says Thomas J. Donohue, president of American
Trucking Associations, Alexandria, Va.</p>
<p>Truckers see an opportunity to push for super trucks when
Congress, which could prod states to ease barriers, fashions
a new highway bill in the next 18 months. Meanwhile, they
await the release in coming months of studies expected to
show that the long truck combinations can operate safely and
save shippers money.</p>
<p>But the prospect of trailers strung together in truck
trains is already generating loud complaints. The American
Automobile Association vows to fight the bigger trucks, which
"would put the average automobile driver at increased risk,"
says George Viverette, the AAA's director of highway
transportation. "I don't see why our members should have to
share the roads with these big trucks."</p>
<p>Others argue that it defies common sense to squeeze larger
trucks onto increasingly congested highways. And they
question the wisdom of making trucks so much more efficient
that they attract more freight to the highways from
railroads.</p>
<p>"The trucking strategy is 180 degrees opposite of what we
think the nation's transportation policy should be," says
Brent Blackwelder, vice president for policy of Friends of
the Earth. He argues that railroads use less energy and
create less pollution than trucks to carry comparable loads,
without adding to highway congestion and deterioration.</p>
<p>Some state highway officials aren't enthusiastic about
trucks getting bigger and heavier. "Truckers aren't paying
their full share of the damage they now do to the roads,"
says Howard Yerusalim, Pennsylvania's transportation
secretary. A spokesman for the Illinois Transportation
Department says the state "doesn't have the financial
resources to deal with the additional damage that would be
caused by heavier trucks."</p>
<p>Railroads, whose freight business already is dwarfed by
the trucking industry's, are banding together to block the
super trucks. They are striking alliances with environmental
and road-safety groups, arguing that consumers will be the
losers if the big trucks roll.</p>
<p>Railroad officials worry that the bigger trucks will
derail their recent success at winning some freight business
from the highways. By stacking two containers in special
low-slung cars, railroads have cut costs enough to capture
more than $100 million a year in freight shipments from
trucks along the nation's busiest long-distance freight
routes.</p>
<p>"The playing field has tipped substantially in favor of
the railroads in long-haul, high-density, east-west freight
lanes," says John Larkin, an analyst at Alex. Brown & Sons,
Baltimore. But longer rigs, Mr. Larkin adds, would tip the
playing field back in the other direction.</p>
<p>Not every railroad executive is worried about bigger
trucks. "I don't think that will make or break us," says Drew
Lewis, chief executive officer of Union Pacific Corp., adding
that railroad service improvements and cost-cutting measures
will mean more to rail freight levels.</p>
<p>Truckers want to operate triple 28-foot trailers and
double 48-foot trailers on interstate and other major
highways nationwide. Some Western states and Eastern
turnpikes now allow the longer rigs, but truckers generally
are limited to double 28-foot trailers and single 48-foot
trailers.</p>
<p>Truckers say the bigger rigs will reduce their costs by
one-third. The ATA says one soon-to-be-released study will
show that use of the longer trucks on major roads around the
country will cut U.S. transportation costs about $4.4 billion
a year.</p>
<p>Such savings are important to truckers, who face the
prospect of higher federal fuel taxes for road repairs when
Congress crafts highway legislation next year. In addition,
trucking companies are looking for productivity gains to
offset state tax increases and the costs of meeting new
emission standards.</p>
<p>Mr. Donohue, the ATA president, says the longer rigs also
have environmental benefits: Because they lower the number of
trucks on the roads, they reduce energy use, air pollution
and highway congestion. More axles to carry the load also
would mean less road wear, he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Donohue denies that heavy trucks aren't paying their
fair share for the damage they cause to highways, and he
bristles at railroad lobbying efforts to drive up truck taxes
and block increases in truck size. "If I find them walking on
our lawn all the time, I will turn on the sprinklers," says
Mr. Donuhue, who threatens to lobby for an end to various
federal subsidies that benefit the freight railroads.</p>
<p>The trucking industry is lining up its allies. Max Klotz,
manager of permits of the Oregon Transportation Department,
says Oregon has permitted triple 28-foot trailers on major
highways for the past 20 years. "Their safety record is very
good," he says. Gordon Kinch, team leader of legislative
affairs at James River Corp., a paper company, says he favors
allowing longer rigs to cut shipper costs and hold down
prices to consumers.</p>
<p>But not everyone is sure the economic benefits outweigh
the possible social costs. "When I put my economist hat on, I
say let's opt for larger trucks," says Bernard La Londe, a
transportation and logistics professor at Ohio State
University. But he admits having different thoughts when a
speeding 18-wheeler cut him off on the interstate. "The
trucker is often a bully," says Mr. La Londe. "I would be
hesitant to give truckers an opportunity to be twice as big a
bully."</p>
