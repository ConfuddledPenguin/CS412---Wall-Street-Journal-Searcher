	<p class="article-leader">The Machinists union at Trans World Airlines Inc. is at
work on a proposal to wrest control of the carrier from
chairman Carl C. Icahn through an employee takeover, union
officials said.
   Timothy Connolly, an international representative of the
International Association of Machinists, said the union plans
to meet this weekend with its financial adviser to discuss
how such a transaction might be structured.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Brian M. Freeman, Machinists financial adviser, confirmed
he is drafting an acquisition proposal, but wouldn't comment
on its specifics. Mr. Freeman played a major role in putting
together the proposed employee buy-out of UAL Corp., United
Airlines' parent. Four years ago, he helped engineer a 10%
ownership stake for TWA's pilots and machinists.</p>
<p>The machinists' efforts are the latest twist in the
conflict between Mr. Icahn and TWA's unions. Mr. Icahn has
been selling off aircraft and recently threatened to transfer
TWA's domestic route network to America West Airlines unless
the pilots union makes wage concessions. The unions,
meanwhile, have approached a number of outside investors
about taking over the airline.</p>
<p>Efforts toward an employee buy-out reflect the failure of
either union to interest any buyers in TWA, which had a $300
million loss in 1989 and is carrying $2.8 billion in debt.
The carrier had been profitable until Mr. Icahn took it
private in 1988, saddling TWA with debt.</p>
<p>Mr. Icahn said TWA isn't for sale, although he has been
selling assets. He added, however, that "if the Machinists
want to talk, we're willing to listen."</p>
<p>This isn't the first time TWA's unions have floated the
idea of an employee takeover. However, stepped-up threats
from Mr. Icahn to sell assets and TWA's deteriorating
finances have thrown the carrier into crisis, Mr. Connolly
said. "We're going to have to do something in the next couple
of weeks," he added.</p>
<p>Any effort at an employee acquisition would face several
obstacles. So far, no major equity investor has come forward.
It is also unlikely TWA employees would want to make the kind
of major wage concessions that United employees agreed to in
order to finance the UAL buy-out. That accord has been
approved by UAL's board and the employees now have four
months to obtain financing for the sale. TWA's mechanics
haven't had a pay increase since 1983 and the pilots are
already among the lowest paid in the industry.</p>
<p>Mr. Freeman conceded that any acquisition proposal would
have to have the support of the pilots union, if not all of
the TWA employee groups, to succeed. Pilots union leaders
said they have held preliminary discussions with the
Machinists union and plan to continue talks on employee
ownership.</p>
<p>Mr. Icahn reportedly has sought as much as $1 billion for
TWA, although pilot leaders said he offered the airline to
its former president, Joseph Coor, two years ago for $450
million. TWA's most valuable assets are its vast European
route network and Kansas City maintenance base.</p>
