	<p class="article-leader">Kremlin archives now confirmed that the NKVD, acting under
Josef Stalin's orders, executed 15,000 Polish officers in the
spring of 1940. Now, what about the rest of this story? Did
Stalin also order the death of Gen. Wladyslaw Sikorski, the
commander-in-chief and prime minister of the Polish
government in exile?
   Sikorski, who had defeated the Red Army during the
Russo-Polish war of 1920, was the only person with the
stature needed to unite the badly fragmented Poles. Churchill
and Roosevelt held him in great esteem. Even Stalin had to
treat him with respect.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>After the mass graves of Polish officers had been
discovered at Katyn, Sikorski immediately called for the Red
Cross to investigate. The Germans promised cooperation. This
was the opportunity Stalin had been waiting for. "The
Polish-German proposal," he bellowed to Churchill and
Roosevelt, proved that Sikorski was colluding in "an
anti-Soviet slander campaign launched by the German
fascists." The Soviet ruler immediately terminated
recognition of the London Poles and installed a puppet
government in Soviet-occupied Poland.</p>
<p>Only weeks later, a Royal Air Force Liberator with
Sikorski and a traveling party of 10 including his daughter,
lifted off the runway at Gibraltar. Then the plane stalled
and crashed into the Mediterranean. Sikorski's body was
eventually pulled from the black water; his daughter's
remains were never found.</p>
<p>A British Court of Inquiry dutifully concluded, "the cause
of the accident was due to the aircraft becoming
uncontrollable for reasons which cannot be established."
Since the inquiry's unofficial mandate, much like the Warren
Commission's some twenty years later, was to rule out the
possibility of conspiracy or sabotage, it left many stones
unturned.</p>
<p>For instance, Ivan Maisky, the Soviet ambassador in
London, suddenly informed the Foreign Office that he had been
urgently summoned back to Moscow. It would be necessary for
him to make a refueling stop at Gibraltar -- at exactly the
same time that Sikorski did. The NKVD could easily have
included an experienced saboteur in Maisky's travel party.</p>
<p>In its rush to judgment, the inquiry chose to ignore
evidence that, in violation of all regulations, mailbags had
been jammed into the Liberator's nosecone which housed vital
gears and cables. It wouldn't have taken more than a few
seconds to stuff the pouches into the nosecone -- or even to
cut a cable -- so that operations would have seemed normal
until the plane tried to climb.</p>
<p>Years later Maisky acknowledged that there had been many
opportunities to sabotage Sikorski's plane -- and that he was
sure that is what the Germans had done. But it was Stalin who
most feared Sikorski. When the two men had met in the Kremlin
in December 1941, Sikorski demanded to know what had become
of his missing Polish officers, many of whom he had known
personally. Stalin insisted he had released them. Sikorski
responded by practically calling him a liar. Stalin did not
want so indomitable a man leading Poland.</p>
<p>After Sikorski's plane went down, several Poles standing
on the runway began to sob "this is the end of Poland, this
is the end of Poland]" And indeed it was. No one else could
pull the various Polish factions together, command such
respect in Western capitals or go eyeball to eyeball with
Stalin.</p>
<p>President Gorbachev has promised to fill in Soviet
history's "blank spots." Owning up to the Katyn Forrest
Massacre was a good start. Now, Mr. President, please finish
the job.</p>

<p>Mr. Newton's book, "The Butcher's Embrace: The American
Side of the Philby, Burgess and Maclean Story," is scheduled
for publication in early 1991.</p>
