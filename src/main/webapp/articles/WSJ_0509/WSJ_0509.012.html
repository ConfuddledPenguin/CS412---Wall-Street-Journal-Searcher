	<p class="article-leader">Most folks who receive chain letters toss them out,
ignoring threats of bad luck for those who break the "chain."
   Not in Hollywood. In recent months, hundreds of hot-shot
executives in Los Angeles have received copies of a chain
letter, complete with stapled notes from scads of others who
have already passed it along. "Do not keep this letter," it
says, warning of bad luck for the recipient who doesn't send
the letter on to five others.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The gimmick has worked. The chain "packet" has now jumped
coasts and is making its way through media circles in New
York. It has reached such big names as film producer Steve
Tisch; Christopher Whittle, chairman of Whittle
Communications; and Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr., deputy
publisher of the New York Times.</p>
<p>"The timing was terrible," says Harris Katleman, president
and chief executive officer of Fox Inc.'s TV-production unit,
who received the letter late last year. "I would've chucked
it, but the letter came just as we were getting our pilots
ready for the fall {TV season of 1990}. Let's just say I'm
superstitious."</p>
<p>Mr. Katleman sent the packet to a few pals, including Kim
LeMasters, who shortly thereafter lost his job as
entertainment chief at CBS. Another recipient, Edward
Gradinger, who was chief of New World Entertainment, also
lost his job. "Maybe they didn't respond," muses Mr.
Katleman. (Mr. LeMasters declined to comment; Mr. Gradinger
did send the letter on.)</p>
<p>In attached notes, executives have apologized for passing
on the curse. "Sorry] But I've got my family to think of,"
wrote Eric Carlson, an agent at Creative Artists Agency in
Beverly Hills, Calif. "I'm not superstitious] (But I feel a
lot better playing it safe)," apologized Rob Kenneally,
senior vice president at Fox Broadcasting. Amy Introcaso
Davis, casting director at CBS Entertainment, wrote, "I hope
my unborn child forgives me for this]"</p>
<p>Puzzled participants say they have no idea who started the
chain. In any event, it has kept secretaries on both coasts
busy; the packet -- which now runs about 50 pages -- has to
be photocopied four times.</p>
<p>Ms. Davis, however, says she's getting a little tired of
the chain, having received the packet three different times.
"I sent the thing out twice, but I thought the third one
itself was bad luck," she says. Still, "you sort of feel like
you have to send it on."</p>
