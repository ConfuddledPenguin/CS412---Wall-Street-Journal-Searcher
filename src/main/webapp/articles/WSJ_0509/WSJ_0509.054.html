	<p class="article-leader">Bond traders, please stop hyperventilating over additional
economic growth and prosperity. Try to get a grip on
yourselves. Take long deep breathes through the nose,
exhaling slowly. Then you'll realize that you should be
buying bonds, not selling them.
   Yes, the economy has avoided recession, for the eighth
straight year. And we know you don't like jobs, except
presumably your own. But the rest of the nation fervently
believes that employment is better than unemployment. And the
rest of the nation understands that when human resources are
productively employed, the increase in output, investment and
productivity does not cause inflation.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Inflation is caused by bad money, not growth. When the Fed
creates too many dollars, or when the Treasury deliberately
devalues the dollar on foreign-exchange markets, inflation
results. But Alan Greenspan and Co. are protecting the value
of our money. Mr. Greenspan has made it clear to Nicholas
Brady and the Treasury that the Fed will not endorse or
accommodate any more Keynesian easy money dollar-bashing
schemes. They realize that the dollar depreciation and bank
reserve stimulus policy in last year's fourth-quarter went
too far. And you bond traders were entirely justified then in
temporarily raising long-term yields from 7.8% to 8.5%, and
investing in gold, which jumped to $425 from $360.</p>
<p>But fellas, 9% is going too far. You are flagellating the
Fed -- and the rest of the economy -- much too much for a
minor policy error. The Fed has, after all, publicly
delivered its mea culpa. We know this from the widely
reported Greenspan-Brady conversation on the plane to last
month's G-7 meeting in Paris. It may be the most important
plane ride of the year.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenspan insisted on defending the dollar. He
explained to Mr. Brady the concept of purchasing power
parity, which means that if U.S. inflation is to converge
with Japan and Germany's lower rate, the dollar cannot be
depreciated and probably must strengthen, especially against
the mark.</p>
<p>We also know from commodity price rulers Wayne Angell and
Manley Johnson that the Fed has shed its bad fourth-quarter
ways. Mr. Angell actually dissented from the December Fed
easing move. Vice chairman Johnson was not so courageous in
December, but he has since recanted in important speeches
delivered in London and Washington.</p>
<p>This is one key reason why gold prices have nose-dived
from $425 back to under $370. The gold market has
historically been a very good indicator of monetary value,
future inflation and interest rates. Remember last year in
the winter of 1989, when all you bond traders were moaning
about the Consumer Price Index and capacity utilization? If
you had paid more careful attention to the steadily dropping
gold price and the improving dollar, you would have made even
more money by buying bonds at 9.5%, instead of waiting until
8.5%, when the consensus finally turned bullish. The gold
signal would have permitted you to accumulate even greater
wealth, to buy more Park Avenue co-ops, summer houses and
British shirts and ties. Heaven knows the real estate markets
and the Brits could use a shot in the arm.</p>
<p>$370 gold at the present time is a vote in favor of bonds,
not only because of what the Fed is publicly saying, but it
also confirms what the Fed is actually doing. Since January
the Fed has created dollars at a much slower pace. We know
this by watching the U.S. monetary base, which is the best
proxy for the amount of dollars created by the Fed.</p>
<p>The base measures the entire balance sheet of the Federal
Reserve, which of course by U.S. law is our monopolistic
creator of dollars. All the assets of the Fed are included in
the base: Treasury securities, loans to member banks, float
and foreign currency purchases. Any high-powered dollar
reserve expansion will be reflected in an expansion of the
Fed's balance sheet, and duly noted in the accounting of the
monetary base.</p>
<p>After the Fed's fourth-quarter excesses, the three-month
growth of the base jumped up to nearly 12% in January. But
since then base growth has been damped to 6%. Actually, over
the past two years the Fed has limited base growth to only
5%. Now, while there's no magical precise growth rate for the
base -- price stability depends in large part on money demand
-- 5% is surely a moderate noninflationary pace. Back in
1986, when James Baker's Treasury was intent on devaluing the
dollar, Paul Volcker at the Fed cooperated by letting the
monetary base grow at a 10% rate. This of course led directly
to the collapse of the stock and bonds markets in 1987, and a
gold price of more than $450.</p>
<p>But today gold is nearly $100 lower and the base is
growing only half as fast. These are very positive signs that
the value of our money is improving and inflation is
declining. Not just the price of gold, but the prices of oil,
copper, silver and platinum also suggest that global
investment portfolios would rather own money than
commodities. Indeed, since gold and commodity prices are
declining when measured not just in dollars but in all the
major currencies, this suggests that international inflation
fears are exaggerated and all G-7 long-term interest rates
are too high.</p>
<p>Overseas, it may well turn out that freedom and democracy
and currency union in Central Europe are not inflationary.
Nor are declining tax rates and the 1992 deregulation in
Western Europe. Nor is the resilience of the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>Indeed, once again in the new decade we may relearn the
lesson of the '80s: that economic growth never creates
inflation so long as monetary value and purchasing power are
defended. Governments everywhere are pursuing growth on the
supply side, while central banks are relinking money to gold.
It's exactly the right combination. So, come on bond traders,
get with the drill.</p>
