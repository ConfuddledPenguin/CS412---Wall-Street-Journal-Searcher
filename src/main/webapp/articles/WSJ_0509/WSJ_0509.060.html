	<p class="article-leader">MONTREAL -- Power Corp. of Canada is poised for a major
push into Europe through its new alliance with Belgian
financier Albert Frere, according to Power Corp. officials.
   With slightly more than one billion Canadian dollars
(US$859.8 million) in ready cash and the ability to borrow
much more, Power Corp.'s investment plans have been a
favorite topic of discussion in Canadian business circles for
more than a year. While Power Corp. doesn't plan to go on an
immediate spending spree, company officials said they are
ready to forge ahead in Europe.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In February, Paul Desmarais, chairman and controlling
shareholder of Power Corp., and Mr. Frere, chairman of Frere
Bourgeois S.A. of Brussels, took control of Pargesa Holding
S.A., a Geneva holding company. Pargesa in turn holds big
stakes in Groupe Bruxelles Lambert S.A., Belgium's
second-largest holding company, and Petrofina S.A., the big
Belgian oil company. Mr. Frere was named chairman of
Petrofina last week.</p>
<p>Late last month, Pargesa and Cie. Financiere de Paribas, a
French banking concern, announced a complex transaction that
bolstered Pargesa'a control of Groupe Bruxelles. At the same
time, Mr. Frere and Mr. Desmarais announced they control
nearly 10% of Paribas.</p>
<p>In their first public comments on Power Corp.'s recent
moves in Europe, company officials stressed the importance of
the new alliance with Mr. Frere.</p>
<p>Control with Mr. Frere "gives us now a vehicle in Europe"
for Power Corp.'s investments there, said Paul Desmarais Jr.,
son of Mr. Desmarais and chairman of a Power Corp. unit.
Aside from a 50.1% stake in a British investment-management
firm, in Europe "everything {Power Corp. does} will be
through Pargesa," the younger Mr. Desmarais said.</p>
<p>But he wouldn't signal where Power Corp.'s European
investments will flow. He did say Pargesa won't increase
three major holdings for the time being.</p>
<p>Because the Frere-Desmarais tandem "for all intents holds
control" of Groupe Bruxelles, the partners don't have
immediate plans to raise their stake, he said. The same goes
for Petrofina, where Pargesa holds about 20% and a Frere
family company has 5%.</p>
<p>The younger Mr. Desmarais said the partners don't intend
to buy more Paribas shares. "We consider ourselves a friendly
and stable" shareholder in Paribas, he said. But he said the
Frere-Desmarais team's 9% to 10% stake in Paribas "puts us in
a position of pre-eminance" among the bank's shareholders,
and Mr. Frere and the elder Mr. Desmarais are being treated
accordingly. He didn't elaborate.</p>
