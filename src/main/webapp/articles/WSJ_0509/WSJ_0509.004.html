	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Financier Charles W. Knapp, who was ousted
five years ago as head of the nation's largest thrift, is
under federal investigation for his activities in trying to
build his Trafalgar Holdings Ltd. into a personal financial
empire, several people with knowledge of the investigation
said.
   In addition, insurance regulators in several jurisdictions
have been looking into Mr. Knapp's recent activities in
setting up or purportedly funding insurance companies, a
person familiar with those actions said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles has been looking
into Mr. Knapp's financial affairs for several months, and
the Federal Bureau of Investigation conducted surprise raids
on Mr. Knapp's home and at least one of his offices earlier
this year, people familiar with the investigations said.</p>
<p>While the warrants and federal affidavit that were issued
to support the raids are still sealed, a clerk at the U.S.
District Court office here indirectly confirmed that warrants
had been issued to seize documents at Mr. Knapp's condominium
home in the Century City section of Los Angeles and at an
office he leases in Beverly Hills, Calif.</p>
<p>Mr. Knapp didn't respond directly to a request for
comment. But Donald Reynolds, a longtime friend and former
business associate who shares an office suite with Mr. Knapp,
said that when asked about the investigation, Mr. Knapp had
said, "I have no comment."</p>
<p>An FBI spokesman said he couldn't respond to any inquiries
regarding a possible investigation of Mr. Knapp.</p>
<p>But it was learned that FBI agents already have
interviewed a number of former Trafalgar employees and
executives, questioning them about the activities of the
closely held company, which was formed in late 1984.</p>
<p>While the full scope of the investigation couldn't
immediately be determined and it isn't clear whether a
federal grand jury has yet heard any evidence in the case,
people with knowledge of the situation said a major part of
the investigation involves an unsecured $15 million loan made
to Mr. Knapp's mortgage-brokerage concern, Trafalgar Capital
Corp., by Western Savings & Loan Association of Phoenix. The
thrift later became insolvent and was taken over by federal
regulators.</p>
<p>That loan, and Trafalgar Capital's failure to repay it
when it came due March 31, 1989, was part of a front-page
story in The Wall Street Journal last year that detailed Mr.
Knapp's attempt to build Trafalgar Holdings into a major
financial-services company. A lengthy investigation by this
newspaper concluded that of the billions of dollars of deals
that Mr. Knapp claimed to have done, practically none of
substance were actually carried out.</p>
<p>There were several indications in 1988 that Mr. Knapp was
having financial troubles when he persuaded Western Savings
to lend $15 million to Trafalgar Capital. The loan apparently
was based on a balance sheet that indicated Trafalgar Capital
had assets of $100 million. But nearly all of that was built
up out of swaps of Trafalgar Capital securities for
securities in other hard-to-value, closely held entities.</p>
<p>The largest single value was the $71.6 million assigned to
a half-interest in the Circle C Ranch, a residential
development near Austin, Texas. But the purported Circle C
stake has been the subject of litigation in federal court in
Austin over who controls the asset.</p>
<p>Mr. Knapp lately has been trying his hand at insurance,
with a number of subsidiaries including one called Trafalgar
Insurance. But last fall, Insurance Commissioner David N.
Levinson of Delaware, where the unit was incorporated, issued
an order that the company cease and desist from the deceptive
use of the word insurance in its name since the company
hadn't been licensed in Delaware or elsewhere to act as an
insurance company.</p>
<p>It was also learned that the Ministry of Finance of the
Bahamas has been looking into the activities of an offshore
insurance company purportedly funded largely by entities
controlled by Mr. Knapp.</p>
<p>Mr. Knapp has other problems. He faces a state court
hearing in Los Angeles on a contempt-of-court charge for
failing to make payments of more than $415,000 under a
divorce settlement with his second wife, N. Brooke Knapp. Mr.
Knapp has sought to stay any final action by seeking to have
the judge in the case ousted because of alleged prejudice
against him and by filing a civil suit in state court in Los
Angeles seeking to overturn the settlement agreement.</p>
<p>In his civil suit, Mr. Knapp claimed that when he signed
the settlement agreement in August 1986, he was "suffering
from a severe personality disorder and depression which
caused him to be exceedingly self-destructive and which
rendered him unable to understand and comprehend the nature
of the agreement and its consequences."</p>
<p>That suit was thrown out a few months ago, with the court
calling it "a transparently obvious attempt" to delay
prosecution on the contempt charges. The court also dismissed
the motion to disqualify the judge.</p>
<p>The contempt hearing was scheduled for April 19, but court
records show it was postponed for four months. Mrs. Knapp's
lawyer declined to comment, saying that the reason for the
delay was discussed in the judge's chambers. A lawyer for Mr.
Knapp said that the two sides were trying to work out a
mutually agreeable financial settlement. But two other people
with knowledge of the proceeding said that another reason for
the delay was the FBI's seizure of Mr. Knapp's personal
financial records.</p>
<p>Mr. Knapp formed Trafalgar several months after regulators
forced out the maverick executive as chairman of Financial
Corp. of America, the parent of American Savings & Loan
Association, then the nation's largest thrift. Mr. Knapp set
up a brokerage firm that later failed, but his main business
was purportedly lining up several billion dollars in
financing to help corporate raiders make unfriendly
takeovers. But The Wall Street Journal found that while
Trafalgar collected millions of dollars in up-front fees, it
backed away nearly every time it actually was called upon to
turn over promised funds. Mr. Knapp in the past has denied
any improprieties.</p>
