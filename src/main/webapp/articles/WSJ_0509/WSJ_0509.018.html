	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- Comerica Inc. said it will build a $200 million
headquarters office in downtown Detroit on a site now
occupied by a concert hall named for Henry and Edsel Ford.
   The banking company said it is still working out financing
for the project, but expects to receive about $18 million in
loans for the project from the City of Detroit Downtown
Development Authority.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Comerica will maintain an equity interest in the completed
development. The agreement also contains provisions that will
allow the development authority to receive a portion of the
building's cash-flow and sales proceeds revenue.</p>
