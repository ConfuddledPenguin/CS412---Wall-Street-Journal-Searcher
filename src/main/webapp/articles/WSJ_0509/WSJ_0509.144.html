	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Federal regulators took over Mississippi
Savings Bank, Batesville, Miss., and chartered a federal
mutual institution to take its place.
   The new institution, which has the same name, will assume
certain assets and liabilities of the former thrift and will
operate under conservatorship under oversight of the
Resolution Trust Corp. It remains open for business as usual.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Office of Thrift Supervision said it took over the
thrift, which had assets of $173.4 million, because it was
operating in an unsafe and unsound manner and had liquidity
problems. The OTS also said the institution wasn't complying
with federal capital requirements.</p>
