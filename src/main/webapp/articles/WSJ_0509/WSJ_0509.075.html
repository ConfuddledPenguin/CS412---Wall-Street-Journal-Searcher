	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Unicorp American Corp., a unit of Unicorp
Canada Corp., said it entered a preliminary agreement with
Coscan Development Corp. regarding the sale of Unicorp
American's real-estate assets.
   Under the agreement, certain Unicorp American real-estate
assets would be transferred to a partnership of Unicorp
American and affiliates of Coscan. Other assets would be
financed with participating mortgages. Net proceeds to
Unicorp American from the transactions, which are expected to
close June 15, would total about $41.6 million and would be
used to repay senior secured debt.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Payment of $32.2 million to Unicorp American, including
the assumption of $8 million of mortgages, would be made in
the form of a secured-loan facility to the partnership, and
$17.4 million of participating mortgage would be provided for
other real-estate assets. A Coscan affiliate would be the
managing partner, while Unicorp American would be a limited
partner.</p>
<p>The agreement requires, among other things, consent of
Unicorp American's lenders. Unicorp Canada plans to
distribute in the third quarter all its common shares of
Unicorp American to holders of Unicorp Canada Class A and B
common.</p>
<p>Coscan is indirectly controlled by Hees International
Bancorp, a merchant bank controlled by Toronto financiers
Peter and Edward Bronfman. Unicorp Canada is a Toronto
holding company with interest in energy and
financial-services concerns. Hees has a 24.6% non-voting
equity interest in Unicorp Canada.</p>
