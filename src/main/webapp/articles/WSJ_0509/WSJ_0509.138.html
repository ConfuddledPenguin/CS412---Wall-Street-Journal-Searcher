	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- It isn't easy being bullish on developer
Donald Trump these days. It's especially tough for holders of
various Trump casino bonds -- which have been hammered as
much as 30% this year because of weakness in the Atlantic
City, N.J., gambling market.
   But at cheap-enough prices, according to Wall Street
wisdom, even the most hated securities can be a buy.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Has that moment arrived for bonds of Trump Plaza, which
now trade at about 82 cents on the dollar and yield 17% to
maturity? Or for bonds in Trump's Castle, which trade at 65
cents on the dollar and yield a whopping 24% to maturity? Or
for bonds in the giant new Trump Taj Mahal casino, which
trade at about 70 cents on the dollar and yield 21% to
maturity?</p>
<p>Gingerly, some bargain-hunting has begun. "People are
adding Trump bonds selectively," says Ron Goldstein, a bond
trader at Kidder, Peabody & Co. "Particularly with the Trump
Plaza, people see value."</p>
<p>To venture into the Trump casino bonds, the bulls must
make three assumptions. First, they must believe that
Atlantic City's gambling slump and overcapacity problems
won't get much worse. Second, they must assume that the
recent erosion in Mr. Trump's fortune -- magazines are saying
it has fallen to $400 million or $500 million from previous
estimates of more than $1 billion -- will be contained. And
finally, they must anticipate how Mr. Trump is likely to play
his hand in Atlantic City if he isn't able to run all three
of his casinos profitably.</p>
<p>Although the bonds are closely associated with Mr. Trump's
name, they don't have any claim on his personal wealth.
Instead, they are first mortgage bonds secured by the casinos
themselves.</p>
<p>In many investors' view, the Trump Plaza bonds will fare
best. The casino has a prime location on Atlantic City's
Boardwalk and was solidly profitable last year, reporting net
income of $24.6 million and $76 million of cash flow (net
income plus interest expense, depreciation and amortization).
Cash flow was more than double its $34 million interest
expense.</p>
<p>"It almost doesn't matter if the Plaza loses market share"
in Atlantic City's current climate, says Kaye Handley, an
analyst with M.D. Sass & Co. "That property could lose half
its cash flow and still eke out its interest payment {for
1990}. There aren't a lot of properties that could say that."</p>
<p>Next year, things get a bit tougher for Trump Plaza. It
must raise cash to retire $28 million of long-term debt. It
also must defend its market share against the new Trump Taj
Mahal -- the biggest casino in Atlantic City, with a 15.6%
market share.</p>
<p>And necessary capital spending will make Trump Plaza's
interest-coverage ratios a little snugger than analysts'
presentations suggest. The Trump Plaza had $34 million of
capital spending last year; most analysts think it can trim
that amount this year and next to a maintenance level of $5
million to $10 million. (Trump officials weren't available
all day yesterday for comment.)</p>
<p>In April, the first month the Taj Mahal was open, Trump
Plaza stumbled, as its revenue dropped 24%. But early May
statistics show the Trump Plaza rebounding. Analysts are
loath to make much of short-term trends, saying it will take
until the summer before they can tell clearly how much the
Taj Mahal is affecting the business of other casinos.</p>
<p>Analysts and money managers say Trump Plaza seems able to
live with its $273 million of long-term debt outstanding. Mr.
Trump recently asserted that the casino has a value of $636
million. Even cautious analysts, who would value it at five
times cash flow, or $350 million to $400 million, see plenty
of value in the casino. "Bondholders are protected," says
Mark Brostowski, a Salomon Brothers analyst.</p>
<p>The picture isn't nearly so reassuring for holders of
Trump's Castle bonds. The casino is in Atlantic City's less
popular Marina district, and last year it had a $6.7 million
loss. The casino's cash flow of $51.1 million barely covered
interest expense of $43.3 million, even before $42.3 million
of capital spending.</p>
<p>"It's been frustrating," says a mutual-fund holder who
bought Castle bonds at 90 cents on the dollar and has ridden
them down.</p>
<p>Trump's Castle bondholders hope the company will show $45
million to $55 million of cash flow this year. That won't
stretch far enough; the company faces a $43 million interest
bill this year, some maintenance capital spending and a
sinking-fund payment June 15 to retire $22.8 million face
value of bonds.</p>
<p>"Such requirements . . . create cash needs that exceed
anticipated annual cash flows from operations for 1990 and
beyond," Trump's Castle warns in its latest 10-K filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>Trump's Castle's lack of cash almost certainly must be
made up either by Mr. Trump or by more bank loans. At one
time, analysts such as Ray Neidl of Dillon Read had thought
that Mr. Trump might be able to raise money by selling stock
in Trump's Castle. But the downturn in both the casino's and
Mr. Trump's fortunes make that less likely, Mr. Neidl says.
Although there's still talk in Atlantic City that Mr. Trump
might attempt some sort of public offering of stock in his
casinos, the Trump Plaza would seem to be a more likely
vehicle for an offering.</p>
<p>As much as bondholders hope Trump's Castle will pay all
its interest and principal in a timely fashion, some of them
are looking at less-cheery cases. One bondholder says he
would be content if the company refinances its debt at 85
cents on the dollar.</p>
<p>Another holder observes that under terms of the original
bond financing, if the casino misses interest payments,
bondholders are entitled to take control of the property.
"I'm not a subordinated, junior lender," one bondholder says.
"I don't have a lot of creditors ahead of me. If these things
go down, I will win."</p>
<p>Trump's Castle officials declined to comment on the
company, referring all questions to Mr. Trump, who was out of
town and didn't return phone calls.</p>
<p>The biggest gamble of all -- for both Mr. Trump and
bondholders -- is the new Trump Taj Mahal casino, which
opened last month. The casino is Atlantic City's largest,
with 120,000 square feet of floor space, double the size of
its nearest competitor. Mr. Trump has invested $75 million of
his own money alongside $50 million of bank loans and $675
million of high-yield junk bonds raised through Merrill Lynch
& Co.</p>
<p>"We still don't know what the property is going to do on
any sustained basis," says Anne Lorsung, an analyst at
McCarthy, Crisanti & Maffei. Her forecasts, however, suggest
that buyers of the bonds had better hope Mr. Trump's business
savvy hasn't dulled.</p>
<p>Trump Taj Mahal carries an annual interest bill of about
$100 million, or $75 million for the nine months of 1990 in
which it is operating. Ms. Lorsung says she estimated in
March that the casino would produce $81 million of cash flow.
Despite a robust April for the casino, though, she now
worries that her original estimate may have been "a little
optimistic."</p>
<p>Even if Trump Taj Mahal hits Ms. Lorsung's target, it will
need extra cash to cover repayment of $10 million in bank
debt this year and maintenance capital spending of at least
$10 million. "I look for a shortfall of $15 million," she
says. The likely sources? Mr. Trump or the banks.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, investors could follow Mr. Trump's progress at
Trump Taj Mahal by looking at the company's quarterly 10-Q
financial filings with the SEC. But in late March, Trump Taj
Mahal asked the SEC for permission to stop making such
disclosures. That's allowable if a company has less than 300
bondholders. Trump Taj Mahal said it had 251 holders.</p>
<p>Some information on Trump Taj Mahal's finances will still
emerge from the New Jersey Casino Control Commission. But the
request to stop SEC filings "won't be viewed positively by
the market," Ms. Lorsung says.</p>
