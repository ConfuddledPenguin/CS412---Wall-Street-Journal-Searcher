	<p class="article-leader">FRANKFURT, West Germany -- A West German stock-exchange
official said the nation is considering marketing its Ibis
price-information system in Britain if the London Stock
Exchange follows through with plans to install its Seaq
International system in German trading rooms.
   But Ruediger von Rosen, executive vice chairman of the
Federation of German Stock Exchanges, said he would prefer if
the major European stock markets would cooperate in the Price
Information Project Europe, a pan-European screen-based
securities-trading system.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Such a cooperation would cut the cost of information and
facilitate the creation of a unified European market place
for the trading of blue-chip shares, the official said in
remarks prepared for the Financial Markets Group Conference
at the London School of Economics. A text of the speech was
made available in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>Seaq, which handles around 12% of the trading volume in
the key German blue-chip stocks, launched a marketing
campaign to install its monitors in Frankfurt bank offices,
which would permit traders to conduct their business directly
on the London exchange.</p>
<p>In return, the German exchanges could offer their new Ibis
system to traders outside West Germany once it has been
expanded into a full-fledged trading system able to handle
stocks and bonds from all major European markets, Mr. von
Rosen said. Ibis's main advantage over Seaq and other systems
is its direct line to the German Central Securities
Depository, which permits automatic clearing and settlement
within a two-day period, he said.</p>
<p>But such a strategy would result in a situation where
traders are surrounded by monitors from Ibis, Seaq, the
French CAC system, and even the U.S. Nasdaq network, Mr. von
Rosen said.</p>
