	<p class="article-leader">T. Boone Pickens faces real difficulties in attempting to
deal with the Japanese, but his comments on the "keiretsu"
system ("Secrets Koito Hoped to Hide by Keeping Me Off Its
Board," editorial page, March 28) are off the mark.
   Doing business in Japan is no piece of cake. Embedded in
the intricacies of Japanese culture, keiretsu present
formidable hurdles. The links among distributors, in
particular, are so involved and inefficient as to defy
ordinary logic. But keiretsu are not, as Mr. Pickens
grandiosely asserts, "the root of the world's trade problems
with Japan," including his own snafu with Koito Manufacturing
Co.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The keiretsu is a system of lifetime business
relationships built more on trust than on signed contracts.
To break such a relationship just because someone else --
Japanese or foreign -- offers a cheaper product or service is
for the Japanese a violation of trust and the worst kind of
dirty dealing.</p>
<p>Keeping Mr. Pickens off the Koito board therefore is not,
as he claims, a question of Koito hiding "secrets." Those are
all public knowledge anyway. What Mr. Pickens fails to grasp
is that his approach -- assault by press release and lawsuit
-- has fulfilled every Japanese stereotype of the gun-toting
Westerner and made him an outsider to the friendship and
trust that run through business relationships in Japan. He
has made no effort to develop a proper relationship with
Koito. So it can't trust him.</p>
<p>Even Americans find it difficult to trust Mr. Pickens. Can
the Japanese be blamed for keeping him at arm's length?</p>
<p>Mr. Pickens's recent actions have only fanned Koito's
mistrust. He gave the company five business days to produce
10 years of financial records, then filed a lawsuit when
Koito asked for more time. His financial relationship with a
Japanese greenmailer, Kitaro Watanabe, makes his denials of
greenmail intentions unconvincing. He blithely suggested that
Koito adopt a binding resolution banning the special
repurchase of stock, ignoring the deep-seated Japanese
suspicion of anything that smacks of legal action.</p>
<p>Mr. Pickens will succeed in Japan -- as the Japanese have
succeeded here -- only to the extent that he adjusts to a
strange language, culture, and economic and legal systems.
The key issue is not the keiretsu but Mr. Pickens's refusal
even to consider modifying his approach to fit Japanese
business practices.</p>
<p>Instead, Mr. Pickens, in a display of cultural arrogance,
demands that Japan abandon keiretsu. So fundamental are
keiretsu to Japan that to abandon them would be to rip up
Japanese culture and identity. Who is Mr. Pickens, or anybody
else for that matter, to exact such an outrageous demand?</p>
<p>It is also hypocritical, because Mr. Pickens could be
charged with attempting to form his own keiretsu. In 1988 he
locked horns with KNEnergy, seeking election to the board and
control of KN's pipeline system to secure higher prices for
his own Mesa Co.'s gas. KN CEO J. Robert Wilson unmasked Mr.
Pickens's intentions in a March 4, 1988, letter to
shareholders, accusing him of "continuing efforts to obtain
control of KN for the benefit of Mesa." That sounds
astonishingly like Mr. Pickens's unsubstantiated charges
today that Toyota, as part of the keiretsu, pressures Koito
for favorable pricing of auto parts.</p>
<p>Perhaps Mr. Pickens knows even more about cartels than the
Japanese do.</p>

<p>Mr. Pickens mistakenly identifies Japanese corporate
cross-holdings with "old-fashioned cartels." While the
tuition at leading business schools is high, it is a bargain
compared with the "tuition" Mr. Pickens and his associates
are paying in connection with their large shareholding in
Koito. Any investor would be well-advised to learn about a
foreign culture and system of corporate governance before
investing a billion dollars in that country. It appears that
Mr. Pickens invested first, and now complains as he finally
comes to understand what he owns. Perhaps he should reread
Ben Graham.</p>
