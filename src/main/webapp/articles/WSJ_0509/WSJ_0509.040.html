	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- A federal court judge here sentenced Robert
Fine Jr. to four years and two months in prison for a loan
scheme in which he fraudulently assumed property owners'
identities and used their property as loan collateral.
   Mr. Fine, a 33-year-old Los Angeles resident, pleaded
guilty in February on one count of mail fraud and one count
of using a fictitious name. Mr. Fine served time in prison
after his conviction in November 1987 on similar loan-fraud
charges.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>His latest conviction was for bilking two home-loan
companies out of $613,000. Mr. Fine scouted for vacant,
unencumbered properties in real-estate records and used the
data to obtain credit reports on the owners. With the credit
reports, he applied for loans using the owners' identities.</p>
<p>Mr. Fine was also sentenced to three years of probation,
fined $6,820 and ordered to pay $57,173 in restitution to one
of the defrauded lenders.</p>
