	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- A federal jury ordered Frito-Lay Inc. and
ad agency Tracy-Locke Inc. to pay singer Tom Waits nearly
$2.5 million for imitating his gravelly voice in a radio ad
for Doritos' Salsa Rio tortilla chips.
   The jury's award includes punitive damages of $2 million,
of which $1.5 million are against Tracy-Locke, a unit of
Omnicom Group Inc., New York.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The singer contended that Frito-Lay, a PepsiCo Inc. unit,
purposely imitated his "deep and growly" voice and "bluesy"
style for the 1988 spot. Frito-Lay countered that the ad "was
just a singer doing a jingle."</p>
<p>Mr. Waits is one of several celebrities recently to be
embroiled in litigation with ad agencies over the
misappropriation of their image or voice. Last year, a
federal jury in Los Angeles issued a $400,000 judgment
against Young & Rubicam for creating an automobile ad using a
Bette Midler sound-alike.</p>
