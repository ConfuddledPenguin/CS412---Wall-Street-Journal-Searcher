	<p class="article-leader">Shareholders of Fibreboard Corp. narrowly passed a measure
doubling the shares authorized for the company's employee
stock option plan.
   After what was decribed as acrimonious debate at the
company's annual meeting in Roxboro, N.C., shareholders voted
1,080,791 to 1,035,540 to approve a plan doubling the number
of shares in the option plan to 700,000 from 350,000.
Fibreboard is a Concord, Calif., lumber and construction
products company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Donald Miller, a shareholder from New York City who holds
about 52,000 shares of Fibreboard, said he voted against the
plan because it was proposed by the board "without the
benefit of an independent study of the plan's dilutive
effect."</p>
<p>In a related measure, shareholders voted to make options
available to non-executive managers of the company at 85% of
fair market value. Options for directors and executive
managers are granted only at fair market value, the company
said.</p>
