	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- LIN Broadcasting Inc. reported a $180.8
million first-quarter loss after taking a charge of nearly
$300 million for executive severance payments and other
costs.
   Separately, LIN, which until January had little debt,
definitively agreed to acquire Metromedia Inc.'s cellular
operations in New York for $1.9 billion in cash and preferred
stock. The deal will add more than $1 billion in debt to
LIN's balance sheet.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The severance payments, which, as expected, include more
than $200 million to Donald Pels, LIN's former chairman, stem
from BF McCaw Cellular Communications Inc.'s acquisition of
52% of LIN.</p>
<p>To cover the costs, LIN took a $292.9 million charge,
which also included payments to other executives and
undisclosed fees to its banking and legal advisers on the
McCaw transaction. LIN declined to disclose the exact amount
it paid to Mr. Pels, but it covered a pre-negotiated
severance package that he had with LIN. It also covered the
buy-out of 1.3 million stock options he held in the company
as part of the agreement with McCaw.</p>
<p>Donald Guthrie, a vice president at LIN and a senior vice
president at McCaw, declined to disclose the amount of the
severance payments to the LIN executives, who included Arnold
Blauweis, former vice president, finance; Michael Plouf,
former treasurer and vice president, corporate development;
and Ronald Graiff, former vice president, engineering.</p>
<p>Mr. Guthrie also declined to specify the amount paid to
LIN's banking advisers, Wasserstein, Perella & Co., and its
legal counsel, Cravath, Swaine & Moore.</p>
<p>In the quarter, LIN's loss equaled $3.50 a share, vs. net
income of $20.2 million, or 38 cents a share, in the
year-earlier period. Without the charge, LIN would have
earned $22.8 million, or 44 cents a share. Revenue grew 17%
to $61.7 million from $52.9 million.</p>
<p>In national over-the-counter trading, LIN shares closed at
$64.50, unchanged.</p>
<p>LIN's first-quarter loss follows a $15 million
fourth-quarter loss, after LIN paid BellSouth Corp. $66.5
million for terminating an agreement to be acquired by the
Atlanta-based regional Bell phone company.</p>
<p>The Metromedia deal was proposed as all-cash. But
yesterday, LIN said it will pay Metromedia $1.05 billion in
cash for its New York cellular properties, to be funded by
additional debt. Metromedia will also get $850 million in new
redeemable preferred stock in a LIN subsidiary, LCH Cellular
Inc. LCH now holds all the LIN cellular subsidiaries and its
WOTV television station in Michigan as well as publishing
properties. In addition, LIN will pay $60 million to minority
holders of 1.7% of the New York license.</p>
<p>LIN also agreed to transfer 1.01% of its controlling
interest in a Philadelphia cellular franchise to Metromedia
for $15.5 million. This will give Metromedia 51% control of
the franchise and leave LIN as the minority owner at 49%.</p>
<p>LIN said its base of cellular phone subscribers grew 59%
in the quarter to 413,000 from 260,000 a year earlier. Ken
Leon, an analyst at Bear, Stearns & Co., noted that LIN's
subscriber growth between the fourth quarter of 1989 and the
first quarter of 1990 was 12% vs. the industry average of
15%.</p>
<p>"It's a quality company on an operating basis," said Mr.
Leon. But given its subscriber growth and debt load, "I think
LIN is a real crapshoot."</p>
