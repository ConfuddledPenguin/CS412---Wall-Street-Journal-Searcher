	<p class="article-leader">VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Southam Inc. said it
swapped its 49% stake in North Shore Free Press Ltd., and
unspecified cash, for 63% of Lower Mainland Publishing Ltd.,
whose Vancouver-area papers had gross revenue last year of
about 50 million Canadian dollars (US$43 million).
   Specific terms weren't disclosed, and officials with
Toronto-based Southam, Canada's largest-circulation publisher
of daily newspapers, weren't immediately available.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>North Shore Free Press published the North Shore News, one
of 14 community papers that will now be operated by newly
formed Lower Mainland Publishing; Madison Venture Corp. owns
the remaining 37% of Lower Mainland Publishing. All but
