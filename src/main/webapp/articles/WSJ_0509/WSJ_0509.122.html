	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Insiders in the apparel business are busy
selling blocks of their companies' stocks.
   In the first quarter, stocks of clothing retailers were
among the most heavily sold by insiders -- corporate
executives, directors and major shareholders, according to
Invest/Net, a North Miami, Fla., concern that tracks
Securities and Exchange Commission filings by insiders.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>SEC filings show that specialty retailers Gap Inc.,
Limited Inc. and Quiksilver Inc. each have clusters of
insider selling totaling more than 100,000 shares this year.</p>
<p>These stocks are all Wall Street favorites, and they've
risen since the insider sales. Nonetheless, selling by
corporate insiders can be the first sign of problems at a
company that is seemingly roaring along. Things to watch are
the number of insiders selling, the percentage of their
holdings being sold, and the total number of shares involved.</p>
<p>While "apparel retailing has been in the tank since 1987,"
Limited and Gap have both prospered despite the industry
trend by "outmerchandising the competition," said Robert F.
Buchanan, retail analyst at Baltimore-based Alex. Brown &
Sons Inc. "The real question in my mind is how long these
`good' retailers can buck the trend," he said. "I'm sure that
question is being asked by some of these retail executives:
when does my stock stop outperforming?"</p>
<p>Insider selling has been strong at Gap, a San
Francisco-based casual-wear chain. Thirteen insiders sold its
shares in January through March, SEC filings show. In fact,
according to Invest/Net, the selling at Gap in March was at
the heaviest level for the company since Invest/Net began
tracking insider filings in 1983. Still, in early April Gap
stock hit a 52-week high of $70 a share.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
the stock closed at $63.50, down $1.25.</p>
<p>Millard Drexler, president of Gap, sold a total of 368,000
shares in January and March for $20.3 million. As most of the
shares were granted him under his compensation agreement,
most of the $20.3 million is a profit for Mr. Drexler, the
company said. However, he retains almost 1.2 million shares,
SEC filings show. Mr. Drexler was out of the country and
couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>The other 12 insiders, SEC filings show, sold between
1,000 and 60,000 shares each. They sold over the three-month
period at prices of $48.88 to $66.</p>
<p>Warren Hashagen, Gap's treasurer and a seller of 5,000
shares, said the insiders all sold within "the window"
allowed by the company. That period began shortly after
fourth-quarter earnings were announced. He said that "the
stock price is at a very high level."</p>
<p>In the first quarter, seven insiders at Columbus,
Ohio-based specialty retailer Limited sold the company's
stock for $35 to $41.30 a share, SEC filings show. The
largest sale was by director Martin A. Trust, who sold
110,000 shares Feb. 28 and March 9. He retains 4.2 million
shares.</p>
<p>The most recent sale was by Howard Gross, president and
chief executive officer of the firm's Victoria's Secret
lingerie stores. As shown in the accompanying Insider Trading
Spotlight table, Mr. Gross sold 15,000 shares, 38% of his
holdings, for $645,000 on April 4, according to SEC filings.
Mr. Gross and the company declined to comment. Mr. Trust
couldn't be reached.</p>
<p>The other five Limited insiders each sold between 1,000
and 60,365 shares. In New York Stock Exchange composite
trading, Limited shares finished at $41.375, up 25 cents.</p>
<p>Since March 21, insiders at Quiksilver, a Costa Mesa,
Calif., apparel retailer, have sold a total of 130,000 of its
shares. Randall Hunt, a vice president and director, sold
50,000 shares, retaining a stake of 350,700. Charles E.
Crowe, a vice president and director, also sold 50,000
shares, 19% of his total holdings. All the insiders sold at
share prices ranging from $23.53 to $25.38. The company
declined comment on the sales, and Messrs. Hunt and Crowe
couldn't be reached.</p>
<p>Quiksilver stock closed in over-the-counter trading at
$27.50, up 25 cents.</p>
