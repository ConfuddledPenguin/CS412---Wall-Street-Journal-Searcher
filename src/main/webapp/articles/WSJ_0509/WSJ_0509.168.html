	<p class="article-leader">An arbitration panel awarded damages under the federal
racketeering law to Kerr-McGee Refining Corp. in what was
apparently the first use of the law by arbitrators.
   The Supreme Court affirmed the right of arbitrators to
make such awards in 1987. Because damages under the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law automatically are
tripled, the Kerr-McGee award amounted to $512,520.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The case involved an incident in which Kerr-McGee
Refining, a unit of Kerr-McGee Corp. of Oklahoma City, Okla.,
had chartered a tanker from Triumph Tankers Ltd. to transport
oil. The three-member arbitration panel found that in March
1984, Triumph Tankers illegally took a substantial quantity
of oil from Kerr-McGee by diverting the oil into a secret
tank in the tanker. The panel found that because Triumph had
converted cargo for its own use on previous voyages, there
was a "pattern" of unlawful activity. To win a case under the
civil portion of the RICO statute, a plaintiff must prove a
pattern of serious wrongdoing conducted through a business or
other enterprise.</p>
<p>Kerr-McGee's contract with Triumph had a clause mandating
that disputes be arbitrated rather than tried by a court.</p>
<p>Joseph C. Smith, a New York attorney for Triumph, declined
to comment on the case. The tanker Kerr-McGee chartered has
since been sold for scrap. John P. Vayda, a New York attorney
for Kerr-McGee, said Kerr-McGee doesn't know where Triumph is
based or whether the company is still in business.</p>
<p>Mr. Vayda said he believes the arbitrators' decision will
serve as a "very large deterrent" and will show "that
arbitration shouldn't be treated lightly." But he said it's
unclear whether Kerr-McGee will be able to collect damages
from the company.</p>
<p>The arbitration award that Triumph would be required to
pay is in addition to a previous partial award of $332,138
the arbitrators granted to Kerr-McGee in September 1988. The
latest award includes $368,496 in damages and $111,544 in
legal fees and out-of-pocket expenses, as well as other fees.</p>
<p>In a dissenting opinion, Alexis Nichols, one of the
arbitrators, called Kerr-McGee "greedy," and warned that
"although one arbitration does not establish a precedent,
aggressive maritime attorneys, who ordinarily handle
run-of-the-mill commercial maritime disputes, will henceforth
be tempted to also plead treble damages under the civil RICO
statute, having nothing to lose and everything to gain."</p>

<p>HYATT LEGAL SERVICES must pay damages in AIDS
discrimination case.</p>
<p>Hyatt was ordered to pay $157,000 to a former regional
partner in Philadelphia for removing him from his job because
he has acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The amount, which
includes $50,000 in punitive damages, is believed to be the
highest award in the country in an AIDS-related employment
discrimination case, according to the Lambda Legal Defense
and Education Fund in New York, a national group that tracks
AIDS-related issues.</p>
<p>In a 41-page opinion, federal Judge Raymond J. Broderick
in Philadelphia found Hyatt's conduct "not merely inexcusably
insensitive and illegal, but so outrageous that the sanction
of punitive damages is warranted."</p>
<p>Hyatt is the nation's biggest provider of prepaid legal
service plans. In a prepared statement, the firm conceded
that "in retrospect" it may have mishandled the matter and
said it would not appeal. "Hyatt Legal Services believed that
its conduct . . . was a fair and honest balancing of its
responsibilities," the firm added.</p>
<p>The case, involving Clarence B. Cain, 38, is not the first
to go against an employer for discriminating against an
employee with AIDS; federal courts in California and
Louisiana have made similar rulings. But it is the first to
test Pennsylvania's recently enacted Human Resources Act,
which requires employers not only to accommodate AIDS victims
in the workplace but to allow them to work at their
accustomed jobs.</p>
<p>Mr. Cain, who was stricken with AIDS 1 1/2 years after
becoming Hyatt's regional manager in Philadelphia, was
offered three alternatives several days after his superiors
learned the news: a $12,000 severance package, a demotion
with a 50% pay cut to a staff position in Virginia or help
getting treatment at an experimental AIDS treatment program.</p>
<p>Judge Broderick, who described Mr. Cain as a "brilliant
attorney with a promising future," wrote that he found the
choices "a corrupt assault" on Mr. Cain's dignity.</p>
<p>"The court sent the message loud and clear," said Richard
J. Silverberg, Mr. Cain's attorney. "You can't {remove}
someone with AIDS who can still do his job simply because he
has contracted the disease."</p>
<p>Mr. Cain currently is hospitalized in Newport News, Va.,
in serious condition.</p>

<p>BEATRICE FOODS CO. prevails against appeal by families of
leukemia victims in toxic-waste suit.</p>
<p>The refusal by the First U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to
grant the families a new trial appears to end what the
Boston-based court called "this long safari of a case."</p>
<p>The families had sued Beatrice and W.R. Grace & Co. in
1982, alleging that toxic chemicals dumped by the companies
polluted two suburban wells in Woburn, Mass., and caused
eight cases of leukemia, resulting in five deaths.</p>
<p>A jury in 1986 found that Grace had been negligent in
dumping the chemicals but that Chicago-based Beatrice had not
contributed to the contamination. Before a planned second
phase of the trial, Grace settled out of court without
admitting liability.</p>
<p>The families appealed the jury verdict for Beatrice, and
the case grew tangled when they later learned that Beatrice
had withheld two environmental studies conducted at the site.
They asked the judge for a new trial, arguing their case had
been damaged by Beatrice's conduct. The judge denied their
request.</p>
<p>In 1988 the appeals court upheld the jury verdict in
Beatrice's favor. But the court asked the trial judge to hold
hearings on whether the new evidence regarding the
environmental studies required a new trial. The trial judge
ruled it did not, and last week the appeals court affirmed
that decision.</p>
<p>The appeals court upheld the trial judge's finding that
even if the families had received the reports they still
would have been unable to prove that Beatrice disposed of the
chemicals at the site.</p>
<p>"The jury has been right all along. There is no basis for
Beatrice's involvement in the case," says Jerome P. Facher,
an attorney for Beatrice.</p>
<p>Jan Schlichtmann, an attorney for the families, said he
will ask the appeals court to rehear the case, arguing the
court did not address all the evidence concerning Beatrice's
misconduct.</p>

<p>MARCUS SCHLOSS & CO. ex-official settles insider-trading
case with SEC.</p>
<p>D. Ronald Yagoda, former head of arbitrage at Marcus
Schloss, was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission
for allegedly receiving inside information on pending stock
transactions from Andrew Solomon, a former analyst at Marcus
Schloss. Mr. Solomon was part of the so-called Yuppie Five
ring, broken up after an SEC inquiry.</p>
<p>In July, a jury acquitted Mr. Yagoda of similar charges in
a criminal case brought by federal prosecutors.</p>
<p>Under the SEC settlement, Mr. Yagoda, without admitting
liability, received a one-year suspension from the securities
industry, according to Stanley S. Arkin and Robert J. Hausen,
his attorneys. The settlement involves no payments by Mr.
Yagoda, they said.</p>
<p>An SEC official said she couldn't comment on the matter as
no settlement has been filed with the court.</p>

<p>FEDERATED LEGAL BILL shows lawyers will reap big fees in
bankruptcy case.</p>
<p>The law firm for Campeau Corp.'s troubled U.S. retail
units, Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores
Corp., submitted a bill of $1.6 million for the first six
weeks of work in the matter. The bill from Jones, Day, Reavis
& Pogue included $290,156 in out-of-pocket expenses.</p>
<p>The total legal bill represented only 85% of the firm's
hourly billings, in addition to 100% of the out-of-pocket
expenses. The Cleveland-based law firm will get the remainder
after the bankruptcy judge in the case approves the fees.
Federated and Allied filed for bankruptcy-court protection on
Jan. 15.</p>
<p>According to filings in bankruptcy court in Cincinnati,
Jones Day professionals logged 9,538 hours at an average rate
of $169 an hour. The average includes billings by law
partners, associates and paralegals. About 40 partners, 55
associates and 25 paralegals worked on the matter.</p>
<p>David Heiman, the partner in charge of the matter, topped
the list, logging 371 hours at $285 an hour.</p>
<p>The firm's disbursements included $85,523 in travel
expenses, $61,294 for food and lodging and $31,385 for
photocopying.</p>

<p>SLEEPING PILL'S side effects are targeted in lawsuit.</p>
<p>Attorneys for two people who are suing Upjohn Co. of
Kalamazoo, Mich., over the widely marketed sedative Halcion
are seeking class-action status for the lawsuit.</p>
<p>Stuart Wechsler, an attorney for the plaintiffs, says he
personally suffered depression, amnesia and other side
effects after taking the drug, and was forced to take a leave
from his law firm of Wechsler Skirnick Harwood Halebian &
Feffer in New York City. Mr. Wechsler isn't a plaintiff.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Cincinnati, seeks
$50,000 in damages for each plaintiff. It alleges that Upjohn
failed to disclose known harmful side effects to the Food and
Drug Administration before Halcion received U.S. approval in
1982.</p>
<p>Upjohn voluntarily withdrew its large-dose version of the
drug in 1987. It continues to market a smaller dose. Dr. Ted
Cooper, chairman and president of Upjohn, declined to comment
on the suit.</p>

<p>STORY OF GOLD-LADEN SHIP kept Khashoggi in contact with
Marcoses, attorney says.</p>
<p>James Linn, attorney for Saudi businessman Adnan
Khashoggi, said his client kept in close touch with the
Marcoses after they fled the Philippines in 1986 not because
he was part of an alleged racketeering conspiracy but because
he was promised a portion of the gold. Federal prosecutors in
the case say Mr. Khashoggi's numerous phone calls to Imelda
and the late Ferdinand Marcos in 1986 were part of an effort
to cover up the alleged racketeering.</p>
<p>In his opening statement to the jury in federal court in
Manhattan, Mr. Linn said, "I'm almost hesitant to mention
this because it sounds crazy, but it's not. Mr. Marcos told
(Mr. Khashoggi) that he had a ship of gold. And President
Marcos told Mr. Khashoggi, `I'll give you 10% of this gold if
you will find a safe port for it.'" Mr. Linn said Mr. Marcos,
who was ousted in February 1986, claimed he would use the
gold to raise an army to restore him to power some day.</p>
<p>"He told Mr. Khashoggi he would give him 10%, 10% of this
whole ship of gold," Mr. Linn said, "and this guy fell for
it." He said Mr. Khashoggi, who is being tried on charges of
obstruction of justice and mail fraud, regularly communicated
with the Marcoses because he wanted the gold -- which never
materialized.</p>
<p>Mr. Khashoggi is being tried alongside Mrs. Marcos, who is
charged with taking more than $160 million from the
Philippines and illegally hiding the assets in investments in
the U.S.</p>

<p>A STORY in the April 5 edition reported that W.R. Grace &
Co. had been found negligent in a chemical-dumping case and
had then settled out of court. The settlement, however, was
reached only after the judge had vacated the negligence
verdict and ordered a new trial.</p>
