	<p class="article-leader">FRANKFURT -- West German tire maker Continental AG
reported higher earnings and, in a move that underlines the
growing concentration of the world tire industry, announced
the acquisition of a Fiat S.p.A. tire subsidiary and a 49%
stake in a Swedish tire company.
   Continental said its earnings rose 17% to 227.8 million
marks ($136.6 million) in 1989 from 194.8 million marks a
year earlier, while sales rose 6% to 8.38 billion marks from
7.91 billion marks in 1988.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Continental also announced it has reached principle
agreement to acquire the industrial rubber activities of
Gilardini S.p.A., a subsidiary of Italian auto maker Fiat,
for an undisclosed amount.</p>
<p>The Fiat unit, called AGES, makes rubber parts for the
automobile industry. The AGES activities will be integrated
into ContiTech, Continental's fast-growing
industrial-products division, which posted a strong rise in
earnings last year.</p>
<p>In the past two years, ContiTech has acquired companies
and plants in France, Spain, and Turkey. ContiTech and AGES
had been cooperating since 1986 through a licensing
agreement.</p>
<p>Continental has also agreed to acquire 49% of Nivis Tyre
AB, a wholly owned subsidiary of Kooperativa Foerbundet
Industri AB of Sweden. Financial terms weren't disclosed.</p>
<p>Within KFI, Nivis acts as a holding company for several
Scandinavian tire activities. The alliance with Nivis will
make Continental the leader in the Scandinavian tire markets
and will permit the Swedish group to survive the growing
competitive pressures in the global tire market, Continental
said.</p>
<p>In February, Continental bought National Tyre Service PLC,
a British tire retailing company, from Generale des
Etablissements Michelin for 400 million marks, following the
purchase of a 13.1% stake in Kwik-Fit Holding PLC, another
British tire retailer. Last summer, the company took over the
tire operations of Marbor S.A. of Portugal, and in 1987,
Continental bought U.S. tire maker General Tire & Rubber Co.
from GenCorp Inc. for $650 million.</p>
