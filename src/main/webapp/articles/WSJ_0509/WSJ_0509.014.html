	<p class="article-leader">Hewlett-Packard Co., Palo Alto, Calif., expanded its HP
9000 family of Unix-based minicomputers with the introduction
of a new entry-level machine, the Model 822S.
   The new computer will be priced at $27,900 and is
scheduled to become available in June.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Model 822S, like others in the 9000 family, uses
reduced instruction set computing, or RISC, technology, and
is designed to serve the client-server and laboratory
environment.</p>
<p>A server is a computer within a network that offers
services to other so-called clients, including personal
computers and workstations, to free them to perform other
tasks.</p>
<p>The introduction of the new model, which brings the 9000
family to 13 minicomputers, is designed to offer
"minicomputer functionality at the price of a multi-user PC,"
said Bernard Guyidon, general manager of Hewlett-Packard's
general systems division.</p>
