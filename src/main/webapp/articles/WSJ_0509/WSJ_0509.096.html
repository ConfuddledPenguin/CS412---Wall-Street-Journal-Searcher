	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The U.S. plans to sign an agreement
providing about $60 million in food aid to Bolivia over the
next three years, the White House said.
   The food measure, to be signed today, was one of several
trade and economic-assistance measures scheduled for adoption
in the course of Bolivian President Jaime Paz Zamora's
official visit to Washington this week. President Bush, who
met with President Paz Zamora in February as part of the
Latin American summit against illegal drugs, praised the
Bolivian leader after a White House meeting yesterday.
President Bush cited Mr. Paz Zamora's efforts to combat
illegal drugs and restructure Bolivia's economy.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Bush particularly noted the Bolivian leader's strides
since the drug summit in curbing Bolivian production of coca
leaves used to make cocaine.</p>
<p>The Bush administration has already signed an agreement
with Bolivia to set up a joint Commission on Trade and
Investment to explore ways of increasing legitimate commerce
between the two countries. In addition to the food aid, the
U.S. and Bolivia are slated to sign accords for
drug-awareness programs and to aid Bolivia in combating a
prevalent, frequently fatal affliction called "Chagas
disease."</p>
<p>The White House said the administration is also preparing
agreements governing extradition, an umbrella agreement on
narcotics, and a supplemental package of military aid to
combat narcotics traffickers.</p>
