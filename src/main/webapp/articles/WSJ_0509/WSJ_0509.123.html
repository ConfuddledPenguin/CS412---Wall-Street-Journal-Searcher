	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- President Bush himself decided that the time
is ripe now to seek a big deal with Congress on cutting the
federal budget deficit, even though he knows that succeeding
would require him to swallow his no-new-taxes pledge.
   After resisting repeated arguments by his budget director
and other aides that he move to begin serious negotiations
with Congress, senior Bush advisers say, the president
concluded over the past few weeks that rising interest rates
and a growing sense of concern in Congress about the
resulting growth of the federal deficit had created an
opening for a bipartisan agreement. For the first time in his
presidency, one adviser says, Mr. Bush "is certain this is
the time to try" for a sweeping deal with Congress to get rid
of the deficit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Aides insist that Mr. Bush still is the most reluctant
figure in his own administration to endorse tax increases.
But they also acknowledge that the price for success in
negotiations will be acceptance of some kind of tax
increases.</p>
<p>And while they contend, predictably, that Mr. Bush will
remain adamantly opposed to raising income-tax rates, they
hint he may well accept some other kinds of taxes if he gets
something he covets in return: changes in the federal budget
process giving him more control over congressional-spending
decisions. Mr. Bush would like a line-item veto, but advisers
say some other kind of new presidential authority to block
spending projects might succeed.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush could still walk away from discussions altogether
if he doesn't think he'll accomplish his goals. He may also
find the political price for his own party too steep in this
election year. "If they can't get Congress to go beyond what
they've been willing to do in the past, then I'm for walking
away," says Mitchell Daniels, a former Reagan White House
political director, who added that "even a large part of the
Republican base" would like to see Mr. Bush try finally to
put the deficit problem behind him.</p>
<p>"What's at stake here is the overall economy," Mr. Bush
told lawmakers in a meeting yesterday, according to
participants.</p>
<p>The seeds of the current negotiations have been
germinating for a long time, White House aides say. They
contend that Mr. Bush, who publicly dismissed the need for
seeking a big budget agreement with Congress in an interview
just three months ago, privately sensed all along that a
serious budget summit would be necessary sometime this year.</p>
<p>Originally, Bush advisers say, the White House thinking
was that such a session might be put off until about the
beginning of June. But various factors have merged to move up
that timetable.</p>
<p>Above all, interest rates have remained too high for the
Bush administration's tastes, threatening already weak
economic growth. And higher interest rates, in turn, are
driving up the size of the federal deficit because the
government is shelling out more in its own interest payments.
Pressure on the Federal Reserve Board can moderate interest
rates somewhat, Bush aides say, but the only way to keep them
down is to attack the deficit.</p>
<p>Because government interest payments are rising and
federal receipts have been running below projections, it has
become clear that it will take a far bigger deficit-reduction
package to avoid the across-the-board spending cuts required
by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. At the same time,
the mounting costs of the thrift bailout are putting added
pressure on already tenuous budget assumptions. Business
representatives were beginning to warn both the White House
and Congress that economic conditions at the grass roots
weren't encouraging.</p>
<p>In addition, some administration aides suspect that a
significant reduction in the deficit and, in turn, in U.S.
interest rates is the only way to correct what they consider
an imbalance in the relationship between the dollar and the
yen. The yen has been relatively weak recently, which tends
to boost Japan's foreign sales and make it harder to cut
Tokyo's trade surplus with the U.S.</p>
<p>Increasingly worried about the same signs of possible
recession in an election year, Democrats in Congress began
moving on the budget issue faster than the White House
expected. The result was that Mr. Bush, who prides himself on
his sense of political timing, sensed that suddenly
"everybody knew we had to fix the problem," an adviser says.</p>
<p>Even some people outside the government share Mr. Bush's
sense that the timing may be right for the deal that has
eluded Washington before. "I am convinced that the president
of the United States understands the seriousness of the
problem and wants a serious, multiyear budget deal that
doesn't just produce goose eggs on the bottom line but helps
the country move into the twentieth century," says Carol Cox,
head of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a
bipartisan group of former government officials. Ms. Cox has
been skeptical before about the chances for meaningful budget
agreements.</p>
<p>The Bush administration now wants to push for a rapid
conclusion to negotiations, both to create pressure on
negotiators to produce results and to prevent political
posturing from undermining the process.</p>
<p>But there are two big problems. One is Mr. Bush's
continued reluctance to endorse tax increases. Many
administration aides think that accepting any increase in
income-tax rates will look too much like a violation of Mr.
Bush's no-new-taxes campaign pledge. Besides, one senior
adviser says, Mr. Bush has become convinced over time that
increased federal revenue won't be used to cut the federal
deficit but will be siphoned off by Congress for spending
projects.</p>
<p>And that creates the second problem: Mr. Bush's desire for
a change in the way the budget is handled. Administration
aides suspect that Mr. Bush is prepared to swallow some other
taxes -- such as cigarette, alcohol and fuel taxes --
provided that the negotiations produce what the president
considers a comprehensive budget package, including new
presidential authority over the budget.</p>
<p>One adviser even calls the desire for a procedural change
"the single most important thing" to Mr. Bush in the search
for a permanent deficit solution. Some presidential aides
suggest that Democrats don't understand how strongly Mr. Bush
feels about the issue.</p>
<p>In the end, though, it doesn't seem likely that either Mr.
Bush or congressional Democrats would allow a big budget deal
to collapse over an argument about the budget process. In
fact, some Democrats in Congress now have begun calling for
procedural changes of their own. They want to alter budgetary
accounting for Social Security to defuse charges that they
are using the Social Security trust fund to reduce the
deficit.</p>
<p>Some administration aides say that, ultimately, a bigger
problem for Democrats may be to swallow the kinds of cutbacks
in entitlement programs, such as farm subsidies, that would
be necessary to close a budget deal.</p>
