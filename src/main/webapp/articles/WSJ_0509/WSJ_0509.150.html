	<p class="article-leader">Buoyed by bullish news from the bond market,
over-the-counter stocks managed to hold their own after
dipping in intraday trading.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index edged up 0.61, a 0.14% gain, to
close at 431.84, after slipping slightly most of the day.
Volume increased to 133.8 million shares from 122.6 million.
However, the margin between advancing and declining shares
narrowed, 965 to 922, and more stocks hit new lows than new
highs, 109 to 97.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yesterday's successful quarterly auction of three-year
Treasury notes supported OTC stocks, said Robert Padala, vice
president of OTC trading at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, New
York. "We'll be going right on the heels of the bond market,"
Mr. Padala added, anticipating a stronger OTC market if the
bond market rallies today.</p>
<p>Lance Zipper, head of OTC trading at Kidder Peabody,
agreed that institutions seemed to gain confidence from the
bond market and bought some traditional OTC leaders: MCI
Communications gained 3/4 to 39; Apple Computer rose 1/4 to
41 3/4, and Sun Microsystems advanced 1/4 to 25 7/8.</p>
<p>Mr. Zipper added that he also saw interest in some
regional airlines such as Comair Holdings, which rose 1 1/4
to 17 5/8, and Atlantic Southeast Air, up 1/8 to 17 5/8.</p>
<p>However, Walter Carucci, vice president of Carr
Securities, which makes markets in OTC stocks for other
dealers, said he continues to see a "tremendous" divergence
between better-known issues and "the rest of the universe."
Mr. Carucci said that split continues to keep him bearish
about the market.</p>
<p>California automobile insurers, among them Mercury General
of Los Angeles and 20th Century Industries of Woodland Hills,
got a boost after this newspaper reported that a hearing
officer's interpretation of California's insurance-overhaul
initiative, Proposition 103, might deal a potentially
devastating blow to proponents of automobile insurance
reform.</p>
<p>Mercury General climbed 1/2 to 17 and 20th Century rose 2
to 22 5/8. The Nasdaq insurance index was among the day's
leading indexes, gaining 0.63% to 484.35.</p>
<p>A potential takeover move triggered a 1 5/8 rise to 7 1/8
in shares of Horizons Industries, a Calhoun, Ga., carpet
manufacturer. A group including Beaulieu of America Inc., a
Dalton, Ga., yarn and carpet manufacturer, announced it holds
a 13.3% stake in Horizon and might seek control.</p>
<p>Sweden's L.M. Ericsson Telephone Co. rose 4 7/8 to 165 7/8
after the international telecommunications company reported
that pretax earnings for the first quarter ended March 31
nearly doubled. The company said it expects pretax earnings
for the year to be up 25% over 1989.</p>
<p>Dress Barn was among the day's mostactive issues, closing
up 1/2 at 10 on 1.1 million shares. The Stamford, Conn.,
apparel concern reported that sales for the third quarter
ended April 28 rose 18% and estimated earnings in the quarter
rose to 18 to 19 cents a share from 17 cents a year earlier.
The rosy sales news prompted Shearson Lehman Hutton analyst
Stacy Ruchlamer to repeat her "buy" rating on the stock,
according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report.</p>
<p>Concord Camera jumped 1 1/8 to 3 7/8 on more than 10 times
average volume. Michael Rea, chief financial officer of the
Avenel, N.J., maker and distributor of cameras and related
products, told DJPIR he had no explanation for the gain and
declined to comment on the company's earnings outlook.
Concord Camera is due to report earnings for the third
quarter ended in March by May 15.</p>
<p>Calgene rose 1 5/8 to 9 after Piper Jaffray Hopwood
analyst George Dahlman repeated his "buy" opinion on the
stock, according to DJPIR. Calgene is a Davis, Calif.,
developer of genetically engineered agricultural products.
Mr. Dahlman said he thought the shares had come under
pressure because of some negative publicity by
environmentalists and a lack of major announcements. The
company is expected to report earnings for the second fiscal
quarter by May 15, according to DJPIR.</p>
<p>Washington Bancorp rebounded 1 1/4 to close at 4 3/4 after
Monday's 5 1/2-point dive. The holding company of National
Bank of Washington, said Monday it's discontinuing its
commercial paper program and isn't able to repay about $36.7
million of unsecured commercial paper obligations.</p>
<p>Jetborne International, which soared 7/8 Monday to close
at 2 13/16, closed unchanged after the Miami overhauler and
reseller of aircraft components said it's in preliminary
talks with three organizations to buy part or all of the
company. Jetborne said it also is considering spinning off
one of its subsidiaries to the public.</p>
<p>Bancorp Hawaii tumbled 2 to 44 3/4 after the Honolulu bank
filed a secondary offering of 1.5 million shares of common
stock.</p>
<p>American Integrity dropped 1 3/8 to 6 3/8 after the
Philadelphia insurance company reported operating income for
the first quarter ended March 31 of six cents a share, down
from 20 cents a year earlier. The company also hired an
investment adviser to review strategic alternatives.</p>
<p>Pinkerton slipped 1/2 to 17 1/4 after the Van Nuys,
Calif., security company said it expects to take a $2.6
million charge in the second quarter for early debt
repayment. Pinkerton, which had an initial public offering
April 4 at $14 a share, reported net income for the first
quarter ended March 23 rose to 14 cents a share from 11 cents
a year earlier.</p>
<p>Engineered Support Systems slipped 1/8 to 2 5/8 after the
St. Louis maker of military ground support systems said
delays in beginning production of several key programs will
hurt revenue in fiscal 1990, ending Oct. 31. Some production
and related revenue previously expected in 1990 won't appear
until fiscal 1991, said the company's chairman and chief
executive officer, Michael F. Shanahan Sr.</p>
<p>General Parametrics lost 5/8 to close at 2 3/8. On Monday,
the Berkeley, Calif., maker of computer graphics products
said it expects to report a net loss for the second quarter,
ended April 30, the company's first quarterly loss since it
became public in 1986.</p>
<p>Siliconix fell 1/2 to 1 13/16. On Monday, the Santa Clara,
Calif., maker of semiconductors and circuits said it's in
negotiations with International Rectifier to resolve
four-year-old patent litigation. Last month, Siliconix filed
for Chapter 11 protection under the federal Bankruptcy Code,
one day after a federal District Court in Los Angeles ruled
Siliconix had infringed five of International Rectifier's
patents.</p>
