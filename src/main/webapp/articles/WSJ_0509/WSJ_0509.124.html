	<p class="article-leader">Southwest Gas Corp.'s first-quarter net income fell 5% to
$21.3 million, or $1.08 a share, due to lower earnings from
gas operations and from the company's thrift unit.
   In the year-ago quarter, Las Vegas, Nev.-based Southwest
Gas had net income of $22.5 million, or $1.17 a share. The
company had about 19.4 million average shares outstanding in
the latest quarter, compared with about 18.8 million a year
ago.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Revenue rose 6% to $273.6 million from $258.3 million.</p>
<p>Southwest said its gas operations contributed $20 million
to net income in the latest quarter, compared with $20.7
million a year earlier. The company blamed the dip on costs
related to pipeline replacement programs and facilities
expansion to meet increased natural gas demand.</p>
<p>The thrift unit, PriMerit Bank, contributed $1.3 million
to consolidated net income, compared with $1.8 million a year
ago. The 36% decline was mainly due to lower real-estate
development income and increased expenses related to
expansion of the thrift's branch networks in Nevada and
Arizona, the company said.</p>
