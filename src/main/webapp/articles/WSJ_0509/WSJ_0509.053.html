	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Treasury Department, ending months of
uncertainty, told Congress it would offer a plan this week to
shift regulation of stock-index futures to the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
   The move, announced by Treasury Undersecretary Robert
Glauber at a Senate Agriculture Committee hearing, is likely
to reignite the debate over where and how to regulate the
products. Currently, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
oversees stock-index futures, traded on the Chicago commodity
exchanges.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Stock-index futures, used mostly by large institutions to
hedge risk, allow investors to bet on the movement of a
basket of stocks without owning the actual shares. They are
controversial because they are used in program trading and
have been cited as accelerating the stock-market crashes of
1987 and 1989.</p>
<p>The idea of switching jurisdiction has gained support in
recent months among lawmakers on securities committees. But
the commodity exchanges, the CFTC and most members of the
Agriculture Committees argue that futures products are used
differently from stocks and should be overseen by the CFTC,
which they contend better understands the products. Moreover,
they say, the CFTC has been more encouraging in allowing
commodity markets to introduce innovative new products than
the SEC has been with the stock markets.</p>
<p>That view is disputed by the administration and the
securities industry, which counter that legal battles by the
commodity exchanges have prohibited new products from being
introduced on the stock exchanges. And they assert that the
same agency should oversee stocks, options and stock-index
futures.</p>
<p>The Bush administration's plan is expected to substitute
for an amendment that Sen. Slade Gorton (R., Wash.) has
proposed to attach to a bill that would beef up the CFTC. The
bill, unanimously passed by the agriculture panel in
November, is sponsored by committee Chairman Patrick Leahy
(D., Vt.), who vehemently opposes any shift of jurisdiction
to the SEC. The amendment, which offers a simpler method for
switching jurisdiction over index futures to the SEC, has
hamstrung the bill.</p>
<p>Still, Sen. Leahy said he would urge the Senate leadership
to allow the administration's amendment to be debated on the
floor soon to "vote 'em up or vote 'em down."</p>
<p>Mr. Glauber said the administration also will propose
giving the SEC oversight over futures margins, although the
exchanges would retain primary responsibility for setting
margin levels. Margins are the good-faith money needed to
trade. Currently, the exchanges basically have free rein over
margin setting, with the CFTC allowed to change them only in
specific emergency situations.</p>
<p>Margins on stock-index futures are important because they
also have been cited as helping exacerbate the crashes. Both
the Treasury and the SEC repeatedly have argued that when
futures margins are allowed to slip too low, it puts the
stock market at risk by encouraging speculation in
stock-index futures, which "washes back" into the stock
market through program trades.</p>
<p>Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board,
said he supports placing authority for futures and stock
margins with the same regulator, preferably the SEC.
Currently, the Fed regulates securities margins.</p>
<p>"We must recognize that what we now have is a single
market with uncoordinated and even conflicting regulation,"
Mr. Glauber said. "We need more unified regulation as the
umbrella under which specific intermarket issues can be much
more easily resolved."</p>
<p>Most senators on the panel, as well as CFTC Chairman Wendy
Gramm, vigorously disputed Mr. Glauber's proposal. Many
stridently criticized the SEC for starting an interagency
scrap. "This turf war better not become one where the SEC
tries to make the CFTC look bad," warned Rudy Boschwitz (R.,
Minn.). "This senator is going to very carefully, very
carefully watch what you do."</p>
<p>Added Bob Kerrey (D., Neb.): "I do find an absence of a
compelling case that we need to do something here." He called
the jurisdictional fight "an unfortunate public display."</p>
<p>Mrs. Gramm said a switch of index futures to the SEC
doesn't "withstand objective scrutiny. The CFTC is concerned
that the proposed changes would damage the world leadership
position of the United States futures markets."</p>
<p>SEC Chairman Richard Breeden argued that the SEC wouldn't
overregulate stock-index futures, and he asked that they
remain subject to the Commodity Exchange Act. "It depends on
the mandate we would be given by Congress," he said. "But we
are perfectly comfortable taking as a starting point the
existing {commodities} regulations."</p>
<p>But clearly, some of the commodity practices would test
the SEC. For example, the stock exchanges have a so-called
uptick rule in which investors can't sell a stock short -- a
bet that it will decline -- on a downtick, meaning that the
last price change was downward. Futures markets have no
similar rule.</p>
<p>Moreover, Mr. Breeden said he would oppose "dual trading,"
which gives a trader the right to trade for his own account
and for customers. But stock-exchange specialists are allowed
to dual trade, Mr. Breeden conceded under stiff questioning
from Sen. Leahy.</p>
<p>Sen. Leahy said he would submit a series of technical
questions to Mr. Breeden so that the SEC chairman could
disclose the specifics of how the securities agency would
monitor stock-index futures.</p>
<p>Chicago Board of Trade Chairman Karsten Mahlmann called
the Treasury proposal a "power grab" by the SEC. The Board of
Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange strongly oppose the
proposed shift of regulatory jurisdiction. Both say they
favor a comprehensive, rather than piecemeal, approach to
reviewing market regulation.</p>
<p>Critics of the exchanges say they have adopted this
posture as a stalling tactic to head off action on the
stock-index futures issue during this congressional session.</p>
