	<p class="article-leader">In the first line of the March 28 Leisure & Arts piece
"Dark Days for Duck," author Michael Pearce says, "I had
stood alone on the levy . . ."
   May I offer the following correction. Levy: the imposition
or collection of an assessment. Levee: an embankment for
preventing flooding.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>When in doubt, remember the lines from that old song,
"Waitin' on the levee, Waitin' for the Robert E. Lee."</p>
