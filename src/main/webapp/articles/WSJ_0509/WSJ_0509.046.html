	<p class="article-leader">SEVEN OAKS INTERNATIONAL Inc. (Memphis, Tenn.) -- Sam A.
Sarno Sr. and Sam A. Sarno Jr. both resigned as directors of
the retail-coupon clearinghouse, citing "other commitments
which prevented them from continuing in service to Seven
Oaks." The elder Mr. Sarno had been a director of the company
since its founding in 1971, and had served as chairman and
chief executive officer until his retirement from the posts
in 1987. The younger Mr. Sarno had been a director since 1980
and had served as president and chief operating officer until
he resigned both posts last year. Following the resignations,
the company's board voted to reduce its number to seven from
nine.</p>
