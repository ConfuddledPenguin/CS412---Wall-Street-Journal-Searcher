	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Sales of imported cars, trucks and buses in Japan
totaled 20,142 units in April, up 26% from a year earlier,
the Japan Automobile Importers' Association said. The rise
reflects continuing strength in consumer demand for luxury
goods and the narrowing price gap between domestic and
imported vehicles.
   The upward trend of imported vehicle sales amid Japan's
continuing economic expansion was further boosted in April,
when a heavy commodity tax on imports was replaced by a lower
consumption tax, lowering sticker prices of foreign cars.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales of passenger cars rose 26% to 19,894 units. Among
these, medium-size cars totaled 10,074, up 20%, while
small-size cars totaled 9,820, up 32%. A total of 242
imported trucks, most of them U.S.-made, were sold, up 105%.</p>
<p>Volkswagen-Audi Group had the largest market share among
all imported vehicles, selling 4,574 units, up 22%. The
second-best seller was Mercedes-Benz, up 9.3% to 3,501.</p>
<p>Sales of U.S.-made vehicles grew 59% to 3,188 units. The
strong overall increase was supported by that of small-size
cars made by Honda USA, the Japanese maker's U.S. subsidiary.
It sold 1,057 units, up 128%.</p>
