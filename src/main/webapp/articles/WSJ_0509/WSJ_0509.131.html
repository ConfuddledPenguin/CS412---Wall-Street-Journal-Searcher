	<p class="article-leader">New York Times Co. delayed plans to launch a weekly
magazine -- working-titled Blocks -- for young New Yorkers.
   A company spokeswoman said the magazine, envisioned as a
supplement to the company's flagship newspaper, the New York
Times, "has been put on hold for the foreseeable future due
to the business environment in the New York area." That
environment has already led to advertising linage slumps at
New York area magazines as well as the New York Times.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Described as a life style and feature magazine, Blocks was
seen as a way to draw a younger audience and new advertisers
to the newspaper. The spokeswoman said the decision to
postpone the magazine "was no reflection on the concept of
the product."</p>
<p>Industry rumors had circulated that the Times would
purchase 7 Days, a weekly magazine for New York that was
folded recently by its owner, Leonard Stern. The Times
spokeswoman wouldn't comment on the acquisition rumor.</p>
