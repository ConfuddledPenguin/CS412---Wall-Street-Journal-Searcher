	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The stock market preserved its winning streak,
as a late burst of buying following a successful start of the
Treasury's quarterly sale of notes and bonds pushed prices
higher in quiet trading.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average ran its string of gains
to seven consecutive sessions, its longest uninterrupted
rally since last July, by climbing 11.94 to 2733.56.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Among broader market measures, Standard & Poor's 500-Stock
Index rose 1.48 to 342.01, the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Index gained 0.66 to 187.11 and the Dow Jones
Equity Market Index added 1.41 to 318.22.</p>
<p>For nearly the entire session, the industrial average
remained stalled in a trading range of about 10 points as
market players awaited the results of the initial phase of
the Treasury's quarterly refunding, a $10.57 billion sale of
three-year notes.</p>
<p>When the results were released about 10 minutes before the
close, the market promptly broke out of that range with the
help of some futures-related program buying and rallied to
session highs.</p>
<p>The average yield of 8.74% on the Treasury's three-year
issue was in line with market forecasts, and the note sale
attracted a record $2.45 billion in noncompetitive offers --
a good sign for the remainder of the three-part refinancing.</p>
<p>The Treasury will sell $10 billion in 10-year notes today
and wrap up the refunding tomorrow with the sale of $10
billion in 30-year bonds.</p>
<p>Advancing and declining issues were about even on the Big
Board for most of the session, but gainers closed with a lead
of 813 to 650. Volume totaled 144,230,000 shares, up from
132.8 million Monday.</p>
<p>Despite the market's late surge, traders said many players
were taking a "wait-and-see" attitude toward stocks amid
fears that interest rates might have to go higher for the
Treasury to complete its refunding, especially the 30-year
bond sale.</p>
<p>"It's just unbelievably dull," said Thomas Gallagher,
managing director in charge of capital commitment at
Oppenheimer & Co., and the next couple of sessions "are
probably going to be just like this" as market players focus
on the Treasury auctions.</p>
<p>With the market's latest advance, the industrial average
surpassed a streak of six consecutive gains set last Oct.
2-9. The average rose for nine consecutive sessions last July
3-14, with broader measures matching that streak.</p>
<p>American General gained 1 1/2 to 50 1/2 on Big Board
composite volume of 2.3 million shares amid rumors that
Nippon Life Insurance and Chubb might make offers for the
company, which has put itself up for sale. Nippon Life was
said to be considering a $60-a-share bid, according to Dow
Jones Professional Investor Report, while Chubb was said to
have an offer of $62 a share under consideration.</p>
<p>An American General spokesman told the investor report he
wasn't aware of any talks between the company and either
rumored suitor. He declined further comment. A Chubb
spokesman called the rumors of its interest "totally
unfounded."</p>
<p>Federal National Mortgage Association rose 3/8 to 35 3/4
on 1.7 million shares. Chairman David O. Maxwell said the
company's capital is "fully adequate to meet extraordinary
adverse conditions, should they arise," and added that Fannie
Mae plans to increase its capital by $2 billion to $2.5
billion by the end of 1991.</p>
<p>CalFed, which rose 1/8 to 17 3/8, topped the list of most
active Big Board issues as a result of dividend-related
trading that pushed its composite volume to 2.5 million
shares. Shares of the thrift carry an 8% dividend yield and
go ex-dividend today.</p>
<p>The savings-and-loan sector was among the market's best
performers; Golden West Financial climbed 3/4 to 28, Great
Western Financial rose 5/8 to 17 1/2 and HomeFed went up 1 to
29 5/8. H.F. Ahmanson, parent of the nation's largest thrift,
rose 1/4 to 18; the company said its core operating earnings
are continuing to increase.</p>
<p>Baxter International added 3/4 to 22 7/8 after projecting
annual increases of 15% to 18% in operating income through
1993 on sales gains of 8% to 10%. Separately, its board
approved the repurchase of as many as 13.5 million common
shares, along with buy-backs involving two preferred issues.</p>
<p>Pan Am rose 1/8 to 2 3/4 as 1.3 million shares were
traded. Chairman Thomas Plaskett told the annual meeting that
the financially troubled company, which has been seeking a
merger partner, has "talked to every other major airline."</p>
<p>Republic New York rose 1 3/4 to 45 1/4. The Federal
Reserve Bank of New York cleared Edmond J. Safra to acquire
as many as 1.5 million additional voting shares of the
company. He already owns about 9.8 million shares, or a 29%
stake.</p>
<p>Ethyl rose 2 1/8 to 27 7/8. The company said it would hold
a news conference tomorrow to announce its plans to ask the
Environmental Protection Agency for approval of a gasoline
additive that it claims will cut automotive emissions, among
other things.</p>
<p>Rowan rose 5/8 to 12 5/8. PaineWebber analyst James
Carroll said that the company's meeting with analysts in New
York was "very positive," and he reiterated an "attractive"
rating on the stock.</p>
<p>Sotheby's Holdings fell 7/8 to 19 5/8 amid pessimism about
the outcome of its auction of contemporary art. Christie's
International, another major auction house, reported somewhat
disappointing results from a contemporary-art sale Monday
night in New York.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 0.25
to 347.58. Volume totaled 13,090,000 shares.</p>
<p>California Energy fell 2 to 9 3/4. Its partners in a
geothermal-energy project in Southern California have filed a
complaint with the American Arbitration Association, in which
they allege the company overcharged them by $17 million
between 1986 and 1989, the San Francisco Chronicle said.</p>
<p>Landmark Land retreated 1 7/8 to 10 3/8 after the Office
of Thrift Supervision, which regulates the company's Oak Tree
Savings Bank unit, objected to the proposed sale of much of
its real estate and resort holdings for $967 million to
developer Barry G. Hon.</p>
<p>ISS International Service System climbed 2 3/4 to 10 1/2.
ISS A-S, the company's major shareholder, offered to buy the
stock it doesn't own for $10 a share.</p>
<p>Catalina Lighting went up 1/2 to 9. The company reached an
agreement with David Moss, its former chairman and chief
executive, under which he won't compete with Catalina for two
years and will serve as a consultant.</p>
<p>Hampton Industries dropped 3/8 to 7 1/2 after reporting a
first-quarter loss of 13 cents a share, compared with net
income of 41 cents a share a year ago.</p>
<p>Cenvill Development slipped 3/8 to 5 3/8. The company
declared a 5% stock dividend in lieu of a cash payout.</p>
