	<p class="article-leader">Stuart Hall Co. is "running slightly ahead" of an earlier
projection of a 52% boost in 1990 earnings per share from
1989, Charles G. Hanson, chairman, said.
   Mr. Hanson, who also is chief executive officer of the
Kansas City, Mo., office and school-products concern, said
Stuart Hall's earnings per share are "a couple of cents
ahead" of an estimate he made at the company's annual meeting
Monday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At the meeting, he said he expects earnings from
continuing operations of 86 cents per share for the fiscal
year, which ends in November. Yesterday, in over-the-counter
national trading, the company's stock closed at $10.50 a
share, up from $8.875 a share on Monday.</p>
<p>He said the company's gross sales for 1990 are forecast at
$127.5 million, up 28% from the year earlier's $99 million.
The company sells a range of office supply products such as
paper and envelopes, as well as school products, to
drugstores and supermarkets.</p>
