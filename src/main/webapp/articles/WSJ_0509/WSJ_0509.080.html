	<p class="article-leader">STERLING HEIGHTS, Mich. -- Ford Motor Co. expects its
combined 1990 share of the U.S. car and light-truck market to
exceed the 24.5% share it recorded last year.
   Officials with the No. 2 auto maker are making the
prediction even though Ford's sales and car-market share fell
through the first four months of this year. The company's
January to April sales of 1,147,748 cars and light trucks are
running about 6.6% below year-ago sales; its U.S. car market
share was 22% at the end of April compared with 23% a year
earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Still, Ford Executive Vice President Alexander Trotman
said the auto maker's "production schedules are up and our
share aspirations are still strong." He said higher
production of the recently introduced 1991 Ford Escort and
its soon-to-come twin Mercury Tracer will help Ford pick up
the pace. Ford is also banking on stronger truck sales
because of the new Ford Explorer sport-utility vehicle.</p>
<p>Mr. Trotman made his remarks at a quality-award
presentation to the company's Van Dyke components plant in
this Detroit suburb. He also announced that Ford plans to
convert the plant so it can make a new generation of
electronically controlled automatic transmissions for cars
and light trucks.</p>
<p>Mr. Trotman declined to specify when the changeover would
come, saying the project needed board approval. He said
Ford's directors will likely reach a decision on the project
by the third quarter of this year. Ford officials said it
takes at least three years to complete the changes needed to
make transmissions in a plant.</p>
