	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- Ford Motor Co. won a partial victory in its
battle with inventor Robert W. Kearns when a federal jury
ruled that the auto maker didn't willfully infringe his
patents for an intermittent windshield wiper system.
   The jury is scheduled to continue deliberations today to
decide how much money, if any, Mr. Kearns should collect from
Ford.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Attorneys for Mr. Kearns argued during the two-week
penalty phase of the trial that Ford should pay the Maryland
inventor as much as $325 million. The attorneys also
contended that Ford engineers and executives didn't "care one
way or the other" about Mr. Kearns's patent claims.</p>
<p>Had the jury agreed that Ford's infringement was willful,
U.S. District Court Judge Avern Cohn could have doubled or
tripled any financial award.</p>
<p>Any payments awarded to Mr. Kearns would be compensation
for Ford's use over 17 years of three windshield wiper
systems that infringed on at least three of Mr. Kearns's
patents, according to his attorneys.</p>
<p>A Ford spokesman declined comment yesterday, citing a gag
order imposed by the judge in the case. Lawyers for Mr.
Kearns also declined to comment.</p>
<p>Ford argued in an earlier phase of the trial that while
its wiper systems were similar to those patented by Mr.
Kearns, those patents were invalid and thus there was no
infringement. But the jury ruled in January that Mr. Kearns's
patents were valid, and in effect said Ford had infringed the
Kearns patents.</p>
<p>But the jurors apparently agreed with Ford lawyers who
argued that company officials acted in good faith and "didn't
believe they had stolen" Mr. Kearns's ideas. Moreover, Ford
lawyers argued that company officials acted responsibly
during negotiations with Mr. Kearns and his lawyers that
dragged on for nearly seven years.</p>
<p>Mr. Kearns sued Ford in 1978, charging the auto maker with
infringing his patents for an electronically controlled,
intermittent windshield wiper system. He subsequently filed
similar suits against nearly every other major auto maker in
the world. The Ford case is the first to go to trial.
Intermittent windshield wipers are offered as a standard or
optional feature on millions of cars.</p>
