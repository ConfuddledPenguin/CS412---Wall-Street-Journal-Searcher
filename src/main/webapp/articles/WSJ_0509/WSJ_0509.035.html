	<p class="article-leader">SPECIAL SESSIONS loom in more state legislatures than
usual.
   And the small-business community, its lobbyists say,
expects to be monitoring most of them; many sessions will
focus on fiscal and tax issues. Eight states -- Arizona,
California, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Texas, Washington, West
Virginia and Wisconsin -- already have had at least one
special session this year, some of which carried over from
1989. Texas is in its second special session this year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Officials of the National Conference of State Legislatures
say a dozen or more other states are likely to hold special
sessions. Particularly thorny issues trigger them, such as
Mississippi's struggle over how to pay for increased
education spending. Workers' compensation may spark special
sessions in West Virginia and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Small-business lobbyists say special sessions often
require them to stay especially alert for tax and other
measures that hurt their constituents.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>STATE AND LOCAL issues prompt small businesses to step up
lobbying efforts.</p>
<p>Grass-roots lobbying "has intensified this year as never
before" as more legislatures consider issues the
small-business community traditionally opposes, says Don L.
Robinson, associate director of the National Federation of
Independent Business, the largest small-business
organization.</p>
<p>The catalyst: A growing number of measures first
considered in Congress that are filtering down to the states
-- from mandated benefits in health plans and parental leave
for employees to raising state minimum wage levels and
certain environmental issues. Threatened increases in
capital-gains and other taxes also spur small businesses.
"There's a lot more concern this year and our members are
getting madder," says Lewis Shattuck, president of the
Smaller Business Association of New England.</p>
<p>The NFIB and other small-business groups are sending out
legislative alerts through mailings and telephone networks to
notify their members. Small businesses in Florida, Illinois,
Minnesota and Pennsylvania have had especially busy years.
"Small-business owners respond best to pocketbook issues,"
says Mr. Robinson. One primary issue is sharply rising
workers-compensation insurance rates.</p>
<p>The small-business lobby in some states got busy even
before legislative sessions began by holding breakfasts to
discuss issues and strategies. "We're not waiting until the
gavel falls," says one small-business activist.</p>

<p>WESTERN STATES have the highest concentration of small
businesses.</p>
<p>Unpublished Labor Department data show that businesses
with fewer than 10 workers account for at least 80% of all
the businesses in four states: Wyoming, South Dakota, Montana
and North Dakota. One reason is that those states have a
dearth of large employers.</p>
<p>Overall, three of four U.S. businesses have fewer than 10
workers. Several of the states with the lowest percentage of
small businesses are major industrial states, such as
Indiana, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Michigan.</p>
<p>But the fourth-lowest state, surprisingly, is Utah, which
has a number of medium-sized companies with 10 to 100
workers.</p>

<p>RIVERBOAT GAMBLING is picking up steam in several states
that border the Mississippi River. The return of 19th
century-style gaming riverboats has been allowed in
Mississippi since April 1 and will take effect next year in
Illinois and Iowa. There is gambling talk in Missouri and
Wisconsin as well. Small businesses along the river think the
gambling boats will spur tourists -- and business. In Iowa,
one study commissioned by gambling supporters said one
riverboat could generate $50 million in annual tourist
revenue and create 2,800 jobs in the Quad Cities area.</p>

<p>FAMILY-OWNED manufacturing businesses in Seattle can get
help on succession plans. The Seattle Worker Center helps
develop succession plans that will be in place when an owner
retires. County officials worry that without such help, many
family-run factories will close. A survey finds that at 369
manufacturing firms in King County, the owner is at least 50
years old, and one in five owners hasn't any plans to
transfer ownership or business and management
responsibilities. Among other things, the Worker Center's
Business Succession Project encourages succession planning
and employee ownership.</p>

<p>EXPORT HOTLINE for small businesses begins operating.</p>
<p>The toll-free service was started by the Small Business
Foundation of America, Boston, which focuses on
small-business issues. John C. Rennie, president, says the
hotline seeks to become a "one-stop shop" for the beginning
exporter rather than simply a referral service.</p>
<p>The hotline, which has been getting several dozen calls a
week since it began March 26, provides information about
export financing, documentation, licensing and insurance,
product distribution, and sources of further assistance. Much
of the information is made available by Export Network of
Bethesda, Md., which maintains more than a dozen data bases.
The hotline also provides a calendar of trade events in the
New England region.</p>
<p>For callers outside Massachusetts, the number is
800-243-7232; for calls within the Bay State, 800-244-7232.
Two foundation employees staff the line from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
EDT weekdays.</p>
