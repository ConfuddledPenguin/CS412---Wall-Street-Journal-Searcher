	<p class="article-leader">It's graduation time, so the broader culture is once again
learning that the U.S. academy has become an ideological
foxhole. A part of society supposedly committed to free
debate and inquiry has become a redoubt of intolerance and
even of censorship.
   The latest episodes occurred last week. Students at the
University of Northern Colorado at Greeley protested an
invitation to Linda Chavez to speak at its May 12
commencement. At Wellesley, the elite women's college, 150
students signed a petition protesting a speaking invitation
to Barbara Bush. The First Lady's offense, said the young
feminists, was to have "gained recognition through the
achievements of her husband."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Birds gotta fly and students must protest, of course, and
at least Wellesley didn't take them too seriously.
Incredibly, however, the faculty senate at Northern Colorado
voted unanimously to "disinvite" Ms. Chavez, a former
Coloradan who served in the Reagan administration. Even more
incredibly, school president Robert Dickeson disowned his
earlier defense of "free speech" and issued a press release
disinviting her. The Supreme Soviet may be full of debate
these days, but in Greeley everyone agrees. We reprint Mr.
Dickeson's statement in its full glory nearby.</p>
<p>Lest anyone think these cases are unusual, consider other
campus news:</p>
<p>Emory University in Atlanta, among other schools, has
banned certain kinds of speech. Emory now bans
"discriminatory harassment," which it defines as "conduct
(oral, written, graphic or physical) directed against any
person or group . . . that has the purpose or reasonably
foreseeable effect of creating an offensive, demeaning,
intimidating or hostile environment." The policy is ambiguous
enough to fit any prejudice, yet Emory President James Laney
insists it doesn't abridge freedom of speech.</p>
<p>In a symbolic protest at Harvard Law School, professor
Derrick Bell, who is black, has gone on strike until a
minority woman is named to the faculty. Though about half of
Harvard's recent appointments have been minorities or women,
Mr. Bell wants a "role model" for the school's black women
students. Merit apparently must take a back seat to race and
gender.</p>
<p>Stanford Law School Dean Paul Brest recently sent a memo
to all students repudiating Marine Corps recruiting flyers.
The Marines' Judge Advocate Program isn't good enough for
Stanford, the dean wrote, "because it is not in compliance
with the School's Non-Discrimination Policy with respect to
sexual orientation." ROTC programs elsewhere have been deemed
unfit because they don't accept homosexuals.</p>
<p>What is especially troubling is that these episodes are
justified in the name of "diversity" or "tolerance." They are
supposed to fight "bigotry," yet they impose a new orthodoxy
of their own. Ms. Chavez's offense was to oppose bilingual
education programs (though her Colorado speech was going to
be about the meaning of freedom). Apparently an Hispanic
isn't supposed to think for herself. A professor at Emory
better think twice about critiquing affirmative action or
risk being brought up on "anti-diversity" charges. Race,
gender and homosexuality are made taboo subjects -- unless
you hold the approved point of view.</p>
<p>These new censors are actually the enemies of American
diversity. We've long supported immigration by all races, but
a melting pot requires some common cultural signposts, for
example, the English language. This doesn't mean English-only
laws, but probably should mean English, rather than
bilingual, instruction in elementary schools. While keeping
their own cultural heritage alive, it's imperative that
Hispanics assimilate into the broader American culture, as
indeed most are doing, rather than become self-segregated
into an aggrieved "group." As for hiring, we have no problem
with voluntary, private affirmative action to ensure a
diverse work force, but quotas and government coercion risk
setting race against race.</p>
<p>American universities are the best in the world,
especially in the hard sciences. Yet this is all the more
reason to protect free inquiry when it's under attack, as it
now seems to be in the "softer" disciplines, especially the
humanities. The humanities faculties have attracted more than
their share of the Woodstock Generation and its radical
politics. These intellectual refugees think America can be
explained only in terms of race, gender, class and,
increasingly, "sexual orientation." The academy's tenure
system then protects the mediocre from the market forces that
prevail in politics or business.</p>
<p>Happily, a counterattack may be under way. The liberal
Denver Post defended Linda Chavez. Harvard Law Dean Robert
Clark has stressed the importance of merit, despite Derrick
Bell. A group based in Princeton, the National Association of
Scholars, has formed to fight the new campus censors
nationwide.</p>
<p>Ms. Chavez plans to make her own modest contribution by
buying each of Northern Colorado's 750 students a copy of the
U.S. Constitution, something they obviously haven't read as
undergraduates. Sooner or later, glasnost may arrive even on
the American campus.</p>
