	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A Census Bureau study shows that childbirth
in many cases has become a brief work interruption instead of
the "career-halting event" it often was for women a
generation ago, a trend facilitated by the growth in
employer-provided maternity-leave benefits.
   "In the early 1960s, the vast majority of women either in
the months before or after the birth took at least a year off
from work. Now, only about one-third take 12 or more months,"
said Martin O'Connell, chief of the Census Bureau's
fertility-statistics branch.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. O'Connell, who wrote the section of the report dealing
with maternity benefits, points out that women today have
more job skills, greater commitment to jobs and are more able
to pay for the child-care assistance they need in order to go
back to work after the birth of a child.</p>
<p>But his research also indicates "a very, very strong
factor" in women's rapid return to work is the provision of
maternity benefits by employers, including leaves with and
without pay and guarantees they can retain their jobs and
seniority after such leaves. Such benefits often spare women
the burden of looking for work anew after childbirth, and
strengthen their ties to employers.</p>
<p>In the early 1960s, only 16% of pregnant workers received
maternity leave with an assurance their jobs would be held
for them. Twenty years later, 47% of pregnant workers
received maternity benefits. More than 60% of women quit
their jobs at some point during pregnancy or shortly after
birth in the early 1960s, a percentage that fell to 28% in
the early 1980s.</p>
<p>Besides compiling information on changing maternity-leave
benefits and their impact on women's participation in the
work force, the wide-ranging Census report reaffirms that
women are marrying and beginning childbearing later.</p>
<p>Mr. O'Connell surveyed data on women whose first children
were born between January 1961 and December 1985. He found
that 65% of women worked during pregnancy in the early 1980s,
up from 44% in the early 1960s. Of those pregnant workers,
78% stayed on the job into their last trimester, compared
with 52% during the earlier period.</p>
<p>"Even more remarkable in the last 25 years has been the
change in the role women play as family providers within the
first year of their child's life," Mr. O'Connell said. In the
early 1960s, one of every six women went back to work before
her child's first birthday; now one-half of women with
newborns return to work within a year of childbirth.</p>
<p>The women most likely to work during their first pregnancy
are relatively older, white and have at least a high-school
education. Teen-agers, blacks and high-school dropouts are
the least likely to be employed during pregnancy or at other
times. And because of financial reasons, those teenagers,
blacks and high-school dropouts who did work during pregnancy
were the most likely to return to work within six months of
childbirth.</p>
<p>But the report adds that overall, "regardless of economic
need, returning to work rapidly after childbirth is becoming
the norm among all social groups."</p>
<p>The report says maternity-leave policies can benefit
employers by reducing potential costs associated with finding
replacement workers. It suggests that employers who offer
maternity benefits with the promise of job retention may
encourage more women to work longer into their pregnancy and
return to work more swiftly. But it warns that such
inducements might not work for employees in clerical and
other jobs that foster little long-term job commitment.</p>
<p>The report comes as the U.S. House of Representatives is
preparing to vote on legislation that would require employers
of 50 or more workers to give them unpaid time off to care
for newborn or adopted babies; or for the serious illness of
a child, spouse or parent, or for personal-health problems.
The bill is opposed by the White House and business groups
because it mandates the provision of benefits.</p>
