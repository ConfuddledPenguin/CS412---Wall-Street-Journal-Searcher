	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A former midlevel Grumman Corp. official
pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the government and to
another charge stemming from the nationwide investigation of
Pentagon procurement fraud.
   In federal court in Brooklyn, N.Y., William Capaldo
admitted that the scheme involved passing on to the federal
government sham bills for $300,000 of packaging materials.
The government ultimately covered the amounts in the phony
bills, which were submitted to Grumman by a Long Island,
N.Y., paper company between 1982 and 1987, according to the
government.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Court documents indicate that the Grumman supplier, headed
by James Kane, who has since died, paid Mr. Capaldo $75,000
for certifying that the bills were legitimate. Mr. Capaldo
also admitted that he failed to report the money in his
federal income tax returns. Grumman has said it isn't a
target of a continuing grand jury investigation in Brooklyn.</p>
<p>The guilty plea is an offshoot of earlier grand jury
investigations of Grumman's business dealings with Mr. Kane
and a Long Island-based political action committee he headed.</p>
<p>A 1988 search warrant for another of Mr. Kane's companies
indicated that prosecutors were investigating whether he gave
stock or other "things of value" to public officials. In
addition, prosecutors have delved into Mr. Kane's contacts
with former consultants and officials of Unisys Corp. and
other defense contractors implicated in the procurement
scandal.</p>
<p>Andrew Maloney, the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, said there
would be "some future activity coming out of this office"
following yesterday's guilty plea. He declined to comment on
whether this activity would involve Grumman employees or the
company itself.</p>
