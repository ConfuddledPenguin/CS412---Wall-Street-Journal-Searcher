	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Investment in plant and equipment by Japanese
corporations will increase 6.7% in fiscal 1990, which began
in April, from the previous fiscal year because of healthy
economic growth led by domestic demand, according to a survey
by the Economic Planning Agency.
   The survey of 4,207 companies conducted March 1 also
showed that Japan's corporate executives are becoming
increasingly cautious about the future of their business.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>On equipment investment, the survey said manufacturers
plan to spend 10.7% more than they did in the previous fiscal
year, while non-manufacturers show 4.1% growth.</p>
