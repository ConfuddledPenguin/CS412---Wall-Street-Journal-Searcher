	<p class="article-leader">Ignoring the strike by bus drivers, Greyhound is rolling
out a new radio campaign that it hopes will win back riders
with feel-good messages about riding across the U.S. on a
bus.
   "Oh beautiful for spacious skies . . . the road leads ever
onward and it's calling out to me," a blues singer belts in
one ad for the campaign, which was created by Bozell's Dallas
office. The ads, which begin this week, feature a new
Greyhound slogan: "Take a window seat on America, take a
Greyhound cruise."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Oddly -- to some people at least -- the ads make nary a
mention of the 10-week-old strike that has already resulted
in one death and several injuries. "This could very well
backfire," says Jeffrey B. Hirsch, president of Hirsch
Marketing, a Venice, Calif., consulting concern. "People
might think it's a joke to hear some cheerful song about
riding along merrily on a Greyhound bus. They know in reality
these buses are getting shot at."</p>
<p>Greyhound executives say they decided to ignore the strike
in the campaign in large part because they didn't want to get
stuck with an expensive campaign that they couldn't use if a
settlement suddenly was reached. "We wanted something that we
can run over a long period of time," says Ralph Borland,
Greyhound's vice president of marketing.</p>
<p>Still, the campaign is a major departure for Greyhound,
whose most recent ad efforts featured the tag line "Catch a
Money Saver on Greyhound" and pitched almost exclusively its
low fares. The new effort, Mr. Borland says, seeks to
leverage some "long-term good will" that consumers have for
Greyhound.</p>
<p>"We need to rebuild a positive image" by reminding folks
that we're the ones that drove Americans to war, took the
country to the World's Fair and brought Tom Cruise to New
York in the movie "Cocktail," he says. "Although Greyhound
awareness is very high, I'd be the first to admit that it
isn't all positive," Mr. Borland says.</p>
<p>Mr. Hirsch says, however, that Greyhound can only rebuild
its image by acting to reassure its potential riders that the
problem has been dealt with, and that the company can be
counted on to deliver a safe ride. "A business-as-usual
message is a mistake, because it's not business as usual," he
says.</p>
<p>But Jane Fitzgibbon, the senior vice president who heads
up Ogilvy & Mather's TrendSights division, says Greyhound is
taking the right road. "This thing has been going on for a
long time. . . . I'm wondering if the strike is still
top-of-mind for people" whom Greyhound is trying to reach,
she says. Ms. Fitzgibbon says to bring it up again in ads
would be stirring up bad images.</p>
<p>In fact, at a news conference earlier this week, Greyhound
effectively declared the strike over. The company said it has
hired enough of its own drivers to keep the highways full and
contends calls from prospective passengers are pouring in.</p>
<p>Greyhound's Mr. Borland says it did run out a quick
campaign at Easter that offered riders free tickets if their
bus didn't arrive on schedule. But it opted to launch the
major campaign, on which it will spend about $11 million,
without bringing up the strike.</p>
<p>The new radio campaign includes ads that have been done in
a number of musical styles, such as blues, gospel and soft
rock. The blues and gospel versions are largely intended to
reach the black market, which Mr. Borland says makes up a
large share of Greyhound's riders.</p>
<p>Greyhound, a unit of GLI Holding Co., is trying to
minimize the damage done to its ridership ranks by recruiting
new riders. Mr. Borland says that with the new campaign,
Greyhound is broadening its target audience to include people
aged 18 to 55. Its previous target was 18 to 34. Toward that
end, Greyhound says it plans to advertise on a number of CBS
News programs, including some news shorts hosted by CBS
personality Charles Kuralt, a favorite of older listeners.</p>
