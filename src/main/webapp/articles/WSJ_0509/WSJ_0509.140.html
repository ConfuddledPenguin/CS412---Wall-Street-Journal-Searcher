pretax profit in the first three months soared 94% to 1.18
billion kronor ($195 million) from 609 million kronor ($100.8
million) in the corresponding period a year earlier.
   Ericsson said consolidated sales increased 30% to 10.41
billion kronor from 7.99 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ericsson's interim report exceeded market expectations and
the pretax profit was almost 280 million kronor above the
average prediction of analysts.</p>
<p>The group said income per share after taxes and full
conversion leaped 88% to 17.25 kronor from 9.19 in the first
threemonth period last year.</p>
<p>Ericsson said the improvement was attributable mainly to
the public telecommunications and radio communications
business areas, both of which posted a strong increase in
volume and favorable margin development.</p>
