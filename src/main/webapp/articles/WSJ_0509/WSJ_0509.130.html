	<p class="article-leader">Stryker Corp expects net income in 1990 to meet analysts'
predictions of $23.4 million, or $1 a share, Chairman and
President John W. Brown said.
   Mr. Brown predicted the company's earnings and sales both
will grow by at least 20% this year, consistent with the
annual increases posted by the health-products company since
it went public in 1979.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In 1989, Kalamazoo, Mich.-based Stryker earned $19.2
million, or 82 cents a share, on sales of $225.9 million. For
the first quarter of 1990, it had a net income of $6.3
million, up nearly 25% from the year-earlier period.</p>
<p>Mr. Brown said his company will face a challenge
sustaining its 20% growth rate throughout the 1990s. The
tremendous increase in U.S. health-care costs will bring a
"backlash" if it continues, he said.</p>
<p>Stryker has achieved its growth rate by bringing out a
series of well-received products, such as hip implants and
surgical tools. Mr. Brown said the company will introduce a
new "stream of products" -- mainly variations of existing
products -- during the next two to three years.</p>
<p>Stryker doesn't pay a dividend and doesn't intend to start
paying one, Mr. Brown said. "Our argument is if you let us
reinvest the money, we'll give you a better return," he
explained.</p>
