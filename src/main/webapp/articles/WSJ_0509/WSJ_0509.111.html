	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Suppose the local hardware store suddenly
decided to open a women's fashion department. Next to the
usual screws, socket wrenches and bug spray, there would be a
festoon of lace dresses and floral print blouses. Shoppers
could pick out a new chain saw -- or a silky camisole.
   A dubious plan? Then consider the plight of giant Sears,
Roebuck & Co. Sears became the nation's largest retailer by
making household names of hard goods like Craftsman tools,
Kenmore appliances, Weatherbeater paint and DieHard
batteries. Even today, its executives like nothing better
than discussing the features of a new weed-whacker or table
saw.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But that preoccupation with hard goods has also hurt the
retailer. Sears's merchandise operations have steadily lost
market share throughout the 1980s. Last year, its U.S. stores
and catalogs contributed just 16.6% of total profit from the
company's operating groups. Five years ago, the figure was
41%. The company's financial services -- its Allstate, Dean
Witter and Coldwell Banker units -- have had to pick up the
slack.</p>
<p>Sears has frantically tried to restore its U.S. stores to
prominence. It has switched to a radical "everyday low
pricing" strategy, added national brands like Panasonic and
Whirlpool, and revamped displays with what it calls "power
formats." Yet in this year's first three months, U.S. retail
operations recorded a net loss of $134.2 million -- one of
its worst quarters in years and a performance that Chairman
Edward Brennan, not surprisingly, declared "unsatisfactory."</p>
<p>The latest hope for a rescue lies in the most unlikely
place: the fashion business. The reason is the evolution of
the shopping mall, where more than two-thirds of Sears's 850
stores are located. Today, most shoppers at these retail
mini-cities are on a mission to do one thing: buy clothes.
Apparel now accounts for more than 70% of non-food sales in
malls and women today stock more than three-quarters of their
wardrobes with clothes bought in malls.</p>
<p>Sears can hardly pick up and move more than 600 stores, so
its only hope is to join the trend to soft goods. "It's going
to be enormously hard . . . but Sears has to figure out how
to get women to come in the store," says George Rosenbaum,
president of Leo J. Shapiro & Associates, a market research
firm. (Sears also sells men's and children's clothing, but
its biggest problem area is women's apparel.)</p>
<p>Mr. Rosenbaum adds that, unless Sears can draw more women
into its stores, its prospects for growth will stay dim. Says
Michael Bozic, chairman of the Sears merchandise group: "The
women's business is very important to any merchant located in
America's malls. We have to behave more as our competitors
behave."</p>
<p>Yet at hardware-oriented Sears, few things could be more
difficult. Sears has sold women's apparel from its early days
as a catalog operation. A company history by former employee
Lorin Sorensen says executives insisted that, at the
company's first store, "monkey wrenches, paint, hardware and
tires be amply displayed along with the women's soft goods,
making shopping a family affair."</p>
<p>Fashion has always taken a back seat. Executives like to
refer to clothing as "wearing apparel" and often have
promoted items the way they might a new tire. "Rainspots
won't show on these ALLWEATHER pure silk stockings," boasted
one Sears ad in the 1930s. The closest Sears came to getting
trendy was creating celebrity clothing lines. There were
Clara Bow tams, Ginger Rogers dresses and Joan Crawford
cloche hats.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the Sears women's department was traditionally
the bag lady of retailing. In most stores, the area was
shabby and cluttered, with too few mirrors and fitting rooms.
Skirts, blouses and jackets were jumbled onto cheap racks,
and sold primarily on the basis of price. Signs trumpeted
$19.99 outfits and two-for-one bra sales. The Craftsman
mentality even extended to something called the Zip & Dash
housedress. Made of shapeless polyester, Sears promoted it as
one of its top offerings because it was durable and didn't
need ironing. The Zip & Dash is still for sale, though it has
been banished to a remote corner of the department.</p>
<p>The upshot: Store sales of women's clothing never soared
and today account for less than 10% of the Sears's
merchandise group's $31.6 billion in annual revenue, even
though the women's department takes up a far greater
percentage of selling space in the store. Moreover, while the
typical Sears store still attracts a broad spectrum of
customers, the demographics of shoppers in its women's
department is limited: females over 40 with household incomes
of less than $30,000, according to Sears's own research.</p>
<p>Remarkably, the post of women's fashion director remained
vacant for nine years. In March 1989, following a year-long
search, Sears finally filled the position: It recruited Lee
Hogan Cass, who held a similar job at the Broadway
department-store chain in Southern California. Ms. Cass won't
give her age, but records show she is 69 years old. Sears
"should be the best moderate department store in America,"
says the elegantly dressed department-store veteran. "I don't
think we are now."</p>
<p>Ms. Cass, whose own wardrobe is stocked with Giorgio
Armani and Chanel, hopes to create an atmosphere at Sears
that might even tempt her to shop there. Last year, she told
one of the store's scarf buyers that he had just presented
her with the "ugliest merchandise I've ever seen." Now, she's
trying to woo new labels like swimwear-makers Jantzen and
Catalina. She is also experimenting with trendier colors and
styles, including black-and-white Op Art prints that she
predicts will be big in the spring of 1991.</p>
<p>This month, Sears will kick off its first-ever television
and print advertising campaign for women's apparel. In
devising a theme for the ads, Sears decided not to pretend
that customers don't know about its weakness in apparel. The
slogan of the $25 million image campaign: "You gotta be
puttin' me on."</p>
<p>Sears also knows it is getting a very late start. Big
rivals like J.C. Penney Co. already are well along with their
own fashion overhauls. Sensing the trend in shopping malls
almost a decade ago, Penney dumped most of its hard goods
entirely and made itself over to look like a department store
-- a strategy that made it one of the hottest companies in
retailing.</p>
<p>Sears doesn't need to go that far -- and doesn't intend
to. With Penney's exit from hard goods, Sears enjoys the
advantage of being the lone supplier of that sort of
merchandise at many shopping centers.</p>
<p>So far, one of Sears's biggest problems has been
convincing major apparel houses that it is now truly serious
about clothes. Shortly after moving to Chicago, Ms. Cass
called long-time friend Bernard Chaus, hoping to add his
large and influential apparel company to Sears's roster of
suppliers. He turned her down, flat. Mr. Chaus, whose clothes
range up to $200 in price and are widely sold in department
stores, says: "I think of us as being upper-moderate. That
range is too high for the kind of mix and environment at
Sears."</p>
<p>At Sears, buyers traditionally have chosen apparel colors
the way customers buy the company's paint -- from something
called a "color card." Divided into palettes, such as pastels
and brights, the color-card approach often led to a
mind-numbing number of hues on the sales floor. In contrast,
department stores try to emphasize dominant color trends in
fashion and coordinate what they hang on their racks.</p>
<p>Ms. Cass scrapped the cards and dictated eight distinct
color themes for 1990. This year, they are moving from what
Ms. Cass calls Neutrals Ninety into motifs with names like
Breakaway Brights and Indian Summer. These messages will be
reinforced in the stores with theme posters and special
display props. Sears is even sending its stores detailed
directions on how to dress mannequins to pose near the
posters.</p>
<p>Sears also needs to improve its ability to pounce on
trends. In the past, it often stuck with the same merchandise
for what seemed an eternity. The company's major fashion
initiative in the 1980s picked up on an earlier theme:
attaching celebrity names to its clothes. In 1980, Sears got
Cheryl Tiegs to put her name on a new line of the company's
low-priced sportswear, which became a big hit. But the
clothes soon started to look alike year after year, and the
quality slipped. Sears waited nine years before dropping the
line.</p>
<p>Now, Ms. Cass tries to spot fashion trends by huddling
with consultants and picking ideas from what she sees in
fashion shows, in shops and on the streets of London, Paris
and Barcelona. A wrapped skirt she bought in Europe last
fall, for example, was the inspiration for an item that will
show up in Sears stores later this year.</p>
<p>Sears, in fact, has been completely overhauling its buying
approach, including recruiting several buyers and managers
from department and specialty stores. Whereas its buyers once
met with manufacturers in the company's Chicago tower, they
now travel to manufacturers' showrooms in New York and Los
Angeles.</p>
<p>Sears also has dropped much of its cheapest and ugliest
merchandise, including sportswear that accounted for $100
million in annual sales. Out went items like $6.99 pull-on
pants made from spongy polyester, and the matching floral
blouses. In their place, Sears has been adding more outfits
fit for wearing to work.</p>
<p>It is also adding respected national labels such as
Villager, which is owned by Russ Togs Inc. Cathy Hardwick, a
designer of contemporary sportswear, also recently agreed to
develop a Sears line. Her garments, which used to sell at
tony stores like Bloomingdale's and Neiman Marcus for around
$200 each, will range in price from $28 to $48 at Sears and
will begin appearing in August.</p>
<p>Still, Sears's reputation continues to make wooing
important labels difficult. Before Leslie Fay Cos. agreed to
supply its Personal sportswear line exclusively to Sears, the
retailer had to prove that it wouldn't do its usual shoddy
job with display. Sears set up a prototype shop, complete
with the logo of the Personal sportswear line printed on an
eye-catching gray arch.</p>
<p>Many Sears customers also are still waiting for evidence
of change. Few stores in the chain look as inviting as its
store in Aurora, Ill., which was the first to get the full
facelift that Sears calls its women's "power format." The
Aurora store has spacious and brightly lit floors, cozier
fitting rooms and more-dramatic displays, including the gray
Personal arch in the women's career clothing area.</p>
<p>Sears is also now doing all-apparel advertising pamphlets
that feature pictures of models in more active poses than
those used before. One shows a svelte blond underwear model
in a lacy string bikini and bra. This was such a departure
for Sears that it shocked some company veterans, who
expressed reservations about running a women's underwear ad
that might be "too forward" for Sears. But the proponents of
the photo prevailed.</p>
<p>Few people at Sears, however, have any illusions about how
far the big retailer still has to go. Its store in Niles,
Ill., though far from the worst example, is an illustration.
Mixed in with the Stefanie Powers collection and Goolagong
sportswear are some of the newer Sears labels, such as
Personal and Middlebrook Park. But the racks are still
plastered with garish red signs announcing prices "As
Advertised." None of the customers in the aisles appear
younger than 50 and, inexplicably, there is a mound of
Rubbermaid picnic coolers for sale in the middle of the
department.</p>
<p>A lot more work lies ahead, acknowledges Ms. Cass.
"There's only one way to go," she says, "which is up."</p>
