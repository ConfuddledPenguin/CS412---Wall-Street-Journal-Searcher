	<p class="article-leader">Italian car group Fiat S.p.A reported a 9.3% rise in 1989
consolidated profit before minority interests on a 17% sales
increase. The concern described the performance as "the best
in the group's history."
   The results were achieved amid strong demand both in the
Italian and European car markets last year, which, however,
is now showing signs of weakening.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Fiat's consolidated profit before minority interests rose
to 3.31 trillion lire ($2.73 billion) in 1989 from 3.03
trillion lire ($2.5 billion) the previous year. Total
consolidated net profit climbed 13% to 3.66 trillion lire
from 3.24 trillion lire, while consolidated net sales soared
to 52.02 trillion lire from 44.31 trillion lire.</p>
<p>The Milan-based company announced a 50 lire increase in
the per-share dividend to 370 lire for common and preferred
shares and 400 lire for savings shares, a payment analysts
described as high.</p>
