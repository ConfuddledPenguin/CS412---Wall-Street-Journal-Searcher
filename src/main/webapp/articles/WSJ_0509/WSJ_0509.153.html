	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A cold flap of reality hit the art market at
Sotheby's Holdings Inc.
   At the auction house's sale here of contemporary art last
night, art collectors went bargain-hunting with avid bidding
for "mid-price" six-figure artworks. But there was little
interest in the low-end and high-end paintings and
sculptures.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a packed sales room that grew increasingly uneasy,
again and again bidders rejected even household-name
contemporary artists like Jackson Pollack and Roy
Lichtenstein as too expensive.</p>
<p>Of the 87 artworks up for bid, 37% didn't sell. Overall,
the total for the sale reached $55.9 million, very much below
the $88.1 million to $114.8 million range predicted by the
auction house. In contrast, Sotheby's last major contemporary
art sale in November raised $98.3 million for 68 paintings
and sculptures.</p>
<p>Morever, many pieces last night sold at prices below the
lowest published Sotheby's estimate. That indicates that the
secret minimum price the sellers would accept might have been
slashed since the pieces were originally scheduled for
auction a few months ago -- in general, the sign of a
softening market.</p>
<p>Lucy Mitchell-Innes, head of Sotheby's contemporary art
department, said the market was still "strong" and
"confident," but "expectations among collectors have gotten a
bit ahead of themselves."</p>
<p>Sotheby's sale was less successful, however, than the
contemporary art sale Monday night held by its rival
Christie's International PLC in New York. At that sale,
one-third of the artworks didn't sell, but several of the
most expensive ones found buyers.</p>
<p>At Sotheby's, Willem de Kooning's "Woman as Landscape," a
huge riot of red and black once exhibited in the Museum of
Modern Art, failed to sell. It was estimated to sell for $9
million to $12 million. Bidding ended at $4.8 million.</p>
<p>However, Mr. de Kooning's "Palisade" fetched the highest
price of the evening at $7.2 million. Richard Gray, a Chicago
art dealer, purchased the piece, which was estimated to sell
for $8 million to $10 million.</p>
<p>Francis Bacon's dark, contorted oil painting of a pope,
"Study for Portrait," was sold for $5.5 million to an unnamed
European art dealer. The pre-sale estimate range was $5
million to $7 million.</p>
<p>One of the surprises of the sale was Andy Warhol's "12
Jackies," a haunting black and white silkscreen featuring
repeated images of the former first lady, shown in mourning
for President Kennedy. Estimated to bring $2 million to $2.5
million, it also didn't sell.</p>
<p>The major auctions of the spring season, the evening sales
of impresssionist and modern paintings, will be held at
Christie's and at Sotheby's Tuesday and Thursday of next
week, respectively.</p>
