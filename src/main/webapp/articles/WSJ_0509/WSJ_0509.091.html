	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission filed
insider-trading charges against B. Francis Saul III, the son
of the chairman of B.F. Saul Real Estate Investment Trust, in
connection with the trust's 1988 acquisition by Westminster
Investing Corp.
   In a complaint filed in federal court in Chicago, the SEC
also named Peter D. Garvy, a former roommate of Mr. Saul's,
as a defendant. Mr. Garvy was accused of trading on inside
information concerning Westminster's plans to make a tender
offer for B.F. Saul common stock.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The 28-year-old Mr. Saul of Chicago was charged with
obtaining the confidential information from his father, B.
Francis Saul II, while the two companies were in
negotiations, and then passing it onto Mr. Garvy, a
28-year-old Chicagoan.</p>
<p>Between June 3 and June 21, 1988, Mr. Garvy bought 5,500
B.F. Saul common shares for $16.75 to $21.50 a share, the
agency said. On June 22, Westminster announced its offer to
acquire the B.F. Saul trust at $25 a share. Mr. Garvy later
sold the 5,500 shares for a profit of about $38,438, the SEC
said.</p>
<p>Mr Saul's father is chairman of Westminster, based in
Chevy Chase, Md., as well as B.F. Saul.</p>
<p>The agency asked the court to enjoin the defendants from
violating the securities laws. It also sought forfeiture of
Mr. Garvy's alleged profits as well as civil penalties.</p>
<p>Mr. Saul, his father and Mr. Garvy couldn't be reached for
comment.</p>
