	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Counsellors Tandem Securities Fund Inc. set
the price for its self-tender offer at $10.85 a share, or 95%
of the net asset value of its common at the close of business
Monday.
   The closed-end equity mutual fund is seeking as many as
two million of its 4.9 million common shares outstanding, and
as many as 303,030 of its preferred shares at $49.50 each,
plus an amount equal to accrued dividends. The preferred has
a liquidation value of $50 a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The tender offer, which Counsellors Tandem's board
unanimously recommended shareholders reject, is being made as
part of an agreement with a large investor, Sequoia Partners
L.P. With other investors, Sequoia holds about 1.2 million,
or almost 26% of the fund's shares. Sequoia had been pressing
for measures to boost the fund's price, and had considered
replacing the fund's board.</p>
<p>If more than 2.5 million common shares are tendered,
Tandem agreed to terminate the offer and hold a special
meeting to consider a binding proposal to liquidate. Tandem
will be required to support such a proposal under its
agreement with Sequoia. The self-tender offer began April 13.
An official of Tandem said it would be "inappropriate" to
disclose how many shares have been tendered so far.</p>
<p>The offer expires at midnight tomorrow. Tandem doesn't
intend to extend the offer, but retains the right to do so at
a price equal to 95% of the net asset value at the close of
business three days before the then-scheduled expiration
date.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Counsellors Tandem shares closed at $10.25, unchanged.</p>
