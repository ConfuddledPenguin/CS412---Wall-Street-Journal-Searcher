	<p class="article-leader">BUTTE, Montana -- Montana Power Co. said it amended its
articles of incorporation to double the number of shares of
common stock authorized to 120 million.
   The company said the change reflects a 2-for-1 stock split
that took effect Feb. 1, and the possible need for additional
common shares should rights become exercisable under a
shareholder protection rights plan established in June 1989.</p>
