	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Just hours after Greyhound Lines Inc. declared a
strike by the Amalgamated Transit Union irrelevant, company
Chairman Fred Currey met secretly with union leaders in his
Dallas office.
   The hour-and-a-half bargaining session, held at the
request of ATU officials, marked Mr. Currey's first direct
involvement in negotiations since the start of the
often-violent strike on March 2, by 9,400 employees of
Greyhound, a unit of GLI Holding Co. But the meeting
apparently drove the two sides farther apart and may have
marked an end to bargaining for the forseeable future.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We left it that we are not going to get back together,"
said P. Anthony Lannie, Greyhound executive vice president
and chief labor negotiator. "There are no future meetings and
there are no plans for any future meetings. Our position is
that until they are willing to talk about what the company
can afford, bargaining is fruitless."</p>
<p>In a news conference Monday, Mr. Currey said he had
effectively defeated the ATU strike because as a result of
strike defections and newly hired replacement drivers, he had
nearly enough employees to operate the Greyhound system.</p>
<p>In addition to Mr. Currey, Mr. Lannie and a federal
mediator, also present were ATU vice president James Hayes
and Edward Strait, president of the Amalgamated Council of
Greyhound Local Unions, the ATU's bargaining unit.</p>
<p>Mr. Strait, who flew to Dallas from Washington, D.C., said
he requested the meeting with Mr. Currey because he didn't
want to "leave any stone unturned."</p>
<p>According to participants in Monday's session, neither
side made any new economic proposals or offered substantial
modifications from previously announced positions.</p>
<p>Last weekend, after announcing $55.8 million in
strike-related losses in the first quarter, the company
sharply reduced its original contract offer and proposed a
six-year pact with a four-year pay freeze.</p>
<p>Union officials have called the company's offer an
"insult" and say they are standing by their previous demand
for a contract that would raise drivers' base pay 20% over
three years. Company officials complain that the union
proposal would cost the company more than $140 million and is
unrealistic in light of the bus company's deteriorated
financial picture.</p>
<p>"They don't care what we can afford," said Mr. Lannie.
"They want what they want."</p>
<p>Mr. Strait said that in Monday's meeting, company
officials refused to discuss the idea of laying off the
replacement drivers or reducing their seniority so that
strikers could go back to work.</p>
