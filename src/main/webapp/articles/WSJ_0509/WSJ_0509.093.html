	<p class="article-leader">In your April 3 page-one article "Price of Progress" you
implied that the problems of Columbus Junction, Iowa, are due
to Mexicans, Hispanic-Americans and inner-city blacks from
Michigan.
   You easily could have omitted the reference to national
origin and race. The misconception most Americans have is
that rising crime rates are inherently related to race -- but
only those races of people with darker skin color than white.
In fact, the fundamental reason for rising crime is poverty
and a lack of education. In Columbus Junction's situation,
when you combine this with a growing population, residents
resistant to change, differing cultures (moving from one part
of the U.S. to another can be a culture shock), the social
equation can be horrendous. Unless properly planned for in
advance, yes, the end result is crime, high-school dropouts,
etc.</p>

often misuse race and national origin, the better off we will
be as a nation.</p>
