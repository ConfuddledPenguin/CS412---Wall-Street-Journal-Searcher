	<p class="article-leader">The successful sale of $10.5 billion in three-year
Treasury notes touched off a last-minute rally that helped
stock prices rack up a seventh consecutive gain.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 11.94 to 2733.56 in
light trading. The gains came in a last-minute flurry of
activity after news that the Treasury auction went better
than some analysts had expected. The dollar was mixed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Nervousness about the auction kept stock prices confined
to a narrow range in sluggish trading through much of the
day. But investors had been encouraged by one sign that
interest rates may have peaked: steadily declining estimates
over the past week of the yield that would attract investors
to the Treasury's $30.5 billion of notes and bonds during the
three-day auction. The average yield on the $10.5 billion of
three-year notes sold yesterday was 8.74%, at the low end of
most estimates.</p>
<p>Despite the relative success of yesterday's auction, stock
investors remain wary about the outcome of the remaining
sales. The Treasury will auction $10 billion in 10-year notes
today and $10 billion of 30-year bonds tomorrow. The bond
sale has the most potential to disrupt financial markets as
it is regarded as the best barometer of inflation
expectations.</p>
