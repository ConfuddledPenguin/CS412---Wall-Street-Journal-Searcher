	<p class="article-leader">MICHAEL R. GOLAND, a businessman and donor to pro-Israel
political causes, didn't produce telephone logs showing he
was in almost daily contact with the American Israel Public
Affairs Committee during the 1986 Cranston-Zschau Senate race
in California, as stated in Monday's edition, although the
logs reflect at least four such telephone contacts. Last
week, a federal district court jury in Los Angeles, while
convicting him on one count of an election-law violation,
also acquitted him on four counts and was deadlocked on a
fifth. Monday's edition failed specifically to mention the
acquittals.
