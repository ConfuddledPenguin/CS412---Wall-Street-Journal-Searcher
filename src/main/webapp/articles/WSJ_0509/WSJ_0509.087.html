	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Unable to attract the price she wanted, Ann
Getty said she has decided to take her publishing company,
Grove Weidenfeld, off the block and continue running it as an
independent company.
   Mrs. Getty, wife of oil millionaire Gordon Getty, is
president and owner of the highbrow publishing company, which
has been for sale since February. Patrick Peyton, a financial
adviser to the Getty family, said that insufficient money
wasn't the only reason for ending the sale.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Peyton, who will serve as interim president of the
publisher until a new chief executive officer can be hired,
said that Mrs. Getty also couldn't get potential buyers to
promise to keep the Grove Weidenfeld staff intact and
maintain the Grove "imprint" on books in the future.</p>
<p>Most of the major publishing houses in the U.S. and a
number of foreign-owned companies took a look at Grove
Weidenfeld, and at first, it was expected to fetch as much as
$15 million. As the number of bidders narrowed to three in
recent weeks, reports circulated that potential bidders were
dismayed at the company's expensive contracts with authors
working on future books, and the potential problems of
transferring some old contracts to a new owner.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Penguin USA, a unit of London-based
Pearson PLC, confirmed that Penguin was the final bidder
until talks broke down this week. Penguin is believed to have
bid somewhere between $7 million and $9 million. The chief
executive of another publishing house that examined Grove
Weidenfeld's books said he would have only been willing to
bid "about $5 million or $6 million."</p>
<p>Grove Weidenfeld is a literary publisher that includes the
40-year-old Grove Press, publisher of Henry Miller, Samuel
Beckett and others, and a newer house formed in 1985 by Mrs.
Getty and British publisher Lord Weidenfeld. Although it has
had losses in the past, Mr. Peyton said Grove Weidenfeld is
making money so far this year and will publish about 70
titles in 1990, down from 140 in 1989.</p>
<p>"We believe we have a certain niche in the marketplace to
publish small, literary books," said Mr. Peyton. "We won't go
after the mega-deals and compete with the big boys like we
did before."</p>
