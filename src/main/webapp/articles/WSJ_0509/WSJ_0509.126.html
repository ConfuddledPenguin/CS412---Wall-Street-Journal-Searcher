	<p class="article-leader">General Electric Co. received an order from a federal
judge temporarily blocking a Daimler-Benz AG subsidiary from
entering a series of commercial jet-engine programs with
United Technologies Corp.
   Last month, GE filed a lawsuit asking $1.15 billion of
damages, charging the West German industrial group with
breaking an agreement it has with GE to develop high-thrust
jet engines. GE charged that proprietary data that it shares
with Daimler will find its way to GE's competitor, United
Technologies, which owns the jet-engine maker Pratt &
Whitney.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In Manhattan, U.S. District Judge Robert P. Patterson Jr.
scheduled a hearing for May 22. GE has requested an order
blocking Daimler and its Motoren-und Turbinen-Union unit from
entering into agreements with GE competitors on the engines
or from disclosing any GE data on the engines until the case
can be tried.</p>
<p>GE, Fairfield, Conn., also has interests in financial
services and broadcasting. United Technologies, Hartford, has
diverse industrial and defense interests.</p>
<p>Lewis A. Kaplan, an attorney in New York for the Daimler
subsidiary, said the unit "believes that the GE claim is
without merit and expects to prevail."</p>
