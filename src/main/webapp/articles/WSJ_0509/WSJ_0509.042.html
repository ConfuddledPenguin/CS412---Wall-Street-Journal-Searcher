	<p class="article-leader">More S&Ls Are Forced To
   Sell Their Own Land</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>REASSURED by the thrift rescue bill, savings and loans are
selling off their own real estate holdings in what one
executive called a "fire sale" environment.</p>
<p>The bill forces S&Ls to set aside increasing amounts of
capital over five years through 1994, so they can protect
themselves from losses on their own property development. By
1994, capital will have to equal 100% of assets.</p>
<p>But many thrifts complain that the capital requirement
makes it prohibitive for them to directly own real estate,
and as a result, many healthy S&Ls involved in development
are selling their holdings now in the first full year of the
bill. The sale of S&L-owned real estate even by healthy
thrifts is a new twist in the thrift dilemma. Previous sales
by S&Ls have involved mostly properties taken back through
foreclosure.</p>
<p>Landmark Land Co., a Carmel, Calif., development firm,
said the bill forced it to put up for sale $967 million of
its golf course developments and other real estate owned by
its Oak Tree Savings Bank unit. CrossLand Savings, New York,
said it is exploring the divestiture of its interests in
joint-venture projects. And earlier this year, Great American
Bank, a San Diego S&L, put its entire, profitable real estate
development unit on the block.</p>
<p>"The legislation makes you dispose of property sooner than
later," says Jere A. Young, president and chief executive of
Hansen Bancorp, a Harsham, Pa., thrift owned by Hansen Group,
a real estate concern.</p>
<p>"What it does is put a fire sale sign around your neck,"
says Gerald Barton, Landmark's president. Mr. Barton is
certain that Landmark would get a higher price for the
property if it could keep the real estate a little longer. As
it is, the company has to sell in a market flooded with
foreclosed property being sold by S&Ls and regulators.</p>
<p>Builders Lobby to Break</p>
<p>Choke Hold on Credit</p>
<p>HOMEBUILDERS, after a 3 1/2-month effort, successfully
lobbied to have federal legislation introduced that would
ease tightened lending limits imposed on S&Ls. But the bill
faces a tough sell.</p>
<p>The legislation, introduced by Rep. Peter Hoagland (D.,
Neb.), would ease thrift lending requirements that were
tightened under last year's S&L bailout bill. Thrifts were
forced to reduce credit to one borrower to an amount equal to
15% of their unimpaired capital, or capital minus intangible
assets like good will.</p>
<p>Facing tighter credit, builders are trimming production.
The National Association of Home Builders cut its 1990
housing starts projection to 1.35 million from 1.38 million
earlier this year, and says it may lower it again, to 1.30
million.</p>
<p>The Hoagland bill would phase in lending limits gradually,
starting at 60% in the first year of the law, 30% the second
and 15% the third. "This would soften the blow," says Floyd
Williams, the builder group's legislative counsel. But, he
adds, "we don't pretend {the bill's} going to be an easy
thing to get through."</p>
<p>Washington officials, who blame the S&L industry's losses
partly on excessive lending, have dragged their feet in
addressing the loan problem, believing that any allowances
for builders will only enrich already wealthy developers.</p>
<p>Trade, Social Scenarios</p>
<p>Deter Japanese Buyers</p>
<p>OVERBUILDING, trade friction and backlash from the
American public are helping to cool Japanese investment in
U.S. property.</p>
<p>The conclusions, in a study by Price Waterhouse Real
Estate Consulting Group, supported findings of another survey
by Kenneth Laventhol & Co., a Los Angeles-based accounting
firm. Last month, it reported Japanese purchases dropped 11%
last year to $14.8 billion from $16.5 billion.</p>
<p>The Price Waterhouse survey, based on 10 days of talks
with about 20 of Japan's largest bankers and real estate
investors, uncovered worries about overbuilding.</p>
<p>"They are definitely concerned about lower yields and
higher financing costs" because of oversupplies, says David
A. Eisner, managing partner of Price Waterhouse's real estate
group.</p>
<p>U.S. backlash has worried some Japanese even more. Last
year, some states considered legislation banning foreign
investment as Japanese started snapping up farm acreage and
beef and produce processing plants. The Japanese, Mr. Eisner
says, "are sensitive about the American public's view toward
them."

<p>Houston Finally Decides</p>
<p>To Zero In on Zoning</p>
<p>HOUSTON, the biggest experiment in unregulated
development, may put its houses in order.</p>
<p>The absence of a zoning code has created pockets of
pell-mell growth in the nation's fourth-largest city, with
auto-repair shops next to single-family homes, next to bars.
The issue was pushed to the forefront last year when Rosie
Walker, though unsuccessful in her mayoral bid, helped force
the city to appoint a committee to study zoning.</p>
<p>"The `Z' word is coming to Houston," said Zoning News, a
publication of the American Planning Association, a Chicago
trade group.</p>
<p>A recent survey by Rice University indicated that people
have had enough: 67% of those polled believe it's time the
city manage its growth better, up from 59% four years ago.</p>
<p>Why now? Some zoning proponents believe residents have
grown alarmed about how haphazard development affects
property values. Others, awaiting the city's rebound, want to
keep growth in check.</p>
