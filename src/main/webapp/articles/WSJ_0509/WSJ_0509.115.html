	<p class="article-leader">Gibson Greetings Inc. said the recent bankruptcy-law
reorganization filing of Ames Department Stores would lower
its second-quarter earnings due to an unspecified charge for
bad-debt provisions.
   Cincinnati-based Gibson said its Cleo Inc. greeting-card
subsidiary, which shipped merchandise to Ames last fall, was
a creditor in the Ames bankruptcy-law proceedings. The amount
of the charge has not yet been determined, Gibson said, due
to insufficient information concerning the financial status
of Ames.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Gibson noted, though, that the additional bad-debt
provision is expected to have a relatively minor impact on
its full-year results.</p>
<p>In the 1989 second quarter, Gibson had net income of $2.6
million, or 16 cents a share, on revenue of $66.1 million.
For all of 1989, earnings were $42.4 million, or $2.68 a
share, on revenue of $465.3 million.</p>
