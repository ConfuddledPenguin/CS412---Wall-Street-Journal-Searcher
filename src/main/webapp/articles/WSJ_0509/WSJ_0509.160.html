	<p class="article-leader">Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc.'s commodities trading
unit could be forced by creditors into bankruptcy court
alongside its parent as early as today.
   Some of the lawyers representing foreign central banks and
others owed a total of more than $500 million said they
expect a Chapter 7 involuntary bankruptcy filing to be made
against the unit, Drexel Burnham Lambert Trading Corp. The
unit "upstreamed" more than $600 million to its parent
company before the parent faced a liquidity crisis and filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy law protection on Feb. 13.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The trading unit's creditors include foreign central banks
as well as several international trading firms that made
precious metals, petroleum or foreign-exchange transactions
with the Drexel unit.</p>
<p>The biggest creditor appears to be Nissho Iwai Corp., a
Japanese concern, owed about $160 million. Portugal's central
bank is owed $95 million to $120 million, depending on the
market price calculation of gold it lent the unit.
Yugoslavia's central bank is owed about $70 million,
Malaysia's about $43 million, and Poland's $10 million, say
lawyers involved in the matter.</p>
<p>A Drexel spokesman said the trading unit, based in Fort
Lee, N.J., is no longer doing business and has been "winding
down" its positions since Feb. 13. He declined to comment on
relations with creditors. The unit's chief asset, he said, is
a $600 million or more claim against the parent company.</p>
<p>Richard F. Levy, a lawyer at the Chicago law firm of
Kirkland & Ellis who is representing the National Bank of
Yugoslavia, said the bankruptcy petition is signed by three
creditors and will be filed today. "We don't have confidence
that the current management of Drexel will prosecute this
{$600 million} claim" on the trading unit's behalf, he said.
Mr. Levy said his client asked the other creditors to sign
the bankruptcy petition. He refused to name the others who
signed, and wouldn't say why the Yugoslavian central bank is
apparently angrier than other creditors.</p>
<p>Drexel has said that it expects all creditors to be
repaid, though the spokesman wouldn't specifically say
whether the trading unit's creditors will be paid.</p>
<p>Creditors of the unit suspect that, as the Drexel parent's
access to commercial paper funding and other sources dried
up, it turned to the unit for cash. "Our general impression
is that they were helping to finance the parent," said Peter
Reed, a vice president of CRT Energy L.P. in Chicago, which
is owed about $1.9 million.</p>
<p>Drexel denies that. The spokesman said the trading unit
regularly provided cash to the parent, as needed, and that
such advances went up and down -- and that the $600 million
level reached before Feb. 13 was by no means the highest the
advances had ever been. "This was not operated as a vehicle
to raise money for the parent company," he said.</p>
