	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Very steep bond yields brought investors
flocking to the first of several bond issues for Denver's
disputed new airport.
   The city and county of Denver sold $700 million of airport
revenue bonds yesterday at yields ranging from 7.60% in 1995
to a steep 8.67% in 2023. The long-term yield is close to
that on long-term Treasury debt, and is nearly one percentage
point higher than yields on similar transportation bond
issues in the municipal market. Underwriters led by Goldman,
Sachs & Co. increased the size of the deal to $700 million
late in the afternoon from $600 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The issue has low investment-grade ratings of Baa-1 from
Moody's Investors Service Inc. and triple-B from Standard &
Poor's Corp. The Moody's rating is conditional on the airport
being built and generating revenue to cover debt service.</p>
<p>To build the airport, Denver needs to raise an estimated
$2 billion through bond sales and receive some $500 million
in federal aid. There isn't any guarantee from Denver on the
bonds. Investors can only look to future revenue from the
airport, which is to replace Stapleton airport. Opponents say
it isn't needed and will be too big and too costly.</p>
<p>In rating the bonds, Moody's and S&P cited a need for an
increase in passengers through Denver to meet the city's
financial projections.</p>
