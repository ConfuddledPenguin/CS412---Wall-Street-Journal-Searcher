	<p class="article-leader">General Motors Corp. said its Delco Products division will
export suspension struts from its Kettering, Ohio, factory to
a Toyota Motor Corp. car assembly plant in Japan.
   The agreement, which expands an existing relationship
between the two auto makers, comes at a time when Japanese
auto makers are under increasing pressure to buy more auto
parts from American companies. The value of the contract to
GM wasn't disclosed. Shipments are to begin later this year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the agreement, Toyota will buy up to 500,000 strut
assemblies a year from Delco Products and install them on
subcompact Corolla models built in Japan. The GM division
already supplies suspension parts and other components to New
United Motor Manufacturing, Inc., the GM-Toyota joint venture
car plant in Fremont, Calif., and to Toyota's Georgetown,
Ky., and Canadian car assembly plants. Delco Products also
exports windshield washer systems to Toyota in Japan.</p>
