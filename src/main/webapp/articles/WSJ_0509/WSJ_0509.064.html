	<p class="article-leader">MONTREAL -- The Canadian Paperworkers Union picked three
Quebec mills owned by Stone Container Corp. for contract
negotiations that will set the pattern for most of the
forest-products industry in Eastern Canada, which is a major
supplier of newsprint to U.S. publishers.
   The choice of Stone Container wasn't expected by many
industry observers, including Roger Stone, chairman,
president and chief executive officer of the Chicago paper
products concern.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We have somewhat of a reputation as a hard bargainer. I'm
surprised," Mr. Stone said.</p>
<p>The union represents about 30,000 workers at mills in
Eastern Canada, which is a producer of newsprint, pulp, and
other paper products. As a rule, the union negotiates a
contract with one company or group of mills and that
settlement is then adopted by the rest of the industry.</p>
<p>Analysts said the union may have picked Stone Container
because the union believes the company isn't prepared to
endure a strike. "If that's true they've misjudged the
situation," Mr. Stone said.</p>
<p>Don Holder, union president, said that "we believe we can
get a settlement without a strike." The union is seeking an
8% wage increase in each year of a two-year contract and an
automatic cost-of-living increase. But Mr. Holder conceded
that "it would be a little naive to expect to come out with
8%." The base wage rate at the Stone Container mills is
currently 15.37 Canadian dollars (US$13.22) an hour.
Contracts at most Eastern Canadian mills expired April 30.</p>
<p>The contract negotiations will be watched closely by
newsprint buyers. Most major newsprint producers have
announced a June 1 price increase of US$35 a metric ton to
US$685 a ton on the East Coast, and a similar increase in the
West, where the price scale is slightly different.
Transaction prices, the actual prices paid by buyers, are
much lower with 20% discounts widespread. Industry executives
said they expect that an increase in the list price would
lift transaction prices from about US$520 a ton to about
US$550.</p>
<p>Initially, many publishers didn't expect the price
increase to go through, but now opinion is mixed. An extended
strike at the three Stone mills, one of which produces
standard newsprint, could help producers push through the
price increase. The newsprint market is highly sensitive to
minor shifts in supply and demand.</p>
<p>"A strike is probably the only chance" for a price boost,
said J. William Cox, senior vice president at the Dallas
Morning News.</p>
<p>The increase is "a contrived non-market driven farce,"
said Homer Taylor, vice president of supply at Knight-Ridder
Inc. in Miami. While a strike could temporarily lift
newsprint prices, once production returned to normal, prices
would fall back to current levels, Mr. Taylor said.</p>
