	<p class="article-leader">A LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL on small S corporations has tax
lawyers in a stew.
   In recent years, hundreds of thousands of closely held
corporations have converted to S status for the benefits of
being taxed at the owners' level, much as partnerships are.
Conversion isn't taxable. But a staffer of Congress's joint
tax committee on Friday disclosed an unexpected proposal to
change that. The plan would create a "toll charge" that
"would practically eliminate conversions," says Richard Shaw
of Shenas, Shaw & Spievak, a San Diego law firm.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The proposal is in recent joint-committee-staff
recommendations to the House Ways and Means panel for
simplifying taxes; it came out at a meeting of American Bar
Association tax lawyers in Washington. It would treat a
conversion as a liquidation of the corporation and a
distribution of assets. Thus, corporate tax would be imposed
on the concern's accumulated gain in value; then the owners
would owe personal tax on the remaining balance. The
effective total tax rate could be 52.5%.</p>
<p>This treatment, rejected by legislators in 1982 and 1986,
eliminates many other S-corporation tax complexities, Shaw
says, "but at too high a cost."</p>
<p>PEACE AND COMFORT may return to the IRS's private-ruling
policy.</p>
<p>The IRS provoked protests a year ago by saying it would
stop issuing requested "comfort" rulings to confirm obvious
effects of proposed transactions; it saw no need to rule on
issues "clearly and adequately addressed by published
authority" and hoped to ease strains on its resources. But
responding to the outcries, it sought comments and delayed
the sweeping policy change to this week. Now Announcement
90-65 says the IRS has dropped the plan and will adopt some
suggested alternatives.</p>
<p>The measures will include providing a list of specific
no-ruling topics, model language for certain documents,
checklists of "safe-harbor" tests for some transactions, and
procedures for automatic rulings on certain issues. The IRS
says it will discuss each measure with tax-professional
groups before issuing specific guidelines.</p>
<p>BANKRUPTCIES are demanding 23% of Justice Department tax
lawyers' time.</p>
<p>Uncle Sam is a major creditor in many cases. The job of
protecting IRS tax claims is surging along with
bankruptcy-court filings, Assistant Attorney General Peterson
says. Justice's tax division got almost 12,000 new cases in
fiscal 1989 and expects almost 16,000 in 1990-up from 5,000
in 1986. The worst may be yet to come, she says, perhaps
arising from leveraged buy-outs of the 1980s. "LBO has in
some minds come to stand for `large bankruptcy opportunity,'"
she told the ABA tax lawyers last week.</p>
<p>Peterson says the government intends to play "an
aggressive role" in bankruptcy cases and in large cases will
seek a place on committees that speak for creditors. So far,
that has happened only in the cases of Texans William Herbert
Hunt and Nelson Bunker Hunt, where it was very productive.
The government expects to receive about $170 million in those
cases and could get an additional $165 million, depending on
the Hunts' future income.</p>
<p>Bankruptcy-court statisticians expect 735,000 filings in
fiscal 1990, up from 658,000 in 1989, and are projecting
roughly 10% rises in 1991 and 1992.</p>
<p>SOCIAL SECURITY numbers for dependents as young as two
must be listed on 1989 returns so that the IRS can check
dependency claims. It is sending notices to filers who didn't
supply the numbers or insert the words "applied for" on
returns. Filers who omitted a number for the second year will
get a stronger notice and may be assessed a new $50 penalty.</p>
<p>A $25,000 PENALTY, the new maximum, has been levied on
Charles W. Singer Jr. of Philadelphia for persisting in
frivolous and delaying tactics in Tax Court. Judge Cohen also
upheld civil fraud penalties. Singer previously pleaded
guilty in a district court of criminal tax evasion.</p>
<p>ALLEGED IRS MISCONDUCT and the agency's plans to deal with
it are to be discussed today at a hearing before a House
Government Operations panel headed by Rep. Barnard (D., Ga.).
IRS Commissioner Goldberg and Treasury Inspector General
Kirkendall are scheduled to testify.</p>
<p>MINIMUM-TAX RULES affect June payments of corporate
estimated taxes.</p>
<p>Starting this year, corporations must calculate an amount
called adjusted current earnings in determining whether they
owe the 20% alternative minimum tax instead of regular tax at
a lower effective rate. Last week, the IRS proposed rules for
computing the amount. Calendar-year corporations should use
the rules in calculating estimated taxes due June 15, Samuel
Starr of Coopers & Lybrand, CPAs, recommends. On the whole,
the rules seem reasonable, he says.</p>
<p>Banks, life-insurance concerns, and corporations that are
partners in partnerships in particular are affected by
several provisions. And a section related to employee
stock-ownership plans will hit many companies, Starr says: In
effect, it denies for minimum-tax purposes a full deduction
for dividends paid to an ESOP. Such deductions are allowed in
calculating regular taxes, on certain conditions.</p>
<p>The IRS has scheduled a hearing on the proposed rules on
Oct. 16 and 17.</p>
<p>BRIEFS: Maine plans an amnesty for tax delinquents who
step forward between Nov. 1 and Dec. 31. . . . Samuel
Sessions of the Senate Finance staff will move up to chief
tax counsel, succeeding Patrick Oglesby, who is going into
private practice.</p>
