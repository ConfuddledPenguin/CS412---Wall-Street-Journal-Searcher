	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Nissho Iwai Corp., a leading Japanese trading
firm, is holding talks with Japan Airlines and Lufthansa
German Airlines to acquire a joint stake in DHL Worldwide
Express, the world's largest express-delivery service.
   A spokesman for the Japanese carrier confirmed that
Japan's largest airline is "studying a proposal to invest in
DHL" but refused to elaborate about the negotiations. DHL
Corp., based in Brussels, couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>According to Japanese news reports, JAL, Lufthansa and
Nissho Iwai would seek to increase any DHL holdings
gradually, acquiring a majority of DHL's stock by 1992. Nihon
Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading business daily, reported that
the three firms are considering paying $500 million for a
stake in DHL. A final agreement on the plan among the three
companies is expected later this month.</p>
<p>DHL would give the Japanese air-cargo carrier access to
the expanding freight business in Europe, analysts say. The
deal would mark Nissho Iwai's entry into the
document-delivery business.</p>
<p>Analysts add that the Japanese-German link is an attempt
to counter the competitive threat of Federal Express Corp.,
which is aggressively expanding in Europe and in Asia.</p>
