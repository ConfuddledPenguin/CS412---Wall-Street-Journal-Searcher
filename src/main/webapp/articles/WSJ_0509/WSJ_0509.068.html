	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Canadian Occidental Petroleum Ltd. plans to
increase its capital spending this year by about 35%, in part
to expand its production of sodium chlorate, a compound that
is increasingly being used by the pulp and paper industry as
a more environmentally friendly substitute for chlorine in
the bleaching process.
   Jerry Wright, Canadian Occidental's chief operating
officer, said capital spending this year will rise to about
220 million Canadian dollars (US$189.2 million) from C$163.4
million in 1989. He said the company will need to increase
its long-term debt by between C$20 million and C$30 million
by the end of 1990 from C$258 million currently in order to
finance the increased capital expenditures.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Calgary, Alberta-based Canadian Occidental, which is
mainly involved in oil and gas, is 49%-owned by Occidental
Petroleum Corp. of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Mr. Wright, speaking after the company's annual meeting
here, said capital spending this year will include about C$70
million to expand two existing sodium chlorate plants in
western Canada and to add another near Edmonton, Alberta. He
said he expects the company's production of sodium chlorate
to rise to 210,000 metric tons by mid-1991 from 90,000 metric
tons currently.</p>
<p>Sodium chlorate is used as an ingredient to make chlorine
dioxide, an alternative to elemental chlorine for bleaching
pulp and paper products.</p>
<p>Ronald Slinn, vice president, pulp materials, at the
American Paper Institute in New York, said the industry has
been under pressure from both the U.S. and Canadian
governments to reduce its use of elemental chlorine, which
has been linked with the formation of dioxin, a suspected
carcinogen. He said pulp companies have been converting to
chlorine dioxide at such a rapid rate that he doesn't have
available firm statistics about its use.</p>
<p>Mr. Wright said Canadian Occidental's 1990 spending plans
also include C$50 million for oil and gas exploration, up
from C$30.7 million last year, as the company seeks to expand
its foreign energy interests.</p>
