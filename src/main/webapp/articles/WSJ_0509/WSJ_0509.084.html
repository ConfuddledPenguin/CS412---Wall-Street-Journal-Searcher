	<p class="article-leader">{The Robert Chestman insider-trading case so soon after
the Ivan Boesky plea is an} "indication why you have to
continue to put emphasis on prosecuting these cases. . . .
Together hopefully you're beginning to make a point that when
people engage in inside information . . . this is going to be
taken very seriously."
   -- U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, 1988</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Mr. Chestman vigorously denies the charges that have been
made. We are distressed that this matter has escalated to the
point of filing criminal charges. . . . It must simply be a
reflection of the times. . . . In insider-trading cases, you
sue anything that walks."</p>
<p>-- Defense lawyer Otto Obermaier</p>
<p>What a difference a couple of years makes. A federal
appeals court has vindicated Mr. Chestman, but only after he
spent 11 months in Allenwood federal prison for a crime he
did not commit because it does not exist. Mr. Giuliani,
defeated by the voters in the New York mayoral race, seems
destined to be a defense lawyer. Mr. Obermaier is now the
U.S. Attorney in Manhattan, appointed partly for his
experience defending victims of abusive white-collar
prosecutions.</p>
<p>The Second Circuit Court of Appeals decision in U.S. v.
Chestman comes too late to temper the hyped prosecutions of
Michael Milken, Robert Freeman, Richard Wigton, Timothy
Tabor. Finally, though, the judges have declared that not all
Wall Street targets in the 1980s were obvious crooks, Ivan
Boeskys trading suitcases of cash for stolen inside
information.</p>
<p>The court dealt with the technicalities of the securities
laws, but the broad problem is clear: England has one, even
Switzerland and Australia have them, but despite numerous
prosecutions the U.S. still has no definition of insider
trading. Keeping the law vague does more than help
prosecutors puff up their allegations. This is part of a
bizarre but deliberate policy that people should not know how
to follow the law and avoid transgressions that make them
accidental criminals.</p>
<p>"I see no need to define insider trading further at this
time and give fertile legal minds opportunities to exploit
loopholes," Rep. John Dingell said in a 1987 speech to the
Securities Industry Association. He was more definitive in
his 1988 SIA speech: "There will be no definition of insider
trading." For some reason, the Michigan Democrat thinks
murderers deserve clearer laws than brokers.</p>
<p>So we have Mr. Chestman last week asking to be pinched as
a reality test when he heard he'd finally been cleared. He
isn't talking publicly while prosecutors decide whether to
appeal (U.S. Attorney Obermaier has recused himself), but on
the facts it's no wonder the judges ruled he'd been wrongly
convicted of insider trading, mail fraud and perjury:</p>
<p>Ira Waldbaum decided in 1986 to sell the family chain of
grocery stores. He asked his elderly, frail sister to collect
her stock certificates. When she asked one daughter to drive
her to the bank, another daughter had to help out by picking
up the kids at school. She told her husband, Keith Loeb,
about the reason for the car-pooling. The prosecutors and SEC
alleged that Mr. Loeb then called his broker at Gruntal &
Co., Mr. Chestman, to tell him he had some "accurate,
definite" but undisclosed information about Waldbaum stock.</p>
<p>Mr. Chestman may well have bought Waldbaum stock on rumors
of the takeover by A&P before Mr. Loeb managed to get a call
in to him. "The theory put forth by the government that
stockbrokers always return calls by virtue of the nature of
their business requires a presumption that we do not care to
adopt in the context of a perjury charge," the court ruled,
giving a flavor of the prosecutorial overreaching.</p>
<p>Even if Mr. Loeb passed inside information to Mr.
Chestman, the court said there was no crime. Prosecutors said
Mr. Chestman's Rule 10b-5 "fraud" was "aiding and abetting"
Mr. Loeb to violate his fiduciary duty -- not to a company
but to his family -- to keep the takeover secret. A
fourth-hand tippee convicted for this supposed crime is too
much. Judge Roger Miner wrote that "there simply is no
evidence that he knew that Loeb was breaching a confidential
relationship." Or indeed that Mr. Loeb had any duty to keep
secret what the court called "family gossip."</p>
<p>Judge Daniel Mahoney went further. He said the SEC didn't
have the power as an agency to issue Rule 14e-3. This rule
made it a crime beginning in 1980 to "be in possession of
material information" about a tender offer that the defendant
"knows or has reason to know is nonpublic" and from an
insider. This knows-or-has-reason-to-know language has been
applied to people who have no contractual or other legal duty
to keep information secret, such as those who overhear a
rumor on the golfcourse or in the elevator. Judge Mahoney
invalidated Rule 14e-3 for creating a crime where "there is
no requirement that any fiduciary duty exist or be violated."</p>
<p>Why have so many prosecutors and regulators insisted on
leaving insider trading undefined? One reason is that this
advanced the agenda dating from the 1970s to have the courts
do what Congress would never do by making it a crime simply
to know something in the market that someone else doesn't
know. A favorite example of this equality-of-information
notion is that if a passenger in a plane sees a big fire at a
firm's main factory it should be a crime for him to sell the
stock short.</p>
<p>Forced equality of information is an odd idea in an
industry with legions of analysts paid to ferret out
information and where Moms and Pops pay mutual funds to watch
markets for them. The law does not require a buyer to tell
the seller there might be oil under his land; why should a
trader be jailed if he's the first to learn that a company is
a fraud and sells the stock?</p>
<p>Indeed, the Supreme Court has twice defeated this
equal-information theory as unworkable and unwise. Now the
Chestman case puts in doubt what prosecutors call the
"misappropriation theory." This tries to create a legal duty
against using information that others don't have --
equal-information by another name.</p>
<p>The narrow enforcement goal of prosecutors can sometimes
lead them to forget the cost of overcriminalizing. Efficient
markets require information, the faster the better. Vague
insider-trading laws chill this information.</p>
<p>Congress can make an honest crime of insider trading by
legislating a definition. One already on the books would fit
fine: theft. Mr. Boesky stole from clients despite his
contract to keep their secrets. When lawyers or financial
printers break their duties to clients, they become thieves.
Anyone who breaks a clear legal duty to keep news
confidential should be liable to the owner of the
information.</p>
<p>Conversely, if there's no legal duty to keep information
confidential, there should be no crime. There is no reason to
prosecute fourth-hand tippees or security analysts. A
definition of insider trading as theft would convict the
criminal, protect the innocent and speed legitimate
information to markets.</p>
