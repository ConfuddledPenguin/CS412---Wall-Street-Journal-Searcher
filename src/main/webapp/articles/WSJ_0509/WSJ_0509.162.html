	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The House passed a bill directing the
Securities and Exchange Commission to improve coordination of
the clearance and settlement of stocks and related financial
instruments.
   The measure, approved on a voice vote, is a reaction to
the October 1987 stock-market crash. Studies show that
trading during the crash strained the back-office payment
systems for stocks, options and futures.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The bill doesn't specify how the clearing and settlement
functions are to be linked, but directs the SEC to report
back to Congress within two years.</p>
<p>The SEC backs the legislation, and a similar provision is
included in the Senate's pending market-revision bill.</p>
