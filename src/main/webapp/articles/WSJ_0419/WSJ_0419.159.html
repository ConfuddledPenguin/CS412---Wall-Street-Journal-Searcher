	<p class="article-leader">Merck & Co. said first-quarter net income rose 19% on a
12% sales gain, aided by growth in new products from the big
pharmaceutical company. Pfizer Inc. first-quarter profit rose
4.6% on a 3.2% sales gain.
   Merck, based in Rahway, N.J., said net income rose to
$403.8 million, or $1.03 a share, from $340.4 million, or 86
cents a share. Sales rose to $1.76 billion from $1.57
billion; foreign exchange translations reduced sales by one
percentage point.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Results were a bit better than some analysts' estimates,
and Merck shares rose 62.5 cents to close at $74.375 in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Dr. P. Roy Vagelos, chairman and chief executive officer,
said both domestic and international operations reported unit
volume gains. Sales outside the U.S. accounted for 45% of
first-quarter sales, compared with 49% a year earlier.</p>
<p>Merck said its cholesterol-lowering agent Mevacor
continues to grow and holds a 57% share of the market. Other
strong sales leaders include Vasotec, a high-blood-pressure
and congestive-heart-failure drug; Zocor, another
cholesterol-lowering agent sold overseas; and Pepcid, used to
treat duodenal and gastric ulcers, which is "growing rapidly
in the U.S.," Merck said.</p>
<p>The company said unit sales declined for a group of
longer-established human and animal health products, because
of competition.</p>
<p>Merck said it had a $90 million pretax gain in the quarter
from the previously reported sale of U.S. rights to an
anti-depressant drug; the gain was offset by provisions for
additional environmental costs, and certain other costs
including expenses related to the 1992 relocation of
corporate headquarters.</p>
<p>New York-based Pfizer said net income rose to $251.9
million, or $1.50 a share, from $240.8 million, or $1.43 a
share. Sales advanced to $1.48 billion from $1.44 billion.
Analysts had expected results to be about flat. A footnote to
the earnings report said first-quarter results "are not
necessarily indicative" of full-year results.</p>
<p>In Big Board composite trading, Pfizer closed at $58.875,
up 12.5 cents.</p>
<p>The latest quarter included a pretax gain of $39 million
on the sale of the DeKalb-Pfizer Genetics seed partnership.</p>
<p>Pfizer said the stronger U.S. dollar reduced first-quarter
sales growth by 2%, while deconsolidation of the pigments
business, which is being sold, reduced sales another 2%;
without those factors, sales rose 7% in the quarter.</p>
<p>Pfizer said health-care sales rose 5%; consumer products,
6%; and specialty chemicals, 5%. Animal-health sales were
flat, while specialty minerals sales fell 19% because of the
pending pigments-business sale.</p>
