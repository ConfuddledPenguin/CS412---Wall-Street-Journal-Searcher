	<p class="article-leader">LITHUANIA SAID the Soviet Union severed oil supplies to
the Baltic republic.
   Despite an offer by lawmakers in Vilnius to cease
secession-related legislative action if the Kremlin opens
immediate talks, a spokesman for Lithuania's legislature said
Moscow cut off the supply of oil to the republic's only
refinery. It wasn't known whether natural-gas deliveries also
had been disrupted as part of Gorbachev's threatened economic
embargo. Lithuania, which proclaimed its independence March
11, is entirely dependent on the Soviet Union for energy
supplies.</p>

saying action against Lithuania could doom U.S. and Soviet
commercial relations.</p>

<p>THE JUSTICES BACKED a judge's power to order school
desegregation funds.</p>
<p>Defying expectations, a divided Supreme Court reaffirmed
the authority of courts to correct constitutional violations,
ruling that a federal judge may require a Kansas City, Mo.,
school district to raise taxes to pay for desegregation. The
court also said a judge may block enforcement of state laws
that interfere with funding the plan. At the same time,
however, the justices said there must be limits on the
enforcement power of federal judges.</p>
<p>The court, voting 6-3 in an Ohio case, ruled that a state
may make it illegal to possess or view child pornography,
even in the privacy of one's home.</p>

<p>Pro-Iranian kidnappers in Lebanon said they would release
by tomorrow one of three American educators as a humanitarian
gesture. The announcement by the group Islamic Jihad for the
Liberation of Palestine, which was accompanied by a
photograph of hostage Jesse Turner, said the captive would
carry a message for Bush.</p>

<p>Bush closed an international conference on global warming
by ignoring the differences among the delegates. Speaking at
the end of the two-day parley in Washington aimed at forging
a policy on the greenhouse effect, the president said the
U.S. had "never considered research a substitute for action"
on the issue.</p>

<p>A new cancer drug proved successful with very few side
effects in treating a relatively rare form of leukemia,
researchers said. The drug, 2-CdA, produced nearly complete
remissions in 12 patients with hairy-cell leukemia who
underwent one seven-day treatment.</p>

<p>Britain's government confirmed that steel tubes seized
last week by officials in England are parts for a huge gun
bound for Iraq. It was the first high-level acknowledgment of
the pipes' military potential. But experts remain puzzled by
the workings of such a weapon.</p>

<p>East and West Germany opened negotiations on
reunification, and Bonn said talks on a monetary union could
start tomorrow. West Germany's ZDF television network,
meanwhile, reported that the Kremlin has told East German
Prime Minister de Maiziere that it opposes quick unification.</p>

<p>Major universities are warning the Pentagon that a
military policy barring homosexuals from service is
generating pressure to oust ROTC from campuses. Groups from
MIT, the University of Wisconsin, Northwestern and elsewhere
have protested the officer-training corps policy. The
Pentagon has declined to comment on the issue.</p>

<p>NASA advanced the date for the second launch attempt of
the space shuttle Discovery, saying the spacecraft and the
Hubble Space Telescope are ready for a Tuesday liftoff. The
launch had been set for Wednesday, 15 days after the first
attempt was scrubbed because of a faulty power unit.</p>

<p>A rifle-fired grenade slammed into a school bus during
Christian factional fighting in Lebanon, killing at least 11
children and four other people. Police said the vehicle was
hit while crossing into mainly Christian eastern Beirut as it
was returning from the southern part of the capital.</p>

<p>A series of earthquakes rattled Northern California, but
didn't cause major damage or injuries. The temblors, the
hardest registering 5.4 on the Richter scale, shook a 100mile
area from San Francisco to Salinas on the anniversary of the
1906 quake.</p>

<p>Mexico demanded that Washington explain the seizure of a
Mexican doctor charged in the 1985 murder of U.S. drug agent
Enrique Camarena. The physician reportedly was kidnapped by
bounty hunters and brought to Los Angeles this month.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Nepal's prime minister-designate named eight cabinet
ministers to form the Himalayan kingdom's first
opposition-led government in almost 30 years. The official,
dissident K.P. Bhattarai, said he would retain the defense
and foreign portfolios. The list was sent to King Birendra
for approval.</p>
