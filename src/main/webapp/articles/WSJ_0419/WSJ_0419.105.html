	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency
announced that it plans to reduce indoor air pollution caused
by chemical emissions from new carpets and during carpet
installation.
   This announcement follows a Jan. 11, 1990, petition filed
with the agency by the National Federation of Federal
Employees. The petition charges that the health of agency
workers and union members has been hurt by carpet emissions
at the EPA's headquarters in Washington.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The agency has asked carpet companies to voluntarily test
all of their products for total chemical emissions and to
provide the public with comparative information on emissions.
The carpet industry has already promised to conduct voluntary
testing to identify specific chemicals emitted by new
carpeting.</p>
<p>There is no scientific evidence on the health effects of
carpet emissions, the EPA said, although numerous chemicals
are emitted by carpets. The union identified
4-phenylcyclohexene as a cause of respiratory and other
illnesses, due to fumes from carpets installed in a poorly
ventilated area of the office.</p>
<p>Conclusive evidence on the health hazards posed by carpets
won't be available soon, and the agency said it will continue
expanding its research into the health effects of complex
chemicals from all indoor sources.</p>
