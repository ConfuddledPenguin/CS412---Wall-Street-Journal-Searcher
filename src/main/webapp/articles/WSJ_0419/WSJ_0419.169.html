	<p class="article-leader">American Toxxic Control Inc. directors said they canceled
negotiations with Verit Industries about the proposed
acquisition of American Toxxic by a Verit subsidiary.
   Last Thursday, Verit said its 80%-owned LaPointe
Industries Inc. unit, which recently emerged from
bankruptcy-court proceedings as a shell company, had agreed
in principle to merge in a transaction that would give
American Toxxic common stock of LaPointe.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Verit said it expected LaPointe to change its name to
American Toxxic Control and apply for a listing on the
American Stock Exchange after the merger was completed. Verit
also offered to help American Toxxic restructure about $4
million of debt.</p>
<p>American Toxxic, based in Whittier, Calif., is involved in
treating chemical-industry wastes.</p>
<p>A statement issued late yesterday by Verit, based in
Phoenix, Ariz., described the negotiations as having been
"mutually terminated." But Ski Milburn, chief executive
officer of American Toxxic, said Verit was "trying to save
face" with that wording, which he said was inaccurate. "We
discontinued the negotiations. They said, `Oh, please no,'"
according to Mr. Milburn.</p>
<p>Mr. Milburn, who said he had succeeded American Toxxic
founder and director Louis Purmort as chairman last year,
said Mr. Purmort had brought the Verit proposal to the
American Toxxic board originally. Mr. Milburn said, however,
that after the preliminary agreement had been reached, Mr.
Milburn had raised some "real questions about Verit's balance
sheet" last week.</p>
<p>He also said a Wall Street Journal article on Verit
earlier this week presented information that the board
believed Verit should have made available previously to
American Toxxic.</p>
