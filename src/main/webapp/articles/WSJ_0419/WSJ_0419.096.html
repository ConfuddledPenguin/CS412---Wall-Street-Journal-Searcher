	<p class="article-leader">Ottawa -- A primary-school teacher leads her gaggle of
grade fivers down the long high-vaulted art gallery. They
stop short 20 feet before an immense canvas hanging on the
end wall. Then, slowly, she starts them forward again. "Can
you feel anything yet?" she calls. Nervous giggles, much
scrunching of eyes and fists, "It feels interesting]" comes a
small voice from the back of the group.
   The painting is "Voice of Fire," a gigantic 18-by-8-foot
work that the late U.S. abstract expressionist Barnett Newman
created for the U.S. Pavilion at EXPO 67 in Montreal. This
red-and-blue-striped canvas has ignited the hottest debate
over art in Canada since the government began to assemble a
national art collection in 1880.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The gallery's pamphlet says: "`Voice of Fire' is a visual
call beckoning the visitor to come closer," and these grade
fivers are here to discover if that's what it does for them.</p>
<p>Not everyone in Canada who's voiced an opinion about this
new acquisition by Canada's National Gallery has been to
Ottawa to see it. Most have reacted to seeing it on
television or in the newspaper, and finding out that it cost
just under 1.8 million Canadian dollars ($1.5 million) in
public funds.</p>
<p>"Voice of Fire" is minimalist art, only three strong
stripes of color, two intensely vivid stripes of ultramarine
blue flanking a single stripe in deep cadmium red. "It's
about seeing and being," the contemporary curators say, "a
modern masterpiece, a mystical work for a secular age." And
they're thrilled that the Gallery nabbed it at a price that
other modern art collectors would consider a steal.</p>
<p>Ordinary Canadians, however, see it differently. Mired in
a time of rising deficits and fiscal restraint, they're
outraged at the price and have responded not only with an
avalanche of letters to the newspapers and their members of
Parliament but also by making their own copies, mocking
imitations, ranging from an exact replica painted by an
Ottawa Valley, Ontario, farmer (he says it cost him 480
Canadian dollars and he has it for sale for 1,000) to a
red-and-blue-striped cocktail concocted by a Montreal
barkeep. If, as the National Gallery's director, Shirley
Thomson, says, "the role of great art is to provoke," then
the Newman work is doing its job.</p>
<p>Mr. Newman first developed ties with Canada in the early
'50s when he went to Emma Lake, Saskatchewan, to work with a
group of young artists. Several of them, including sculptor
Robert Murray and painter Guido Molinari, have gone on to
international reputations. The painter's widow, Annalee
Newman, says he always maintained sentimental ties to the
country, and when the National Gallery approached her in 1987
to purchase "Voice of Fire" for its handsome new building in
Ottawa she offered them a bargain. Her late husband, she
says, would have liked to see the picture hanging there.</p>
<p>In the past three years the rocketing art market has seen
painting of a similar scale by Mr. Newman go for as much as 3
million Canadian dollars, in particular a painting that went
to the Kawamura Memorial Museum in Tokyo last year. Despite
this, and although it took the gallery nearly two years to
complete its complicated purchase procedures. Mrs. Newman
made no attempt to raise the price. The deal finally was
settled last summer but announced to the public only last
month.</p>
<p>Since then a flood of criticism has engulfed the National
Gallery. Even senior federal politicians have gotten into the
act. The chairman of Parliament's cultural-affairs committee,
Felix Holtmann, a prairie pig farmer from Manitoba, told a
local radio audience there that "given two cans of paint, a
roller and about 10 minutes" he could produce the same thing.
Mr. Holtmann later turned up to chair the political committee
called to investigate the purchase wearing a red-and-blue
vertically striped Newman knockoff that he called his "Tie of
ire."</p>
<p>At a more serious level, the national union of Canadian
visual artists, Canadian Artists Representation, has publicly
attacked the purchase on the grounds that the money was spent
on an American painting and not on Canadian art. Gallery
officials have tried in vain to explain that they saved up to
make the expensive buy and that, anyway, 42% of their total
annual acquisitions budget has been spent acquiring Canadian
works. (The Gallery also has important collections of
European and Asian art and an outstanding photography
collection, all of which must be maintained.)</p>
<p>Three weeks ago the federal cabinet's powerful
expenditures-review committee finally responded to public
pressure and declared that it would scrutinize the purchase.
There have been dark hints that the financially pressed
government might try to reverse the deal or auction the
picture off for a profit. Any such move would be in direct
contradiction of federal law, which prohibits political
interference in the operations of the National Gallery or any
other federal cultural agency. A new museum act passed by the
same government just two months ago reinforced the point.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the federal minister responsible for
culture, Marcel Masse, felt compelled last week to turn up at
a gallery reception to reassure the guests that he, at least,
is a strong supporter of what is known in Canada as the
"arms-length" principle. Unfortunately, Mr. Masse also is
known to be often out of step with his cabinet colleagues and
was vague when asked if they were sympathetic to his views.
Nor could he be persuaded to give his opinion of the Newman
work, even though he is well known as an art lover.</p>
<p>For its part, the National Gallery has made a stumbling
response to the furor. While director Thomson has defended
the picture bravely, much of the language she has used to
explain its importance has been couched in unintelligible art
jargonese. For ordinary Canadians looking at the three blank
stripes of color, being told that "the painting helps take us
away from the devastating cares of everyday life" has not
been enough.</p>
<p>While the flap has brought a flood of new visitors to the
gallery, many of whom have never been inside a museum, there
has been no literature or curator available to explain what
Mr. Newman's life and work are all about. Only now, three
long weeks after the crisis broke, have gallery officials
decided to distribute a flyer to try and inform viewers about
the picture. Unfortunately, a draft version suggests that
even this will be alarmingly bogged down in the language so
favored by contemporary art experts.</p>
<p>Brydon Smith, the gallery's assistant director and a
respected curator of contemporary art, is not renowned for
his gift with words. His text is peppered with references to
the picture as an "objectification of thought" that "floods
our consciousness with a sublime sense of awe and
tranquility."</p>
<p>With greater clarity, director Thomson points out that in
1907 when the gallery first started to collect the flamboyant
impressionistic images of northern forests and sylvan lakes
created by what is now Canada's best-known group of artists,
the Group of Seven, there was a similiar if more muted outcry
from the public. "Great works aren't always instantly
appreciated" she says wryly, "but at least people are talking
about art."</p>
<p>Entering the high gallery for the first time, the effect
is startling. The picture is awesome. It looks like a
modern-day stained glass window on the simple back wall of a
contemporary cathedral. Closer up, one sees how the artist
did it. Not with a paint roller, a la Mr. Holtmann, but with
a small paintbrush and tiny strokes, building up layer after
layer of color in painstaking hours and days of work. There
is a luminosity to the paint, just as the experts say. And,
maybe those worrisome thoughts of everyday life are forgotten
for a moment and one is suspended in time and space. Still,
back on Earth, it's comforting to know, as Mr. Smith told the
political committee, that the word "top" is marked on the
back of the picture so that anyone hanging it can be quite
certain which end is up.</p>
