	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- Coca-Cola Co. said first-quarter net income
climbed 9.1% to $283.5 million from $259.8 million, fueled by
a strong 9% growth in international volume, as measured in
gallon sales of concentrates and syrups.
   The soft-drink giant said gallon sales swelled 10% in
Japan, one of its biggest profit centers, as a result of new
packaging and additional flavors of noncarbonated products.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Per-share earnings in the latest quarter rose 15% to 83
cents from 72 cents, in part because of a 5% drop in the
number of shares outstanding. Last year's quarterly results
included a gain of $15 million, or three cents a share, from
the sale of the company's coffee business.</p>
<p>First-quarter revenue rose 12.4% to $2.15 billion from
$1.91 billion a year ago.</p>
<p>The results, which were in line with most Wall Street
analysts' estimates, reflect Coke's reliance on its
operations abroad as the driving force behind its
profitability. International sales today account for 80% of
the company's soft-drink operating profit and 65% of
soft-drink revenue. Retail case sales abroad rose 10%.</p>
<p>"These results are a hint of things to come," said George
Thompson, an analyst with Prudential-Bache. "With
international sales up 10%, Coke is at the higher end of its
8% to 10% long-range target for growth. In my opinion, that
can continue for some time."</p>
<p>For all of the Pacific Rim, gallon sales increased 6%,
including an increase of more than 25% in Thailand because of
added equipment and successful marketing. Coke said
retail-case sales grew 13% in the Pacific.</p>
<p>The one dismal spot abroad was Argentina, where gallon
sales plummeted 42% in the quarter as a result of the South
American country's economic morass. Even so, Coke was able to
post a 2% increase in gallon sales in Latin America as a
whole, with a good showing in Mexico and Brazil.</p>
<p>The company said gallon sales in Europe soared 23% in the
first quarter, largely as a result of German bottlers
accumulating inventory and improved distribution in France.
Analysts say the spread of democracy in Eastern Europe bodes
particularly well for Coke. "With the walls coming down, Coke
is in excellent position to take advantage of trade abroad,"
said John Maxwell, an analyst with Wheat First Securities.</p>
<p>By contrast, the company's domestic performance was
lackluster. Retail case sales in the U.S. increased 3%, with
fountain volume rising a meager 1%. Gallon sales of
concentrates and syrups in the U.S. increased 2%.
"Domestically, it's nothing to write home about," said
Emanuel Goldman, an analyst with PaineWebber Research in San
Francisco, who blamed continuing softness in fast-food
restaurant operations for the disappointing fountain results.
"The fountain is the drag here, and that's one-third of
domestic business."</p>
<p>Coke's archrival, PepsiCo Inc., is expected to report that
it fared better domestically in the first quarter, with a 6%
growth in gallon sales, Mr. Goldman said. Among other things,
the Purchase, N.Y.-based company isn't as dependent on
fountain sales as Coke is and those restaurants where it is
sold, particularly its own Pizza Hut and Taco Bell chains,
are generally enjoying heavier customer traffic. "Certainly
in the first quarter, Pepsi's numbers domestically will
outshine Coke," Mr. Goldman said. "But Coke's international
business is very strong, and that's where it makes its money
-- overseas."</p>
<p>In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, the stock closed at $79.25, down $1.</p>
