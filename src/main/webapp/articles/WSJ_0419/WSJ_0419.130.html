	<p class="article-leader">Overmyer Corp. said it filed for Chapter 11 protection
under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code for itself and its two
subsidiaries, Aquality Inc. and Premier Pump & Pool Products
Inc.
   The Winchester, Ind., maker of glass and swimming pool
equipment said the filings were brought about by difficulties
in negotiating a continuation of adequate credit lines with
its principal lender that would enable the company to conduct
normal business operations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In addition, Overmyer cited a combination of business
factors underlying the situation, including losses at Premier
Pump, an extremely weak swimming pool market and a
"precipitous downturn in the commercial market for glass
container mould equipment." For the third quarter ended Oct.
1, 1989, Overmyer had a loss of $39,632, or four cents a
share, on sales of $7.8 million.</p>
<p>Overmyer said that at the time of the filings, adequate
cash reserves existed and the process of securing
"restructured, post-petition financing" was under way.</p>
