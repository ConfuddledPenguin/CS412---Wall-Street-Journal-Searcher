	<p class="article-leader">EASTERN AIRLINES was turned over to a trustee by a
bankruptcy judge, who took control of the financially
battered carrier away from Texas Air and Chairman Frank
Lorenzo. Named as trustee was Martin R. Shugrue, who was
ousted last year as president of Continental Airlines, Texas
Air's other airline unit. Unsecured creditors sought a
trustee because they blamed management for Eastern's
ever-growing losses.
