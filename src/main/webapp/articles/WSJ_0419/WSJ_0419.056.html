	<p class="article-leader">Imagine that in a single year your business is the subject
of hearings by 14 committees and 43 subcommittees of the U.S.
Congress. Consider that about 1,500 staff members devote
nearly all of their time to your issues. And imagine that
they call your company 599,000 times in a year.
   You're beginning to understand what it's like to run the
Pentagon. These and other amazing facts are contained in a
study released this month by Secretary of Defense Dick
Cheney. The 41-page "White Paper on the Department of Defense
and the Congress" shows that it's impossible to understand
gold-plated Pentagon hammers without also understanding the
meddling of the U.S. Congress.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The current congressional defense process is
characterized by a multiplicity of actors, frequent
decisions, lack of finality, disintegration and lack of
accountability," says the White Paper, in typical
Pentagonese. In other words, Dick Cheney is Gulliver in
Capitol Hill's Lilliput. While influence by Congress is
obviously important in a democracy, congressional control
over defense has grown like Topsy in the past 20 years. It's
yet more evidence that Congress has grabbed power from the
executive branch since Watergate.</p>
<p>In 1988 alone Congress sent the Pentagon some 18,000
letters, usually in the form of all-purpose requests for
documents or information. The Pentagon spent some 245,000
hours just answering this mail. Then there are congressional
requests for "reports." Those increased to 861 requests in
1989 from 36 in 1970, or more than 2,000%. The average report
takes about 1,000 hours to prepare and costs about $50,000.
Among the urgent report topics: a new hospital at the Army
medical center near Rep. Pat Schroeder's Colorado district.</p>
<p>Capitol Hill supervision is most inane on the budget, with
the President's annual request now little more than a
sideshow. Congress's budget fixes doubled in number in the
1970s and they multiplied by several hundred percent again
from 1982 to 1987. Congress now alters more than 60% of the
Pentagon's budget line items.</p>
<p>As if this weren't enough, no budget decision is ever
final. The White Paper points out that a program can be
adjusted on at least 14 different occasions as it makes its
way through the annual legislative "process." An unneeded
F-14D jet can be slipped in at any point along the way, or a
B-2 bomber chopped away.</p>
<p>The classic examples are the four "studies" Mr. Cheney has
to supply Congress before he can even think about closing a
military base. Mikhail Gorbachev has an easier time closing
bases. An American President's only leverage is the veto, but
only if he has the nerve to veto an entire spending bill (or
close down the entire government if it gets packed into one
giant "continuing resolution").</p>
<p>The White Paper doesn't quantify the cost of all this, but
it's safe to assume it's billions of dollars each year. With
each dollar meaning more as defense spending is cut, we'd
have thought this problem might warrant some Washington
attention. Mr. Cheney's report barely rated a paragraph in
most major news media. Somehow Pentagon waste, fraud and
abuse is a story only when defense contractors are involved.</p>
<p>The complaint on the Hill just now is that Mr. Cheney
hasn't proposed a new defense "strategy." But what's the
point of a strategy if more than 60% of what's proposed is
sliced, diced or spliced? If the Lilliputians want to
strangle Gulliver, they should also get credit for the
"strategy."</p>
