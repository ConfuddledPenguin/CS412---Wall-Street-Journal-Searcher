	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- American Telephone & Telegraph Co., buoyed
by continued strength in its long-distance business and
slimmer costs, said net income rose 12% in the quarter on a
2.7% increase in sales.
   Net income for the first three months was $668 million, or
62 cents a share, from $594 million, or 55 cents a share, a
year earlier. Revenue rose to $8.89 billion from $8.66
billion in the 1989 quarter.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While earnings were slightly below analysts' expectations
of 68 cents to 70 cents a share, AT&T posted a strong 21%
increase in operating profit in the quarter, to $1.18 billion
from $977 million the previous year, indicating that its
struggle to control costs is paying off.</p>
<p>Net income was hurt by several factors including increased
interest expenses, a higher tax rate and costs associated
with last January's network disaster, when a software problem
shut down the company's nationwide long-distance network for
nine hours. In addition, AT&T's telecommunications-equipment
business continues to suffer from increased price competition
and a softening of orders for switching equipment from local
telephone companies.</p>
<p>Despite these problems, AT&T Chairman Robert E. Allen said
the New York-based company's results showed it was off to "a
strong start toward making 1990 an even stronger year than
1989, which was our best."</p>
<p>Mr. Allen, who made his comments at the company's annual
meeting at the convention center here, added that AT&T has
set a goal for itself of increasing its earnings by at least
10% to 12% annually. "We were clearly ahead of that in the
first quarter. Typically, the first quarter is a weak one for
us." (Profit in the first quarter actually rose slightly more
than 12%.)</p>
<p>However, AT&T received a boost from businesses that had
not been a part of the company a year earlier, including
Istel Group Ltd., a U.K. information services company
acquired in the fourth quarter of 1989, and two divisions of
PacifiCorp Financial Services, which were purchased by AT&T
Capital Corp. during the first quarter.</p>
<p>AT&T's revenue from product sales, including telephone and
computer equipment, increased a meager 1.2% to $2.72 billion
from $2.69 billion the year before. Mr. Allen blamed the
lackluster sales on the "rather weak economy" and a backlog
in computer-systems sales "due to customer demand and our
inability to fill that demand." To improve shipments, AT&T
recently began manufacturing personal computers to augment
supplies from Intel Corp.</p>
<p>Mr. Allen said the company is banking on new products to
boost sales. These include its recently announced credit
card, in which orders so far "have exceeded our wildest
expectations . . . customers are calling us by the tens of
thousands." In addition, he announced that AT&T will begin
selling switching equipment based on an optical computer
processor developed by Bell Laboratories, within five years.</p>
<p>Analysts reacted favorably to the company's results. "The
earnings masked what was probably AT&T's best quarter since
divestiture," said Jack B. Grubman, an analyst at PaineWebber
Inc. Long-distance "volume is up 7% and operating margins
were 13.2%, two points higher than a year ago. That's a lot
of expansion for a company this size." He estimated that the
network outage alone cost AT&T about three cents a share
because of lost revenue and remittances to business customers
covered under AT&T's 800 Assurance Plan.</p>
<p>Robert B. Morris III, telecommunications analyst at
Goldman, Sachs & Co., said AT&T earnings were about three
cents less than his estimate. And sales, general and
administrative expenses were 35.2% of revenue "when I had
expected 34%." But Mr. Morris said, "I wouldn't characterize
this as a disappointing quarter."</p>
<p>At the shareholder meeting, Mr. Allen defended the
company's previously reported decision to withdraw its
funding of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. AT&T
announced the move on March 26 following pressure applied on
the company by shareholding anti-abortion activists.</p>
<p>Referring to protests by Planned Parenthood, Mr. Allen
said: "I'm disappointed in their actions. If someone were
supporting me for 25 years, I would say `thank you.' In the
last 25 years, we funded them to the tune of $600,000, and we
never heard a word of thanks from them."</p>
<p>Mr. Allen added that AT&T will spend $2.5 million this
year supporting teen-pregnancy prevention programs similar to
those they had been supporting at Planned Parenthood.</p>
<p>Mr. Allen said Planned Parenthood has elevated the
abortion issue to political advocacy and that "this caused
our opponents and proponents to say that we are supporting
abortion. I concluded -- I should say the {AT&T} foundation
concluded -- that abortion or opposing abortion shouldn't be
supported by the corporation."</p>
<p>A first-time shareholder proposal that AT&T stop funding
organizations that advocate abortion managed to win 5.5% of
the votes cast at the company's annual meeting, insuring its
inclusion on the ballot for a second time at AT&T's 1991
meeting. Another resolution, calling on AT&T to drop its
affirmative action program, garnered 8.8% of the vote, less
than the 10% it needed to be included for the fourth time
next year.</p>
<p>AT&T common stock fell $1 yesterday to close at $41 a
share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
