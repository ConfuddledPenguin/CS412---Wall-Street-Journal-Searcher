	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Bond prices tumbled for the second day in a
row on U.S. inflation fears and more selling by Japanese
investors.
   Treasury bond prices fell the hardest. Some actively
traded bonds dropped 1 1/8 points, or $11.25 for each $1,000
face amount. Their yield jumped to 8.83%, the highest in
nearly a year, and most short-term interest rates also rose.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Japanese selling is pummeling the U.S. bond market
especially hard because traders are bracing for an avalanche
of U.S. government borrowing soon. In the past, Japanese
investors eagerly have bought large amounts of U.S. bonds.
But this time around, the Japanese may not be so eager
because many have been jolted by plunges in Japanese stock
and bond prices.</p>
<p>"The atmosphere in the bond market is terrible," said
Scott Pardee, co-chairman of Yamaichi International (America)
Inc.</p>
<p>Joel D. Kazis, managing director of government bond
trading at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. agreed.
"Sentiment has turned overwhelmingly bearish as we head
closer and closer" to the Treasury's massive quarterly
financing next month, he said. There has been "sizable
selling from abroad," mostly from Japan. "So the Street is
wondering how it's going to take down all the new supply with
the foreigners selling," Mr. Kazis said.</p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury probably will issue about $30 billion of
new notes and bonds early in May. Details will be announced
May 2. Most traders expect the department to sell $10 billion
each of three-year notes, 10-year notes and 30-year bonds.
All this borrowing is likely to drive up 30-year bond yields
to 9% or higher, several analysts said.</p>
<p>But that's only part of the bond market woes. Investors
still are reeling from Tuesday morning's news that U.S.
consumer prices surged 0.5% last month. The increase was more
than twice as large as economists had expected, bringing the
first quarter's annualized inflation rate to a sizzling 8.5%.</p>
<p>That news quickly extinguished hopes for a credit-easing
move by the Federal Reserve any time soon. Many analysts now
say the Fed's next step probably will be to push interest
rates higher. That speculation has intensified lately because
of indications that the economy is perking up. The consumer
price index report "really took the wind out of the market,"
Mr. Kazis said.</p>
<p>"Inflation concerns are starting to re-emerge, and that's
a big concern," said Thomas R. Pura, a partner at Goldman,
Sachs & Co. "Then you top that off with rumors of potential
Japanese lack of interest" in U.S. bonds to be sold next
month at the Treasury's quarterly financing, "and you get a
market that trades pretty poorly."</p>
<p>Rising Japanese interest rates may provide another reason
for Japanese investors to keep their money at home rather
than invest here. "On a comparative basis, Japanese bond
yields at 7.3% are more attractive to Japanese investors,
now, compared to U.S. bond yields than they have been in a
long, long time," Mr. Pura said.</p>
<p>Several leading Japanese securities dealers here say
Japanese institutions are increasingly leery of U.S. bonds.</p>
<p>"We have seen selling by investors, including those from
Japan," said Mr. Pardee of Yamaichi. "Japanese investors are
lying very low. They've had big problems in their own
financial markets, and they haven't shown any inclination to
buy Treasurys. If anything, they've been selling Treasurys to
take profits on the strong dollar."</p>
<p>Mr. Pardee also said "there's beginning to be a feeling
among some Japanese investors that the dollar is peaking
against the yen so they're taking their profits now."</p>
<p>Although U.S. bond yields have surged this week, neither
Japanese nor U.S. investors have any incentive to buy
securities ahead of the huge supply of new issues that will
hit the market next month when the Treasury holds its
quarterly refunding, Mr. Pardee added.</p>
<p>Some Fed policy makers watch bond market trends closely to
gauge investor expectations of future inflation. Thus, this
week's bond debacle increases the likelihood of a Fed
credit-tightening move. But economic indicators still are
sufficiently ambiguous that key Fed policy makers may prefer
to wait for more data before acting.</p>
<p>All this gloom easily overshadowed other news that many
traders initially thought would spark a bond rally. Early
yesterday, the Commerce Department reported that the U.S.
merchandise trade deficit shrank to $6.49 billion in February
from $9.32 billion in January. That was the smallest gap
since December 1983. It was also smaller than most economists
had anticipated.</p>
<p>But in yesterday's bond maelstrom, the trade report hardly
caused a stir. Traders also aren't reacting to recent
declines in oil prices, once watched closely as an inflation
barometer.</p>
<p>"Nobody's even talking about oil anymore," said Mr. Kazis
of Smith Barney. "That shows you how bad the market's mood
is."</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>The Treasury bond market's slump deepened yesterday.</p>
<p>Long-term government bonds, which dropped about one point
Tuesday, fell another 1 1/8 points yesterday. The
government's benchmark 30-year issue yielded 8.83%, the
highest since May of last year and up from 8.72% Tuesday.</p>
<p>Rates rose again on short-term Treasury bills. The
Treasury's latest three-month bills were quoted late in the
day at a discount rate of 7.80% bid to yield 8.05%. Late
Tuesday, they were quoted at a rate of 7.76% to yield 8%.</p>
<p>The Treasury's huge borrowing needs next month already are
weighing heavily on the markets. Moreover, the Treasury said
yesterday it plans to sell about $10.5 billion of new
two-year notes next Wednesday. That is up from the $10
billion of two-year notes sold late last month.</p>
<p>The new notes will be dated April 30 and will be due April
30 of 1992. They will be sold in minimum denominations of
$5,000.</p>
<p>Corporate Issues</p>
<p>Corporate bond prices slumped again.</p>
<p>Some long-term, investment-grade bonds lost as much as a
point. Prices also fell on corporate junk bonds, or
high-yield, high-risk corporate securities. Junk bonds of
Quantum Chemical Corp. fell by 1 1/2 points on news of lower
first-quarter earnings.</p>
<p>But moving in the other direction were some bonds of RJR
Nabisco Inc. Prices of RJR's pay-in-kind bonds, which pay
interest in the form of additional bonds instead of cash,
have recently surged on speculation that Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts & Co. is snapping up the bonds. A spokesman for RJR,
which is controlled by Kohlberg Kravis, declined to comment.</p>
<p>RJR Nabisco's 13.71% convertible pay-in-kind debentures,
due in 2009, rose a point to 83 1/2 on the New York Stock
Exchange. The other widely held RJR issue, the 13.71%
exchangeable pay-in-kind debentures, maturing in 2007, rose
3/4 point to 70 3/4.</p>
<p>Among new investment-grade issues, Ontario Hydro, a large
Canadian utility, tapped the U.S. debt market with $600
million of five-year notes. The notes were priced to yield
9.25% through underwriters led by Salomon Brothers Inc.</p>
<p>Ontario Hydro is the latest Canadian issuer to tap the
U.S. markets to take advantage of the relatively attractive
rates here. Despite the recent rise in U.S. rates, the
difference between U.S. and Canadian rates remains very
large. For example, Canada's 10 1/2% issue of June 1995
yields about 12.40%, while comparable U.S. Treasury notes
yield about 8.81%.</p>
<p>Municipals
</p>
<p>Prices of tax-exempt bonds were flat to off as much as 1/2
point yesterday.</p>
<p>Among active issues, New Jersey Turnpike Authority 7.20%
issue due 2018 fell 1/4 point to 97 1/8 bid to yield 7.42%.
Traders said the rout in the U.S. government bond market
helped depress municipal bonds.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>Japanese government bond prices rose, bolstered by the
yen's gain against the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>Traders also cited a decline in some short-term Japanese
interest rates as a factor in the bond rally. Japan's
benchmark bonds due in 1999 rose to 86.09 from 85.83 Tuesday.
Their yield fell to 7.345% from 7.39%. The price of the June
futures contract rose 0.18 to 93.55 to yield 7.103%.</p>
<p>In other major markets, British government bonds slumped.
Traders said inflation fears were fanned by news that power
workers plan to strike unless the government meets their
demands for double-digit wage increases. Britain's benchmark
bonds due 2003-2007 fell 14/32 point to 96 9/32 to yield
12.28%.</p>
<p>Mortgage-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Mortgage securities ended 13/32 to 17/32 lower as Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corp. and Federal National Mortgage
Association issues were supported by demand spurred by two
new derivative deals.</p>
<p>Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae 9 1/2% securities both fell
13/32.</p>
<p>Two Freddie Mac real estate mortgage investment conduit
securities totaling $800 million were announced yesterday.</p>
