	<p class="article-leader">Hytek Microsystems Inc. said its auditors expressed
reservations about the company's survival as a "going
concern." Separately, the maker of hybrid microcircuits said
it reached an agreement to sell the assets of its commercial
hybrid circuit-making operations at Los Gatos, Calif., and to
consolidate its remaining company functions at its Carson
City, Calif., military site.
   It declined to disclose terms. About 90 plant workers will
be affected by the sale: Some of those workers may be
re-employed at the Carson City plant, Hytek said. The company
currently has about 145 employees.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Hytek said the consolidation will free the company to
concentrate on its core business of manufacturing specialty
electronic circuits for military applications. The company
said that despite its auditor's opinion, the consolidation
and sale of assets should "provide the basis for a viable
entity."</p>
<p>For the year ended Dec. 30, 1989, Hytek posted a net loss
of $5.4 million, or $1.93 a share, on revenue of $9.5
million. In the year-earlier period, the company had a profit
of $518,000, or 18 cents a share, on revenue of $18.5
million.</p>
