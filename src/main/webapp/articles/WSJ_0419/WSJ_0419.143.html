	<p class="article-leader">Consolidated Rail Corp. blamed lower revenue plus
recapitalization costs for a steeper-than-expected 58% drop
in first-quarter earnings that sent the Philadelphia
company's stock tumbling.
   Conrail said net dropped to $25 million, or 43 cents a
share, from $60 million, or 88 cents a share, a year ago.
Revenue fell 5.6% to $823 million from $872 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Conrail closed yesterday at $43.25, down $1.625, in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Wall Street had been expecting a drop in Conrail's profit
because of lower traffic and a change in traffic mix. The
company had said that it carried higher volumes of
lower-revenue freight, such as coal, and lower volumes of
higher-revenue freight, such as autos.</p>
<p>But PaineWebber Inc. analyst Anthony Hatch noted that
while Conrail's operating profit came in about as expected,
the "other income" category showed expenses of $20 million --
far higher than the $4 million or so he had expected. A year
ago, the railroad had $7 million in other income.</p>
<p>A railroad spokesman attributed the $27 million swing to a
reduction in interest income of $6 million and an increase in
interest expenses of $8 million, both related to the
recapitalization. The quarter also included about $10 million
in litigation settlements, he said.</p>
