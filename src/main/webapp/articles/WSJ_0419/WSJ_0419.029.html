	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Occidental Petroleum Corp. posted a 61%
increase in first-quarter net income to $108 million, or 37
cents a share, from $67 million, or 24 cents a share, a year
earlier.
   Sales rose 2%, to $5.2 billion from $5.1 billion. The
results include extraordinary losses of $2 million, or one
cent a share, in the latest first quarter, and $9 million, or
three cents a share, in the year-earlier period from the
early extinguishment of debt.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Occidental closed at $27.125, unchanged.</p>
<p>The company had increased earnings in its oil and gas and
natural gas transmission divisions, offset by a $96 million
drop in earnings from chemical operations.</p>
<p>Profit from oil and gas operations rose to $100 million in
the quarter from $35 million a year earlier. That increase
reflected higher world-wide prices for crude oil and higher
domestic prices for natural gas and natural gas liquids, and
the resumption of production from the North Sea Claymore and
Scalpa fields after the explosion of the nearby Piper Alpha
oil platform in 1988. These gains were partially offset by
reduced domestic crude oil and natural gas volumes.</p>
<p>The latest first-quarter results included a $36 million
pretax gain from the settlement of a claim against Venezuela
for the 1975 nationalization of Occidental's commercial
block, a reduction in costs due to the restructuring last
year of domestic oil and gas operations, a $13 million pretax
write-off of certain receivables, and a $16 million benefit
from the reversal of certain income-tax reserves. Occidental
said the reversal of the tax reserves resulted from an
Internal Revenue Service audit of the company and certain
subsidiaries back to 1985 that determined the reserves are no
longer necessary.</p>
<p>Earnings from chemical operations fell to $186 million
from $282 million in the year-earlier quarter, reflecting
lower profit margins in petrochemicals and polymers and
plastics. Earnings in the latest quarter included a $14
million reversal of income tax reserves.</p>
<p>Natural gas transmission earnings rose to $94 million from
$61 million a year earlier, reflecting lower operating costs,
a rate refund and a $12 million tax benefit in the latest
period. Earnings from agribusiness operations, conducted by
Occidental's 51%-owned IBP Inc. subsidiary, rose to $14
million in the latest first quarter from $13 million the year
before. Earnings from coal operations rose to $4 million from
$3 million.</p>
<p>Among the unallocated corporate items in the year-earlier
first quarter was a $36 million pretax charge for a
charitable contribution to the Armand Hammer Museum of Art
and Cultural Center. The $95 million project has sparked
shareholder litigation, and the Delaware Chancery Court is
considering whether the outlay is appropriate.</p>
