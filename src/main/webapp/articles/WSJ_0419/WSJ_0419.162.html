	<p class="article-leader">Kenny Rogers, a mellow sort of fellow, this week finds
himself tangled in a decidedly unmellow dispute. Rolling
Stone magazine has named the bearded balladeer in its "Hall
of Shame" hit list of international environmental sinners.
The magazine also included the Journal's editorial page on
its roster -- a more predictable choice. But we were
surprised to find ourselves in such affable company. Rolling
Stone describes Mr. Rogers as an "ardent apologist for the
Los Angeles-based Summit Cement Company, which has sought to
dump toxic wastes from the U.S. mainland on Grand Bahama
Island." Rolling Stone says Mr. Rogers flew the Bahamian
health minister to Florida to help Summit.
   Wrong, says Kenny. He did fly ministers to Florida, but it
was because he was thinking of buying a hotel from the
Bahamian government. The singer is indeed a friend of
Summit's president, Finn Moller. But the only "help" Mr.
Rogers gave Mr. Moller was to aid him in investigating the
environmental safety of a plant Summit thought of buying on
Grand Bahama. In fact, charges Mr. Rogers, Rolling Stone only
heard about the matter because his own investigation was so
large.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Rogers is on a 70-city concert tour with Dolly Parton.
But during a break he spoke with Amity Shlaes of the
editorial page by phone from his farm in Athens, Ga.
Excerpts:</p>
<p>What did you feel when you saw your name in Rolling Stone?</p>
<p>This kind of thing really takes the wind out of your
sails. It makes you wonder why you do things in life.</p>
<p>What really hap pened with the ce ment plant in the
Bahamas?</p>
<p>At the start I was interested in re searching whether the
plant would be safe because I was thinking of investing {in
the Bahamas} myself. What I found was there are already 15
cement plants of this type operating legally in the United
States. They use hazardous waste not toxic waste {as Rolling
Stone asserts}. Every one of those {plants} wrote me positive
letters. Then I call Greenpeace in San Francisco. I say to
them as a joke: "I know that you guys are the shark in this
situation" -- meaning that they are the hardcore people who
can answer. The guy says "off the record, I'm sure the plant
is safe but I still can't approve."</p>
<p>What did he mean?</p>
<p>It appears some people would rather win than be right.</p>
<p>Why is it OK to build a plant that uses hazardous waste at
all?</p>
<p>I am a strange kind of guy. In the world there are very
few things that are black and white. In this case the
hazardous waste, a petroleum byproduct, is used to make a
product that is safe. {In general} something needs to be done
with hazardous waste. Until we find an alternative source,
what do you do with that waste? This seemed a good use.</p>
<p>Why do you think Greenpeace and Rolling Stone are picking
on you?</p>
<p>They jumped on the bandwagon and used me because I get
more press than anybody else.</p>
<p>What does Dolly think?</p>
<p>She has never mentioned it. We usually run into each other
only on stage.</p>
<p>Are you doing anything for Earth Day?</p>
<p>In my business you learn early that you have to pick your
causes. Mine are world hunger and the homeless. Every year I
host a weekend here at my farm to raise money for the
homeless.</p>
<p>Has environmentalism gone too far in America?</p>
<p>I have never been a person who admires extremists in any
field.</p>
<p>Robert Vare, the Rolling Stone editor who handled the
"Hall of Shame" section, says the magazine stands by its
report. Kenny Rogers never did buy the hotel on the Bahamas.
Finn Moller, the man who wanted to buy the cement plant, says
environmentalist roadblocks forced him to give up the
project, which would have brought 400 jobs to the
underemployed islands.</p>
<p>As someone once sang: You've got to know when to hold 'em,
know when to fold 'em.</p>
