	<p class="article-leader">T&N PLC said it extended the expiration date of its tender
offer to buy all the common stock of J.P. Industries Inc., an
Ann Arbour, Mich., automotive engine parts maker, after
regulators requested additional information.
   T&N, an English equipment manufacturer, began its tender
offer earlier this month, after J.P. Industries agreed to be
acquired by T&N for $190 million, or $17.30 a share, plus the
assumption of $185 million of debt.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The companies said the Federal Trade Commission has
requested additional information about the transaction under
the Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust law.</p>
<p>T&N said it will extend the offer until May 14. The tender
offer had been scheduled to expire April 26. As of Tuesday,
shareholders had tendered 505,747 shares, or about 5% of the
shares outstanding.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
J.P. Industries stock closed at $16.875 a share, unchanged.</p>
