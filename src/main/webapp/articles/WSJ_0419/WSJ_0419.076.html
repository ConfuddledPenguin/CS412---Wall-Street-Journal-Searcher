	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- Georgia-Pacific Corp. reported that
first-quarter earnings fell 34% because of higher interest
expense and lower prices for pulp and paper products.
   The forest-products concern said first-quarter net income
dropped to $101 million, or $1.18 a share, from $154 million,
or $1.65 a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 8.6% to $2.66
billion from $2.45 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The results were the first to include earnings from Great
Northern Kekoosa Corp., which Georgia-Pacific acquired in
March for $3.74 billion. Total cost of the purchase --
including fees and expenses related to the acquisition,
refinancing certain Georgia-Pacific debt and paying off
Nekoosa's debt -- was about $5 billion.</p>
<p>That acquisition pushed Georgia-Pacific's interest expense
in the first quarter to $97 million from $66 million a year
ago. At the same time, softer prices for pulp and paper
helped reduce first-quarter operating profits in that segment
to $182 million from $247 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>Analysts said the results were in line with expectations
and added that Georgia-Pacific should have little difficulty
meeting its new debt payments -- even considering a downturn
in pulp and paper. "The earnings from Nekoosa itself should
be able to cover the interest costs," said Gary Palmero,
paper and forest-products analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. in New
York. He still expects Georgia-Pacific to post 1989 earnings
of between $5 and $5.30 a share, compared with $7.42 a share
in 1989 for Georgia-Pacific alone.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Georgia-Pacific indicated that it is already
considering restructuring its debt -- a move that the company
estimated would save about $80 million a year in finance
costs. A spokeswoman declined to elaborate on how or when the
debt might be refinanced.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Georgia-Pacific closed at $40.75 a share, down 37.5 cents.</p>
