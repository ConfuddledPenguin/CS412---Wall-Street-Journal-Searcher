	<p class="article-leader">Many scholars have noted that the fascism of Hitler's
National Socialists resembled communism more than it did any
form of conservatism. Now the Czechs have linked communism
with fascism as a matter of law. Tomas Sokol, the Prague
public prosecutor, threatens to outlaw the Communist Party
under an existing statute prohibiting fascism. Mr. Sokol says
communism and Nazism are movements aimed at the "destruction
of all democratic rights" through "terror and social
demagoguery." East Europeans understand these ideologies,
having had to live under both.</p>
