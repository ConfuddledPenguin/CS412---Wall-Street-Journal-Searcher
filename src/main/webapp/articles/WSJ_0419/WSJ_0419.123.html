	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The House approved a bill designed to make
it easier for discount retailers to sue competing retailers
and manufacturers that conspire to fix prices.
   The legislation, passed 235-157, has prompted threats of a
presidential veto from senior Bush administration officials.
The Senate Judiciary Committee has passed a similar bill,
which is expected to face stiff Republican opposition when it
goes before the full Senate later this year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Proponents of the House legislation, led by Rep. Jack
Brooks (D., Texas), said it will facilitate lawsuits against
manufacturers and retailers that conspire to lock out
low-price retailers or to pressure discounters into raising
their prices. This illegal practice, known as resale price
maintenance, has become more prevalent because of lax federal
antitrust enforcement over the past nine years, according to
Mr. Brooks and his allies.</p>
<p>The Justice Department hasn't brought a resale price
maintenance case since the beginning of the Reagan
administration. The department's inaction has inhibited
private lawsuits, according to proponents of the bill.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court, in two decisions since 1984, has
increased the evidentiary burden on plaintiffs that claim to
be victims of manufacturer-retailer collusion. These
decisions, while not legalizing the practice, provided
considerable legal protection to defendants that conspire in
ways other than setting minimum prices, according to many
lawyers.</p>
<p>The House bill and its Senate counterpart would clarify
that resale price maintenance is always illegal. In addition,
the bills would overturn Supreme Court precedent by
establishing that even without collusion on a specific price,
a manufacturer can't agree with one retailer to terminate a
competing retailer's supply contract.</p>
<p>Consumer advocacy groups hailed House passage of the
legislation as a major victory. But the Justice Department
reiterated that it will urge President Bush to veto any such
bill that is sent to the White House. Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh has warned that the Brooks bill would interfere
with "the freedom of a manufacturer unilaterally to decide
whether or not to deal with a distributor, {which} is an
essential part of our free enterprise system."</p>
<p>The House approved an amendment to the Brooks bill that
would exclude retroactive application of certain aspects of
the legislation.</p>
