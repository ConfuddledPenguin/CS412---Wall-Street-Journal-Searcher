	<p class="article-leader">CUPERTINO, Calif. -- Apple Computer Inc. said fiscal
second-quarter profit surged 134% as a result of improved
gross margins, brisk sales of new products and robust foreign
sales.
   The company posted net income of $131.8 million, or $1.04
a share, for the quarter ended March 31, up from $56.4
million, or 44 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue climbed
8% to $1.35 billion from $1.25 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the six months, Apple said net spurted 30% to $256.7
million, or $2 a share, from $196.8 million, or $1.54 a
share, the year earlier. Revenue rose 7% to $2.84 billion
from $2.65 billion.</p>
<p>Analysts said they were expecting a strong quarter from
Apple but that the results exceeded even those expectations.
The key appears to have been Apple's ability to wrench its
profit margins up to a "spectacular 55%, which has to be a
record or a near record," said Steven Ossad , a computer
analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco.</p>
<p>The good news, however, was tempered by Apple's forecast,
delivered to analysts during a conference call on Wednesday,
that its profit margins would fall from those elevated levels
in the second half of fiscal 1990.</p>
<p>The company also told analysts that it expects combined
second half domestic and international growth rates to be a
modest 7% to 10%. Indeed, despite the second-quarter showing,
Apple's stock closed unchanged at $43.25 a share yesterday on
volume of 1.7 million shares in national over-the-counter
trading.</p>
<p>Apple said its results were greatly aided by record
international sales, which totaled 47% of all sales for the
quarter, which also set a record. Apple attributed the
increase to aggressive overseas marketing efforts coupled
with "the relatively higher growth rates the industry is
experiencing in markets outside the United States."</p>
<p>Indeed, Apple said that while it remains "cautious" about
growth in the U.S. computer industry in coming quarters, "we
are optimistic regarding the level of international demand."</p>
<p>Apple said profit also received a boost from improved
margins on its computer products, stemming from lower parts
costs and a more effective program of managing operating
expenses.</p>
<p>The company added that results were aided by brisk sales
of upgraded models of its mid- and high-end Macintosh
computer introduced last year. The machines, notably the
Macintosh FE 30, 2ci and 2cx, retail between about $3,800 to
$8,600 depending upon the configuration.</p>
