	<h3>International: Seized Giant Pipes Bound for Iraq Were for a Big Gun, Britain Says</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- The British government said steel tubes seized
last week by customs officials were components of a mammoth
gun bound for Iraq.
   But experts remain puzzled by the actual workings of such
a weapon, which would be five times larger than any known gun
in the arsenal of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or
the Warsaw Pact. Iraqi officials insist that the
controversial piping is intended for a petrochemical project,
and Sheffield Forgemasters, the British manufacturer of the
tubes, said it wasn't aware of the material's alleged
military use when it took the order.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the first high-level acknowledgment of the pipes'
military potential, Trade and Industry Secretary Nicholas
Ridley told the House of Commons that the eight steel tubes
were "consistent" with designs by murdered international arms
dealer and weapons designer Gerald Bull. Because of that, the
trade secretary added, he was now "entirely satisfied" that
the pipes were part of a gun.</p>
<p>Mr. Bull, a Canadian-born American regarded by arms
experts as a ballistics genius, was shot to death outside his
Brussels apartment March 22, apparently in a professional
hit. Sheffield Forgemasters said Mr. Bull's Brussels-based
company, Space Research Corp., had acted for the Iraqi
Ministry of Trade in arranging the contract for the pipes and
provided technical drawings for the production of the parts.</p>
<p>"If it wasn't for the involvement of Gerald Bull, one
would have dismissed out of hand the possibility that these
tubes could be gun parts," said Michael Dewar, deputy
director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies
in London.</p>
<p>Experts believe that the 132-feet-long pipes, which have a
bore of almost 40 inches, could be pieced together to form
the barrel of a gun capable of lobbing chemical or nuclear
shells several hundred miles. There has even been speculation
that the powerful weapon could boost satellites into earth
orbit.</p>
<p>Though huge guns were developed by the British and Germans
in World War II, they proved inaccurate and unwieldy. Experts
say Mr. Bull's research on shells that shed part of their
bulk and weight after firing and his work on in-flight
boosters might have made such a weapon feasible. "But we here
at the institute don't know how such a weapon would work, and
I don't think anyone else does either," said Mr. Dewar. Other
strategic and armament experts in the United Kingdom agreed.</p>
<p>The steel tubes, seized last Thursday at a port in
northeastern England, were the last of a 52-pipe order; the
other 44 were shipped to Iraq's Ministry of Industry and
Minerals. But British trade secretary Ridley said Iraq can't
complete the weapon without the seized pipes. "Let me make it
absolutely clear that the gun itself cannot be in operations
without all its parts," he told the Commons, "and it is a
great success on the behalf of this country to have been able
to prevent that happening."</p>
<p>Mr. Ridley said his department had received a request in
1988 from Forgemasters asking if permits were needed to
export tubes to Iraq for use in the petrochemical industry. A
Birmingham company, Walter Somers Ltd., also queried the
government about an Iraqi order for specialized pipeline
equipment.</p>
<p>"Until a few days ago, my department had no knowledge that
the goods were designed to form part of a gun," Mr. Ridley
said. "If my department had known that purpose, they would,
of course, have advised that licenses were necessary, and
they would not have been granted."</p>
<p>Walter Somers, a subsidiary of Eagle Trust PLC, said it
may have been duped by the Iraqis into producing gun parts.
The hydraulic equipment was shipped to Iraq in October and
could have been part of a giant shock absorber, or recoil
mechanism, for a weapon.</p>
<p>The company also received an urgent order earlier this
month to make a "positioning or aiming" mechanism that
"allows for a very substantial pipe-like device to be swung
through a 60-degree angle," according to Eagle Trust Chairman
David James. He added that "none of us have ever heard of an
oil pipe which requires a lateral movement of 60 degrees."
The company told the Iraqis it didn't have the capacity to
build the device and shared its suspicions with the British
Department of Trade and Industry.</p>
<p>There have also been reports that Iraq contacted a Belgian
defense company, PRB, to help produce a shell for the alleged
gun. PRB is owned by British munitions company Astra Holdings
PLC.</p>
<p>The gun controversy has worsened the already-strained
relations between Britain and Iraq. Last month, the Iraqis
hanged a London-based journalist whom they accused of spying.
In March, British customs seized parts for nuclear-bomb
triggers, bound for Iraq, and arrested five people. One was
deported, one released, and three await trial.</p>
<p>Asked about the latest allegations on Wednesday, Iraq's
deputy foreign minister, Nizar Hamdoon, pointed out in a
telephone interview from Baghdad that his country already has
long-range missiles and a powerful air force and has recently
launched a space rocket. "What's the need for that gun?" he
asked.</p>
<p>He also termed "ridiculous" the speculation of arms
experts that such a gun could launch satellites.</p>
