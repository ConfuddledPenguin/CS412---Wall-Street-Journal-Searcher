	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The U.S. persuaded Allied-Signal Inc. to
withdraw a trade complaint against Japan, at least
temporarily, while the two countries seek to negotiate a
solution.
   At issue are complaints by the U.S. company that Japan
restricts imports of amorphous metals, a high-technology
product used in electric-power transmission equipment. The
Bush administration's decision to negotiate the issue with
Tokyo, rather than launch a formal trade investigation that
could lead to retaliation, signals the administration's
intent to reduce the heat of the current trade dialogue with
Japan. U.S. officials said the Bush administration doesn't
want to give Japan a black eye so soon after that country
agreed to trade concessions in so-called structural
impediments talks with the U.S.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Although Carla Hills, the U.S. trade representative, said
nothing about other U.S. trade complaints awaiting action,
the tone of her announcement suggested that the White House
is considering nonconfrontational solutions for them, as
well. At the end of this month, Mrs. Hills has to determine
whether to list Japan as an unfair trading partner under the
"Super 301" provision of the 1988 trade act.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hills said that if bilateral negotiations aren't
successful in resolving the amorphous metals dispute within
150 days, the U.S. will invite Allied-Signal to resubmit its
petition for prompt action.</p>
<p>In Morris Township, N.J., Edward L. Hennessy Jr.,
Allied-Signal's chairman and chief executive officer, said
the company will cooperate with Mrs. Hills. "The recently
announced progress in the trade talks between the U.S. and
Japan holds out the promise that trade issues between the two
nations can be resolved in a more businesslike and less
confrontational manner," he said. "We hope that
Allied-Signal's case will demonstrate that this process
works."</p>
<p>Allied-Signal filed the trade complaint March 5, alleging
that Japan "has engaged in practices aimed at excluding sales
of U.S. amorphous metals." The U.S. company also charged that
Tokyo has blocked attempts to license technology to Japanese
companies. Mrs. Hills was required under the 1988 trade act
to accept or reject the complaint by today.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hills has used similar tactics to deal with trade
complaints from other U.S. industries. For example, this past
summer the Shipbuilders Council of America, an industry
group, withdrew a trade complaint about government subsidies
to commercial shipbuilders in South Korea, Japan, West
Germany and Norway after Mrs. Hills promised that the U.S.
would seek to negotiate a broad international agreement to
restrict and eventually eliminate such subsidies.</p>
<p>The U.S. negotiations with South Korea and member
countries of the Paris-based Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development on shipyard subsidies haven't
been concluded, although U.S. officials say they are making
progress and the talks should be completed next month.</p>
<p>In its petition, Allied-Signal charged that Japanese
government agencies and businesses worked in concert to keep
the company's amorphous metals out of the Japanese market
while domestic producers tried to develop an equivalent
product. Amorphous metals are used primarily to improve the
efficiency of electrical transmission and have a world market
estimated at about $1 billion a year.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hills's action drew a cautious reaction from
Congress. Rep. Helen Bentley (R., Md.) said the move was a
"Solomon-like decision." But Sen. John Danforth (R., Mo.)
warned that the administration could be "falling into a
pattern of sidestepping U.S. trade law." He stressed that the
"bottom line has to be results in the form of exports for a
U.S. firm that is being shut out by Japan."</p>
