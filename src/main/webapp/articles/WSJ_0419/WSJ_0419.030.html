member nations of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries edged up to 23.8 million barrels a day in March
from 23.7 million barrels in February, an AP-Dow Jones survey
of oil market participants indicated.
   The survey of integrated oil companies, independent
refiners and oil industry consultants also suggests that OPEC
members in March produced an average of 1.7 million barrels a
day of natural gas liquids, which are light liquid
hydrocarbons generally found with natural gas deposits; this
was unchanged from February.</p>
