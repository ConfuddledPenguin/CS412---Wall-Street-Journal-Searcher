	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Capital Cities/ABC Inc. reported first-quarter
net income climbed 28% as revenue rose 13% on the strength of
a 15% increase in its broadcast operations revenue.
   The broadcasting and publishing company posted net of
$106.3 million, or $6.08 a share, up from $82.7 million, or
$4.59 a share, a year earlier. Revenue grew to $1.26 billion
from $1.12 billion. Broadcasting operating profit rose to
$200.5 million from $148.7 million, but publishing operating
profit eased to $24.3 million from $24.8 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Revenue at the broadcast division, consisting of the
network and eight TV stations, advanced to $992.5 million
from $865.6 million, primarily because of strong advertising
demand and healthy ratings, except for its daytime schedule.</p>
<p>Publishing revenue increased to $269.8 million from $254.9
million. The division consists of nine daily newspapers and
weeklies as well as shopping guides and specialty magazines.</p>
<p>Dennis McAlpine, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Co., said
one reason Capital Cities/ABC performed so well was that its
TV network, despite its second-place showing in the ratings,
continues to be demographically attractive to advertisers.</p>
<p>"Unlike NBC, ABC hasn't had to do make-goods," he said,
referring to the industry practice of giving free commercial
time to advertisers when a show doesn't deliver the audience
size guaranteed to the sponsor.</p>
<p>Mr. McAlpine said he anticipated a weak so-called up-front
market -- when ads are sold in advance of the 1990-91 TV
season. Despite that, Mr. McAlpine said, "ABC is in the best
position of any network." As previously reported, ABC
finished the 30-week 1989-90 prime-time season, which ended
Sunday, in second place, behind General Electric Co.'s
National Broadcasting Co. and ahead of CBS Inc.'s TV network.</p>
<p>But ABC had the season's only hits of the three major
networks: "America's Funniest Home Videos" and "Twin Peaks."
The only other hit is "The Simpsons" on Fox Broadcasting Co.,
a subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Capital Cities/ABC closed at $539.375 a share, down $7.125.</p>
