	<p class="article-leader">SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- McClatchy Newspapers Inc. said a
sharp drop in advertising linage in March helped drive down
first-quarter earnings by 51% to $2.4 million, or eight cents
a share. The newspaper chain earned $4.85 million, or 17
cents a share, the year earlier. Revenue grew 9% to $95.1
million from $87 million.
   McClatchy added that results were hurt by startup costs
associated with a newsprint mill partnership, and costs
associated with the recent acquisition of six newspapers in
South Carolina.</p>
