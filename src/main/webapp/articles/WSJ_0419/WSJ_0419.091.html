	<p class="article-leader">Yields on both money-market mutual funds and bank
certificates of deposit were little changed in the latest
week.
   The average seven-day compound yield on taxable money
funds remained at 7.99%, according to IBC/Donoghue's Money
Fund Report, a Holliston, Mass.based newsletter. The average
yield on a small-denomination six-month CD stayed at 7.80%,
according to Banxquote Money Markets, a New York information
service. Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yields on tax-free money funds rose, however.</p>
<p>Assets of the 427 taxable money funds tracked by
Donoghue's fell by about $1.5 billion in the week ended
Tuesday, the third consecutive weekly decline. Brenda Malizia
Negus, editor of the newsletter, attributed the latest drop
in part to redemptions for tax purposes.</p>
<p>Average maturity of the funds' investments shortened by a
day to 44 days, staying within the range of the past few
months. Maturities are thought to indicate which way
portfolio managers think interest rates are headed, with
shorter maturities signaling rising rates and longer
maturities indicating a decline. Average maturity has ranged
from 29 to 53 days in recent years.</p>
<p>The average seven-day simple yield remained at 7.69%. The
average 30-day simple yield stayed at 7.68% and the average
30-day compound yield at 7.98%.</p>
<p>The average seven-day compound yield on tax-free funds
rose to 5.63% from 5.57%, Donoghue's reported. That's equal
to 7.82% for an investor in the 28% tax bracket and 8.40% in
the 33% bracket.</p>
<p>Assets of the 220 tax-free funds tracked by Donoghue's
fell by $1.3 billion, to $77.5 billion. Average maturity
shortened to 45 days from 46.</p>
<p>The only measurable change in CD yields in the week ended
yesterday was in long-term "jumbo" CDs, which generally
require deposits of at least $90,000. The average yield on
five-year jumbos rose to 8.38% from 8.33%, according to
Banxquote. That increase was led by New York's Chase
Manhattan Bank, which boosted its five-year jumbo yield to
8.86% from 8.55% early last week.</p>
<p>That sharp rise could portend other increases, said
Norberto Mehl, chairman of Banxquote. "When a major bank
suddenly pushes a rate up strongly, it points to a new
trend," he said.</p>
<p>The average yield on popular one-year small-denomination
CDs, which generally require minimum deposits of $10,000 or
less, slipped to 7.95% from 7.96%. Fiveyear
small-denomination CD yields remained at an average 8.16%.</p>

<p>Portfolio Changes</p>
<p>Some money funds are moving to improve the credit quality
of their investments, after two instances when several funds'
investment advisers had to step in to avert possible
shareholder losses.</p>
<p>T. Rowe Price Associates' $4.9 billion Prime Reserve money
fund, for instance, has reduced its commercial paper holdings
and increased its investments in government and agency
securities. The fund also has reduced its holdings of
commercial paper that doesn't carry the very highest credit
ratings, said Steven Norwitz, a T. Rowe Price vice president.</p>
<p>Heritage Cash Trust has been upgrading its portfolio since
last year, said Stephen Hill, president of Heritage Asset
Management, the fund's investment adviser. Only 10% of the
fund's approximately $700 million in assets is currently in
paper that is below the highest grade, he said, and more than
10% is in Treasury bills.</p>
<p>The two funds were among 10 moneymarket mutual funds
holding the commercial paper, or short-term corporate IOUs,
of Mortgage & Realty Trust, an Elkins Park, Pa., real estate
investment trust that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law
protection last week, a month after its commercial paper was
downgraded by Standard & Poor's Corp.</p>
<p>All together, the investment advisers or parent companies
bought a total of about $75 million of the paper from the
funds to protect shareholders. Among others, Prime Reserve
held about $42 million of the paper, Heritage Cash Trust
about $12 million and Alliance Money Reserves $8.7 million.
"We consider it of paramount importance to retain investor
confidence," said Mr. Norwitz of T. Rowe Price. Any loss will
be absorbed by the parent company.</p>
<p>There was similar fast action last spring, when the
parents of four money funds stepped in to absorb the loss
after Integrated Resources Inc. defaulted on commercial
paper. Integrated Resources also subsequently filed for
Chapter 11 protection.</p>
<p>As previously reported, the Securities and Exchange
Commission is considering tighter restrictions on investments
by money-market mutual funds. The SEC's division of
investment management is planning to propose further limits
on the amount a fund can invest in a single issuer,
restrictions on its investments in less than the very highest
rated commercial paper and shortening the permissible average
maturity of a fund's investments.</p>
<p>More than half the nearly $400 billion in money fund
assets currently is invested in commercial paper. That's up
from 44% at the start of 1989 and 29% at the start of 1984.
The SEC already limits money funds' investments to highly
rated securities.</p>
