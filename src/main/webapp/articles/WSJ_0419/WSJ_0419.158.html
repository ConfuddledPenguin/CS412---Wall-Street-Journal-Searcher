	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and his
ruling Conservative Party have fallen to a record low in
public opinion polls because of voter grumpiness over issues
ranging from taxes to turbans.
   Fewer than one in six Canadians who state a preference now
support the Conservatives, according to the polls.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>No governing party has ranked so low in Canada since the
Gallup Organization started polling Canadians on their
political party preferences in 1941. But the ruling
conservatives hope to bounce back before the next election
must be held, which by law is by the autumn of 1993.</p>
<p>Political analysts say the Conservatives' unpopularity
could deter the government from taking further tough action
to deal with the country's economic problems, including the
government's big budget deficit.</p>
<p>"The mood in the country is pretty sour," said Angus Reid,
president of Angus Reid Associates Inc., an opinion
researcher.</p>
<p>President Bush observed the anti-Mulroney sentiment first
hand last week when he and Mr. Mulroney attended the Toronto
Blue Jays home opener against the Texas Rangers. When Mr.
Mulroney stepped onto the field for the ceremonial first
pitch, the big SkyDome stadium crowd booed loudly.</p>
<p>Canadians are particularly upset over the government's
plan to introduce a 7% consumption tax Jan. 1 to replace a
more narrowly based manufacturers sales tax.</p>
<p>Mr. Mulroney's government also is taking much of the blame
for a constitutional dispute that has rekindled fears about
Quebec's breaking away from the rest of Canada. The dispute
concerns a proposed amendment that would give increased
powers to the provinces and recognize largely French-speaking
Quebec as a "distinct society" within Canada.</p>
<p>Canadians also are distressed over Canada's high interest
rates and pessimistic about Canada's economic prospects.
Short-term Canadian rates are more than five percentage
points above comparable U.S. rates.</p>
<p>In addition, some Canadians have objected strongly to
recent government decisions to shut down much of the
country's unprofitable passenger rail services and to relax
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police dress code to permit
mounties of Sikh faith to wear turbans.</p>
<p>Mr. Mulroney is sticking to his unpopular measures,
including the planned consumption tax, which has been passed
by the House of Commons but still needs to be approved by the
Senate.</p>
<p>"Doing what is right for the nation often times means
doing things that are difficult and unpopular," he told the
House of Commons.</p>
<p>Two Conservative members of Parliament were expelled from
the party caucus last week for voting against the consumption
tax. But caucus solidarity remains basically strong, mainly
because of fears that party squabbling would soon lead to the
government's defeat.</p>
<p>"Mr. Mulroney has clearly established his authority over
the party caucus as no other Conservative leader has done in
a generation," said George Perlin, a Queen's University
political scientist.</p>
<p>Dalton Camp, a former senior adviser to Mr. Mulroney's
cabinet, said that while Mr. Mulroney's leadership of his
caucus "continues to be masterful," the prime minister "has
only a tenuous grip on his party beyond Parliament Hill."</p>
<p>Voter unhappiness is strongest in western Canada,
particularly the traditional Conservative stronghold of
Alberta. Many Albertans have switched to a new right-wing
party, the Reform Party, which had the support of almost a
third of the province's voters in a recent poll.</p>
<p>Many Tory members of Parliament believe the Conservative
Party's current problems will fade away by the autumn of 1993
and the party will be able to repeat its feat of 1988 when it
bounced back from a slump to win re-election.</p>
<p>The Conservatives have some grounds for their hopes, said
Mr. Reid. He predicted the consumption tax will be less
contentious a year from now and by election time the economy
should be healthier.</p>
<p>But to get re-elected the Conservatives will need another
big issue like Canada's 15-month-old free trade pact with the
U.S., Mr. Perlin said. The trade pact, which was supported by
a majority of Canadians, was the main issue in the 1988
election.</p>
<p>The Conservatives are expected to be able to counterattack
more effectively against their critics after the opposition
Liberal Party, at a June 23 convention, picks a new leader to
succeed John Turner, who is retiring. The new Liberal leader
will give the Conservatives a focus for their attacks on
Liberal policies. Jean Chretien, a minister in former Prime
Minister Pierre Trudeau's government, is heavily favored to
win the Liberal leadership.</p>
