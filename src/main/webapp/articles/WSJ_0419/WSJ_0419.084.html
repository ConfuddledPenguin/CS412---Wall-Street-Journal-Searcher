	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- Norton Co. brought a new legal challenge to a
$1.64 billion takeover bid by BTR PLC, arguing that
shareholders who have accepted the bid shouldn't be able to
vote at Norton's annual meeting.
   BTR is trying to oust Norton directors at the company's
annual meeting next Thursday in order to force Norton, an
abrasives company based in Worcester, Mass., to accept the
bid. Holders of more than 62% of Norton have already tendered
their shares to BTR.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a claim filed in federal court yesterday, Norton said
those shares shouldn't be allowed to be voted at the meeting
because BTR has already acquired them under a 1988
Massachusetts anti-takeover law without complying with other
provisions of the same law.</p>
<p>A lawyer for BTR called the lawsuit "totally frivolous."
Takeover stock traders were also skeptical of the lawsuit.
Although Norton stock fell 62.5 cents to $75.375 a share in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, its price
still remained above the $75 BTR bid.</p>
<p>The stock fell after Massachusetts Governor Michael
Dukakis signed a new state law allowing companies to impose
staggered terms for directors, with one-third elected every
year, which could delay BTR's acquisition. However, a federal
appeals court upheld an earlier federal court decision
blocking Norton's attempt to delay its annual meeting until
June.</p>
