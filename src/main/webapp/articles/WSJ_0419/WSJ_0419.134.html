	<p class="article-leader">Ashton-Tate Corp., Torrance, Calif., said it posted a
first-quarter loss of $1 million, or four cents a share, as
revenue plummeted 37% to $57 million. The company cited
continuing slumping sales resulting from delays in the
introduction of its upgraded version of dBASE IV, a computer
spreadsheet program.
   In the year-earlier quarter, the software maker had a
profit of $11.5 million, or 44 cents a share, on revenue of
$89.8 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The results had been expected. The firm in 1989 had a loss
of $28.7 million largely because of glitches in developing
the dBASE upgrade. Ashton-Tate said it still can't give a
delivery date for the upgrade, which many analysts had hoped
would be ready during the 1990 first quarter.</p>
<p>"Many customers have delayed their purchases of dBASE IV
in anticipation of the shipment of the new version,"
Ashton-Tate said. It said it believes "this trend will
continue" until shipment of the updated version.</p>
