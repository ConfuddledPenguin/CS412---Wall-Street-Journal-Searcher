	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Southmark Corp.'s creditors' committee has asked
a federal bankruptcy judge to allow it to sue the company's
former top two executives to recover more than $83 million in
assets.
   In a filing with the court, the committee said it asked to
file an adversary proceeding against Gene E. Phillips, former
Southmark chairman; William S. Friedman, former vice
chairman, and companies they control to recover funds and
assets on behalf of Southmark.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The creditors contend that the assets were fraudulently
conveyed to Messrs. Phillips and Friedman as part of
settlements with Southmark in January and July 1989, when the
real estate and thrift concern already was insolvent.</p>
<p>In the proposed complaint, the creditors committee argues
that Southmark gave up at least $82 million in actual assets
in those two settlements while receiving less than $14
million in return. A hearing on the request is scheduled for
May 16.</p>
<p>The settlements stem from an arrangement under which Mr.
Phillips and Mr. Friedman would resign their positions at
Southmark. Among other things, the agreements called for
Southmark to swap its stock in several affiliates and release
the executives from personal guarantees on a costly real
estate project in exchange for mortgages and release from its
own guarantees on other assets.</p>
<p>Messrs. Phillips and Friedman have contended that the
agreements were fairly negotiated transactions that should be
allowed to stand. In an interview yesterday, Mr. Friedman
said he hasn't seen the complaint, but said: "We're very
happy to have an opportunity in a fair and unbiased forum to
present what actually happened in these transactions."</p>
<p>Separately, Southmark said it reached an agreement with
its equity holders committee calling for holders of its
preferred and common stock to receive 11% of the stock in
reorganized company, up from about 5%.</p>
