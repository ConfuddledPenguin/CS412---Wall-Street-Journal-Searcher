	<p class="article-leader">HAVANA, Cuba -- Cuba and the Soviet Union signed a
one-year trade pact valued at $14.7 billion and set up a
special committee to discuss future trade relations.
   The agreement calls for an exchange of Soviet oil,
cereals, food, equipment and other goods for Cuban sugar,
nickel, chrome, citrus and, for the first time, Cuban-made
medicine and medical equipment. AIN, the domestic Cuban news
agency, said the value of the pact was 8.7% higher than last
year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A special committee was set up to study future economic
ties, which the Soviets say they want to make more efficient.
Soviet officials say a new economic cooperation accord will
be shorter than five years, probably two years, and will take
into account Soviet economic reforms. About 80% of Cuba's
trade is with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Western diplomats say the changes could affect the price
Moscow is willing to pay for Cuban sugar in the future. The
Soviets currently pay well over the world market price for
sugar and in return sell Cuba oil at subsidized rates.</p>
