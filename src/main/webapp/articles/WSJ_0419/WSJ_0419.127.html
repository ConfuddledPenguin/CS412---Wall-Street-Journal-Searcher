	<p class="article-leader">Brierley Investments Ltd. said it applied to New Zealand's
Commerce Commission to acquire a majority interest in Telecom
Corp., the state-owned monopoly telephone company that the
government plans to sell to reduce debt.
   Bob Matthew, chief executive officer of Brierley, said the
company's bid for Telecom may involve foreign partners.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"While Brierley Investments may well seek in its own right
to acquire a significant shareholding in Telecom, we are also
having discussions with a number of overseas parties who have
a genuine interest in investing in Telecom," he said.</p>
<p>Earlier Wednesday the government said it has accepted a
number of parties as suitable potential bidders for shares in
Telecom, and will be giving them special access to
information about Telecom to help in valuations of the
company.</p>
<p>But the government said it won't be identifying any of the
potential bidders or detailing the timing of the sale
process.</p>
<p>Foreign buyers will be restricted to 49.9% of Telecom
shares.</p>
