	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- Debt burdened retailers are giving
McKesson Corp. a big headache.
   Stock of the drug distribution giant plunged $2.25 to
$34.375 yesterday following an announcement that it was
taking a sizable charge against fiscal fourth-quarter
earnings because some of its highly leveraged retail
customers had fallen behind on their bills.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>McKesson declined to give a dollar figure for the
reserves. But the company said the charge would depress
earnings for the quarter ended March 31 "significantly" below
the $25.4 million, or 59 cents a share, it earned in the
year-earlier period. McKesson also said full fiscal-year
profit would be down "modestly" from year-earlier levels,
when it posted a profit of $100.6 million, or $2.28 a share.</p>
<p>One analyst estimated the charge at between $10 million
and $15 million and said that while McKesson had forecast
problems with its accounts receivables, the size of the
reserves came as something of a surprise.</p>
<p>"We expected McKesson to take a charge but weren't
thinking of anything this large," said David Keuler of Blunt,
Ellis & Loew, a Milwaukee research concern. On the "positive
side, we think McKesson has pretty much taken all of the
reserves it's going to need" to cover the problem bills, Mr.
Keuler added.</p>
<p>McKesson said it decided to take the charge against
earnings after a two-month credit review showed that some of
its retail customers had "employed excessive leverage in
recent years and are using their suppliers to supplement
their bank credit lines." McKesson declined to name the
retailers but analysts said they likely include a big East
Coast department store chain as well as a nationwide chain of
convenience stores that carry McKesson products.</p>
<p>"Given the narrow margins inherent in the distribution
business, the risk-reward ratio for McKesson to act as an
unsecured creditor in those situations is not consistent with
prudent business practices," the company said.</p>
<p>The negative stock market reaction to McKesson wasn't
helped any by a separate announcement that fiscal
fourth-quarter earnings for its 83%-owned Armor All Products
unit would be "disappointing." McKesson declined to elaborate
but analysts said results of the car-care products subsidiary
would likely be negatively affected by a recent change in
accounting for marketing costs, a change in buying habits of
automobile-care retailers and by a general slowdown in sales
of Armor All products.</p>
<p>"Growth in Armor All is kind of slow," said Mr. Kueler of
Blunt, Ellis. "Cars these days are being built with better
finishes, which means people don't need as many products as
they used to."</p>
