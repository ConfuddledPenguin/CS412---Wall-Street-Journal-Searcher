	<p class="article-leader">BERN, Switzerland -- Switzerland's trade deficit in March
narrowed to 775 million francs ($520.3 million) from a
revised gap of 827 million francs in February and from a
deficit of 993 million francs a year earlier, the government
said.
   For the first three months of this year, the trade gap
widened to 2.8 billion francs from 2.5 billion francs a year
earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Last month, imports surged to 9.2 billion francs from 8.2
billion francs in February and from 8.2 billion francs in
March 1989. Exports expanded strongly to 8.4 billion francs
last month from 7.4 billion francs in February and from 7.2
billion francs a year earlier. The continued export boom has
worried the Swiss National Bank because of the inflationary
implications of an overheated economy.</p>
<p>For the year through March, imports totaled 25.4 billion
francs, up from 22.3 billion francs a year earlier, and
exports increased to 22.57 billion francs from 19.7 billion
francs.</p>
