	<p class="article-leader">The Comptroller of the Currency directed Bank of New
England Corp.'s Connecticut Bank & Trust Co. subsidiary to
tighten its lending policies and management oversight in a
consent cease-and-desist order.
   The Comptroller also cited a violation of law applicable
to the bank, but the Treasury Department office declined to
give further details.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Bank of New England is already operating under a similar
order, and the Connecticut order was expected. Its provisions
include a requirement that the bank maintain an equity
capital-to-total assets ratio of at least 3% and develop a
timetable through 1991 to achieve and maintain a ratio of at
least 5%.</p>
<p>In a statement, Connecticut Bank & Trust called the plans
and procedures outlined in the order "sound measures that any
bank should follow" and said that "many of the changes called
for are already under way."</p>
