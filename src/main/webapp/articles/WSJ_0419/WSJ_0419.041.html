	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Dun & Bradstreet Corp.'s first-quarter profit
fell 23%, reflecting the biggest shock yet to earnings from a
year-old controversy surrounding sales practices in the
company's credit services operations.
   The information company also cited the impact of an
expired contract on its Donnelley Directory operations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Separately, directors declared a 6% increase in the
quarterly dividend to 53 cents a share from 50 cents, payable
June 8 to stock of record May 18.</p>
<p>Financial analysts said they expected the results, which
the company had been clearly signaling. Yesterday, Dun &
Bradstreet reiterated a forecast of 1990 per-share earnings
of about $2.80, indicating an 11% decline from 1989's $3.14 a
share.</p>
<p>In the quarter, net income totaled $110.3 million, or 60
cents a share, down from $143.3 million, or 77 cents a share,
the year earlier. Revenue rose 8.5% to $1.15 billion from
$1.1 billion. The company noted, however, that the gain was
only 4% after adjusting for the acquisition of Management
Science America, a software concern, and the divestiture of
Thomas Cook Travel.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, D&B closed unchanged at $47.125 a share, down 12.5
cents.</p>
<p>The earnings drop "was due in part to a decrease in
revenue at U.S. Credit Services and substantial increase in
costs" to revamp the operations, the company said. The
company added that world-wide revenue for credit services
declined, largely because of a "high-single-digit" drop in
first-quarter revenue of U.S. credit services. A spokesman
declined to elaborate.</p>
<p>Last year, many customers accused Dun & Bradstreet
salespeople of misleading them to buy far more credit
services than the company knew were needed. The company has
conceded that, in some cases, customers were abused. In
addition, without admitting any wrongdoing, the company
reached an $18 million agreement to settle five major
lawsuits that similarly alleged customers were oversold
services through deceit. As part of the settlement, the
company agreed to modify its business practices in several
important respects. And it was those changes that accounted
for substantial cost increases in the credit services
business.</p>
<p>In the wake of the controversy, sales growth of credit
services has been weak, but Dun & Bradstreet's profit had
continued to increase until the first quarter.</p>
<p>Dun & Bradstreet revenue for its directory information
services fell 21% to $90.3 million from $114.3 million the
year earlier because of the absence of revenue from a
Donnelley directory contract and the timing of revenue from
yellow pages directories.</p>
<p>In other highlights, the company said, revenue grew 12% in
marketing information services, 5.8% in financial information
services and 30% in business services.</p>
