	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Nothing has better symbolized Britain's
rekindled entrepreneurial energy in recent times than Carlton
Communications PLC.
   Now, Carlton is facing its own energy crisis, as
yesterday's tumble in its stock price showed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A rapid-fire series of acquisitions -- capped by its
purchases of Technicolor Holdings Inc. from Ronald Perelman
in 1988 and UEI PLC last year for $1.5 billion -- has made
the once-tiny London television-production company a major
force in the world video market. It duplicates more
videotapes than anyone else. Its high-tech graphics machines
set industry standards. Its Zenith unit, 49%-owned by
Paramount Communications Inc., makes TV programs with such
stars as Michelle Pfeiffer and Tina Turner seen in 30
countries.</p>
<p>Led by its chairman and chief executive officer, Michael
Green, Carlton's pretax profits have risen nearly tenfold in
five years. And at its height last year, the company's #1.7
billion ($2.79 billion) market capitalization exceeded
Saatchi & Saatchi PLC, a previous highflier whose founders
are friends of Mr. Green.</p>
<p>But suddenly, like Saatchi, Carlton appears to have lost
its hustle. A vague warning from Mr. Green of slower profits
growth this fiscal year, ending Sept. 30, has contributed to
a big fall in the company's share price. On the London Stock
Exchange, Carlton dropped 43 pence a share yesterday to close
at 481 pence, off about 49% from last year's highs. American
depositary receipts, in national over-the-counter trading,
plunged $1.75 a share to close at $15.125.</p>
<p>Now, holders fear the stock may tread water until June,
when the company posts first-half results, and beyond. The
performance raises some discomforting questions about
Carlton's operations and strategy. There are even whispers
that unless it pulls out of the slump, the much-feared
acquirer could one day be a target itself.</p>
<p>Acquisitive Carlton's price-earnings ratio -- whose lofty
heights allowed the company to finance acquisitions through
share issues -- now has plunged to below the U.K. average.
That hampers Carlton's ability to finance acquisitions by
issuing shares, and is a setback to Mr. Green's aims to make
Carlton big enough to compete against such rivals as Sony
Corp. Carlton has recently been courting the U.K.'s Thames
Television, which it tried to buy in 1985.</p>
<p>Carlton "has very much fallen from grace," says Robert
Elliot, fund manager at #6 billion Scottish Amicable
Investment Managers in Glasgow, Scotland. "It is reasonable
to assume we will not see it back on a premium, at least not
this side of a bull market."</p>
<p>Carlton is the latest casualty of the curious British
fondness for boom-and-bust stories. In the past, the London
market has propelled companies such as Saatchi and Sir
Terence Conran's Storehouse PLC retailing group to
exaggerated heights, only to knock them to equally stunning
lows when bad news surfaces. Now it seems to be Carlton's
turn.</p>
<p>Carlton's share-price gyrations reflect both current
problems and its transition from growth stock to
conglomerate. Mr. Perelman sold Technicolor at the right
time; tough competition is cutting margins at the unit, which
may account for over a third of Carlton's profits. (Carlton
doesn't disclose figures.) Moreover, high inflation and
interest rates are hurting the advertising market in Britain,
a country Carlton depends on for 36% of revenue.</p>
<p>By branching out from its base in the back rooms of
television, Carlton is embarking on a riskier strategy to
become a media colossus with operations in hardware,
programming and broadcasting itself. The jury is out on
whether Mr. Green, 42 years old, will be as successful a
manager as he has been a deal-maker. The question is whether
he can make varied businesses work.</p>
<p>Mr. Green declined to comment for this article. But he
told Carlton shareholders two weeks ago that first-quarter
revenue and pretax profits "show a respectable increase" from
a year earlier, in contrast to the "healthy" increase in
previous years. Holders who have spoken to him since say he
expects profits to grow faster next year after this year's
pause.</p>
<p>Several holders say they are angry that Carlton failed to
provide earlier clues about the apparent slowdown. They
remain confused about how long the situation will last. Their
biggest fear is the apparent slowdown in the company's energy
may become permanent.</p>
