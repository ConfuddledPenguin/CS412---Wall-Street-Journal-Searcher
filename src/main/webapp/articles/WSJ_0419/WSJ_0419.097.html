	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The U.S. merchandise trade deficit narrowed
sharply to $6.49 billion in February, the smallest monthly
imbalance since December 1983, the Commerce Department
reported.
   The $2.83 billion improvement from January's deficit came
from a 7.6% fall in imports, to $38.12 billion, the smallest
level of purchases from abroad in a year. But exports also
dropped; they slipped 1% from a record high in January, to
$31.63 billion. Only aircraft exports showed marked
improvement.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Many economists were surprised by the extent of the
narrowing in the trade deficit. They said it stemmed from a
weak economy rather than growing attractiveness of
American-made products in the U.S. or abroad.</p>
<p>"Declining trade deficits which are led by broad-based
declines in imports reflect either a weakening economy or the
recapture of market share by domestic producers; in this
case, I think it reflects a weakening economy," said Joseph
Carson, senior economist at Chemical Bank in New York. "It
doesn't reflect a good and growing economy on our part."</p>
<p>The drop in imports was led by a large decline in U.S.
purchases of foreign oil. The country's bill for imported
petroleum products declined by more than $1 billion, to $4.71
billion from $5.86 billion in January, according to the
report. Analysts said the drop partly reflected falling oil
prices. But the volume of oil imports also decreased -- to
243 million barrels from 291.3 million barrels in January.</p>
<p>In January, oil imports had surged after extremely cold
weather in December boosted energy consumption, sopping up
U.S. oil supplies. Nevertheless, many analysts remain
concerned about the country's dependency on foreign oil.</p>
<p>"Oil imports went down, but they are still well above last
year's average," said Gregory Fager, chief economist at First
City Bancorp. of Texas, in Houston. With domestic oil
production at its lowest level in years, he warned, "it will
become increasingly difficult to improve our external (trade)
accounts."</p>
<p>The U.S. has made striking headway in reducing its massive
trade deficit over the past two years. Aided by a fall in the
value of the dollar through much of 1987, exports have soared
above their levels in the mid-1980s.</p>
<p>Many economists expect the improvement to continue, but
they doubt gains will be very substantial in the coming
months. The dollar has been rising, making American goods
more expensive abroad and foreign goods cheaper here.</p>
<p>"Certainly, overseas markets are stronger than ours, but I
think those could weaken a bit," Mr. Carson said. "We have
yet to see the dollar's impact on our export performance. I
don't think exports will be very strong over next quarter."</p>
<p>Still, Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher noted that
"1990 has begun with an encouraging 11.6% increase in exports
over the same two months of last year."</p>
<p>"It is most encouraging," he added, "to note that over
half of the export increase is in advanced technology,
especially aircraft."</p>
<p>But a number of analysts cautioned that much of the
February gains in aircraft exports resulted from Boeing Co.'s
shipping a backlog of orders. Boeing's production had been
severely hindered by a strike last fall.</p>
<p>The Treasury, in a report that was ordered by Congress and
released yesterday, said, "Further improvement in the U.S.
current account position in 1990 is likely at best to be very
modest . . . (and) the possibility of deterioration . . .
cannot be excluded." The current account is the broadest
measure of the U.S. trade deficit. It includes trade in goods
as well as trade in services and financial flows.</p>
<p>The Treasury said that the U.S. isn't likely to make as
much progress closing its trade gap with Japan in 1990 as it
has in recent years, and warned that "a modest widening" is
possible. The report added that the reunification of East
Germany and West Germany, by increasing domestic demand
within a united Germany, could help reduce the German trade
surplus.</p>
<p>The U.S. trade deficit with Japan, consistently the
largest the U.S. has with any country, accounts for half this
country's total trade imbalance. But while the gap edged
wider in February, to $3.12 billion from $2.86 billion in
January, it was substantially below the monthly average for
last year. The Bush administration has been employing heavy
pressure in Japan to open its markets to more American
products.</p>
<p>Autos were one of the few categories of imports that
posted increase in February. Imports of industrial supplies,
consumer goods, capital goods and foods all fell.</p>
<p>While aircraft exports doubled, exports of industrial
supplies and foods dropped and exports of cars and consumer
goods remained practically the same as the month before.</p>
<p>Based on new data, the department revised upward its
estimate of January's trade gap, to $9.32 billion from the
$9.25 billion it calculated last month.</p>
