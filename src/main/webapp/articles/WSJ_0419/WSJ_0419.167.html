	<p class="article-leader">YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio -- GF Corp. said it and its wholly owned
GF Furniture Systems Inc. subsidiary have filed for
protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal
Bankruptcy Code.
   The maker of office furniture also said its
furniture-systems unit has agreed in principle to sell
substantially all of its assets, including manufacturing
facilities, trademarks and patents, to a private holding
company. The holding company will be formed by Cyrus Tang,
the owner of Tang Industries of Chicago, a $700 million
steel-service concern.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>GF has had trouble obtaining sufficient financing for
general working capital and to cover the closing costs of its
88-year-old Youngstown manufacturing plant. That plant had
been posting losses of between $9 million and $10 million a
year, because it wasn't producing enough to cover operating
costs.</p>
<p>In its filing, the company listed total assets of $44
million and total liabilities of $57 million, excluding
certain health care and lease liabilities, which are listed
off the company's balance sheet.</p>
<p>GF said the agreement to sell the furniture-systems assets
calls for the Tang group to provide new capital and pay off
about $22 million of bank debt, and make additional payments
to GF Furniture Systems during the next six years based on
earnings from furniture operations. The agreement doesn't
cover the unit's trade debt, liability for shutdown costs, or
health and other labor contract obligations.</p>
<p>GF said its directors have approved the immediate
conversion of GF's Class B common shares outstanding into an
equal number of common shares. The company said the Class B
shares had superior voting power; otherwise, they were
identical to regular common.</p>
