	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Tokyo's bears are turning bullish.
   Some of the same analysts who predicted the Tokyo stock
market's steep decline this year are now calling for a
strong, though selective, rebound in share prices.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A whiff of recovery blew through the Tokyo market on
Wednesday, as the Nikkei index of 225 issues jumped 787.46
points to close at 29249.06. Despite this 2.8% gain, the
index is down 25% since it closed 1989 at a record 38915.87.</p>
<p>The primary reason for this decline is the weakening yen.
The Japanese currency has lost 9% against the dollar since
the start of the year, prompting monetary authorities here to
push interest rates higher in hopes of stemming the yen's
decline. The dollar topped 160 yen Wednesday in Tokyo before
finishing in New York at 158.10 yen. Key money-market
interest rates are now trading close to 8% -- almost double
their year-ago levels.</p>
<p>Yet some once-pessimistic analysts are finding cause for
optimism in all the financial turmoil. "I'm bullish," says
Akira Suzuki, an executive director at Morgan Stanley Group
Inc.'s Tokyo office. His firm had been skeptical of Japan's
high-flying market long before it started crumbling in
January, and Mr. Suzuki predicted the market's imminent and
severe downturn just before it started. Now, he says, some
stocks are poised for recoveries of as much as 50%.</p>
<p>At rival Salomon Brothers Inc., strategist Christopher M.
Mitchinson goes even further: "We expect Japan to offer the
best return prospects of any major world equity market by
year end," he wrote in a recent report to clients. "The worst
is behind us," he says now. Like Mr. Suzuki, Mr. Mitchinson
had recommended in January that his clients bail out of the
Tokyo market -- just before stocks began the nosedive that
wiped out more than $1 trillion of the market's
capitalization.</p>
<p>Messrs. Suzuki and Mitchinson weren't the only analysts to
call the market's decline. Market analysts at other houses,
even some of Japan's usually optimistic brokerage firms, had
warned that a weaker yen, rising interest rates and slipping
corporate earnings could shatter the Tokyo market's five-year
rally. Lawrence S. Prager, chief strategist for Nikko
Securities Co., was quick to warn that the market's turmoil
of early January could turn into a rout, and he is only now
putting clients back into some stocks.</p>
<p>Still, the prescience of the U.S. houses' predictions drew
a lot of attention, and they are now leading the pack in
recommending that clients get back into the market. But many
analysts remain gloomy about the Tokyo market, and even Mr.
Suzuki concedes that a recovery may be short-lived.</p>
<p>"This may be a brief bull market in a long-term bear
market," he says. Still, Mr. Suzuki is urging his clients to
increase the amount of their Japanese investments held in
stock to 78% from the 31% he recommended last week. He says
he may increase the weighting to 85% next week.</p>
<p>He cautions, though, that only certain stocks will be able
to muster rallies. He favors about 30 heavily capitalized
companies with large domestic business bases and solid growth
outlooks. Among his choices: Kirin Brewery Co., a beer maker;
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., a machinery and aerospace
company; Mitsubishi Estate Co., a property group; Sumitomo
Corp., a trading company; Marui Co., a department store
chain; and a utility, Tokyo Electric Co.</p>
<p>Now that the dust has begun to settle after stocks dropped
during the first quarter, Mr. Suzuki figures there are
reasons to be optimistic about some companies' prospects. For
one thing, Japanese consumer spending doesn't seem to be
falling. For another, he predicts, the yen is approaching a
floor and interest rates have peaked.</p>
<p>He expects the dollar to slide from about 160 yen now to
145 yen to 150 yen by the end of the year, and he doubts
predictions by some other economists that the Bank of Japan
will be forced to raise its discount rate, the amount the
central bank charges on loans to financial institutions, for
a fifth time since last May. The Bank of Japan's governor,
Yasushi Mieno, "says the stock and bond markets have
bottomed, and this time I believe him." Besides, he adds,
"The 40% drop in some of these stocks over four consecutive
months leaves significant room for recovery."</p>
<p>Mr. Mitchinson bases his recommendation on similar ground.
"In our view, the near-term weakness will provide excellent
buying opportunities," he told clients. He warns that the
market remains risky, with the possibility of a total
collapse still present, but he adds: "We believe the reward
potential outweighs the risk."</p>
<p>His prediction for the Nikkei index's year-end level:
35000. That would be a gain of some 25% from current levels.
Moreover, Mr. Mitchinson notes, if the market plummets to
20000 before then, investors buying in at the bottom could
realize gains of 75% by the end of the year. But investors
who want to make those kinds of gains have to be willing to
hold on to their stocks regardless of further short-term
losses.</p>
<p>Other analysts who see a rebound in share prices tend to
focus narrowly on one sector or group of companies. Mr.
Prager of Nikko notes that while "there's a feeling of
support at these levels," his firm is recommending stocks
very selectively. Stocks of companies that stand to benefit
from a weaker yen, such as big exporters like auto and
electronics makers, are currently popular.</p>
<p>Nomura Securities Co., the biggest Japanese brokerage
firm, is plugging the same kind of companies. To a lesser
extent, so are Daiwa Securities Co. and Yamaichi Securities
Co., the other major Japanese houses.</p>
<p>Some foreign anlaysts are critical of their posture,
though. Mr.Suzuki at Morgan Stanley calls their support of
yen-sensitive stocks "defeatist." If the yen remains weak,
some companies may export more. But expanding exports could
mean increasing trade frictions, and the weak currency could
force the authorities to raise interest rates. "That will
result in failure for the stock market," Mr. Suzuki says.</p>
