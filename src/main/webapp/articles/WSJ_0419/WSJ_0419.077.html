	<p class="article-leader">Twenty-five years ago, Haagen-Dazs Co. opened for business
and quickly created a niche in the U.S. ice cream market. Its
super-premium ice cream was an especially big hit in the
1980s, when consumers turned to the pricey desserts.
   But as a new decade gets under way, Haagen-Dazs and its
fellow players at ice cream's highest echelon are finding
themselves at a difficult juncture: Consumers want to indulge
-- but they don't necessarily want the fat and cholesterol
that go along with super-rich ice cream.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Some companies such as Ben & Jerry's Homemade and Steve's
Homemade Ice Cream are trying to address the problem by
introducing new light products. But Haagen-Dazs is sticking
with the status quo -- at least for the time being -- and is
trying an aggressive ad campaign to recruit new takers to its
rich-and-creamy menu. In the words of its new ad slogan, the
Teaneck, N.J., unit of Grand Metropolitan invites consumers
to "Enter the State of Haagen-Dazs."</p>
<p>"This is the time to make sure the consumer finds this
brand inviting and accessible," says Yves E. Coleon, vice
president of marketing at Haagen-Dazs. "We want to make the
brand relevant to a broader group of people."</p>
<p>That'll be no easy task. Since 1988, the entire ice cream
category, including super-premium products, has been sliding.
According to the International Ice Cream Association, a trade
group, consumption across the board has been falling about 4%
a year for the past two years.</p>
<p>Haagen-Dazs concedes its rate of sales growth has slowed,
but the company insists it continues to post annual increases
in sales.</p>
<p>Haagen-Dazs's new $4 million ad campaign, created by
Margeotes Fertitta & Weiss, will keep print ads in magazines
from May through September. Outdoor advertising is planned in
a few big markets. A radio campaign is in the works, and the
company is considering TV advertising.</p>
<p>In addition, Haagen-Dazs is developing a number of special
promotions in a bid to boost sales. The first is a Mother's
Day promotion in which Haagen-Dazs will pitch ice cream as an
alternative to roses as a gift for mom. Consumers can call a
toll-free number and order gift certificates that the
recipient can redeem for pints of ice cream. Haagen-Dazs says
such promotions offer a significant opportunity to hook up
with new consumers who may not have had much exposure to the
brand.</p>
<p>The new print ads, which first appear in next week's issue
of People, feature quirky portraits of various Haagen-Dazs
enthusiasts eating their favorite dessert. In each ad, a
model sports a wide grin. But while the subjects' grins
reflect childlike excitement, the product itself is presented
with a lot of respect. One ad shows a Haagen-Dazs pop resting
on a velvet pillow.</p>
<p>Haagen-Dazs also is placing ads in tonier publications
such as Vanity Fair and Esquire. And in an unusual media
strategy for an ice-cream product, the company also hopes to
tap the cutting-edge crowd by advertising in magazines such
as Egg, Interview and Details.</p>
<p>Despite the high-brow imagery in some of the new ads,
Haagen-Dazs's Mr. Coleon believes the campaign overall is
brighter and friendlier than past campaigns, which may have
reinforced an "elitist" image.</p>
<p>He points to recent campaigns that featured some confusing
images of, among other things, a man with blue feet who was
poised to jump off a diving board into a "pool" of chocolate
ice cream. The copy read: "If you're afraid of emotional
heights, beware of Haagen-Dazs deep chocolate."</p>
<p>"In the past, we may have taken ourselves a bit too
seriously," he says.</p>

<p>CBS Touts Older Viewers</p>
<p>CBS Inc., whose TV network attracts older demographic
groups than those traditionally desired by advertisers,
yesterday released a study that showed, to no one's surprise,
the advantage of marketing to older viewers.</p>
<p>The study, "Coming of Age: Targeting the Middle of the
Market," will be used in presentations to ad agency media
planners by CBS, which finished in the ratings basement for
the third consecutive year in the 1989-90 prime-time season.</p>
<p>The key demographic for the 1990s is the 35-54 age group,
according to Thomas Leahy, president of CBS Marketing. That
group, says Mr. Leahy, consists of the "aging baby boomers
who have the strongest economic value for advertisers."</p>
<p>The most sought-after demographic for advertisers is women
18 to 49 years old.</p>
<p>The study, conducted by CBS and Ephron, Papazian & Ephron,
showed that the "middle of the market" in 1990 for most goods
and services advertised on network TV is a 40-year-old
consumer, not the 30-year-old from a decade ago.</p>
<p>John Sisk, a senior vice-president at J. Walter Thompson,
said that although 35 to 49 years old is a "key age group,
there are questions about how key of a demographic people
over 50 years old can be." One reason networks want to
attract younger viewers, said Mr. Sisk, is because that
particular demographic group "tends to be open to sample new
programming."</p>

<p>Ad Notes. . . .</p>

Angeles. Grey will create ads for the Sears, Roebuck unit's
residential real estate business. The account was previously

<p>GOLDEN VALLEY: Golden Valley Microwave Foods Inc., Edina,
Minn., named Martin/Williams Advertising, Minneapolis, to
