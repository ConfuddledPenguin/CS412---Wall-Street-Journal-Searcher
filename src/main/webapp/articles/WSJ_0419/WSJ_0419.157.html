	<p class="article-leader">A bankruptcy judge wrested control of Eastern Airlines
from its parent, Texas Air Corp. and its chairman, Frank
Lorenzo, appointing a trustee to take the helm of the
financially battered carrier.
   In a surprising move, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R.
Lifland named as trustee a man ousted only last year by Mr.
Lorenzo, Martin R. Shugrue. Mr. Shugrue had served one year
as president of Continental Airlines, Texas Air's other
airline unit. He had also been vice chairman of Pan Am Corp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In his decision, rendered late last night in New York,
Judge Lifland also released $80 million from an escrow
account to operate the airline for the current quarter.
Eastern had requested the money, but its creditors opposed
granting it as long as Texas Air and Eastern's current
management controlled the airline.</p>
<p>Judge Lifland's decision is highly unusual. In major
bankruptcy cases such as this, management is often allowed to
chart the company's reorganization course. The judge's action
signals just how far Eastern had spiraled out of the control
of its managers. Unsecured creditors sought a trustee because
they blamed current management for ever-growing losses and
the airline's inability to attract passengers.</p>
<p>Now that creditors have an apparent victory, it's unclear
if that will be enough to stem those losses and lure back
travelers.</p>
<p>Under the judge's decision, there's unlikely to be an
immediate impact on Eastern's operations. Judge Lifland has
been adamant that any trustee would be charged with
continuing to operate the airline, rather than slowly
liquidating it.</p>
<p>Losing day-to-day control of Eastern is a defeat for Texas
Air, no matter what happens in the long run. With its
acquisition of Eastern and its ownership of Continental,
Texas Air briefly ranked as the largest airline operator in
the U.S. But Texas Air has become ensnared in controversy and
suffered record losses of $718 million in 1988 and $886
million in 1989.</p>
<p>Mr. Lorenzo had successfully used Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code to reorganize Continental into a low-cost
airline that emerged from bankruptcy-law proceedings as a far
stronger carrier. He had hoped to repeat that with Eastern's
filing, but a vastly changed economy, an emotional labor
battle, and a more public bankruptcy-law case helped confound
Mr. Lorenzo's use of the process this time.</p>
<p>Under Chapter 11, a company continues to operate under
protection from creditors' lawsuits while it works out a plan
to pay its debts.</p>
<p>Judge Lifland's selection of Mr. Shugrue as trustee
puzzled many in the industry and triggered immediate
courtroom controversy. Eastern's attorney, Bruce Zirinsky,
asked the judge to wait before officially appointing the
trustee, arguing there might be a conflict given Mr.
Shugrue's departure from Continental.</p>
<p>Judge Lifland refused, saying: "It's in the best interest
of this estate that there be no vacuum or no gap in the
management. . . . {Mr. Shugrue's} qualifications, at least on
paper, make his appointment in the best interest of the
estate."</p>
<p>The judge said that given Eastern's problems, "it would be
inapproriate not to allow another management to address"
them. Mr. Shugrue will take over Eastern's reins today.</p>
<p>One of five Continental presidents to serve between 1983
and 1988, Mr. Shugrue was squeezed out after Mr. Lorenzo
hired another executive over him as chairman. Industry
insiders said Mr. Lorenzo grew impatient with Mr. Shugrue's
methodical approach to improving that carrier's performance.</p>
<p>Despite the circumstances of Mr. Shugrue's departure,
Texas Air late last night attempted to strike a conciliatory
pose toward him in his returning role. "We intend to work
with the trustee. We have high regard for Mr. Shugrue. He is
a recognized and highly qualified airline executive," a
spokesman said.</p>
<p>The fate of Eastern's current top managers, including Phil
Bakes, its president, was unclear last night. Mr. Bakes, a
longtime colleague of Mr. Lorenzo and past manager for
various Texas Air entities, declined to say if he would
continue with Eastern.</p>
<p>The appointment of a trustee apparently forces the
cancellation of a recent settlement Texas Air reached with
court-appointed bankruptcy examiner David I. Shapiro.</p>
<p>Under that agreement, Houston-based Texas Air agreed to
pay $280 million, some of that in cash, to Eastern as
compensation for certain transactions that took place between
the two before the bankruptcy-law filing last year. After a
six-month investigation, Mr. Shapiro found that in 12 of 15
intracompany transactions, it could be argued that Texas Air
underpaid Miami-based Eastern.</p>
<p>Following Judge Lifland's ruling last night, Joel Zweibel,
attorney for Eastern's unsecured creditors, said the
settlement no longer stands. But he maintained that the
creditors intend to secure at least that amount of money, if
not more, from Texas Air as the case continues.</p>
<p>Earlier yesterday, before he issued his decision, Judge
Lifland had shown visible irritation with Eastern,
particularly when its attorneys tried to assert that Mr.
Lorenzo wasn't directly in control of the carrier. "If his
hand's not on the throttle, it hovers above it, with the
ability to adjust it whenever he wants," the judge said.</p>
<p>In seeking appointment of a trustee, the unsecured
creditors, who are owed about $980 million, said repeatedly
they want to see Eastern continue to operate or be sold as a
going concern. They have argued that current management is
unable to make viable business projections and halt the
carrier's losses.</p>
<p>Eastern, however, has painted a worst-case scenario,
maintaining that a trustee is essentially the first step
toward liquidation. If that were to happen, Eastern attorneys
have claimed, creditors would be repaid only the equivalent
of 6.7 cents to 14.3 cents on each dollar owed them -- far
below Eastern's most recent offers to them.</p>
<p>Eastern has also produced witnesses who said appointment
of a trustee could hinder the pending $350 million sale of
its Latin American routes to AMR Corp.'s American Airlines.
The sale, which has received tentative approval from the U.S.
Department of Transportation, is considered vital to the cash
pool needed to repay creditors and reorganize Eastern.</p>
<p>Earlier yesterday, before the judge made his ruling, Texas
Air made yet one more attempt to head off appointment of a
trustee by presenting a new, slightly sweetened settlement to
Eastern's unsecured creditors.</p>
<p>Mr. Lorenzo, who took the stand late in the day for the
first time in the yearlong bankruptcy case, testified that
the latest offer is worth 30 cents on the dollar to
creditors: 23 cents in notes backed by Texas Air's
Continental Airlines; five cents in cash paid by Eastern but
guaranteed by Texas Air; and two cents payable in Texas Air
common stock, which would total about an 8% stake in the
company.</p>
<p>The creditors, however, found the plan unacceptable,
according to Mr. Zweibel, and instead pressed on with their
fourth day in a row of arguments requesting the trustee.</p>
<p>Even after the creditors spurned the offer, Mr. Lorenzo
told the court that as far as he was concerned, it was still
on the table, although he wasn't prepared to amend it. "If
the committee proposes to rearrange the deck chairs, we're
prepared to do that," he testified, "We're not prepared to
change the overall value."</p>
<p>The most recent offer capped a series of proposals from
Texas Air in the past few days, some announced and some
unannounced. The company earlier this week offered a package
valued at 27.5 cents on the dollar. Two weeks ago it made an
offer valued at about 25 cents on the dollar that triggered
the unsecured creditors' serious push for a trustee.</p>
<p>In his testimony yesterday, Mr. Bakes, the Eastern
president, maintained that appointment of a trustee would be
a signal to the travel industry that Eastern was going to be
liquidated. He added that Eastern employees would begin
leaving the company if a trustee was named. Indeed, a 23-year
Eastern veteran, Jose Smith, a vice president, resigned
yesterday to accept another job. Eastern executives blamed
the trustee hearing for the departure.</p>
