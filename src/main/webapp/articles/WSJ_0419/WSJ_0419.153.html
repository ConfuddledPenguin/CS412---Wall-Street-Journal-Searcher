	<p class="article-leader">DEARBORN, Mich. -- Ford Motor Co. said it is negotiating
to buy the auto finance operations of Marine Midland Banks
Inc., which in the 1980s led an unsuccessful rush of
commercial banks into the car-lending business long dominated
by auto makers.
   Ford didn't disclose how much it might pay for the auto
business of the Buffalo, N.Y.-based bank. But a Ford
spokesman said the No. 2 auto maker hopes to complete the
talks within a month and intends to keep Marine Midland's
operations separate from its Ford Motor Credit Co. unit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>With a portfolio of roughly $6 billion, Marine Midland is
the nation's fourth-largest auto lender behind the finance
arms of Ford, General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp. Marine
Midland is also one of the last major banks still competing
against the Big Three's credit companies.</p>
<p>Marine Midland Automotive Financial Corp. thrived in the
1980s by signing finance agreements with car importers such
as Saab-Scania AB and by lining up credit agreements with
foreign car dealers who didn't have close ties with a Big
Three finance subsidiary.</p>
<p>Just last August, Marine signed an agreement to form a
jointly owned finance subsidiary with the U.S. sales arm of
Jaguar PLC. The British auto maker has since been purchased
by Ford.</p>
<p>Marine also has finance arrangements with Mazda Motor
Corp., in which Ford owns a 25% stake, and Hertz Corp., which
is owned by a company in which Ford has a 49% stake.</p>
<p>The success of Marine Midland spurred other major banks,
including Security Pacific Corp. and Citicorp to try
developing sophisticated auto financing operations of their
own. But in recent years, the business soured on the
commercial banks.</p>
<p>When most of the banks entered the auto finance business,
car sales had been surging for several years. But by the late
1980s, the U.S. car market was beginning to slump.</p>
<p>In addition, the banks suffered because the Big Three
finance arms became more aggressive in lining up business
with import car stores owned by domestic car dealers.
Cut-rate financing programs employed by the Big Three hurt
the ability of commercial banks to keep pace. And many banks
saw default rates soar because they screened too loosely car
loan applicants.</p>
<p>The difficulties forced commercial banks out as serious
competitors with the Big Three, although most banks still
offer some consumer car loans and dealer financing.</p>
<p>An additional factor influenced Marine's decision to
consider selling its car-loan business: the low tolerance of
its parent, Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp., for sub-par
returns. Though Marine Midland's auto finance operations have
been very profitable in the past, margins have shrunk as
sales of high-priced foreign cars in the U.S. fell.</p>
<p>For all of 1989, a large provision for loan losses pushed
Marine Midland's earnings down to only $13.9 million compared
to $160.5 million in 1988. In this year's first quarter,
Marine earned $6 million, far below the $40.2 million of a
year ago, due to restructuring charges.</p>
<p>Marine Midland last summer tried to move its auto loan
operations into a joint venture with Aon Corp. of Chicago and
Orient Finance Co. Ltd. of Japan. But that deal unraveled
late last year, with Marine blaming uncertainty in the U.S.
auto market.</p>
<p>Over the last year, Marine has sold its stakes in two
banks that it intended to acquire, put a lid on loan growth
and sold $160 million in students loans and its credit card
processing business for merchants.</p>
<p>In part, Hongkong & Shanghai appears to be shepherding its
resources in anticipation of some sort of closer union with
Britain's Midland Bank PLC. Hongkong & Shanghai owns a
minority stake in the British bank, and a standstill
agreement regarding further purchases expires later this
year.</p>
<p>A Ford spokesman said the auto maker isn't negotiating to
buy Marine's $6 billion in auto receivables. Marine
executives didn't return calls seeking comment.</p>
