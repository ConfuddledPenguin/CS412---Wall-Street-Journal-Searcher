	<p class="article-leader">A partnership controlled by David H. Batchelder, which
holds a 6.6% stake in Pic 'N' Save Corp. and plans to make a
bid to acquire the company, said it intends to solicit
proxies to gain a majority on the board.
   The plan, which was disclosed in a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, appears to be tactical
shift by Girard Partners Limited Partnership. Girard had
previously said it planned to obtain control of the board
through the written-consents process.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Last week, the La Jolla, Calif.-based partnership formally
asked Pic 'N' Save to adopt a resolution giving Girard
control of the board. The resolution would cut the size of
the board to five members, including three Girard appointees.
The board currently has seven members. Now the partnership
said it plans to solicit proxies to elect its nominees at Pic
'N' Save's 1990 annual meeting.</p>
<p>The company hasn't set a date for the meeting, a spokesman
said. He declined to comment on the filing. Last year, Pic
'N' Save's annual meeting was held on May 18. Based in
Dominguez, Calif., Pic 'N' Save is a retail chain that buys
manufactuers' close-out merchandise and sells it at deep
discounts to customers.</p>
