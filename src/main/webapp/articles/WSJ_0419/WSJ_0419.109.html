	<p class="article-leader">DURHAM,N.C. -- We died a horrible death last month at Duke
University, one which was public in its humiliation and
intense in its pain. The Duke Blue Devils were not merely
beaten in the NCAA basketball tournament's final game by the
incredible team put together at that hotbed of
student-scholar athletics, the University of Nevada-Las
Vegas. They were routed, embarrassed, overpowered,
demoralized, out-coached and out-run. Since basketball to
Duke is akin to what the pope is to the Vatican, the whipping
was not merely a disaster. It was close to a mortal sin.
   Unfortunately for Duke, that visible collapse managed to
overshadow at least for a while the far more troublesome --
because enduring -- shame that is professionalism in college
sports. In too many places, not least in several Atlantic
Coast Conference schools, the athletic department tail has
been spinning the academic dog around its head for a long
time, and to the cheers of the crowd. What is truly pathetic
is not Duke's one-game collapse, which could not obscure the
remarkable and totally unexpected run this very young team
made at the NCAA championship, but the corruption of higher
education by the demands of the entertainment business that
big-time college and basketball have become.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Let us begin with the most obvious statement of the
problem. Coaches, athletic directors, university presidents
and cheerleading sports writers love to refer to the "student
athletes" who perform their gladiatorial duties with such
superb skill. Athletes they are. Students too few of them
ever become. The anecdotal, and deeply saddening, evidence of
individual professional stars who were never taught to read
in secondary school or college is well-known. Somewhat less
well-known is that only 30% of National Football League
players graduated from their institutions, and there is
reason to believe their graduation rate was somewhat better
than their less-talented teammates. Of the 97 major college
basketball programs, 35 have graduation rates of less than
20%.</p>
<p>If the vast majority of the "student-athletes" don't go on
to the promised land of professional sports and large numbers
don't graduate, who or what is the beneficiary of their
undergraduate toll? One recent news report should help answer
the question. CBS has signed a $1 billion contract for the TV
rights to the NCAA's annual basketball tournament. That
illustrates the reality behind the fiction of amateur
athletics at many universities. There are seas of money to be
made from winning football and basketball, plus oceans of ink
and endless hours of air time. The money and recognition have
subverted academic standards, eroded integrity, generated and
rewarded hypocrisy and taken real control of athletic
programs from university presidents and given it to coaches
and athletic directors.</p>
<p>What happens to coaches on their way in and their way out
is worth noting. At Clemson, under scrutiny for
corner-cutting in its football program, Coach Danny Ford was
forced out, but with a $1 million settlement to console him.
At North Carolina State University, the extremely engaging if
arguably amoral basketball coach Jim Valvano is departing, a
NCAA probation his legacy. The university paid him $238,000
to go without a major legal fight; the virtually autonomous
athletic booster organization, the Wolfpack Club, paid him
$375,000; the state's governor, James Martin, openly backed
him against the NCSU administration. When former University
of North Carolina football coach Dick Crum was let go in
1987, the deal was facilitated by an $885,000 payout by the
Rams Club, the university's independent sports boosters'
organization.</p>
<p>Whatever the actual results, money is seen as the way to
buy success, particularly in the wake of adversity. The
University of Florida's football program has had repeated
scandals, suggesting something fundamental is amiss. The
university confronted it by paying its former Heisman Trophy
winner, Steve Spurrier, $2.1 million over four years to coach
the team. He will make $70,000 more a year if he improves the
team's graduation rate, low even by the abysmal standards of
the Southeastern Conference. The chancellor of the State
Board of Regents says Mr. Spurrier is being paid for his
integrity. "I can't put a price tag on integrity," Chancellor
Charlie Reed said. "It's just too important. Paying that out
is money well spent."</p>
<p>It's a nice thought. The way to restore integrity in
athletics is to pay a coach more money than anyone else in
the college. It'll be interesting to see the value placed on
Mr. Spurrier's integrity if he doesn't produce a winning
team. What happened to the idea that it is the responsibility
of college presidents to ensure integrity in athletics, just
as they are responsible for integrity in the physics or
English departments?</p>
<p>One sad -- because accurate -- assessment came recently
from the outgoing Sun Belt commissioner, Vic Bubas. "If
you're a president, how would you like to be trying to solve
some of these problems and not even know you have the support
of your board of trustees?" he said. "I know some schools
right now where if presidents took too active a position on
academics and jeopardized a little bit the chance of winning,
they'd get rid of the president."</p>
<p>Hoping there is strength in unity, the Presidents
Commission, a sub-grouping of the National College Athletic
Association, is pushing more vigorously for reforms. The
NCAA's annual meeting took some steps in the right direction
earlier this year, including a requirement that universities
and colleges publish their athletes' graduation rates.
College faculties are beginning to speak up in forceful ways,
as the Chapel Hill faculty recently did in a wide-ranging set
of recommendations.</p>
<p>But reform is a sometime thing, while money in basketball
and football is a rapidly multiplying reality. Alumni whose
values are warped demand winning as a goal in itself. Pro
basketball and football do not have minor-league teams and
use the colleges as farm clubs.</p>
<p>The solution seems fairly obvious. Those universities that
want to have show biz athletic programs should be allowed to
run them with professional employees at every level. Their
employees would not have to masquerade as students. The other
institutions of higher learning would opt out entirely,
abandon preferential treatment and subsidies for athletes and
restore meaning to the phrase "student-athlete." That's what
the Ivy League did almost 40 years ago.</p>
<p>The booster clubs would be happy. The
athletes-in-training, who could concentrate on their real
reason for being there in the first place, would be happy.
The coaches would be happy. And the universities would no
longer be forced to defend the academically indefensible.</p>
<p>Anything short of that is almost certain to fail, just as
surely as Duke failed in its test with UNLV, a school that
hardly bothers to pretend it isn't running a training camp
for pros. There's too much money and too much pressure in
big-time college athletics to allow piecemeal reform to get
in the way of success. The handful of exceptions, where
big-league athletics and academics coexist, such as Duke,
only prove the rule. Admitting the obvious and making the
most of it is the only honest, and workable, way to go.</p>
