	<p class="article-leader">The naked mole-rat is a nasty-looking piece of work.
   It is pink, wrinkly and 3 to 6 inches long. Though neither
mole nor rat, it is naked, or nearly so. Whiskers sprout from
its awful little face, and strands of hair stick out from the
tip of its tail and from between its bony toes. It has long
tusk-like teeth and squinty eyes. It is a rodent.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It is also being hailed as "the animal of the future" by
marketing people at zoos.</p>
<p>Scaling the heights of zoo fashion isn't going to be easy
for this underground beast. Described as a sausage with teeth
by a zoo curator and called "really quite revolting" by an
editor of a coming book on the breed, the naked mole-rat
hardly elicits the kind of human response found around the
monkey cage or outside the leafy preserve of the giant panda.
Almost universal is the sentiment often expressed by
youngsters encountering a colony at the Cincinnati Zoo:
"Ooooh. Gross]"</p>
<p>Yet beauty, as we know, is only skin deep. And zoologists
find the naked mole-rat enchanting. Next month, the
Brookfield Zoo near Chicago will unveil its first colony of
naked mole-rats. Other zoos -- in Phoenix, Chicago (Lincoln
Park Zoo) and Washington, D.C. -- want to acquire some. Zoos
that already have colonies -- in London, Philadelphia and in
New York City's Bronx borough -- are preparing the skittery
creatures for display.</p>
<p>In time, zoo people hope, the public will respond
favorably to the naked mole-rat. "People are less married to
cute and cuddly," says a spokeswoman at the Cincinnati Zoo,
"and more willing to reach out to what used to seem too
strange and unpalatable." Look at the wart-hog, says a
spokeswoman at the Philadelphia Zoo. Asked to vote it "beauty
or beast," zoogoers in that city decided "beauty." "His inner
qualities shined through," says the spokeswoman.</p>
<p>What makes naked mole-rats so exciting to scientists,
however, is not their looks, but their stranger-than-fiction
behavior. These creatures represent a little-understood
evolutionary parallel between insects and mammals: They are
the only known mammals with the social behavior of wasps,
bees and ants.</p>
<p>In their native habitats in Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia,
mole-rats live in underground tunnels, a colony of about 100
infiltrating areas as large as six football fields. Each
colony has a queen, almost always the sole breeding female,
and one or two breeding males. The others are sexually
uninterested workers who dig for food and tend the royal
brood, or "pups."</p>
<p>Getting to be queen sometimes involves a bloody fight to
the death. Females sink their huge buck teeth into their
rivals' mouths and genitalia. The victor, who may end up
missing a toe or two, then balloons in size, sometimes nearly
doubling her weight. The males don't seem to care who gets to
service her. But those who do pay for the honor: Their bulk
gradually shrinks by half.</p>
<p>Stan Braude, a mole-rat researcher affiliated with the
University of Michigan, is so enthralled by all this that he
sells mole-rat T-shirts to his scientific colleagues, bearing
a cartoon of a queen in pearls, sharing martinis with her
mate in a bow tie. The caption: "The Naked Mole-rat, A Truly
Social Mammal."</p>
<p>A typical zoo display of naked mole-rats resembles an
immense ant farm. The animals scurry through a
temperature-controlled system of plastic tubes and chambers,
climbing over each other, sweeping, grooming and tussling.
They run backwards as fast as forward, tapping their tails
like a blind person's cane. "When they are all active, it's
like Times Square on New Year's Eve," says James Doherty,
general curator at the Bronx Zoo. In sleep, they pile on top
of one another, like nudists huddling for warmth.</p>
<p>Maintaining mole-rats in captivity is no small feat. Most
zoos keep their colonies "off exhibit" -- away from the
public -- while pondering how to keep them content. Mole-rats
get spooked by everyday noises. "We notice every time
somebody slams a door, they all stop for a minute and
listen," says Jo Gipps, a curator at the London Zoo. If pups
are repeatedly disrupted by noise-freaked adults, they quit
nursing and die. The Philadelphia Zoo, hoping to accustom its
colony to human sound, has borrowed a trick that dairy
workers use to calm cows: radio music, specifically the songs
of Bruce Springsteen. Brookfield, meanwhile, is trying talk
radio.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these animals constantly test the fondness of
their handlers. Naked mole-rats are so wary of foreign smells
that zoo keepers touching them must first rub their hands
with chips coated with the queen's urine.</p>
<p>As zoologists cope with keeping molerats healthy and
happy, marketing people cope with hyping them. Bruce Brewer,
a curator at Brookfield, offered this suggestion: Place a
billboard in the Chicago area's affluent North Shore that
displays a giant photo of a naked mole-rat face and the words
"Now at Brookfield Zoo." "People would think we have
monsters," he says gleefully.</p>
<p>The marketing department killed that idea, as well as
another suggestion for an ad theme: "Let's Get Naked."
Instead, the zoo plans to feature photographs of naked
mole-rats, along with some other animals, in mailings to
members.</p>
<p>Yet just one glimpse of a naked mole-rat can cause the
willies. Mystery writer Elmore Leonard says a magazine photo
of the rodents inspired his account of the delirium tremens
suffered by a wealthy drunk in "Freaky Deaky": "Woody saw
naked mole-rats coming at him . . . with teeth so big they
couldn't close their mouth. . . . They were on his bed, on
him . . . crawling up his body and he couldn't move. All he
could do was raise his head and scream, `Yaaaah]' "</p>
<p>Coincidentally, there is a real Woody: Dave Wood, an
assistant curator who tends the Philadelphia Zoo's
off-exhibit colony of naked mole-rats. Nicknamed "Woody," he
displays the excerpt from "Freaky Deaky" on his office door
as a caption to a large photo of the animals. "They're ugly
as sin," he says, but "they grow on you."</p>
<p>He is careful, however, to prepare behind-the-scenes
visitors for seeing the live colony by first showing them the
photo.</p>
<p>Bob Truett, a zoo director in Birmingham, Ala., who also
operates a nudist colony, has a theory to explain why people
dislike the naked mole-rat. "We identify with things that
have hair," he says, "because we are very hairy creatures."</p>
<p>Gordon Gallup, psychologist at the State University of New
York who studies people's reactions to animals, disagrees,
insisting that human beings and mole-rats have much in
common. Unlike most mammals, both are mostly naked, he notes,
and love to congregate in large groups.</p>
<p>"If an intelligent life form from another part of the
cosmos were to visit planet Earth," he adds, "my guess is
they'd lump naked mole-rats and humans together because we
are so unusual relative to other species."</p>
<p>Some people even develop a sort of kinship with the
creatures. Jennifer Jarvis, a researcher in South Africa,
raises mole-rat colonies for study and is the chief supplier
to zoos ($200 per animal, or $4,000 for a small colony of
20). She remembers a time she was collecting mole-rats near a
watering hole in northern Kenya. A blanket-swathed elder from
the dark-skinned Samburu tribe, regarding the white-skinned
Ms. Jarvis and her catches, noted, "Their skin is just like
your skin."</p>
<p>Perhaps afraid he'd offended her, he added: "But oh, they
are beautiful."</p>
<p>Ms. Jarvis, whose skin had turned a dusty pink-brown after
two weeks' digging in the hot sun, realized with delight that
he was right. "I hadn't really thought about them being like
me," she says.</p>
