	<p class="article-leader">MCI Communications Corp., Washington, reported
first-quarter net income increased 21% with strong growth in
revenue and long-distance telephone traffic volume.
   The long-distance carrier said net income grew to $163
million, or 62 cents a share, from $135 million, or 51 cents
a share, in the year-earlier quarter.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Revenue increased 20% to $1.81 billion from $1.5 billion.</p>
<p>Analysts said results were consistent with their
predictions. Joel Gross of Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette said
MCI "is gaining market share and will continue to do so."
Jack Grubman of PaineWebber said results were "fine," but the
stock isn't going up because MCI "is getting penalized for
doing the right thing." He said the company is investing for
the long term in marketing, sales efforts, equipment and
network improvements.</p>
<p>In national over-the-counter trading, MCI stock closed at
$35.125, down $1.625.</p>
