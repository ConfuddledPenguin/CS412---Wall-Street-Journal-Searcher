	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- Canada's trade surplus narrowed to 264.2 million
Canadian dollars (US$226.8 million) in February from C$669.4
million (US$574.7 million) in January, partly as a result of
a rise in imports from the U.S., Statistics Canada, a federal
agency, said.
   Canadian imports from the U.S. rose 4.7% to C$7.81
billion, or 68.2% of total Canadian imports of C$11.44
billion. Canadian exports to the U.S. declined 0.1% to C$8.63
billion, or 73.7% of total Canadian exports of C$11.71
billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Auto parts showed the strongest import growth in February,
rising C$405.8 million from January as a result of a pickup
in Canadian auto production.</p>
