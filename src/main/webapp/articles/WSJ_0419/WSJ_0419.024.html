	<p class="article-leader">EAST BERLIN -- East Germany's industrial production
dropped 4.7% in the first quarter of 1990 from year-earlier
levels, mostly reflecting a decline in the number of workers,
the president of the nation's Statistics Office, Arno Donda,
said.
   According to East Germany's ADN news agency, Mr. Donda
said the total number of industrial workers declined by
124,000 during the period, while the number of workers in the
construction sector alone was off 33,000 from year-earlier
levels.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Many East Germans started to move permanently to West
Germany in search of better living conditions after the
breaching of the Berlin Wall on Nov. 9. That trend continued
during the first months of 1990, but the stream of
resettlers, which included a large number of skilled workers,
slowed to a trickle after East Germany held its first free
elections on March 18.</p>
