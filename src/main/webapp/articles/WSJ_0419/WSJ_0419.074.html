	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Harold Ballard bequeathed his 80% stake in
Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. to a trust created to benefit various
charities.
   Mr. Ballard, who died last week at 86 years of age, willed
that the trust vote his Maple Leaf Gardens shares, which have
a market value of about 108 million Canadian dollars (US$92.7
million), the company said. Maple Leaf Gardens owns the
Toronto Maple Leafs National Hockey League franchise, an
arena in Toronto and a printing plant.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Executors of Mr. Ballard's will, who are also trustees of
the trust, said they don't anticipate any changes in the
corporate structure or business affairs of Maple Leaf Gardens
in the near future. They will make any decisions regarding
the ultimate disposition of the trust's stake in Maple Leaf
Gardens. Beneficiaries of the trust are various charitable,
humanitarian and non-profit organizations to which Mr.
Ballard contributed during his life.</p>
<p>Mr. Ballard didn't bequeath any of his Maple Leaf Gardens
shares to his three children, the company said. Under the
terms of his will, Mr. Ballard's companion of the last eight
years, Yolanda Ballard, 56, will receive an annual annuity of
C$50,000 until her death or until she marries.</p>
