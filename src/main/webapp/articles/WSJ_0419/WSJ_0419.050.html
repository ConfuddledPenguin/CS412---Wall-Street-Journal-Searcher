	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A big rout in the Treasury bond market sent
stock prices tumbling and helped weaken the dollar against
key currencies.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 32.89 to 2732.88,
the sharpest decline in about two months.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Traders and investors said the main factor was continued
Japanese selling of long-term U.S. Treasury securities. The
bellwether 30-year bond dropped 1 1/8 points, or $11.25 for
each $1,000 face amount, taking yields up to 8.83%, the
highest level in nearly a year.</p>
<p>All three markets largely ignored yesterday's merchandise
trade report for February, which showed a significant
narrowing of the U.S. deficit. "The trade report, if
anything, should have been favorable" for bond prices, said
Michael Strauss, chief economist at UBS Securities Inc.</p>
<p>Imports of oil and consumer goods dropped, pointing to
moderating inflation pressures. Non-auto capital goods
exports rose to $12.9 billion, a record high, according to
Louis Crandall, economist at R.H. Wrightson & Associates,
Inc., an economic research firm. "All the surprises in the
trade report were favorable," Mr. Crandall said.</p>
<p>But bonds fell sharply as talk of widespread Japanese
selling spread through the market. Traders said Japan's trust
banks and other financial institutions were taking profits on
both bond and currency positions.</p>
<p>Indeed, foreign exchange traders said the dollar tumbled
on steady sales from traders around the world, starting in
Tokyo the night before, as the dollar traded near 160 yen.</p>
<p>"My guess is that Japanese investors are moving to other
financial centers," said John Gaines, a foreign exchange
trader at Bank of New York. "I think they are switching out
of dollars and into {West German} marks."</p>
<p>Added James McGroarty, senior vice president at Greenwich
Capital Markets: "I think Japanese investors chose this as an
opportune time to take some profits."</p>
<p>Treasury bond prices could keep falling until yields are
buoyed up to 9%, several traders predicted. Such a sharp rise
in bond yields usually hurts stocks, which become a less
attractive investment.</p>
<p>But not all investors are bearish. The improved U.S.
exports confirmed what several stock strategists have been
forecasting: a rebound in America's basic industries this
year. "I haven't shared the notion that the economy is going
to grind to a halt and that earnings are so terrible," said
Joseph McAlinden, director of research at Dillon, Read & Co.</p>
<p>Among other cyclical stocks, which rise and fall with the
pace of economic activity, some auto shares held their
ground; Ford rose 7/8 to 48. But profit-taking clobbered
semiconductor, technology and software stocks that have risen
lately.</p>
<p>Michael Schonberg, chief investment strategist at Chase
Investors Management Corp., said he will use declines in
stock prices to start "paying more attention to cyclical
stocks." Earnings of many of these companies are at the low
point for the year, he believes.</p>
<p>The Dow industrials' drop was the sharpest since a
38.74-point slump Feb. 20. But volume was a light 147.1
million shares. Laszlo Birinyi, who heads his own stock
research firm, said net dollar outflow from the stock market
amounted to $163 million in block trades and $96 million in
non-block trades.</p>
<p>"Given what the market did today, it was not an especially
large amount {of net outflow}; there was very little selling
pressure," Mr. Birinyi said. That meant foreign investors who
were selling dollars and Treasury bonds weren't also dumping
stocks.</p>
<p>"Stocks that had a lot of net outflows were not those that
I would characterize as foreign-owned," Mr. Birinyi said.</p>
<p>Among typically foreign-owned issues, such as General
Motors, Merck and Ford, more money flowed into these stocks
through big block trades than flowed out, Mr. Birinyi said.</p>
<p>In major market activity:</p>
<p>Stocks fell. Declining issues swamped advancers on the New
York Stock Exchange by 1,056 to 477.</p>
<p>Bonds tumbled. The benchmark 30-year Treasury issue sank 1
1/8 points, or $11.25 for each $1,000 face amount.</p>
<p>The dollar was off sharply. In late New York trading, the
dollar was quoted at 1.6722 marks and 158.10 yen, compared
with 1.6768 marks and 159.68 yen late Tuesday.</p>
