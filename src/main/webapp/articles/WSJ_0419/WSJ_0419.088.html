	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The nation's two biggest securities firms
posted mixed results for the first quarter as both were
pinched by the slump in investment banking, one of Wall
Street's biggest sources of income.
   Merrill Lynch & Co., helped by cost-cutting, reported an
11% rise in first-quarter net income. American Express Co.'s
Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. subsidiary had a $915
million loss, a securities industry record, after posting
previously predicted one-time charges of $787 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At industry leader Merrill, investment-banking revenue
plunged 27% from a year earlier, while No. 2 Shearson
indicated that it had a 25% decline. Both firms were hit by
lower stock and bond underwriting, slumping junk-bond prices
and the ensuing drop in takeover activity.</p>
<p>Separately, Charles Schwab Corp., parent of the discount
brokerage firm, reported a 7.5% decline in first-quarter net.</p>
<p>Merrill's top officers were cautious about the outlook for
a pickup in the investment-banking sector.</p>
<p>"Will it rebound to 1988 levels? No, that's probably not
in the cards," said Daniel P. Tully, Merrill president and
chief operating officer. Mr. Tully said that the slump allows
the firm to "lay the groundwork" for a future upturn, but
that "getting back to '88 is going to take some time."</p>
<p>Merrill, which previously indicated it would lay off as
many as 3,000 of its 41,000 employees, has let go 1,600 so
far, including investment bankers. Many of the remaining
1,400 or so may be dismissed in the current quarter and
investment bankers will be among those idled, Merrill
officials said.</p>
<p>Although Merrill will continue to cut costs the rest of
the year, officials said they don't expect another
retrenchment charge such as the $470 million Merrill took in
the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>One reason investment bankers are being shown the door:
Much of their business depends on the health of the $200
billion public market for high-yield, high-risk junk bonds,
which shows few signs of rebounding. Investment-banking firms
rely heavily on the fat fees associated with mergers and
acquisitions, which in recent years have been financed
largely by junk bonds.</p>
<p>Merrill's investment-banking revenue declined in the first
quarter to $182.7 million from $249.2 million. Shearson's
investment-banking revenue fell to $162 million from $216
million.</p>
<p>For the first quarter, Merrill posted net of $41.3 milion,
or 34 cents a share, up from $37.2 million, or 31 cents a
share, a year earlier. The year-earlier period included a
gain of $1.7 million, or two cents a share, from discontinued
operations. Profit from ongoing lines rose 16%. Revenue fell
4.7%, to $2.66 billion from $2.80 billion.</p>
<p>The quarterly results were bolstered by a continued
increase in customer assets under management, to nearly $104
billion from $83 billion. Merrill's asset-management and
custodial fee revenue jumped 19%, to $170.1 million from $143
million. Managing mutual-fund assets generates fees based on
the amount of assets under management; those fees continue to
rush in even in poor markets.</p>
<p>Merrill and other firms hope to make money selling stocks
to individuals once investors return in large numbers to the
stock market. Merrill says only 22% of the assets it manages
for investors are in the stock market. "The {potential}
buying power there is just awesome," says William A.
Schreyer, Merrill chairman and chief executive officer.</p>
<p>Merrill insists that its huge "retail," or
individual-investor brokerage, network of 12,000 brokers will
position the firm to one day take advantage of resumed
small-investor interest. The retail business might not turn
around this quarter or next, says Mr. Tully, "but as sure as
God made little apples, this business will grow."</p>
<p>Messrs. Schreyer and Tully said the firm's cost-cutting
efforts are starting to bear fruit. Merrill's expenses of
$2.6 billion were down 5% from $2.73 billion a year earlier.
Among other things, Merrill managed an 8.5% cut in office
supplies and postage, to $36.5 million.</p>
<p>Because of their new cost-cutting bent, Merrill officials
said they aren't any longer focusing on being No. 1 in every
business. Still, they pointed with pride in a news release
that the firm maintained its No. 1 ranking in U.S. and global
underwriting for the quarter. Said Mr. Tully: "We are going
for profitable market share. If it turns out we're No. 1, so
be it. But we're not going for market share for market
share's sake."</p>
<p>Analysts still wonder how fast Merrill can turn itself
around. "I'm not totally convinced quite yet; the next three
quarters will give us a better idea" of how Merrill's big
cost-cutting program is working, said Diana Keat, an analyst
at Lipper Analytical Securities Corp.</p>
<p>Merrill stock fell 75 cents to $23.125 yesterday in a
slumping stock market. Shearson, which reported its loss
after the market closed, fell 37.5 cents to $13.50.</p>
<p>Overall, Wall Street's earnings picture remains dim. Most
major firms, aside from Salomon Inc., are expected to post
mediocre results. The two big publicly traded firms that have
managed to post gains, Merrill and PaineWebber Group Inc. (up
17%), have done so largely because the comparable
year-earlier results were so bad, analysts say.</p>
<p>Shearson, aside from its one-time charges, had operating
losses of $128 million, resulting mainly from "a marked
slowdown in overall business activity." Revenue decreased 15%
to $2.6 billion from $3 billion.</p>
<p>Shearson's assets under management declined to $92.8
billion from $99.8 billion. Shearson said the decline
reflects the sale of part of its Boston Co. money-management
business and related divestitures.</p>
<p>Even though Shearson announced a massive cost-cutting
program in late February, it said that first-quarter expenses
rose 9%, to $3.3 billion from $3 billion. Expenses included a
restructuring charge of $630 million. Shearson said its
cost-cutting drive, when fully implemented, will save it
about $400 million annually.</p>
<p>Charles Schwab's first-quarter net income fell to $3.7
million, or 14 cents a share, from $4 million, or 15 cents a
share, a year earlier.</p>
