	<p class="article-leader">After the horrendous bouts with inflation in the 1970s and
early 1980, it was natural that our kind-hearted government
would want to do something to ease future inflation pains.
   Social Security benefits are indexed, and in this tax
season most of us know that the government has taken steps
toward indexing ordinary income taxes. For tax years
beginning after 1988, the taxable income bracket at which the
28% rate begins has been subject to adjustment for inflation.
The standard deduction also is adjusted to reflect inflation.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>There are a number of other proposals kicking around to
lessen inflation's sting. Capital income might be indexed,
the government might issue indexed bonds or it might even pay
interest on money. Two economists, however, suggest that such
inflation-softening measures might be very bad ideas.</p>
<p>Stanley Fischer of the World Bank and MIT and Lawrence
Summers of Harvard believe that such gimmicks may help to
assure that the inflation will persist. "Should Governments
Learn to Live With Inflation?" is the title of their paper
reprinted by the National Bureau of Economic Research.
(Reprint No. 1347.) Their answer is an emphatic, "No."</p>
<p>"Our main conclusion," they write, "is that governments
whose ability to maintain low rates of inflation is uncertain
should not reduce the costs of actual inflation. Measures
that reduce the cost of anticipated inflation, or undercut
opposition to it, are particularly likely to be pernicious."</p>
<p>It would be reasonable to say that the U.S. government's
ability to maintain low inflation rates is at least
uncertain. The double-digit inflation rates of 1979, 1980 and
1981 were finally beaten down by major Federal Reserve
surgery, involving the deep recession of 1981-82. With the
help of an oil price drop, the rate actually fell below 2% in
1986, but it bounced right back up. The rate has been
vacillating between 4% and 5%, though it shot up to 8.5% in
the first quarter. Nevertheless, administration officials are
wont to say that inflation has been "contained," whatever
that means.</p>
<p>When you've weathered the high inflation rates of the
1970s and early 1980s, it's easy to sniff at 4% to 5%
inflation. That, in effect, is exactly what the Council of
Economic Advisers does in the latest Economic Report. "Low,
predictable rates of inflation," the Council says, "have
little adverse effect on the economy." It's the high and
widely variable inflation rates that can do a lot of damage
to economic performance. "Low" and "high" remain undefined.</p>
<p>Perceptions change over the years. When the inflation rate
crept above 4% in 1971, President Richard Nixon imposed wage
and price controls.</p>
<p>Wage-price controls were obviously a desperate move; the
government didn't know what else to do. But so, to a
considerable extent, is any effort to palliate the effects of
inflation. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Arthur Burns put
it like this in 1978:</p>
<p>"This (indexation) is a counsel of despair. . . . I doubt
if there is any practical way of redesigning economic
contracts to deal with this problem satisfactorily. In any
event, if a nation with our traditions attempted to make it
easy to live with inflation, rather than resist its corrosive
influence, we would slowly but steadily lose the sense of
discipline needed to pursue governmental policies with an eye
to the permanent welfare of our people."</p>
<p>The inflation palliatives make it easier for legislators
to embark on spending programs that may have inflationary
effects. With the safeguards in place, the lawmakers can
reason, nobody is going to get hurt. But inflation mitigation
policies, Mr. Fischer and Mr. Summers note, although they
reduce the cost of a given level of inflation, may end up
making inflation more costly to society. Inflation is always
counterproductive, because the extra inflation that results
has costs that exceed the direct benefits of protecting
against inflation.</p>
<p>It isn't surprising that indexation has been especially
popular in the high-inflation countries of Latin America.
It's a way to keep the electorate reasonably quiet while
governments try to think of something else to do. Indexation
is more controversial in relatively low (there's that word
again) inflation countries such as the U.S.</p>
<p>Forgoing inflation palliatives, in a real sense, amounts
to a commitment -- though hardly a perfect one -- to seek
stable prices. A better way may be for the government to
achieve a reputation for hating inflation. Once such a
reputation is attained -- West Germany and Switzerland have
had it pretty consistently in recent decades -- it is
difficult to give it up. The public becomes adjusted to an
inflation rate of 1% or 2%, and if the rate goes higher it
feels it has been cheated. Inflation expectations and
interest rates rise, damaging the economy.</p>
<p>Profs. Fischer and Summers suggest that nations with
impeccable anti-inflation credentials have no reason to fear
indexation and some reason to favor it. It's difficult for
any country to control inflation precisely, and a country
with very low rates might offer indexation as assurance that,
if things went bad for a year or two, the public wouldn't
suffer.</p>
<p>The authors don't get into it, but Japan might be in that
sort of situation now. Japan's inflation rates have been very
low. Consumer prices since the mid-1980s have usually risen
about 1% a year or less. But efforts to control the yen have
contributed to a sharp monetary expansion, with the result
that consumer prices in the past year have been moving up at
annual rates close to 3%.</p>
<p>The Bank of Japan has been raising interest rates to curb
the inflation, and perhaps it will succeed. But until the
issue is settled, indexation might help if the government
could persuade the public that the current episode is no more
than a temporary aberration.</p>
<p>Otherwise the Japanese, like the Latin Americans, could
find that better inflation protection would merely lead to
more inflation.</p>
