	<p class="article-leader">A few weeks ago in an Israeli court, Hertzl Bocovza, a
26-year-old trucker, appeared on charges of careless driving.
The proceeding was a banal coda to the 28 months of violence
sparked when Mr. Bocovza's truck killed four Gaza Strip
Palestinians.
   "Intifada: The Palestinian Uprising -- Israel's Third
Front" (Simon & Schuster, 352 pages, $22.95) takes Mr.
Bocovza's December 1987 accident as its starting point. In
the seething, squalid camps of Gaza, Mr. Bocovza's smash
wasn't seen as a careless accident, but an act of war; a
deliberate killing of Palestinian laborers on their way home
from work.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Written by Ze'ev Schiff and Ehud Ya'ari, two experienced
Israeli military correspondents, the book offers much new and
revealing detail gleaned from army and security-service
insiders. For instance, a survey conducted in Gaza jails
during the first days of the intifada showed that the riots
were being led by an entirely new type of protester,
unfamiliar with even the most rudimentary slogans of the
Palestine Liberation Organization or any of the typical
baggage of politicized Palestinians.</p>
<p>Instead, the 100 or so young men interviewed turned out to
be driven to despair by the routine miseries of scrambling
for the poorly paid work unwanted by an Israeli majority who
regarded them with a mixture of contempt and fear. Many told
of humiliations, such as the wedding convoy stopped at a
checkpoint, where the groom was ordered to dismantle the
wheels and seats of his car as his anguished bride looked on.</p>
<p>Initially, such findings didn't stop Israeli politicians
calling the intifada the work of outside agitators, nor stop
Yasser Arafat pathetically trying to claim credit as its
puppet-master. Eventually though, the authors say, the
evidence began "tearing through the veil of hypocrisy and
self-deceit that what Israel had practiced for over 21 years
was a `benevolent occupation.'"</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the book's insights are embedded in
mechanical prose that clunks along with so many "steam
boilers," "gaskets" and "pistons" pressed into metaphorical
service that it reads, in part, like a technical manual. This
is a bloodless book, bereft of human voices. Instead of
allowing us to hear directly from the participants, Messrs.
Schiff and Ya'ari distill the fruits of their extensive
contacts into a colorless concoction.</p>
<p>More serious is the book's lack of balance. The authors
date their foreword October 1989, but the book seems to lose
track of the intifada long before that date. Little light is
shed, for instance, on the uprising's sharp turn inward in
the second year: the ghastly murders of Palestinians by their
own activists on charges of collaboration with Israelis.</p>
<p>Perhaps this imbalance also skews the authors'
conclusions. Arguing that the intifada has paved the way for
a negotiated settlement, Israelis, they say, must ask
themselves "what life will be like in a country that is
preoccupied with suppressing a large part of the population
living within its borders."</p>
<p>Yet the uprising has ceased to preoccupy Israel. Talk
these days turns excitedly to the influx of Soviet Jews, the
need for electoral reform, the nefarious intentions of Iraq's
Saddam Hussein. By avoiding West Bank roadways, forgoing the
convenience of shopping in cheaper Arab "souqs" and the
pleasure of dining in the graceful stone precincts of Arab
East Jerusalem, most Israelis have reduced contact with the
intifada to an uncomfortable awareness that part of military
service now includes a stint of riot control in the occupied
lands. And short of some visionary leadership on either the
Israeli or the Palestinian side, that isn't enough to compel
a settlement.</p>
<p>And many don't think it should. Like the government of
Israel, the Washington D.C.-based authors Neil C. Livingstone
and David Halevy seem to have a policy of refusing to talk to
the PLO. Indeed, accuracy should require that their "Inside
the PLO: Covert Wars, Secret Funds and the War Against Israel
and the United States" (William Morrow, 288 pages, $18.95) be
retitled. "Outside the PLO" would be a good deal more
appropriate for a book that draws whatever marginal amount of
new information it offers almost exclusively from unnamed
"intelligence officials" -- mostly U.S. and Israeli.
Otherwise the authors draw on newspaper articles and
published works on terrorism.</p>
<p>The authors state that the book initially was envisioned
as "a modest monograph" detailing PLO actions against the
U.S., and that catalog of horrors remains its centerpiece.
But in trying to deal with all the PLO's factions as well as
its putative links with Abu Nidal and Hezbollah, the authors
too often rest their case on cobwebs of thin research.</p>
<p>For example, the chapter on George Habash, leader of the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, is titled
"Yesterday's Man." But recent conversations with Palestinians
-- both inside the Israeli-occupied territories and in
influential outside communities such as Kuwait's -- indicate
that the soft-spoken doctor, who feels armed struggle is the
Palestinian's only long-term hope, is more likely than ever
to emerge as tomorrow's hero.</p>
<p>So far, Mr. Arafat's strategy strikes many of the
dispossessed Palestinian young to have failed bitterly, and
it is to an uneasy alliance of Dr. Habash's secular,
left-wing faction and the Islamic extremists that more and
more eyes are turning.</p>
