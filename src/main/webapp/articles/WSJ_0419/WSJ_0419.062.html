	<p class="article-leader">AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines, reported a
first-quarter net loss of $19.3 million, its first quarterly
deficit in more than two years.
   A poor showing had been expected. AMR's vocal chairman,
Robert L. Crandall, had publicly warned that the company's
first-quarter results wouldn't come close to last year's $101
million profit. AMR's per-share loss was 31 cents, compared
with year-earlier profit of $1.60 a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Nonetheless, in a statement, Mr. Crandall said he was
"very disappointed" with the loss. "Our results can only be
called unsatisfactory," he said.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
AMR stock closed at $64.50, down 87.5 cents.</p>
<p>AMR's results are frequently the bellwether for the
industry, with the company's profits higher and losses
narrower than those of its competitors. First-quarter results
of other carriers are likely to run true to this form,
analysts said.</p>
<p>"It's going to be a bad quarter for everybody," said
Thomas Longman, an analyst with Bear, Stearns & Co. Mr.
Longman said he expects losses at other carriers to surpass
AMR's.</p>
<p>At AMR, a 9.7% increase in revenue to $2.69 billion,
couldn't offset sharply higher operating costs. AMR was
squeezed by higher fuel prices, soft travel demand and static
fares. Plus, the first quarter is traditionally the weakest
period in the airline industry because the span is sandwiched
between peak holiday travel and the busy summer months.</p>
<p>While the company's load factor, or percentage of seats
filled, held steady at 59.9%, its break-even load factor was
60.6%, compared with last year's 54.8%.</p>
<p>Currently, many of the factors that made for a rough first
quarter seem to be receding. Fuel prices, while not down to
last year's levels, are somewhat lower. Demand is up. Also,
this year's Easter season, always a high-traffic period, was
in the second quarter. That should help offset expected
difficulties airlines may have this quarter making fare
increases stick, Mr. Longman said.</p>
