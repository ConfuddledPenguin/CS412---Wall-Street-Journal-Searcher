	<p class="article-leader">The lukewarm response to the world oil glut by three major
Persian Gulf producers triggered a stunning sell-off in oil
markets.
   Prices plunged as much as 70 cents a barrel yesterday in
the wake of the Tuesday night meeting of the oil ministers of
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>These members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries are held by many to be chiefly responsible for the
excess volumes of oil flowing into world markets at the
moment. As a result, oil-market participants had been
watching closely for any solid evidence that either planned
production cuts.</p>
<p>But a Tuesday night statement released by the trio in
Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, after oil markets had closed packed
little punch. It blamed overproduction for depressing oil
markets and called on OPEC members to abide by their
production quotas.</p>
<p>The joint statement also appealed to non-OPEC producers
not to take advantage of seasonal demand increases to step up
output. And it said the three ministers would continue to
cooperate with their OPEC colleagues in efforts to restore
market stability.</p>
<p>Meantime, a new survey of OPEC's production released
yesterday by the Dow Jones International Petroleum Report
showed total output for last month averaged 23.8 million
barrels a day. That was 1.7 million above the group's
self-imposed production ceiling. Some OPEC members failed to
produce as much as their quotas, but the average from Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates totaled 1.9
million barrels a day.</p>
<p>Some oil analysts had suggested that the meeting of the
Persian Gulf oil ministers was intended to pre-empt a
possible emergency conference of all 13 oil ministers that
has been urged in recent days by others in OPEC as oil prices
plummeted. Whether that was the case or not, the analysts
said lack of concrete action by either of the three Persian
Gulf producers to slow the outpouring of oil from OPEC
further weakens the market.</p>
<p>"The Big Three came up with only a Band-Aid, and it was
too small and too late," said Nauman Barakat, first vice
president of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</p>
<p>Yesterday's sell-off was evident in the Tokyo market and
then gained momentum as other markets opened. In European
spot markets, North Sea crudes fell at the start, ending the
day a sharp 45 cents to 70 cents a barrel lower. Then, West
Texas Intermediate crude for May delivery lost more than 50
cents a barrel in the first 15 minutes of trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange.</p>
<p>The May WTI contract, which has its last trading day
tomorrow, recovered some of the earlier losses but still
ended the day down 48 cents a barrel and below the
psychologically important level of $17. It settled at $16.96
-- the lowest close for a near-month contract since Dec. 29,
1988.</p>
<p>The June WTI contract was down 30 cents to $18.09 a
barrel. Outer month futures closed down 21 cents to 34 cents
a barrel.</p>
<p>Then, as a climax to yesterday's pricing melee, several
U.S. refiners lowered the prices they will pay in the field
for WTI by 75 cents to $15.75 a barrel.</p>
<p>In other commodity markets yesterday:</p>
<p>COFFEE: Futures prices fell on the expectation that Brazil
will soon begin actively shipping coffee. The July contract
ended near the low of the day, with a loss of 2.97 cents a
pound at 94.89 cents. Brazil today or tomorrow is expected to
open the registration of coffee to be exported for the next
year, said Sandra Kaul, analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton,
New York. Shipments are expected to begin immediately, she
said. The expected development caused selling in futures
because Brazil is believed to still have some seven million
bags of coffee from the 1989-90 crop and is expected to begin
harvesting the 1990-91 crop next month, she said. The
expected coffee exports "will be coming when the industry is
entering the slower-consuming summertime period, when demand
for green coffee seasonally is substantially reduced," she
said.</p>
<p>SUGAR: Futures prices closed higher despite late
profit-taking that trimmed advances. The July contract
settled with a gain of 0.34 cent a pound to 15.56 cents after
trading as high as 15.69 cents. Some traders thought that raw
sugar supplies will be tightening in the near future because
of lower output from Cuba and Thailand, according to one
analyst. Also, the analyst noted, it won't be until June when
Southern Hemisphere nations, such as Brazil, Australia, South
Africa and Mauritius, will begin to harvest their crops. In
addition, the market was supported by the purchase of about
20,000 tons of refined sugar by Syria for May shipment and
reports that Iran had bought 10,000 to 30,000 tons of refined
sugar, analysts said. According to one sugar dealer, the
Soviet Union is expected to come into the market at some time
despite concluding an agreement with Cuba that will involve
the exchange of Cuban sugar for Soviet goods. China is also a
potential buyer in the world market because Cuban exports to
that country this year have fallen short of expectations, he
said.</p>
<p>LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Prices of most cattle futures
contracts settled slightly higher as traders began to take to
the sidelines in anticipation of a government survey of
feedlots, which is slated for release tomorrow. Charles
Levitt, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton, Chicago, said
he expects the report to show that a large number of cattle
will be ready for slaughter in May and June. These cattle
were placed into feedlots at an unusually young age late last
year when dry weather damaged much of the grazing lands in
the Southern Plains. Feedlots fatten cattle for slaughter.
According to Mr. Levitt, the report might show that 6.2
million cattle might be sold by the feedlots in the second
quarter to slaughterhouses -- a record level of sales for any
second quarter. The movement of young cattle to feedlots has
slowed considerably in recent months as pasture conditions
have improved. Mr. Levitt said he expects the government to
report that placements of young cattle onto feedlots dropped
10% in March from the year-earlier month. Nonetheless, the
government is expected to report that it counted about 10
million cattle on feedlots in its 13-state quarterly survey
on April 1, up 1% from the year-earlier date. Prices of hog
futures contracts settled mixed.</p>
