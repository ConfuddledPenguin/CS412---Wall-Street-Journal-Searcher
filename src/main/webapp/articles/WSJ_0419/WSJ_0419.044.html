	<p class="article-leader">CORPORATE WASTE is a growing market in the recycling
business.
   More companies are separating their garbage as recycling
programs take hold. "For years we tried to solicit their
business," says Neil Kossis of Atlas Waste Paper Corp.,
Pittsburgh. Now soaring landfill costs are making companies
think again, he says. Procter & Gamble Co. tests recycling of
office paper, cardboard and aluminum cans. Corning Inc. says
it will start an inhouse program within six months.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Environmental concern is one motivation, but many programs
also make money. BankAmerica Corp. nets about $175,000 a year
on its paper-recycling. McKesson Corp. uses the revenue from
its paper program -- $1,344 last month -- for community
programs and philanthropy. Some 600 New York corporations now
recycle cans through WE CAN, a non-profit group that uses the
five-cent-per-can bounty to help the poor and the
environment. Tax deductions for the nickel-a-can donation
"can be substantial," says WE CAN founder Guy Polhemus.</p>
<p>Typically it is a concerned secretary, not an executive,
who instigates corporate recycling, Mr. Polhemus says.</p>
<p>HOME GARDENERS show few signs of going organic.</p>
<p>Garden centers are stocking more organic supplies, but
they aren't cutting back on the chemical side. If
alternatives don't work, they say, customers will be back for
their old standbys. People are "definitely" reading labels
more carefully, says Jerry Armstrong of Village Green Plant &
Garden Center, Chicago. But most aren't changing their buying
habits, says Betty Jackson of Frank's Nursery & Garden
Center, Philadelphia. "People are coming in and buying the
same dandelion preventer as usual."</p>
<p>In Atlanta, a warm winter coupled with heavy spring rains
has created a boom market for pesticides and other chemicals.
Customers there couldn't care less about toxicity, local
nurserymen say. They just want something to kill the bugs,
weeds and fungi. "I'm selling three cases of Dacanil a week
just to fight black spot," says Randy Kucera of Randy's
Nursery & Greenhouses, Lawrenceville, Ga. Still, Chalet
Nursery & Garden Shop in Wilmette, Ill., expects organic
gardening to finally catch on this year.</p>
<p>CLEANER FUELS hit the road as demonstration projects gain
ground.</p>
<p>With some 780 methanol and flexible-fuel vehicles in
operation, California now claims the largest alternative-fuel
fleets in the country. "And they will soon expand
dramatically," with the addition of some 5,000 flexible-fuel
vehicles, says Charles Imbrecht, chairman of the California
Energy Commission. New York State tests compressed natural
gas vehicles in Tonawanda's town fleet. The U.S. government
gets set to order the first of several thousand flexible-fuel
vehicles for its own demonstration.</p>
<p>"Things are starting to happen and more things will
happen," says Carmine Difiglio, acting director of the
federal office of energy demand policy. He sees commercial
fleets -- such as overnight-mail services -- phasing in such
vehicles around 1994. Californians, he says, will probably be
the first to feel the push for alternative fuels at the
consumer level.</p>
<p>Flexible-fuel vehicles -- which use either gas or alcohol
-- will ease the transition to other fuels, says Albert
Chesnes of the Department of Energy.</p>
<p>A GOOD FLORIST is hard to find long distance. That's the
premise of "Fine Flowers by Phone," a new guide by Barbera
Brooks, which offers brief reviews -- complete with style
descriptions and minimum prices -- of 300 floral "artists" in
250 cities.</p>
<p>DANGLING DIAMONDS: To ease demand for Saturday night
wedding receptions, the Mayflower Hotel, Plymouth, Mich.,
offers a pair of $500 diamond earrings to any couple that
books a Friday night reception for 125 people or more. Also
included: an appraisal certificate.</p>
<p>ISSUE ORIENTED: Ohio-based insurer Progressive Corp.
devotes its annual report to the issue of drunken driving,
commissioning eight artists to create works on the theme.
McDonald's Corp. devotes its report to the environment,
printing it on paper recycled from its offices and suppliers.</p>
<p>RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES find funds for buildings in a novel
type of bond.</p>
<p>Faced with a need for new research facilities, some
schools are issuing bonds backed by research-related
revenues, such as rents, interest on grant funds and
reimbursements for overhead costs. Standard & Poor's Corp.
says it has rated only a handful of such tax-exempt issues.
"But interest from other universities is expected to rise as
research activity and the need to expand facilities
increase," says S&P's Lisa Danzig.</p>
<p>Utah State University is just completing a new
biotechnology building financed with such bonds. "We will be
able to attract better qualified people and they in turn,
because they have the facilities, will attract contracts and
grants," says Bartell Jensen, Utah State's vice president for
research. The University of Colorado is about to issue $13.4
million in bonds to build new facilities, including a home
for the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics.</p>
<p>The technique isn't for every school. Tax problems could
result if buildings house much corporate research, says Linda
Fan of Morgan Stanley.</p>
<p>BRIEFS: Europe in 1792 is the theme of the Harvard
Business School Show entitled "Les Bizerables." . . . The
National Anxiety Center, Maplewood, N.J., announces an Earth
Day Anxiety Alert for people afraid of overdosing on
environmental hype.</p>
