	<p class="article-leader">MINNEAPOLIS -- John F. Grundhofer says he just hates to
criticize his predecessors in top management at First Bank
System Inc. But, apparently, not as much as he hates what
they did.
   "It was out of control," the banking concern's new
chairman, president and chief executive officer says in an
interview 10 weeks into the job. A former vice chairman at
Wells Fargo & Co., where cost-cutting is a religion, Mr.
Grundhofer says he quickly grew irritated at First Bank's
spending habits. "There were some real silly things going on
around here. Anybody could sign approval for expenses."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Grundhofer, who is called Jack, succeeded D.H. Ankeny
Jr., who quit last September after presiding over huge bond
market and lending forays at First Bank. Mr. Ankeny, who says
he doesn't want to discuss the past, wasn't known as a penny
pincher.</p>
<p>But things are quickly changing at once laid-back First
Bank, which owns banks across the upper Midwest. Gone are the
club memberships that every vice president received -- only
officers who need to entertain customers get to keep them.
Gone is the open access to the executive dining room -- also
only for entertaining customers. Other cutbacks include
office plants, company cars and company-paid newspaper
subscriptions.</p>
<p>In their place, for now, there is fear. "There's a high
level of anxiety for everybody," says William Farley, who
perhaps represents Mr. Grundhofer's strongest rebuke of
former management. Mr. Farley, then president of the
company's flagship Minneapolis bank, was fired by Mr. Ankeny
in 1988 after he criticized the company's huge bond position,
which ultimately led to a half-billion dollar loss. A
well-regarded manager of consumer and electronic banking
businesses, Mr. Farley was rehired within weeks of Mr.
Grundhofer's arrival, as a vice chairman of the parent
company.</p>
<p>Mr. Grundhofer is in the process of letting go hundreds of
employees, from executive vice presidents on down, and plans
to eliminate the duplication of staffs that existed at the
holding company and lead bank. He hasn't wasted time. Hired
on a Tuesday, he closed the purchase of a house that
Thursday, took home a load of loan files over the weekend,
and began firing people the following Monday.</p>
<p>"It's hard to improve morale when you're cutting costs,"
Mr. Grundhofer says. "Offsetting the hatchet image," he
hopes, "is the fact that I understand banking." So, he says
he's also hard at work on growth strategies: "What are we
going to do after this holocaust?"</p>
<p>Given First Bank's past, and the need for severe
cost-cutting, says Richard Ferry, the headhunter who
recruited Mr. Grundhofer on behalf of the company's board,
"you couldn't help but be led to someone in the Wells Fargo
system."</p>
<p>First Bank will pay Mr. Grundhofer about $1.4 million to
buy him out of Wells Fargo options and other benefits he
would have received, and his 1990 salary and bonus will be at
least $787,500, according to his employment contract.</p>
<p>Under Mr. Ankeny and his predecessor, George Dixon, First
Bank spent much of the 1980s behaving as if it were too big
for -- and bored by -- its home markets, which include the
Dakotas and Montana. The bank's executives put little
emphasis on building the consumer-banking business they
inherited, at times siphoning off huge amounts of deposits
from the company's little banks -- first to fund a national
lending binge, and then to help fund the $8 billion bond
market position that went awry.</p>
<p>Mr. Farley says the company was overtaken by a "trading
mentality. `Today I'll take your deposits. Tomorrow I don't
want them.' You can't run a consumer business that way."</p>
<p>Mr. Grundhofer calls the consumer business "very
underutilized. The company under the previous management
didn't pay any attention to the consumer." He plans to
streamline the number of consumer-banking products First
Bank's units offer, and then gear up the troops to do what
Wells Fargo has been so successful at doing: selling.</p>
<p>Fewer than 25% of the company's customers carry its Visa
or MasterCards, a highly profitable product. And other
consumer loan products haven't been pushed enough, Mr.
Grundhofer says. "We need to sell more."</p>
<p>That won't be as easy as he had hoped, in part because
under Mr. Ankeny the company sold off a bunch of its smallest
banks, in large part to rid itself of its then-troubled
exposure to the farm economy. Since then, agricultural
lending has again become quite profitable. "In hindsight,
this franchise would be even more valuable if we still had
those," Mr. Grundhofer says.</p>
<p>The firing and cutting and fixing will easily take all of
1990, which Mr. Grundhofer calls "a throwaway year." For now,
he won't worry about the stock price, languishing in the
low-to-mid teens. Yesterday, in composite trading on the New
York Stock Exchange, its common closed at $13.25, off 25
cents.</p>
<p>Mr. Grundhofer won't say whether the quarterly dividend,
already halved to 20.5 cents a share, is safe. It's up for
review next month by the board, and eliminating it could send
the stock still lower.</p>
<p>The company yesterday reported first-quarter profit of
$28.5 million, or 37 cents a share, against $50.3 million, or
77 cents a share, the year earlier. While problem real estate
and leveraged buy-out loans rose, the quarter didn't include
yet another big addition to First Bank's reserves for loan
losses, as some had expected. Mr. Grundhofer, however,
doesn't rule out such an addition later in the year, though
one isn't currently expected. "I have to tell you: volatility
in the {loan} portfolio is still there."</p>
<p>First Bank's nonperforming assets, which include loans
delinquent 90 days or more and other troubled credits, rose
about 16% during the quarter to $368.3 million.</p>
<p>With all the firings, Mr. Grundhofer is in the market for
a few good bankers, including a top commercial lending
officer, and on one issue the tough new boss is flexible:
"Titles are not a problem. This company has more damn titles.
Whatever he wants, we can give him."</p>
