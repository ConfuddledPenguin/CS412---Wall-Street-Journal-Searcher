	<p class="article-leader">Shares of CAE Industries Ltd. fell sharply after a
Binghamton, N.Y., newspaper reported that a grand jury had
been convened to investigate accusations against a unit of
the Toronto-based maker of electronics and aviation
equipment.
   A CAE spokesman said he believes a grand jury has been
empaneled, but wouldn't elaborate. CAE shares closed
yesterday at 6.375 Canadian dollars (US$5.47), down 87.5
Canadian cents, in trading on the Toronto stock exchange.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>CAE's Link Flight Simulation unit in Binghamton is the
subject of a previously reported civil suit, alleging that
the flight simulator maker submitted more than $77 million in
fraudulent and inflated claims against the U.S. government
between 1980 and 1988. CAE bought Link in 1988 for $560
million from the former Singer Co., Stamford, Conn., now
Bicoastal Corp., Tampa, Fla. CAE declined to comment on
details of that suit, but said Link's former owner would have
to indemnify it for claims arising from activities before the
acquisition.</p>
