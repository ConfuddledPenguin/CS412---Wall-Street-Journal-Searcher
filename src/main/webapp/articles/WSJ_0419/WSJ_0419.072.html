	<p class="article-leader">From a March 13 speech to the Cato Institute in Washington
by Carl Hagen, leader of the Norwegian Progress Party:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As communism is being destroyed in Eastern Europe, social
democrats all over the world are urging the new regimes to
adopt a Scandinavian welfare-state model, and not a pure
free-market system. Having lived most of my life in this
utopia, "the most perfect of all systems," as our domestic
social democrats love to describe it, I take a somewhat
different position. . . . In our countries people are growing
disillusioned, and no longer believe the welfare state can
deliver what it promised. At the same time, the moral hazards
of the system are beginning to show. The Scandinavian welfare
state has little to offer either East or West. Do not adopt a
model we are moving away from.</p>

<p>From a posthumous book by former university professor W.W.
Bartley III, "Unfathomed Knowledge, Unmeasured Wealth," to be
published by Open Court Press this year:</p>
<p>For certain kinds of groups, universities are handy places
in which to have a strong redoubt. They are handy for groups
that are not competitive, that are peddling ideas for which
there is little demand, ideas that do not work, that fail to
explain, and whose proponents are consciously or
unconsciously tempted to turn them into ideologies in order
to perpetuate themselves or further the groups to which they
belong.</p>
