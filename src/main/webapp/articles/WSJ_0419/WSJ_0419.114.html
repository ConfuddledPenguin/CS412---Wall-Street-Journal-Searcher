	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Military-spending provisions of the House
Budget Committee chairman's deficit-reduction blueprint ran
into dissension among members of his own Democratic Party.
   Only a few hours after House Speaker Thomas Foley
predicted that the fiscal 1991 budget resolution would pass
the House, committee Democrats huddled in private to discuss
vigorous demands by angry liberals that part of the military
spending budget be reduced even further than Chairman Leon
Panetta (D., Calif.) had recommended. Committee members gave
strong indications last evening that the spending-authority
portion of the military budget would be reduced.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But that change, if made, could alienate conservative
members of the Democratic Party and create additional
problems for the budget blueprint. The committee has
scheduled a drafting session for today to discuss the
document. The Republican minority on the committee is
expected to oppose the Panetta plan entirely, leaving its
fate fully in the hands of the Democrats. Whatever the
committee decides, amendments could also be made on the House
floor.</p>
<p>As expected, the Panetta proposal calls for a cut in
military outlays of $11.5 billion and a tax increase of $13.9
billion.</p>
<p>The contentious element in the military-spending debate is
a category separate from outlays, called spending authority.
The Panetta plan would set spending authority at $286
billion; the liberals are aiming to trim that number to $283
billion, which would have the effect of reducing outlays, or
actual expenditures, in future years. Actual military
spending under the Panetta plan would total $295 billion in
fiscal 1991, which starts Oct. 1.</p>
<p>The military-spending level is only one hurdle faced by
Rep. Panetta. The other is that it remains unclear at best
how much of the blueprint will ultimately be translated into
law. More than half the $36.2 billion in the deficit
reduction proposed in the document, including all of the tax
increase, is contingent on negotiations with President Bush,
and, so far at least, neither the president nor the
Democratic leaders in Congress have shown much more than
rhetorical interest in compromise.</p>
<p>The goal of the budget resolution is to lay out a
blueprint for spending and tax legislation by other
committees. It is designed to reduce the deficit in fiscal
1991 to $64 billion from the projected deficit of $100.5
billion that would occur without new legislation.</p>
<p>The resolution doesn't require the president's signature,
but Democrats made clear it will require his acquiescence if
it is to be put into effect. Speaking of talks with the
president, Speaker Foley, a Washington Democrat, said, "There
is a sense that we may become more engaged later on."</p>
<p>In the meantime, Rep. Panetta, backed by the House
Democratic leadership, offered a plan yesterday that gets the
bulk of its savings from a combination of militaryspending
reductions that are deeper than the White House wants, and
tax increases that haven't yet been negotiated with a
president who is reluctant at best to accept any.</p>
<p>In addition, the plan claims $9.1 billion in savings from
an amorphous cluster of proposals that are almost solely
reliant on actions by the executive branch and that
congressional Democrats had previously derided as illusory.
They include, for example, a $3 billion savings from a
reorganization of the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
<p>The Panetta plan covers fiscal year 1991, but it also
purports to make recommendations for budget savings over five
years. It also urges removal of the Social Security trust
fund from the regular budget-deficit calculation under the
Gramm-Rudman law. Legislation to authorize that change is
likely to come later this year, Mr. Panetta said.</p>
<p>The Panetta plan is the Democrats' first detailed response
to President Bush's own budget plan. Compared with the
president's plan, the Panetta plan seeks almost $8 billion
less in military outlays, far fewer cuts in nonmilitary
spending, especially in Medicare and farm subsidies, and also
recommends $6 billion in new spending on programs ranging
from child care to space exploration. Rep. Panetta said it
represents a transition from "a Cold War economy to a
peacetime economy."</p>
<p>The Senate Budget Committee, its work delayed by the
funeral in Hawaii of Sen. Spark Matsunaga, is planning to
begin work on its budget resolution next week.</p>
