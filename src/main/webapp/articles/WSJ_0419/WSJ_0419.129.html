	<p class="article-leader">SEEQ Technology Inc., San Jose, Calif., said slumping
prices for its basic line of erasable programmable chips
resulted in a loss of $4.5 million, or 35 cents a share, in
its second quarter ended March 31.
   In the year-earlier quarter, the computer chip maker
posted a profit of $722,000, or six cents a share. Revenue
for the latest period slumped 25% to $11.5 million from $15.5
million a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>SEEQ said the declines reflect "continued competitive
pricing pressure" on its Eeproms, or electrically erasable
programmable read-only memories. These are specialized chips
-- with military, telecommunications and industrial
applicationsthat can be erased and reprogrammed for varied
uses. Despite the poor quarterly showing, SEEQ said it was
"encouraged" by a substantial increase in Eeprom orders in
the latter part of the quarter.</p>
<p>For the six months, SEEQ posted a loss of $5.6 million, or
43 cents a share, compared with net of $1.8 million, or 14
cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 20% to $23.8
million from $30 million.</p>
