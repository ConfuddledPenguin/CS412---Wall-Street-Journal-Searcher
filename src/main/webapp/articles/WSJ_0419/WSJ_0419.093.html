	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Unicorp Canada Corp. suspended its dividend on
common shares after reporting a big loss for the year, and
said it plans to spin off its controlling stake in ailing
Unicorp American Corp. to its shareholders.
   The company paid a dividend of five cents (Canadian) on
its Class A and B shares on Feb. 28 for the fourth quarter.
Unicorp said the moves were part of a restructuring in which
it will focus on non-regulated energy and utility operations
and strengthening its capital base. Unicorp Canada also plans
a common-share rights offering of C$40 million to C$50
million (US$34.3 million to $42.9 million).</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Unicorp reported a loss of C$151.2 million, or C$7.94 a
share, in 1989, compared with a profit of C$42.2 million, or
C$1.24 a share, in 1988. Last year's loss included a C$137.6
million provision for losses on disposal of discontinued U.S.
real estate and financial services operations and a reserve
against its entire investment in Unicorp American.</p>
<p>Unicorp Canada said it is in negotiations to sell most of
its Unicorp American properties to a joint venture in which
Unicorp American will have a significant interest. Unicorp
also said its investment in Lincoln Savings Bank was added to
discontinued operations.</p>
<p>Under its plan to distribute all of its common shares of
Unicorp American to holders of Unicorp Canada Class A and B
common shares, shareholders will receive about two-fifths of
a Unicorp American share for each share of Unicorp Canada.
The distribution is subject to regulatory approvals and is
planned for the third quarter.</p>
<p>"We've chosen to write the entire investment off and
dividend it out to our shareholders," said James Leech,
president of Unicorp Canada.</p>
<p>Unicorp Canada said the distribution will separate its
energy and non-energy operations, but it will continue to
assist Unicorp American in devising its own restructuring
plan. On Tuesday, Unicorp American said it was trying to
restructure a loan agreement that was already in default and
needed an infusion of US$15 million in new funds to continue
operations. Unicorp American is 75%-owned by Unicorp Canada.
Its shares closed yesterday at 37.5 cents, down 37.5 cents,
in American Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
<p>Unicorp Canada's restructuring raises speculation that
Hees International Bancorp Inc. eventually could end up with
control of the company. Unicorp Canada is a holding company
with operations in energy, financial services, real estate
and merchant banking. It controls Canada's second-largest
utility, Union Gas Ltd., and is involved in gas marketing and
transportation. In January, Hees International, a merchant
bank and holding company controlled by Toronto financiers
Peter and Edward Bronfman, acquired a 22% stake in Unicorp
Canada and supports its restructuring. Hees is Unicorp
Canada's second-largest shareholder after George Mann, its
founder and chairman.</p>
<p>Hees insiders said they would be willing to accept
stewardship of Unicorp Canada if Mr. Mann eventually was
willing to hand it over. Mr. Mann recently had a heart attack
and indications are that, at some point, he may retire.</p>
<p>The Hees insiders said that Unicorp's utility operations
could fit with those of Brascan Ltd., a natural resources,
financial services and consumer products concern that is
49%-owned by Hees.</p>
