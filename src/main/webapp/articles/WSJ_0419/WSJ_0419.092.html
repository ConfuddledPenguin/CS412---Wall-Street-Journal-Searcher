	<p class="article-leader">BRASILIA, Brazil -- Confident that its bold anti-inflation
program is working, the Brazilian government plans to resume
negotiations on its $115 billion foreign debt and start its
drive to sell state companies in the coming weeks, senior
officials said.
   In separate interviews here, Economics Minister Zelia
Cardoso de Mello and Central Bank President Ibrahim Eris said
the government, after winning the endorsement of Brazil's
Congress last week for its stabilization program, will begin
a "new phase" of the program, which will include:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>-- Resumption of negotiations with Brazil's foreign
creditors, beginning with the International Monetary Fund, as
early as next month. But officials say Brazil will adopt a
"tough stance."</p>
<p>-- The start next month of the government's ambitious plan
to sell most of Brazil's 188 state-controlled companies,
which have a combined deficit of $62 billion. Ms. Cardoso
said the program would start with Usiminas, a profitable
steelmaker.</p>
<p>-- Efforts to start lowering the non-tariff barriers that
have effectively shielded the Brazilian economy from
competition.</p>
<p>-- The dismantling in the weeks ahead of most of the price
controls the government imposed last month as part of its
anti-inflation program. Mr. Eris says the controls contradict
the government's freemarket aims and are "redundant" because
of the anti-inflation plan's initial success.</p>
<p>Indeed, the unveiling of the new phase of the plan
coincides with indications that Brazil's chronic inflation,
which reached 4,854% in the past 12 months, could be on the
way out. Because of the huge liquidity squeeze that forms the
centerpiece of the plan -- the government took about $80
billion out of circulation by freezing a large part of
savings and money market accounts for 18 months -- Brazil
expects to post negative inflation of between 0.5% and 1% for
the 30-day period since the the program was unveiled March
16.</p>
<p>Ms. Cardoso said the figure shows the plan is "working
well" and added that she saw "no reason why inflation should
return" even though the government is prepared to reinject
money in the economy to help the beleaguered automobile,
construction and capital-goods industries.</p>
<p>But Mr. Eris, striking a more cautionary note echoed by
many economists, says Brazil runs the risk of falling into
recession or returning to high inflation unless the economy
is properly tuned.</p>
<p>Walter Barelli, an economist affiliated with a Brazilian
union research organization, disputed the government's
estimate of zero inflation and predicted steep price
increases.</p>
<p>On Brazil's foreign debt of $115 billion, the developing
world's largest, Ms. Cardoso said she would resume contacts
with creditors by attending the IMF's interim committee
meeting in Washington in early May. Brazil hasn't paid
interest on its $65 billion of medium-term and long-term bank
debt since September. That failure in the past several days
helped to depress the first-quarter earnings of big U.S.
banks.</p>
<p>But Mr. Eris warned creditors against expecting much from
Brazil. "Brazil's stance will be tough," he said.
"Arrangements can be flexible as long as they're compatible
with our payments capacity. Brazil needs to grow without
inflation," he added, "and for that we need savings and
investment rates comparable to those of other countries."</p>
<p>Ms. Cardoso said reports that Brazil would limit its
payments to about $5 billion a year were reasonable. However,
it isn't clear how the payments would be distributed among
Brazil's multilateral, government and bank creditors.</p>
<p>By unveiling plans to sell off Usiminas next month, Ms.
Cardoso indicated the government intends to move fast to kick
off its privatization campaign and address charges that the
private sector bears the burden of the adjustment plan. Mr.
Eris said many other sales are planned.</p>
<p>"Everything is on sale except a few companies," such as
oil giant Petrobras and the Banco do Brasil commercial bank,
which have to remain in the public sector under the
privatization bill, Mr. Eris said. "And I don't only mean the
companies," he added. "I mean houses, buildings and cars
owned by the state too."</p>
<p>On foreign trade, Mr. Eris said the government hopes to
eliminate all controls on imports by the end of the year,
maintaining tariffs only as a policy instrument.</p>
