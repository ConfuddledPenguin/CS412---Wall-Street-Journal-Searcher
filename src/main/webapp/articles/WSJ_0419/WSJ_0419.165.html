	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- It promises to be a stormy end to a stormy
struggle. If it really does finally end.
   Allegheny International Inc. will duke it out in
bankruptcy court today with a brash hostile suitor, the
latest in a line of would-be buyers. To the victor will go
the dubious pleasure of trying to lead back to health what
remains of the once-stellar maker of Sunbeam toasters and
Oster blenders.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Allegheny faces its most combative adversary so far,
Japonica Partners. The partners, two former Goldman Sachs
merger specialists, have acquired enough bank claims to make
them the largest creditor. Their goal: to take over Allegheny
for $655 million in cash.</p>
<p>It won't be pretty. Allegheny is seething over Japonica's
acquiring of the bank claims at a discount. And the Japonica
partners, two New York investors given to showing up at
meetings tieless and in baseball caps, have shown their
aggressive ways. They complained to Pennsylvania's legal
disciplinary board about the conduct of Allegheny's chief
bankruptcy lawyer. Then they wrote to Allegheny's lead lender
to suggest that a bank executive working on the case was
emotionally exhausted, say people familiar with the letter.
(A Japonica lawyer will say only that the letters speak for
themselves.)</p>
<p>For the battle-weary appliance maker, this will be the
10th attempt to emerge from Chapter 11 since it filed for
protection from creditors two years ago. Nine other
reorganization plans have fizzled. Creditor groups have been
suing each other. At one point, the shareholder group backed
three different reorganization plans in the space of a week.
Suitors have been entertained and dropped by the company,
while its business and its stock price faded.</p>
<p>Now Allegheny's fate seems finally ready to be resolved.
And who will end up with control? "The smart money is so
frustrated with this case that it's no longer in the betting
mood," says Wilbur Ross of Rothschild Inc., who represents
Allegheny's unsecured creditors.</p>
<p>The Allegheny story is a study of corporate mayhem and
bungled opportunities. The company was near ruin four years
ago when former chairman Robert J. Buckley quit amid
allegations that he had squandered corporate funds on shaky
real estate investments and even his own wine cellar. He left
behind $500 million in debt at the company, along with
devastated employees and a spate of shareholder lawsuits.
(The litigation includes a libel suit Mr. Buckley has filed
disputing the allegations.)</p>
<p>A new management, headed by Oliver S. Travers, was brought
in. The low-key, 63-year-old chairman quickly sold a fleet of
jets and a company-owned mansion, dismissed chauffeurs and
froze executive salaries. To reduce the suffocating debt, he
also began shedding misfit operations like industrial magnets
and titanium.</p>
<p>But it wasn't enough, and two years ago Allegheny ducked
into the bankruptcy court, hoping to emerge in less than a
year, stronger and relieved of the debt. This might have been
a garden-variety bankruptcy; there were no asbestos claims,
huge pension liabilities or militant unions involved. Instead
it has been more like a series of hostile takeover attempts,
with creditors, shareholders and management doing the
Virginia Reel, switching partners at seemingly every turn.</p>
<p>Allegheny followed suitor Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette
Securities to the altar three times without getting hitched.
It adamantly refused to break up operations one month, then
agreed to sell Sunbeam and Oster to rival Black & Decker the
next.</p>
<p>"This case has had more twists and turns and
disappointments than any in recent memory," says Mr. Ross,
who has also worked on the LTV, Drexel Burnham and Eastern
Airlines bankruptcy cases.</p>
<p>Not only couldn't this gang shoot straight, but some of
them were greedy to boot. Soon after Allegheny filed for
bankruptcy protection, six bidders dangled various deals
promising to pay virtually everyone in cash. But for
creditors, cash then became a mantra; they wanted 100 cents
on the dollar, plus interest and attorneys' fees too. As for
shareholders, who are often lucky to get any equity in a
reorganized company, they howled when offered only 40% of a
new Allegheny.</p>
<p>"People had unusually high expectations," says Robert
Sable, an attorney representing unsecured creditors. "In
bankruptcy," he warns, "you never say it'll be quick and
easy, and you never say you can pay 100 cents" on the dollar.</p>
<p>Allegheny has watched opportunity after opportunity for
turnaround parade by. In 1987, after the Buckley turmoil but
before the bankruptcy filing, First Boston Corp. offered to
buy the company for $500 million cash. Allegheny executives
eagerly worked to consummate a deal they thought was too good
to be true.</p>
<p>But some shareholders didn't think it was good enough. The
New York investor group of Spear, Leeds & Kellogg began
socking away Allegheny preferred stock, and soon said that
unless First Boston upped the ante, it wasn't going to tender
its shares. The investor turned out to be overplaying its
hand: Instead of offering more, First Boston walked.</p>
<p>Allegheny management was stunned. "It was as if someone
let all the air out of the balloon," says a former Allegheny
executive. "From then on, things went downhill." Banks
tightened credit terms. Financial worries pushed aside
marketing and product development concerns. Key executives
left. Today Allegheny holds the distinction of having the
worst return to investors over a 10-year period among Fortune
500 companies. The common stock that First Boston offered to
buy at $24.60 a share in 1987 now trades at 50 cents.</p>
<p>"The guys at First Boston should be buying Spear Leeds a
case of champagne every day for the rest of their lives,"
says Paul Levy, a New York investor.</p>
<p>An official of Spear Leeds, which lost millions on its
Allegheny investment before reducing its stake last fall,
angrily resists blame. The shareholder group "didn't lead the
company into bankruptcy," he says. "Equity had nothing to do
with managing the company. We backed whatever plan we felt
would maximize the value."</p>
<p>A year after the First Boston deal fell through, Allegheny
entered bankruptcy proceedings. It said it was on a "fast
track" and would emerge by the end of 1988.</p>
<p>But it jumped the track. Within months, management lost
several board seats to Spear Leeds in a proxy fight. New
directors defied management and company advisers,
complicating efforts to agree on a reorganization plan or
takeover. Management couldn't rein them in.</p>
<p>Consider Allegheny's fumbling of a hefty $812 million
Donaldson Lufkin offer. Management was all set to sign a
definitive merger agreement at a December 1988 board meeting.
But Spear Leeds directors pushed for a delay to consider a
last-minute rival plan, and accused various board members of
being DLJ stooges. Finally, other directors decided to
adjourn the meeting until January.</p>
<p>DLJ representatives, waiting in a conference room to shake
hands on the deal they thought was done, were dumbfounded
when a company lawyer told them of the adjournment. "I said
`What do you mean they just left?' I was absolutely
incredulous," says a senior lawyer close to DLJ. "I've been
doing this for 17 or 18 years and I've never encountered
anything like that."</p>
<p>A board member, Richard P. Farkas, explains that "at that
point we were trying to preserve some value to {shareholders}
just to make it fair."</p>
<p>The adjournment set the stage for another fiasco. For the
next several weeks, a team of directors and Allegheny's
investment banker worked furiously to persuade the
shareholder group led by Spear Leeds not to scuttle the DLJ
offer. At noon Sunday, Jan. 8, 1989, the exhausted crew
celebrated. "We finally had everyone on board," says Nicholas
Sakellariadis, from Allegheny's investment bank, Smith
Barney, Harris Upham.</p>
<p>But unknown to Allegheny, DLJ was also working round the
clock -- to revise its offer. DLJ senior vice president
Lawrence Schloss approached the investor group whose
last-minute rival bid had caused the board adjournment. That
group -- Paul Levy, Angus C. Littlejohn and Peter A. Joseph
-- wanted only Allegheny's lawn-furniture and gas-grill
lines, so DLJ drew up a plan to sell it those businesses.
That way, DLJ could hold down debt and save the crown jewels,
Sunbeam and Oster.</p>
<p>A jubilant Mr. Schloss called Allegheny chairman Travers.
"We said, `We've got terrific news. We finally figured out a
way to do the plan,'" says a member of the DLJ team. "There
was silence. Then {from Mr. Travers}, `Oh no, you guys had
just won. Your original plan was recommended to the board
earlier this afternoon.'"</p>
<p>Though the revised plan had attractive features, Allegheny
directors and executives were furious. They felt DLJ had
betrayed them by cutting a deal behind their back and
changing a plan for which they had painstakingly lined up
support. Worse, DLJ was now setting a tight four-day deadline
and asking a fee of $2 million a month until the agreement
cleared the courts.</p>
<p>DLJ officials tried to make amends, flying to Pittsburgh
for a board meeting. But they were relegated to a conference
room 50 feet from the boardroom and refused an audience
despite handwritten pleas. Finally, Mr. Travers came in and
said the board had rejected the revised offer and had nothing
more to say.</p>
<p>Then DLJ tried hunting down board members at Pittsburgh's
Duquesne Club to explain. Directors wouldn't listen. "They
were trembling with anger," says a DLJ man. Instead of
talking to DLJ, Allegheny sued it to void all agreements.</p>
<p>What followed in 1989 was one try after another at finding
an acceptable reorganization plan. Allegheny, which had
stoutly resisted selling Sunbeam and Oster, suddenly proposed
selling it to Black & Decker. That idea fell through when
those operations soured. Chastened, Allegheny went back to
DLJ. A new deal was struck, but now DLJ required Allegheny to
meet 95% of its own earnings target. It didn't, and that plan
dissolved in May. Then in June came a company plan, which
failed for lack of financial backing. Late summer saw still
another, backed by Wells Fargo & Co. It fell through when the
bank took a close look at Allegheny's operations and withdrew
its lending commitment.</p>
<p>As plan followed plan at Allegheny, tempers flared.
Creditors blamed shareholders for undermining DLJ.
Shareholders called creditors greedy. Unsecured creditors
accused bank creditors of forcing asset sales at distress
prices.</p>
<p>Even bankruptcy judge Joseph Cosetti grew testy. He
likened creditors to a "bunch of surgeons in the operating
room deciding whether we put the legs on backwards or
forwards." At one point he said he wished he could send the
whole courtroom to Charleston for Hurricane Hugo.</p>
<p>With management preoccupied, business decision making
ground to a virtual halt. Competitors took advantage, beefing
up their promotions. Rumors spread that Sunbeam plants might
close. Allegheny lost market share in irons and food
processors.</p>
<p>It also lost executives. Almost the whole management team
of the Almet lawn furniture division switched to a
competitor. At Black & Decker, executives cheered when
Sunbeam's respected marketing vice president, William Smith,
quit.</p>
<p>Then Allegheny's 1989 results came out: a net loss of
$54.9 million, double the year before's, on a 3% sales
decline to $938 million.</p>
<p>Despite all this, Japonica is proposing to pay $655
million in cash for Allegheny. Japonica's gum-chewing
partners, Paul Kazarian, 34, and Michael Lederman, 37, figure
Allegheny operations can generate enough cash to cover
interest payments.</p>
<p>But the unconventional style of the partners, who declined
to be interviewed, hasn't won them many friends in
Pittsburgh. There's their costume, for one thing, favoring
Pittsburgh Steelers caps and unpolished loafers. And during
one deposition, say people who were there, Mr. Kazarian
pulled out a cigar, bit off the tip and spat it out on the
carpet.</p>
<p>Has Japonica the financing to buy Allegheny? When asked in
court to identify its three bank lenders, according to people
present, Japonica's representatives replied: Bank 1, Bank 2,
Bank 3. A Japonica attorney, Herbert P. Minkel Jr., says the
group would have been able to produce financing by now but
has had difficulty getting information from Allegheny. "They
used excuses like the Xerox machine is broken," he says.
Allegheny denies being uncooperative.</p>
<p>In bankruptcy court today, Allegheny will ask the judge to
approve its latest plan, in which it would keep operating
most businesses while paying creditors mostly in stock of a
reorganized company and giving warrants to current
shareholders. In March most creditors and holders approved
this, but Japonica, as the largest creditor, prevented the
needed two-thirds approval. Allegheny wants the court to rule
that Japonica's vote was invalid because the partners didn't
vote in good faith as a creditor, but rather to scuttle the
company plan and clear the way for their takeover bid.</p>
<p>But Japonica wants the court to disallow all the votes for
the company plan. It claims the company has been secretly
offering certain creditors eventual cash for the stock they
would get in a reorganization, thus trying to buy their
votes. Allegheny says this is absurd.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there are indications Japonica might soon come
up with bank commitment letters to back its bid. Even if it
fails, the partners are likely to come out ahead, being paid
more than they spent for the nearly $70 million in bank
claims.</p>
<p>Allegheny executives insist their latest plan is superior
and will prevail. "I believe that the company's plan of
reorganization is a fair one," says Mr. Travers, "and that it
will enable Allegheny to achieve a successful reorganization.
Such a reorganization is now in sight."</p>
<p>But creditors have nightmares about neither plan being
approved, sending everyone back to Square One. "People
involved tell me there seems to be a devil in this case,"
says Mr. Minkel, the Japonica lawyer. "You don't assume
anything."</p>
