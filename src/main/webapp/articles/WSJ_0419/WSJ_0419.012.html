	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- U.S. official reserve assets rose $2.13
billion in March to $76.3 billion, the Treasury Department
said.
   Last month's rise followed a $1.33 billion decline in
reserve assets in February, the department said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>U.S. reserve assets consist of foreign currencies, gold,
Special Drawing Rights at the International Monetary Fund and
the U.S. reserve position, or its ability to draw foreign
currencies, at the IMF.</p>
<p>The nation's holdings of foreign currencies increased
$2.51 billion in March to $46.42 billion, while its gold
reserves were virtually unchanged at $11.06 billion.</p>

fell $124 million to $10.09 billion, and its reserve position
at the IMF dropped $258 million to $8.73 billion.</p>
