	<p class="article-leader">MURRAY HILL, N.J. -- C.R. Bard Inc. reported a 57% decline
in net income for the first quarter, reflecting the
health-care company's temporary withdrawal from the U.S.
market for coronary balloon angioplasty catheters.
   Profit fell to $9.2 million, or 17 cents a share, from
$21.3 million, or 38 cents a share, a year earlier. The
results include a charge of $3.3 million, or six cents a
share, for costs associated with Bard's withdrawal of the
catheters.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales fell 1% to $195.2 million from $197.2 million.</p>
<p>The company recalled one version of the catheter last
August and two versions in February and March. The recalls
came after the Food and Drug Administration and Bard's own
internal inquiries had raised questions about the catheters,
which are used as an alternative to bypass surgery to open
blocked arteries in the heart. A Bard spokesman said the
coronary balloon catheters accounted for between 10% and 15%
of world-wide sales of $777.8 million in 1989.</p>
<p>"This is a disappointing beginning to 1990," said George
T. Maloney, Bard's president and chief executive officer. He
noted strength in Bard's other product groups, which account
for more than 85% of sales. Mr. Maloney said the company is
working with the FDA to regain approval of Bard's balloon
catheters for the U.S. angioplasty market, but he couldn't
say when the approvals might come.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Bard shares closed at $16.50, up 25 cents.</p>
