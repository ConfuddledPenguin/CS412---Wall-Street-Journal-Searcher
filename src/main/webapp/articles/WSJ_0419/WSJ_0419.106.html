	<p class="article-leader">Your March 7 page-one article about the singles night at
the laundromat recalls a song I wrote in 1979 that I titled
"Queen of the Launderette." It would make an excellent
accompaniment to a sudsy wedding service.
   The song was:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Verse I</p>
<p>I went there in the evening at the closing of the day</p>
<p>To do my weekly laundry and to wash my cares away,</p>
<p>And there amid the washers was a girl I can't forget,</p>
<p>The one I'll always think of as my</p>
<p>Queen of the Launderette.</p>
<p>Chorus</p>
<p>When she poured the detergent my wish became urgent</p>
<p>To soft-soap my Queen of the Launderette.</p>
<p>When she loaded the dryer, my heart was on fire</p>
<p>For my Queen of the Launderette.</p>
<p>Some may use smoke rings to summon a dream,</p>
<p>But my sweetest mem'ries rise up with the steam.</p>
<p>Oh, that I had her even now at my side</p>
<p>But when she was finished she went out with the Tide;</p>
<p>That's how I lost her, so I sit here and bawl</p>
<p>For I loaned her a quarter and gave her my All;</p>
<p>My Queen of the Launderette.</p>
<p>Now my tears make it damper as I empty my hamper,</p>
<p>My Queen of the Launderette.</p>
<p>Verse II</p>
<p>Oh the world is full of women with washing to be done,</p>
<p>But in my secret sorrows there is really only one.</p>
<p>And now among the soapsuds there's a</p>
<p>face that haunts me yet,</p>
<p>The one I'll always think of as my</p>
<p>Queen of the Launderette.</p>
