	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- U.S. steel imports declined 16.8% in
February from a year earlier, while steel exports climbed to
one of the highest monthly totals in recent years, according
to the American Iron and Steel Institute.
   The trade group compilation of Commerce Department data
showed U.S imports of steel mill products in February were
1,111,000 tons compared with 1,336,000 a year earlier.
January imports totaled 1,430,000.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Imported steel in February was 15.8% of the total supply
of the U.S. market, compared with 16.8% a year earlier and
17% for the first two months of the year.</p>
<p>February steel exports were 565,000 tons, substantially
higher than both the 237,000 tons a year earlier and 374,000
tons in January.</p>
<p>The American Institute for Imported Steel noted that
imports for the first five months under the new voluntary
restraint agreement were 17.9% of consumption, well below the
U.S. target of 19.1%. The agreement, which went into effect
in October, allows imports to account for 19.1% of
consumption through December 1990 and 20.1% until the program
ends in March 1992.</p>
