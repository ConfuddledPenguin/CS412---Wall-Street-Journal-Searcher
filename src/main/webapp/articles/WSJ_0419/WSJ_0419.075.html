	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A divided Supreme Court, defying
expectations, reaffirmed the broad authority of courts to
correct constitutional violations, ruling that a federal
judge may require the Kansas City school district to raise
taxes to pay for desegregation.
   At the same time, however, the high court said there must
be limits on the enforcement power of federal judges. The
court ruled unanimously that U.S. District Judge Russell
Clark, who is handling the complex Kansas City case, went too
far when he raised the tax rate himself in 1987 instead of
ordering the school board do it.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Despite the court's disagreement with Judge Clark's
methods, the decision yesterday was a surprising civil rights
victory. In a 5-4 decision written by Justice Byron White,
the high court ruled that a federal judge may order school
officials to raise the funds to pay for a desegregation plan
and may block enforcement of state laws limiting tax
increases that interfere with funding the plan.</p>
<p>The ratification of judicial power was unexpected.
Conservatives, including some justices, have criticized what
they deemed to be abuses of federal judicial power. And the
court's growing concern with this issue has been apparent, as
evidenced by its recent decision in the Yonkers, N.Y.,
housing desegregation case. In January, the high court ruled
that a federal judge handling the case had exceeded his
authority by imposing contempt fines on city council members.</p>
<p>Moreover, the high court announced its intention to review
the Kansas City case last spring, as it was issuing a string
of civil rights decisions that substantially limited federal
laws on employment discrimination.</p>
<p>Had the high court ruled that federal courts don't have
the power to require that their orders be funded by state and
local governments, the decision would have limited the
authority of judges, not only to implement school
desegregation plans, but also to set and enforce standards
for prison and jail systems, for state mental institutions
and for other government programs.</p>
<p>Arthur Benson, a Kansas City lawyer who represented black
parents and children challenging the local school system,
said, "This is an important victory for civil rights in
general. It reinforces the broad discretion that federal
courts have to right wrongs."</p>
<p>That broad discretion dismayed Justice Anthony Kennedy,
who wrote a dissenting opinion that was joined by Chief
Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Sandra O'Connor and
Antonin Scalia. "This assertion of judicial power in one of
the most sensitive of policy areas, that involving taxation,
begins a process that . . . could threaten fundamental
alteration of the form of government our Constitution
embodies," Justice Kennedy wrote.</p>
<p>The Kansas City dispute began in 1977. Parents and
children and the school board sued the state of Missouri for
maintaining a segregated school system in the district that
includes much of Kansas City and parts of neighboring
Independence and Sugar Creek. In 1984, Judge Clark agreed
that the system needed to be desegregated and, between 1985
and 1987, ordered a broad and expensive plan of construction
and renovation of schools and reassignment of students.</p>
<p>In 1987, Judge Clark ruled that the state and school
district should share the total cost of the plan, which has
been estimated between $500 million and $700 million. But the
school district can only raise funds through the local
property tax, and state law puts a cap on property tax
increases unless approved by the voters.</p>
<p>Voters repeatedly rejected tax increases to pay for the
plan, prompting Judge Clark to raise the tax rate himself to
$4 per $100 of assessed value, from $2.05. In 1988, a federal
appeals court in St. Louis upheld the tax increase, but
suggested that in the future, Judge Clark should order the
school district to set the rate and that he should block
enforcement of the state law capping tax increases.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the high court struck down Judge Clark's own
tax increase, but upheld the appeals court's approach that he
could order the school district to raise taxes.</p>
<p>The decision will allow continued funding of the plan. But
practical problems remain for Judge Clark to resolve. He must
decide whether to refund the tax collected for 1987, which
produced some $30 million. If he decides that refunds are in
order, he must decide if all of the taxpayers are entitled to
them or only those who, at the suggestion of the local
Landmark Legal Foundation, paid in protest and placed $12
million in an escrow fund.</p>
<p>Despite the practical problems, Allen Snyder, a Washington
lawyer for the Kansas City school board, said, "There is no
question about the system we're operating under now." He said
that under an earlier ruling by Judge Clark, any shortfall in
funding caused by refunds must be paid by the state.

<p>Child Pornography</p>
<p>The court ruled, 6-3, that a state may make it illegal to
possess or view child pornography, even in the privacy of
one's home. The decision, written by Justice White, upheld an
Ohio law and effectively puts the court's stamp of approval
on the laws of 18 other states as well.</p>
<p>In 1982, the high court ruled that states may make it
illegal to sell pictures of children in sexual poses. But the
court hadn't previously said that states may punish the
buyer, as well as the seller, of such material. The Ohio law
makes it a crime for individuals to possess nude pictures of
children, except parents who may have nude pictures of their
own children. The court said that such a ban doesn't violate
the First Amendment guarantee of free speech.</p>
<p>Justice William Brennan dissented, joined by Justices
Thurgood Marshall and John Stevens. Justice Brennan said that
the Ohio law is much too broad because it outlaws depictions
of nudity that aren't obscene and that are protected by the
First Amendment.</p>
<p>Despite upholding Ohio's law, the court on technical
grounds threw out the conviction and six-month prison
sentence for a Columbus man charged with possession of nude
photos of a young boy. The court ordered a new trial. (Ohio
vs. Osborne)</p>
<p>Civil Rights Fees</p>
<p>By a 9-0 vote, the court ruled that lawyers who win civil
rights cases in federal court and whose fees are paid by the
losing parties, may still collect a portion of their clients'
damages.</p>
<p>The decision involves the relationship between so-called
contingent-fee agreements and court-ordered civil rights
attorneys' fees. A contingent-fee agreement is one in which a
lawyer agrees to be paid a share of what his client wins,
usually 40%. In a civil rights lawsuit under federal law, a
federal judge may order the loser to pay the winner's legal
fees, once the judge sets a reasonable rate and number of
hours for the winning lawyer.</p>
<p>The federal appeals courts have split over whether lawyers
on contingent fees may collect more than a court-ordered
award in civil rights cases or whether the court award is the
maximum. In an opinion written by Justice White, the high
court ruled that contingent-fee agreements are valid in civil
rights cases.</p>
<p>The decision was a defeat for a California man who hired a
lawyer on a contingent-fee basis to sue the Long Beach police
for prosecuting him with false testimony. He won $2.12
million in federal court, and the judge ordered the police to
pay his lawyer $75,000 in fees. But the lawyer went to court
to recover his contingent fee, $406,000. (Venegas vs.
