	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The stock market suffered its worst setback in
nearly two months as a surge in interest rates sent prices
tumbling.
   Retailing and technology issues were among the major
casualties of the sell-off, which was fueled by
futures-related program selling that gained momentum as the
session progressed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Blue-chip stocks, which have generally been performing
better than the broad market lately, weren't able to maintain
their dominance. The Dow Jones Industrial Average skidded
32.89 to 2732.88, and other market measures recorded
comparable losses.</p>
<p>Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index fell 3.96 to 340.72, the
New York Stock Exchange Composite Index went down 1.98 to
186.93 and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index fell 3.61 to
317.47. Decliners led by 1,056 issues on the Big Board, over
477 advancers.</p>
<p>Prices briefly moved higher in opening trading in response
to February trade figures, which was better than expected.
The data showed that the nation's trade deficit narrowed
sharply, to $6.49 billion from $9.32 billion in February.</p>
<p>But as bond prices plunged for a second straight day amid
widespread speculation that Japanese investors were heavy
sellers of U.S. Treasury issues, stocks proved unable to hold
those gains.</p>
<p>Sell programs resulting from stock-index arbitrage first
surfaced in the market at late morning, traders said. The
programs, involving the purchase of index-futures contracts
and the sale of baskets of stocks to profit from price
differences between them, struck again several times during
the afternoon.</p>
<p>As the Dow industrial average posted its sharpest loss
since Feb. 20, when the 30-stock average declined 38.74,
trading activity on the Big Board swelled to its highest
level since April 4. Volume totaled 147,130,000 shares on the
Big Board, up from 127,990,000 Tuesday.</p>
<p>Even so, traders said selling pressure didn't appear to be
especially heavy, as many investors remained out of the
market. "They don't want to get involved because they don't
know what's going to happen," said Kenneth P. Ducey, senior
vice president of institutional trading at S.G. Warburg.</p>
<p>Prices on long-term Treasury issues fell 1 1/8 points, or
$11.25 per $1,000 face amount. The benchmark 30-year issue
had a yield of 8.83%, the highest since May of last year, and
up from 8.72% Tuesday.</p>
<p>"The weakness in bonds over the last few days is taking
its toll on the equity market," said Peter VandenBerg, a vice
president of equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton.</p>
<p>Traders said the arbitrage-related selling in the
afternoon was concentrated in futures contracts on the Major
Market Index, a 20-stock average designed to mirror the Dow
industrials. The index includes 17 issues that are also in
the 30-stock average.</p>
<p>Higher rates also encouraged market participants to take
profits stemming from the market's recent move toward the
upper end of the trading range that has prevailed since
January, traders said. The Dow industrials, at Tuesday's
close, stood just 1.6% below the record high of 2810.15, set
Jan. 2.</p>
<p>Technology stocks, which had benefited recently from the
strong first-quarter results reported by International
Business Machines and Motorola, were among the most prominent
targets of profit-taking.</p>
<p>IBM dropped 1 1/4 to 109 7/8 and Motorola fell 3/4 to 67
7/8. Among other issues, Digital Equipment retreated 1 7/8 to
80, Hewlett Packard slipped 1 1/8 to 43 1/2, Compaq Computer
eased 1 1/8 to 99 1/2, Cray Research skidded 1 3/8 to 45 1/2
and Texas Instruments fell 1 1/4 to 36 3/8.</p>
<p>However, Tandem Computers rose 1 1/8 to 24 1/8 in Big
Board composite trading of two million shares as its earnings
report for the fiscal second quarter, ended in March, was
well-received. The company reported that net income rose more
than 59% from the year-ago period, and its earnings per share
of 25 cents was in line with analysts' recent forecasts.</p>
<p>Among retailing stocks, another strong group recently,
shares of specialty retailers were hit the hardest. Tandy
declined 1 3/4 to 32 1/2, Limited Inc. dropped 7/8 to 41 3/4,
Gap Inc. fell 1 1/2 to 64 1/2, Circuit City Stores dropped
3/4 to 25 3/4 and Toys "R" Us slid 7/8 to 42 1/8.</p>
<p>Woolworth, which owns several specialty chains, dropped
7/8 to 61 3/4. As for other major retailers, Dayton Hudson
fell 1 to 70 3/4, J.C. Penney fell 1 to 68 3/4, Wal- Mart
Stores declined 1 1/8 to 49 3/8 and Dillard Department Stores
dropped 2 3/8 to 72 7/8.</p>
<p>McKesson, which said it is boosting reserves for accounts
receivable because of concern about the financial health of
some of its retail customers, tumbled 2 1/4 to 34 3/8. The
company didn't specify the amount of the increase, but said
its earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter and year ended in
March will be below year-earlier levels.</p>
<p>Merck, the best performer among the 30 stocks in the Dow
industrials, gained 5/8 to 74 3/8 after reporting
first-quarter earnings that exceeded the expectations of most
analysts. The company's net income rose about 19% from the
year-earlier level.</p>
<p>Philip Morris, whose net for the quarter was also better
than expected, dropped 3/8 to 42 5/8 on 2.4 million shares
after trading at higher levels for most of the session. The
company's earnings rose 31%.</p>
<p>American Telephone & Telegraph dropped 1 to 41 despite
reporting that first-quarter net was 11% higher than a year
ago. Analysts had expected a better performance. Among other
blue-chip companies issuing quarterly reports, United
Technologies dipped 3/8 to 57 and Coca-Cola fell 1 to 79 1/4.</p>
<p>Stocks to benefit from positive earnings surprises
included First Interstate Bancorp, which rose 7/8 to 36, and
Phelps Dodge, which gained 1/2 to 61 7/8. Although
first-quarter net at both companies fell short of year-ago
levels, the declines weren't as sharp as had been expected.</p>
<p>Conversely, Polaroid fell 1 3/4 to 43 3/4 after posting a
disappointing 23% rise in its first-quarter earnings. The
company also scaled back its projected earnings growth for
this year to "moderate" from "substantially higher"; it
didn't provide a specific forecast.</p>
<p>Nervousness about the rate outlook proved favorable for
precious-metals issues, generally viewed as a safe haven for
investors. Homestake Mining rose 1 to 17 3/4, Placer Dome
added 3/4 to 17, Battle Mountain Gold advanced 1/2 to 14 3/8
and ASA Ltd. rose 2 1/8 to 51 7/8.</p>
<p>Auto issues also escaped the worst of the downturn.
General Motors added 1/8 to close at 46 on 1.6 million
shares. Trading also was heavy in Ford Motor, which rose 7/8
to 48, and Chrysler, which slid 1/8 to 16 3/4.</p>
<p>Mattel rose 3/8 to 22 3/8 after Merrill Lynch raised its
long-term investment rating on the stock to the firm's
highest level. Merrill Lynch also reiterated its buy
recommendation on Blockbuster Entertainment, which gained 1/8
to 18 3/8.</p>
<p>Thomson McKinnon Asset Management jumped 1 7/8 to 8.
Thomson McKinnon Inc., which holds a 63% interest in the
partnership, agreed in principle to sell its stake to three
of the unit's managers.</p>
<p>CML Group fell 1 1/8 to 21 1/8. Investor Irwin Jacobs
dropped plans for a proxy fight to replace its board with a
slate committed to its sale. Separately, CML estimated that
it would report a loss of $1.90 to $2 a share for the fiscal
year ending in July.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 1.50
to 353.22. Volume totaled 13,370,000 shares compared with
13,510,000 Tuesday. There were 202 issues advancing and 352
declining.</p>
<p>American Fructose class A skidded 2 3/8 to 21 1/8. The
company reported that first-quarter earnings fell about 10%
from a year ago, while sales dropped 6%.</p>
