	<p class="article-leader">BUSH CALLED FOR international assistance to finance the
blockade of Iraq.
   Asserting that the shape of the post-Cold War world is at
stake in the Persian Gulf, the president also urged economic
aid for countries hurt by the Gulf crisis. Iraq's Saddam
Hussein, meanwhile, put new bureaucratic obstacles in the
path of the Western women and children he had pledged to
release, prompting an angry response from Washington. The
Iraqi ambassador to the U.S. denied reports that his nation
demanded that planes arriving to pick up hostages deliver
food and medicine. In Jordan, the U.N.'s Perez de Cuellar
arrived for talks today with Baghdad's foreign minister.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>London said Iraq was arranging to fly some British women
and children from Baghdad on Iraqi Airways, and Virgin
Atlantic Airways said it had Iraqi permission to pick up more
evacuees.</p>

<p>Gorbachev said he welcomed the adoption of sovereignty
declarations by Soviet republics, calling then a "major
achievement" of his restructuring program. But the Soviet
president appeared to distinguish between declarations of
sovereignty, which entail greater autonomy, and declarations
of independence that call for secession.</p>
<p>Armenian officials said 250 members of a nationalist
paramilitary group gave up their weapons after the republic
declared a state of emergency and surrounded their
headquarters with soldiers and tanks. The surrender was
viewed as a victory for Armenia's Parliament, which issued an
independence declaration last week.</p>

<p>Bonn's government said it settled a dispute with its
Social Democrat opponents over abortion laws, removing the

German unification treaty. Separately, Foreign Minister
Genscher said his government would nearly halve the troop
strength of a united Germany.</p>

<p>South Africa said it would stop paying for electricity,
trash removal and some water services in black and mixed-race
townships hit by rent boycotts protesting conditions in the
segregated settlements. Separately, it was reported that
negotiators were completing a draft accord to end a five-year
rent boycott in the black township of Soweto.</p>

<p>NASA postponed tomorrow's scheduled launch of the shuttle
Columbia until at least next Wednesday. Agency officials said

the shuttle's cargo bay.</p>

<p>A long-term study found that the experimental drug DDI
improved signs of immune functioning in most patients with
AIDS and AIDS-related complex without causing severe side
effects. The researchers said their study suggested that
DDI's efficacy is at least as good as AZT, the only approved
AIDS drug.</p>

<p>Quebec's premier ordered the army to remove Mohawk
barricades at the town of Oka after talks aimed at ending a
land dispute broke off. A policeman was killed in July when
officers stormed the barricade Mohawks built to stop the
extension of a golf course onto land they regard as sacred.</p>

<p>A Cambodian peace plan recommends that Prince Sihanouk be
chosen by warring factions as the nominal leader of the
country until elections can be held, Reuters reported. The
plan calls for the U.N. to play a key role during the
transition. Sihanouk heads a three-party coalition fighting
the Vietnamese-backed Phnom Penh regime.</p>

<p>Researchers said animal-cancer tests in which rodents are
fed massive doses of chemicals may be useless for calculating
the cancer risks in humans because the dosage itself may be
causing the disease. The two groups of scientists said that
they questioned the value of government-supported cancer
tests on rats.</p>

<p>The European Space Agency launched an Ariane rocket with a
double satellite payload from a site in French Guiana. Aboard

military and a satellite for television and radio broadcasts
to Europe.</p>

<p>A federal appeals court overturned a $5.2 million damage
award to entertainer Wayne Newton in his libel suit against
NBC. The suit is one of a growing number of cases in which
public figures have argued that an article or broadcast
created a false impression, even if each statement taken
separately was true.</p>

<p>Occupational diseases kill more than 70,000 U.S. workers
yearly, a safety group reported, based on an analysis of 1987
data. The National Safe Workplace Institute also charged that
the nation's regulatory apparatus for occupational health is
in disarray.</p>

<p>Two bombs exploded at an army barracks manned by troops of
rebellious Gen. Aoun in Lebanon's Christian enclave, killing
four soldiers and three policemen, officials said. Later,
Aoun's troops clashed with Lebanese Forces militiamen,
marking the latest violations of a three-month cease-fire in
the fight for control of the enclave.</p>

<p>Czechoslovakia approved draft legislation to clear the way
for privatization of state-owned enterprises as a first step
toward creating a Western-style market economy. The proposed
measures also call for the lifting of price controls by the
start of next year.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Afghanistan's president said he was willing to relinquish
control of the state media and of some troops to an interim
commission if elections are held. But Najibullah rejected
U.S. demands that all troops and police be placed under the
authority of a neutral council during a transitional period
aimed at ending a 12-year civil war.</p>
