	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- Researchers at the Centers for Disease Control
said they isolated a chemical substance that may have
contaminated batches of L-tryptophan, a nutritional
supplement that triggered an outbreak of a rare blood
disorder earlier this year.
   About 1,500 cases of the illness, known as
eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome or EMS, have been linked to
consumption of L-tryptophan during the past 12 months,
according to the CDC. The disease involves abnormally high
levels of white blood cells, causing serious muscle pain,
neurological damage and, in some cases, death -- 27 people
have died from the disorder.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>CDC investigators said they are trying to determine
whether the isolated substance is the cause of the disease or
simply a "marker" of the actual cause. Scientists said they
don't know how the contaminant may have gotten into
L-tryptophan.</p>
<p>Last December, the Food and Drug Administration banned
imports of L-tryptophan. Before that, virtually all
L-tryptophan sold in U.S. products were made by about six
Japanese companies.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Showa Denko K.K., Japan's
third-largest chemical producer, said 89 suits seeking a
total of $810 million in damages have been filed against the
company in the U.S. by victims of EMS. Until sales were
stopped, Showa exported about 70 tons of L-tryptophan a year
to the U.S.</p>
<p>A report published in mid-August in the New England
Journal of Medicine said the outbreak of the disease probably
stemmed from a change in Showa's manufacturing process.</p>
