the Paris Basin of France. While the Sancy Les Provins No. 1
exploratory well tested only at a rate of 160 barrels of oil
a day, the No. 3 confirmation well erupted at a rate of 1,200
barrels of oil a day from a depth of 6,300 feet. Neither
discovery had been previously reported by the company.
   Total Exploration of Paris is the operator, with a 50%
interest. Its partner is Triton France, a unit of Triton
