	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo stock prices finished sharply higher Thursday,
reflecting a perception by participants that the discount
rate boost in the morning was a positive factor for the
market as it eliminated long-existing concerns about the
timing of the action.
   Shares were up at London and in most other markets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As buying centering on speculative shares gradually spread
to blue-chip issues, Tokyo stock prices moved up strongly
late in the afternoon session, helped by dealer and corporate
buying, traders said.</p>
<p>The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues was up 775.17
points at 25669.96. The index lost 815.97 points Wednesday.</p>
<p>In Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei index surged 244.49 points to
close the morning session at 25914.45.</p>
<p>Thursday's volume on the first section was estimated at
530 million shares, up from 430 million Wednesday.</p>
<p>Advancing issues outnumbered declining issues, 791 to 211,
while 99 remained unchanged.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index (Topix) of all issues listed
in the first section, which lost 36.09 points Wednesday, was
up 44.60 points, or 2.33%, at 1956.02.</p>
<p>The second section index, which fell 4.96 points
Wednesday, was up 83.46 points, or 2.26%, to close at
3770.84. Volume in the second section was 11 million shares,
up from 9.8 million Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Bank of Japan raised its official discount rate -- the
amount the central bank charges on loans to financial
institutions -- by 0.75 percentage point, to 6%, 20 minutes
before the market opened.</p>
<p>Market participants said the 0.75 percentage point
increase had already been discounted at current stock prices.</p>
<p>The Nikkei index gained 380 points within 20 minutes of
the opening. Stock prices dropped later in the morning
session, however, because of speculation that another
increase could follow if Middle East unrest and further oil
price rises cause inflation to accelerate.</p>
<p>After finishing the morning session little changed from
Wednesday's close, stock prices gradually climbed in the
afternoon session, encouraged by the firmness of the bond
market, traders said.</p>
<p>At first the pace of gains was set by speculative shares.
But as the target of buying activity widened to blue-chip
shares, the Nikkei index was pushed up strongly during the
last hour of trading.</p>
<p>Many participants expressed uncertainty about whether
domestic interest rates will peak out soon.</p>
<p>But growing expectations that the Mideast crisis might be
solved without an outbreak of hostilities, together with a
decline in oil prices this week, calmed investors' concerns
that the Persian Gulf situation will prompt another interest
rate increase, observers said.</p>
<p>Takatoshi Okuyama, general manager of the investment
advisory department at Daiwa Securities, said market
participants, who responded only to bad news from the Middle
East over the past few weeks, have gradually been turning
their eyes to positive factors.</p>
<p>Mr. Okuyama said the decision by a majority of
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries members to
sanction greater oil production has convinced many investors
that stocks have been oversold.</p>
<p>Investors were also expecting fruitful negotiations at the
scheduled meeting between United Nations chief De Cuellar and
the Iraqi foreign minister later Thursday.</p>
<p>Shin Tokoi, general manager of stock trading at County
NatWest Securities, said some of his clients with high cash
positions are ready to buy on Friday if any positive news
came out of the meeting.</p>
<p>Traders said, however, that institutions are for the most
part major potential sellers when stocks rebound further.</p>
<p>They are unlikely to buy stocks actively ahead of the
November release of corporate earnings reports, said Masami
Okuma, a senior trader at UBS Phillips & Drew International.</p>
<p>Concern about the impact of higher interest rates and
higher oil prices on corporate earnings is discouraging
institutions from buying stocks now, he said.</p>
<p>Stocks that appeared to be targets of speculative buying
collected buy orders from dealers and corporate investors who
tried to take wide gains in a short term.</p>
<p>These shares were attractive, as they could move up
regardless of changes in the market environment, traders
said.</p>
<p>Among them was Kurabo, which surged 260 yen ($1.81) to
1,820 yen. Ube Industries was up 100 to 731 and Honshu Paper
rose 260 to 4,990.</p>
<p>High-priced shares gained widely, with Sony advancing 290
to 7,550 and Kyocera up 260 to 7,790.</p>
<p>Hitachi finished at 1,390, up 40, after a tug of war
between brokerage house buying and profit-taking by
institutions.</p>
<p>Toyota Motor added 50 to 2,050, while Shimizu Corp. rose
80 to 1,680.</p>
<p>London share prices closed higher Thursday, but below the
day's best levels, as uncertainty over the Middle East crisis
eased its grip on the London market.</p>
<p>Wall Street's steady decline from its opening shook some
of the strength from the London market, which reached its
peak near midday.</p>
<p>But despite the late-afternoon softening, one trader said
he expects the London market to find its resistance level
soon, following the marked decline in London stocks over the
past three weeks.</p>
<p>At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index was up 27.9 points at 2153.6. The day's high was
2164.1, and its low 2139.6.</p>
<p>The narrower FT 30-share index closed up 29 points at
1687.9.</p>
<p>Volume was 382.7 million shares, well above Wednesday's
297.3 million.</p>
<p>In the futures markets, the September 100 index contract
was trading at 2179, up from Wednesday's close of 2142.</p>
<p>Thursday's stronger performance by the dollar and the
expectation of an imminent easing in U.K. interest rates
helped international stocks. The pound fell to $1.9225
Thursday from $1.9475.</p>
<p>Among overseas earners, Glaxo rose 14 pence (27 cents) to
close at 736 pence, and SmithKline Beecham jumped 18 to 523.</p>
<p>Brewing stocks, which have recently been under pressure,
had a strong day. Bass shares rose 4 pence to #10.53
($20.24); Allied Lyons leapt 18 pence to 490 pence; shares in
Guinness climbed 28 pence to close at 703.</p>
<p>Following an 11% profit-forecast downgrading by County
Natwest, B.A.T Industries fell 5 pence to 529. The broker
said B.A.T is likely to have pretax profit of #1.58 billion
in the latest year, down from the #1.76 billion previously
forecast.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, stock prices closed higher in Paris, Zurich,
Brussels, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Madrid and Milan and mixed in
Frankfurt. South African gold stocks closed higher.</p>
<p>Stocks closed higher in Sydney, Hong Kong, Singapore and
Wellington, and lower in Seoul and Manila. Taipei was closed.</p>
<p>Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.</p>
