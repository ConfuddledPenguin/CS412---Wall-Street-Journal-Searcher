	<p class="article-leader">Labor Day was conceived by trade unions as a way to honor
worker solidarity. In today's global economy, it should
remind us that America's prosperity depends on the quality of
its individuals -- its human capital.
   When money and industry can cross national borders with
ease, the main competition is for brains and grit. With a
labor shortage widely predicted in coming decades, the U.S.
needs to find ways to attract and retain the world's best
workers. A study to be released next week by some of
America's business leaders offers some useful ideas on how to
do it.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"America has entered an era of fewer entrants into the
work force and an aging population," declares the Committee
for Economic Development's report, "An America That Works."
"As recently as the early 1980s, there were too few jobs in a
slack economy, but we can now expect plentiful jobs in many
communities as labor markets tighten. Our new problem is not
too few jobs but too few skills."</p>
<p>The report travels well-trod and debatable ground on
education and policy toward children, and puts far too much
faith in governments to solve the problems they've created
(welfare dependency, for example). But the report is notable
for paying attention to the economic potential of two groups
often overlooked by politicians -- immigrants and the
elderly.</p>
<p>The report calls flatly for increasing the number of
immigrants allowed into the U.S., and especially those with
usable skills. Right now, U.S. immigration policy puts a
priority on reuniting families. That sometimes means talented
but striving individuals get squeezed out. It can take months
or years for a company to get a visa to transfer a foreign
national here. The report calls for immigration laws that
allow "adequate flexibility for rapid adjustments to changing
labor markets."</p>
<p>As for economics, CED concludes that immigration is
largely a boon. Take California. Without immigrants, that
fast-growing state might have faced a shortage of some 80,000
workers in the 1980s. Immigrants contributed more than 25% to
the state's job growth. Maybe someone should jetpack these
facts to Wyoming's Republican Senator Alan Simpson, who's
doing his best to kill immigration reform this year.</p>
<p>Other laws needing reform are those that tell older
Americans they aren't wanted in the work force. The report
points out that today's retirement policies "were developed
during the Great Depression when the primary concern was to
create jobs for the young" and protect the old from
destitution. Life expectancy at the time was some 60 years,
but now it's nearly 75. With fewer young people entering the
work force now, it's ludicrous to treat the elderly as if
they're only good for golf and bingo.</p>
<p>The report zeroes in on the perverse incentives of the
Social Security system. Social Security benefits have tripled
in real terms since 1945, making retirement more attractive.
Especially perverse are the "earnings test" and high-tax
policies that punish a retiree by taking away benefits if he
works. A retiree working at McDonald's this year loses $1 in
benefits for every $3 of income earned above a piddling
$9,340. House Democrats, led by Indiana's Andy Jacobs, won't
even let a repeal of this inane law come to a vote, so afraid
are they of losing "revenue."</p>
<p>The CED study has other good ideas for making better use
of the elderly's skills, and we hope they set off a debate.
The elderly, like immigrants, may just be America's secret
weapon in the economic competition of the future.</p>
