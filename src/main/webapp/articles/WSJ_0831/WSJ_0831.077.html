	<p class="article-leader">FRANKFURT, West Germany -- Bayerische Motoren Werke AG
said it expects record auto output for this year.
   The Munich-based maker of luxury, high-performance autos
and motorcycles said its production of 328,000 units in the
first seven months represented a 3% increase from a year
earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For all of 1990, BMW said it expects to produce about
520,000 cars, up from last year's record total of 511,476
units, and up from its early-August projection of more than
500,000 units.</p>
<p>"Our {productive} capacity is fully taxed," Robert
Buechelhofer, a member of BMW's management board, said,
adding that "BMW is again facing a production record."</p>
<p>Mr. Buechelhofer said customer demand for BMW's top-line
models has been buoyant this year, especially for the new BMW
Coupe and the prestigious 7-series. To meet the firm demand
for these models, BMW operated extra shifts at its production
lines during the usual summer-holiday factory break, the
executive disclosed. He said the company was able to assemble
an additional 1,160 7-series autos and 500 Coupes by keeping
production lines operating during the vacation break.
Moreover, BMW was able to shorten some of the continuing
delivery lag times for these models, Mr. Buechelhofer said.</p>
<p>Neither the company nor the executive disclosed any new
forecasts for BMW's profit and sales for 1990. In early
August, when BMW reported first-half profit rose 8.3% to 352
million marks ($225.7 million), on a sales rise of 2.2% to
13.84 billion marks, the company said only that it expected
"satisfactory" sales and earnings for the full year. In 1989,
BMW earned 558.1 million marks on sales of 26.52 billion
marks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Buechelhofer noted that BMW also has been
sustaining "pleasing" sales growth in its motorcycle
division. Output and deliveries in the first seven months
rose 25% to 19,700 units, compared with year-earlier levels,
he disclosed.</p>
<p>By the end of the year, the company expects to build more
than 31,000 motorcycles, up 20% from 25,761 units last year,
he said.</p>
<p>With the domestic economy booming, BMW and other West
German car makers have been able to defy industry analysts'
expectations this year and post strong production and order
gains, compared with those a year earlier. A soft car market
previously was forecast for Europe as a whole. Other West
Germany auto makers also have instituted extra shifts this
year to help reduce growing order backlogs.</p>
