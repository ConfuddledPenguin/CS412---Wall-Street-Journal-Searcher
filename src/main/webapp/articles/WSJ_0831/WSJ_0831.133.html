	<p class="article-leader">Australian coal miner Oakbridge Ltd. reported that
operating profit for the fiscal year ended June 30 soared to
42.7 million Australian dollars (US$35.5 million) from A$3.4
million a year earlier.
   Oakbridge attributed the sharp increase to a restructuring
of the company and rationalization of its assets, including
the acquisition of the Australian coal-mining assets of
Elders Resources NZFP Ltd. at June 30, 1989.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Firmer coal prices and a favorable exchange rate also
boosted profit.</p>
<p>Total operating revenue jumped to A$428.6 million from
A$108.9 million, as sales revenue quadrupled to A$397.9
million from A$100 million.</p>
<p>Oakbridge posted an operating profit before tax and
abnormal items of A$25.8 million, up 659% from A$3.4 million.</p>
<p>It said an abnormal profit of A$25.2 million came from the
sale of 20% of the assets of the Clarence Colliery and from a
pension-fund surplus. Last year Oakbridge reported no
abnormal profits.</p>
