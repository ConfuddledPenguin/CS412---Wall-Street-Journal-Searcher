	<p class="article-leader">Atalanta/Sosnoff Capital Corp. said its board has
authorized a buy-back of as many as 200,000 shares of its
common stock in open-market transactions.
   Atalanta, New York, said the timing of the purchases will
depend on market conditions. The asset management firm, once
a highflier on Wall Street, currently has about 10 million
shares outstanding. A spokesman said the board saw this as a
good time to get the stock at a price below book value.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company's earnings and assets have all fallen during
the first six months of 1990. Net income dropped 38% to $1.8
million, or 21 cents a share, for the first half from against
$2.9 million, or 35 cents a share, a year earlier. Assets
under Atalanta/Sosnoff's management have also dipped to $1.2
billion at June 30, compared with $1.7 billion last year.</p>
