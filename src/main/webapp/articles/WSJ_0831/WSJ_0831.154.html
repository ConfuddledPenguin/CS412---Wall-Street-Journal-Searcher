	<h3>Phone Companies Calling on Customers To Handle Some Service Tasks -- Gladly</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">Linda Bordsen, a short-order cook in Bellingham, Wash.,
turned on her new phone service in less time than it takes to
whip up a plate of bacon and eggs.
   Ms. Bordsen, who relies on a daily 4:30 a.m. wake-up call
from her mother, didn't miss one day of phone service -- or
work -- when she moved last month, thanks to a new automatic
telephone connection service. "It was the fastest my phone
has ever been hooked up," she says. "When I moved before, it
took almost a week to get service."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Several phone companies are experimenting with ways to
make Ms. Bordsen's experience routine. In some tests, new
residents can turn on their own service. In others, customers
can suspend or disconnect service and add or cancel special
features, such as call forwarding, call waiting and three-way
calling. By increasing the customer's role, telephone
companies hope to hold down labor costs and eliminate
installation delays.</p>
<p>To get service in Bellingham, within Denver-based U S West
Inc.'s territory, a new resident plugs a touch-tone phone
into a jack and punches 811 on the telephone key pad. A
computer asks questions that can be answered by pressing more
digits, or customers can talk to a phone company
representative. In less than 20 minutes, the phone is
operating, compared with the usual two-day wait until a
technician arrives.</p>
<p>Companies that don't have the sophisticated technology yet
are still finding ways to speed service installation.
BellSouth Corp. recently announced that some new customers
can plug in their phones and order service from a customer
representative. Service ordered before 3 p.m. is turned on
the same day.</p>
<p>Several Baby Bells offer variations of automated orders.
Pacific Bell, a unit of San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis
Group, is conducting tests in Sacramento, Calif., in which
clients order special features on a touch-tone phone. Since
May, Michigan Bell, a unit of Chicago-based Ameritech, has
let people order custom-calling features the same way. New
Jersey shore vacationers can already suspend service from
Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic Corp. after the summer, and
Rutgers University students may disconnect service
automatically. Brooklyn customers of New York-based Nynex
Corp. and customers throughout Atlanta-based BellSouth's
territory have been able to use touch-tone phones to
disconnect or suspend service and order special features
since 1989.</p>
<p>But automation isn't problem free. Gary Ames, president of
U S West's telephone company unit, acknowledges "a healthy
internal argument" about whether to expand automated services
or allow more human intervention in the customer sign-up
process. At BellSouth, a spokesman says that even
semiautomated service may mean less hiring, although the
company has no plans to lay off employees. Some technicians
will be reassigned to repair lines and install cables instead
of connecting residential service.</p>
<p>Still, the impact on employees may be painful. The new
technology is expected to reduce the number of sales,
clerical and repair jobs and threatens to cut the skill level
required for those that remain. The prospect worries the
Communications Workers of America. "I'm concerned that the
new jobs will not be of a technical nature but more
redundant, repetitive, less-skilled work that is lower paid,"
says John Hamilton, president of CWA Local 7800.</p>
<p>Jim Elias, director of the U S West project, acknowledges
the eventual effect on jobs. "When it all settles down," he
says, "there will be fewer people required to operate the
exchange, that is for sure." Mr. Elias says he is unable to
project the labor savings but considers the union's attitude
"quite supportive."</p>
<p>U S West is on the forefront of automated services, but
officials won't disclose savings projections. The company has
invested $20 million in its Bellingham project over the past
18 months to study residents' habits, cut labor costs,
replace aging telephone lines with fiber optics and revamp
archaic data bases.</p>
<p>Bellingham is an ideal test bed: a community of 49,000
with a large population of fishermen, college students and
other transient residents. Isolated by Puget Sound and the
Cascade Mountains, Bellingham is on a separate U S West
telephone exchange so that experiments there won't confuse
phone customers in Seattle, 80 miles to the south.</p>
<p>Horizon Airlines agent Holly Otis used the automated
service to transfer her phone number when she moved. "It
worked in my old apartment while I was moving, and that
evening my phone worked in the new one," she says. Western
Washington University senior Robb Faller says his new phone
was connected "just about immediately," in contrast with the
five-day delay he experienced as a freshman.</p>
<p>When university students returned last September, the
service-on-demand system helped U S West handle a surge of
1,726 orders in two days instead of the usual two weeks. Last
March, a month when many fishermen head for Alaska's salmon
banks and students end a quarter, about 450 disconnect orders
were cleared through the system.</p>
<p>Bugs in the computerized service must be fixed before U S
West takes "live jacks" beyond Bellingham, a move it plans to
make in a little more than a year. Odd situations stump the
computer. For example, Judy Channel tried to disconnect her
phone in January before moving to nearby Ferndale, a town
outside the Bellingham exchange.</p>
<p>The computer balked when she couldn't provide her new
phone number. When she called an hour later with the
information, the computer wasn't working and she had to wait
on hold for about 15 minutes before she got an operator. "If
there is any idiosyncrasy at all," Mrs. Channel says, "it's
that you have to wait forever for an operator."</p>
