   Attract More Interest</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>AMERICA'S APPETITE for bigger cars hasn't been killed by
the recent surge in gasoline prices, but some auto makers say
there is increased interest in their tiniest gas misers.</p>
<p>August sales of the Daihatsu Charade -- which averages
nearly 42 miles a gallon in government tests -- have risen
about 20% from a year earlier and 40% from July of this year,
says Daihatsu Motor, which expects to sell 1,600 to 1,700
Charades this month.</p>
<p>Dealer orders for the 1991-model Suzuki Swift picked up
sharply this month, Suzuki Motor reports. In addition, some
dealers are beginning to advertise Swifts -- which average 48
miles a gallon -- Suzuki says.</p>
<p>Still, most customers steer away from these high-mileage
minicars, dealers say. "People who come in are concerned
about gas prices, but they're still buying the bigger car,"
says Jerry Presley, a salesman at Lapointe Honda in
Charlotte, N.C.</p>
<p>Auto Makers Selective</p>
<p>In Rankings They Tout</p>
<p>QUOTING consumer surveys is all the rage in auto
advertising. But ads based on survey results aren't always
reliable guides for shoppers.</p>
<p>Consider the full-page ads General Motors' Chevrolet
division is running in various newspapers trumpeting a survey
that found its Lumina Coupe to be the "most trouble-free car
in its class."</p>
<p>In fact, the Lumina Coupe's quality during the first three
months of ownership is worse than the average for all cars on
the market, according to a recent survey by J.D. Power &
Associates, an Agoura Hills, Calif., market researcher. The
Lumina averages 147 problems per 100 cars, compared with the
overall average 142 problems per 100 cars.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Chevrolet, the Power survey has another
way of ranking cars that views the Lumina in a more
flattering light.</p>
<p>When compared only with the six other domestic, midsized
coupes that make up the "midsize specialty" class, the Lumina
shines -- sort of. It has nine fewer defects on average than
the second-place finisher in the class, GM's Buick Regal
coupe.</p>
<p>Chevy's ad doesn't tell consumers that the Lumina Coupe's
quality score is below the industry average. But Chevrolet
and J.D. Power's William Fleming say the ad isn't misleading.
Buyers interested in the Lumina typically compare it with
similar domestic rivals, and "among that competitive set,
this model happens to be the best, as far as initial
quality," Mr. Fleming says.</p>
<p>Chevy isn't alone in selectively quoting Power surveys.
Consider the ads Honda Motor's Acura division is running to
tout its fourth straight first-place finish in Power's
Customer Satisfaction Index. Acura's ad names the top three
brands for 1987-1989: Acura, Mercedes-Benz and Honda. But for
1990, Acura shows only the top two brands: itself and
Mercedes. Conveniently omitted is this year's No. 3 finisher,
Toyota. Honda dropped to No. 5.</p>
<p>Foreign Cars Graded</p>
<p>Highest by Students</p>
<p>ONLY 40% of U.S. college students plan to buy a new car
made by one of the Big Three U.S. auto makers, says a
recently released survey that indicates Detroit's
market-share decline is likely to continue.</p>
<p>A majority of 1,024 students surveyed this spring by Roper
Campus Reports said foreign cars are more fun to drive and
offer better workmanship, fuel economy, styling and
reliability than their Detroit counterparts.</p>
<p>The only area where American cars win out: ease of repair.</p>
<p>Despite what they say about purchase plans, however, some
57% of the students owning cars have American cars now. But
that is down six percentage points from a similar Roper
survey two years earlier. During the same period, the number
of students owning Asian nameplate cars rose six percentage
points to 30%.</p>
<p>Though many of the students dream of owning sporty
European makes such as Porsche, BMW or Ferrari, the single
most popular car brand is as American as, well, baseball, hot
dogs and apple pie. Some 10% of the students say the car they
would most enjoy owning is a Chevrolet.</p>
<p>That varies by region, however. Students in the Midwest
are twice as likely to name Chevrolet as those in the West.
Chevrolet was also the favorite of adults in a 1989 Roper
survey, when 15% picked Chevy as their top choice.</p>
<p>People get more practical as they get older, the survey
also shows. More than half the students say they would most
enjoy owning a sports car or convertible; among adults, they
were named by only one in four.</p>
<p>Odds and Ends
</p>
<p>GM IS GOING nationwide with a program to satisfy
disgruntled customers before they file complaints under state
lemon laws. The move comes after a yearlong experiment in
Massachusetts during which the auto maker opted to settle
most lemon-law claims, rather than fight them as in the past.
The results: Only one Chevrolet owner has been accepted for
arbitration under the Massachusetts lemon law so far this
year. That compares with 180 Chevy owners accepted for
arbitration for all of 1988. . . . Ford Motor, meanwhile, is
trying to make it easier for customers to call in their
comments. In 1988, Ford began replacing its regional
customer-service offices with a central office in Detroit
having a single 800 telephone number. Before the new setup,
only 54% of callers got through to a representative. Now,
Ford says 95% do. In addition to car-owner gripes, operators
will answer general questions about the company. One recent
query: how many Mustang convertibles were built in 1966? The
answer: 72,119.</p>
