	<p class="article-leader">OAKLAND, Calif. -- Equitec Financial Group Inc., a real
estate syndication firm, said it and certain of its
subsidiaries sought relief under Chapter 11 of the federal
Bankruptcy Code.
   The company said it needed to seek protection from
creditors because of "difficult times in the real estate
industry." The move will give it time to sell some of its
real estate partnerships to Hallwood Realty L.P. of Dallas,
the company said. Equitec also is seeking court approval to
sell some of its assets to Wells Fargo Bank and Stephens Inc.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>According to its Chapter 11 filing, the company's assets
total $80.7 million and its liabilities total $91.7 million,
including $40 million of bonds outstanding. Because of its
eroding financial condition, Equitec missed bond payments in
March and June.</p>
