	<p class="article-leader">KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- The case of the missing
Malaysian shares has closed.
   Nik Mohamed Din Yusoff, executive chairman of the Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange, said all investors with valid
share-purchase agreements have been given their securities,
concluding an embarrassing episode that dragged on for more
than six months and tarnished the credibility of the
Malaysian exchange soon after it severed its last links with
the more developed Stock Exchange of Singapore.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At the height of the affair in mid-February, about 150
million shares, valued by securities analysts at more than
250 million Malaysian dollars (US$93 million), had been
mislaid.</p>
<p>The delivery of share certificates to the wrong brokerage
and incorrectly recorded trades left the 53 member brokerage
firms and exchange officials unable to cope with soaring
trading volume.</p>
<p>Last week, the final claims outstanding were filled by the
exchange's clearinghouse, the Securities Clearing Automated
Network System, known as Scans. The only party that stands to
lose from the incident is Scans itself, Nik Din said.</p>
<p>The clearinghouse covered the claims by distributing
shares it bought on the open market and by recovering from
brokerage firms shares that had been delivered to them by
mistake.</p>
<p>Nik Din declined to specify the amounts of shares bought
by the clearinghouse or retrieved from brokers.</p>
