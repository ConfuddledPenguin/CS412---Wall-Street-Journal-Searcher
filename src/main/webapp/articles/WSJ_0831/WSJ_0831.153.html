	<p class="article-leader">In the first long-term study of the experimental drug DDI,
researchers found that it improved signs of immune
functioning in most patients with AIDS and AIDS-related
complex without causing severe side effects, in some cases
for well over a year.
   While the study of 58 patients wasn't designed to compare
DDI's efficacy with that of other AIDS drugs, it did "suggest
that DDI is at least as good as AZT," the only approved drug
for AIDS, said Robert Yarchoan, a National Cancer Institute
researcher who led the DDI study. In the DDI study, 80% of
acquired immune deficiency syndrome patients were alive after
21 months on the drug, compared with about 50% who survived
that long in a similar earlier study of Wellcome PLC's AZT,
Dr. Yarchoan added.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The latest study "moves us one step beyond what has been
presented to date on DDI," said Jerome Groopman, a researcher
at Harvard University and New England Deaconess Hospital. He
said the study shows three things: long-term antiviral
effects, increased numbers of immune cells and "important
data on safety."</p>
<p>Researchers cautioned, however, that they haven't followed
enough patients taking DDI long enough to draw strong
conclusions about the drug, which is made by Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co. Moreover, side effects associated with DDI include
painful nerve damage to the feet and, occasionally,
pancreatitis, an inflammation of the pancreas. DDI-associated
pancreatitis, in particular, remains a "serious issue," said
Dr. Yarchoan.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a report that six AIDS patients died of
DDI-caused pancreatitis raised concerns about a
compassionate-use program under which thousands of AIDS
patients are taking the drug. Medical experts say the deaths
were probably due to the fact that a large proportion of AIDS
patients taking DDI under the program are severely ill and
highly vulnerable to complications such as pancreatitis.</p>
<p>The latest study suggests that at DDI dosage levels now
commonly used, 500 milligrams to 750 milligrams daily, the
drug can be taken by most patients without severe problems
for long periods. Three of 35 patients on such doses had
serious side effects while taking DDI for up to 21 months,
the researchers reported. None of the patients died from drug
toxicity. Milder side effects included insomnia, anxiety,
irritability and headaches, the researchers reported. The
study appears in this week's issue of the British medical
journal Lancet.</p>
<p>Researchers are hopeful about DDI because of preliminary
evidence that it can help when AZT doesn't. In patients
taking AZT over long periods, mutations of the AIDS virus
develop that resist the drug. Moreover, DDI causes little
bone-marrow suppression, which afflicts about half of
patients taking AZT. Dr. Yarchoan said that eventually
doctors may use a combination of DDI and AZT to fight AIDS,
thereby achieving desired effects with lower doses of each
drug and lessening overall side effects.</p>
<p>The NCI researchers found that the patients who best
responded to DDI were those who hadn't taken AZT for long
periods. That may be because long-term AZT use had cut some
patients' bone-marrow production of immune cells before they
entered the DDI study, Dr. Yarchoan said. Thus, their levels
of T4 lymphocytes -- white blood cells whose levels indicate
how well the immune system is functioning -- rose little, if
at all, when they took DDI.</p>
<p>In 13 patients who took moderate doses of DDI for as long
as 20 months, the study showed that T4 lymphocyte improvement
lasted at least nine months and perhaps 15 months or longer.
With AZT, T4 lymphocyte improvements typically disappear
after about six months, Dr. Yarchoan said. DDI also lowered
patients' levels of an AIDS viral protein, called p24, which
is used as a marker of disease progression, the researchers
noted.</p>
<p>Additionally, five patients with symptoms of AIDS-related
dementia showed signs of cognitive improvement while taking
DDI, the NCI researchers reported.</p>
<p>More than 11,150 patients are now taking DDI under the
compassionate-use program, a Bristol-Myers spokeswoman said.
The company expects to file a new drug application for it
with the Food and Drug Administration late this year or early
in 1991, she added.</p>
