	<p class="article-leader">ARMONK, N.Y. -- International Business Machines Corp. said
it will raise prices 4% on a wide range of computer hardware
and software products, effective Jan. 1.
   IBM said the price increases are the result of a regular
review, and won't apply to some of the company's big revenue
producers, such as the 3090 mainframe computer family and the
system unit of the PS/2 personal computer. But the new
RS/6000 work station is affected, as are the hot-selling 3390
mainframe disk drives and most models of the AS/400
minicomputer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts expect IBM to announce a successor to the 3090 on
Sept. 5, and to offer big discounts on mainframes until the
new machine can be delivered in late 1991. The PS/2 has been
aggressively priced for some time, as IBM fights to protect
its market share.</p>
<p>Also excluded from the price increases are some
maintenance, service and network-use charges; customer
education; operating system software for personal computers;
memory for the RS/6000 and 3990 computers; the LaserPrinter
and Proprinter; and any product or new price announced since
June 1.</p>
