	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- President Bush, asserting that the shape of
the post-Cold War world is at stake in the Persian Gulf,
called for a multinational effort to underwrite the blockade
of Iraq and to provide "substantial economic assistance" to
countries being harmed by the disruptions in the region.
   Meanwhile, Saddam Hussein put new bureaucratic obstacles
in the path of the Western women and children he had promised
could leave Iraq and Kuwait earlier this week. State
Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler called the new
restrictions "inhumane and disgraceful."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As the standoff between the U.S. and Iraq continued,
President Bush said at a White House press conference, "It is
important that the considerable burden of the effort be
shared by those being defended and those who benefit from the
free flow of oil."</p>
<p>He said that the administration is calling on Japan, South
Korea, West Germany, Saudi Arabia and the oil-rich Gulf
states to provide financial and energy resources to help meet
the cost of deploying troops and to assist nations such as
Turkey, Egypt and Jordan, which are suffering economically as
a result of the sanctions. Mr. Bush plans to dispatch
Secretary of State James Baker to Europe and the Gulf and
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady to Asia to spearhead the
"consulting and coordinating effort."</p>
<p>President Bush added, "There's no total price tag I have
in mind" for the effort.</p>
<p>But the president also said, "U.S. forces should never
appear to be mercenary forces, and that will not be the
outcome of this, I can guarantee you."</p>
<p>Japan announced a wide-ranging assistance package earlier
this week that it said had a value of $1 billion, but Mr.
Bush indicated at his news conference that he would be
pushing Tokyo for more.</p>
<p>Responding to the president's call, Sulaiman Mutawa, the
exiled Kuwaiti minister of planning, said his country has
"made a straightforward commitment" to pick up part of the
cost of the military efforts under way in the Middle East.
"The precise numbers haven't been thrashed out," he said.
"But our government stands ready to provide economic
support."</p>
<p>Ms. Tutwiler said Iraq now is demanding that foreign women
and children write letters stating that they want to depart
and that the letters must be translated into Arabic. In
addition, she said, the Iraqis are demanding that the letters
bear a stamp from unspecified "appropriate fiscal
authorities" showing that all Iraqi taxes have been paid.</p>
<p>Iraqi officials earlier had asked for a list of those who
wish to depart. Such a list hasn't yet been provided by U.S.
embassy personnel in Baghdad.</p>
<p>Privately, a State Department official said that some
Americans being held hostage by Iraq may be reluctant to
comply with the procedures. The official said that some of
the women hostages are worried that providing the information
could inadvertently reveal the whereabouts of their husbands,
who haven't been told they can leave.</p>
<p>At yesterday's news conference, Mr. Bush said, "I feel
very concerned about Americans that are held against their
will." But he added: "We cannot permit hostage-taking to
shape the foreign policy of this country, and I won't permit
it to do that."</p>
<p>The president also said he doesn't anticipate "major
imbalances in the oil market," adding that the U.S. Strategic
Petroleum Reserve was "available if it is truly needed." He
vowed that U.S. efforts would "go on as long as it takes" to
force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait and release its foreign
hostages. He dismissed suggestions that U.S. costs be
underwritten by a war tax.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush praised the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries for being willing to increase output to offset the
loss of oil supplies created by the isolation of Iraq.</p>
<p>During his press conference, Mr. Bush stated several times
that "we have no argument with the people of Iraq." Although
Mr. Bush doesn't list toppling Saddam Hussein as one his
goals, U.S. officials are hoping that the United
Nations-backed economic sanctions and military show of force
will create sufficient domestic pressures to lead to the
Iraqi dictator's downfall. Mr. Bush said "it wouldn't
disappoint me" if the Iraqi people conclude that Saddam
Hussein was the cause of their problems. The president's
remarks came as U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar arrived in Jordan for talks today with Iraq's foreign
minister, Tariq Aziz.</p>
<p>President Bush also expressed support for the Kuwaiti
resistance and "anybody that can have a hand in restoring
legitimacy there to Kuwait."</p>
<p>He acknowledged that economic measures against Iraq may be
hurting civilians in that country more than the government,
but he said: "There's nothing that's painless." He dismissed
Saddam Hussein's suggestions that he, Mr. Bush and British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher have a debate. "You can put
an empty chair there {for me}," the president said.</p>
