	<p class="article-leader">William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., said there wasn't any truth to rumors that Bank of New
England Corp.'s major bank was facing seizure by federal
regulators.
   "That's just not true; it's not about to be closed," he
said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A torrent of hearsay has circulated recently that the bank
would be seized before Labor Day weekend. The talk reached a
fever pitch yesterday when Ted DiMauro, a candidate for
Congress in Massachusetts' second district, issued a news
release saying -- erroneously -- that the FDIC had liquidated
the bank.</p>
<p>Representatives of the campaign did not return telephone
calls.</p>
<p>After reporting a $1.1 billion loss last year, the bank is
struggling to return to profitability. The bank continues to
be hurt by the slumping New England economy and a large
portfolio of nonperforming loans, especially in real estate.</p>
<p>The FDIC's Mr. Seidman said he is scheduled to meet
Tuesday with Lawrence Fish, Bank of New England's chairman,
"to talk about their plans for restructuring the bank."</p>
<p>The comptroller of the currency, as the bank's primary
regulator, normally would be the main government contact with
Bank of New England. But Mr. Seidman said he is meeting with
Mr. Fish because the bank has requested that the FDIC waive
some of its rules to facilitate the restructuring.</p>
<p>"This is ridiculous," said Lee Cross of the comptroller's
office. "First off, the FDIC doesn't even recommend the
closing of a bank. The Office of the Comptroller does. And we
haven't. This is a categorical denial. We have not
recommended the bank be closed."</p>
