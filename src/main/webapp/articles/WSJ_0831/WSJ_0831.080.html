	<p class="article-leader">It cannot be doubted that the political culture "inside
the Beltway" has contributed mightily to this country's
outlandishly large and "uncontrollable" budget. But
Washington wouldn't be Washington without folks outside the
Beltway panting after it for handouts. Example: The Ketchum
Area Rapid Transit district carts passengers around the Sun
Valley resort area in Idaho for free. Even then, the buses
are rarely crowded. Vacationers use them, but the local
service workers "don't seem to want to," one board member
noted. Nevertheless, KART may expand to provide yearround
"rush hour" commuter service for nearby towns in the Wood
River Valley, which is growing rapidly with expensive homes.
Break-even cost: $2.91 per rider if the buses were full. How
to pay for this unwanted luxury? Of course] Board member Guy
Coles wants to seek federal matching funds. We'll be watching
how Idaho's conservatives in Congress handle this one.</p>
