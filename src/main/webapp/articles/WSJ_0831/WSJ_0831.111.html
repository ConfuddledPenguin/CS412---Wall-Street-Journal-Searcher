	<p class="article-leader">After reporting a 70% plunge in first-half pretax profit,
Sweden's Esselte AB slashed its full-year profit forecast by
50% and said it will intensify a world-wide cost-reduction
drive including hefty job cuts at all major divisions.
   Esselte, the world's biggest office-supplies group, blamed
the need for retrenchment on a surprisingly rapid downturn in
key markets that accelerated during the second quarter.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company's chief executive officer, Hans Larsson,
declined to estimate how many jobs would be lost. He said
details would be disclosed within a month.</p>
<p>Esselte said first-half profit before tax plunged to 97
million Swedish kronor ($16.9 million) from 327 million
kronor a year earlier. Operating profit skidded 26% to 445
million kronor from 603 million kronor the previous year,
with divisions for office products and information systems
reporting the steepest declines.</p>
<p>Esselte's financial costs during the period ballooned 49%
to 295 million kronor -- mainly the result of heavy borrowing
to finance several acquisitions last year. First-half sales
increased 7.7% to 8.56 billion kronor from 7.95 billion
kronor a year earlier, the company said.</p>
