	<p class="article-leader">WOLFSBURG, West Germany -- Volkswagen AG said group profit
rose 6.2% in the first half of 1990 to 428 million marks
($274.4 million) from 403 million marks a year earlier.
   Sales at the West German auto maker also rose 6.2% to
35.24 billion marks from 33.18 billion marks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Volkswagen said profitability was hurt by increasingly
strong competition, economic difficulties in Brazil and
Argentina, and disadvantageous foreign exchange developments.
The company cited good domestic and foreign car demand as a
factor in unit sales, which rose 2.8% to 1,544,791 from
1,502,485 units a year earlier. But sales slipped 2.1% within
West Germany to 442,585 units from 452,027 units, while
foreign sales rose 4.9% to 1,102,206 units from 1,050,458
units a year earlier.</p>
<p>The company said it expects the good economic conditions
that have characterized the West German market so far to
continue in the second half. It also cited expectations of
higher demand from the economic union formed between the two
Germanys July 1.</p>
<p>Sales of Volkswagen cars in Western Europe rose 1.7% to
1,179,011 units. The company said high demand for its Passat,
Golf and Jetta models couldn't be fully satisfied because of
capacity restraints. VW plans special weekend shifts in
September to help satisfy demands for its cars.</p>
<p>The company cited hardening competition, overcapacity and
price wars as negative factors in the U.S. market, but said
it succeeded in boosting deliveries 0.9% to 101,458 cars. The
introduction of the Passat model had a positive impact,
Volkswagen said.</p>
<p>Volkswagen boosted car output to 1,576,083 units in the
first half from 1,519,689 the year before. The company said
Wednesday it is almost certain it will have record output of
more than three million units for all of 1990.</p>
