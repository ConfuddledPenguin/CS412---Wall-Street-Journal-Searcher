	<p class="article-leader">The task of the budget summit has always been difficult.
It has become even more difficult as the economy has slowed
and events in the Middle East have accelerated. Increases in
the gasoline tax, deeper defense cuts and other options that
appeared attractive to some a few weeks ago now must be
viewed in a different context. The choices are tougher. But
one critically important element of a successful summit
hasn't changed -- agreement between Congress and the
president on a budget process that will work.
   The existing process doesn't work. Not once since the
enactment of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings has an annual deficit
target been met. The national debt has tripled -- to $3
trillion -- since 1982. The fastest-growing element of the
federal budget is not defense or Social Security or Medicare,
but interest on the national debt: Interest payments now
exceed $182 billion per year. And all of this has occurred in
an era of unprecedented economic growth.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Persistent deficits producing mounting debt remain the
most pressing domestic issue facing our country. The crisis
in the Middle East only highlights the danger of leaving
ourselves vulnerable, as we are, to external events and
economic pressure from abroad. But however bad America's
dependence on foreign oil may be, the vulnerability arising
from dependency on foreign lenders is at least as dangerous.
How often and how vigorously does the borrower or the
prospective borrower pick a fight with his or her banker?</p>
<p>As a practical matter, a solution to the budget deficit
problem will almost certainly require increased revenues. But
unless the budget process is changed, those new revenues will
pay for more federal spending, not deficit reduction.</p>
<p>Gramm-Rudman was supposed to trigger across-the-board cuts
in the budget if Congress and the administration fail to
reach agreement on a more selective and judicious reduction
package. It has never worked as it was intended to, for four
principal reasons:</p>
<p>-- Gramm-Rudman relies on future projections, not on past
performance. The across-the-board cutbacks are triggered when
the Office of Management and Budget makes its early October
projection of the next fiscal year's deficit. If the
projection exceeds the Gramm-Rudman target by $10 billion or
more, the president must implement the cuts on Oct. 15.</p>
<p>Sequestration is based on a snapshot of the budget on a
single day of the year. This encourages manipulation: overly
optimistic economic and technical assumptions; the shifting
of spending and revenues from one year to the next; the
deliberate underestimation of spending. To top it all off,
spending additions enacted anytime after Oct. 15th don't
count.</p>
<p>-- Gramm-Rudman focuses on the wrong number. Deficit
projections are the product of simple arithmetic: Expenditure
minus Revenue equals the Deficit. The temptation, then, is to
understate expenditures and overestimate revenues. Some OMB
projections have been off course by as much as $100 billion.</p>
<p>To overcome temptation, we need to rely less on deficit
projections and more on expenditure limits. Real spending
control is the key to real deficit reduction.</p>
<p>-- Gramm-Rudman has no valid enforcement mechanism. The
Gramm-Rudman targets have never been met. But there are no
sanctions.</p>
<p>-- Gramm-Rudman punishes the good spending programs along
with the bad. Assume for a moment that sequestration is
actually going to take place. If you were playing this
bureaucratic game, what would you do to protect your favorite
spending program? Why, boost the funding level as much as
possible before the cuts. That way, when sequestration takes
place, the program's "real" base would remain intact. If
instead, in the spirit of Gramm-Rudman, you tried to keep
your program lean, sequestration would take real muscle out
of your budget. So Gramm-Rudman as now written can act as a
subtle mechanism for budget inflation.</p>
<p>Despite all these problems, Gramm-Rudman remains the best
starting point for fashioning a workable process, given
political realities. However, to make it work requires
credible budget assumptions and enforceable sanctions for
failure.</p>
<p>Good budget enforcement starts with good spending
controls. Five principles should therefore dominate the
reform of the budget process:</p>
<p>-- Put everything -- including Social Security and the
savings and loan bailout -- on-budget.</p>
<p>-- Set firm spending limits on a multiyear basis.</p>
<p>-- Make the spending caps stick.</p>
<p>-- If overspending is not fixed promptly by the president
and Congress, put automatic cuts on offending program
categories.</p>
<p>-- Base those cuts on real numbers, not projections.</p>
<p>The Truth-in-Budget plan would be based on real numbers,
it would have enforceable sanctions and it would punish only
those programs that exceeded their budget caps.</p>
<p>This is a non-partisan proposal. It does not address such
questions as how to spend, or whether to impose additional
taxes. All it aims to do is to ensure that, during future
budget debates, the president and Congress talk straight
about the problem and face up to the need to make corrections
if spending goes off course.</p>
<p>That, in itself, would be a major step forward. But
Truth-in-Budgeting would offer one more benefit to the
American public: By enforcing caps on government spending, it
would ensure that if revenues were raised to diminish the
deficit, the money would be spent as promised. Is that really
asking too much?</p>
