	<p class="article-leader">Texas Industries Inc., Dallas, completing payment of an
acquisition made in 1985, said it paid $50 million and 1.2
million of its common shares, or 11% of its stock
outstanding, to Co-Steel Inc. of Toronto.
   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Texas
Industries closed unchanged at $19, giving the stock a value
of $22.8 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The cash and stock represent the second half of a two-part
payment agreement between Texas Industries and Co-Steel. In
1985, Co-Steel sold its 50% stake in Chaparral Steel to Texas
Industries for $42 million plus a payment to be based on
Chaparral's performance in fiscal 1986 through 1990.</p>
<p>The agreement called for the stock part of the payment to
be placed in a five-year trust starting in 1990. During the
five years, Texas Industries will retain voting rights, as
well as first-refusal rights to purchase the shares if
Co-Steel decides to sell them. The shares increase Co-Steel's
Texas Industries stake to more than 20%.</p>
