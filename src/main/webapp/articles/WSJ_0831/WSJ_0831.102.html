	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A rebound in oil prices, partly because of
continuing uncertainties in the Mideast crisis, sent bond
prices falling, and the two together helped drive stocks
lower.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 39.11 points in
thin, volatile trading to close at 2593.32. Long-term U.S.
Treasury bond prices fell about a half-point, or about $5 for
each $1,000 face amount, in light trading. The dollar
strengthened as investors sold yen after a widely anticipated
interest-rate boost in Japan.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The October futures contract for crude oil rose 85 cents a
barrel to close at $26.77. Saddam Hussein denied rumors that
Iraq was ready to negotiate its way out of Kuwait, suggesting
that the stalemate in the Mideast may deepen.</p>
<p>"The morning opening {in stocks} was a little queasy
because of oil futures prices," said Frank A. Cappiello Jr.,
president of McCullough, Andrews & Cappiello, a San Francisco
money manager. "That's the whole game right now."</p>
<p>An abrupt sell-off in stocks in the final hour of trading
was caused partly by traders slimming positions ahead of the
long weekend. Stock-index arbitrage sell programs, in which
traders sell stocks and buy stock-index futures to lock in
profits from fleeting price differences between the two
markets, accentuated the decline.</p>
<p>"The programs influenced the market a little bit more than
usual" because of light trading activity, said Peter
VandenBerg, senior vice president at Shearson Lehman
Brothers. The 120.9 million-share volume on the New York
Stock Exchange was the lightest since 119.4 million shares
changed hands July 9.</p>
<p>Consumer-related stocks fell sharply in response to
plunges in the Conference Board's and University of
Michigan's indexes of consumer confidence. Wal-Mart Stores
and May Department Stores stocks each sank more than 4%.</p>
<p>Some bond analysts said the decline in that market was
small considering how high prices rose the day before. "We
went real far real fast Wednesday," said Roberta D. Olson,
fixed-income portfolio manager at Banc One Asset Management,
Columbus, Ohio, "and then with oil bouncing back, bonds had
to come back some."</p>
<p>The Japanese central bank's boost in its key lending rate
to 6% from 5 1/4% yesterday affected the dollar more than
bonds, said Nicholas Sargen, currency and international
fixed-income analyst at Salomon Brothers. "That announcement
had already been priced into the yen," he said, and traders
yesterday used the old strategy of "buy on the rumor, sell on
the news."</p>
<p>In major market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices fell in light trading. Declining Big Board
issues outnumbered advancers, 998 to 482.</p>
<p>Bond prices fell. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond rose to 8.97%.</p>
<p>The dollar rose. In late New York trading, the currency
was quoted at 1.5640 marks and 144.35 yen, compared with
1.5595 marks and 143.60 yen Wednesday.</p>
