president and chief executive officer.
   Mr. Carmany, a former executive vice president who left
the company last year in a dispute with management, also was
named a director.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Comprehensive Care, a provider of chemical dependency
programs, said its former president, W. James Nicol, who was
removed as chief executive officer, will continue to serve as
a board member. Norman L. Perry, president of Tree Products
Enterprises, was named chairman of the company, succeeding
Stanley Nelson, who was also removed from the post.</p>

stockholders. All of the directors, except Mr. Nicol, are new
to the board. There are now eight board members.</p>
