	<p class="article-leader">LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- A shareholder of TCBY Enterprises
Inc. filed a class-action lawsuit late Wednesday in federal
court here charging that the company defrauded investors by
concealing problems and misrepresenting its financial
condition.
   The plaintiff, Kenneth Irvine, says in the lawsuit that he
bought 500 shares of TCBY stock on Jan. 8 for about $20 a
share. Subsequently, Mr. Irvine contends, the company
repeatedly hid problems and misrepresented its outlook, until
admitting in a news release this week that earnings had
fallen.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As previously reported, TCBY said Monday that its earnings
for the third quarter ending Aug. 31 would drop to between 25
cents and 30 cents a share, from 43 cents a share in the
year-earlier period. Since the announcement, the stock --
which has been dropping for months -- has fallen to below $8
a share.</p>
<p>Mr. Irvine seeks unspecified damages on behalf of everyone
who bought TCBY stock between Oct. 16 of last year and Aug.
27, 1990.</p>
<p>Mimi Hurst, a TCBY spokeswoman said, "Our attorneys have
examined the litigation, and they and we have concluded that
the allegations are without merit. We intend to vigorously
defend ourselves." TCBY, based here, is a large franchiser of
retail shops that sell frozen yogurt.</p>
