	<p class="article-leader">Despite losing a proxy battle earlier this year, Dallas
financier Harold Simmons continues to press for an increased
stake in Lockheed Corp.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
NL Industries Inc., a Houston-based specialty chemicals
manufacturer controlled by Mr. Simmons, said it proposed that
Lockheed directors instruct the trustee of the company's
employee stock ownership plan to sell 10 million unallocated
Lockheed shares to NL for $35 a share. NL also asked the
board to amend its poison-pill provisions to permit such a
purchase. As an alternative, NL suggested that Lockheed's
board amend the poison pill to permit NL to purchase as many
as 10 million shares on the open market. The company also
said it wouldn't vote the 10 million shares for three years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under Lockheed's poison-ill provisions, acquisition by Mr.
Simmons of more than 20% of Lockheed's stock could lead to
the issuance of shares that would dilute his stake.</p>
<p>The SEC filing stated that a group including NL currently
holds 12.5 million shares of Lockheed common stock, or 19.8%
of the stock outstanding. That includes 510,700 shares
acquired between Aug. 15 and Aug. 29 at prices ranging from
$26.25 to $28.625 a share, the filing said.</p>
<p>The proposal dovetails with Mr. Simmons's contentions that
Lockheed management created the ESOP to entrench itself. In a
complaint filed in federal court in Los Angeles soon after
the proxy fight, NL alleged that Lockheed's management and
directors breached their fiduciary duties and "manipulated
the corporate machinery" by placing millions of shares in
friendly hands through an employee stock ownership plan and
then intimidated employees into voting in management's favor
at the annual meeting, held in March.</p>
<p>According to yesterday's filing, NL recently amended that
complaint. Jeffrey Davidson, an attorney representing NL,
said that the amended complaint contains new claims relating
to the size of the ESOP created by Lockheed and the company's
disclosures about the ESOP. Basically, Mr. Davidson said, NL
is claiming that "Lockheed's public disclosures on the size
of the ESOP aren't true." He added that NL has added
allegations that Lockheed violated federal securities laws
relating to public disclosures.</p>
<p>In a letter to Lockheed Chairman Daniel Tellep, J. Landis
Martin, president and chief executive officer of NL, states
that "what we did not fully understand until very recently --
and what has never been disclosed to Lockheed's other
shareholders -- is that the ESOP operates in a way that
enables the board to transfer effective control of Lockheed
to the ESOP." At today's market prices, he added, the
transfer of control can be completed in just a few years.</p>
<p>According to NL's filing, the creation of the ESOP
increased Lockheed's debt by $500 million. NL argues that the
$350 million in proceeds from the sale of shares should be
used to reduce the ESOP's indebtedness.</p>
<p>For Lockheed's plan to acquire ESOP shares to succeed, the
ESOP's trustee would first have to agree to sell the
unallocated shares. Those shares were purchased with a loan
guaranteed by Lockheed and remain suspended in a special
account until they are disbursed to plan participants.
Lockheed, the nation's sixth-largest Pentagon contractor, has
63.2 million shares outstanding. The ESOP holds a 20% stake,
including about one million allocated shares and roughly 11.8
million unallocated shares.</p>
<p>Chuck Wert, a senior adviser at U.S. Trust Co., the ESOP
trustee, said he hadn't studied the NL proposal in any detail
yet and couldn't comment on it. "It's going to take some time
to determine the prudence and validity of it," he said. "We
have absolutely no position now." He added, however, that
Lockheed's board wouldn't have any bearing on the trustee's
actions. "It's an independent fiduciary decision," he said.</p>
<p>Even if the trustee agrees, it isn't likely that Lockheed
would lift the poison pill. In Calabasas, Calif., a company
spokesman wouldn't comment on the proposal. In the past,
however, Mr. Tellep has said that he is reluctant to rescind
the poison pill completely because of the company's
vulnerability to "coercive and unfair takeover tactics."</p>
<p>In an interview earlier this week, Mr. Tellep said he had
met with Mr. Simmons and his chief strategist, Mr. Martin, in
Santa Barbara, Calif., three weeks ago to brief them on the
status of Lockheed programs. But the Lockheed chairman didn't
mention whether the ESOP proposal had been discussed.</p>
<p>For the past year, Mr. Simmons and Lockheed have engaged
in an often contentious cat-and-mouse game. Mr. Simmons
bought and sold Lockheed shares several times while remaining
coy about his intentions. He finally announced in February
that he would wage a proxy war against the defense company,
seeking to capture control of the board.</p>
<p>After a bitterly contested campaign in which Mr. Simmons
and Mr. Tellep frequently exchanged barbs, Mr. Simmons's
proposed board was handily defeated.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Lockheed closed at $26.375, down 37.5 cents.</p>
