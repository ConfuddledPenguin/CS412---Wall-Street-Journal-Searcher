	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Budget crunches and sinking morale are
doing what Baby Face Nelson and Pretty Boy Floyd never could:
undermining the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
   Long viewed as the nation's premier police force, the FBI
today lacks the money, manpower and technical resources to
handle its expanding and ever-more-complex workload. Always
selective about what cases it has taken, the agency now
concedes that it ignores major crimes squarely within its
jurisdiction.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Lawrence Lawler, special agent in charge here, says he
doesn't have enough agents to investigate savings-and-loan
fraud allegations involving losses of less than $250,000.
"That's thousands of cases we aren't dealing with," he says.
The 525-agent office is investigating only five of the scores
of telemarketing operations in Los Angeles suspected of
selling bogus precious metals and real estate. Local
authorities investigate a few more; the rest "operate
unfettered," Mr. Lawler says.</p>
<p>Special Agent Kevin Kelly is using pencil, paper and a
calculator to try to untangle the convoluted paper trail of a
suspected $55 million money-laundering operation; there is a
computer terminal, but he has to share it with 13 other
agents. In San Francisco, where immigrants from Vietnam and
other Asian countries have formed violent new crime
syndicates, the FBI office doesn't have a single agent who
speaks Vietnamese to monitor wiretaps or do undercover work.</p>
<p>In Newark, N.J., rows of empty steno-pool desks signify
dozens of secretarial positions unfilled because the FBI
doesn't pay enough to attract local high school graduates.
Agents do their own typing at the sacrifice of "street time."</p>
<p>Things may get worse. An anticipated wave of retirements
and resignations over the next five years could strip the FBI
of half of its most experienced agents. Many are taking early
retirement at age 50. Another "huge wave of guys are about to
quit" well short of retirement eligibility because of salary
complaints, warns Larry Langberg, president of the FBI Agents
Association, a private advocacy group.</p>
<p>Until the past decade, FBI pay exceeded that of most local
police. Today, though, federal agents in Los Angeles make
$5,000 to $13,000 a year less than local officers with
comparable credentials. Similar disparities exist in other
cities, including Boston, Chicago, Newark and San Francisco.
(Agents in New York City -- but nowhere else -- receive
annual cost-of-living bonuses.)</p>
<p>FBI officials in Washington talk optimistically about
proposed legislation that would improve the starting salary
of $27,000 a year and extend the New York bonus program to
other cities. But morale among street agents has already
slumped, says Gary Lisotto, the No. 2 man in the Los Angeles
office. For his part, Mr. Lisotto, 48 years old, says he will
stay long enough to qualify for a pension -- less than two
years -- "and then I'm gone."</p>
<p>The ability of the bureau's 9,800 agents, to be sure, is
still unsurpassed in many areas. Years of painstaking
undercover work, for example, have paid off recently with
scores of convictions of major mob figures.</p>
<p>But overall, the FBI's reputation for sophistication and
self-confidence is eroding, senior agents themselves concede.
One reason is that the reputation has always been based
partly on myth. J. Edgar Hoover, the agency's director for 48
years, favored targets that generated impressive statistics,
such as bank robberies and car thefts. He eschewed messy
narcotics cases and, until shortly before his death in 1972,
didn't even acknowledge the existence of organized crime.</p>
<p>The FBI thus "appeared to be winning" whatever Mr. Hoover
defined as its "war on crime," says James Fyfe, a
criminologist at American University in Washington.</p>
<p>Without the master image crafter in charge, the FBI's
responsibilities have exploded, while its budget, viewed in
inflation-adjusted dollars, has grown only moderately, to
about $1.5 billion a year.</p>
<p>The bureau has brought some of the additional work on
itself. It lobbied hard in the early 1980s for a role in the
widening federal "war on drugs." Congress authorized the
bureau to participate but didn't provide money for most of
the additional agents the FBI expected. Currently, the bureau
receives funding for about 600 drug agents but actually has
1,200 on the job. The difference is made up by transferring
people from other areas, which necessarily suffer.</p>
<p>In Los Angeles, the bank-robbery squad has shrunk to 14
agents from 40 over the past three years, while the number of
bank hits is expected to rise to 1,700 this year from 1,300
three years ago. It now takes, on average, seven robberies
before the squad can identify a holdup man they haven't seen
previously, says Mark Llewellyn, the unit's supervisor. Three
years ago, when there were more agents to chase down leads,
it took three or four robberies.</p>
<p>While drugs have absorbed more manpower, financial crimes
within the FBI's purview have grown in number and complexity
-- to the point where they baffle many agents. Years ago, a
bank case entailed "$1,000 missing from a teller's cage,"
recalls Dick Held, chief of the bureau's San Francisco
office. Today, he says, agents and supervisors struggle to
understand the real-estate schemes and insider loans at the
heart of many bank and thrift failures.</p>
<p>"We simply don't have the experienced agents to put on
these cases," agrees Mr. Lawler of the Los Angeles office.
Low salaries make it hard to recruit experienced accountants,
who can earn twice as much working for a private firm. For
agents, most training for white-collar crime work comes
haphazardly on the job.</p>
<p>The bureau's lack of expertise in financial-fraud
investigations helps dictate its strategy in S&L cases:
seeking indictments based on a few isolated transactions,
rather than trying to prove larger conspiracies. "We put
blinders on {and} . . . stop with the first case {we} can
make," says Mr. Lawler's deputy, Mr. Lisotto.</p>
<p>Even in the area of criminal identification -- once an FBI
specialty -- the bureau now finds itself behind the times.
The FBI's legendary fingerprint files are only partly
automated as a result of slashes in technical budgets to pay
for more agents. The optical-scanning equipment the bureau
does have dates to the mid-'70s. In most cases, arduous
matching done by hand causes delays of four to six weeks in
identifying prints taken from a crime scene. By that time,
many crooks are long gone, says Sue Schnitzer, supervisor for
violent crimes in the bureau's San Francisco office.</p>
<p>Several states, led by California, have more sophisticated
systems, allowing fingerprint matches to be made by computers
in hours, not weeks. Says Dennis Kurre, chief of the FBI's
Identification Division: "We are no longer state-of-the-art."</p>
