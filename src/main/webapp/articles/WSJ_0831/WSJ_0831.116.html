	<p class="article-leader">Circus Circus Enterprises Inc., Las Vegas, Nev., reported
net income of $16.3 million, or 59 cents a share, or a 25.2%
drop, for its second quarter, ended July 31, compared with
net of $21.8 million, or 76 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose 26% to $176.4 million from $139.7 million.
   The results included an $11.2 million write-off of
pre-opening expenses for the company's Excalibur casino
resort in Las Vegas, which opened June 19. Excluding the
write-off, earnings would have amounted to 86 cents a share,
which was within analysts' expectations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In its first 43 days of operation, the 4,032-room
Excalibur resort generated about $11 million in operating
income and had an operating profit margin of 25%, the company
said, and it accounted for nearly all the company's growth in
revenue and operating income. Circus Circus Las Vegas, the
company's other major Las Vegas Strip property, posted a
decline of more than 15% in operating income. The company
cited a drop in walk-in traffic caused by the Excalibur
opening and the presence of Golden Nugget Inc.'s new Mirage
resort. July also was a soft month for casinos, as the July 4
holiday came in midweek.</p>
<p>For the six months, Circus posted net of $35.6 million, or
$1.29 a share, down 13% from $40.8 million, or $1.40 a share,
a year earlier. Revenue rose 16% to $309.7 million from
$267.2 million.</p>
