	<p class="article-leader">VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Galactic Resources Ltd. and
Cornucopia Resources Ltd. said they agreed to a previously
proposed merger, through a stock swap with an indicated value
of about US$29.3 million.
   Under the planned merger, which is expected to close by
December, pending various conditions including shareholder
approvals, Galactic will issue 0.55 of a new Galactic common
share for each of Cornucopia's shares outstanding, the
companies said. Galactic owns 16.3% of Cornucopia's 19.4
million shares.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Cornucopia
shares closed at US$1.4375, up 9.375 cents, and in American
Stock Exchange trading, Galactic shares closed at US$2.75,
down 12.5 cents.</p>
<p>Robert Friedland, Galactic's founder and vice chairman,
said the combined company, which will be run by Galactic's
current management, is expected to produce more than 200,000
ounces of gold next year from its mines in South Carolina,
Colorado and Nevada, ranking it among North America's larger
producers. Galactic expects to produce about 140,000 to
150,000 ounces of gold this year, he said.</p>
<p>Galactic initially proposed to merge with Cornucopia in
May, by swapping half of a Galactic share for each share of
Cornucopia. Galactic has about 45.7 million shares
outstanding.</p>
<p>Separately, Galactic said a unit and its partner agreed to
refinance Galactic's 48%-owned Ridgeway mine in South
Carolina. Under the refinancing, Galactic said, the partners
will repay a US$31.4 million gold loan, among other things,
netting Galactic a profit of about US$3.3 million.</p>
