	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Prices of some corn and wheat futures contracts
sank to life-of-contract lows during the trading session amid
forecasts for good growing weather and weak exports.
   Prices have slipped during the week because warm weather
in the Midwest is speeding the development of the corn and
soybean crops, which had been slowed for much of the summer
by unusually cool and wet weather.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>According to Richard Feltes, director of research at Refco
Inc., Chicago, the warm weather pattern also is reducing the
chances that the crops might be damaged by any early frost.
Analysts have been speculating that the slow development of
the crops increased their vulnerability to any unusual cold
snap. In 1974, for example, a frost swept through southern
Minnesota in the first week of September.</p>
<p>"We are taking out the frost premium," Mr. Feltes said.
"We don't have any evidence that we have another 1974 on our
hands."</p>
<p>In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade yesterday, the
corn contract for September delivery dropped 4.75 cents a
bushel to settle at $2.4525 a bushel.</p>
<p>The soft red winter wheat contract for September delivery
dropped nine cents a bushel to settle at $2.6675 at the
Chicago Board of Trade. During the session, it dropped to a
life-of-contract low of $2.665 a bushel.</p>
<p>Although much of the U.S. wheat crop is harvested, wheat
prices are slipping because export sales since early June
have dropped about 29% below the same 1989 period.</p>
<p>Analysts aren't sure whether wheat sales will pick up
anytime soon. The Soviet Union is usually a major buyer of
U.S. crops in the fall. Some analysts have speculated that
the recent rise in oil prices would help oil-producing
nations such as the Soviet Union generate more revenues and
that at least some of those funds would be used to finance
purchases of U.S. grain. However, the Soviet Union is
harvesting a sizable crop of its own and has been struggling
with severe credit problems.</p>
<p>Analysts are watching for signs that the U.S. government
might more aggressively use subsidies to encourage wheat
exports. Under the Export Enhancement Program, the
Agriculture Department compensates exporters that sell crops
at a discount to certain nations such as China and the Soviet
Union.</p>
<p>Because of the warm spell, some analysts are mulling
whether to increase their estimates of the corn and soybean
crops. Hot weather in the Mississippi Delta region and the
Southeast is damaging crops there. But those losses would
probably be overshadowed by gains in the Midwest, which is a
much larger producing region, analysts said.</p>
<p>Richard A. Loewy, president of AgResource Co., Chicago,
said he might raise his harvest forecasts after he studies
next week's crop condition reports from the farm states.</p>
<p>Mr. Loewy has been predicting a U.S. soybean harvest of
1.85 billion bushels and a U.S. corn harvest of 7.97 billion
bushels.</p>
<p>In other commodity markets yesterday:</p>
<p>COFFEE: Futures prices rose on concerns over available
supplies of green, unroasted coffee. The December contract
ended 2.75 cents a pound higher at $1.0380. A number of
developments pushed prices higher in active trading,
according to Arthur Stevenson, analyst for Prudential-Bache
Securities. Prices within Brazil for coffee are strong, and
as a result exporters are reluctant to sell aggressively, he
said. Weather has also been a contributing factor, as rains
have slowed the coffee harvest, which began in May. "By this
time the crop usually has been collected, but at the moment
it has been delayed," Mr. Stevenson said. Colombia, the
world's second-largest coffee grower and exporter after
Brazil, recently reduced export authorizations, which is
leading some traders to anticipate some tightness in
available supplies of the better grades of coffee, he said.
Stocks in Central American producing nations are quite low at
the moment. The Central American crops will soon begin to be
harvested, but a pinch may be felt until then, he said.</p>
<p>ORANGE JUICE: Futures prices again declined. The
soon-to-expire September contract, which plunged 5.95 cents a
pound Wednesday, again fell, dropping 2.80 cents to $1.6065.
November and January contracts were off by their
five-cent-a-pound limit, while March and May showed
near-limit declines. According to Judith Ganes, analyst for
Merrill Lynch, supplies of Brazilian new crop orange
concentrate are expected to begin arriving in the U.S. in
September. Most of these supplies already are committed to
buyers, she said, but there is a possibility that a cargo of
several million pounds may not yet have found a buyer. Some
traders are expressing concern that if this shipment isn't
sold, it could be submitted for certification to be delivered
against September futures contracts, Ms. Ganes said. If it
was possible that the concentrate would arrive in time to be
delivered against September contracts, Ms. Ganes said, then
September should have declined more in anticipation of such
deliveries. As it is, deferred positions are showing a
two-day drop of as much as 10 cents, compared with a total of
8.75 cents for September, she noted. "It is not surprising
that there would be some uncommitted product, given that
there is a 37 cents difference between the current Brazilian
cash price of $1.85 a pound and that of the November contract
at $1.4830," Ms. Ganes said.</p>
