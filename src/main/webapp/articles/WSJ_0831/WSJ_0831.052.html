	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- GTS Corp. said it has formed a seismic-data
reprocessing and marketing joint venture with the Laboratory
of Regional Geodynamics of Moscow.
   GTS, which provides seismic data and data-processing
services for oil and gas exploration, said the venture will
be self-supporting through its contracts.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As part of the equal-partnership venture, the two concerns
will process existing onshore and offshore seismic and
geophysical data for areas in the Soviet Union that have
recently been opened to international energy exploration
companies.</p>
<p>In addition, GTS will assist in upgrading the seismic-data
equipment of a Soviet research vessel, which is owned by the
Moscow laboratory. GTS will also augment the vessel's staff.
The vessel will be used in the near future to obtain new
seismic data under contracts with international oil concerns.</p>
