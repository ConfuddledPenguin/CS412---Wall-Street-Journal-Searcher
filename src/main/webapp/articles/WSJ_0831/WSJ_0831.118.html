	<p class="article-leader">California's four largest publicly owned energy utility
companies will be allowed to profit directly from some of the
energy savings generated from their conservation efforts
under a new program approved Wednesday by the California
Public Utilities Commission.
   The companies also have agreed to boost their collective
spending for consumer rebates, education and other
conservation-related programs by roughly 50% to about $500
million over the next 28 months. The programs could produce
$1 billion in energy savings, the commission estimates.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Conservation has been low on the totem pole" of
priorities for most utilities because "we're asking them not
to sell their product," said Patricia M. Eckert, one of
California's five utility commissioners. "This (program) gets
their attention by giving them an incentive and reward."</p>
<p>An unusual coalition of energy companies, consumer groups,
industry associations and regulators hammered out the plan
over the past year in response to a commission request for
ideas about how California could push conservation and
energy-efficiency more aggressively.</p>
<p>In recent months, some other states also have given
financial incentives to utility companies to support
conservation programs. Besides California, "Massachusetts,
Rhode Island and New York have gone the furthest, though it's
hard to make direct comparisons," said Don Schultz, a
California commission planner who has been closely involved
in the state's program.</p>
<p>To pay for the California utilities' conservation
programs, small rate increases -- less than 1% in most cases
-- have been approved. "It will cost money in the short run,
but in the long run the savings could be four or five to one
if new power plants won't have to be built," Ms. Eckert said.</p>
<p>Different mechanisms for measuring conservation and
related financial benefits will be used by the participating
utilities San Diego Gas & Electric Co., Southern California
Edison Co., a unit of SCEcorp., Southern California Gas Co.,
a unit of Pacific Enterprises, and Pacific Gas & Electric Co.
Each company helped to devise its own performance formula.</p>
<p>Southern California Edison, for example, will add the
costs of its conservation programs to its rate base just as
it would the costs of a new power plant, Mr. Schultz said.
Pacific Gas & Electric is expected to split an estimated $200
million in benefits this year on an 85%-15% basis, with
customers getting 85% and the company and its shareholders
15%.</p>
<p>Mr. Schultz said that the companies could incur penalties
if they fall short of minimum goals, but "it's more likely
they will be rewarded than penalized."</p>
<p>Southern California Edison said it will nearly double its
conservation spending to about $63 million over the next two
years. Pacific G&E said its conservation program costs this
year will jump about 40% to $138 million. Southern California
Edison said it will spend about $39 million this year, and
San Diego Gas & Electric said it will spend $25 million over
the next 16 months on new energy-saving programs.</p>
<p>Most of the programs pay cash rebates to residential and
commercial builders to encourage use of energy-efficient
designs, materials and fixtures. Cash rebates also will be
made to consumers and retailers who buy and sell
energy-saving appliances and lighting systems.</p>
<p>California regulators said they view the new financial
incentives for utilities as "experimental." The commission
will reassess the program in 1992, Mr. Schultz said.</p>
