	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stock mutual fund investors are heading for
the hills.
   Spooked by the Middle East crisis, investors are yanking
money out of stock funds and stuffing their cash into drab
but safe money market funds.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Two months ago, stock fund sales were on target for their
best year ever, topping even the banner year 1986. But in
July, the flow of dollars into stock funds slowed to a
trickle, and this month money started cascading out of stock
funds.</p>
<p>August has been "the worst month since October 1987 {when
the stock market crashed} in terms of net outflows" from
stock funds, Gavin Quill, a marketing research analyst with
Scudder, Stevens & Clark, said. "It was pretty much spread
across the board." Other fund groups also reported dismal
stock fund sales during August, though they pale beside the
$7.5 billion net outflow of October 1987.</p>
<p>For much of this year, stock funds have pulled in more
cash than they surrendered to departing shareholders. In May,
inflows hit a frenzied peak of $4.4 billion, the fund
industry's best month since April 1987. But according to the
Investment Company Institute, inflows in June slowed to $1.7
billion, and stock funds in July pulled in a modest $131
million. These numbers include sales, less redemptions, plus
the net effect of switches between stock funds and other
funds in the same fund family. Reinvested dividends are
excluded.</p>
<p>In August, the slowdown in stock fund sales seems to have
turned into a rout. Dalbar Financial Services of Boston
estimated that stock funds hemorrhaged about $1.8 billion in
assets during August. Dalbar's estimate is a projection based
on data from 112 stock funds, which represent 1/10th of the
industry's stock fund assets.</p>
<p>Stock fund investors have a reputation as lousy market
timers. They tend to buy like crazy near stock market peaks,
and sell heavily after the market has already fallen steeply.</p>
<p>Dalbar Financial President Louis Harvey reckons that this
month's stock fund outflows may prove equally ill-timed.
"Many of the people who switched on the bad news are probably
already sorry," he said. "The people who move are almost
invariably making the wrong move. The best bet is a
buy-and-hold strategy."</p>
<p>Mr. Harvey noted that those investors who buy stock funds
directly from fund groups, rather than going through a broker
and paying a commission, seem to have been the quickest to
bail out of stock funds in August. The broker-sold fund
groups, by contrast, survived relatively unscathed.
"Surprisingly, it's been a booming month for equities," said
Henry Schmelzer, an executive vice president with New England
Securities, which has funds that are sold through insurance
agents.</p>
<p>Robert Leo, director of mutual funds at the Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc. unit of American Express Co., said new
sales of stock funds are down 40% this month, but redemptions
and exchanges out of stock funds are up only modestly. "We
have had a net outflow {from stock funds}, but nothing of
extraordinary dimensions," Mr. Leo said. "Many of the big
fund groups like Vanguard and T. Rowe Price and Fidelity are
seeing a lot of switches. These people often don't use
brokers. Our investors are longer term. We haven't seen a lot
of exchanges."</p>
<p>But while there has been heavy switching out of stock
funds at the three fund groups mentioned by Mr. Leo, even
these firms have something to cheer about.</p>
<p>"If you look at the business as a whole, it's been a good
month," Michael Hines, a marketing vice president at
Boston-based Fidelity Investments, said. "Though we've seen
net redemptions {out of stock funds}, our research shows that
people still plan to invest in equities in the months ahead."</p>
<p>At T. Rowe Price Associates, Baltimore, much of the money
coming out of its stock funds went into the firm's money
market funds. As a result, T. Rowe Price only had a modest
outflow of assets from the fund group overall.</p>
<p>At Scudder, more than 90% of the money that went out of
stock funds ended up in another Scudder fund. By contrast,
Scudder managed to hang on to only half the money that left
stock funds in October 1987. "What you find on the money
market side {during August} is the mirror image of what
happened elsewhere," Scudder's Mr. Quill said. "Net, as a
family of funds, we gained very slightly."</p>
<p>Not all stock funds hemorrhaged assets. Vanguard Group's
stock-index funds picked up new money in August, as did its
energy and gold sector funds. Franklin Resources' gold fund
had strong new sales, but also was hurt by large exchanges
out of the fund. "You tend to get faster money with the gold
fund, particularly with the market timers," Gregory Johnson,
a marketing vice president at Franklin, said.</p>
<p>According to the Investment Company Institute, stock fund
managers turned slightly more bullish in July, cutting their
cash positions to 10.7% of assets from 10.8% in June. Numbers
gathered by Indata, a service of Gordon, Haskett & Co.,
indicate this trend didn't last. Indata, which keeps tabs on
57 stock mutual funds with assets of $20 billion, said the
cash position at these 57 funds now is at 11.6%, up from
10.2% at the end of July.</p>
<p>During July, bond funds pulled in $1.7 billion more than
they surrendered to departing shareholders, the third month
in a row of net inflows. But in August, bond funds appear to
have bled assets. Massachusetts Financial Services, T. Rowe
Price and Vanguard all reported net outflows from their bond
funds.</p>
<p>Investors fearing a recession pulled money out of
high-yielding "junk" bond funds in August. T. Rowe Price High
Yield Fund, which had been the firm's best-selling bond fund
for the previous three months, was the biggest loser in
August. Massachusetts Financial, Shearson and Vanguard also
reported net outflows from their junk funds.</p>
<p>While money flowed out of junk funds, it flowed into funds
that buy bonds that are of higher quality or have shorter
maturities. But during August, the biggest winner of all has
been the money market funds, which buy Treasury bills and the
very short-term corporate IOUs known as commercial paper.
Much of the money switched out of bond and stock funds has
ended up in money market funds.</p>
<p>Though fund groups are pleased to keep money in the fund
family, burgeoning money market funds are a mixed blessing
for them. "Money funds are less profitable than long-term
funds," Avi Nachmany, an analyst with Jesup & Lamont Inc.,
said. "If you get into an environment of a sustained shift
from long-term funds to short-term funds, you'll get a
decline in profitability."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Corrections & Amplifications</p>
<p>STOCK MUTUAL FUNDS lost an estimated $1.8 billion in
assets in August, mainly because of investors' switching to
other funds. If the estimate proves correct, the loss would
be the worst since February 1989. The historical comparison
was misstated in the headline of an article in Friday's
edition.</p>
