	<p class="article-leader">ENGLEWOOD, Colo. -- Hedged Securities Associates Inc. and
its founder, James D. Donahue, plan to file today for
protection under the federal Bankruptcy Code, according to
Robert Dill, an attorney who represents Mr. Donahue and the
firm.
   Mr. Dill said Hedged Securities, a limited partnership,
plans to file under Chapter 11, which gives businesses
protection from creditors while formulating a reorganization
plan. Mr. Donahue plans to file under Chapter 13, which gives
similar protection to individuals, Mr. Dill said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The planned filings mark the latest chapters in an
investment scandal that began unfolding last week when Mr.
Donahue told a meeting of 500 investors that he had lost more
than $100 million of their money through stock-option
trading. Mr. Donahue's message was made via videotape.</p>
<p>Weyerhaeuser Co., based in Tacoma, Wash., filed a lawsuit
yesterday in U.S. District Court in Denver accusing Mr.
Donahue of fraud, breach of contract and violation of certain
federal retirement securities laws. Weyerhaeuser said its
pension fund lost an estimated $35 million by investing in
Hedged Securities.</p>
<p>In a lawsuit filed last week in a state district court
here, Paradigm Partners Inc. of Chicago said a pension fund
it controls lost more than $15 million through its Hedged
Securities investments. In a similar suit, Houston-based
Union Texas Petroleum Holding Inc. said its pension fund lost
about $8 million.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, attorneys for Paradigm and Union Texas asked
a state judge to appoint a receiver to take over the troubled
firm. Hedged Securities staved off that action by agreeing
not to oppose the appointment of a receiver if it fails to
file for bankruptcy by early this afternoon.</p>
<p>Mr. Dill said the "sheer volume of names and contracts"
prevented Hedged Securities from making a bankruptcy filing
earlier in the week.</p>
