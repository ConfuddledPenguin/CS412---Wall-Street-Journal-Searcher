	<p class="article-leader">WORRY GROWS about lack of a clear-cut solution to the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   As hopes fade for a quick resolution, some U.S. analysts
fear that time will undermine the alliance against Saddam
Hussein and move events increasingly beyond U.S. control. The
U.S. has expressed concerns to U.N. Secretary General Perez
de Cuellar about his activities, stressing that his role
isn't to negotiate but to reaffirm that the U.N. wants Iraq
out of Kuwait.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Saudi monarchy and Egypt's Mubarak remain steadfast in
their desire to see Hussein toppled, U.S. officials say. But
the State Department worries about talk from other Egyptians
of finding a face-saving way out for him, such as a deal in
which Iraq withdraws from Kuwait and is replaced by an Arab
League peacekeeping force led by Egypt.</p>
<p>Some U.S. officials fear that the Saudis too will begin
thinking about cutting a deal if they become convinced that
the U.S. won't strike at Hussein.</p>
<p>RESENTMENT RISES toward Japan over trade and the Gulf
situation.</p>
<p>Many see Japan backsliding on its recent trade commitments
to the U.S. The forest-products industry says Japan hasn't
opened its market as pledged earlier this year; despite
previous optimistic signs, Allied-Signal has made little
progress in its thorny patent dispute; U.S. manufacturers say
the bidding process at Japan's new Kansai airport hasn't been
opened up as promised.</p>
<p>In the Mideast, many see Japan's plans to aid affected
countries as insufficient. "It wouldn't be unreasonable to
expect Japan to pay for 35% to 40% of America's costs in
conducting a military campaign to protect the oil fields,"
says Kemper Financial Services economist David Hale. Such
complaints about Germany are fewer because of the huge costs
of reunification.</p>
<p>BUDGET TALKS revert to square one -- the size of the
package.</p>
<p>The Bush administration, worrying that next year's deficit
could top $300 billion, still wants a deal cutting it by $50
billion. But even its Capitol Hill allies question whether
that big a package is now feasible. The Mideast crisis, they
say, could add $6 billion to defense spending next year, and
it will be difficult to find that money elsewhere.</p>
<p>Some lawmakers also argue that a $50 billion package, on
top of increased oil prices, would seriously harm the
economy. In the meantime, the White House is steaming over
House GOP Whip Newt Gingrich's call for tax cuts rather than
tax increases. Budget officials say they may rely on
Democrats alone to get any package through the House,
ignoring the dissident Republicans.</p>
<p>The new turmoil virtually assures that next week's
three-day budget meeting at Andrews Air Force Base won't
produce a deal.</p>
<p>BUSH AIDES suggest the Iraq crisis may bring lasting
improvement in ties with Syria. They don't see any change in
character by Syria's calculating President Assad, but reason
that the showdown with his Iraqi enemies and his inability to
rely on automatic help from the Soviet Union in the post-Cold
War world give him incentive for better relations with the
U.S.</p>
<p>RETURN TO SENDER: Rep. Hank Brown, the Republican Senate
nominee in Colorado, attempted to donate $9,000 in S&L
political contributions he received to the Resolution Trust
Corp. But the money was sent back because federal law doesn't
permit gifts earmarked for particular agencies.</p>
<p>NEXT: TRUMP TURNPIKE? Cash-strapped states and localities
increasingly look to the private sector for services and
facilities. H. Ross Perot is backing construction of an
airport outside Fort Worth; in Virginia, a privately owned
and financed toll road between Dulles International Airport
and Leesburg is scheduled for completion in 1993.</p>
<p>THE CHECK'S IN THE MAIL: The GOP Senate campaign
committee's latest gimmick: sending people genuine checks for
$25. The catch: Depositing the check automatically authorizes
the committee to deduct $12.50 a month from the recipient's
bank account. Common Cause calls the letter deceptive, saying
many people will forget or won't be able to figure out how to
stop the debits.</p>
<p>BUSH FACES a juggling act as he campaigns for GOP
candidates this fall.</p>
<p>He plans to stick to his heavy schedule of political
travel but must balance his partisan responsibilities with
the need to maintain foreign-policy unity. He is likely to
tread lightly on the Gulf situation, using it subtly to sound
patriotic themes. Discussing the budget, though, may prove
even trickier.</p>
<p>Angered by Democrats' posturing, Bush can pound away at
them for now. But with the specter of massive automatic
spending cuts taking effect Oct. 1 unless a deal is reached,
Bush will have to decide whether to moderate the fiery
rhetoric in order to get a deal.</p>
<p>Quayle, under fewer constraints, will bear more of the
partisan attack, lashing Democrats as big spenders and
talking up the GOP as the party of a strong defense.</p>
<p>MINOR MEMOS: James Schlesinger, energy secretary under
Carter, says, "The country was unprepared to embrace the
moral equivalent of war, so we may have to settle for the
real thing." . . . A new T-shirt in Ocean City, Md., bears
the American flag and the words, "Try and burn this, Iraq." .
. . A bumper sticker in New York reads: "No Mo' Cuomo."</p>
