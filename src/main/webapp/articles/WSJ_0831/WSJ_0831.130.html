	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The stock market resumed its retreat as
nervousness about the crisis in the Middle East, along with
higher crude-oil prices, took its toll.
   "A lot of the optimism we had that this" crisis would soon
be over "now seems to be fading," said Philip J. Eagan,
manager of equity trading at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. "It
seems to be drawing out now."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Stocks dropped sharply and showed weakness across the
board, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average snapping a
four-session string of gains by falling 39.11 to 2593.32.
Decliners topped advancers by 998 to 482 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The market's fall came amid the lightest activity on the
Big Board since July 9. Volume totaled 120,890,000 shares,
down from 134,240,000 shares Wednesday, and trading slowed to
a crawl during the afternoon as many players wound down their
dealings in advance of the Labor Day weekend. "It looks like
we're just wasting away until the holiday is over," Mr. Eagan
said.</p>
<p>Among broader market indexes, Standard & Poor's 500-Stock
Index dropped 5.48 to 318.71, the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Index dropped 2.55 to 175.23 and the Dow Jones
Equity Market Index lost 4.55 to 295.58.</p>
<p>Several rounds of sell programs linked to stock-index
arbitrage swept through the market during the session,
traders said, and fueled a late sell-off that led the Big
Board to put its "uptick" requirement for arbitrage-related
stock sales into effect.</p>
<p>The "uptick" rule was implemented at 3:50 p.m. EDT after
the Dow Jones industrials showed a loss of 50 points. For the
rest of the session, traders had to wait until stocks had
risen in price to carry out arbitrage selling.</p>
<p>Although stocks bounced off their lows after the rule went
into effect, September S&P 500 futures contracts closed -- as
they did at the close of Wednesday's session -- at a level
that could spark sell programs at the opening of today's
session.</p>
<p>The futures dropped 5.30 to 318.55 -- a discount of 0.16
point to the actual S&P 500 index. Arbitrage selling took
effect once the S&P contracts were about even with the index.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar
arrived in the Middle East to begin discussions with Iraqi
Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz, but there was little else in
Middle East news to reassure the market that progress toward
a peaceful settlement of the conflict could be reached.</p>
<p>Amid the resulting jitters, crude-oil prices retraced part
of Wednesday's sharp decline. October crude-oil futures rose
85 cents a barrel, to $26.77, in New York trading after
tumbling nearly $2 a barrel in the previous session.</p>
<p>As a result of the stock market's latest slide, the
industrial average is showing a double-digit percentage
decline for August. The average has dropped 311.88 points, or
10.7%, from its July 31 close of 2905.20.</p>
<p>"August was a tough month. There was a lot of damage done
to consumer psychology, to investor psychology," said Charles
I. Clough Jr., chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch &
Co.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Mr. Clough said the Bank of Japan's
decision to raise its discount rate by 0.75 point, to 6%,
points toward yet another potential barrier to higher stock
prices: the relatively tight monetary policies of central
banks, including the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>Stocks are unlikely to rebound from their sell-off anytime
soon, Mr. Clough said, "unless we see a time when central
banks can feel free to put liquidity into the {banking}
system," or ease credit.</p>
<p>Energy stocks, which held firm Wednesday despite the steep
drop in oil prices, headed lower in the face of the oil
market's rebound. Chevron slipped 1 1/2 to 75 1/4, Exxon fell
1 to 48 7/8, Texaco dropped 1 1/8 to 62 1/8, Mobil lost 7/8
to 63 and Amoco dropped 1 3/8 to 54; among oil-services
issues, Schlumberger eased 3/8 to 64 and Halliburton fell 3/4
to 52 1/2.</p>
<p>Unisys dropped 1/2 to 8 1/8 as 1.3 million shares changed
hands. Prudential-Bache Securities downgraded the stock to
"hold" from "buy," although analyst Rick J. Martin told Dow
Jones Professional Investor Report he still expects a major
turnaround at the company in the fourth quarter. Analysts at
Cowen & Co. and Goldman Sachs cut their estimates of the
company's 1990 earnings, and Cowen lowered its 1991 forecast
as well.</p>
<p>Selling spilled into other technology issues.
International Business Machines fell 2 1/8 to 101 3/4, Compaq
Computer dropped 2 1/4 to 48 1/4, Hewlett-Packard slid 1 1/4
to 35 1/4 and Tandem Computers lost 3/8 to 16.</p>
<p>Rumor-driven selling hurt Bank of New England, which
skidded 5/8 to 1. Ted Dimauro, a Massachusetts congressional
candidate, issued a press release saying -- erroneously --
that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. was about to seize
the financially troubled bank holding company.</p>
<p>"This is ridiculous," says Lee Cross, spokesperson for the
comptroller of the currency's office. "First off, the FDIC
doesn't even recommend the closing of a bank. The office of
the comptroller does. And we haven't. This is a categorical
denial. We have not recommended the bank be closed."</p>
<p>Melville tumbled 3 to 42. Smith Barney, Harris Upham,
which had maintained a buy recommendation on the retailing
stock since November 1988, downgraded it to hold and reduced
1990 and 1991 earnings estimates.</p>
<p>Analyst William N. Smith told the Dow Jones investor
report that Melville's August performance has been "very
disappointing" and its sales appear soft.</p>
<p>Other retailing issues also ran into selling. Wal-Mart
Stores dropped 1 1/4 to 27 3/4 on 1.6 million shares, May
Department Stores dropped 2 to 44 1/2, Circuit City Stores
lost 1 1/4 to 17 7/8, Home Depot slid 1 3/8 to 33 7/8 and TJX
dipped 3/4 to 13 1/4.</p>
<p>Newmont Mining, which filed to offer 12 million common
shares and warrants to purchase an additional six million
shares, fell 3 3/8 to 44 1/2. Through the offering,
Consolidated Gold Fields will cut back its 49% stake in
Newmont.</p>
<p>Other precious-metals stocks finished unchanged to higher
as the price of gold held steady. Homestake Mining gained 1/4
to 20 1/8, Hecla Mining went up 1/8 to 11 1/8, Placer Dome
closed unchanged at 17 5/8, Battle Mountain Gold closed
unchanged at 10 3/4 and ASA went up 1 to 49 5/8.</p>
<p>Student Loan Marketing Association gained 5/8 to 42 1/4. A
number of analysts who follow Sallie Mae are trying to lure
portfolio managers back into the stock, based on the belief
that it won't suffer any losses as a result of financial
difficulties facing Higher Education Assistance Foundation, a
major student-loan guarantee agency, The Wall Street Journal
reported yesterday in its "Heard on the Street" column.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 1.32
to 322.91. Volume totaled 10,750,000 shares.</p>
