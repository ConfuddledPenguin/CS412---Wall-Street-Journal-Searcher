	<p class="article-leader">Oil prices rose on renewed jitters that a solution to the
Persian Gulf crisis might not be found quickly enough to
prevent a tight supply situation, climbing 85 cents a barrel
to $26.77.
   Traders late yesterday said they perceived that peace
initiatives by the U.N. seemed destined to produce little
progress.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Product prices moved upward more quickly than crude prices
because market participants are finally realizing that if and
when a shortage as a result of the embargo of Iraqi-Kuwaiti
crudes arises, it will likely hit the products sector first.
"We are consuming products faster than we are producing
them," said Ted Eck, economist for Amoco Corp. "There are no
refined products in the strategic petroleum reserve, just
crude."</p>
<p>Gasoline futures prices for September delivery rose 4.35
cents a gallon to 89.07 cents, while heating oil for the same
month climbed by 3.90 cents to 75.54 cents.</p>
<p>Indeed analysts and industry executives are becoming
increasingly concerned that the longer the crisis persists,
the more difficult it will be to replace dwindling product
supplies. Under the best of situations, refining capacity in
the U.S. can barely meet the needs of consumers. Mr. Eck
added that world-wide the war has already knocked out 600,000
barrels a day of refining capacity in Kuwait, where several
sophisticated facilities capable of putting out high-quality
refined products have been closed down.</p>
<p>Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries Wednesday promised to increase their output by at
least three million barrels daily to make up for the
Iraq-Kuwait shortfall. But at least for the short term,
markets will remain short of one million barrels of daily
production.</p>
<p>Remarks made by Sun Co. Chairman Robert McClements to
analysts yesterday did little to allay fears. He told the
gathering that the additional production brought on line by
global producers during the crisis would be of lesser quality
than crude that has been previously available. These crudes,
he explained, will yield less gasoline and other refined
products.</p>
<p>In addition, reports that oil workers in Brazil were
threatening to strike sparked buying in the gasoline pit.
Brazil exports gasoline to U.S. markets. Also perceived as
bullish were reports by Dow Jones International Petroleum
Report that Yemen, a small Middle Eastern producer, would be
unable to export any oil in September because it needed to
use all of its oil internally. Yemen feeds some of its
refineries with Iraqi crude.</p>
