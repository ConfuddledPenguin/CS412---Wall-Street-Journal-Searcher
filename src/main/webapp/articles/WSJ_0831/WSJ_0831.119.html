	<p class="article-leader">Centel Corp., a cellular-communications concern, said it
intends to sell its electric operations by January to focus
more attention on its local-exchange telephone and cellular
businesses.
   Chicago-based Centel provides electric service to more
than 136,000 customers in Colorado and Kansas. Centel
Electric had revenue of $165 million in 1989, while reporting
operating profit of $29 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the company's telephone and cellular operations are
its bread and butter. "This proposed sale continues our
restructuring to focus on those operations that provide
greater opportunity for growth and return for shareowners,"
said John P. Frazee Jr., Centel's chairman and chief
executive officer.</p>
<p>The company recently agreed to sell its Centel
Communications Systems unit, a voice and data systems
operation, to a group headed by investor Edward H. Lavin Jr.,
and now is seeking to sell its electric unit as well.</p>
<p>In the past three years, Centel has acquired more than $1
billion in cellular properties while selling its cable
television operations and Centel Federal systems, which sells
data systems to federal agencies. It also has divested itself
of its interest in two long-distance carriers.</p>
<p>Centel indicated it had received overtures from entities
interested in buying Centel Electric, but wouldn't say who
the potential buyers might be.</p>
