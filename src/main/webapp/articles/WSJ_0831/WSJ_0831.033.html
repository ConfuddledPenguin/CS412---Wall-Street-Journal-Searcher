	<p class="article-leader">DENVER -- U S West Cable Communications, a division of U S
West Inc., and United International Holdings said they formed
a $100 million joint venture to acquire overseas
cable-television systems and related businesses.
   To be named United Communications International, the joint
venture will buy an 86% interest in Norkabel, the second
largest cable-TV operator in Norway, and acquire a 25% stake
in Swedish Cable & Dish, the second largest cable operator in
Sweden.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Norkabel serves 118,000 basic subscribers in southern
Norway. Swedish Cable & Dish serves 96,000 throughout Sweden.</p>
<p>U S West, based in Denver, said it has a 90% interest in
the joint venture. "A partnership has different sharing
ratios as money is being returned," said William Elsner,
president of United International. He said his company will
eventually have about a one-third interest in the deal.</p>
<p>The venture's board will consist of an equal number of
representatives from each partner, with United International
acting as the managing partner.</p>
<p>U S West already participates in cable operations in the
U.K., France and Hong Kong. Denver-based United
International, formed last year by former officials of United
Cable Television Corp., manages domestic media investments
and international cable television systems.</p>
