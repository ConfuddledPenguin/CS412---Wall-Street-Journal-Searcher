	<p class="article-leader">New York -- Dropping out of high school is not a wise path
for most people, but when Pete Sampras pondered the
alternative his choice seemed clear. "I could have gone to
college, met a girl and got married]" he says in not-mock
horror. "That would have been it for me."
   And, indeed, young Sampras, a likable, gangly,
curly-haired, just-turned-19-year-old two years out of
school, is thriving. He is blissfully unmarried and his mind
is untroubled by the complexities of higher learning. He's
not exactly on the dole, either; his earnings this year have
exceeded $350,000, and he has prospects for better.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As you probably have guessed by looking at the nearby
picture, Sampras is a tennis player, and the world's
12th-ranked male at that. He was engaged yesterday at the
U.S. Open here, where he defeated Peter Lundgren of Sweden in
a second-round match. If the seeders' wisdom holds, he's
headed for a meeting with sixth-seeded Thomas Muster of
Austria for a crack at his first quarterfinal berth in a
Grand Slam tournament.</p>
<p>And if Sampras has not penetrated the national
consciousness to the degree of, say, Andre Agassi or Michael
Chang, who both are about his age, he one day might. We have
this from no less an authority than Arthur Ashe, a winner
here in 1968 and '69.</p>
<p>"At the start of this year, Pete was this far from the
top," says Ashe, holding his forefinger and thumb a generous
three inches apart. He narrows the gap to about a half-inch
and adds: "Now he's this far."</p>
<p>Jack Kramer, another former Open champ (1947 and '48), and
tennis majordomo and teacher, goes further. "One of these
days, Sampras could be the one they're all looking up to," he
says. "He has the parts of a great game; I'd say his ground
strokes already are sounder than {John} McEnroe's ever were.
He's just got to put them together."</p>
<p>The game to which Kramer refers, and relishes because he
(and Ashe, too) played it, is a variety of tennis called
"serve and volley" or, more descriptively to the uninitiated,
"bash and dash." Its central idea is to make it to the net as
quickly as possible, the better to whap the ball past the
player on the other side.</p>
<p>The style saves wear and tear on sneakers, and gets people
home for dinner on time. It is most effective on concrete
(like here) and grass (like Wimbledon), surfaces that don't
unduly detain a bouncing ball. Boris Becker and Stefan
Edberg, who've won five of the past six Wimbledons, do it. So
does McEnroe, who triumphed there thrice and here four times.
So have most other winners of tennis's two premier events.</p>
<p>It's worthy of note that S&Vers always are in a minority,
and that of the top young American hopefuls in this annual
tennis-and-noise fest, only Sampras is a consistent enlistee.
One reason for the form's poor enrollment is that many
players, no matter how talented, lack the necessary will to
whack. Another is that it almost always requires a radical
change of style for those who take up the game at an early
age.</p>
<p>"Young kids are too short to serve well enough to do it,"
Kramer points out. "If you want to win in the juniors, you
mostly stay back."</p>
<p>Sampras, who now stands six feet tall, fit that mold until
age 14. He played a baseline game featuring the topspin
forehand and two-handed backhand favored by most of his
contemporaries around Rancho Palos Verdes, his southern
California home town. Trouble was, the best of the other kids
were beating him.</p>
<p>"Dr. Pete Fischer, a physician I hit with, talked me into
changing," he recounts. "I already had a good serve, but to
volley effectively I had to switch to a one-handed backhand.
That was the hardest part by far. It took me two years to get
decent with it."</p>
<p>But decent he got, and results followed. In 1987, he was
runnerup to Chang, already his old California sparring
partner, at the Boys National 18s in Kalamazoo, Mich., and he
beat Chang in the U.S. Open juniors here.</p>
<p>Sampras turned pro the next year, before his senior year
of high school, after convincing his parents that further
schooling might be a detriment to his pursuit of tennis
riches (he plans to take an exam to get a diploma, but hasn't
gotten around to it). He gained a 97th-place ranking on the
Association of Tennis Professionals' computer at the end of
1988, and finished the next year at 81st.</p>
<p>He vaulted to his present, lofty ranking largely on the
strength of victories at the U.S. Pro Indoor in Philadelphia,
where he beat Agassi and the veterans Tim Mayotte and Andres
Gomez, and at a Wimbledon-tuneup tourney on grass in
Manchester, England. In other notable 1990 outings, he led
1989 French Open winner Chang three games to none in the
third and deciding set in a Canadian Open semifinal before
losing, and took a set from Edberg, the men's present No. 1
(and, incidentally, a first-round upset victim here), in the
same round of a July go in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Those losses pointed up the weaknesses in Sampras's game;
lack of stamina did him in against the relentless Chang on a
very hot day, and lack of concentration was fatal against
Edberg. "I got kind of careless and loose in the last set,"
he says of the latter bout. "Maybe I was just glad to have
taken a set from him." He also admits to a tendency to try to
hit a better shot than he needs to win a point.</p>
<p>He's running and working with weights under the direction
of his coach, Joe Brandi, to get stronger. "The concentration
part is coming along, too, although sometimes better than
others," he allows.</p>
<p>But as for the overhitting, well, that's not so bad, is
it? "When I see a ball sitting up there, I have this urge to
bash it," he smiles.</p>
<p>Spoken like a true S&Ver.</p>
