	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- France's consumer price index in July rose 0.3%
from June and was up 3% from a year earlier, confirming
previously reported preliminary results, the National
Statistics Institute said.
   The latest data put the index -- in which 1980 is equal to
100 -- at 183.6, up from 183.1 in June and 178.2 in July
1989. The final result represents a slight acceleration from
June, when monthly price growth came in at 0.2%.</p>
