	<p class="article-leader">BUENOS AIRES -- Argentina's newspapers are full of
surprises these days.
   First President Carlos Saul Menem offered to mediate the
crisis in the Middle East; next he proposed to supervise
talks between Cuba and Spain on their current brouhaha and
all this following his recent announcement that by 1995
Argentina would join the ranks of the world's 20 -- no five
-- wealthiest countries.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the headlines are nothing compared with the tabloid
illustrations. Picture this: Presidential Adviser Maria Julia
Alsogaray, the Argentine equivalent perhaps of Elizabeth Dole
(or maybe Jeane Kirkpatrick), a paradigm of Argentine
conservatism, currently charged with the sale of the
state-owned phone company, a woman who traded on a schoolmarm
image of tailored suits, sober blouses fastened severely at
the collar with cameo pins, and Miss Grundy shoes; Maria
Julia Alsogaray suddenly appears full-blown on the cover of a
sensationalist magazine, clad only in a fur stole]</p>
<p>However Ms. Alsogaray may explain her decision to unveil,
her choice of furs has left her husband in a peculiar
position. He is an ecologist and director of the Fundacion
Vida Silvestre, Argentina's oldest and most respected
wildlife and conservation society. But Ms. Alsogaray
apparently enjoys President Menem's full support. Among other
things, her actions wiped reports of Mr. Menem's marital
disputes right off the front page.</p>
<p>The confident optimism that led Ms. Alsogaray to exhibit
her middle-aged body in poses typical of Playboy cheesecake
seems to have come from her recent success in allegedly
selling off Entel, the public telephone company. That sale
has been billed as one of the masterworks of the Menem
administration's steps to salvage the Argentine economy. But
"the new Maria Julia," like the administration she
represents, seems in danger of falling for her own press
releases and airbrushed photos rather than facing the
unvarnished reality.</p>
<p>In fact, the privatization of Entel appears to offer more
benefits to the buyer than to the nation. Under the terms of
Ms. Alsogaray's sale, the Argentine government guarantees the
buyer of Entel an annual income of 16% of Entel's net worth
-- in U.S. dollars. Ms. Alsogaray's team brushed over the
fact that government payments could run easily up to one
billion dollars a year, and has focused instead on the
savings that the sale of Entel presumably means for the
government -- up to $700 million a year in operating costs --
and on Ms. Alsogaray's image as the businesswoman of the
year.</p>
<p>The recent rush of privatizations has been presented to
the press and to the public as major achievements, difficult
but vital to bring economic stability to Argentina. However,
some of these operations more resemble corporate raids than
stockholders' sales. Both Aerolineas Argentinas and Entel are
being sold for a fraction of their net worth. The sales price
of the first was little more than the cost of two of the
fleet's Boeings. The cost of the second, Ms. Alsogaray's
baby, was less than a third of the estimated value of its
assets (although the 16% guaranteed income is based on the
assets, not on the sales price).</p>
<p>But finalization of the Entel deal has been stalled, in
part because Ms. Alsogaray had evidently overlooked the fact
that part of the telephone system was already private,
belonging to the Eriksson Co., for she included Eriksson's
property in those sold with Entel. Now the government is in
the peculiar -- and costly -- situation of having to
nationalize a private telephone company in order to give it
away. Even though the government boasts that it is bringing
in private-sector know-how and encouraging competition by
selling Entel in two parts (one to AT&T and to the Spanish
National Telephone Co.) these two are only management
companies, contracted out by the banks who have bought out
Entel.</p>
<p>As far as competition goes, under the new system,
telephone users don't get any choice as far as their
management goes; it's assigned geographically. When Eriksson
operated, there was at least an element of competition on the
Argentine telephone scene. Argentines will now be served by
two monopolies -- owned not by telephone companies, but by
financial groups.</p>
<p>The sale of Aerolineas Argentinas followed a similar
pattern. After disqualifying the leading foreign competition
(Varig and Alitalia), on the grounds that any airline that
already flies in and out of Argentina might find some
Aerolinea Argentinas flights superfluous and eliminate them,
the government declared an Argentine holding company the
winner of the bids to purchase its major airline. The winners
also own Austral, the only other Argentine airline.</p>
<p>Like Eriksson, Austral was once a private enterprise that
was nationalized, recapitalized by government, and then sold
(at a loss) to its current owners. So the privatization has
effectively turned two airlines into one, eliminated the
competition that once existed, and presented stockholders
with partners who have no experience in airline management.</p>
<p>The sale of state-owned businesses is supposed to increase
efficient service and to end mismanagement. This is hardly
likely to occur if the state enterprises go from being
indebted public monopolies to becoming the private monopolies
of bankers. By preserving the monopolies and by guaranteeing
incomes that eliminate any incentives to improve services,
the privatizations are institutionalizing the same
inefficiencies that bedeviled the public sector.</p>
<p>Yet another example of political "trick photography" is
the recent sale of 6,200 miles of inner-city roads. These are
not maintenance contracts, but outright sales that mean some
40-odd tollbooths will be erected on the inner-city beltways
of Argentina; not exactly a boon for through traffic; not
exactly efficient financially for drivers to pay off the
purchase cost of the same roads when they already paid for
the construction through tax levies; and not exactly a
catalyst for competition, since the options on freeways is
limited, and the same companies bought up most of the
roadways anyway.</p>
<p>If you look carefully, the recent privatizations appear to
be designed to refill state coffers fast, roll over external
debt and make the country eligible for new loans, not to
improve public-sector management or services. Like the
pictures of the New Maria Julia, the government's economic
measures have been presented just a bit out of focus, and
with the wrinkles brushed over.</p>

<p>Correction</p>
<p>In Friday's Americas column it was incorrectly stated that
AT&T was negotiating with a Spanish company to buy
Argentina's phone system. The U.S. company that has been
involved in those negotiations is Bell Atlantic.</p>
