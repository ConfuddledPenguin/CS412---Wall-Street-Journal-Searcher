	<p class="article-leader">Alco Standard Corp., Valley Forge, Pa., said it decided to
sell the companies in its Alco Food Systems group because
they appear to lack "the inherent capacity" to achieve
long-term growth goals.
   The distribution and services concern said that no sales
transactions are pending and that it doesn't know how much
the units might bring.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company didn't indicate how much the units contribute
to annual sales and profit, but it described them as
"collectively profitable."</p>
<p>Separately, Alco Standard said it expects to establish a
reserve of about $8 million, or 13 cents a share, in its
fourth quarter, related to a judgment entered recently in
litigation. It didn't elaborate. The company expressed
confidence in having "excellent grounds to prevail on
appeal," but said it believes the reserve is an appropriate
precaution.</p>
<p>For the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30, 1989, the company
reported net income of $33.8 million, or 81 cents a share, on
revenue of $1.08 billion.</p>
