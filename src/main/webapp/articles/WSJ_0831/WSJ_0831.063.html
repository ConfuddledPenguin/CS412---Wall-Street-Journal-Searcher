	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- Chambers Development Co., which operates
waste-collection, hauling, recycling and disposal businesses
and provides industrial security services, said it agreed to
buy a sanitary landfill site and a refuse trucking operation
near Allentown, Pa. The company declined to disclose the
purchase price.
   Chambers said the acquisition is conditional on the
state's issuance of required permits. The businesses, part of
Chrin Brothers Landfill and Chrin Hauling Inc., together will
generate more than $12 million of annual sales, Chambers
said.</p>
