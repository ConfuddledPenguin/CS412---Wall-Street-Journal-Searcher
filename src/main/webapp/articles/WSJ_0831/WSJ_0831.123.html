	<p class="article-leader">Inundated with a flood of last-minute calls, the nation's
airline reservation systems reached an unprecedented gridlock
Wednesday. In the process, hundreds of travelers racing to
make a fare deadline were deprived of some of the industry's
cheapest fares in a year.
   Although nobody knows how many travelers were affected,
travel agents said a sizable number will have to pay 20% to
40% more for deeply discounted tickets in addition to a 5%
fuel surcharge on all tickets. The gridlock prevented agents
from booking tickets promptly and frustrated travelers who
tried to contact the airlines themselves and found the phone
lines jammed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"All I can tell you is I've got a lot of unhappy people,"
says Edward Goodman, head of Tri World Travels in Dallas, who
estimated that more than 100 of his clients were unable to
book the bargain rates.</p>
<p>Along with headaches for travelers, the gridlock created
enormous difficulties for many travel agencies. Some agents
said processing a ticket, which normally takes a few seconds,
became an hour-long ordeal. To help some people make the
deadline, some agents worked past midnight, staring at
maddeningly slow computer terminals or reverting to writing
tickets by hand.</p>
<p>"It was midnight madness around here," says John Unger,
president of Travel Network of Tampa, Fla. "I've never seen
it this bad. Ever."</p>
<p>A few carriers -- American Airlines, Northwest Airlines
and Trans World Airlines -- said they briefly extended the
deadline for the special fares. But the extension lasted only
through either midday or midnight yesterday, not nearly
enough time for many travelers. And many carriers, including
Delta Air Lines, USAir and United Airlines, said they
wouldn't offer the public any extensions.</p>
<p>"We've given people plenty of time and plenty of notice
about the deadline," says a spokeswoman for USAir.</p>
<p>Airlines also said travelers were to blame for the
computer problem because they waited to book their tickets
until the last minute. The nation's largest
computer-reservation system, Sabre, a unit of American, said
it handled more than 100 million messages Wednesday, a
single-day record. On a normal day, Sabre handles about 75
million messages.</p>
<p>"If it was spread out over a few days, we could have
easily handled the volume," says a spokesman for Sabre. "But
we got all the calls in a single day."</p>
<p>But critics say airlines should have been able to
anticipate and prepare for the volume. Many travelers had
reason to stall because the effective date of the 5% fuel
surcharges, caused by the Persian Gulf crisis, had been
delayed twice already this month. Critics also say some
carriers created a buying frenzy by running ads for 20% to
40% fall discounts with warnings to buy by Wednesday. "This
is your last chance," several ads proclaimed in bold letters.</p>
<p>"The whole problem was totally unnecessary and caused by
the airlines," says Chuck Layer, a travel consultant in New
York. "People were baited by the airlines to buy the
discounts."</p>
<p>The fuel surcharge went into effect after midnight
Wednesday and applied to all tickets. The fall discounts were
valid on nonrefundable, advance-purchase tickets bought
before midnight Wednesday for travel through December, or in
some cases, February. The savings were substantial: a New
York to Los Angeles ticket bought before Wednesday was $318
round trip-compared with $449 now.</p>
<p>Scrambling for such bargains, some travelers began hitting
the phones Monday, with the biggest barrage reserved for
Wednesday. Several carriers concede their phone lines were
simply overwhelmed; USAir said it received 330,000 calls that
day, or 100,000 more than normally. "Obviously, there were
people who couldn't get through or who had to wait a long
time," a spokesman says.</p>
<p>And many of those travelers gave up. Sam Cowan, for
example, says he spent four hours Wednesday evening getting
busy signals from American, in a fruitless attempt to book a
$58 fare from Los Angeles to San Francisco. When he finally
got through, he got a recording -- which told him to hold on
longer. After waiting another 40 minutes on hold, Mr. Cowan
slammed down the phone.</p>
<p>"I felt cheated," says Mr. Cowan, the president of a small
transportation company in the Los Angeles area. "If they're
going to offer a discount, they ought to make it available."</p>
<p>Travelers who tried travel agencies -- which sell about
80% of all tickets -- didn't fare much better. Although a few
agents said they somehow avoided serious delays, most said
their computer-reservation terminals were slow all day and
even virtually shut down for brief periods. "You'd ask the
computer to price a fare and it would keep saying, `Retry,'"
recalls Thomas Nulty, president of Associated Travel in Santa
Ana, Calif.</p>
<p>As the day wore on, several large agencies reported a
flood of calls from panicked and angry bargain hunters. One
major agency, Lifeco Travel Services, said call volume at its
Houston headquarters jumped 75% Wednesday. "It was
incredible," said a spokesman for USTravel Systems Inc.,
another large agency. "We got more calls than we did the day
of the San Francisco earthquake."</p>
<p>Some agents said they were able to meet the fare deadline
for their clients -- but not without putting in a lot of
overtime. In New York, one Carlson Travel Network branch
stayed opened to 3:30 a.m. to process tickets.</p>
<p>The airlines' computer-reservation systems said their
computers weren't close to being paralyzed. And the Sabre
system did shut down once last year for 12 hours because of a
software failure. But Covia, which runs the Apollo computer
system and is owned by United and several other carriers,
said it essentially reached capacity Wednesday. The system
handled 1,370 transactions a second that day. Normal capacity
is 1,200 transactions, a spokesman says, adding that two
extra processors had to be installed.</p>
<p>Other computer-reservation systems said they stretched
their system by alternating computer time among travel
agencies. But despite the problems they caused consumers,
some industry officials chose to look for the bright side. "I
guess we're happy to report we did a record amount of
business Wednesday," says a spokesman for Covia.</p>
