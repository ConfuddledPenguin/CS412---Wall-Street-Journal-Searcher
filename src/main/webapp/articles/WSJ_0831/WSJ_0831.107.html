	<p class="article-leader">PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia -- As night falls, the scene
unfolds in what was Communism's most beautiful capital.
   On the 14th-century Charles Bridge, four teen-agers with
guitars sing a Czech version of "Blowing in the Wind," as
roller skaters coast through the crowd. Nearby, a hippie
wearing a sweater stenciled with "Cannabis is Life" passes a
joint among six friends. In the baroque splendor of the main
square, a toothless lady dances to a Lou Reed tune,
encouraged by applause.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"For so long, we couldn't do anything to express
ourselves," says Prague native Mlada Muschnerova. "Now people
are so happy, they're dancing in streets."</p>
<p>With all this excitement, Prague has become one of the
hottest tourist destinations for Americans in Europe. "This
is so cool," says John Kim, an 18-year-old from Chicago, who
is visiting Czechoslovakia with 30 U.S. students. Adds
20-year-old Bill Forbes, of Dover Foxcroft, Maine, "I saw the
revolution last winter on TV. Now I want to see the
revolutionaries."</p>
<p>That's a problem: The country's top political attraction,
President Vaclav Havel, spent most of the month in Bermuda.
Other government officials are on vacation abroad. "In
August, all the real Prague people split. There are only
tourists here now," says Ondrej Mrazek, a dark-haired
student, as he hawks a newspaper written in English.</p>
<p>But although the leading revolutionaries are on vacation,
there still is plenty of political talk in the streets.
Outside a subway station, Zdenek Sykora stands in a makeshift
stall, selling "How the Ice Melted," a book about
Czechoslovakia's so-called Velvet Revolution. "A year ago, I
couldn't have had such a stall," he says.</p>
<p>At one end of Wenceslas Square, a group of Jehovah's
Witnesses thanks Jesus for his help last November, and Hari
Krishna adherents are chanting. A newly opened American
Hospitality Center, sponsored by several U.S. companies,
dispenses Cokes and maps. "It's like Disneyland," says
Suzanne A. Bartels, a banker from Walnut Creek, Calif.</p>
<p>"I never thought I would live to see Prague like this,"
says Josef Sistek of Lutry, Switzerland, who left his native
Czechoslovakia amid the Soviet invasion of 1968. "It could
take 10 years to bring this city up to Western standards. But
freedom is a pretty good thing to have in the meantime."</p>
<p>So is a place to sleep at night, which is a practical
problem this summer. While tourists have more than tripled
since last November, Prague has only 12,000 hotel beds, less
than half the capacity needed. Occupancy is running at near
100%, and prices -- once a bargain -- have reached New York
levels in some hotels. "These fast political changes didn't
leave us much time to prepare," says Miroslav Novak, an
official in Prague's City Hall. He says more hotels will be
open by fall.</p>
<p>That won't help Frederic Massip, a red-faced, 22-year-old
student from France. "I've been looking for nearly two hours,
and I still haven't found any place to sleep," he says, as he
carries his backpack. "It looks like it may be outside
again." Dozens of students are camping out in the Vodnany
woods south of the city -- or just sleeping on the bridge,
residents say. Along the Vltava River, German and Austrian
campers have set up an impromptu campground in an unused dock
that has no sewage or garbage facilities.</p>
<p>Still, Prague's city officials say they can handle such
problems. "If we want to join Europe, we are going to have to
accept all this, including the positive and negative
aspects," says Jaroslava Krutova, a City Hall spokeswoman.</p>
<p>These matters seem unimportant to the late-night crowd on
the Charles Bridge, now watching a Czech jazz trio play a
version of "Sweet Georgia Brown."</p>
