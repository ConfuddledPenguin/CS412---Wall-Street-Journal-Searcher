	<p class="article-leader">HIGASHI-KUBIKI, Japan -- "It's the best rig money can
buy," says engineer Ken Fujii about the towering, rumbling
oil-drilling rig he operates in the lush rice paddies of this
once-quiet mountain hamlet. "If there is oil, we'll find it."
   Oil? In a country that takes a perverse pride in calling
itself a vulnerable island with few natural resouces? Sure,
says Kazuhiko Itano, an assistant director of Japan National
Oil Corp., or JNOC. "We are an oil-producing country."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Not much of one, perhaps, but hope springs eternal --
though oil doesn't -- in the Japanese oil patch. So far, Mr.
Fujii, Japan's chief oil driller, and his geologists at
Higashi-Kubiki haven't displayed any Beverly Hillbilly luck.
Three of every four wells drilled in Japan are dry. Indeed,
Japan's first producing oil field wasn't found until 1891,
after 18 years of dry holes.</p>
<p>But these days Japan's oil men feel themselves under more
pressure to perform. The prospect of war in the Persian Gulf
bodes ill for the economic superpower's health. Japan is the
world's second-largest oil consumer, after the U.S.,
dependent on oil for two-thirds of its energy. Acutely aware
of that dependence, Japan's oil companies are boring away
across Japan with missionary zeal.</p>
<p>In the commuter-infested neighborhood of Chiba in suburban
Tokyo, small wells squeak the night away. In the rice-farming
hamlets of Niigata and Akita prefectures, where the winter
snows fall so heavily that some old wooden houses have
second-story doors, rusted skeletons of oil rigs are common.
A dozen miles off the coast of Niigata City, the flame of an
offshore oil platform burns day and night.</p>
<p>The Japanese quest mixes patriotism and persistence. "We
are trying to make Japan more self-sufficient in energy,"
says an executive at a state-controlled oil company. "But it
may take time."</p>
<p>Indeed. Japan imports 99% of its oil. Its purchases
account for one of every 10 barrels sold internationally. Few
Japanese know that their country produces even 1% of its oil.</p>
<p>"Most local people aren't even aware what we're doing,"
says Mitsunobu Sugiyama, an administrator at Japan Petroleum
Exploration Co., the JNOC subsidiary operating the well in
Higashi-Kubiki.</p>
<p>But, then, there's little reason they should be. The
Japanese oil men don't draw much attention to themselves.
This is no Cadillac-and-10-gallon-hat crowd. The favorite
hangout near Japan Petroleum's regional headquarters in
Niigata is a noodle shop where oil men shed their blue suit
jackets, loosen their ties, doff their shoes and slurp
seaweed noodles.</p>
<p>Here at Higashi-Kubiki, the only roughneck is a giant
machinery trailer with the English words "Automatic
roughneck" stenciled on the side. Most everything is
automated, so the site requires only eight men a shift -- and
an aproned lady to serve steaming green tea or iced barley
tea.</p>
<p>The strike-it-rich atmosphere of the Texas oil patch isn't
much in evidence here. Toshiki Takahashi, a 24-year-old
geologist at the Higashi-Kubiki rig, says: "The job is worth
doing because we make efforts to find oil for Japan even
though we don't know if it exists."</p>
<p>Actually, there is considerable evidence that it doesn't.
Of the 1.33 billion barrels of oil Japan consumed in the
fiscal year ended March 31, domestic wells produced only 4.12
million barrels, or about 0.3%. The country's estimated
reserves are 52 million barrels; by contrast, Saudi Arabia
has 255 billion barrels.</p>
<p>Still, nearly everybody in the Japanese oil industry seems
to know that Norway had no onshore oil to speak of before it
discovered vast offshore reserves in the early 1970s. Many
think they may replicate Norway's good fortune one day.</p>
<p>"Of course there is always the possibility, a high
possibility, that we will find a large reserve because we
have this vast sea," says Takazo Ichimura, deputy manager of
Japan Petroleum's Niigata division. There's an even greater
chance, he adds, in the offshore shelf under seas that Japan
doesn't control at the moment but claims, such as those
around the Soviet-held Kuril island chain north of Japan.</p>
<p>Japan's hunger for oil has caused it trouble in the past.
In 1941, after Franklin D. Roosevelt tried to cut off
Imperial Japan from the oil fields of Indonesia, Tokyo
attacked Pearl Harbor and occupied Indonesia. When the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries choked the
world's oil supply in 1973, Japan's economy ground
temporarily to a halt and inflation soared. This time around,
fears of an oil shortage have crippled the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, and interest rates have begun to creep up.</p>
<p>Such agonies -- along with legends about Japanese emperors
a millenium ago burning oil that seeped from the ground --
give oil an almost mythical importance in Japan. The
government takes domestic exploration so seriously that
computers monitoring Mr. Fujii's 18,000-foot-deep well 200
miles from Tokyo beam signals to screens at Japan Petroleum's
headquarters, where officials of the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry can watch the progress.</p>
<p>Although only a few companies explore and pump oil or gas
in Japan, two of them, Japan Petroleum and Teikoku Oil Co.,
were started with government money. All get big subsidies, as
much as 80%, to explore for oil in Japan.</p>
<p>Despite the easy money, finding young Japanese to work in
the business isn't easy. Mr. Takahashi, the geologist at the
Higashi-Kubiki rig, says he was the only one of 40 geology
students at his university to enter the oil business.
Salaries are poor, it's a low-visibility industry and work
conditions in the field are poor compared with the office
environment at other big companies, he says.</p>
<p>The few who choose oil do so because their country needs
them. "Japan needs a stable supply of oil from Japan," says
Mr. Itano of JNOC. Trying to convince the world that it will
find a real source isn't easy, though.</p>
<p>"I used to start my speeches in Washington by telling U.S.
oil people that Japan is an oil producer," he says. "It made
them laugh."</p>
