	<p class="article-leader">Dervaig, Isle of Mull, Scotland -- Keeping production
values high in a century-old stone cowshed in the middle of a
desolate, craggy Hebrides island can present unusual artistic
challenges. For instance, sheep.
   "The bloody place is surrounded by them," sighs David
Pitman, director of the Mull Little Theatre. "Once we were in
the middle of a serious play about a projectionist's booth in
wartime Glasgow, and suddenly there was a loud bleating. I
had to go out in the interval with a torch and drive the
bastards away."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Little is too big a word for Mr. Pitman's theater. It has
a mere 43 blue plush seats in six tight rows, and a stage the
size of a large bathtub. Its wee proportions have actually
earned it a place in the Guinness Book of World Records, as
the United Kingdom's smallest regularly operating theater.
(Guinness's smallest is the 30-seat Piccolo in Hamburg.)</p>
<p>Mull is an island of gorgeous, rolling moors, chilly lakes
and stark cliffs just off Scotland's Atlantic coast. It has
never been a hot destination. Samuel Johnson came here in
1773, rode through streams and bogs on a little horse that
could barely carry him, and concluded that the island had
"not many allurements, but to the mere lover of naked
nature."</p>
<p>Today Mull is still overshadowed in the Hebrides by the
bustling Isle of Skye, 30 miles to the north. Only 3,000
people live on Mull's 351 square miles (15 times the size of
Manhattan). They drive along breathtaking one-lane roads that
wind for miles under a broad sky with no trace of
civilization in sight. In the summer, tourists come by ferry
to the island's sole municipality, a pretty harbor village
called Tobermory (a name now better known as the title of a
strange Saki short story about a talking cat).</p>
<p>David Pitman came here in 1970 to escape from London,
where he wrote the "William Hickey" gossip column for the
Daily Express. The column was a dismal assignment,
dangerously entangled with the friendships and enmities of
the Express's legendary publisher, Lord Beaverbrook. "Seven
years of hell," Mr. Pitman remembers.</p>
<p>He eventually dropped out of the dish trade and wound up
running the grocery store in Dervaig, a northern Mull hamlet
where a little cluster of like-minded English escapees lived.
Among them were an actor and actress couple named Barrie and
Marianne Hesketh, who ran the Druimard guesthouse on a
hillside above the Bellart River. Next door was an old
cowshed. In 1966, the Heskeths dragged some seats into one
end of the shed, stood at the other end, and the Mull Little
Theatre was born.</p>
<p>By the time the Pitmans arrived, the Heskeths had become
the Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy of Dervaig. Their
renditions of such romantic comedies as "The Four Poster" and
"Old World" were Hebrides legends that regularly toured the
mainland and drew sellout audiences at home.</p>
<p>Mr. Pitman, a longtime theater buff, quickly found himself
drawn into this vortex. He and his wife, Kathleen, regularly
bought up 4.6% of the theater's seats. One summer he wrote
the Heskeths a two-character historical drama about Bonnie
Prince Charlie's visit to Skye. When Marianne Hesketh died
and Barrie left the island, David Pitman took over the
theater, in 1986.</p>
<p>One of the chief difficulties of the job is the limited
dramatic repertory for little casts. The Heskeths solved this
problem with some imaginative adaptations. They presented
"The Tempest" and "Macbeth" with two actors and a bagful of
puppets, and "Henry V" with one actor and a hatbox. They
wrung two-character plays out of "Miss Julie" (which only has
three characters) and "The Importance of Being Earnest" (it
lasted half an hour in the Mull version).</p>
<p>Mr. Pitman's preferred solution is to refresh the supply
himself. A tousled 53-year-old with a distracted air about
him, he potters about his store in suspenders and a paisley
bow tie and writes plays in the back room when things quiet
down. He's written plays called "Movie Time" (about the
Glasgow projectionist's booth), "Dear Desperado" (based on a
true story about a Colorado outlaw's romance with an
Englishwoman whose sister lived in Tobermory), and "Cora" (a
turn-of-the-century musical murder mystery).</p>
<p>Over the years his store, a two-story cottage with faded
yellow paint, has moved away from groceries and into coffee
and books. Strewn with sagging shelves and cardboard boxes on
the floor, it also stocks raspberry wine, yo-yos, oatcakes,
cambozola cheese, flowered wrapping paper, shortbread and Old
Mull whiskey.</p>
<p>A handful of other local merchants help Mr. Pitman run the
theater. Across the street, Zelda Sawyer's Cottage Crafts
shop doubles as the box office. Mornings, Ms. Sawyer can
often be found sipping coffee at Mr. Pitman's place with a
mobile phone by her side in case any orders come in. Richard
Fairbairns, who runs a recording studio and a whale-watching
boat a few miles away in Quinish, supplies the plays' sound
effects. In return, the theater lobby sells tapes of his
newest recording, "Uaithne," featuring Fiona Davidson on the
clairschach, a wire-strung harp traditional out here in the
Celtic fringe.</p>
<p>The night I visited the theater, the bill was "The Woman
in Black," a melodrama about a lawyer, an actor and a haunted
house on a fen. A cozy stone shed in the countryside is a
good place for a ghost story, and while this one's dialogue
tended toward the purple, both performers (James Gibb and
Anthony Ventre) were polished and often quite scary. At
intermission, the theater served delicious chocolate cake and
coffee.</p>
<p>This summer the Mull Little Theatre also is presenting
"Bones," a one-man play about a 13th-century monk (written by
David Pitman and also starring him); "Sheila," a comedy about
a Glasgow undergraduate and her decorator; and Terrence
McNally's "Frankie and Johnny in the Claire de Lune."</p>
<p>The Mull players ran into a little trouble with "Frankie
and Johnny," when they couldn't figure out the recurring
references to cooking and eating a "Western." Fortunately a
woman from Miami called to make reservations while the cast
was puzzling over this mystery. She jotted down a phone
number, and a few minutes later, over the fax machine at the
Fairbairns recording studio in Quinish, came a recipe for a
Western omelet.</p>
