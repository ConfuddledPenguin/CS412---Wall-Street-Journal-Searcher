	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Pearson PLC, the widely diversified U.K.
publishing group, said its pretax profit for the first half
of the year rose 15%, with oil services and investment
banking activities contributing the strongest earnings
growth.
   Pretax profit rose to #97.9 million ($190.4 million) from
#85.4 million. The result matched the upper end of market
expectations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Profit after taxes and minorities totaled #65.9 million,
up 20% from #54.9 million. Per-share earnings rose 16% to
24.8 pence from 21.4 pence.</p>
<p>Net income attributable to shareholders fell by more than
half to #64.9 million after an extraordinary loss of #1
million. Net income attributable totaled #159 million a year
earlier, helped by a #104 million extraordinary gain on asset
disposals.</p>
<p>Pearson said it would pay an interim dividend of 10.75
pence a share, up 19% from nine pence for the year-earlier
period.</p>
<p>Pearson Chairman Lord Blakenham cautioned against using
the first-half earnings boost as a guide for the company's
full year.</p>
<p>Together with the traditional seasonal bias toward heavier
earnings in the second half, the chairman noted that "there
are obvious uncertainties facing the major world economies
during the remainder of 1990."</p>
<p>Overall sales totaled #711 million, up 11% from #641
million a year earlier.</p>
<p>Pearson's Information and Entertainment division, which
includes the Financial Times newspaper and its 23% interest
in Dutch publisher Elsevier, showed a 13% rise in trading
profit to #57.7 million from #51.1 million. Sales rose a
similar 12% to #478 million from #427 million.</p>
