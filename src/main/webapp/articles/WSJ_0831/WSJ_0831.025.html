	<p class="article-leader">In his 15th novel, "Lies of Silence" (Doubleday, 199
pages, $18.95), the versatile and accomplished Brian Moore
returns once again to Belfast, which he left 47 years ago, to
introduce us to Michael Dillon, manager of the city's best
hotel.
   In no time at all, Michael has engaged our sympathy and
interest: As a young man, he tried without success to become
a poet before returning to his family trade of innkeeping. At
the moment, he is deeply involved in a love affair with a
cheerful and sensible younger woman, Andrea, and on the point
of gathering up the courage to leave his cold, modishly
beautiful, shallow wife, Moira, and the narrow-minded land of
his birth, to make a new life with Andrea in London.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Just as Michael is about to break the news to Moira, who
already suspects he is having an affair and who seems no
happier with the marriage than he does, this intriguing
domestic drama is interrupted by a bulletin from the outside
world. Four gunmen break into the Dillons' home and hold them
hostage in their living room.</p>
<p>Michael, the trained hotelier, tries to keep cool.
"`Listen,' he tells his wife in a low voice, `It's not us
they want. We are being used in some way. If we do what they
tell us, we won't get hurt.'" It is at this point that
Moira's character emerges from the shadows: "`How do you know
what they want?' she demands. `They're in our house, they're
waving guns around, they're the same ones who kneecap kids
and blow up innocent people instead of the ones they're
trying to kill, and you say they won't hurt us. Well, they're
going to hurt somebody, aren't they?'"</p>
<p>Moira's outburst crystallizes the situation. She and
Michael are both Roman Catholics, born and bred in Northern
Ireland. Both loath the IRA as well as the Protestant
extremist groups that help perpetuate the legacy of hate and
fear. But Michael has always wanted to break away, while
Moira has never wanted to live anywhere else.</p>
<p>As the story develops through many unexpected twists,
Michael is forced to make a series of very hard moral choices
that may spell life or death to people he's never met. It
soon becomes clear that this is not going to be a simple
contrast between Moira's gritty defiance and Michael's
cosmopolitan rootlessness, but something more subtle and
complex.</p>
<p>The hint of slickness in the staging of events is
mitigated by the author's ability to make the characters and
their situation so chillingly believable. Mr. Moore's
portrayal of Michael's marriage, his love affair, his
relations with his employers, in sum, of his ordinary days,
is absorbing enough for the reader to feel the intrusion of
the terrorists as the gross violation of private life that it
is. Mr. Moore has managed to achieve a near perfect balance
between the personal and political, the emotional and ethical
dimensions of this timely and riveting story.</p>
<p>By contrast, Harry Crews's latest book, "Body" (Poseidon,
223 pages, $18.95), is a violent comic-strip of a novel. It
mixes clenched, muscle-bound humor with lashings of fairly
standard-style pornography, while straining toward a bang-up
conclusion that purports to say something about the perils of
the winner-take-all mentality that is so much a part of body
building -- and other kinds of competition.</p>
<p>"Body" takes us backstage at the world championship
contest for the title of "Ms. Cosmos." Shereel Dupont (nee
Dorothy Turnipseed from Waycross, Ga.) is about to face her
climactic showdown against her formidable -- and much larger
-- longtime rival, Marvella Washington of Detroit.</p>
<p>As Shereel undergoes her grueling regimen, harangued,
bullied, starved and generally abused by her single-minded
coach, Russell Morgan (a.k.a. Russell Muscle), life becomes
even tougher: Her family arrives on the scene. There's
Alphonse, the chain-smoking father who never takes off his
hat; brothers Turner and Motor (the latter so hirsute that
even his devoted mother wonders if he's entirely human); and
hefty but good-hearted sister Earline, who causes quite a
stir by giving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to a male body
builder whose muscle-popping pose she mistakes for a heart
attack. Most disturbing of all is Nail Head, Shereel's
one-time fiance, a Vietnam veteran with a knife in his belt
and a peculiar glint in his eye. Needless to say, the
Turnipseed clan has Shereel edgy, Russell climbing the walls,
and prissy assistant hotel manager Julian Lipschitz worried
about the disruption of the "Cosmos" pageant.</p>
<p>As this brief summary suggests, "Body" is a book that
derives its comic moments from caricatures of blacks, whites,
Southerners, Jews, gays and Vietnam veterans. But any satiric
edge has been blunted by a kind of syrupy affection the
author hopes we will share for his thick-witted characters,
whose simple-mindedness is meant to render their coarseness
endearing. This is a hot little property off the
fiction-writing assembly line with the usual quota of sex (or
what passes for it in these circles), humor (ditto) and
violence that culminates in a splashy, still more violent
ending. One is somehow not surprised to note that first
serial rights were sold to Playboy.</p>
