	<p class="article-leader">MINNEAPOLIS -- Electronics and appliance retailer Best Buy
Co. sued Onkyo U.S.A. Corp., alleging that the maker of audio
parts refused to supply its products to Best Buy because the
retailer wouldn't go along with what it said were Onkyo's
"price-fixing schemes."
   In the complaint, Best Buy alleges that Onkyo set prices
on its products at artificially high levels and penalized
Best Buy for refusing to go along with the prices by taking
away products that provide millions of dollars in Best Buy
sales. The suit charges Onkyo with antitrust violations and
breach of contract, among other things.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In Ramsey, N.J., an official of Onkyo U.S.A., a division
of Japan's Onkyo Corp., said: "There is no merit to those
charges, and we'll defend ourselves vigorously. Onkyo dealers
are free to set their own prices."</p>
