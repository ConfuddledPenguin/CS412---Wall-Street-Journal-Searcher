	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- As Europe's biggest oil producer, Britain
logically should gain from the jump in oil prices Saddam
Hussein set off with his charge into Kuwait.
   At least that was the conventional wisdom in the early
days of the crisis. But economies are often perverse, and a
month later, the outlook for Britain seems shakier. Indeed,
as forecasters tally up probable winners and losers, many see
the U.K. economy to be among the more badly bruised by the
oil shocks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The initial reaction that the U.K. would be a beneficiary
is a view that's outdated," said Keith Skeoch, an economist
with James Capel Ltd., a London securities firm.
Unfortunately for Britain, the impact of the crisis doesn't
begin and end with a surge in oil prices. Any big jolt to the
world energy markets spawns an array of aftershocks and
secondary effects, and it's these that cloud prospects for
Britain's economy.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is timing. Like the U.S., Britain
comes to the current oil trauma at a juncture when lots of
other things are going badly for the economy. The U.K.'s
inflation rate, the highest of the major industrial nations,
is expected to break into double digits with the next set of
indicators; interest rates are stuck at 15%; and business
insolvencies are rising ominously.</p>
<p>Turmoil arising from the Gulf showdown may be "the classic
straw that breaks the camel's back," says Leo Doyle,
economist at Kleinwort Benson Securities Ltd.</p>
<p>True, Britain's revenue from the North Sea will rise. But
petroleum, once the jewel in Britain's economy, is fading in
economic significance. Nowadays oil accounts for about 9% of
Britain's exports, compared to 22% in 1985. Costlier oil
mainly serves to increase costs for British industry, which
is already struggling with high interest rates, high
inflation and anemic domestic demand.</p>
<p>The oil-price runup also highlights what's been a chronic
Achilles heel for the British economy: high wage increases
that tend to feed inflation. This year, U.K. wage increases
have been running at about twice the European average,
according to Incomes Data Services Ltd., a London statistical
firm.</p>
<p>Higher oil prices will push up the official inflation
measures, leading to higher wage demands in the round of
negotiations many big industrial concerns will embark on this
fall. If history is any guide, management will likely go
along with them. "All this exposes the U.K.'s problems," says
Tappan Data, U.K. economist with the American Express Bank in
London. "Wage inflation has been a difficult nut to crack."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, foreign-exchange markets still tend to treat
the British pound as a petrocurrency, sending it several
rungs higher against the mark and the dollar in recent weeks.
Sterling's rise makes U.S. and German imports cheaper,
thereby offsetting some of the inflationary pressure that
comes with higher oil and petrol.</p>
<p>But with the pound pushing past three marks, British
companies will have a harder time exporting their products.
Just before the Gulf crisis and the latest surge in the
pound, the Confederation of British Industries found that
companies it surveyed were becoming more pessimistic about
winning export orders. Sluggish exports, on top of the
stagnant economy at home, threaten to shove the British
economy into full recession, the CBI warned.</p>
<p>Now, said CBI economist Andrew Sentance, "the situation
has weakened." He predicted that in coming months, the pound
will subside somewhat, settling at about $1.88. But he added:
"People competing in dollar markets prefer it to be $1.60."</p>
<p>The present turmoil in the currency markets may delay
Britain's entry into the exchange-rate mechanism of the
European Monetary System, which holds together the major
European Community currencies within set bands of
fluctuation. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, long skeptical
toward the arrangement, could see the recent volatility as
grounds to delay entry further.</p>
<p>At minimum, the oil-price rises will postpone by a month
or so the turning point at which British inflation peaks and
begins to slide downward. Getting U.K. inflation more in line
with the rest of the EC is one of the preconditions the
Thatcher government set for full EMS participation.</p>
<p>In another gloomy assessment, Capel's Mr. Skeoch figures
that after weighing all factors, the higher oil prices will
actually worsen rather than help the U.K.'s giant
current-account deficit, which rose to a record #20.3 billion
last year.</p>
<p>One school of economists interprets all the bad news as a
kind of good news: The strain and pain is necessary therapy
for the British economy, they believe. "This may be just what
the doctor ordered," said Bill Martin, chief economist with
UBS Phillips & Drew. "The more-rapid containment of the
disease may benefit productivity." He reasoned that the
higher pound and continued high interest rates will force
managers to resist lofty wage demands. And higher
unemployment will temper the demands themselves, he added.
Eventually, he said, inflation will be wrung out of the
economy.</p>
<p>What's worrying officials in the City is the prospect that
once the British economy has gone through the wringer,
recovery will be both more elusive and weaker than expected
before the Middle East crisis. "We'd hoped for a sharp
rebound in mid-to-late 1991," said Kleinwort's Mr. Doyle.
"That's going to be postponed."</p>
<p>How long the recovery is delayed is critical to the
political fortunes of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, whose
Conservative Party is trailing the Labor Party in current
polls. Mrs. Thatcher must call an election by mid-1992, and
she is banking on a decisive improvement in the economy
first.</p>
<p>Economists fear that pressures arising from the political
calendar will prompt the Thatcher government to chop interest
rates prematurely, creating the mirage of a recovery. The
real effect of such a move, however, would be to reignite
inflation and continue the stop-and-go cycles that have beset
the British economy in the past.</p>
