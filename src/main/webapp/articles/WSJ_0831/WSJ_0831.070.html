	<p class="article-leader">CBS Inc. litigation counsel Heddy Gold said CBS
commentator Andy Rooney's statements in a broadcast about a
product he sampled weren't deemed fact but were "inherently
unverifiable comments, because they reflect Mr. Rooney's
personal experience with the product." Ms. Gold was
incorrectly quoted in an item in yesterday's Legal Beat
column about the dismissal of a libel suit against Mr.
Rooney.
