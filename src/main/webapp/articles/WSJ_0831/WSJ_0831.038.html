	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Contributions from political action
committees to candidates running for federal office continued
to rise during the past 18 months, with incumbents receiving
far more than their challengers, according to a Federal
Election Commission report.
   The report said that from Jan. 1, 1989, to June 30, 1990,
PACs contributed almost $94 million to candidates running for
federal office, up 6.1% from the 1988 period and up 32% from
1986. Overall, PACs contributed more than $101 million to
federal officeholders and their challengers, but about $7
million of that was given to candidates raising money for
future campaigns or retiring past debts.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As in past reports, the election commission said that
incumbents fared better than their challengers, receiving $79
million compared with only $6.5 million.</p>
<p>Corporate PACs were the most generous, contributing $35
million to federal officeholders and their challengers. Trade
group and health-related PACs were next, giving $26 million,
followed by labor PACs, with $20 million.</p>
<p>Democrats enjoyed a greater share of PAC largess than did
their Republican counterparts, receiving $59 million compared
with $34 million.</p>
<p>The Realtors Political Action Committee led all PAC
contributions, giving more than $1.5 million. American
Telephone & Telegraph Co. led corporate PAC contributions,
giving slightly more than $1.1 million, while the Teamsters
committee led labor PACs, with contributions of more than
$1.3 million.</p>
