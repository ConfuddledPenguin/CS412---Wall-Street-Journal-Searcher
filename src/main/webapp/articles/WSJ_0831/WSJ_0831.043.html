	<p class="article-leader">Your July 12 page-one article concerning the world
standard of weight, "Le Gran K," failed to distinguish
between mass and weight. It was not clear whether Le Gran K
had lost 75-billionths of a kilogram of mass or 75-billionths
of a kilogram of weight in the past 100 years.
   The mass of an object is a measure of the amount of matter
in that object. The weight is the force due to the
gravitational attraction between the object and the Earth. If
Le Gran K is losing mass, then it is losing matter. In that
case, the cause could be the infrequent polishings, which
actually remove matter. On the other hand, if Le Gran K is
losing weight, it means that the force due to gravity is
lessening. This would make for a very grave situation,
indeed, for it would indicate either that the universal
constant of gravitation is not, in fact, a constant or that
the mass of the Earth is slowly decreasing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Neither of these alternatives is palatable, for they both
violate fundamental concepts of physics. The second
alternative, that the mass of the Earth is decreasing, could
possibly be attributed to the detonation of nuclear bombs,
each of which destroys a small amount of matter.</p>
<p>In view of the gravity of this matter I believe we must
mass our forces to lessen the burden of the weight of the
problem.</p>
