	<p class="article-leader">WARSAW -- It's been quiet in Poland this August, for a
change. In August a year ago, the Communists gave up
governing; two years ago, strikes forced them into unheard-of
compromises; 10 years ago, the movement that inspired their
downfall was born in Gdansk.
   Solidarity has spent the month celebrating its birthday,
and though the Rolling Stones called off their show, the
Harlem Globetrotters put on theirs. The festivities end
today, exactly a decade since Solidarity first was legalized.
Lech Walesa will give a speech. By the time he finishes, it
should be clearer than ever that Solidarity, age 10, is dead.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As a trade union in a country where trade unions don't
have much say, it will go on. As a social and political
movement uniting a people against Communist oppression, its
work is done.</p>
<p>Solidarity-the-movement has already split into two new
political parties, differing over the road Poland ought to
take on its way to capitalism and on how fast it ought to
travel. Fresh from a visit to the Vatican, Mr. Walesa may
choose to complete the break on this opportune day by saying
straight out to an audience of luminaries what he has been
saying in code for months: that he is a candidate for the
presidency of Poland.</p>
<p>Even if a last-minute change of strategy keeps him
pussyfooting, this country's first post-Communist political
season is sure to begin in September, with a presidential
election following before long. Mr. Walesa's former ally,
Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, has been trying to decide
whether to oppose him. Some Poles think the prime minister
might make up his mind today, too.</p>
<p>Neither Mr. Mazowiecki nor his supporters want an election
now. The Citizens' Movement for Democratic Action, led by Mr.
Walesa's former intellectual advisers, would rather let the
government go on calmly dismantling communism; in that
effort, Poland is well ahead of the other new boys of the old
bloc.</p>
<p>"It's a distraction," says Jan Litynski, a founder of the
Citizens' Movement. "Logically, it would make sense to wait
for next spring, but they've started the campaign."</p>
<p>For Mr. Walesa and his backers in a nascent party called
the Center Alliance, an election is long overdue. Despite its
democratic ideals and economic coherence, they argue,
Poland's government is still the product of a deal made
before the rest of the Soviet Empire collapsed in Eastern
Europe, and Communists still infest it.</p>
<p>"We were first in the process of democratization and now
we follow," says Adam Glapinski, an economist on the
Alliance's political council. "We don't want anything more
than people already have in Hungary and Czechoslovakia."</p>
<p>One hurdle, in the person of President Wojciech
Jaruzelski, remains to be vaulted before the Alliance can
have its wish. Gen. Jaruzelski must quit. The Alliance has
toyed with the idea of mass protests to force him out. Mr.
Walesa would then replace him, with parliament's approval,
and run for the presidency as an incumbent.</p>
<p>The general doesn't seem pleased with this plan. He'd
prefer to exit more gracefully, and has attracted some
unlikely champions: the Citizens' Movement, the Roman
Catholic Church and the U.S.</p>
<p>George Bush has invited Gen. Jaruzelski to Washington for
an official visit on Oct. 11, well after Mr. Walesa had hoped
to unseat him. And earlier this month Cardinal Jozef Glemp
received the general at Czestochowa, Poland's holiest site.
Mr. Glapinski calls that "some kind of blasphemy," and the
Alliance is still collecting signatures on anti-Jaruzelski
petitions. But it appears to have set aside for now its
threat of public disruptions.</p>
<p>Instead, it will back a constitutional amendment to choose
the president by popular, rather than parliamentary, vote.
The Citizens' Movement backs it, too, and parliament will
convene in mid-September to debate it. If the amendment
passes, Gen. Jaruzelski could resign, perhaps before year's
end, to let an election take place.</p>
<p>Mr. Mazowiecki, the opinion polls suggest, might win it.
But no one can ignore Lech Walesa's enduring power over
Polish politics or the potential impact of his call for an
"acceleration" of Poland's passage to the free market and
full democracy.</p>
<p>By "acceleration" Mr. Walesa seems to mean the removal
from public and economic life of anyone who owes his position
to the Communists -- factory foremen to school principals.
And while the Alliance has no quarrel with economic
austerity, it wants a faster sell-off of state companies run
by one-time apparatchiks.</p>
<p>"Privatization is revolution," Mr. Glapinski says. "It
means 400,000 people will lose their jobs."</p>
<p>Talk like that makes Mr. Walesa's old friends gulp. He
accuses them of blocking democracy; they accuse him of
demagoguery. "It's very dangerous," says Mr. Litynski.
"People could be deprived of property, put into prison."</p>
<p>The Citizen's Movement is trying to think positively. If
Mr. Mazowiecki wins the presidency, some hope Mr. Walesa will
agree to be his prime minister. And if Mr. Walesa wins, his
future at least won't be the main issue in parliamentary
elections that should take place in the spring.</p>
<p>Yet by August of next year -- as things look this August
-- a good part of Poland's old opposition, once united in
Solidarity, could find itself in opposition again.</p>
