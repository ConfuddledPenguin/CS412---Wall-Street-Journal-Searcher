	<p class="article-leader">L. Gordon Crovitz asserted that the U.S. government's
"executive order against assassinations is not even a law"
("What if We Had a War and No One Invited the Lawyers?" Rule
of Law, op-ed page, Aug. 8). Nothing could be further from
the truth. The rule to that effect found in President
Reagan's Executive Order 12333 of 1981 is based upon article
23(b) of the regulations annexed to Hague Convention No. IV:
"It is especially forbidden . . . to kill or wound
treacherously individuals belonging to the hostile nation or
army." Paragraph 31 of U.S. Department of the Army Field
Manual 27-10, "The Law of Land Warfare" (1956),
authoritatively defines this provision to mean: "This article
is construed as prohibiting assassination, proscription or
outlawry of an enemy. . . ."
   Beyond Executive Order 12333, Hague Convention No. IV is a
"treaty" that has received the advice and consent of the U.S.
Senate and is therefore "the supreme Law of the Land"
according to Article 6 of the U.S. Constitution. And even if
Congress were to enact a statute that expressly repealed the
rule found in Hague Regulation article 23(b) that still would
not help. This is because the Nuremberg Tribunal of 1945
expressly ruled that the rules found in the Hague Regulations
had entered into customary international law as of 1939. Even
more recently, the U.S. District Court for the District of
Columbia held in 1980 that Chile's assassination of Orlando
Letelier on the streets of Washington was "clearly contrary
to the precepts of humanity as recognized in both national
and international law."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Hence, it is the longstanding position of the U.S.
government that the assassination of anyone -- let alone a
head of state or head of government -- is a violation of the
laws and customs of warfare and therefore an international
and domestic crime. Any government officials who order
assassinations would be subject to prosecution in any state
of the world that obtained jurisdiction over them. The repeal
of Executive Order 12333 would not change this.</p>

<p>In the context of implying that the U.S. should
assassinate or abet the assassination of Saddam Hussein, Mr.
Crovitz states, "President Bush should be free to choose his
military strategy without having to worry about legalities."
If Mr. Bush is so free, so is Mr. Hussein, who has already
used chemical weapons on his own people and threatens to do
so again on Israel's people; so, in retrospect, was Hitler;
so, in the future, will be any head of state. The inhibitions
that have been reinforced by the accumulated body of
international treaties and law would be simply swept away.</p>
<p>Mr. Crovitz also declares: "It demeans the law to try to
force the circle of the rule of law into the square of an
international battlefield." Without that circle there is
nothing, in our era of nuclear and chemical weapons, to
prevent that square from becoming our vast common grave.</p>
<p>The mass murderer Saddam Hussein should be overthrown, and
if he dies in the event so be it. But as to waging war
without "worry about legalities," Mr. Crovitz should be more
careful. President Bush -- or Mr. Hussein -- might be
