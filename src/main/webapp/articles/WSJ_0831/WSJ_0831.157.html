	<p class="article-leader">PHILADELPHIA -- Usually it's the small investors who gripe
that securities industry arbitration is unfair. But now a few
financial industry titans claim they are getting a raw deal.
   In an unusual lawsuit, the New York brokerage firms of
PaineWebber Inc., Bear, Stearns & Co. and Neuberger & Berman
are accusing the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and its
executives of cronyism and prejudice in handling an
arbitration case brought against these firms by irate options
traders.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The exchange simply chose sides in favor of its hometown
boys," complains James C. Treadway Jr., a PaineWebber
executive vice president and former member of the Securities
and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>The legal wrangling erupted after a charge by the
exchange's disciplinary committee that PaineWebber, Bear
Stearns and Neuberger broke exchange rules and federal
securities laws. Specifically, the committee alleged, the
firms violated an exchange deadline for using stock options
to capitalize on late-breaking news that boosted the
underlying stock of Farmers Group Inc., a California insurer.
Other companies that lost money on the trades have lodged
arbitration claims totaling more than $1 million against the
three firms.</p>
<p>By counterattacking in court, the three brokerage houses
shattered a hallowed securities-industry code: To avoid
expensive litigation and bad publicity, member firms at
financial markets agree to arbitrate disputes internally.</p>
<p>If the suit succeeds, "It might become common to challenge
the arbitration process, which would run counter to the whole
intent of exchange arbitration," says Edward W. Morris, vice
president for arbitration at the New York Stock Exchange.
"It's supposed to be quick, fair and inexpensive." Brokers
warn that individual investors might ultimately bear the
added costs of litigation.</p>
<p>In their suit, now pending in federal court in
Philadelphia, the New York firms charged that members of the
Philadelphia exchange's arbitration committee had direct
financial interests in the Farmers Group trades. They accused
exchange officials -- including President Nicholas Giordano
and General Counsel William Uchimoto -- of prejudging the
three firms guilty and then tainting the proceedings by
conveying their views to arbitration committee members.</p>
<p>"That's just not true," Mr. Uchimoto says. "The exchange
has gone out of its way to make sure the process is fair."</p>
<p>Mr. Giordano declined to comment.</p>
<p>The feud began on a Friday in June 1988, when investors
were speculating on the outcome of a ruling by California's
insurance commissioner on whether a London conglomerate could
acquire the Farmers Group insurance company. The timing of
the ruling was critical because options on Farmers Group
stock were set to expire the following day. Under
Philadelphia Stock Exchange rules, any orders to use the
options to buy or sell stock had to be given before 5:30 p.m.
that Friday -- 90 minutes before the insurance commissioner's
ruling.</p>
<p>The commissioner ruled that the takeover violated
California law. It was clear that Farmer's stock price would
slump Monday morning. That meant a profit for PaineWebber and
some clients of Bear Stearns and Neuberger who exercised
their options to sell shares at higher pre-ruling prices. The
losers in the trades were options firms such as Susquehanna
Investment Group, O'Connor & Associates and Ocwen Trading
Inc., which had to make up the difference in prices. They
accused the three New York firms of violating the exchange
deadline and using their options late, after the commissioner
had already ruled.</p>
<p>One arbitration claim, filed by Susquehanna, O'Connor and
Ocwen, was being handled by the Philadelphia exchange's
arbitration committee when PaineWebber and allies decided
they weren't getting a fair shake and went to court. In May,
they sued the exchange, Susquehanna, O'Connor and Ocwen,
seeking a neutral arbitrator in the dispute and alleging
prejudice at the exchange.</p>
<p>PaineWebber's Mr. Treadway points to a Feb. 15 vote in
which the exchange arbitration committee denied PaineWebber's
request for an independent arbitrator. Three of the eight
committee members who voted are employed by firms whose
customers lost money in the Farmers Group trades, Mr.
Treadway says. According to exchange-prepared minutes of the
session, these three members "acknowledged small {Farmers
Group} options positions held by customers of their firms,
but stated that such would not affect their ability to render
a fair decision."</p>
<p>The three people were named to a pool of six from which
actual arbitrators of the Farmers Group claims would be
selected, the minutes show. But because of PaineWebber's
persistent complaints, the three committee members in
question recused themselves and were replaced by neutral
members of the exchange's Board of Governors. Mr. Uchimoto
says no one with a financial interest has considered the
actual merits of the case.</p>
<p>So far, the stock exchange has resisted all efforts to
take the arbitration claim outside its walls. Its lawyers
have filed a motion to dismiss PaineWebber's lawsuit.</p>
<p>Joel Greenberg, a Susquehanna managing director, contends
that PaineWebber and its allies are simply using their deep
pockets to wear down the stock exchange through litigation.
"To spend so much money and try to get it taken away from the
exchange is ludicrous," he says.</p>
<p>Neuberger and Bear Stearns won't comment except to say
that, unlike PaineWebber, they were trading in Farmers Group
stock options only for customers, not for their own accounts.</p>
<p>Marc L. Berman, general counsel for O'Connor & Associates,
won't discuss specifics of the case but says he fears there
would be a lasting impact on securities arbitration. Granting
the PaineWebber faction's request for an outside arbitrator,
he says, would forever change the way exchanges' member firms
settle their conflicts: "It would foster a situation where
any time there was an internal dispute between members there
would be unnecessary litigation."</p>
<p>Constantine Katsoris, a securities specialist at Fordham
Law School and an arbitrator, says the case "breaks new
ground. If the judge were to rule in PaineWebber's favor, it
would set a precedent in member-to-member arbitration, and I
think it would breed lawsuits."</p>
