	<p class="article-leader">The taxi was carrying me this summer from the airport into
Thessaloniki, Greece's second-largest city. All I had was an
address to start from, the address of the city's Jewish
community center. I had heard before my trip that the records
of the Jews from the nearby city of Kavala, where my father
was born, were kept there.
   In 1492 King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella expelled from
Spain all Jews who refused to convert to Catholicism, among
them leading doctors, scholars, artisans and merchants.
Non-converts who remained behind would be killed. Turkey's
pragmatic sultan was delighted, as he put it, to "enrich" his
empire, which then included Greece, by offering the exiles
refuge.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For more than four centuries, these Jews thrived in Greece
under Turkish rule. By 1910 Thessaloniki had a Jewish
population of 65,000, half the city's inhabitants, and was a
center of Sephardic (Hebrew for "Spanish") Jewish culture.
But the ravages of World War I and the fears of anti-Semitism
after Greece retook its northeast from Turkey caused many of
the region's Jews to emigrate west, among them my 12-year-old
father and his family.</p>
<p>My father relished America's freedom to climb as high as
his talent could take him, achieving success as a Broadway
restaurateur and the owner of a Kentucky-Derby-winning
racehorse. After his death four years ago, I began to sense a
disquiet within me, a murky longing to know my heritage, to
find my place in the long line of men who handed our name
along, one to the next.</p>
<p>The Jewish Center in Thessaloniki (also known as Salonika)
turned out to be a surprisingly bustling place, surprising
because the Nazis who occupied the city during World War II
deported and slaughtered nearly all the city's Jews, over
46,000. Less than 2,000 returned alive from the death camps,
and only some 1,300 reside in the city now; according to
Athens's Jewish Museum, only 6,000 Jews are left in all of
Greece. But in the rich tradition of its history,
Thessaloniki's Jewish Center runs two schools, an old-age
home, a children's summer camp, a community center and a
medical clinic. One synagogue survived the war -- because the
Red Cross was using it.</p>
<p>When I inquired about Kavala, an official at the center
sadly informed me that no Jews were left there and, as in
Thessaloniki, there were no records. The Nazis had plowed
under the cemeteries and burned all the records, intent on
obliterating not only the Jewish people, but every memory of
their existence. My paternal past had been made invisible.</p>
<p>One older man at the community center, however, remembered
that a Jewish cemetery remained in Kavala because it was
within a Christian cemetery. Perhaps there I could find my
family's graves. That would be something, I thought --
enough. I hired a taxi for the hundred-mile trip.</p>
<p>My driver, Stavros, pointed out seaside condominiums along
the way that housed residents from other countries,
particularly from Germany. He spoke no English and I no
Greek. He kept trying to communicate in German. I dredged up
the few German words I had picked up from books and movies
and fewer Yiddish ones learned as a child from my mother's
mother. ("Ja, Stavros, mein fater geborn in Kavala.") Irony
piled on painful irony.</p>
<p>Kavala turned out to be picturesque, situated on hills
that embrace beaches and a long harbor. Stavros snapped a
photo of me on the quay in front of the old Turkish quarter,
fortress -- helmet atop it, which thrusts into the sea to
guard the city. Then we drove beneath an arch of the aqueduct
built by Suleiman the Magnificent and along the coast road to
the Greek Orthodox cemetery.</p>
<p>A Jewish graveyard was indeed inside it, but enclosed by
high walls and a locked gate. Some Jews in Thessaloniki had
the key, I was told. No one had visited or tended the place
in years.</p>
<p>I had come too far to be blocked now. A worker was talked
into bringing a ladder, which I climbed. Spread below me was
an enclave about 40 yards square filled with rows of
rectangular above-ground tombs, each about three feet high.
Some had collapsed or been vandalized. To one side was a
marble cenotaph, a memorial to Kavala's Jews rounded up for
extermination in 1943. A sad serenity hung on the trees like
crepe.</p>
<p>Descending into the enclave, I moved slowly from one grave
to the next, trying to read the names carved in Hebrew or
Roman script on the marble and concrete slabs, trying to find
"Amiel" or "`Abravaya," my grandmother's family name. On some
gravestones the writing was illegible, worn away by time and
the elements. A decaying compost of leaves and pine needles
was heaped high on others, covering the names.</p>
<p>I had a sudden compulsion to cancel my plans and spend the
next few days repairing the tombs and scrubbing them clean.
Just as quickly that feeling was replaced by a vast sorrow.
No descendants or relatives of the people buried in this
place were left to view the names. Those who had not escaped
to other continents had been annihilated by the same sort of
maniacal hatred that their Spanish ancestors fled 4 1/2
centuries before.</p>
<p>I did not find my family names on any of the graves, but
that no longer seemed important. In that moment I felt as if
I were descended from every person buried there, as if I were
their single aggregate child who had by the miracle of
America survived and returned. I began to say Kaddish, the
prayer for the dead, for them all.</p>
<p>When I climbed back over the wall, burrs were clinging to
my pant legs, as if the nettles had tried to keep me from
leaving and, failing that, had forced something of the place
on me, something that would hurt when held in my hand and
would sting my memory and remind me of my responsibility: to
continue to say Kaddish for them wherever I was, to make sure
that they -- all of them my forebears now -- would be
remembered.</p>
