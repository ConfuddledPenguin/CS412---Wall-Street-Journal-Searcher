	<p class="article-leader">The effort by some members of Congress to avoid jury duty
("Jurymandering" editorial, Aug. 14) points out the blindness
of Congress as to what the American people think of them.
What rational American would accept a member of Congress on
his/her jury anyway? If the member were accepted, the
defendant's day in court would be prolonged endlessly by jury
subcommittees and the need for an environmental-impact
statement. And if by chance two members of Congress of
opposite parties were seated, the jury would be hung and the
judge would have to declare a mistrial. No matter how you
look at it, given the proven character and integrity of our
535 national legislators, justice would be delayed if not
denied, and the taxpayers would pick up the tab -- again.
