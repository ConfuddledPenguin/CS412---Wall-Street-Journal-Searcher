	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Japan's overall wholesale prices from Aug. 11-20
rose 0.1% from the previous 10-day period and were up 1% from
a year earlier, the Bank of Japan, the central bank, said.
   The wholesale price index, in which the year 1985 equals
100, stood at 90.6 at the end of the latest 10-day period.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Domestic prices rose 0.1% from the previous 10 days and
increased 0.5% from a year earlier. Central bank officials
said this was fueled by higher prices for processed food,
especially pork and eggs.</p>
<p>In July, the latest full reporting month, wholesale prices
rose 0.4% from the previous month, and increased 0.5% from a
year earlier.</p>
