	<p class="article-leader">Gannett Co. named Gary L. Watson president of its
newspaper group, the country's largest chain of newspapers,
which like most of the newspaper industry, has been battered
by widespread declines in advertising.
   Mr. Watson, 45 years old, will oversee the newly
consolidated newspaper group at the Arlington, Va.-based
media company. Effective Oct. 1, Gannett will consolidate its
Community Newspaper division and its Metro Newspaper division
into one newspaper group, bringing together Gannett's 83
small, medium, and large circulation newspapers. However, Mr.
Watson won't oversee Gannett's national daily newspaper, USA
Today.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A former editor and publisher at several Gannett
newspapers, Mr. Watson had been president of the Community
Newspaper division. As he has in the past, Mr. Watson will
report directly to John J. Curley, Gannett's chairman,
president, and chief executive. Brian J. Donnelly, 56,
current president of Metro Newspapers, will become executive
vice president of the newly consolidated newspaper group,
reporting to Mr. Watson.</p>
<p>Daily newspapers are the core of the company and they have
suffered in 1990. Gannett remains the largest U.S. newspaper
publisher, with total daily circulation of more than six
million. But in the second quarter, Gannett reported its
first quarterly earnings drop in 22 years. The loss was
attributable largely to a drop in retail advertising in
virtually all of its local newspaper markets. Through the
first half of this year, newspaper advertising revenue
declined 2.9%, with falloffs in national, retail, and
classified advertising.</p>
<p>Mr. Watson said in an interview he would concentrate on
improving news coverage at Gannett papers by increasing
newsroom budgets. "We've increased budgets over the years and
will continue to," said Mr. Watson. "In the end, that will
help us build circulation penetration."</p>
<p>He also said Gannett will increase its number of zoned
editions for specific geographical areas, and will expand its
experimental publishing of yellow pages directories.</p>
<p>Gannett executives denied published reports that Mr.
Watson's appointment was an indication he was being groomed
to succeed Mr. Curley. Mimi Feller, Gannett's vice president
for public affairs, said Mr. Watson will not be Mr. Curley's
"second-in-command," and that no changes will be made among
the top corporate officers.</p>
<p>The new newspaper group is a dismantling of changes made
under former chairman Allen H. Neuharth. In 1985, as Gannett
was acquiring series of large-circulation metropolitan
newspapers, Mr. Neuharth created two newspaper divisions. "At
the time, new acquisitions {in Des Moines, Iowa and
Louisville, Ky.} required special attention and two divisions
made sense," Mr. Watson said. "Now its a natural evolution to
go back to one division."</p>
