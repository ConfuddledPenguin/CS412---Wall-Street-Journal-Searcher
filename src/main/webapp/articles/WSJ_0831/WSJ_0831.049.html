	<p class="article-leader">Irving Kristol is correct ("It's Obscene but Is It Art?"
editorial page, Aug. 7) that the debate about "censorship"
has been used as a smoke screen to avoid discussion of what
art should receive the national endorsement that National
Endowment for the Arts funding provides.
   The NEA and most private entities funding art are
dominated by modernist art "professionals." This view of art
is founded on the notion that there is no reality exterior to
the self; whatever is called art by an artist is art. In its
denial that judgment is even possible, this view fosters
precisely the iconoclasm we are seeing. In arts-establishment
parlance, "only the initiated can understand" -- the
initiated being those who deny that art has intentional
meaning and can be assessed independently of the artist. This
is today's "arts community."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>One practical consequence of the embrace of this set of
delusions is that the NEA routinely denies applications from
such entities as the New York Academy of Art, the nation's
only graduate school dedicated to the teaching of the
classical figurative disciplines and techniques that informed
fine-arts tradition during the 25 centuries prior to our own.
According to the NEA summary of its panelists' comments on
the school's 1989 application to its grant program, the
"Panel disagreed with basic philosophical impetus of the
application for being too rigidly modeled on European
academicism with no acknowledgment of 20th-century concepts
of Modernism. It was feared that this revisionist approach
would stifle creativity in young artists."</p>
<p>Unless conservatives and liberals alike start addressing
the validity of the modernist/deconstructionist assumptions,
we shall continue the current progression toward complete
obliteration of expression grounded in the Western
Judeo-Christian tradition.</p>

<p>The controversies on tax-supported pornography at the NEA
have obscured a much more alarming development. Projected
budgets for fiscal 1992 indicate that, for the first time, a
larger proportion of the agency's budget will support the
infrastructure of the arts than the artists themselves.
Somewhat under 50% -- approximately 47% in one projection --
of the agency's budget will go to the artists, more than half
of the budget -- about 53% in the same projection -- will pay
for support activities. The NEA is spending more on ancillary
activities, e.g., organizations that service the arts, paying
for mayors to meet and talk about the arts, and less on the
artists themselves. The main issue is just how much direct
and immediate good the NEA does for the working artists,
obscene or otherwise.</p>
