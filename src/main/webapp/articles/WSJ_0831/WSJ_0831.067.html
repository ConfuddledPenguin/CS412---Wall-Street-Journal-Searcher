	<p class="article-leader">It's not quite the world against Saddam Hussein. Along
with Libya and Yemen, Saddam can look to the Palestine
Liberation Organization as a faithful cheerleader and to its
experienced terrorists as potent weapons in his arsenal. This
sends a clear message to Americans who hoped the PLO had
changed its stripes and to leaders of the Arab Gulf states
who had convinced themselves that hush money would protect
them. The PLO has shown that its cardinal rule remains:
Always side with the most radical force in the Arab world.
The corollary is that the PLO surely is not to be trusted
with responsibility for its own state.
   Yasser Arafat seemed to have a lot to lose when he sent a
telegram congratulating Saddam for his glorious conquest of
Kuwait. For one thing, it's estimated that Saudi Arabia alone
has funneled some $3 billion in aid to the PLO since the late
1970s, funds that represent literal blood money. Faced with
the choice of siding with his financial backers, standing pat
or throwing in with Saddam, Mr. Arafat chose the man he calls
"The First and Foremost" among the Arabs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Typically for the Middle East, the country that has kept
its borders the widest open to accept Palestinians fleeing
Kuwait and Iraq was not Jordan, Syria or Lebanon, but Israel.
This after the "Arab world" maintained the Palestinians all
these years as a grievance against Israel, while Israel has
long since incorporated Jewish refugees from all the Arab
lands. Saddam has at least shown the world what everyone in
the Middle East has understood all along, that no Arab
country wants the Palestinians, who are cynically used as a
whipping boy against Israel.</p>
<p>The PLO, of course, has maintained itself by assassinating
any and all moderate Palestinians on the West Bank. Beginning
in the spring, Mr. Arafat decided to command these assaults
from a new headquarters -- Baghdad. Iraq, he decided, made a
better patron than Egypt. The regular meetings of his top
aides have been held in Baghdad for several months. It
strains credulity to believe that Mr. Arafat was surprised by
Saddam's invasion.</p>
<p>Whatever promises Saddam may have made to the PLO, he has
gotten loyalty in return. After the U.S. troops began to
arrive, Abu Abbas, a member of the 15-man PLO executive
committee headed by Mr. Arafat, issued marching orders to his
terrorists: "Open fire on the American enemy everywhere.
Quake the earth under the feet of the invaders and the
collaborators." Abu Abbas, who committed the Achille Lauro
outrage, was last heard from in May when he took
responsibility for the failed attack on an Israeli beach that
led the U.S. to cut off talks with the PLO.</p>
<p>It's estimated that Saddam has gathered some 1,400
terrorists now cooling their heels in Baghdad awaiting final
orders. Many of these are PLO-related. Indeed, all six of the
PLO guerrilla groups have now pledged "every means available"
to remove U.S. forces from Saudi Arabia. In addition to Abu
Abbas's Palestine Liberation Front, the score card of threats
to the U.S. troops stationed in the region includes Al Fatah,
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Marxist
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Arab
Liberation Front and the Palestine Communist Party.</p>
<p>As we noted yesterday, there are Arabs and then there are
Arabs. The Egyptians were already tiring of the PLO,
beginning with the group's attack on Israeli tourists in
Egypt this past February. An article this week in the Cairo
newspaper Al Ahram was typical of this new thinking. It noted
that Mr. Arafat had continued his terrorism despite many
promises that he would not. "He wants to be the dove of peace
in public, and the most hawkish of hawks in secret," the
article said. "This is a source of embarrassment to all those
who have been helping him among the Arabs."</p>
<p>The Arab countries now united against Saddam have already
experienced scales falling from their eyes on Iraq's
benevolent intentions. When Saddam is eventually neutralized
one way or another, Mr. Arafat and his henchmen should find
themselves isolated for a good long time, the typical fate
throughout history for those who pick the losing side.</p>
<p>It is ironic that it is other Arabs who are the first to
say that the character of the PLO has been exposed by its
alliance with Saddam. There surely is no longer any excuse
for wishful thinking. If the U.S. political culture doesn't
understand the PLO now, we guess it never will.</p>
