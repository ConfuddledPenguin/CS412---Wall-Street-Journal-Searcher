	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Walt Disney Co. filed suit against a former
top movie executive, charging that when he left Disney for
Paramount Pictures last month, he took another executive and
a film project with him, in violation of a contract.
   The executive, David Kirkpatrick, was president of
production at Walt Disney Pictures and Touchstone Pictures
for 16 months before quitting to become executive vice
president of Paramount's motion picture group, a unit of
Paramount Communications Inc.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Kirkpatrick declined to comment, but his attorney,
Howard Weitzman, called the lawsuit "a complete
overreaction," and said of Disney, "Mouses that live in glass
houses shouldn't call other persons louses." This is a
reference to the fact that Disney Chairman Michael Eisner,
along with movie chiefs Jeffrey Katzenberg and Richard Frank
and several other key executives, all used to work at
Paramount. Disney wouldn't comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Kirkpatrick himself had served at Paramount with
members of the Disney team for eight years. After a two-year
stint at closely held Weintraub Entertainment Group, he
joined Disney, where he was the No. 2 movie executive at
Touchstone and Disney, working with David Hoberman and
reporting to Messrs. Katzenberg and Frank.</p>
<p>The suit alleges that when Mr. Kirkpatrick asked to be
released from his five-year employment contract, he signed an
agreement prohibiting him from hiring away any Disney
employees for two years or disclosing any confidential
information about the company. However, the suit says, he
offered a job to Disney film executive Donald Granger, a
former Weintraub employee, and Mr. Granger recently joined
Paramount as a vice president of production. The suit also
says Mr. Kirkpatrick interfered with a negotiation over a
prospective film by producers Ed Kaplan and Steve Tisch, "The
Dead Letter Department."</p>
<p>Although Mr. Hoberman described Mr. Kirkpatrick's
departure from Disney as "amicable" at the time, the lawsuit
says that Mr. Katzenberg "remonstrated" with Mr. Kirkpatrick
after he left about alleged contract violations but that Mr.
Kirkpatrick was "unsympathetic, suggesting that he could
exploit loopholes in Disney's contractual schemes of
protection."</p>
<p>Mr. Weitzman said, "I don't know what Disney's agenda is;
the only thing I can think of is that there's a lot of
hostility between them and David."</p>
<p>The complaint, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court,
alleges fraud and breach of contract. It seeks an injunction
against further alleged contract violations and unspecified
damages.</p>
