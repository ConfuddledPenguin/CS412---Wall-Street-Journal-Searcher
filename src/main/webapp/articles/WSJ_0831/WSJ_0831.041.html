	<p class="article-leader">CALGARY, Alberta -- Ranger Oil Ltd. expects to spend about
400 million Canadian dollars (US$350.7 million) to help bring
half a dozen North Sea oil and gas properties into production
by 1997, Fred Dyment, vice president, finance, said.
   With C$150 million of cash on hand and little debt on its
books, Mr. Dyment said Ranger is well positioned to finance
its ambitious development plans without any backing from
Westcoast Energy Inc., which became Ranger's largest holder
by acquiring a 12.1% stake last December.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"If you look at all our projects on a stand-alone basis,
we'd only need net C$200 million or so to develop them,"
which is well within Ranger's debt comfort range, Mr. Dyment
said in an interview. "We see {Westcoast} as equity
shareholders, and not necessarily providing a backstop on
financings," he said.</p>
<p>Westcoast, which is intent on expanding its oil and gas
production business and was attracted by Ranger's growth
potential in the North Sea, is bound by a standstill accord
that limits its interest in Ranger to 15% until 1992, unless
a third party offers to acquire Ranger.</p>
<p>Mr. Dyment didn't offer a specific production forecast for
Ranger, though he said he sees "substantial growth" by 1993,
when the company hopes to have four additional North Sea
properties in production. They include Ranger's 40%-owned
Columba oil field, whose development mainly depends on
whether Ranger and the U.K. government can resolve their
differences on fiscal terms.</p>
<p>Rik Parkhill, an analyst with Deacon Barclays de Zoete
Wedd Ltd. in Toronto, said he estimates Ranger's oil output
will rise to more than 24,000 barrels a day by 1993 from an
average of 17,854 during the 1990 first half, and daily
natural gas production will climb to about 79 million cubic
feet by 1993 from a first-half average of 43.5 million.
"That's pretty close," said Mr. Dyment, "assuming Columba is
on stream."</p>
<p>Mr. Dyment said he expected production in 1991 will be
relatively unchanged from 1990 levels, as output at the North
Sea's mature Ninian oil field is flat, and the first of
Ranger's development properties aren't scheduled to come on
stream until next year's fourth quarter. They include
Ranger's 35.6%-owned Anglia natural gas field, and the
40%-owned Staffa oil field.</p>
<p>Initial production at Anglia is expected to be 50 million
cubic feet a day, of which 17.5 mcf will accrue to Ranger,
the field's operator. Production at Staffa, adjacent to
Ranger's biggest producer, Ninian, is expected to reach 8,000
barrels daily, of which 3,200 barrels daily is Ranger's
share.</p>
<p>Anglia will supply feedstock to a planned gas-fired
electrical power generating plant at South Denes, Great
Yarmouth, in the U.K. Ranger will own 28.3% of the plant and
operate it when it starts production, scheduled for 1994.</p>
<p>Mr. Dyment said the next boost in production will occur by
late 1992, when the Markham natural gas field and possibly
the Columba field, come on stream.</p>
