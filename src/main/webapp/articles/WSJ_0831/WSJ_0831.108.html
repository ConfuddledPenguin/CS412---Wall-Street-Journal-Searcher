	<p class="article-leader">Shareholders of Intermark Inc. and its 51.6%-owned Triton
Group Ltd. approved their merger by a wide margin at separate
annual meetings yesterday.
   Intermark, based in La Jolla, Calif., said 91% of
Intermark shares represented in the voting were cast in favor
of the merger valued at about $76.2 million. The merger also
received 91% of votes cast by Triton's non-Intermark holders.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As a result of the combination, effective today, Triton
holders are to receive 1.4 shares of Intermark common stock
for each share of Triton common. Intermark, a San Diego-based
holding company, is the surviving entity. It will have
interests in 12 operating companies in retailing,
restaurants, real estate and other industries.</p>
<p>Intermark's stock closed at $5 a share, down 50 cents a
share, in American Stock Exchange composite trading
yesterday. Triton's stock, in its last day of trading on the
New York Stock Exchange, closed at $6.625, down 37.5 cents a
share.</p>
<p>About 225 shareholders attended one or both annual
meetings, which were relatively quiet. A small group of union
employees that had previously sought to halt the merger
didn't disrupt the sessions.</p>
<p>The group of United Food & Commercials Workers withdrew
its motion for a preliminary injunction in Delaware Chancery
Court earlier this week without giving a reason.</p>
