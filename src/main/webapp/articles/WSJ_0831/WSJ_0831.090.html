	<p class="article-leader">Occupational diseases kill more than 70,000 U.S. workers
yearly, says a workplace safety group that calls the issue
the nation's "most neglected public health problem."
   The National Safe Workplace Institute, an advocacy group
with headquarters in Chicago, based its estimate on an
analysis of 1987 data. The institute's report is among the
few efforts made to determine the prevalence of
workplace-related illnesses nationwide.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The report claims that occupational disease is a
substantial problem that isn't sufficiently recognized," says
Howard Frumkin, director of environmental and occupational
health at Emory University, Atlanta, and an adviser to the
institute.</p>
<p>The report also says the nation's regulatory apparatus for
occupational health is in disarray. Standards for exposure to
many dangerous materials are much more lax for the workplace
than for the community at large, the report notes. It also
says funding for the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health
Administration and the National Institute for Occupational
Safety and Health, as a percentage of the federal budget,
fell sharply through the 1980s.</p>
<p>Diane Porter, assistant director of NIOSH, said the study
"covers an important area that we need to look at." She also
noted that while the National Centers for Disease Control
tracks such infectious diseases as AIDS and measles on a
weekly basis, no national reporting system tracks
occupational disease. A spokesman for OSHA said agency
officials hadn't yet evaluated the study.</p>
<p>The institute said it based its fatality report on data
from the National Center for Health Statistics and on
established methods to estimate the proportion of deaths from
major diseases that could be attributed to workplace
exposures. For instance, it estimated that 5% to 10% of the
nation's 483,000 cancer deaths in 1987 were related to
previous occupational exposures to dangerous substances,
while 1% to 3% of 964,000 cardiovascular disease deaths and
2% to 4% of 164,000 pulmonary disease fatalities were caused
by such exposures. The estimate of total occupational disease
deaths ranged from 47,377 to 95,479.</p>
<p>Such numbers are inherently imprecise, the institute
acknowledged, because the onset of many occupational diseases
occurs many years after the initial exposure and doctors
often can't distinguish between illnesses that begin in the
workplace and those that develop from other causes.</p>
<p>The institute said a broad effort by industry, medicine,
labor and government is necessary to develop more information
about the problem as well as effective programs to address
it.</p>
