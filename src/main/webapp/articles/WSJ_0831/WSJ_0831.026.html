	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Texans in the Bush administration have
prevailed in a behind-the-scenes struggle to give Mexico a
prominent place on the nation's agenda.
   President Bush's announcement this month that he would
soon notify Congress of plans to negotiate a U.S.-Mexico
trade pact came as a surprise to many in Washington. They
thought the Mexican free-trade negotiations wouldn't begin
until late next year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It also marked a defeat for White House Trade
Representative Carla Hills, who will have to negotiate the
trade pact. Mrs. Hills, along with Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter, had argued that early negotiations with
Mexico could interfere with efforts next year to win
congressional support for a new global trade agreement under
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</p>
<p>But in making his decision, Mr. Bush, who counts Texas as
his adopted home, was influenced by two other highly placed
Texans in the administration: Secretary of State James Baker
and Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher. Both Mr. Baker and
Mr. Mosbacher argued vigorously that a free-trade pact with
Mexico should be a top priority for the administration.</p>
<p>The Texans' success in persuading the president suggests
that Mexico may get better treatment in the Bush
administration than it has in the past.</p>
<p>"It's very obvious in Texas, and I hope that it will
become as obvious to the rest of the country, that every time
you start a new business in Mexico it creates new jobs in the
U.S.," said Mr. Mosbacher. "There's a natural supplier
situation that you don't get if you go overseas. The
machinery and plant are likely to come from the U.S."</p>
<p>Mr. Baker and Mr. Mosbacher also got an assist from
another Texan, Democratic Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, who helped
persuade other key members of Congress to support the talks.
In order to proceed with the negotiations, the administration
wants Congress to authorize a "fast-track" procedure for
approving the Mexican agreement.</p>
<p>Ambassador Hills and Secretary Yeutter have argued that
the administration should concentrate on the current round of
GATT trade talks, leaving the negotiating of a U.S.-Mexico
pact to well into next year, after the GATT talks are all
squared away.</p>
<p>The so-called Uruguay round of GATT talks, set to end this
December, is the most ambitious round of trade talks to date.
Begun in the Uruguayan seaside resort of Punta del Este four
years ago, the talks aim to extend the world's trade treaty
to agriculture, textiles, intellectual property, services and
investment. Even after the completion of the GATT talks in
December, it will be several more months before the necessary
enabling legislation is passed by Congress.</p>
<p>Also opposed to an early start for the Mexican talks was
Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole. Secretary Dole expressed the
reservations of organized labor to a U.S.-Mexico pact. The
AFL-CIO and other labor groups fear that a trade pact will
harm the interests and wage rates of their members. In its
latest policy statement on the proposed pact, the AFL-CIO's
executive council said "tens of thousands of Americans have
lost their jobs as U.S. companies move to take advantage of
the poverty of Mexican workers in the absence of any
effective regulations on company operations." It maintains
that at least 400,000 Mexicans now work for wages of less
than $1 an hour.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, House Ways and Means Chairman Dan
Rostenkowski also argued against launching U.S.-Mexican
negotiations aimed at a trade pact. But a Congressional aide
says Mr. Rostenkowski "isn't prepared to fall on his sword
over the issue" of the U.S.-Mexico trade pact, although he
adds that the Illinois Democrat still is committed to the
Uruguay round as the top trade priority.</p>
<p>The Texans make no apologies for their championing of a
U.S.-Mexico free-trade pact. "There's no country in my view
that is more important" to the U.S. than Mexico, says Mr.
Mosbacher. "It's already our third biggest trading partner,
and is our biggest contiguous neighbor." The rate of growth
of population points to 100 million Mexicans by the end of
the century, a huge potential market for U.S. companies, the
commerce secretary says.</p>
<p>Mr. Mosbacher says the administration will shortly launch
a campaign to show the advantages of a U.S.-Mexico trade
pact. If U.S. companies are "going to move plants to
somewhere where there's cheaper labor, it's a hell of a lot
better if it moves next door where we have the supply
advantages," Mr. Mosbacher argues.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, Mr. Mosbacher and Mexican Commerce
Secretary Jaime Serra will make a tour of Los Angeles,
Chicago, Houston and New York to drum up U.S. investment and
business interest in Mexico.</p>
