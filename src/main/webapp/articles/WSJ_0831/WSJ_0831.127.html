	<p class="article-leader">Publisher John Wiley & Sons Inc. reported net income for
the first quarter ended July 31 grew 17%, helped particularly
by the scientific, technical and medical publishing sector.
   Fiscal first-quarter net climbed to $2.1 million, or 48
cents a share, from $1.8 million, or 41 cents a share, in the
year-earlier period. Revenue rose 2.7% to $75.4 million from
$73.4 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Revenue and profit at Wiley's professional and trade
publishing businesses also improved, the company said, but
results declined in educational publishing, which a spokesman
called a cyclical and very competitive business.</p>
<p>"We're putting some money and focus" into the educational
business, the spokesman said. Wiley doesn't see immediate
gains, but it expects the unit to turn up, perhaps over the
next couple of years, he added.</p>
<p>During the second quarter of fiscal 1990, Wiley, based in
New York, sold its occupational and nursing publishing lines.
The company narrowed the loss at its training division.</p>
<p>In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Wiley's
shares closed unchanged at $35.</p>
