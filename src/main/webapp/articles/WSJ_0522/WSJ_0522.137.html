	<p class="article-leader">French food group BSN S.A. announced that it has put its
U.S. cookie units up for sale as part of its strategy of
focusing on high-growth markets in eastern Europe and Asia.
   The company said its Mother's and Salerno subsidiaries,
with combined annual revenue of about $200 million, claim
only 5.7% of the U.S. cookie market, and further expansion in
the largely saturated sector would have been too costly.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>BSN said "new perspectives are opening in the countries of
Eastern Europe and in regions of strong demographic growth
such as India and Asia . . . In order to take advantage of
this rapid expansion, BSN has decided to sell its U.S.
business."</p>
<p>The French food group retains U.S. units in other product
categories, including yogurt maker Dannon Co. and Lea &
Perrins, a producer of condiments.</p>
