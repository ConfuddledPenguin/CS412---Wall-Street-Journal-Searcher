	<h3>Heard on the Street: Brazil Fund, With Its Zigzag Performance, Is Just as Much a Bet on Politics as on a Market</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">Do the lambada? Why bother when you can wind up equally
breathless by owning a few shares of Brazil Fund.
   Wild zigzags come with the territory for investors in this
two-year-old stock fund, which trades on the New York Stock
Exchange and invests in Brazilian companies. It offers a
reminder that investors ignore at their peril: Owning a
country fund is just as much a bet on politics as it is on
any particular stock market.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In mid-March, Brazil froze bank accounts as part of an
all-out attack on inflation, officially estimated at 1,765%
last year. Lo and behold, inflation fell. The government puts
it at 3% for the 30 days through April 15, though some
analysts thought it was above 40%. Meanwhile Brazil Fund
shares are at 10 1/8, up from a low of 8 1/2 earlier this
year.</p>
<p>Some investors "must believe the government's plan is
going to work," says Michael Porter, who follows publicly
traded investment funds for Smith Barney in New York. He
notes that the shares in Brazil Fund's portfolio now trade at
a modest four times last year's corporate earnings, and only
about half book value.</p>
<p>Lest all this sound like an unbelievable bargain, Ed
Games, the fund's manager at Scudder, Stevens & Clark in
Boston, points out that because of the stern economic
measures, it's highly unlikely that there will be any
earnings this year for the companies in the fund's portfolio.
Hence he isn't optimistic about any further dividend payouts
by Brazil Fund this year. The fund, sold to investors in
March 1988 for $12.50 a share, has paid a total of $3.99 a
share in dividends, including $3.07 Jan. 23 and 12 cents
March 30.</p>
<p>For small investors, it's perplexing enough that the
shares of a publicly traded fund rarely match the portfolio
value -- generally known as the net asset value. And until
recently, Brazil Fund added to this quandary by sporting its
two different net asset values. One figure showed the effect
of a new one-time 8% wealth tax. But the tax was found
inapplicable to Brazil Fund, which now quotes a single net
asset value of $9.75 a share.</p>
<p>At yesterday's close the shares were at a 3.8% premium to
the portfolio value. Sound tempting? Mr. Games notes that
during 1989 the fund shares typically sold at discounts of
30% to 55%. At year end, for example, Brazil Fund's net asset
value was $18.85 and the shares were 32% lower, at 12 7/8.</p>
<p>Brazil Fund is a reasonable bet now because "a buyer of
the fund is getting a portfolio of undervalued assets," Mr.
Porter says. Last month the entire Brazilian market was
capitalized at about $17 billion; "Does that make sense when
IBM is capitalized at about $31 billion?" Mr. Porter asks.
Mr. Porter adds that a couple of years ago Mexico Fund was at
4 and now it is at 14 1/4. "Mexico took some of the same
steps that Brazil is trying today -- privatization, reducing
the public sector and controlling inflation," he says. But he
warns that Brazil's stock market is still "vulnerable to
further weakness."</p>
<p>In 1989, Mr. Games says, Brazil Fund benefited from
spectacular earnings growth for the stocks in its portfolio.
The fund's net asset value rose 46% for the year -- to $18.85
share after subtracting the January 1990 distribution --
mostly from gains on investments. Mr. Games, who returned
from Brazil last week, says he saw signs that business is
picking up. Some companies will survive the transition better
than others, he says, but "on balance, there seems to be a
lot of confidence in the economy."</p>

<p>Business: Brazilian stock fund</p>
<p>Year ended Dec. 29, 1989:</p>

<p>Fibreboard said its board rescinded an amendment to the
company's employee stock option plan that would have doubled
the plan's size.</p>
<p>As previously reported, some shareholders were highly
critical of the amendment, which would have raised the number
of shares reserved for issuance to 700,000, or 18% of the
total now outstanding. But the amendment was narrowly
approved at Fibreboard's annual meeting by a vote of
1,080,791 to 1,035,540, with 213,454 shares abstaining.</p>
<p>Lawrence C. Hart, chairman of the Concord, Calif., wood
products and insulation company, said "the board and
management don't want to expand the option program without
broader support from shareholders." Fibreboard said it would
"continue to evaluate the use of stock options and other
incentives." Donald Miller, a dissident shareholder, said the
decision was "appropriate" given that more than half the
shares voted no or abstained.</p>
