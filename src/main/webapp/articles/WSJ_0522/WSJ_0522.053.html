	<p class="article-leader">At 75, Earl Wild, the perpetually youthful doyen of
American virtuoso pianists, remains a formidable improviser
in the tradition of the great keyboard showmen of the 18th
and 19th centuries, able to take a given theme and fly with
it.
   Yet though Mr. Wild is most often identified as a
preeminent interpreter of Franz Liszt, he also is a leading
exponent of George Gershwin's music. In fact, he was one of
the earliest pianists to champion Gershwin in regular concert
circles: Apart from including the Piano Concerto in F in his
active repertoire (where it remains today), he played the
solo in Toscanini's first NBC Symphony "Rhapsody in Blue" in
1942.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Listening to his latest recording, "Earl Wild Plays His
Transcriptions of Gershwin" (Chesky Records), one cannot but
acknowledge it inevitable that Mr. Wild finally should
combine his passions for Liszt, Gershwin and improvisation.</p>
<p>Included are an extended "Fantasy on `Porgy and Bess' "
(written in 1976), "Seven Virtuoso Etudes on Gershwin Songs"
(which he wrote in the 1950s) and the brand new
"Improvisation in the Form of a Theme and Three Variations on
`Someone to Watch Over Me,'" which he performs for the first
time on this album. You think Lisztian Gershwin an
impossibility? You ain't heard nothin' yet.</p>
<p>Call them serious fun, call them sorcery, these pieces are
not merely astonishing for their cleverness, and for the
technical challenges they present -- they are amusing.
Indeed, according to Mr. Wild, amusement is precisely what he
intended. "I was thinking recently that so much music written
today is dead serious -- and deadly," he observes by
telephone from his home in Worthington, Ohio. "These
transcriptions are supposed to make you smile, but not at the
expense of the music."</p>
<p>Certainly Mr. Wild's transcriptions amuse because of the
startling and ultimately successful juxtaposition of idioms
that appear incompatible at first: On one hand you have the
informal, slinky curvature of Gershwin's melodies, redolent
of Broadway, of Art Deco penthouses and smoke-filled
nightclubs. On the other you have the dazzling, romantic
vocabulary of the 19th-century European virtuoso, with
cascades of crimson passage work, elaborate counterpoint and
even symphonic textures. Above all, these transcriptions
resound with a full-bodied piano timbre leagues away from the
Tin-Pan Alley simplicity of Gershwin's own "Song Book"
arrangements.</p>
<p>Although the art of transcription only recently has begun
to regain its former reputation as a viable form of musical
expression -- due in great measure to Mr. Wild's performances
-- in their day, virtuoso fantasies, potpourris and concert
paraphrases by Liszt and other pianists flooded the
marketplace.</p>
<p>Flashy but sometimes highly ingenious, opera
transcriptions were the gaslit equivalent of crossover, based
on melodies that even people who had never been inside an
opera house knew from barrel organs, piano albums, music
boxes and street bands. Of course Liszt wasn't the only
virtuoso who made them, but comparison of, say, his
"Rigoletto" and "Norma" fantasies with rival works by
Sigismund Thalberg, Henri Herz and Michael Glinka shows how
brilliantly Liszt not only decorated the chosen themes with
all manner of titivating embellishment, but used the original
thematic material for further development that the composers
themselves might well have been hard pressed to conceive of
on their own. Likewise Mr. Wild, in seeking to entertain, has
striven to be worthy of the original material. "Gershwin's
melodies are perfect," he says. "They lend themselves to this
kind of elaboration because of their enormous popularity:
Everyone knows the tunes, so you can recognize them while
enjoying the decorations."</p>
<p>However, the difference between his sophisticated wit and
conventional high jinks of the P.D.Q. Bach kind lies in their
relative craftsmanship. Where the latter are merely jokes
that have limited musical appeal once the humor wears off,
Mr. Wild's transcriptions, like Liszt's, enhance the original
themes without debasing them, and stand on their own as music
because of their creativity.</p>
<p>Although some might regard them as original compositions,
Mr. Wild feels it pretentious to do so, except in the case of
his "Variations on `Someone to Watch Over Me,'" which
contains sufficient original material to warrant the dignity.</p>
<p>He recalls that the idea for this piece presented itself
at the end of a day spent teaching the Bach Partita in
C-minor and the C-minor Fugue from the Well-Tempered Clavier,
book one. "You get rather groggy after the whole day teaching
the same two pieces, and when I got home I sat down and
started to play both of the main tango rhythms -- just to
relax. While I was doing that, `Someone to Watch Over Me'
popped into my mind. I played it in counterpoint on top of
them -- and it worked. Then I thought I had better add some
variations to this set of ideas. So I devised the barcarolle,
imagining myself in a gondola floating past an Italian
singing school."</p>
<p>The result -- a tune detective's delight -- pits
Gershwin's melody against phrases of "O sole mio" and "The
Carnival of Venice," as well as snatches of "Pagliacci,"
"Tosca" and "Gianni Schicchi."</p>
<p>To be sure, Mr. Wild does occasionally go out on an
interpretive limb.</p>
<p>His version of "Lady Be Good" slows down the up-tempo
tune, endowing it with a rich blue melancholy. "I was
picturing this plump Georgia peach walking down the main
street of a southern town, swaying sexily in the sultry
breeze."</p>
<p>Imbued with the transcriber's urge by his own teacher,
Egon Petri, Mr. Wild has been making fanciful piano
arrangements for years, turning his re-creative hand to
everything from Buxtehude chorale preludes to Shaker hymns,
and limited only by the demands of his concert career. "If I
didn't have to practice so much," he admits, "I'd be writing
music by the ream." At the moment he's considering a Stephen
Foster project. "Foster's own song accompaniments are
dreadful, but the melodies offer wonderful possibilities for
elaboration, especially `Camptown Races.' You know, if that
had been a Russian tune, Tchaikovsky would have snapped it
up."</p>
