	<p class="article-leader">I was so dismayed at the results of your public surveys on
Lithuania (page one, April 19). The U.S. public seems to
think that supporting Mikhail Gorbachev is more important
than the rights of the Lithuanian people to
self-determination and that U.S. support of Lithuania would
be some kind of interference in Soviet domestic affairs.
   This confusion can be cleared up by an understanding of
Russian history. Conservatives sometimes call the U.S.S.R.
the Soviet empire because the Soviet Union is indeed a
colonial empire, the same as Czarist Russia in all but name,
and the last surviving such empire in the world. Just like
the British and the French empires, it acquired much of its
territory by military conquest during the 100 years from the
late 18th century to the late 19th.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>During the era of decolonization in the 1950s and 1960s
there was a general public consensus that empires had to be
dissolved because most colonies had the right to
independence. But partly because that movement was originally
leftist inspired, everyone forgot about the Soviet empire.</p>
<p>It is time to recognize the necessity of decolonization.
Not because we want to "cause trouble for Gorbachev," but
because there is a moral obligation for the West, including
the U.S., to support freedom and independence for the captive
nationalities of the "Prison of nations."</p>

<p>Congratulations on the thorough and objective reporting of
the situation and activities in Lithuania. Your excellent
report was perhaps lacking only in some historic perspective
to help alleviate the "tradition of xenophobia" of the
American people by revisiting the events of the holocaust in
Ukraine in the mid-1920s, when some 10 million Ukrainian
peasants were starved to death by our onetime ally, Josef
Stalin, because of their resistance to agricultural
collectivization. This was accomplished by cutting off
supplies to the region and by a blockade not too dissimilar
to what is now being implemented by our "entrusted" future
business partner Mikhail Gorbachev. Several of the Ukraine
blockade masterminds and Stalin's henchmen, including Lazar
Kaganovich, still reside in Moscow on relatively comfortable
pensions.</p>

<p>I fear that the current Lithuanian course of action could
derail the reforms taking place and could give Soviet
hardliners the chance to retake power. Lithuania, unlike the
Warsaw Pact countries, is actually a part of the Soviet
Union; our administration disavows so because of the way it
came about.</p>
<p>Lithuania was an independent, sovereign, self-governing
country until it was invaded and conquered by the Soviet
Union in 1940, and subsequently annexed. Today it forms a
substantial part of the Soviet Union's western frontier, and
is probably indispensable to the Soviets' national-security
strategy, at least for a while. The difference and extreme
delicacy of this situation might be better seen with a
convenient analogy.</p>
<p>Hawaii was an independent, sovereign, self-governing
country until it was invaded and conquered by the U.S. in
1893, and subsequently annexed. Today it forms a substantial
part of our western frontier and is indispensable to our
national security. If native Hawaiians organized a Congress,
proclaimed their independence, seceded from the union, and
called loudly upon the world for recognition and support,
what would our reaction be? What options would we have? I
think you see the point.</p>
<p>A more promising course of action for the Lithuanians
would be to back down for now, be a "good little state" for
two or three years, until the political and economic reforms
are on a firmer footing.</p>

<p>I will not believe that 61% of Americans would rather
maintain friendly ties with the murderous U.S.S.R. than
support freedom for Lithuania. Something must have gone wrong
with the poll. I have not found a single person who agrees.</p>
<p>Americans who wave the flag and celebrate our Constitution
and the anniversary of our freedom should at least prefer to
support freedom for the people of Lithuania, whose bondage
the U.S. has never recognized. Those same Americans should at
least question friendship with a nation that is guilty of
murdering millions of its own and other people, and that has
antagonized and opposed the U.S. for more than 40 years. This
poll, coming on the heels of Soviet admission of guilt for
the Katyn Forest massacre, reveals much about changing
American values.</p>
<p>A nation that can find nothing worth fighting for is
doomed.</p>
