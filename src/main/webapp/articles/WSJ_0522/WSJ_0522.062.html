	<p class="article-leader">SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Cypress Semiconductor Corp. filed a
countersuit against Advanced Micro Devices Inc., alleging
that Advanced Micro attempted to monopolize a key
computer-chip market through "fraud, deceit, breach of
contract and baseless litigation."
   The claim, in which Cypress is seeking in excess of $30
million in damages, was in response to an August 1988
patent-infringement suit by Advanced Micro against Cypress
and several other chip makers, covering certain specialty
chips known as programmable logic devices, used in laptop
computers, among other products.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Cypress previously denied the charge and asserted that the
patents at issue were invalid and, in any event, covered by a
1983 license agreement between Cypress and Monolithic
Memories Inc., which Advanced Micro acquired in 1988.</p>
<p>The Cypress counterclaim, filed here in federal court,
alleges that Advanced Micro's acquisition of Monolithic
Memories was part of a plan to obtain Cypress technology and
monopolize the market in violation of state and federal
antitrust law. Cypress also alleges that Monolithic Memories
defrauded it as part of the earlier exchange because
Monolithic Memories knew that the patent rights it purported
to license were being challenged in court.</p>
<p>Cypress, which has been the target of some 20 lawsuits
over the past seven years and has settled them all, said the
counterclaim was "the first time Cypress has gone on the
legal offensive."</p>
<p>"I got a bag of worthless patents, and they got $10
million," said T.J. Rodgers, president and chief executive
officer of Cypress, noting that Monolithic Memories received
Cypress stock as part of the 1983 transaction. "I want my
chips back, and I want my technology back and I want
damages."</p>
<p>Advanced Micro, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., called the
countersuit "the standard response of a patent infringer" and
termed the fraud claim "bizarre."</p>
