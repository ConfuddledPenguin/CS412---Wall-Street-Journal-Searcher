	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Agriculture Department's inspector
general is looking into apparent cash rebates and other
irregularities in government-guaranteed commodity sales to
Iraq, as an offshoot of the $2 billion Banca Nazionale del
Lavoro scandal.
   Department officials who run the export credit-guarantee
program have reviewed U.S. commodity sales totaling $720
million to Iraq in the mid-1980s that allegedly were financed
with unauthorized letters of credit issued by the Italian
bank's Atlanta branch. The administrative review showed at
least two "potential problem areas," the department said
yesterday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The inspector general's office has been asked to
investigate "after-sales services" said to have been sought
by Iraqi officials from U.S. exporters. Services appear to
have involved, among other things, providing cash rebates or
discounts to the Iraqi government, using favored Iraqi
shipping companies, and supplying truck parts or tires as
well as additional commodities, according to a department
report.</p>
<p>"Iraq has identified several exporters who apparently
provided after-sales service," the report said.</p>
<p>The inquiry will also focus on unusually high prices
commanded by exporters involved in the commodity sales. Iraq
paid sugar prices $15 to $40 a metric ton higher the
world-market price for sugar and at least $10 higher for rice
and corn, according to the report. The higher prices may have
reflected a perception among exporters that Iraq, which was
at war with Iran at the time, was "a high-risk market," the
report said.</p>
<p>In some transactions, the report added, exporters
apparently violated a credit-guarantee program rule by
factoring part of the freight costs into the commodity
prices.</p>
<p>The inspector general's office will also examine whether
the value of the commodity sales was properly reported when
export-credit guarantees were sought from the department's
Commodity Credit Corp.</p>
<p>The corporation hasn't incurred any losses as a result of
the BNL affair, which is being investigated by a federal
grand jury in Atlanta as well as banking regulators. The
loans guaranteed by the corporation were part of a
"clandestine loan operation" in which BNL officials allegedly
booked more than $2 billion in unauthorized and unreported
loans to Iraq, the report said.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter
said Iraq bought more than $4.5 billion in U.S. commodities
with Commodity Credit guarantees since 1983.</p>
<p>The department's administrative review focused mostly on
Entrade Inc., a New York subsidiary of Enka Group, a Turkish
firm. The Internal Revenue Service alleged that a former
officer of BNL's Atlanta branch received a $289,960 kickback
from Entrade. The officer, in a suit filed last fall in
federal court in New York to block IRS seizure of his
residence and bank account, denied receiving any kickback.
Entrade has declined to comment.</p>
