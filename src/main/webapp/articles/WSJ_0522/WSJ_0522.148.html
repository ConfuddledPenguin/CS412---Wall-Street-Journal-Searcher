	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- A.H. Belo Corp. said its Universal Belo
Productions joint venture has begun an advertising campaign
intended to help newspapers improve readership.
   The joint venture, created by the newspaper and television
concern and Universal Press Syndicate, will use characters
from Universal features like "Cathy," "Ziggy," "The Far Side"
and Dear Abby promoting newspapers through print, radio,
billboard and television ads.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A Universal Belo spokesman said that newspapers will pay
between $3,000 and $100,000 to use the campaign, depending on
their circulation and the package of advertisements they buy.</p>
<p>The joint venture between Belo and Universal, which also
is supposed to develop television features using the
Universal characters, led Universal to pull 26 popular
features, including Dear Abby, "Doonesbury" and "The Far
Side," from the Dallas Times Herald. The Times Herald,
Dallas's No. 2 newspaper, responded by suing Belo and its
Dallas Morning News for $33 million in state court, charging
contract interference and unfair competition.</p>
<p>A jury, however, last week sided with Belo and the Dallas
Morning News, the market leader, concluding that they weren't
guilty of unfair competition.</p>
