	<p class="article-leader">At the beginning of Sue Miller's second novel, "Family
Pictures" (Harper & Row, 389 pages, $19.95), the blurred
memory of a birthday party triggers a flood of painful
recollections. The time is the early 1960s; the place, a
bustling household in the exclusive Hyde Park neighborhood
near the University of Chicago. Nina Eberhardt is recalling
her brother Mack's 14th birthday, when she and her siblings
are singing as the cake is brought in. The song stops, and
her autistic brother, Randall, speaks: "Happy birthday, dear
Mackie." Yet Nina's mother insists that she's got it wrong:
Randall never spoke after the age of four, and Nina has
merely appropriated the story to suit her own psychological
needs. "But that's the way it is in a family, isn't it?" Nina
asks. "The stories get passed around, polished, embellished."
   The stories that are passed around in "Family Pictures"
are told in four different voices: Nina takes turns with
Mack, her mother and her psychiatrist father in describing
the catastrophes that punctuate the family's 40-year history.
The chief crisis is Randall's autism, which drives Lainie
Eberhardt to produce three more children, Nina, Mary and
Sarah. David Eberhardt's mocking nicknames for his youngest
daughters -- "the last straws," "the pitchers of health" --
expose his bitter knowledge that the girls were conceived to
"make up" for Randall's illness.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The strain of caring for Randall, whom Lainie refuses to
send to an institution, eventually shatters her marriage: In
1964, when Nina is 12, David moves out of the house. Lainie
falls apart after he leaves and is able to focus only on
Randall, leaving the other children to fend for themselves.
In desperation Mack takes charge, and somehow, liberated from
their father's constant angry criticisms, "a kind of peace
and freedom" freshens the house's suffocating atmosphere.</p>
<p>Eventually, as Randall takes on the outward
characteristics of adulthood, he becomes too difficult for
Lainie to manage alone. The day comes when he unintentionally
pushes Lainie hard enough to knock her unconscious. After
recovering, she reluctantly agrees to send him to a school in
Connecticut. Lainie and David have a reconciliation soon
after Randall leaves, and David moves back into the house.</p>
<p>But all is not yet well. Randall's departure triggers a
rebellion in both Mack and Nina; as Nina admits, "there was
suddenly room for Mack and me to go crazy, to be as mad, as
bad, as we wanted. . . . Or it could have been just that it
was the sixties and there was a perfect congruence between
the time -- which heaped its praise on acting out -- and our
lives." Mack drops out of his senior year at Harvard and
allows himself, despite his parents' protests, to be sent to
Vietnam. Meanwhile Nina, who is still in high school, has an
affair with an older man, mistakenly believes she is
pregnant, and runs away to Columbus, Ohio, where she stays
for a week before shamefacedly returning home.</p>
<p>The later life of the family is related in fits and
starts: Mack returns from Vietnam, is married and divorced
twice, becomes a co-owner of a Chicago bar; Nina graduates
from the University of Chicago, becomes a photographer, gets
married, suffers a miscarriage. When Randall dies suddenly in
an accident at school, the family reunites briefly for his
funeral. Then, finally freed from mutual responsibility for
Randall, Lainie and David break apart again, this time for
good. In time, David marries a family friend with whom he had
long ago had an affair.</p>
<p>Looking at a family portrait at the book's conclusion,
Nina reflects that "it was really a portrait of a kind of
reckless courage, a testament to the great loving
carelessness at the heart of every family's life, even ours.
That each child represented such risk, such blind daring on
its parents' parts -- such possibility for anguish and pain
-- that each one's existence was a kind of miracle."</p>
<p>"Family Pictures" itself represents a kind of blind
daring. In Ms. Miller's first novel, "The Good Mother"
(1986), the story of a custody battle was narrated
singlehandedly and schematically by the "good mother"
herself. The new book has no less than four points of view,
constant shifts in time and setting, and an altogether finer
texture. But while Ms. Miller shows herself to have
sufficient control over her complicated material, and even to
be capable of some lovely moments, certain built-in
limitations seem to have gotten the better of her.</p>
<p>For one thing, Randall, the character who is responsible
for shaping everyone else's behavior, never seems to have
much of a physical presence. He is described as "an awkward
little machine," "a trusting, cheerful pet," but aside from a
few indications that he resembles Mack we never really get a
sense of what Randall looks like. Long before he dies, he
seems more like a troubling ghost than an actual person, as
if the family were reacting to the idea of Randall rather
than to the human being himself.</p>
<p>This is not to suggest that it is easy to offer a vivid
portrait of an autistic person; of course it is not. Yet
Randall isn't the only one in the book who seems to lack
definition. Except for Lainie, who seems to have real flesh
and blood, the other characters are sketched rather
halfheartedly. Ms. Miller digs a little way into the depths
of each person and then stops -- for the simple reason that
in going further she risks turning the narrative into
melodrama. Ms. Miller's novel is an honest, sensitive and in
many ways very gifted performance. But her reluctance to
round out her characters' hearts and minds makes "Family
Pictures" an ultimately unsatisfying venture.</p>
