	<p class="article-leader">Ross Stores Inc., citing inventory and marketing problems,
said first-quarter profit declined 53%.
   For the 13 weeks ended May 5, the Newark, Calif.,
off-price apparel retailer reported net income of $1.6
million, or seven cents a share, compared with $3.4 million,
or 14 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 9% to $171
million from $155 million, the company said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ross, which said it was "disappointed" by the results,
cited imbalances in the apparel mix in its stores prompted by
a late fourth-quarter attempt to control inventory by cutting
back receipts of early spring and basic merchandise. It added
that its marketing efforts didn't meet expectations, either.</p>
<p>"The merchandise mix in our stores has returned to normal
seasonal proportions, and we are currently implementing
programs to strengthen our marketing," the company said.</p>
<p>Ross had 161 stores at May 5, compared with 143 a year
earlier.</p>
