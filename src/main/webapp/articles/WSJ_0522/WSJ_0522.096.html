	<p class="article-leader">As Secretary of State James Baker left for Moscow last
week, he suggested that if he didn't reach a new arms
agreement, it wouldn't be because he lacked flexibility. He
was right, the U.S. seems to have made all the concessions.
It's too bad he didn't get anything for them.
   In particular, Mr. Baker came back with nothing on
conventional arms in Europe; White House national security
adviser Brent Scowcroft declared Saturday that the Soviets
"are now stonewalling" the whole issue. So not a word about
those 40,000 Soviet tanks. Nothing on the 380,000 Red Army
troops in East Germany, soon to be part of West Germany. Yet
the removal of those forces and destruction of the armaments
were supposed to be the major goals of U.S. policy.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Rolling the Red Army out of Eastern Europe was supposed to
be the historic achievement to redeem official American
silence about Lithuania. The Moscow preliminaries seem to
give Mr. Gorbachev a blank check to keep cranking up the heat
on Lithuania and the other Baltics. And the Russians can
continue to insist, as they did to Mr. Baker, that a united
Germany can never, ever be part of NATO, despite the clear
wishes of even most East Germans.</p>
<p>For his part, George Bush seems uncertain about Mr.
Baker's claim of "real accomplishments." At first on
Saturday, the President gave the results in Moscow "a mixed
review," but since then has called it "a major step forward."
Maybe his opinion will change again after he sees the fine
print. He has to remember that the details will be
scrutinized by the Democratic Senate, perhaps one looking for
its chance to get to his right on foreign policy.</p>
<p>Laying aside the geopolitical stakes in Eastern Europe,
the big U.S. objective in START has been to limit the
first-strike potential of the huge Soviet land-based missile
force. Under the Baker deal, the Soviets agree to cut by half
the number of their huge SS-18 missiles, each of which has 10
highly accurate warheads. But the U.S. has dropped its
earlier demand that the Soviets not test the 154 remaining
missiles; this means it can and will modernize the force to
make up for what it lost. Meanwhile, the Soviets have also
refused any limits on SS-24s and SS-25s, their
impossible-to-verify land-based mobile missiles. The U.S. has
no land-based mobile missiles -- none. The Soviet
first-strike advantage remains intact.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the American advantage in high-tech cruise
missiles has been badly eroded. This is our best new
defensive weapon, highly accurate; when armed with
conventional warheads it can destroy invading tanks without
blowing up everything nearby. The U.S. agreed to the Soviet
demand for a range limit of 375 miles on air-launched
cruises, so they'll no longer be available for long-range
missions.</p>
<p>Mr. Baker also agreed to limit sea-launched cruises in a
side-letter said to be "nonbinding." But when was a U.S.
arms-control promise ever "nonbinding?" The U.S. is still
abiding by SALT II a decade after the Senate refused to
ratify it. The deal does allow 880 sea-launched cruises, more
than the Navy currently intends to deploy, and there is
supposed to be some special treatment for a new non-nuclear
cruise missile known as "Tacit Rainbow." But experience warns
that when arms control targets a class of weapons it erodes
the economics, and the budget process moves in for the kill.
Putting sea-cruises into a side agreement without
verification clearly means that the U.S. will be limited, but
the Soviets won't.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Backfire bomber, an issue that has
bedeviled all arms talks for years, is described as a
"detail" to be worked out. Along with the SS-18 and mobile
missiles. This is silly.</p>
<p>The chemical-arms accord isn't any more reassuring. To
begin with, how do we know the size of the chemical
stockpiles the Russians are supposed to cut? And how can we
take their word on a new treaty, when they're still saying
the mysterious explosion and murderous outbreak of anthrax at
Sverdlovsk in 1979 was caused by contaminated meat? Did
Secretary Baker renounce the longstanding U.S. position that
Sverdlovsk was an arms-plant accident showing that the
Soviets violated an existing treaty calling for destruction
of biological weapons, just as the new treaty calls for
destruction of chemical weapons?</p>
<p>What the U.S. gets for these concessions, apparently, is a
feeling of reassurance that Mikhail Gorbachev will continue
to hold power in the Soviet Union. His economy's a shambles.
His former allies in East Europe want his troops out. Mr.
Gorbachev is the one who should be dying to make the
concessions; instead he seems to own the Bush administration.
The U.S. is committed to him not only regardless of his
policy in the Baltics, but also regardless of the strategic
balance.</p>
<p>President Bush no doubt wants a pleasant summit with Mr.
Gorbachev next week, but in fact no treaty has been concluded
so far. And as President Bush ponders what his Secretary of
State brought back from Moscow, he should also reflect on the
fates of presidents who too eagerly signed arms accords in
the 1970s. If Jimmy Carter signed this deal, he'd be hooted
out of town.</p>
