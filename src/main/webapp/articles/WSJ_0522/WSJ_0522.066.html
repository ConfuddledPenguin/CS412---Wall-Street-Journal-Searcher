	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Kidder, Peabody & Co., once the biggest
program trader on Wall Street, ended a six-month pullback
from the practice. The action is the latest sign that the
furor over computer-driven trading strategies continues to
wane.
   Kidder, a unit of General Electric Co., was one of six
major brokerage firms that last fall stopped doing
stock-index arbitrage for their own accounts, amid a public
outcry against program trading. Kidder said it resumed the
activity after "extensive conversations" with the New York
Stock Exchange and its own brokers and clients.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Index arbitrage involves rapid-fire trades of big baskets
of stocks with offsetting trades of stock-index futures and
options. It is the most common and controversial form of
program trading. Critics have blamed such computer-driven
trading for big market swings, including the 1987
stock-market crash and the market's sharp plunge Oct. 13.</p>
<p>Kidder is the second big Wall Street firm to resume index
arbitrage for its own account. Bear Stearns Cos. announced a
similar resumption last December. In the Big Board's latest
weekly statistics, Bear Stearns was the most active Wall
Street program trader -- with an average 2.1 million shares a
day traded in program-trading strategies, almost all of it
involving index arbitrage for its own account. (Kidder was
the fifth-biggest program trader; most of its trades were
index arbitrage for customers.)</p>
<p>Kidder's decision reflects both the big brokerage firm's
quest for profits -- the firm had a net loss of $23 million
last year -- as well as a reluctance on the part of the Big
Board to take an overly aggressive stand against program
trading. While the Big Board has publicly cautioned brokerage
firms about disruptive program-trading activity, it hasn't
been as forceful as program-trading critics would like.</p>
<p>Indeed, with overall trading volume on the Big Board off
about 15% from last year's pace, traders are happy for any
volume they can get -- even from program trading.</p>
<p>A Big Board "blue-ribbon panel" on program trading and
stock-market volatility has been meeting for about five
months, but hasn't yet issued recommendations. Because the
panel isn't expected to recommend a major crackdown on
program trading, brokerage firms apparently don't fear a
backlash from the Big Board if they plunge back into program
activity.</p>
<p>Letters and phone calls from many of Kidder's 1,400
brokers helped spur Kidder's program pullback last October,
after the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 190 points
Oct. 13.</p>
<p>Charles Sheehan, Kidder's managing director in charge of
retail sales, said that two months ago he asked about 100 of
the firm's top-producing brokers about their current views on
program trading, and "close to 90%" of those responding
supported a resumption of program trading by Kidder. "I think
they understand what we're trying to do is position Kidder as
a leader in developing modern portfolio management
techniques," Mr. Sheehan said.</p>
<p>In March, Kidder lost its head of customer program
trading, Joseph R. Schmuckler, who joined Nomura Securities
Co. to help Nomura's planned plunge into program trading.</p>
<p>Thomas F. Ryan, Kidder's executive managing director in
charge of stock trading, said the firm would take a
"controlled, responsible approach" to index arbitrage. "We're
willing to bend over here" to avoid disrupting the markets,
he said.</p>
<p>Kidder said that in its index arbitrage trading, it would
at all times sell stocks only on "upticks" (when a stock is
rising), and buy only on "downticks." This approach is meant
to avoid accelerating a market move already under way. Kidder
also said it would make data on its index arbitrage activity
available not only to the Big Board but to "other interested
parties."</p>
<p>A prominent program-trading critic was disturbed by
Kidder's move.</p>
<p>"These guys aren't helping the financial markets; there's
no way in the world it could help the small investors," said
Charles Wohlstetter, chairman of Contel Corp., a Big
Board-listed company. Mr. Wohlstetter has sharply criticized
the exchange for its program-trading stance and has led a
loose confederation of chief executives campaigning against
program trading in Washington.</p>
<p>At Merrill Lynch & Co., the nation's biggest brokerage
firm, a spokesman yesterday said, "We continue not to do
index arbitrage for ourselves or for clients," and that there
aren't any plans for resuming the activity.</p>
