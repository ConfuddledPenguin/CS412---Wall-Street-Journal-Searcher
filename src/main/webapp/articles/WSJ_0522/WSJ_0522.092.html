	<p class="article-leader">This may be the year voters start throwing out some House
Members. Recently, over 98% of incumbents have won by
erecting a fortress-like system of advantages that ward off
challengers. That fortress may finally be showing a few
cracks. In Democratic primaries in Pennsylvania and West
Virginia this month, underfinanced challengers almost
defeated two entrenched incumbents by running against
Congress.
   Political analyst Charles Cook says national polls by both
parties show voters have soured on Congress even more than
usual. That's why the recent primary results have so shaken
Capitol Hill. In West Virginia, 14-year incumbent Nick Joe
Rahall won only 56.7% of the vote against 75-year-old Ken
Hechler. Mr. Hechler had served in Congress in the early
1970s, but this time he was able to run only a modest,
grass-roots campaign. His major issues were Congressman
Rahall's support for a Congressional pay raise and the
arrogance of Washington.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Those were also the major themes of Robert Burkley, an
unknown, small-town lawyer who held Pennsylvania Rep. John P.
Murtha, the powerful head of the Defense Appropriations
subcommittee, to only 51% of the vote. Mr. Murtha is
considered enough of a Washington power broker that he once
ran on the slogan "John P. Murtha -- the `P' is for Power."</p>
<p>Mr. Burkley attacked the incumbent for being one of only
48 Members to support a 51% pay raise last year and for
refusing to support Congressional ethics reform. Mr. Burkley
also supported a limit on Congressional terms, and says that
struck a chord with voters.</p>
<p>Still, Mr. Burkley was able to raise only $40,000 for his
campaign, and he collected only $1,250 from PACs. Rep. Murtha
spent at least $500,000, much of it on TV ads featuring Lee
Iacocca and actor E.G. Marshall. He also blanketed the
district with three taxpayer-paid junk-mail pieces. Mr.
Burkley was able to get free media coverage by carrying a
cardboard likeness of the incumbent and offering a $1,000
reward to anyone who could get Mr. Murtha to debate him.</p>
<p>Two elections don't make a trend, but incumbent
close-calls this early in the primary season are highly
unusual. Mr. Burkley told us the Congressional pay raise and
the general anti-Congress mood will be powerful issues for
challengers this fall. When the pay raise passed,
Congressional leaders of both parties signed a "nonaggression
pact" designed to avoid using the issue in the 1990 campaign
and to punish challengers who did.</p>
<p>The near-success of Messr. Heckler and Burkley make it
likely that this Beltway attempt to smother campaign debate
will be routinely ignored. We supported a pay raise for
Congress to get an increase for executive-branch senior
managers and federal judges, who were yoked to Congress on
this vote. But for voters the issue has become a powerful
symbol for all that is wrong with the institution. The most
popular antidote among voters is some kind of limit on
Congressional terms.</p>
<p>The usual arsenal of incumbents -- franked mail,
gerrymandering, bloated staffs and incumbent-addicted PACs --
may not be enough to return another carbon-copy House to
office this November.</p>
