	<p class="article-leader">Gannett Co. adopted special anti-takeover measures amid
speculation the company could be put into play by the Gannett
Foundation's decision to sell its 10% stake in the
broadcasting and media giant.
   Although no clear bidder has surfaced for the stake, the
largest block of Gannett stock, the foundation has said it
has "numerous expressions of interest" from potential buyers.
It declined to identify the interested parties.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As reported, the foundation hired Salomon Brothers Inc. to
negotiate the possible sale of its 15.9 million shares of
Gannett stock. Gannett Co.'s former chairman Allen H.
Neuharth, who is now chairman of the foundation, said he
prefers to sell the stock to the company or to an employee
stock option plan. However, he said Salomon Brothers will
explore expressions of interest "from other potential
buyers."</p>
<p>John J. Curley, chairman, president and chief executive of
Gannett Co., said in a statement that the plan isn't in
response to any specific takeover offer "and the board is not
aware of any such effort." He added that the company's aim is
to "protect stockholders in the event of an unsolicited
attempt to acquire the company through abusive takeover
tactics which the board believes are not in the best interest
of stockholders."</p>
<p>Among companies said by Wall Street investment bankers to
be potential buyers of the Gannett stake are Paramount
Communications Inc., Capital Cities/ABC Inc. and Viacom
International Inc. Paramount and Viacom said they don't
comment on such speculation, and Capital Cities executives
couldn't be reached for comment. Paramount, for its part, has
plenty of cash on hand, but is unlikely to do anything
unfriendly. Analysts familiar with the company say it would
be far more likely to favor a friendly merger with a company
such as Gannett rather than a purchase that would dilute
earnings and add debt. Paramount is also considered a
potential white knight for Gannett should an unfriendly
bidder emerge.</p>
<p>People familiar with Capital Cities, meanwhile, say the
company isn't likely to pay a hefty price for an acquisition
at present. What's more, Gannett's ownership of broadcast
properties would present regulatory problems.</p>
<p>Many of the largest newspaper-oriented media companies
that might be natural buyers are expected to keep their
distance. Knight-Ridder Co., for example, has said it isn't
interested. John Morton, an analyst at Lynch Jones & Ryan,
said he doubts any major newspaper company will be a
purchaser of the Gannett Foundation stake because of
fraternal reasons. "Newspapers, as competitive as they are,
have collegial, fraternal feelings toward each other," said
Mr. Morton. "Plus very few companies with the media interests
are in the position to buy the whole company, and they
wouldn't want the 10% if they couldn't have the whole
company."</p>
<p>Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. has also been rumored as a
potential bidder. But the company is strapped with debt, and
has said it won't be embarking on any new acquisitions for
now. Martin Singerman, head of News America Publishing, the
News Corp. unit, said, "I have never heard Rupert {Murdoch}
express any interest in Gannett stock and it's highly
unlikely we will have interest in the future."</p>
<p>Analysts have said Gannett Co., the nation's largest
newspaper publisher, would be a difficult and costly takeover
target. But several analysts said the announcement by Gannett
yesterday of a stock-purchase rights plan only heightens
speculation that the media company is preparing for a
takeover. "The plan gives the company ammunition to deal with
whatever situation comes up," said Bruce Thorp, a newspaper
analyst for Provident National Bank. "Putting the plan in
place will get people excited about what could happen with
the block of stock."</p>
<p>The Gannett board voted to give holders a dividend
distribution of one preferred share purchase right on each
share of Gannett common outstanding. As is common in such
plans, the proposal effectively gives shareholders the right
to buy shares at half price in the event of a takeover
attempt. The distribution of rights will be made on June 8 to
stockholders of record on that date. Each right will entitle
stockholders to buy 1/200th of a share of a new series of
junior participating preferred stock at an exercise price of
$150.</p>
<p>The plan would take effect upon acquisition of a 15%
interest in the company, although directors have the
authority to reduce the threshold to not less than 10%.</p>
