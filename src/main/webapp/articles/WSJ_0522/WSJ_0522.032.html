	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Harper Collins, a book-publishing affiliate of
News Corp., agreed to sell health-care publisher J.B.
Lippincott Co. to an Amsterdam publisher for more than $250
million.
   Harper Collins put the unit up for sale in mid-April,
seeking to cut debt and focus itself more sharply on book
publishing. Analysts had estimated that Philadelphia-based
Lippincott, which publishes newsletters, journals and books
on medical topics, might fetch $200 million to as much as
$250 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Six bidders vied for Lippincott; the winner was a New York
subsidiary of Wolters Kluwer N.V., which currently owns
medical publishers Raven Press and Aspen Publishers.</p>
<p>Harper declined to disclose the other bidders. But people
in the industry said that Paramount Communications Inc., the
entertainment company here; Toronto publisher Thomson Corp.;
Britain's Reed International PLC and Pearson PLC; and
Elsevier N.V. of the Netherlands all bid for Lippincott.</p>
<p>Of the transaction's terms, a spokesman for Harper did say
that "we think it's a good price" at 19 times to 20 times
annual earnings. Revenue at Lippincott approaches $100
million, industry analysts estimate.</p>
<p>Harper Collins publishes books on general subjects; it
also produces texts for high schools and colleges and,
through its Zondervan unit, books on religious topics.</p>
<p>Lippincott, founded in 1792, publishes materials for
medicine, dentistry, nursing and other health-care fields.
The company's Drug Facts & Comparisons provides U.S.
pharmacists with data about drugs.</p>
<p>News Corp., the media giant controlled by the investor
Rupert Murdoch, has been building a publishing group over the
past few years. It acquired Harper & Row for $293 million in
April 1987, Zondervan in August 1988, the 60% it didn't own
of British Publisher William Collins in January 1989, and
Scott Foresman for $407 million last November.</p>
<p>Wolters Kluwer has nearly 100 companies in its fold,
employing more than 8,000 in Europe and the U.S. The company
earned $75 million on $1 billion of sales in 1989.</p>
<p>The companies signed a definitive agreement; they expect
to close the transaction, subject to clearance by regulators,
by June 29.</p>
