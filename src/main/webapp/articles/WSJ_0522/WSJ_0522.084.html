	<p class="article-leader">CITY OF INDUSTRY, Calif. -- Big-company executives who
yearn to become entrepreneurs often worry about the
transition. Has life in the corporate bureaucracy ruined them
for meeting the radically different demands of a small
business?
   But Randall J. Wall found his corporate experience
directly helped him bolster a small company, even though the
transition was often tough. A former executive with
Bristol-Myers Co., now Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Mr. Wall and
a group of investors bought International Medication Systems
Ltd., a medical products concern, in August 1988. "It was a
company that could benefit from senior managers out of
Fortune 500 companies," says the 43-year-old executive, now
president of International Medication.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Among other assets, International Medication had invented
the right product at the right time: a needle with a plastic
sheath to prevent the accidental punctures that health-care
workers fear in this era of acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.</p>
<p>But there were management problems. The family-owned
company hadn't bothered to devise a plan for manufacturing
and marketing the patented needle, called Stick-Gard. So it
sat on the company's drawing board for almost four years.</p>
<p>The new owners also say they had to spend an unanticipated
$10 million in addition to the $50 million purchase price to
improve manufacturing and record-keeping. The company built
new manufacturing rooms, complete with a computerized system
to control the environment. It adopted a better
product-sterilization process. It hired a consultant to
develop new training programs for employees. And it installed
a security-alarm system to allay Drug Enforcement
Administration concerns about potential break-ins, as the
company makes controlled substances such as morphine, in
addition to its drug-delivery systems and pharmaceutical
equipment.</p>
<p>"These were all things we'd planned to do over three to
four years, and we had to do them in a 12-month period," Mr.
Wall says.</p>
<p>The company also needed to repair some damaged customer
relations. "They went through some problems filling orders,"
says Louis Soars, product manager for VHA Supply Co., Irving,
Texas, which purchases medical products for about 840
hospitals. International Medication responded by setting
aside hundreds of thousands of dollars of backup inventory.
"Since then, I've had no complaints," Mr. Soars says.</p>
<p>Besides making these improvements, the new management team
of executives, culled from big health-care companies,
approached strategy and marketing in methodical corporate
style. "As a family-run company, there was no large-scale
coordination, and they weren't used to prioritizing products"
to emphasize the most lucrative ones, Mr. Wall says.</p>
<p>With limited staff and money, the new management
discontinued about 30% of International Medication's product
line, to focus on promoting products that had more profit
potential. "We had to look at what products would increase
sales and gain visibility for the company," Mr. Wall says.</p>
<p>Because of the AIDS crisis, the new team decided that
Stick-Gard offered the most mileage of any of its products.
About 12 health-care workers in the U.S. are reported to have
contracted the AIDS virus through punctures by contaminated
needles. In March, Veronica Prego, a New York doctor, settled
for an undisclosed sum her $175 million lawsuit against New
York City's Kings County Hospital. The physician claimed she
had acquired AIDS through an accidental needle puncture.
Also, as many as 300 medical workers die each year from
hepatitis they acquired on the job.</p>
<p>Such alarming statistics help market Stick-Gard,
particularly as the safety needle costs about 45 cents and
regular needles cost only three cents. The company's print
advertisements blare: "Your choice . . . 800,000 reported
needle sticks. Or Stick-Gard Safety Needle." International
Medication says its product is competitively priced, because
it "eliminates administrative costs associated with needle
stick injury." Testing a worker for diseases after an
accidental puncture can cost as much as $1,000, the company
says.</p>
<p>International Medication launched a direct-mail campaign
to 6,700 hospitals and clinics in March to try to sell
Stick-Gard. The company hadn't used direct mail before, but
"We knew our 29 sales representatives couldn't cover that
many hospitals," Mr. Wall says.</p>
<p>To date, the company has received inquiries from more than
900 medical institutions for the product; this is a 13%
response rate, compared with the 3.5% such a mailing usually
generates. Mr. Wall expanded the marketing team to six people
from two, and boosted marketing expenses about 25%. In true
big-company style, the concern designed glossy new product
catalogs, which include previously unexploited corporate
trivia such as: "I.M.S. was honored to have had our Min-I-Jet
prefilled syringe on board the Space Shuttle Discovery Flight
51-D, in April 1985."</p>
<p>Customers have noticed the changes. At SunHealth Corp., a
Charlotte, N.C.-based hospital network, "We've had a contract
with IMS for several years, and I think we're encouraged that
they seem to be more responsive to the needs of the
marketplace," Ken Mitchell, senior director, materials
services, says. "We definitely see that with the Stick-Gard
product."</p>
<p>Financial results are already showing improvement, too.
International Medication says it expects sales of about $38
million this year, a 20% increase from 1988. It predicts
operating profit of about $6.5 million this year, up 10% from
1988.</p>
<p>Mr. Wall caught the entrepreneurial bug while working to
turn flagging operations around at a Bristol-Myers unit. So
he and five senior managers defected from the subsidiary to
buy International Medication. After an auto accident, the
company's founder, Robert Ogle, had turned the management
over to family members, who later decided to sell the
concern. "It was time to take the corporate experience and
put it into something entrepreneurial," Mr. Wall says.</p>
