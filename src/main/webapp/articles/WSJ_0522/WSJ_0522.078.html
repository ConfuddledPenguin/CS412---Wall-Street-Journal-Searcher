	<p class="article-leader">Federal farm policy is founded upon two delusions: that
farmers are needy and that farmers are a vanishing species.
In reality, the average full-time farmer is a millionaire and
the number of full-time farmers has significantly increased
since 1980. The U.S. has appeared to be suffering from a
"farm crisis" primarily because part-time farmers are being
counted as full-timers.
   Agriculture Department statistics state that the total
number of farmers shrank from 2,440,000 in 1980 to 2,197,000
in 1988 -- an apparent decrease of 243,000 farmers. This is a
statistical illusion -- caused by an absurd definition of who
is a "farmer." According to the Agriculture Department,
anyone who sells more than $1,000 in agricultural commodities
-- the equivalent of 250 bushels of wheat or one horse -- is
a farmer. But these aren't commercial farmers: These are
gentlemen farmers, hobby farmers and tax farmers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>And it is hobby farming, not commercial farming, that is
shrinking: Most of the apparent decrease in the number of
farmers in the 1980s occurred among farmers selling less than
$10,000 in agricultural commodities a year. These farmers
received the vast majority of their income from off-farm work
and who listed some occupation other than farming as their
"primary occupation in the 1987 Census of Agriculture.</p>
<p>Many agriculture economists agree that a viable full-time
farm grosses at least $100,000 a year from the sale of
agricultural commodities. In 1980 there were 271,000 farmers
with sales above $100,000; by 1988 there were 323,000 farmers
in this class. These farmers perennially collect between 80%
and 90% of all farm income.</p>
<p>Some farm-aid advocates argue that farmers who gross
between $40,000 and $99,999 ought also to be counted as
full-time farmers. But this is unrealistic: A farmer can
raise $40,000 in corn in only seven weeks. Many of the
farmers in the $40,000-$99,999 category spend much of the
year doing something else.</p>
<p>In 1988 a bad drought occurred, and the public was given
the impression that farmers were having a terrible year. The
Agriculture Department later publicly declared that the
average farmer's income in 1988 was $21,300 -- even though
department officials recognize that this figure is a largely
meaningless average of full-time and part-time farmers'
income. In reality, the average full-timer farmer in 1988
reaped an income of $168,000. (The average U.S. family income
was $38,608 in 1988.) Even the part-time farmers in the
$40,000-$99,999 class earned incomes higher than the national
average: $39,931 (most of which came from off-farm earnings).</p>
<p>The huge financial gap between farmers and non-farmers
becomes even more stark when considering net worth. The
Census Bureau concluded in 1986 that the median net worth of
American households was $78,734, and that the mean net worth
of American households was $32,677. In contrast, the average
full time farmer is a millionaire, worth, after deducting
debt, $1,016,000 as of Dec. 31, 1988. Even part-time farmers
are far wealthier than average American families: Farmers in
the $40,000-$99,999 sales class have an average net worth of
$426,487.</p>
<p>Since farm aid is distributed not according to farmers'
need, but according to farmers' output, it inevitably fails
to achieve its stated purpose of preserving the small family
farm. To him that hath, shall be given. In 1988, the largest
farmers each received more than 100 times as much from the
federal government as the smallest farmers. With these
revenues, big farmers are able to buy out their smaller
neighbors.</p>
<p>If the same means tests were applied to farmers that are
applied to other recipients of federal handouts, virtually no
full-time farmer would qualify. In the 1988 drought act
Congress imposed a "means test" on additional aid. Farmers
with gross sales of more than $2 million a year were denied
eligibility for drought relief. A farmer with gross revenues
of $2 million probably has a net worth far above $2 million.</p>
<p>Some congressmen, including Reps. Dick Armey (R., Texas)
and Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.), have proposed extending this
principle. They are advocating ending federal handouts to
farmers who earn more than $100,000. While this proposal is
laudable, it will likely have little effect. The history of
farm programs is a history of the ingenious evasion of
payment limitations.</p>
<p>The government supposedly imposes a limit of $50,000 per
farmer already. The General Accounting Office has repeatedly
found that this limit is ignored, because farmers are
permitted to subdivide their farms and shuffle titles among
family members -- which is why Congress decreed in 1987 that
no farmer could receive more than three separate $50,000
payments. Congress then eviscerated the limit by exempting
handouts from certain farm programs from any limit
whatsoever. If Rep. Armey's $100,000 limit becomes law,
Congress will again drive super-tractor size loopholes
through it.</p>
<p>The government has a choice between subsidizing rich
farmers or inefficient farmers. A $100,000 income limit would
encourage more people to enter small-time farming, and so
impair the efficiency of American agriculture. And each
inefficient farmer that the government keeps on the land
makes it more difficult for efficient farmers to gain an
honest living in the marketplace.</p>
<p>During the 1980s, taxpayers and consumers shelled out an
unnecessary $260 billion to support America's farmers. Farm
programs cost the Treasury roughly $20 billion a year. They
cost the consumer an additional $10 billion in higher food
prices -- equivalent to over $80,000 for each full-time
farmer. And there is nothing to show for these outlays except
idled acres, polluted groundwater, and richer farmers.</p>
<p>Congress is in the process of drafting a new five-year
farm bill. Both the Bush administration and congressional
farm leaders seem basically content with current programs and
appear resolved to perpetuate the gravy train. Still, there
remains some possibility that urban members of Congress will
lead a revolt against the new farm bill.</p>
<p>There is nothing that federal agricultural programs can do
that markets cannot do better -- except provide unearned
handouts to farmers. The only sound question to ask about
farm programs is: How can we most easily get rid of them?</p>
