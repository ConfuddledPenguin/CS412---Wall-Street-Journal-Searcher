	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Against the grim backdrop surrounding budget
negotiations between Congress and the Bush administration,
the Treasury offered a snippet of good news yesterday: A
record gush of individual income-tax receipts in April gave
the U.S. a record budget surplus during the month.
   But even the $42.52 billion surplus, larger than many
analysts expected, won't be nearly enough to bring the
deficit to the $100 billion target set by the Gramm-Rudman
law for fiscal 1990 -- or even below last year's $152 billion
gap, many analysts said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Exceeding the Gramm-Rudman requirements, even by the tens
of billions of dollars now projected, won't bring any
sanctions. The budget process for fiscal 1990, which ends
Oct. 30, is past the point where automatic spending cuts kick
in. But the huge difference between the target and the actual
deficit -- not to mention the likelihood that the deficit
will widen rather than narrow this year -- would emphasize
the failure of that legislation, and of the government budget
efforts in general, to stanch the flow of red ink.</p>
<p>Still, the numbers suggest that the severe shortfall in
corporate tax receipts this year, stemming from the slowing
economy, hasn't spread to individual income taxes. In April,
receipts from personal income taxes reached $74.38 billion,
surpassing the $68.53 billion collected last April.</p>
<p>April is a key time to measure individual income taxes,
because the filing deadline for individual taxes falls in the
middle of the month. Because of the deadline, the Treasury
always finishes the month with a bulge of receipts. A quirk
of the calendar also helped enlarge the surplus. The
government pushed into March about $4.5 billion of military
salaries and other payments that were due April 1, which fell
on a Sunday.</p>
<p>Given all those special factors, Mark Melcher, director of
Washington research at Prudential-Bache Securities, said he
doesn't think the big April surplus "is necessarily great
news."</p>
<p>April's surplus followed a record monthly deficit in March
of $53.34 billion and narrowed the budget gap for the first
seven months of the fiscal year to $108.34 billion. That
compared with a deficit of $86.98 billion during the
comparable period in fiscal 1989.</p>
<p>If the Treasury doesn't do any better than it did in the
final five months of fiscal 1989 -- and few economists think
it will -- the fiscal 1990 deficit will exceed $170 billion,
Mr. Melcher said.</p>
<p>This year, as costs of the government's thrift bailout
program have grown, interest rates have risen and corporate
tax receipts have trailed expectations; private analysts and
even Bush administration officials have steadily enlarged
their estimates of the 1990 budget deficit.</p>
<p>Adding to the gloomy fiscal outlook is that a good chunk
of the saving-and-loan industry's massive bailout costs
aren't reflected in the budget.</p>
<p>The Congressional Budget Office now believes the deficit
will reach between $170 billion and $203 billion for fiscal
1990. "Tax collections during the month of April and early
May fell short of our estimates by $15 billion," said Paul
Van der Water, a CBO analyst.</p>
<p>Kathleen Stephansen, senior economist at Donaldson, Lufkin
& Jenrette, while surprised by the size April's surplus, said
she saw nothing in yesterday's report to change her opinion
that the budget deficit will reach $190 billion this year,
almost twice as much as the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction
law mandates.</p>
<p>Overall, government receipts totaled $139.62 billion last
month, compared with $128.89 billion in April 1989. At the
same time, the government spent $97.11 billion last month,
compared with $88.32 billion in April 1989. The surplus in
April 1989 was $40.57 billion.</p>
<p>More than $16.5 billion of the outlays last month were
interest payments on the federal debt.</p>
