	<p class="article-leader">HUNTWAY PARTNERS L.P. said, as expected, it will make a
first-quarter distribution to its preference unit holders
after obtaining a capital infusion and restructuring the
partnership's bank loan. As previously reported, Huntway, a
Valencia, Calif., refiner of asphalt and petroleum products,
declared a distribution of 34.5 cents a unit, payable May 30
to preference units of record May 15. Huntway said it
completed a $5 million private placement of 625,000 newly
issued preference units at $8 each to an affiliate of its
general partner. The sale increased Huntway's preference
units outstanding to about 6.2 million.</p>
