	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Chrysler Corp. is recalling part of American
Motors' 1987 production of Jeep Cherokees, Comanchees and
Wagoneers to replace overheating catalytic converters, the
Environmental Protection Agency said.
   The vehicles have 2.5-liter, fuel-injected engines built
before Oct. 16, 1986. The EPA said that 11,056 of these
models were produced but that some owners already have had
new converters installed under the vehicle-emission warranty.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Chrysler will notify vehicle owners of the repair, which
will be free. The EPA discovered the problem during routine
testing.</p>
