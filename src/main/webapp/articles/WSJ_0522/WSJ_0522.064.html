	<p class="article-leader">LA JOLLA, Calif. -- An investor group led by David H.
Batchelder said it hasn't abandoned its efforts to oust the
board of Pic 'N' Save Corp. and questioned the sincerity of
the company's plan to put itself up for sale.
   The group, Girard Partners L.P., said it won't participate
in Pic 'N' Save's auction because "it makes unnecessary
demands on potential bidders" and "isn't designed to attract
broad participation."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Pic 'N' Save fired back that its financial advisers have
already begun contacting potential buyers from a list of more
than 100 companies, individuals and other entities. The
company also extended the bid deadline to July 15 from June
20.</p>
<p>Pic 'N' Save, a Dominguez, Calif., retailer of close-out
merchandise, said Friday it would provide nonpublic
information to buyers who sign a confidentiality agreement
with several standstill provisions. Girard said the
conditions were "unacceptable."</p>
<p>Pic 'N' Save countered that its financial advisers offered
during the weekend to make "significant concessions" to
Girard to induce the group to participate in the auction.
Specifically, Pic 'N' Save offered to permit Girard to resume
its solicitation of consents and proxies for its board
nominees after July 15 if no bidder emerges. If a bidder does
come forth, the date would be pushed back to Jan. 1 to permit
negotiation of a sale agreement, a company spokesman said.</p>
<p>Girard holds a 6.7% stake in Pic 'N' Save and has been
soliciting consents from shareholders to install five of its
nominees on the company's seven-member board. One of the
group's nominees is a former Pic 'N' Save executive who holds
a 4% stake. If the group succeeds, it has said it would buy
the company or auction it off to the highest bidder.</p>
<p>In national over-the-counter trading, Pic 'N' Save slid
$1.25 a share, to $12.625, on turnover of more than one
million shares.</p>
