	<p class="article-leader">Valley Federal Savings & Loan Association, Van Nuys,
Calif., said federal thrift regulators agreed to rescind
certain operating restrictions as part of implementing the
troubled thrift's plan to restore its capital health.
   In January, the federal Office of Thrift Supervision
ordered Valley to halt all lending activities, among other
sanctions, because it failed to meet federal minimum capital
standards.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Valley said a plan approved by the OTS on May 1, and
formally adopted recently by the Valley board, allows for
"limited" new lending. The January OTS order also banned
Valley from paying stock dividends and executive bonuses as
well as transacting business with affiliates without federal
clearance, restrictions which have also been lifted. The
order also required Valley to quit accepting uninsured
deposits, and the thrift said it continues to plan to reduce
them.</p>
