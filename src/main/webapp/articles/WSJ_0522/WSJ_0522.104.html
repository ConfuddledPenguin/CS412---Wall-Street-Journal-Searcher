	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- H.H. Robertson Co., in a move that will
double its size, has agreed to buy closely held Ceco
Industries Inc. in a cash and stock transaction valued at
about $150 million.
   In a related move, Frontera S.A., a Swiss investment
company, has agreed to invest $40 million to help fund the
cash portion of the buy-out. In exchange, Frontera will
receive roughly 25%, or between 3.3 million and four million
shares of Robertson. After the transaction, Robertson, which
currently has about 6.5 million shares outstanding, will have
about 13.5 million to 14 million shares.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The move will make Robertson a $1 billion concern and open
new, but related, markets for the construction company. It
will also improve the cash-strapped Robertson's balance
sheet, enabling it to more readily secure bank financing.
Robertson said it expects to receive within a week a bank
financing commitment letter to fund continuing operations.</p>
<p>Under terms of the transaction, Ceco, of Oakbrook Terrace,
Ill., will receive $15 million in cash plus between 3.4
million and 4.1 million shares of common stock, valued at
about $50 million. Ceco would own roughly 25% of the new
company. Robertson will also assume about $85 million of
Ceco's debt.</p>
<p>The agreement will be presented to shareholders for their
approval in the third quarter. Robertson said its largest
shareholder, First City Financial Corp. with a 25% stake, has
agreed to support the buy-out. First City, of Vancouver,
British Columbia, is controlled by the Belzberg family.</p>
<p>Robertson, struggling in the depressed construction
market, posted losses from 1985 to 1988 and has omitted its
dividend since 1985. Robertson expects to realize savings
from the combination by streamlining duplicate staffs and
operations.</p>
<p>Ceco opens new markets not served by Robertson, including
overhead doors for residential and commercial markets and
side-hinged, wood and steel doors. Ceco is concentrated in
the U.S., but Robertson will undoubtedly begin selling those
products overseas, giving the company a broader international
product mix.</p>
<p>Gregory Drahuschak, an analyst with Butcher & Singer Inc.,
Pittsburgh, said the backing of Frontera may help Robertson
make inroads in Europe. "Traditionally business in Europe is
being done on the basis of who you know -- not necessarily
what you do," he said. It also gives Frontera's its first
major U.S. investment. The Swiss firm has been interested in
a friendly investment in the U.S. construction-materials
business.</p>
<p>Wall Street had hoped Robertson would be a target of a
buy-out, following news last September that a shareholder
group including Douglas A. Kass was interested in buying
Robertson for $13 a share. Nothing came of the offer, but
since that time the Kass group has boosted its stake to
15.4%. Mr. Kass said he met with a Robertson representative
regarding the transaction, but didn't have any comment.</p>
<p>Robert Kanters, an analyst with Legg Mason, Inc.,
Pittsburgh, said he believes the stock fell because Robertson
seems to be a less likely takeover target and investors know
little about Ceco's balance sheet.</p>
<p>Jack Hatcher, chairman and chief executive officer of
Robertson, will retain those positions.</p>
