	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- One of General Motors Corp.'s largest
shareholders said it is voting for a controversial plan to
boost executive pensions but against the re-election of
retiring Chairman Roger B. Smith to GM's board.
   The California Public Employees Retirement System's
decision not to back Mr. Smith's re-election isn't
"necessarily an anti-Roger vote," said Richard Koppes,
general counsel for the system, which owns 6.2 million
shares, or just under 1% of GM common stock. "Retiring CEOs
should retire. They shouldn't be on the board."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That philosophy got an unusual and unexpected boost from
the recently retired chairman of Ford Motor Co. earlier this
year. Donald E. Petersen surprised industry watchers when he
announced he would renounce his board seat when he left Ford
on March 1. Mr. Petersen declared that he didn't want to be
looking over the shoulder of his successor, Harold A. Poling.</p>
<p>Such a move is highly unusual for chief executives of
American companies, however. At GM, for example, it's
standard practice for the chairman to retire upon reaching
age 65, but remain on the board for five years after that.
Mr. Smith turns 65 on July 12, and his retirement is
scheduled for Aug. 1.</p>
<p>GM will announce results of the votes on its pension plan
and on the election of directors at its annual meeting
Friday.</p>
<p>Mr. Smith, who has presided over plenty of controversy
during nearly a decade at the helm of GM, seems destined to
leave the chairman's post on the same note. GM is proposing
to nearly double his pension, to about $1.2 million a year,
and that of some 3,350 other executives by including bonuses,
instead of base salary alone, in calculating pension
payments.</p>
<p>GM said the company's directors had the power to enact the
increase without shareholder approval, but decided to put the
matter to a vote.</p>
<p>The plan to boost executive pensions at a total cost of
$41.6 million a year has already proved divisive, attracting
backers and opponents from GM's largest shareholders. The
company argues that its executive pensions rank in the bottom
21% of major industrial corporations.</p>
<p>Recently another large shareholder, the state of Michigan,
said it would vote its 8.8 million shares against the
pension-increase plan. It couldn't be determined yesterday
how Michigan voted on Mr. Smith's re-election to the board.</p>
<p>The activist California pension fund earlier this year had
asked GM's directors to provide it with detailed information
on the process of selecting Mr. Smith's successor. More
recently, the fund had said it was leaning toward voting
against the pension increase. So the decision to vote for the
boost in pensions but against Mr. Smith's re-election as a
director is somewhat of a double surprise.</p>
<p>Mr. Koppes said the California fund decided to back the
pension-plan provision to support Chairman-elect Robert C.
Stempel. "We hope that Stempel can turn this company around,"
Mr. Koppes said. "And we don't want to make GM less
competitive" in retaining executives.</p>
<p>A GM spokesman said it wouldn't be appropriate to comment
on any of the voting. "Each individual shareholder reserves
the right to vote as they see fit," he said.</p>
