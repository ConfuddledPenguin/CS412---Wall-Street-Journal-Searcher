	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stocks started weak but ended strong, with the
Dow Jones Industrial Average blazing a trail into uncharted
territory. The industrial average posted its third new high
since last Monday.
   Some analysts say the average's current march won't end
until the index reaches 3000.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I don't think we are at the end of our run," said Trude
Latimer, market strategist at Josephthal & Co.</p>
<p>She added that there doesn't appear to be any concerted
follow-through on the occasional bouts of profit-taking that
hit the market. Selling shaved nearly 12 points off the
average on Friday, and stock prices opened lower yesterday.</p>
<p>But before long, stocks were rallying, led once again by
secondary issues.</p>
<p>"Technically, we will probably stop short at 3000 {on the
average}," said Ms. Latimer, at which point the market may be
in for some more serious selling.</p>
<p>The industrial average ended the day off its highs but
with a 24.77-point gain at 2844.68.</p>
<p>The buying started in smaller issues, lifting the broader
market averages before spreading to the blue chips. The
broader market ended with slightly sharper gains. Standard &
Poor's 500-Stock Index closed up 3.36 to 358.00, while the
New York Stock Exchange Composite Index rose 1.73 to 195.28.
The Dow Jones Equity Market Index gained 3.24 to 333.10.</p>
<p>Peter Canelo, investment strategist at Bear Stearns, said
the strength among the broader market means stocks should be
able to sustain their current advance. "That breadth is
telling us that the next step for the market is higher," Mr.
Canelo said.</p>
<p>Advancers led decliners, 997 to 538. New York Stock
Exchange volume totaled 166,280,000 shares, up from Friday's
162.5 million.</p>
<p>Nova led the most active list with a 1/2-point gain to 7
3/8 on volume of 2.5 million shares. The company announced
that it is selling its rubber division to Bayer AG of West
Germany for about 1.25 billion Canadian dollars (US$1.06
billion). As part of the deal, Nova will be released from
about C$100 million of debt. It will use the cash proceeds to
further pay down debt. Nova said the transaction may result
in a modest gain.</p>
<p>National Semiconductor was next on the list with a gain of
1/2 point to 8 1/4 on volume of nearly 2.4 million shares.</p>
<p>Bank of Boston surged 1, or 7.7%, to 14. The stock gained
1/2 point on Friday after winning the bidding for $340
million in deposits of the failed MerchantsBank, a unit of
Merchant Capital. The award was seen by many bank analysts as
an endorsement of Bank of Boston's health by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp.</p>
<p>Investors have shunned New England banks or sold the
stocks short in the wake of widespread problems related to
the weakening real estate market there. Yesterday's news sent
short sellers into the market to buy stock with which to pay
back their loans, according to Dow Jones Professional
Investor Report.</p>
<p>Homestead Financial jumped 5/8, or more than 31%, to 2
5/8. The company declined to comment on the stock's activity.</p>
<p>Cable television stocks continued to advance. Analysts are
now saying that the industry may escape stringent legislative
regulation. Meanwhile, the industry's annual trade show began
yesterday in Atlanta. Time Warner, which has extensive cable
TV interests, was up 4 to 99 1/4. The stock gained 2 3/4 on
Friday.</p>
<p>Louisiana General Services jumped 3 1/8 to 20 1/4 after
signing a stock swap merger agreement with Citizens
Utilities.</p>
<p>Sotheby's fell 1 to 17 1/2, retracing some of the gains
made last week in advance of its spring series of
impressionist and modern art auctions.</p>
<p>Geico added 2 1/8 to 152 5/8. Yesterday's "Heard on The
Street" column of this newspaper said Wall Street merger
specialists are speculating that investor Warren Buffett
might be preparing to sell his 44% stake in the personal line
insurer. The article gives Geico high marks as an investment,
and says any buyer of the Buffett stake probably would pay a
premium to the market price.</p>
<p>Baltimore Gas & Electric tumbled 1 1/4 to 29. The
company's board failed to raise the quarterly dividend rate
at a meeting on Friday. A Kidder Peabody analyst said the
utility's board usually votes on a dividend increase at its
May meeting.</p>
<p>Monsanto slid 1 1/4 to 100 3/4, after dropping 1/2 on
Friday. The stock came under pressure last week after Goldman
Sachs downgraded its rating on the stock while First Boston
reiterated its "sell" rating. First Boston also cut earnings
estimates for the company. A trader who handled a large sell
order of Monsanto shares yesterday said the stock is still
feeling the repercussions of the analysts' moves.</p>
<p>Technology stocks surged. International Business Machines
rose 1 5/8 to 117, Digital Equipment gained 1 3/8 to 90 5/8,
and Compaq Computer jumped 2 3/4 to 121 3/8. Motorola
advanced 1 1/2 to 78 1/8.</p>
<p>Vishay Intertechnology was up 1 1/4 to 21 3/4. The company
has decided to make a "white knight" offer to acquire
Crystalate Holdings, Vishay's president and chief executive
officer, Felix Zandman, said. Crystalate called for Vishay's
aid in fending off an unsolicited offer by TT Group PLC.</p>
<p>Interest rate-sensitive Federal Home Loan Mortgage added 2
1/4 to 71 3/4, while Federal National Mortgage added 3/4 to
40 1/4 in Big Board trading.</p>
<p>On the American Stock Exchange, Cablevision System Class
A, which rose 2 1/4 points Friday, added 2 1/8 to 28 7/8.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 3.04
to 359.36. Volume totaled 12,360,000 shares.</p>
