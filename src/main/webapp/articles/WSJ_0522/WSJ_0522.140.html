	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Tribune Co., already the operator of the top
prime-time independent television channel in the nation, said
it will launch an 18-hour-a-day cable channel dubbed
Chicagoland on Jan. 1, 1991.
   The company said the news, sports and information channel
would draw on the resources of its locally top-billing
WGN-TV, its nationally top-billing WGN radio and its
Chicago-area leading newspaper, the Chicago Tribune.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Robert J. Gremillion, 35 years old, was named
vice-president and general manager of Chicagoland. Mr.
Gremillion, currently station manager of Tribune's New
Orleans independent WGNO-TV, said Tribune had committed
"several million dollars in capital and operating expenses"
to the project.</p>
<p>Tribune has been pressing expansion into Chicago's growing
suburban market to offset the softening market for
metropolitan daily newspapers. The Chicago Tribune launched a
separate edition for a fast-growing suburban county last year
and Chicagoland will provide "extensive coverage of
surrounding suburban counties," according to James C. Dowdle,
president and chief executive officer of Tribune Broadcasting
Co.</p>
<p>Chicagoland, a term coined and popularized by Tribune's
late chairman and publisher Col. Robert R. McCormick, will
also carry live telecasts of Tribune's baseball franchise,
the Chicago Cubs. Currently, WGN is barred from broadcasting
many games because of agreements with ESPN and CBS.</p>
