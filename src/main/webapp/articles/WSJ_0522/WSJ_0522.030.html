	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration approved
use of a type of live bacteria to treat bladder cancer.
   Manufactured by Connaught Laboratories Ltd., of
Willowdale, Ontario, the drug will be distributed in the U.S.
under the brand name Theracys.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The bacteria, Bacillus Calmette Guerin Live, already are
manufactured by several U.S. companies -- including Quad
Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Indianapolis, and Organon Inc. of
West Orange, N.J. -- for treating tuberculosis. But the drug
also has been found helpful in treating a type of cancer that
affects approximately 10,000 people.</p>
<p>Under the treatment, the bacteria are inserted into the
bladder through a catheter, inflaming the bladder and causing
it to expel cancer cells.</p>
<p>Connaught, a unit of France-based Pasteur Merieux Serums &
Vaccins, is the first company to receive U.S. approval for
this use of the bacteria. Neither Connaught nor its parent is
publicly traded in the U.S.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the company's U.S. distributor, Connaught
Laboratories Inc., of Swiftwater, Pa., said the drug would be
available in approximately three months.</p>
