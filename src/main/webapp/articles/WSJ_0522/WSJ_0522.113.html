	<p class="article-leader">TV Guide, the crown jewel of Rupert Murdoch's magazine
empire, is going on the offensive to protect its franchise.
   Contending with declining circulation, stronger
competition and a tough advertising climate, the nation's
largest weekly magazine is tinkering with its look and
content, and even plans to test a 7-by-10 inch version that
could replace its signature digest size.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mounting troubles at TV Guide, where circulation has
slipped to 15.9 million from its 1978 peak of 20 million,
have spawned persistent rumors that the magazine is on the
block. News Corp., which acquired TV Guide two years ago when
it purchased Triangle Publications Inc. for $3 billion, says
it plans to sell some assets to reduce debt, but it
vehemently denies TV Guide is up for sale.</p>
<p>In an unusual response to a report in yesterday's
Advertising Age that TV Guide is being shopped around, Mr.
Murdoch issued a statement offering to pay Ad Age publisher
Crain Communications Inc. $1 million if the story could be
verified and if Crain could bring forth anyone with whom News
Corp. has had discussions. Otherwise, he said, he expected
Crain to write News Corp. a check for a similar amount.
Spokesmen for Crain couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Joseph Cece, TV Guide's president and publisher, says
losses in ad pages and circulation are being offset by higher
advertising rates and an increased cover price of 75 cents.
"We are still the most profitable magazine in the industry,"
he says.</p>
<p>But changes are in the works. By the end of the year, Mr.
Cece says, TV Guide will test market the larger-size
prototype. To compete with guides produced directly for local
cable operators, TV Guide is expanding its production of
cable system-specific editions. And the magazine is pushing
advertising packages based on themed issues such as sports
and program awards.</p>
<p>On the editorial front, TV Guide says it will step up
serious "watchdog" television reportage, which News Corp. had
de-emphasized after the acquisition in favor of more
celebrity-oriented coverage. Deadlines for covers have been
cut from about 40 days to about 14 days, allowing TV Guide to
compete for stories with other weeklies such as Time and
Newsweek. "The deadlines now allow us to be timely and hot,
such as when a show or star is peaking," says Joe Robinowitz,
editor of TV Guide's national section. "We have to be in sync
with America's interests."</p>
<p>One of the biggest of those interests is cable television,
which now reaches more than 55% of U.S. television
households. Top executives of Murdoch Magazines are at the
National Cable Television Association annual convention in
Atlanta today to display research showing that TV Guide --
not newspaper listings or magazines distributed by cable
operators to their subscribers -- is what viewers reach for
when they head toward the TV set.</p>
<p>At the cable show, TV Guide will have to share the
limelight with a persistent and growing competitor: TVSM
Inc., publisher of the monthly Cable Guide magazine. TVSM
executives held their own news conference yesterday to
announce they will combine the recently acquired TV
Entertainment magazine with the Cable Guide to create a
single magazine with a circulation totaling at least 9.5
million. Distributed almost entirely through cable system
operators, the new edition of Cable Guide will appear in
October in a full-size format rather than its current digest
size.</p>
<p>TVSM also is attacking Mr. Murdoch's franchise on its own
turf, publishing a weekly TV listing magazine called TV Time.
Currently being tested in markets in California and Arizona,
TV Time will be rolled out to cable systems around the
country beginning in late 1990, according to TVSM Chairman
Mark Edmiston.</p>
<p>TVSM's TV Time and Cable Guide pioneered the production of
system-specific editions, which provide readers a road map to
the exploding number of local broadcast and cable channels,
and not just the nationally distributed cable networks. TV
Guide is playing catch-up, only recently offering
system-specific editions on a limited basis at the urging of
cable operators, many of whom offer guide subscriptions to
their customers.</p>
<p>In Phoenix, Ariz., TV Guide lost out to TVSM's TV Time for
distribution through the Times Mirror Co.'s Dimension Cable
Services system. But in Seattle, TV Guide won the contract to
be distributed to subscribers to the three Viacom Inc.
systems serving the Seattle-Tacoma area.</p>
<p>"We told TV Guide we needed more specific listings and
space to list pay-per-view, and they came back with
customized editions," says Seth Morrison, Viacom's director
of marketing. "It shows Cece and TV Guide are meeting needs
in the cable industry."</p>
<p>But TVSM is preparing TV Time for markets everywhere, and
Viacom's Mr. Morrison says that once the TV Guide contract is
up, he'll have to consider what TVSM has to offer. "The key
for us is a comprehensive weekly listing," he says. "We'll be
open to anyone offering a good service at a good price."</p>
<p>Whatever heat TV Guide feels from competitors, it is still
the leading TV magazine and one of the most widely read
magazines anywhere. But the major advertising downturn that
has battered the entire magazine industry is now only
exasperating downward trends at the magazine. Advertising
pages in 1986 totaled 3,566; as of 1989, ad pages had fallen
9% to 3,255.</p>
<p>TV Guide executives claim part of the page drop stems from
a decision in early 1989 to terminate a barter agreement with
TV stations that allowed them to promote shows in free ads.
But as of the first quarter of 1990, the bad news continued:
Ad pages dropped 10.1% from the same period in 1989.
Advertising pages for one of TV Guide's major categories,
cigarette advertising, is expected to drop 30% in 1990,
according to Mr. Cece.</p>
<p>When News Corp. bought TV Guide, executives at Murdoch
Magazines envisioned that the magazine, because of its mass
audience, could be attractively packaged with Murdoch's other
magazines for national advertisers. But because of TV Guide's
odd page size and its relatively high ad page rate -- about
$113,000 -- Murdoch executives admit the idea has fizzled.
"We are too different from other Murdoch magazines," says Mr.
Cece.</p>
<p>The Murdoch empire includes movie magazine Premiere, New
Woman, European Travel & Life, and Automobile. "Cross media
buys are much easier said than done," says Leslie Hinton,
president of Murdoch Magazines.</p>
<p>Instead, TV Guide is focusing on offering multi-issue
packages that target particular groups of readers. A sports
package offers ad pages in TV Guide's Super Bowl and World
Series issues; a family package offers ad pages in the Fall
Preview and children's programming issue. Rather than
discount ad rates, a common practice in pre-Murdoch days, TV
Guide is letting advertisers run a free page of coupons in
the magazine for a minimum number of ad pages purchased.</p>
<p>News Corp. is also pushing links between TV Guide and the
company's increasingly successful Fox television network. Mr.
Cece said TV Guide is about to sign its first contract with a
major advertiser for pages in the magazine and commercial
time on the network. He declined to identify the advertiser,
but said other such deals are in the works.</p>
<p>If advertisers haven't come running in droves, they are at
least impressed by the efforts of TV Guide's new regime. Ad
packages and cable specific editions are "all for reader
value, and that can translate into value to the advertisers,"
says Patricia Donnelly, vice president at ad agency Young &
Rubicam.</p>
<p>TV Guide has continued to fiddle with its editorial
content, adding an astrology column and a soap opera column
since the purchase by News Corp. The magazine continues to
favor celebrities for its covers, but increasingly is
returning to the kind of inside stories it carried in the
pre-Murdoch era; recent ones included "TV in Cuba," and "TV
Relives the Fall of Saigon."</p>
<p>Some observers question whether editorial content makes as
much difference in the current competitive climate. "What the
consumer wants is information on what's on what channel at
what time, period," says Charles Elbaum, president of
Publishing Economics Inc., an industry consultant in New
York. "Most of the readership can go elsewhere for the
celebrity interviews that are in TV Guide."</p>
<p>The decision on whether to change the size and format of
TV Guide won't be an easy one. Murdoch executives say a
larger format would allow the magazine to be more creative
graphically and might make the magazine easier to read. But
Mr. Cece says a larger format would definitely mean an
increase in cover price and the annual subscription rate, a
move that would almost certainly result in losses of paid
circulation. In 1988, when TV Guide raised its cover price to
75 cents from 60 cents, circulation fell off quickly.</p>
<p>"Moving to a larger format could be a disaster," says Mr.
Elbaum, the publishing consultant. "TV Guide built its
franchise on its style and format and to go away from that,
they might as well start from scratch. Customer confusion
could be significant."</p>
