	<p class="article-leader">Novell Inc. confirmed today that big stockholders derailed
its proposed merger with Lotus Development Corp.
   Stock in Novell, based in Provo, Utah, rose sharply to
$42, up $1.875, in heavy national over-the-counter trading.
Shares in Lotus Development, based in Cambridge, Mass., fell
$1 apiece to $33.75, also in heavy over-the-counter trading.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Raymond Noorda, Novell's chairman, said he believed the
two companies, which both make software for personal
computers, would have made a good match, but that the deal
fell through when Lotus rejected a plea to give Novell equal
representation on the board of the combined company.</p>
<p>Though Mr. Noorda stressed that he believes the software
industry is entering a period of consolidation, he said he
wasn't shopping the company around. "We're not looking for
merger partners at this time," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Noorda also said that despite the collapse of the deal
with Lotus, he expects the two companies to cooperate on a
range of business activities. "Some positive things will
happen between the two companies," he said.</p>
