	<p class="article-leader">Utility and technology shares led the over-the-counter
market in a climb slightly brisker than the record-setting
Dow Jones industrials.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 4.58 to 452.89, a 1.02%
advance, slightly outpacing the 0.9% move in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average. The Nasdaq utility index jumped 2.23% and
the Nasdaq 100 index of larger industrial issues, including
large technology companies, added 1.62%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Volume remained active at 169.6 million shares, though
down from 191.4 million Friday, which was the busiest this
year. Advancing shares again outpaced decliners, 1,138 to
820, as 195 stocks rose to new highs, more than triple
yesterday's new lows.</p>
<p>"People are trying to get in on this move," said Robert C.
King, head of OTC trading in Atlanta for Robinson Humphrey.
The skeptical Mr. King said he continues to be surprised by
the strength of the Dow industrials, adding that he doesn't
expect the market to go much higher. OTC stock investing was
"solid, not frenzied," he said.</p>
<p>William Rothe, managing director of OTC trading at Alex.
Brown & Sons in Baltimore, said he thinks "all the players
are cautious. I think they'd pull back in a minute if adverse
news came out."</p>
<p>Cable television shares gained favor as the industry
gathered this week in Atlanta for the National Cable
Television Association convention. Speculation that
regulatory threats will fade also circulated after this
newspaper reported yesterday that moves to slap strict new
regulations on the industry are losing momentum.</p>
<p>Topping the day's most active list were
Tele-Communications class A shares, up 1 1/8 at 15 7/8 on 4.1
million shares. Other cable gainers included Comcast class A
shares, which rose 1 1/4 at 14 5/8, and American Television &
Communications, which climbed 1 1/8 to 38 1/4.</p>
<p>As expected, shares of Lotus, Novell and Microsoft were
among the day's most active after merger discussions between
Lotus and Novell collapsed Friday, eliminating a potential
challenge to Microsoft's dominance of the software market.
Lotus fell 1 to 33 3/4 on 3 million shares; Novell gained 1
7/8 to 42 on 2.9 million shares, amid speculation other
buyers might surface for the Provo, Utah, company. Microsoft,
due to unveil its long-awaited Windows 3.0 software today,
added 2 to 70 1/4 on 2.2 million shares.</p>
<p>Merger and acquisition news continued to fuel some stock
gains: Talman Home Federal Savings & Loan Association rose 1
to 6 7/8; Qume added 1/2 to 6 1/2 and Applebee's
International jumped 1 3/4 to 18 1/2.</p>
<p>Talman Home Federal, a Chicago thrift, said it accepted an
investor group's $10-a-share acquisition offer. Shareholders
will receive $5 a share in cash and a senior subordinated
debenture of a new holding to be called Talman Bancorp Inc.</p>
<p>Qume, a Milpitas, Calif., maker of IBM-compatible
products, announced a merger with an investor group led by
the company's chairman and chief executive officer, David
Lee, and Wearnes Technology of Singapore. The agreement is
valued at $7.25 a share. The company said it may also seek
other offers, subject to the payment of a breakup fee to the
investor group. Qume also reported net income for the fourth
quarter ended Feb. 28 fell to seven cents a share, including
extraordinary items, from 17 cents a year earlier.</p>
<p>Applebee, a Kansas City operator of franchised
restaurants, said it has received unsolicited acquisition
inquiries. Applebee, which hired Piper Jaffray & Hopwood to
evaluate its long-term strategy, said no merger or sale talks
currently are under way.</p>
<p>Wholesale Club climbed 2 to 22 3/8 after the Indianapolis
wholesaler and distributor of general merchandise said it
earned 10 cents a share in the first quarter ended May 5,
compared to a year-earlier loss of 15 cents a share.</p>
<p>Shares of two biotechnology companies, Amgen, of Thousand
Oaks, Calif., and Cytogen, of Princeton, N.J., continued to
climb on speculation that products developed by the companies
will be favorably reviewed at this week's meeting in
Washington of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.</p>
<p>Clinical trials of Neupogen, Amgen's product that
stimulates white blood cells, were reviewed yesterday. Amgen
leaped 3 3/4 to 73.</p>
<p>Studies of a Cytogen imaging agent used to detect
colorectal cancer are scheduled for review today. Cytogen
gained 3/4 to 8 3/8.</p>
<p>Synergen tumbled 1 5/8 to 11 after the Boulder, Colo.,
drug company announced Friday that the Swiss pharmaceutical
giant, Hoffman-La Roche, will no longer support Synergen's
research on IL-1ra, a product to treat inflammatory diseases
such as arthritis. Synergen said it doesn't expect the loss
of Hoffman-La Roche's support to hurt its development
schedule for the product and added that it hopes to begin
clinical trials later this year.</p>
<p>General Parametrics lost 1/8 to 2 after the Berkeley,
Calif., maker of computer graphics products suspended its
quarterly dividend because of lower second-quarter sales.
General Parametrics also reported a loss for the second
quarter ended April 30 of nine cents a share, compared with
net income of seven cents a year earlier. The company told
investors two weeks ago that it expected to report its first
quarterly loss since going public in 1986.</p>
<p>Stanford Telecommunications slid 1 to 6. Friday, the Santa
Clara, Calif., communications concern reported a loss for the
fourth quarter ended March 31 of 31 cents a share, compared
with year-earlier net income of 10 cents a share.</p>
