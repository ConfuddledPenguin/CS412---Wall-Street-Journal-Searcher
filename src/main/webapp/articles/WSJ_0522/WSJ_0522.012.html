	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Nervous about the volatile stock market and
fed up with the languishing price of gold?
   Get off your duff and start your own business on the side.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Buy and sell mortgages. Persuade your friends and
relatives to join a discount buying service. Buy foreclosed
properties. Rehabilitate and sell old homes.</p>
<p>And protect your assets from lawsuits by setting up a
"family trust" on the Isle of Man, a tax haven in the Irish
Sea. The cost: $18,000.</p>
<p>That's some of the advice 1,500 investors heard here last
week at Howard Ruff's 1990 national convention, entitled "How
to Grow Rich Before You Grow Old." Mr. Ruff, the newsletter
editor and former goldbug, holds one of the largest annual
conferences for individual investors.</p>
<p>But those recommendations are open to plenty of skepticism
from professionals in real estate and money management. They
think many of the part-time business suggestions take too
much time and work and are too risky for retirees and other
individual investors.</p>
<p>"If the pros are getting hurt, individuals should be leery
of getting into real estate on a part-time basis now," says
Harry D. Hartnett, director of research at Kenneth Leventhal
& Co., an accounting firm that specializes in real estate.</p>
<p>As for the foreign trust on the Isle of Man, Michael
Stolper, a San Diego consultant who selects money managers
for wealthy clients, says the device may make it harder for
people to collect on a lawsuit. But it won't guarantee that a
judgment won't be paid, he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Ruff built up a large following in the early 1970s,
advising people to buy gold and stockpile food in order to
survive the approaching hard times. His book, "How to Prosper
in the Coming Bad Years," was a best seller, and
subscriptions to his Ruff Times newsletter soared. But the
bad times never came, and more recently Mr. Ruff has been
mostly out of the limelight.</p>
<p>Today, he publishes six newsletters and has a middle-class
constituency to whom he sells an ever-expanding number of
services and products. Those with a $1,500 lifetime
subscription to Ruff Times got into last week's conference
free. Others forked over $350 ($450 for a couple) to listen
to Mr. Ruff's entrepreneurial ideas, as well as other
speakers' thoughts on stocks, gold, coins, mutual funds,
options, politics, living trusts and asset protection.</p>
<p>Mr. Ruff left no doubt where he sees the most promise. "No
one ever made any real money following the advice of
financial newsletters," he says. "Today we are moving to
liquid stock markets that are impossible for the individual
investor to guess." As for gold, Mr. Ruff says he's a "bear."</p>
<p>With the part-time businesses, however, "people can
control their income instead of investing in something they
can't control, like the stock market or the price of gold."</p>
<p>Mr. Ruff's Jefferson Institute in Springville, Utah,
offers several courses in how to start these various
businesses. Fees run as high as $5,000 to $6,500 for three to
five days of training. The institute, Mr. Ruff says, is his
main profit center.</p>
<p>Buying and selling mortgages "at a discount" will be one
of the major business opportunities for individual investors
in the 1990s, he says. This works most often when a person
has sold a home and has to take back a second mortgage from
the buyer. Often the person would rather have cash than a
second mortgage. An individual investor can step in and offer
to buy the loan for cash at a discount. Then, depending on
negotiating skills, the investor can sell the loan to someone
else, pocketing the difference.</p>
<p>John Eichel, real estate analyst for Bailard Biehl &
Kaiser, a San Mateo, Calif., money-management firm, says he
thinks the process is "too complicated" for the average
individual investor and has too many downside risks. "I
wouldn't do this unless I was a real estate broker or
attorney," he says. "It takes a tremendous amount of time and
work to check out the people who hold the loan, the property
it's secured by, and make the other due diligence checks." He
adds: "Nothing is as easy as they make it sound."</p>
<p>Many people at the conference seemed to realize that sales
pitches were interspersed among the financial advice. "After
attending a session, you come out saying, `This is it. This
is the thing for me,'" says a businessman from Yreka, Calif.,
who declined to give his name. "But you've got to remember,
these speakers are super salesmen. You have to keep a hold on
your wallet."</p>
