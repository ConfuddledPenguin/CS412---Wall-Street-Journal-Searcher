	<p class="article-leader">DAVID N. MARTIN agreed in principle to become chairman of
Fahlgren & Swink, a Parkersburg, W. Va.-based ad unit of
Lintas:USA. He will continue as chairman of Hawley Martin
Partners, which last week agreed to be acquired by Lintas.
Yesterday's advertising column incorrectly reported that
Hawley Martin and Fahlgren & Swink were merging and misstated
the headquarters for Fahlgren & Swink. The story also
incorrectly identified Cincinnati Bell as a client of
Fahlgren & Swink.
