	<p class="article-leader">International Business Machines Corp. will soon cut prices
on a wide range of its personal computer products, including
its popular Model 55SX, industry executives said. The Armonk,
N.Y.-based company also will unveil a personal computer
without a disk drive to its lineup, though not until autumn,
they said.
   IBM declined to comment on the price cuts, first reported
in PC Week, an industry weekly, as was the diskless computer.
But the executives said the cuts, which they didn't quantify,
will apply to most of IBM's PC lineup, except for products
unveiled recently: four versions of the high-end Model 80; an
entry-level version of the portable Model P70; two versions
of the Model 65SX; the education-oriented Model 25 286; and
several new peripherals.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Regarding the diskless computer for use as part of a
computer network, an IBM spokeswoman noted that James
Cannavino, the executive who heads the personal systems
business, said last fall that IBM will produce such a machine
before the end of 1990. But she wouldn't specify a timetable
for the product.</p>
