	<p class="article-leader">BOYNE CITY, Mich. -- About 140 people clutching paper Ace
Hardware bags are gathered around a police car parked in the
woods. Suddenly, the siren wails and the crowd scatters. Stan
Boris, an imposing 220-pounder with a Smith Brothers beard,
sprints down a dirt road like Carl Lewis.
   After a couple of hundred yards, the 38-year-old woodsman
veers off and heads up a steep hill. He spots his prey and
begins flinging it into his bag. "One, two, three, four," Mr.
Boris calls out. "Come on, mushrooms]"</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Boris is competing in the National Mushroom Hunting
Championship, a contest he has won 10 times. He is looking
for mushrooms, but not just any mushrooms. And obviously, he
has a knack for spotting fungus on the cluttered forest
floor.</p>
<p>This contest, now 30 years old, is but part of the morel
madness that grips Michigan's north woods each May. The
little town of Mesick, home of the Mushroom Bar and the
Mushroom Cap Motel, has an annual parade and crowns Miss
Mesick Mushroom.</p>
<p>"Welcome Fungus Finders," says the sign at the Veterans of
Foreign Wars post here in Boyne City. As many as half a
million people go mushrooming in the Wolverine state. Surely,
this must rival the mushroom hunters in Southwestern France
who have been known to call in sick so they can go out
hunting cepes.</p>
<p>The morel of this story (the word actually is pronounced
mo-REL, and the thing itself looks like a sponge on a stalk)
has a nutty (some say meat-like) taste that a fancy
restaurant might gladly pay $25 a pound for. Morels are a
versatile delicacy. They can be marinated, fried or sauteed.
They are good in soups, stuffings, omelets. If you like
morels. This year's special "Mushroom Edition" of the
Charlevoix County Press here says you can even serve them
with ice cream: Ergo, a recipe for a morel sundae.</p>
<p>Morels are hard to come by, though they tend to grow wild
at the base of certain trees. Some years, when the weather
isn't warm and moist, just a few of them will appear. But
when conditions are right, morels are bountiful, popping up
here and there, seemingly overnight. "They fly out of the
ground," says Gerald Boron, a member of the mushroom-hunting
club in Lewiston, Mich., which has 130 members and a waiting
list to get in.</p>
<p>Every May, a caravan led by a fire engine rolls through
Boyne City to kick off the national championship. Contestants
go to a secret location picked by the Boyne Valley Lions
Club, which runs the contest.</p>
<p>The two-day championship -- one is tempted to say
champignonship -- has separate categories for men and women,
residents and nonresidents, and a grand champion category for
repeat winners. The top prize is just $125, but there is also
a heap of local prestige to be had.</p>
<p>The contest allows pickers to count both true morels and a
cousin, known as "early morels." Eating them makes some
people sick.</p>
<p>Several pickers have won more than once, but nobody
approaches Mr. Boris, who, at the age of 15, first won in
1967. Indeed, Mr. Boris has been so dominant that rumors
recur that he stashes mushrooms in the woods or has
confederates who contribute to his harvest. Such talk riles
Mr. Boris, who lives in the town of Charlevoix. "I guess
anytime somebody's better than somebody else, people are
going to wonder how you do it," he says.</p>
<p>On the first day of the 1990 competition, Mr. Boris took
the lead, with 103 mushrooms, two more than anyone else and
dozens more than most pickers. As an eyewitness can attest,
Mr. Boris picked every one himself, often finding caches of
morels that others passed right by.</p>
<p>Like all top pickers, Mr. Boris can spot a mushroom at 30
feet that is barely peeking through a bed of leaves. "I don't
look at my feet," he explains as he crashes through brush.
"That's why I fall a lot."</p>
<p>Mr. Boris faltered the second day of the contest. He found
but two mushrooms and lost by just one morel in the resident
men's competition. (His son Aaron fared better in a different
category. A member of his high-school track team, Aaron
covers ground quickly. He snapped up 26 mushrooms on the
second day. His two-day total of 92 won him first prize.)</p>
<p>Michigan makes the most of its morels, but the mushrooms
are found elsewhere in North America, and other states have
their own festivals. Washington has its mycological
societies. The morel is the official mushroom of Minnesota.</p>
<p>Most morels sold in stores and restaurants in this country
have lately come from the Pacific Northwest. The Michigan
harvest is unreliable because the weather doesn't always
cooperate. "We really cannot depend on the local morel,"
laments Milos Cihelka, chef and partner in the Golden
Mushroom restaurant in suburban Detroit, which buys 3,000
pounds of morels a year. It's a pity, he says, because
"Michigan morels taste sweeter, better than the West Coast
morels."</p>
<p>A skilled picker can make a fast buck. John Bearden, who
lives in East Jordan, Mich., has earned as much as $4,500 in
a fecund month. "We pay our taxes out of it every year," says
the 46-year-old Mr. Bearden. "The kids usually get a bike."
Mr. Bearden, who works in an auto-parts factory, does his
hunting after work and from "daylight to dark" on weekends,
he says. He drops 10 or 15 pounds every May from all the
walking.</p>
<p>Expert pickers head for certain trees to find what they
are looking for. Mr. Bearden, for example, scans the base of
ash trees for white morels. Morels were prolific in the
Midwest during the epidemic of Dutch elm disease, beginning
in the 1960s. For reasons not fully understood, the mushrooms
flourish when the bark falls off a dead elm.</p>
<p>Certain natural disturbances are also a boon to the morel.
Pickers in Oregon have reaped monster harvests in areas that
have been devastated by forest fires or that have recently
been logged. "A veritable morel garden" was reported after
Mount St. Helens erupted in 1980, according to the book "A
Morel Hunter's Companion."</p>
<p>People tried unsuccessfully for many years to cultivate
morels commercially. The feat was finally achieved in the
mid-'80s by Neogen Corp., a small Michigan company, which
developed a technology for duplicating the wild environment
of the morel. The key was recreating certain air flows,
temperatures and soil conditions that cause the fungus to
fruit.</p>
<p>A subsidiary of Domino's Pizza Inc. was licensed to use
the Neogen system in North America. The concern, Morel
Mountain Co., produced its first commercial crop, 100 pounds
in all, just a few weeks ago. Within four to five months,
Morel Mountain predicts, production will reach 2,000 pounds a
week. But morels are a bit upscale for Domino's, which has no
plans to put them on pizzas; the crop will be sold to
specialty stores and restaurants.</p>
<p>And don't expect morels to put the prosaic supermarket
mushroom out of business. Many people find the nut-like
flavor just a bit too strong, and prefer the common
cultivated variety you can grow in a dark closet. "I enjoy
getting out in the woods and picking morels, but I just don't
particularly care to eat them," says Todd Sorenson, a Boyne
Valley Lions Club member who helped select the site for the
national championship. "If I want mushrooms, I go down to the
store."</p>
