	<p class="article-leader">AMERICAN TELEPHONE & TELEGRAPH Co. (New York) -- Standard
& Poor's Corp. said it affirmed its ratings on $11.1 billion
of debt issued by this telecommunications concern and two of
its units. The rating concern affirmed its double-A rating on
AT&T's senior unsecured debt, which accounted for most of the
$11.1 billion, and single-A-1-plus on commercial paper; and
single-A-1-plus on commercial paper issued by AT&T Capital
Corp. and AT&T Credit Corp. S&P's move came almost a month
after Moody's Investors Service Inc. upgraded its rating on
$9.2 billion of AT&T's senior debt to double-A-3 from
single-A-1. Even after the upgrade, Moody's rating on AT&T's
senior debt remains slightly lower than S&P's, which has held
steady at double-A since it was downgraded because of the
1984 breakup of the Bell System; before the breakup, S&P
rated AT&T triple-A. In its affirmation, which came after an
annual review, S&P said financial support for AT&T's credit
is expected to strengthen in the near term to mid-term, as
earnings and cash flow improve. But it also noted that
leverage has increased in the past two years, and that
further investments in the financial sector may weaken AT&T's
balance sheet in the near term.

	<div class="article-body"><p>GRUMMAN Corp. -- Standard & Poor's Corp. lowered its
ratings on about $510 million of this Bethpage, N.Y.,
concern's senior debt and preferred stock. The ratings firm
reduced its rating on senior debt to triple-B-minus from
triple-B and on subordinated debt and preferred stock to
double-B-plus from triple-B-minus. S&P said the downgrades
reflect "Grumman's weakening competitive position and
continued fairly aggressive debt usage within the context of
deteriorating overall defense industry demand prospects."
Grumman, principally a manufacturer of military aircraft,
declined to comment. S&P said there is "increasing pressure
on Grumman to secure new defense-electronics and
aircraft-remanufacturing business to bolster future
performance. This will become increasingly difficult in a
period of declining military procurement."</p>

<p>STORAGE TECHNOLOGY Corp. -- Moody's Investors Service Inc.
said it raised the rating on the Louisville, Colo., company's
13.5% senior debentures to Ba2 from Ba3, affecting about $243
million in debt. The rating concern said it believes the
maker of data-storage devices will report improved results
from sales of its automated cartridge library systems, which
allow dozens of tape cartridges to be accessed quickly.</p>

<p>UNISYS Corp. -- Standard & Poors Corp. said it affirmed
its ratings on approximately $4.9 billion of this company's
debt and preferred stock, including its triple-B rating on
senior debt. S&P said the Blue Bell, Pa., computer maker has
experienced an erosion of its balance sheet, but that recent
restructurings should return the company to profitability in
the near term. Still, S&P noted, Unisys's debt-to-capital is
high and its future is uncertain. For those reasons, S&P
said, there is a potential for ratings downgrades.</p>
