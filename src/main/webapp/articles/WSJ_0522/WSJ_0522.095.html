	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Investors, concluding that interest rates have
stabilized for the time being, pushed stock prices higher but
nudged bonds up only a little.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 24.77 points to a
record 2844.68 in active trading. Long-term bond prices rose
an eighth of a point, or $1.25 for each $1,000 of face
amount. The dollar ended mostly higher after profit-taking
trimmed gains made during the morning.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts said investors' fears of higher interest rates
and inflation seem to have abated in the past few days. "We
think interest rates have peaked, and the market suspects the
same thing," said James Solloway, chief economist at Argus
Research. Among other things, lower bond yields makes stocks
more attractive.</p>
<p>Mr. Solloway said he expects bond yields to fall to 8% or
lower by September, which should benefit such interest-rate
sensitive businesses as well-run thrifts and utilities,
including the regional Bell operating companies.</p>
<p>The perception that inflation is less of a problem was
helped by expectations for two economic reports this week.
The first, on Thursday, is predicted to show a weaker
first-quarter economy than first indicated. The second, on
Friday, is expected to show a slowdown in the growth of
personal income last month from March.</p>
<p>Leading the stock market higher yesterday were technology
issues -- viewed as undervalued and poised for new growth --
and consumer stocks, which tend to do better when inflation
slows.</p>
<p>The rally took a while to get started. Stocks opened
unenthusiastically because bond prices were down somewhat.
"When bond prices got even and started moving ahead a little
bit, stocks overreacted, and that seemed to give the green
light to institutional money managers," said A.C. Moore,
research director at Argus.</p>
<p>Bond prices retreated in the morning because of a rumor
that the federal budget surplus in April, the prime
tax-collection month, was smaller than forecast. The surplus
actually turned out higher than expected, but the news failed
to spark more than a mild move higher.</p>
<p>The rebound in stocks also was helped by the dollar's
solid gains against the mark early in the day. Peter Canelo,
chief market strategist at Bear Stearns, suggested investors
may be starting to pay a little less attention to bonds and
more to the dollar.</p>
<p>"The dollar appears to be coming back from lows in the
past few days," Mr. Canelo said, "and that should help bonds,
but stocks already are responding favorably." Stocks held
most of their gains even after profit-taking trimmed the
dollar's advance.</p>
<p>In major market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices rose in active trading. Volume rose to 166.3
million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, where
advancing issues swamped decliners 997 to 538.</p>
<p>Bond prices gained slightly. The yield on the Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bond dipped to 8.68%.</p>
<p>The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.6626 marks and 153.72 yen, compared
with 1.6477 marks and 153 yen Friday. But the dollar fell
against the British pound.</p>
