	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- As the Senate prepares to consider a
proposed ban on domestic manufacture of military-style
assault weapons for civilian use, one senator is
conspicuously silent amid the debate: Majority Leader George
Mitchell.
   As is usually the case in gun-control debates, the
proposed assault-gun ban generally is dividing Congress along
regional and partisan lines. Democrats from the Northeast and
Midwest -- including Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman
Joseph Biden of Delaware and Sen. Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio
-- support a ban; they cite use of such weapons by drug
traffickers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Republicans from the West and South -- such as Sen. Strom
Thurmond of South Carolina -- side with the National Rifle
Association and other gun-lobby groups in opposing the ban;
they argue that the term "assault weapon" is poorly defined
in the legislation.</p>
<p>But these dividing lines are far from absolute. The
assault-weapon legislation was drafted by Sen. Dennis
DeConcini (D., Ariz.), a longstanding NRA supporter from the
Southwest. Sen. DeConcini says he acted only after failing to
get the NRA to draft language it could accept on the issue.</p>
<p>Then there's Sen. Mitchell. The assault-weapon issue puts
the Maine Democrat in an especially awkward bind. As majority
leader, he helped Sen. Biden move the larger crime bill,
which includes the proposed assault-gun ban, through the
slow-moving Senate. But as a legislator who represents a
considerable number of Maine sportsmen, he once boasted to
constituents that he had a "perfect voting record on issues
of concern to the NRA" until he voted to ban plastic guns in
1987.</p>
<p>Sen. Mitchell's position on the assault-gun ban is
something of a mystery. According to spokeswoman Diane
Dewhirst, the majority leader hasn't issued any statements
either on Sen. DeConcini's proposal or on a more restrictive
ban proposed by Sen. Metzenbaum. (Despite repeated efforts
yesterday to reach him, Sen. Mitchell himself wasn't
available for comment.)</p>
<p>Neither Sen. DeConcini nor Sen. Metzenbaum seems unhappy
about this apparent neglect. Indeed, both praise the majority
leader for assisting their efforts. Sen. DeConcini says he's
grateful Sen. Mitchell got the crime bill to the floor; Sen.
Metzenbaum says Sen. Mitchell will bring the Ohio senator's
more restrictive proposal to the Senate floor as an
amendment.</p>
<p>But neither senator is able to guess how Sen. Mitchell
will vote on the gun issue. "I don't know where he stands,"
says Sen. DeConcini. "I'm not sure how he's going to vote,"
offers Sen. Metzenbaum. The gun lobby is similarly in the
dark. "I don't think the senator has made up his mind,"
offers NRA lobbyist James Baker. "How Sen. Mitchell comes
down is not something that I can predict."</p>
<p>Mr. Baker said he hadn't personally lobbied Sen. Mitchell
on the issue, but added: "I can assure you that Sportsman's
Alliance of Maine has." According to Mr. Baker, that group is
"adamantly opposed" to the assault-weapon ban. Spokesmen for
the group, based in Augusta, couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Gail Hoffman, legislative director for Handgun Control
Inc., a group that lobbies for gun control, says she spoke to
Sen. Mitchell in January about the assault-weapons ban. "I
think he found things that we had to say interesting," she
says. "But he was very noncommittal."</p>
<p>One reason for Sen. Mitchell's silence may be genuine
ambivalence. "I don't believe in gun control," Sen. Mitchell
told the Calais, Maine, Advertiser during a 1988 campaign
swing.</p>
<p>But after the senator failed to support the NRA on plastic
guns in 1987, the NRA sent out a mailing to its members in
Maine saying Mr. Mitchell had been fooled by a "media lie" on
plastic guns. The charge angered Mr. Mitchell, who told the
Maine newspaper that the NRA had made him a target of a
"campaign of misinformation."</p>
<p>Then again, Sen. Mitchell's silence may just be the latest
demonstration that discretion is the better part of valor.
"Mitchell is not buffaloed by them more than anyone else is,"
says Sen. DeConcini, "but you don't just blow the NRA away as
some kind of kooks or something."</p>
