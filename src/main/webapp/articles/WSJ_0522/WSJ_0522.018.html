	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Whittaker Corp. said it has commitments
from several banks for a new, $140 million credit facility to
replace debt remaining from a recapitalization it implemented
last June.
   Whittaker, a maker of high-technology equipment, said the
new facility gives the company the choice of borrowing at
prime or other rates if they are more favorable. The facility
should be in place within 30 days, Whittaker said. Security
Pacific National Bank, based here, is the lead bank.</p>
