	<p class="article-leader">California is trying to wing it, and the airline
industry's feathers are ruffled.
   Some Sacramento legislators, fed up with sky-high
intrastate air fares, are piloting a bill to create a
state-owned airline called Golden State Air. Opponents,
though, have a less flattering name for the carrier:
Califlot.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The bill should send taxpayers flying into a rage, says
Roger Cohen of the Washington-based Air Transport
Association. The airline industry trade group figures that
even a small fleet of 10 leased aircraft would cost $60
million.</p>
<p>That's enough, Mr. Cohen volunteers somewhat gratuitously,
to fly all 120 state legislators "round trip, at the
highest-cost fare, between Sacramento and Los Angeles, every
day, 365 days a year, until the year 2000."</p>
<p>While the ATA is officially neutral on the bill -- it
doesn't want to appear to be discouraging competition --
airline executives laugh up their sleeves about it. Mr.
Cohen, who says he's worn "a continual smile on my face since
this thing came up," even ordered from promoters a T-shirt
with a cartoon of the state animal soaring through West Coast
skies; the caption: "Smash the Fare] Ride the Bear."</p>
<p>Taken as a joke early on, the state airline proposal
surprised many by easily clearing the senate appropriations
committee yesterday and winging toward the senate floor.
"We've touched the hearts of a new American feeling about how
uncompetitive the markets really are," says the bill's
sponsor, Sen. Art Torres, (D., Los Angeles). California skies
are dominated by USAir, American, United and Delta, all of
which have raised fares sharply in the few years since the
takeover of Pacific Southwest Airlines (by USAir) and AirCal
(by American).</p>
<p>Sen. Torres, who sees Golden State Air as no more
socialistic than a public bus company, says travelers have
been outraged since the disappearance of the $99 San
Francisco-Los Angeles round-trip fares that PSA and AirCal
used to offer. While discount tickets are available at $145,
full fare is now $372.</p>
<p>But Golden State Air is still a long way from takeoff.
Even Sen. Ed Davis (R., Northridge) -- a harsh airline critic
who remembers PSA and AirCal as "elegant, superlative and fun
to ride on" -- says he'd never vote for a state airline. "The
worst private airline is still better than the best state-run
one," he says. "It would be just as efficient as state-run
government."</p>
