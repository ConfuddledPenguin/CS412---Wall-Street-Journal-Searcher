	<p class="article-leader">Hours after an Israeli gunman went mad and mowed down a
group of Arabs on Sunday, human-rights activists and American
commentators publicly charged the government of Israel with
"responsibility for and complicity with the killings of
Palestinians." Why? The Israeli government had already
arrested the disturbed man and already begun to investigate
the matter. Because, as one commentator said, "Israel has
encouraged this by creating a climate of hate and violence."
Some Palestinian leaders went further: They charged that the
killings were a premeditated act of murder by Israel. The
American media uncritically repeated these charges. The U.N.
will likely convene in the next few days to ram through a
resolution accusing Israel.
   The attack on Israel is part of a trend. Lately, American
journalists, commentators, and political activists with
ideological agendas have begun ascribing collective national
guilt as the culprit for acts of violence carried out in
society. In fact, a more honest test of a society's values
and conscience would be to examine how it reacts to such
violence. Does it act swiftly to condemn the violence? Does
it ignore it? Or does it revel in the violence? The Sunday
murders are a case in point. They provide a critical basis to
examine how Arab society (and the U.S. media) reacted to
similar acts of violence against Jews.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In Israel, there was instant, unanimous condemnation of
the killings. Within minutes after news of the killings was
broadcast, Israeli leaders -- from the entire political
spectrum -- bitterly condemned the killings and expressed
their sympathies to the Palestinians. There was no
equivocation or excuses. Israeli citizens expressed their
shock, horror and revulsion at the killings. The Israeli
reaction was similar to the massive demonstration of 400,000
that came in response to the Phalangist massacre of
Palestinians at Sabra and Shatila in 1982.</p>
<p>The Arab world's reaction to the murder of innocent
Israelis has been very different. In 1985, when an Egyptian
soldier on active duty shot to death seven Israeli tourists,
including four children, in the Sinai, many Egyptians and
Palestinians celebrated the deaths of the Israelis. The
killer, who subsequently died under mysterious circumstances
in an Egyptian prison, has since become a folk hero in Egypt
and the Arab world, enshrined in Arab mythology. Last year,
when 15 Israelis and one American were killed when a
fundamentalist Palestinian caused an Israeli bus to crash in
a ravine, many Palestinians openly justified the killings;
some even rejoiced.</p>
<p>Not only have Palestinians routinely celebrated the
killings of Israelis. They have consistently subscribed to
conspiracies, including their charge that the violent deaths
of Palestinians are part of a deliberate Israeli plot to kill
all Palestinians. This conspiratorial accusation, not
insignificantly, is similar to the way the "intifada" may
have started. After a traffic accident in Gaza in December
1987 in which four Palestinians were killed, Palestinians
immediately charged that the traffic accident was a
deliberate act of premeditated murder by the Israeli
government. In fact, it was just a traffic accident.</p>
<p>While Palestinian exaggerations, conspiracies and
distortions may be understandable given the difficult
circumstances under which the Palestinians live, the U.S.
media and human-rights organizations have a responsibility
not to report them blindly. When Palestinian schoolchildren
several years ago claimed they were being poisoned by Israel,
the accusation was uncritically broadcast all over the world.
Later a team of international scientists determined that
there was no poisoning whatsoever. The children at best were
suffering from some form of mass hysteria, and at worst were
being manipulated by their parents.</p>
<p>The response of the media and human-rights organizations
in the U.S. to the killings of innocent Israelis by Arabs has
been just as skewed. When terrorists opened fire on an
Israeli tour bus outside Cairo and killed nine Israelis, why
didn't human-rights activists and commentators charge that
the event was fostered by the climate of hate against Jews in
Egypt? Palestinian leaders openly justified the killings.
Instead, the U.S. media focused on the apologies issued by
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to foster the notion that
the attack was an "abberation" in Egypt's attitude toward
Israelis.</p>
<p>Whether the attack was an abberation is, in fact,
debatable. An examination of broadcasts and publications in
Egypt in the weeks after the killings indicates, however,
that some Egyptians approved of the killings. Yet, at the
same time, the Egyptian government forcefully condemned the
attack. (In Egypt, the semi-controlled press has been bashing
Israel and Jews for years now, routinely comparing Jews to
Nazis and endorsing the worst conspiratorial accusations
against Jews from the notorious anti-Semitic forgery, the
Protocols of the Elders of Zion.)</p>
<p>Perhaps even worse is how human-rights organizations and
the U.S. media treat the killings of Arabs by Arabs: There is
virtually no coverage or criticism. Two weeks ago, Egyptian
police opened fire on "fundamentalists" southwest of Cairo,
killing 14 Egyptians. The massacre was ignored by nearly all
American newspapers and television networks. The Associated
Press ran a small three-paragraph story -- but quoted only
the version offered by the Egyptian police, who alleged they
were provoked. The media's indifference to inter-Arab
killings is similar to the media's racism in generally
ignoring killings by American blacks against fellow blacks
while at the same time hyping killings of whites by blacks.</p>
<p>In the days to come, there will be the predictable orgy of
Israel-bashing by the media, human-rights organizations and
American supporters of the Palestinians. We will hear that
Israel's soul has been poisoned, that it is responsible for
the killings on Sunday.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the true test of a nation's soul is how it
reacts in the face of such violence. France reacted with
widespread popular revulsion at the desecration of Jewish
cemeteries earlier this month. Israel has moved swiftly and
appropriately. If only the Arab world and the Palestinians
would react similarly.</p>
