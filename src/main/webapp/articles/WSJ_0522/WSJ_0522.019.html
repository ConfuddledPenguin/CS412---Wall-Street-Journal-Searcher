	<p class="article-leader">HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- When is a guaranteed rebate not
guaranteed? When the money is paid to the dealer, instead of
directly to consumers.
   Chrysler Corp. has quietly put a $500 factory-to-dealer
incentive on its stretch minivans. But Chrysler says the move
won't trigger payments to consumers who recently bought the
vehicles, because the incentive money is being paid to
dealers instead of directly to consumers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Chrysler recently pledged that customers who bought a 1990
minivan between April 1 and Sept. 30 will get the amount of
any consumer rebate offered on the vehicle during the
six-month period. The pledge was designed to counter the
sharp drop in minivan sales after January, when Chrysler put
its first-ever rebates on the minivans. The idea was to keep
consumers from waiting for possible new rebates -- which
Chrysler said it didn't expect to offer-before buying.</p>
<p>However, a Chrysler spokesman said yesterday that the
guarantee doesn't apply to factory-to-dealer incentives. The
reason: Dealers can use the money for advertising and other
promotional programs, at their discretion, instead of for
lowering the sticker price.</p>
<p>The question is: Will these new incentives spark
resentment among people who bought their minivans in recent
weeks, thinking that they would get reimbursed for any rebate
that Chrysler added to the vehicle later. Not so, says Edward
Barwick, a Chrysler-Plymouth dealer in Napa, Calif. "They are
two totally different programs," he explains. "This is not a
rebate. This is dealer cash for each unit we sell."</p>
<p>That difference, though, might be lost on some consumers.
"At the absolute least, it's going to cause ill will," says
Ronald Glantz, a veteran auto-industry analyst with Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. in San Francisco. The more publicity
that the dealer incentives get, he explains, the greater the
resentment will be among buyers.</p>
<p>Officially, Chrysler is declining to provide any details
on the stretch-minivan dealer incentives.</p>
<p>"We haven't announced any {consumer} rebates on minivans,"
the Chrysler spokesman maintained. "If we do, {the rebate
guarantee} certainly will be honored."</p>
<p>Just the same, many dealers are expected to use the
factory money to reduce the hefty price of the three Chrysler
long-wheelbase minivans: the Dodge Grand Caravan, Plymouth
Grand Voyager and Chrysler Town and Country. "It just allows
us to sell them for that much less," said Brian Belair,
general manager of Freeway Dodge in Bloomington, Minn., where
the average stretch minivan sells for about $18,500.</p>
<p>The stretch minivan was hotly received when introduced in
the fall of 1986, three years after the No. 3 car maker in
the U.S. came out with its landmark standard minivan.
However, the popularity of the stretch version has slipped
slightly in the current model year; it accounts for 41% of
all Chrysler minivans, down from 42.7% in the 1989 model
year.</p>
<p>The new factory-to-dealer incentive doesn't apply to the
standard-sized minivans. So far this model year, Chrysler has
sold 96,234 stretch minivans and 136,636 standard minivans.</p>
<p>Chrysler's first-time $1,000 rebate on all its minivans in
January boosted sales to 64,000 vehicles, more than double
the normal monthly sales rate. But sales plunged to fewer
than 20,000 vehicles in February after the rebate expired.</p>
<p>The Chrysler minivan, while still the dominant player in
the minivan market, now faces new competition from such
products as Toyota Motor Corp.'s Previa and General Motors
Corp.'s new plastic-bodied minivans.</p>
<p>Chrysler will meet this new competition by giving its
minivan a sleeker exterior and also refining the vehicle's
interior for the 1991 model year. In the meantime, the car
maker is fighting to retain robust sales of its single
most-important product -- which is where the new
factory-to-dealer incentives come in.</p>
