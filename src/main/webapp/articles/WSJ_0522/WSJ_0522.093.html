	<p class="article-leader">Taiwan shares declined sharply for the fourth consecutive
session Monday, as the market's bearish sentiment persisted.
   Frankfurt share prices slid on continuing worries about
the planned monetary and economic union of the two Germanys.
In Tokyo, stocks finished lower in light trading, as the
yen's weakness and lower bond prices discouraged buying
interest. London equities firmed in lackluster trading,
pushed higher by strength in stock-index futures contracts
and markups.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In Taipei, traders said that investors have lost their
confidence and that further drops in share prices are
possible. A trader said no one knows where the bottom is. The
weighted index, which tumbled 510.21 points Friday, fell
424.07, or 5.72%, to finish at 6992.89, the lowest closing
level since Feb. 27, 1989, when the index ended at 6885.51.</p>
<p>Trading volume, including stocks and mutual funds, was
about 962.5 million shares valued at 71.36 billion New Taiwan
dollars (US$2.62 billion), compared with 997.9 million shares
valued at NT$72.61 billion Friday. The market was closed
Saturday because of a typhoon.</p>
<p>The market opened firmer because of Taiwan President Lee
Teng Hui's inauguration speech Sunday, calling for an end to
four decades of hostilities with the rival Communist
government in Beijing. The market expected that a changed
policy toward China would bring Taiwan manufacturers more
trade opportunities.</p>
<p>The reports stimulated buying and drove the market up more
than 160 points in the first 15 minutes. But this strength
ebbed, after investors showed little interest in buying at
highs. The market tone turned weak and dropped rapidly at the
close.</p>
<p>"Investors are now in a panic, and selling becomes the
only direction," Hsu Daw Yi, vice president of Core Pacific
Securities Co., said. "Volatility is expected to continue."
He blamed the recent market weakness on shaky confidence and
concerns about capital outflow. The market has plunged
1576.66 points, or 18.4%, since last Wednesday.</p>
<p>In Frankfurt, the equities market also was sapped by the
soft West German bond and bond futures markets, which opened
lower and remained weak. The weighted DAX Index, compiled at
the close, fell 32.41 points, or 1.76%, to 1811.18. The
narrower FAZ Index, calculated at midday, was down 16.45
points to 771.70.</p>
<p>The DAX is near the 1800 lower end of the trading range
forecast for the second quarter, which previously had a
projected high point of about 2000. The index's historical
high was set March 30 at 1968.55; the low on Jan. 28, 1988,
at 931.18.</p>
<p>The market continued to be whipped by investor reactions
to developments in monetary unification. Worries were cited
that the opposition Social Democrats may try to change the
substance or timing of the reunification plan. And there is
concern about the weakness of the West German senior
coalition partner, the Christian Democrats, after the party's
setback in two state elections last week.</p>
<p>A market rumor Monday had Bundesbank President Karl Otto
Poehl resigning soon, but the central bank denied this.</p>
<p>Price declines were spread across the board, paced by blue
chips such as Daimler-Benz, the diversified automotive giant,
which ended down 16 marks ($9.71) at 807 marks. Auto maker
BMW slipped 12 to 571, Volkswagen was down 9 at 579, and
Porsche fell 39 to 1,120.</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank fell 14.50 to 761, Commerzbank was off 20 at
277, and Dresdner Bank edged 5.5 lower to 25.</p>
<p>Positive news didn't help Viag, an energy, chemical and
aluminum concern. Despite a 14% rise in first-quarter profit
and the promise of higher 1990 earnings, its stock fell 6 to
408.</p>
<p>In Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 issues lost 248.67
points to close at 31765.05, but was up from the intraday low
of 31605.33. The index shed 47.88 points Friday.</p>
<p>At midmorning in Tokyo Tuesday, the Nikkei index was up
41.86 points to 31806.91.</p>
<p>On Monday, investors' participation slowed because of
discouraging moves lower by the yen. The Nikkei index also
was pushed down Monday in light rounds of futures-related
arbitrage selling, traders said.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index, or Topix, of all first
section issues, which lost 10.97 points Friday, was down
17.44 at 2370.82.</p>
<p>First section volume was estimated at 350 million shares,
down from 481 million shares Friday, and off 38% from 923
million the previous Monday. Trading volume has shrunk day by
day since the Nikkei index climbed above 32000 last Monday,
signifying a recovery of one-third of its accumulated loss
between the record high of 38915 posted Dec. 29 and the low
of 28002 on April 2.</p>
<p>Traders said investors were unable to decide which stocks
to buy, as few attractively priced stocks were left after the
recent recovery of stock prices. They also attributed the
recent sluggish trading to the major brokerage houses' annual
personnel changes that occurred last week.</p>
<p>Daifuku, which predicted Friday that its pretax profit
will increase 47% in fiscal 1990, rose as high as 2,220 yen
($14.51) before closing at 2,170, up 40.</p>
<p>Environment-related stocks, such as pollution-control
equipment makers, were bought actively for their strong
earnings outlooks, traders said. Ebara was up 130 at 2,130,
and Daikin gained 30 to 1,910.</p>
<p>Nikon rose 50 to 1,550 on expectations of improved annual
profit, traders said.</p>
<p>Speculative shares continued strong advances. Honshu
Paper, which surged 220 on Friday, added 20 to close at
2,600, down from the midday high of 2,730.</p>
<p>Investors took profits on pharmaceuticals, which had risen
sharply late last week. Mochida fell 130 to 3,860.</p>
<p>In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index gained 13.0 points to close at 2282.1, at its intraday
high and significantly above its midday low of 2261.3. The FT
30-share index closed up 17.5 points at 1810.8. Volume was a
thin 316.2 million shares, down from 594.8 million on Friday.</p>
<p>London shares largely ignored Britain's provisional money
supply figures for April, which exceeded forecasts, as bank
lending shrank. Traders said Wall Street gains late in
London's session helped boost shares.</p>
<p>Associated British Foods gained 2 pence to 390 pence
($6.59), after it posted a 20% jump in pretax profit for the
year ended March 31, in line with expectations.</p>
<p>Carlton Communications plunged 25% to 515, despite an
interim report that pretax profit rose 54% to #64.9 million
($109.7 million), though profit-taking was cited.
Profit-taking battered other issues. Reuters dropped 17 to
#11.26, and the property concern Hammerson lost 11 pence to
714.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, share prices closed higher in Stockholm and
Milan, and lower in Paris, Zurich, Brussels and Amsterdam.
South African gold stocks closed higher.</p>
<p>Equities closed lower in Sydney and Wellington, and higher
in Manila, Singapore and Seoul, and were mixed in Hong Kong.</p>

Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
