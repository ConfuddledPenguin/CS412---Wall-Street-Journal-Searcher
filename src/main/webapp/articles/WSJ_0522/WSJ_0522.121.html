	<p class="article-leader">K mart Corp., citing an emphasis on lower shelf prices,
said net income for its first quarter ended May 2 increased
6.4% on a 16% rise in sales.
   The Troy, Mich., discount retailer said net income was
$100.1 million, or 50 cents a share, compared with the
year-earlier $94.1 million, or 47 cents a share. Sales rose
to $7.04 billion from $6.07 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The earnings also reflect the inclusion of K mart's
recently acquired Pace Membership Warehouse stores, the
company said.</p>
<p>K mart noted that net interest expense rose to $56.5
million from $33.2 million, primarily because of greater
short-term borrowing for high inventory levels, but also
partially related to the recent $322 million Pace
acquisition.</p>
<p>The company said it is "encouraged by the improvement in
sales in the first quarter and in early May," and said it
anticipates "an improving trend in sales and earnings."</p>
