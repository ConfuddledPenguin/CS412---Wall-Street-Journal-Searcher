	<p class="article-leader">ANTI-ISRAELI UNREST SWEPT the Mideast in protests over
workers' slayings.
   Israeli soldiers killed three Palestinians and wounded as
many as 95 others in clashes sparked by Sunday's massacre of
seven Arab laborers by an Israeli civilian near Tel Aviv.
Despite curfews imposed by the army, stone-throwing rioters
defied the troops in the occupied Gaza Strip and in Israel
itself. Hundreds of people were reported injured, including
10 tourists aboard a bus in Jordan who were attacked by a
Palestinian gunman. The violence was considered the fiercest
since the early days of the anti-Israeli uprising two years
ago.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The U.S. said that it was disturbed by the violence in
Israel, and that the lack of a peace process in the Mideast
increases the likelihood of unrest.</p>

<p>India's security forces opened fire on a crowd of about
100,000 Moslems bearing the body of a slain religious leader
in the disputed Kashmir region. At least 41 people were
killed and more than 200 injured, witnesses said. Government
officials blamed "unidentified militants" for the violence.</p>

<p>A strike by pro-Moscow forces failed to win widespread
support in Estonia as many workers ignored a call to walk off
their jobs to protest the Baltic republic's secession drive.
In Lithuania, lawmakers drafted a new offer aimed at breaking
Vilnius's deadlock with Moscow over the republic's March 11
proclamation of independence.</p>
<p>The Kremlin plans to double food prices as part of
economic-restructuring measures that are scheduled to begin
next year. A preliminary draft of the economic program,
obtained by the Associated Press, calls for a five-year
transition to a market economy.</p>

<p>Foreign observers in Romania differed over whether
Sunday's first multiparty elections in 53 years were free of
fraud. Partial results showed interim President Iliescu
headed for a landslide victory, with his National Salvation
Front winning in parliamentary balloting. But some
irregularities were cited by a 60-member monitoring group.</p>

<p>Prosecutors in Miami told a federal court judge that the
government agreed to pay for Noriega's defense against drug
charges. Separately, the U.S. attorneys acknowledged that the
deposed Panamanian leader received payments from U.S.
intelligence agencies, but disputed a defense figure of $11
million.</p>

<p>Bush pledged to continue pushing for an accord with the
Soviet Union on a treaty to cut troops in Europe. The issue
wasn't resolved during Secretary of State Baker's
arms-control talks last week in Moscow. Gorbachev, meanwhile,
is sending arms experts to Washington this week to resume
pre-summit talks on long-range weapons.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The Supreme Court let stand a federal court order issued
in 1989 that permanently bars the anti-abortion group
Operation Rescue from blocking access at abortion clinics in
New York City. The justices allowed a similar ban in Atlanta
last week, and there are such orders against the group in a
number of cities.</p>

<p>A bipartisan congressional group found that 14 of El
Salvador's 15 top military officers, including the defense
minister, have commanded military units that committed
human-rights abuses. The report was released as the House
prepared to vote today on a plan to withhold 50% of U.S.
military aid to El Salvador.</p>

<p>About 80 AIDS activists were arrested at the National
Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., during a protest
calling for more government research into the disease. The
demonstration came amid a host of fiscal and political
problems at the medical organization.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>HHS proposed rules to regulate the quality and accuracy of
medical tests performed in the nation's clinical
laboratories. The proposal, prompted by frequent inaccuracies
in Pap-smear results, requires that most labs, including
those in doctors' offices, be federally certified.</p>

<p>West German Social Democrats urged changes in a newly
signed economic treaty with East Germany, a move that could
delay the merger of the two German economic systems by July
2. The main opposition party demanded negotiations with
Chancellor Kohl on modifications to the pact.</p>

<p>Black youths in South Africa erected barricades in Thabong
township following a clash between protesters and police that
left at least seven blacks dead and about 40 injured. The
unrest came as Pretoria and the African National Congress
began studying plans for releasing political prisoners.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>North and South Yemen ratified a merger plan, and a formal
declaration of a single Yemeni state was set for today. The
combination of the pro-Western North with the socialist South
would create the most populous nation in the Arabian
peninsula.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Gunmen in Colombia killed a senator who was closely allied
to presidential front-runner Cesar Gaviria. The Bogota
government blamed cocaine traffickers for the slaying in the
city of Medellin, saying the shooting was part of a wave of
violence that has flared before Sunday's nationwide
elections.</p>
