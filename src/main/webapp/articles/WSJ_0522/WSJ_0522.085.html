	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Short interest for the month ended May 15
climbed to records on the New York Stock Exchange, which
posted a 4.9% rise, and the American Stock Exchange, up 2%.
   Varity Corp., the Toronto manufacturer of farm equipment
and automobile parts, led the Big Board short volumes with
13,145,035 uncovered short shares. Texas Air Corp., the
Houston airline holding company, continued to lead the Amex,
this time with 8,547,761 shorted shares.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Big Board reported that short interest outstanding on
the May 15 settlement date climbed to 644,549,698 shares from
613,933,904 shares at mid-April. On the Amex, short volume
reached 71,997,960 shares from an adjusted 70,555,710 shares
a month earlier. The latest figures reflect trades through
May 8.</p>
<p>At mid-May 1989, short interest on the Big Board was
528,669,482 shares, indicating a 21% rise, while volume on
the American exchange was 43,706,386, a 64% jump.</p>
<p>Traders who sell short borrow stock and sell it, betting
that the stock's price will decline and that they can buy the
shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender.</p>
<p>Short interest is the number of shares that haven't yet
been purchased for return to lenders. Although a substantial
short position reflects heavy speculation that a stock's
price will decline, some investors consider an increase in
short interest bullish because the borrowed shares eventually
must be bought back.</p>
<p>Fluctuation in short interest of certain stocks also may
be caused partly by arbitraging. The figures occasionally
include incomplete transactions in restricted stock.</p>
<p>The level of negative sentiment measured by the Big Board
short interest ratio rose to 4.61 from last month's 4.19. The
ratio is the number of trading days at the exchange's average
daily trading volume that would be required to convert the
total short interest position.</p>
<p>Some analysts suggest, however, that the ratio has
weakened in value as an indicator because options and other
products can be used to hedge short positions.</p>
<p>Two bellwether issues on the Big Board were little
changed. Volume in International Business Machines Corp., the
Armonk, N.Y., computer company, dropped less than 1% to
4,020,829 shares from 4,053,955 shares, while New York oil
giant Exxon Corp.'s short volume eased 1.1% to 5,519,394
shares from 5,581,248 shares.</p>
<p>The adjacent tables show the Big Board and Amex issues in
which a short interest position of at least 100,000 shares
existed at mid-May or in which the short position had changed
by at least 50,000 shares since mid-April (see accompanying
tables -- WSJ May 22, 1990).</p>
