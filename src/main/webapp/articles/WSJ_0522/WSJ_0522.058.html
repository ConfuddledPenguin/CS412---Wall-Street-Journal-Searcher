	<p class="article-leader">Milan -- "Esattamente come a Napoli." This was the cab
driver's most venomous and emphatic description of the welter
of parked cars abandoned across a busy street. "Just like
Naples." I thought for a moment he would say New York, for
New York is what you think of when you go to Milan.
   Here is a vast gray city, its streets habitually torn up,
and those not torn up are blocked by the debris of
construction sites. It is the country's political dynamo, its
center of money, fashion, enterprise and communication, the
machine that makes all Italy revolve, as the Milanese say.
The weather is rainy, hot or dirty, bitter cold.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Milan is a cultural obstacle course too. Contestants are
very often taken up with the chase for tickets to La Scala,
but the artistic life in general is carried on at a high
pitch. The restaurants are always full and there is seldom a
room free in a hotel. It's May, travel agents say, or it's
November, as though everyone was supposed to know what was
going on. A symbol of the city's energy is the great central
railroad station, which throws out lines all over southern
Europe. The station is an enormous pile of granite and
marble, bulging with muscular horses and men and sheathed in
semi-Roman vaulting. It was built in the year II of the
fascist regime, a date once carved on the entablature of the
building. But not so very long ago it was chisled away in
favor of 1931 in the year of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The station is layered in two great concourses, the ticket
windows at street level and the tracks 40 feet up staircases
that, although mitigated by escalators, still are a trial for
passengers with awkward or heavy luggage. It nevertheless is
a splendid sight to glimpse, at the top, the serried
signboards proclaiming the great destinations -- Venice,
Bologna, Mantua, Ferrara, Genoa, Turin.</p>
<p>Passengers and their freight make most of the noise. There
are no screams or hisses from the locomotives waiting
powerfully under the glass and iron-girded roof. And when the
trains move, they move noiselessly. On one track stands the
silver Settebello, the train for Rome. An American mother is
climbing aboard to visit her daughter, halfway through a year
at a pensione in Florence, as surely her own mother had
visited her 40 years before.</p>
<p>For all its aggressive salience, the station goes soft
when it faces the city. It has an unfinished feeling,
heightened by a circle of ragged park, with its battered
grass and jumble of masonry and stray dogs. The place is
strangely isolated with few station hotels and a long, ugly
colonnaded avenue, very Mussolinian in feeling, its principal
access to the maelstrom of the city.</p>
<p>Despite its ancient monuments such as the Basilica of St.
Ambrose, or the palaces and churches of the Renaissance,
Milan exudes a 19th-century air. Manzoni, Stendhal, the
Austrian archdukes and Risorgimento figures such as Cavour
and Victor Emmanuele are its ghosts. It is easy to see the
broughams and phaetons and their smart horses and coachmen at
the port-cochere of the Scala or prancing through the quarter
of Montenapoleone.</p>
<p>The Milanese are still very elegant in their rich, dark
clothes. But the atmosphere is one of business, and business
is the soul of change. In one of the most fashionable
restaurants the current scene powerfully reflects it.</p>
<p>There is the refectory table of Japanese businessmen.
There are the sex kittens on the banquettes in sapphires and
miniskirts. There are the male customers in leather jackets
and gold chains. The service is hasty and the food is well on
its way downhill.</p>
<p>We ask a waiter to call a taxi as we end our meal and
battle our way out against the surge of the next sitting. At
the front door a youth blocks our path. He is wearing a light
gray sweatshirt with the words "Dress for Success" stamped
across his chest.</p>
<p>Who are you and why are you wearing that? I gasp out in
exasperation. I am the driver of the taxi you ordered, comes
the wholly reasonable and yet for some reason astonishing
reply.</p>
