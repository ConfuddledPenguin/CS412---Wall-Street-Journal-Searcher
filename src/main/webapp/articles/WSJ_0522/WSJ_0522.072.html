	<h3>Business World: Any Wonder Medical Premiums Are Anything but Shrinking?</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">If you want one reason why medical costs are a health
hazard to American business, consider preliminary figures
from the 1989 A. Foster Higgins & Co. benefits survey:
   For companies of more than 5,000 employees, psychiatric
and "substance-abuse" benefits rose 47% last year, to $297 a
head.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Among all employers offering such benefits, costs
increased 18% in 1989, to $244 per worker, after having
jumped 27% in 1988.</p>
<p>Typically, this type of claim is made by only 1% of the
work force, according to John Erb, a Foster Higgins managing
consultant. (Others say 4% to 5%.) And in most cases, it is
made not for the worker's own care, but for a dependent --
usually an adolescent. Often these treatments involve
extended and/or repeated hospital stays; one 1988 calculation
put the average billing for an offspring's admission at
$18,000.</p>
<p>The usual tale of medical benefits-runamok dwells on the
role of expensive technology and heroic measures to save the
desperately ill. That is not the case here. Rather, the most
rapidly rising element of health-insurance costs is a
function of changing social conventions, commercialism and
law.</p>
<p>Total admissions to mental facilities rose to 1.8 million
in 1987, from 1.3 million in 1969. The biggest surge has been
at private, for-profit centers, in which referring doctors
sometimes have a stake. According to Ron Manderscheid of the
National Institute of Mental Health, their number and patient
load have grown threefold over the past two decades.</p>
<p>Industry data confirm that trend plus nearly as swift a
rise of psychiatric units of general hospitals. A big reason:
third-party reimbursement for this type of care is not
limited under the Diagnosis-Related Group schedules that now
apply to most of medicine. Meanwhile, state, county and
Veterans Administration facilities -- traditional caretakers
to most of the mentally ill -- continued in the 1980s to
unload thousands of patients, typically shrinking 20% to 25%.
At the present rate, they will handle within a few years only
a minority of this trade. The fast-growing market in alcohol-
and drug-abuse recovery programs is already a largely private
one.</p>
<p>With dwindling public provision a given, the rise of
mainstream, commercial treatment of the psyche is seen either
as a blessing or a racket. Mr. Manderscheid's National
Institute advocates vastly expanding access to mental
treatment, and he credits the gains in patronage of private
facilities not only to public-sector patient shifts but to
the baby-boom generation reaching an age range in which
schizophrenia and depression commonly are found, to greater
cultural acceptance of care and to widened insurance
coverage.</p>
<p>But critics contend mental units market themselves in
response to voguish social and personal problems (eating
disorders, sexual abuse, "co-dependency") and have become
dumping grounds for adolescents (average stay: 42.3 days)
whose parents want nothing more to do with them. The
percentage of private psychiatric hospital admissions going
to those under age 18 has tripled since 1970, to 20.5% by
1986.</p>
<p>On the balance sheets of U.S. businesses, the indemnity
burden of these trends is equally striking. Steep cost growth
continues despite new resolve to limit coverage. Bigger
employers tend to be most exposed because they have union
contracts tying their hands. Also, according to Mr. Erb of
Foster Higgins, smaller companies are more likely to be
enrolled in insurance plans whose managers are alert to the
potential for abuse.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, says Mr. Erb, psych shops grow more aggressive
at marketing, coming up with "creative ways of providing
treatment that may or may not be effective." One recent twist
he cites is the admission of multiple family members in order
to deal with the apparent problems of one of them.</p>
<p>The preponderance of dependent cases means that one step
business has taken to minimize the risk of costly coverage --
drug screening of applicants before hiring -- has only
miminal insurance impact, because you can't test the spouse
or kids.</p>
<p>Employers are turning to exclusive-provider arrangements
for mental treatment, with the contractor having an incentive
to hold costs down by curbing casual use of treatment or
steering patients to less-expensive out-patient care or to
cheaper help than $120-an-hour psychiatrists. Some pennywise
thinking in this area can backfire on business, says Mr. Erb,
a former emergency-room registered nurse himself. He argues
that resistance to reimbursing outpatient therapy in the
1970s may have helped to spur the boom in private
hospitalization. Likewise, he says, unwillingness today to
pay for weeks-long addiction-rehabilitation stays in favor of
weekend "detox" might be foolish if, as he suspects, only the
lengthier programs work.</p>
<p>Few dispute that mental-health programs can have positive
effect. Although U.S. business appears to suffer
internationally from their costs (the president's
Competitiveness Council is trying to find good global data),
Japan, which masks its psychological troubles, is beset with
an increasing suicide rate among younger men. Still, some
evidence supports the criticism of trendiness here. Foster
Higgins finds, for example, that employee benefits paid for
these services are 50% higher on the West Coast than in the
north-central U.S. Could maladies vary that much?</p>
<p>As Mr. Erb observes, not long ago two large markets in
American medicine lay beyond the reach of the non-affluent --
psychotherapy and cosmetic surgery. In more recent years,
thanks to mandates in nearly half the states that health
insurers cover the mind, only beauty therapy remains a
strictly out-of-pocket expense. Another burden of modern life
had been made institutional instead of individual.</p>
<p>A sense that the tide is turning pervaded last week's
meeting of the American Psychiatric Association in New York,
reports suggest. Since at least 1975 the field has been
growing faster than the population, but the assembled shrinks
groused that it was getting harder to keep patients in a less
subsidized environment.</p>
<p>Another straw in the wind is the financial trouble of
Charter Medical Corp., the largest of the psychiatric
hospital chains. High leverage is causing much of the
distress, but the company also blames a tighter leash by
insurance carriers.</p>
<p>Surely it's time for fiscal restraint. Certainly those
trying to plug effective cost-controls into
universal-health-coverage schemes should analyze this
picture. They may find that it shows mental-health
responsibilities, like much of wellness, are best handled
close to home.</p>
