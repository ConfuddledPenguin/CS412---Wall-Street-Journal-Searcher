	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- The Berne Union -- a group of export-credit
agencies from 32 nations -- is moving to review coverage of
the Soviet Union in the face of persistent payment delays by
Moscow on commercial-trade transactions.
   The union -- which has 40 members, a quarter from the
developed world -- will discuss potential action on Soviet
export-credit coverage at its annual meeting starting Sunday
in Italy, said a spokesman for Malcolm Stephens, chief
executive officer of Britain's Export Credit Guarantee
Department and president of the union.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Discussions at the six-day meeting will particularly focus
on whether the union should move to hold formal talks with
the Soviets about the delays and on remedial actions that may
be taken to avoid future payment problems.</p>
<p>Export-credit guarantees haven't been a favored route of
import-financing by Moscow, nor have they been affected by
payment delays. The notion of formal talks at least signals
growing concerns among government-related credit agencies
that the situation may deteriorate.</p>
<p>Separately, industry representatives in Tokyo told the
Kyodo news agency that Moscow has asked Japanese creditors
for a one-year deferment in its payments for recently
purchased steel pipes. Kyodo said the creditors rejected the
request but said they would accept a deferment of 180 days in
exchange for a letter of guarantee. But, the representatives
told the news agency, the Soviets "are reluctant to provide
such a letter."</p>
<p>London bankers said some Western nations favor using the
Berne Union as a medium through which bilateral discussions
with the Soviets over remedial action on delayed trade
payments can be focused.</p>
