	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The World Bank is considering two loans to
China that congressional leaders say could set off a new
round of protest over Beijing's human-rights policy and
endanger support for the Third World lending institution.
   The loans -- for a $300 million forestry project and a
$150 million transportation project -- are scheduled for
consideration May 29. Approval of either of the measures,
less than a year after the military crackdown in Tiananmen
Square, would seriously lessen the chances for passage of
legislation needed to replenish the bank's soft-loan window,
bank supporters say.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>House Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez (D.,
Texas) said he favors holding up a bill authorizing a $3.2
billion contribution to the bank's International Development
Association, which makes no-interest loans to the world's
poorest countries, including China.</p>
<p>A separate bill appropriating the money likely won't be
blocked but would face a difficult time in Congress.</p>
<p>"If the World Bank proceeds, it will weaken its position
on the Hill," said Rep. Matthew McHugh (D., N.Y.), a member
of the Appropriations Committee who supports the bank. "A
realistic assessment of the politics here is that those loans
will make our job much more difficult."</p>
<p>World Bank lending to China was halted last year after the
Tiananmen Square incident, but resumed this spring when the
U.S. indicated it would support measures that target basic
human needs.</p>
<p>Three loans totaling $140 million have gone toward
earthquake assistance, job training and rural development.</p>
<p>U.S. policy is to support loans for "the poorest and most
vulnerable people in China," said John Niehuss, deputy
assistant Treasury secretary for international policy.</p>
<p>Acting on that policy, the administration opposed the
transportation loan when it was up for consideration earlier
this spring, organizing enough opposition among the Group of
Seven major industrial nations that it wasn't formally put
before the bank's board of directors.</p>
<p>U.S. opposition continues on that project, although the
G-7 coalition appears to have fractured somewhat, enhancing
the loan's chances of approval, congressional and World Bank
sources say.</p>
<p>The administration position is less clear on the forestry
project. In recent briefings on Capitol Hill, the
administration indicated it might support the measure because
an argument can be made that it creates jobs.</p>
<p>That view isn't widely shared on Capitol Hill, where
dissatisfaction lingers about President Bush's stance toward
China. Approval of either loan would almost certainly upset
the bank's political base in Congress.</p>
<p>In particular, liberal Democrats, who make up the bank's
primary backers in Congress, would face the choice of either
sticking with it or opposing it to express displeasure with
China's human-rights policy. California's Nancy Pelosi is one
liberal Democrat who has already made up her mind.</p>
<p>"If those loans go through, it would say that one year
after Tiananmen Square, it didn't make a difference," said
Rep. Pelosi, adding that expanded World Bank lending could
prompt other countries to resume bilateral aid to China.
"Those loans will be subject to very strong scrutiny. They're
going to have a fight."</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell criticized
resumption of World Bank lending to China earlier this year.
The Maine Democrat has called for a tougher U.S. policy. "Our
moral stance has been compromised," he said.</p>
