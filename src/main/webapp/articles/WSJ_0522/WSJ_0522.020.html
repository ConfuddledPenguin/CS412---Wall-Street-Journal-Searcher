	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Peter Monroe, an official with the
Department of Housing and Urban Development, was appointed to
a top position in the savings-and-loan bailout effort.
   As expected, the Oversight Board of the Resolution Trust
Corp. appointed Mr. Monroe, 46 years old, to be the board's
president, effective June 11. The Oversight Board sets policy
and oversees the actions of the RTC, which sells and
liquidates insolvent S&Ls.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The post was a position of some controversy in the early
months of the bailout, which began last August, when the
several agencies with a role in the S&L sales disputed lines
of authority. Mr. Monroe will succeed William Taylor, a
Federal Reserve official, who was in the job temporarily. Mr.
Taylor is expected to take over as chairman of the RTC, which
is lower in the bailout hierarchy, when the current chairman,
William Seidman, resigns.</p>
<p>Mr. Monroe has been the general deputy assistant secretary
for housing for one year, and before that was president of
Rutenberg Commercial Developers, Clearwater, Fla.</p>
<p>The Oversight Board includes Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, and
Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp. The board
also includes Philip Jackson, a former Federal Reserve
governor, and Robert Larson, president of Taubman Co., a real
estate development concern in Bloomfield Hills, Mich.</p>
