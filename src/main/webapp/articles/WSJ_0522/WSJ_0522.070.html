	<p class="article-leader">CHULA VISTA, Calif. -- Rohr Industries Inc. said it might
buy back as many as 300,000 common shares.
   The maker of aircraft-engine parts said it was considering
the purchases, to be made from time to time, because the
company believes its stock to be a good investment at the
current price.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Rohr's stock closed yesterday at $21.375, up 87.5 cents a
share, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
<p>The company may use the repurchased stock for its
employee-stock ownership plan or for other general purposes,
it said. Rohr currently has about 17.8 million shares
outstanding.</p>
