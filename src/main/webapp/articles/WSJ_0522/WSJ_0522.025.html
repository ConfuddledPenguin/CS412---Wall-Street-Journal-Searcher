	<p class="article-leader">EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- International Rectifier Corp. and
Siliconix Inc. said they reached agreement on
patent-infringement litigation concerning International
Rectifier's power-transistor technology.
   Under terms of the accord, Siloconix, of Santa Clara,
Calif., will pay International Rectifier $12 million over a
two-year period and will acquire a royalty-bearing license
under the litigated patents.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Siliconix filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the
Federal bankruptcy code April 10 after a U.S. district court
held valid all five of International Rectifier's patents on
the power-transistor technology. Implementation of the
agreement is subject to approval of the bankruptcy court.</p>
<p>Siliconix supplies advanced semiconductor products.
International Rectifier supplies power semiconductors and
other products. The litigation had been pending since 1986.</p>
