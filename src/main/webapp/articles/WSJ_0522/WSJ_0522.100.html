	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A Connecticut state court judge postponed
Kollmorgen Corp.'s annual meeting for a week, and ordered the
company and a dissident shareholder to try to resolve a
dispute involving control of the company.
   Superior Court Judge Nicholas A. Cioffi delayed until May
31, the Kollmorgen annual meeting for which Vernitron Corp.
has been soliciting proxies to gain control of the board.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Vernitron, a closely held motors and controls company
based in Deer Park, N.Y., has said it is prepared to offer
$15 a share for Kollmorgen if its proxy contest for control
of the board is successful.</p>
<p>Kollmorgen, a Simsbury, Conn., maker of motors, controls
and electro-optical equipment, has been trying to fend off a
takeover attempt by Vernitron. The two companies are suing
each other over a collapsed merger agreement.</p>
<p>The ruling by Judge Cioffi concerns litigation related to
Kollmorgen's issuance in March of convertible preferred stock
to an investor group that represents about 13.8% of
Kollmorgen's common shares outstanding.</p>
<p>The judge asked each side to name a member of a special
masters committee to seek a resolution to the dispute over
the preferred shares, which Vernitron asserts were issued in
violation of previous court stand-still orders.</p>
<p>Vernitron owns almost 6% of Kollmorgen.</p>
