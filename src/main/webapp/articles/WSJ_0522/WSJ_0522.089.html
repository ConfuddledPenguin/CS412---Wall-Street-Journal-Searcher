	<p class="article-leader">Does the televised Winston Cup car race count as
advertising? How about the Camel Supercross motorcycle race,
aired on ESPN?
   For legislators attempting to crack down on tobacco
advertising, the answer is an unqualified yes. And now, at
least one legislator is taking on the televised car, bike and
truck races as part of a crusade to curb tobacco advertising.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Rep. Thomas A. Luken (D., Ohio), an outspoken tobacco
gadfly and a sponsor of a bill restricting tobacco
advertising, plans to launch an investigation into the
televised races today, an aide says. In letters being sent to
the three major networks and ESPN, among others, Mr. Luken
asks for details of their financial relationships with
tobacco companies, in order "to understand the extent to
which television sports events are in fact sponsored by
tobacco companies."</p>
<p>Tobacco foes have long complained about tobacco companies'
sports sponsorships, saying the sponsorships are in fact
back-door tactics to circumvent a 20-year-old television ad
ban. Tobacco ads on scoreboards and billboards in stadiums
are frequent targets of legislators and other anti-tobacco
activists.</p>
<p>But the critics' complaints so far have had only marginal
results, which may be why they are turning to motor sports.
Televised motor races are far more obvious in flaunting their
sponsors, whose names tend to be plastered across racing
cars, helmets, and everything else in camera view. According
to the House subcommittee on transportation and hazardous
materials, of which Mr. Luken is chairman, a Camel logo was
visible 30% of the time on the ESPN-aired Camel Supercross,
an indoor motorcycle race. The Marlboro logo was shown 49% of
the time during the 1989 Marlboro Grand Prix, according to
Mr. Luken's letter.</p>
<p>"This isn't just a baseball stadium where you occasionally
see something. This is serious business. It's a matter of
degree," says Benjamin Cohen, the Luken aide. He notes that
car races frequently include a camera stationed inside one of
the race cars, and that a tobacco logo often appears on the
dashboard. "These things don't happen by chance," he says.
"They happen because people are signing contracts and paying
money."</p>
<p>Mr. Luken's initiative comes at a time when public
sentiment has clearly turned against smoking. A powerful
tobacco lobby was unable to prevent Congress last year from
outlawing smoking on most domestic airline flights. More than
a dozen bills limiting tobacco in some way are pending on
Capitol Hill right now, including Mr. Luken's initiative,
which would ban all sports sponsorships and allow only
all-text print ads for tobacco products. Next month, Rep.
Henry Waxman (D., Calif) is expected to introduce yet another
bill, this time one incorporating parts of the various bills
already pending.</p>
<p>Tobacco companies, for their part, contend that sponsoring
televised races and race cars isn't advertising at all. "It's
promotion of our product, just like the Virginia Slims Tennis
Tournament is," says a spokeswoman for Philip Morris, maker
of Marlboro, among other brands. She adds that "there is no
agreement" with the networks under which they are required to
show the company's logo during races -- although when the
logo is plastered all over the car and its driver, it would
be difficult not to show it.</p>
<p>In fact, the spokeswoman says, during the Indy 500, Philip
Morris didn't allow an ABC camera in a car with a Marlboro
logo on the dashboard. "We didn't want the camera to be
focused on the logo," she says. "The law is that there is no
television advertising, and we adhere to the law."</p>
<p>At NBC, Richard Gitter, vice president of standards and
practices, says that tobacco sponsorships of motor races
"isn't advertising that is the kind of advertising
contemplated -- and barred -- by the Federal Cigarette
Labeling and Advertising Act." Mr. Gitter declined comment on
the letter, as he hadn't received it.</p>
<p>Another recipient of the letter is to be Charles Mancuso,
president of SRO/Pace Promotions, a Lombard, Ill., firm that
produces motor sports events, including the Camel Supercross.
Mr. Mancuso declined comment on the letter, which he also
hadn't received. He added that he didn't know of any
relationship between the tobacco companies and the networks
that air their races.</p>

<p>Chiat Shop Buy-Out</p>
<p>Chiat/Day/Mojo said it plans to sell a majority interest
of its San Francisco office to a group of employees at the
office, including its president and chief executive, Fred
Goldberg.</p>
<p>Chiat/Day said it was selling the interest because Mr.
Goldberg and other managers "wanted the opportunity to own
their own business and sought the chance to acquire the
agency."</p>
<p>Los Angeles-based Chiat/Day will retain an minority
interest in the shop, although it said the San Francisco
management group plans to fully own the operation in the
future. Terms weren't disclosed.</p>
<p>The San Francisco employees will give the agency an as-yet
unannounced new name. It will continue to serve most of
Chiat/Day's San Francisco clients, which include Atari and
Celestial Seasonings. The office has billings of about $110
million.</p>
<p>Chiat/Day said it hopes to move three clients that it
picked up with its merger with Mojo -- Qantas, Australian
Tourist Commission and Koala Springs -- to its Los Angeles
office.</p>

<p>Ad Notes. . . .</p>
<p>HILL HOLLIDAY: Upjohn Co., Kalamazoo, Mich., awarded its
Motrin IB painkiller account to Hill, Holliday, Connors,
Cosmopulos's New York office. Susan Smith, managing director
of the shop's New York operations, said the account will bill
$30 million this year. Ms. Smith said the win represented the
office's largest account victory ever. Upjohn introduced
Motrin IB last summer with ads created by Avrett, Free &
Ginsberg, New York.</p>

executive officer of Chiat/Day/Mojo's Canadian agency in
Toronto. Mr. Matathia was previously senior vice president
and director of client services.</p>
