	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Technology stocks are on a tear.
   Ever since technology companies started reporting
quarterly earnings last month that beat analysts'
expectations, the stocks have rocketed to highs that have
dazzled traders and investors. Indeed, a few analysts are
starting to wonder if technology issues -- computer, software
and semiconductor stocks -- aren't pointing to a further
rally in the stock market.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>By any account, the rally in certain technology stocks has
been astonishing. Compaq Computer Corp. closed at $121.375 a
share yesterday, up $2.75, for a gain of 22% this month
alone. Digital Equipment Corp. closed at $90.625 yesterday,
up $1.375, for a gain on the month of 9.2%. International
Business Machines Corp., once a laggard trading in the low
$90s, added another $1.625 yesterday to close at $117, up
7.3% this month.</p>
<p>The computer-industry group of the Dow Jones Equity Market
Index is up 18.8% this year, while the overall index is up
only 0.98%.</p>
<p>The surge in technology issues underscores the point that
1990 is shaping up as a year for growth stocks: issues that
can grow earnings faster than the overall pace of corporate
profits. But technology stocks weren't always romanced by
investors. Late last year, they were dumped.</p>
<p>Back then, investors thought U.S. demand for new computers
would be sluggish, and they were afraid of
product-development problems at various companies. Compaq
traded below $80 last December.</p>
<p>But the most recent round of earnings reports showed that
companies such as Compaq are finding strong demand for
computers outside the U.S. Compaq said in its first-quarter
report that international sales made up more than half of its
revenue for the first time.</p>
<p>Barbara Isgur, vice president at Needham & Co., says the
earnings of computer companies are in a bullish phase. Demand
from Europe should continue, while U.S. corporations are
updating their systems at a faster pace. "Corporations can't
afford to sit still," says Ms. Isgur. They "have to keep pace
with what's acceptable" in terms of computing power.</p>
<p>Compaq reported first-quarter earnings of $2.13 a share,
about three cents higher than the most-bullish analyst
estimates. Now analysts are boosting their latest estimates
for Compaq and other technology issues. Estimates for Compaq
have been revised upward to $9.31 share for 1990 from $9.11
four months ago, according to the Institutional Brokers
Estimate System, which compiles analysts' forecasts. Analysts
have hiked their 1990 earnings estimates for
personal-computer maker AST Research Inc. to $2.58 a share
from $1.98 four months ago.</p>
<p>"We see an ebullient market where it's expectations of
earnings rather than asset values driving" stock prices, says
John C. Bogle, Jr., an analyst at State Street Bank and Trust
Co.</p>
<p>While many growth-stock investors piled into technology
shares months ago, the most recent run in the stocks has been
fueled by so-called value investors. These money managers
roam through thousands of stocks in search of companies whose
shares, by various value benchmarks, are cheaper than the
overall market.</p>
<p>For the first quarter, these value investors were faced
with the grim choice of bank shares and stocks of some
commodity producers, both considered risky bets when it comes
to earnings. But lately, technology stocks have been popping
up on value investors' computers that search the markets for
cheap stocks.</p>
<p>Compaq stock, for example, is selling at about 13 times
the computer maker's 1990 earnings forecast, compared with a
price-earnings multiple of about 16 on the Standard & Poor's
500-stock index. "As a value manager, you very rarely get a
chance to buy growth stocks at current multiples," says David
Dreman, president of Dreman Value Management L.P., which owns
about 1.7 million shares of Compaq. Mr. Dreman has 15% of his
$4 billion stock portfolio plunked down in technology issues.</p>
<p>Now comes the caveat. Technology stocks go down as fast as
they go up. Mr. Bogle says one reason why technology stocks
are trading at a cheaper value than the overall market is
that they are known to be risky. Says Needham's Ms. Isgur:
"There's a hair-trigger in this sector, and that won't
change. It is inevitable that every high technology company
will hit some kind of snag, and in a fair percentage of the
cases it is a four-quarter snag. Investors don't want to hang
around while the problem works out."</p>
<p>Jack Solomon, technical analyst at Bear, Stearns & Co.,
warns that the stock market looks "frothy" with stocks like
Compaq adding $2 to $3 every day. Still, the romance of high
tech is hard to resist, he says. "When you get technology
stocks going, it infuses the ticker tape with excitement,
attracting the traders and the public," he says. Fast-moving
technology issues "broaden the participation and interest in
the stock market like few other groups can," he says.</p>
