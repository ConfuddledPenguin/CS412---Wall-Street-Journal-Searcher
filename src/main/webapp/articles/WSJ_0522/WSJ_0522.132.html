	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- American General Corp. said it "decisively"
defeated an alternative slate of directors proposed by
Torchmark Corp. at its annual meeting, but beat back a
nonbinding resolution seeking its sale by just a 56% to 42%
margin.
   Although the victory was hollow -- since the big insurance
and financial-services concern had already decided to put
itself up for sale anyway -- an American General spokesman
said the final tally "indicates our decision was totally
irrespective of the vote."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Some analysts have speculated that the company decided to
place itself on the auction block mostly because of a poor
showing in the May 2 proxy contest. But American General has
maintained that it decided to open itself to bidders to avoid
being forced into a sale to Torchmark at a depressed price.
As reported, Torchmark, a Birmingham, Ala., insurer, offered
$50 a share, or $6.3 billion, for American General, before
launching its proxy fight.</p>
<p>American General said preliminary results indicate
shareholders voted 2-to-1 to approve the company's nominees.
The slate includes three new outside directors -- Brady F.
Carruth, president and chief executive of Gulf Coast Capital
Corp.; Richard J.V. Johnson, chairman and chief executive of
the Houston Chronicle Publishing Co.; and Robert E.
Smittcamp, president and chief executive of Lyons-Magnus Co.
-- and three American General officers, including Harold S.
Hook, chairman and chief executive; Michael J. Poulous,
president; and Henry S. Romaine, vice chairman.</p>
<p>In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, American General closed at $49.125, unchanged.</p>
