	<p class="article-leader">Members Service Corp. said it filed for Chapter 11
protection from its creditors after the Internal Revenue
Service demanded full payment of more than $258,000 in
delinquent taxes.
   The company, which has holdings in telecommunications,
energy and financial services, said the filing was an effort
to "protect shareholders and employees and save the company."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Members Service said the funds sought by the agency
resulted from failure by the company to pay certain trust
fund taxes and may or may not include penalties and
interests. Leon Hooten, chairman and chief executive officer,
said the company agreed to pay the IRS $20,000 a month, but
the IRS accelerated payment. He said the company hadn't
missed any payments and was current with the debt.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the IRS said the agency is prohibited by
law from disclosing taxpayer information to third parties,
without written consent of the taxpayer.</p>
<p>In the court filing, Members Service listed assets of
almost $10 million, and combined secured and unsecured debt
at about $1 million. The IRS is listed as the company's
largest creditor.</p>
