	<p class="article-leader">DEERFIELD, Ill. -- Baxter International Inc. said it will
market nationally a new medical intravenous-therapy device
designed to sharply reduce the number of needles used in
hospitals.
   The equipment is aimed at reducing accidental needle-stick
injuries that can transmit infectious diseases, such as
acquired immune deficiency syndrome and hepatitis, to
hospital workers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The device, called the InterLink IV Access System, is
currently being used by more than 30 hospitals and evaluated
by about 200 more, Baxter said. It includes a small, blunt
plastic tube, called a cannula, that forces medication
through a companion injection cap.</p>
<p>The cannula replaces the traditional steel needle in
withdrawing drugs from vials or in administering medication
into an intravenous-administration set. While the cannula
can't be used to inject medication directly through the skin,
it replaces most of the needles used in IV therapy.</p>
<p>The system "is a very interesting device. It is the first
IV-connecting device that eliminates a needle" and could be
used to replace needles in "a very high proportion" of cases,
said Janine Jagger, an assistant professor of neurosurgery at
the University of Virginia Medical School and an expert in
the problem of needle-stick injuries. "It's a very large step
forward" in increasing the safety of hospital workers, she
said.</p>
