	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Consolidated Edison Co. of New York said it is
contemplating financings of at least $300 million of debt in
1990.
   Raymond J. McCann, executive vice president and chief
financial officer, said at the annual meeting that the
utility expects financings of another $500 million in 1991.
The financings would be used to refund maturing long-term
debt and to help fund the utility's expanded construction
fund, he said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. McCann said the availability of tax-exempt financing
is tightening and that Con Ed anticipates the new issues will
be a mix of taxable and tax-exempt debt. The plan is subject
to approval by New York's Public Service Commission.</p>
