	<p class="article-leader">GENEVA -- Constantin Phacos was an unusual success story
in the secretive, fast-money business of international
private banking.
   The slight, shy banker, who sometimes stutters when
nervous, had assembled an enviable stable of wealthy, mostly
Greek clients particularly attracted to the enormous returns
Mr. Phacos boasted from trading foreign currencies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Manufacturers Hanover Corp., anxious to become a major
player in this business, recruited Mr. Phacos in 1986 in what
seemed to have been a coup. But it was actually the first in
a series of errors that could cost the U.S. bank as much as
$50 million, making it potentially one of the largest
bank-fraud cases ever.</p>
<p>Last October, the 38-year-old Mr. Phacos was rousted out
of bed and charged by the Swiss government with embezzlement,
forgery and misappropriation of client funds. Manufacturers
says roughly 80 client accounts were apparently looted in
what it calls "an enormously complicated and sophisticated
scheme with indications of outside collusion."</p>
<p>The bank, which refuses to discuss the matter further,
took a $50 million charge against earnings last November to
cover client losses and the costs of an investigation.</p>
<p>Swiss authorities decline to discuss the charges against
Mr. Phacos, who remains in jail facing a minimum of three
years in prison if convicted, his lawyer says. The attorney,
Henri-Philippe Sambuc, concedes that his client acted
improperly in some respects but insists the money was simply
lost trading foreign currencies for clients. The attorney
says more than 160 clients were affected.</p>
<p>Interviews with people familiar with the Geneva branch and
internal documents obtained by this newspaper indicate that
whatever the outcome of Mr. Phacos's case, the Geneva scandal
is as much the result of sloppy internal controls at
Manufacturers as it is the product of a rogue employee.</p>
<p>As early as 1987, for example, the bank's outside auditor,
Peat Marwick Mitchell & Co., said that correction of
shortcomings in the Geneva branch's internal controls was "a
matter of urgency." A spokesman for what is now KPMG Peat
Marwick declined to comment.</p>
<p>Though Manufacturers declined several requests for
interviews, the company provided a brief statement asserting,
among other things, that "every warning flag was heeded" by
the bank. "We made changes in our Swiss operations each step
along the way, but, quite obviously, the measures we took
didn't succeed in preventing the fraud or uncovering it until
it had resulted in a major loss."</p>
<p>Manufacturers' Geneva debacle is in part a result of the
risks of private banking, or catering to the financial needs
of wealthy clients, which has become one of the most
lucrative and fastest growing fields in consumer banking.
Switzerland in particular is a favored locale for
private-banking operations because of the country's laws
protecting customers' privacy.</p>
<p>But wealthy individuals' passion for secrecy can give bank
auditors and officials nightmares if they don't take extra
precautions. Many of Mr. Phacos's clients, for example, left
explicit instructions that they not be sent monthly
statements or confirmation notices on trades.</p>
<p>Many wealthy individuals bar such written communication in
order to hide assets from relatives or others in their home
nations, banking industry executives say. Communication is
done only by phone or in person, and should the client let
such monitoring functions lapse, the potential for abuse is
large.</p>
<p>The Geneva embarrassment is especially galling for
Manufacturers Hanover in light of the progress it has made
shedding its image as the weak sister of the big New York
banks. In recent years, the nation's ninth-largest bank has
slimmed down, gotten a grip on its problem loans, boosted
liquidity and rebuilt capital. The banking company recently
had its debt rating raised by two major agencies at a time
many banks are being downgraded.</p>
<p>But the private-banking scandal is one of three breakdowns
in controls suffered by Manufacturers in little more than a
year. Unauthorized trading in Canadian government securities
by a bond salesman last year cost Manufacturers $14 million,
and two junior officers in the stock transfer department were
dismissed in January 1989 following the theft of $1 million
of stock.</p>
<p>Manufacturers says it has now reviewed all its security
controls world-wide, and it is severely punishing employees
who violate procedures.</p>
<p>Manufacturers opened its small Geneva office in 1985 as a
two-officer operation: one manager, one account executive and
two clerical workers. Forced by Swiss rules to hire locally,
Manufacturers soon turned to Mr. Phacos, who had a large
client pool and who, until recently, had worked for the
Geneva branch of Israel Discount Bank & Trust Co. Although he
is a Greek national, Mr. Phacos had been able to work for
several years in Switzerland because both his ex-wife and
wife are Swiss citizens.</p>
<p>At Manufacturers, Mr. Phacos performed a variety of money
management services for clients, but he was known in
particular for trading foreign currencies. According to
clients, he promised unusually high returns and, for a time,
seemed to deliver. In one spectacular two-week period, Mr.
Phacos boasted of achieving a 30% return for customers, one
former client says.</p>
<p>Word-of-mouth about such trading results brought Mr.
Phacos a stream of new clients, including his father-in-law.</p>
<p>Mr. Phacos, who declined to be interviewed, drove a new
Mercedes, lived in a fashionable Geneva neighborhood and flew
first-class on vacations. His wife, Karen, who owns a
boutique in Geneva, says her husband is "a family man. He
barbecues on weekends, drives the kids to school, gardens and
does the grocery shopping on weekends." She wouldn't discuss
the case against her husband.</p>
<p>Mr. Phacos's direct superior, Emile G. Marshi, a
silver-haired veteran banker, showed a disinclination for
paperwork and oversight, spending most of his time soliciting
corporate lending business and engaging in other
fee-generating activity, people familiar with the office say.</p>
<p>Mr. Marshi has been indicted in the Phacos affair on
charges of financial mismanagement, but he hasn't been
jailed. Following a complaint in 1987 from superiors that he
get more control over the paperwork in his office, Mr. Marshi
responded that "the account documentation has poisoned our
life here. All the staff has been working flat out for nearly
a month, giving up their lunch breaks and staying late to the
detriment of our more important work." Reached by telephone,
Mr. Marshi declined to comment on the case.</p>
<p>In fact, as internal documents show, there were
record-keeping problems and other irregularities associated
with monitoring Mr. Phacos from the time he arrived there in
1986.</p>
<p>Managers at Manufacturers' Zurich branch, which oversaw
many aspects of the Geneva office, first complained in 1986
that, in its foreign currency trades, the Geneva branch was
ignoring bank rules on margin requirements, or the amount of
cash or securities needed to serve as collateral on such
trades.</p>
<p>Peat Marwick noted as far back as 1987 that the Geneva
branch had insufficient documentation of its customers'
accounts. At one point, the branch's files were so sketchy
that only the account officer, Mr. Phacos, knew the
identities of the depositors.</p>
<p>"The files on Geneva clients need to be completed as soon
as possible," states a 1987 memo prepared by Peat Marwick.
"The most important single aspect to be documented is the
identity of each banking client; a simple statement that the
account officer concerned knows such identity is not
adequate."</p>
<p>But little seems to have been done to correct these
situations. In the first six months of 1988, for example, the
Geneva branch executed 6,000 foreign exchange trades, a
blistering pace for such a small office, industry executives
say. Cash and securities in numerous client accounts were
being pledged as collateral for the trades of other
customers, a highly unusual practice, according to industry
executives.</p>
<p>Mr. Marshi responded in 1988 to criticism from Zurich on
the handling of foreign exchange trades in a tart memo: "In
other words, your {sic} are calling me a liar. What do you
know of my business here?" In another memo on the same topic,
he wrote: "It does seem strange that after your neglect for
over a year on margins, you are now showing such zeal."</p>
<p>The Geneva branch suffered from loose controls in other
ways. To guard against fraud with "hold-mail" accounts, or
those in which the client refuses to receive written
communication from the bank, banks typically require two
employees' signatures for transactions over a certain value.
As a further protection against conspiracies, the two
signatories are always in separate departments reporting to
different bosses. Lastly, for transactions requested over the
telephone, the most dangerous type of money or securities
transfer, banks usually assign a third person to call the
client back to verify the instructions, using a codeword.</p>
<p>But at Manufacturers' Geneva office, some of these
safeguards were lacking, people familiar with the situation
say. One such "hold-mail" client asserts, for example, that
his signature was forged on forms giving Mr. Phacos total
discretion to trade his account. Peter Ioannides, a Greek
businessman, says bank investigators showed him a piece of
paper allegedly signed by him authorizing Mr. Phacos's
trading. "I immediately recognized that it wasn't my
signature," says Mr. Ioannides. "I didn't give them
permission to play the markets or anything."</p>
<p>In late 1988, Manufacturers Hanover shut down all
foreign-exchange trading in Switzerland after the Zurich
branch -- not Mr. Phacos -- suffered a $3.4 million loss from
unauthorized trading.</p>
<p>Not long afterwards, in March 1989, Mr. Marshi left
Manufacturers in a dispute over controls, according to the
bank.</p>
<p>Shortly before leaving, Mr. Marshi received a bonus of
125,000 Swiss francs, or about $86,000, according to bank
memos. (The bonus would have been even larger except for a
$13 million loss suffered by the bank on a loan to Gatoil
S.A., an oil broker introduced to the bank by Mr. Marshi.)</p>
<p>Mr. Phacos's star continued to rise after Mr. Marshi's
departure. In April 1989, he was promoted to vice president
from assistant vice president. According to clients, Mr.
Phacos boasted to them that he had surpassed management's
expectations for his performance.</p>
<p>But six months later, he was in trouble. In October of
last year, a client called requesting account balance
information while Mr. Phacos was on vacation in the U.S. At
that point, a clerk approached Francois Herve, the new branch
manager, and told him that she had been instructed by Mr.
Phacos before he left to provide the customer with an account
balance far greater than the one shown by bank records.</p>
<p>Mr. Phacos was immediately called back to Switzerland, and
a swarm of Manufacturers accountants and lawyers from New
York descended on Geneva.</p>
<p>At this same time, Nickolas A. Trechas, a Greek shipping
executive who had $1.2 million in his account at the
Manufacturers Geneva branch, made a routine checkup call to
the branch. Unable to reach Mr. Phacos and suspecting that
his conversation was being taped, Mr. Trechas left Athens for
Geneva that morning without even shaving. By the time he got
there, Mr. Phacos was in jail, and Mr. Trechas's seven-digit
account was overdrawn by $20,000.</p>
<p>For months after Mr. Phacos's arrest, Mr. Trechas's and
other customer accounts were frozen pending the
investigation, and only recently has the bank begun releasing
funds.</p>
<p>Recalling his first meeting with a banker investigating
the matter, Mr. Trechas says, "They asked me how I got my
money to the bank. Was it in a suitcase? How much did I know
about what was going on inside the branch? They were treating
me like I was accused of something]"</p>
<p>Mr. Trechas, who still hasn't gotten his money back,
laments, "I have been soaked. This is changing my whole
philosophy. I don't know who to trust."</p>
