	<p class="article-leader">Viag AG, a West German energy and commodity concern, said
its first-quarter group net income climbed 14% to 74 million
marks ($44.9 million) from 65 million marks a year earlier,
as acquisitions offset lower earnings from Viag's core
aluminum and chemicals lines.
   Most of the increase stemmed from the first-time
consolidation of Kloeckner & Co., a trading concern, and
Didier-Werke AG, a maker of industrial ceramics and
fire-resistant materials. Chemical and aluminum earnings fell
from an unusually high year-earlier level, mostly reflecting
the dollar's lower value and falling aluminum prices.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales jumped 68% to 4.48 billion marks from 2.67 billion
marks, but excluding the acquisitions, sales would have
fallen 5%.</p>
<p>Full-year sales will nearly double to about 20 billion
marks from 10.43 billion marks in 1989, Chairman Werner Lamby
said. He didn't make a profit forecast.</p>
<p>Viag revised its 1989 group profit to 265 million marks
from an initially reported 250 million marks; this represents
a 21% increase from 219 million marks in 1988.</p>
