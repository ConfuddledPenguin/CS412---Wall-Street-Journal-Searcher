	<p class="article-leader">HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Chrysler Corp. is delaying for
seven weeks the planned closing of its St. Louis I assembly
plant to fill early orders for 1991 models.
   The St. Louis plant builds Chrysler's Dodge Daytona sports
car and Chrysler LeBaron coupe and convertible. It will be
the third plant Chrysler has closed in two years as the No. 3
U.S. auto maker attempts to bring its production capacity in
line with declining sales.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Chrysler permanently closed its Kenosha, Wis., plant at
the end of 1988. Earlier this year, Chrysler closed its aging
Jefferson Avenue assembly plant in Detroit, because of slow
sales of the Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon cars built
there. Chrysler is constructing a new plant, slated to begin
production in January 1992, next to the old Jefferson Avenue
plant.</p>
<p>The company announced on Feb. 3 plans to close and
mothball St. Louis I, effective Sept. 21. Yesterday's
announcement postpones that closure to Nov. 9, providing
almost two month's extra work for some 2,300 hourly
employees. Chrysler builds minivans at a second St. Louis
plant that isn't affected by the closing.</p>
<p>The company said extending production at the St. Louis I
facility minimizes disruption of output at the plants to
which it is moving Daytona and LeBaron. Retooling to add the
cars at Newark, Del., and Sterling Heights, Mich., will start
on Dec. 21.</p>
<p>Sterling Heights, which gets Daytona, will resume
production the week of Jan. 14. Newark, which adds the
LeBaron coupe and convertible, will resume production the
week of Jan. 22.</p>
