	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- Justin L. Johnson had the name, the
credentials and the talent to write his own ticket in
Pittsburgh. The problem was that his hometown never felt like
home.
   He attended an elite local prep school and the University
of Chicago. After he graduated from Harvard Law School, he
returned to Pittsburgh, where both his father and uncle are
judges. The mayor appointed him to the civil service
commission. A local newspaper named him "one of 20 people to
watch" in 1988.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But Mr. Johnson wasn't happy here. As a successful young
black with a privileged background, he saw himself caught
between two worlds: a white corporate establishment and a
struggling black working class. He felt isolated as the only
black lawyer at his firm. He felt guilty and frustrated when
he drove through poor black neighborhoods, and he believed
that residents there resented his champagne-colored Nissan
Maxima, his Brooks Brothers suits and silk ties. He had few
peers.</p>
<p>So the 27-year-old Mr. Johnson moved to Atlanta, a city
with a thriving, self-assured black professional class. "I
had every advantage in Pittsburgh, but I really feel much
more comfortable here," he says over a steak dinner at a
downtown club, above the cooing of a jazz singer on stage.
"In Pittsburgh I was always in a white environment, and I had
the feeling of isolation. Down here, you see successful
blacks, and you feel a sense of well-being and pride."</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson's move is part of a historical reversal:
Northern blacks are continuing to return to the South that
their parents or grandparents had fled in an exodus from
oppression and economic hardship.</p>
<p>Since 1970, Atlanta, with its strong black political
leadership and high-profile black colleges, has become a
magnet for professional blacks in the North. Other Southern
cities, among them Birmingham, Ala., Little Rock, Ark., and
Raleigh, N.C., and even parts of the rural South, are also
attracting Northern blacks. For the first time in more than a
century, according to the Census Bureau, the proportion of
black Americans living in the South has risen; 56% of them
lived in the region in 1988, up from 52% in 1980.</p>
<p>Northern cities with large populations of middle-class
black people, such as New York and Chicago, have experienced
no huge exodus. But census figures tell a different story in
other cities -- Milwaukee, Detroit, St. Louis, Buffalo,
Pittsburgh and San Francisco. The data show that more black
residents moved away than moved in during the 1980s, says
James Johnson, a geography professor at the University of
California at Los Angeles.</p>
<p>For years, black residents of Northern cities have been
moving to the suburbs for better housing and to escape
inner-city crime and deprivation. Others have joined the
white migration to the Sun Belt for largely economic reasons.
But among black professionals already established in their
careers -- lawyers, executives, accountants, bankers and
others -- moving South seems often motivated by a desire to
become part of a larger community of successful black
residents with a richer cultural and social life than they
had experienced in the North.</p>
<p>Few harbor any illusion that racism has disappeared in the
South, even in Atlanta. "Blacks have lost that sense of naive
dreaming that either the North or the South is perfect," says
Reagan Charles Wilson, a professor at the University of
Mississippi and author of the Encyclopedia of Southern
Culture. While few blacks may have been so naive, about 6.5
million blacks left the South to settle in Northern cities
between 1910 and 1970.</p>
<p>To some black residents, racial tensions in the North seem
wider than before. Anne Maria Hardeman, an engineer and
artist who lived in Boston, still recalls the fear she
experienced in an incident in 1984 when she was jeered at,
called "nigger" and pushed to the ground by a group of whites
as she was walking through the parking lot at Fenway Park one
evening. "{White} people were walking on the sidewalk near
me. They just kept walking," says Ms. Hardeman, who has since
moved to San Jose, Calif.</p>
<p>Edward Barnette, also from the Boston area, is in the
process of transferring to Atlanta for the sake of his
daughter. While in the Boston area, Mr. Barnette lived in a
spacious house on a six-acre lot in suburban Boston, earned a
six-figure salary for a large corporation, employed a nanny
for his three-year-old daughter, Camille. She has attended a
private suburban preschool, where she has been one of only a
handful of black children.</p>
<p>When Mr. Barnette recently complimented Camille for an
accomplishment, she replied, "I'm not smart, Daddy. Don't say
I am." Mr. Barnette was stunned. He believes she had picked
up signals that she wasn't as intelligent as her white
classmates. "If all the people she comes in contact with are
white, she won't have an appreciation for her own people," he
says. "Camille is somewhat standoffish when she's around
black people. It absolutely crushes me."</p>
<p>Eric Thompson quit his job last year at a Mellon Bank
office in Pittsburgh, where, he says, he was the only black
in a 60-employee division, and he took a job in Atlanta. The
29-year-old accountant previously had worked at Price
Waterhouse in Pittsburgh, where he was the only black among
300 employees, he says. (Price Waterhouse says there were
actually five blacks among 275 employees when Mr. Thompson
left in 1986.) Mr. Thompson says he visited many companies in
the area when he worked for Price Waterhouse, "and I never
saw any blacks. I saw one in Dayton, Ohio, and she was a
secretary."</p>
<p>At Mellon, Mr. Thompson rarely joined his colleagues for
happy hours. For one thing, he doesn't drink. But he also
felt awkward as the only black customer in bars that played
country and Western or rock music. He prefers jazz.</p>
<p>His evenings and weekends weren't much better. There isn't
much nightlife that appeals to black professionals in
Pittsburgh. One of the few nightclubs catering to them is 15
miles outside the city. Singles often have a hard time
finding one another.</p>
<p>The soft-spoken Mr. Thompson would roam shopping malls by
himself to kill time. Or he would go to movies. "That was
prime time on my calendar," he says. Then there was midnight
bowling with a friend or two. But since he moved to Atlanta
last year, he has been so busy with jazz concerts, church
events and other activities that he hasn't been to the lanes.</p>
<p>Before he moved to Atlanta, Mr. Thompson had to overcome
his childhood impressions of the South as hostile towards
blacks. Growing up in Washington, D.C., he saw televison
footage of blacks succumbing to husky sheriffs and
white-robed racists. Each summer, when his family drove
through rural Alabama to visit his grandparents, he saw
wooden, paint-flecked houses with tin roofs, shoeless
children sitting on dilapidated front porches and the swirl
of dust from dirt roads.</p>
<p>"Every child after high school graduation wanted to go
North," recalls his mother, Vera Thompson, who grew up in
Beatrice, Ala., and moved to Washington after she married.
"They wanted freedom; they wanted a job. There was nothing
(in Beatrice) except work in the field."</p>
<p>Mr. Thompson found a very different South when he walked
into the Coca-Cola Co. headquarters last year for a job
interview. His first impression: the throng of black
professionals in the building. During the interview, he asked
what positions high-ranking blacks filled. Back at Mellon, he
says, he was dismayed that blacks didn't work in
revenue-generating jobs. While Mellon can't provide numbers,
the bank says the notion that no blacks work in
revenue-producing jobs is absurd.</p>
<p>In any case, Mr. Thompson says that at Coke "you see
blacks in positions where they have an effect on the bottom
line." And in Atlanta, there is comfort in numbers. The
city's black population has increased by 24%, to 605,000,
since 1980.</p>
<p>At Coke, Mr. Thompson is one of six blacks in a 30-member
department, which also includes Hispanics and other
minorities. The corporate culture gets high marks all around;
the cafeteria, Mr. Thompson says, serves Southern food --
fried chicken and greens.</p>
<p>Mr. Thompson met his girlfriend in the company's legal
department. He lives in a luxury apartment with a swimming
pool and tennis courts. Dressed in a dark suit, he sips
cranberry juice in Mr. V's, an elegant and very crowded
nightclub that attracts mostly black patrons. "I would have
had to be a pioneer in Pittsburgh to make a mark," he says
above the din of rhythm and blues music, "but in Atlanta,
there were some doors that were already wide open."</p>
<p>Says Willie Thornton, an assistant professor at Emory
University, who recently moved to Atlanta after receiving a
Ph.D. in finance at Harvard University: "In Atlanta there is
a very visible black middle class. When someone sees you on
the street, you could be a city councilman just as easily as
a mugger. In Boston, people are less quick to think of you as
a professional."</p>
<p>Some see a danger in the migration of black professionals
from Northern cities. "My greatest despair is to see those
who see racism and flee," says Harry Johnson, manager of
corporate communications at Polaroid Corp. in Cambridge,
Mass. "If Boston is as impoverished of black professionals as
they say, then we need them . . . to bring new ideas, new
commitment and passion."</p>
<p>Lawyer Justin Johnson's decision to leave Pittsburgh
bewildered his father, state Judge Justin M. Johnson, who
felt the Johnson name would have opened many doors in
Pittsburgh. A lifelong Pittsburgh resident, Mr. Johnson never
felt he had to leave the city for a better life, and he
doesn't understand his son's captivation with Atlanta's
social scene.</p>
<p>"I was brought up to understand that the greatest value
was in doing hard work and doing a good job, and if you got
pleasure, that was incidental," he says from his office, the
walls lined with family photos. "I can't imagine moving from
one community to the next because there's not a lot of people
from a particular group to have quality relaxation time."</p>
<p>Nonetheless, he knows that times have changed. He has seen
pictures of his son laughing with friends on a boat in a
lake. Those experiences are important, he says, "but I never
had that."</p>
<p>For his part, the younger Mr. Johnson, who works for
Alston & Bird, one of Atlanta's largest law firms, knows he
is taking a professional risk. "When I came back to
Pittsburgh (from law school), there was all this good will I
could draw on," he says, "but the city still couldn't make me
happy."</p>
