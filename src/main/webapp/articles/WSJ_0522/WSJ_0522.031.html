	<p class="article-leader">Luxembourg banking authorities said they found no grounds
for taking legal action against BCCI Holdings (Luxembourg)
S.A., the parent of Bank of Credit & Commerce International,
which pleaded guilty in January to money laundering in the
U.S.
   Luxembourg officials appointed a panel of magistrates to
study the matter shortly after the bank pleaded guilty in
Tampa, Fla., to charges that it had obscured the origins of
more than $14 million of drug money. Though the legal case
didn't directly involve the Luxembourg holding company, it
created embarrassing publicity for Luxembourg, which has long
sought to dispel the notion that its bank-secrecy laws
provide cover for money launderers and other financial
criminals.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yves Mersch, director of Luxembourg's Treasury Ministry,
said in a telephone interview that the magistrates and
government officials concluded that the U.S. court case
reflected the actions of "individuals at a branch {of BCCI}
and not a policy which would have been made in Luxembourg."</p>
<p>In addition, he said, only people -- not companies -- have
legal liability under Luxembourg law, and BCCI officials in
the grand duchy weren't charged with any offenses in the
Florida case.</p>
<p>After BCCI's guilty plea was announced, Mr. Mersch said,
Luxembourg officials told the holding company that they
expected it to stop using the grand duchy as its legal
headquarters for its world-wide network, which is managed by
officials in London and elsewhere. BCCI's current
restructuring program appears to satisfy Luxembourg's demand,
Mr. Mersch said.</p>
