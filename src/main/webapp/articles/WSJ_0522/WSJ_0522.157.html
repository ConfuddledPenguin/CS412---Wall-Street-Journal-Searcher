	<p class="article-leader">CLEVELAND -- Premier Industrial Corp. expects to show a
modest increase in sales and earnings for the fiscal fourth
quarter, which will produce record results for the May 31
fiscal year, Morton L. Mandel, chairman and chief executive
officer, said in an interview.
   The company's sales growth has been slow for the last nine
months, reflecting the slowdown in the U.S. economic
expansion, Mr. Mandel said. In recent weeks, orders appear to
be picking up a little, he said, but there hasn't yet been a
marked change.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The distributor of electronic parts and industrial-repair
and maintenance products expects a fourth-quarter sales
increase slightly greater than the 2.2% rise of the third
period, Mr. Mandel said. It is too early to make a specific
profit estimate for the quarter, he said, but there will be
an increase from the $19.3 million, or 33 cents a share, of
the comparable 1989 period.</p>
<p>Mr. Mandel said analysts' estimates that earnings for the
fiscal year "will approach $1.30 a share" appear to be
reasonable, but final figures won't be available for several
months. Fiscal 1990 sales will be in the area of $620
million, he said.</p>
<p>In fiscal 1989, Premier earned $69.7 million, or $1.13 a
share, on sales of $596.1 million. Share earnings for 1989
periods are adjusted for a 3-for-2 stock split effective Dec.
22, 1989.</p>
<p>Premier's fiscal 1990 per-share earnings will be based on
an average of about 58 million shares outstanding, down from
an adjusted 61.7 million shares in fiscal 1989. The company
in November of 1988 retired 5,850,000 shares, after adjusting
for the split, as part of a $117 million cash distribution to
shareholders.</p>
<p>Premier expects to achieve record sales and earnings again
in fiscal 1991, if the general economy doesn't deteriorate,
Mr. Mandel said.</p>
