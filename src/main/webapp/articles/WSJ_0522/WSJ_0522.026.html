	<p class="article-leader">New York -- Attention Marla Maples: Playboy would like to
see more of you. Not to put too fine a point on it, Marla,
Playboy would like to photograph you nude. So would
Penthouse. And come to think of it, add High Society to the
list.
   It is unending, the search for truth, justice and the
celebrity nude photograph. And as Gary Cole, photography
editor of Playboy, has learned through the years, it's often
easier to scope out truth and justice than a famous -- or
notorious -- woman sans culottes. But there are ways, there
are ways.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Cole favors the direct approach: phoning the
celebrity's agent and pleading his case. "Marla Maples's
agent said he would communicate our interest in her," said
Mr. Cole, who views Donald Trump's supposed girlfriend as "an
obvious Playboy type." "We've pursued a variety of other
contacts to communicate our interest in her," he added.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Cole, such matters frequently hinge on
the attitude of the intermediary. If the go-between is
enthusiastic or has the confidence of the celebrity at just
the right moment, it could make a difference. "My experience
has taught me to keep pursuing even if someone says no," said
Mr. Cole, "because on another day the answer might be
different."</p>
<p>So it proved with Jessica Hahn, secretary and inamorata of
PTL ministry head Jim Bakker. "It was a case of Jessica being
hounded the way Marla was," said Mr. Cole. "It was difficult
to get our voice heard amidst all the shouting. Ms. Hahn's
first lawyer wasn't buying Playboy's blandishments, but when
the former secretary changed counsel, Playboy found a more
sympathetic ear. "We could have a conversation with him,"
said Mr. Cole. "Jessica was predisposed to do it all along
and once we were able to tell our story and what we wanted to
do, it all started to fall into place."</p>
<p>Singer LaToya Jackson, a desirable subject because of the
public's fascination with her brother Michael, was a tougher
sell. Initially, neither Ms. Jackson nor her manager evinced
interest in Playboy's proposition, "but I got a nice rapport
going with the manager and he and I talked several times over
the course of months," said Mr. Cole. "I kept suggesting it
and he kind of warmed to it even though LaToya was reluctant.
She was modest and she wasn't sure she could get in front of
the camera without her clothes."</p>
<p>To allay Ms. Jackson's concerns, Mr. Cole sent her
examples of previous Playboy layouts of Raquel Welch and
Marilyn Monroe, "those in the upper echelon of celebrity
status," he explained. "And she felt if they did it she could
do it."</p>
<p>Actresses unwilling to pose for fear of looking like a
bimbo in limbo, have disrobed to help promote their latest
movie. As a star in training, Kim Basinger sat for Playboy in
connection with "Never Say Never Again." Nastassia Kinski
with "Exposed," Rae Dawn Chong with "Quest for Fire" and
Sonia Braga with "Gabriela." Pia Zadora displayed her charms
for Penthouse when she starred in "The Lonely Lady."</p>
<p>According to Ms. Maples's agent, Chuck Jones, Marla has no
intention of accepting Playboy's offer. "We're not promoting
anything with Marla," he said. "She's not promoting a movie
or a book. That's not to say she'd do a nude layout in
Playboy under any circumstances. She has strict standards."</p>
<p>When a celebrity has strict standards, magazines do have
other options. One such option is prayer. Editors pray that
nude photos of their quarry (taken in days of more relaxed
standards) are lying in a photographer's file. Then they pray
that the photographer unearths the glossies, has the proper
releases and doesn't first call a competing publication.</p>
<p>"It doesn't require a lot of work on our part to get such
pictures," said Jane Homlish, special assistant to Penthouse
founder and editor Bob Guccione. "Photographers know we can
afford to pay more than the other magazines," she added,
declining to give exact dollar amounts.</p>
<p>"If photos are around, we'd be among the one or two
magazines to have a photographer knocking on our door," said
Gloria Leonard, publisher of High Society.</p>
<p>"If anyone's got a nude picture of Marla Maples somewhere
in a file we could pretty much depend on their finding us,"
said Playboy's Mr. Cole.</p>
<p>So it would seem. A photographer with provocative photos
of Donna Rice offered them to Playboy when the would-be model
was linked with presidential hopeful Gary Hart. Several years
ago, when a photographer went to see "Desperately Seeking
Susan" and recognized the film's star, Madonna, as one of his
nude subjects, he telephoned Playboy. Ditto the photographer
who shot the infamous series of pictures starring Vanessa
Williams. (The photos subsequently found their way to
Penthouse because Playboy editor Hugh Hefner reportedly
didn't want to be the guy responsible for bringing down the
first black Miss America.) A photographer with photos of
Vanna White in sheer black-and-white lingerie made the shots
available to High Society. (Playboy also ran provocative
shots of the Wheel of Fortune hostess.) And recently, Playboy
got a call from the photographer's assistant on the Marilyn
Monroe calendar shoot, proffering a picture he'd snapped of
the late star.</p>
<p>When there is a dearth of photographers dialing for
dollars, the magazines try other avenues. Ms. Leonard tells
of a man in Baltimore whose avocation is hunting down photos
of well-known women in various stages of undress. Movie
projection operators, she says, often tip off the magazine to
good material, as do devoted readers. "There are people all
over who will see something on cable or in a European
magazine. A lot of celebrities will do layouts over there but
not here," said Ms. Leonard, whose magazine has paid as much
as $20,000 for a photo.</p>
<p>Playboy also relies on readers' eternal vigilance. One
subscriber called, saying he'd spotted an enticing photo of
soap star Susan Lucci somewhere and advised the magazine to
investigate the matter further. Another reader was watching
when actress Sally Kirkland lost her top on a talk show, and
captured the moment for Playboy on videocassette.</p>
<p>Former boyfriends are another source. Not too long ago,
the former beau of B-52 member Cindy Wilson called Playboy
with 10-year-old nude photos of the singer. "I said that
first we'd have to find out who owned the copyright," said
Playboy's assistant photography editor, Patty Beaudet.
"That's an important question."</p>
<p>There's another important question: How do the magazines
square their desire to boost sales with the pain they might
be inflicting on the unsuspecting subject of a nude layout?</p>
<p>"The way you have to look at these things is if someone
posed for pictures and signed a release as a mature adult,
she'd have to think at some point a photographer might want
to sell the pictures," said Penthouse's Ms. Homlish. "If
later the model changed her mind it shouldn't be our fault."</p>
<p>For its part, High Society won't run shots without a
release "unless it's a public person in a public place," said
Ms. Leonard. Playboy said it won't run pictures of ANYONE
unaware that photos were being taken. "It's a question of
taste and legality," said Playboy's film editor, Bruce
Williamson, who's been offered more than his share of photos
shot on the beach or through a peephole.</p>
<p>While Mr. Cole and Ms. Leonard doubt the existence of nude
Marla Maples photos -- if such pictures existed they surely
would have surfaced by now goes the thinking -- Penthouse has
not abandoned hope. "I wouldn't be surprised if something was
out there," said Ms. Homlish stoutly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Manhattan photographer Andrew Unangst is
hitting himself over the head with a tripod. Several months
ago, Marla Maples came into his studios to pose for some test
shots, "and I didn't have time to take them. I would have
been offered up in the thousands for a nude of Marla," said
Mr. Unangst, acknowledging that Ms. Maples didn't quite seem
the sort of girl who'd pose nude. "It would have been like
winning the lottery. I could have bought an apartment in
Trump Tower."</p>
