	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The World Bank and its affiliate, the
International Development Association, approved $96.7 million
in loans to India for health centers and population-control
projects in rural areas.
   In other actions, the IDA cleared a $16.1 million credit
to Bolivia to help finance and expand closely held
manufacturing enterprises, and a $14 million loan to Western
Samoa to rebuild roads damaged by a cyclone that hit the
Pacific island nation in February.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The credits, including most of the financing for the
projects in India, will be interest-free except for small
administrative fees. The World Bank will provide $10 million
of the loans to India at a variable interest rate, currently
7.75% a year.</p>
