	<h3>Your Money Matters: Hybrids for Investors Blend Mutual Funds, Partnerships</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">Mutual funds are mutual funds, and limited partnerships
are limited partnerships, right?
   Not always. There are also some partnerships that look
like funds, and these hybrids are drawing investor attention
just now because of a marketing push by two companies that
offer them.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. took out full-page newspaper
ads last week to launch a mutual-fund limited partnership
called the Advisors Fund. It will employ fancy, but
high-risk, trading techniques usually not available to
individuals with less than $1 million to invest.</p>
<p>In another ad campaign, Dreyfus Corp. is promoting its
U.S. Guaranteed Money Market Account by waiving the usual
management fee for the next few months. Although the fund
looks like an ordinary money-market fund, it too is a limited
partnership.</p>
<p>Because such funds are structured as partnerships, rather
than corporations, they offer some investors tax breaks they
can't get in ordinary mutual funds. Unlike most partnerships,
partnership funds also make it easy for investors to sell
their holdings.</p>
<p>But partnership funds also have some unique drawbacks,
including more paperwork when investors file their tax
returns. For that reason alone, "if you're a small investor,
you probably want to shy away from these things," says Joseph
Mansueto, president of Morningstar Inc., a Chicago company
that tracks mutual funds.</p>
<p>Partnership funds aren't a new idea. New York-based
Dreyfus offers seven such funds using the format -- with a
fund operator as general partner and shareholders as limited
partners -- that it pioneered more than a decade ago. In all,
there are 17 or so mutual-fund partnerships, according to
Lipper Analytical Services Inc., which also tracks mutual
funds. They invest in everything from money-market
instruments to stocks, bonds and foreign currencies.</p>
<p>Perhaps because these partnerships are more difficult for
most investors to understand than ordinary mutual funds,
"none of these funds has attracted a lot of dollars," says A.
Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical. Nearly all of
them have less than $100 million of assets.</p>
<p>A bigger reason why they have languished may be lackluster
performance. On the whole, Mr. Lipper says, returns have been
"no better, no worse" than ordinary funds.</p>
<p>Shearson's new partnership fund is probably the last of
the breed. Starting in 1998, these partnership funds will be
taxed as corporations, thanks to the 1987 tax act. The
Shearson partnership fund was in the works before the tax-law
change and so, was grandfathered.</p>
<p>When the grandfather benefits run out after 1997, such
funds are likely to reorganize as ordinary funds or
disappear, sponsors say. The partnerships are more expensive
for them to offer because, as general partners, they must put
up 1% of a partnership's capital themselves. Without the tax
advantages partnerships currently enjoy, fund operators won't
have much incentive to continue them.</p>
<p>"We'll be sorry to see them go," says Duane E. Waldenburg,
a vice president and a director of Boston-based Eaton Vance
Inc., which has four of the partnerships. "We think they are
neat products from an investor's point of view, and the
advantages outweigh the disadvantages." In the meantime,
partnership funds do have some special advantages over
ordinary funds. But the value of those advantages may be open
to question as far as many investors are concerned.</p>
<p>For example, investors in partnership funds that buy
Treasury securities escape taxes on the income in all 43
states that tax investment income. But only seven of those 43
states -- Connecticut, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Delaware,
Mississippi, North Dakota and Tennessee -- don't permit that
exemption for mutual funds that buy Treasurys, according to
the Investment Company Institute, a Washington, D.C.,
mutual-fund trade group.</p>
<p>Foreign investors in partnership funds also escape federal
income taxes on government securities and corporate bonds. In
mutual funds, that income becomes taxable corporate
dividends.</p>
<p>The partnership structure also allows aggressive money
managers to employ derring-do trading strategies that
managers of ordinary mutual funds can't without running afoul
of tax laws. Those include the so-called short-short rule
that imposes taxes on ordinary mutual funds that derive more
than 30% of their profits from securities held less than
three months.</p>
<p>The new Shearson Advisors Fund, for instance, will be
managed by five independent portfolio managers who, while
investing primarily in stocks, will be free to dart in and
out of the market, trade currencies, options and futures,
engage in short-selling and buy shares on margin.
Short-selling involves borrowing securities and selling them
in the hope they can be repurchased later at lower prices.
The fund's $25,000 minimum, while steep compared with most
mutual funds, could open the sophisticated investing style to
many smaller investors for the first time.</p>
<p>Such trading tactics don't guarantee better performance,
however. Dreyfus Strategic Aggressive, a "flexible" fund that
allocates its investments across several asset classes, had
an 831% portfolio-turnover rate in 1988, says Mr. Lipper. Yet
its net asset value rose only 5.11% that year, while the
average flexible fund had a 9.62% gain.</p>
<p>The managers hired for the Shearson Advisors Fund have an
unusual incentive to do well. Their annual management fees
will hinge on whether they beat the stock market's
performance, as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock
index. To earn their maximum annual fee of 4% of the fund's
assets, they must outperform the index by six percentage
points, after deducting all fund expenses.</p>
<p>That fee is much steeper than the management fees most
mutual-fund investors typically pay. But the Shearson fund
managers' fees can also drop to zero if the fund fails to
beat the S&P 500 by four points, after expenses.</p>
<p>"If a traditional mutual-fund manager makes money, you pay
a fee. And if he loses money, you pay a fee," says Ronald L.
Gallatin, a Shearson managing director. "Here, if the guys
perform poorly versus the S&P 500, they don't get paid."</p>
<p>At tax time, partnership-fund investors, like investors in
ordinary limited partnerships, must decipher an annual
Schedule K-1. The partnership funds' K-1s usually have fewer
items than those for real estate or other ordinary
partnerships. Indeed, the K-1 for a partnership fund that
invests only in government securities "shouldn't be more
complicated than the 1099 for a normal mutual fund," says
Daniel MacLean, Dreyfus general counsel.</p>
<p>For other funds, though, the extra tax work can be more
burdensome, says Morningstar's Mr. Mansueto. "K-1s are a
hassle," he says."For some reason, they're usually the last
bit of tax information you're waiting on to do your return."</p>
