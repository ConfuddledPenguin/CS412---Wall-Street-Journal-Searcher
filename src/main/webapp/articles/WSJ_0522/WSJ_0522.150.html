	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The chances of recession have declined
within the past three months and the current business
expansion will break the postwar record for longevity,
according to a survey of business economists.
   Not only did 82% of the panel forecast no recession
through 1991, but two-thirds of the group foresaw no
recession at all during the next three years. If that
prediction were to materialize, the current expansion -- now
90 months -- would break the February 1961-December 1969
record for the longest postwar period of economic growth.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The quarterly survey of 68 members of the National
Association of Business Economists reflects forecasts made in
April and May.</p>
<p>Although there will be no recession, the economists say,
the outlook for 1990 is for slower economic growth than in
1989. They expect the economy to grow an inflation-adjusted
2% this year, compared with 3% in 1989. For 1991, they expect
growth of 2.4%.</p>
<p>The outlook for inflation this year is slightly bleaker,
too. The panel is forecasting a 4.7% rise in the consumer
price index this year. In a winter survey, they projected a
4.2% inflation rate. In 1989, consumer prices rose 4.6%.</p>
<p>The panel said its forecasters are significantly less
optimistic about growth and interest rates than the Bush
administration.</p>
