	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- Canadian retail sales in October fell 0.3% to a
seasonally adjusted 16.12 billion Canadian dollars (US$13.91
billion) from September, Statistics Canada, a federal agency,
said.
   This marked the third consecutive monthly drop. The
October decline was partly attributed to weak auto sales.</p>

building permits in October rose 5.5% from September.</p>
