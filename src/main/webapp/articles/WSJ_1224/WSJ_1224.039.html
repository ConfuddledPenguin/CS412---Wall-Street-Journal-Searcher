	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- U.S. companies are being allowed to import
Iranian oil on a case-by-case basis, but payments for the oil
must go to an escrow fund for U.S. claims against Iran.
   A State Department spokesman said that under a
one-month-old ruling, U.S. companies may apply for a license
to import the oil, as permitted under a 1987 Treasury
Department regulation allowing certain transactions with
Iran. Previously, a trade embargo prohibited U.S. companies
from buying Iranian oil.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The escrow fund was established in 1981 as part of the
Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal, which arbitrates commercial
disputes between the two nations. The security account is
used to pay awards determined by the tribunal to the U.S.
government for claims, the department spokesman said.</p>
<p>The Iranian government is obligated to keep the security
account funded at $500 million or higher, the department
said. Since the fund was established, $2 billion in claims
have been paid from the fund to U.S. claimants.</p>
<p>"If such transactions occur, this will help insure there
are adequate funds available to pay tribunal awards to U.S.
claimants," the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The decision was made last month, and approved by
President Bush. The State Department spokesman didn't know if
any U.S. company had taken advantage of the ruling.</p>
