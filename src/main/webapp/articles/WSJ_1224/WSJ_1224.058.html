	<p class="article-leader">What's so terrible about a deal with Saddam? ("The Risks
of a Deal With Saddam," by Karen Elliott House, editorial
page, Dec. 11.) We lived for decades with Stalin and Mao
Tse-tung and their successors. They were two of the worst
killers of history, both had nuclear capability, and both
engendered world instability.
   War should be an option only in a clearcut case of
self-defense. Vindicating the slaughter of Kuwaitis by
allowing Saddam's soldiers to kill American troops without
due process is a compounding of injustices. Other tyrants who
remain unpunished include Kim Il Sung, Pol Pot, Idi Amin,
Castro, Gadhafi, Ortega, Assad, Mengistu and a host of
African rulers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Our problem involves retreating from a posture we never
should have assumed. After Aug. 2, Mr. Bush sent troops and
forged an alliance to stop Saddam. But he also broadcast
ultimatums, went on vacation and traveled around the world
telegraphing "business as usual." While he refused to be
inconvenienced by Saddam, he disrupted the lives of tens of
thousands of American families to bolster his bravado. Other
nations were more cautious.</p>
<p>We should have soldiers from the Arab League replace our
troops immediately and quit sacred Arab soil before Ramadan.
Let Arabs make deals with Saddam if they wish. If we try it
on Saddam's turf he will surely get the upper hand. At best,
we should offer to destroy Saddam's munitions factories from
the air, and let Arabs do the mopping up. OPEC self-interest
will ensure us of oil at market prices. And continued Arab
squabbling will be Israel's best defense. Establishing that
scenario would constitute real world leadership.</p>

<p>Ms. House's superb article should be required reading for
all who would stay Mr. Bush's enforcement of the U.N.
resolution. How stupid can we be if we do not learn from
history? Those who were here in 1938 will long remember when
Neville Chamberlain prevailed over Churchill's call for
action to prevent Sudeten aggression. That appeasement
brought the world an agony costing millions of lives,
including six million innocent Jews.</p>
<p>Are we to repeat the same mistake by leaving another
megalomaniac aggressor in power with his fighting force
intact? Surely the early victims will be the peoples of
Israel and Saudi Arabia; the Kurds of Iraq may be liquidated
genocidally.</p>
<p>Let the younger generation of Sam Nunns repair to the
history books to learn the mistakes of 1938 and act
accordingly.</p>

<p>The events Ms. House writes about are the most frightening
since Sept. 30, 1938, when Chamberlain returned from Munich
with "peace for our time." Had he stood Hitler down, World
War II would have been fought -- if at all -- on the
Czech-German border. Instead, wishful-thinking cowardice led
to a world-wide conflagration and millions of deaths.</p>
<p>I cannot believe that this ghastly lesson has been
forgotten so soon or that even Congress could sink so low as
to prevent Mr. Bush from taking out this menace,
providentially revealed for what he is, while there is still
time. But if it does, if Saddam's international crime is
allowed to pay, then the bright new order that seemed sure to
follow on the close of the Cold War is in great jeopardy.</p>
<p>Many reasons have been advanced for our standing up to
Saddam, but the soundest one is that the end of our
confrontation with Marxist totalitarianism makes possible the
development of the U.N. into what it was always meant to be:
a world federation keeping some kind of order. The day of
anarchy among nations has passed: We can do each other too
much harm too quickly for it to continue. If we falter now,
there may be other chances, but, as with World War II, the
price of taking them can only be higher, perhaps much higher.</p>
