	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Transportation Department extended the
rules governing airline computer reservation systems to Nov.
30, 1991, to allow for further study.
   The rules, which were to expire next Monday, are intended
to foster competition. They include requirements that
participation in the systems be open to all carriers on a
nondiscriminatory basis and that schedule information be
organized in an unbiased manner.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Critics of the rules -- including the Justice Department,
travel agents and some airlines -- contend that
anti-competitive practices still flourish.</p>
