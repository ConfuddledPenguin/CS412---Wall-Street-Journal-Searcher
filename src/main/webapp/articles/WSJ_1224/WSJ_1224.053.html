	<p class="article-leader">CINCINNATI -- Kroger Co. said it will extend until 5 p.m.
Jan. 9 its offer to bondholders to exchange their 15 1/2%
junior subordinated discount debentures for a new,
cash-interest-paying bond.
   The offer, announced on Nov. 5, was initially set to
expire on Dec. 5, but was extended to last Thursday. This
latest move is being made because holders have tendered less
than the required $150 million principal amount. Terms call
for the supermarket chain to give bondholders between $575
and $660 principal amount of a new 13 1/2% junior
subordinated debenture, due 2003, for each $1,000 face value
of the 15 1/2% junior subordinated discount debentures
distributed as part of the company's 1988 restructuring.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Kroger said it won't extend the time for odd-lot holders,
who will receive a cash payment equal to the higher of a $590
minimum, or the price obtained for the debentures when they
are sold. Kroger said it expects to begin mailing payments to
the odd-lot holders on Jan. 2.</p>
