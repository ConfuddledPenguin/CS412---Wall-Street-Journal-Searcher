	<p class="article-leader">Warehouse Club Inc. said in Chicago that its earlier
agreement to sell about a 51% stake to Great Atlantic &
Pacific Tea Co. for $11 million has been terminated.
   Under the tentative accord announced last month,
loss-plagued Warehouse Club was to issue 7.3 million new
shares to A&P. "No other transaction between Warehouse Club
and A&P is presently contemplated," the company said Friday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Warehouse Club didn't say why the deal collapsed, or
whether it intends to seek another investor. Warehouse
operates 10 stores that sell merchandise at wholesale or
near-wholesale prices; A&P is a supermarket chain.</p>
<p>Officials at A&P, of Montvale, N.J., couldn't be reached
for comment. A&P is 52%-owned by the Tengelmann Group of
Germany.</p>
