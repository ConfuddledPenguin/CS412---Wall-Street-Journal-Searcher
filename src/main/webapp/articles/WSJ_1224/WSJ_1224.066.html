	<p class="article-leader">MONTREAL -- The end of long strikes last week at several
newsprint mills in eastern Canada could wipe out a scheduled
5% newsprint price increase in the U.S. and Canada, analysts
and industry executives said.
   Downward pressure on prices would cheer struggling
newspaper publishers and hurt the North American newsprint
industry, which is trying to climb out of a cyclical slump.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The price increase will probably take effect Jan. 1 as
planned, analysts and industry executives said. But after the
reopened Canadian mills return to full operations in January,
producers will likely have to offer bigger discounts from the
list price or formally roll back the price increase, they
said.</p>
<p>"The world is going to be afloat in newsprint," said Homer
Taylor, vice president, supply at Knight-Ridder Inc. "I can't
imagine how the price increase will go through."</p>
<p>Led by Stone Container Corp., most major North American
newsprint producers announced this fall that they would raise
the benchmark eastern U.S. list price to $720 a metric ton
from $685 Jan 1. A metric ton equals about 2,204.6 pounds.</p>
<p>Newsprint isn't sold at list price. Standard discounts
from list range from 16% to as much as 22%, analysts and
industry executives said. At an 18% discount, a buyer
currently paying about $562 a metric ton would pay about $590
a metric ton if the Jan. 1 increase holds.</p>
<p>Newsprint producers raised list prices by about 5% June 1,
their first increase in more than two years. They made that
price increase stick largely due to the threat of strikes at
mills in eastern Canada, many analysts and newsprint buyers
said.</p>
