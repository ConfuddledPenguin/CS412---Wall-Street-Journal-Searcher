	<p class="article-leader">"In God We Trust" is inscribed on the coin and currency we
all work for. Do we trust in God? Do you? Should we pay more
attention to this motto we all carry with us?
   It seems to be inscribed in the minds and hearts of many
of our business and political leaders. Total self-reliance is
not how things actually work. For example, Secretary of State
James Baker acknowledges that in the diplomatic power game
there is always a higher power. At the annual National Prayer
Breakfast in Washington, D.C., in February, he was quoted as
saying: "Inner security and true real fulfillment comes by
faith. It doesn't come by wielding power in a town where
power is king." He candidly stated that his wife had helped
him cope with a personal problem by teaching him to pray and
helping him to realize his true position in life. "I really
needed to stop trying to play God and turn the matter over to
Him."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Walter Hoving, the head of Tiffany's from 1955 to 1980,
died last year at age 91. He built sales during his tenure
from $7 million to $100 million. Convinced that his entire
career was guided by God, he had Tiffany's produce small
silver-plate pins (later expanded to include sterling silver,
Vermeil and gold) with the message "Try God" spelled out.</p>
<p>Was Mr. Hoving merely an eccentric business success? Is
James Baker just a little unusual? It seems not. The ranks of
American industry and government are studded with the names
of successful leaders who are not afraid to state their firm
belief in God and then, of greater importance, to act
according to that belief.</p>
<p>Peter Grace, formerly of W. R. Grace Inc., has never been
shy about his association with the Catholic Church and its
works in the New York archdiocese. Perhaps in his
environmentally sensitive business, he needed all the help he
could get.</p>
<p>Tom Phillips, of Raytheon, famous for its air defense
systems and now making great strides in air-traffic control,
started a prayer-breakfast group in the mid-1980s that still
meets today. Forty or so business leaders gather to discuss
ethical or spiritual topics or hear an inspirational talk at
this little-publicized forum. Ken Olsen, of Digital Equipment
Corp., is reported to be a regular attendee. Now that IBM has
its sights locked on DEC's once-invulnerable market niche,
Mr. Olsen has a great deal for which to pray.</p>
<p>At the worker level, in many companies there are small
scripture-study gatherings that meet at lunchtime. Wang
Laboratories has such a group, and who can say whether that
had something to do with its modest comeback in profitability
after its recent reorganization?</p>
<p>Of course, most people would prefer to keep their
religious beliefs separate from their careers. But it's
impossible to compartmentalize one's life completely. Our
Constitution separates church and state, and it would be wise
not to designate a company religion. It is, however,
difficult for many of us to deny the impact of the workings
of God in the world -- and that includes the business world.
Worship on the weekend and business-as-usual the rest of the
week isn't how things work.</p>
<p>Can you deny the existence of God and his workings in the
world and succeed in at least a secular monetary sense? Yes.
Free will allows the world to operate in its own mysterious
way. In fact, some might argue that the bottom line
necessitates an occasional departure from strict application
of God's rules -- an approach to which Edwin Land, the
founder of Polaroid, had a ready response. At one
shareholders' meeting in 1977, he responded to desperate
reports of a product reversal by saying, "The bottom line is
in heaven."</p>
<p>Indeed, the role of providence in decisions and outcomes
should not be overlooked. We are all told how important
timing is in business, yet no one has any idea how to be at
the right place at the right time. Some will say luck is a
big factor (always combined with hard work). If so, perhaps
the business schools should teach a two-semester course in
luck. (First semester, good luck; second semester, bad luck.)
It would go well with a companion set of courses on timing.
(First semester, too soon; second semester, too late.)</p>
<p>It is difficult to attribute specifics in business
directly to God. It is equally difficult to deny his
involvement. (You can, of course, if you choose to])</p>
<p>It is human nature to turn to God in difficult or
impossible times (referred to as "fox-hole religion" in
wartime). If, as the saying goes, "God is my co-pilot," why
not let him take over? Many do. It is a higher form of human
nature to turn to God in good times.</p>
<p>Why do so many well-known and successful executives feel
that God is a dominant force in their lives and in their
businesses? The ethics of everyday operations and how people
should be treated are issues that are not covered very well
in business schools or in most management books. On the other
hand, students of management study the traits of successful
leaders. We might do well to study the practices of
executives who rely on God.</p>
<p>Mr. Hoving's little pins carry a powerful message: "Try
God." Why not? In this holy season, it would be wise to
reflect on this message. Prayer as a management technique
should not be discounted.</p>
