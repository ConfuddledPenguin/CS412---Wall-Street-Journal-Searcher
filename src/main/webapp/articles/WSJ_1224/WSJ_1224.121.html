	<p class="article-leader">Sears Canada Inc., the 62%-owned unit of Sears, Roebuck &
Co. of the U.S., will report a fourth-quarter charge related
to its recently completed voluntary staff-reduction program,
said Joseph Reddington, president and chief executive officer
of the Toronto retailer.
   "More people than were anticipated actually did accept the
voluntary severance package," Mr. Reddington said. He
declined to estimate the size of the charge.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sears Canada offered the voluntary severance to all
full-time employees in Eastern Canada in an effort to pare
about 1,000 jobs.</p>
<p>Mr. Reddington said earnings will be well below last
year's 10.6 million Canadian dollars (U.S.$9.2 million), or
C$1.23 a share. Revenue for 1990 will be little changed from
last year's C$4.56 billion, he said.</p>
