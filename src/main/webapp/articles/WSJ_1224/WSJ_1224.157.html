	<p class="article-leader">J.M. Peters Co. said its fiscal third-quarter revenue fell
45% to $40 million, resulting in a net loss of $7.1 million,
or 51 cents a share.
   The loss included a $3.1 million write-down on undeveloped
land the company has agreed to sell. The property is in
escrow and the sale is set to close early next year, the
company said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the third quarter ended Nov. 30, 1989, the Newport
Beach, Calif., home building concern had net income of $5.7
million, or 41 cents a share, on revenue of $72.4 million.</p>
<p>The company said its latest results "continue to mirror
the downturn in sales for single family move-up housing
throughout most of Southern California." Increased finance
and marketing costs on the company's unsold homes also
contributed to the loss. Gross profit percentages on sales
was 8.8% compared with 21.3% a year earlier.</p>
<p>In the first nine months, the company had a net loss of $6
million, or 43 cents a share, compared with year-earlier net
income of $14.2 million, or $1.02 a share. Revenue fell 14%
to $161.9 million from $188.2 million.</p>
