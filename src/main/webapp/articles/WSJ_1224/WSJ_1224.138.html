	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said Canada's
federal system must undergo "substantial change" to meet the
demands of Quebecers and other Canadians.
   He said at a news conference that "the alternative to a
fundamentally reformed Canada is probably no Canada."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Mulroney didn't indicate what specific changes might
be made in the federal system. But he said he is confident
that "we will be able to devise a more modern, flexible brand
of federalism that will accommodate the desires and
aspirations of all Canadians."</p>
<p>The largely French-speaking province of Quebec is
preparing demands for more autonomy, backed by polls showing
record support for Quebec's gaining independence. In western
Canada, protest movements are demanding constitutional
changes to give western provinces greater influence in
Canada's Parliament.</p>
<p>Mr. Mulroney said Quebec separatists would like a vote on
Quebec independence immediately. They want "to strike while
the iron appears to be hot," he said, but added, "It isn't
going to work that way."</p>
<p>He said the federal government will deal in an orderly way
with the constitutional demands. He attributed the current
constitutional grievances to the failure of the provinces to
ratify the Meech Lake constitutional accord earlier this
year. The proposed accord would have granted new powers to
the provinces and recognized Quebec as a "distinct society"
within Canada.</p>
