	<p class="article-leader">CAIRO -- The contrast isn't lost on the people of this
city: 25,000 mostly dirt-poor Egyptian troops dispatched to
the Saudi Arabian desert to protect a wealthy way of life
unknown back home. In today's Gulf crisis, Arab "have-nots"
are defending the "haves."
   Shabaan Abdel Kader, an unemployed father of four in
Cairo, reflects on the gap between rich and poor and shakes
his head. The oil nations "used their money to raise the
quality of living of their own people and to invest in Europe
and the U.S. -- and gave crumbs to the Egyptians," he says
bitterly.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Kader's is just one in a chorus of Arab voices
frustrated by the disparity. Saddam Hussein's populist
rhetoric about forcing the Gulf states to share their wealth
may be self-serving, but it hits a raw nerve in many Arab
countries, particularly this one. In business and newspaper
offices, government ministries and cafes, people here are
sniping at the "insensitive super rich of the Arab world" and
the "rotten monarchies" for not investing more of their oil
windfalls in Arab countries. In the minds of many Arab and
Western leaders, regional stability in the post-crisis era
will partly depend on resolving these tensions.</p>
<p>The contrast in life styles in the Mideast is indeed
stark, especially when the comparison is with Egypt. In
Cairo's streets, a curly-haired urchin carries a naked infant
and begs for food from tourists. A river of sewer water clogs
a downtown street for days. A retiree explodes at a butcher
over the price of meat. In the oil-rich realm of the Gulf,
such scenes are virtually absent among the tidy villas, the
superhighways and the brimming store shelves. In the wealthy
United Arab Emirates, per capita income is $15,720 a year and
in Qatar it is $11,610; in Egypt, the figure is just $650.</p>
<p>Sipping coffee at a restaurant overlooking the Nile River,
a retired Egyptian diplomat named Tahseen Basheer sees a need
for redistributing some of the Arab World's wealth. He
believes the oil states should allot 10% of their annual
income to an Arab development and defense fund. "The money
the rich Arabs were dumping in buying houses in Beverly Hills
and Cannes and indulging in massive, atrocious
superconsumerism only alienated the people and led to
continued destabilization," Mr. Basheer says.</p>
<p>Ideas like his are also getting plenty of currency outside
Egypt, notably in Jordan, where King Hussein has called on
the Gulf states to share the wealth. The U.S. State
Department, too, is said to be considering ways to persuade
the Gulf Arabs to better distribute their oil earnings after
the crisis, in hopes that doing so will foster development
and stability in the region. Stability is on everyone's mind.
"If there is no real solution to the problems of the economy
of this country, nobody can guarantee the future of the
political regime," warns Phillip Gallab, editor of a leftist
newspaper in Egypt.</p>
<p>Egyptians imagine that Saddam Hussein is gloating in
Baghdad over the new economic frustration he is causing here.
Hundreds of thousands of Egyptian workers have fled home to
Egypt from jobs in Iraq and Kuwait, and many aren't finding
work.</p>
<p>"The children are now asking me questions, like `why can't
we have that kind of food?'" says Saeed Rifaah, a 40-year-old
father of five who left Kuwait and is out of luck in Cairo.
He can't get a job, much less a bank loan to restart his
construction business or open a shop. He has switched his
children from private schools to inferior, government-run
ones and is borrowing money from relatives to make ends meet.
"It's very embarrassing for a father," Mr. Rifaah says.</p>
<p>It doesn't take long for these economic frustrations to
pick up political overtones. Abdel Basit Mohamed, 52,
supported three families back home in Egypt with his
construction job in Kuwait. When bread got hard to find
following Iraq's invasion, he went back to Egypt, carrying
only a few clothes and about $150. Now he looks for work,
along with three million unemployed people in the country,
and wonders how he will make the next payment on his new
flat, which he proudly notes even has a kitchen.</p>
<p>"It's the government's responsibility to create these
jobs," fumes Mr. Mohamed, clutching a grocery sack to his
long robe. "There's such a shortage of housing here that
young people can't find houses to get married. The government
should use all of this desert land to build houses, and this
would create jobs. I'm a taxpayer and I should be paid back."</p>
<p>His solution isn't far from what academics and business
officials propose in agitating for a bigger share of the
Gulf's oil income. What they envision is long-term investment
and development aid and an economic integration of Arab
nations similar to the European Community.</p>
<p>"It's not a matter of cash being transferred from Riyadh
to Cairo -- that doesn't mean development," says Ali
Dessouki, a political scientist at Cairo University. "We need
serious industrialization, education, joint ventures with
public and private-sector companies." And that holds true not
just for Egypt, he says, but for those cash-strapped Arab
countries now sympathizing with Iraq.</p>
<p>To be fair, the Gulf Arabs -- with the notable exception
of Iraq -- have donated considerable amounts of money since
they struck oil. According to the World Bank, Saudi Arabia
and Kuwait lead the world in the percentage of gross national
product dedicated to aid to poorer nations (not all of them
in the Arab world).</p>
<p>In addition, the Saudis in particular are famous for
handing out occasional huge sums under the table to buy
favors or protection in the Mideast. Just before Saddam
Hussein invaded, the emir of Kuwait helped finance the
purchase of boatloads of wheat for Egypt. Saudi officials
said early this month they are giving President Hosni Mubarak
$1.5 billion in financial assistance to help pay Egypt's
debts and finance development projects.</p>
<p>But as Butrous Ghali, Egypt's minister of state for
foreign affairs, notes, Arab aid to Egypt traditionally has
been "nothing to compare with what we receive from non-Arab
countries" such as the U.S. and Japan. (In fiscal 1990 alone,
the U.S. gave Egypt $2.2 billion in economic and military
grants and $360 million in loans and credit guarantees.)</p>
<p>Most Egyptians have learned about the extent of the wealth
in the Gulf from friends or relatives who have worked there.
Sherif al Mazen was one of those workers. Serving guava juice
and chocolates in his Cairo parlor, he reminisces about the
life he led as a computer science professor at Kuwait
University: no traffic jams, no housing shortage, no air
pollution and little difference between what the poor and
rich ate.</p>
<p>He also recalls -- with some fondness -- the rife
consumerism of many Kuwaitis. There were the elaborate villas
for extended families -- "you can actually call them palaces"
-- and the appetite for Mercedes-Benzes and BMWs. "If you
went to the Kuwait University campus, you'd find the most
elegant and prestigious cars were those of the students, not
the professors," he says. It was a far cry from life in
Cairo.</p>
<p>Without some help, life in his native country is likely to
simply get worse. Egypt's population of 54 million is
ballooning about 3% a year. The country still owes $36
billion in foreign debt and hasn't been able to make all of
its debt repayments. Inflation is sprinting along at more
than 20% a year. And with foreign exchange in short supply,
the country sometimes has been unable to buy enough raw
materials for its factories. Before receiving recent aid,
Egypt was even scrambling to find credits to import wheat for
bread, the mainstay of the diet here.</p>
<p>The country's relatively modest oil industry is benefiting
from the Gulf crisis, of course. But even if the price of
crude oil surged to, say, $40 a barrel, and stayed there for
a year, the windfall would offset only $1.8 billion of the
$4.5 billion the government estimates it is losing annually
because of the crisis. The costs to Egypt of the rising
tensions have been immediate: Tourism dropped, toll-paying
traffic through the Suez Canal fell and the amount of money
sent home by Egyptians working abroad plummeted.</p>
<p>In the flood of workers back from the Gulf, the hardest to
accommodate will be the professionals. There simply aren't
enough well-paying jobs. Mostafa al-Ridi, an Egyptian lawyer
who fled Kuwait, says he has been offered a position as a
sales manager in Cairo, making just 4% of what he earned as a
financial account manager in Kuwait. For now, he prefers to
wait in hopes of getting back his Kuwaiti job.</p>
<p>The thousands of returnees like him will further tax this
country's already strained housing, school and medical
programs. So it is that more Egyptians are calling for a
longer-term solution to their country's chronic financial
problems, and a bigger role in that solution for the oil-rich
Gulf states.</p>
<p>But will the wealthy Arab nations go along? Thanks largely
to the current crisis, exiled Kuwaiti officials have lately
sounded more egalitarian than ever. "I assure you that our
intention is to have more economic cooperation with Egypt,"
says Kuwait's ambassador in Cairo, Abdel Razak al Kandari. "A
new Arab system should be established from all angles:
political, economic and security." Perhaps as a sign of good
faith, Kuwait's exiled government, along with Saudi Arabia,
Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, now have written off more
than $7 billion in Egyptian debt that they had stubbornly
refused to forgive for years.</p>
<p>Makram Mohammed Ahmed, editor of Egypt's al-Musower
magazine and a confidant of President Mubarak, says there
ultimately is no other path for the rich Gulf states but to
share more of their wealth. "What kind of choice do they have
for their security?" he asks. "They have a big fortune but
few people. . . . They must change or they will be changed."</p>
