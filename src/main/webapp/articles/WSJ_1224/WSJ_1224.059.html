	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- GW Utilities Ltd. said its board agreed to the
terms of a 125.7 million Canadian dollar (U.S.$108.5 million)
proposal by Toronto's Reichmann family to buy out the
company's minority shareholders.
   The offer was made by the Reichmann's closely held holding
company, Olympia & York Developments Ltd., which already owns
89.3% of GW Utilities. Olympia & York has offered C$30 a
share. GW Utilities shareholders also will receive a special
dividend of C$10 a share following the sale of the company's
82% stake in Consumers' Gas Ltd. to British Gas PLC.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Separately, British Gas said it has completed the
acquisition of 99% of the shares of Consumers' Gas, a natural
gas distributor based in Toronto. The British Gas bid closed
Thursday.</p>
<p>The buy-out of GW Utilities is subject to the approval of
the minority shareholders at a meeting scheduled for next
March.</p>
<p>The buy-out also is conditioned on regulatory approval and
the completion of a proposed reorganization of Olympia &
York's energy holdings. The company has proposed to spin off
Interprovincial Pipe Line Ltd. and Home Oil Co. as separate
public companies by the first quarter of 1991.</p>
<p>Interprovincial and Home Oil are units of Calgary,
Alberta-based Interhome Energy Inc., which is, in turn, owned
40.7% by GW Utilities, 22.8% by Gulf Canada Resources Ltd.,
and 0.5% by Olympia & York. Olympia & York controls Gulf
Canada.</p>
