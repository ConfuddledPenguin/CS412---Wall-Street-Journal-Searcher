	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve policy makers were unanimous
in deciding to lower interest rates in mid-November, amid
mounting evidence of recession and indications that the
inflation rate was stabilizing, the Fed disclosed.
   Despite some differences, all 11 voting members of the
Fed's open market committee agreed that the softening economy
called for cutting rates immediately and for tilting toward
lower rates in the following weeks, according to a summary of
the Nov. 13 meeting.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Fed pushed down the federal funds rate, the rates that
banks charge on loans to each other, by 1/4 percentage point
after the meeting and by another 1/4 percentage point in
early December.</p>
<p>Following a meeting of the committee last week, the Fed
pushed down the fed funds rate by another 1/4 percentage
point, bringing it to about 7%. Also last week, the Fed cut
the discount rate, the rate it charges on loans to banks, by
1/2 percentage point to 6.5%. The Fed will release a summary
of last week's deliberations in February.</p>
<p>In mid-November, Fed economists were projecting "a mild
downturn," but they anticipated that economic growth would
resume during the first six months of 1991. Not all the Fed
policy makers were so optimistic, though. "Many of the
{committee} members noted that, while the most likely outcome
was a relatively mild and brief downturn, there were risks of
a more severe or prolonged contraction," the summary said.</p>
<p>One continuing concern was the credit crunch or, as the
Fed put it, "the increased reluctance of institutional
lenders to accommodate less-than-prime business borrowers."
Also figuring in the decision was weaker-than-anticipated
growth in the money supply.</p>
<p>The summary said that a "few" of the committee members
were urging the Fed to move gingerly. Though they were
willing to ease credit conditions slightly, they were
reluctant to give Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan leeway to make
a second move toward lower rates. Still, those who had
objected earlier in the year to easing credit conditions,
including Fed governor Wayne Angell and Cleveland Fed
president Lee Hoskins, didn't dissent.</p>
<p>The voting members of the Fed's open-market committee are
the six current Fed governors and five of the 12 district Fed
bank presidents. The other seven presidents participate in
the discussions.</p>
