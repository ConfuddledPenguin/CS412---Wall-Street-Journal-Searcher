	<p class="article-leader">Star States Corp. said it expects a loss of $22 million to
$28 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting a provision for
loan losses and a write-down.
   The Wilmington, Del., financial and leasing services
concern said that $12 million to $18 million would reflect
potential loan losses and that it would write down about $8.5
million for the carrying value of certain intangible assets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company said it expects a loss of $70 million to $76
million for the year. In the year-ago fourth quarter, Star
States earned $1.6 million, or 34 cents a share. For 1989, it
reported a loss of $5.8 million, or $1.23 a share.</p>
<p>"While we believe this loss provision will result in an
accurate reflection of the value of the company's loan
portfolio and financial condition today, we realize that the
real estate market is volatile and that further deterioration
in the economy could result in additional loan losses in the
future," said Marvin N. Schoenhals, president and chief
executive officer.</p>
