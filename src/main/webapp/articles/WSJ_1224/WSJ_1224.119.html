	<p class="article-leader">Ashland Oil Inc., citing depressed petroleum refining
margins, said it expects to post a loss for its first quarter
ending next Monday.
   In the year-earlier fiscal first period, the Ashland, Ky.,
oil refiner earned $22 million, or 40 cents a share, on
revenue of $2.04 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Refining margins have been depressed and declined
throughout the quarter, as petroleum markets have tried to
adjust to the volatility brought on by the Persian Gulf
crisis," Ashland said. Also, it said significant maintenance
turarounds were performed at two of the company's refineries
during the quarter. Ashland said demand for gasoline and
heating oil dropped considerably in October and November,
which hurt refinery margins. Though crude oil prices have
declined in recent weeks, they haven't fallen as far or as
quickly as product prices, Ashland said.</p>
<p>Ashland said it "remains cautiously optimistic" about the
outlook for fiscal 1991 ending Sept. 30, but it wasn't more
specific.</p>
