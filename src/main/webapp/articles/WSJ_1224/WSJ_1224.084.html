	<p class="article-leader">OLD GREENWICH, Conn. -- Publicker Industries Inc. said the
U.S. government, at the request of the Environmental
Protection Agency, filed suit against the company and two
other undisclosed parties in federal court in Philadelphia.
   The suit relates to cleanup costs at a former Publicker
storage facility in Philadelphia where the EPA has allegedly
spent more than $22 million under the federal Superfund Act.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A spokesman for Publicker said the extent of the company's
liability wasn't known. But the company has said that if it
is determined to be liable for any "significant portion" of
the amounts sought by the U.S., it could have a "material
adverse effect" on the financial condition of the alcohol and
chemical company.</p>
