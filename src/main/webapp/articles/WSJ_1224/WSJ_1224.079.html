	<h3>Enterprise: Holidays Are Time for Firms To Be Vigilant</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">It was nearly Christmas by the time one small East Coast
retailer realized he was being robbed.
   A warehouse supervisor hired as temporary holiday help in
October had seemed the model employee. He stayed late most
nights to help with the Christmas rush, cleaning up after his
seven subordinates left. His job application showed
experience running warehouses, and he was pleasant and
energetic.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the employee was a hard-core thief. When several
$8,000 fur coats turned up missing, Jack L. Hayes, a
Stanfordville, N.Y., security consultant, posted a watch
behind the warehouse late one night -- and caught the
supervisor tucking coats into his car. The man didn't have
the experience claimed on his application, but the business
owner had "never bothered to check," Mr. Hayes says. "And I'm
sure the employee knew that."</p>
<p>For many small businesses, 'tis the season to be wary.
Small-business owners are especially vulnerable to an
increased risk of internal fraud and theft during the
holidays, and many are ill-prepared to cope. A flood of
seasonal transactions and gifts can mask increased employee
theft or payoffs. Holiday bills tempt employees to
dishonesty. An increase in temporary workers invites crime.</p>
<p>A lack of internal safeguards compounds the problem. "The
small-business owner tends to put more trust in his employees
and have fewer controls. He may not even see certain signs"
of crime, says E. John Keller, a risk-assessment consultant
in Southlake, Texas.</p>
<p>The consequences can be dire. Inventory shrinkage averages
about 1.9% for retailers nationwide, but losses among small
retailers average 2.5% to 3%, with the biggest share
occurring around Christmas, Mr. Hayes estimates. Other kinds
of small businesses face increased risk as well, and most
lack fidelity bonds and other forms of loss insurance.</p>
<p>"Many Fortune 500 companies can afford to take a pretty
good hit" from a dishonest employee, says Dennis Dalton, a
Fremont, Calif., security consultant. "But for many smaller
companies, any hit is catastrophic."</p>
<p>The risk is highest now. Holiday bills and stress often
aggravate employees' personal problems, increasing the
incentive to steal, says Thomas W. Kulawiak, an audit partner
with Grant Thornton, accountants and management consultants
based in Chicago.</p>
<p>After her boyfriend lost his job, an employee for a small
Midwestern insurance company stole $75,000 from her firm one
Christmas to pay the bills and finance his growing drug
habit. The worker used customers' checks to cover her thefts
from the petty cash fund and destroyed the customers' account
statements to keep them in the dark. Then, in a kind of
pyramid scheme, she hid the fraud by intercepting payments
from other customers and applying them to the deficit
accounts.</p>
<p>Many small businesses shelve loss-prevention programs
during the holidays. "They have a tendency to be caught up in
the Christmas rush, and they feel they're too busy to
concentrate on things like that," Mr. Hayes says.</p>
<p>Amid the rush, many businesses fail to detect common
cash-register abuses: making fraudulent refunds, voiding
transactions and pocketing the cash, or "sweethearting" --
charging a friend or accomplice a sharply reduced price. When
a small, exclusive East Coast formal-wear retailer left one
of its employees in charge of the store, the woman stole
$75,000 by voiding customer purchases and falsifying
receipts.</p>
<p>Lengthened holiday business hours make many small
retailers turn their stores over to seasonal workers in the
evening. An inexperienced manager, often a high school
student or a recent graduate, can face heavy peer pressure to
hand out free merchandise or cash. "It becomes kind of an
early Christmas," says Mr. Dalton.</p>
<p>"Backdoor losses" from a warehouse or distribution center
can mushroom over the holidays as well. One small retailer
lost $25,000 in men's suits because two unsupervised
warehouse workers were colluding to prepare false shipping
labels and send merchandise to friends' addresses.</p>
<p>The sheer volume of business associated with the holidays
can mask a multitude of sins. Payoffs by buyers or purchasing
agents are often missed in a flood of seasonal gifts and
greetings. "This is the time of year when nice gifts are
going fast and furious between buyers and vendors," says John
Kula, head of fraud and security consulting for Arthur
Andersen & Co. "At Christmastime, the cash payments get
bigger, and the gifts tend to get more substantial. People
have a greater need."</p>
<p>Dishonest deals struck by purchasing agents earlier in the
year, during the heavy Christmas buying season, often haunt
the small business around Christmas, when "there certainly
can be more of a problem with shoddy merchandise," says Mr.
Dalton. "The trucks may start rolling into the distribution
center loaded with millions of billiard tables or no-speed
bicycles, and the business owner may wonder, `Hey, what's
wrong with this picture? Did we really order this stuff?'"</p>
<p>One small automotive-parts distributor lost more than
$100,000 before its purchasing agent was caught approving a
phony invoice for a rebuilt truck engine. "The engine never
came in, but he OK'd it anyway," says Mr. Hayes, who turned
the case over to prosecutors.</p>
<p>Small businesses are particularly vulnerable because they
tend to trust employees more. A small south Florida retailer
couldn't believe that a star saleswoman could be causing its
missing-merchandise problem. She had been "employee of the
year" for three consecutive years. The business owner was
incredulous when the woman admitted to outside investigators
that she had given away $900,000 in free shirts to friends,
says Read Hayes, a Winter Park, Fla., security consultant.</p>
<p>Small-business owners often assume they know their
employees better than they do. A vice president in charge of
purchasing for a family-owned jewelry-store chain in Texas
was arrested by Dallas police for consorting with a
prostitute. The employee had been stealing diamonds and using
them to pay prostitutes and raise cash for drugs. "He used to
come to work high. It should have been a huge red flag" for
the business owners, says Mr. Kula of Arthur Andersen.</p>
<p>When employees have personal problems, many small-business
owners "tend to think in terms of, `What is my obligation?
How should I help the employee?' instead of `What should I
lock down? He might be stealing me blind,'" Mr. Kula says.</p>
<p>The pressure on employees during a busy season often makes
small-business executives reluctant to enforce basic rules.
One fast-growing New York computer dealer rewarded its
frazzled employees by reimbursing them for dinner if they
worked late. But the company's chief financial officer had
paid the controller for hundreds of dollars in dinners he
never ate before the business's owner noticed that the
controller wasn't turning in receipts.</p>
<p>"The controller was working hard, and the CFO didn't want
to hassle him," says Anthony Morris, a Boston
computer-industry strategy consultant.</p>
