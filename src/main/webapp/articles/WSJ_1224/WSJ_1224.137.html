	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- The Justice Department said it expects to
receive "substantial assistance" in its investigations of
thrift fraud from Edwin T. McBirney III, former owner of the
defunct Sunbelt Savings Association of Texas.
   Mr. McBirney will cooperate with federal prosecutors as
part of an agreement under which he will plead guilty to bank
fraud and three other federal criminal charges. The plea
agreement was filed Friday in federal court in Dallas.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. McBirney is valuable to the prosecutors because of his
extensive dealings with other thrifts and their executives
during the four years that he was chairman and chief
executive officer of Sunbelt Savings. Sunbelt made 145 loans
totaling $523.3 million to the directors, officers and
shareholders of other thrifts, according to thrift
regulators, who tallied Sunbelt's total losses at more than
$2 billion.</p>
<p>Among the now-failed thrifts that were involved in real
estate and loan transactions with Sunbelt and Mr. McBirney
were San Jacinto Savings Association of Houston, a unit of
Southmark Corp. until its seizure last month by thrift
regulators; Independent American Savings Association, which
was owned by Thomas R. Gaubert of Dallas; and Western Savings
Association of Dallas, formerly owned by Jarrett E. Woods Jr.</p>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation has acknowledged an
ongoing criminal investigation of San Jacinto, and Mr.
Gaubert has remained a target of federal prosecutors despite
his acquittal in October 1988 on charges related to loans
from a now-defunct Iowa thrift. Mr. Woods is scheduled for
trial in January on 37 charges related to the failure of
Western Savings, which had extensive dealings with Sunbelt in
loans and real estate transactions.</p>
<p>A loan agreement between Western and Sunbelt is at the
heart of the bank-fraud charge to which Mr. McBirney has
agreed to plead guilty. Mr. McBirney also agreed to plead
guilty to charges that he filed a false tax return on behalf
of one of his companies, Amchase Financial Corp.; that he
caused a false statement to be made to Sunbelt; and that he
misapplied $250,000 in thrift funds in connection with an
unspecified loan.</p>
<p>The four charges carry a maximum possible sentence of 15
years in federal prison, well below the 85-year sentence that
Mr. McBirney could have faced if he had been convicted of all
17 charges contained in his indictment last July.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors agreed to delay Mr. McBirney's
sentencing for up to two years, according to his attorney,
Paul E. Coggins of Dallas. The delay will give Mr. McBirney a
greater impetus to cooperate and underscores the importance
the Justice Department is placing on his help.</p>
<p>Mr. Coggins said negotiations of a plea agreement had
begun before Mr. McBirney's indictment but an actual deal
wasn't struck and signed until Nov. 16.</p>
<p>The filing of the agreement was delayed until Friday to
avoid influencing the Dallas federal jury that was hearing
testimony in the trial of another former Texas thrift owner,
Don R. Dixon.</p>
<p>The jury convicted Mr. Dixon Thursday on 23 charges
related to the misuse of funds from the defunct Vernon
Savings & Loan Association, which he owned. Mr. Dixon faces a
maximum possible prison term of 120 years at his sentencing,
scheduled for February.</p>
<p>In Washington, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said,
"Bringing to justice top S&L executives such as McBirney and
Dixon belies the myth that those at the top can avoid
prosecution for their criminal acts."</p>
