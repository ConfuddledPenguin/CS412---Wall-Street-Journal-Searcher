	<p class="article-leader">Bridgestone Corp. of Japan, a tire maker, lowered its
forecasts for 1990 net income and consolidated sales.
   Bridgestone said 1990 profit will amount to 10 billion yen
($74.1 million), which is off 50% from the company's initial
prediction in March of 20 billion yen. Sales are expected to
reach 1.78 trillion yen ($13.19 billion), or 1.1% less than
the initial forecast of 1.8 trillion yen.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In 1989, Bridgestone earned 9.6 billion yen on sales of
1.69 trillion yen.</p>
<p>For its latest revision, Bridgestone cited soft market
conditions in North America and Europe, with weak customer
demand in the replacement-tire market and decreased new-auto
production. It said the lower forecasts also were prompted by
the suspension of natural rubber operations in Liberia, as a
result of that country's civil war, and increased production
costs owing to a rise in raw materials prices.</p>
