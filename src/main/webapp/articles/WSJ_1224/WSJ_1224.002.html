come?
   Never before on television has there been a show so
unflinchingly somber, so unrelentingly devoted to death and
pain as "China Beach," ABC's hour-long dramatic series about
a Vietnam surgery and rehab unit. No doubt that's why "China
Beach" has always lingered near the bottom of the ratings. No
doubt that's why, this month, in its fourth season, the
program was put "on hiatus," which is a nice way of easing it
off the air. (A few scattered episodes remain to be broadcast
later.)</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But "China Beach" was no ordinary series. Tracing the
stories of the nurses and entertainers of the R&R facility
connected with the U.S. base at Da Nang" -- your in-country
Miami Beach" -- "China Beach," in a sense, picked up where
"MASH" left off, looking at the war behind the front lines.
In this case, the war was Vietnam, and there was little
comedy, even black comedy, here.</p>
<p>As a show, "China Beach" was never afraid to slap its
viewers across the face: "Some guy's telling you about his
hometown one second, the next second you're scraping him off
your sunglasses." Yet perhaps because the program focused
primarily on the women of war, it was a strangely appealing
blend of hard and soft, of cold metal and warm shoulders. At
the center was the delightful Dana Delany as Colleen
McMurphy, a nurse both tough and fragile, picking her way
through the debris field.</p>
<p>This season, after many of the Vietnam stories had been
played out, the show took an interesting turn, flashing
backward and forward to examine the aftermath of the war for
the veterans. From anti-Vietnam protests to the trial of the
Chicago Seven, it looked at how the last days of the war
played out on the home front -- especially the strange sense
of dislocation felt by many of the returning men and women.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some of these flash-forwards seemed oddly
wrongheaded -- quantum leaps to nowhere -- especially a
postwar McMurphy reincarnated as a leatherclad biker working
for an orange-juice company. But when it came to the scars
left in the wake of combat, this series, co-created by John
Sacret Young and William Broyles Jr., was right on target: "A
couple of guys on the plane home started a game. They called
it `Nightmares.' Whoever could get to Seattle without having
a bad dream would collect 20 bucks from the rest. I won. It
was easy. I didn't sleep the whole flight home."</p>
<p>More than most war treatments, "China Beach" was about
psychological, not physical, pain. Of course, in a medium of
closeups like television, emotion is a dangerously overused
commodity. And all too often, what TV offers is a quick,
cheap tearjerking, the disease-of-the-week variety. But this
year, as "China Beach" got sadder and sadder -- more and more
depressing -- it just got better.</p>
<p>One of the best hours -- in fact, one of the single finest
installments of dramatic episodic TV in a long time -- was
this season's "Escape," written by Paris Qualles. Following
Private Samuel "Sammy B." Beckett from childhood to middle
age, it opened with him as a small boy in his father's North
Carolina church, at the funeral for his mother. "How are the
dead raised up?" Beckett's father asks the congregation, "and
with what body do they come?" For all of Beckett's tears that
day, his mother is no Lazarus.</p>
<p>Ten years later finds Beckett an infantryman in Vietnam,
wisecracking in the face of mortar fire. Already jaded, dying
is a bad joke to him. Not so his buddy Linford "Dead Man"
Crawford, who is so fixated on his mortality that he's
constantly handing over a taped version of his will every
time he hears rifle fire.</p>
<p>On leave at China Beach together, they liberate a corpse
from the morgue in a prank, but get caught, and end up
re-assigned to the morgue full time. "You kill 'em, we chill
'em," jokes Beckett. "It's disrespectful, playing with the
dead," says the earnest Crawford. Hey, says Beckett, "when
the time comes we're all just fertilizer."</p>
<p>In a way, this body-bag show is the most explicit spelling
out of a theme that runs through the "Beach." Like all the
episodes, it's about death (vividly so, with fermenting
bodies in the morgue), but like all of them, it's really
about faith, about looking for some kind of redemption in the
middle of a truckful of suffering. For Beckett, it takes the
suicide of his friend Crawford to crack his callous cynicism,
to plunge him so far down he can come out the other side, and
find a human, if not religious, faith.</p>
<p>"China Beach" didn't stop there -- it got grimmer.
Subsequent episodes like "A Small Step"' showed a series
regular, the lifeguard Boonie, rolling over a landmine and
losing his leg. He returns home an amputee. "The stump's
looking good," the doctors tell him. The message here: The
guy in the next bed's much worse off. He's got no arms and no
legs. "Don't let them use you for third base," Boonie jokes.</p>
<p>In a time of escapist entertainment, "China Beach" didn't
give its viewers much in the way of escape. It took them into
the morgue of Vietnam, and stuck their noses right in among
the body bags. Rich, powerful and deeply felt, it throttled
its viewers, but every once in a while -- a rare and
wonderful thing on television -- it also offered some kind of
catharsis too, a chance to walk into the morgue and walk back
out the other end.</p>
<p>So how are the dead raised up? Ironically, despite the
ratings failure, "China Beach's" co-creators, Messrs. Broyles
and Young, are being given the same Saturday-evening time
slot to try a new series, "Under Cover," a hard-edged look at
the CIA that premieres in January.</p>
<p>But as for "China Beach," don't expect it to come back for
another full season. This, then, is something of a eulogy for
a sad and lovely show that was finally so dark that few could
bear to watch it.</p>
