	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Japan and Germany are barely lifting a
finger to help the U.S. in the Persian Gulf crisis, and the
Bush administration appears to be letting them get away with
it.
   As a result, economic resentment against the two powerful
nations likely will merge with anti-war sentiment in a
formidable challenge to President Bush's Gulf policy. Even
though Congress is in recess, lawmakers already are lining up
to complain. And the House and Senate budget committees are
planning to tackle the question of the allies' contribution
in high-profile hearings next month.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The issue is already beginning to reflect badly on two of
President Bush's closest confidants: Secretary of State James
Baker, who negotiated the German support, and Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady, who negotiated the Japanese
contribution. Neither man has publicly chided those nations
for their performance. And behind the scenes, aides to each
man accuse the other of making mistakes.</p>
<p>So far, criticism has focused on the meager pledges of aid
Mr. Baker and Mr. Brady secured from the two economic giants.
As neither Germany nor Japan is committing troops to the
Gulf, the only way to measure their contribution is in
financial terms. Germany is dipping into its $1.4
trillion-a-year economy for just $1 billion for the U.S. and
about $2 billion for other nations. And Japan's pledges of $2
billion for the U.S. and $2 billion for poor nations are
infinitesimal given its $2.8 trillion gross national product.</p>
<p>So far, the U.S. has spent about $6.5 billion; and
estimates of the total cost of Operation Desert Shield top
$30 billion.</p>
<p>But the story is even worse than it seems. Soon, attention
will focus on lesser-known details of the allied aid, which
show that, in certain respects, it's even paltrier than it
seemed at first glance.</p>
<p>For instance, it turns out that much of the supposedly new
military equipment being sent by Germany to U.S. forces is
actually cast-off gear from the defunct East German army.
"It's perfectly good equipment," says German embassy
spokesman Hans-Henning Horstmann, "and the Pentagon has
approved it."</p>
<p>The $2 billion pledged by Japan to aid poor Moslem nations
-- Jordan, Turkey and Egypt -- is nearly all in the form of
loans, not grants as had been expected. "As a matter of
principle, we generally don't believe in giveaways in the
matter of economic assistance to developing countries,"
explains Kenzo Ohshima, political counselor at Japan's
embassy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, what aid the two are providing is flowing
like molasses.</p>
<p>So far, Japan has delivered to the U.S. just $585 million
in cash and gear, such as fax machines and four-wheel-drive
vehicles. Tokyo's "emergency loans" to frontline states have
totaled just half of the $600 million promised by now, U.S.
officials say. Germany has provided less than half of the
$700 million in military gear it promised in September. Of
the 60 highly publicized poison-gas-detecting armored
vehicles it pledged, only 30 have been sent.</p>
<p>"This will do nothing but sour allied relations," asserts
Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.). "Things are already strained
over trade disputes, but this is even worse. . . . They need
the Gulf oil more than we do, and they're not sending
troops."</p>
<p>The Japanese and German embassies here are scrambling to
put out the building political fire. Japanese Ambassador
Ryohei Murata has been working the phones to members of
Congress, and his deputy called a news conference the other
day to try to put a gloss on Tokyo's performance. The German
embassy has sent an upbeat "fact sheet" to members of
Congress.</p>
<p>The Bush administration seems oblivious to the domestic
political reaction. It hasn't asked either nation yet for
more money for 1991, despite the huge increase in U.S. forces
going to the Gulf and the looming prospect of war.</p>
<p>Privately, many mid-level officials are angry at the
allies, especially the Japanese. But the only senior official
willing to criticize Tokyo on the record is Treasury
Undersecretary David Mulford, who heads an international
committee funneling economic aid to hard-hit poorer nations.</p>
<p>"We have been disappointed that the Japanese have not
disbursed funds as quickly as promised," he said in an
interview.</p>
<p>By contrast, Richard Boucher, a spokesman for Secretary of
State Baker, said, "We are satisfied with the response that
we've gotten from all our allies." He added: "We are, of
course, engaged with them in continuing discussions about the
effort, and the secretary has made clear, very clear, that we
would be looking for further support."</p>
<p>Takayuki Kimura, Japan's No. 2 diplomat here, says Japan
is giving "the figure worked out with Mr. Brady. We have not
been asked for more." A German official says, "We could give
$10 billion and it wouldn't make any difference. It would
still be symbolic. The only thing which would count in
American eyes is German troops in the Gulf."</p>
