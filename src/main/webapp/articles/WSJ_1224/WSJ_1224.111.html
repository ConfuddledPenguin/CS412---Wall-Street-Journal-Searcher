	<p class="article-leader">Carnival Cruise Lines Inc. expects to report per-share
earnings for the fiscal year ended Nov. 30 of about $1.50 to
$1.55, up from $1.44 in the prior year, Micky Arison,
chairman and chief executive officer, said.
   For fiscal 1989, the Miami company had net income of
$193.6 million on revenue of $1.15 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Despite greater capacity -- this year the company has
added one new ship and a greater number of "berths," or beds,
on another -- Carnival's bookings are currently at about the
same percentage of occupancy as they were this time last
year, he said. He wouldn't be specific, however.</p>
<p>The trouble spot was the company's resort and casino
business in Nassau, the Bahamas, which "performed below our
expectations," Mr. Arison said.</p>
<p>Despite the weakening economy in the fourth quarter,
Carnival's occupancy rates, an important measure of a cruise
company's performance, were "approximately the same, maybe a
little better" than the year-ago quarter, Mr. Arison said.</p>
