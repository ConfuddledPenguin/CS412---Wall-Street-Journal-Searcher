	<p class="article-leader">In the catalog retailing business, J.C. Penney Co. was an
undisputed star.
   While Montgomery Ward gave up on the business five years
ago and Sears, Roebuck & Co.'s catalog division suffered five
years of losses, Penney's catalog operation posted five years
of double-digit growth. Company officials boasted its margins
were among the best in the business.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Then on Nov. 8, the company reported that catalog sales
had dropped 6.3% in the third quarter ended Oct. 27,
shrinking its sales gain for the first nine months to just
3%. Sales fell again in November, and rose this month only
after discounts were announced. Analysts say Penney, caught
midstream in its transition from mass merchant to upscale
retailer, may be especially vulnerable to the slowdown
hitting the catalog industry. "It's going to be real tough
for the next few months," says Rodney M. Birkins, Penney
catalog president.</p>
<p>Penney still has high hopes for its catalog operation,
which has won praise for its distribution efficiency and its
innovative marketing. Penney officials expect the catalogs --
which provided 20% of Penney's $16.4 billion in 1990 sales
and, analysts estimate, almost 20% of its profits -- to
contribute an increasing portion of sales in future years. By
mid-decade, they confidently predict, the division, with $3.2
billion in sales last year, will surge past struggling Sears
(sales of $4 billion) to become the nation's biggest catalog
operation.</p>
<p>Penney does have a potent weapon: its chain of 1,325
stores, which attract some 100 million shoppers a year.
Retailing gospel holds that store shoppers don't buy from
catalogs and vice versa. Indeed, about two-thirds of Penney's
shoppers don't buy from the catalog now, but Penney hopes to
change that by promoting the book heavily in its stores. It
is also starting new specialty catalogs and peddling catalog
wares on television.</p>
<p>Penney's cockiness is striking, particularly considering
the gloom that pervades the retailing industry these days and
the questions that surround the overcrowded, $35 billion
catalog industry. After nearly a decade of double-digit
growth -- twice that of retail stores -- catalog industry
sales are hardly better than flat this year, and profits are
down even at highfliers. Spiegel Inc.'s third-quarter
earnings dropped 5%, and Lands' End posted a $259,000
nine-month loss. With catalog mailings up nearly 75% since
1983, to 13.4 billion last year, "the industry is reaching
maturity," says Jay Walker, an industry consultant.</p>
<p>The market saturation and the economic downturn could
hardly come at a worse time for Penney, which has yet to
replace many traditional customers lost in its repositioning
with new upscale customers, analysts say. The enormity of
Penney's catalog operation also makes it more vulnerable to
economic downturns than narrowly targeted specialty catalogs.</p>
<p>But Penney, which is the nation's fourth largest retailer,
says its department stores will give it an advantage. Unlike
other chains with catalogs, which offer pretty much the same
items in both places, Penney has made its catalogs a distinct
and separate business. As the company has upgraded its
merchandise and image, the catalog has become the repository
for products no longer offered at the stores, including lawn
mowers, toys and sporting goods. And while the
margin-conscious stores limit their stock to the most popular
sizes and colors, the catalog offers a much wider range. In
women's fashion, for instance, only 25% of the catalog
merchandise is available in the stores.</p>
<p>In the stores, space is devoted to displays, or vignettes,
of goods available only from the catalog, risky in a business
where success is often measured by sales per square foot. At
the Plano, Texas, store, a couch-and-love-seat set
substitutes for a furniture department. Near the "Available
from the Catalog" sign is a phone linked directly to
order-taking operators. "We've sold four of those
couch-and-love-seat sets in as many weeks because of this
display," says Ivan Fischer, the store manager.</p>
<p>Penney was also the first to offer financial incentives to
encourage store personnel to push catalog merchandise.
Managers' bonuses are based in part on catalog sales, and
sales clerks get a 3.5% commission for catalog referrals.</p>
<p>Because it distributes about a third of its catalogs in
the stores, Penney spends much less on mailing than many
catalog operations. That's where Gwen Nagle, a 5-foot-11-inch
Dallas costume designer, came across Penney's Especially for
Talls catalog. Now, she shops at Penney stores for
accessories but orders clothes from the catalog. "For tall
women, it's the best selection anywhere," she says.</p>
<p>To extend its reach, Penney is rolling out specialty
catalogs to target popular niches from its big book. Its
catalogs already sell more nursery furnishings, bridal
apparel and big-and-tall men's clothing than most anyone
else, and Penney plans to introduce catalogs offering
lingerie, jewelry and sports equipment. Eventually, Penney
hopes to send out more than 40 special issues a year, up from
27 now.</p>
<p>Penney also boasts that it delivers faster than anybody in
the business. While Sears and Spiegel operate out of old
multilevel distribution centers that require up-and-down
movement of product, Penney has built a nationwide network of
efficient and highly automated single-level facilities. And
while most competitors ship out of a single location, Penney
has spread its distribution centers around the country,
enabling it to deliver 90% of its orders to stores within two
business days.</p>
<p>Customers are rewarded for picking up their orders at
Penney stores by a $1 discount and faster delivery. Returns
can also be made at stores, eliminating a UPS pickup or a
special trip to the post office. "You come up here and try it
on, and if it doesn't fit, you leave it here," says John
Gardere, a Dallas oilman.</p>
<p>But the emphasis on in-store pickups has generated return
rates that are higher than the industry average, which means
significantly higher costs. "Since they're picking it up at
the catalog center, customers will order multiple sizes and
colors, then they'll only accept the one they like best,"
says Sidney Doolittle, a retail consultant and former Ward
catalog executive. But Penney officials think the high return
rates are offset by another statistic: 20% of customers
picking up orders wander into the store and make purchases.</p>
<p>Appearance is another problem. Right now, going into the
catalog center at most Penney stores is like stepping into an
alley from a wide, well-lit street. The company plans to
spend millions over the next four years to remodel up to 500
centers.</p>
<p>Some also question Penney's projection that it will
generate as much as $500 million a year from television
merchandising. The company spent $125 million on one TV
shopping venture that failed and now owns a controlling
interest in Shop Television Network, a Los Angeles cable
channel that televises Penney catalog merchandise to about 11
million homes. So far, the venture hasn't made a profit or
generated significant revenue. "You can't expect people to
sit in front of the TV all day waiting for shoes to come on,"
says Maxwell Sroge, a catalog industry consultant.</p>
