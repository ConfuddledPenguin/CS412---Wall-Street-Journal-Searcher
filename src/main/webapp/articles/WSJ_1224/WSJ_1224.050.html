	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- K-III Holdings L.P. said it definitively
agreed with closely held Field Corp. to buy two educational
publishing subsidiaries, the children's book publishers Field
Publications and the encyclopedia publisher Funk & Wagnalls.
   Terms of the transaction, which is expected to close in
early 1991, weren't disclosed. But investment bankers
previously estimated the purchase price will be less than the
$300 million a year in sales for the two businesses combined.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>K-III Holdings, a partnership of former Macmillan Inc.
executives and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., a New York
leveraged buy-out firm, specializes in publishing and
information companies. Recently, it has acquired
special-interest publishers and book clubs.</p>
