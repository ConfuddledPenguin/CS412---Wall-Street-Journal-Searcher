8.5 million shares to the company's stock incentive plan.
   The Burbank, Calif., entertainment company said the
addition will be presented to shareholders at the company's
next shareholder meeting in March. Under the plan, stock
options are granted to executives over a five-year period and
the executives are allowed to exercise 20% of the options a
year.</p>

number of common shares authorized for repurchase by 8.5
million shares. The company said those repurchases would
offset any potential dilution from the stock incentive plan.</p>

outstanding.</p>
