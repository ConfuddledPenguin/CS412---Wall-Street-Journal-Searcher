	<p class="article-leader">Tucson Electric Power Co. appeared to move closer to a
bankruptcy-protection filing after an adverse state court
decision raised the possibility that the utility may be
forced to take $350 million in immediate one-time charges.
   The state court in Phoenix upheld two regulatory orders
issued last year that had been challenged by Tucson Electric.
The first involved a purchased power contract with a former
Tucson Electric subsidiary. The second involved Tucson
Electric's gain on the 1982 sale of an option to purchase an
interest in a New Mexico power plant.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Tucson, Ariz., utility prevailed in a third dispute
with regulators related to $20 million of fuel expenses for a
four-month period last year.</p>
<p>The Arizona Corporations Commission, which regulates
utilities, had disallowed certain Tucson Electric charges for
power purchased from its former Alamito unit, which was spun
off to shareholders and later taken private as Century Power
Corp. Tucson Electric has said that the difference between
its estimate of costs and the limits set by regulators is
$250 million over the life of the 28-year contract, which
expires in 2014.</p>
<p>The commission also disputed Tucson Electric's treatment
of a gain on the sale of an option to buy a 28.8% interest in
Unit 4 of the San Juan Generating Station near Farmington,
N.M. The commission argued that money from the sale to the
Modesto, Santa Clara and Redding Public Power Agency should
have benefited ratepayers rather than being passed on to
shareholders as a one-time gain. Tucson Electric has
estimated its pretax liability in the event of an unfavorable
outcome in this dispute to be $100 million as of Nov. 1,
1990.</p>
<p>In a statement, Tucson Electric said it hasn't decided
whether it will appeal the decisions. The utility also said
it is "reviewing whether recognition of losses or write-offs
related to the Century Power purchase contract and the
{option-gain} adjustment is required at this time."</p>
<p>Regarding the 28-year Century Power contract, a Tucson
Electric spokesman said: "We don't know if accounting
treatment would require immediate" write-downs for the full
$250 million rather than amortization over the life of the
contract.</p>
<p>In two recent filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Tucson Electric has cautioned that it may file
for Chapter 11 protection from creditors if it is unable to
maintain liquidity. In October, a spokesman said such an
action wasn't imminent. The spokesman declined to speculate
on what the company will do now.</p>
<p>In a bid to improve liquidity, Tucson Electric omitted
indefinitely all of its preferred-stock dividends earlier
this month. The company said the omission was one of a number
of steps designed to conserve cash. The company omitted its
quarterly dividend on common stock in January.</p>
<p>Tucson Electric has been plagued by excess generating
capacity throughout the Southwest and by fallout from the
company's disastrous diversification into the thrift and real
estate businesses. In the year ended June 30, the utility had
a net loss of $210.9 million, or $8.64 a share, including
write-downs from disposal of discontinued operations, on
revenue of $480.9 million.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
Tucson Electric shares closed at $7.375, down 25 cents.</p>
