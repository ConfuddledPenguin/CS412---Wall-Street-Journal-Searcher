	<p class="article-leader">In the entranceway to my apartment there is a portrait of
the Madonna and child. It is about 50 years old, hand
colored, and covered in glass. People always stop to mention
its beauty. It looks so old. It looks like it was handed
down.
   I bought the Madonna a few months ago at a big flea market
on the West Side of Manhattan. Every Sunday, a few thousand
New Yorkers go there to demonstrate their faith in bargains
and adore cedar-lined Art Deco bedroom sets. One of the most
interesting things about this flea market is the quantity of
old religious art that is for sale: paintings of saints,
statues of the Virgin Mary, framed prints of the Sacred Heart
of Jesus. There are 1950s miraculous medals that go for
two-for-$5, and never-worn scapulars in yellowed plastic.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>All these old things came from somebody's house -- from
grandma's house after she died. Her boomer grandchildren sold
them to dealers -- "The real estate agents tell you to get
that stuff off the walls if you want to sell the house,"
explains a friend. The dealers sell them now to -- who? My
friends and I walk along the busy aisles ("it's 20, but I can
go 17") and when we see an old wall crucifix we call to each
other as if we've found an authentic relic, which in a way we
have.</p>
<p>It is commonplace at this time of year to note what has
probably always been so, at least in America: Christmas has
become too commercial. Years ago there was the annual
campaign to "Put Christ back in Christmas" -- this to counter
the then-growing habit of writing "Xmas," which I notice no
one does anymore. Now we have the annual tussle over the
creche in the public square, pitting understandably aggrieved
citizens against an American Civil Liberties Union hellbent
on protecting us from the sight of what is, as it were, a
homeless child being put up on public property -- probably
the only kind of public housing the ACLU has ever opposed.</p>
<p>The controversy over what Michael Kinsley has wryly called
"the creche menace" may be aggravated in part by a wider loss
-- the loss of the days when people displayed quite publicly,
on their persons and in their homes, the signs and symbols of
their religious feeling. I write as a Catholic who remembers
the way we were.</p>
<p>When I was a child in New York in the '50s and '60s, some
of us -- "us" being the children and grandchildren of the
immigrants of Europe -- had grottos on the front lawn, with
statues of the Blessed Mother. (You can still see these in
Queens, where beats still the heart of the old New York.) We
wore crucifixes, and medals with heroic renderings of St.
Dominic and St. Anthony and St. Teresa, the Little Flower. In
the house, on the big bureau with the mirror, there were
palms from the last Palm Sunday, and mass cards with praying
saints, and a pair of rosary beads.</p>
<p>Italians were partial to makeshift altars in the corner of
the bedroom, with a statue of St. Lucy or the Infant of
Padua. The Irish sometimes had a little altar on the mantle,
and a bottle of holy water kept in a special drawer. There
were crucifixes on the wall. On Good Friday some kids wore
pebbles in their shoes to know some of His suffering, and on
Ash Wednesday half the people in the neighborhood went around
with a big smudge of ashes on their foreheads. We carried to
mass each week our own small leather missals. (I have
something like it in my bag now, but it's a Filofax.)</p>
<p>The habit of religion was more prevalent then and so less
embarrassing, and did not seem an implicit affront to
American homogeneity. It didn't seem wrong in those days to
be different and discrete; I think we just thought we were
one of the meatier elements in the melting pot, which most of
us understood to be a rich Sunday stew. Now we are part of a
mosaic, bright dry and static; and we do blend in.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the '60s we changed our style just as much as
Vatican II changed the church. We stopped being so open and
exuberant and vulgar; we banished the statues and the mass
card in the mirror; we stopped wearing medals; we developed
good taste. But I find myself wondering this season what we
lost: the sense we had, with millions of others, that we were
part of something big, and the sense we had, when the symbols
of our faith surrounded us in our rooms, our houses, our
lawns, our lives, that we were part of something true.</p>
<p>Now it's more segmented; one is a Catholic quietly, in
church. We're not so out there, so open, so . . . ethnic.</p>
<p>Which according to me is one of the reasons we changed. I
think about 20 years ago boomers came to associate all that
conspicuous kneeling and scapular-wearing with Uncle Vinny
and Aunt Bridget, and that's not who we aspired to be. We
were slightly, mildly, almost unconsciously embarrassed by
our ethnicity. We wanted to be more, as they say, like the
people in the Ralph Lauren ads -- handsome, upscale,
Protestant. We made the kind of cultural choices that are
reflected in a comment by an old Boston Irish politician to
the political reporter Joe Klein. The politician, questioning
the authenticity of another politician's trauma, said, "He's
not really ethnic -- he's never been ashamed of his father."
Or his father's religion.</p>
<p>There were other reasons for the change in style of course
-- the church itself changed, and the world did.</p>
<p>This is about Christmas and so must include hope. Is there
any chance Catholics will go back, at least a little, to the
old ways? Sure. The new ethnic Catholics -- the Mexicans and
Haitians and Nicaraguans who are filling the parishes of New
York -- are bringing in the energy and unembarassed
obviousness of the old ethnics of Brooklyn. Their faith is as
real and indispensible to their lives as the kitchen sink.</p>
<p>There are other signs, and some of them are hearteningly
vulgar. Boomers desperate to sell their houses are starting
to bury little statues of St. Joseph, who knew all about
being desperate for a new home, in the front lawn. And in
Catholic churches around Manhattan the candles in front of
the statues of St. Anne, the patron saint of finding a man,
are these days always lit. I don't think it's the old ethnics
who are lighting them.</p>
<p>There is the fact that boomers now have children, and are
newly appreciative of the ways of the elders, especially in
matters of spiritual development. An example: I go to mass
with my three-year-old son and he does not want to stay, and
if he stays he does not want to be quiet. When he isn't
looking I hide a cherry lollipop in the hymnal. I put the
book back in the pew and tell him to open it to see if there
are pictures. He finds the lollipop and laughs. I tell him
God put it there, so he will associate church, and God, with
sweetness and surprise. Is this right? Or should I eschew the
bribe and lean on discipline? I turn to Aunt Peggy for
advice. For now stick with the lollipop, she says.</p>
<p>Aunt Peggy is an ethnic, Brooklyn born, and can remember
when true ecumenism was when the Italians and the Irish
started speaking to each other. She passes on to new
generations what she knows about living in belief. She adores
the symbols of religious worship and is on a first-name basis
with most saints. She calls St. Anthony "Tony," for instance,
and has everyone where she works praying, when they lose
something, "St. Anthony, St. Anthony, please come around.
Something is lost which must be found." Her boss, an
agnostic, now keeps a St. Anthony list.</p>
<p>Aunt Peggy does missionary work for the old Catholicism.
Recently a saleswoman at a department store was waiting on
her, and Aunt Peggy saw that she was wearing a crucifix.
"Thank you," Aunt Peggy said.</p>
<p>The saleswoman was surprised. "Why are you thanking me? I
wouldn't go anywhere without my cross."</p>
<p>"Good," said Peggy. "Thank you for exposing it to me."</p>
<p>Aunt Peggy believes in encouraging that which should be
encouraged. And early in December, when I told her about the
relics at the flea market, she insisted on going with me, so
she could buy a few and find good homes for them. If she
finds a manger she'll probably keep it, to remind herself and
her neighbors what this holiday is about. She'll probably put
it in the window of her East Side apartment, for all the
world to see.</p>
