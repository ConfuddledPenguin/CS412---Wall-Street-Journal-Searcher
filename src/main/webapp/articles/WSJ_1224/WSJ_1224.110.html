	<p class="article-leader">MCDONNELL DOUGLAS Corp. (St. Louis, Mo.) -- Moody's
Investors Service Inc. said it downgraded about $2.4 billion
of McDonnell Douglas Finance Corp.'s long-term debt. The
rating agency lowered the rating of the commercial aircraft
leasing concern's senior long-term debt to Baa-2 from Baa-1,
and lowered the rating of subordinated debt to Ba-1 from
Baa-3. In addition, Moody's said it reduced its rating on
commercial paper to Prime-3 from Prime-2. The agency said its
actions were based on "asset quality deterioration" in some
of McDonnell's newer businesses, the "corresponding erosion
in core profitability," and "constrained funding access in
light of the financial deterioration of the parent company."
Moody's also noted the "inherent strengths" of the leasing
unit's core business. Elayne Bendel, a spokeswoman for
McDonnell, declined to comment.

	<div class="article-body"><p>PENNSYLVANIA POWER & LIGHT Co. (Allentown, Pa.) --
Standard & Poor's Corp. said it raised its ratings on this
utility's senior secured debt to single-A from
single-A-minus, preferred stock to single-A-minus from
triple-B-plus, and preference stock to triple-B-plus from
triple-B. The rating concern also affirmed the commercial
paper rating at single-A-1. The actions affect about $3
billion of debt outstanding. S&P cited the company's
prospects of "solid financial performances" throughout the
1990s, despite some exposure to increased costs related to
complying with federal clean-air legislation. S&P also cited
"excellent" operating records at Pennsylvania Power's
Susquehanna nuclear power station.</p>

<p>PRUDENTIAL INSURANCE CO. OF AMERICA (Newark, N.J.) --
Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it confirmed various
ratings on this insurance company, following the announcement
that its Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. subsidiary would
have a 1990 loss of about $250 million. The rating concern
said that although Prudential will face increased earnings
pressure "because of its somewhat aggressive investment
portfolio," the company has restructured its portfolio and
taken other steps to maintain its financial strength.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER TELEPHONE Corp. (Rochester, N.Y.) -- Standard &
Poor's Corp. said it lowered its ratings on about $420
million in securities of this phone company. The rating
concern downgraded senior secured debt to single-A-plus from
double-A, senior unsecured debt and preferred stock to
single-A from double-A-minus, and commercial paper to
single-A-1 from single-A-1-plus. S&P said that Rochester
Telephone's "appetite" for telephone acquisitions has placed
added pressure on the company's debt leverage, and that it
doesn't expect the debt leverage to decline, as the company
plans to continue to acquire out-of-state firms.</p>

<p>SOUTH CAROLINA ELECTRIC & GAS Co. (Columbia, S.C.) --
Fitch Investor Service lowered its ratings on $890 million of
South Carolina E&G debt, saying competition from energy
cooperatives is limiting the company's ability to raise its
low rates. The company is a unit of Scana Corp. Fitch
downgraded the utility's rating on $800 million in
first-mortgage bonds to A from AA. Fitch's rating on $90
million in preferred stock went to A- from A+. B. Tate
Horton, vice president and treasurer of South Carolina E&G,
said the action will probably increase the cost of credit for
the utility, which expects to seek $200 million to $400
million in new capital in the late 1990s to comply with the
federal Clean Air Act.</p>

<p>WHITMAN Corp. (Chicago) -- Moody's Investors Service Inc.,
citing a "more positive outlook" for certain Whitman
operations, changed an earlier-announced review of the
company's $1.2 billion in long-term debt to "direction
uncertain." The rating concern in October announced it would
review the debt for "possible downgrade" after Whitman
announced plans to spin off Pet Inc., its largest business.
The restructuring included a $150 million after-tax charge in
the third quarter. But Friday, Moody's said the review
direction "was changed to reflect a more positive outlook for
certain of the company's business units, including those
remaining with Whitman and those which may be spun off into
the newly created Pet Inc." Moody's review will also weigh
the "extent to which the announced restructuring charge will
reduce overhead costs in the future." In addition to Pet,
Whitman currently operates Midas International, Pepsi Cola
General Bottlers and Hussmann Corp. units.</p>
