	<p class="article-leader">General Dynamics Corp. named the former director of its
F-16 fighter program to head its ailing A-12 program, which
is in danger of cancellation by the Pentagon as early as Jan.
2.
   Ted S. Webb, 60 years old, who retired in August 1989
after heading the F-16 program for nine years, will return as
program director for the A-12 and as vice president of the
Fort Worth, Texas, division.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>He succeeds Charles A. Anderson, 58, former general
manager of the Fort Worth division who was put in charge of
the A-12 just last July. General Dynamics said Mr. Anderson
"is being removed and reassigned" as division vice president
for special programs and other business, which includes the
company's work on the national aerospace plane and indigenous
fighters for Japan and Taiwan.</p>
<p>The shake-up, part of an overall shuffling of management
duties at the Fort Worth division, comes as General Dynamics
and A-12 team partner McDonnell Douglas Corp. are negotiating
with the Navy and aides to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to
try to salvage the program, which has been plagued by
engineering problems and cost overruns. The Pentagon has
threatened to cancel the program unless the two St. Louis
defense contractors come up with a plan by Jan. 2 to solve
the problems. General Dynamics and McDonnell Douglas each
notified 4,000 employees last week that they could be laid
off as early as Jan. 2 if the A-12 is canceled.</p>
<p>General Dynamics downplayed the A-12 problems as a cause
for the management reorganization at Fort Worth. The change
is designed "to concentrate authority and resources in the
hands of executives in charge of the individual business
groups and then hold them directly responsible for the
results," said Herbert F. Rogers, General Dynamics' president
and chief operating officer. Mr. Rogers in July moved from
corporate headquarters to become general manager of the Fort
Worth division in an effort to shore up the A-12, shortly
after the company took a $450 million write-off on the
program.</p>
<p>As part of the latest changes, General Dynamics has split
the Fort Worth division into five business groups, according
to its major military programs there. In addition to the
appointments of Messrs. Webb and Anderson, Dain M. Hancock,
49, program director for the F-16, was named to head the new
F-16 group; D. Randall Kent, 64, program manager for the
Advanced Tactical Fighter, will head the new ATF group; and
John E. Vick, 57, formerly division vice president for
electronic products, will head the newly created military
electronics business group.</p>
