	<p class="article-leader">BancTexas Group Inc. said an investor group headed by
Billy B. Goldberg of Houston agreed to purchase between 16
million and 20 million newly issued shares for 25 cents each,
or $4 million to $5 million.
   The Dallas bank holding company said the proposed
transaction, which remains subject to due diligence and
regulatory and shareholder approval, would leave the group
with a 45% to 55% stake, allowing it to nominate a majority
to the board.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>BancTexas, which owns banks in Houston and McKinney,
Texas, said the investor group also plans to ask the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. to permanently waive any claims
against BancTexas arising from the recent failure of the
company's Dallas bank. BancTexas said it and the investor
group are also attempting to arrange the redemption of the
FDIC's warrants to buy about 12% of the company's stock.</p>
