	<p class="article-leader">PHILADELPHIA -- Banks are pressing for the creation of a
fiscal-oversight board that would have veto power over
Philadelphia's budget under certain circumstances as part of
a $150 million loan proposal to help the city avoid
bankruptcy.
   The demands of eight Philadelphia banks were outlined last
week in a confidential 10-page document that bore the logo of
CoreStates Financial Corp., the lead negotiator for the
eight-bank consortium.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In addition to the oversight board, the banks also urged
spending cuts, tax increases, sale of city assets and
privatization of some services to end the city's chronic
deficits. The administration of Mayor W. Wilson Goode is
facing a deficit of $229.5 million this fiscal year.</p>
<p>Under the loan proposal, the banks would buy $100 million
in notes as early as next week and be repaid by March 15. The
other $50 million in notes would be sold by Jan. 31 "upon the
satisfactory occurence of certain events," the proposal said.</p>
<p>Among those events would be approval by city council of
the oversight board. Similar legislation would have to be
introduced by Jan. 31 in the state House and Senate.</p>
<p>The source familiar with the document said that, while the
banks "never intended to dictate" the specifics of what the
oversight board would do, such an entity would be necessary
to "restore the confidence of the city's Wall Street lenders
and state legislators."</p>
<p>Seperately, Fidelity Investments of Boston, the nation's
largest mutual fund company, joined negotiations on an
emergency loan package for that city, which is running low on
cash and could begin missing payrolls on Jan. 4. But a
Fidelity spokesman said that "no investment decisions have
been made."</p>
