	<p class="article-leader">BRUSSELS -- The Belgian unit of N.V. Philips said it
agreed to pump at least four billion Belgian francs ($128
million) into Super Club N.V., a Belgian operator of video
and music stores.
   Philips said the injection would be made in the form of
equity and convertible debt. Philips's stake in Super Club
would rise to about 21% from 12%. "This will strengthen Super
Club's financial position by January 1991," Philips said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Both sides denied, however, that the move was a rescue
operation. Charles Cool, a Super Club director, said it was
too early to say how the money would be used.</p>
<p>The investment surprised analysts because Philips, an
electronics giant based in the Netherlands, is suffering from
severe financial problems and heavy debt. The company is
eliminating nearly 20% of its work force world-wide and has
warned that its loss for 1990 will total about four billion
Dutch guilders ($2.4 billion).</p>
<p>"I don't think it's the opportune time" to make such an
investment, said Luc van Lent, an analyst at Swiss Bank Corp.
in London.</p>
<p>But the Dutch company said Super Club's activities "fit in
perfectly with Philips's strategy." A Philips spokesman said
his company, which owns 80% of PolyGram N.V., a
recorded-music company, wants to expand further in software
to go with the consumer-electronics hardware made by Philips.</p>
<p>Super Club had 1989 net income of about $38 million on
sales of $349 million.</p>
