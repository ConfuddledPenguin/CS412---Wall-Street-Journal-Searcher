	<p class="article-leader">WESTWOOD ONE Inc., a Los Angeles-based producer and
distributor of radio programs, said it amended its offer to
exchange $400 principal amount of its 9% convertible senior
subordinated debentures, due 2002, for each $1,000 principal
amount of its 6 3/4% convertible subordinated debentures, due
2011. The amendment reduces the conversion price of the 9%
debentures to $3.50 a share from $5.25, and eliminates the
company's option to redeem these debentures prior to April
23, 1993. A spokesman said Westwood amended the offer because
there was "interest from a large number of holders who said
they would accept an exchange under the revised terms." About
$8.7 million principal amount of the 6 3/4% debentures had
been tendered as of noon EST Friday.</p>
