	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Security Pacific Corp. said late Friday that
Infotechnology Inc., which owns 46% of struggling Financial
News Network Inc., was in default on a $20.7 million loan and
the bank "moved to protect its interests."
   A spokeswoman for the Los Angeles bank declined to
elaborate on the move. The loan originally was due July 1991.
Infotechnology said its banks "accelerated the due date" of
the $20.7 million loan. Security Pacific said it was acting
on behalf of itself and Midlantic National Bank, a unit of
Midlantic Corp., Edison, N.J.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The loan is collateralized by Infotechnology's interest in
FNN. In a statement, Infotechnology said the bank "has not
scheduled a foreclosure sale of Infotech's FNN stock, and the
company believes that no such sale is imminent."</p>
<p>One person close to Infotechnology said Security Pacific
could be taking the action in part to protect its legal
interests. Midlantic couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>In November, new management at FNN and Infotechnology
recommended selling operations, including FNN. Candidates to
purchase FNN are said to include Dow Jones & Co., which
publishes The Wall Street Journal, Paramount Communications
Inc., Capital Cities/ABC Inc. and General Electric Co.'s NBC
unit. Friday, Infotechnology said the "company has no
intention at the present time of altering its previously
announced plans to sell its interest" in FNN.</p>
<p>Separately, FNN said that, as of Dec. 21, its stock was
removed from quotation in the National Market System of the
National Association of Securities Dealers Inc., but was
granted a continuing exception to the NASDAQ system listing
requirements; FNN fails to meet net worth requirements.</p>
