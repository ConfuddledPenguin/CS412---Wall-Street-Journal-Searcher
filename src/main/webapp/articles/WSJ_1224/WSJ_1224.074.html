	<p class="article-leader">DANBURY, Conn. -- Union Carbide Corp. said Kemet
Electronics Corp., in which it holds a 50% stake, will be
sold for $235 million to an investor group that includes
Kemet management.
   Union Carbide had been trying since September to divest
itself of its stake in Kemet, an electronic capacitor maker,
as part of its plan to stick to its core businesses in
chemicals and industrial gases. It expects a fourth-quarter
earnings gain of about $29 million, or 21 cents a share, from
the sale.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The remaining 50% of Kemet, based in Greenville, S.C., is
held by General Electric Co.'s GE Capital Corp. and Kemet
management.</p>
<p>In the third quarter, Union Carbide had net income of $94
million, or 63 cents a share.</p>
