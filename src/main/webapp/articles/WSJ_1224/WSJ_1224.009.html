	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Bank of New England Corp. agreed to restate
its third-quarter 1989 earnings as part of its settlement of
fraud charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   As previously reported, the Boston-based bank, without
admitting or denying wrongdoing, agreed to settle charges
that it filed false quarterly reports and registration
statements with the SEC, hiding the deterioration of its loan
portfolio.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The SEC voted two weeks ago to accept the settlement, but
didn't file the case in Boston federal court until Friday.</p>
<p>In its settlement with the agency, Bank of New England
agreed to restate its third-quarter 1989 earnings to reflect
the loan problems more accurately. The banking company also
agreed to have independent accountants conduct a review of
internal accounting controls, and it agreed not to violate
fraud provisions in the future.</p>
<p>A Bank of New England spokesman said, "We're pleased that
we were able to arrive at a satisfactory settlement with the
SEC and can put this matter behind us. The settlement has no
effect on our current business operations and will in no way
interfere with our ongoing affairs."</p>
<p>Separately, the SEC was granted a temporary restraining
order after filing charges against Latin Investment Corp. and
several principals of the Washington firm. The order largely
freezes the assets of the three principals, Fernando Leonzo,
Leonel Salinas and Jose Cortes.</p>
<p>The agency charged that since 1982, the company illegally
sold securities in itself to about 3,500 people, mostly
immigrants from El Salvador and other Latin American
countries. The firm took money into what it described as
passbook savings accounts, but since it wasn't a bank the
money actually was invested in securities of Latin
Investment. Moreover, the SEC charged that the firm defrauded
investors by telling them Latin Investment was a bank.</p>
<p>The agency charged that the three men used much of the
roughly $6.8 million for their own purposes. Earlier this
month, the company was forced into Chapter 7 involuntary
bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
<p>The principals couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
