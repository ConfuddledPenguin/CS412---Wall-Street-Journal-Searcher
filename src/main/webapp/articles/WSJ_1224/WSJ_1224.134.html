	<h3>Your Money Matters: Credit Crunch Is a Boon to Loan-Brokerage Swindlers</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">Law enforcement agencies across the nation say they are
seeing a ghost of recessions past: the old advance-fee
scheme, in which fraudulent loan brokers collect fees from
would-be borrowers but never deliver the promised financing.
   "It's a very good time for these schemes," says Joe
Braunreuther, head of the fraud unit of the U.S. attorney's
office in New Jersey. "The credit crunch has made people more
desperate for financing, so they're willing to pay money
upfront to con men."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The federal prosecutors in New Jersey, who obtained a
guilty plea earlier this year from a loan broker who had
taken in some $8 million in advance fees, are now
investigating a growing number of advance-fee schemes, Mr.
Braunreuther says.</p>
<p>In Iowa, at least 16 victims of advance-fee schemes have
filed complaints this year with the Iowa attorney general's
office, prompting the agency to issue a televised warning
against the schemes earlier this month. The Dallas district
attorney's staff has seen a surge in complaints from
advance-fee victims this year and is now looking into 14
separate cases, according to prosecutors and investigators
there.</p>
<p>The schemes aren't new, of course, but the law enforcement
officials say the nationwide shortage of credit, coming on
top of the holiday season, has inspired a resurgence. "This
seems to be the fraud fad right now," says Don Ramsey, a
spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Dallas.
"Credit's tight, people can't get legitimate financing, so
they go somewhere else and get taken."</p>
<p>Typically, the victims are either small business owners
seeking start-up capital or refinancing, or cash-strapped
consumers. As part of the scam, unscrupulous brokers reassure
the soon-to-be victims with impressively -- and carefully --
worded contracts when they collect their upfront fees, and
then deliver polished excuses when the financing doesn't
materialize.</p>
<p>In recent years, prosecutors in Dallas say, fraudulent
loan brokers have gotten smarter, fine-tuning their contracts
with clauses stating that the advance fees are refundable --
minus the expenses incurred for attempting to locate
financing. "By the time the client figures out he's not going
to get his money, the fee has been eaten up in purported
expenses," says Ted Steinke, head of the specialized crime
section of the Dallas district attorney's office.</p>
<p>Fraudulent loan brokers have also stopped making
guarantees that financing will be located, because such
promises can turn contracts into securities and make them
subject to stringent state securities laws. Dallas
prosecutors say fraudulent loan brokers now solicit would-be
borrowers from out of state to discourage the victims from
seeking redress. Such out-of-state operations also stymie
local investigators, who often don't have the resources -- or
incentive -- to pursue multistate investigations on behalf of
victims who live outside their jurisdiction.</p>
<p>But joint investigations by state and federal agencies are
beginning to stop some multistate operations. Last month, the
FBI teamed up with the Texas attorney general and the Dallas
district attorney to shut down Diamon International Inc., a
Dallas-based loan broker that signed on clients from
California, Ohio, Texas and even Britain. An FBI spokesman
says the firm collected at least $800,000 from at least 24
would-be borrowers.</p>
<p>One of Diamon International's clients was Carl Johnson of
Long Beach, Calif., who says he had persuaded his wife that
the couple should postpone buying a home while he pursued his
lifelong dream of owning a car wash.</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson, 32 years old, says he couldn't find a
traditional lender willing to rely on the car wash's cash
flow, so he paid $17,000 to Diamon International for a
commitment that the firm would find financing for the
purchase. With the commitment in hand, Mr. Johnson says he
confidently gave the seller a $100,000 downpayment to secure
the sale. But Diamon International never came up with a loan.</p>
<p>"I lost the deal because it didn't fund," says Mr.
Johnson, who says his losses are approaching $125,000. "That
was everything I had. That was my life savings."</p>
<p>Last month, the FBI arrested Diamon International's
president, Diane Harmon, 39, on a federal mail-fraud charge
after receiving a tip that she was about to leave Dallas for
Spain. She hasn't been indicted and is currently free on
bond. Her attorney, William Kim Wade of Dallas, says Ms.
Harmon's loan brokerage business was legitimate.</p>
<p>"It's my understanding that she did place loans, that she
did pay application fees to some lenders, and that she did
have significant lender contacts," Mr. Wade says. He added
that he believes the complaints by would-be borrowers "should
be handled as a civil matter." At least half a dozen people
who sent fees to Diamon International are pressing civil
lawsuits against the firm and Ms. Harmon.</p>
<p>One client, Bernard Master of Columbus, Ohio, was able to
recoup much of his $50,000 advance fee in a settlement of his
civil lawsuit. He had asked Diamon International to find
refinancing for the medical clinics he owns. Dr. Master says
he has given up hope of refinancing the clinics in the
current tight credit market.</p>
<p>"People should remember that Santa Claus comes only once a
year," he says now. "If Santa Claus comes in August, you
should know there's a problem."</p>
