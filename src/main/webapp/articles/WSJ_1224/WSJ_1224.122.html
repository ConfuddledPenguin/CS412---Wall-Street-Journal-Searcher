	<p class="article-leader">A unit of GE Capital Corp. said it agreed to sell its 13
retail mortgage origination offices to American Mortgage
Banking Ltd., Westbury, N.Y. It didn't disclose the amount.
   The unit, GE Capital Mortgage Services Inc., Cherry Hill,
N.J., acquired the retail origination branch network when it
bought Travelers Mortgage Services Inc. That transaction was
completed in October.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>When the Travelers Mortgage purchase was announced, GE
Capital Mortgage said it didn't want to be in the business of
making mortgage loans because it doesn't want to compete with
its customers, which are thrifts, banks and other mortgage
finance companies. Travelers Mortgage had tried to find other
buyers for the retail network but failed.</p>
<p>American Mortgage Banking said it plans to change its name
to Arbor National Mortgage Inc. after the purchase is
completed. The 13 offices are in Connecticut, Maryland, New
Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia. The transaction
is expected to be completed next week. GE Capital Corp.,
Stamford, Conn., is a financial services unit of General
Electric Co., Fairfield, Conn.</p>
