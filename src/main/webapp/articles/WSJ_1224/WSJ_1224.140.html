	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Federal Election Commission dismissed a
complaint that a pro-Israel lobbying group illegally
coordinated political contributions.
   The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, one of the
most powerful lobbying groups here, had been accused of
violating federal campaign-spending limits by secretly
coordinating activities of at least 27 pro-Israel political
action committees nationwide. A group of retired U.S.
diplomats led by former Undersecretary of State George Ball,
along with former Illinois Rep. Paul Findley, had filed a
complaint with the FEC in January 1989, charging the groups
were "affiliated" with AIPAC in a network that should be
regarded as a single political action committee.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the FEC, in a statement Friday, found unanimously
"there is insufficient evidence to indicate that AIPAC and
the respondent PACS are affiliated."</p>
<p>The FEC said that the 27 PACS received data regarding
congressional races from AIPAC, and that their contributions
followed a similar pattern. But FEC concluded there was no
collusion between them and AIPAC. "It appears that each
respondent PAC makes independent decisions regarding which
candidates to support," the FEC said.</p>
<p>In its filings to FEC, AIPAC said, "No one directs
American Jews to become active . . . in political campaigns,
or to give to candidates, or to form political organizations
of their own."</p>
