	<p class="article-leader">US Sprint, a unit of United Telecommunications Inc., said
it began an international telephone calling service that
would provide significant savings over its regular rates.
   Called Sprint WORLD, the plan offers simplified low flat
rates for customers making calls to 36 international regions
from anywhere in the U.S., the concern said. A spokeswoman
said the regions include most major cities.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A caller in the U.S. who subscribes to the services would
be able to talk to a person in Paris for about 59 cents a
minute during Sprint's discount and economy calling periods:
The rates don't apply during peak business hours. That
compares to the normal rate of $1.38 for the first minute and
79 cents for each additional minute if the same person was
calling during the discount calling period.</p>
<p>The Kansas City, Mo., company said subscribers would be
billed a monthly fee of $3 for the service, although the fee
would be waived for the first three months of service for
those who sign up before Feb. 28.</p>
<p>"International calling is the fastest growing segment of
the industry," said Steve Akin, president of Sprint's
consumer services group. "It has been the most widely
requested new service by our customers."</p>
