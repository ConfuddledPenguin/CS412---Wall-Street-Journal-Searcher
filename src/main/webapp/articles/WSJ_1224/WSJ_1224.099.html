	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- A state court judge here froze 2.2 million
Carolco Pictures Inc. shares owned by the company's chairman,
Mario Kassar, and limited Mr. Kassar's ability to draw funds
from the independent movie production company.
   Judge John Zerbrowski took the action at a Thursday
hearing of a shareholder's suit that charged Mr. Kassar with
self-dealing in a $45 million stock transaction with Carolco
last September.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the transaction, Carolco agreed to buy back about 3.4
million shares from Mr. Kassar at $13 a share. At the time,
the shares were trading at about $7.25 on the New York Stock
Exchange. The company didn't offer an explanation for the
much higher price. The buy-back was completed last month.</p>
<p>On Friday, Carolco closed at $8.375 a share, down 25
cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
<p>Carolco, one of the few remaining independent movie
companies, has a reputation for paying some of the highest
fees in Hollywood to writers, directors and actors. The
company is known for producing a string of action movies. It
released the high-budget "Total Recall," starring Arnold
Schwarzenegger, last summer.</p>
<p>In his order Thursday, Judge Zerbrowski said the evidence
suggested "self-dealing" and a breach of fiduciary duties. In
addition to freezing 2.2 million shares, the judge froze one
million warrants held by Mr. Kassar and ordered Carolco not
to approve any loans or other financial transactions with Mr.
Kassar without court review.</p>
<p>Mr. Kassar founded Carolco with Andrew Vajna about 14
years ago, and the two ran the company as co-chairmen. Mr.
Vajna left the company in November 1989, and Mr. Kassar
purchased his 36% stake, or 11.2 million shares, for about
$108 million, or $9.60 a share. Based on that price, Mr.
Kassar made a profit of about $11.5 million when he sold the
smaller number of shares to the company. The Carolco buy-back
left Mr. Kassar with 15.1 million shares, or a 57% stake in
the company.</p>
<p>After buying the shares from Mr. Vajna, Mr. Kassar also
sold about 3.8 million shares to four institutional investors
at prices ranging from $10.50 to $11.50 a share.</p>
<p>Carolco officials declined to comment on the Thursday
action. In a statement, the company said the preliminary
action "has no effect on the company and its operations."
Carolco said the transaction was approved by its independent
committee and its board and that the company received support
from institutional and other large holders representing a
majority of the shares not owned by Mr. Kassar.</p>
<p>As a result, Carolco said it believes that its "view of
this case is correct" and that "the courts will agree once
they have had the opportunity to review all the facts."</p>
