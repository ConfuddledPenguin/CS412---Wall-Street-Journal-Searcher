	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Defense Department officials "will look
into" allegations that the Air Force may have deliberately
misled Congress about a 1986 safety inspection of some
Lockheed Corp. C-5B cargo jets, a Pentagon spokesman said.
   Rep. John D. Dingell (D., Mich.) asked the Pentagon to
investigate the actions of Lockheed, the Air Force, and a
former Air Force procurement chief, after evidence surfaced
suggesting that only a cursory inspection was performed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The evidence was a written statement by Lawrence B.
Welborn, a retired lieutenant colonel, which apparently was
obtained by plaintiff attorneys in connection with related
litigation against Lockheed. Mr. Welborn said the inspection
team spent about one hour examining only one aircraft.</p>
<p>An Air Force spokesman said he couldn't comment on
allegations that might become the subject of an
investigation.</p>
<p>In a statement, Calabasas, Calif.-based Lockheed said that
"in five years of very demanding service with the Air Force,
there have been no incidents suggesting any deficiency in
C-5B mainframes." Lockheed also said it has "absolutely no
reason to doubt" the Air Force testimony about its 1986
safety inspection.</p>
