	<p class="article-leader">STOCKHOLM -- Sweden's Social Democratic government ousted
Nordbanken Chairman Tony Hagstroem and heralded a sweeping
board reshuffle in an apparent political purge of the bank,
which is 71% state-owned.
   Management upheaval at Nordbanken, Sweden's second largest
bank, began last Thursday with the unexplained resignation of
its chief executive officer, Rune Barneus. After a stormy
meeting Friday, Swedish Finance Minister Allan Larsson
effectively discharged Mr. Hagstroem as the bank's chairman.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The official version of Mr. Barneus's departure relates to
a confidential report by Swedish banking regulators that
sharply criticized Nordbanken management. Mr. Hagstroem said
Friday that the report prepared by Sweden's Bank Inspection
Board blamed lax credit controls and other management gaffes
for hefty loan losses that have surfaced at Nordbanken in
recent months.</p>
<p>Finance Ministry officials reportedly had grown
disenchanted with Nordbanken's management in recent weeks as
the threat of soaring loan losses led to a series of hefty
provisions, slashing expected profit for this year.</p>
<p>A special shareholders' meeting will be held Jan. 18 to
elect a new slate of directors. In a separate statement, the
Finance Ministry said it will name its nominee for the post
of Nordbanken's new chairman this week.</p>
