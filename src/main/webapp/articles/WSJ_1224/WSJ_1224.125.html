	<p class="article-leader">Curtiss-Wright Corp.'s Target Rock Corp. unit said it was
advised that the U.S. government filed a complaint against it
seeking $22 million and other penalties in connection with
military contracts.
   Target, based in East Farmingdale, N.Y., said the
complaint alleges that former employees embezzled funds from
the unit and as a result "damaged" the U.S. government.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The government alleges that the employees made false
travel and expense reports, inflated invoices from suppliers
and mischarged labor hours to government subcontractors, the
company said.</p>
<p>Target, which makes engineered valves for use in U.S. Navy
nuclear propulsion systems, said the "information currently
available to the company would not, in its opinion,
substantiate a claim for an amount even approaching the sum
claimed." Target said it intends to fight the suit
"vigorously."</p>
<p>A spokesman said the company believes the government
charges result from an investigation conducted by
Curtiss-Wright, Lyndhurst, N.J., in March 1987. The probe
resulted in the indictment and guilty pleas of the former
employees and vendors. The company wasn't charged.</p>
