	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Standard & Poor's Corp. said it is reviewing
the debt ratings of Allied-Signal Inc. with the possibility
of a downgrade.
   The review affects the ratings of Allied-Signal's single-A
senior debt, preliminary single-A Rule 415 shelf registration
senior debt and A-1 commercial paper. About $1.9 billion in
securities are involved, S&P said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The credit-rating agency said it was taking the action
following a decision by Allied-Signal's 40%-owned Union Texas
Petroleum Holdings Inc. to discontinue efforts to sell the
entire company and instead place individual parts on the
auction block.</p>
<p>S&P said the move "creates uncertainty over timing and
value of potential proceeds." Allied-Signal was planning to
use the proceeds from the sale of Union Texas to reduce debt
incurred during its stock repurchase program.</p>
