	<p class="article-leader">According to conventional wisdom, sweeping clean-air laws
will burden U.S. industry with billions of dollars in
pollution-control costs and raise prices for a slew of
commodities and finished goods.
   Not necessarily so, more and more manufacturers say.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Surprisingly, they are actually reducing some costs as
they install new pollution-cutting technologies. But the
benefits come from new manufacturing techniques -- not the
waste and emission treatment encouraged by much environmental
legislation.</p>
<p>And the benefits could be huge. U.S. manufacturing wastes
can be halved by using existing technologies, the
congressional Office of Technology Assessment estimates.
Eliminating another 25% would require research and
development.</p>
<p>It's difficult to estimate the savings achievable through
such manufacturing changes. But roughly $75 billion a year is
being spent on waste and emission treatment, and recent
clean-air legislation may eventually add another $25 billion
if companies stick to business as usual.</p>
<p>"This is money down the tube. If industry reduces waste
10%, that's $10 billion in savings. That's just the start,"
says Michael Overcash, a professor at North Carolina State
University in Raleigh who studies the issue for the
Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
<p>Moreover, American companies produce five times the waste
per dollar of goods sold compared with Japanese companies and
more than twice that of the Germans, according to Joel
Hirschhorn, a former official of the Office of Technology
Assessment who now heads an environmental-technologies
consulting firm. "Waste reduction can have a staggering
effect on the bottom lines of American companies" and can
improve their world-wide competitiveness, he says.</p>
<p>Here are some savings that companies are already
achieving:</p>
<p>-- Carrier Corp. spent $500,000 in 1988 to eliminate toxic
lubricants from its manufacture of air conditioners -- and
slashed annual production costs by $1.2 million.</p>
<p>-- American Telephone & Telegraph Co. recently cut about
$3 million of annual costs by ridding its circuit-board
manufacture of an ozone-depleting compound.</p>
<p>-- Whyco Chromium Co. says a new alloy that it developed
to eliminate harmful byproducts from its process for coating
nuts and screws has trimmed the cost 25%.</p>
<p>-- And 3M Corp. estimates that manufacturing changes to
control pollution have saved it $41 million in the past three
years.</p>
<p>Of course, not all environmental pollution can be
suppressed by manufacturing changes alone. Some measure of
pollution-control technologies will be required to treat
sludge, municipal garbage, and emissions from automobiles and
utilities.</p>
<p>But few companies seem willing to try "clean" technologies
that address the very source of pollution because of up-front
risks and research and development costs associated with
untried approaches, Mr. Hirschhorn says. "It's easier for
companies to resort to easy and low-risk waste-reduction
projects. But that only adds costs."</p>
<p>That's no surprise to James Gustave Speth, president of
the World Resources Institute, a not-for-profit
policy-research center that expects to issue a study on the
economics of environmental technologies next month. "Our
whole history of environmental regulations has been one of
imposing end-of-the-pipe standards which manufacturers meet
with end-of-the-pipe technologies. We have never encouraged a
rapid diffusion of technologies that prevent pollution in the
first place," he says.</p>
<p>The result: million-dollar scrubbers to treat toxic
emissions from power companies' chimneys; expensive
incineration plants to treat hazardous wastes; recycling
technologies for coolants used in cars and refrigerators;
special catalytic converters to cleanse toxic
automobile-tailpipe emissions, and elaborate arrangements to
haul waste to disposal sites.</p>
<p>Yet technologies already available can do away with
expensive "control" measures. Among these are employing
carbon dioxide and other gases to spray paint rather than
using solvent as the medium; sanding and other mechanical
means for stripping paint; batteries that don't use toxic
chemicals (as introduced last year by Polaroid Corp.); and
jet-engine combustion techniques that utility power plants
can use to reduce as much as 80% of the harmful nitrogen
oxides that now must be tamed with ammonia and expensive
catalysts (a technology General Electric Co. is developing).</p>
<p>Carrier, for example, decided in 1987 to adopt "clean"
technologies. In manufacturing air conditioners, the biggest
source of hazardous wastes is the "degreasing" line. There,
copper and aluminum parts pass through tanks of solvents to
be cleaned of oils and debris accumulated during cutting and
soldering.</p>
<p>The United Technologies Corp. unit first developed a
nontoxic lubricant that evaporated. Next, it fine-tuned its
cutting presses to cut metal coils more precisely, with less
friction and less waste. (In the past, high friction in the
cutting press was countered by lubricating the metal.) The
company also designed air conditioners with fewer parts,
reducing the need to cut and rejoin metal.</p>
<p>The result: Carrier eliminated the "degreasing" line,
increased automation, reduced scrap and eliminated down time.
"We also improved overall quality of our product," says
Gerald Bailey, Carrier's director of environmental health and
safety. With fewer joints, the air conditioners leak less, he
says.</p>
<p>AT&T had traditionally cleaned soldering debris and rosins
from circuit boards with chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which
are believed to deplete the earth's protective ozone layer.
Although several environmental services offer equipment to
recycle CFCs, AT&T has been installing new cleaning lines
that use solutions similar to household detergents.</p>
<p>With the new solutions, cleaning a square foot of board
costs 15 cents, compared with 25 cents with CFC. The new
solutions, however, must still be treated before disposal.
But by switching to a rosin that is completely harmless and
evaporates, AT&T expects to "eliminate entirely the cost of
cleaning," says George Wenger, of AT&T's materials and
process group.</p>
<p>Mr. Wenger says environmental standards are tightening so
rapidly that AT&T believes that complying is going to become
increasingly expensive. "Our attitude is that rather than
wait and see how hard it will be," he says, "let's adopt new
technologies that will put us in good competitive position in
the long run."</p>
<p>Even at companies that must continue resorting to
pollution treatment as well, the preventive approach can
generate substantial savings. For example, 3M estimates that
its 2,500 different manufacturing changes since 1975 have
produced total net savings of $500 million while halving its
toxic emissions.</p>
<p>Thomas Zosel, manager of 3M's pollution-prevention
programs, argues that such savings call for flexible
enforcement of the regulations. He suggests that the EPA
could allow additional time for compliance for companies
trying out innovative manufacturing technologies.
"Regulations currently don't allow that," he says.</p>
<p>Whyco Chromium, which coats nuts and bolts and other
automobile fasteners for corrosion resistance, would like to
spend more time improving manufacturing methods than treating
its effluents. Two years ago, the Thomaston, Conn., company
developed an organic compound that required only two to three
coats, half as many as the previous nickel-cadmium-copper
compound. It reorganized its plant with new equipment, but
most of the "several hundred thousand dollars in investment
was in research and development," says Mark Hyner, president.</p>
<p>And research, he says, is something his small company
can't afford under the pressure of compliance deadlines.
"Most of our time and resources are spent dealing with
regulations. I would love for somebody from the EPA to come
in and say `Let's see how we can do things differently' or
for the government to offer tax incentives for innovative
technologies," he says. Mr. Hyner says his company, whose
1989 sales totaled $13 million, spends $2 million annually on
treating and hauling wastes and maintaining a staff that
oversees environmental compliance.</p>
<p>At the EPA, David Berg, director of technology innovation
and economics, says the agency is evaluating how "the current
environmental legislation creates disincentives" for
companies to undertake pollution-prevention technologies. His
office is expected to make recommendations to the EPA
administrator this winter.</p>
<p>Under consideration, he says, are "waivers" that would
give companies that risk innovative technologies additional
time for compliance. Another proposal is to establish
"national centers" where environmental consequences of a new
manufacturing process could be tested without an EPA permit,
which now "costs companies money and time," he says.</p>
<p>Another fundamental consideration also keeps many
companies from adopting "clean" manufacturing technologies. A
switch-over requires manufacturers to make design and other
changes in products whose "specifications" have long been
established by their customers. Small to middle-level
manufacturers that supply parts and components are reluctant
to change those specifications even though this wouldn't
affect product quality, says Bobbie Pettit, who directs
product testing at Premier Chemical Co., a Burke, Va.,
concern that is developing environmentally safe solvents.
"The suppliers are afraid that if they make manufacturing
changes, their customers won't buy," she says.</p>
<p>The outcome of the conflicting pressures will depend upon
whether companies see pollution prevention as productivity
improvement. "That directs attention to improving
manufacturing efficiency in ways not looked at before," says
Mr. Overcash at North Carolina State.</p>
