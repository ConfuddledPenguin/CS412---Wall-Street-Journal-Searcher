	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- The Chicago Mercantile Exchange said that it
received regulatory approval to begin trading broiler-chicken
futures contracts.
   The exchange said it expects to begin trading the
contracts, each of which represent 40,000 pounds of broilers,
on Feb. 7, 1991.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A previous version faded into dormancy in 1982 because
traders were frustrated with its cumbersome delivery
provisions. To fix that, the Merc devised a contract that
doesn't require physical delivery of the underlying broilers.</p>
<p>Instead, the new contract will use an unusual cash
settlement system based on the Agriculture Department's
12-city average price report on Grade A broilers.</p>
<p>Contracts will be traded for delivery in February, April,
May, June, July, August, October and December.</p>
<p>As approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,
the speculative limit is 2,000 broiler contracts in all
contract months combined. Speculators are limited to 500
contracts in any specific contract month.</p>
<p>The exchange slashed its original proposal for a
speculative limit of an enormous 10,000 contracts in all
trading months combined after the CFTC raised questions.</p>
<p>The CFTC is still considering a Merc proposal to trade
options on the broiler futures contracts.</p>
