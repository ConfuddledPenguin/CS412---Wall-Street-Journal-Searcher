	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The dollar is gathering steam and could rise
further, at least in the near term, traders say.
   Now that the Soviet Union has joined the Persian Gulf as a
center of political turmoil, it's hard to say how high the
dollar could rise on flight-to-quality buying, currency
specialists say. Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
resigned last week, warning that a dictatorship was taking
shape in his nation.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"There really is no downside. I only see upside," says
John Hickey, treasurer at Kansallis Osake Pankki, a Finnish
bank.</p>
<p>Late Friday here, the dollar was quoted at 1.5289 marks,
up from 1.5115 marks late Thursday in New York. Against the
Japanese currency, the dollar closed at 135.55 yen, off from
135.85 yen late Thursday. Tokyo markets were closed Monday
for a holiday.</p>
<p>Friday's intraday dollar peaks of 1.5335 marks and 136.35
yen were the highest levels since early October. For the
week, the dollar was up 4.6 pfennigs and 2.60 yen. The dollar
gained more against European currencies than it did against
the yen, because investors believe Europe is more exposed to
troubles in the Soviet Union than Japan is.</p>
<p>The greenback's fortunes have changed sharply.</p>
<p>Only a few months ago, it was spiraling downward because
of the Federal Reserve's easier monetary policy and worries
about the woes of the U.S. economy and banking industry.</p>
<p>While those bearish fundamentals are still in place, they
are being outweighed by the political crisis in the Soviet
Union and rising tension in the Gulf. These developments have
re-established the dollar's role as a "haven" for investors.</p>
<p>Mr. Shevardnadze's resignation put into question the
future of the struggling Soviet government and economy. It
has also cooled much of the cheer about German unification
and the democracy movement that swept Eastern Europe this
year.</p>
<p>As for the Gulf, odds for a war seem to be growing because
of Iraq's refusal to leave Kuwait.</p>
<p>In such a scenario, the dollar may very well be on its way
to 1.56 marks and 140 yen or higher, says Mr. Hickey.</p>
<p>David Horner, senior financial strategist at Merrill Lynch
& Co., says dollar levels of 1.5750 marks and 137.50 yen are
within reach. The year-end comeback is "a meaningful bounce,"
says Mr. Horner, adding that "it may take us months to get
back down" to lower levels.</p>
<p>However, because of the bearish fundamentals, there's some
skepticism about the dollar's potential for further gains.
For example, the U.S. still has stubbornly large budget and
trade deficits. Friday's news of a $48.05 billion November
budget gap, larger than expected, prompted predictions of a
$300 billion deficit for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30.</p>
<p>"I would be on the skeptical side. I honestly believe {the
dollar} will fall back," says Bruno Zbinden, manager of
foreign-exchange and precious metals dealings at Swiss Bank
Corp. It's possible that the dollar will test 1.45 marks and
130 yen in the first quarter of 1991 if traders "go back to
fundamentals" after focusing on politics, he says.</p>
<p>One negative factor may be further credit relaxation by
the Fed, Mr. Zbinden says. He forecasts that the federal
funds rate will slip to 6.5% in the first quarter from the
current 7% norm. The federal funds rate is the charge on
reserves traded among commercial banks for overnight use.</p>
<p>Lower U.S. rates are bearish for the dollar because they
lessen the attractiveness of U.S. debt instruments,
particularly at a time when rates in Germany, Japan and other
nations are steady to higher.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch's Mr. Horner agrees that the dollar could
run into trouble quickly if its flight-to-quality support
crumbles and traders zero in on the troubled U.S. economy
again. "We could fall awfully far awfully fast," he says.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold for
current delivery settled at $382.50 an ounce, down $2.70.
Estimated volume was a moderate 3.5 million ounces.</p>
<p>In early trading in Hong Kong Monday, gold was quoted at
$382.45 an ounce.</p>
