	<p class="article-leader">TARRYTOWN, N.Y. -- Storebrand America Inc. said it plans
to raise its stake in Belvedere Corp. to 54.9% by purchasing
an additional 290,000 common shares.
   The company, a unit of Norwegian insurer Storebrand AS,
declined to disclose terms. It said it is authorized to
acquire the additional 5% stake under a 1989 agreement with
Belvedere, a New York-based reinsurer. The purchases will be
done in the open market or through private transactions,
Storebrand said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Belvedere last month ended talks aimed at the merger of
Belvedere and Storebrand America's Christiania Holding Co. in
exchange for Belvedere's common stock. The transaction would
have increased Storebrand America's stake to 82%.</p>
