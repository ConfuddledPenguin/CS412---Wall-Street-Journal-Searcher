	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Senate Ethics Committee is the most
unpopular assignment a lawmaker can get on Capitol Hill.
After six weeks of hearings in the Keating Five case, it's
easy to see why.
   As politicians, the six senators on the bipartisan
committee are all keenly aware that the televised hearings
focusing on the intervention of five senators with thrift
regulators on behalf of a big contributor, Charles Keating,
have fed public outrage over Washington's ethics. Although
only 26% of the public has been following the hearings
closely, according to the most recent Wall Street Journal/NBC
News poll, nearly three-quarters of those paying attention
say the violations that the Keating Five are accused of are
typical of all members of Congress. Voters also
overwhelmingly favor term limitations for senators and House
members, 74% to 22%, according to the poll. If the panel
doesn't punish at least some members of the Keating Five, the
public's cynicism could further deepen.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But as members of the Senate Club, the Ethics Committee is
tugged in the opposite direction. Respected senior senators,
including Hawaii Democrat Daniel Inouye and South Carolina
Republican Strom Thurmond, have come running to the defense
of Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D., Ariz.), a chief target of the
ethics probe. They say that the five are guilty of nothing
more than zealousness in trying to help a constituent. Sen.
DeConcini has been busy circulating copies of Sen. Inouye's
"We All Do It" testimony to the ethics panel and is expecting
even more of his colleagues to step forward to publicly
defend him. "I haven't leaned on anybody," he says, "but many
of my colleagues agree with those {Inouye's} statements."</p>
<p>From their questioning of witnesses, it's possible to
glean which way committee members are leaning. Sen. Terry
Sanford (D., N.C.) seems to be the five senators' most
stalwart ally and often asks questions that help draw the
sting out of witnesses' testimony. The other North Carolinian
on the panel, Republican Jesse Helms, seems the most outraged
by the senators' behavior. The strongest voices on the panel
-- Chairman Howell Heflin (D., Ala.) and Sen. Warren Rudman
(R., N.H.) -- have both seemed deeply disturbed by some of
the testimony. The two other senators, David Pryor (D., Ark.)
and Trent Lott (R., Miss.), are difficult to read.</p>
<p>Special counsel Robert Bennett has already recommended
that Sens. John Glenn (D., Ohio) and John McCain (R., Ariz.)
be exonerated, and they probably will be. It seems equally
probable that Alan Cranston (D., Calif.), who has already
announced his retirement from the Senate when his term ends
in 1992, will face the stiffest penalty because of the
uncomfortably close links between some of Sen. Cranston's
actions and Mr. Keating's nearly $1 million in contributions
to his political causes. But the fact that the senator has
cancer makes it unlikely that his colleagues would have the
stomach to expel him -- the harshest sanction. He could face
censure or denunciation.</p>
<p>Sen. DeConcini is likely to receive some kind of reprimand
-- maybe even censurefor leaning too hard on regulators on
Mr. Keating's behalf. The fate of Sen. Donald Riegle (D.,
Mich.) is hardest to predict because his gravest sin appears
to be a lack of candor with the panel.</p>
<p>The ethics panel will conclude the hearing and begin
deliberations next month. Some senators are already dreading
an ugly floor fight because any punishment stiffer than
reprimand requires full Senate approval. "It could be a real
blood bath," predicts one GOP senator.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>In a private meeting of the committee, a transcript of
which was released recently, the increasing tension between
Mr. Bennett and the senators' defense lawyers is obvious. All
of the lawyers involved in the case, including Mr. Bennett,
are part of a small, fraternal, white-collar defense bar in
Washington. They've worked together on other cases and often
attend the same parties. But during the Keating Five case, in
which Mr. Bennett has reversed roles and serves as
prosecutor, they are pals no more. During the questioning of
James Grogan, a lobbyist for Lincoln Savings & Loan
Association, the thrift controlled by Mr. Keating, the
attorney for Sen. McCain got into an angry confrontation with
Mr. Bennett. "I don't want any cheap {expletive deleted} from
you," the lawyer, John Dowd, snapped at the special counsel.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Sen. McCain is not only the only Republican member of the
Keating Five, but also the only one of the five who faces
re-election in 1992, now that Sen. Cranston has announced his
retirement. The Arizona Republican is back home trying to
repair political damage, appearing on a slew of call-in shows
and attending meetings with political supporters. Although
the Keating case follows him like a cloud, he says most of
the calls and questions he receives deal with the Persian
Gulf crisis, a shift of emphasis he has gladly seized on. Mr.
McCain has told the ethics panel that he plans to leave on a
trip to the Middle East and Vietnam on Jan. 5. "I've told
them I'm gone after that," he says. Mr. McCain will be the
first senator to be questioned by the panel after hearings
resume Jan. 2.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The long Keating Five investigation, which began in
October 1989, has also taken a toll on some former associates
of the fallen thrift executive. Mr. Grogan, who once earned
$300,000 as a lobbyist for Mr. Keating, is now in less-cushy
circumstances. "I'm a consultant," he told the ethics panel,
"which is a common way of saying you're unemployed."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>As problems mounted at Lincoln S&L, Mr. Keating apparently
became more and more brazen in his political requests. An
affidavit from Ron Ober, a former aide to Sen. DeConcini,
discloses that the thrift executive wanted Sen. DeConcini to
offer to support the nomination of John Tower to be defense
secretary in return for the Bush administration's help in
persuading federal regulators to approve a sale of Lincoln.
Mr. Ober says he refused to approach Sen. DeConcini with such
a request.</p>
<p>In late 1988, according to the affidavit, Mr. Ober warned
Sen. DeConcini that he should be "wary of requests for
assistance from Charles Keating and Lincoln." But Mr. Ober's
former boss didn't heed the advice. After Lincoln was seized
by the government in April 1989, Mr. Ober says he received a
call from the senator. "We had a brief conversation in which
he commented that he had not taken my earlier political
suggestion concerning Mr. Keating. I did not ask him what he
meant by this comment, and he did not say."</p>
