	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The federal government's budget deficit
totaled $48.05 billion in November, compared with $29.73
billion a year earlier, the Treasury Department said.
   Last month's budget gap compared with a deficit of $31.46
billion in October. In its monthly statement, the Treasury
said receipts totaled $72.82 billion last month, compared
with $71.21 billion a year earlier and $78.71 billion in
October. Outlays totaled $120.87 billion last month, compared
with $100.95 billion a year earlier and $110.17 billion in
October.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The slim increase in revenues and the big increase in
outlays reflected the slowing economy and increasing costs
because of the large U.S. military presence in the Persian
Gulf.</p>
<p>For the first two months of fiscal 1991, which began Oct.
1, government receipts totaled $151.53 billion, compared with
$139.64 billion during the same period last year. Outlays
through November totaled $231.04 billion, compared with
$195.45 billion a year earlier. That produced a total deficit
of $79.51 billion for the first two months of fiscal 1991,
compared with $55.82 billion during the same period in the
previous fiscal year. The deficit for all of fiscal 1990 was
$220.39 billion.</p>
<p>The government paid $21.88 billion in interest last month
on the federal debt.</p>
<p>Revenue from the defense cooperation account, which
consists of contributions from U.S. allies to help cover the
cost of the U.S. military operation in Saudi Arabia, totaled
$2.82 billion in November, compared with $1.63 billion last
month, the Treasury said.</p>
<p>Military outlays rose in November to $29.02 billion,
compared with $24.09 billion in October. So far in fiscal
1991, military spending has totaled $53.11 billion, up from
$43.73 billion for the same period in 1990.</p>
