	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Amid a slowing economy, Japan's Finance Ministry
is expected to propose today a mildly stimulative budget for
the year that begins April 1.
   The ministry is expected to call for an increase of about
6.2% in overall spending, to around 70.34 trillion yen ($517
billion). In the economically important "general
expenditures" category, the ministry is expected to recommend
an increase of about 5.3% -- the biggest rise in 12 years --
to around 37.24 billion yen. The category excludes such items
as interest payments and transfer payments to local
governments.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Strong growth in spending on public works, in line with a
pledge made earlier this year during the so-called Structural
Impediments Initiative trade talks with the U.S., is likely
to be the most stimulative aspect of the budget proposal,
economists say.</p>
<p>At the same time, the ministry will continue to emphasize
restraining the national debt burden, so the country will be
better positioned to deal with a larger retired population
after the turn of the century. The new budget will, however,
provide for about 5.34 trillion yen in bonds for specific
construction projects -- about 250 billion yen less than the
amount included in the current budget, according to Japanese
news reports.</p>
<p>The Finance Ministry's budget proposal provides the basic
framework for the government's spending plan. While it is
subject to negotiation at the cabinet level, modifications
are usually slight.</p>
<p>The annual budget planning comes amid signs that Japan's
economic growth is slowing from the torrid pace recorded
earlier this year. The cabinet on Saturday adopted an
economic projection of 3.8% growth, after inflation, for the
fiscal year. That would be down from the 5.2% rate now
estimated for the year that ends March 31.</p>
<p>The government projection for next year is toward the high
end of recent private forecasts, which have ranged from 2.9%
to 4.2%. Even at the lower end of that scale, however, growth
in Japan would continue to outstrip the levels expected for
most other industrialized nations. The Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development last week said it
expects growth for its 24-nation group to run at about 1.8%
in the first six months of 1991, picking up to 2.4% in the
second half.</p>
<p>In explaining Japan's projection for next year, an
official of Japan's Economic Planning Agency said growth in
private investment in plant and equipment is expected to ease
to 6.8% after inflation, down from the 11.7% rate estimated
for this year. Private consumption should remain firm, with
real growth of about 4.1% next year, compared with 4.2% in
the current year, according to Seiichi Toshida, deputy
director-general of the agency's coordination bureau.</p>
<p>The decline in domestic private investment will leave
government policy with a larger role to play in the coming
year.</p>
<p>Robert Feldman, a Salomon Brothers Inc. economist based in
Tokyo, says the new budget is likely to be "mildly
stimulative" in its emphasis on public-works spending. Tax
changes aren't likely to have any economic impact in the
coming year, he adds. (A recently proposed new national land
tax wouldn't take effect until 1992.)</p>
<p>Mr. Feldman notes that a continuing labor shortage may
constrain the government's ability to raise public works
spending. The construction industry has been working at close
to full capacity. Still, with real estate beginning to soften
after a long boom period, the pace of new private
construction may ease next year.</p>
<p>Growth in defense spending is expected to slow, in line
with a new five-year defense plan adopted last week. The new
plan calls for average annual growth, after inflation, of 3%
-- down from 5.4% under the plan that expires in March. The
Finance Ministry is likely to propose defense spending of
about 5% over the current year's 4.16 trillion yen, an
increase consistent with the guideline once inflation is
factored in.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Japan will gradually increase its share of the
costs of basing U.S. soldiers here. Japan now pays about 40%
of the costs associated with the 50,000 U.S. soldiers in
Japan, and plans to increase that to 50%.</p>
<p>The Foreign Ministry has requested a 9.7% increase in
foreign aid.</p>
<p>The cabinet is scheduled to review and adopt the Finance
Ministry's budget proposals by Dec. 29.</p>
