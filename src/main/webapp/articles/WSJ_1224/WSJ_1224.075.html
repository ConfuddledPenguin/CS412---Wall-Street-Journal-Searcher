	<p class="article-leader">WEEHAWKEN, N.J. -- Horn & Hardart Co., best-known for
creating the American automat cafeteria, is getting out of
the restaurant business.
   The company said it will sell its last restaurant
business, International King's Table, to focus on its
direct-mail marketing business.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Last Friday, the company said it will be taking a
significant fourth-quarter charge resulting from its
divestiture of the restaurant business, which it plans to
complete by the end of March. International King, which
operates 83 buffet-style restaurants in the West coast, had a
$5.2 million net loss in the first nine months of this year.</p>
<p>The divestiture marks Horn & Hardart's exit from its once
core restaurant business in favor of Hanover Direct Inc., its
direct-marketing concern. In the past year, the company has
sold or is trying to sell nearly all of its East Coast
restaurant holdings, including Bojangles' Fried Chicken 'N
Biscuits, Tony Roma's Italian restaurants in New York and
Arby's in southern Florida.</p>
<p>According to Jack E. Rosenfeld, president and chief
executive of Horn & Hardart, the company decision to change
its line of business was motivated by continuing losses in
its diverse restaurant holdings. "With 10 years of trying
many facets of the restaurant business, the company wasn't
able to make any kind of return on it," he said.</p>
<p>For the third-quarter, Horn & Hardart reported a net loss
of $3.2 million, or 23 cents a share, compared with a net
loss of $1.6 million, or 12 cents a share, the previous year.</p>
<p>Hanover Direct is expected to report a 44% increase in
revenue this year to $550 million from $382 million in 1989.</p>
