	<p class="article-leader">The nation's top AIDS drug regulator, a target of
activists fighting the disease, resigned her post, citing
battle fatigue and burnout.
   Dr. Ellen Cooper, chief of the Food and Drug
Administration's anti-viral drug division, asked the agency
for a transfer. She was often criticized by activists as an
obstructionist. Her departure and a search for a successor
may further delay new drugs to combat acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"My situation in my current job is untenable," the
40-year-old doctor said in a telephone interview from her
Rockville, Md., office. She said she planned to take
Christmas week off, and return some time shortly after to
clean out her desk. Her departure complicates the transition
of the FDA's new commissioner, David Kessler, who is
succeeding Frank E. Young after a long interregnum.</p>
<p>"Politics has become paramount, but science should have a
role," she said, citing the conflict among four factions:
people with AIDS, companies that make the drugs they need,
scientists who test the drugs and regulators who approve
them. Most recently, she has been criticized over the delay
of two experimental agents, DDC, made by Hoffmann-La Roche
Inc., the U.S. unit of Roche Holding Ltd., and DDI, made by
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.</p>
<p>The urgency is heightened as the fourth anniversary nears
of the FDA's approval of Wellcome PLC's AZT. Since AZT went
on the market in early 1987, not a single alternative drug
has been approved to combat the virus. Yet about half of
those with AIDS cannot tolerate AZT because of side effects.</p>
<p>An issue that dogged Dr. Cooper's tenure was liberalizing
criteria for approving drugs. Traditionally, the standard of
proving effectiveness has been better survival, or fewer
deaths, on a drug. However, pressure is building for the FDA
to accept alternative criteria, such as rises in the level of
immune cells called T4 cells, as signs of improvement.</p>
<p>One of Dr. Cooper's sharpest critics, Martin Delaney,
leader of the San Francisco-based activist group Project
Inform, said it was "too bad {Dr. Cooper} bailed out" before
DDC and DDI were approved. Mr. Delaney said, "she's still
holding out for traditional proofs of efficacy, and we need
new thinking. If that means new blood, so be it."</p>
<p>Some activists were apprehensive the resignation might
further slow regulatory review.</p>
<p>"There may be people who think this is a good thing, but
I'm not one of them. I think this is a disaster," said Jay
Lipner, an attorney with the Lambda Legal Defense Fund, a gay
rights group in New York. He predicted Dr. Cooper's departure
would delay, not hasten, the approval of DDC and DDI.</p>
<p>Dr. Cooper said her "stress and burnout" were exacerbated
in recent days by an erosion of support from within the
Department of Health and Human Services. She charged some
officials leak preliminary data to activists, "feeding the
frenzy" for earlier drug approval while publicly blaming the
FDA. "It's convenient to make the agency the scapegoat for
the problems of drug development," she said. Top AIDS
officials in the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases didn't return phone calls.</p>
<p>However, National Cancer Institute director Samuel Broder
praised Dr. Cooper for her "enormous intellectual integrity,
even though we didn't always agree. I think highly of her."</p>
<p>Dr. Cooper insisted she wasn't resisting new standards to
speed drug approval, but rather challenging researchers to
deliver their best data in support of new drug approval
criteria.</p>
<p>"I'm very open to using {T4 cell counts} or other
surrogate markers of drug efficacy," she said. "But there's
got to be an analysis of the data by statisticians,
researchers and clinicians. That's just starting now," only
after vigorous arm-twisting, she added.</p>
<p>She acknowledged other signs of drug performance -- such
as weight gain, reduced infections and improved neurological
function -- can indicate that the virus is in retreat "if
they all go in the right direction." But she said too many
people wanted to take such signs on faith.</p>
