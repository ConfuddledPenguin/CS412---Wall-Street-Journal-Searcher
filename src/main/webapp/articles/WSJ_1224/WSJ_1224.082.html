	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- Action Industries Inc., a marketer of
houseware and giftware promotional programs, said it expects
a "material decline" in second-quarter sales, citing order
cancellations reflecting the general economic downturn, but
predicted it will be profitable for the period. A year
earlier, Action earned $3.4 million, or 62 cents a share, on
sales of $57.6 million.</p>
