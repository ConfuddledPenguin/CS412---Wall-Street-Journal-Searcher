	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- President Bush, supporting an arcane
provision in the deficit-reduction law, said he would veto a
proposed change to House rules that "would begin to undo the
recently enacted budget agreement."
   In a letter to House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.), Mr.
Bush said he opposed the rules change, which would require
that any bill specify that cost estimates by the
Congressional Budget Office or Congress's Joint Tax Committee
be used to determine if a bill complies with the new budget
law. The proposed change has been endorsed by House Democrats
and is due for ratification by the full House next month.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Although arcane, the issue is important because the law
blocks any spending increase or tax cut that isn't offset by
a spending cut or tax increase elsewhere. Unlike the proposed
rule, the new budget law gives primacy to White House budget
office estimates, a provision the Bush administration fought
to include.</p>
<p>White House aides and House Republicans see the pending
rule as a way for the Democratic-controlled Congress to
circumvent the strict spending limits imposed by the budget
package. The Democrats see the GOP position as a partisan
power grab, which could undercut their ability to legislate
effectively.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Bush last week seemed to suggest that the
provision lacked teeth. Explaining why the administration
might decide against proposing a cut in capital-gains tax
rates next year, he cited congressional cost estimates that
such a tax cut would lose money -- and therefore require a
compensating tax increase. Administration estimates differ.</p>
<p>In his letter, released by the White House last Friday,
the president asked Mr. Foley: "If specifically negotiated
and agreed provisions are to be undone before the ink is dry,
how can we expect the agreement to be taken seriously?"</p>
<p>House Minority Leader Bob Michel (R., Ill.) plans to
challenge the rule change on the House floor, aides said. But
such challenges rarely prevail in the Democratic-dominated
House. Mr. Michel also plans an attempt to force a vote on a
balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution.</p>

<p>PRESIDENT BUSH said he will veto any bill specifying that
congressional cost estimates supersede administration
estimates. Mr. Bush's statement was characterized incorrectly
in Monday's edition.</p>
