	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- France's foreign trade deficit narrowed
significantly to a preliminary, seasonally adjusted 601
million francs ($117.1 million) in November from a revised
6.69 billion franc gap in October, which had been estimated
earlier at 5.87 billion francs, the government said.
   The latest result came in well below the previous
forecasts of Paris market economists for a November deficit
of about 7.6 billion francs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Unadjusted November data showed a deficit of 1.7 billion
francs, after a revised October deficit of 6.77 billion
francs.</p>
<p>For the first 11 months, France's adjusted trade deficit
fell to 44 billion francs from the year-earlier deficit of
44.51 billion francs. The cumulative deficit was 39.84
billion francs on an unadjusted basis, compared with 41.65
billion francs a year earlier.</p>
