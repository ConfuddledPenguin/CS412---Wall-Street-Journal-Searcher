republics.
   KGB chief Kryuchkov, speaking to Soviet lawmakers, warned
Saturday that the West is stepping up espionage and economic

take steps to defuse tensions. Legislators are to vote today
on a new government structure and broadened presidential
powers. A vote is expected later in the week on a union
treaty allowing more freedom for republics while retaining a
strong central government.</p>
