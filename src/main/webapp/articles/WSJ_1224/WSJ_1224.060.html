	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- CrossLand Savings said it reached a
long-sought agreement with federal regulators that allows it
to convert debt and preferred stock to equity in order to
raise its capital levels.
   The agreement follows an earlier rejection by regulators,
who had wanted CrossLand to do more than convert the
cumulative preferred to raise capital. It also comes at a
time when the viability of several major banks and thrifts in
the Northeast, including CrossLand, has been questioned as
they continue to post substantial losses and carry high
amounts of bad real estate loans.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>CrossLand, one of the nation's largest thrifts with assets
exceeding $11 billion, said the Office of Thrift Supervision
has asked it to submit a plan within 45 days for raising its
core capital level to 3% of assets by the end of 1991 and 5%
by the end of 1994.</p>
<p>Peter Cunningham, senior vice president of CrossLand,
said, "We've worked for some time" with the OTS on the plan,
and the thrift expects to have the plan submitted in about
two weeks. The 3% level is standard for thrifts, he said, but
CrossLand will increase to 5% because of the higher level of
risk associated with its loan portfolio.</p>
