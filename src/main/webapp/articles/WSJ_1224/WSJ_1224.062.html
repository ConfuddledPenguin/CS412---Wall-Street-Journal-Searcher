	<p class="article-leader">MAYNARD, Mass. -- Digital Equipment Corp., a computer
concern, said it will close a disk, tape and optical storage
manufacturing and design facility in Enfield, Conn., moving
workers and operations to Springfield, Mass.
   A spokeswoman said the move won't result in the loss of
jobs but will cut costs by consolidating operations at the
nearby Springfield site. She said Digital owns the
77,000-square-foot Enfield plant, situated on 88 acres. Its
future hasn't been determined, she said.</p>
