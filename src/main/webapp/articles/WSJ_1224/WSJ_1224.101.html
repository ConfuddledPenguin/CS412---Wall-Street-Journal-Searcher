	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Texas Instruments Inc. said it reached a
five-year licensing agreement with Samsung Electronics Co. of
South Korea, settling one of several patent issues with
foreign chip makers.
   The company didn't disclose the amount of royalties it
expects to receive from Samsung but said the total will
"greatly exceed" royalties under the chip makers' previous
agreement, which expires at year end. The new agreement is
subject to approval by the South Korean government.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Several other licensing agreements between Texas
Instruments and foreign chip makers expire at the end of this
year, and the company said negotiations for new agreements
were continuing.</p>
