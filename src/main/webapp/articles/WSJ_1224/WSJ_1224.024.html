	<div class="article-body"><p>During last Christmas season, President Bush ordered U.S.
forces to invade Panama. More than 700 U.S. and Panamanian
soldiers and civilians were killed while Congress enjoyed the
holidays. It was not called war.</p>
<p>The Ghost of Christmas Present</p>
<p>The joy is gone from this Christmas. My daughter and
son-in-law are in the infantry and are joining 400,000 other
troops in the Persian Gulf. They joined the Army together
hoping to finish college, and now that choice may cost them
their lives in yet another undeclared war.</p>
<p>Mothers must be braver than fathers. I see them on the
evening news fighting back tears while saying they support
the president. But I am having trouble. Suddenly, issues like
control of oil, stable monarchies and shaky coalitions boil
down to the love between a father and daughter. My sorrow for
her is equaled only by my despair. I may never see her again.</p>
<p>War is more than a military maneuver or a United Nations
resolution. For perhaps tens of thousands, it will be the way
their lives end. As a former U.S. Army soldier who served
through the Berlin Airlift and the Cuban missile crisis, I
know the fear of death our troops are feeling. But this is
different.</p>
<p>Let there be no doubt about it, if the fuse is lit, it
will be war. The president insisted that the U.N. approve the
use of force, and he changed our goals from protecting the
Saudi king to invading Kuwait and Iraq to wrench Saddam
Hussein from power. As a result, a half-million troops on
each side are pointing the most destructive weapons ever
known at each other across Mr. Bush's line in the Saudi sand.</p>
<p>My greed is at a more personal level than the price of oil
or saving Western life styles. I do not want my daughter's
name etched in stone like those who died in Vietnam. I
believe her destiny holds a higher purpose than restoring
Kuwaiti royalty to the throne.</p>
<p>Therefore, I have written her and her husband and urged
them not to show up at the battlefield unless Congress
declares war. If her blood is to spill, it should taint the
hands of Congress as well. Too many presidents have asked us
to overlook their abuse of the same Constitution they were
elected to uphold. Congress has a legal and moral obligation
to the American people to debate the issues before sending
our troops to death.</p>
<p>The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come</p>
<p>If Congress declares war, what comfort will loved ones
take next Christmas? Will the youthful souls of the dead
return with their mangled bodies? Or will they float like
black angels of death over the Jewish Wailing Wall or a
Moslem temple or the tomb of Christ, haunting the nations
that sent them to die in the desert?</p>
<p>It is to be hoped that, like Ebenezer Scrooge, Congress
will awaken from its holiday sleep filled with a new spirit
of Christmas, take charge of the Gulf crisis, open
negotiations and send the world a message of peace, by voting
no to war.</p>
