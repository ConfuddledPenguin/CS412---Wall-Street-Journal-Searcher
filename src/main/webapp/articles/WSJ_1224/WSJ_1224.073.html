	<p class="article-leader">Santa Claus is in real trouble. His North Pole Inc.
headquarters is under siege. No, it's not the avalanche of
Christmas lists and letters he's receiving from good boys and
girls around the world. He's prepared for that every year.
And it's not the troubled economy -- he's bound and
determined to come through for those kids regardless of the
price of oil or the discouraging direction of economic
indicators.
   As he prepares for his busiest season (really his only
season) of the year, Mr. Claus is being distracted by a blitz
of time-consuming investigations by a wide variety of
government agencies. Now, don't jump to conclusions. Mr.
Claus is truly a model employer. Youngsters and adults alike
know that the jolly fat man's integrity and honesty are
absolutely impeccable.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>And yet, one after the other, federal and state agents
have descended on his workshops at North Pole Inc. to pore
over business and employment records, interview employees,
and otherwise disrupt Old St. Nick and his elves from their
preparation for the big night. Here's a sampling of the
charges and complaints Mr. Claus and his human resources
staff and lawyers have been contending with:</p>
<p>The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is
investigating a commissioner's charge that Mr. Claus has
engaged in a pattern and practice of employment
discrimination. The charge alleges that Mr. Claus has no
non-elf employees at all in any of his workshops.</p>
<p>Mr. Claus's defense is based on the argument that being an
elf is a bona fide occupational qualification. Thus far, the
EEOC has rejected that argument and continued its
investigation. The commission has threatened to sue Mr. Claus
in federal court if he doesn't come up with $1 million in
back pay for an affected class of non-elf applicants for
workshop jobs and agree to a consent decree providing for
non-elf hiring quotas and training programs as a remedy for
his past discrimination.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, officials from the U.S. Labor Department have
been keeping Mr. Claus quite busy too. The Office of Federal
Contract Compliance Programs has just completed a three-day
compliance review audit of his affirmative-action plan
maintained under Executive Order 11246. It concluded that Mr.
Claus's workshops show gross underutilization of women and
minorities in three job categories. Mr. Claus has been
threatened with debarrment unless he modifies his goals and
timetables and gives Mrs. Claus an immediate promotion to
vice president of operations.</p>
<p>Other Labor Department bureaucrats have been investigating
a complaint that Mr. Claus has discriminated against his
elves in violation of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 by
refusing to reasonably accommodate them as individuals with
disabilities. He has been charged with failing and refusing
to make the North Pole workshops fully accessible to the
elves and refusing to take reasonable steps to allow them to
perform only the essential functions of their jobs. Mr. Claus
has responded that the government's demands would be an undue
hardship. The dispute seems destined for long and expensive
litigation.</p>
<p>Mr. Claus has been charged with violations of the
Occupational Safety and Health Act as well. The Labor
Department has cited him for willful violations of
recordkeeping regulations and will seek record fines of $1.2
million. The government claims that Mr. Claus has failed to
include in his OSHA-100 log a wide variety of splinters and
scrapes sustained by elves working on Christmas gifts for
youngsters around the world. Mr. Claus says that Uncle Sam is
engaged in nit-picking over trivial nicks that required no
more than Band-Aid treatment.</p>
<p>Mr. Claus's pipe smoking has also become a source of
bureaucratic interest. The government claims that he has
persistently violated the Clean Indoor Air Act by failing and
refusing to designate appropriate non-smoking areas.
Undisputed evidence shows that Mr. Claus has regularly
wandered through North Pole Inc.'s workshops puffing his
pipe. According to government agents, when challenged by
worker elves, he has demonstrated his willful disdain for the
law by chortling "ho-ho-ho" with a jolly twinkle in his eye.</p>
<p>Several of Mr. Claus's administrative elves have been
laboring feverishly to complete summary plan descriptions for
the North Pole's generous pension plans pursuant to the
requirements of the Employment Retirement Income Security Act
and regulations. They are also drafting COBRA notices for
several dissident elves who resigned "to pursue other
interests" (reportedly with the Easter Bunny's rapidly
growing operation).</p>
<p>Poor old Mr. Claus is also facing miscellaneous charges of
violating the child-labor laws (for employing under-age
elves), the Immigration Reform and Control Act (for failing
to require the proper documentation from alien elves), and
the wage-hour laws (for failing to pay elves overtime for
after-hours sled duty). And, worst of all, the EPA is rumored
to have designated North Pole Inc. as a Superfund site due to
centuries of dumping lead and paint from the crafting of toy
soldiers.</p>
<p>So, with responding to federal subpoenas, and answering
government questionnaires, and filling out federal forms, and
providing government investigators with thousands of
documents and corporate records, it's little wonder Mr. Claus
is worried about making his rounds tonight. But one
government official did not share Mr. Claus's concern for
productivity and service -- "Bah, humbug] Just make sure he
wears a hard hat and safety harness on his way down those
chimneys."</p>
<p>And, a Merry Christmas to all (on Form MC-276-90, in
triplicate).</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Mr. Skoning, a Chicago attorney, is willing to represent
Santa Claus pro bono.</p>
