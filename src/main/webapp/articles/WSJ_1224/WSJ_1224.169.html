	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A congressional committee said it found no
evidence to support claims that the Central Intelligence
Agency was involved with savings-and-loan failures.
   The House Intelligence Committee said Friday that it was
closing a nine-month preliminary inquiry into allegations
that the CIA had fraudulently used S&L funds, among other
claims. Those charges, the committee concluded, were "based
primarily on second-hand information."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The conclusions were disclosed in a letter to Rep. Frank
Annunzio (D., Ill.), chairman of a House banking
subcommittee. He sought the investigation after a series of
articles in the Houston Post that alleged the CIA or
organized crime was involved in the failures of 26 thrifts.</p>
<p>The Intelligence Committee said it investigated three
specific charges: that CIA operatives used connections with
S&Ls to fraudulently obtain loans, that the agency used S&L
funds to support covert operations and that the CIA
intervened with federal prosecutors to deter them from
pursuing particular cases.</p>
<p>The committee said it interviewed several individuals who
claimed to know others who had information about CIA
involvement in S&L failures. But either those parties
"refused to identify the source, or the source refused to be
interviewed," said the letter, signed by chairman Anthony
Beilenson (D., Calif.).</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors denied that the CIA had attempted to
quash any S&L prosecutions. "The federal prosecutors and law
enforcement personnel interviewed were quite clear on that
point," Mr. Beilenson said.</p>
<p>The congressional investigators said the CIA did use
routine financial services at four of the S&Ls named by the
Houston Post. "Those were consistent with routine agency
practices," Mr. Beilenson said.</p>
