	<p class="article-leader">WEST CALDWELL, N.J. -- Merrimac Industries Inc. said
shareholders approved a change in its charter that eliminated
cumulative voting in the election of its directors.
   The change, approved at a special shareholders meeting,
means that each shareholder will be entitled to one vote per
common share. It represents a setback for Matec Corp.,
Merrimac's largest shareholder with a 16.2% stake, which had
sought to enhance its voting power.</p>
