	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- President Bush took action that postponed
the threat of a possible nationwide railroad strike until
mid-February.
   The president again extended the reporting deadline for a
three-man emergency board, from yesterday until Jan. 15. In
May, Mr. Bush named the board to try to resolve health-care
costs, crew size and other contract issues, and later
extended its reporting date to yesterday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the Railway Labor Act, the newest extension put off
for another 30 days, beyond the Jan. 15 deadline, any strike
by the unions and any move by railroads to adopt their own
labor-contract terms unilaterally.</p>
<p>The White House has said that a rail strike, besides
idling railroad workers and stranding riders, could cause
more than 500,000 layoffs in the economy within two weeks.
This winter, such changes would occur when the economy is
already likely sinking into a recession.</p>
<p>The emergency board finished its deliberations about a
week ago and began work on a report. Its recommendations
won't be binding, but Congress has typically acted to avert
long rail strikes in the past by enacting board
recommendations into law. That last happened in 1982, when
Congress ended a four-day strike by the Brotherhood of
Locomotive Engineers.</p>
<p>This time, large railroads and 11 unions are far apart on
a range of issues that they have been negotiating for more
than two years, and chances of a strike are considered high.
That could be complicated if the U.S. becomes involved in a
war in the Middle East, rail unions admit.</p>
<p>One of the biggest issues is health costs. Railroads want
workers to start paying some of the premiums. And for the
first time in 20 years, railroads are seeking to boost the
deductible amounts that employees must pay on claims.</p>
<p>The railroads also want to trim operating crew sizes to a
maximum of two from a current three to five, or else reduce
wages of each crew member by 25% or more. Further, the
railroads seek work-rule changes such as boosting the mileage
that crews travel for a day's pay to 160 miles from a current
108 miles.</p>
<p>The unions oppose all these industry demands and insist
they can continue to resist them. The railroads aren't "going
to impose something we don't want, because we can lick 'em in
Congress," says Richard Kilroy, president of the
Transportation Communication Union, which represents railway
clerks.</p>
<p>For their part, the unions seek wage increases of 30% over
three years, boosts in cost-of-living pay and job protection
in sales of short lines, among other demands.</p>
<p>Railroads say they need more cost cutting so they can
compete with trucks, and to improve their return on
investment. Unions counter that they've given enough
concessions in the past, and now need improvements.</p>
