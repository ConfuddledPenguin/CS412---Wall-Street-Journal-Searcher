	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- For years, it took the faith of a Boston Red
Sox fan to believe that small-company stocks would finally
quit trailing the overall market and resume their former
starring role.
   But now some formerly skeptical big investors are starting
to become believers, a trend that could give a boost to the
perennially disappointing over-the-counter market.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Appetite for small stocks is reviving among pension fund
managers, overseas investors and other previously indifferent
traders. In recent weeks, analysts and money managers say,
they have been scrambling to meet clients' demands for
information on smaller shares.</p>
<p>"There's an awareness that the time to be in small U.S.
stocks is {when the U.S. is} coming out of a recession," says
Bill Church, manager of the $11 million Cowen Opportunity
Fund of New York. Japanese and European investors
particularly have been knocking at his door.</p>
<p>Even short-sellers, who reap their profits when stock
prices decline, have redirected much of their energy away
from small stocks and into exchange-listed stocks, arguing
that overpriced shares are getting harder to find in the OTC
market. "We're finding more opportunities in larger names,"
says short seller Joseph Feshbach, who oversees nearly $1
billion for Southgate Partners of Palo Alto, Calif.</p>
<p>"Small stocks take a beating in times like the present,
when marginal companies are being squeezed," says Laurence
Siegel, managing director of Ibbotson Associates Inc., a
Chicago investment research firm. "But in a recovery, they
just take off like a rocket."</p>
<p>Ibbotson's data in the accompanying chart provide a
compelling argument (see accompanying illustration -- WSJ
Dec. 24, 1990). In the wake of the past seven recessions,
smaller companies' shares outperformed larger issues every
time, at least for the 12 months starting after the
recession.</p>
<p>Returns on small stocks lagged for much of the 1980s.
Small stocks returned only 1.8% a year on a compounded basis
from July 1983 through September this year, far behind the
12.8% return for larger stocks, according to Mr. Siegel. The
small-stock arena saw post-crash returns of 23% in 1988 and
10% in 1989.</p>
<p>But for this year so far, the Nasdaq Composite Index of
smaller stocks is down about 18% even with its 14% rally
since mid-October. Meanwhile, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock
index is down only 6.6%.</p>
<p>Short-sellers sell borrowed stock in hopes that a price
decline will allow them to profit by returning cheaper shares
to the lender; they have long been known for targeting
smaller stocks. But just as high prices in the mid to late
1980s made small stocks ripe for a fall, there now are
"speculative excesses" in big stocks, says Mr. Feshbach.</p>
<p>The popular practice of indexing -- trading a basket of
stocks included in such indexes as the S&P 500 -- has made
many large stocks overpriced; others are vulnerable because
of heavy debts, he says. About half the Feshbachs' 300 short
positions now are in exchange-listed stocks, including such
household names as Citicorp, McDonnell Douglas and
Westinghouse Electric.</p>
<p>The risk that the slowing economy will trip some of the
nation's largest and strongest companies is likely to benefit
smaller issues. "When growth prospects for the S&P as a whole
get dashed, then small stocks begin to boom. That's beginning
to happen," says Richard Bernstein, Merrill Lynch
quantitative analyst. The S&P 500 companies are now expected
to grow at about 7% a year over the next five years, he notes
-- the slowest estimated growth rate in about eight or nine
years.</p>
<p>Skeptics remain, of course. "I think we have to be
patient," says Harry Adams, investment manager for the $410
million Minneapolis Teachers Retirement Fund. Since 1987,
about 10% of the fund's money has been invested in lagging
small- to medium-sized companies. Mr. Adams doesn't expect
the group to do well until the Mideast crisis is resolved and
larger stocks improve.</p>
<p>Investors still hungry for growth may turn to some of the
faster-growing small companies that turn out such products as
new drugs, medical instruments or computer gadgets that no
one else makes, Mr. Bernstein notes.</p>
<p>The slowing returns of large stocks are beginning to fall
in line with those of shunned smaller shares. For the first
time in about six years, Mr. Bernstein says, the average
return on equity for stocks traded on the New York Stock
Exchange and the over-the-counter Nasdaq system were roughly
comparable for the past few quarters.</p>
<p>Debt burdens many large companies, adds Mary Lisanti, vice
president of the Evergreen Fund in Purchase, N.Y. "The
majority of small companies have healthier balance sheets,"
she says, explaining that because many have been squeezed out
by banks, they've been forced to finance their own growth.</p>
<p>Among the stocks Ms. Lisanti expects to outperform the
broad market are those of Right Management Consultants, a
Philadelphia provider of outplacement services; Digi
International, a Minneapolis maker of low-cost computer
equipment; and SciMed Life Systems, a Maple Grove, Minn.,
maker of medical equipment used in heart-related procedures.</p>
<p>Shares of companies growing at 15% a year or more can be
found in the OTC market, making them competitive with the
falling interest rates on bonds, says Alan Radlo, manager of
the Fidelity OTC Fund of Boston. He has recently favored
McGrath RentCorp, a San Lorenzo, Calif., renter of modular
offices, and Duty Free International, a Ridgefield, Conn.,
operator of duty-free stores along the Canadian border.</p>
<p>Finding rewarding stocks requires careful selection, he
says. Small-stock indicators, such as the Nasdaq Composite
Index, will continue to disappoint investors because they are
heavily weighted with financial issues and large stocks of
such industry laggards as cellular and cable television
companies, Mr. Radlo notes.</p>
<p>The Feshbach short sellers have had "minimal exposure" in
such fast-growing OTC areas as biotechnology, healthcare and
software stocks, Mr. Radlo adds.</p>
<p>Some favorites among the shorts -- such as Ashton-Tate --
are deemed buying opportunities for others, such as Cowen's
Mr. Church. He's recently been "nibbling away" at shares of
the Torrance, Calif., software maker with an eye on some new
products due out in 1991. Among other OTC stocks, Mr.Church
likes KLA Instruments, a San Jose, Calif., medical instrument
maker, and A&W Brands, the White Plains, N.Y., maker of root
beer and other beverages.</p>
<p>Knowing when to buy small stocks is tricky, however. If an
investor is convinced that the economy is in a deep recession
and won't recover for several years, then Ms. Lisanti says
it's too early to buy small stocks.</p>
<p>But, like Mr. Church, she says now may be the time to shop
among small stocks if it appears the economy will begin to
recover in 12 to 18 months. Even though both money managers
expect the stock market to fall in the first half of 1991,
they point out that many small stocks already are cheap.</p>
<p>Small stocks that are thinly traded can be particularly
tough to buy when there's keen competition, adds Mr. Church.
"You can't buy them when you see the whites of {investor's}
eyes," he says. "Now is a great time to be involved."</p>

<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>OTC stocks overcame an early sell-off and turned higher in
the afternoon. Trading was moderately active.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite Index was down about one point in the
morning but ended 1.30 points higher, or up 0.35%, at 373.60.
OTC advancers led decliners 1,007 to 917. For the week, the
composite index rose 1.3%.</p>
<p>Many investors chose technology stocks Friday. Apple
Computer rose 1 to 45, Intel gained 1 to 40 and Autodesk
jumped 1 3/4 to 52 3/4.</p>
<p>Apple Computer was the most active OTC stock, trading more
than 3 million shares. Oracle Systems added 1/2 to 8 1/8 on
almost 2.5 million shares.</p>
<p>National Health Laboratories was active and lower again. A
federal grand jury inquiry into the company's pricing
policies continues to put pressure on the stock, which
dropped 2 3/4 to 9 5/8 on 1.5 million shares.</p>
<p>Healthdyne gained 1 1/8 to 10 1/2. The company said it
expects the Food and Drug Administration to authorize
additional uses for its uterine contraction activity monitor.</p>
