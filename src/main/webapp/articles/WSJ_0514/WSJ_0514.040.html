	<p class="article-leader">LONG BEACH, Calif. -- McDonnell Douglas Corp. executives
are stepping up their rhetoric in a bid to turn around the
company's transport aircraft facility here.
   In a letter sent to employees last week, Chairman John
McDonnell said that unless performance radically improves,
"lenders could lose confidence in the company's ability to
cover interest payments and repay the principal." In the
first quarter, the Long Beach subsidiary posted an operating
loss of $84 million, and the corporation as a whole barely
broke even.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. McDonnell said in his memo that in 1990 the company
will invest as much as $2 billion in the MD-11 commercial jet
program as it readies the three-engine craft for
certification by the Federal Aviation Administration. Coupled
with additional outlays for the troubled C-17 military cargo
plane, also built here, and several jet-fighter programs, he
indicated that the company's net cash outflow this year could
total $1.2 billion. That amount, the chairman said, must be
borrowed on top of the $2.5 billion in debt that McDonnell
Douglas had at the end of March.</p>
<p>Mr. McDonnell maintained that "this higher debt level is
not necessarily a problem in itself." But he noted that "the
combination of high debt, negative cash flow and poor
performance affecting profitability does require action" that
will assuage lenders' concerns. The details of the chairman's
letter were first reported in the Orange County Register.</p>
<p>The newspaper also disclosed the existence of another
document, which it described as a paraphrasing of remarks
recently made by John Capellupo, deputy president of the Long
Beach subsidiary. "The company is in big trouble," Mr.
Capellupo is quoted as saying. "If the C-17 has any more
problems; and if the MD-11 isn't certified and delivers 5-6
aircraft by the end of the year; and if the MD-80 doesn't
start producing aircraft like they are supposed to," then the
Long Beach division "could be history."</p>
<p>In the wake of Lockheed Corp.'s announcement earlier this
month that it would completely pull its aircraft operations
out of Burbank, Calif., plus the memory that McDonnell
Douglas had contemplated leaving the commercial airplane
business in the early 1980s, the Capellupo comments set off
alarm bells. The Register interpreted them to mean that the
company was considering mothballing the factory here, and ran
a page-one headline that declared: "Long Beach aircraft maker
might close."</p>
<p>However, McDonnell Douglas officials were quick to insist
that shuttering the plant is not even an option at this
point. "We have absolutely no plans to sell the property, no
plans to shut the doors," a spokesman at corporate
headquarters in St. Louis said.</p>
<p>Doug Griffith, president of United Auto Workers local 148,
which represents nearly 20,000 McDonnell Douglas workers in
Long Beach, also asserted that there was no possibility of
closure. "That would be tantamount to the demise of the whole
corporation," he said, pointing out that McDonnell Douglas
has long set its sights on making the commercial airplane
lines here its financial backbone, thereby offsetting
slumping sales to the Pentagon.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it's clear that the pressure is mounting in
Long Beach, where 4,000 workers -- almost all white-collar --
will be laid off by the end of summer. Upper-level managers
in particular "are feeling the screws," one employee said.</p>
<p>Mr. Capellupo, who along with other senior executives
declined to be interviewed, is quoted as saying: "The banks
have heard all our problems and solutions, but are about fed
up with us."</p>
<p>And in his letter, Mr. McDonnell said the company has only
two undesirable alternatives besides getting planes out more
efficiently. The first would be to sell more stock to
increase equity. But that, he said, would be "very expensive
to our present shareholders because we would be issuing
shares of stock in the $40s and $50s when our net asset value
is in the $80s. That would dilute the stock that we all own."</p>
<p>The second option would be to cut back commercial
transport production. That, however, "would put us even
farther behind in deliveries to our airline customers and
would quickly cause them to lose confidence in us as a
reliable supplier. That, in turn, would result in a
significant deterioration of our position in or outright
elimination from that market and could relegate us to only a
declining defense business.</p>
<p>"It would," he continued, "require us to lay off up to
half" of the 50,000 workers employed at Long Beach.</p>
