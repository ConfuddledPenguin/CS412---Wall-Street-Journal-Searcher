	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Suntory Ltd.'s new president, Shinichiro Torii,
is pushing to find new areas for diversification -- in Japan
and abroad.
   "We want to set an image of providing good drinks, food
and services in the U.S., and all around the world," says the
52-year-old Mr. Torii, who last month inherited the mantle of
his family's 90-year-old liquor empire.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Torii succeeds his 70-year-old uncle, Keizo Saji, who
ran the company for 30 years and who will remain as chairman.
During that time, Osaka-based Suntory has developed into
Japan's largest spirits producer and a major liquor importer.
It markets Jack Daniel's and Budweiser in Japan, among other
brands, and runs vineyards in France and California.</p>
<p>But Suntory's key businesses are facing tough times.
Spirits sales, the company's main trade, are hardly growing.
Beer sales are stuck at 10% market share, last among Japan's
four brewers. Recent growth has come mainly from Suntory's
smaller divisions, such as wine, soft drinks and canned soup.</p>
<p>The new president has already set an ambitious goal of
increasing sales of overseas business by nearly 20-fold to
one trillion yen ($6.18 billion). That is likely to include
acquisitions: Mr. Torii recently has been trumpeting his
intention to acquire a U.S. food company, although he
declines to identify any potential targets. Suntory already
markets a range of food products in Japan, including Haagen
Dazs ice cream and vegetable juice produced by Campbell Soup
Co.</p>
<p>In the past five years, Suntory has invested more than 30
billion yen to acquire seven East Coast distributers of
bottled water in the U.S., forming the Suntory Water Group.
This month, the company is starting to market its own beer in
the U.S.; it aims to sell 50,000 cases by the end of the
year.</p>
<p>Prime targets for expansion, Mr. Torii believes, are the
leisure and entertainment industries. "The Japanese have to
enjoy their lives, and not be workaholics," he says. "Sports
and entertainment -- those are the areas we want to diversify
into." The company recently paid an estimated $3 million to
acquire a majority stake in the Birmingham Barons, a minor
league baseball team in Alabama. Last month, it announced a
tie-up with Jack Nicklaus and Mitsubishi Corp. to build a
Japanese golf course, and in a few years intends to build
golf resorts in the U.S.</p>
<p>Last year, Suntory started investing an estimated $1
million a year to co-produce Broadway musicals, such as "City
of Angels" and "The Grapes of Wrath," through a partnership
with the Schubert Organization. If the musicals prove
successful in the U.S., Suntory hopes to bring them back to
Japan.</p>
<p>"The company had a weak spot for culture from before,"
says Shuichi Shibanuma, an analyst for Morgan Stanley & Co.
in Tokyo. "That's something it can do because it's a
privately owned company," he says. Suntory last year spent
more than 10 billion yen on its burgeoning entertainment
division.</p>
<p>Not all of the company's investments in entertainment have
been successful. Five years ago, the company spent $15
million on a project with trading house C. Itoh & Co. and
Tokyo Broadcasting System, television network, to bring to
Japan such movies as "Fatal Beauty," "Bright Lights, Big
City" and "Betrayed." The films all flopped. Suntory is now
sticking to producing cartoons in Japan, but is studying
future opportunities in Hollywood, a company spokesman says.
Mr. Torii says he has no immediate plans to invest in movie
studios.</p>
<p>Last year, Suntory posted sales of 777 billion yen, down
from an estimated 781.5 billion yen in 1988. (Suntory changed
its fiscal year after 1988, making a year-to-year comparison
difficult.) The drop in revenue came in part from a reduction
of Japan's liquor tax, which is included in sales figures.
But even in volume terms, Suntory's $439 billion of spirits
sales grew only 1% to 216 million liters.</p>
<p>Operating profit in 1989 totaled 26.7 billion yen. Figures
for the comparable period in 1988 aren't available.</p>
