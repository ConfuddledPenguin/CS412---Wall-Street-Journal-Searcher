	<p class="article-leader">CARACAS, Venezuela -- Like presidential contenders
anywhere, Cesar Gaviria is selling himself hard.
   In one day of campaigning here, he has breakfasts with
Venezuela's foreign minister, gives a few interviews, meets a
left-wing politician, lays a wreath on the tomb of freedom
fighter Simon Bolivar, has lunch with his staff, holds talks
with voters, meets with President Carlos Andres Perez and
heads home.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>And there's the hitch. Mr. Gaviria's home is neighboring
Colombia. But the political and drug-related violence there
is so bad that none of the candidates can do more than appear
on television or hold small private meetings. So Mr. Gaviria,
the candidate of the ruling Liberal Party and the
overwhelming favorite of the May 27 presidential vote, has
come to Venezuela on a three-day trip, hoping to generate
headlines and do some of the things he can't do at home.</p>
<p>"It's easier to make a swing through Caracas than through
Medellin," home of one of Colombia's feared drug cartels,
says Rodrigo Pardo, an aide to Mr. Gaviria.</p>
<p>Colombia is going through one of the strangest election
campaigns ever, a clandestine, cloak-and-dagger affair where
issues have taken second place to making sure the candidates
stay alive. With Colombia's drug lords calling off a
unilateral truce, violence is again sweeping the country,
despite recent successes in the government's war on drugs.</p>
<p>That Mr. Gaviria is forced to campaign in the wrong
country is just another sign of the surrealism and horror of
Colombia. On Saturday, two powerful car bombs exploded in
crowded shopping centers in Bogota as Colombians shopped for
Mother's Day gifts, killing at least 15 people, including
four children, and wounding 144. A few hours later, another
car bomb went off in Cali, the other drug-cartel capital,
killing eight and wounding 37.</p>
<p>The bombs, believed to be the work of drug traffickers,
marked the second-deadliest day of violence in Colombia's
10-month-old war on the drug cartels -- a war decreed by
President Virgilio Barco after presidential contender Luis
Carlos Galan was murdered in August. Since his death, two
other candidates -- left-winger Bernardo Jaramillo and Carlos
Pizarro, the head of the M-19 terrorist
group-turned-political party -- have been killed. "I don't
think any other country has had a campaign where three
candidates have died," says Mr. Gaviria. Adds law student
Luis Gomez: "If things continue this way, by the time
elections come around, we won't have any candidates left."</p>
<p>Colombia, home of Latin America's stablest democratic
systems, has also become one of the world's most violent
countries. In some ways, this isn't new: Two decades of
political warfare pitting the Liberals against the
Conservatives, lasting into the 1960s, claimed an estimated
250,000 lives. But today's violence is a bewildering maze of
declared and undeclared wars that have so weakened Colombia's
democracy that even candidates say the fact elections are
taking place is a triumph.</p>
<p>A particular breed of Colombian academics, known as
violentologists, is compiling grisly statistics and trying to
make sense of the bloodshed. Eduardo Pizarro, a
violentologist at Bogota's National University and the
brother of the slain M-19 candidate, counted 18,000
assassinations in 1989, of which 3% were solved, in a country
of 32 million people. Rodrigo Losada, another violentologist,
counted 23,312 homocides last year. "I think only countries
in civil war have a higher rate," he says.</p>
<p>There are so many varieties of violence analysts have
trouble figuring out what it's all about. Mr. Pizarro
identifies seven violent "actors" in Colombia today: drug
traffickers, left-wing guerrillas, paramilitary squads,
peasant self-defense groups, the extreme right, organized
delinquents and urban criminals. "It's not a national
violence, but a multiregional one," he says. "In each region
there's a different threat, and the alliances shift. In some
places, it's the military and narcos against guerrillas. In
others, the guerrillas side with the narcos against the
military. The government has identified the narcos as the
biggest threat, and is promoting peace with guerrillas to
neutralize a second threat, while the extreme right develops
into a new threat."</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, violence and security have dominated the
campaign, to the exclusion of all issues, including the
economy, which despite the violence is one of the healthiest
in South America. Fittingly, in a country where death is
always around the corner, it is a campaign dominated by
ghosts. Mr. Gaviria's posters show him waving in front of a
larger picture of Mr. Galan, whose mantle he took up after
Mr. Galan's assassination. And M-19's posters still show
Pizarro, who was killed on a plane on April 26, rather than
his substitute, Antonio Navarro.</p>
<p>The central issue is how to deal with narco-terrorism, and
Mr. Gaviria talks tougher than the three other main
candidates, conservatives Alvaro Gomez and Rodrigo Lloreda,
who want to balance justice with Colombians' peace
aspirations, and Mr. Navarro, who encourages some form of
negotiation with drug lords.</p>
<p>On his trip to Venezuela, Mr. Gaviria is permanently
followed by tens of machine-gun-toting security guards clad
in bulletproof vests and by two ambulances, including a
mobile-operating unit. Taking time out for an interview, he
outlines a position very close to that of the current
government: Keep fighting the war on drugs, and encourage
consumer countries -- principally the U.S. -- to wage war
there too and open their markets to Colombian products other
than cocaine.</p>
<p>But in fighting the war on drugs, Mr. Gaviria, a
43-year-old economist who has served as both finance minister
and interior minister, says Colombia must develop other tools
besides extradition to the U.S., the main arm used by the
Barco government. He proposes a far-reaching judicial reform,
including the creation of a special court to judge drug
traffickers in Colombia, replacing judges who risk death if
they don't bow to intimidation.</p>
<p>Colombians will also vote in a referendum on whether to
start the process of revising the constitution, presumably in
ways that could help the state fight the drug lords. Some
people, however, have lost hope that any change will be
enough. Mr. Pizarro, the violentologist, has attended 50
funerals, including his brother's, in three years. He has had
enough. "There are two options, he says -- "Leave the country
or live without paranoia." Since death threats prevent him
from following the second course, he has chosen the first.</p>
