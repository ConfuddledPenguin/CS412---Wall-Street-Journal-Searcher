	<p class="article-leader">FRANKFURT, West Germany (APDJ) -- Threats to West German
price stability due to reunification with East Germany are
being exaggerated, a growing number of West German economists
assert.
   A week after the two German governments agreed to terms of
monetary union, set to take effect July 2, and amid signals
that the two states could merge politically perhaps by the
end of the year, analysts are forecasting that inflation in
West Germany won't spurt to intolerable levels. Most expect
the cost of living to rise about 3%, little changed from last
year, and considerably below some pessimistic estimates of 4%
or more.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That optimism has carried over into currency markets,
where the West German mark has risen sharply against most
currencies in recent days and has approached its highest
levels against the dollar in two years. The dollar ended
trading in New York Friday at 1.6478, down sharply from
1.6840 marks the day before details of the currency union
were set.</p>
<p>Economists cite the following for their optimism on
inflation:</p>
<p>-- East Germans, who after July 2 will be able to convert
their approximately 170 billion East German marks in cash and
savings into about 120 billion West German marks ($72.44
billion), will be wary of depleting their savings in a buying
binge of consumer goods because of uncertainty about
employment.</p>
<p>-- Should consumer demand, nevertheless, rise, much of it
could be met through increased imports, which analysts
describe as a desired side effect of the merger by countering
West Germany's massive trade surpluses.</p>
<p>-- The mark remains strong, and shows little sign of
severe weakening against the dollar, which puts downward
pressure on import prices, especially prices of oil. That in
turn keeps producer prices low.</p>
<p>"Inflation just isn't a necessary consequence of the
currency union," said Gabriel Andrade, an economist at Baring
Securities in Frankfurt. "The Bundesbank can absorb excess
money supply. The continuation of the Deutsche mark's
strength makes it also likely that inflationary tendencies
can be kept under control."</p>
<p>The Bundesbank, which raised interest rates four times in
1989 to slow inflation that was surging well above 3% at
times last year, warned in the weeks before the currency
union agreement that it would slam its foot on the monetary
brake if costs for the unification of the two German states
appeared to threaten domestic price stability.</p>
<p>This, in turn, contributed to a slump in the West German
bond market and left currency markets wary.</p>
<p>And even though the Bundesbank's suggestion for 2,000
marks being converted at the favorable 1-to-1 rate was
eschewed for the final 4,000 marks swapped at par for Germans
between the ages of 15 and 60, the central bank has quietly
indicated the final agreement isn't far from what it had in
mind. East Germans 60 and older may swap 6,000 marks into
West German marks and those 14 and younger may convert 2,000
marks.</p>
<p>"The exchange rate they settled on is a lot less than some
people feared," said Ulrich Schroeder, an economist at
Deutsche Bank. He expects inflation to end the year not much
above 3%.</p>
<p>"The economists abroad who are talking about higher
inflation are overlooking the fact that East Germans have to
save for their old age. And a lot of that will stay in
savings," Schroeder continued, noting that East Germans save
an average of 7% of their income compared with a 12% savings
rate in West Germany.</p>
<p>"People in East Germany are also acutely afraid of
becoming unemployed," he said, referring to some estimates of
unemployment, previously unheard of, jumping to 15% or more
within two years. "They aren't going to spend all their
savings in times of uncertainty like this."</p>
<p>But other economists worry about what they call a "glacier
of liquidity" in East Germany, not knowing if, or how much of
that "will melt," as Jonathan Hoffman of Credit Suisse First
Boston in London describes it. Hoffman and others say they're
nervous about a larger number of marks chasing the same
amount of goods.</p>
<p>Skeptics add that there is enormous pent-up demand for
consumer goods among East Germans. According to research
compiled by Andrade and Norbert Braems, chief economist at
Baring Securities in Frankfurt, East Germans have had to pay
more that double in real terms what West Germans pay for
cars, more than triple for color television sets, almost
quadruple for refrigerators and six times as much for
cassette recorders.</p>
<p>Also cited by those who see a jump in inflation coming is
the enormous pressure on capacity in such sectors as the
construction industry, as billions of marks are poured into
rebuilding the decayed East German infrastructure.</p>
<p>West German analysts generally tend to see a rosier
scenario. Andrade reckons that demand for between 600 billion
marks to 800 billion marks in investment needed in East
Germany over the next 10 years can come from a mixture of
corporate, private and state funds.</p>
<p>From the state, Andrade said some 40 billion marks in
subsidies Bonn currently provides to West Berlin and other
previously isolated border regions can be diverted into East
Germany. Another 10 billion marks can be saved by a 20% cut
in arms spending in West Germany. And, while it's politically
unlikely before general elections in December, a 1% increase
in value-added tax could generate another 10 billion marks.</p>
<p>Economists in West Germany don't expect East Germans to
pass up investment opportunites they previously didn't have.
"Other than simple savings accounts, there was nothing," said
Schroeder of Deutsche Bank. "There were no stocks, no bonds,
nothing. It's completely wrong to say that the 120 billion
D-marks will be liquid. A large part of that is what people
are saving for old age."</p>
<p>Heiner Flassbeck, an economist at the independent DIW
Institute for economic research in West Berlin, doesn't see
an acceleration in inflation because of the currency union.
Inflation in 1989, he predicts, will probably settle
somewhere just above 3.0% and well below 3.5%.</p>
<p>"The arguments that stronger demand will push prices up
are overlooking the fact that this isn't a closed market," he
said. "There's an entire world market that can help meet any
increase in demand. And that would lead to lower German trade
surpluses, which isn't an undesired effect. There's not going
to be a shortage of supply."</p>
