	<p class="article-leader">Cie. Generale d'Electricite (CGE) said its consolidated
revenue edged up 1% in the first quarter to 32.70 billion
francs ($5.92 billion) from 32.42 billion francs ($5.87
billion) a year earlier.
   The French electronics, telecommunications and engineering
group said that the relatively flat sales performance was
strongly influenced by changes in group structure, the most
notable of which was its decision in 1989 to create GEC
Alsthom N.V., a joint unit with General Electric Co. of
Britain in the field of power distribution and engineering.
CGE said that first-quarter revenue would have been up 7%
from a year earlier after adjustment for this and other
changes in group structure.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>New orders taken during the first quarter totaled 38.5
billion francs, CGE said, up 16% from a year earlier.</p>
<p>CGE didn't provide comparable first-quarter earnings
figures. For all of 1989, its consolidated net profit after
payments to minority interests was 4.94 billion francs on
revenue of 143.9 billion francs.</p>
