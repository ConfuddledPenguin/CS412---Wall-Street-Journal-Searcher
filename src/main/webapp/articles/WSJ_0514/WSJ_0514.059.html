	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Amax Inc. made a $1.25 billion bid for Peabody
Holding Co., the largest U.S. coal producer, but the offer
was immediately topped by Hanson PLC, which said it was
"determined" to complete its previously announced plans to
buy Peabody.
   Wall Street observers said that Hanson's quick response
suggested that Amax, a natural-resources company based here,
had misplayed the bid and succeeded only in drawing attention
to its own vulnerability as a possible takeover candidate.
The observers said they doubted that Amax would make a new
bid.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Hanson acquired 45% of Peabody last month for $504 million
from three other companies. In March, Hanson had announced a
plan to buy the remaining 55% of Peabody for $715 million
from Newmont Mining Corp. Hanson acquired a 49% stake in
Newmont by buying Consolidated Gold Fields Ltd. last August.</p>
<p>Hanson's agreement with Newmont allows other bidders to
top its offer for all of Peabody before the purchase is
completed in June, to make sure Newmont's public holders
receive a fair price. The Amax bid, which occurred around
noon Friday, valued Newmont's Peabody stake at $718.5 million
-- only a slight increase on Hanson's offer. Within two
hours, Hanson boosted its bid to $725.6 million.</p>
<p>An Amax spokesman wouldn't comment on whether Amax plans a
new bid. Wall Street observers said they doubted Amax would
engage in a bidding war with the much larger Hanson, a
British conglomerate with $9 billion in cash and interests in
tobacco, specialty chemicals, and building products,
particularly in view of Hanson's stated determination.
"Hanson wants this company," said one individual close to
Hanson.</p>
<p>But the sequence of events puzzled some observers. Said
one: "The question is why would Amax openly compete with
Hanson, and risk putting themselves in play {for a takeover},
with a bid that was such a small increase over Hanson's
offer?"</p>
<p>An Amax spokesman suggested Amax may have misunderstood
Newmont's March 29 announcement of the Peabody sale to
Hanson, which stated that Hanson and Newmont "would accept"
an offer above $1.24 billion for all of Peabody. "Reading
that, it looks like they're inviting an offer and naming a
price," the spokesman said. "Well, we took them at their word
and now we see their response."</p>
<p>Vahid Fahti, a base-metals analyst at Prescott Ball &
Turben Inc. in Cleveland, said that some people might
interpret the Amax bid "as a defensive move." Amax has been
the subject of off-and-on takeover speculation in the past
six months, with unusually high trading volume in its stock.</p>
<p>News of the Peabody bid hurt Amax's stock price, which
declined 12.5 cents a share to $25.25 Friday in composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange despite a strong
advance in the overall market. Some analysts value the
company's parts as high as $50 a share.</p>
<p>In 1989, Amax reported profit of $360.4 million, or $4.19
a share, on revenue of $3.89 billion. Aluminum accounted for
65% of its sales, coal 14%, gold 10%, with the remainder in
molybdenum and natural gas. It has slightly less than $1
billion in debt. Its Amax Coal unit is the third-largest U.S.
producer, with 4% of the market compared with 9% for Peabody.</p>
<p>Mr. Fahti said he expects Amax's earnings to decline about
35% this year to $2.75 a share, mainly due to lower aluminum
prices and softer demand in the housing and construction
markets, the end-users of much of Amax's output. He said a
coal acquisition that more than doubled Amax's debt could
make the company "somewhat less attractive to a suitor."</p>
<p>The Amax bid amounts to about 12 times Peabody's 1989
profit of $101.9 million on revenue of $1.74 billion.
Although Hanson doesn't have any other coal business, it has
operations in several mining industries, including cement,
gold, sand and gravel, and brick.</p>
<p>Last August, Amax made a $2.3 billion bid for Falconbridge
Ltd., a Canadian nickel, copper and zinc producer, but was
later outbid by Noranda Inc. and Trelleborg AB, two other
metals concerns. The Amax spokesman said Amax had been
invited to bid by Falconbridge, which was concerned about a
"creeping takeover" by Noranda, which had acquired 28% of
Falconbridge.</p>
<p>One company with a rumored interest in Amax is Peter
Kiewit Sons Inc., a closely held concern in Omaha, Neb., with
interests in construction and natural resources. A spokesman
for Kiewit couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
