	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Campeau Corp. said a major secured creditor,
Edward J. DeBartolo Corp., agreed that, until June 30, it
won't call its $480 million loan to the financially strained
real estate and retailing concern without first giving nine
days' notice.
   The previous agreement to give Campeau a nine-day warning
before acting on DeBartolo's security against the loan
expired May 10. A similar agreement with the Reichmann
family's Olympia & York Developments Ltd. doesn't have an
expiry date.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In January, Campeau defaulted on the DeBartolo loan and
$225 million remaining in a loan from Olympia & York when its
U.S. retailing units, Federated Department Stores Inc. and
Allied Stores Corp., sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
In March, Campeau refused to pay interest due on the loans.</p>
<p>DeBartolo's loan is secured mainly against 83.8% of the
stock in Ralphs Grocery Co., Campeau's southern California
supermarket chain, which isn't in Chapter 11 proceedings.
DeBartolo, a closely held real estate developer based in
Youngstown, Ohio, lent Campeau $480 million as part of the
equity contribution toward Campeau's $6.6 billion takeover of
Federated in May 1988. The Olympia & York loan, made last
September to help Federated and Allied meet their fall
working capital needs, is secured mostly by some of Campeau's
Canadian real estate assets. Campeau plans to sell much of
its real estate under a financial restructuring of its
Canadian operations.</p>
