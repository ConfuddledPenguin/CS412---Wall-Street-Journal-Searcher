	<p class="article-leader">Two shareholders, David C. Walentas and Stanford M.
Dinstein, said they may make an offer to acquire Builders
Transport Inc. whether or not their plans for a possible
proxy fight to oust the board is successful.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Messrs. Walentas and Dinstein, who hold together a 7.8%
stake, said that if they don't make an acquisition proposal
before Builders Transport's annual meeting, they will seek
the sale of the company to the highest bidder if their
nominees are elected.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The two said they plan to ask Builders Transport's board
for confidential data and intend to review the information
before deciding whether and at what price to make an offer.
According to the filing, Messrs. Walentas and Dinstein formed
a committee on May 2 in connection with their possible proxy
contest. Each of the members has agreed to be a nominee on
the dissidents' slate.</p>
<p>In Camden, S.C., Robert Lee Garner, Builders' general
counsel and corporate secretary, said the company hasn't
received a copy of the filing, and had no comment.</p>
