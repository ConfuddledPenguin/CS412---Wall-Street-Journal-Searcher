	<p class="article-leader">These days, a sentence to death is more like a sentence to
a decade on death row. The average capital case takes 106
months from crime to execution, a committee headed by former
Justice William Lewis F. Powell Jr. reported in a study
issued last September.
   The investigation of the crime, the trial and sentencing,
the direct appeal to the highest court in the state followed
by a bid for U.S. Supreme Court review -- all this accounts
for only 48 of the 106 months. Most of the remaining time
goes to fashioning, presenting and litigating petitions for
habeas corpus.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Inmates in state prisons can file their petitions in both
state and federal court. But state courts tend to give the
petitions short shrift, especially second and third petitions
after the first has been denied. The major delaying factor in
death cases, accounting for more than 80% of the average time
capital inmates spend on habeas corpus, is the federal writ.
There are no time deadlines for habeas corpus. The typical
"deadline" in capital cases is a looming execution date,
which usually sets off a new round of writs.</p>
<p>This ability to spend years in the federal court system
long after a conviction has become final is a bonanza of the
Earl Warren era. In 1963, the Supreme Court handed down two
important rulings that opened the floodgates for writ
petitions from state prisoners. The first relaxed a
once-ironclad rule that required them to exhaust state-court
remedies first. The second allowed prisoners to raise
constitutional issues piecemeal over a series of writs,
trying out some issues in the first writ, others later. The
only bar is "abuse of the writ," deliberately holding back a
claim in order to manipulate the legal system.</p>
<p>Few death row prisoners are executed these days without
having made at least two trips to the Supreme Court on
federal habeas corpus writs. Few prisoners are executed,
period. Since 1976, when the Supreme Court reapproved the
death penalty in a Georgia case, there have been only 124
executions. Most of the rest of the total U.S. death row
population of more than 2,327 is in court. In Georgia,
prosecutors and defense lawyers are still litigating
execution cases dating from 1974, when its new death law went
into effect.</p>
<p>This has led to calls for reform in the federal habeas
system. Next week the Senate is scheduled to hear two
separate and competing reform packages by Senate Judiciary
Chairman Joseph Biden and ranking Republican Strom Thurmond.
Both packages would set time deadlines -- strict in the
Thurmond bill, less so in the Biden bill -- for filing writ
petitions. In the House, the Judiciary Committee's courts
subcommittee plans to start hearings Wednesday on habeas
corpus.</p>
<p>But congressional reforms may not be necessary. In fact,
if Congress passes the Biden bill, the effect may well be to
sabotage the gradual course of federal habeas corpus reform
that the Supreme Court has undertaken on its own starting
when Warren Burger replaced Earl Warren, and accelerating
since William Rehnquist succeeded Mr. Burger.</p>
<p>The court has removed entire congeries of legal issues,
such as those pertaining to the legality of state search
warrants from federal habeas corpus purview. In a doctrine
called "procedural default," the justices have refused to let
federal courts review questions that the defendant's lawyers
did not raise properly at earlier stages in the proceedings.</p>
<p>In February 1989, the Supreme Court handed down a sleeper
decision, Teague v. Lane, holding that state prisoners could
not use federal habeas corpus as a vehicle for making new
constitutional law unless the proposed new rule (with some
exceptions), pertained to "bedrock" constitutional rights,
presumably on the order of the right to counsel. The ruling
effectively told state inmates to raise such claims in state
court on direct appeal or forget about them.</p>
<p>On March 5 of this year, the justices issued two more
rulings extending Teague v. Lane to capital cases. Two other
death cases with Teague issues were argued in February and
April and are awaiting decision.</p>
<p>The seemingly endless case of Robert Alton Harris, set for
argument Monday before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
is a case study in the way the current open-ended
post-conviction review system works in capital cases. Mr.
Harris was tried and sentenced to death in 1979 for the
murder of two teen-age boys at Miramar Lake near San Diego in
July 1978. In 1981, the California Supreme Court affirmed his
conviction and sentence -- one of only four such affirmations
during the tenure of liberal Chief Justice Rose Bird.</p>
<p>The gruesome details of the murders and of Mr. Harris's
criminal career in general -- the eight shots he plugged into
the boys before finishing off the hamburgers they had been
eating, the fact that he was already on parole for beating a
neighbor to death and trying to set him afire, the forcible
sodomy he committed on a fellow inmate while awaiting trial
-- can be read in the California high court's 1981 opinion.
Suffice it to say that Mr. Harris's wife testified for the
prosecution at his sentencing hearing.</p>
<p>During the 11 years since his conviction, Mr. Harris and
his lawyers have filed seven petitions for habeas corpus,
four in state court, three in federal court. Over the years
he has alleged: that his sentence was out of proportion to
his crimes; that the trial judge refused to give a
"diminished capacity" instruction to the jury based on Mr.
Harris's smoking two joints of marijuana before the murders;
that, although Mr. Harris is white, he was the victim of a
racially discriminatory capital sentencing system in
California. He won some court victories that higher courts
later reversed. By the end of last year, it seemed he had
exhausted all possible avenues of legal relief. An April 3
execution date was set. He was to be the first criminal to go
to the gas chamber in California since 1967.</p>
<p>Just a week before Mr. Harris's scheduled execution date,
his attorneys filed the seventh and latest petition, winning
a stay of execution. The grounds for the newest writ? Two
court-appointed psychiatrists who examined Mr. Harris before
the sentencing hearing failed to discern any signs of organic
brain damage. His lawyers now say that Mr. Harris was a
victim of fetal alcohol syndrome, hyperactivity and other
brain disorders.</p>
<p>In 1985, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a defendant
facing a death sentence has a right of access to the services
of a "competent" court-appointed psychiatrist. So why didn't
Mr. Harris raise this ground in 1985 or earlier rather than
on the eve of his execution in 1990? "We've been trying to
get the court to pay for an EEG since 1982, but the court
refused," is the response of Mr. Harris's lead lawyer,
Charles Sevilla. "Finally last year, we paid for one
ourselves."</p>
<p>The issue of Mr. Harris's mental state now and in 1978 is
murky. He raised an alibi defense at trial and a marijuana
intoxication defense sometime later in the writ process. An
electroencephalogram administered to him before the 1979
sentencing hearing yielded normal results, although a 1971
EEG had shown abnormalities a probation officer attributed to
chronic glue-sniffing. At any rate, the murders, which
occurred so Mr. Harris and his brother could obtain a getaway
car for a bank robbery they had planned and rehearsed for
weeks, did not exactly bespeak a disordered brain.</p>
<p>The Harris case has all the earmarks of a candidate for
quick termination under Teague v. Lane: an attempt to
establish a new rule of law via federal habeas corpus long
after the time for direct appeal has expired. That is where
the Biden bill would come into play. While setting a one-year
time limit at the end of direct appeal (subject to numerous
exceptions) for getting all federal habeas claims on file, it
also contains language that effectively overrides both Teague
v. Lane and the procedural default rule the Supreme Court set
earlier. The Biden bill is to the Supreme Court's recent
habeas corpus decisions what the pending Kennedy-Hawkins
civil rights bill is to its affirmative action rulings.</p>
<p>Fortunately for prosecutors, the Biden bill has little
chance of passing, mostly because of a controversial
amendment by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) that would
effectively bring racial quotas to state death penalty laws
by allowing statistical challenges to them. (The tougher
Thurmond bill is also said to have little future.) This may
be all for the best, for the Supreme Court seems to be moving
efficiently on its own toward putting an end to open-ended
death appeals.</p>
