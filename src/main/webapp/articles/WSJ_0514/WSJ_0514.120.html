	<p class="article-leader">The British are coming]
   Last week, directors of the London Metals Exchange
approved plans to open four metal-storage warehouses in the
U.S., a move that several board members said is "just the
beginning" of an effort to build more U.S. business for the
British exchange.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The metal exchange has initially selected as warehouse
sites Baltimore, Bridgeport/New Haven, Conn., Chicago and
Toledo, Ohio. According to Martin Abbott, director of
marketing for the exchange, these locations are subject to
the availability of suitable warehouse space that meets metal
exchange standards.</p>
<p>"The next step is in the hands of warehouse companies
applying to us and being approved," Mr. Abbott added. He also
said that a key consideration was that a location be near, or
in, a region of the country that uses metals in
manufacturing.</p>
<p>The metal exchange currently has 80 warehouses in Europe,
Japan and Singapore where producers and consumers may make
and take delivery of the base metals in which they deal. The
exchange trades contracts in aluminum, copper, lead, nickel,
tin and zinc.</p>
<p>David King, chief executive of the metal exchange (LME),
said that the U.S. warehouses would be prepared to handle all
the metals except copper; initially, lead also will probably
not be stored. Mr. King added that he believed the warehouses
will primarily be used for aluminum.</p>
<p>The warehouses will not be available for use until three
months after they have been approved by the LME.</p>
<p>The metal exchange decided not to handle copper in the
U.S. because it does not want head-to-head competition with
New York's Commodity Exchange.</p>
<p>"We believe that if we were to open our U.S. warehouses to
copper it would become a battle for liquidity in the U.S.
market," said Mr. King. He added, "The LME is not looking for
gratuitous violence in the copper market." The Comex has
copper warehouses in 19 cities in the U.S.</p>
<p>Commodity exchanges that trade futures contracts on metals
provide warehouses so that producers and consumers can take
or dispose of the metal if they wish.</p>
<p>For example, a producer of aluminum who has sold contracts
to protect against falling prices may deliver aluminum to an
authorized warehouse to satisfy his short position instead of
buying back the contracts to offset his sale. Similarly, a
consumer of aluminum who has bought futures contracts to
guard against higher prices may take delivery of aluminum
from an authorized warehouse instead of selling his futures
contracts to end his obligation.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Comex said the exchange welcomes the
competition from the metal exchange and added, "It will keep
us on our toes." He said that the Comex recently has been
exploring ways to improve the volume in its lightly traded
aluminum contract. Though the aluminum contract has been
revised at least twice, it has never attracted a following
among producers, dealers and consumers. The metal exchange
traded three million aluminum contracts in 1989 compared with
only 741 at the Comex.</p>
<p>John Gross, president of J.E. Gross & Associates, a firm
that consults to the metals industry, says he believes the
LME's U.S. warehouses will make the exchange's already
liquid, active aluminum contract more useful to the trade.
"It remains to be seen whether the trade will use these
warehouses," he said, "but I believe they will."</p>
<p>A spokesman for Aluminum Co. of America in Pittsburgh says
the company uses metal exchange contracts to hedge some of
its output periodically. Depending upon the specific
locations of the U.S. warehouses, the company may make
delivery to them, the spokesman added.</p>
<p>The president of a Vermont-based metals-dealing firm,
David Threlkeld of Threlkeld & Co., says the U.S. warehouses
will bring the prices for metals traded in the U.S. and
London more into line. He added, "I believe that though the
LME won't warehouse copper right away, they ultimately will."
Mr. Threlkeld says such a move will drain business away from
the Comex. In 1989 the metal exchange traded 4.52 million
copper contracts while the Comex handled 2.1 million.</p>
<p>Robert Green, president of Connecticut Minerals & Metals
Inc., another metals consulting firm, says it is not clear
what the warehouses' net effect will be on the U.S. metals
industry. "It's possible the LME's warehouses could spark a
rebirth for the Comex's aluminum contract." He said that this
could come about by providing convenient arbitrage
opportunities for traders.</p>
<p>An arbitrager might accept delivery of metal from a
warehouse bought on one exchange and deliver it to a
warehouse of another exchange where he had sold an equivalent
amount. The purpose of this strategy would be to capture a
temporary price discrepancy between the two exchanges.</p>
<p>One officer at a metals firm in New York said that, in
general, metals merchants are against the idea of the
warehouses while producers and consumers of the metals are
for them. "The warehouses provide another source of supply
that provides competition to the metals merchants," he
explained.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:</p>
<p>Grains and Soybeans: Analysts said they would be focusing
this week on whether soybean futures prices will continue the
downward slide initiated Friday by trend-following commodity
funds, analysts said. Based on figures released last week
showing a relatively large number of speculators owning
soybean and soybean oil and meal futures versus those who
sold contracts earlier in expectation of lower prices, the
funds rushed to sell soybean futures Friday. "They figured
that kind of bullish sentiment couldn't be sustained," said
Richard Loewy, president of AgResource Co. in Chicago. On
Friday, soybeans for July delivery dropped 16.75 cents a
bushel to close at $6.4375 a bushel in hectic trading on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Analysts said that if July beans drop
below roughly $6.30 to $6.35 a bushel, the level at which
prices have rebounded following similar downdrafts in recent
weeks, fund managers may continue to bail out of soybeans and
drive the price as low as $6 to $6.20. Commercial grain
dealers and processing firms remain bearish on soybean
futures prices. "There are plenty of beans out there," one
analyst said. Wheat futures prices may continue to slide this
week as well, following last Thursday's release of a
government crop report forecasting a winter wheat harvest
this year of 2.09 billion bushels, up 44% from last winter's
droughtstricken crop. In the wake of the report, wheat
futures for July delivery dipped 5.25 cents a bushel to close
at $3.44. Corn futures prices held up relatively well Friday
despite a larger-than-expected crop forecast for this year,
which was released Thursday. Expected strong demand is likely
to keep corn supplies tight this year. July corn futures
declined just 1.75 cents a bushel to close at $2.90 a bushel.</p>
<p>Orange Juice: The shock waves of the freeze that hit
Florida orange groves in December apparently will continue
into summer. The Department of Agriculture, in its May
revision of Florida's current orange crop, on Thursday raised
its estimate of production and frozen concentrate yields from
April, but traders ignored the report and continued to buy
futures on Friday, pushing prices higher. The agency
projected orange output at 108.1 million boxes, five million
boxes more than its estimate of 103.1 million in April. A box
weighs 90 pounds. It raised its estimate of frozen
concentrate yields to 1.22 gallons a box from 1.21 gallons in
April. It increased its estimate of the Valencia orange crop
by five million boxes, to 40 million, which was higher than
industry expectations of two million to four million. At
first, the report was regarded as negative, but later traders
changed their minds, said Judith Ganes, analyst for Merrill
Lynch, New York. One reason is that processors already have
mostly shut down as they have processed almost all the crop.
It is believed that any further juice will be used in
chilled, rather than frozen form, she said. Other
price-supporting factors are that retail demand for frozen
concentrate remains strong and that Florida supplies have
begun to dwindle, Ms. Ganes said. Florida inventories of
concentrate, as of the week ended May 5, amounted to 91.8
million gallons, compared with 104.3 million on hand at this
time last year, she said. These factors, along with continued
inventory declines as the season progresses, indicate that
prices will continue to firm, Ms. Ganes said.</p>
<p>Sugar: Traders will be watching to see if futures prices
will extend Friday's rally, which was prompted by active
Mexican buying of sugar on the world market, other indicated
world market demand and lower-than-expected exports from
Brazil. Mexico bought 100,000 tons of refined sugar Thursday,
bringing total purchases by that country last week to about
500,000 tons, said Sandra Kaul, analyst for Shearson Lehman
Hutton, New York. In addition, she said, there was talk that
Romania was looking to buy 200,000 tons of sugar. Iran,
Syria, Kuwait and Jordan are also possible buyers, and have
been drawn into the market by the recent drop in prices, she
said. According to Ms. Kaul, there were reports of ethanol
rationing in Belo Horizonte, Brazil's third-largest city. The
ethanol is produced from Brazilian sugar cane. Brazil is
expected to soon announce its sugar export policy and how
much it will export during the 1990-91 season that will begin
June 1, she said. Industry estimates are that it will earmark
about 750,000 tons for export, down from one million tons
exported during the current season, she said. Ms. Kaul
observed that the estimated export figure is regarded as
conservative, in view of expectations of a bigger Brazilian
sugar crop this year than last and with the freedom to export
that has come about because of the abolition of the
government sugar and alcohol agency by the new Brazilian
administration. Separately, C. Czarnikow Ltd., a London-based
sugar firm, on Friday estimated that world production of
sugar during the current, 1989-90 season ending Aug. 31 will
fall short of consumption by 1.85 million tons -- sharply
higher than an estimate by another British firm, E.D.& F. Man
(Sugar) Ltd. on May 4, which said the shortfall would be only
258,000 tons. Man had drastically lowered its shortfall
projection from revision from 1.46 million tons in January.</p>
<p>Energy: A negative factor for prices this week was news
that Texaco Inc. restarted its pipeline in the Gulf of Mexico
after closing it down early last week when a leak was
discovered in the system. Only 900 barrels of crude had
seeped into the water from the pipeline system, which carries
95,000 barrels of oil daily to refineries along the Gulf
Coast. The faulty section of the line, which was owned by
Exxon Corp., has been disconnected. Crude oil prices edged
lower in light trading Friday, led downward by declining
gasoline prices. The June delivery was down seven cents a
barrel to $18.95. June gasoline was down 1.79 cents a gallon
to 61.89 cents. Spot purchases of gasoline along the Gulf had
helped to prop up oil prices earlier in the week, but the
pace of those purchases had abated somewhat by week's end.</p>
