	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- Georgia-Pacific Corp. said William R. Laidig,
63 years old, resigned as chairman of Great Northern Nekoosa
Corp., which Georgia-Pacific acquired earlier this year after
a protracted takeover battle.
   The forest-products concern said Mr. Laidig will receive
more than $2.4 million for his resignation, as a result of
the severance clause in his employment contract. That
agreement guaranteed Great Northern's senior executives that
they would get three times their salaries if Great Northern
was taken over. Mr. Laidig's cash compensation in 1989 was
$801,000. The agreement also assured Mr. Laidig that, upon
his resignation, he would receive three times the amount of
his highest annual noncash bonus, but a Georgia-Pacific
spokeswoman could not ascertain that amount on Friday.</p>

vice president, pulp and paper, will continue as Great
