	<p class="article-leader">DENVER -- Consolidated Oil & Gas Inc. said a U.S.
bankruptcy court approved its plan to emerge from Chapter 11
bankruptcy proceedings.
   The plan calls for all of the company's oil and gas
properties to be sold for $24.2 million to a new entity owned
by institutional investment partnerships under management of
First Reserve Corp. of Greenwich, Conn.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Proceeds from that sale will be used to repay a $27
million loan from Mellon Bank Corp., Pittsburgh, Consolidated
said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, assets valued by Consolidated at about $8
million -- including $1.5 million in cash and 880,306 shares
of common stock of Columbus Energy Corp., Denver -- will be
liquidated and distributed to satisfy subordinated debt
totaling about $28 million and to shareholders. The company
said shareholders will receive 10% of any cash recovered in
excess of $7 million.</p>
<p>First Reserve said it intends to retain George Simmons,
president and chief operating officer of Consolidated, to
head the new company, which will keep the old name and remain
based in Denver.</p>
<p>Consolidated filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court
protection in March of last year, giving it protection from
creditors while it worked out a plan to pay its debts.</p>
