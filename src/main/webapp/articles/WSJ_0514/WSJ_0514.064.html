	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON, Pa. -- Hollywood has discovered the Berry
family.
   It began with Walter Berry. He was drinking coffee at the
counter of Margie's Restaurant -- formerly a hot-dog joint
called the Dog House -- when a director walked up and asked
him to be in a movie being filmed nearby. "I thought someone
was playing a joke on me," says the 53-year-old machine
operator.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Then his kid sister, Ludwina Scott, a 52-year-old
homemaker who envied Shirley Temple's ringlets as a child,
auditioned and won a role. Not to be outdone, the patriarch
of the family, 77-year-old onetime coal miner Charles L.
Berry, joined the cast.</p>
<p>The Berrys, it seems, are natural zombies, a sort of Brady
Bunch of horror films. They will make their acting debut in
the remake of George Romero's 1969 classic horror film,
"Night of the Living Dead," slated for a Halloween release by
Columbia Pictures.</p>
<p>"I kind of wonder what I got myself into," says an abashed
Walter Berry. Ludwina says her brother doesn't realize how
perfect he is for the role. She recounts how Walter once
dressed as a musician for a Halloween party at the American
Legion hall. But, as he is tall and skinny, with clear blue
eyes and sunken cheeks, judges unwittingly voted him best
vampire. "And he didn't even have any makeup on," she says.</p>
<p>Hospital orderlies, waitresses and meatpackers from this
rural area of western Pennsylvania competed for about 150
extra slots, including roles as vigilantes and police
officers. But most dreamed of a shot at zombiedom. "Everyone
wants to be a zombie," says Staci Blagovich, casting director
for extras.</p>
<p>When a local newspaper ran a story announcing auditions,
hundreds of people from Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia
called asking for directions. Fearing an invasion of zombie
zealots, Ms. Blagovich quietly canceled and rescheduled the
audition, moving it from a small church to a fire station,
because the church didn't have a parking lot.</p>
<p>Other would-be stars wrote to explain why they should be
zombies. One played the demon in the upcoming "Exorcist 90"
who helps pull George C. Scott down to hell. Another said
she, her boyfriend, her neighbor and her neighbor's boyfriend
are "total fans" of monster movies and that this one is
particularly "awesome." She included a picture of herself
with her tongue sticking out and her arms extended as proof
of her potential.</p>
<p>Still another wrote that her husband would be good for the
part because he acts silly with the couple's Chihuahuas. "He
walks towards them and puts his hands spooky-like above his
head and my little dogs go crazy," she wrote.</p>
<p>David Kuehls understands the zombie allure. A writer for
Britain's Fear magazine, he played a zombie in a low-budget
movie filmed in Akron, Ohio, called "The Dead Next Door." He
and about 20 other zombies, their faces splattered with fake
blood and caked with gooey stuff, surrounded a human being,
raised their hands in the air and collectively moaned. "It's
fun to walk around and be a monster," he says.</p>
<p>Here in Pennsylvania, people have a special kinship to
zombies. Twenty years ago and about a half-hour's drive
north, Mr. Romero filmed the original "Night of the Living
Dead." It became a cult classic and put the little town of
Evans City on the map. Locals still talk about huddling as
children outside the cemetery where part of the movie was
filmed and telling ghost stories.</p>
<p>Mr. Romero, who wrote a revised script and is acting as
executive director, decided on a remake for one reason:
money.</p>
<p>Apparently, some copies of the first film were
inadvertently distributed without a copyright, which meant
virtually anyone could use the film without paying the movie
makers. As a result, original investors, who pooled their
meager funds to make the $114,000 cult classic, reaped less
than $1 million, even though the movie was translated into 17
languages and launched Mr. Romero's career as a horror-film
guru.</p>
<p>The $4.2 million color remake, he hopes, will make enough
money to give original backers and copyright owners -- aunts,
grandmothers and uncles -- a reasonable return on their
initial investment. "From my standpoint, this is purely
financial," says Mr. Romero.</p>
<p>Still, horror-film fanatics can't wait to sink their fangs
into the new "Night of the Living Dead," says Anthony
Timpone, editor of Fangoria magazine. They want to see if 20
years of technology, special effects and a bigger budget can
improve upon the original.</p>
<p>For one thing, the zombies will be a little classier. The
original zombies were relatives and friends of the movie
makers -- at times, even the movie makers themselves. They
walked mechanically and stared straight ahead. Today's
zombies are sophisticated and take their shot at immortality
seriously.</p>
<p>They attended two sessions to learn how to stumble, fall
and think like a zombie. This left Edward Evans, who hasn't
exercised since 1943 when he was discharged from the army,
sore for weeks. Bob Kowalski, a self-ascribed entertainer who
performs magic shows and plays bass guitar for local bands,
does 50-yard zombie sprints with his arms flapping slowly,
like an arthritic bird. Brenda Byers studied the original
movie three times before her audition and has adopted a
shuffling feet approach. "It helps to empty your mind," she
explains.</p>
<p>The elder Mr. Berry, who is missing a few teeth, says he
doesn't have any problems with the role, even though he has
never seen a zombie or the original movie or studied method
acting. He can roll his eyes backward and drop his jaw. And
he is remarkably spry for a 77 year old. "They used to call
me rubber legs on the dance floor," he says proudly. "I guess
even zombies got to have a certain flair."</p>
<p>It also helps to be a martial-arts instructor. John
Hamilton is kicked, thrown across the kitchen floor and
whacked in the face with a rubber frying pan before getting
nailed in the head with the crowbar. He credits his
showmanship to touring with the Master's World of Karate and
Kung Fu show.</p>
<p>But if being a zombie is difficult, being eaten alive is
no picnic either. Actress Pat Tallman, who stars as the
heroine, had nightmares after reading the script, especially
the part where a drooling, one-eyed zombie with a Rest In
Peace cross impaled in his shoulder attacks her in the
cemetery. "It's disgusting," she says.</p>
<p>Locals relish being involved in the movie, be it ever so
humble. A woman in nearby tiny Hopewell Township, where the
film is actually being shot, tells neighbors that the inside
of her yellow Mercedes will be in the film, and that the crew
used her vacuum cleaner. An eye doctor from nearby Robinson
Township offered the use of 70 glass eyes.</p>
<p>Even the township's Upper Buffalo Presbyterian Church got
into the act. The crew needed a place for New York caterers,
armed with microwave ovens and steamers, to prepare and serve
lunch. The Rev. H. William Dambach consented. The 52-member
church, he says, has its own mission to serve, and besides,
it could use the $125-a-day payment. Now church members won't
have to hold their annual strawberry festival or sell
lemonade at the Washington County fair to help raise $3,000
needed to operate the church for the year.</p>
<p>Little did Rev. Dambach know that such manna would cause
mayhem. False rumors spread that the film was being shot in
the church and its cemetery. The local presbytery received
calls from Rev. Dambach's peers saying the movie runs counter
to the church's belief in a joyous, not ghoulish,
resurrection. "Frankly, I never thought about it," he says a
little sheepishly. "It's just a movie people see to get
scared."</p>
<p>It's also cool, declares eight-year-old Joey Ladisic. His
father, Jeff Ladisic, known locally as Dr. Glass, was hired
to replace windshields and windows that are shattered by
zombies. During the filming, he mentioned to directors that
he had a glass eye and would gladly remove it if they needed
an eyeless zombie. They said yes. His wife, Jeannie, was so
thrilled she took her sons out of school to bring them to the
set. Marvels Dr. Glass: "This is a once-in-a lifetime
opportunity."</p>
