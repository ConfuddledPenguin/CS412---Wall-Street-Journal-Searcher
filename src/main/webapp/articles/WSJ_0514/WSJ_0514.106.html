	<p class="article-leader">EUREKA, Calif. -- A judge said any prospective buyer of
assets of Maxxam Inc.'s Pacific Lumber unit must be notified
that the plaintiff in a pending lawsuit could be awarded
those assets.
   Robert Martel, who filed the suit alleging fraud in
Maxxam's 1985 takeover of Pacific Lumber, said Thursday's
ruling by a Superior Court judge in Humboldt County would
make it more difficult for the company to sell the unit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We claim in our underlying suit that Maxxam doesn't even
own this property, that it belongs to the former shareholders
of Pacific Lumber," he said. "So this ruling . . . warns
prospective buyers or lenders that the property is in
question. It stops the company from financially transferring
property they don't own."</p>
<p>San Francisco attorney David Robertson of Morrison &
Foerster, representing Maxxam, said he would petition an
appellate court to reverse the ruling this week. He said the
ruling was "procedural . . . the judge wasn't considering the
merits." He added that the ruling would have no effect on the
operations of the company.</p>
<p>But Attorney Thomas C. Petersen, who assisted Mr. Martel
in his legal battle, said the ruling could make it more
difficult for Maxxam to restructure its Pacific Lumber debt.
Reports earlier this year said Pacific Lumber was considering
a plan to retire its nearly $580 million of junk-bond debt,
originally underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., and
instead borrow the money from banks and insurance companies,
which would buy bonds backed by the company's rich timber
assets.</p>
<p>Maxxam's secretary, Byron Wade, declined comment on its
plans for the debt or any other issue related to the ruling.</p>
<p>The court ruling also means that any lender seeking
collateral from Pacific Lumber assets must be notified that a
lawsuit is pending which could award those assets to the
plaintiff.</p>
<p>Mr. Martel, co-publisher of the Country Activist, a
monthly journal in Humboldt County, brought suit last March
against Maxxam; Maxxam Chairman Charles Hurwitz, a Houston
investor; former Drexel junk-bond wizard Michael Milken; Ivan
Boesky and others, alleging fraud in the takeover. The suit
seeks to invalidate the merger, and also seeks class-action
status.</p>
<p>It was unclear what effect the ruling would have on other
litigation against Maxxam over the takeover, which includes a
consolidated lawsuit filed by former shareholders seeking
$2.25 billion, on grounds similar to Mr. Martel's suit.
Pacific Lumber was also cited in the Securities and Exchange
Commission's suit against Drexel and Mr. Milken.</p>
<p>In Thursday's ruling, Judge William F. Ferroggiaro Jr.
denied a motion by Maxxam to expunge a "lis pendens" -- a
right to notify people that litigation is pending and that
company property could be won back by former shareholders if
they prevail in their lawsuit.</p>
<p>The Maxxam takeover also became the focus of outrage from
environmentalists after Mr. Hurwitz doubled the rate of
cutting redwoods at Pacific Lumber in order to service the
debt. Equally upset were local workers, concerned that the
furious new production would deplete resources and attract
the attention of environmentalists, jeopardizing their jobs.</p>
<p>Although Pacific Lumber was at one time well-regarded by
environmental groups, two environmentally sponsored
initiatives dealing with redwood preservation are awaiting
signature certification to be placed on the California ballot
this year. They would include bond measures for the state to
buy and set aside old-growth redwood reserves.</p>
