	<p class="article-leader">ABC's Cambodia documentary, "Peter Jennings Reporting:
From the Killing Fields" deserves some comment of its own,
insofar as it is the centerpiece of this controversy.
   It's our experience that Mr. Jennings's daily instinct is
to play the news straight. But TV journalism -- with its mix
of images, sound and facts -- is an unwieldy instrument, and
too often, large efforts, such as this documentary, go awry.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Why, we wonder (not for the first time) is there so little
room for sublety in TV news? Why is it necessary for TV
journalism to dwell forever in a world of melodramas
inhabited only by the innocent and those who scheme against
the innocent?</p>
<p>The ABC documentary displayed many of the techniques TV
uses repeatedly to make sure viewers Get The Message.</p>
<p>The most familiar is focusing in tight close-up on the
face of one's opponent during an interrogation, as Mr.
Jennings did repeatedly with a State Department official.
From this Joe Isuzu interview, ABC's cameras cut to pictures
of desperately ill Cambodian children (with an obligatory
close-up of a fly on a little limb) who presumably would live
happily ever after except for U.S. intransigence.</p>
<p>We get old footage of the Nixon administration's Cambodian
incursion, bombs cascading down, set against footage of Kent
State going up in smoke, without the least awareness that the
incursion was intended to keep the Khmer Rouge from
prevailing. Throughout, there is withering skepticism about
U.S. explanations and motives set against bland acceptance of
false Vietnamese claims to have withdrawn from Cambodia.</p>
<p>In his letter to us defending the program, Mr. Jennings
asks why (except presumably to give them arms) is a U.S.
Special Forces colonel in Khmer Rouge refugee camps? Simply,
common sense will tell you, to find out what they're up to.</p>
<p>This tendentious character in what purports to be
objective reporting invites suspicion of political motives.
The political stance of the program's producer is surely
relevant, and Mr. Jennings and columnist Anthony Lewis smear
Stephen Morris with their charge of McCarthyism. Yet in the
end, we think that politics is less of an explanation than
the nature of television, which to tell the news needs black
hats and white hats.</p>
