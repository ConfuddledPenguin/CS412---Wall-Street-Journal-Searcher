	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo stocks moved sharply higher Friday, finally
responding positively to the yen's rebound after a week of
caution.
   The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues was up 531.88
points at 31512.14. The index added 34.65 points Thursday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In early trading in Tokyo Monday, the Nikkei index rose
423.60 points to 31935.74.</p>
<p>On Friday, London stocks were broadly higher in moderate
trading.</p>
<p>At Tokyo, volume on the first section was estimated at 600
million shares Friday, down from 731 million Thursday.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index (Topix) of all issues listed
in the first section, which edged 4.02 points higher
Thursday, soared 36.12 points, or 1.56%, to 2348.97.</p>
<p>The second section index, which advanced 38.25 points
Thursday, skyrocketed 63.67 points, or 1.70%, to 3819.82.</p>
<p>Volume in the second section was estimated at 23 million
shares, up from 18.9 million Thursday.</p>
<p>"The dollar moved into a technical sell signal at 155.55
yen, prompting stop-losses by Japanese institutions," said
Kevin Haag, a dealer in overseas operations at Nomura
Securities Co. As a result of the yen's rebound, "we saw a
lot of buying on domestics, as well as on some incentive
stocks," he said.</p>
<p>Buying on major domestic issues, which had been lagging,
including Japan Airlines (JAL), Nippon Telegraph & Telephone
(NTT) and KDD, pumped up the Nikkei 225 index in the
afternoon session.</p>
<p>In addition, despite their export-oriented businesses,
high-priced, high-technology electricals also swelled,
reflecting overall market bullishness, Mr. Haag said.</p>
<p>"It was basically up all the way, all afternoon," one
trader at a top Japanese brokerage house said.</p>
<p>Mr. Haag said that "the stock market is on a much more
positive footing" now that "we may be moving into a new
trading for the yen-dollar." The yen's strength Friday had a
positive effect on the short-term bond market and stock bond
futures, he added.</p>
<p>A new trading range for the yen-dollar rate "could have
major consequences for these companies" that have suffered
major profit weakness from the yen's deterioration, Mr. Haag
asserted. "We could have to revaluate corporate earnings
prospects on this basis."</p>
<p>But Mr. Haag pointed out that the yen's recovery could
well be short term and said that the foreign-exchange markets
will have to be carefully watched.</p>
<p>The dollar closed in Tokyo Friday at 154.17 yen,
plummeting from 156.75 in Tokyo late Thursday.</p>
<p>According to Mahmoud Ghaemmaghami, manager of research and
a portfolio adviser at WestLB Securities Pacific Ltd., the
yen's strengthening is linked to the Group of Seven's
communique on the importance of a stronger yen for global
economic adjustment, and the theory that interest rates in
the U.S. have peaked.</p>
<p>The scenario has improved for the undervalued Japanese
stock market, as support for the currency may translate into
greater inflow of money into Japanese financial instruments,
both bonds and equity, Mr. Ghaemmaghami said.</p>
<p>Gains were spread across the board, with special interest
in low-priced steel, real estate, electric power and bank
stocks.</p>
<p>Nippon Steel, Nisshin Steel, Kawasaki Steel and NKK were
all higher.</p>
<p>Industrial Bank of Japan rose 180 yen ($1.15) to 4,180 yen
($26.64), Sumitomo Bank climbed 60 to 2,660 and Fuji Bank
rose 50 to 2,780.</p>
<p>JAL gained 1,000 to 18,600, KDD added 1,300 to 16,800 and
NTT advanced 40,000 to 1.8 million.</p>
<p>Sony added 270 to 8,710, TDK advanced 120 to 6,880 and
Kyocera rose 290 to 7,640. Fanuc gained 230 to 7,250.</p>
<p>London shares finished broadly higher as the market
rallied on better-than-expected U.K. inflation data for
April, released early in the session.</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed
up 18.9 points at 2175.9, well above its low for the day of
2155.6 and off from the 2182.3 peak.</p>
<p>At the close, the narrower FT 30 share index was up 18
points at 1708.8. Volume was 510.1 million shares,
considerably better than the 406.3 million on Thursday.</p>
<p>In the futures market, the June FT-SE 100 index contract
finished at 2215.0, up from its close of 2194 Thursday.</p>
<p>Shares began climbing after the release of the U.K.'s
retail price index for April, which showed inflation running
9.4% higher than a year earlier, but still below expectations
of double digits.</p>
<p>"Anything less than 10% was going to rally the market,"
said a market maker.</p>
<p>Both markups and technical short covering ahead of the
close of the two-week trading account pushed the market
higher, dealers said. Prices fell back slightly for a short
time, but were triggered into further gains by favorable U.S.
economic data that indicated interest rates wouldn't be
boosted in the near future, traders said.</p>
<p>Additionally, some fresh buying followed the opening of
the new trading account, which further bolstered share
prices, dealers said.</p>
<p>Some dealers were bullish about the market's short-term
prospects, but were cautious about predicting large and
sustainable gains for the FT-SE 100.</p>
<p>"I don't think there's going to be a major rally unless
something dramatic changes," such as a reduction of U.K.
interest rates or a downturn in inflation -- neither of which
is likely in the near future, a market maker said.</p>
<p>While overall gloom still overhangs the market, another
trader said investors were more cautious than bearish these
days.</p>
<p>In corporate news, Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products
giant Unilever rose 10 pence (16.7 cents) to 647 on
first-quarter results that showed a 5.2% pretax gain, in line
with market expectations.</p>
<p>ECC Group fell 11 to 348 after reporting a 23% drop in
interim pretax profit and an acquisition that the market
considered overly expensive.</p>
<p>Elsewhere around the market, automotive, industrial and
defense group GKN lost 6 to 360, continuing to suffer after a
profit warning Thursday.</p>
<p>Most blue-chip stocks posted gains in sympathy with the
general market tone.</p>
<p>Thorn EMI rose 10 to 677; Courtaulds jumped 12 to 319 and
petroleum group Lasmo advanced 11 to 383.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, stock prices closed higher in Amsterdam and
Stockholm and lower in Paris, Frankfurt and Milan. Prices
were mixed in Brussels. South African gold stocks closed
weaker.</p>
<p>Share prices closed higher in Sydney and Singapore; lower
in Hong Kong, Taipei and Seoul and mixed in Manila and
Wellington.</p>
<p>Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.</p>
