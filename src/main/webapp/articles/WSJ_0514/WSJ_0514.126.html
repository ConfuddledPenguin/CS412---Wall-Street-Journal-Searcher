	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A former executive of United Technologies
Corp. was sentenced to six months in prison and fined $5,000
for conspiring to obtain inside information about Pentagon
competition for a Navy contract.
   Roger Engel, 49 years old, who was vice president of the
company's Norden Systems division in Norwalk, Conn., was
sentenced by U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton in Alexandria,
Va.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The former executive cooperated with the Justice
Department's broad investigation of Pentagon procurement
fraud, which the department called "Operation Ill Wind." He
was the third former Norden executive to plead guilty to
participating in a conspiracy to obtain inside bid
information on a roughly $150 million contract to build a
battlefield air-traffic control system for the Marine Corps.</p>
<p>The three men said they arranged in 1988 for Norden to pay
defense consultant Thomas Muldoon $49,500 to get information
about the Navy's contract competition from his contacts in
the Defense Department.</p>
<p>Mr. Muldoon was sentenced to 27 months in prison and fined
$10,000 in February for participating in an unrelated scheme
to bribe a Pentagon procurement official. He is appealing his
conviction.</p>
