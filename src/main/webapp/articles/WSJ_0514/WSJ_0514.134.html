	<p class="article-leader">Genetics Institute Inc. said it expects to announce on May
21 the formation of a joint venture between it and a Japanese
company to develop drugs that promote bone growth.
   The company said the venture will focus on bone
morphogenetic proteins, which may someday help in treating
orthopedic, dental and other bone disorders.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Last year, the biotechnology concern reported that it was
awarded a U.S. patent for bone morphogenetic protein-1, or
BMP-1, a substance that can induce formation of new
cartilage. The company also has filed patent applications on
other BMP proteins.</p>
<p>Genetics Institute, Cambridge, Mass., said terms of the
Japanese joint venture will allow it to retain North American
rights to the potential BMP products.</p>
