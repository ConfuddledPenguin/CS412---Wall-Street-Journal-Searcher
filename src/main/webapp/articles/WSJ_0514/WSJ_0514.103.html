	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Poseidon Pools of America Inc. said it fired
its chief executive officer. It also said a party that
invested $150,000 in the company wants its money back.
   A spokesman said the announcements are unrelated, but
declined to elaborate further.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The manufacturer and retailer of above-ground swimming
pools said it dismissed Joseph A. Cioni, its president and
chief executive officer, who was hired in February. It said
the company's chairman, George Tassone, was reinstated as
Poseidon's chief executive.</p>
<p>Separately, Poseidon said the investor has alleged that
the company failed to disclose at the time of the investment
certain "improper conduct" by Mr. Tassone. The company said
its board has established a committee of outside directors to
investigate the allegations. Mr. Tassone could not be reached
for comment.</p>
