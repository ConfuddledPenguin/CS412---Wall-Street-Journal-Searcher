	<p class="article-leader">The Trump Shuttle has lost at least $85 million since
Donald Trump bought it last June, which suggests that it will
be difficult for the real estate mogul to sell the airline at
a profit, or even to break even.
   The Shuttle's fiscal results, obtained by this newspaper
and confirmed by people familiar with Trump Shuttle
operations, show that the airline eked out an operating
profit over the past few months, after six months of
operating losses following its acquisition. But after debt
service, amortization and other factors, the operation was
still showing a net loss of more than $150,000 a day as of
last month. The losses may mean that Mr. Trump could have
difficulty breaking even on a sale of the airline, which he
purchased from Eastern Airlines for $365 million last year
and which he announced was up for sale last month.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Trump has said he expects the Shuttle to sell for as
much as $600 million, but some analysts have said the asset
is not worth more than $400 million. Given his losses, Mr.
Trump would have a substantial loss on the sale, if the lower
estimate is accurate. Mr. Trump has said there are numerous
suitors, including America West Airlines. One new potential
buyer is former Pan Am chairman C. Edward Acker; people
familiar with the situation said Mr. Acker is negotiating to
purchase the airline for between $450 and $475 million. Mr.
Acker couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>A possible sale of the Shuttle is part of a larger
strategy by Mr. Trump to raise cash for future purchases. Mr.
Trump is also refinancing many of his real estate holdings,
and has discussed selling certain casino assets. Such actions
have led to speculation that Mr. Trump needs to raise cash to
offset his debt load. Mr. Trump has vehemently denied he has
cash flow shortage.</p>
<p>The Northeast corridor shuttle once was considered one of
the premier franchises in the airline industry. In its last
five years of operation, Eastern earned an annual average net
income of just under $19 million, though the company did not
have to carry the debt load Mr. Trump does. The shuttle route
is also profitable for Mr. Trump's competitor, Pan Am Corp.
(That airline does not break down its Shuttle figures,
however.) When Mr. Trump purchased the shuttle from Eastern,
the parent was operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection and in the midst of a strike, and its market share
had slipped to 17%.</p>
<p>Since the purchase, the Trump Shuttle has shown some
improvement; the airline had a $12 million operating loss for
the period between last June's start-up and year end. In this
year's first quarter, it had an operating profit more than $1
million. And last month, it earned over $2 million from
operations. Still, it has yet to post a net profit. It had a
net loss of $5 million in April, a $20 million loss in the
first quarter and a $60 million loss last year.</p>
<p>The net loss figures include debt service, non-cash
charges and a management fee paid to Mr. Trump. People
familiar with the operation stressed that the noncash charges
were only paper losses, because they included depreciation of
assets that may not lose value.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump has said most of the losses reflect the start-up
costs of getting the Shuttle in gear after it lost market
share during the Eastern strike, and capital improvements.
And people familiar with the situation, pointing to the
improving results, say that April's figures show that the
Shuttle has turned the corner.</p>
<p>But the fiscal results do not take into account any
personal debt taken on by Mr. Trump to finance the
acquisition. Mr. Trump is believed to have made virtually the
entire acquisition with borrowed funds -- including not only
the $365 million purchase price but $35 million to refurbish
airplanes.</p>
<p>According to the documents, the Shuttle has a $245 million
mortgage. Mr. Trump is believed to have borrowed an
additional $155 million. Therefore, although the shuttle is
paying debt service of the $245 million loan, the additional
debt isn't included in the corporate documents.</p>
<p>The Trump Shuttle's heavy losses are a reflection of Mr.
Trump's inability to pick up as much business from Pan Am as
he originally predicted he would. He currently commands about
half of the passenger market share. That figure is way up
from the 17% share he inherited from strike-torn Eastern, but
far short of the 60% he said he expected to have by this
date, and short of Eastern's peak of 53% market share.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump has been hit with higher fuel costs and a
recession in the Boston market that has cut into ridership.
Moreover, his heavy spending efforts to refurbish planes and
offer luxury service have been lost on business travelers
more concerned with schedules than glitz, travel agents said.</p>
<p>The losses may also show that for all his name appeal,
even Mr. Trump may not be able to overcome the harsh economic
realities of the deregulated airline industry. Because of
economies of scale, larger airlines, including rival Pan Am,
can pay less for marketing, maintenance and computer
reservation systems than a relatively small operation such as
the Trump Shuttle.</p>
<p>People familiar with the situation said that certain
clauses in his pact with Eastern prevent him from selling the
shuttle to six major carriers for six years. But they said
that because Eastern, still in Chapter 11, needs cash, the
company's creditors probably would waive that restriction for
a fee.</p>
