	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- The French building group Bouygues S.A., its
television affiliate TF1 and the Swedish media concern
Kinnevik AB announced Friday that they have signed an accord
to cooperate in the field of television.
   The three concerns said that they signed the preliminary
cooperation accord May 9. Their first step, they said, will
be to consider a bid for the entertainment arm of Esselte AB,
which includes the pay television channel Filmnet. Esselte
put the unit up for sale about two months ago; as many as 10
different media groups from Europe and North America are
thought to be interested.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts have estimated that the unit may fetch a price as
high as $400 million.</p>
<p>Beyond the Filmnet purchase, Bouygues, TF1 and Kinnevik
are expected to use the cooperation accord to generate
economies of scale, especially regarding the purchase of
programs.</p>
<p>TF1 has the largest television market share in France.
Bouygues is its largest shareholder with an interest of about
25%.</p>
<p>Kinnevik controls the Scandinavian channel TV3 as well as
the recently launched pay channel TV 1000.</p>
