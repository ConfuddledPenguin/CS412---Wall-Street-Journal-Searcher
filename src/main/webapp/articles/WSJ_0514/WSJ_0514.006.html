	<p class="article-leader">TORRANCE, Calif. -- A unit of Banner Industries Inc.'s
Fairchild Industries Inc. subsidiary pleaded guilty to
federal charges of conspiring to falsify test reports on
special nuts, bolts and other fasteners used on most U.S.
commercial and military aircraft.
   Fairchild's VSI Corp. on Friday agreed to pay a fine of
$2.5 million and reimburse the government for about $1
million for the costs of the investigation. In addition, VSI
agreed to pay $14.5 million to the government, part of which
will be distributed to former employees who brought
allegation of wrongdoing to federal investigators.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Last week, Assistant U.S. Attorney Bruce D. Carter brought
charges against Fairchild's Voi-Shan testing laboratory in
Chatsworth, Calif., a unit of VSI, and two of its managers in
a complaint filed in federal court in Seattle.</p>
<p>Documents cite numerous instances in which Voi-Shan
allegedly failed to conduct tests of strength, durability and
brittleness. The unit allegedly produced reports approved by
a fictitious inspector indicating that such tests had been
properly performed in an attempt to hold down costs and boost
profits, according to court documents.</p>
<p>"Any breach of government inspection procedures is a very
serious matter," said Ben W. Prescott, newly appointed
president of the Fairchild Fasteners Group. He said the
company has "taken steps to prevent such conduct from ever
taking place again."</p>
<p>Customers include such major aircraft and engine
manufacturers as Boeing Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp.,
Lockheed Corp., General Electric Co. and United Technologies
Corp.'s Pratt & Whitney Co. subsidiary.</p>
<p>The complaint also names as defendants James E. Ryan, a
former Voi-Shan quality-assurance manager, and Aram
Marderian, a former metallurgical lab supervisor for
Voi-Shan. If convicted, each faces a maximum sentence of five
years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Neither could be reached
for comment.</p>
