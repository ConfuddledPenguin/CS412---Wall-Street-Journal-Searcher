	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Laventhol & Horwath, the seventh-biggest U.S.
accounting firm, is encountering new setbacks in the wake of
its litigation problems and profit decline.
   The Philadelphia-based firm has lost a big Canadian
affiliate, is experiencing an exodus of key personnel and is
under pressure from its main lender to sell some of its
divisions or units, people close to the situation said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Laventhol declined comment on the personnel losses and the
alleged bank problems. But it confirmed that its Canadian
affiliate with 30 partners and 200 professional staffers in
Toronto and annual revenue of $25 million Canadian dollars
(US$21.3 million) is planning to join Price Waterhouse in
Canada by July 1 or later.</p>
<p>In Toronto, Eric Slavens, co-managing partner of the
Toronto office, said: "We're joining Price Waterhouse because
we need more cross-country coverage for clients in Canada and
Price Waterhouse gives us full 21-city coverage."</p>
<p>Edward Suarez, a national partner with Laventhol, which
has 51 U.S. offices and annual U.S. revenue of $345.2
million, said that the Toronto office is a separate firm of
Horwath International, Laventhol's international
organization. "We still have three other affiliates in Canada
in Vancouver, Winnipeg and Montreal," he added.</p>
<p>But other current and former Laventhol officials said that
the Toronto affiliate and Horwath's London affiliate are key
cogs in making Laventhol an international firm. "This loss
will really hurt them," said one former Laventhol executive.
Mr. Suarez said he believes that Horwath would seek another
affiliate in Toronto.</p>
<p>The Canadian setback comes at a time when Laventhol is
still reeling from large U.S. lawsuits. These have resulted
in the firm's paying out more than $50 million over the past
three years for alleged sloppy audit and
financial-preparation work. Also, Laventhol's operating
profit prior to litigation costs in the year ended last Jan.
31 declined 9% from a year earlier and Laventhol reduced a
quarterly profit distribution to partners in mid-April by
half.</p>
<p>Laventhol declined comment about its current problems,
issuing a statement declaring that questions are a "rehashing
of past situations and innuendo and unattributed false
claims." Reached at home, Robert N. Levine, who will assume
the firm's top post on June 1 and is effectively running
Laventhol's operations now, declined comment beyond the
statement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, however, a person close to Laventhol said that
Chase Manhattan Corp.'s Chase Bank, a lead lender of an $80
million loan package, has two employees at Laventhol's
Philadelphia office monitoring Laventhol's receivables. The
$80 million package is allegedly double what Laventhol had
borrowed from banks prior to this year. The bank has
suggested that Laventhol sell off two divisions --
Construction Monitoring and Valuation Counselors -- to put
the accounting firm on a sounder financial footing, the
person said. Laventhol declined to confirm or deny the
report, and Chase officials couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Construction Monitoring, which values construction
projects for financial institutions and monitors conformance
with construction-loan agreements, is based in New York and
has offices in San Francisco, Chicago and Los Angeles. Its
annual revenue ranges between $3 million and $4 million.</p>
<p>Valuation Counselors, which values businesses, assets,
property and equipment and does real-estate and health-care
facility appraisals, is based in Chicago and has offices in
Atlanta, Houston, Los Angeles, Boston and Princeton, N.J. Its
annual revenue tops $19 million.</p>
<p>In addition, a growing number of partners and others are
leaving Laventhol, though some say the reasons are unrelated
to the firm's problems.</p>
<p>In Chicago, key strategic-planning and health-care
consultants have told Laventhol of plans to go elsewhere.
These include Barbara Shomaker and Edward Kazemek,
consultants who are starting their own firm; Kristine E.
Peterson, a healthcare consultant who said she plans to
travel to Sweden for a year, and Bruce Richman, who said he
plans to join the Chicago office of Coopers & Lybrand, a
major accounting firm.</p>
<p>Asked why he was leaving, Mr. Richman, who joined
Laventhol in 1987, said, "It's no secret about what's going
on at Laventhol." He added: "One of the problems is that {we}
are not always totally informed about the firm's problems."</p>
<p>Others who have left or who have announced plans to leave
Laventhol include Philip Winik, area managing partner for the
firm's western region out of Los Angeles; Al Zezulinski, a
health-care consultant based in Philadelphia; David Love,
managing partner of the Boston office; Peter Griffith, a
consultant in Boston; David Ross, a management consultant
based in New York; Bruce Ross, no relation to David, in
litigation support in Los Angeles; and Ernest Ten Eyck,
national accounting and auditing partner in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Mr. Winik, 55 years old, said he plans to take early
retirement for "personal reasons." He added: "My decision
wasn't spur-of-the-moment and has nothing to do with the
current state of the firm. I've planned it for some time."</p>
<p>David Ross said he planned to leave June 1 after being
with Laventhol for 10 years. "I feel I'd rather be in
industry than with a public accounting firm," he said,
declining further comment.</p>
<p>Asked why he was leaving, Bruce Ross declined comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Ten Eyck said he plans to leave Laventhol next year
after 10 years with the firm. He said that his leaving
doesn't relate to any problems Laventhol is having "but that
at the age of 46 I have decided to do something else other
than public accounting."</p>
