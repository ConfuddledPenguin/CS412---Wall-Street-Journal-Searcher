	<p class="article-leader">Source Perrier S.A. said consolidated net income fell 74%
to 266 million francs ($48.2 million) in 1989 from the year
earlier's unusually high level of 1.03 billion francs.
   The French mineral-water group's widely anticipated
earnings plunge largely reflected its much-publicized
problems with benzene content in its Perrier mineral water
and a subsequent world-wide recall of the product. At the
same time, it recorded a marked decline in non-recurring
gains from asset sales that had significantly boosted its
1988 results.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The cost of the recall, which was outlined in the group's
1989 accounts even though it was incurred in February 1990,
was 435 million francs. Perrier has expected to cover most of
these costs with non-recurring gains from the sale of
non-strategic assets, but these totaled only 254 million
francs for 1989.</p>
<p>Excluding the non-recurring factors, Perrier said that its
operating profit for 1989 was 1.41 billion francs ($255.8
million), up 21% from a year earlier. Revenue climbed 11% to
17.19 billion francs during the same period.</p>
