	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Two new government reports, suggesting that
the economy is more sluggish and inflation less intense than
previously thought, should end speculation that the Federal
Reserve is about to push up interest rates this week.
   The new April statistics, showing a drop in prices at the
producer level and a decline in retail sales, come as the
Fed's policy committee prepares for a meeting this week.
While many analysts had thought the Fed might boost rates to
curb inflation, the new figures make it likely the committee
will leave its grip on rates unchanged -- a prospect that
helped produce a rise in bond prices and a surge in stocks
after the reports came out Friday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Labor Department reported that producer prices dropped
0.3% in April, following a 0.2% decline the month before.
Analysts say the two-month decline in producer prices should
eventually bring down consumer prices, which galloped upward
at a worrisome 8.5% annual rate in the first quarter of this
year.</p>
<p>Separately, the Commerce Department said retail sales fell
a steep 0.6% in April, due largely to a continued sharp
decline in automobile sales. Retail sales fell a revised 0.2%
in March.</p>
<p>The statistics add further confusion to the current
economic picture, which has been characterized by
intermittent signs of sluggish growth and rising prices.
"People keep thinking we have to be doing one or the other,
inflating or going into recession," says Donald Ratajczak,
who heads the economic forecasting project at Georgia State
University. "The truth is, we aren't doing much of either."</p>
<p>"While we should never draw simply from one month's
numbers, we believe that the upsurge in inflation will abate
as the year progresses and inflation will remain under
control," said Michael Boskin, chairman of the White House
Council of Economic Advisers. "There were many special
factors affecting the consumer price index and producer price
index in the first part of the year, and the inflation rate
in the first quarter overstated the inflation problem."</p>
<p>"The economy is not resurging and inflation is not
accelerating," said Lyle Gramley, chief economist for the
Mortgage Bankers Association.</p>
<p>The slump in automobile sales heavily affected both of the
latest economic reports. Auto sales plummeted 2.7% in April
from the previous month, the Commerce Department said,
dragging down the overall retail sales number. And efforts to
boost sales by cutting prices caused the Labor Department's
index of passengercar prices to drop 0.3% in April, following
a 0.8% decline in March.</p>
<p>Excluding automobiles, retail sales were unchanged in the
latest month. Rosalind Wells, who is chief economist for the
National Retail Federation and who monitors retail sales
closely, said that "consumer demand is holding up pretty
well, except for durable, high-ticket items."</p>
<p>The drop in producer prices largely reflected a recovery
from January's sharp spike in food prices caused by unusually
cold weather. Tomato prices dived 73%, sweet corn prices fell
50% and cabbage prices dropped 36% in the latest month.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, producer
prices in April rose a modest 0.2%, compared with a 0.3%
increase the month before.</p>
<p>In financial markets, some traders speculated that new
signs of a weak economy and low inflation would lead the Fed
to ease its grip on credit at the meeting this week. But
that's not likely. A number of Fed policy makers have
recently expressed concerns about the inflation trend, and
their views are unlikely to be changed by these two reports.</p>
<p>"I think it would be premature to conclude that . . . the
Fed is about to ease policy," said Norman Robertson, chief
economist for Mellon Bank. "I think the Fed has shown
commendable caution about shifting policy on the basis of
month-to-month changes in data."</p>
<p>"We've still got an inflation problem," agrees Mr.
Gramley. "This number just says it's not fundamentally
getting worse."</p>
<p>Producer prices of intermediate goods, which still require
some processing, rose 0.1% in April after remaining unchanged
in March. Crude-goods prices dropped 3.1% during the month,
reflecting a sharp fall in prices of petroleum as well as
food. Excluding food and energy, prices of crude goods rose a
steep 2.2% in April following a 2% rise in March.</p>
<p>The drop in retail sales left them at $148.64 billion for
the month. Sales of durable goods, which are intended to last
more than three years and include autos, dropped 1.6% in
April to $53.79 billion. Sales of nondurable goods were
virtually unchanged at $94.85 billion.</p>
<p>Figures in both reports are adjusted for seasonal changes.
Before adjustments, retail sales last month totaled $145.46
billion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, meeting in a Virginia mountain resort during
the weekend, leaders of many of the nation's largest
corporations also predicted inflation will slow sharply from
its swift first-quarter pace. Members of the Business
Council, an association of chief executives, said they expect
consumer prices to grow at a 3.3% annual rate in the second
quarter, a big retreat from their 8.1% rate in the first. For
all of 1990, they expect inflation to run about 4.8%.</p>
<p>The corporate chieftains' projections were based on a
report by the council's advisory group of economists.
Overall, the Business Council says the economy will grow
about 2% this year. None of its 19 economists expects a
recession this year or next.</p>

<p>Here are the Labor Department's producer price indexes
(1982=100) for April, before seasonal adjustment, and the
percentage changes from April, 1989.</p>
<p>Finished goods ....................... 117.0   3.5%</p>
<p>  Minus food & energy ................ 125.6   4.0%</p>
<p>Intermediate goods ................... 112.8   0.4%</p>
<p>Crude goods .......................... 102.6  -1.7%</p>
