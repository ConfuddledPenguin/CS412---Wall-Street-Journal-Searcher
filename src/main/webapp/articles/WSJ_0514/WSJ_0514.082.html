	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Every industry has its Holy Grail. For the
cellular-telephone business, it's digital technology, which
promises to reduce crowding on the airwaves, cut costs and
spur growth.
   Cellular phones have become victims of their own
popularity: No longer merely toys of stockbrokers and movie
moguls, they are now so abundant that they are straining the
capacity of current networks. Cellular callers in Los Angeles
and New York must sometimes wait several minutes for a dial
tone.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"There are certain downtown areas or heavily traveled
highways where usage is so high at, say, rush hour that calls
just get blocked," says Gregory Vogt, chief of the Federal
Communications Commission's Mobile Services Bureau.</p>
<p>Cellular operators also face the prospect of a new
competitor: so-called personal communications networks. These
systems, suited more to office than car use, would use
smaller and less costly phones and equipment to transmit
calls in a higher frequency range than cellular phones. The
FCC just last week approved a test of these networks, though
results won't be known for a couple of years.</p>
<p>Cellular operators are counting on digital networks, which
soon will begin boosting their capacity, to open the door for
the industry to meet these challenges and continue its rapid
growth. Digital systems being installed in Los Angeles (by
Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co., a joint venture of LIN
Broadcasting Inc. and BellSouth Corp., and by Pacific Telesis
Group's PacTel Cellular unit) and in New York (by Nynex
Corp.'s Nynex Mobile Communications unit and by Metro One,
owned by LIN and Metromedia Inc.) are expected to begin
operating early next year, and the rest of the country may
get the technology within five years.</p>
<p>Digital networks, which will be compatible with existing
analog cellular phones, initially "will give us a threefold
increase in the number of calls we can handle over the
current radio spectrum," says Terry S. Parker, president of
GTE Corp.'s mobilephone business. Within a few years, digital
systems are expected to have six to seven times the capacity
of today's equipment.</p>
<p>Existing cellular systems are actually hybrids of digital
and analog technology. When a call goes out over the current
cellular network from a car or briefcase phone, the
electrical pattern of a voice is transmitted in the form of
continuous radio waves, picked up by and passed among many
radio transceivers called cell sites. This traffic is
coordinated by digital switches that are wired to both the
cell sites and the regular phone network.</p>
<p>Fully digital systems, in contrast, will transmit voices
in the form of a series of pulses, representing the zeros and
ones of computer language. This technology enables a cellular
system to fit more voice conversations on a single channel.</p>
<p>The current system proved adequate for many years, but in
many areas it isn't anymore. The number of cellular
subscribers reached 3.5 million last year, nearly triple the
level of two years earlier. Clifford A. Bean, a mobile-phone
analyst at Arthur D. Little Inc., Cambridge, Mass., expects
the number to nearly triple again to 10 million by 1993, and
to exceed 20 million by the year 2000.</p>
<p>Digital network equipment will cost about $500 per
subscriber to install, or about half the cost of analog
systems, according to Alf Humphries, telecommunications
analyst at Hanifen Imhoff Inc., an investment-banking firm in
Denver. That means a company such as PacTel Mobile, which now
has about 413,000 subscribers, would need to spend about $200
million to service its current customers on the new
equipment, he says.</p>
<p>At the same time, digital systems are expected to reduce
operating costs. Their greater capacity and superior built-in
diagnostic capabilities should lower costs on a per-channel
basis by 10% to 25%, says Piyush Sodha, director of cellular
product line management for Northern Telecom Ltd.'s U.S.
subsidiary.</p>
<p>The increased capacity and efficiency of digital systems
will stimulate customer demand and push prices down, says
John A. Berrigan, a vice president and cellular industry
consultant at Booz Allen & Hamilton Inc. Cellular subscribers
now pay an average of about $100 a month for service, and Mr.
Berrigan estimates that digital technology should cut the
monthly bill by 25% or more within five years as traffic
increases on the new networks.</p>
<p>"Pricing has been kept high by the carriers as one of the
methods for handling demand in highly populated areas," Mr.
Berrigan says. With digital, he adds, carriers will be able
to "broaden their base of customers" from affluent
professionals to more middle-income customers. It isn't clear
how digital technology will affect cellular companies'
revenues as prices fall.</p>
<p>Digital technology may feed growth in other ways. It
should significantly boost data transmission speeds, moving
the so-called portable office closer to reality. Now,
cellular customers using a portable fax machine or laptop
computer from a car or train must struggle with snail'-space
transmission.</p>
<p>Andrew Czernek, vice president of marketing at Zenith Data
Systems, a Groupe Bull company, says digital networks would
allow cellular data transmissions to at least match the
regular phone network in speed. Would this help Zenith sell
more laptop computers? "Did creation of the interstate
highway system help Ford sell more cars?" asks Mr. Czernek.
"I would expect dramatic 30% to 100% -- type increases (in
unit sales), not 5% to 10%."</p>
<p>General Motors Corp. is looking at whether digital
technology can be used to monitor engine-maintenance
computers in its cars. Digital cellular communications could
also become the basis for a two-way highway communications
system under study by the Transportation Department that
would offer route guidance and traffic-flow information to
motorists.</p>
<p>The new technology is expected to tighten security for
cellular calls. "Communications will be more private than
with current analog systems, which you could listen in on
with a scanner," Mr. Bean says. "Digital communication is
inherently scrambled" since, to an outside computer,
transmissions -- including digital voice traffic -- appear as
a jumble of ones and zeros.</p>
<p>Still, the transition to digital will require some
sacrifice. For one thing, new customers will have to use
hybrid phones that let the caller switch between analog and
digital transmission, depending on location. At least
initially, the new phones probably will be more expensive
than their analog counterparts. They also will be bigger,
with bigger batteries -- interrupting an industry trend
toward smaller phones.</p>
<p>"The new units will deliver an audio quality as good as
analog (and) will be bigger, and the (power pack) in the
trunk of the car will be bigger, "says James P. Caile,
director of marketing at Motorola Inc.'s Cellular Group,
which markets the pocket-sized MicroTac, the industry's
smallest phone and an analog unit.</p>
<p>Cellular phones could eventually face a challenge from
other forms of radio communications vying to become the basis
for personal communications networks, or PCNs, of the future.
With these systems, customers would use pocket phones like
Captain Kirk's on "Star Trek."</p>
<p>Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications giant, says it is
testing such a system in Australia, using "microcells" that
wouldn't have to be as sophisticated as regular cellular
equipment. That's because they wouldn't be used for vehicles
speeding down the highway, but rather for use by pedestrians
and office workers.</p>
<p>The FCC is intrigued by PCNs. It recently licensed a
subsidiary of U.K. cellular operator Millicom Inc. to
construct and operate experimental PCNs in Houston and
Orlando, Fla. Millicom, along with partners British
Aerospace, Matra of France and Pacific Telesis, are already
licensed to test a PCN in Britain by 1992, and if successful
will spend more than $1 billion to build a permanent network.</p>
<p>Millicom so far hasn't demonstrated that its system will
work. Indeed, Chairman J. Shelby Bryan acknowledges that a
PCN device in a photo that the company widely distributed to
the media is just a plastic shell minus electronic
components.</p>
<p>"We haven't demonstrated it," Mr. Bryan says, "But the
technology definitely works." He adds that a PCN lab
experiment in Britain worked, but he wouldn't identify any
independent observers of these lab tests.</p>
<p>Millicom's network would use thousands of
water-cooler-sized radio systems strategically placed in city
neighorhoods and office buildings to transmit and receive
calls. The little-used high-frequency portion of the radio
spectrum should allow for much smaller phones, requiring
batteries that are approximately one-fifth the size of
portable cellular phone batteries.</p>
<p>Another system, called CT2, seems more of a long shot. A
British development, CT2 works much like a cordless phone in
the home and could even displace pay phone usage. But so far
most British phone customers have avoided it, primarily
because CT2 users can only place calls; they can't receive
them. And the phones are still expensive -- about $300 each.</p>
<p>Tom Powers, president of AT&T's Cellular Systems unit,
says, "One of the biggest difficulties (for CT2 operators)
will be making the network service ubiquitous and
inexpensive," a process that will take years. By then,
cellular operators hope to be well established with efficient
-- and profitable -- digital systems.</p>
