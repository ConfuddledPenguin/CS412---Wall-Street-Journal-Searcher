	<p class="article-leader">MONTREAL -- Air Canada reported a first-quarter loss of 13
million Canadian dollars (US$11.1 million), or 18 Canadian
cents (15 cents U.S.) a share, unchanged from a year earlier.
   The loss, which was expected, came despite a 12% jump in
revenue to C$930 million from C$829 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Excluding one-time gains, the company's operating loss
widened to C$40 million from C$28 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>Pierre Jeanniot, president and chief executive, said "the
traditionally weak first quarter was made worse by a market
decline and the increase in fuel prices." He said he expected
1990 would be a "difficult year."</p>
<p>Air Canada's yield per revenue passenger mile -- the
airline's revenue for each mile flown by a paying passenger
-- was 15.9 Canadian cents in the latest period, unchanged
from a year earlier. While yield stayed flat, fuel costs shot
up 24% to C$143 million and labor costs rose 10% to C$307
million.</p>
<p>The cost increases were partly due to an increase in
capacity. Canada's largest airline had 5.58 billion available
seat miles in the quarter compared with 5.36 billion
available seat miles a year earlier.</p>
<p>Air Canada posted extraordinary gains totaling C$6 million
from the sale of a DC-8 cargo aircraft and the sale of 10,000
shares of GPA Group PLC, the Irish aircraft leasing concern.</p>

<p>Corrections & Amplifications</p>
<p>AIR CANADA'S first-quarter results included 6 million
Canadian dollars (US$5.1 million) net proceeds from the sale
of shares in an investment and an undisclosed amount from the
sale of an aircraft. Yesterday's edition incorrectly
described these sales as extraordinary gains and misstated
the total amount.</p>
