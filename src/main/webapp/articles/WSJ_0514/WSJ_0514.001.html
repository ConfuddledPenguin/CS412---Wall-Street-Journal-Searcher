	<p class="article-leader">EAST HANOVER, N.J. -- Ultimate Corp., which rebuffed a
takeover bid last year, may have yet a second bidder --
Theodore M. Sabarese, its former chairman and the man who
founded the computer-systems company 12 years ago.
   Mr. Sabarese built the company up, but later saw the
company's fortunes sag and his own culminate in a personal
filing under the bankruptcy laws. Last week, he disclosed to
the Securities and Exchange Commission that he is
contemplating making an offer for the company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Sabarese also said he may nominate a slate of
directors for election at Ultimate's annual meeting Aug. 14.</p>
<p>The announcement comes on the heels of one by the investor
Norman Elowitz, chairman of the New York women's-apparel
concern Honey Fashions Ltd. Mr. Elowitz, who made a
$10-a-share takeover proposal to Ultimate in November and was
rebuffed, recently said he may make a new, unspecified bid.</p>
<p>In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Ultimate's shares closed at $7, up 62.5 cents.</p>
<p>"I wish Mr. Sabarese luck. I'm not going away, and I'm
proceeding with my plan," Mr. Elowitz said Friday. "I've put
a confirmed, about $100 million, offer for the company on the
table" and "I hope in the future to make some sort of
friendly arrangement that will benefit all shareholders." Mr.
Elowitz holds about 686,000, or 7.2%, of Ultimate's 9.5
million shares outstanding.</p>
<p>For Ultimate's part, "the company's not for sale," said
Chairman Michael O'Donnell. But the executive reiterated that
the board would review legitimate takeover proposals as part
of its fiduciary duty to shareholders.</p>
<p>Mr. Sabarese couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Last June, Mr. Sabarese resigned as chairman of Ultimate
and also made a personal filing under the bankruptcy laws in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Newark, N.J. The executive listed
$18.8 million of assets and $30.7 million of liabilities.</p>
<p>In his SEC filing, Mr. Sabarese said he holds 626,400
Ultimate shares, about a 6.6% stake. But he also said that he
settled a claim by Midlantic National Bank against him by
agreeing to pay the bank 575,000 Ultimate shares. The court
approved the settlement May 3, and the filing said the
approval is expected to become final on May 16. Midlantic
National Bank is a unit of Edison, N.J.-based Midlantic Corp.</p>
<p>For the third quarter ended Jan. 31, Ultimate reported a
net loss of $1.7 million, or 18 cents a share, compared with
net income ot $3.5 million, or 36 cents a share, in the
year-earlier period. Revenue dipped 2% to $50.7 million.</p>
