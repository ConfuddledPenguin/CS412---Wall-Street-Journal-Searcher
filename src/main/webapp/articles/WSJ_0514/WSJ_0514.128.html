	<p class="article-leader">Warner-Lambert Co. is seeking to invalidate a doctor's
patent on the controversial drug THA, a treatment for
Alzheimer's disease that it hopes to begin marketing soon.
   The Morris Plains, N.J., drug company, in a petition filed
in federal court in Los Angeles, alleged that psychiatrist
William K. Summers, who holds a patent on the drug, failed to
disclose prior research in the area when he applied for the
patent.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As a result, Warner-Lambert contends that the patent is
invalid and that Dr. Summers, of Arcadia, Calif., should be
enjoined from suing the company for patent infringement.</p>
<p>According to the petition, Warner-Lambert had been
negotiating with Dr. Summers for a patent license when the
talks broke off with a threat of a lawsuit by Dr. Summers.
Dr. Summers then allegedly sent licensing proposals to 82
other drug companies, disparaging Warner-Lambert's rights to
the treatment.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Dr. Summers couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Warner-Lambert said it has conducted extensive research on
THA and plans to market it. The drug has been the subject of
controversy for years over its effectiveness and possible
side effects. The company has said it expects the Food and
Drug Administration to approve sale of the drug.</p>
