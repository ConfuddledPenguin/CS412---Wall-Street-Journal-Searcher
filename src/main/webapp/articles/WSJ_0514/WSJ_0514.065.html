	<p class="article-leader">FOREIGN OWNERS OF U.S. LAND</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Foreigners own just under 1% of U.S. agricultural land, a
level that has varied little over the years, the Agriculture
Department said.</p>
<p>The department made its 1989 year-end review under a 1978
law requiring foreigners to register U.S. agricultural land
holdings. As of Dec. 31, 1989, about 12.9 million acres of
agricultural land were owned by foreigners, an increase of
263,273 acres from a year earlier.</p>
<p>"Foreign ownership of U.S. agricultural land remained
relatively steady from 1981 through 1989, slightly above or
below 1% of the privately owned agricultural land in the
U.S.," said John Lee, administrator of the agency.
Corporations owned 81% of the foreign-held acreage;
partnerships, 10%; and individuals, 7%. The remainder is held
by estates, trusts, associations, institutions and others.</p>
<p>The state of Maine has the heaviest concentration of
foreign ownership, with holdings of almost 2.1 million acres.</p>
<p>TOKYO'S RICE POLICY</p>
<p>Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said his nation
would maintain a ban on rice imports to protect domestic
growers despite U.S. demands for improved market access.
"Rice and rice cultivation have a special significance for
our country and in light of this we will continue to adhere
to the basic policy of self-sufficiency," Mr. Kaifu told
legislators. Japanese consumers pay up to six times world
prices for domestic rice as the government props up
inefficient rice producers with substantial subsidies.</p>
<p>SWEDISH-HUNGARIAN DEAL</p>
<p>Sweden's largest newspaper, Dagens Nyheter, said it
intends to buy a 45% stake in Magyar Nemzet, Hungary's
second-largest newspaper. Dagens Nyheter said its
negotiations are with the Hungarian state-owned publisher
Pallas, which owns Magyar Nemzet. According to the deal,
Dagens Nyheter and Pallas will own 45% each of the stock of
the newly formed newspaper corporation. The remaining 10%
will be controlled by a journalist organization. Dagens
Nyheter wouldn't reveal the price of the deal.</p>
<p>CHINESE AID FOR LIBYA</p>
<p>China will send 350 technical advisers to Libya's Misurata
Iron & Steel Complex, the official China Daily said. The
technicians will work in hot and cold rolling mills and a
steel-smelting shop, the paper said. They will join 430
Chinese workers and engineers already working in other parts
of the Libyan complex. The Chinese workers come from the
Wuhan Iron & Steel Complex in central China.</p>
<p>DENUNCIATION IN SWITZERLAND</p>
<p>A prominent Swiss animal-rights campaigner denounced
government plans to allow sales of dog and cat meat as
"monstrous and obscene." Franz Weber, writing in Lausanne's
Le Matin newspaper, charged the proposed law endorsed "a kind
of cannibalism" and would "lower us to the level of the
disparaged monsters of the Philippines and Korea." Swiss
authorities have proposed a revision of 1954 food regulations
that would drop the ban on butchers' selling dog and cat
meat.</p>
<p>NORTH ATLANTIC FISHING</p>
<p>The European Community is willing to study North Atlantic
fish stocks in a bid to resolve Canadian concerns the
resource is being dangerously depleted, EC Fisheries
Commissioner Manuel Marin said. "I think we will be able to
demonstrate the European Community is not the first enemy of
Canadian interests," he said in Ottawa. Canadian fishermen
are concerned about European boats plying the waters just
beyond Canada's 200-mile economic zone and have been
demanding action from Ottawa.</p>
<p>ANOTHER DOCKLANDS DEFECTOR</p>
<p>Stanhope Properties PLC has withdrawn from the Royal Docks
redevelopment project in the London Docklands. It is the
second development company to quit the area this year.</p>
<p>Announcing the Stanhope decision, the London Docklands
Development Corp. blamed the "continuing deterioration of the
property market." Redevelopment of the area, formerly the
site of the decaying docks in London's East End, has been
spotlighted by the Thatcher government as a showcase for the
benefits of free enterprise; but it has been hard hit for
over a year by high base bank-interest rates, which have
undermined property values.</p>
<p>At the start of this year, the development company
Rosehaugh PLC, which had been in partnership with Stanhope in
the Royal Docks project, announced it was quitting. The
260-acre Royal Docks project for a shopping center, business
park and leisure complex was one of the largest development
sites in London.</p>
<p>"The (Stanhope) withdrawal leaves in tatters the London
Docklands Development Corp.'s plans to regenerate one of the
most neglected areas of the East End," the Times of London
commented.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>Iranian vice patrols arrested 20 people in Tehran at the
start of a crackdown on clothing that reveals too many curves
or too much flesh. The new campaign is called "Fight
Manifestations of Corruption." . . . Most single Japanese
women think the main reason they haven't yet married is a
scarcity of "nice men," according to a survey conducted by
the Altmann Institute, a Tokyo matchmaking agency. The survey
defined a "nice man" as one who was good-looking,
intelligent, talkative, honest and highly paid.</p>
