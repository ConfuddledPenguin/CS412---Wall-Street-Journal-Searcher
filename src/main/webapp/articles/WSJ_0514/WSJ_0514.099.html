	<p class="article-leader">There's a New Wave
   In Sea Salvage Rules</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>DEEP SEA exploration may soon reach greater depths thanks
to a court decision involving high-tech salvaging.</p>
<p>The pretrial ruling, handed down in a case in federal
court in Norfolk, Va., permits ocean explorers in
international waters to establish ownership of water-logged
treasure by using remote video cameras to produce live images
("tele-presence") and robots to retrieve objects
("tele-possession"). Previously, courts had ruled explorers
had to physically dive to a site to stake a claim.</p>
<p>The wreck in question, the S.S. Central America, sank in
8,000 feet of water 160 miles off North Carolina in 1857. The
luxury steamship was bound for New York carrying 428
passengers and three tons of gold.</p>
<p>The concept of tele-presence and tele-possession may reach
beyond the sunken ship, however. Before the ruling, only
nations had been found to have deep-ocean salvage rights in
international waters.</p>
<p>The precedent granting individuals the same rights could
affect the future exploration and mining of deep-sea
minerals, says Richard T. Robol, a maritime expert at Hunton
& Williams, a Richmond, Va., law firm; the firm is defending
a group of salvagers over legal claims to the ship's treasure
in a lawsuit now in court in Norfolk. Ultimately, the ruling
could extend to outer space in settling claims over the
recovery of stray satellites and space debris.</p>
<p>"This is an exciting case for the freedom of individuals
to discover, both in the deep ocean and in outer space," says
Mr. Robol.</p>
<p>Some Law Firms Create</p>
<p>A Subspecialty in Art
</p>
<p>TASTE IN ART may be subjective, but art sales and exhibits
increasingly involve legal questions.</p>
<p>As a result, some law firms are cultivating a subspecialty
that combines aspects of business, contract and international
law with a solid knowledge of art.</p>
<p>A five-city U.S. tour of Ming and Qing dynasty paintings
(1368-1911) from China last year raised intricate contractual
problems as well as a touchy international question. When
contracting with museums, lawyers for the tour's sponsor had
to specify the exact type of light required to illuminate the
displays with minimal damage. But first, the lawyers had to
determine whether the works could be seized by Americans who
still have claims pending against China for property lost
when the Communists took power. (The answer was no.)</p>
<p>"When art becomes more of an investment vehicle than a
cultural vehicle, a lot of business is involved," says Jack
R. Bershad, a Philadelphia corporate lawyer who negotiated
the Ming and Qing dynasty tour, as well as the $40 million
sale of Andrew Wyeth's "Helga" and "Olson" series.</p>
<p>"Art law is a very specialized commercial practice," says
Caryn R. Leland, a New York lawyer whose sole practice is
representing artists. "You have a lot of contact with artists
and dealers, a lot of publications, a lot of copyright law,
museum loans, options to buy art." The field also includes
helping artists buy homes and negotiate divorces.</p>
<p>Warning: Be Cautious</p>
<p>In Worker-Theft Cases</p>
<p>FIRING AN EMPLOYEE for heft can be trying for everyone,
particularly if it leads to a lawsuit.</p>
<p>When a security director at Bloomingdale's in White Flint,
Md., found an allegedly stolen calculator in a salesman's
attache case, she detained him in her office, had him sign a
confession and led him through the store in tears. The
salesman filed a suit against Bloomingdale's alleging false
arrest, defamation and intentional infliction of emotional
distress. A Bloomingdale's lawyer says the store acted
properly.</p>
<p>Maryland's highest court will soon decide whether the case
should be thrown out of court. The state's Workers'
Compensation Act, as in many states, bars suits against
employers for accidental job injuries that result in physical
disability. At issue here is whether the law also bars suits
in cases with no physical injuries.</p>
<p>Employment specialists are warning employers to tread
delicately when investigating suspected theft in the
workplace. At all times, says Earle K. Shawe, an expert at
Shawe & Rosenthal in Baltimore, employers should be sure
employees feel free to leave the room or building while being
questioned. Even refusing to allow a phone call or a run to
the bathroom, he adds, can lead to a claim of false
imprisonment.</p>
<p>Rodeo Drive Exclusivity</p>
<p>Doesn't Apply to Labels
</p>
<p>IF CINCINNATI is home of "Palm Beach Clothing" and "St.
Tropez" clothing is made in L.A., why can't Sidney Fell use
"Rodeo Drive" on his label?</p>
<p>Mr. Fell says a group of specialty retailers on the famous
Beverly Hills, Calif., shopping street don't like the stores
-- Sears, Zayre, J.C. Penney and K mart -- that he sells his
children's clothing to. Mr. Fell's California Guys 'N Gals is
on South Flower Street in downtown Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The Rodeo Drive Committee has done much to promote the
street's fabled exclusivity. But a federal judge in Los
Angeles last September said it went too far in suing Mr. Fell
in 1983 for trademark infringement.</p>
<p>The group won an injunction barring Mr. Fell from using
the name on grounds it created confusion about the source of
the goods. But that ruling was reversed in February by U.S.
District Judge David V. Kenyon, who noted none of the stores
manufactures under "Rodeo Drive."</p>
<p>Mr. Fell has resumed using the label and is pressing a
countersuit against the group for $5 million in damages.
Committee members declined to comment.</p>
