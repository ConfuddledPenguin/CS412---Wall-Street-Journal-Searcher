	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Brach's Candy Co. said the Commerce Department
rejected its request to have the company's Chicago plant
designated a Foreign Trading Zone.
   The refusal by the department's Foreign Trade Zones Board
means that the candy manufacturer -- owned by Switzerland's
Jacobs Suchard AG -- won't be allowed to import sugar at
world prices, but must instead continue to buy the essential
ingredient under import quotas that boost its annual costs by
about $20 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The petition had become a rallying point for critics of
the import quotas, which keep domestic sugar prices high by
restricting foreign imports. Such quotas, they contend,
represent a subsidy for U.S. growers at the expense of U.S.
consumers.</p>
<p>A successful bid by the candy company for an exemption
might have sparked similar requests for relief by other
companies.</p>
<p>While it eliminated the last possibility of success for
the Brach's request, the turndown didn't come as a surprise;
late last month, a Commerce Department examiner recommended
that the petition be denied.</p>
<p>Brach's had threatened that if it didn't get the relief it
sought it might close the aging Chicago plant -- an island of
high-paying, unionized production jobs in the midst of the
city's blighted West Side -- and shift the about 3,400 jobs
to either Mexico or Canada.</p>
<p>Late Friday, the company said in a release that it is
"disappointed" with the ruling. "At this time, we haven't
determined what our next steps will be regarding the plant,"
Brach's said.</p>
<p>Had its trade-zone request been approved, Brach's said,
the company would have been allowed to purchase 100,000 tons
of sugar at world prices, currently 10 cents a pound cheaper
than the price in the U.S.</p>
<p>Brach's has spent heavily on modernization at its
66-year-old Chicago plant, and needs to spend much more. The
company has claimed that the only way to justify the further
investment required to bring the plant up to standard is
through access to the cheaper sugar.</p>
<p>Suchard paid $730 million in 1987 to acquire Brach's from
American Home Products Corp., but the acquisition has proven
a major disappointment: Brach's, which had pre-tax 1986
income of $75 million, recorded an operating loss of $50
million in 1989.</p>
<p>The Swiss concern replaced Brach's former management, but
has since repeatedly reshuffled its own Brach's management
team. Analysts say a rapid post-acquisition restructuring,
including changes in its sales operation and what some
industry experts think was an ill-considered streamlining of
Brach's product line, helped giant competitors Mars Inc. and
Hershey Foods Co. take market share away from Brach's.</p>
