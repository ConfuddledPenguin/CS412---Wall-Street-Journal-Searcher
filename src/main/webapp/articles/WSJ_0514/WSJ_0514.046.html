	<p class="article-leader">Standard & Poor's Corp. said it lowered its ratings on
$640 million of Teledyne Inc. debt in the wake of the Los
Angeles diversified manufacturer's recent spinoff of its
insurance operations.
   S&P said it lowered ratings on Teledyne's senior debt to
triple-B-plus from single-A, and to triple-B from
single-A-minus on the company's subordinated debt.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Teledyne's financial flexibility and asset protection are
reduced since the Unitrin Inc. spinoff, the rating agency
said. The insurance operations were "conservatively
capitalized" and held valuable investments that benefited
Teledyne debt holders, the agency added.</p>
<p>S&P said that its revised ratings also reflect the risk of
further corporate restructuring and possible deterioration in
the company's cash-flow protection.</p>
<p>Teledyne's "relatively stable earnings stream," together
with moderate capital needs, currently provide "satisfactory
cash-flow protection," but that "could erode reflecting
mediocre prospects for {the company's} defense operations and
weakness in a number of its end markets," S&P said.</p>
