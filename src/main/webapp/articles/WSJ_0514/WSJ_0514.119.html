	<p class="article-leader">EL CAJON, Calif. -- A state court jury awarded $8.1
million to homeowners in a verdict against a unit of
Christiana Cos. for faulty construction of a San Diego
condominium project.
   Owners of the 50 luxury units charged Christiana with
negligence and implied breach of warranty that resulted in
leaky roofs and balconies in addition to other problems.
After a seven-week trial, the jury agreed with the
homeowners' allegations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Pat Prindle, a San Diego attorney representing Christiana,
said that the verdict probably will be appealed, although a
decision hasn't been reached.</p>
<p>A Christiana spokesman said that the real-estate
investment and management concern has insurance coverage that
will pay part of any award arising from the litigation, which
involved the company's Christiana Community Builders
subsidiary.</p>
