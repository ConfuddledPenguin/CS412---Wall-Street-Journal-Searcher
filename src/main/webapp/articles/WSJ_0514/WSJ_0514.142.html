	<p class="article-leader">Cellular phones may no longer cost as much as a Caribbean
vacation, but they're still pricey enough that buyers can
benefit from serious comparison shopping.
   Basic models that cost $4,000 just a few years ago now
average about $400. Some portables can be purchased for less
than $100 during special promotions. And smart shoppers can
get a lot of extras thrown in for free, such as speaker
phones, hold buttons and call-forwarding systems.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Still shoppers would be wise to look beyond the price tag.
Retailers frequently offer deep discounts on equipment -- but
with a catch: The buyer must sign a contract with a
cellular-phone service. The contracts, which range from 60
days to over three years, often allow retailers to sell
equipment at below the manufacturer's price. But a bargain
phone isn't a good deal if it means signing your phone life
away to the devil.</p>
<p>"The last thing a person wants to be stuck with is lousy
service and outrageous rates," warns David Rosenberg, a
consultant in Dallas.</p>
<p>Cellular phones also can be purchased directly from
service companies. The service companies often offer
low-priced equipment, free installation and antennae and
features such as traffic-report services and stock hotlines
for no extra charge. Periodically, the companies even give
away cellular phones or have two-for-one specials.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it pays to wait. Motorola's pocket telephone
cost about $3,500 when it was introduced last year. But
already the price on the wallet-sized set has tumbled to
about $1,300. One loaded with all the latest gizmos costs
about $1,800.</p>
<p>Buyers should evaluate special features on the equipment,
especially because many "extras" are often standard. Speaker
phones in cars are recommended as a safety feature by the
American Automobile Association because they allow
"hands-free" talking. About the size of a quarter and mounted
on the rear-view mirror, the microphone lets the driver talk
and steer at the same time.</p>
<p>Other features may cost extra up front, but save money
down the road. Among them is the electronic lock. With
cellular service so expensive, it's not a bad idea to keep
other people from gabbing on your line. Electronic locks have
number codes that, when dialed, prevent the phone from being
used. Likewise, call timers can slow the dollar drain by
keeping track of how long you've been talking.</p>
<p>Buyers of car phones should always inquire about
installation. Some companies install for free, while others
charge anywhere from $50 to $200. Cellular telephones come in
three parts -- a receiver that's bolted into the car trunk,
an exterior antenna and an interior telephone unit. For best
reception, an antenna should be placed on the car roof. But
some buyers opt to put the antenna in the trunk for aesthetic
reasons. Cellular service companies warn against putting
antennae on the window because reception tends to be poor,
and the gear can fall off in a car wash.</p>
<p>Cellular subscribers should carefully scrutinize service
carriers. In each city, two cellular service companies are
licensed by the Federal Communications Commission, but there
are also numerous other companies that sell the service as
agents or resellers. Like companies that resell long-distance
telephone service, cellular agents generally have lower
monthly fees and provide innovative rate packages.</p>
<p>Carol Segal, a Detroit consultant, managed to obtain a
cellular service contract that has a monthly access fee of
only $8 a month, plus the per-minute charge. Cellular
carriers can charge access fees as high as $70 a month. "If I
only make two calls a month, it doesn't make sense to pay
more than $8 a month," she explains.</p>
