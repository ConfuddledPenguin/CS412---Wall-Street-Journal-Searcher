	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- California smogfighters who have been
pushing clean fuels as the best way to cut toxic vehicle
emissions are testing a device that they say could help keep
gasoline-powered cars on the road into the next century.
   The device is a new kind of catalytic converter, heated by
electricity from the car battery, that eliminates 50% to 90%
of exhaust pollutants, researchers say. By kicking in sooner
than conventional models, the converter lessens the initial
burst of emissions after the engine is turned on.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"This shows the potential for existing technology to
compete with other alternatives in the market" that will be
created by tough new standards recently proposed for the
mid-1990s by the California Air Resources Board, said agency
spokesman Bill Sessa. "Up until now, most of our attention
has been focused on alternative fuels like methanol, natural
gas and electricity."</p>
<p>Cars don't pollute the same for every mile they are
driven. The "cold start" -- the first few seconds after the
engine is turned on -- is the most polluting part of any
trip. Over the years, makers of catalytic converters have
moved them closer to the engine so that the devices warm up
faster. By adding a heater, the converter reacts in a split
second.</p>
<p>The state agency said it is encouraged by results of
recent tests on a Toyota Camry and a Volkswagen Golf that
were equipped with the quick-heating converter, made by Camet
Co., a Hiram, Ohio, affiliate of W.R. Grace & Co. Other
manufacturers are working on similar products, but Mr. Sessa
said the agency's technical staff believes that Camet is
further along than its rivals.</p>
<p>"Our converter can do the equivalent of what alternative
fuels {can do}; and it's much less disruptive because the
existing gasoline supply system is well-developed and
economical," said Richard Cornelison, Camet president and
founder. Camet said its heated converter would be used in
addition to a conventional converter.</p>
<p>Camet is testing its converter in U.S. and foreign cars to
see if it can withstand mechanical abuse and perform on road
tests. The device is designed for installation in new cars,
rather than retrofitted, because it requires engine
control-system modifications and a more powerful battery. On
a mass-produced basis, the converter could be sold to car
makers for $125 to $150 apiece, Mr. Cornelison said.</p>
<p>In test vehicles, the driver turns a key and waits a few
seconds until an indicator light goes out, then starts the
engine. Car makers would design a system that prevented the
car from starting until the converter turned on. Or, the
converter could be preheated through a sensor in a door
handle or seat belt.</p>
<p>"All of the evidence isn't in on these new catalytic
converters; they don't have the track record we have with
methanol and other fuels," cautioned a spokesman for the
South Coast Air Quality Management District, a regional
agency in Southern California. In any event, clean fuels are
likely to remain the best hope for reducing pollutants in
buses and trucks that aren't equipped with converters.</p>
<p>California, through the Air Resources Board, is the only
state that sets new-vehicle anti-smog standards that are
separate from those of the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency. The state has proposed that by 1997 a quarter of the
cars sold in the state would have to emit 70% fewer
smog-forming hydrocarbons than required by a tough 1994
standard. By 1998, half of all cars sold would have to meet
the stricter standard. The standards go beyond those proposed
in the federal Clean Air Act, Mr. Sessa said.</p>
