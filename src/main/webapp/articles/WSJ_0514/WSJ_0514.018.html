	<p class="article-leader">BASTOGNE, Belgium -- On a hill overlooking the tranquil
Ardennes countryside near here there stands a memorial to the
76,000 Americans who died or were wounded in the Battle of
the Bulge. Around the monument's upper rim, the names of all
the American states are writ large and on its columns are
listed the American units that fought here in that Christmas
season of 1944: the 10th Armored, the 101st Airborne, the
28th Infantry, etc. There is little recognition of the
100,000 German casualties, but non-recognition of fallen
warriors is one of the small prices vanquished nations pay.
   We all know about the large prices Germany has paid since
Gen. Hasso von Manteuffel's Panzers failed to dislodge the
Americans at Bastogne. Hitler's hopes of driving a wedge
through the Allies were dashed, with heavy losses, destroying
any possibility of a negotiated peace. From there Germany
would go on to total defeat, massive loss of property and
lives, postwar destitution and the splitting of its people
between two armed camps, NATO and the Soviet-controlled
Warsaw Pact. Now, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl is
demanding that the final bill, too, be marked paid, allowing
the Germans once more to have a reunited, sovereign nation.
After a half-century, World War II will finally have ended.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Or will it? History is episodic, and we are now witnessing
a dramatic chapter in European history as the empire built by
the Soviet Union out of its World War II conquests crumbles
away, removing the final cruel legacies of that great 1940s
struggle. It is a time of rejoicing in capitals that have
known darkness so long -- Budapest, Prague, Warsaw and
Berlin. But provocative rhetoric about "the end of history"
to the contrary, history also is a continuum. Policy makers
in Moscow, other European capitals and the U.S. are trying to
fathom the implications of what is happening before their
eyes and to bring influence to bear on the next chapter. Only
those people who think that the world suddenly has become a
safe place will think that this process is not crucial to
future peace.</p>
<p>The most immediate questions center as usual on the
intentions and capabilities of the Soviet Union. Is it really
collapsing, and if so is Mr. Kohl in a strong position to get
his way in the "two-plus-four" negotiations over a unified
Germany's future? The only remaining obstacle before Mr. Kohl
is the Soviet suggestion, made at the first two-plus-four
gathering May 5, that the question of a united Germany's
military alliances be left unresolved for several years. Mr.
Kohl thought that sounded like a trick. He says that Germany
itself has decided on its alliances and it will be a part of
NATO. That means that the 380,000 Soviet troops stationed in
East Germany will have to leave. Mr. Kohl is backed by East
Germany's newly elected, pro-reunification government and by
the U.S., Britain and France in his insistence that it is
time for the four allied powers to end their official role in
Germany, allowing Germany full sovereignty.</p>
<p>So far, this debate is being carried on in a gentlemanly
fashion. Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze seems
to be trying to avoid locking himself into a non-negotiable
position, as well he might. The West holds the best cards,
mainly the wherewithal to help Mikhail Gorbachev stave off
what appears to be an impending national bankruptcy. Indeed,
it is quite possible that what Mr. Shevardnadze really is
angling for is an agreement from the West to pay a
substantial sum for a Soviet withdrawal. Something similar
was arranged with the Austrians when the Soviet armies
withdrew from their country 35 years ago. The Russians like
to think of it as reparations for all the trouble military
occupation has put them through. Mr. Kohl last week referred
to the Soviet position as "negotiation poker," thus
suggesting that he is no longer awed by what not long ago was
referred to as "Soviet might."</p>
<p>The most likely scenario is that Mr. Gorbachev will give
in, simply because he will see that sustaining military
forces in Eastern Europe puts him in an untenable financial,
diplomatic and, possibly, military position. He, too, wants a
future in Europe and he cannot have it without Germany's
acquiescence.</p>
<p>But that scenario assumes rational choices. It's not
entirely clear that what is happening in the Soviet Union is
subject to choice, rational or otherwise. As republic after
republic rises in rebellion over economic deprivation and
absence of meaningful political choice and as Russians
themselves display more and more anger, it's impossible to
know what will happen next. Can Mr. Gorbachev afford to be
seen by the Soviet military as backing down on the German
question? Is it possible he will harden his position, simply
refusing to withdraw the Soviet occupation troops? If so, how
will the West respond to that?</p>
<p>In pondering such questions it is not such a bad idea to
hark back 50 years to when this still unended drama began.
Some of the assumptions made by the West then proved to be
costly indeed. One of them was that the combined armies of
France, Holland, Belgium and Britain were a match for the
German forces. On paper it looked that way. But the French
army, despite 800,000 front-line soldiers and 5.5 million
reserves, had never recovered from World War I. Its benighted
top command had somehow assumed German tanks would never come
through the rugged Ardennes, which of course is exactly what
Gen. Heinz Guderian did, pouring his panzers across the
Belgian border on May 10, 1940. The Belgians fought bravely,
but were overmatched. The French generals had assumed that
air power was a curiosity and were routed by German tanks
supported by Stuka dive bombers.</p>
<p>Europe today is a very different place, of course. France,
though not an official participant in the military activities
of the NATO alliance, has a modern military establishment, a
strong economy and orderly government. West Germany has had
45 years of democracy to prepare it for the added
responsibilities it will have to shoulder when it achieves
full sovereignty. Europe, through the Common Market and other
multilateral institutions, has achieved a democratic unity
never before known in its history. Mr. Kohl fully recognizes
the importance of that unity, which is why he insists a
reunified Germany remain a part of the existing Western
alliances.</p>
<p>Which raises the final question. Can the United States,
which on this battlefield won its role as the architect of a
new Europe, now call it a good job and withdraw? Many
Americans think so and the debate in Washington mainly
centers on how many U.S. troops will come home, not whether
they will. Many Europeans do not think so. Don't make
assumptions about a potent enemy, they argue. History shows,
they say, that the price of being wrong is far higher than
any "savings" that might be achieved.</p>
