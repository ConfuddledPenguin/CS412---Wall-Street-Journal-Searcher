	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Unions representing United Airlines' pilots,
machinists and flight attendants ratified new contracts that
will be key to financing the unions' $4.38 billion buy-out
proposal for UAL Corp., United's parent.
   The agreements will provide the company with an estimated
$2 billion in savings over five years through wage
concessions, tougher work rules and benefit reductions. They
also include a five-year no-strike clause.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>UAL's board approved the offer on April 6 and gave the
labor groups four months to complete bank financing for the
transaction. The union offer doesn't have an outside equity
investor. The labor groups are trying to persuade banks that
the cost savings from their concessions represent "sweat
equity."</p>
<p>Ratification of the agreements is the clearest indication
to date that the buy-out proposal has the support of the
unions' rank and file. The contracts will go into effect only
when the buy-out is completed.</p>
