	<p class="article-leader">BRUSSELS -- Struggling to restore confidence in its
sagging stock price, N.V. Philips is expected to announce a
major management shake-up today -- one that is likely to
include the resignation of its president, Cornelis van der
Klugt.
   Spokesmen for the Dutch electronics giant said only that
Philips would make "a major announcement" this morning. But
people close to the company said they expected Mr. van der
Klugt to be replaced by Jan Timmer, a 57-year-old Philips
veteran. Mr. Timmer already had been designated to succeed
Mr. van der Klugt upon the 65-year-old president's scheduled
retirement in July 1991.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Philips announcement, which comes in the wake of an
unexpected plunge in first-quarter profit, hopes to mute
stinging criticism of the company in recent days from
analysts and investors.</p>
<p>Members of the Philips supervisory board met over the
weekend at the company's headquarters in Eindhoven, the
Netherlands, to devise a plan aimed at trying yet again to
convince the world's stock markets and the company's own
employees that Philips will finally come to grips with the
problems that have been plaguing it for most of the past
decade.</p>
<p>The job of reviving Philips will now apparently be left to
Mr. Timmer, a respected and even feared manager who first
impressed the company's management as head of PolyGram,
Philips's music-recording division. He later took the helm of
the consumer electronics division, helping to revive that
business's fortunes.</p>
<p>Last year, the consumer-electronics division was among the
best performers in the company in terms of its operating
income, which rose 34% to 1.1 billion guilders ($598
million). But managing the sprawling whole of Philips --
which had sales of 57 billion guilders last year under such
brand names as Magnavox and Philco -- will be a Herculean
challenge, especially at a time when Japanese competitors are
strengthening their grip on ever-larger parts of Philips's
key markets.</p>
<p>The drama engulfing Philips began on May 3, when the
company reported nearly disastrous first-quarter results that
took the markets -- and, indeed, the company itself -- by
surprise. Hit by a slump in its computer business,
first-quarter profit from normal business operations
plummeted to six million guilders, from 223 million a year
earlier.</p>
<p>Analysts said the results, which came just weeks after Mr.
van der Klugt had made an optimistic forecast for 1990,
showed that the company had little control over its sprawling
businesses or its financial management.</p>
<p>Company officials said they were unable to predict the
sudden downturn because of the difficulty of getting quick
and accurate information from all of the company's divisions,
which are spread throughout more than 70 countries. The
company was hurt, they added, not only by a world-wide slump
in the computer business but also by unpredictable shifts in
foreign-exchange and interest rates. The first-quarter
results sent the company's stock on a downward spiral.</p>
<p>Speculation late last week that the hard-nosed Mr. Timmer
would be taking control of the company has already helped to
stem the price plunge. In trading Friday, the company's stock
gained 40 Dutch cents, ending at 31.40 guilders ($17.07),
after sinking to as low as 30.40 guilders during the day.
Earlier this month, before the first-quarter results were
announced, the shares were trading near 38 guilders.</p>
