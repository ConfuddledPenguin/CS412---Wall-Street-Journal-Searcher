	<p class="article-leader">French defense and electronics company Matra S.A. said it
would join French government-owned Aerospatiale S.A. and West
Germany's Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H in a project to
develop an improved version of the Roland short-range
surface-to-air missile.
   A linkup among the three companies had been expected since
Thomson S.A. of France and British Aerospace PLC announced
plans late last year for a joint venture to develop missiles.
Aerospatiale Chairman Henri Matre indicated then that he
would welcome an alliance with Matra and MBB.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The new missile to be produced by the three companies, the
Roland Mach 5, will cost about one billion francs ($181
million) to develop over five years, Matra said. Each company
will contribute an equal share to the venture, while overall
technical coordination will be in the hands of Aerospatiale.</p>
