	<p class="article-leader">ROME -- Italian authorites said they seized more than 90
tons of components believed to be parts for the alleged Iraqi
super gun.
   At a Saturday news conference, police said they believed
the parts, made in Italy and destined for Iraq, were for the
posterior section of a giant artillery piece. Officials said
the huge gun would be capable of firing rounds hundreds of
miles, including ones with nuclear or chemical warheads.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Italian law prohibits the sale or shipment of arms to
Iraq. Documents seized along with the components indicate
that the parts were for oil-field equipment ordered by Iraq's
Ministry of Industry.</p>
<p>Carabinieri, Italy's paramilitary police, confiscated the
parts and documents Friday during raids in Terni, Naples,
Rome and Brescia, officials said.</p>
<p>One of the companies involved is Societa delle Fucine
S.p.A., a steel company based in Terni in central Italy and
owned by the state-owned steel company Ilva S.p.A.. Ilva is
part of the state industrial conglomerate Istituto per la
Ricostruzione Industriale.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Societa delle Fucine said, "The indication
from the Iraqi ministry was that they were for a
petrochemical plant. It did not seem possible that they could
be used for any suspicious machinery."</p>
<p>Police said they haven't yet made any arrests.</p>
