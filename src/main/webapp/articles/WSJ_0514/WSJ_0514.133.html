	<p class="article-leader">Many insurers are beating a hasty retreat from the auto
insurance market. But their departure could leave the market
wide open for Progressive Corp.
   Based in Cleveland, this property/casualty insurer
specializes in providing what is delicately known as
"nonstandard" auto insurance. This isn't the coverage for the
people who drive once a week, to church on Sunday. This is
for motorists most insurers avoid -- the ones with traffic
violations, accidents, even drunk-driving convictions on
their records. It's a group that includes young drivers,
especially men in their 20s, and motorists who drive
expensive sports cars.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Major insurers such as Aetna Life & Casualty, Travelers,
Cigna, Xerox's Crum & Forster unit, and some regional
companies, are cutting back on the amount of auto insurance
they write or pulling out of the market altogether. With
their retreat, many drivers are left hunting for new
insurance carriers and so Progressive could end up taking on
a far better class of drivers, analysts say.</p>
<p>Investors haven't fully appreciated "the change in the
nonstandard market. When that happens, this company can grow
like a weed," says Michael Takata at UBS Securities.
Progressive certainly thrived in the mid-1980s when auto
insurers racked up losses and market capacity shrank, he
recalls; the company's premiums, per-share earnings, book
value and stock prices quadrupled.</p>
<p>Mr. Takata, who reiterated his buy recommendation on
Progressive recently, doesn't see the same degree of upside
potential this time. But "we could see a doubling of
(Progressive's) premiums and earnings," he says.</p>
<p>The stock, which closed Friday at 38 1/8, currently sells
for just over nine times Mr. Takata's 1990 earnings estimate
of $4 a share. With annual earnings potential of $6 to $8 a
share and an uptick in the price/earnings multiple to 10 over
the next two years, he says, Progressive "would be a
$60-to-$80 stock. This is one of the few great growth stocks
in the insurance industry."</p>
<p>Gerald Lewinsohn at Merrill Lynch says: "Anytime you can
buy a stock with (Progressive's earnings) record and rate of
return, and selling for a low P/E, it's a bargain."</p>
<p>Insurers generally have lost money writing auto insurance
in the past decade, even though they tend to insure only what
they consider the safest drivers. At Progressive, though, net
income has grown at nearly a 15% average rate as return on
equity averaged 25.3% annually in the past 10 years -- nearly
12 points above the return of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock
index.</p>
<p>Progressive's first-quarter earnings report, released last
month, turned heads on Wall Street. Per-share earnings of
$1.01 far exceeded analysts' expectations of 75 cents to 80
cents. (Many firms stopped following the stock closely when
the company discontinued analyst meetings in late 1988.)</p>
<p>Tom Sargent at Conning & Co. has been telling clients "it
makes sense to be buying the stock now." Although the stock
has appreciated some 48% in the past 15 months, the departure
of some insurers from the market presents tremendous
potential for the company, the stock's admirers say. William
Bitterli at Northington Partners believes the shares could
sell at 50 by year end.</p>
<p>Since the late 1950s Progressive has collected a huge
amount of data on high-risk drivers. It "cherry-picks among
the bad risks," one analyst says. For example, when
Progressive learned that older, married motorcyclists are
better risks than most riders of big motorcycles, it
benefited by charging them less than rivals did.</p>
<p>In California, where Progressive had more than 20% of its
business, the company has adopted an extremely conservative
strategy. It set aside $34 million last year and $13.9
million in the first quarter as reserves for possible premium
refunds that might be ordered under California's auto
insurance initiative, Proposition 103. The company has also
been reducing its business in the state as much as the
current insurance laws allow. Northington's Mr. Bitterli
believes these reserves aren't likely to be needed and could
be released into future earnings.</p>
<p>Progessive's long-haul trucking insurance unit, which had
a loss in 1988 after a quick start two years earlier, is
thought by analysts to have broken even in this year's first
quarter after a restructuring last year. Progressive, which
took a big hit in the 1987 market crash, today has a $2
billion portfolio that is invested largely in short-term,
high-grade securities including some adjustable-rate bonds.
Only about $240 million is in the stock market.</p>
