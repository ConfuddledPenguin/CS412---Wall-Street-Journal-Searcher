	<p class="article-leader">If you haven't seen enough of Donald Trump's name lately,
just wait: Coming soon are Trump desk blotters, Trump
briefcases, Trump pens and Trump wallets. And one day,
perhaps, Trump tuxedos.
   The developer, whose name already adorns an airline, three
Atlantic City, N.J., casinos and other properties, is joining
the ranks of celebrity athletes and fashion designers who
license their names to manufacturers in exchange for
royalties of between 5% and 10% of sales.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Donald Trump represents the entrepreneurial power in all
of us," says Robert A. Stone, vice president for licensing at
International Management Group, a New York marketing concern
that approached Mr. Trump with the idea six months ago. "Why
not come out with a line of products that represents that?"</p>
<p>After turning down earlier requests and fighting some
product makers, who he claimed had misappropriated his name,
Mr. Trump says he finally agreed to market his moniker
because "it won't be time consuming" and because "what we've
put our name on has been successful." He donated proceeds
from both his best-selling book and a board game that bears
his name to charity, and says he intends to do the same with
income from the licensing effort.</p>
<p>"It's a lot of money that's going to go to charity," he
says. "In that sense, I felt an obligation to do it."</p>
<p>To avoid diluting the value of Mr. Trump's name, Mr. Stone
says he is negotiating only with makers of "upscale quality
merchandise," limited for now to leather goods and desk
accessories -- including pencil cups, picture frames and
blotters -- "that represent business and the Wall Street
tycoon." After the first products debut this Christmas, Mr.
Stone says, licenses may be granted to makers of tuxedos and
other apparel.</p>
<p>One company anticipating a bonanza is Diplomat Pen Co. of
Stuttgard, West Germany, which plans to launch three Trump
pen brands next January. "Our early projections for year one
are in excess of $5 million," says Frank Salacuse, who heads
Diplomat's U.S. operations. Topping the line: the Trump
"Signature Collection." Only 200 of the solid gold pens will
be produced, Mr. Salacuse says: 100 fountain pen versions and
100 ball points. The price: $10,000.</p>
<p>Not content to do anything in a small way, Mr. Trump also
is starting a program to license the name of his Plaza Hotel
to makers of china, crystal, wall coverings, sheets, towels,
pillow cases, furniture and "very expensive throw rugs," Mr.
Stone says.</p>
<p>But there are limits, Mr. Stone insists. "We're not going
to do mugs," he says. "That's not what Donald's about."</p>
