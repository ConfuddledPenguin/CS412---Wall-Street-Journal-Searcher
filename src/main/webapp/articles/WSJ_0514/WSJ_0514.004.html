	<p class="article-leader">The Robert Mapplethorpe brouhaha has rapidly degenerated
into caricature. Flying the flag of truth, beauty and the
First Amendment is the culture establishment, righteously
striving "to save the atmosphere for creative freedom of
artists," in Congressman Pat Williams's (D., Mont.) words.
The barbarians at the gate are a motley crew of right-wing
philistines and homophobes, faces plastered with unctuous
censor's smiles.
   How depressingly incomplete this picture is.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>You'd never know it from watching CSPAN, but there are
actually writers and artists in the American heartland who
want nothing to do with the National Endowment for the Arts.
We think that government subsidy is corrupting and crippling,
suitable only for fat and happy eunuchs. Our creed was best
expressed by Oxford, Miss.'s native son, William Faulkner,
who said, "The writer doesn't need economic freedom. All he
needs is a pencil and paper. I've never known anything good
in writing to come from having accepted any free gift of
money. The good writer never applies to a foundation. He's
too busy writing something."</p>
<p>Faulkner's disdain for grant-grubbing is echoed by many of
our finest contemporary writers, from Gore Vidal to the late
great desert maverick Edward Abbey. The NEA's chosen few are
made docile by the dole; Beat impresario Lawrence
Ferlinghetti scorns them as "cooperating poets and
publishers."</p>
<p>Is it then the artist's lot to starve and scrape, to eat
rice and home-baked bread and scribble feverishly in the
darkest hours? Yes] Comforted, coddled, cossetted artists
create mediocre art. That's their right, of course, but why
should the taxpayer get stuck with the bill?</p>
<p>Can anyone name one major piece of American fiction that
would not have been written without the NEA's beneficence?
How about a significant minor work?</p>
<p>Moreover, NEA grants are not "free." Uncle Sam is like any
other sugar daddy: he's got a generous touch, but sooner or
later he's gonna demand service. Andres Serrano, photographer
of the ineffable "Piss Christ," should have thought about the
dangers of subsidy before he cashed that $15,000 check.</p>
<p>How dismaying it is to watch novelists and poets troop
before television cameras and beg for taxpayer dollars with
all the dignity of defense contractors. I expect that of the
arts bureaucrats, who are, after all, merely trying to save
their jobs. But what in hell are Garrison Keillor and Larry
McMurtry doing at the microphones? Since when did pork barrel
for the hyper-literate become a matter of principle?</p>
<p>Sen. Jesse Helms (R., N.C.) and Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R.,
Calif.) could have enlisted a fair-sized contingent of
writers and artists to support their battle against the NEA.
Alas, they wound up making all the wrong arguments. They
dragged that old bugbear homosexuality out of the closet for
yet another public flogging. They spoke fatuously of art that
"glorifies" America: not the real America, which Whitman
rhapsodized in his (unsubsidized) "Leaves of Grass," but a
"Top Gun" America, an aseptic place agleam with military
hardware.</p>
<p>This may shock Mr. Helms and Mr. Rohrabacher, but America
has a rich literary tradition, predating even Tom Clancy. The
two great flowerings of our national letters, in the 1850s
and 1920s, occurred without any help from a ministry of
culture. Whitman, Thoreau, Poe, Melville, Stowe, Hawthorne .
. . not an NEA grantee in the bunch. Their grey eminence,
Ralph Waldo Emerson, spoke to them and to writers unborn: "If
you would learn to write, `tis in the street you must learn
it. . . . The people, and not the college, is the writer's
home."</p>
<p>And poverty is the writer's lot. (Until the mortgage
becomes just too scary, and our noble young novelist slinks
off to Hollywood, and the sun rather quickly sets.)</p>
<p>If Thoreau can write "Walden" and Melville can produce
"Moby Dick" without Uncle Sam's patronage, then surely Robert
Mapplethorpe's claque can express themselves without a
government handout. Better to be poor and free than in the
culture establishment's hip pocket.</p>
