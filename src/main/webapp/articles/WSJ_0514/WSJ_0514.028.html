	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Attorney General Dick Thornburgh suffered
another public embarrassment when a senior Justice Department
official resigned two weeks after he was forced to rescind
his endorsement of tougher sentencing guidelines for
corporate crime.
   The departure of Donald Ayer, the deputy attorney general,
reflects continued resentment within the Justice Department
of Mr. Thornburgh's heavy reliance on a small group of
longtime personal aides. The resignation, effective May 25,
also adds to a string of high-visibility setbacks for the
attorney general, who as a two-term governor of Pennsylvania
had been widely hailed as a savvy politician and manager.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The White House nominated William Barr, an assistant
attorney general, to succeed Mr. Ayer. The selection requires
Senate approval.</p>
<p>In a statement released Friday, Mr. Ayer said he had
decided to return to his partnership in the Washington, D.C.,
office of a large Cleveland law firm, Jones, Day, Reavis &
Pogue. In a letter, Mr. Thornburgh praised Mr. Ayer's
"valuable contributions" during his six months in office.</p>
<p>But the bland public exchange only thinly veiled the
underlying tension over Mr. Thornburgh's management style.
Mr. Ayer is known to have been unhappy that despite his
formal designation as the attorney general's top deputy, he
was in fact outranked by a handful of Mr. Thornburgh's
personal assistants from the Harrisburg, Pa., statehouse.</p>
<p>The three most prominent Thornburgh assistants -- Robert
Ross, David Runkel and Murray Dickman -- have been the
targets of persistent criticism from some current and former
Justice Department employees, who complain that the
Thornburgh team lacks the experience to lead the
75,000-person agency.</p>
<p>Mr. Ayer, 41 years old, couldn't be reached for comment. A
conservative former law clerk to Chief Justice William
Rehnquist, he previously served as the Justice Department's
deputy solicitor general and as U.S. attorney in Sacramento,
Calif. Mr. Ayer's chief assistant, Peter Nowinski, also quit.</p>
<p>Mr. Thornburgh instructed his senior staff not to discuss
the Ayer resignation, according to one aide. An
administration official familiar with the matter called it
"an unfortunate situation" and "just one of those things that
didn't work out."</p>
<p>Specifically, the attorney general is said to have been
disappointed by Mr. Ayer's execution of several assignments
that resulted in public criticism of the Justice Department.</p>
<p>Chief among these was Mr. Ayer's written endorsement in
February of tougher federal sentencing guidelines for
corporate crimes. After big business lobbyists complained to
the White House and President Bush's counsel indicated
concern, the attorney general ordered Mr. Ayer to rescind the
endorsement, pending further review. When the decision to
back off from the tougher sentencing guidelines became the
subject of politically embarrassing news reports, Thornburgh
aides blamed Mr. Ayer for acting without approval from his
boss.</p>
<p>In earlier public missteps, Mr. Thornburgh saw his initial
choice for the deputy attorney general's job shot down by
Senate conservatives and his recommendation for civil rights
chief rejected by Senate liberals.</p>
<p>Mr. Barr, the nominee to replace Mr. Ayer, has made a name
for himself as the author of controversial legal opinions
authorizing U.S. agents to snatch fugitives abroad without
the approval of foreign governments, and justifying the use
of U.S. military forces to conduct American law-enforcement
missions in other countries. The White House named Mr. Barr's
top assistant, Michael Luttig, to succeed him as assistant
attorney general in charge of the Office of Legal Counsel.</p>
<p>Separately, the White House named Robert Bonner, a federal
trial judge in Los Angeles, to succeed John Lawn as chief of
the Drug Enforcement Administration, a branch of the Justice
Department.</p>
