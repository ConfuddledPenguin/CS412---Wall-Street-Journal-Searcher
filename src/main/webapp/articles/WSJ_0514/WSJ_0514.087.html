	<p class="article-leader">One of the more diverting features in Mad magazine is "Spy
vs. Spy," a comic strip in which two sneaky, beak-faced
characters carry out absurdly spectacular plots against each
other. Whenever one spy seems close to victory, the other
pulls off an outrageous reversal, and the contest begins all
over again. Add that these two tricksters are decked out in
black and white, and "Spy vs. Spy" begins to resemble racial
politics in New York City.
   The same point is made, without humor, by "Seven Days in
Bensonhurst," this week's "Frontline" presentation (airing
tomorrow, May 15, 10-11 p.m. EDT, on PBS; check local
listings). Narrated by Shelby Steele, an associate professor
of English at San Jose State University in California, the
film shows how the murder of a black youth named Yusuf
Hawkins in a predominantly Italian section of Brooklyn in
August became a media circus and a political sideshow.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In many ways, Mr. Steele is the ideal correspondent for
the topic. In his essays (soon to be published by St.
Martin's Press), he painstakingly dissects the stratagems by
which blacks and whites vie for power by asserting their own
group's innocence against the other's guilt. The best thing
about his dissecting blade is that it cuts both ways -- at
those who blame white racism for all the problems of blacks
and at those who pretend that white racism is just a
self-serving figment of black imagination.</p>
<p>It's an approach well-suited to the Bensonhurst hoopla,
which consisted largely of New Yorkers screaming at TV
cameras about the defenselessness of their own race against
the depredations of the other. Because the victim in this
case was black, it's hardly surprising that the film focuses
on the uses -- and abuses -- to which black victimization can
be put. It begins with the grief of Mr. Hawkins's father,
Moses Stewart, then tells how the media besieged Mr. Stewart,
in part because the murder occurred during a racially charged
mayoral campaign. Then it shows how Mr. Stewart summoned the
aid of an expert.</p>
<p>Enter the Rev. Al Sharpton, a man who can turn victims
into martyrs even when, as in the Tawana Brawley case, they
weren't victims to start with. The Rev. Sharpton explains
that he led several marches through Bensonhurst after the
murder to "clarify whether it was a racial attack or not."
Yet it seems that his real intention was to get his rotund
self photographed blowing kisses at the angry white mob at
the marches. "My greatest friends," he smiles, and he's not
joking. Without those hysterical whites, he would never be
able to support his publicity habit.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, back in the East New York of Brooklyn where Mr.
Hawkins lived, we see the politicians -- David Dinkins, Jesse
Jackson, Ed Koch -- taking their star turns before the
camera. Not all of these performances succeed, as former
Mayor Koch realized when his limousine got christened with
hostile bottles. Finally, when civil rights veteran Roy Innis
arrived in Bensonhurst with Morton Downey Jr., the pastor of
St. Dominic's Catholic Church declares: "This is the moment
that Yusuf Hawkins ceased to be an individual . . . because
the ground that was hallowed by his blood became a circus
ground."</p>
<p>In my opinion, Mr. Downey was merely the last clown in a
parade that began with the Rev. Sharpton. But regardless of
where we draw the line, the film's point comes across loud
and clear: It is all too easy for an event like young Mr.
Hawkins's murder to become, in Mr. Steele's words, "a stage
on which players of both races quickly began to jockey for
position." Before we know it, the legitimate anger of a Moses
Stewart becomes the farcical posturing of an Al Sharpton.</p>
<p>Now the question is, if Mr. Steele's blade cuts both ways,
how well does it dissect Bensonhurst? Behind the hysteria
that greeted the Rev. Sharpton's marches, was there any
emotion that could be construed as legitimate? Mr. Steele
notes that the rest of white New York scrupulously distanced
itself from the ugly passions of Bensonhurst. But what about
his own reaction? Shortly after some footage of an angry
woman yelling that all the Rev. Sharpton wants is "free
media," Mr. Steele's comment is: "This kind of racism speaks
for itself."</p>
<p>I disagree. The kind of racism found in places like
Bensonhurst -- and it is undeniably racism -- isn't simply an
offshoot of the native American strain. To explain how
immigrants and the descendants of immigrants could arrive at
such hateful attitudes, Mr. Steele resorts to an old saying
from his boyhood in a black community near Chicago. White
immigrants, he remarks, learn to use the word "nigger" as "a
means to power, a short cut to the American dream."</p>
<p>Like all old sayings, this sounds plausible enough. But so
does this bit of Italian folk wisdom heard in Brooklyn by
sociologist Jonathan Rieder: "All those whites who beat {the
blacks} and whipped them, are we responsible for it? I didn't
have anything to do with slavery." To this lack of guilt, add
the fact that countless ethnic Brooklynites have seen their
beloved old neighborhoods wrecked by what journalist Joe
Klein calls "the social anarchy that has taken over the black
underclass," and you have a recipe for unapologetic hatred.</p>
<p>This hatred stymied "Frontline's" attempts to talk with
Bensonhurst residents. As Mr. Steele told me, "The place was
locked down." Yet the producers did tape a lengthy interview
with two former Brooklynites, Mr. and Mrs. Phil Scaduto, who
now live on Long Island. In Mr. Steele's view, "The Scadutos
gave the best explanation of what Bensonhurst is like" -- an
earnest account of the unpleasant and frightening experiences
that caused them to flee a neighborhood that was turning
black.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this whole testimony was edited out. Mr.
Steele explained that he and his colleagues felt that the
Scadutos's story was good "background," but not relevant to
the film's focus on "the posturing that filled the power
vacuum created by Hawkins's death." But if the subject is how
street-level tragedy gets transformed into media-level
melodrama, then what could be more relevant than evidence
that murderers and mobs don't represent all of Bensonhurst,
any more than muggers and demagogues represent all of East
New York?</p>
<p>The Scadutos's testimony is also relevant because it
refutes the pernicious but popular notion that civil
expressions of group antagonism are essentially no different
from crude ones. Too often, on our campuses and elsewhere,
legitimate grievances and honest disagreements are seen as
worse than racial epithets because they are more "subtle."
The result is another vacuum, filled with posturing,
ignorance and hate. How about focusing a "Frontline" on that?</p>
