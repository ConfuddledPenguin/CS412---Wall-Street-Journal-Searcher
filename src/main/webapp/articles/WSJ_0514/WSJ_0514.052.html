	<p class="article-leader">Prime Motor Inns Inc., pressured by a soft hotel and real
estate market and a hefty debt load, agreed to sell a 65%
stake in two franchise systems to an investment partnership
for cash and notes totaling about $200 million.
   The announcement Friday -- that Prime agreed to sell a
majority stake in its Howard Johnson and Ramada franchise
systems to Blackstone Capital Partners L.P. -- inspired
another potential bidder, Prime rival Manor Care Inc., to
emerge. But although Silver Spring, Md.-based Manor Care,
which franchises Quality Inns, indicated its interest in
buying the Prime franchises, it didn't make a formal offer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The accord calls for the companies to form a joint venture
to run the 490 Ramada locations and the 430 Howard Johnson
locations; Blackstone, an affiliate of Blackstone Group, an
investment banking boutique, would manage the venture. Prime
Chairman Peter E. Simon said the arrangement would enable
Prime to "maintain a significant stake in the future earnings
potential" of the franchises and allow Prime to focus on
growth in specific market niches: economy and limited-service
hotels.</p>
<p>Fairfield, N.J.-based Prime, one of the largest U.S. hotel
companies, will retain its AmeriSuites and Wellesley Inns
chains and the Rodeway Inns franchise system. There are about
1,100 properties with 150,000 rooms in all its chains,
including Howard Johnson and Ramada.</p>
<p>Mr. Simon also said the accord "underscores" Prime's
long-term strategy "to streamline and strengthen" its balance
sheet. Prime recently reported a 98% plunge in profit -- to
$209,000, or one cent a share -- for the third quarter ended
March 31.</p>
<p>Prime's stock has been hammered in recent weeks by what
analysts call Wall Street's loss of confidence in Prime's
ability to expand its business in the current market. The
stock, which traded as high as $23.75 in January, closed
Friday at $10.375, up 37.5 cents in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading.</p>
<p>Late last month, Standard & Poor's Corp. placed Prime's
double-B-plus subordinated debt on its CreditWatch list for
possible downgrade, affecting about $230 million in long-term
debt.</p>
<p>The rating concern said Friday that the transaction would
help to "significantly reduce" Prime's bank debt and improve
liquidity short term. But S&P is keeping Prime on CreditWatch
because, it said, Prime would be "parting with the bulk of a
stable source of revenues from the franchise system while
increasing reliance" on lesser-known businesses.</p>
<p>Aside from the $140 million in cash and about $60 million
in notes an alliance with Blackstone would bring, Prime might
benefit in other ways from teaming up with the investment
firm. Blackstone's management team will include Henry R.
Silverman, the firm's general partner and former chairman and
chief executive officer of Days Inns of America Inc. "The
team that Mr. Silverman assembled at Days Inns is understood
to be the most successful" at franchising, said Joseph P.
Gaynor III, senior vice president of corporate finance at
Prime.</p>
<p>While Mr. Silverman acknowledged that the hotel market is
overbuilt, he said he plans to actively recruit independent
hotel owners to link up with the franchise system.</p>
<p>The Howard Johnson and Ramada franchise system will grow
"much faster and will be much more valuable" under Mr.
Silverman's management, said Michael Mueller, an analyst with
Montgomery Securities, San Francisco, who recently changed
his recommendation on Prime to a buy from a hold.</p>
<p>Mr. Mueller said the agreement "eliminates liquidity
concerns" about Prime. Mr. Gaynor said Prime has paid down
about $40 million on the about $320 million of bank debt
Prime has coming due next year. He said that Prime would use
proceeds from the Blackstone accord to pay half the remaining
$280 million and that Prime's goal is to pay the bank debt by
the end of this year through some financing and some asset
sales.</p>
<p>Prime's expansion last year came during a time when
financing for such projects were increasingly scarce and the
real estate industry was softening.</p>
<p>Last year, Prime loaned FCD Hospitality Inc. money so FCD
could purchase Servico, an operator of 45 hotels, from the
Southmark Corp. Today Prime has received only a nominal
payment on the loan and is still owed roughly $200 million,
Mr. Gaynor said.</p>
<p>Also last year, Prime took on even more debt to buy the
Ramada's U.S. franchise operation. Meanwhile the company has
a more than $200 million construction program underway to
develop roughly 25 new properties by end of 1990.</p>
<p>Mr. Mueller noted that Days Inns President Michael Levin
resigned recently, and he speculated that Mr. Levin might
join Blackstone's management team. Mr. Silverman said it was
too early to speculate about management. Blackstone's accord
is subject to financing and regulatory approval.</p>
