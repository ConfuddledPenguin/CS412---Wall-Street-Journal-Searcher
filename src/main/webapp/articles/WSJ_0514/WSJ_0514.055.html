	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Horsham Corp. said its president and chief
operating officer, Jeremy Garbutt, has been named to the
additional positions of president and chief operating officer
of 60%-owned Clark Oil & Refining Corp., St. Louis.
   Horsham, a Toronto investment concern, said the
appointment followed the resignation from Clark Oil of its
chairman and chief executive officer, Ralph Cunningham, who
will leave Aug. 31 to become president of Texaco Chemical
Co., a division of Texaco Inc.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Garbutt said Clark Oil will seek a replacement for Mr.
Cunningham, but the exact title of the new position hasn't
been decided. In the meantime, Mr. Garbutt said he plans to
spend at least the next six months in St. Louis getting to
know the Clark Oil business and providing for a smooth
management changeover.</p>
<p>Mr. Garbutt moved to Horsham last month from mining
company affiliate, American Barrick Resources Corp., where he
was chief financial officer. Since then, Horsham has said
that it intends to take a more active role in running Clark
Oil and that it will exercise an option to increase its stake
in the subsidiary to 75% later this year.</p>
<p>Mr. Garbutt said he would have preferred Mr. Cunningham to
have remained at Clark Oil. "He got head-hunted away," a
Horsham spokeswoman said.</p>
