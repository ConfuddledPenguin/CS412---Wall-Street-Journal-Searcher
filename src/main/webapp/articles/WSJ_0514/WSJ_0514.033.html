	<p class="article-leader">Your April 5 article on the Hubble space telescope
memorialized yet another icon of inefficient resource
allocation by "governmental science." Governments embrace
science and exploration for nationalistic reasons, not for
science and not for politics as implied.
   America cannot afford the maintenance of antiquated ideas
-- like the space shuttle. For all its advanced engineering
it easily can be replaced by something more efficient.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>So, too, America cannot afford the muddle of bureaucracy
in future science projects such as Hubble. The pictures
Hubble will send back to Earth are sure to be spectacular and
likely will rekindle voter support for space exploration, no
matter how dear the cost and how fruitless the effort. In the
long run, Hubble may turn out to be more nationalistic than
scientific.</p>
<p>The European Space Agency currently maintains an orbiting
non-optical telescope that is much cheaper, more practical
and purely scientific. However, this telescope does not send
back pretty pictures, just data -- the stuff of which science
is made.</p>
