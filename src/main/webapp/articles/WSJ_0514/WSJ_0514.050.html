	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Standard & Poor's Corp. said it affirmed
Sotheby's Inc.'s A-1 commercial paper rating and removed it
from CreditWatch, where it was placed April 26 with negative
implications.
   The review was prompted by the company's planned $142.8
million acquisition of the extensive art inventory of the
Pierre Matisse Gallery.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>S&P had said the move exposed the Sotheby's Holdings Inc.
unit to a "somewhat higher business risk because it more
directly exposes the company to future art price volatility."</p>
<p>But S&P now has concluded that "the impact of this
transaction is not significant enough to warrant a downgrade.
Given Sotheby's strong earnings and cash flow, S&P believes
that lower financial leverage will be quickly restored."</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
Sotheby's Holdings closed at $17.50 a share, up 50 cents.</p>
