	<p class="article-leader">KINGSVILLE, Texas -- President Bush set a goal of putting
an American on Mars in 30 years.
   Mr. Bush had previously endorsed a manned mission to Mars,
but hadn't embraced the goal of accomplishing the job in 30
years. Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration already had been discussing a timetable of
roughly 30 years, however.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Bush, who is busy trying to begin negotiations with
Congress to cut the federal budget deficit, didn't say how
much he thinks it will cost to reach Mars in that time.</p>
<p>The president declared his goal in a commencement address
here at Texas A&M University. Noting that 20 years have
passed since the first Apollo mission to the moon, Mr. Bush
declared: "Thirty years from now I believe man will stand on
another planet. . . . I believe that before Apollo celebrates
the 50th anniversary of its landing on the moon, the American
flag should be planted on Mars."</p>
