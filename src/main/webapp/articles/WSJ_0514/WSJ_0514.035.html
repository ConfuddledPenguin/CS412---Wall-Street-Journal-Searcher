	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A U.S. health agency has recommended the
Pfizer drug fluconazole be used as maintenance therapy
against an AIDS-related meningitis.
   A clinical trial by the National Instititute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a unit of the National
Institutes of Health, showed that the drug is "at least as
effective and possibly superior to the standard treatment" in
preventing recurrences of cryptococcal meningitis, a
life-threatening infection of the brain and nervous system.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The trial compared fluconazole with amphotericin B, the
standard treatment, to determine which drug worked better to
prevent recurrences. All patients had first been treated with
amphotericin B for the acute phase of the infection.</p>
<p>Patients with immune deficiency who have suffered from
this form of meningitis require lifetime maintenance therapy
to prevent recurrences. Based on preliminary results, NIAID
said it recommends that fluconazole replace amphotericin B
for this follow-up treatment.</p>
<p>Amphotericin B is a drug that must be given intravenously;
it causes fever, nausea and more serious adverse reactions,
including kidney damage and bone marrow suppression.
Fluconazole, which is taken by mouth, can cause skin rash,
nausea and rare instances of liver damage. However, it is
generally considered to be a less toxic drug, based upon the
NIAID study.</p>
<p>Louis Sullivan, secretary of Health and Human Services,
said, "These study results provide promising evidence of
fluconazole's efficacy and relative lack of toxicity in this
patient population. This is indeed good news."</p>
