	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- Bank of New England Corp. said its chief
financial officer, David B. Payne, will take early retirement
in July.
   Mr. Payne, 54 years old, is also an executive vice
president of the bank holding company, which hasn't yet named
a successor to him. Mr. Payne, who was named chief financial
officer last year, was formerly president of the concern's
Connecticut Bank & Trust unit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Payne said he decided to take early retirement because
"my family is still in Hartford, and I feel it's time to go
back and join them. I always considered (the role of chief
financial officer) a short-term appointment."</p>
<p>Bank of New England, hard hit by bad real estate loans,
has undergone a series of top management changes during the
past few months as federal bank regulators have worked to
rectify its problems.</p>
