	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- Turner Broadcasting System Inc. reported
first-quarter net income, compared with a loss the previous
year, and a 25% revenue surge, reflecting its continued
investment in building its networks.
   The cable programmer said it had quarterly net of $4.3
million, including a $3.9 million tax gain, compared with a
loss of $421,000 a year earlier. But on a per-share basis,
Turner reported a first-quarter loss of 15 cents a share,
reflecting accretion of preferred stock dividends, compared
with a loss of 25 cents a share a year earlier, which also
reflected the preferred stock dividends.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Turner's revenue jumped to $290.8 million in the period
from $232 million a year earlier. Its operating profit was
flat at $52 million, reflecting the company's increased
investments in news and entertainment programming, including
the founding of an investigative-reporting unit for Cable
News Network and original dramatic programming for Turner
Network Television.</p>
<p>Turner said it took a pretax charge in the period of $3
million from anticipated losses on this summer's Goodwill
Games in Seattle, bringing its total charges from the Games
to $13 million. It added that it recorded a one-time, $3
million gain in the quarter from its Atlanta Hawks basketball
team's share of expansion fees from the National Basketball
Association.</p>
<p>In American Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
Turner's Class A shares closed at $44.375 each, up 37.5
cents.</p>
