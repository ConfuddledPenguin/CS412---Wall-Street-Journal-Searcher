	<p class="article-leader">ImmunoGen Inc. said it signed an agreement with Takeda
Chemical Industries Ltd. of Japan that will enable ImmunoGen
to develop Takeda's maytansine experimental anti-cancer drug.
   Under the agreement, the Cambridge, Mass.-based
biotechnology concern has an option to exclusively license
the drug from Takeda. In exchange, Takeda has an option to
market in Asia therapeutics that were developed by ImmunoGen
based on the drug.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>ImmunoGen, a biotechnology concern, said the drug has
proved too toxic to use alone, but may work when combined
with ImmunoGen's monoclonal antibodies, which would guide it
to tumor cells, sparing other cells.</p>
