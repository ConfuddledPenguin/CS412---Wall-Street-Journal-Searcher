	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Despite Moscow's grumbling about reunifying
Germany, there are signs of a budding Soviet-German concord
in the wind.
   U.S. officials privately predict that the emerging
economic ties between the two countries will temper Soviet
opposition to German unification. But the Soviet Union and
Germany also are finding common ground on political and
strategic issues -- a development that could threaten
Washington's hopes of keeping Germany firmly in the Western
orbit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The potential bond between Europe's two strongest powers
is likely to be built on an economic foundation. "The Soviets
need Germany economically," said one top Bush administration
policy-maker, who reviewed the recent opening round of
six-power talks on German unification.</p>
<p>"They depended on East Germany for so much," he said, "and
they're going to need united Germany to continue that trade.
Plus they need new investment from Germany. So they're not
likely to want to be viewed as the only power blocking German
unification."</p>
<p>Others agree. "The Soviet Union's largest East European
trading partner is East Germany, its largest Western trading
partner is West Germany," says Charles Gati, a specialist on
Soviet-East European affairs at Union College and author of a
new book on the subject. "So you can just imagine the
economic stakes the Soviet Union has with the new Germany."</p>
<p>Adds former State Department official Robert Hormats, now
with Goldman, Sachs & Co., "The economic relationship with
Germany is Gorbachev's ace in the hole. In the final unity
deal, he can extract economic concessions from the Germans."</p>
<p>Signs of such a potential trade-off were sprinkled through
an otherwise negative Soviet performance at the unity talks,
which are formally called the "Two-Plus-Four" negotiations.
Shortly before laying down strong private objections to
German membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
and making other demands, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze held a long, cordial meeting with West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl to discuss bilateral relations,
including economic ties.</p>
<p>Mr. Shevardnadze said he and Mr. Kohl had "noted that the
potential for cooperation between our two countries is as yet
not fully exhausted. There are great reserves. There's a
great deal yet to be done, and we discussed ways of making
use of, of drawing on those reserves."</p>
<p>The Soviet foreign minister also refused to restate on
West German television the strong Soviet objections to German
membership in NATO, saying only that he was optimistic a
settlement could be reached. His aides distributed his tough
remarks, including a refusal to grant the new Germany full
sovereignty, only to Soviet and East German reporters.</p>
<p>Mr. Kohl has pledged that the new Germany will honor
existing trade and contract commitments between the Soviets
and East Germany, a costly proposition for Germany, because
it could require maintaining production of some items to meet
Soviet specifications, even though they can't be sold in the
West.</p>
<p>Last year in Bonn, Mr. Kohl and Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev signed a "comprehensive economic collaboration"
stepping up trade and investment. An investment treaty has
been signed, Soviet executives are being trained in West
Germany, and German banks have set up a $1 billion credit
line for Soviet trade.</p>
<p>"The Soviets realize that the united Germany has a growth
potential from which they can profit if they reform their
economy," says a German diplomat. "We've made that very clear
to them."</p>
<p>But money, important as it is to the near-bankrupt
U.S.S.R., isn't the only tie that binds the two European
powers. Aware of Soviet security fears, German officials have
won U.S. support for a plan to keep NATO forces out of former
East German territory after unification. They have invited
the Red Army to remain in East German territory during a
transition period that could last seven years. The new
Germany will even pay for the troops.</p>
<p>Most importantly, there is broad agreement between German
and Soviet leaders on the desirability of establishing some
new, vaguely defined Pan-European security system under the
auspices of the existing Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe.</p>
<p>This idea, which makes U.S. officials nervous, has wide
popular appeal and is embraced to varying degrees by all
political parties in both Germanys. So far, German leaders
insist the new system would complement, not replace, NATO.
But the Soviet strategy is to build on this romantic German
notion of a Pan-European security system and eventually drive
NATO out of business by replacing it with the new security
system.</p>
<p>And despite the bitter legacy of World War II, there are
historic precedents for Russian-German cooperation. "When
they weren't fighting each other, the Russians have used the
Germans as advisers for years," says Mr. Hormats. "For
centuries, there has been a love-hate relationship between
Russia and Germany."</p>
