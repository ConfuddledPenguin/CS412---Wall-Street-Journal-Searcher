	<p class="article-leader">AMSTERDAM -- Heineken Nederland B.V. and Grolsch
Bierbrouwerij N.V., two Dutch beer brewers, have embarked on
a process of advertising agency musical chairs in an effort
to separate themselves from each other.
   The ad agency war began earlier in the year when Heineken
switched from using a number of local agencies to represent
its European accounts to consolidating all of them with the
London office of J. Walter Thompson.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>However, Grolsch had been using the Amsterdam-based office
of J. Walter Thompson, known as PPTH-JWT, to represent it in
the Netherlands. In response, the company has announced that
it has dropped PPTH-JWT in favor of FHV/ BBDO, the
Netherlands subsidiary of BBDO.</p>
<p>"Heineken chose J. Walter Thompson for the whole of
Europe, so we had to seek another agency," said a spokesman
for Grolsch.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, FHV-BBDO also represented Heineken's Amstel
brand of beer. Heineken retaliated by pulling its Amstel
account from FHV-BBDO and placing the account with the Dutch
subsidiary of Young & Rubicam, known as PMSWY&R.</p>
<p>"The announced cooperation between FHV-BBDO and Grolsch
came as a surprise to Heineken Nederland," Heineken said in a
statement.</p>
<p>Heineken said that it regretted FHV-BBDO's decision, but
noted, "PMS-WY&R could be appointed without any hesitation."</p>
