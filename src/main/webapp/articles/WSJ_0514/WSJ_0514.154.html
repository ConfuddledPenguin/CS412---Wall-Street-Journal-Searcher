	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- U.S. auto makers are planning sizable
production increases for the third quarter, reflecting
forecasts of stronger buyer demand and fears of a labor
strike in September.
   Individuals in the industry say U.S. auto makers are
planning to build more than 1.5 million cars in the third
quarter, up 11% from last year. The individuals say the auto
makers also intend to increase truck production by 6%, to
887,009 vehicles, during that period.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the 10 companies that build cars in the U.S. aren't
throwing caution to the wind. On Friday, Ford Motor Co. said
it will close its Chicago auto-assembly plant for one week
beginning today because of a shortage of dealer orders.</p>
<p>Although inventories of the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable
models built there are slightly below normal, Ford said it
intends to be cautious regarding vehicle inventories in light
of sluggish spring sales. In all, the company has cut
second-quarter car production by 25,000 vehicles during the
past month.</p>
<p>Overall, auto makers are planning to build nearly 1.8
million cars in the second quarter, down 9% from a year ago.
Production of trucks -- including vans -- is running about
even with last year.</p>
<p>Although second-quarter production trails that of last
year, it is far better than the first quarter, when auto
makers built 21% fewer cars and trucks than in 1989. Analysts
say the more ambitious production plans for the second and
third quarters, combined with lower consumer incentives, will
help the Big Three auto makers record profits better than in
their dismal first quarter.</p>
<p>"Despite a horrible first quarter of earnings, the outlook
of the Big Three is fairly positive for the rest of the
year," says John Casesa, an analyst with Wertheim Schroder &
Co.</p>
<p>Lower inventories have helped auto makers reduce the cash
back and financing incentives they offer to buyers. General
Motors Corp. and Ford have reduced their incentives by an
average of about $200 a vehicle during the past month,
according to Scott Merlis, an analyst with Morgan Stanley &
Co. Mr. Merlis says the auto makers can afford to reduce
incentives because inventory levels are modest. Ford, for
example, has a 61-day supply of cars and a 63-day supply of
trucks, both of which are normal.</p>
<p>Some car dealers say production cuts might have gone too
far. Steven Fish, general manager of Freeway Dodge in
Bloomington, Minn., said he has a pretty good stock of trucks
and vans but is low on Dodge Daytonas, Shadows, and Spirits.
"I'm supposed to have 20 or 30 of each but I only have two or
three of each," he said, noting that Chrysler Corp. has been
heavily advertising these models. "I could have sold more if
I had more."</p>
<p>While this accounts for part of the increase in
third-quarter production plans, there is another reason as
well. Auto makers may be stepping up production to hedge
against a possible strike in September, when their labor
contracts with the United Auto Workers union expires.</p>
<p>"You have to take into consideration dealing with the UAW
this fall," says Edward Sullivan, an analyst with WEFA Group,
in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. The big union represents some 450,000
workers, who could cripple production by any of the companies
they would choose to strike.</p>
<p>Currently, seven of the nine U.S. auto makers who were
building cars a year ago are planning production boosts in
the third quarter. Chrysler's production will be lower,
largely because it stopped building its Dodge Omni and
Plymouth Horizon subcompact cars last fall.</p>
<p>Nissan Motor Corp. will build fewer cars, but is
delegating more of its capacity to trucks in the third
quarter. Subaru-Isuzu Automotive Inc. wasn't building
vehicles a year ago.</p>
