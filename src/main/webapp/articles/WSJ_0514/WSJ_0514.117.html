	<p class="article-leader">Esselte Business Systems Inc., Garden City, N.Y., reported
first-quarter net income fell 28%, partly because of weak
demand for the company's retail supplies, equipment and
office supplies.
   Net dropped to $12.4 million, or 60 cents a share, from
$17.4 million, or 84 cents a share, a year earlier. Part of
the decline was caused by an increase in interest expense
from debt related to acquisitions. Sales rose 8.7% to $398.9
million from $367 million. Esselte attributed about one-third
of the sales growth to improving foreign-exchange rates.</p>
