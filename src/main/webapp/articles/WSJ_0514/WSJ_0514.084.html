	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- In the quarter century after World War II,
U.S. corporations were eager to grow, and grow fast. The
logical way to do that would have been to expand within their
own industries, through mergers, acquisitions or otherwise.
But tight antitrust enforcement was limiting mergers within
industries. In addition, many companies thought they saw
better profit opportunities outside their own bailiwicks.
   So companies decided to diversify. If a corporation
operated in a dozen industries, it might be big but it hardly
was monopolizing anything. Businessmen began to believe that
"management" was a discrete talent that could be applied to
almost anything.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Disillusionment soon began setting in, however.
Diversification now is going out of style, and the takeover
binge of recent years has accelerated the process. One
beneficiary, a new study suggests, has been U.S.
productivity.</p>
<p>It took a while for the bloom to leave the rose. Mergers
and acquisitions, as recorded by Moody's and Standard &
Poor's, reached a peak of 2,407 in 1968. The market continued
active into the early 1970s, but in 1975 there were only 439
transactions. Through most of this period, close to half of
all transactions involved conglomerates, collections of
largely unrelated businesses.</p>
<p>But corporate executives gradually were recognizing that
they had overestimated their management skills. Just because
a company was a whiz in the steel business didn't
automatically mean it could do wonders in chemicals. Many
acquisitions weren't nearly as profitable as companies had
expected, so the merger mania of the late 1960s and early
1970s was followed by an unprecedented wave of divestitures.</p>
<p>In 1965, according to one economist, there had been one
divestiture for each 11 mergers and acquisitions. From 1974
to 1977, there was one divestiture for each two mergers and
acquisitions.</p>
<p>But it took more time to de-diversify than it had to
diversify. One company's divestiture became another company's
acquisition and, with diversification sinking in popularity,
new marriages often were hard to arrange. Managements dragged
their feet, hating to admit mistakes or hoping they
eventually could make diversity work. To top things off,
interest rates soared in the late 1970s, making new deals
harder to plan and finance.</p>
<p>In 1980 there were still a lot of diversified companies,
and many of them had problems. In a National Bureau of
Economic Research working paper, Frank R. Lichtenberg
presented results of a study based on 17,000 plants in 1980.
He found that the greater the number of industries in which
the parent firm operated, the lower the productivity, and
thus the profitability, of the plants.</p>
<p>So companies still had business reasons to pare away
unrelated activities. New reasons appeared. The Reagan
administration relaxed antitrust enforcement, making it
easier for corporations to expand within their main lines of
business. Junk bonds helped to provide capital for takeover
artists. The takeover targets often were companies whose book
value exceeded their market value; this gave companies an
incentive to dump less-profitable activities.</p>
<p>By the 1980s the market usually was regarding
diversification as a mistake, whether it was or not. The
stocks of many firms were selling at "conglomerate discounts"
because investors knew, or thought they knew, that companies
found it difficult to manage unrelated activities. Getting
rid of the discounts, and thus reducing takeover
vulnerability, meant getting rid of the unrelated
subsidiaries.</p>
<p>When takeovers occurred anyway, the acquiring companies
often had to raise money to repay the funds borrowed to
finance the acquisitions. One way to do it was to divest the
unprofitable, unrelated subsidiaries. For these assorted
reasons, Mr. Lichtenberg found, the mean number of industries
in which corporations operated declined by 14% between
January 1985 and November 1989.</p>
<p>New firms that were formed during this period were much
less diversified than those that went out of business.
Continuing firms reduced the number of industries in which
they operated. Diversification was going out of style.</p>
<p>Mr. Lichtenberg believes that the conglomerate merger boom
of the late 1960s and early 1970s may have contributed to the
slowdown in U.S. productivity growth that began at or
slightly after that time. Similarly, he believes that
de-diversification now is bolstering U.S. productivity,
although he concedes that "it is difficult to determine the
magnitude of this contribution."</p>
<p>Productivity clearly can use some help. The Labor
Department last week reported that while manufacturing
productivity rose at a brisk annual rate of 4.1% in the first
quarter, overall business productivity dropped at a 0.5%
rate.</p>
<p>The way a corporation is organized obviously is only one
factor affecting its productivity. Research and development
may be more important. Major chemical companies, after first
diversifying into totally unrelated businesses, in the 1980s
decided to stay closer to home. They put less emphasis on
commodity chemicals and more on pharmaceuticals and related
new businesses such as biotechnology.</p>
<p>U.S. corporations have learned a lot in the past quarter
century. Whatever else they do, they're not likely to seek a
magic solution to their problems by deciding to put their
eggs in a lot of baskets.</p>
