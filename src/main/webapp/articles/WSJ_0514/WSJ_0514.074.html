	<p class="article-leader">HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam -- Nguyen Van Muoi Hai wasn't
one to hide his success.
   As his perfume and toiletries business grew, he bought
luxurious limousines and equipped himself with cordless
phones, fax machines and a dazzling array of electronic
gadgetry. He took to traveling in a convoy of cars, escorted
by helmeted bodyguards on motorbikes, their sirens screaming.
When the motorcade reached its destination, the outriders
would dismount and form two lines for him to pass through. An
aide would open the door and bow: "Welcome, general director.
You have arrived."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That sort of fanfare, worthy of a head of state, would
have drawn attention anywhere. In impoverished Vietnam, it
caused a sensation.</p>
<p>The youthful Mr. Muoi Hai, usually accompanied by his
glamorous wife, acquired celebrity status as his
rags-to-riches fame spread. He appeared frequently in
newspaper advertisements and television commercials promoting
his Thanh Huong Perfume Factory and its range of fragrances
and shampoos. He offered investors in the company's credit
cooperative higher and higher returns, and people responded
by lining up by the thousands to put their savings in Thanh
Huong.</p>
<p>It all must have seemed too good to be true -- and it was.</p>
<p>The authorities recently arrested 32-year-old Mr. Muoi Hai
and his associates, and closed the business. Initial
inquiries show that they were running a classic pyramid
scheme, paying early investors with money poured in by later
ones. Little of the money actually went into the business;
instead, it was diverted to buying cars and houses. In fact,
investigators say, there wasn't even a factory: Mr. Muoi Hai
was merely adding water to cheap imported perfume and
relabeling it for the local market.</p>
<p>The reaction to Mr. Muoi Hai's arrest was immediate and
tumultuous. Hundreds of people -- in the biggest
demonstrations since the Communists took over South Vietnam
in 1975 -- gathered daily for a week to demand that city
authorities here help them get their money back. That set off
runs on other credit cooperatives, as the secondary banks in
the country are called. The spreading panic quickly paralyzed
Vietnam's credit system. As it stands, most credit
cooperatives and some private companies are now unable to
repay depositors. Investors have learned that many of the
businesses -- far from being a sure bet -- have lost their
money on highly speculative ventures.</p>
<p>The government is getting the lion's share of the blame
for the crisis. Critics say it acted without thinking when it
implemented certain reforms in 1987 to help shift from a
centrally planned to a market economy. There simply wasn't
enough regulation to prevent schemers from exploiting the
situation, they say.</p>
<p>But if good intentions on the part of reformers begat
banking chaos, it also loosened the bonds on the country's
censored press. And it was ultimately the press that was Mr.
Muoi Hai's undoing.</p>
<p>As officials tell it, the trouble started when reformers
set out to create a banking system for Vietnam. They gave the
State Bank of Vietnam, the central bank, the task of
regulating money and credit. Newly created institutions,
called specialized banks, were entrusted with the frontline
work of providing cash and credit to depositors and
businesses.</p>
<p>According to Nguyen Xuan Oanh, a government economic
adviser, the specialized banks, which are owned by the state,
failed to perform their function. They attracted only a
fraction of the money held by the public and didn't readily
extend loans to new entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>As a result, "credit cooperatives jumped in to fill the
void," says Mr. Oanh, a former central bank governor of South
Vietnam. "No legislation, no rules, no nothing."</p>
<p>By early last year, the privately run credit cooperatives
were popping up everywhere -- "like mushrooms after the
rain," in the words of a local journalist. By the end of the
year, when the government ordered that no more be permitted
to open, there were about 20 credit cooperatives in Hanoi and
170 in Ho Chi Minh City, as well as dozens of others in
nearby provinces.</p>
<p>Some sought to act as financial intermediaries -- taking
in deposits and lending out money -- and others were formed
by private companies seeking capital for their own expansion.
While the specialized banks initially paid 8% a month, the
unrestrained credit cooperatives offered 10%. Soon,
cooperatives were engaged in cutthroat competition with each
other for deposits, pushing interest rates ever higher.</p>
<p>Nobody wooed potential depositors as ardently as Mr. Muoi
Hai, a one-time used-clothes hawker with limited formal
education who set up Thanh Huong to take advantage of new
government policies encouraging private enterprise.</p>
<p>Thanh Huong named its perfumes after famous overseas
products, such as "Charlie" and "Caresse." Similarly, it's
packaging and promotions borrowed freely from foreign
advertisements. But Mr. Muoi Hai, who couldn't be reached for
comment for this article, didn't attempt to sell his products
as much as his company. Over and over, he assured investors
that Thanh Huong was enjoying tremendous success and anyone
could get a piece of the action.</p>
<p>Vietnamese say people sold family jewelry and lined up for
hours to put their money in Thanh Huong's credit cooperative,
especially when the return reached a staggering 15% a month.
So heavy and sustained was the rush that a black market
developed in the numbered slips indicating order of service
that were handed out to those waiting to invest.</p>
<p>With money pouring in, Thanh Huong continued to expand,
opening highly visible retail outlets in hotels and at Ho Chi
Minh City's Tan Son Nhut airport. But not everyone was
impressed. Tuoi tre, a Ho Chi Minh City newspaper, in
particular was suspicious.</p>
<p>Editors noticed that one of Thanh Huong's four deputy
directors was a man who had quit as head of a large
state-owned detergent concern after being exposed for taking
bribes. Another deputy director was a former police
lieutenant colonel who had left the force after he was
convicted of torturing a man to death. In addition, the
company's products didn't seem popular, and Mr. Muoi Hai
refused to open his operations to inspection on the grounds
that he didn't want competitors to know his secrets.</p>
<p>When Tuoi tre published an article in 1988 expressing
doubts about Thanh Huong, Mr. Muoi Hai responded with a
hand-delivered letter that the paper interpreted as a death
threat. Mr. Muoi Hai later invited the paper's deputy
editor-in-chief, Tran Ngoc Chau, to his office. "He claimed
to have many products and customers," says Mr. Chau. "I told
him I didn't believe him and that I wanted to see his
factory. All I got was words."</p>
<p>Thanh Huong wasn't the only business attracting suspicion.
The press was also investigating Xacogiva, a company founded
by Pham Cong Tuoc, a former construction worker now about 55
years old.</p>
<p>Xacogiva endeared itself to the government by building a
few units of low-cost housing that Ho Chi Minh City
authorities allocated to the homeless. Nguyen Van Linh,
general secretary of the Vietnamese Communist Party, visited
the housing site with Mr. Tuoc, giving him a widely
publicized seal of approval.</p>
<p>Xacogiva's appeal for deposits for its credit cooperative
was based on ambitious plans that "touched a chord in
people's hearts," as a newspaper put it. Company executives
talked of solving the city's garbage problem, of building
roads, bridges and schools -- things the government couldn't
afford.</p>
<p>The centerpiece was to be a 16-kilometer stretch of road
linking a major highway with Duyen Hai, a hardscrabble "new
economic district" on the southern coast. Xacogiva said it
would build the road in three years and recover its outlay
through a highway toll. Officials approved the project,
imagining Duyen Hai, in time, becoming a new port for Ho Chi
Minh City.</p>
<p>However, as local newspapers reported, Xacogiva -- like
Thanh Huong -- seemed to be spending most of its funds on
fancy cars and a three-story "castle" for Mr. Tuoc. And Mr.
Tuoc, like Mr. Muoi Hai, took to traveling with his advisers,
assistants and agents in a convoy of cars flying the company
flag.</p>
<p>The newspapers, all of which are state-owned, continued to
expose widespread irregularities and "cheating" by both Thanh
Huong and Xacogiva, but the authorities seemed reluctant to
move against them. As recently as Feb. 25, Saigon Giai Phong,
a daily, said of Mr. Tuoc in a front-page headline, "The Law
Was Clearly Violated. Why Is the Criminal Still at Large?"</p>
<p>The answer, as Saigon Giai Phong itself suggested, was
that both Xacogiva and Thanh Huong were paying off officials
to keep the law at bay.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Tuoc's nerve snapped. In early March, he and
his followers fled to neighboring Cambodia, taking with them
a huge stash of money. His wife and family and some Xacogiva
executives, however, were caught. Police then arrested Thanh
Huong's Mr. Muoi Hai, along with his wife, brother and close
associates.</p>
<p>Officials say that Thanh Huong's books show that 140,000
people deposited 114.24 billion Vietnamese dong, or $26.9
million, in the company. Assets, mainly cars, houses, cash
and gold, total less than a quarter of that.</p>
<p>Newspapers in the city have now gone after the officials
who allegedly shielded Mr. Muoi Hai for so long. They have
named four or five officials and listed the expensive gifts
they got. The papers say it was also common practice for
Thanh Huong to bribe officials by giving them "empty" credit
books so they could collect monthly interest of up to 20% on
large, nonexistent deposits.</p>
<p>When depositors learned of the collapse of Xacogiva and
Thanh Huong, alarm swept the community. Hundreds of
depositors gathered outside the offices of the Ho Chi Minh
City People's Committee demanding that the authorities do
something about their lost money. Police clashed violently
with Mr. Muoi Hai's bodyguards, who demanded the release of
their boss and tried to force their way into municipal
offices. City authorities appealed on radio and TV for calm
and announced a schedule to partly repay Thanh Huong's
depositors.</p>
<p>Still, depositors have rushed to get their money back from
other credit cooperatives and private companies, forcing
dozens to close their doors. Some of the biggest are facing
bankruptcy.</p>
<p>One recent morning, for example, a crowd of worried
investors gathered in the dusty street outside the head
office of Anh Dao, a private concern that employs 800 workers
to make rattan, jute and bamboo products. The city
authorities had posted a notice saying they are trying to
raise money to pay back investors, "so please don't worry."</p>
<p>No matter how hard he tries, Do Hung Phi, 35, a farmer
from Long An province, does worry. He poured 10 years of
savings into Anh Dao. For six months, the company paid him
10% a month, but the interest payments stopped in April. "I
thought I could get money to take care of my elderly
parents," says Mr. Phi. He says he returns by motorbike every
few days in search of news.</p>
<p>Inside, Huynh La, 45, the blind owner of Anh Dao, admits
that the company is in deep trouble. "We're bearing the
consequences" of the panic spawned by the collapse of Thanh
Huong and Xacogiva, he says. "We haven't violated the law,
and we haven't cheated people."</p>
<p>Mr. La says Anh Dao, which continues to operate, has
started repaying depositors, and it is seeking a loan from
the State Bank to complete the repayment.</p>
<p>In Hanoi, State Bank officials say they are preparing
capital-adequacy and other regulations that will ensure
credit cooperatives are closely monitored in the future. The
officials say they intend to review the activities of credit
cooperatives and close weaker ones, though they concede that
nobody even knows how many exist throughout the country.</p>
<p>Mr. Oanh, the economic adviser, who estimates that credit
cooperatives have attracted total deposits of 400 billion
dong or more, criticizes the State Bank for its lack of
action.</p>
<p>"The State Bank is supposed to be the bank of last resort,
but it isn't acting like one," he says. "They aren't moving
to allow competent credit cooperatives to keep functioning."</p>
