	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- U.S. businesses involved in trade with China
are raising an alarm over the possible elimination of China's
most-favored-nation trade status.
   Fearing the U.S. will refuse to renew the MFN status for
political reasons, business associations and individual
companies are launching campaigns to warn of the impact on
U.S.-China trade and on U.S. consumers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a letter sent to its members, Congress and the White
House, the American Association of Exporters and Importers
estimated that the removal of MFN status would boost tariffs
on goods from China an average 40%. A 21-page report
distributed by the United States-China Business Council
offers examples: Some imported pants that currently are
subject to a 17.7% duty would face a 90% tariff. Some toys
would be taxed at 70% compared with the current 6.8%.</p>
<p>Many members of Congress are bent on slapping the Beijing
leadership for its brutal crackdown on the pro-democracy
movement last June, and the MFN status provides a powerful
and timely weapon. But it's uncertain if that view would
prevail if President Bush, as expected, extends most-favored
trading status for China. If the legislators object and pass
a resolution revoking MFN status for China, Mr. Bush could
veto it; congressional staffers who follow the issue say it
would be difficult for Congress to muster the two-thirds vote
to override a veto. Mr. Bush isn't expected to disclose his
decision until close to the June 3 deadline.</p>
<p>In a series of interviews, people here who do business in
China expressed outrage at the Beijing government's actions
in Tiananmen Square last year. But they argued that a rebuke
of Beijing is a foreign policy matter that should be kept
separate from the trade issue. "We recognize what the Chinese
government did to its people," said Kathleen Syron of the
U.S.-China Business Council. "We're not against some form of
punishment. But don't use MFN."</p>
<p>Any change in China's trade status could hit importers
with rising costs, either because of the higher tariffs or
higher prices for supplies in other countries. That, in turn,
could mean higher prices to American consumers. At the same
time, a drop in China's shipments to the U.S. would further
shrink the country's foreign-exchange reserves and reduce its
ability to pay for American exports. U.S. exporters such as
wheat growers and aircraft manufacturers could suffer an
additional hardship if the the Chinese leadership should
retaliate and refuse to buy U.S. goods.</p>
<p>The debate will heat up on Wednesday and on May 23, when
the House Foreign Affairs Committee convenes hearings on the
issue. By June 3, one day before the anniversary of the
Tiananmen Square massacre, President Bush must notify
Congress whether or not he intends to seek a renewal of
China's MFN treatment. China's MFN status expires July 3.</p>
<p>The U.S. extends MFN status, which entitles a country to
favorable tariffs, to nearly all its trading partners. Even
such countries as South Africa, Iraq and Syria are accorded
MFN trade status. Only 16 nations, including North Korea,
Cuba and the Soviet Union, don't receive MFN benefits. "MFN
sounds like a privilege," said Ms. Syron of the
Washington-based United States-China Business Council. "But
actually it's not."</p>
<p>The elimination of MFN for China would come at a
particularly bad time for both U.S. textile importers and
apparel consumers. Several recent U.S. decisions could impose
higher tariffs on a broad range of textile goods, causing
prices to rise. In one case, the Commerce Department last
month issued a preliminary decision against South Korea,
Taiwan and Hong Kong that could result in anti-dumping duties
on those countries' synthetic-fiber sweaters. In addition,
India recently was singled out as an unfair trading partner.
Among India's chief exports to the U.S. is clothing.</p>
<p>Clint Stack, president of International Development
Systems Inc., a Washington-based textile consulting firm,
calculates that the combination of the anti-dumping duties,
the revocation of China's MFN status and the Indian case
would have a severe impact on the U.S. consumer.</p>
<p>"You could end up with 20% of the total U.S. textile
apparel imports being subjected to significantly higher duty
rates," he said. China's textile and apparel imports account
for 13% of the total.</p>
<p>Tariffs wouldn't be the only cause of higher prices. If
textile importers sought to avoid the higher duties by
sourcing goods elsewhere, business people say other countries
would likely raise their prices.</p>
