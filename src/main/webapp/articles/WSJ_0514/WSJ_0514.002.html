	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The nation's rural poor are going hungry
because food-stamp benefits aren't enough to cover higher
food costs in impoverished rural counties, a new consumer
survey shows.
   Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, a
Washington-based consumer group, says that of nine million
rural Americans living in poverty, many are food-stamp
recipients who are paying higher prices for fewer calories
than the poor in cities.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In its survey of 33 counties with a 25% poverty rate, the
group found that the weekly $75 food-stamp allotment for a
household of four isn't adequate to buy all of the food in
the government's "thrifty food plan," which is regarded as
the minimum diet from a nutrition standpoint. It takes $102 a
week to buy the thrifty food plan if food-stamp recipients
don't have access to competitively priced supermarkets and
must shop at higher priced mom-and-pop stores, according to
the survey.</p>
<p>What's more, even at rural supermarkets, the average cost
of foods in the thrifty plan is 8% higher than the $75
allotment, the survey shows.</p>
<p>Ellen Haas, executive director of Public Voice, faults the
Agriculture Department, which administers the food-stamp
program, for failing to take the urban-rural price
differences into account.</p>
<p>The results of the national survey, conducted last year,
will strengthen the hand of Rep. Leon Panetta (D., Calif.)
and other lawmakers who are pushing hunger-relief measures
this year in Congress. The group also found that one of every
three food-stamp dollars in poor areas is spent in crossroads
stores and small-town grocery stores where supplies of fresh
produce and meat are limited. Last summer, 23% of the stores
surveyed didn't stock any fresh vegetables and 33% didn't
stock any fresh fruits, while 30% didn't sell fresh meats.</p>
<p>In its survey, the group recommends increasing food-stamp
allotments 17% by fiscal 1995 to boost the poor's purchasing
power and re-evaluating the Agriculture Department's methods
for determining food-stamp benefits. In addition, it calls
for federal grants to help small rural stores set up
wholesale-purchasing cooperatives and become more
price-competitive with supermarkets.</p>
