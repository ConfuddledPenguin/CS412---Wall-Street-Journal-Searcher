	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Consumer prices for April -- the next test of
inflation's force -- are expected to slow, but not as much as
the recent break in wholesale prices and not enough to make
up for first-quarter damage.
   Besides the consumer price index, due out Wednesday, the
week includes important readings on April industrial output
and capacity utilization; housing starts and permits, plus
the March trade deficit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The April CPI is expected to rise about 0.2%, following
two back-to-back months of 0.5% increases, according to MMS
International, a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc. Last Friday, the
producer price index logged a decline of 0.3%, its third
improved reading in a row.</p>
<p>But some economists cautioned against celebrating too
soon. "Some of the outrages of the first quarter have come
back to earth. But in an arithmetical sense, it's hard to get
numbers below 5% for the year," said Neal Soss, chief
economist at First Boston Corp. Among the first-quarter
"outrages" -- when the annualized CPI rate jumped to 8.5% --
he cited the leap in apparel prices and other special
seasonal factors.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in recent months wholesale prices have been
better-behaved than the CPI, which is heavily weighted in the
wage-driven services sector. Economists say this "structural"
inflation -- such as escalating costs linked to wage or
healthcare commitments -- is tougher to tame than inflation
tied to volatile commodities, such as food and oil.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Mr. Soss expects to see "slow, grudging
progress" on inflation. Employers, he added, will be "on the
front line, trying to control these health benefit costs that
first show up in inflation, then as profitability pressures."</p>
<p>Elliot Platt, economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette,
has been forecasting a long-term annual inflation rate of
4.5% since 1988. He still thinks the number is doable over
the next few years. But Mr. Platt, too, noted "the terrible
inflation news we had in the first quarter put us above that"
for now. Besides high apparel prices, he cited a big jump in
the CPI's housing component, which he figures was caused by
technical factors that should begin to work themselves out.</p>
<p>Edward Campbell, economist with Brown Brothers Harriman &
Co., agrees. In fact, he sees a "high possibility" the April
CPI will be unchanged or even lower. "April is the time we
get more news and less noise" from statistical quirks, he
said. Among the "special circumstances" he thinks will abate
are the big technical jump in March housing costs; increases
in public transportation fares put in place by many cities
early this year, and the recent increase in apparel prices.</p>
<p>Reports on April industrial output and capacity
utilization, due out tomorrow are expected to bear out the
current belief that the economy is sluggish. Output is
expected to be unchanged or slightly lower following March's
0.7% increase. The operating rate is expected to drop a bit
to 83.1% from March's 83.3%, according to MMS.</p>
<p>The March trade deficit, due out Thursday, is expected to
widen to around $8 billion following February's surprising
shrinkage to $6.5 billion. But First Boston's Mr. Soss noted
that while "$8 billion is higher, it wasn't that long ago we
were dreaming of getting this low a number."</p>
<p>The broader deficit is due to a jump in imports as
evidenced by a jump in custom's duties receipts for March,
economists said. Gary Ciminero, chief economist at
Fleet/Norstar Financial Group, Providence, R.I., noted that
the customs report found that incoming shipments of Japanese
cars rose more than 10% in March and that petroleum imports
rebounded after a decline in February due to mild weather.</p>
<p>Housing starts, due out Wednesday, are expected to drop a
bit from March to an annual rate of 1.3 million units,
according to MMS. Economists said housing continues to feel
the impact of higher interest rates, cooler home prices and
tighter lending policies.</p>
