	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Bond market sentiment is turning bullish to
the point of euphoria, leading some analysts to warn that
investors may be overlooking the potholes ahead on the road
to lower rates.
   After being in the dumps for more than six months, bond
prices are rallying sharply and investors are reaping quick
profits. In less than two weeks, the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond has rocketed more than four points, a gain of
about $40 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. On Friday
alone, the Treasury's long-term bond jumped more than two
points, the biggest one-day rally so far this year, on news
of declining producer prices and retail sales.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But while many fixed-income portfolio managers believe
that the bond market will continue to improve, they are
bracing for what they believe will be a bumpy ride. They say
the current rally could be a false start.</p>
<p>"Whenever the market goes up this much and this quickly,
it always goes into a corrective pattern," said Roberta
Olsen, a portfolio manager at Banc One Asset Management Corp.
"Right now I'm looking to sell some bonds," she said, but she
is ready to buy bonds heavily as prices weaken.</p>
<p>Frankie D. Hughes, a portfolio manager at W.R. Lazard &
Co., also is taking a cautious approach to the market.
Although she believes that Treasury bond yields could fall as
low as 8% over the course of the year, she's "a little
leery," because bond market sentiment seems to have turned
from bearish to bullish on the weight of inconclusive
economic news. "There hasn't been any great big fundamental
change in the economy in the past two weeks" to justify the
market's sharp move, said Ms. Hughes.</p>
<p>The Labor Department reported on Friday that producer
prices, a measure of inflation, fell 0.3% in April, following
a 0.2% decline the month before. Separately, the Department
of Commerce said retail sales slid a steep 0.6% in April,
attributable largely to a sharp decline in car sales.</p>
<p>The statistics bolstered bond prices because they
suggested that the economy isn't resurging and inflation is
under control. The reports, coming after a weak economic
report released on May 4, put a lid on speculation that the
Federal Reserve may push up interest rates. Now, many
economists believe the Fed will leave interest rates
unchanged.</p>
<p>While this should be good for bonds in the long run, money
managers say a number of difficulties stand in the way of a
sustained rally. Their caution stems in part from bitter
experience. They were overly pessimistic at the beginning of
last year, missing part of a rally, and got stung again as
they were fully invested when the market declined in the
summer.</p>
<p>Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Norwest Corp., is
warning buyers to be prepared for a few potential "problems
on the horizon." One is the growing size of federal and
municipal borrowings. Mr. Sohn estimates that the federal
government will raise $124 billion in cash in the first three
quarters of 1990, up from $71 billion in the first three
quarters of 1989.</p>
<p>"That's a lot of money that has to be raised, and could
create some indigestion in the market," he said. Moreover,
the looming supply "could keep rates from coming down
significantly."</p>
<p>Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank Corp.,
notes that while inflation isn't accelerating, it's still a
long way from what the Fed would consider acceptable.
Meanwhile, he believes that the economy, although weak, isn't
going into a recession.</p>
<p>Therefore, Mr. Robertson thinks it unlikely that the Fed
will ease credit policy anytime soon. And without a Fed
easing, he said, bond yields won't fall far enough to result
in a sustained market rally.</p>
<p>"I must say that some of the euphoria is a little
overdone," said Mr. Robertson. "I don't think that we've won
the war against inflation. It's still very much with us."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>Treasury bonds ended sharply higher in the biggest rally
of the year as market players put their concerns about
economic growth and inflation behind them.</p>
<p>The rally was sparked by two economic reports, which
showed sharp declines in producer prices and retail sales.
The reports indicated that inflationary pressures may be less
severe than had been thought previously and that modest
economic growth is continuing -- good news for a bond market
anxious to avoid any tightening in Federal Reserve
interest-rate policy.</p>
<p>Prices also were boosted as a wave of relief washed over
the market following Thursday's final leg of the Treasury's
$30.5 billion quarterly note and bond sale.</p>
<p>The Treasury's new 30-year bellwether bond, the 8 3/4%
coupon bond that was auctioned Thursday by the Treasury,
surged 2 2/32 points in when-issued trading activity. That
was a gain of more than $20 for a bond with a $1,000 face
amount. The yield on the issue, which was set at 8.84% at
Thursday's auction, eased to 8.63% on Friday. The Treasury's
former 30-year benchmark bond rose 1 23/32 points on Friday.</p>
<p>Intermediate-maturity securities also posted strong gains.
In when-issued trading, the Treasury's new 10-year note ended
at 101 14/32 to yield 8.64%, up 1 7/32 points on the day. The
yield on the notes was set at 8.88% when they were auctioned
on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Short-term rates were sharply lower. The discount rate on
three-month Treasury bills was quoted late Friday at about
7.62% for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.89%, compared with a
rate of 7.72% for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.96% on
Thursday.</p>
<p>Treasurys surged despite the dollar's weakness,
particularly against the yen. The dollar's decline came amid
hectic dollar selling in the Japanese currency market.</p>
<p>In the corporate bond market, both investment-grade and
junk bonds posted strong advances.</p>
<p>Most junk bonds, the speculative-grade securities with low
credit ratings or none at all, gained half a point.</p>
<p>Among the biggest gainers in the junk market were the 13%
senior notes of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, which were three
points higher in late afternoon trading.</p>
<p>One of the biggest losers: Charter Medical Corp., whose
junk bonds plunged five points on news that the company
reported sharply lower second-quarter earnings.</p>
<p>Investment-grade corporate debt, which has been a slow
mover for much of the year, climbed as much as 1 1/4 points
Friday.</p>
