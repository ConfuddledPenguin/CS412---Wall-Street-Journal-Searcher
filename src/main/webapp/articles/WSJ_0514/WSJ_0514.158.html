	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Drexel Burnham Lambert Trading Corp., which
was pushed into bankruptcy-law proceedings alongside its
parent last week, disclosed details of its debt in a court
filing.
   The commodities trading unit of Drexel Burnham Lambert
Group Inc., which is based in Fort Lee, N.J., said its net
liabilities as of March 30 were $504.5 million. Its total
assets at that date were $587.3 million, including $558
million owed to the unit by the parent company. DBL Trading,
which is no longer doing business, said those are the latest
figures available.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Creditors of DBL Trading on Wednesday filed an involuntary
bankruptcy petition to force the unit to liquidate. The
Drexel unit's filing said that Nissho Iwai Corp., a major
Japanese trading company, is owed $173.4 million, making it
the largest creditor yet to emerge in the Drexel bankruptcy
case. John Jerome, an attorney for Nissho Iwai, said the debt
is from gold and platinum transactions. He said Nissho Iwai
has a guarantee from the Drexel parent company for the claim.</p>
<p>The Drexel parent company filed under Chapter 11 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code in February and is liquidating all of
its operations. In federal bankruptcy court in Manhattan,
Judge Howard Buschman III also converted DBL Trading's
bankruptcy case to Chapter 11, under which the debtor remains
in control of the company.</p>
<p>Mr. Jerome said Nissho Iwai has no objections to the case
being handled under Chapter 11.</p>
<p>According to the court filing, the other major unsecured
creditors of DBL Trading are the central bank of Portugal,
which is owed $93.9 million; the central bank of Yugoslavia,
$71.9 million; the central bank of Malaysia, $42.2 million;
Ultramar Energy Ltd. of Tarrytown, N.Y., $10.8 million; the
central bank of Poland, $10.6 million; CNCA HK, an affiliate
of Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole of France, $10.5
million; Al Baraka Investment Co. of London, $5.6 million;
State Saving Bank of Warsaw, $4.8 million; and CRT Energy
Ltd. of Chicago, $1.9 million. Some of the amounts may vary
as exchange rates change.</p>
<p>Most of the debt involves precious-metals transactions, an
attorney familiar with the case said. Some of the central
banks leased small portions of their gold reserves to DBL
Trading, which paid the foreign countries interest on the
gold while investing it in other transactions. Some of the
money owed to foreign central banks involves foreign currency
transactions.</p>
