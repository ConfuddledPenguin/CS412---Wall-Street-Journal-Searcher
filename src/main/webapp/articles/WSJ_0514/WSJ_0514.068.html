	<p class="article-leader">COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Worthington Industries Inc. has
experienced a marked upturn in steel processing, its largest
business, which will make the fourth quarter by far the
strongest profit period for fiscal 1990, John H. McConnell,
chairman and chief executive officer said.
   Profit for the quarter, ending May 31, is likely to be
only a little lower than the 49 cents a share from continuing
operations in the strong year-ago period, he said in an
interview. For the first nine months, profit from continuing
operations declined 16% to 90 cents a share from $1.06 a
share in the comparable 1989 period.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales for the fourth quarter probably will be slightly
higher than the $265.5 million from continuing operations in
the year-ago period, Mr. McConnell said. Higher sales of
processed steel will more than offset lower sales of plastic
products, mainly auto parts.</p>
<p>For fiscal 1991, unless the overall economy takes a dive,
Worthington will have record profit for the year, Mr.
McConnell said. A major factor in the brighter 1991 outlook,
he said, is an increase in the number of car models that will
use Worthington's instrument panels and other plastic parts.
The company also will be aided by the stronger steel market,
major new facilities and higher demand for railroad castings,
he said.</p>
<p>For the fiscal 1989 fourth quarter, Worthington had net
income of $20.8 million, or 51 cents a share, including two
cents a share from a pipe fittings business sold last
January.</p>
<p>Mr. McConnell didn't make a specific earnings estimate for
the fiscal year, but he indicated that profit from continuing
operations will exceed $1.30 a share. The discontinued pipe
fittings operations will cost the company five cents a share
for fiscal 1990, all in the first nine months.</p>
<p>For fiscal 1989, Worthington earned $1.55 a share from
continuing operations. Net income was $64.2 million, or $1.58
a share, a record high.</p>
<p>Sales for fiscal 1990 will be down slightly from fiscal
1989 sales from continuing operations of $939.3 million, Mr.
McConnell said.</p>
<p>While it is too early to make a precise forecast of 1991
results, Mr. McConnell said analyst estimates ranging from
$1.60 a share to $1.75 a share "appear reasonable." Sales
will exceed $1 billion, he said.</p>
<p>Directors are likely to consider a dividend increase at a
meeting later this month, he said. The board last August
raised the quarterly rate to 14 cents, from 12 cents.</p>
<p>Worthington Industries Inc.'s steel processing business
"is doing real well" Mr. McConnell said. Demand began picking
up early in the year, and orders for both March and April
were higher than a year earlier, he said. Sales have improved
at all 10 locations where Worthington processes and
distributes steel, he said, indicating higher production at a
wide range of industries from automobiles to lawn and garden
equipment.</p>
<p>"Pricing is coming back" after a period of widespread
steel price discounting, he added. "Our margins are much
better than they were in the third quarter," which ended Feb.
28, he said. The low point for steel processing margins came
in November, he said, but margins remained under pressure for
another quarter.</p>
<p>As a result, operating profits for steel processing in the
current quarter will exceed year-ago levels, he said.</p>
<p>Startup costs at a new processing plant in Porter, Ind.,
which is four times the size of the Chicago plant it is
replacing, are cutting into steel processing profits in
fiscal 1990, he said. However, the plant, which will cost
about $40 million when completed in calendar 1991, will
contribute to profits next fiscal year, he said.</p>
<p>Worthington also is expanding facilities that stamp out
rough shapes for customers, ranging from auto parts to garden
shovels, Mr. McConnell said. That business "is growing by
leaps and bounds," as Worthington buys more presses and signs
up new customers, he said.</p>
<p>Lower profits from plastic products are a major factor in
Worthington's expected fiscal 1990 earnings drop, Mr.
McConnell said. Changes in car models and relocation of some
auto production reduced sales, he said, and industry output
dropped in the calendar 1990 first quarter. In addition, a
new joint venture with a Japanese concern to make parts for
Japanese-owned auto plants will have a loss in fiscal 1990
because of startup costs, but it has gone into the black in
the last few months.</p>
<p>However, "we have business booked for 1991 models that
assure us of a tremendous year at plastics without any big
increase in car sales," Mr. McConnell said. Production of
instrument panels and other parts for 1991 models will begin
in June, he said.</p>
<p>Sales of steel castings are increasing, mainly because of
higher railroad car business, he said. For fiscal 1990, both
sales and operating profits will be slightly lower, he said,
"but they're ending the year pretty strong." The company's
foundry makes undercarriages, couplers and other parts for
freight cars and rapid transit cars.</p>
<p>However, sales of steel cylinders for compressed gases are
lower this year, he said, probably because of a new federal
tax on refrigerant gases, he said. Profit margins are holding
up well, however, because of new production methods that
reduced costs, he said. While refrigerants account for less
than half the company's cylinder sales, sales to the
technicians who service air conditioning equipment still are
a major market. Sales for gas barbecue grills, camping
equipment and other applications are strong, he said.</p>
<p>Worthington Industries Inc. will invest about $60 million
in new facilities during fiscal 1990, one-third more than the
$45.1 million of 1989, said Joseph H. Stegmayer, vice
president and chief financial officer. That figure excludes
investment in the plastics joint venture, he said. The
recently completed joint venture plant, 60% owned by
Worthington, cost $12 million to $15 million, but it is being
financed separately, he said.</p>
<p>The company has bought back two million of its shares over
the last two years, and has board authorization to buy back
another one million shares, he said. At year end, the company
will have about 39.5 million shares outstanding.</p>
<p>Facilities spending and stock buy-backs in fiscal 1990
will be financed from cash flow and the proceeds of about $25
million from sale of the pipe fittings unit, Mr. Stegmayer
said. Worthington will have $25 million or more of cash and
short-term investments at year end, compared with $43.1
million a year earlier.</p>
<p>Capital spending in fiscal 1991 is likely to be lower, he
said, but the company hasn't completed a review of all
spending requests from the divisions. Internally generated
cash will handle the 1991 spending, he said.</p>
