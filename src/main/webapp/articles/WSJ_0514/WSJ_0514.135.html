	<p class="article-leader">STOCKS AND BONDS SURGED on Friday as reports of moderate
inflation and a slowing economy damped speculation that the
Fed would soon boost interest rates. Producer prices fell
0.3% in April, the second decline in two months, while retail
sales slid 0.6%, mainly due to a continued slump in auto
sales. Both declines surprised the markets.</p>

Holding, observers said. Amax offered $1.25 billion for the

which owns 45% of Peabody. Amax's move spurred speculation of
its own vulnerability to a takeover.</p>
