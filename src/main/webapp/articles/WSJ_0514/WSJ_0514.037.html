	<p class="article-leader">Peter Jennings misunderstands many of my criticisms ("ABC
Flacks for Hanoi," editorial page, April 26) and fails to
address others in his May 1 letter to the editor defending
his ABC Cambodia documentary.
   I had argued extensively that in order to understand the
conflict in Cambodia today it is essential to discuss the
colonial ambitions of the Vietnamese communists. That issue
explains why the Khmer Rouge insurgency persists with some
voluntary support, in spite of past Khmer Rouge atrocities.
It is thus crucial for any examination of American policy.
What is remarkable about Mr. Jennings's reply is that he
still manages deftly to skirt consideration of Vietnam's
critical role.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Jennings cannot understand my challenge to the
documentary's apocalyptic premise. I conclude that the Khmer
Rouge are "far from likely to seize {power} soon." He
counters with a view that ". . . the Khmer Rouge is capable
of rolling over the PRK" (the Phnom Penh regime). I do not
disagree with the statement. Yet the Khmer Rouge and the
noncommunists are fighting not only the PRK but also
Vietnamese troops and advisersa crucial fact that ABC's
documentary denied. Moreover, the Khmer Rouge are restrained
by fear of greater Vietnamese reintervention should they try
to seize power soon. That is why the Khmer Rouge are fighting
not to seize power but to pressure Phnom Penh into a
compromise political settlement.</p>
<p>Mr. Jennings confuses the point that I made when I wrote
of his "extraordinary statement" that Phnom Penh's army
"alone, without the Vietnamese" has "a real problem fighting"
the resistance supported by the U.S. and China. My point was
that the Phnom Penh army is not alone "without the
Vietnamese," nor alone without the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Mr. Jennings has no idea whether the Phnom Penh leaders
are "unrepentant" Khmer Rouge, as I assert, and suspects that
I do not have proof. But one fact is compelling evidence of
"unrepentance." In spite of their frequent ritual
denunciation of Pol Pot's atrocities, Phnom Penh's leaders
have never apologized for their own role in so many of them.
These atrocities include the forced evacuation of the cities,
the murder of thousands of people identified with the former
regime, the abolition of religion and the forced dispersal of
the Cham Moslem minority communities.</p>
<p>In his eagerness to put the best possible face on Phnom
Penh by asserting declining repression in Cambodia today, Mr.
Jennings misrepresents the most recent Amnesty report (March
1989). Amnesty cites little more than 400 political prisoners
of the Phnom Penh regime by name. But it does not suggest
that this amounts to anything like the total number detained.
Moreover, it notes that the 412 officially reported arrests
in Siem Reap-Utdar Meanchey province alone during the first
nine months of 1988 were greater than in previous years.</p>
<p>Mr. Jennings is most incensed by what he calls my
"insidious" and "unsubstantiated" description of producer
Leslie Cockburn as a "committed left ideologue." Readers who
missed Ms. Cockburn's 1987 PBS documentary "Murder on the Rio
San Juan" (which suggested that the CIA tried to murder
Nicaraguan Contra leader Eden Pastora) should consult her
rambling tract "Out of Control," based on related work at
CBS. There Ms. Cockburn propounds the theory of a U.S.
Central America policy carried out by an "old-boy network" of
former CIA operatives, assassins and drug runners. In support
of her tale, she extensively cites Daniel Sheehan of the
Christic Institute, which sued a number of different people
who aided the Nicaraguan Contras. Mr. Sheehan's tale was
tested in a Miami court in 1988. The judge not only dismissed
Mr. Sheehan's suit, but also assessed him $1 million in legal
fees for bringing an unsubstantiated suit.</p>
<p>One victim here is American Special Forces Col. Denny
Lane. Why does Mr. Jennings still insist on indicting Col.
Lane for a crime (providing American aid to the Khmer Rouge)
by insinuation and innuendo? If ABC has evidence, then why
hasn't it produced it?</p>
<p>Had Mr. Jennings's ABC team been interested in a fair
examination of American policy -- which supports Cambodia's
noncommunists -- it would have discussed the fact that most
of Cambodia's noncommunist leaders and all of its soldiers
are holocaust survivors who dread the idea of a Khmer Rouge
return to power. ABC would have pondered America's failure to
provide lethal aid to such worthy recipients, instead of
falsely asserting its flow. ABC also would have discussed
Hanoi's continuing colonial intervention and political
intransigence, which have forced the reluctant and limited
alliance between the noncommunists and their former
tormentors. But such themes would have presented the struggle
for Cambodia, and American policy, as complex moral problems.
ABC's documentary could not have remained the simple tale of
American political perfidy and moral callousness -- a tale
that Mr. Jennings and Ms. Cockburn tell so easily.</p>
