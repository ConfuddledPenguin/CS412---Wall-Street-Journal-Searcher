	<p class="article-leader">BFS Bancorp reported first-quarter net income fell 55% to
$770,000, or 54 cents a share, partly from a tripling of its
provision for loan losses.
   The Bristol, Conn., holding company for Bankers Federal
Savings noted that first-quarter net also included a smaller
gain from the sale of investment securities, compared with a
year earlier. Year-ago first-quarter profit was $1.7 million,
or $1.18 a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company's provision for loan losses increased to
$310,000 from $101,000 a year earlier. The company said
nonperforming loans are above historical levels but below the
level of a year earlier. A spokeswoman said the bank didn't
expect any further increases in its loan-loss reserve.</p>
<p>Interest income before provisions for loan losses
increased 4% during the first quarter to $3 million from $2.9
million a year earlier.</p>
<p>In April, BFS settled litigation with a dissident
shareholder, First Capital Group, a Redondo Beach, Calif.,
investment firm. As part of the settlement, First Capital
gave up a seat on the company's board that it had won in a
proxy fight.</p>
<p>In national over-the-counter trading Friday, BFS closed at
$8.75 a share, down 75 cents.</p>
