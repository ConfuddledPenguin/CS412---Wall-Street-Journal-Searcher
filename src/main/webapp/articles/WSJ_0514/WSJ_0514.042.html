	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- International Business Machines Corp. is
expected to unveil tomorrow a major expansion in the
capabilities of CallPath, a software product that links
telephone switches to computers, industry executives said.
   IBM will announce CallPath support for telephone switches
other than those made by Rolm, the telecommunications concern
that it owns in partnership with Siemens AG, the executives
said. It will also announce several new CallPath features,
and will outline a set of protocols for companies that write
software that works with CallPath, they added.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>IBM declined to comment, but has scheduled a "major
telecommunications announcement" for tomorrow.</p>
<p>CallPath identifies callers to a telephone switch known as
a PBX, for private branch exchange, and automatically pulls
information about them from an IBM minicomputer or mainframe.
Telephone operators -- customer service representatives or
brokers, for example -- can see callers' files displayed on a
screen as soon as they pick up the phone, which saves time
and opens up new marketing opportunities.</p>
<p>Currently, CallPath works only with Rolm PBXs, and only
with incoming calls. The executives said IBM will announce
CallPath support for PBXs made by Northern Telecom Inc. and
American Telephone & Telegraph Co., among others. They also
said CallPath will work with outgoing calls -- a big plus for
telemarketing companies and others that depend on calling
their customers.</p>
<p>AT&T, Northern Telecom and Rolm together dominate the PBX
market. Since many companies keep their customer databases on
IBM computers, IBM's announcement opens up CallPath services
to a huge audience.</p>
<p>In addition, the industry executives said IBM will
announce a set of standards and protocols that will enable
software writers to develop CallPath applications that work
in a large variety of environments.</p>
<p>"This is going to be great news for all the different
vendors playing in this marketplace," said Dixon Doll,
chairman of DMW Group, a consulting firm in Ann Arbor, Mich.
"A very major vendor is putting a very big stake in the
ground, and everyone can take their direction from it.
Customers can now be sure that standards are going to emerge
in this market."</p>
