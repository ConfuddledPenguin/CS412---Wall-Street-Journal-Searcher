	<p class="article-leader">New York -- As unfortunate audiences at the New York
Public Theater's star-struck Shakespeare Festival have found,
American movie idols aren't too adept at putting on tights
and reciting 16th-century verse. Pluck a pretty face off the
silver screen and put it behind the footlights, and all too
often the result is cornball classics. (More to the point,
another result is full houses.)
   But Kevin Kline is definitely no cornball in the Public's
new production of "Hamlet." Mr. Kline, who last year won an
Oscar for best supporting actor as a hilarious thug in "A
Fish Called Wanda," is currently turning in a technically
precise performance as the melancholy Dane in a carefully
calibrated production he directed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Kline isn't the noble Hamlet, or the indecisive
Hamlet, or the neurotic, introspective or intellectual
Hamlet. He doesn't let any single emotion take over, which
leaves him exposed to the charge of being passionless. But
Hamlet is open to innumerable interpretations, and it is
because Mr. Kline chooses not to focus on one but to juggle
many that he is so believable.</p>
<p>His rejection scene with Ophelia is the best example. When
he first catches sight of her, his face lights up with joy.
But then he spits insults at her. His voice will drop to a
tender whisper and he'll clasp her in his arms, only to shake
her in fury a moment later. The emotional swirl is just
right.</p>
<p>He also does nicely with Hamlet's skittish moods. He
needles the interfering Polonius with an edgy blend of verve
and venom, and he baits his mousetrap play-within-a-play with
a lunatic intensity that turns into sarcastic politeness when
Gertrude and Claudius appear.</p>
<p>A fairly strong cast helps Mr. Kline along. Especially
fine is Josef Sommer as the bombastic Polonius, whom Mr.
Sommer plays as a dangerous meddler and without the
buffoonery often brought to the role. This comes out best in
his scenes with Ophelia, whose behavior toward Hamlet he
directs with horrible severity.</p>
<p>Diane Venora makes a sorrowful Ophelia, who doesn't have
the spirit to disobey her domineering father's instructions
on how to test her lover's fidelity. She has superb control
over her voice, which slides in and out of heart-rending sobs
during her rejection scene with Hamlet and soars into a
terrible falsetto as she sings her mad ditties.</p>
<p>Dana Ivey, the original driven Miss Daisy in the 1987
off-Broadway production of Alfred Uhry's play, isn't driven
as mother Gertrude, whom she plays rather matter-of-factly.
Brian Murray is even more mundane as Claudius. Could this
impassive man have committed murder in order to inherit his
brother's crown and his brother's wife? The surprising
exception to his otherwise soulless performance is the
soliloquy in which he tries unsuccessfully to beg forgiveness
from God. As his intellect grapples with his emotions, it is
as if he is comprehending his hideous deeds for the first
time.</p>
<p>Mr. Kline makes his directorial debut here and does a
serviceable job. This production isn't a feast for the eyes.
The cast is in unremarkable modern dress. And the set is as
spare as they come -- just two black pillars and the
requisite curtain behind which Polonius hides and then meets
his death.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Also playing at the Public is "Ice Cream With Hot Fudge,"
a pair of monotonous one-act comedies by Caryl Churchill, the
anti-Thatcherite whose "Serious Money" was a hit a couple of
years ago among London and New York Yuppies who love to hate
themselves.</p>
<p>In "Hot Fudge," the first and shorter of the pair, Ms.
Churchill lashes out at the acquisitive classes. The best
that can be said about it is that there are a few amusing
minutes spent on a discussion of expensive vacations, which
the characters consider an inalienable right. "People ought
to swim with dolphins," says one. Another (a crass American,
of course) is into "self-development holidays;" she likes to
lie poolside and "visualize" her tennis game.</p>
<p>In "Ice Cream," an Anglophile American couple look up
distant relatives in England and get caught up in a violent
incident. Ten scenes are set in England and 10 more take
place in the U.S., when the long-lost cousins come calling.
About the only difference between them is that in the first
ten, the Americans are boobs abroad, and in the second they
are boobs at home.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>"Once on the Island" (Playwrights Horizons) is a breezy
reggae musical. With music by Stephen Flaherty and book and
lyrics by Lynn Ahrens, it is based on a novel by Trinidadian
author Rosa Guy.</p>
<p>Set on an island in the French Antilles, the story is a
variation on an old standby: An uptown boy falls in love with
a beautiful girl from across the tracks. In this Caribbean
version, the girl is a black peasant and the boy is a mulatto
landowner. The tale is told by four conniving island gods and
goddesses, who give fate a shove and do the matchmaking.</p>
<p>But the story is largely immaterial. It's just a way to
propel the cast of 11 spirited singers and dancers into one
charming number after another. Of the show's 16 songs, my
favorite was "Mama Will Provide." In it, Mother Earth (Kecia
Lewis-Evans) belts out a warm melody while the syncopated
background music is sung by the others, mimicking birds,
trees, frogs and breezes.</p>
<p>The simple set is as friendly as the play itself; tropical
birds and flowers are painted on sky-blue walls and a
sea-green floor. If you don't pay too close attention to
"Island's" lyrics, which are about as unsophisticated as the
plot, you'll have a cheery hour and a half.</p>
