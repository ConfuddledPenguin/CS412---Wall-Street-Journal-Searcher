	<p class="article-leader">NATO MOVED toward a restructuring of the West's
nuclear-weapons strategy.
   Concluding a two-day meeting in Canada, the alliance's
defense ministers said that because of recent political
changes in Eastern Europe there is a "diminishing need" for
short-range nuclear arms in NATO's arsenal, opening the way
for deep reductions in its battlefield weapons. The Western
officials also called on the Soviet Union to make
"substantial" unilateral cuts in its short-range nuclear
missile systems. A full NATO summit is set for July 5-6 in
London.</p>

status.</p>

drug charges alleging that he possessed cocaine on several
occasions from the fall of 1984 until his arrest last January

lying to a grand jury. He has pleaded innocent.</p>

<p>A federal appeals court ruled that New York's Metropolitan
Transportation Authority can prohibit begging in the city's

ruling had characterized begging and panhandling as forms of
free speech.</p>

<p>Estonia proposed establishing a council of officials from
the three Baltic republics to coordinate policies as they
seek independence from the Soviet Union. The call was made as

control of its TV and radio, defying the Kremlin.</p>

<p>About 100,000 East Germans protested possible job and

legislature, portrayed a rapidly deteriorating economy.</p>
<p>West German Chancellor Kohl pressed East Germany for
greater flexibility in bargaining over the merger of their

currency can be converted in West German marks.</p>

years ago and which is threatened to be closed.</p>

January, and that he resign.</p>

apartheid.</p>

Americans -- about one of every 100 -- use cocaine at least

Committee said New York leads with one regular user for every
40 residents.</p>
