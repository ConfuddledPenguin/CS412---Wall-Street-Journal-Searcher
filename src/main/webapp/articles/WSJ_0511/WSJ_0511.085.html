	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Commerce Department reduced anti-dumping
duties for cut flowers imported from Colombia.
   Officials said the department had overestimated the extent
to which the imports are "dumped" -- that is sold at prices
below those in the home market or the cost of production --
when it first imposed 4.4% duties in 1987. The duties will
drop to 4.16% on some flowers and to 2.24% on others. The
imports -- mostly carnations, chrysanthemums and pompons --
are valued at about $180 million a year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Colombia has protested that the duties undermine anti-drug
efforts by injuring legitimate farmers. A lawyer for the
Colombian growers said the reduction in the duties "is an
important victory for us."</p>
