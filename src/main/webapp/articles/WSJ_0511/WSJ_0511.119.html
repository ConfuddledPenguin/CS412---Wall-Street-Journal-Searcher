	<p class="article-leader">If you want to draw snickers in the Beltway, just mention
the words "budget reform." For genuine belly laughs, say
"line-item veto." The cognoscenti sniff that it'll "never
happen." Otherwise curious reporters roll their eyes.
   Yet if they're right, why are White House aides
backgrounding that the power to veto individual budget items
is something George Bush really wants? And why has the Senate
Judiciary Committee -- the Joe Biden-Ted Kennedy committee --
passed a line-item veto for the first time in 106 years?
Could "budget reform" be the lynchpin of George Bush's
tax-and-spend summit with Congress? As Mr. Bush likes to say,
let's "read the tea leaves."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For openers, why would a president with a 70% approval
rating suddenly give up his main lever over Congress -- taxes
-- if he doesn't want anything in return? Don't believe the
new White House line about a "budget emergency." (This is
known as "crying Stockman," after the former budget director
who always predicted doom to pressure Congress.) The economy
has actually been healthier of late, and the budget numbers
aren't all that bad. Something else is going on.</p>
<p>George Bush also happened to be in town during the 1980s
for previous budget "summits." He remembers the 1982 accord's
spending cuts that never happened, and 1987's
sweep-it-under-the-rug accord. To believe a Bush "sellout" on
taxes you have to believe that he, Chief of Staff John Sununu
and Treasury Secretary Nick Brady are stupid enough to give
up their party's best political issue without solving the
budget problem. Only the White House press corps could really
believe this.</p>
<p>So the $1.2-trillion question is, what does George want? A
capital gains tax cut and spending cuts, sure, but the big
enchilada would be budget reform. Without what former budget
director Jim Miller calls "an enforcement mechanism" in the
process, spending promises from Congress are as worthless as
rubles. The same old game will continue. If George Bush
didn't know this, why would he endorse hardballers Newt
Gingrich and Phil Gramm as the GOP's lead summit negotiators
from Congress?</p>
<p>Even Dick Darman, the budget director and Beltway
gamesman, is saying how much he wants budget reform. He was
livid at a jibe in this paper's editorial columns that he
doesn't favor the item veto. ("Get rid of those sources,"
said Charmin' Darman.)</p>
<p>Mr. Darman says he likes the item veto, but it isn't
enough. He'd also like a second "sequester," or the automatic
Gramm-Rudman sword that now strikes the budget once each
year. He wants a second sword to fall six months after the
first. Another priority is "credit reform," especially a cap
on federal guarantees for private borrowing. With federal
liabilities running into the trillions of dollars (think S&L
bailout), he's right.</p>
<p>As for the item veto, Mr. Darman's caveat is an old one,
that it wouldn't apply to "mandatory programs," the 50% of
the budget (such as Medicare) automatically spent each year.
But as savvy a player as Mr. Darman should know that simply
getting the president back in the budget game would change
the politics of spending. It would force a better debate
between what is legitimate and what is pork.</p>
<p>That still leaves Congress, but even there the tea leaves
are turning. Senate Judiciary support for the item veto
included liberals Paul Simon of Illinois and Howell Heflin of
Alabama. Sens. Kennedy and Biden voted against the
constitutional amendment, but offered their own statutory
item-veto.</p>
<p>"I think it's worked well in the states," said Mr.
Kennedy, hardly an anti-spending hawk. "I was opposed . . .
when I first came to the Senate, but I do think that the
item-veto is necessary in order to get accountability."</p>
<p>Perhaps this is opportunism, but that's the point. If
liberals are climbing on board, the politics of budget reform
may have changed. Sen. Alan Dixon, the Illinois Democrat
who's followed the issue for years, now says, "the item veto
hasn't been sold right. It's always been sold as a partisan
issue. But I know plenty of moderate Democrats and economic
liberals who see the need for this."</p>
<p>If President Bush makes reform a priority, Mr. Dixon says,
he now has a real chance to get it. And even if it won't fly
as a constitutional amendment, everyone could compromise on a
statutory type of item-veto known as "enhanced rescission." A
version sponsored by Sen. Dan Coats (R., Ind.) last year got
40 votes -- despite the presence of West Virginia's Robert
Byrd, standing like a bouncer in the well of the Senate
watching every vote. Mr. Byrd hates the item-veto because it
would crimp his pork-barrel power as chairman of
appropriations.</p>
<p>Any accord is still a long shot, as this week's uproar
over taxes showed. My own heart's with the anti-taxers, with
the Vin Webers and Lynn Martins urging Mr. Bush to keep his
no-new-tax pledge. My head says the chance to bring some
long-term sanity to federal budgeting is at least worth
negotiating. Marginal income tax rates, the main supply-side
insight, shouldn't be touched. And certainly any agreement
without real budget reform would be a sellout, as even
administration officials privately admit. But there's no
reason Mr. Bush can't walk away, no-new-taxes intact, if he
ends up bargaining with himself.</p>
<p>President Bush has shown he's able to reshuffle the
political cards in a surprising way before (Nicaragua,
capital gains). The old Reagan-era partisan divisions don't
always prevail anymore. What Democrats would never concede to
the Great Communicator, they just might to their fellow
insider.</p>
