	<p class="article-leader">As World War II's Allied powers celebrated the 45th
anniversary of their victory over Nazi Germany this week,
Germans themselves were looking forward to having the war
finally end for them, too. The two Germanys and four Allied
powers are negotiating the restoration of a fully sovereign,
unified Germany. The only remaining obstacles are the 380,000
Soviet occupation troops still on German soil and Moscow's
resistance to the idea of a unified Germany being a part of
the Western NATO alliance.
   Because the settlement of this crucial issue has a direct
bearing on whether Europe can enjoy further long years of
peace, both Europe and the United States are trying to guess
whether Moscow is merely stalling -- as so many Western
optimists insist -- or seriously intends to hang tough on the
troop-withdrawal question. The words and symbolism of
Moscow's Victory Day celebration on Wednesday were by no
means conclusive, but interesting.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The star of the show was a military man, Marshal Dmitri T.
Yazov, Soviet minister of defense. Were it not for that great
panoply of destructive firepower rolling across Red Square
before the Lenin mausoleum reviewing stand, some of the
breast-beating would have been laughable. The lead float, for
example, had a Russian soldier cradling in his arms a female
"Germany," with a broken swastika below them. Today's Germany
should not forget, presumably, that the Russians came as
liberators, not conquerers. That hasn't always been obvious
to Germans.</p>
<p>Marshal Yazov pressed injured innocence even further in a
TV address directed mainly at the Baltic peoples and their
own ingratitude. Freeing them from the Nazis had cost the
lives of 257,000 Soviet soldiers, he declared. He recalled
darkly that many Balts had fought for the Germans.</p>
<p>The view of Russians that the peoples they have
"liberated" owe them a large debt has been imbedded in
communist theology for a long time. It draws emotional
content from the fact that the Soviet Union did indeed suffer
enormous losses during the "Great Patriotic War." By one
count, the war cost some 27 million lives on the Soviet side.</p>
<p>But whatever credibility there ever was to the idea that
the world still owes Russia for its role in subduing the
Nazis nearly a half century ago is wearing thin. The Nazis
are long gone. West Germany, which will dominate a unified
Germany, has had 45 years of democracy.</p>
<p>The Russian anniversary calendar omits some important
dates: Aug. 23, 1939, when the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact was
signed, awarding Stalin Estonia, Latvia, East Poland and a
part of Finland; Sept. 28, when a secret protocol threw
Lithuania into the bargain; Nov. 30, when Soviet troops
invaded Finland and despite valiant Finnish resistance hived
off the southeastern corner of that country; June 15-17,
1940, when Soviet troops occupied Lithuania, Latvia and
Estonia.</p>
<p>Soviet citizens themselves are weary of the old rhetoric.
To be sure, there was no jeering crowd at Wednesday's parade,
as there had been on May Day. But then hardly any crowd at
all showed up for this year's display of Soviet might. Mr.
Yazov's assertion that the Soviet troops in the Baltic states
were not an "army of occupation" must have sounded like a
grim joke in Lithuania, where Moscow's imperial subjects were
at that moment struggling to get a small shipment of medical
supplies through the KGB's blockade at the Polish border.</p>
<p>Given what most Soviet citizens now know about the
Communist Party's true history, it might have been wiser to
tone down the Victory Day rhetoric. Maybe Mr. Gorbachev let
Marshal Yazov do most of the talking to avoid further
embarrassment to himself. But did the party freely yield the
stage, as it often does on Victory Day, or was Marshal Yazov
asserting a claim of the Red Army to a larger role in today's
events, reinforcing that claim by reminding everyone of the
army's glorious past? In asserting the army's right to be in
Lithuania, was he tacitly defending as well its right to be
in Germany?</p>
<p>If so, World War II is not quite over yet, at least from
the Red Army's point of view. Those Westerners who are in
such a hurry to dismantle NATO's defenses and reap that
imaginary "peace dividend" might do well to take the pompous
Soviet marshal more seriously. Those were real tanks, real
rocket launchers and real soldiers marching through Red
Square.</p>
