	<p class="article-leader">FRANKFURT, West Germany -- As desperate East German
officials portrayed a rapidly deteriorating economy, 100,000
East Germans protested for more concessions that could
significantly swell Bonn's outlays for monetary union,
already estimated to reach 60 billion marks ($36.8 billion)
annually.
   East German Premier Lothar de Maiziere told East Berlin's
parliament yesterday that East Germany's budget deficit is
likely to reach a staggering 120 billion West German marks by
the end of this year because of rising welfare costs and
business bankruptcies. At least 1.5 million of East Germany's
8.5 million workers will have to be retrained or face
unemployment by the end of 1991, according to his report.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Guenther Krause, a parliamentary state secretary and a
senior East German negotiator in the monetary union talks,
candidly told parliament that "we slowly have to begin
thinking about who will pay for these 120 billion."</p>
<p>The apparent appeal to Bonn comes as members in the
German-German monetary commission, having agreed on a 1-to-1
mark conversion rate for East German savings and wages, are
at loggerheads over support for East Germany's crumbling
welfare system. The West German mark is scheduled to replace
the East German mark beginning July 2.</p>
<p>Chancellor Helmut Kohl, before the Bonn parliament
yesterday, conceded that East Germany's budget and other
major problems still defied solution, but he said the July 2
date for monetary union remained intact.</p>
<p>In East Berlin, the Party of Democratic Socialism, the
renamed Communist Party, accused Mr. de Maiziere's democratic
government of bowing to Bonn's terms for monetary union by
not demanding a better financial cushion for East German
workers and pensioners. While wages and pensions will be
changed into West German marks at a 1-to-1 rate, East German
wages and pensions are only a third of West German levels,
raising fears of impoverishment when a common German market
arrives.</p>
<p>East Germans also could face a doubling in their rents,
which are heavily subsidized by the state. The uncertainty
boiled over yesterday as workers vented anger over possible
job and housing losses, and farmers blocked major highways to
back demands for continued price subsidies. Most East German
farmers also demand protection from West German competitors,
whom they fear will pour in with well-oiled distribution
systems once the border is opened to unrestricted trade in
July.</p>
<p>Industrial workers downed their tools yesterday in warning
strikes to protest subsidy cutbacks planned as East Germany
shifts from central planning to a free market. Joined in
their strike by East German teachers, the workers fear that
their jobs at archaic plants face extinction in open
competition with the West.</p>
<p>Citing the government study, Mr. Krause, the state
secretary, said only a third of East Germany's industrial
enterprises are expected to be able to compete after monetary
and economic union. More than half are already operating at a
loss, but they could be salvaged with subsidies. The
remaining 14% face imminent bankruptcy, the report said.</p>
<p>East German enterprises have a combined debt to the state
of about 260 billion East German marks. Monetary union
negotiators are still wrangling over how -- and by whom --
the sum is to be settled after July, when impoverished East
German enterprises will have to service their debt in hard
West German marks.</p>
