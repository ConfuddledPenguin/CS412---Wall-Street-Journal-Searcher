	<p class="article-leader">George J. Borjas ("The U.S. Takes the Wrong Immigrants,"
editorial page, April 5) is certainly right that the U.S.
could select immigrants who would make even greater economic
contributions than does our current system. And it is worth
his saying that most immigrants get admitted as relatives of
U.S. residents rather than because of their merits. But Mr.
Borjas's article also leaves some unfortunate and incorrect
impressions, and invites dangerous misinterpretation.
   It is easy to infer from the article that less-skilled
immigrants have a negative economic effect. But nothing in
Mr. Borjas's recent book shows that to be true. He shows only
that they make a less positive contribution than the more
skilled.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>He writes that the immigrants from some countries are less
productive than those from others. To some readers this will
suggest that the U.S. should discriminate on the basis of
origin. But discrimination on the basis of education would
accomplish exactly the same effect.</p>
<p>Mr. Borjas also writes that the immigrants from some
countries are more likely to be on welfare than others. Here
his data are unsound because they do not hold constant the
length of time in the country. It is not informative that
immigrants from Germany who came on average many years ago
are better off than recent immigrants from Vietnam.</p>
<p>More generally, focusing on origins, or even on
characteristics of individuals, fosters divisiveness and
directs attention away from the key social decision -- the
total number of immigrants admitted. A meaningful increase in
the total number would have a more beneficial effect than
almost any conceivable alteration in the selection system.</p>
<p>Mr. Borjas also says, "Including illegals, more immigrants
were admitted during the 1980s than in any other decade in
American history." From 1901 to 1910, 8.8 million immigrants
arrived. In the 1980s, 5.9 million immigrants arrived
legally. For the recent flow to be even as large as the
earlier flow, the number of illegal entrants would have to be
larger than experts (e.g. Robert Warren, head of statistics
for INS and a reliable student of the subject) estimate it
could be.</p>
<p>But even if the flow now were historically larger, so
what? What matters is the flow relative to our population
size, and that more immigrants are good rather than bad for
us -- all kinds of immigrants. The most important change we
can make is to allow more to come.</p>

<p>Prof. Borjas clearly had my parents in mind. My father
came from Russia in 1919, my mother from Poland the next
year. Neither had a pair of shoes when they arrived. My
father was one of nine children, my mother one of 11. My
mother never learned to write English, but she could handle
movie magazines by the time she was 40. We lived in back of a
candy store in Hoboken, N.J., where I became interested in
foreign languages by learning to say "Please don't hit me
again]" in six of them.</p>
<p>Our house, which was one large room, had no books, no
records, no signs of intellectual commitment. My parents were
poor, ignorant and never spent a minute in an American school
of any kind. Given Prof. Borjas's standards, they would not
be welcomed to America, nor would their children represent
any particular dividend for this country. This pair of
completely unskilled and uneducated immigrants, however, had
something in them that will never appear in any statistical
analysis of what makes a "right" or "wrong" immigrant. There
are characteristics and values that cannot be charted. This
illiterate woman could read a report card somehow, and I will
never forget the pain of disappointment when she did not see
the letters she wanted, nor the knot in my stomach when she
said, "Your brother did better."</p>
