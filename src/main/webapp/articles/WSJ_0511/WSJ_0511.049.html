	<p class="article-leader">"Sweet La-La Land" (Poseidon Press, 270 pages, $18.95) is
the third and most satisfying yet of Robert Campbell's
"La-La" novels, all of which feature a shopworn private eye
named Whistler. A former local television performer and
recovering alcoholic, Whistler keeps office hours at a coffee
shop near Hollywood and Vine, where he can watch "the herd of
users, losers and the lost" parading along the hookers'
promenade.
   At the start of this entry, Whistler spots an old flame
named Faye on that tawdry avenue. Fifteen years ago, Faye
left Whistler for Daniel "Inch" Younger, a strange-eyed
Appalachian later convicted of a series of grisly Los Angeles
murders. When Younger was imprisoned, Faye moved out of
state. Eventually she left her and Younger's four-year-old
son with Younger's Kentucky kin, who sold him. Faye took off
on a drunken solo odyssey. Sober now and back in Hollywood,
Faye is running a shelter for runaways, rescuing children
from the seedy streets. Whistler, dreaming of a new life with
Faye, offers to find her child, the boy she abandoned 11
years ago.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Unbeknownst to Faye and Whistler, the seething Younger is
about to be paroled. Also unbeknownst to all, Faye and
Younger's son has made his way to La-La Land and joined the
army of youngsters hawking their bodies along the sleazy
boulevards.</p>
<p>Coincidence looms nearly large enough in "Sweet La-La
Land" to be a major character, but such is the spell cast by
Mr. Campbell's tough-poetic prose that any
"Hey-wait-a-minute" readers' objections are postponed until
after the book is done. Meanwhile, the plot is propelled by a
number of chance encounters and missed opportunities.</p>
<p>Whistler's point of view is only one of many through which
the narrative unfolds. Among the low-lifes and high-fliers
encountered are Paul Hobby, a scummy B-movie mogul who once
employed Younger and who may have something to fear from his
release; Eve Choyren, "the most notorious thrill merchant in
town," who titillates her johns and janes with diabolic
rites; and Pig-Nose Dopoley, a Hollywood hanger-on and
possible contract killer. Among Whistler's recurring retinue
are Bosco Silverlake, the one-armed coffee shop
counterman-philosopher; and Isaac Canaan, the juvenile-vice
cop who's kept his compassion because or in spite of having
seen too much depravity.</p>
<p>Another writer working some of the same Southern
California turf is Timothy Hallinan, whose "Everything But
the Squeal" (New American Library, 341 pages, $17.95) is the
second suspense novel to feature Los Angeles private
investigator Simeon Grist. This outing begins with Grist
haunting the all-night Hollywood food stands favored by
kiddie whores and their pimps, in search of a runaway teen
from Kansas named Aimee.</p>
<p>Mr. Hallinan's book, more orthodox than Mr. Campbell's, is
narrated in traditional wisecracking private eye first
person. The dialogue is snappy, the pace is brisk, and there
are nice descriptions. Here Grist contrasts the clientele at
two diner dives: "The drugs of choice in Tommy's are downers,
mainly codeine and other painkillers, but at Jack's nobody
screws around with anything you don't enjoy at the sharp
point of a needle. . . . The other difference is that the
boys and girls at Tommy's sometimes say no. . . . At Jack's,
`Just say no' is a punch line."</p>
<p>The most memorable youngsters encountered in this book are
not street kids but children of privilege: Aurora, the older
sister of the runaway Grist is hunting; Jessica, Grist's
smart-mouthed goddaughter; and Morris, an awkward computer
whiz. These three come very close to stealing the show.</p>
<p>Grist holds his own, though, as he uncovers the sordid
details of a child prostitution and pornography ring that
uses a talent agency as its front. "Squeal" combines
high-octane action, baroque violence, humor and pathos in a
self-assured manner that marks Mr. Hallinan as a capable new
practitioner of the private eye tale.</p>
<p>Henry Rios, the homosexual Hispanic lawyer featured in the
suspense novels of Michael Nava, also encounters pedophilia
and kiddie porn in his latest case. Rios is based in Los
Angeles, but in "How Town" (Harper & Row, 244 pages, $16.95)
the attorney returns to Los Robles, the Northern California
city where he was raised, to defend a fellow native son
charged with murdering a pornography merchant. Paul Windsor,
the accused, has a history of molesting underage females.
There are those in Los Robles (including Windsor) who think a
homosexual lawyer should have a special affinity with a
heterosexual child molester, but Rios is quick to set them
straight, as it were.</p>
<p>There isn't all that much detection in "How Town." The
puzzle pieces fall into place without too much fuss, but
there are some good courtroom scenes. Mr. Nava's lively
accounts of legal maneuvering have an authoritative ring. And
this book like those discussed above, achieves added
resonance through showing the ways (not all of them criminal
in the judicial sense) that children are often turned into
victims by the elders who are supposed to protect them.</p>
