	<p class="article-leader">Detroit -- Lou Whitaker and Alan Trammell, the Detroit
Tigers' second base-shortstop combination, broke into the
major leagues together on Sept. 9, 1977, in the second game
of a double-header against Boston at Fenway Park. They
remember it as though it were yesterday.
   "Lou and I were brought up from Montgomery in Double A,
and put in against the Red Sox a couple days later," recalls
Trammell. "We each had hits our first times up. Reggie
Cleveland was the Boston pitcher."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Yeah, we did real good that game," Whitaker grins in a
separate interview minutes later. "We got hits right away off
Louie Tiant. Great way to start, huh?"</p>
<p>I looked it up, and Mr. Cleveland started on the mound for
Boston on that far-off afternoon, so score one for Trammell
in the historical-accuracy department. Tiant was the much
better of the two pitchers, though, so you have to admit that
Whitaker's story was better. Give him a point for theatrics.</p>
<p>Things have had a way of evening out for Trammell, aged
32, and Whitaker, who'll turn 33 tomorrow. Both came up as
twiggy 160-pounders and fleshed out into gen-u-ine long-ball
threats at the plate. Both have lost, maybe, a step in the
field from their salad days but have made up for it in guile.</p>
<p>Their career batting statistics going into this season
were so similar that it was almost spooky. Trammell had 1,759
hits, including 138 home runs, in 1,689 games, and a batting
average of .286. Whitaker's average was .276 on 1,7l9 hits in
1,695 games, with 149 homers. Each had the same number of
runs batted in -- 721.</p>
<p>Their main distinction, however, has been in their
longevity at their demanding positions afield. Their
13-season tenure as the Tigers' double-play combo has been
the major leagues' longest, eclipsing the 11-year run of
Johnny Evers and Joe Tinker with the old Chicago Cubs
(1902-12), and the 10 years in which Davey Lopes and Bill
Russell played together for the Los Angeles Dodgers
(1972-81).</p>
<p>Whether Trammell and Whitaker will end up being judged
among the best at what they do remains to be seen. Nellie Fox
and Luis Aparicio (Chicago White Sox, 1956-62) probably were
the slickest-fielding pair at the positions, while Joe Morgan
and Dave Concepcion, of the 1972-79 Cincinnati Reds, get the
nod as the best all around.</p>
<p>Tiger manager Sparky Anderson managed at Cincinnati during
some of the Morgan-Concepcion years. Believing that
comparisons make enemies, he resists measuring his present
duo against his late greats. "Whitaker has a better throwing
arm than Morgan did, I will say that. But will Lou get
elected to the Hall of Fame the first year he's eligible,
like Joe? I'd better not guess," demurs Sparky.</p>
<p>Alex Grammas, a Tiger coach who was a pretty fair
shortstop in his day, is more expansive. "There've been
flashier pairs around than Alan and Lou, but few as solid,"
he says. "They're both complete ballplayers who make the
plays they're supposed to make, and they play to win. You
can't ask for more than that."</p>
<p>That is compliment enough for Trammell, who notes that he
and his keystone partner might have been brought to the
majors a trifle before they were ready. "I'd had just two
seasons in the minors, and Lou was a third baseman until they
put us together at Montgomery in '77," he says. "I don't
think anybody ever took as many groundballs in practice as we
did our last season in Montgomery or our first year in
Detroit."</p>
<p>"I could handle the straight stuff at second right away,
but the double play was something else," Whitaker testifies.
"It took me awhile to figure out that I couldn't watch the
bag and the ball at the same time, and that after I'd made my
play, I'd better get out of the way."</p>
<p>But work out the double play they did, until Trammell says
they now can perform it "without looking." Well, maybe.
Getting the hang of hitting big-league pitching was a
lonelier business and took a bit longer. At least for one of
them.</p>
<p>"Some people said we'd never be hitters, but they must
have meant Alan, because I always knew I could hit," says
Lou. Uh-huh.</p>
<p>But hit they did, and then some. After posting averages of
.268 and .276 his first two seasons, Trammell batted an even
.300 in his third year and has topped that four times since,
led by a .343 mark in 1987. In the 1984 World Series, in
which the Tigers beat San Diego in five games, he went nine
for 20 at the plate with two home runs and six RBIs and was
named the Series' most-valuable player.</p>
<p>Whitaker batted a career-high .320 in 1983, and has
averaged 20 home runs and 69 RBIs a season over the last five
campaigns. Last year, he led the Tigers in homers with 28 and
RBIs with 85. In 1983, '84 and '85, he won the American
League Golden Glove and Silver Slugger awards for being the
best defensive and offensive player at his position. Trammell
has won two Silver Sluggers and four Golden Gloves, but never
both in one season.</p>
<p>There have been rumors, whispered and published, that
Trammell and Whitaker don't get along off the field. They
deny them. "We roomed together on the road for four years,"
Alan points out. Whitaker notes that the two have
side-by-side lockers in the Tigers' dressing room, and, thus,
chat frequently. "Hey] Sometimes I get his mail, and he gets
mine," he smiles.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they say, there's no rivalry between them.
"None at all. Why should there be?" asks Lou. "Of course,
he's hit .300 five times and I've just done it once, and he's
stolen more bases, but I've hit more homers, and I've got
four kids and he has three, and . . .."</p>
<p>However they want to play it is fine with manager
Anderson, as long as they keep playing. His Tigers fell to a
59-103 won-lost mark last year after 11 winning seasons and
need all the help they can get. "I hope they go five more
years and get 1,000 more hits each," says Sparky. "That'd be
one less problem for me."</p>
