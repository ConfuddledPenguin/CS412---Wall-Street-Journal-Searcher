	<p class="article-leader">YOUNG HARRIS, Ga. -- The campus of Young Harris College
gleams as Lt. Gov. Zell Miller comes home to announce he is
running for governor. Watching the show unfold is the man who
scripted it -- James Carville, 45 years old, a onetime altar
boy in a Louisiana leper-colony chapel and now a top
Democratic political consultant.
   The man they call "the ragin' Cajun" is on his best
behavior, hoping to paint a pretty portrait of his candidate
for the reporters and TV crews who have come to this little
town in the mountains. Not so long ago, candidates were
allowed this sort of shining moment without fear of ambush.
But one of Mr. Carville's opponents -- Frank Greer, 43, who
is working for former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young -- is going
to ruin Mr. Carville's nice day.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Greer has come up with a proposal to put a $1 million
cap on the amount a candidate can spend on TV ads. He has
primed the reporters here in Young Harris with the news. And
they aren't interested in Mr. Carville's pretty pictures.
"What about the cap?" they demand.</p>
<p>Of course, Mr. Miller won't agree to a million-dollar cap.
He's raised more money than anyone else. But he can't say so.
He fudges. "We rained a little on that parade, didn't we?"
Mr. Greer chortles.</p>
<p>But Mr. Carville plots revenge. The next day, his
candidate accuses Mr. Young of responsibility for an
"explosion of crime" in Atlanta, charging that he wants to
"run away" from the issue of drugs.</p>
<p>Politics, as they say, ain't beanbag, and political
consulting is a business that has never won prizes for
congeniality. But now a new generation is taking over the
business -- a generation that is, if anything, meaner and
tougher than ever before. It is a generation whose aprroach
is exemplified by one of Mr. Carville's favorite sayings:
"It's hard for somebody to hit you when you've got your fist
in their face."</p>
<p>"We move faster," says Don Sipple, one of the emerging
stars working Republican campaigns. "A few years ago, you'd
see five or six separate scenes in a 30-second spot. Now you
see 14. We work more with mood and music. We try to create an
impression to leave with viewers. We don't care so much about
the written word in an era when personalities are more
important than issues."</p>
<p>But what Mr. Sipple and his peers do best is counterpunch.
Hit any of these people with a negative ad and you get hit
back, in a matter of hours, with a succession of body blows.
In their own perverse way, these new-generation consultants
may be part of the solution to negative campaigning. That's
because practitioners of the negative advertising arts --
frequently the old pros -- may be forced to think twice
before launching negative blitzes against these tyros.</p>
<p>Mr. Carville and Mr. Greer, going head to head here in
Georgia, are prototypical new-generation consultants, though
vastly different in style, personal beliefs and background.</p>
<p>With the saturnine Mr. Carville, almost always turned out
in sharply creased blue jeans, politics is something of a
game. "Campaigning is largely bull----," he says. He thinks
media pundits, such as the Washington Post's David Broder,
who call for a return to strict accounting and serious
discussion of "the issues" take it too seriously. Yet Mr.
Carville takes his own work seriously enough.</p>
<p>He likes to think of himself as the man who takes
unexciting underdogs as clients and wins exciting victories
over superstars. His client in Pennsylvania in 1986 was a
Scranton Democrat, Robert Casey, who had run for governor
three times before and never gotten past the primary. His
opponent was William W. Scranton, son of a popular governor
and almost everybody's favorite to pick up his father's old
job. (The town is named for his family.)</p>
<p>Mr. Scranton had vowed he wouldn't run a negative
campaign, but his campaign sent out 600,000 pieces of mail
attacking Mr. Casey's ethics. Mr. Carville says he heard
about the mailing when he came back to campaign headquarters
from the movies. "It was my 42nd birthday and the movie was
`Peggy Sue Got Married' and I was still in tears and we were
eight points down in the polls with 10 days to go."</p>
<p>Mr. Carville began counterpunching. He called reporters
and told them the mailer was outrageous. They wrote stories.
Mr. Scranton replied, lamely, that he didn't know about the
mailing. So Mr. Carville ordered 600,000 blank envelopes,
loaded them up on a truck -- mountains of envelopes -- and
dumped them on a street corner near Mr. Scranton's campaign
headquarters. "The TV cameras were rolling as we asked, `How
could you send out this many envelopes and not know about
it?'"</p>
<p>Mr. Carville is at Mr. Casey's side again this year, when
the governor will be under attack for his strong
anti-abortion position. It will be one of the most closely
watched contests in the nation.</p>
<p>In 1988, Mr. Carville handled New Jersey Sen. Frank
Lautenberg, dull but very rich, who was opposed by Republican
Pete Dawkins, football star, Rhodes scholar, Army general,
Wall Street manager -- a walking, talking resume.</p>
<p>Mr. Carville believes in focus groups, small collections
of registered voters brought together by trained interviewers
to discuss issues and react to candidates. "We showed them TV
footage of Dawkins saying things like, of all places he'd
lived he'd never known any place so full of promise as our
own Garden State. They all fell off their chairs laughing.
Maybe they like New Jersey enough, but they thought that was
ridiculous. And they all knew Dawkins had moved to New Jersey
to run for the Senate and if he'd said so it wouldn't have
been so bad.</p>
<p>"All we did was run a TV commercial with Dawkins saying
these things for 21 straight seconds. We ended it with the
kicker, `Come on, Pete, be real.' We took a poll afterwards
and he was gone. I mean, you could stick a fork through him
and he was done."</p>
<p>Mr. Carville likes lap-top computers. He stuffs them full
of data about his own candidate, about the opponent and
anything else he can think of. In New Jersey, he sent his
right-hand man, Paul Begala, off to Mr. Dawkins' news
conferences. At one of them, Mr. Dawkins charged Sen.
Lautenberg was ducking a debate.</p>
<p>Mr. Begala searched through his little Zenith and came up
with a letter Sen. Lautenberg had already sent to Mr. Dawkins
asking for a debate. Mr. Begala printed out copies of the
letter and hand-delivered them to reporters. Before the news
conference was over, they were on their feet, asking such
questions as, "But, Mr. Dawkins, didn't Sen. Lautenberg
challenge you to a debate several months ago and you failed
to respond?"</p>
<p>All that was easy pickings compared to this year's race
here in Georgia, where Mr. Carville is up against Mr. Greer,
another of the new breed of consultants. Mr. Greer helped
make Virginia's Douglas Wilder the nation's first elected
black governor last year; if he gets his way, former Mayor
Young will be the second.</p>
<p>Mr. Greer got his start in politics as press secretary in
Fred Harris' quixotic presidential campaign in 1972. He's
more idealistic than Mr. Carville about what he does. "I
believe deeply in the democratic process," he says. But he
also believes in counterpunching. "The best way to deal with
negative advertising is to make it an issue,"he says. "Stand
up and fight. You must make those who use it pay a price."</p>
<p>Last year in Virginia, Mr. Greer and his candidate, Mr.
Wilder, were opposed by wily veteran Republican operative
Robert Goodman and his candidate, Marshall Coleman, winner of
an especially nasty GOP primary. Mr. Goodman struck hard with
a 30-second spot charging that Mr. Wilder, as a member of the
state senate, voted against a bill calling for the death
penalty for killing a police officer. Mr. Greer, who had
anticipated the attack, had his response ready to go -- but
had to wait impatiently for another 24 hours to give the
Coleman attack time to register with the voters.</p>
<p>Then he struck back with an ad that intoned: "Marshall
Coleman has launched another vicious negative ad campaign of
distortion and false facts. This time, he won't get away with
it. The fact is, Doug Wilder supports the death penalty for
the killing of a police officer."</p>
<p>Actually, the Goodman ad was accurate: Mr. Wilder had
voted against such a bill 12 years earlier. "They were trying
to suggest the guy still opposes the death penalty for
killing police officers," says Mr. Greer. "That's wrong." In
the welter of charge and countercharge, Mr. Goodman never
said the vote was 12 years old and Mr. Greer never admitted
Mr. Wilder had changed his mind.</p>
<p>"I've got to hand it" to Mr. Greer, says Mr. Goodman.
"That's fast turnaround. He's got an interesting technique.
He doesn't answer the ad. What he does is call you a liar.
It's very effective."</p>
