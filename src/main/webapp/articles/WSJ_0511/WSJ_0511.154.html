	<p class="article-leader">The automobile group Peugeot S.A. said in Paris that its
consolidated revenue rose to 44.14 billion francs ($8.02
billion) in the first quarter from 40.92 billion ($7.44
billion) in the comparable 1989 period.
   Peugeot said the 8% overall advance was led by its
Automobiles Citroen unit, which recorded a 13% sales gain to
16.84 billion francs. Sales by the group's other main car
unit, Automobiles Peugeot, climbed only 4%, to 25.42 billion
francs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The group said the slower sales growth for Automobiles
Peugeot reflected flooding problems at its plant in Sochaux
in February. It added that the floods trimmed production by
about 12,000 units and said that delay is currently being
made up.</p>
<p>Peugeot didn't report comparable earnings figures for the
first quarter. For all of 1989, the group reported
consolidated net profit of 10.30 billion francs after
payments to minority interests. Revenue was 152.96 billion
francs.</p>
