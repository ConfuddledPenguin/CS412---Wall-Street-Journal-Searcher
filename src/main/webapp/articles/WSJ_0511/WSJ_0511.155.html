	<p class="article-leader">BASF AG said group pretax profit slipped 6.6% in the first
quarter, as a stronger mark and lower product prices
depressed the group's profit margins.
   Earnings at West Germany's largest chemical concern
slipped to 845 million marks ($516.8 million) from 905
million marks a year earlier. Group sales were little
changed, easing to 11.89 billion marks from 11.97 billion
marks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Chairman Hans Albers said the rise of the mark against the
dollar, yen and pound depressed revenue after conversion into
marks. If currency rates had remained steady, first-quarter
profit would have been up from a year earlier, he said at a
news conference.</p>
<p>Another negative factor was product prices, which fell
significantly from a year-earlier level because of a buildup
of global production capacity and stronger competition, he
said.</p>
<p>Despite slower growth, "we don't see a profound period of
weakness for chemicals approaching," Mr. Albers said. He
added that he hopes BASF will be able to match its 1989
record results this year, but he declined to make a specific
forecast.</p>
