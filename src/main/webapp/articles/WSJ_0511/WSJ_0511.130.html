	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- A television station here said Procter & Gamble
Co. canceled its ads at the station after it broadcast an
advertisement urging consumers to boycott P&G's Folgers
coffee.
   The ad was produced by Neighbor to Neighbor, a national
organization based in San Francisco that advocates ending
U.S. investments in El Salvador. The group also is urging
consumers to boycott coffee made of beans grown in El
Salvador.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The ad ends with an upturned coffee cup spilling what
appears to be blood and urges viewers to boycott Folgers. A
local branch of Neighbor to Neighbor paid Boston's WHDH-TV, a
CBS affiliate, $1,000 to run the ad, said Sy Yanoff,
president of the station.</p>
<p>"We looked at the ad, and it met our standards for
commercial advertisements," Mr. Yanoff said. He added that a
P&G official called the station Wednesday to discuss the
Neighbor to Neighbor ad but didn't say the company planned to
pull its ads.</p>
<p>Then yesterday, "our representative in New York called and
said P&G just canceled all its current ads at our station,"
Mr. Yanoff said. He added that P&G spends about $1 million
annually on ads at the station.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Cincinnati-based consumer products
firm, confirming that P&G had canceled its ads, said the
Neighbor to Neighbor commercial is "highly offensive." It
attacks P&G and Folgers, "and that's not the type of ad
environment we want for our ads."</p>
