	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Honda Motor Co., the upstart auto maker that made
success look easy during the 1980s, named its former head of
research and development, Nobuhiko Kawamoto, to lead the
company into the turbulent climate of the 1990s.
   Mr. Kawamoto, 54 years old, won a two-man race with a
senior managing director, Shoichiro Irimajiri, to succeed
Tadashi Kume, 58, who has been at Honda's helm since 1983.
Mr. Kume said he decided to step aside to an emeritus role as
director and advisor to allow a "new generation" to take over
in "a new era." His move is also in line with Honda's
tradition of executives retiring in their late 50s. Mr.
Kawamoto will become Honda's fourth president and the first
not to have been trained directly by company founder Soichiro
Honda.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Some insiders had thought that Mr. Irimajiri, who made his
mark as head of Honda's highly successful U.S. manufacturing
operations during the mid-1980s, would get the top job.
Instead, Mr. Irimajiri will become one of two executive vice
presidents and a representative director. He will be in
charge of world-wide production and research and development.</p>
<p>The other executive vice president is Yoshihide Munekuni,
who will be in charge of sales and marketing. Mr. Munekuni,
currently a senior managing director, is also head of Honda
operations in North America, a post he's held since last
year.</p>
<p>In addition, Honda named Koichiro Yoshizawa, 58, as
chairman, a post in which he will act as an advisor to the
new management. Mr. Yoshizawa, currently executive vice
president, finance, marketing and sales, was considered the
No. 2 man under Mr. Kume.</p>
<p>Mr. Kawamoto, who takes over on June 28, said in a short
speech that he and Messrs. Irimajiri and Munekuni will "make
a formidable team, mutually fostering our strengths toward
moving Honda into the future." A company spokesman in the
U.S. described the three as a "triumvirate."</p>
<p>Honda's corporate culture does emphasize teamwork. The
executive suite in Honda's Tokyo headquarters is an open
room, and the company has a history of being managed by two
strong top executives. But a three-man executive team is a
first for the company, analysts said.</p>
<p>Mr. Kawamoto and his team will inherit the challenge of
improving on Honda's phenomenal success of the past decade at
a time when competition in the major auto markets of the
world, particularly in the U.S., is more intense than at any
time since World War II.</p>
<p>"I don't think that every Japanese manufacturer that
builds cars in the U.S. will pass the test," Mr. Kawamoto
observed in an interview last fall. "Not everyone will go up
and up."</p>
<p>So far, Honda continues to do well in the U.S., its
largest market. The company is closing in on its goal of
outselling No. 3 U.S. auto maker Chrysler Corp. in the
passenger-car market. The Honda Accord was the best-selling
car in the U.S. last year and has a strong chance to repeat
this year. A second U.S. car assembly plant recently started
producing Civic models.</p>
<p>This fall, Honda will launch its first model designed in
the U.S., the Accord station wagon. That car is important
because it could help capture families who want a minivan or
a midsized wagon, but have had to go elsewhere because Honda
doesn't offer such vehicles. Honda also is expected to unveil
this fall a redesigned version of its Acura Legend luxury
sedan and a new two-seat sports car, the Acura NS-X, designed
to be a limited-edition flagship model selling for $50,000 or
more.</p>
<p>But these advances aren't coming easily.</p>
<p>For the nine months ended Dec. 31, 1989, Honda's
consolidated net income fell 24.4% from a year earlier,
despite increased sales in Japan and abroad. Honda has
recently started picking up market share in Japan, but it
still lacks the clout and financial muscle of archrivals
Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co.</p>
<p>Toyota once trailed Honda in U.S. car sales. But through
April, Toyota has sold more cars in the U.S. than Honda or
Chrysler. And the Big Three U.S. auto makers also are taking
aim at Honda after watching the relatively small company grab
not only market share but leadership in product design and
quality.</p>
<p>Mr. Kawamoto acknowledged last fall that Honda faces major
external and internal challenges.</p>
<p>"We have been a trend setter among Japanese auto makers.
Others have been following," he said. "But now the pace of
following is becoming much quicker."</p>
<p>What's more, Honda's rapid growth during the 1980s has
created a problem unheard of during the company's
entrepreneurial scuffling days: bureaucracy. "We are becoming
a little stiff," Mr. Kawamoto worried. "We are trying to
reorganize to keep our flexibility."</p>
<p>Mr. Kawamoto's rise at Honda mirrors that of his
predecessor, Mr. Kume, and places him squarely in the
tradition of the engineer-executive who founded the company.
In 1970, Mr. Kawamoto became chief engineer at Honda R&D Co.,
the auto maker's research and development operation. By 1976,
he was the R&D arm's director, and in 1986 he became its
president. Mr. Kume followed virtually the same path during
the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
<p>Early in his career, Mr. Kawamoto distinguished himself
with his work on the CVCC engine -- the first engine of any
maker to meet U.S. clean-air standards and the breakthrough
that put Honda on the map in the U.S.</p>
<p>Mr. Kawamoto, who still likes to draw engines at home in
his free time and is an avid collector of vintage sports
cars, also pioneered Honda's re-entry into the Formula One
Grand Prix auto-racing program during the 1980s. Far more
than a marketing effort, Honda uses racing as both a training
ground for engineers and a testing arena for new technology
aimed at mass-market vehicles.</p>
<p>"Honda has always emphasized innovation and products,"
says Neil Doying, an auto analyst at Baring Securities
(Japan) Ltd. "Keeping with the engineering tradition should
be good for the company."</p>
