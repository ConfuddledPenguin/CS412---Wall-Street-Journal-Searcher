	<p class="article-leader">American Savings Bank acknowledged that it had liquidated
its $400 million junkbond portfolio since the end of 1989,
concluding an embarrassing episode that may have cost the
otherwise healthy thrift $100 million or more.
   American, which was acquired in December 1988 by Texas
financier Robert Bass with government assistance, went on a
Texas-size buying spree for junk bonds last spring and
summer, only to have Congress ban thrift ownership of the
bonds as part of the thrift bailout law in August. At its
peak, American's portfolio totaled about $493 million, making
it one of the top 10 thrift holders of junk.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"This was probably the most ill-timed major junk-bond
ventures of anybody I could remember. The timing could not
have been worse," said Kenneth Thomas, a Miami thrift analyst
and consultant.</p>
<p>A spokesman for American, based in Stockton, Calif., said
the portfolio had all been sold by the end of April. He
declined to estimate the financial effect of the sales and
had no further comment.</p>
<p>In February, American disclosed that it set aside $65
million in reserves for junk-bond losses in the fourth
quarter and said its junk-bond holdings at year end had been
reduced to $400 million.</p>
<p>A person close to American said there was "some additional
loss, though not huge numbers" subsequent to year end. The
person said American "did better than most" in selling its
bonds but still suffered.</p>
<p>"Obviously, in hindsight, everybody would have preferred
to invest in something better," the person said.</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas, the analyst, estimated that losses totaled in
the range of $125 million, or about 25% of the portfolio at
its peak, based on prevailing market prices for junk in
recent months.</p>
<p>The episode is more of a public-relations disaster than a
financial one for American, whose 1989 financial results made
it the most profitable large thrift in the country. American
had about $16.3 billion in assets at year end. The losses
could also spark new criticism of regulators for permitting
the junk-bond purchases after the 1988 rescue, analysts said.</p>
<p>"This was clearly their most dramatic mistake so far as
their investment in that bank," Mr. Thomas said of the Bass
family stake in American. "Everything else seems to have gone
very well. They are fortunate they have the capital strength
to get out of it."</p>
<p>Most large thrifts who took the plunge on junk bonds
haven't been so lucky, with many having failed or in imminent
danger of doing so. The largest thrift purchaser, Columbia
Savings & Loan Association of Beverly Hills, Calif., which
once held roughly $4.5 billion in junk, is currently
insolvent and is considered a federal takeover candidate.</p>
