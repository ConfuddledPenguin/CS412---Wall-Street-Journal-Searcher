	<p class="article-leader">Hershey Foods Corp. signed a definitive agreement to sell
its 17% equity stake in AB Marabou, a Swedish confectionary
company, to Orkla Borregaard A.S. for more than $75 million.
Orkla is a Norwegian concern with interests in consumer
packaged goods, chemicals and communications.
   The Hershey, Pa., company said it expects the sale to
result in a one-time aftertax gain of more than $35 million,
or 39 cents a share. The gain from the sale, which requires
approval from the Swedish and Norwegian governments, will
most likely be applied to second-quarter results, said a
company spokesman.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Freia AS, a major Norwegian shareholder of Marabou, is in
the midst of a tender offer for those shares of Marabou it
doesn't own. The spokesman said Hershey decided not to tender
its shares because Orkla offered about $12 million more for
the food company's stake, which carries 20% of the voting
rights. "It's called maximizing shareholder value," he said.</p>
