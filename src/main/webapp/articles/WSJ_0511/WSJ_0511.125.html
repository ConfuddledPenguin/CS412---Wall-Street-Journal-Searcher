	<p class="article-leader">The Jim Wright and Keating Five scandals have revealed how
some Members of Congress deepened the Savings and Loan crisis
by intervening with federal regulators on behalf of suspect
thrifts. Federal agencies keep thorough records of their
contacts with private lobbyists and officials from the
executive branch, but Congress has long resisted any such
records of calls that they or their staff make on behalf of
constituents.
   However, Congress's role in the S&L disaster made it
impossible for Members to block plans by the three federal
agencies charged with regulating the thrift bailout to begin
logging contacts with Congress. Last month, the St.
Petersburg Times of Florida reported that at least 25 members
or aides had contacted thrift regulators by phone or mail
since last August.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Many of the contacts were routine inquiries, but other
interventions were attempts to obtain a desired result from
officials.</p>
<p>Senator J. Bennett Johnston personally called the Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency last year to ask that it
delay plans to shut down the Security National Bank of
Shreveport, Louisiana. A week later regulators closed the
bank citing its unsafe lending practices and poor management.
Deputy Comptroller Frank Maguire said he viewed Senator
Johnston's request as "improper."</p>
<p>Last December, an aide to Senator Tom Harkin "repeatedly
suggested" a legal precedent by which regulators could drop a
lawsuit against an Iowa bank. After he was told the precedent
was not relevant, the aide "persisted" in pressing for the
lawsuit to be dropped.</p>
<p>Senator Orrin Hatch twice asked Bill Seidman, head of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., to drop plans for a lawsuit
against directors of a Utah bank. "It would mean a lot to
me," Senator Hatch wrote. "I know you will do what is right."
The interesting thing about this case is that aides to Mr.
Hatch told the Times he sent the letters, "knowing full well
they would be made public." Public disclosure doesn't
automatically put such interventions beyond question, but it
at least gets these activities out in the open where it's
possible to make distinctions.</p>
<p>Under the current, non-public system, even Members charged
with seeing that regulators perform properly have no qualms
about intervening in cases when they have a direct interest.
The Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call reported last month that
in 1986, Kentucky Rep. Carroll Hubbard, chairman of the
banking subcommittee on oversight and investigations, asked
thrift regulator Ed Gray to provide financial assistance for
First Federal, a Kentucky S&L for which Rep. Hubbard admitted
he had done "substantial legal work."</p>
<p>"This institution is special to me for many reasons," he
wrote in a letter to Mr. Gray. "Some of my closest friends in
my hometown are on the board of directors or are employed at
First Federal."</p>
<p>Federal regulators need to be watched. They make mistakes
and they have the power to wreak havoc on the lives of
private citizens. It is no answer, however, to say that the
proper balance against this potential danger is an
intervening Congress that is itself immune from some system
of checks on its power. After all, it was Congress's actions
in the first place that led to the clumsy S&L bailout that
many of them are so worried about. At the least, all federal
agencies should be allowed to keep public logs of their
contacts with Members or their staffs. Voters then could
judge when their elected representatives are performing
legitimate oversight and when they're simply twisting arms
for special interests.</p>
