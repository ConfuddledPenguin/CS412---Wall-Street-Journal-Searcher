	<p class="article-leader">WHAT HAPPENS to coronary risk as the cholesterol count
goes up? It depends on where it was to begin with, how much
it goes up -- and what kind of cholesterol is involved.
   Coronary-artery disease is rare in populations with an
average of 150 milligrams of total cholesterol per deciliter
of blood, a level that researchers consider the practical
ideal. (The U.S. average, according to one study: 218
milligrams.)</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The incidence of coronary disease rises fairly slowly as
cholesterol moves toward 200. Above that level, however, the
incidence begins to curve upward sharply, and at 240
milligrams the curve gets even steeper. This means that a
large number of Americans are already at high risk. Up to one
in four of them has a cholesterol count above 240.</p>
<p>One major complicating factor: The count includes two
varieties of cholesterol, called LDL and HDL. Patients with
the same total count may have very different proportions of
HDL and LDL -- and very different degrees of coronary risk.</p>
<p>Doctors are particularly concerned about patients who show
a high level of LDL, which does the artery-clogging, and a
low amount of HDL, which is now believed to offer some
protection against heart disease rather than contributing to
it.</p>
<p>Ideally, say researchers, the "bad" LDL ought to be no
more than 100 milligrams and the "good" HDL above 40. Anyone
with an LDL count over 160 ought to be on a low-fat,
low-cholesterol diet regardless of what the HDL is, doctors
say. And anyone with an LDL count of 140 and an HDL of less
than 40 ought to consider doing the same.</p>
