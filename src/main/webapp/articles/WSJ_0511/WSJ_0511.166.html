	<p class="article-leader">British Telecommunications PLC, London, said it plans to
eliminate 4,000 to 5,000 middle-management jobs as part of a
previously announced corporate reorganization to cut costs.
   The job cuts in a workforce of about 244,000 are the first
in what Britain's main telephone company says will be a
steady shedding of jobs over the next few years as fewer
workers are needed because of technological improvements.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Also as part of the reorganization, the company named Mike
Bett, 55-year-old managing director of its main U.K.
subsidiary, to the newly created post of vice chairman
effective Oct. 1.</p>
<p>Deep job cuts and public boardroom shuffles are relatively
new experiences for British Telecom, a former state telephone
monopoly privatized in 1984. In the past few years, pressure
for job cuts has been growing inside the company despite
stiff union opposition.</p>
