	<p class="article-leader">Toronto Dominion Bank said it received approval from the
Federal Reserve to underwrite corporate debt in the U.S.
   The permission given Toronto Dominion to expand its
securities-related activities in the U.S. is similar to
measures approved last January for two other big Canadian
banks, Royal Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce, and London-based Barclays Bank PLC.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In January 1989, the Fed permitted several U.S. banks to
underwrite corporate debt. As with the U.S. concerns, the
foreign banks' securities subsidiaries can generate only 10%
of their revenues from the underwriting of corporate debt,
commercial paper, securities backed by mortgages, consumer
debt and certain municipal bonds.</p>
<p>L. Arthur English, senior vice president for Toronto
Dominion's U.S. division, said the bank's securities unit,
Toronto Dominion Securities (USA) Inc., will be ready to use
its new powers by Monday.</p>
