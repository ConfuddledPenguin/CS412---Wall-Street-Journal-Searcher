	<p class="article-leader">Prior to last March, it would have been hard to believe
that Brazilian economic life could be made more chaotic. But
the government found a way: The Collor Plan, named after
Brazil's new president, Fernando Collor de Mello, and
designed by Economic Minister Zelia Cardoso de Mello and her
economic team.
   Introduced on March 16, the Collor Plan has been changing
by the day. Nevertheless, it is noted for these main and
often contradictory features: shrinkage in the supply of
money by freezing financial accounts, a wage and price
freeze, privatization of Brazilian state enterprises and a
string of new taxes -- on savings, wealth and on one of
Brazil's most productive sectors, agriculture. There is also
-- yet again -- a new currency, the cruzeiro, which over time
is to be exchanged on a one-to-one basis for the cruzado.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>When the plan was announced, sophisticated people found it
unbelievable. The economic team had confused the large stock
of money rather than the rapid creation of new money as the
cause of inflation. Consequently, the anti-inflationary
program focused on shrinking the supply of money 80% by
freezing balances in savings and checking accounts.</p>
<p>As the freeze applies to the cash balances of businesses,
chaos was instant. Businesses could not pay suppliers or meet
payrolls. Industrial production dropped 15% in March. There
were widespread layoffs, and it looked like the economy was
descending into deep depression.</p>
<p>Faced with an unprecedented liquidity crisis, the
government is allowing the economy to be reliquified
piecemeal without yet taking the sensible step of repealing
the ill-advised freeze. The individualized approach to
lifting the freeze has introduced new distortions and
privileges, as the monetary position of different persons and
groups is governed by different regulations.</p>
<p>For example, April 25 brought six decrees freeing frozen
funds. One was for pregnant women with due dates between
April 25 and June 1, allowing them to unfreeze 60,000
cruzados and exchange them for new cruzeiros if they give
birth in private clinics. Another allows pensioners over age
65 who are exempt from income tax to unfreeze 25,000 cruzados
(converted to cruzeiros) monthly for three months.</p>
<p>Banks, initially affected by the freeze, now can issue new
credit to firms whose cash balances are frozen. Similarly,
the agricultural sector has been promised 40 billion
cruzeiros for the winter harvest and the marketing of the
summer crop. The auto industry, the financial sector, heavy
industry and the construction industry are also being given
exemptions to the freeze.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, companies and individuals who have not yet
received a decree freeing their balances are resorting to
innovative measures. One company traded orange juice for
frozen funds that can be freed to pay taxes. Others,
apparently, are managing to borrow against their frozen
accounts.</p>
<p>The Collor Plan introduced a new 8% tax on savings if paid
by May 18; after that date the tax jumps to 20%. A similar 8%
tax applies to share values held. If this wealth tax is not
paid by May 18, shareowners will be hit with a 25%
transactions tax on the sale of shares. In addition, there is
a 25% capital-gains tax that apparently has been delayed
until 1991. There is also a 35% transactions tax on the sale
of precious metals.</p>
<p>With Brazil's stock markets down 50% or more, this would
seem to be the right time to pay one's wealth tax and to make
trades to restructure one's portfolio -- if one thinks the
taxes are going to stick. Like the freeze, the taxes may be
reduced or rolled back. The government seems to have little
understanding of the Collor Plan's disastrous impact on
Brazil's capital markets. Revisions of the tax code are
constantly announced, and no one, including the government,
knows what is coming next.</p>
<p>President Collor daily announces policies only to retract
or change them the following day. Recently, he announced that
his veto on the previous day of a salary provision, which
would raise the minimum wage by 6% every two months, was a
mistake. Confronted by economic reality that they don't
understand, his economic team has retreated into daily
announcements of measures to increase liquidity.</p>
<p>The impact on inflation of this mixture of liquidity
drains and injections, fixed prices, higher minimum wages,
supply disruptions and 300,000 factory workers on paid leave
is difficult to discern. The government claims zero inflation
for April. But, of course, it has not stopped printing money
to cover the budget deficit. Trade union economists say April
inflation was 24%, and a University of Sao Paulo study says
inflation was 68% during the first three weeks of the Collor
Plan. Shortages seem to reflect repressed inflation in
price-controlled sectors.</p>
<p>To be sure, there are sensible elements to the plan --
including privatization of state companies and plans to open
up the highly protected economy to imports. But these
sensible elements have been lost in the confusion and chaos.
You can't open up an economy that is becoming more regulated
on the inside. If anything, even more protection and
privilege can be expected as the regulators' plans begin to
fall apart.</p>
<p>As to privatization plans, although announced with
fanfare, directors of targeted state companies speak with
confidence of the continuation of state ownership and
announce their own grandiose plans.</p>
<p>For example, the new president of Embrafilme, the
Brazilian state film company, in charge of dissolving the
enterprise is instead planning projects for the future. The
president of Petrobras, the state petroleum company, parts of
which are slated for privatization, recently revealed plans
to expand distribution into external markets.</p>
<p>According to a lengthy article in the Brazilian news
magazine Veja, the main result of the Collor Plan has been a
rash of heart attacks and stress-related illnesses.
Brazilians, known for laughing at their cruel disasters,
describe the Collor Plan as "a neutron bomb that leaves
people alive but destroys everything around them." No, says
another Brazilian, the Collor Plan "preserves installations,
while destroying people and other living things."</p>
<p>Assuming the economy is reliquified and depression
avoided, the danger of the Collor Plan is that it will
convince Brazilians that not even drastic measures can cure
the economy's ills. It was certainly a mistake for Mr.
Collor, who was elected with hope and care, to implement a
secret economic plan. If the plan had been publicly debated,
its ill-conceived basis -- the freezing of bank balances --
would have been exposed, and the country and its new
president would have been spared needless chaos.</p>
<p>Mr. Collor needs to focus on privatizing the
deficit-ridden state companies. Once he does that, the
government will no longer have to print money to cover their
losses. As the injection of new money slowed, the inflation
rate would level off. Economic stability depends upon stable
property rights. Inflation, freezes, wealth confiscation and
arbitrary procedures destroy confidence by undermining
property rights. Brazil cannot make a comeback unless
property rights make a comeback.</p>
