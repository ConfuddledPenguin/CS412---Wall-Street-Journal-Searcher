	<p class="article-leader">Chief Justice Rehnquist complains that the federal courts
don't have the time and resources to play much of a role
locking up drug criminals, and one recent case shows why. The
federal courts must now spend time hearing a retrial of a
massive case because prosecutors confused jurors the first
time by throwing in an abusive RICO count. Earlier this year,
federal Judge Robert Aguilar of California was the first
federal judge ever tried as a racketeer, charged with
interceding with other judges to go easy on people he owed
money to. He was also charged with obstructing justice and
conspiracy. A jury couldn't reach a verdict. Jurors might
have figured that what Judge Aguilar allegedly did doesn't
sound very nice, but also doesn't sound much like the Mafia
or "racketeering." This week federal prosecutors dropped the
RICO counts against Judge Aguilar and will bring a case on
the less confusing charges. This sounds to us like progress.</p>
