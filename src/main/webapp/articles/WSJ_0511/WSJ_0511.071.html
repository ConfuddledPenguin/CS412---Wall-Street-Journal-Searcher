	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Wellcome PLC halted work on TPA after six years
of costly research, a setback that may spur sales for
Genentech Inc.'s flagship version of the clot-dissolving
drug.
   At the same time, the major British pharmaceutical maker
said it will accelerate development of Wellferon, its form of
the drug interferon, by expanding production and seeking
wider approval for the medicine's use in treating hepatitis.
Some analysts praised Wellcome's strategic shift, noting that
interferon has greater long-term sales potential than TPA
might have had in a market already clogged with competitors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Wellcome said it decided to discontinue development of TPA
after losing a U.S. patent infringement suit brought by
Genentech, a South San Francisco company that has agreed to a
merger plan that would give a majority stake to Roche Holding
Ltd. of Switzerland. Last month, a federal district court
jury in Delaware found that Wellcome and Genetics Institute
Inc., its U.S. collaborator, had infringed on three Genentech
patents by trying to develop forms of TPA. Wellcome
previously had won a U.K. patent case involving the drug,
used during heart attacks to restore blood flow and thus
limit damage.</p>
<p>The prospect of a protracted U.S. appeal made it
"difficult if not impossible to say what the (drug's) market
potential would be in the United States," where Wellcome had
sought initial marketing approval in March, said Martin
Sherwood, a Wellcome spokesman. He said the company had
invested "a substantial sum of money" in developing TPA --
analysts estimated as much as $80 million -- but the legal
tangle "put us into a high-risk area." He added: "There's no
doubt that (the withdrawal) is a disappointment to us."</p>
<p>Wellcome also cited recent studies "suggesting that TPA
does not have a markedly superior therapeutic profile to the
established product streptokinase." A study released in March
concluded that Hoechst AG's streptokinase prolongs life as
well as Genentech's flagship TPA product, sold under the
brand name Activase, even though it costs only about
one-tenth as much as TPA. Genentech criticized the study, the
first head-to-head comparison between the two drugs, as
confusing and inconclusive.</p>
<p>Wellcome's decision will sharpen the fierce competition
between Genentech's Activase and Eminase, a recently approved
drug made by SmithKline Beecham PLC of Britain. Genentech,
whose TPA sales last year rose 30% to $196.4 million, holds
about two-thirds of the market, but SmithKline Beecham is
marketing Eminase aggressively.</p>
<p>Wellcome's withdrawal "will benefit both (Genentech and
SmithKline Beecham) because there will be that much less
competition" in sight, said Erling Refsum, a
pharmaceutical-industry analyst at Nomura Research Institute
in London. A SmithKline Beecham spokesman declined to comment
on the Wellcome action.</p>
<p>Wellcome's abandonment of TPA also may convince other drug
companies also to relinquish development of their versions,
Mr. Refsum said. "It will restrict the development of further
TPAs but enhance the development of other bio-technology
drugs" because Genentech's court victory demonstrated these
medicines' patents may withstand legal challenges.</p>
<p>In South San Francisco, the attorney who defended
Genentech's TPA patent position said that Wellcome's
withdrawal from the field prolongs the biotechnology firm's
effective monopoly and discourages future competition.</p>
<p>"With Wellcome stepping out of the picture, it will leave
Genentech alone in the marketplace for a much longer period,"
said Stephen Raines, Genentech's vice president of
intellectual property. More importantly, he said, "The second
generation product was also dropped. That could certainly
have a chilling effect on other companies looking at second
generation products, if they feel that, after all their
investment, that product could be found to be infringing on
Genentech's patent."</p>
<p>Wellcome's U.S. collaborator, Genetics Institute,
Cambridge, Mass., said it is seeking to overturn the patent
verdict, but that a ruling on the matter isn't expected
before September. The biotechnology concern said it hasn't
decided whether to continue developing its clot-dissolving
drugs. It said its agreement with Suntory Ltd. of Japan,
which has licensed rights to a related drug in Asia, remains
inplace.</p>
<p>Genetics Institute said it expects its 1990 revenue to be
cut by up to $5 million because of Wellcome's decision. For
1989, Genetics Institute had a net loss of $28.7 million, or
$2.11 a share, on revenue of $43.6 million.</p>
<p>Mr. Refsum and other analysts said Wellcome was smart to
switch research emphasis on genetically engineered drugs from
TPA to Wellferon, which mainly has been marketed for minor
indications such as hairy cell leukemia. The interferon
appears useful in treating hepatitis B, the viral infection's
most serious form. It is "one of their major products in
R&D," said Andrew Porter, a London analyst for Nikko
Securities Co. But unlike Wellcome's leading AIDS drug, AZT,
he said, "Wellferon will be a useful but not spectacular
contributor to Wellcome."</p>
<p>Wellcome's Mr. Sherwood said Italy recently cleared
Wellferon for use in treating hepatitis B and "initial
indications are that sales are going to be good there."
Within a few months, Wellcome expects to gain marketing
clearance in Spain and Southeast Asia. He said the company
views those areas "as large potential markets" because
hepatitis is so widespread there.</p>
