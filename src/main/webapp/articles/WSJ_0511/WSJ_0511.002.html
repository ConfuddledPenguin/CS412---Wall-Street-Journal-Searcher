	<p class="article-leader">The Federal Aviation Administration's security chief was
reassigned on the eve of the release of a new report expected
to be highly critical of the agency's security program before
and after the Lockerbie disaster in which 270 people died.
   Raymond Salazar, director of the FAA's Office of Civil
Aviation Security, next month will take the helm at the
Center for Management Development in Palm Coast, Fla., the
agency's main management-training facility.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Since the terrorist downing of Pan Am Flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988, Mr. Salazar has been
under intense fire from relatives of those killed as well as
from some members of Congress.</p>
<p>Separately, Pan Am Corp. reached a settlement with
residents of the Scottish town of Lockerbie who lost
relatives, were injured or lost property as a result of the
attack. The bombing killed 11 people on the ground, in
addition to all 259 people on the plane.</p>
<p>The new report, by the President's Commission on Aviation
Security and Terrorism, is due out next Tuesday. It is
expected to admonish the FAA for serious lapses in security
and call for major changes in the nation's aviation-security
program. It also is expected to urge the Bush administration
to take a tougher stand against state-sponsored terrorism.</p>
<p>Two family groups organized after the terrorist attack,
Victims of Pan Am Flight 103 and Families of Pan Am
103-Lockerbie, have called repeatedly for Mr. Salazar's
resignation, contending that the security program he oversaw
was riddled with deficiencies.</p>
<p>FAA officials have defended Mr. Salazar. Yesterday, FAA
Administrator James Busey asserted that the report and Mr.
Salazar's job-change weren't connected. "We needed a good man
for the job and we've got one," he said in a statement.</p>
<p>But within the aviation community, the reassignment, first
reported in Aviation Daily, a trade publication, was widely
viewed as an effort by the FAA to blunt the commission's
report.</p>
<p>The seven-member panel, headed by former Labor Secretary
Ann McLaughlin, was appointed in August 1989. It will
recommend steps to increase the accountability of government
and airline officials involved in security operations.</p>
<p>The commission's April public hearing demonstrated the
controversy surrounding Mr. Salazar, as well as the confusion
and contradictions surrounding security efforts at the time
of the bombing. Officials from the FAA and Pan Am told the
panel that the airline hadn't been hand-searching
unaccompanied baggage put aboard planes in Frankfurt, where
the doomed Pan Am flight originated. The luggage was X-rayed
only.</p>
<p>Pan Am said it had received permission from Mr. Salazar to
skip the required hand searches -- a contention Mr. Salazar
hotly denied before the commission.</p>
<p>Panel members also expressed consternation that airline
security in Frankfurt remained inadequate for eight months
following the bombing.</p>
<p>Concerning the settlement, attorneys for both sides
declined to disclose its terms. The agreement covers 270
claims for damages from ground victims. It doesn't affect
lawsuits that have been filed on behalf of the passengers who
lost their lives in the disaster.</p>
<p>Attorneys for the ground victims alleged Pan Am failed to
take adequate steps to prevent a terrorist attack.</p>
<p>There was no limit to the amount of damages the ground
victims could collect from Pan Am, the attorneys said.
Passenger claims, however, are covered by international
treaties that limit the airline's liability to $75,000 per
person. Attorneys must prove Pan Am guilty of gross
negligence to win higher awards. British aviation officials
are still investigating the incident. Their findings will
form the basis for settling passenger claims.</p>
<p>Pan Am said the settlement with ground victims will be
covered by its insurers and won't have any immediate effect
on its finances.</p>
