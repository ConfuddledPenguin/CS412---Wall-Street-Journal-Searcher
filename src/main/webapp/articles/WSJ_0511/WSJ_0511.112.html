	<p class="article-leader">WHEN SOMETHING needs doing, the saying goes, ask a busy
man to do it. That now looks like particularly good advice
for anyone who needs a repair job done on his heart.
   Numerous studies have been showing that medical centers
doing a lot of heart surgery lose a significantly lower
proportion of patients than ones that aren't nearly as busy.
There are quite a few individual exceptions to this rule, and
doubters -- many from hospitals with poorer records -- argue
that the raw data are incomplete and therefore deceptive. But
overall, the evidence has been too strong to ignore.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>So the weight of medical opinion now holds that if
practice can't make perfect where heart surgery is concerned,
it certainly helps a lot -- meaning that, conversely, lack of
it can kill patients who might have lived if they had gone to
busier places. Arnold Relman, editor of the New England
Journal of Medicine, says: "The evidence is clear that
open-heart surgery is better, more efficient and safer in
centers that deal with larger volumes of patients and have
larger staffs and more sophisticated and elaborate
facilities."</p>
<p>But does this mean that the problem, now that it is
recognized, will quickly fade away? Don't count on it.</p>
<p>It's true that many lower-rated hospitals are working hard
to upgrade their heart-surgery programs. It's true that some
states, including Florida and Ohio, have reacted to the
findings on surgical volume and mortality by clamping down on
the rapid multiplication of new heart-surgery facilities. But
it's also true that such surgery is an economic lure so
powerful that hospitals find it hard to resist.</p>
<p>Michael Cadger, a health-care consultant and formerly the
chief financial officer of a hospital, says that profit
margins for bypass surgery -- the most common variety -- can
reach 25% in an industry whose average overall margin is
about 5%. Beyond that, a heart-surgery program enhances a
hospital's status, helping it attract and keep respected
physicians. And it serves as a rainmaker, a base for bringing
in lucrative allied business such as angioplasty.</p>
<p>This is why hospitals have been opening cardiac-surgery
centers at a pace that defies logic, further splintering the
market for such services and thereby adding to the potential
mortality problem. Between 1984 and 1988, the American
Hospital Association recorded a 23% jump in the number of
hospitals doing such operations, and more have been added
since.</p>
<p>This growth has been occurring even as it was becoming
ever clearer that too many hospital surgical teams weren't
handling enough cases to hone their skills to the maximum.
The result: "an unnecessary bloodbath," says Sidney Wolfe,
director of the Public Citizen Health Research Group. "The
question is how much longer we can tolerate this."</p>
<p>The problem is compounded by advances in technology and
technique that make it feasible to operate on older and
sicker patients. This further taxes the skills not only of
the surgeon but also of the entire cardiac surgery team --
nurses, perfusionists, anesthesiologists, and others --
skills that frequently call for split-second timing and the
kind of interconnected reaction by team members that only
reaches perfection with repeated, constant practice.</p>
<p>But at least 30% of hospitals doing heart surgery are
doing fewer than the 250 bypass operations a year that many
surgeons themselves believe is the optimum. In California, a
third of them do fewer than 150 a year.</p>
<p>This has led to striking differences in death rates
between hospitals that may sometimes be only blocks apart.
Among Medicare patients, the only group for which national
mortality data are available, 20% of those undergoing heart
surgery die at some hospitals; at others, only 2% do.</p>
<p>Still, the high-volume hospitals don't always do a lot
better than the low-volume ones. Glendale Memorial Hospital
in Glendale, Calif., for instance, did only 103 heart
surgeries in 1988 but lost just four patients. "I think you
can do a very good job with an average of two or three cases
a week," says John Goodwin, chief of surgery.</p>
<p>Other doctors and hospital administrators, many from
hospitals with poorer records, argue that the raw statistics
on mortality and patient volume should be discounted because
they don't reflect the condition of patients when they
arrive. They are handling more difficult cases than other
hospitals, these dissenters often argue, and so higher death
rates are predictable.</p>
<p>But there is little or no statistical backing for such
arguments, and most experts discount them. There's no reason
to believe, they say, that low-volume hospitals get more
difficult cases; if anything, they'd probably see a lower
proportion of them. "A hospital that's doing 50 cases a year
just isn't going to get the complicated ones," says Dr.
Relman of the New England Journal.</p>
<p>The argument that practice is vital gets extra support
from the extremely high death rate at some hospitals where
heart surgery has been a recent addition. In such places the
surgical teams have had little chance to work together, and
it shows.</p>
<p>JFK Medical Center in Atlantis, Fla., for one, had
disastrous initial results when it began a heart-surgery
program in 1987. Even though the surgeons were supplied under
an arrangement with Michael DeBakey, the renowned cardiac
surgeon from Houston, seven of the first 29 patients died,
for a stunning mortality rate of 23%.</p>
<p>The hospital shut down the program and brought in new
surgeons. They put the team through extensive mock-up drills
simulating surgery before reopening the program, screened out
higher-risk cases, and virtually lived at the hospital while
the first 20 patients were treated after reopening. The
mortality rate for heart surgery at JFK fell to a respectable
5%.</p>
<p>Like JFK, other hospitals striving to improve their
heart-surgery results have been referring complicated cases
to better-equipped and more practiced hospitals -- in part to
avoid posting a death rate that might imperil their programs.</p>
<p>Insurers want to direct patients to the busier,
better-equipped hospitals, too, with cost savings as one
incentive. Not long ago Prudential Insurance Co. began
approaching high-volume hospitals, offering to send them
insured patients in exchange for discounts. Others, including
Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans and the Health Care
Financing Administration, which runs Medicare, are either
following suit or looking into the possibility of doing so.</p>
