	<p class="article-leader">BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- Alex Maslansky ambles into the
Beverly Hills Baseball Card Shop and plunks down $50 for a
1986 Jose Canseco rookie special.
   The blue-bordered card of the Oakland A's slugger is "a
great investment," bound to be worth $80 before long, he
says. Alex is 11 years old.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I like the tension," he adds, particularly when he runs
to get the latest Beckett Baseball Monthly, the bible of
price guides, "to see if what I have went up or down." Gary
Moody, an adult friend of Alex, likens baseball cards to
penny stocks. He adds approvingly: "It teaches him about
business."</p>
<p>And about life. Alex has followed with interest the plight
of Bob Engel, a veteran National League umpire, who was
arrested last month and charged with pulling a brown paper
bag out of his pants and stuffing it with seven boxes of
baseball cards at a discount store in Bakersfield, Calif.</p>
<p>Mr. Engel, who himself has appeared on umpire cards,
produced by T&M Sports Inc., pleaded innocent last week to
three counts of petty theft and burglary. He has been
suspended from working any games until the situation is
cleared up.</p>
<p>Ever since some people began viewing these cardboard
portraits of sports stars as offering a better return on
investment than equities or precious metals, baseball cards
have boomed into a $1 billion-plus industry. And like most,
this one has its share of greed, bamboozlement, out-and-out
thievery -- and, apparently, one brutal murder.</p>
<p>Television's "L.A. Law," as good a barometer of the modern
American scene as any, aired an episode earlier this year in
which Benny, the retarded office clerk, nearly lost his shirt
in a squabble over his card collection. ("Look, what are
these things worth, a few hundred dollars?" asked Stuart
Markowitz, Benny's friend and counsel. "Try $13,000 -- and
it's an appreciating asset," responded a ruthless Jerry, the
man in pursuit of Benny's near-mint 1962 Warren Spahn.)</p>
<p>The preoccupation with investment isn't limited to
high-rent districts like Beverly Hills. "You see plenty of
parents pressuring their kids to pick the right cards and,
consequently, I get a lot of grim-faced 12-year-olds in my
store," says Fred Harris, who runs the Great American
Baseball Card Co. in Concord, Mass. "It really bothers me
that they're not flipping them and trading them and putting
them on their bicycle wheels like I used to do."</p>
<p>Mr. Harris, author of "The Great American Baseball Card
Flipping, Trading and Bubble Gum Book," published in 1973,
says he has started to measure the width of cards that people
try to sell him because some have taken to razoring off a
ragged corner or a rough edge to make their merchandise seem
more pristine.</p>
<p>"Money breeds scum," says Matt Federgreen, the owner of
the Beverly Hills shop. He rues the passing of a more artless
era, when children bought packs of cards (once a penny, now
at least 50 cents) simply hoping to stumble upon their
favorite players. He fondly recalls the days when he didn't
have to add a second alarm system and a video camera to his
store.</p>
<p>But card-shop owners can't be too careful these days. A
four-hour drive north of here, in the peaceful Mission town
of San Luis Obispo, police are hunting for Frank Gove's
murderer.</p>
<p>Two months ago, Mr. Gove, the proprietor of Central Coast
Baseball Cards, was found slumped behind one of his display
cases, bludgeoned to death with a blunt object. Baseball and
football cards valued at $10,000 were missing. "We're
perplexed at the level of violence," says Mike Brennler, the
detective working the case. "I mean, baseball is supposed to
be the all-American game. This is really the dark side."</p>
<p>Many collectors, speculators and hucksters think too much
is being made of such bad news. Most dealers are reputable,
insists Kit Young, a prominent card salesman in Vancouver,
Wash. "For kids, this remains a lot better than squandering
their money on drugs or pinball or something." Nevertheless,
Mr. Young will be meeting with scores of his peers in St.
Louis later this month to consider forming a national dealers
association governed by a code of ethics.</p>
<p>There is no denying that some dealers today aren't content
just counting cards; some are counterfeiting them as well.
Upper Deck Co., one of the "Big Five" card manufacturers,
includes a "counterfeit-proof" hologram on the back of each
card. "When we started in 1988, lots of collectors termed it
a gimmick," says Don Bodow, a vice president at the Yorba
Linda, Calif., company. "They don't do that anymore."</p>
<p>For some, the biggest worry isn't blatant criminal
activity, but more subtle forms of subterfuge. For example,
The Big Five -- Topps Co., Fleer Corp. the Donruss brand
(made by Leaf Inc., a unit of Huhtamaki of Finland), Score
Inc. and Upper Deck-are routinely accused of purposely
putting out cards with errors, and then recalling them in an
attempt to generate interest in their products. They all
vehemently deny the accusation.</p>
<p>However, the companies make no bones about trying to take
back rare gems that are distributed by accident. Lee Hull, a
dealer in Champaign, Ill., caused a fuss when he said he
discovered in a regular 1990 Topps wax-paper-wrapped pack a
baseball card showing President Bush during his playing days
at Yale.</p>
<p>Brooklyn-based Topps says it meant to send all 100 Bush
cards it printed as a gift to the commander-in-chief, and it
considers the item "stolen property." Now, things have gotten
complicated. Mr. Hull has been sued by one of his customers,
who claims that he agreed to buy the card for 15 cents. Mr.
Hull maintains that there was never such a deal. Meanwhile,
the card sits in limbo in a Champaign courthouse.</p>
<p>To many, the skyrocketing price of cards is itself a
travesty. According to the latest Beckett monthly, an
unblemished copy of Mickey Mantle's 1952 Topps card goes for
$7,000. Even a 1984 Fleer card of New York Mets ace Dwight
Gooden is listed at $80, and a 1984 Donruss version of Yankee
Don Mattingly fetches $70. "I feel a little remorse, because
the average individual gets priced out of the market,"
concedes Tom Mortenson, the editor of Sports Collectors
Digest, the leading promotional vehicle for card peddlers.</p>
<p>But some tycoons who regularly pitch their wares in his
weekly journal summarily dismiss the gripers. "It sounds to
me like they're jealous" of those who've hit it big, says
Alan "Mr. Mint" Rosen, who not long ago began asking $2
million for a creased but uncut 1910 strip of five cards
printed for distribution in cigarette packs but never
marketed. Among them is what is known as the rarest and most
famous card of all, a T-206 Honus Wagner. (One story goes
that Mr. Wagner was a nonsmoker who demanded the card be
withdrawn and destroyed; another is that the cigarette
company wouldn't pay him enough to use his photo.)</p>
<p>"Sure, we've ruined their hobby," Mr. Rosen says. "But
isn't this what America is all about?"</p>
<p>"The prices are going crazy because the stuff is great,"
adds Joshua Evans, another shameless high-roller when it
comes to sports collectibles. "Look, I'm not a rocket
scientist. I won't win the Nobel Prize. I just make people
feel good" by selling cards and other memorabilia.</p>
<p>Some others don't make people feel very good, however.
Sports Collectors Digest has had to ban a number of dealers
from advertising because they sold bogus cards or sent out
nothing at all. A few have been prosecuted for mail fraud and
thrown in jail.</p>
<p>Perhaps no single incident, however, has captivated the
card-collecting community more than the arrest of umpire
Engel, 56 years old. Bakersfield police say he tried to make
off with 4,180 Score cards, worth $143.98, from a store last
month.</p>
<p>Shortly before last week's arraignment, the district
attorney's office in Bakersfield also charged Mr. Engel in
connection with a January episode in which he allegedly
snatched about 50 packs of cards from another store. Neither
he nor his lawyer will comment on the case.</p>
<p>Whatever the outcome of the Engel affair, many see it as
yet another signal that the age of innocence in card
collecting is gone forever.</p>
<p>"We're fixated on money and sports, and cards are just
another chance to put them together," says Lew Lipset, viewed
by some as the curmudgeon of card collecting, and by others
as its conscience. Writing in a recent edition of his monthly
newsletter, The Old Judge, he concluded: "Try to make a
living in this hobby and you'll learn about . . . deceit,
unfair business practices, the lack of truth in advertising,
price manipulation, collusion, restraint of trade, insider
trading, patronage, extortion, payoffs and bribes, graft,
plagiarism and, last but not least, hype."</p>
