	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- Coastal Corp. said that it expects a major
resurgence in the energy industry this decade and that it has
been actively readying itself.
   "Now is the time to prepare for another boom in the energy
business that will occur in the next five years," Chairman
Oscar S. Wyatt Jr. told the annual meeting here.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Wyatt said that oil and natural gas markets are
"moving out of a period of surplus and into a period" where
those markets "will be driven by availability of supply." He
added, "We see a cyclical turnaround just getting started."</p>
<p>In fact, Mr. Wyatt warned that natural-gas shortages could
come shortly, particularly during the winter. Discussing the
short period of frigid weather last winter, he said, "If that
cold snap had lasted 30 days we would have had brownouts and
blackouts all over."</p>
<p>The energy company said its spending on capital expansion
in 1989 and 1990 will exceed a total of $1 billion. "Spending
will be mainly on facilities to serve new markets and new
business, not for maintenance or replacement," said James R.
Paul, Coastal's chief executive.</p>
<p>Coastal, which made a number of successful and
unsuccessful takeover attempts in the 1980s, said it now
intends to spend more of its available cash on internally
generated projects.</p>
<p>"There's going to be less of a tendency for us and
everybody else to make acquisitions" in the current
environment, Mr. Paul said. He added that Coastal perceives
energy company stock prices to be relatively strong and
anti-takeover restrictions to be stricter and more
widespread.</p>
<p>Mr. Wyatt said he expects Americans to increasingly demand
cleaner fuels, and that "Coastal is well positioned." The
company has emphasized its low-sulfur coal reserves, acquired
an oil refinery in Aruba that will make low-sulfur products
and increased its natural gas assets.</p>
<p>Mr. Paul said Coastal expects 1990 net income to increase
from last year's $170.1 million, or $1.81 a share. He said he
expects operating profit for the company's gas segment will
be about the same this year, or at about the $423 million
level of 1989, but that those earnings should be "up
significantly" by 1992. The gas surplus of recent years is
about gone, he said, which should bring higher transportation
margins for Coastal's pipeline operations.</p>
<p>Environmental pressures should boost demand for natural
gas, considered a cleaner-burning fuel, Mr. Paul said.
Coastal plans to double its own natural-gas production in the
next few years from the 400 million cubic feet a day produced
last year, he said. He added that operating profit from
exploration and production will be double the $41 million of
1989 when Coastal reaches its goal.</p>
<p>Coal earnings will rise this year from 1989's $72 million,
Mr. Paul said. Nearly all 900 million tons of Coastal's
recoverable reserves are classified as low sulfur, he added.</p>
