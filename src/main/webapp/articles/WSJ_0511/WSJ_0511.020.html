	<p class="article-leader">BANGKOK, Thailand -- A group led by Canada's Lavalin Inc.
appears likely to win the 40 billion baht ($1.54 billion)
contract for Skytrain, Bangkok's long-delayed and
much-contested mass-transit system, if it can get financial
guarantees within two weeks.
   On Wednesday, a committee appointed by Interior Minister
Banharn Silpa-Archa decided Lavalin International Group
should build the elevated mass-transit system and operate it
for 30 years before handing it over to the government.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But Lavalin must secure commercial-bank guarantees for 800
million Canadian dollars (US$686.4 million) in financing.
Government-owned Export Development Corp. of Canada offered
the group that amount at concessional terms if Lavalin can
secure guarantees for it. The Thai Finance Ministry said
guarantees must be obtained by May 24. But some observers of
the project pointed out that mass-transit systems generally
lose money, and said banks may be reluctant to provide the
guarantees.</p>
<p>Burin Borriboon, deputy managing director of Sino-Thai
Engineering & Construction Co., one of Lavalin's Thai
partners, conceded that "it will still be a scramble" to
secure the guarantees in two weeks because they probably will
require approval from the boards of participating
international banks. But he said he is confident that Lavalin
will be able to meet the May 24 deadline.</p>
