	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Federal prosecutors investigating Rep.
Joseph McDade (R., Pa.) obtained an indictment charging the
lawmaker's former top aide with racketeering, conspiracy and
tax violations.
   The eight felony charges against Raymond Wittig, Rep.
McDade's primary link to a minority defense contractor,
indicate that prosecutors have stepped up their inquiry into
whether the veteran GOP lawmaker accepted illegal campaign
contributions and gratuities from officials of the company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the Philadelphia federal court indictment, Mr. Wittig
was charged, among other things, with conspiring to funnel
bribes and gratuities to public officials who helped the
now-defunct United Chem-Con Corp. secure and maintain federal
contracts over the years. The indictment doesn't identify any
of those officials, but some of the charges parallel
allegations against the congressman first raised in a
December 1988 front-page story in The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>Rep. McDade, Mr. Wittig and their lawyers couldn't be
reached for comment. In the past, Rep. McDade has maintained
that he hasn't violated any laws and said his efforts on
behalf of United Chem-Con were intended to keep jobs in his
district. Mr. Wittig has acknowledged soliciting campaign
gifts and other favors for Rep. McDade from company
officials, but has denied any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicholas Harbist, who has headed
the two-year Philadelphia grand jury investigation, said only
that the inquiry is continuing.</p>
<p>If convicted on all counts, Mr. Wittig faces a maximum of
41 years in jail and a $1.4 million fine.</p>
