	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The over-the-counter market ended on its highs
for the day, encouraged by a successful conclusion to the
Treasury Department's quarterly refunding.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed steadily through the
session, closing up 1.86, or 0.43%, to 433.20. The New York
Stock Exchange added 0.35% for the day.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Traders say the OTC market grew stronger as yields in the
bond market eased.</p>
<p>Lance Zipper, manager of the OTC trading department at
Kidder Peabody & Co., says his trading desk has seen more
action in the past few days than it has in the past few
months. Most of that activity has been on the buy side, he
adds.</p>
<p>"The orders around now are much, much larger than they
were a month ago," Mr. Zipper says. "The liquidity in our
market seems to be building up."</p>
<p>Mr. Zipper says the activity is spreading to smaller
unlisted stocks that have been largely ignored by investors
for some time.</p>
<p>Sun Microsystems led the most-active list, easing 1/4 to
28 1/8 in apparent profittaking on volume of more than 4.4
million shares. The stock surged 2 1/2 points Wednesday on
volume of more than 5 million shares.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nordstrom continued to trade after the market
closed, sliding on disappointing earnings. At about 4 p.m.
EDT, the company reported profit of 16 cents a share in the
latest first quarter, down from 28 cents a year earlier.
Analysts had expected the company to earn around 27 cents a
share in the quarter, according to Zacks Corporate Earnings
Estimator.</p>
<p>The stock eased 1/4 to 27 3/4 during yesterday's session.
But Jerry Markowitz, partner in charge of OTC trading at
Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, says the stock fell
to about 26 1/4 in after market trading on the Instinet
automated trading system.</p>
<p>OTC advancers led decliners, 1,037 to 844. National Market
System volume rose to 104,329,800 shares from Wednesday's
99,273,600 shares.</p>
<p>Apple Computer fell 1/2 to 41 3/8. This newspaper reported
yesterday that the Macintosh System 7, a software upgrade to
Apple's Macintosh that was originally slated for a summer
debut, now won't be ready until year end.</p>
<p>Also on the most-active list, Hornbeck Offshore Services
added 1/2 to 7 7/8. A 3.21 million share secondary offering
was priced late Wednesday at $7.25 a share.</p>
<p>L.M. Ericsson Telephone's American Depositary Receipts
added 6 3/8 from Wednesday's close to 177 1/8, after opening
trading here at 176. Yesterday, L.M. Ericsson announced an
$89 million order for fighter aircraft equipment in Europe.
Earlier this week, the Swedish telecommunications giant
reported that first quarter pretax income nearly doubled. The
company has also approved a 5-for-1 stock split.</p>
<p>Durham gained 2 1/4 to 32. The diversified insurance
company earned 29 cents a share in its latest first quarter,
up from 18 cents in continuing operation profit a year
earlier.</p>
<p>Genetics Institute dropped 1 3/8 to 35 5/8. The company
said its 1990 revenue will be about $5 million lower than
previously expected because of Wellcome Foundation's decision
to cancel its heart-attack drug development project. The
company said its 1990 revenue had been expected to total
about $50 million. Wellcome had been developing two
clot-dissolving drugs for Genetics Institute. Last month,
however, rival Genentech won a patent-infringement suit
against the two companies over the heart-attack drugs. The
company had revenue of $43.6 million in fiscal 1989, ended in
November.</p>
<p>Nuclear Support Services tumbled 1 to 9 1/4 after
reporting a fiscal second quarter loss of 39 cents a share.
The company, which provides technical support personnel for
nuclear power plants, earned 11 cents a share in the
year-earlier quarter.</p>
<p>ACC jumped another 1 1/4 to 11 5/8 yesterday after rising
7/8 Wednesday, giving it a 25% gain in two days. The company
has been on a road show talking to institutional investors
about its opportunities in the Canadian long-distance market.
Recent rulings in Canada have opened that $2 billion-plus
market to long-distance resellers. Rochester, N.Y.-based ACC
believes it is in a position to participate in the market
because of its proximity to the Canadian border.</p>
<p>Seagate Technology added 1/2 to 12 3/4 on heavy volume.
The company said a patent-infringement case filed against it
by Atasi Corp. in 1984 has been dismissed.</p>
<p>Cellular gained 1 1/4 to 14 1/4. The company offered $40
million of 8% convertible subordinated debentures due 2000 in
Europe. The conversion price on the debentures will be $14.95
a share, the company said.</p>
<p>New Mexico's Sunwest Financial lost 1 1/4 to 18 1/4.
Wednesday, the company said it recorded additions to
loan-loss reserves and write-downs totaling $2.6 million due
to a regulatory examination last month. The bank holding
company said it expects additional adjustments as bank
examiners continue to look at its books.</p>
<p>Michigan National lost 1 to 36 1/4. The bank holding
company said it is slowing the pace of its stock-repurchase
program. The company also said its non-performing loans have
increased from $96 million to $139 million.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Corrections & Amplifications</p>
<p>SUNWEST FINANCIAL SERVICES Inc. said it recorded additions
to loan-loss reserves and other charges totaling $7 million
due to a continuing regulatory exam, leaving the company with
net income of $2.1 million for the four-month period ended
April 30. The total for the charges was misstated in Friday's
edition.</p>
