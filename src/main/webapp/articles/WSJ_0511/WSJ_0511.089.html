	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Treasury said it has lifted its
suspension of Bell Atlantic Corp. from receiving future
business from the federal government after the company agreed
to verify the information it provided to the government.
   On April 3, the Treasury sent a letter to a Bell Atlantic
subsidiary, Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Co., alleging that
C&P had made "material misrepresentations" in a bid for a
$100 million contract to modernize the Treasury's telephone
system in the Washington area. American Telephone & Telegraph
Co. also is bidding on the work.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Bell Atlantic said it was reinstated after it agreed to
tell its employees to check the information provided to the
government, including information supplied by subcontractors.
The phone company said it also agreed not to pursue further
litigation on the contract.</p>
