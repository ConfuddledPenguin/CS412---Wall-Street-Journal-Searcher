	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and
other banking regulators urged banks not to curb lending in
reaction to tougher supervision.
   In a private meeting with officials of the American
Bankers Association, Mr. Greenspan, along with William
Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., and
Robert Clarke, comptroller of the currency, sought to allay
fears among bankers that overzealous regulators would crack
down on prudent bank lending.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The regulators denied, however, that the unusual meeting
was prompted by concerns of some economists, bankers and
their borrowers of a credit crunch that could slow the
economy.</p>
<p>"The evidence of that is quite limited," Mr. Greenspan
said after the meeting here.</p>
<p>Banking regulators have stepped up their policing of
lending practices in reaction to the huge losses on
real-estate loans in the Southwest in recent years. But many
in the banking industry say that regulators have overreacted
by taking such actions as requiring some banks to increase
reserves, even for performing real-estate loans. The tougher
supervision has been felt most severely in the Northeast.</p>
<p>"I think supervisory overkill and overregulation are at
the top of the list of concerns right now," said Ken Guenther
of the Independent Bankers Association of America, which
represents smaller banks. In a statement, the ABA judiciously
said: "All {bankers} agree that the rules are being applied
with increased vigor."</p>
<p>Mr. Clarke has particularly been criticized by the
industry for tightening enforcement of the rules, and one
explicit purpose of the meeting was to stress that the
regulators are united in their tough approach.</p>
<p>"This is not like Sherman's army marching across the
country in a wave," Mr. Clarke said after the meeting. "We
are not telling banks to quit making loans. We are telling
banks to be careful."</p>
<p>The regulators did say that real estate has come under
particular scrutiny, and that includes stepped-up
examinations beyond the Northeast. "We are simply doing
targeted real-estate examinations in markets that are soft,"
Mr. Clarke said. "It's inevitable that there will be some
constriction of credit."</p>
<p>Both the regulators and the bankers denied that lending
has been choked off significantly. But they both said that
some bankers are operating under the perception that all
loans will be second-guessed by regulators. Bankers have been
particularly reluctant to lend to small businesses, said the
ABA.</p>
<p>But the regulators, apparently fearing a greater slowdown
in the economy, especially in an election year, took pains to
encourage prudent lending. Mr. Greenspan flew back to
Washington for the afternoon meeting, following his address
earlier in the day to a trade group in Chicago.</p>
<p>One trade group official in the Washington meeting said
that Mr. Greenspan told them that, "The nature of banking is
risk-taking, and if you have zero loan losses, then you are
not doing your job."</p>
