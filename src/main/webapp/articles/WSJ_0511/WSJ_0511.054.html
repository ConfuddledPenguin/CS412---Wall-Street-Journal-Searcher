	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Federal Communications Commission
tightened its rules for awarding broadcast licenses,
discarding some of the free-market ideas of the Reagan years
and throwing into doubt a request by Tele-Communications Inc.
for FCC approval of a new satellite service.
   On a 5-0 vote, the agency threw out a Reagan-era proposal
to award broadcast licenses by lottery rather than the
traditional method of conducting hearings to choose the best
applicant. It also voted unanimously to broaden the range of
misconduct that could disqualify applicants from winning
broadcast licenses to include any felony conviction, rather
than just those involving fraud, and antitrust violations
involving mass-media properties.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Tele-Communications, which lost an antitrust lawsuit in
1985 to a competitor for a cable television franchise in
Missouri, could be hurt by the ruling. The Denver cable
company currently is asking the FCC to approve a plan to
construct and operate a satellite service that would beam
video programming directly to roof-mounted satellite
receivers. An FCC official said the new policy will be a
factor in the decision to grant Tele-Communications a
license, but said the agency hadn't decided how it will rule.</p>
<p>Andrew Schwartzman, executive director of the Media Access
Project, which is challenging the Tele-Communications
application, said the FCC ruling would strengthen his case.
But the agency generally goes out of its way to approve new
services, even if it sometimes bends its policies to
accommodate them. Tele-Communications didn't return calls
seeking comment.</p>
<p>Tele-Communications is part of a satellite-broadcast
partnership called K Prime Partners, which plans to offer a
10-channel service by the end of this year. Another group,
called Sky Cable, plans a more elaborate service in 1993.</p>
<p>Separately, the FCC voted unanimously for a series of
proposals to tighten the rules for awarding new broadcast
stations. The agency proposed to ban the practice by which
competitors for a new broadcast property buy each other out
for large sums before going to a hearing.</p>
<p>The Reagan-era policy was meant to quicken the pace by
which new licenses were awarded, but sometimes degenerated
into a free-for-all in which applications were filed simply
to make money during these negotiations. The FCC proposal
would limit the amount of such payoffs to the expenses
incurred in making an application.</p>
<p>The FCC also said it hoped to reduce the time it took to
approve a new license to one year from a current average of
three. "Arms-control treaties take less time than the work of
this commission," said FCC Chairman Alfred Sikes.</p>
<p>But none of the day's proposals addressed the longstanding
criticism of the FCC that it awards broadcast licenses based
on trivial differences among applicants. Frustrations over
the picayune nature of these inquiries have led to
suggestions over the years that the government auction off
new broadcast licenses to the highest bidder rather than give
them away to those chosen during hearings. But broadcasters
have resolutely opposed proposals that they pay for broadcast
frequencies they use.</p>
