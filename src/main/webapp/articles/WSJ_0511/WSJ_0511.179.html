	<p class="article-leader">ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd took a step toward digesting its
recent acquisition of Combustion Engineering Inc. by agreeing
to sell Georgia Kaolin Co. for about $525 million, according
to sources familiar with the transaction.
   The buyer is ECC Group PLC, formerly English China Clays
PLC, based in Cornwall, England, which plans to add Georgia
Kaolin's line of paper pigments to its industrial minerals
business. Kaolin, also known as China clay, is used to give
magazine pages a glossy sheen.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The agreement, which is subject to U.S. antitrust
clearance and other regulatory approvals, is expected to be
announced in London this morning.</p>
<p>ABB, the world's largest electrical engineering company
with more than $25 billion in estimated sales, acquired
Combustion Engineering late last year for about $1.6 billion
to bolster its U.S. presence in its main business of making
equipment used to generate and transmit electrical power.</p>
<p>The Zurich, Switzerland, concern is selling Georgia
Kaolin, which has three plants in Georgia, because the
industrial pigments business doesn't fit with its main
power-plant business. ABB is co-owned by BBC Brown Boveri AG
of Switzerland and Asea AB of Sweden.</p>
<p>ECC, which has annual sales of about $1.6 billion, already
has some operations in Georgia. Georgia Kaolin had pretax
profit of about $41 million in 1989 on sales of roughly $170
million.</p>
<p>ABB is being advised on the sale by First Boston Corp., a
unit of CS First Boston Group Inc. ECC is advised by J. Henry
Schroder Wagg & Co. in London.</p>
<p>ECC plans to finance the purchase with a three-year
borrowing of about $600 million, which it may refinance with
longer-term securities later. It doesn't expect to use an
equity rights offering as financing.</p>
<p>ECC also plans a $200 million preferred stock issue and
intends to sell certain businesses to raise roughly #100
million ($167.9 million) more by the end of 1991. ECC doesn't
expect the acquisition to dilute its earnings in the first
full year after completion, and it should boost operating
profit in 1991.</p>
