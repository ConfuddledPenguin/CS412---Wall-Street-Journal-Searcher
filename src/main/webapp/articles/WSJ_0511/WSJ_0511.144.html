	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Reports that Bond Media Ltd., the owner of an
Australian television network, is about to receive a large
cash infusion from three U.S. companies may be greatly
exaggerated.
   Dispatches out of Sydney, Australia, quoted Bond Media
officials as saying they were close to completing a deal to
receive $125 million from an unusual trio of U.S. companies:
Paramount Communications Inc., CBS Inc. and General Electric
Co.'s NBC unit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But a Paramount spokesman would say only that the
entertainment company is considering making an investment and
wouldn't comment on the involvement of other parties. An NBC
spokesman said that company isn't involved at all: "We were
approached by Bond. We told them what it would take to do a
deal from our point of view. It is our understanding they are
pursuing other options."</p>
<p>And a CBS spokeswoman said CBS is in only "preliminary"
discussions regarding such an investment. CBS President
Laurence A. Tisch has been reluctant in the past to expand
CBS's scope of operations beyond getting the third-place
network back on track.</p>
<p>Bond has been under pressure to refinance a large amount
of debt taken on several years ago to buy the Channel Nine
network.</p>
