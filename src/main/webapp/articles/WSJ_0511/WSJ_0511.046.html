	<div class="article-body"><p>New York City -- the bulk of $900 million of general
obligation revenue anticipation notes, Fiscal 1990 Series C
and D, due June 29, 1990, apparently was won by a Merrill
Lynch Capital Markets group. Merrill Lynch purchased $400
million in notes at yields ranging from 6.247% to 6.419%. The
notes were priced as follows: $100 million of notes priced to
yield 6.247%, $50 million of notes priced to yield 6.288%,
$100 million of notes priced to yield 6.337%, $100 million of
notes priced to yield 6.386% and $50 million of notes priced
to yield 6.419%. The notes, rated MIG-2 by Moody's Investors
Service Inc. and SP-1 by Standard & Poor's Corp., were priced
at the initial reoffering to yield 6.40%, according to an
official with the lead underwriter. The notes are being sold
to help the city meet its financial obligations until it
receives funds from the state. The state funds are
unavailable until a state budget is passed. All together,
seven firms purchased the $900 million in notes, according to
city officials.</p>
<p>                      MORTGAGES</p>
<p>Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. -- $153 million of Shearson
Lehman Hutton Mortgage Trust real estate mortgage investment
conduit securities is being offered in eight classes. Full
pricing details weren't immediately available. The offering,
Trust 1, is backed by 15-year and 30-year mortgages with a
weighted average coupon rate of 10.97%. The mortgages are
"non-conforming," which means they aren't eligible for
purchase by the Federal National Mortgage Association or
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. Most of the mortgages are
too large to be purchased by either agency. The issue is
rated triple-A by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard
& Poor's Corp. based on the quality of the underlying loans,
which are mostly from California, and an insurance policy
covering 10% of the deal from General Electric Mortgage
Insurance Co.</p>
