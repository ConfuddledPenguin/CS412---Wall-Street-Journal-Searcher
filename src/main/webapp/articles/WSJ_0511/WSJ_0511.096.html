	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Look who's `conflicted' now: the
psychiatrists.
   The American Psychiatric Association masses here on
Mother's Day weekend with a bit of guilt. It's the fifth year
in a row that the weighty annual meeting falls on the
maternal holiday and the 10th such clash in the past 22
years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"There have been questions raised," concedes Melvin
Sabshin, APA medical director. Complaints began in earnest
around 1985, when the group got its first woman president.
But "it isn't easy to accommodate" 16,000 people, says Dr.
Sabshin. Bookings are made years in advance; few cities can
handle such a big group; May is tough -- too early and the
weather's nasty, too late and members complain about missing
family graduations.</p>
<p>"I've often wondered why they don't examine their
collective psyche on this," says the wife of a Midwest
psychiatrist. (She prefers anonymity, noting, "I've kept my
peace this long.") Her husband is retiring after 40 years,
and she'll be with him in New York this weekend. But, "I'm
upset we're not going to be home to celebrate with our
children and grandchildren."</p>
<p>And well she should be, asserts Dorothy W. Cantor, a
psychologist in Westfield, N.J. "There's something sacred
about Mother's Day and Father's Day," says Ms. Cantor, who
has a general practice and has written about women's and
family concerns. From a clinical standpoint, too, Mother's
Day "is a big deal," she says.</p>
<p>The holiday can exacerbate any problems between mother and
child, says Ms. Cantor. She adds that some of her own
patients are "going through terrible things." The main
psychologists' group, the American Psychological Association,
steers clear of major holidays, holding its annual meeting in
the summer.</p>
<p>But the psychiatrists are working their problem through.
Next year, they'll meet on Mother's Day in New Orleans. But
in 1992, 1993 and 1994, the session will be on other weekends
in May.</p>
<p>As in corporate life, much of the change regarding women
comes from women themselves reaching positions of authority.
"The more you're in a position of leadership, the more what
you say gets attended to," says Elissa Benedek,
president-elect of the APA. She says all four of her children
are along for this year's meeting, although that hasn't
always been possible.</p>
<p>"I think it's very likely we'll not be scheduling any more
meetings on Mother's Day in the future," says Dr. Benedek.</p>
