	<p class="article-leader">PepsiCo Inc.'s recent multibillion-dollar trade agreement
with the Soviet Union sounds simple: Soviet ships and vodka
for U.S. soft drinks.
   But the accord -- the biggest to date between a U.S.
concern and the Soviet Union -- is stirring interest for more
than its size.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>On one hand, the agreement has helped thaw industrial
relations between two wary Arctic neighbors -- Norway and the
Soviet Union.</p>
<p>On the other, it is the clearest sign yet of increasing
flexibility on the part of Soviet trade negotiators, given
that it required a virtually unprecedented agreement between
two autocratic Soviet ministries.</p>
<p>PepsiCo says the new trade agreement will enable it to
more than double its sales within the Soviet Union to the
equivalent of about $2.5 billion by the year 2000. PepsiCo
won't be able to take any revenue from those sales out of the
country, but it will get the rights to export two products:
vodka and ships. It expects to sell $500 million of Soviet
vodka in the U.S. during the next 10 years, plus generate an
unspecified amount of revenue through sales and leases of 10
ships.</p>
<p>But PepsiCo didn't want the risks associated with the
shipping business, so it has reached an agreement with Per
Arneberg, a Bermuda-based Norwegian shipping mogul, to take
responsibility for marketing the ships. PepsiCo will get
fixed -- and unspecified -- revenue from the Arneberg group,
which will then take on all the risks and garner the
potential profits.</p>
<p>For Mr. Arneberg, the deal achieves his years-old dream of
building ships in the Soviet Union. Now he and some allies
have embarked on a plan to overhaul a half-dozen Soviet
shipyards where the vessels will be built.</p>
<p>The Norwegians will start by replacing outmoded designs to
make Soviet ships more attractive to Western buyers, then
spend millions of dollars to install modern shipbuilding
equipment.</p>
<p>Mr. Arneberg says Norwegian suppliers are lined up to
deliver everything from computerized ship-design centers to
turbo-charged marine engines. They're even bringing in beef
cattle requested by one Soviet shipyard near the Black Sea to
bolster local food supplies.</p>
<p>Historically, most Soviet-built ships have been delivered
to state-controlled domestic shippers. But the planned move
into the new world of export markets appears to be
well-timed. Global demand for new tonnage is soaring, while
new building slots at major shipyards remain virtually
unobtainable before 1993.</p>
<p>Still, even with Norwegian money and engineering prowess,
it won't be easy to repair the tarnished reputation of Soviet
shipbuilders. "Political risks and the threat of delays cause
most Western shipowners to try to get ships built just about
anyplace but the Soviet Union," says one Norwegian shipping
broker.</p>
<p>Adds Ole Jacob Libaek, president of another big Oslo
shipbroker and a close adviser to Mr. Arneberg: "To put it
bluntly, our challenge is to bring Soviet shipbuilding into
the 20th century."</p>
<p>Mr. Arneberg left Norway in the 1950s and, after
graduating from Cornell University in the U.S., built a
career in U.S. shipping. The recovery of shipping markets in
recent years whetted his interest in low-cost ships built in
Eastern Europe, but East Bloc regimes rebuffed his overtures
about selling ships to the West.</p>
<p>Mr. Arneberg got his big break in the summer of 1988, when
he turned to an old hunting and fishing chum, PepsiCo
Chairman Donald Kendall. The U.S. concern had been active in
the Soviet Union for years and, since 1972, had held
exclusive U.S. marketing rights for Soviet vodka under a
pioneering countertrade pact.</p>
<p>"But to expand capacity and distribution in the Soviet
Union, Pepsi needed something more vigorous and large scale
than simply selling vodka," a PepsiCo spokesman says.</p>
<p>Mr. Kendall balked at getting directly involved in
volatile shipping markets. But he agreed to sponsor Mr.
Arneberg in Moscow, where PepsiCo and its chairman wielded
considerable political clout.</p>
<p>Once in Moscow, Mr. Arneberg moved fast. "The Soviets were
sitting on a vessel that had been in inventory a while,"
recalls Chris Adamski, a PepsiCo official who participated in
the Moscow negotiations. Mr. Arneberg immediately agreed to
buy the ship, "showing that we could move quickly. The
Soviets were intrigued," he adds.</p>
<p>It still took almost a year longer than expected to hammer
out details of the trade accord. The biggest snag concerned
bureaucratic turf: PepsiCo's existing countertrade pact was
with the Ministry of Procurement and Agriculture. But Mr.
Arneberg would be buying ships from the Ministry of
Shipbuilding. "There was no formal linkage between the
ministries," Mr. Adamski says. "So the deal had to be
approved at a higher level, allowing foreign exchange earned
through the Shipbuilding Ministry's exports to be used for
the soft drinks industry," administered by the Agriculture
Ministry.</p>
<p>Mr. Arneberg is convinced that the number of ships
contracted and delivered will be much higher than the 10
promised -- between 75 and 80 vessels by 1995. If he
succeeds, PepsiCo would reap extra trade credits that it
could use to speed construction of Pizza Hut restaurants,
which it plans in collaboration with a Soviet joint-venture
partner.</p>
<p>Exploiting his inside track with the Shipbuilding
Ministry, Mr. Arneberg began ordering ships before the
PepsiCo agreement was concluded. Fram Shipping, the
Bermuda-based shipping concern where Mr. Arneberg until
recently was president, has taken delivery of seven Soviet
ships and has another 12 under construction. He says the
Soviets agreed to count three of those orders against
PepsiCo's 10-ship commitment.</p>
<p>Citing recent installation of a pacemaker, Mr. Arneberg
says he stepped down as Fram Shipping's president "to take it
a little easier." But he remains a director and adviser.</p>
<p>Fram Shipping's Soviet orderbook includes both bulk
carriers and tankers. Anticipating a legislative crackdown on
tanker design in the wake of recent oil spills, Mr. Arneberg
says all the tankers will be built with double bottoms and
double skins -- concentrating on medium-sized Aframax class
vessels of about 90,000 dead weight tons. Shipping analysts
in Oslo confirm that markets have easily absorbed the Soviet
ships delivered to Mr. Arneberg so far. Underscoring the
tight market conditions, Mr. Arneberg boasts of "tying up
three new Soviet tankers on 12-year charters with a
Scandinavian oil company." The 12-year duration is
exceptional -- more than double the normal period for tanker
charters, analysts say.</p>
<p>"We're building against what we believe future demand will
be three years from now," Mr. Libaek, his shipbroker adviser,
says. "We hope we're right."</p>
<p>Many analysts suggest Mr. Arneberg's problem lies less in
selling the ships than getting good ones built. But that
challenge, whetted by prospects of big orders, has galvanized
Norway's powerful shipping-supply industry and big banks to
clamor for a piece of the action.</p>
<p>Big Oslo banks like Den norske Banken and Christiania Bank
& Kreditkasse have provided financing for Mr. Arneberg's
initial Soviet ships, transactions in the range of $20
million to $30 million each. Anders Ingebrigtsen, the banker
in charge of Kreditkasse's $4 billion portfolio of shipping
loans, sees potential for much bigger future deals, perhaps
by packaging a number of these vessels in globally syndicated
credits.</p>
<p>"This project can be important for Norwegian industry,"
says Mr. Ingebrigtsen. "But it remains to be seen how fast
Mr. Arneberg and associates can develop the facilities and
how fast the Soviets are able to adjust."</p>
<p>Mr. Libaek, the Oslo shipping broker, is optimistic.
"We've already fought for years trying to get our technical
and commercial recommendations accepted," he says.
"Individually, most people at the shipyards had accepted
them. But you needed a change in politics for new ideas and
concepts to be taken seriously in the Soviet Union."</p>
<p>The Norwegian group is betting millions of dollars in
initial investments that the political change is for real.
The outlays to re-equip shipyards are to be gradually
recouped through a rebate on the price of each new ship
delivered.</p>
<p>"You'd go broke trying to pay for this on one ship," Mr.
Libaek says. "But the cost per contract can be acceptable,
spread over bigger volume."</p>
