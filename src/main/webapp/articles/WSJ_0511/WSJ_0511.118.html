	<p class="article-leader">BEIJING -- China announced the release of 211 prisoners,
including several prominent intellectuals, who were arrested
after the suppression of last year's pro-democracy movement.
   The freeing of the "lawbreakers," the second such mass
release in four months, doesn't necessarily signify a
softening of China's hard-line attitude toward dissent.
Instead, diplomats and Chinese intellectuals say, the move
seems aimed at improving China's image abroad and, in
particular, derailing U.S. lawmakers' efforts to take away
China's most-favored nation trade status.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Our leaders had one thing in mind: the {most-favored
nation} clause," said a Chinese scholar.</p>
<p>Western diplomats in Beijing say they doubt the move will
have much effect on U.S.-China trade deliberations in
Washington, even in light of China's decision last week to
lift martial law in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa.</p>
<p>"Releasing these people is a step in the right direction,"
said one Western diplomat. "But China hasn't gone far enough
to allay the concerns that the U.S. has expressed since last
June."</p>
<p>In Washington, top White House officials say Mr. Bush
hasn't made a decision about whether to extend China's
most-favored nation status. Officials suggest that Mr. Bush
may wait until close to the June 3 deadline before disclosing
his decision.</p>
<p>If Mr. Bush does extend the special trade status, a tough
battle lies ahead for China's opponents on Capitol Hill.
Under U.S. law, if Congress passes a resolution revoking
China's most-favored nation status, the president can veto
the measure. Lawmakers then would have to muster a two-thirds
majority to override the veto. Congressional staffers who
follow this issue say it could be difficult to win two-thirds
support to override the president.</p>
<p>U.S. business groups representing companies that import
goods from China already are pressing the case for continuing
China's most-favored nation status by warning that revocation
would mean a loss of American jobs and higher prices. And Sir
David Wilson, governor of Hong Kong, has written letters to
key Democrats and Republicans in both houses of Congress
warning that withdrawal of China's most-favored nation status
would be a "severe blow" to the British colony, a major
trading partner of the U.S. and China, Reuters news agency
reported.</p>
<p>If the most-favored nation status were to be withdrawn,
many of China's exports -- one quarter of which go to the
U.S. -- would become uncompetitive in U.S. markets. President
Bush has until June 3 to make his recommendation, after which
Congress will vote on the matter.</p>
<p>Domestically, the release of several well-known dissidents
may help to ease tension somewhat as Beijing tries to avert
possible unrest on June 3-4, the anniversary of last year's
massacre. China's leaders also have attempted to reassure the
nation's disaffected intellectuals recently with speeches
that have adopted a more tolerant and conciliatory tone.</p>
<p>With the release of the 211 prisoners, which was announced
by the official Xinhua news agency Thursday, China now says
it has freed a total of 784 people arrested in connection
with last year's demonstrations. Beijing's public security
departments are still investigating a further 431 people,
Xinhua said, adding that an unspecified number of additional
cases are being handled by China's judicial organs.</p>
<p>The statistics don't include the hundreds believed to have
been arrested outside of Beijing last year, after
anti-government demonstrations spread to dozens of cities
around the country.</p>
<p>The Xinhua report implied that those released had all
confessed their wrongdoing and shown repentance. It wasn't
possible to immediately confirm this with the released
dissidents.</p>
<p>Among those freed, the best-known is Dai Qing, a
muckraking journalist for the mass-circulation Guangming
Daily. Despite close connections to the family of the late
revolutionary hero Ye Jianying, the outspoken 44-year-old Ms.
Dai has long been a thorn in the side to China's conservative
Communist Party leaders.</p>
<p>Ms. Dai appeared to play a very small role during last
year's student movement. At one point, she made a speech to
students staging a hunger strike at Tiananmen Square. But in
that speech, she urged students to end the strike and return
to campus. Given this, many observers believe she was jailed
as part of a mass sweep of liberal intellectuals, rather than
for any specific wrongdoing related to last year's movement.</p>
<p>Another prominent intellectual released this week is Cao
Siyuan, who had been director of the Sitong Social
Development Research Institute, a think tank funded by the
semiprivate Stone computer group. Mr. Cao is one of China's
top legal minds, and drafted the nation's first bankruptcy
law. Mr. Cao was arrested last year for his role in proposing
a legal challenge to the declaration of martial law in
Beijing on May 20, two weeks before the massacre.</p>
<p>A number of well-known dissidents are thought to remain in
prison, facing possible trial and long-term incarceration.
They include Wang Dan, a student leader at Beijing
University; Bao Tong, former chief aide to disgraced party
chief Zhao Ziyang; Liu Xiaobo, an intellectual who advised
student protesters at Tiananmen; and Ren Wanding, a longtime
dissident who was arrested for the first time during China's
Democracy Wall movement of 1978.</p>
