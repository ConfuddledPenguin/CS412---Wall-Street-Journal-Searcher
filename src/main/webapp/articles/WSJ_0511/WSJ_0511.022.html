	<div class="article-body"><p>Heart patients who smoke are more likely to cut back on
cigarettes if they see the X-ray movies of their clogged
arteries.</p>
<p>Researchers at the University of Virginia showed 36
smokers the movies made of their coronary arteries during
angiography, when a fluid visible on X-rays flows through the
arteries, revealing sections where blood flow is restricted
by fatty deposits. Another 36 smokers were shown only
drawings of their clogged arteries. One to two years later,
most of the smokers in both groups had cut back on
cigarettes.</p>
<p>But among 17 of the smokers who underwent coronary-bypass
surgery, those who saw only drawings of their clogged
coronaries resumed their old smoking habits after surgery.
Bypass patients who viewed the actual films of their
arteries, however, kept away from cigarettes, particularly if
the films showed two or three arteries were clogged.</p>
<p>AUTOMATIC SHOCK</p>
<p>The widely hailed implantable, automatic defibrillator to
stop irregular heart beats does, indeed, save and prolong
lives.</p>
<p>The implantable defibrillator, which automatically
delivers a shock to the heart when it detects a
life-threatening change in the heartbeat, was invented at
Johns Hopkins's medical school in 1980. It was put on the
market in 1985.</p>
<p>So far the device has been implanted in about 7,000
patients at 100 medical centers around the world. A new study
shows that 94% are still alive five years later and 85% are
alive 10 years after implantation, says Levi Watkins of Johns
Hopkins. The 10-year survival rate shows the defibrillator is
"the most signigicant advance in the treatment of malignant
cardiac arrhythmias in this decade," Dr. Watkins says.</p>
<p>The device costs about $15,000, and implanting it costs
another $15,000. About 4% of the patients die as a result of
the surgery, and 5% more develop complications that require a
second operation. New lithium batteries have to be installed
every two years in the generator that is implanted in the
abdomen.</p>
<p>LOVE AND DEATH</p>
<p>Will sex kill me? It's a question that haunts many a
patient recovering from a heart attack.</p>
<p>Sexual intercourse places about the same degree of demand
on the heart as walking briskly or climbing two flights of
stairs, say three University of Florida doctors in the
journal Medical Aspects of Human Sexuality. "Generally, if a
patient can walk on a treadmill at more than two miles per
hour at a 10% grade" without any significant increase in
blood pressure or adverse changes in the electrocardiogram,
then "his/her exercise capacity should be sufficient to allow
for safe sexual relations with the usual partner," they
write.</p>
<p>For some anxious patients, a drug taken just before
intercourse might prevent the chest pains and reassure the
patients, they suggest. However, they add, "patients should
also be aware that extramarital sex has been associated with
a higher risk of sudden death."</p>
<p>BIGGER THAN BUSH</p>
<p>The heart gets heavy news coverage even without a
publicist. A computerized search through an electronic data
base of The Wall Street Journal's news pages found there were
433 separate news articles in 1989 that mentioned the heart,
at least as it related to medical matters. That's more
articles in the Journal's pages last year than those that
mentioned George Bush (397), Donald Trump (230), Michael
Milken (235), mutual funds (296), or cancer (265). Some
subjects, of course, received more attention. There were 597
articles that mentioned IBM, and more than 2,000 discussed
inflation.</p>
<p>MYSTERY UNMASKED</p>
<p>The riddle of "Syndrome X" may have been solved.</p>
<p>Syndrome X is characterized by chest pains similar to
those seen in coronary heart disease, but X-ray angiographic
studies fail to find any evidence of clogged coronary
arteries. The patients are hypersensitive to the catheter
that is threaded into the heart's coronary arteries during
the angiography procedure, a reaction rarely seen in coronary
heart-disease patients. Syndrome X patients often have
dysfunction of the esophagus and asthma-like constriction of
the bronchial passages.</p>
<p>The syndrome is seen in about 100,000 new patients every
year; about two-thirds are women.</p>
<p>"Many are labeled neurotic or hysterical when they do have
pain," says Richard O. Cannon III, a researcher with the
National Heart, Blood and Lung Institute. "They've been
mislabeled and dealt with poorly by health-care
professionals."</p>
<p>Dr. Cannon and other scientists now believe Syndrome X is
caused by abnormalities of blood vessels that are too small
to be seen by X-ray angiography. These tiny vessels serve the
so-called smooth muscles, which include not only the arteries
but also such tissues as the esophagus and bronchial tubes.
Some of the same drugs that relieve coronary-artery disease
seem to help many Syndrome X patients.</p>
<p>The researchers now call the condition "microvascular
angina." Because it involves more than just angina-like chest
pains, microvascular angina might not be the best name, says
Dr. Cannon. But, he adds, "patients prefer it to Syndrome X."</p>
<p>CHOLESTEROL CONFUSION</p>
<p>So you think your cholesterol level is, say, 210? Not
anymore. It's now 5.43.</p>
<p>In an example of monumentally bad timing, medical journals
changed the standard measuring unit for blood-cholesterol
levels just as the National Cholesterol Education Program
began its huge education effort to make the public aware of
the cholesterol-heart disease link.</p>
<p>The core of the NCEP -- a joint effort of the federal
government and private industry -- is guidelines on "risk
levels" of cholesterol in the blood, stated in milligrams of
cholesterol per deciliter of blood plasma, the fluid part of
the blood. A level below 200 is considered a "normal" risk;
above 240 milligrams per deciliter is considered a high risk.</p>
<p>Grams and liters are metric measurements that medical
journals have been using for years for weights and volumes
respectively. But about three years ago, U.S. medical
journals began switching to the Systeme International
d'Unites, or SI, the international system of measuring units.</p>
<p>In the SI, the proper units for stating the concentration
of a substance in a volume is moles per liter, the mole being
a standard number of atoms, molecules or particles. Thus,
blood-cholesterol levels are now stated in millimoles per
liter of blood plasma. A cholesterol level of 210 milligrams
per deciliter is now officially 5.43 millimoles per liter.</p>
<p>The change upsets some doctors. "We must not force
physicians to learn one system to be able to read the medical
literature and then have them translate the values into
another language that can be understood by the public," one
distressed doctor wrote the editor of the New England Journal
of Medicine.</p>
<p>AFTER THE ATTACK</p>
<p>You show up at your hospital with chest pains and after a
series of tests, your fears are confirmed: You've had a heart
attack or an attack of angina. What happens next?</p>
<p>Based on 35,000 such cases at Ohio State University
Hospitals in Columbus, here's a look at what to expect:</p>
<p>-- About 20% of patients diagnosed with heart disease have
bypass surgery.</p>
<p>-- 15% are referred for coronary angioplasty.</p>
<p>-- About 45% to 55% are treated with drugs, which
successfully alleviate symptoms for at least several years.</p>
<p>-- An additional 20% are treated initially with drugs,
half of whom come back for either angioplasty or bypass when
the drugs don't work. The rest are too sick for either
surgery or balloon treatment, and drugs are their only
option.</p>
