	<p class="article-leader">Cummins Engine Co. reached a standstill accord with
Industrial Equity (Pacific) Ltd., formally eliminating any
possibility that its biggest shareholder will boost its 14.9%
stake.
   In the pact, IEP, which last summer sparked speculation it
might begin an unsolicited bid for the Columbus, Ind.,
concern, promised not to increase its Cummins holdings or to
make any bid or tender offer for Cummins stock.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As part of the plan, both sides agreed to drop bitter
litigation born of Cummins's efforts to deter IEP's
overtures.</p>
<p>For public consumption, both sides described themselves as
good friends.</p>
<p>Bruce Hancox, board chairman of IEP's parent company, New
Zealandbased Brierley Investments Ltd., said his concern
never had any intention of making a tender offer for Cummins
shares and vowed to "pursue a harmonious relationship with
Cummins." Brierley is used by Sir Ronald Brierley of New
Zealand to make British and U.S. investments.</p>
<p>"We bought our shares of Cummins as an investment and
never intended to take any of the actions we have now
contractually agreed not to take," said Mr. Hancox.</p>
<p>Privately, Cummins claimed victory.</p>
<p>"Maybe the heat was getting such that IEP had to back
off," said one person familiar with Cummins's dealings with
IEP. "They apparently just decided that life is too short for
all this." Cummins had brought in congressional and
regulatory scrutiny of the stock purchases.</p>
<p>In seeking the agreement, IEP had asked for, but been
denied, a role on a shareholders advisory committee as part
of dropping the litigation, this person said. Instead,
Cummins agreed only to "meet with IEP twice a year in
Columbus, Ind."</p>
<p>"Of course, we didn't say who we'd have at the meeting,"
said the person from the Cummins side.</p>
<p>"I think Industrial Equity got a little more than they
bargained for," said Eli Lustgarten, an analyst with
PaineWebber Inc. "Cummins management has pretty much
entrenched themselves."</p>
<p>"We got tired of the litigation," said Rob Sutherland, an
IEP director and head of its California office. "We just
couldn't find it worthwhile spending months and months in
depositions when we have better things to do."</p>
<p>It's also possible IEP lost whatever appetite, if any, it
had for more Cummins stock. Cummins traded as high as $65
last July, when IEP more than doubled its stake, but by
October the stock had dropped sharply as Cummins's earnings
flagged. In composite New York Stock Exchange trading
yesterday, Cummins dropped 62.5 cents to $46.50.</p>
<p>IEP is the second big shareholder whose advances the
diesel engine maker has turned away. Last July, descendants
of Cummins's founding family bought Hanson USA's 8.8% stock
holdings to rid Cummins of that shareholder.</p>
