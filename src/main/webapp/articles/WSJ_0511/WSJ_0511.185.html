	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- French cosmetics giant L'Oreal S.A. hates
publicity.
   This year, for example, when L'Oreal realized that a big
capital gain had pushed its 1989 net profit up 43%, it didn't
boast. It tried to hide the gain. It announced that net
profit had gone up 17.3% -- the growth rate before capital
gains. Reporters had to hunt through annual report tables to
find what many companies would have considered good news.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>L'Oreal considers that kind of discretion in keeping with
its position as the world's largest cosmetics company. It
prefers to appear a quietly ticking machine, turning in
regular profit growth. Despite its best efforts, however, it
still sometimes makes waves.</p>
<p>In February it surprised the luxury-business world by
joining forces with the controversial Vuitton family to buy
control of the Lanvin fashion and perfume house. In previous
years, with its profits growing faster than its traditional
markets, it had sought diversification into the financial
futures market, magazine publishing and even movie-making.
Late in 1988, the conservative French concern, which still is
family-controlled, named as its new chairman a Welshman,
Lindsay Owen-Jones, a 21-year company veteran.</p>
<p>Like many L'Oreal officials, Mr. Owen-Jones, a
youthful-looking 44-year-old, has a way of wincing when asked
a pointed question. He rarely gives interviews, and
acknowledges that he prefers to do so when there isn't much
new to report.</p>
<p>But even L'Oreal can't keep entirely out of the public
eye. In one of those rare interviews a few days ago, Mr.
Owen-Jones agreed to discuss such questions as the Vuitton
alliance, Eastern Europe and the future of a company whose
principal family shareholders now are 65 or older.</p>
<p>The Vuitton alliance was announced in February, when
L'Oreal and a group of investors including Cie. Financiere de
Paribas bought minority shares in a Vuitton family-controlled
holding company called Orcofi SA. They said they hoped to
make Orcofi a new French luxury group. As a first step,
L'Oreal and Orcofi together bought 95% control of Lanvin,
each taking equal stakes.</p>
<p>The move was controversial for two reasons. First, the
Vuittons seemed to be upping the ante in their power struggle
with the management of competing luxury group LVMH Moet
Hennessy Louis Vuitton. The Vuitton family still holds a
large minority stake in Moet Vuitton, and has been trying to
push Chairman Bernard Arnault out of power. Moreover, Moet
Vuitton controls Dior and Givenchy perfumes, making it one of
L'Oreal's leading competitors.</p>
<p>Mr. Owen-Jones says that if Moet Vuitton ever were broken
up, he doesn't think antitrust laws would forbid L'Oreal from
bidding for its competitor's perfume business. But he insists
that his alliance with the Vuittons isn't aimed at attacking
Moet Vuitton.</p>
<p>"We have made it extremely clear that we have absolutely
no interest in Moet Vuitton and no hostile intention," he
says, adding that L'Oreal doesn't own any Moet Vuitton
shares.</p>
<p>The Vuitton alliance, says Mr. Owen-Jones, is intended to
give L'Oreal a peek into a part of the luxury market where it
hasn't much experience. Beginning as a supplier of hair dyes
to beauty salons in 1907, L'Oreal moved gradually into mass
market goods and then luxury beauty products. Up to now, its
luxury business has focused on scents and creams.</p>
<p>"We have extensive experience in marketing," Mr.
Owen-Jones explains, "but we lack experience in managing
luxury boutiques and we lack experience in leather. It
happened that the Vuitton family had just the complementary
experience."</p>
<p>L'Oreal may decide to extend its involvement in this end
of the luxury business, although it also may take as long as
five years to decide, based on an evaluation of the Lanvin
experience, Mr. Owen-Jones says.</p>
<p>Of more immediate concern, he says, are Japan, the U.S.
and East Europe.</p>
<p>L'Oreal, he says, is treating East Germany "very much as
an extension of West Germany. We are making it the clear
responsibility of our West German subsidiary. At the current
speed, it is reasonable to expect that East Germany won't
have to be treated as a separate country at all."</p>
<p>The rest of East Europe, however, offers less-bright
prospects, he says. He sees the possibility of a Hungarian
joint venture, but not until Hungarian law is clarified, and
he says the Soviet Union "in all probability will remain a
centralized country for some time."</p>
<p>Mr. Owen-Jones says there has been a luxury market in East
Europe for some time, appealing to local elites and often
financed through complex payment systems through third
countries. The problem, he says, is to create a mass market,
which probably means local production and will take time.</p>
<p>"It is important to be objective, and not claim that East
Europe will be a big boom in sales and profits," he says.</p>
<p>The goal in the U.S. and Japan, he says, is to make
L'Oreal's brands truly international, by winning substantial
market share outside Europe.</p>
<p>However, the biggest question hanging over L'Oreal is its
long-term ownership. It currently is majority controlled by
the holding company Gesparal S.A., which in turn is 51%
controlled by the family of Liliane Bettencourt, the only
daughter of L'Oreal's founder. Thought to be in her late 60s,
with one daughter, Mrs. Bettencourt often is described as the
richest woman in France.</p>
<p>The other 49% of Gesparal is controlled by Nestle S.A.,
the huge Swiss food group. Will Nestle some day take control
of L'Oreal?</p>
<p>"It is an obvious question mark," says Mr. Owen-Jones.
Nestle for now is "a stabilizing factor," helping prevent a
takeover. He says he can't comment on whether it some day
will be more. "It is a matter for speculation," he says.</p>
