	<p class="article-leader">DEATH IN BANGLADESH</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A Unicef-sponsored study in Bangladesh, where
diarrhea-related illnesses kill 300,000 children a year, has
found that complications from even mild malnutrition can kill
children suffering from normally minor diseases.</p>
<p>Unicef said the study found that hypoglycemia, which is an
abnormally low concentration of sugar in the blood and a
frequent consequence of malnutrition, was an important cause
of death in children with no overt signs of malnutrition.
Twenty-five percent of young diarrhea patients who died had
hypoglycemia, according to the study.</p>
<p>The hypoglycemic children studied had insufficient extra
body fat and protein to keep normal blood-glucose levels.
"This study illustrated how even mild or moderate degrees of
malnutrition can result in children dying from what might
have been only a minor illness in a better-nourished child,"
said Michael Bennish, who led the team that studied more than
2,000 children over eight months.</p>
<p>"Deaths {from hypoglycemia} could have been avoided if the
children had been fed during their illness, or if they had
been better nourished before they developed diarrhea," Dr.
Bennish said.</p>
<p>TELEPHONE INVESTIGATION</p>
<p>The European Community Commission began investigating
international telephone agreements to see if there was price
fixing in violation of EC competition rules. An EC official
said the probe was undertaken due to the growing significance
of international communications for the EC economy, the fast
growth in telecommunications as well as their rapid
technological development and rising costs. The official said
the commission was examining whether international phone
charges were being set by a few major telephone companies and
imposed on all members of the 160-nation International
Consultative Committee on Telegraph and Telephone.</p>
<p>TRAINING SOVIET MANAGERS</p>
<p>Finnish companies will train up to 400 Soviet business
managers a year, Finland's Trade and Industry Minister Ilkka
Suominen announced. The program, to get under way later this
year, will concentrate on areas in which Finland has special
know-how in order "to further promote bilateral trade"
between Finland and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>SOUTH AFRICAN GOLD PLAN</p>
<p>South Africa's state-aided Council for Mineral Technology
said the country should sell more of its gold as jewelry. The
council said South Africa had stifled jewelry production with
excessive regulations and taxes, ostensibly to earn
muchneeded foreign exchange as quickly as possible through
bullion exports, and had thus ignored the potential 25% added
value to be gained from selling gold as jewelry. South Africa
recently announced tax concessions and eased regulations to
encourage just such a shift.</p>
<p>TOYOTA ISSUES A DENIAL</p>
<p>Toyota Motor Corp. denied it tried to prevent T. Boone
Pickens from placing ads in Japanese newspapers in his battle
to assert ownership rights in Koito Manufacturing Co., the
Japanese auto-parts maker that is closely linked to Toyota.
Mr. Pickens, whose 26% stake in Koito makes him the company's
largest single investor, said Toyota tried to block him from
publishing the ads -- which mention Toyota -- in Japan's
major newspapers. The ads, which haven't yet run in Japan,
say that collusive business practices force higher prices on
consumers. Several Tokyo newspapers said they had held up the
ads and were considering publishing a version that omits
Toyota's name.</p>
<p>GERMAN BANK SCANDAL</p>
<p>Three bond traders at West Germany's Deutsche
Genossenschaftsbank, the nation's fourth-largest bank, were
arrested Wednesday on allegations that they personally
profited from bond-trading transactions. The arrests were
made at the bank. The three traders were in the bank's
domestic bond-trading department, which includes trading of
West German government bonds.</p>
<p>NICARAGUAN EXPORTS</p>
<p>Nicaragua has resumed exports to the U.S. now that a 1985
trade embargo has been lifted.</p>
<p>The Latin American nation shipped 18,000 metric tons of
sugar on Tuesday from the port of Corinto, part of the 54,328
metric tons Nicaragua can sell to the U.S. this year at a
preferred price above the world market. Former U.S. President
Ronald Reagan imposed the embargo as a measure against the
Marxist Sandinista government. President George Bush lifted
it after Violetta Chamorro de Barrios won the presidency in
February.</p>
<p>The U.S. had been the biggest buyer of Nicaraguan goods
until the embargo began. During the embargo, Nicaragua sold
most of its sugar to Soviet-bloc nations.</p>
<p>The U.S. embassy in Nicaragua said the Bush administration
is considering "steps to reduce barriers and tariffs and open
the market to Nicaraguan exports."</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>Bowing to U.S. threats to withdraw vital funding, the
World Health Organization shelved indefinitely a fresh
application by the Palestine Liberation Organization to join
as a full member. . . . France said it wouldn't attend next
month's world conference on AIDS in San Francisco because of
U.S. restrictions on granting visas to those with the
disease.</p>
