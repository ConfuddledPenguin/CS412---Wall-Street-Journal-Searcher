million deaths in 1987, almost as much as all other causes of
death combined. Nearly one-fifth of these people were under
age 65, and 5% were under age 45.</p>

<p>                     Heart History</p>
<p>A chronology of heart-care breakthroughs:</p>
<p>Early 1900s: Digitalis is the first drug used to treat
congestive heart failure by making the heart pump withmore
force.</p>
<p>1945: Anti-coagulants are introduced to help prevent blood
clots.</p>
<p>1947: Electric defibrillation, the use of an electric
shock, restores normal rhythm to a fibrillating heart.</p>
<p>1948: Cardiac catheterization, the process of advancing a
thin tube (catheter) into a vein, artery or heart chamber to
perform diagnostic studies, is developed.</p>
<p>1952: Diuretics are approved for used in treatment of
congestive heart failure and high blood pressure to help the
body eliminate excess salt and water.</p>
<p>1954: The heart-lung machine, a mechanical pump that
oxygenates and pumps blood during heart surgery, is
developed, making open-heart surgery possible.</p>
<p>1955: CPR or cardiac massage becomes an accepted technique
to revive an arrested heart.</p>
<p>1958: First external pacemaker is used to pace a baby's
heart after surgery.
</p>
<p>1959: Three major classes of therapeutic drugs are now
available: beta blockers, nitrates and anti-hypertensives.</p>
<p>1960: A pacemaker is successfully implanted.</p>
<p>-- First successful heart-valve replacement is performed
with a mechanical valve.</p>
<p>1962: Intra-aortic balloon pump, which temporarily
increases coronary-artery blood flow, is introduced.</p>
<p>1968: Coronary angiography allows physicians to examine
blood vessels or chambers ofthe heart by tracing the course
of dye that's been injected into the bloodstream.</p>
<p>-- Bypass surgery improves the blood supply to the heart
by constructing a detour around the blocked part of the
coronary artery using a blood vessel from another part of the
body.</p>
<p>-- The first heart transplantation occurs.</p>
<p>1969: The first artificial-heart implant takes place. It
was used for three days before the transplant of a human
heart.</p>
<p>1972: Anti-lipid drugs, to reduce the amount of serum
cholesterol circulating in the blood, are introduced.</p>
<p>-- Thrombolytic agents used to dissolve blood clots are
introduced.</p>
<p>1973: A genetic defect that raises blood cholesterol
levels and causes coronary heart disease is discovered.</p>
<p>1974: Calcium channel blockers are used to lower blood
pressure, reduce the frequency of angina attacks and help
prevent repeat heart attacks by reducing the heart's workload
and increasing its blood supply.</p>
<p>1977: Angioplasty, using balloons or lasers, is used to
open an occluded coronary artery.</p>
<p>1980: ACE inhibitors are used to open constricted blood
vessels.</p>
<p>1984: A large-scale human experiment proves that lowering
blood cholesterol levels reduces the risk of a heart attack.</p>
<p>1985: Implantable defibrillator becomes available to
restore normal rhythm to a fibrillating heart.</p>
