	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A moment of truth is nearing for Centex
Telemanagement.
   The highflying, San Francisco-based telephone service
company has captured the heart of Wall Street ever since
going public in 1987. Earnings and revenue have risen
sharply. Cash on hand has risen to $27 million. Long-term
debt is naught.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But developments in California's regulatory environment
are casting a shadow over Centex's bread-and-butter business.</p>
<p>Centex is like few other companies. It is part middleman,
part consultant, part telephone service manager. In return
for a fee, Centex links small businesses to the local
telephone company and routes customer calls over any of the
various lines and services offered by the local company as
well as AT&T, MCI and others.</p>
<p>Until now, Centex has benefited from an anomaly in
California's rates. Pacific Bell has a lock on the toll calls
within each local telephone area, such as from San Jose to
San Francisco. For California's small users, such local toll
calls are far more expensive than in other states. In fact,
Los Angelenos can talk to New Yorkers more cheaply than to
many of their in-state neighbors.</p>
<p>Centex has prospered by buying telephone service at the
bulk rates available to large users and offering savings to
small businesses. But California is restructuring rates. The
state's Public Utilities Commission is expected to open up
local toll calls to competition and to cut rates by as much
as 30% to 40%.</p>
<p>What's more, Pacific Bell asserts that Centex, among
others, rents a type of dial tone service at a price below
Pacific Bell's cost. Though Centex disputes this, some of
Centex's costs could well be raised. A PUC draft decision on
rate restructuring is expected this summer.</p>
<p>David Shantz, a program manager in the PUC's Division of
Ratepayer Advocates, which represents telephone users, says,
"Centex is what I call a price arbitrager. As toll rates come
down, the ability of Centex to compete will diminish."</p>
<p>Amy Newmark, an analyst with Homans McGraw Trull Valeo &
Co., sees "a major negative impact." Centex "won't be the
only game in town" for customers seeking an alternative to
Pacific Bell, and there will be less reason to seek such an
alternative, she says.</p>
<p>Peter Howley, an MCI and AT&T veteran who is chairman of
Centex, concedes that the changes in California might
adversely affect some of Centex's business, but he says that
in the long run Centex will benefit from increased
competition. Moreover, he asserts that the savings Centex
offers on California toll calls are a small part of its
appeal.</p>
<p>Although 80% of its billings are in California, Centex is
expanding on the East Coast. And Mr. Howley, in general,
plays down Centex's appeal as a discounter. "Five years ago,
it was easy to show a big saving," he says. Today, as long
distance competition heats up, analysts say the saving has
probably diminished.</p>
<p>Mr. Howley doesn't dispute this. He says Centex's basic
appeal is that it relieves small companies of the burden of
picking a carrier and of managing its phones. In a favored
phrase, Centex provides a "single point of contact" for a
customer's telephonic needs. That is intended to ring
nostalgic with those yearning for the simplicity of the Ma
Bell era.</p>
<p>Centex also offers various teleservices, such as reports
allocating a customer's calls to the customer's various
clients. James Hickey, an analyst with William Blair, says,
"They are that friendly voice you used to hear when you
called AT&T."</p>
<p>Jerry Oliver, a specialist on regulatory matters for Pac
Bell, agrees that Centex has carved out a niche as a
"telemanager."</p>
<p>But analysts say it costs Centex more time and money to
market to clients on the basis of service, rather than on
price. And while the company is upbeat about its expansion in
the East, analysts say Centex has yet to achieve the
economies of scale -- or the profit margins -- that it has in
California. Certainly, Centex's profit would seem to be
highly vulnerable to regulatory changes in its home state.</p>
<p>Ms. Newmark asserts that "telemanaging" requires no hard
assets and little technology or capital. Thus, she wonders
why, if the business is so good, Centex has yet to attract
much competition. Since the barrier to entry would seem to be
low, Ms. Newmark says Centex's stock should trade at a modest
multiple of earnings.</p>
<p>Tom Barton, a partner of Feshbach Brothers, which has sold
short some Centex stock, betting that it will drop, says,
"Centex's real game is rate arbitrage, and this game is
over." Mr. Barton could be wrong. But with Centex's stock
selling at 23 times estimates for 1990 earnings, investors
have a great deal to lose if he is right.</p>
