	<p class="article-leader">FOUR OUT OF 10 cardiologists take an aspirin tablet --
either once a day or every other day -- to reduce their own
risk of heart attack.
   That was among the findings of a Wall Street Journal
survey of cardiologists, doctors who specialize in treating
people for heart disorders. The purpose of the survey was to
determine not what cardiologists advise their patients to do
but what they themselves do in their daily lives to prevent
heart disease.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Four hundred cardiologists participated in the survey, in
the form of a written questionnaire. In addition to formal
questions, the doctors were also invited to provide written
comments.</p>
<p>The findings indicated that cardiologists tend to be more
aggressive than the general population in taking steps to
avoid heart disease in their own bodies. For instance, 63%
said they get a good cardiovascular workout at least three
times a week, and almost 98% said they don't smoke
cigarettes.</p>
<p>"Risk-factor control is very important. I practice what I
preach," said one physician. Another, W.F. Haynes Jr., a
cardiologist who practices in Princeton, N.J., wrote:
"Aerobics are the most important factor. I compete in
swimming and I'm 63 years old."</p>
<p>The doctors were probably most adamant on the subject of
smoking. "I rarely see any patient with heart problems under
the age of 65 -- unless they are smokers," said one
cardiologist. Another wrote that he blamed cigarettes for his
father's fatal heart attack, at age 47.</p>
<p>Based on their own example, the doctors rate the following
as the most important preventive steps: stopping smoking;
altering diet to reduce cholesterol; limiting intake of salt;
exercising; and taking aspirin.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most surprising result of the survey was the
large number of doctors who take aspirin -- especially given
the continuing medical controversy over whether aspirin
actually reduces the mortality rate. (Studies show it can
increase the risk of bleeding ulcer or stroke.) Of the 40%
who said they take aspirin, roughly half said they take a
single tablet every day, while the rest said they take one
tablet every other day.</p>
<p>The least popular action: eating oat bran. Only a third of
the doctors said they make a special effort to include oat
bran in their diets.</p>
<p>The cardiologists clearly felt these steps improved their
odds of survival. Asked about their own chances of dying from
a heart attack, 82% of the doctors said they thought that
their risk was equal to or below that of individuals of the
same age and sex. Only 18% thought their risks were greater
-- most of them citing either known heart disease or the
stress associated with their profession.</p>
<p>All but 4% of the doctors said they've tested their own
cholesterol levels; 17% said their levels were too high.
About 60% had gone a step further and taken at least one
treadmill stress test.</p>
<p>Only 6% of the survey respondents said they have heart
disease now.</p>
<p>A number of the doctors, however, wrote that they often
have trouble following their own advice. "My motivation to
exercise is like a yo-yo," said C.G. Reddy, a cardiologist in
Columbus, Ohio. Another doctor wrote: "I wish the fast-food
industry would create a prudent pizza."</p>
<p>Some said they believe the craze over cholesterol is
overblown. "The wrong segment of our population -- elderly
females and nonsmoking women -- are overly concerned about
their cholesterol, while men who smoke or who have
significant family history {of heart disease} are not,"
complained one physician.</p>
<p>Reed J. Wilson, a doctor in Beverly Hills, Calif., said
that the population's obssession with cholesterol was
intruding in his life. "I recently attended a charity affair.
I chose meat over fish for dinner, and through the whole meal
I had to listen to each person's opinion of my diet. It was
difficult not to comment as I watched each of them put ranch
dressing on their `healthy salads,' thick hollandaise sauce
on their `healthy fish' and then finish with a heavy layer of
caramel and chocolate on their ice-cream dessert (oh, but
they only ate half)."</p>
<p>Several doctors expressed the belief that the profession
is on the verge of making great strides in reducing heart
attacks. "I believe aggressive vegetarian regimens and
relaxation techniques can reverse heart disease," said J.
Gary Grant, a cardiologist in Pacific Grove, Calif. Another
doctor, James Nilson, wrote: "A more thorough analysis of
risk factors, together with improved techniques for early
detection, should decrease the incidence of {heart atttacks}
in our country markedly."</p>
