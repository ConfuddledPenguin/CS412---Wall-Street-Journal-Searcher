	<p class="article-leader">AH, THE HEART. Can't live without it. Yet how most of us
abuse it] This is especially true of office-bound middle
managers who go from bed to train to desk to home again, with
nary a thought of how our poor ticker is expected to carry
the strain.
   Now, thanks to advancements in exercise science, it is
possible to make the most of your busy schedule -- and keep
your pump in superb working shape at the same time] How? By
using the same workout principles practiced by shapely
dancers and narcissistic California beefcakes. We're talking
aerobics] And we're talking now]</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yes, at every point in your working day, opportunities for
cardiac maintenance abound if you seize upon them. Consider.</p>
<p>WAKE-UP WARM-UP: Fitness is a state of mind that you can
invoke from the moment you pop open your orbs. Make sure to
set the alarm at least 30 minutes too early for human
civilization. As the buzzing, beeping or ringing assaults
you, allow a flood of fears and anxieties attached to the
coming 12 hours to overwhelm your consciousness.</p>
<p>Got a huge presentation before a cadre of unfriendly
securities analysts at noon? A performance review at 3? Feel
the weight of the impending business day press down upon you.
Feel your heart pounding. You haven't even gotten out of bed
yet] Now lift the entire mass of your schedule onto your
spirit and hit the shower] Make it a cold one] Use a rough
towel] You're in the aerobic swing now]</p>
<p>LIMBERING IN TRANSIT: Be sure to prepare before engaging
in any serious jumping and stumping. As you place your coat
on the overhead rack on the train, make sure to reach as far
as you can over the people sitting on the inner seats. If, on
the other hand, you are forced to stand, stretch your legs
and don't forget to use your elbows to shove other people
away from you.</p>
<p>RUNNING WITH WEIGHTS: As you leave the bus or train, run
with your briefcase clutched to your chest. While you are
doing so, keep your mind on what will happen if you are late
for your morning muffin with the controller one more time.
Wow] What a surge of cardiac activity] This exercise is most
effective for attorneys and financial officers, whose
briefcases often resemble steamer trunks. Stretch and firm]
Bend and wheeze] Extend your life by moments]</p>
<p>CONTINUOUS ACTION: As any aerobic philosopher will tell
you, sporadic movement is worthless. The body must be prodded
into sustained activity of sufficient duration to keep your
pulse rate pumping at a frenzy. That's good news for many
middle managers who spend their day in constant motion --
shifting from foot to foot outside offices, bolting back to
make a brief appointment, fleeing across town for something
that your former support staff used to do and then hustling
back to the office for a three-floor search for the computer
consultant who's supposed to fix the hard drive.</p>
<p>So while you're hurtling hither and yon, feel good about
yourself. You're doing more for your ticker than the skinny
Mr. Universe types who come back after a lunchtime workout
with their hair slicked back and their faces a sanguine shade
of purple. And while you're darting around, take your heart
rate, like so: Place any two fingers (not your thumb) on the
throbbing vein just underneath your jaw. If it's doing the
Lambada, congratulations] You're alive]</p>
<p>USE EVERY MOMENT: Anyone who has studied the video
literature knows that the best aerobic exercise involves some
sort of limb pumping. Now here's the good news: Recent
discoveries indicate that your arms may be pumped in and out
during most normal business phone calls.</p>
<p>First, figure out whether the conversation is a typical
one -- that is, 40% meat and 60% air. If it is, then begin as
follows: Extend whichever arm is holding the receiver well
away from your ear during those times when you feel it's safe
to do so. After a while, return the receiver to your ear and
check things out. When it once again seems appropriate,
forcefully pump your arm outward again. Repeat until
conversation is ended. Feel good? It should. You're not only
building muscle. You're building sanity]</p>
<p>EAT TO LIVE, LIVE TO EAT: My wife's aerobics teacher
passed along a theory I find immensely attractive: Your body
uses more calories to digest broccoli than lettuce. I'm not
about to find out whether that's true. I assume it is. And
the implications are enormous. If your poor body must labor
mightily to digest indigestible greenstuffs, think how
difficult it must be for your system to process a bag of
greasy burgers and french fries? What a chore] Better still,
food ingested at warp speed must tax the body system even
more. The goal here, then, for maximum aerobic value, must be
to gobble hard-to-digest food really fast. So opt for that
liver smothered in onions and a half-bottle of petulant
Mersault. That's adding miles to your coronary lifespan]</p>
<p>THE BEST REST: Right after lunch is the perfect time to
cool down. But again, you don't have to waste this time.
Classic aerobic theory tells us that it is desirable to keep
your hands above the level of your heart, which explains why
one may see gymnasiums full of exercising people waving their
arms above their heads like crazed sun worshippers. If this
is so, does not the same principle apply to the feet? Of
course it does. A satisfactory position of pedal elevation
may be achieved by keeping your feet firmly planted on your
desk as often as possible. Doesn't that feel good? Your heart
thanks you.</p>
<p>STIMULATE THAT ENGINE: In general, throughout the day,
business life offers many occasions to jump-start the heart
without coffee. Who's that on the phone? The senior vice
president of finance? Your third stab at the fourth-quarter
numbers were off by how much? Here comes the interoffice mail
telling you that merit increases in 1990 will be limited to
how little? Good God] Now take your heart rate. It's up
there, right? And how] A morning in the trenches is as
aerobically valuable as two hours of killer squash]</p>
<p>KEEP LUBRICATED: As everybody knows, the hale and hearty
like to follow workouts by drinking clear beverages that
replenish their amino acids, salts and other nutrients.
Sometimes these people even place the sweating, cold
container against their fevered muscles for instant, topical
relief. After work, I find a full six ounces of clear
beverage is most salubrious not only for my heart but for
just about every other working part of my anatomy as well.</p>
<p>The olive is optional. But highly recommended.</p>
