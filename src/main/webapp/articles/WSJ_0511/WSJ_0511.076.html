	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Dow Jones & Co. named Carl M. Valenti, 51
years old, to the additional post of president of the
Telerate Inc. financial information-service subsidiary.
   Mr. Valenti retains his position as senior vice president
of the parent. At the same time, Dow Jones said, John D.
Jessop, 47-year-old senior executive vice president of
Telerate, resigned.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We regret" the resignation, a Dow Jones spokesman said,
"but it's not uncommon after a merger, and with greater
parent-company involvement in operations, for a dedicated and
responsible executive to leave." Dow Jones closed the
acquisition of Telerate in January.</p>
<p>The resignation "doesn't reflect any difference in
fundamental priorities, plans and business objectives at
Telerate and Dow Jones," the spokesman said. He added,
however, that the resignation was unexpected.</p>
<p>Mr. Jessop, who was named to his current post effective
March 1, declined to comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Valenti has had overall responsibility for the
direction of both Telerate and Dow Jones's Information
Services group, of which he remains president and publisher.
Dow Jones said he will press ahead with projects in progress
to further strengthen the position of the parent and
subsidiary in the electronic-information field.</p>
<p>Dow Jones also publishes The Wall Street Journal, Barron's
magazine, and community newspapers.</p>
