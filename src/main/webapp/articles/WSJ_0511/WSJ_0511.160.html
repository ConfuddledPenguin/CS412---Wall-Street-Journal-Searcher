	<p class="article-leader">Sears, Roebuck & Co. Chairman Edward A. Brennan said at
the annual meeting that sales would strengthen in the second
half.
   Facing shareholders who expressed displeasure over Sears's
stagnant earnings and stock price, Mr. Brennan also
reiterated his goal of achieving a return on equity of more
than 15% "over time." He wouldn't specify when the goal might
be met. The retailing and financial services company's return
on average equity in 1989 was 10.9%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>G. Leslie Fabian, a large shareholder from New York, drew
applause when he noted that per-share earnings and dividends
haven't grown as much as other companies in the Dow Jones
stock averages. "My question is one word: When?" he asked.</p>
<p>"We agree with you," Mr. Brennan responded. "We're not
happy with our performance. . . . You are impatient. I don't
blame you, so am I."</p>
<p>In 1989, Wilmington, Del.-based Sears had a 3.8% rise in
net income to $1.51 billion, or $4.30 a share, from $1.45
billion, or $3.84 a share, in 1988.</p>
