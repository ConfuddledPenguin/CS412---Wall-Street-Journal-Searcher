	<p class="article-leader">A federal appeals court ruled that begging can be banned
on New York's subway system by the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority.
   The court overturned a lower court decision that
prohibited the subway system from enforcing rules against
begging. The appeals-court panel rejected Judge Leonard
Sand's ruling earlier this year that begging and panhandling
are forms of speech protected under the First Amendment of
the U.S. Constitution.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"A majority of the subway's over three million daily
passengers perceive begging and panhandling to be
`intimidating,' `threatening,' and `harassing,'" the appeals
court said. "We think that the district court's analysis
reflects an exacerbated deference to the alleged individual
rights of beggars and panhandlers to the great detriment of
the common good."</p>
<p>The appeals court said the government's interest in
keeping the subway system safe and orderly outweighed any
concerns about restrictions on free speech. The court said
beggars' rights to free speech weren't violated because the
rules aren't meant to suppress any particular message.</p>
<p>"The only message that we are able to espy as common to
all acts of begging is that beggars want to exact money from
those whom they accost," the appeals panel said in its
majority opinion.</p>
<p>The Legal Action Center for the Homeless, which
represented the two homeless men who brought the suit, said
it is considering an appeal. "Silencing poor people will not
solve the homeless problem, the hunger problem or the begging
problem," said Douglas Lasdon, executive director of the
center.</p>
<p>Mr. Lasdon said the case has been widely misunderstood by
people who saw it as a defense of intimidating or threatening
behavior on the subway system.</p>
<p>"We only sought to protect peaceful begging," he said. He
added that the center was defending the right of people to
beg only in certain parts of the transit system -- not on
subway trains or in areas where it would impede subway users.</p>
<p>The appeals court said surveys indicate that two-thirds of
the subway's 3.5 million daily passengers say they have felt
intimidated into giving money to beggars. "It is fair to say
that whether intended as so, or not, begging in the subway
often amounts to nothing less than assault, creating in the
passengers the apprehension of imminent danger," the court
said.</p>

<p>INSURANCE CAN'T BE USED to pay punitive damages in New
York.</p>
<p>The federal appeals court decision apparently is the first
to apply a ruling by New York state's highest court in
January that punitive damages aren't covered by insurance for
companies in New York, even if the damages were awarded in
another state.</p>
<p>The court said American Home Products Corp. can't make its
insurer, Home Insurance Co., pay the $13 million in punitive
damages in a product-liability case. The damages were awarded
by an Illinois jury for injuries a two-year-old boy sustained
after taking aminophylline, used to treat respiratory
ailments.</p>
<p>After American Home claimed that its insurance should
cover the damages, Home Insurance sued in federal court in
New York, where the two companies are based. Applying the
state Court of Appeals decision, which was considered a major
victory for insurers, the federal appeals court reversed a
lower-court ruling that the damages were covered.</p>
<p>The federal appeals court asked the state court to resolve
the issue because it was the first time the matter had come
up in New York. The state court said that making insurers pay
would circumvent the purpose of punitive damages.
Manufacturers say product-liability insurance is meant to
cover such expenses.</p>
<p>Sheila Birnbaum, an attorney for Home Insurance, said her
client was satisfied with the decision. American Home lawyers
couldn't be reached for comment.</p>

<p>SHOWDOWN LOOMING over authority of federal bankruptcy
judges.</p>
<p>Federal appeals courts in St. Louis and New York have
split on the question of whether bankruptcy judges may hear
jury trials involving allegedly improper transfers of a
bankrupt company's assets. The conflicting rulings may
require the U.S. Supreme Court to resolve the issue, legal
experts say.</p>
<p>Many bankruptcy lawyers say the question is significant
because asset-transfer disputes often involve large amounts
of money and should be resolved quickly. These lawyers
contend that delays are less likely with bankruptcy judges,
because they are specialists in such matters, and because
their caseload is lighter than that of U.S. district judges.</p>
<p>District judges would hear the cases if bankruptcy judges
are found not to have the authority to do so. District courts
were formed by the Constitution, but bankruptcy courts were
created by Congress. Bankruptcy law is unclear on the issue
on who should hear jury trials. Such trials often involve the
fraudulent conveyance of assets or preferential treatment of
creditors.</p>
<p>"The one thing the war on drugs has done is inundate the
district courts with criminal cases, which have priority over
civil suits," says R. Pete Smith, a bankruptcy lawyer with
McDowell, Rice & Smith in Kansas City, Mo. "The federal
docket is just very crowded."</p>
<p>But other lawyers argue that the district judges should
hear such cases anyway, because they are more experienced at
handling jury trials.</p>
<p>In the St. Louis case, Mr. Smith brought suit on behalf of
the bankruptcy trustee of Kroh Brothers Development Co.
against United Missouri Bank of Kansas City. The suit sought
recovery of about $4 million, plus interest, that it alleged
was improperly transferred to the bank. The bankruptcy judge
granted United Missouri's request for a jury trial, but
refused its motion to move the case to district court. Last
month, a three-judge appeals-court panel in St. Louis held
the bankruptcy court wasn't authorized to hear it.</p>
<p>The court said it couldn't find any language in the
federal bankruptcy stautes or legislative history to support
such authority, and didn't see any reason to imply it. But it
acknowledged that its ruling conflicted with a decision in
February by the federal appeals court in New York. That court
found both statutory and constitutional grounds for
permitting bankruptcy judges to preside over jury trials.</p>
<p>"It's an interesting issue," says Thomas E. Deacy Jr., a
lawyer in Kansas City with Deacy & Deacy, counsel for United
Missouri Bank. "I would think it's likely to end up in the
Supreme Court."</p>

<p>NEW JERSEY SETS GUIDELINES for its new family-leave law.</p>
<p>The guidelines, issued by the state attorney general's
office, were more liberal to employees than many labor
lawyers had expected. The law, which went into effect Friday,
requires New Jersey companies with more than 100 employees to
provide 12 weeks of unpaid leave every two years to workers
who need to care for newborn or adopted babies or for a sick
member of their immediate family.</p>
<p>But the guidelines for complying with the law have added a
new twist. They say the law covers not only companies in New
Jersey, but employees who work in the state and are employed
by companies located elsewhere.</p>
<p>"Up until now, this had been considered somewhat of a
local law. Only New Jersey companies have been focusing on
it," said Paul A. Tufano, a labor lawyer at Philadelphia's
Blank, Rome, Comisky & McCauley. "Who would have thought that
companies across the country will have to comply?"</p>
<p>The New Jersey division of civil rights, which drafted the
guidelines, has been fielding scores of nervous phone calls
from employers. "Oh, they're horrified. They're wailing like
babies," said James J. Sincaglia, a special assistant in the
civil-rights division. "I appreciate the dilemma they're in,
their concern that the law is a little too comprehensive."</p>
<p>This year, the law covers companies with 100 or more
employees, but next year, the threshold will drop to 75. The
year after, it drops to 50. It is considered to be the
nation's most generous leave law because it requires
employers to maintain benefits for employees on leave.</p>
<p>The guidelines don't carry the force of law; they are only
offered for guidance.</p>
<p>The state attorney general's office plans to hold public
hearings this summer before drafting permanent regulations
that will be binding.</p>

<p>U.S. SUPREME COURT IS ASKED to rehear religious-freedom
case.</p>
<p>A diverse coalition of religious and civil-liberties
organizations filed a petition with the high court, seeking a
rehearing of its recent decision that the state of Oregon
didn't violate American Indians' religious freedom by barring
the use of peyote in religious ceremonies.</p>
<p>By a 6-3 ruling April 17, the court upheld Oregon's
refusal to pay unemployment benefits to Alfred Smith and
Galen Black, who were fired from their jobs at a private
drug-rehabilitation center for using peyote during ceremonies
of the Native American Church. Oregon classifies peyote as an
illegal drug. The church regards peyote as a sacrament.</p>
<p>The petition, prepared by the American Jewish Congress and
the Native American Program of Oregon Legal Services, argues
that the ruling "took a major step away from settled law" in
the First Amendment's free-exercise-of-religion clause.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court on rare occasions grants rehearing of a
case it previously refused to decide. But the court hardly
ever grants rehearing of cases, such as the peyote case, that
have been argued and decided on the merits.</p>

<p>KENNETH R. FEINBERG, The Washington, D.C., arbitration and
mass tort specialist, has stepped down as a trustee for the
Dalkon Shield Claimants Trust, the $2.45 billion settlement
fund for women injured by the Dalkon Shield contraceptive.
Mr. Feinberg, who was the first trustee named to the fund,
said he quit because of other professional commitments. The
trust fund, which is paying claims for injuries caused by the
Dalkon Shield, was created as part of the bankruptcy-law
reorganization of A.H. Robins Co. of Richmond, Va., which
sold the device. The five-member trust has two vacancies.</p>
