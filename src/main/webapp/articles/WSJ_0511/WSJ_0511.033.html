	<p class="article-leader">Motorola Inc. said it plans to introduce Monday a computer
chip it claims runs as fast as some supercomputers and that
can create color video, stereo sound and graphics signals --
the elements of a technology called multimedia.
   Motorola is pitting the new chip, called the 96002,
against arch-rival Intel Corp.'s superfast 80860 chip.
Intel's chip was introduced last year with much fanfare, and
has been a big success in some of the applications at which
Motorola is aiming.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We're giving you more processing power for fewer dollars"
than Intel, said Mike Collins, Motorola's marketing manager
for the chip. Over 150 customers world-wide have requested
supplies of the chip, Motorola added.</p>
<p>But the chip may be handicapped by its lateness to market.
Intel already has signed up some of the customers who might
have designed the Motorola chip into their products, had it
been available last year as was Intel's, said Michael Slater,
editor of Microprocessor Report, a newsletter.</p>
<p>Although the 96002 does many tasks better than does the
Intel chip, Mr. Slater said, "the prospects would have been
better had it been here a year earlier."</p>
<p>The Motorola chip's forte will be in computers that
process the huge amounts of digital data needed to represent
moving pictures, voices and three-dimensional graphics using
a technique called digital-signal processing.</p>
<p>The Schaumburg, Ill., company said that customers already
are designing the chip into products such as color laser
printers, navigation systems to keep track of ships around
the globe and so-called CAT-scanners used by doctors to look
into the human body.</p>
<p>One company, Ariel Corp., Highland Park, N.J., has
designed the chip into an add-on board meant to let personal
computers perform multimedia tasks by processing sound and
moving-video data, something conventional chips are too slow
to do.</p>
<p>One of the chip's strengths for multimedia tasks is its
speed in the type of calculation needed for digital-signal
processing. Motorola said the 96002 will process 165 million
operations -- such as addition or multiplication -- every
second; Intel's 80860 runs at only 99 million operations a
second. Another plus is its price: $750 for sample chips that
will be available Monday, or 65% cheaper than Intel's
mass-produced chip, Motorola added.</p>
<p>The chip is fast in part because it crams in functions
that are usually done by additional chips. It also sports a
unique feature: using a house as an analogy, older chips
crowd incoming and outgoing data through the same front door,
or "port"; Motorola's new chip can take new data through the
front door while sending completed calculations or commands
out the back door.</p>
