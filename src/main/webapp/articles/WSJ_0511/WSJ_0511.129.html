	<p class="article-leader">Stock prices followed the bond market higher despite the
unspectacular reception given the Treasury's sale of $10
billion in 30-year bonds.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 5.63 points, to
2738.51 in moderately active trading. But the dollar
continued its slump against the mark.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts said that although there wasn't strong demand for
the $10 billion of 30-year bonds that the Treasury auctioned,
it was sufficient to reinforce perceptions that interest
rates have peaked. The average yield on the bonds was 8.84%.
Last week, yields on the previously issued 30-year bond
reached a one-year high of 9.03%.</p>
<p>Traders said that with the auction overhanging the stock
market, it has been difficult to gauge the recent strength in
stock prices. "Everyone obviously keeps saying, `How's the
auction going, how's the auction going?'" says Larry
Greenwald, a block trader at Sanford Bernstein & Co.</p>
<p>The risk that interest rates might move higher in coming
weeks has kept many stock-market investors on the sidelines
recently. They've been afraid that a resurgence in inflation
would force the Federal Reserve to drive short-term interest
rates higher to slow the economy, and cool corporate profits
along with it.</p>
<p>But recent economic statistics indicate that slower growth
may occur without any nudging from the Fed. With investors
generally eager to purchase Treasury debt, especially the
$10.5 billion of three-year notes auctioned Tuesday, much of
the anxiety about an interest-rate spurt has eased.</p>
<p>But analysts caution that stock prices aren't likely to
head skyward anytime soon. For one thing, investors are still
awaiting more evidence about inflationary trends. The release
today of the April producer price index, a measure of
wholesale inflation, isn't expected to help much. Economists
predict it will be up about 0.2%. That's an annualized rate
of about 2.5%, but it compares with a 0.2% decline in March.
Consumer prices, which have been rising considerably faster
than wholesale prices, will be reported next week.</p>
<p>Longer term, analysts point to poor corporate earnings as
another drag on stock prices. Although comparisons should
improve later this year with year-earlier results, few
investors are willing to bet heavily that earnings will
rebound sharply.</p>
<p>In currencies, much of the attention was focused on the
dollar/Swiss-franc exchange rate, as recent demand for the
francs eased slightly. Swiss francs had become highly
desirable because of higher interest rates in Switzerland and
Japanese purchases of the currency to pay for maturing bonds
denominated in Swiss francs. In late New York trading, the
dollar was at 1.3880 Swiss francs, down from 1.4025.</p>
<p>In major market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices rose in fairly active trading. Volume totaled
158.5 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, where
advancers led losers 847 to 601.</p>
<p>The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading the U.S.
currency was quoted at 1.6285 marks and 156.70 yen compared
with 1.6360 marks and 156.50 yen.</p>
