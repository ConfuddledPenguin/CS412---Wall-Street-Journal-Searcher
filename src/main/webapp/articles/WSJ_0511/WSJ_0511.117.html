	<p class="article-leader">THE HEART IS an unreliable sentinel, so silent that no
diagnostic tool can safely and reliably screen it for
disease. As many as 60% of the more than one million
heart-attack victims each year have no warning that they are
sick.
   But imagine a new machine, a breakthrough in diagnosing
heart disease. It would be highly reliable. It wouldn't
require surgery or other invasive procedures. The test would
tell doctors who has coronary disease and who hasn't, how
sick victims are, and what the best treatment methods may be.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>According to many cardiologists, such a tool exists. A
test using positron emissions tomography, or PET, scanners,
they say, could radically alter the attack on heart disease.</p>
<p>So what's the problem?</p>
<p>Plenty. The PET test faces an enormous battle as it works
its way through the labyrinth of medical economics and
government approvals. Heated disputes among cardiologists
also may slow the process -- as may fights among
manufacturers. "We could be saving a lot of lives," says K.
Lance Gould, a cardiologist at the University of Texas
Medical Center and a leading proponent of the use of PET
scanning. "But things move a lot slower than you might
think."</p>
<p>Although the basic technology for PET scans has existed
for more than 20 years, it only recently has begun to gain
credibility as a valuable diagnostic tool for cardiologists.
Many heart doctors still don't even know it exists.</p>
<p>PET scanners are large, doughnut-shaped machines that take
three-dimensional photographs of blood as it flows through
the heart. During the test, a doctor gives a patient an
intravenous injection of a radioactive tracer. As the tracer
decays, it emits positrons that are picked up by the scanner
and transformed by a computer into vivid color pictures of
the heart.</p>
<p>PET scans allow doctors to precisely measure the metabolic
activity of the heart muscle in addition to the quality of
blood flow through each of the heart's four chambers. The
test is conducted first with the heart at rest and then under
stressed conditions -- using a drug that simulates exercise.
This gives doctors before-and-after pictures that allow them
to assess damage to heart muscles as well as to determine
whether blood flow is being impaired by atherosclerosis. By
being able to see exactly what part of the heart is affected,
doctors can also figure out which arteries are obstructed and
by how much.</p>
<p>Currently, the only procedure that exceeds the PET scan in
reliability is coronary angiography. Angiography provides
doctors with vivid X-ray pictures of clogged arteries, but
because it is an invasive procedure that requires snaking a
catheter through the body, it also carries much higher risk.
As a result, angiography is used only with patients who have
already had heart attacks or are deemed to be at extremely
high risk. Another widely used test, the thallium scan, has a
lower accuracy rate than PET and isn't popular as a screening
device for patients who don't have obvious cardiac-disease
symptoms.</p>
<p>PET scans, on the other hand, carry virtually no risk and
are highly accurate -- replicating the results of angiography
as much as 98% of the time. They also cost roughly half as
much as a $3,500 angiogram.</p>
<p>"The PET scan has significant potential," says John
Mazziotta, professor of neurology and radiology at the UCLA
School of Medicine. He notes that, in many diseases, the
earliest changes in the body are biochemical. Since this is
what the PET scan sees, "the ideal way to use this is in
detecting disease before people develop symptoms," he says.
PET scans also are accurate in measuring the progress of
patients who have had bypass operations or other treatments
for heart disease, as well as in evaluating candidates for
such procedures.</p>
<p>But it is the potential for early detection of heart
disease that offers the most exciting benefits -- both in
terms of saving lives and in reducing the enormous expense
associated with treating people who have heart attacks. The
American Heart Association estimates that the annual cost of
cardiovascular disease -- including medical and nursing care
and lost productivity -- totals $94.5 billion.</p>
<p>Yet as promising as it is, the PET scan faces an uphill
battle in winning acceptance. One of its biggest hurdles is
the Catch-22 of medical economics. With only 50 working
scanners in the U.S., many of them built experimentally, the
procedure is expensive -- costing about $1,800 per test.
Though much cheaper than angiography, that is substantially
more than other current screening devices, such as the
treadmill stress test.</p>
<p>Even though wider application could substantially reduce
the cost of PET scans -- some proponents believe a $600 price
is attainable -- neither the government nor insurance
companies will reimburse PET tests at current levels. That
leaves hospitals to take a risk few are willing to chance:
buy the scanner now in hopes that reimbursement will occur
down the road.</p>
<p>"The current state of medical economics dictates that
government and insurance companies be more conservative than
they've been in the past," says Landis Griffeth, assistant
professor at Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Washington
University in St. Louis. At the same time, he adds:
"Hospitals have to be fiscally realistic. They can go broke
setting up something they're not going to get paid for."</p>
<p>The proponents of PET technology also have a running feud
with other doctors. Many cardiologists resist PET tests
because they stand to lose economically if the test supplants
current stress tests. That's because PET tests would probably
be done at major medical centers -- in contrast to stress
tests, which can be done in doctors' offices and are thus a
major source of revenue in private practices.</p>
<p>"This is basically a nasty catfight," says J. Michael
McGehee, executive director of the Institute for Clinical
PET, which is based in Washington, D.C., and set up mostly to
lobby the government on behalf of PET. "You have thousands of
cardiologists every day doing thousands of stress tests.
{Some proponents of PET} would stop that. They are advocating
taking this away from the cardiologists."</p>
<p>Even the manufacturers of PET scanners are squabbling
among themselves. Some of the equipment only works well with
radioactive tracers produced by huge -- and expensive --
cyclotrons. The manufacturers who make these scanners,
including Siemens Corp. and General Electric Co., generally
favor more specialized use of PET scanners in heart
applications.</p>
<p>Because their scanners work better in some brain-related
applications, they also are promoting PET for that purpose.</p>
<p>But other scanners, made by Positron Corp. of Houston, use
a radioactive tracer called rubidium. These don't work well
for scanning the brain, but rubidium can be produced in a
small machine about the size of a briefcase -- avoiding the
need for a $3 million cyclotron. (The briefcase-sized
machines are made by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.) The proponents
of these scanners contend that PET should be widely used as a
screening device for heart disease.</p>
<p>This latter group is currently losing the battle. The
government is considering only whether to approve
reimbursements for PET scans in certain limited applications
-- some involving the heart and others involving the brain.</p>
<p>The proposal before the government's Health Care Financing
Administration has been sent to a physicians' panel that
evaluates new health technology. It will then go to the
Public Health Service's Office of Health Technology
Assessment. Final approval isn't likely until next year, at
the earliest.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the supporters of wider use for PET remain
optimistic. "The medical establishment aside, we believe
there is tremendous demand out there for this sort of test,"
says Dr. Gould of the University of Texas. "It's there among
highstress executives who want to know if they are at risk,
it's {there among} people who have had heart problems treated
and want to know how they are progressing, it's {there among}
the population at large. There's tremendous fear and concern
among people about their hearts. New technologies like the
PET test can either give you peace of mind because you find
out you don't have the disease, or tell you for sure that
you've got a problem and you need to take steps to reverse
the problem. Either way, you win."</p>
