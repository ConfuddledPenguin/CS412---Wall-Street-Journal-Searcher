	<p class="article-leader">THE MESSAGE, BROADCAST on everything from cornflakes boxes
to the evening news, comes across loud and clear: Heart
disease is a killer.
   In response, Americans have leaped onto exercise
treadmills, gobbled more oat-bran muffins and enrolled in
seminars on the benefits of yoga in stress reduction. Much of
this has been positive: Preventive habits are one reason
heart-attack deaths are declining across the nation.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But some doctors are concerned that the heart-warning
barrage has produced another, more insidious reaction: fear.</p>
<p>While riding on a Washington subway several years ago,
Shari Young suddenly became aware that her heart was racing.
Her breathing also didn't seem right, the 29-year-old
housewife recalls. Having read about the symptoms of heart
disease, Ms. Young quickly concluded: "I'm having a heart
attack."</p>
<p>For four years -- despite reassurances from many doctors
-- Ms. Young was convinced there was something wrong with her
heart. The frightening episodes continued. Finally, she was
diagnosed as having panic syndrome, a disorder that can lead
to spontaneous bursts of both psychological and physiological
symptoms that mimic heart attacks.</p>
<p>We are, it appears, fast becoming a nation of
heartattackphobes, so paranoid that we panic at the slightest
twinge that takes place anywhere even close to the chest.
Many doctors can tell stories of patients who, after they
feel a heart palpitation, a tightness in their chest, or an
unusual shortness of breath, become falsely alarmed and race
off to the emergency room. Some of the patients who show up
in emergency rooms complaining of heart-attack symptoms or
visit their doctors' offices seeking reassurance are
anxiously overreacting to something they've seen or heard
about heart attacks, physicians say.</p>
<p>"There's been enough in print now that the general public
is aware of chest-pain syndrome," says C. Richard Conti, a
University of Florida professor and immediate past president
of the American College of Cardiology. "One of the problems
with promoting chest-pain awareness is that people interpret
pains as heart attacks that aren't. It's a two-edged sword.
We don't want to have people needlessly rushing to the
emergency room, but we don't want to have them ignoring
danger, either."</p>
<p>Some doctors, in fact, flatly advise patients never to
take their pulse. "If you're not a trained physician, it's
easy to become alarmed about slight changes in the rhythm of
the heart," says Isadore Rosenfeld, a professor at Cornell
University Medical College.</p>
<p>But even cardiologists aren't immune to fears about the
heart. A recent Wall Street Journal survey of 400
cardiologists found that 25% said their day-to-day life
styles are affected by a fear of having a heart attack.</p>
<p>After nationwide television viewers watched footage of
Loyola Marymount University basketball player Hank Gathers as
he suffered a fatal heart attack during a game, one Chicago
cardiologist said a number of young patients anxiously
telephoned his office.</p>
<p>"It triggered a flurry of additional concern" from
patients who have been diagnosed as having abnormal heart
rhythms but whose conditions "certainly aren't as disabling"
as that of Hank Gathers, says Richard Kehoe, a cardiologist
at the Illinois Masonic Medical Center. "They were on the
anxious side. They'd say, `Hey, Doc. This isn't going to
happen to me, is it?'"</p>
<p>At Multiplex, a 5,000-member health club in Deerfield,
Ill., physical trainers say they are showered with questions
based on the health and fitness issues of the day. "When the
hot buttons are pushed by the media, we get a tremendous
response," says Dawn Norman, general manager of the club.
People come in and say I read an article and . . ."</p>
<p>The problem may be exacerbated by the often confusing
messages people receive. One day, the news trumpets the value
of oat bran. Then, studies appear suggesting that oat bran is
of limited value. At one moment, an aspirin or two a day is
touted as an effective deterrent, but as soon as the medicine
cabinet is adequately stocked with a long-term supply,
research finds that daily aspirin could cause other
significant health problems.</p>
<p>"It's a true problem," says David B. Carmichael, medical
director of the Cardiovascular Institute at Scripps Memorial
Hospital in La Jolla, Calif. "The information process is so
superlative now that the information gets into people's hands
before we in the medical field have a chance to decipher it.
A lot of people go through agony worrying about things that
add up in the mind as something being wrong with the heart."</p>
<p>All of which has left health-conscious Americans
frustrated and bewildered, trying to appropriately respond to
everything they hear. One result, says John Roglieri of
Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York, is that
some people sacrifice "the quality of their lives and
needlessly give up some of the nice, basic enjoyments in
life."</p>
