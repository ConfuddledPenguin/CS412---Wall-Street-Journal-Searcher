	<p class="article-leader">Viacom Inc. posted strong first-quarter sales growth and a
net loss that was much narrower than the operating loss in
the year-ago period, when net income was boosted sharply by
one-time gains on sales of cable systems.
   Viacom's operating earnings more than doubled in its
cable-networks division, which includes MTV. Double-digit
revenue and earnings increases were posted in each of the
company's three other divisions: local cable systems; TV and
radio stations; and program production and syndication.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company posted a first-quarter loss of $17.1 million,
or 32 cents a share, on 15% growth in revenue, to $393.2
million. The year-ago period had revenue of $341.1 million,
an operating loss of $80.8 million and net income of $199.1
million, or $3.73 a share, thanks to a pretax profit boost of
$304.8 million from the sale of cable systems in Cleveland
and Long Island.</p>
<p>Viacom also expanded its bank lines of credit in the
quarter by $200 million, to $1.7 billion, to add flexibility
in managing its debt load and in making small acquisitions,
said George S. Smith Jr., chief financial officer.</p>
<p>The firm's cash flow improved considerably. In the most
recent period Viacom generated cash flow of $99 million to
cover interest payments of $70.8 million, some of which was
"in kind" rather than in actual cash. That compares with
year-earlier cash flow of $86 million to cover $96.1 million
in interest.</p>
