	<p class="article-leader">It's the Fountain Fights, Round II.
   Amid major defections of fast-food chains from PepsiCo
Inc.'s fountain business, Pepsi is launching an advertising
assault on rival Coca-Cola Co.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The new campaign aims to turn the tables on Coke's central
argument that fast-food chains shouldn't sell Pepsi from
their fountain spigots because that effectively supports a
competitor. Pepsi -- owner of Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and
Kentucky Fried Chicken -- is also the nation's largest
restaurant operator. As one recent Coke ad puts it: "If a
PepsiCo restaurant is your competition, every time you serve
Pepsi, you're pouring money into your competitor's pocket."</p>
<p>Pepsi's new ad, which is being run in a major restaurant
trade magazine, suggests that Coke itself is hardly without
vested interests in restaurants. Calling Coke "Mc"Coke, the
ad points out that McDonald's is Coke's biggest customer.
Addressing restaurant operators, the ad says, "Your biggest
competitor . . . is McDonald's," and Coke is McDonald's "No.
1 ally in the effort to win customers from you."</p>
<p>Of Coke, the Pepsi ad says, "We doubt they'll help you
succeed at McDonald's expense." The final zinger: "To Coke,
if you're not McDonald's, your business may mean McNothing."</p>
<p>Responds Coke: "Pepsi is trying to do anything it can to
overcome the harsh reality that no business has ever been
successful for long by competing with its own customers."</p>
<p>The ad campaign follows Coke's virtual gutting of Pepsi's
major fountain customers. In the past two weeks, Coke has
swiped Pepsi's biggest fountain client, Grand Metropolitan
PLC's Burger King Corp. unit, and has won major accounts from
TW Services Inc., a food-service company that is the largest
franchisee of Hardee's Food Systems Inc., a unit of Imasco
Ltd. Earlier this year, Wendy's International Inc. announced
it would put Coke instead of Pepsi in its company-owned
restaurants starting in 1991.</p>
<p>"Pepsi's fountain thrust has been blunted," says Emanuel
Goldman, a PaineWebber Inc. analyst.</p>
<p>The fountain war is generally more important for volume
and visibility than for profitability. On major accounts, the
two rivals compete so fiercely for contracts that their
profit margins are typically less generous than usual,
beverage analysts say. But when a customer scans the order
boards at a McDonald's, or the No. 1 fast-food chain runs
joint advertising promotions with Coke, the soft-drink
company gains invaluable exposure.</p>
<p>The loss of visibility will hurt Pepsi's efforts to narrow
Coke's fountain lead. Starting out in the soda-fountain
business more than a century ago, Coca-Cola has enjoyed
strong dominance in that area ever since. Coke currently
controls about 60% of the fountain business -- more than
double Pepsi's share. But during the 1980s, Pepsi had started
to make significant inroads into the fountain market,
particularly by winning the Burger King contract.</p>
<p>As those gains now unravel, some beverage analysts are
skeptical about the appeal of Pepsi's new campaign. "I think
the fountain business is important to Coke, and they will do
whatever they can to win new accounts," says Michael Bellas,
president of Beverage Marketing Corp. "I think they'll be
competitive right down the line {on smaller restaurants} with
Pepsi."</p>
<p>But clearly McDonald's is also important to Coke. It
accounts for about 5% of all Coke's U.S. soft-drink volume,
and about 15% of its fountain business, according to
PaineWebber. And when McDonald's opened its first restaurant
in the Soviet Union, Donald R. Keough, Coca-Cola's president,
flew to Moscow to be on hand for the festivities.</p>
