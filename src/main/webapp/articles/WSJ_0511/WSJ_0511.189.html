	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- A former director of the defunct Metroplex
Federal Savings Association and his defense lawyer were
indicted on charges of obstructing a federal criminal
investigation into the thrift's lending activities.
   Bob R. Franks, a former director of Metroplex, already was
under indictment on charges that he illegally benefited from
a loan made by NorthPark Savings Association while he was a
director at that institution.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Franks and his lawyer in the NorthPark case, Earl
Rutledge, of Hurst, Texas, were indicted yesterday by a
federal grand jury in Dallas on charges related to two loans
made by Metroplex Savings.</p>
<p>The loans, totaling $500,000, were made to a company that
was purchasing an interest in the joint venture that owned
the Metroplex Savings building, according to the indictment.
Messrs. Franks and Rutledge, who were partners in the joint
venture, are charged with concealing Mr. Rutledge's receipt
of funds from the loan from other directors at Metroplex
Savings.</p>
<p>The indictment also charges Mr. Franks and his lawyer with
filing affidavits that falsely stated that the Metroplex
directors were aware that Mr. Franks benefited from the loan.
The affidavits were filed with three separate legal motions
in federal court in Dallas, including a motion to have the
affidavits presented to the federal grand jury considering
the Metroplex case, according to the indictment.</p>
<p>Neither Mr. Franks, 55 years old, nor Mr. Rutledge, 56,
could be reached for comment yesterday.</p>
<p>Metroplex was declared insolvent in late 1988 with $65.3
million in assets. NorthPark was declared insolvent at the
same time with $124.1 million in assets. The two thrifts were
merged with 12 others in December 1988 to become Consolidated
Federal Bank FSB.</p>
