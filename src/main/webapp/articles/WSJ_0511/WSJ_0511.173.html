	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Assets of the nation's 508 money-market funds
fell $2.22 billion, to $383.50 billion, in the week ended
Wednesday, according to the Investment Company Institute, a
trade association.
   Assets of 246 general-purpose funds fell $531.6 million,
to $132.17 billion, while assets of 102 broker-dealer funds
fell $854.3 million, to $159.84 billion. Assets of 160
institutional funds fell $831.2 million, to $91.48 billion.
Mutual-fund assets revised for the week ending May 2 fell
$2.15 billion, to $385.71 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Yields on money-market funds changed very little during
the week," said Jacob Dreyer, vice president and chief
economist at the Washington-based institute. But yields on
direct money-market instruments were "quite volatile," he
said. "These changing relationships may have prompted money
managers, as well as individuals to engage in asset
shuffling."</p>
