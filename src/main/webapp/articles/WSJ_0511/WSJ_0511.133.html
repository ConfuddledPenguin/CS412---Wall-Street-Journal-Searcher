	<p class="article-leader">Fried. Krupp G.m.b.H. says it has completed its
restructuring program and is poised to post a significant
group profit for 1990.
   "Our large structural problems have been solved," said
Gerhard Cromme, chairman of the Essen, West Germany-based
steel and engineering concern, in an interview. "We are
herewith returning to normalcy."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Krupp posted solid operating earnings last year after a
deficit in 1988, and earnings are set to climb further this
year, Mr. Cromme said.</p>
<p>"Everything is running well at the moment," and even the
slowdown in the global steel market won't create any major
problems for Krupp, the chairman said. "In the steel sector,
we are hurt just like everybody else. But one can't talk
about a significant weakening. . . . It's just a return to a
normal level."</p>
<p>Despite that positive picture, the group is likely to post
only a breakeven result for 1989 because of charges related
to previous losses and measures to strengthen the balance
sheet, Mr. Cromme said.</p>
