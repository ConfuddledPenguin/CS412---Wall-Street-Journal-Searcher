	<p class="article-leader">Hong Kong's key stock index surged 1.4% in the heaviest
trading session in three weeks after news that the Beijing
government released 200 people held for alleged involvement
in China's pro-democracy movement last year.
   Elsewhere, London shares were mostly steady to firmer,
although the key Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index was dragged modestly lower by a number of big blue-chip
decliners. Tokyo stocks ended an initially bullish day only
slightly higher, as arbitrage activity and profit-taking in
the afternoon erased earlier gains, traders said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index soared 43.15
points, the best gain in more than two months, to close at
2985.42. The broader Hong Kong Index jumped 28.82, to
1961.32. Turnover shot up to 1.46 billion Hong Kong dollars
(US$187.5 million) from Wednesday's HK$1.07 billion.</p>
<p>Properties shares outpaced the rest of the market. They
were followed by commercial and industrial issues. Utilities
issues posted substantial advances, while banking stocks made
modest increases.</p>
<p>After opening unchanged, the market was stuck in tight
range-trading in the morning. The impact of the news from
China involving the release of the dissidents took hold in
the afternoon to vault the market to close just off the
intraday high, participants said.</p>
<p>Players said overseas funds were back in force to snap up
quality blue chips, while speculative interest in various
industrial second liners also heated up.</p>
<p>"Trading momentum improved significantly, and healthy
follow-through is almost certain Friday," said Simon Chin,
research director at Citicorp Scrimgeour Vickers HK Ltd.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of pent-up buying interest lately, a
trader said, pointing to the lack of selling pressure during
the recent consolidation period as evidence.</p>
<p>Participants say the market should have no problem
piercing the key 3000 level on the blue-chip index Friday,
but they differ on whether it can stay above that point. A
trader at a major European brokerage firm said it could, and
set the next target at the 3050 level. Mr. Chin is less
certain and said it remains to be seen, as previous attempts
this year to breach that point eventually failed.</p>
<p>In London, the FT-SE 100-share index fell 5.7 points to
2157.0, its intraday low. The index hit a session high of
2169.2, up 6.5, in late morning dealings. At the close, the
FT 30-share index was down 4.8 at 1690.8. Volume was 406.3
million shares, down from 425 million shares a day earlier.</p>
<p>In the futures market, the June FT-SE 100 index was at
2194.0, up from 2190.0.</p>
<p>A spate of gloomy corporate news peppered the market --
from profit warnings to poor quarterly results. Dealers noted
that the news was reflected in the day's big FTSE 100
decliners.</p>
<p>As well, dealers said that the mixed bag of price action
on the day reflected a degree of profit-taking before the
expiration of the exchange's current two-week trading account
Friday, along with reluctance to aggressively take fresh
positions so late in the trading account.</p>
<p>Dealers added that the market has grown increasingly
cautious ahead of Friday's scheduled release of British
retail price index data, particularly given talk that it will
show Britain's inflation rate moving into double-digits for
the first time since early 1982.</p>
<p>Among the bearish corporate news that helped undermine the
market, automotive-parts maker GKN issued a grim profit
statement around midday that clipped early gains. GKN plunged
31 pence, to 366 pence ($6.14) a share, after reporting a
decline in pretax profit for the first four months of the
year as a result of sagging demand and labor strikes
affecting some of its key customers.</p>
<p>Shares took another tumble late in the session, after the
release of disappointing first-quarter results from General
Accident, Britain's largest composite insurer. General
Accident fell 14, to 1026, after reporting an #80.9 million
($135.8 million) pretax loss for the first quarter. It cited
winter-storm claims and a deterioration in the underlying
business in most of its major markets.</p>
<p>British Petroleum fell 5, to 311. Britain's largest
petroleum company said net income dropped 43% on a historic
cost basis, with depressed chemical earnings and a drop in
value of its inventory countering strong earnings growth in
exploration and production.</p>
<p>Tokyo had a bullish opening tied to buying inspired by a
stronger yen. But partly because it was expiration day for
May options, arbitragers actively liquidated their cash stock
against short futures positions in the afternoon.</p>
<p>As a result, the Nikkei index of 225 selected issues
closed 34.65 points higher at 30980.26. The index fell 24.97
points Wednesday. Volume on the first section was estimated
at 730 million shares, down from 753.5 million shares
Wednesday.</p>
<p>In trading in Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei index rose 185.68
points to 31165.94 at the end of the morning session.</p>
<p>Thursday's Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in
the first section, which gained 5.19 points Wednesday, rose
4.06 points, or 0.18%, at 2312.85.</p>
<p>The second-section index, which advanced 46.02 points
Wednesday, rose 38.25 Thursday, or 1.03%, to close at
3756.15.</p>
<p>Volume in the second section was estimated at 19 million
shares, up from 18.6 million shares Wednesday.</p>
<p>The key Nikkei index gained more than 295 points to its
intraday high in the morning, as buyers were inspired to seek
out domestic-demand related issues on the back of a stronger
yen, according to J. Graham Biggart, head of futures and
options trading at Schroder Securities (Japan) Ltd. But the
currency's strength induced some profit-taking on high-tech,
export-oriented issues, Mr. Biggart said.</p>
<p>Greg Byndy, manager of equity trading at Merrill Lynch
Japan Inc., said afternoon activity was dictated by
options-related strategies.</p>
<p>Although some futures and options traders didn't expect
much arbitrage activity Thursday afternoon, Mr. Byndy said
that most had anticipated the selling on the cash indexes, as
it usually occurs on options expiration day.</p>
<p>The buying on the strength of the yen, then, was negated
by arbitrage selling.</p>
<p>Advancing issues outnumbered declining issues 623 to 348
Thursday.</p>
<p>Profit-taking brought down prices of high-tech shares,
steels and shipbuildings, which have mostly been gaining for
the past week. Sony closed at 8440, up 20, after trading as
high as 8500. Matsushita Electric Industrial fell 40 to 2220
and Toshiba fell 10 to 1070. Nippon Steel fell 15 to 605 and
Nisshin Steel fell 12 to 913.</p>
<p>Separately, the Tokyo Stock Exchange disclosed data on
arbitrage positions for the week ended May 2. Stocks being
held against June stock-index futures totaled 424.9 million
shares, up 3.6 million from the previous week. The market
value of shares against stock-index futures was 600.17
billion yen ($3.83 billion), up 16.79 billion yen from the
week earlier.</p>
<p>In other market activity:</p>
<p>Share prices closed higher in Stockholm and Zurich; lower
in Amsterdam and Brussels; and mixed in Frankfurt, Paris and
Milan. South African gold stocks closed firmer.</p>
<p>Share prices were higher in Singapore, and were lower in
Manila, Seoul, Sydney, Taipei and Wellington.</p>

Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
