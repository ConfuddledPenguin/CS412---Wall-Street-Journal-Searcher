	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Within reason, brokerage houses in the
Journal-Zacks study of stock-picking prowess may choose the
list of stocks on which they will be judged. (Of course, they
must specify in advance.)
   Merrill Lynch, PaineWebber and Raymond James are judged by
the stocks their analysts rate "1" on a five-point scale.
Kidder Peabody is judged by stocks rated "1"or "2." A.G.
Edwards is judged by stocks analysts say to "buy" or
"accumulate."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Starting at the end of January, Prudential-Bache began
publishing a weekly list giving each analyst's "single best
idea." It's judged on that, with sell ideas excluded. (For
January it was judged on stocks rated "1" for either short or
long term, and no lower than "2" for any term.)</p>
<p>At four firms -- Dean Witter, Goldman Sachs, Shearson and
Smith Barney, a stock-selection committee reviews analysts'
recommendations and picks a select group of stocks as the
firm's official recommended list. Those firms are judged on
the committee's list.</p>
<p>The study assumes that an investor buys the recommended
stocks, and sells all others, even if they're designated as
holds or weak buys. Equal dollar amounts are put into each
stock, and portfolios are adjusted monthly to keep the
amounts equal. All buying and selling is on the last trading
day of each month. Commissions and taxes are disregarded,
mostly to make the results comparable to market indexes.
Dividends are included.</p>
<p>Brokerage houses are given a chance to check the data for
accuracy. All 10 firms did so this quarter.</p>
