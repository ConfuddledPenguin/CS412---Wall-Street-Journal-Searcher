	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Despite a late pullback, the stock market
built on its recent advance amid the busiest trading in
nearly three weeks.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average went up 5.63 to 2738.51
as solid gains among several blue-chip issues more than
offset a second day of selling in Westinghouse Electric,
which fell in the wake of negative comments from analysts.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Among broader measures, Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index
gained 0.96 to 343.82, the New York Stock Exchange Composite
Index rose 0.65 to 188.14 and the Dow Jones Equity Market
Index rose 1.28 to 319.96. Advancing issues outpaced
decliners by 847 to 601 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Big Board activity has been on the upswing all week, and
the latest session continued that trend. About 158,460,000
shares were traded, the highest total since April 20; on
Wednesday, volume totaled 152.2 million shares.</p>
<p>Traders said the amount of business from institutional
investors picked up from recent levels, with the technology
and drug sectors drawing considerable buying interest.</p>
<p>Since April 27, when the industrial average retreated to
its recent low of 2645.05, the average has climbed a total of
93.46 points, or 3.5%. Aside from Wednesday's decline of 0.68
points, the 30-stock index hasn't shown a loss over that
period.</p>
<p>"As we move up, people want to jump on the bandwagon
before the bandwagon moves out of the station," said Edward
J. Shopkorn, director of institutional equities at Mabon,
Nugent. "There appears to be some genuine interest on the buy
side."</p>
<p>But prices slipped from session highs along with bonds in
late trading after the release of results from the Treasury's
sale of $10 billion in 30-year bonds, which concluded the
quarterly refunding. The average yield of 8.84% on the long
bond was in line with expectations.</p>
<p>Nervousness about the April producer price report, to be
issued before today's opening, also was cited as a factor in
the market's late retreat. The data are expected to show that
the index went up 0.2%, according to a consensus of
economists surveyed by Dow Jones; the "core" inflation rate,
or prices excluding food and energy, is expected to be up
0.3%.</p>
<p>Market players will be looking to the April figures for
evidence that inflationary pressures aren't accelerating, as
several pieces of data issued during the first quarter had
suggested otherwise.</p>
<p>Among technology issues, International Business Machines
advanced 1 1/8 to 112 3/8, Hewlett-Packard rose 1 3/8 to 46
1/4, Compaq Computer added 7/8 to 107 and Texas Instruments
went up 1 1/4 to 36 7/8. Motorola added 2 to 74 5/8; Merrill
Lynch raised its short-term investment rating on the stock
and boosted its estimates of 1990 and 1991 earnings, citing
continued strength in the company's cellular telephone
business.</p>
<p>SmithKline Beecham jumped 2 to 39 3/4 on Big Board
composite volume of 1.8 million shares and Bristol-Myers
Squibb gained 7/8 to 59 3/8 on 1.7 million shares. Smith
Barney, Harris Upham repeated its buy recommendations on the
two drug stocks; analyst Christina Heuer said earnings at
SmithKline should be 50% to 60% higher than year-earlier
levels by the second half and both companies should have
"significant cost-saving benefits" from the mergers they
completed last year.</p>
<p>Merck, another drug issue, contributed to the rise in the
Dow industrials by gaining 7/8 to 75 5/8. Other issues in the
30-stock average to attract buyers included Eastman Kodak,
which went up 1 to 39 1/8 as 2.1 million shares changed
hands; American Telephone & Telegraph, up 3/4 to 41 1/4;
Exxon, up 1/2 to 46 5/8, and Boeing, up 1 5/8 to 75 3/8.</p>
<p>But Westinghouse, which dropped 1 1/2 Wednesday after the
company's appearance at an investment conference in Palm
Beach, Fla., lost another 2 to 72.</p>
<p>Analysts with at least two firms, Dean Witter Reynolds and
UBS Securities, lowered investment ratings on the stock
following the presentation. UBS analyst Robert McCoy said his
decision to downgrade Westinghouse reflected his belief that
earnings growth and return on equity are likely to slow down
over the next three years.</p>
<p>General Electric rose 1/2 to 67 1/4 on 2.6 million shares
after Salomon Brothers repeated its recommendation on the
stock, which carries the firm's highest investment rating.
Analyst Russell L. Leavitt said earnings at GE should show
"improvement in the double digits" this year and could
surpass his current estimate of $4.90 to $5 a share.</p>
<p>Prime Motor Inns climbed 1 to 10 as 1.6 million shares
were traded. Shearson Lehman Hutton increased its short-term
and long-term investment ratings on the stock.</p>
<p>Georgia Gulf rose 5/8 to 7 on two million shares. Goldman
Sachs resumed coverage of the stock with a buy
recommendation, citing its view that the shares are
undervalued; the firm hadn't carried a rating on Georgia Gulf
while it served as financial adviser for its
recapitalization.</p>
<p>Harcourt Brace Jovanovich dropped 1/4 to 3 1/2 after
breaking off talks about possible sales of some assets and
public debt.</p>
<p>Thomson of Canada was the potential buyer, according to
Eugene McCarthy, a Harcourt director; however, the company
never identified the other party.</p>
<p>ITT rose 2 to 54 3/4 after indicating to analysts that it
is willing to discuss the sale of all or part of its 37%
interest in Alcatel with Compagnie Generale d'Electricite,
which owns the other 63%.</p>
<p>Dividend-related trading swelled volume in two issues:
Kemper, which went up 3/8 to 35 1/2 and ranked as the most
active Big Board stock on 3.4 million shares, and
Southwestern Public Service, which rose 1/8 to 28 1/8 on 1.8
million shares.</p>
<p>Shaw Industries, which plummeted 2 7/8 Wednesday, fell
another 1 1/2 to 28 3/4 on 1.4 million shares. The sell-off
came after Merrill Lynch and Wheat First Butcher & Singer
lowered their forecasts of the company's earnings for its
fiscal fourth quarter, ending in June.</p>
<p>Columbia Gas System lost 2 to 45 5/8.</p>
<p>Coastal, rumored as a potential suitor for the company,
said it doesn't own any Columbia Gas shares and isn't
interested in a takeover.</p>
<p>Wal-Mart Stores, which reported that its first-quarter net
income rose about 28% from the 1989 level, added 5/8 to 52.
Its earnings per share for the latest period, 45 cents,
exceeded most analysts' forecasts.</p>
<p>Other retailing stocks rallied in the wake of strong April
sales reports. Gap, whose sales jumped 31% overall and 25%
for stores open at least one year, surged 3 7/8 to 67 3/8;
meanwhile, Limited gained 1 to 42 3/8 and Jamesway rose 1/2
to 5.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 0.39
to 348.92. Volume totaled 13,400,000 shares.</p>
<p>K-V Pharmaceutical climbed 2 1/4 to 13. The company agreed
to give Burroughs Wellcome's Canadian unit the right to
market two products using its timed-release systems; terms
weren't disclosed.</p>
<p>Hershey Oil rose 1/2 to 5 3/8. American Exploration agreed
to pay $7 a share for as much as 20% of the company's common
stock and acquire the rest through an exchange of stock.
American Exploration finished unchanged at 3 5/8.</p>
<p>Telesphere Communications rose 3/4 to 5 5/8, a 52-week
high. Henry S. Daniel, an analyst at Josephthal & Co., said
the company stands to report better earnings if its proposed
acquisition of National Telephone Services is completed.</p>
