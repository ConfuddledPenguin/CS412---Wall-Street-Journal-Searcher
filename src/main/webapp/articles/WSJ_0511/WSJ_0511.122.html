	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- White House double talk on taxes is creating
disarray among Republicans and undercutting the
administration's strategy for winning a deficit-reduction
pact.
   Over the past two days, White House officials have sent
out a barrage of contradictory signals on the
administration's position. At a meeting with congressional
leaders on Sunday, President Bush signaled that he was ready
to consider a budget package that would include tax
increases. Then yesterday, a senior White House official,
later identified as Chief of Staff John Sununu, was quoted in
several newspapers suggesting the White House might veto any
tax increases proposed by the Democrats. Later, White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater countered Mr. Sununu's comments,
calling any veto threat "crazy." He said President Bush had
specifically directed him to emphasize again there are "no
preconditions" for the budget talks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Adding further to the confusion, Vice President Dan Quayle
told CNN yesterday evening: "The American people know this
president doesn't want to raise taxes, period."</p>
<p>Democratic leaders were angered by Mr. Sununu's comments,
but said they had received reassurances from the White House
and would proceed with the budget talks as planned. "We view
this incident as an extremely serious one because it could,
if repeated, threaten the success of the talks and we want
them to succeed," Speaker Thomas Foley of Washington said.</p>
<p>For their part, White House officials are privately
blaming loose-lipped Republican congressional leaders for
spoiling their deficit-cutting strategy. Senate GOP Leader
Robert Dole of Kansas and House Republican Leader Robert
Michel of Illinois emerged from a meeting with Mr. Bush on
Sunday and said the president was ready to talk taxes. Two
days later, Senate Republican Whip Alan Simpson of Wyoming
suggested the president was considering raising alcohol and
tobacco taxes or even instituting a national sales tax.</p>
<p>The comments irritated the White House. President Bush's
advisers are well aware that their plans to cut $50 billion
or more from next year's deficit will likely involve a tax
increase of as much as $25 billion. But they had hoped to let
Democrats and the media take the lead in discussing taxes,
while the White House and Republicans hid behind the vague
phrase: "no preconditions." The comments by Republican
leaders left that strategy in ruins.</p>
<p>The result of all the GOP tax talk has been an outraged
reaction from the conservative wing of the party. Nineteen
Republican senators wrote Mr. Bush declaring they
"unequivocally oppose new taxes." And at a jammed news
conference yesterday, such tax foes as former White House
Budget Director James Miller and supply-side economist
Richard Rahn of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce joined a slew of
Republican lawmakers calling on Mr. Bush to resist taxes. "I
have a message for the president," said Sen. William Roth
(R., Del.). "`Read my lips. Keep the campaign pledge.'"</p>
<p>The latest equivocations by the White House have made wary
Democrats even more skeptical about the president's
intentions. "This is not a good-faith effort," said House
Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta (D., Calif.). "You've
got a tough enough problem . . . without all of this
political guerrilla warfare.</p>
<p>In short, the budget talks are off to a very bumpy start.</p>
<p>The talks could still lead to a major deficit-reduction
agreement this year. But the White House faces the extremely
difficult balancing act of keeping the conservative rank and
file of the GOP under control and at the same time convincing
Democrats that it is seriously interested in negotiating a
deal. The task seems to be creating some tension between
Chief of Staff Sununu, who is ministering to the Republican
right, and Budget Director Richard Darman, who must convince
Democrats that the White House is negotiating in good faith.</p>
<p>Even before the latest problems, the budget discussions
were fraught with ill will left over from last year's budget
talks. Democrats feel the White House engaged them in
deficit-cutting negotiations but then turned around and
pushed a cut in the capital-gains tax instead. Administration
officials recognized the leftover animosity, and had hoped to
establish an atmosphere of trust and cooperation by holding
last Sunday's talks in the privacy of the White House family
quarters. But word of the meeting got out, prompting media
scrutiny.</p>
<p>President Bush called Speaker Foley yesterday morning on
another matter, and the speaker raised his concerns about Mr.
Sununu's comments, aides said. Mr. Foley wouldn't discuss the
conversation in detail, but said he came away reassured. "As
far as I understand," he said, "the president is reiterating
the previous statements that there are no preconditions."
Sen. Mitchell had an aide call White House lobbyist Fred
McClure to complain. In a joint statement read by Sen.
Mitchell, Democratic negotiators called Mr. Sununu's comments
"untrue, unfair and ill-timed."</p>
<p>Other Democrats weren't so easily placated. Rep. Marty
Russo (D., Ill.) said he had been resigned to a bipartisan
budget summit, but now is having second thoughts. "The
comments in the press have changed the ground rules," he
said. "They give you reason to pause. Who speaks for the
president of the United States?" Mr. Russo says congressional
leaders shouldn't begin bargaining unless Mr. Bush goes on
television or Budget Director Darman testifies before
Congress on why the deficit is now so much more of a crisis
and what the administration proposes to do about it.</p>
<p>Added Rep. Samuel Gejdensen (D., Conn.): "We hear whispers
from Darman. We hear whispers from Sununu. This guy {Mr.
Bush} wants to be president except when it comes to making a
decision."</p>
<p>Some Republicans in Congress were obviously embarrassed by
the disarray at the White House. Minority Leader Michel said,
"The decision has got to be made whether you go into one of
these things in good faith, and being candid and open and
honest with one another or I don't know that you have any
prospects for success."</p>
<p>And even House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia,
an arch-foe of tax increase, toned down his criticism of
Democrats for trying to push the president toward tax
increases. "We are a long way from getting an agreement we
have to worry about," he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) of the
House Ways and Means Committee disparaged lawmakers who say
that a tax increase isn't needed. And he found it
"encouraging" that the president had invited congressional
leaders to the White House, regardless of what senior aides
say.</p>
