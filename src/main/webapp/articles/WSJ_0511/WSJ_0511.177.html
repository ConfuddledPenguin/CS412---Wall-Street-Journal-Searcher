	<p class="article-leader">The board of Hilton Hotels Corp., regrouping from its
failed efforts to auction the Beverly Hills, Calif.-based
hotel and casino company's assets, boosted the company's
quarterly common stock dividend 20% to 30 cents a share from
25 cents. The dividend is payable June 15 to shareholders of
record June 1.
   Barron Hilton, chairman and chief executive, said in an
interview before the annual shareholders' meeting that the
company is assessing the casino market in Atlantic City, N.J.
Recent Wall Street rumors have suggested that Hilton is
interested in buying Trump's Castle from New York investor
Donald Trump. Mr. Hilton said the company isn't in
negotiations with anyone, but said the company would consider
the Castle and other properties as well.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Hilton built the Castle in 1984, but the company suffered
a stunning reversal when its licensing application was
rejected by state casino officials. Hilton sold the Castle to
Mr. Trump in 1985, who opened the property that June. Hilton
and Mr. Trump filed suit against one another over the closing
of the sale, but the claims later were dismissed.</p>
<p>Hilton's stock closed at $48.125, down 62.5 cents in
composite New York Stock Exchange trading.</p>
