	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- CAE Industries Ltd. said lower earnings from
the company's U.S. operations and accounting changes resulted
in a 94% drop in net income for the year ended March 31.
   CAE, a dominant player in the military and commercial
simulation markets, reported net income of 2.7 million
Canadian dollars (US$2.3 million) or three cents (Cdn) a
share, in the 1990 fiscal year, down from C$42.8 million, or
55 cents (Cdn) a share, the previous year. Revenue rose 33%
to C$1.12 billion from C$838.8 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>CAE attributed the decline to changes in accounting
practices, which increased the company's income taxes and the
amount of a write-down on two unprofitable contracts at its
U.S. operations, CAELink. Income taxes payable in fiscal 1990
rose to C$19.1 million from C$11.7 million in 1989. The
write-down, originally estimated at C$10.5 million, now
amounts to C$17.5 million.</p>
<p>Interest expenses also rose by C$15 million to C$42.9
million.</p>
<p>CAE said that without the accounting changes, the company
would have reported net of about 30 cents (Cdn) a share.</p>
<p>CAE acquired Singer Co.'s Link Flight Simulation Division
in 1988 for $550 million. The company has embarked on a
restructuring program which CAE's senior vice president of
finance, John Caldwell, said will improve the unit's
profitability in a few years' time.</p>
<p>David Race, the company's president and chief executive
officer, said he expects to see "modest growth" in revenue
and profitability in its fiscal 1991 year. He declined to
give a specific estimate.</p>
<p>"Based on the . . . progress we expect to make this year,
I am optimistic that fiscal 1992 should show a return to
improved growth in revenue and earnings," Mr. Race said.</p>
