   There's No Mystery
   To Failure Statistics</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">Your March 19 OTC focus on Newbridge Networks provided
some bogus information.
   On failure rates, for example, I would like to point out
that failure statistics are absolute numbers. If I purchase
100 widgets and 10 fail, that yields an absolute failure rate
of 10%. One can then say that provided I buy similar
equipment, I can project failures of approximately 10% plus
or minus about 3%. In a projection, the failures haven't
happened yet, but in the historical analysis, the figures are
absolute, and no amount of wishful thinking can change them.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It is therefore impossible to have a failure rate of
between 20% and 50%, as quoted in your article by a former
Newbridge customer (who happens to be affiliated with a
Newbridge competitor). Let me tell you that Newbridge's
historical failure rates are below 2%. To be exact, 1.97%.</p>
<p>There is no mystery here. My company, Novatel, buys more
Newbridge 3624 Channel Banks than any other company in the
U.S. We don't hide them away in a closet, we install them. We
install the majority on MCI spans. We also sell and install
Telco Systems and Rockwell Channel Banks. I'm happy to say we
have very satisfied customers. The facts are therefore
absolute, can't be adjusted, can't be ignored. Newbridge
makes very high-quality, feature-packed, cost-effective
Channel Banks and TI Multiplexers.</p>
