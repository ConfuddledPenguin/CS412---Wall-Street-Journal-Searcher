	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Quotron Systems Inc. said it plans to launch a
global foreign-exchange dealing system, which would compete
directly with similar systems offered by Reuters Holdings PLC
and Telerate Inc.
   Quotron, a unit of Citicorp, said its F/X Trader system,
which will be available later this year, is faster and easier
to use than other systems. It can, for instance, manage up to
six simultaneous foreign-currency trades on one screen.
Systems owned by Reuters and Telerate, a unit of Dow Jones &
Co., can handle four transactions simultaneously, the
companies said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Quotron noted it has planned for years to expand into
other financial-information services -- such as supplying
data on foreign currencies and fixed-income instruments.</p>
<p>But it isn't certain whether the market is big enough for
all three to prosper, even in a growing business where
foreign-currency trading volume in 1989 averaged $640 billion
a day. Reuters said it already handles 40% of that volume
through the 11,600 terminals it has installed world-wide
since introducing its Reuters Monitor Dealing Service in
1981.</p>
<p>"Someone will succeed as an alternative provider," said
Reuters spokesman Bob Crooke. "The question is: Who?"</p>
<p>Added Kenneth A. Hines, head of the Quotron F/X Trader
project: "The conventional wisdom is there's definitely room
for two. I can't comment on whether there's room for three."</p>
<p>The stakes are high. Reuters said it spent #59.7 million
(US$100.3 million) last year on research and development,
much of which was devoted to upgrading its foreign-currency
trading service. Dow Jones has said that developing
Telerate's system and bringing it to market a year ago
accounted for $51.1 million in losses in 1989.</p>
<p>Mr. Hines said Quotron has invested "nowhere near that
figure" in its service.</p>
