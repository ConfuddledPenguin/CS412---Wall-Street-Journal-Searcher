	<p class="article-leader">McDonnell Douglas Corp., St. Louis, still stinging from an
$84 million first-quarter operating loss at its transport
aircraft factory in Long Beach, Calif., said it will lay off
4,000 people in Long Beach, 1,000 more than it had announced
late last month.
   The overall cost-cutting effort will largely affect
white-collar workers. Lawrence Harris, aerospace analyst at
Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards Inc., noted that the company
would have made a profit on its MD-80 commercial jetliner
program in the first quarter if it weren't for all its
general and administrative expenses.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>There have been a rash of layoffs announced across the
aerospace industry of late, mostly attributable to the
declining U.S. military budget.</p>
<p>General Electric Co.'s aerospace arm announced 4,200 job
cuts a couple of weeks ago. And Lockheed Corp., which
revealed earlier this week that it was pulling its aircraft
operations out of Burbank, Calif., plans to let go at least
2,750 workers by June. In addition, Boeing Co., General
Dynamics Corp., Northrop Corp. and General Motors Corp.'s
Hughes Aircraft unit all have talked during the past year
about slashing their employment rolls.</p>
