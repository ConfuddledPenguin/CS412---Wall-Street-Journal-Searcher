	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Goldman, Sachs & Co. was hit with another
lawsuit centering on the investment banking firm's commodity
operations.
   Goldman was sued for $9 million by its former
commodity-research group, which is now an independent company
called CPM Group. In a complaint filed in New York state
Supreme Court in Manhattan, CPM claims that Goldman destroyed
a major data base on gold, silver and platinum trends that
CPM and Goldman had shared, in what the suit alleges was a
"conspiracy and scheme" to hurt Goldman competitors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The CPM suit is the second to be filed recently that
focuses on Goldman's large commodity operations. In December,
the former head of Goldman Sachs's oil-futures unit, Leo
Haviland, alleged in a suit in federal court in Manhattan
that he was forced out of his $600,000-a-year job after he
refused Goldman partners' "repeated attempts to extort" him
into divulging confidential information. The suit claimed the
information was about customer accounts, so that the partners
could benefit through Goldman's J. Aron commodity-trading
division.</p>
<p>Although unrelated, both the Haviland suit and the new one
accuse Goldman of misusing its power to gain advantage in the
markets.</p>
<p>Goldman has vigorously denied the allegations in the
Haviland suit. And in an answer to the CPM suit filed in
state court, Goldman denies CPM's allegations and asks that
the suit be dismissed. A Goldman spokesman said: "This is a
minor contractual dispute over access to our own library
materials, which in any event the former consultant had no
right to following the termination of the contract in
November 1989."</p>
<p>CPM, run by former Goldman Vice President Jeffrey M.
Christian, is a consultant and research firm based in New
York. Originally an arm of Goldman, the firm went independent
in 1986, and its clients included, until last year, Goldman
itself. Early this month, the Silver Institute, a trade
group, announced it hired CPM to produce statistical reviews
of the international silver market. CPM also advises mining
companies.</p>
<p>The CPM suit alleges that Goldman and Goldman partner
Dennis Suskind reneged on an agreement to maintain the big
precious-metal data base, including research files,
periodicals and books. CPM said Goldman was obligated to
maintain the data base and allow CPM to use it, even if CPM's
consulting agreement with Goldman ran out. But the suit
claims the data base was "thrown out and destroyed" without
notice.</p>
<p>Mr. Suskind declined to comment on the CPM suit beyond the
spokesman's statement.</p>
<p>CPM is seeking $4 million in damages, mostly for lost
business, and $5 million in punitive damages.</p>
