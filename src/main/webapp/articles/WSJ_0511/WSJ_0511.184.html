	<p class="article-leader">EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- Aura Systems Inc. expects to report
that its loss for the fourth quarter ended Feb. 28 narrowed
to between $250,000 and $300,000 from a loss of $552,000 a
year earlier, President Harry Kurtzman said.
   He said fourth-quarter revenue went to about $2 million
from $1 million a year ago.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the full year, Mr. Kurtzman said, the loss widened to
about $2 million, or 10 cents a share, from last year's loss
of $1.5 million, or seven cents a share, on a surge in
revenue to more than $9 million from $2.8 million a year ago.</p>
<p>Mr. Kurtzman stressed that the revenue nearly all came
from research-and-development contracts, "almost equivalent
to investments," he said. "When most people talk about
revenue, they talk about selling something," he added. He
said the company would be manufacturing and delivering
products before the end of fiscal 1991, and said he expects
Aura to be profitable for the year.</p>
<p>Chief Financial Officer Frank Phalen said the company had
received a contract from General Dynamics Corp. to develop
magnetic devices for an advanced reconnaissance system that
contains a commitment of about $1 million but could generate
revenue of more than $50 million over the next 10 years if
the devices later go into production.</p>
<p>Mr. Kurtzman, in an interview, said he expects revenue to
double in the coming fiscal year, though he said two-thirds
of it would still be the research-and-development area. The
company was founded in 1987.</p>
<p>Mr. Kurtzman also outlined progress in the electro-optical
and electromagnetic segments of Aura's business. The company
holds two patents on a technology it developed to "isolate"
equipment in an electromagnetic field, which eliminates
vibration. The process can be used to prevent "jitters" in
cameras on aircraft, and Mr. Kurtzman said the process also
has applications for vehicle shock absorbers, and stereo
speakers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, government research interest continues, Mr.
Kurtzman said. He said Aura is waiting for final governmental
approval of a $1.2 million contract with the U.S. Air Force
to use the high-resolution display system to test infrared
military sensors used in intelligence-gathering.</p>
<p>Mr. Kurtzman said there are potential applications in the
entertainment business as well. The company's electro-optical
unit has five patents pending on a high definition television
system, and he said the company would announce a partnership
with an entertainment company soon.</p>
<p>Aura has built a prototype for a projection system that
potentially could show films transmitted to movie theaters by
satellite or cable through a television signal, removing the
need for shipping numerous (and costly) film prints to
individual theaters. Aura's system purports to display this
television image on huge movie screens with film-like
resolution and brightness. Mr. Kurtzman said MCA Inc.,
Paramount Communications Inc., Sony Corp.'s Columbia
Pictures, AMC Entertainment Inc. and other companies have
expressed interest in the process.</p>
<p>In the electromagnetic area, Mr. Kurtzman said the
company's technology could have applications for elevators in
tall buildings, to cut down lateral shaking. It could also be
used to prevent vibration and blurriness in film cameras that
ride on dollies. Aura is also studying the use of the process
in stereo speakers, where electromagnetism can convey
low-frequency, or bass, notes much lower than conventional
speakers can.</p>
<p>The company also has an advanced computing and a
microelectronics division that together generated about $1
million in revenue in the past fiscal year, Mr. Kurtzman
said.</p>
