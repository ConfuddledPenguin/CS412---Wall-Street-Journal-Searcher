	<p class="article-leader">Grove Bank for Savings, Boston, said it reached an
agreement with a dissident shareholder group, under which the
bank will name two members of the group to its board.
   James B. Rosenwald III, chief executive officer of Redondo
Beach, Calif.-based Rosenwald Partners L.P., and Christopher
P. Sullivan, a lawyer, will be named directors at the June 7
annual meeting. Those new members will increase the number of
directors to 17.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Rosenwald group, which last month said it intended to
propose a resolution calling for the sale of the bank, agreed
to vote its shares in favor of management proposals and for
management nominees.</p>
<p>The group also agreed that for three years it will not
acquire any additional shares of Grove stock, with the
exception that one member of the group, Mr. Sullivan, may
acquire up to an additional 5,000 shares.</p>
<p>The agreement also provides that the company will consider
increasing its dividend and repurchasing its shares in the
public market in an effort to enhance shareholder value.</p>
