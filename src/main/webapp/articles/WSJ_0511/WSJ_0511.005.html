	<p class="article-leader">WINNEBAGO INDUSTRIES Inc., Forest City, Iowa, said it
decided not to declare a semiannual cash dividend. The
company has paid such a dividend since July 1985, the most
recent being 10 cents a share paid Jan. 8. Chairman John K.
Hanson said the decision resulted from the current downturn
in the company's motorhome market.</p>
