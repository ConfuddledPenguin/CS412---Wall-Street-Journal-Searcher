	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Rorer Group Inc. is confident its Maalox
marketing pact with Procter & Gamble Co. will pass an
antitrust review by the Justice Department.
   The companies "would not enter such an agreement unless we
had looked at it carefully and unless we were confident it
would pass that review," Ralph H. Thurman, a Rorer executive
vice president, said after a company meeting with securities
analysts. He added that responses from the Justice Department
indicate the pact will be approved.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Justice Department officials couldn't be reached for
comment.</p>
<p>P&G, a Cincinnati-based consumer-products concern, has
agreed to acquire U.S. marketing and distribution rights to
Rorer's Maalox antacid and other over-the-counter products.
P&G has its own over-the-counter line, including Pepto
Bismol.</p>
<p>The agreement would give Rorer, a pharmaceutical concern
in Fort Washington, Pa., certain cash payments, plus rights
to develop and market some P&G compounds for possible
prescription use in gastrointestinal disorders.</p>
<p>Rorer has agreed to a merge with the pharmaceutical
business of Rhone-Poulenc S.A., a chemical maker based in
Paris.</p>
