	<p class="article-leader">A Fairchild Industries Inc. unit systematically generated
fraudulent testing documents for special nuts, bolts and
other fasteners used on most U.S. commercial jetliners and
military aircraft, federal prosecutors charged.
   The charges stem from an investigation following a weekend
raid in February 1989 of Fairchild's VSI Corp. fastener plant
in California by about 20 agents of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation and the Defense Criminal Investigative Service.
Agents hauled away about 50 boxes of fasteners and documents
as part of an extensive inquiry into allegations of fraud in
the aerospace-parts industry.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The charges, brought against Fairchild's Voi-Shan testing
laboratory in Chatsworth, Calif., and two of its managers,
are contained in a complaint filed earlier this week in
federal court in Seattle by Assistant U.S. Attorney Bruce D.
Carter.</p>
<p>According to the complaint, a phantom "Inspector 11" at
the California plant was part of a 15-year scheme to falsify
test reports submitted to the government. Affidavits
supporting the complaint said the No. 11 inspector's stamp
wasn't assigned to any employee, but instead was used
routinely to indicate that parts had passed inspection, even
when tests hadn't been performed.</p>
<p>In a statement filed in court along with the indictment,
Mr. Carter said some inadequate Voi-Shan parts were found,
but investigators still don't know if there is any imminent
air-safety concern from untested or possibly defective parts
used years earlier on aircraft flying today. "No accidents
have been traced to Voi-Shan bolts," he said in the
statement.</p>
<p>Voi-Shan is the largest of Fairchild's three fastener
operations. The unit makes pins and collars, lock bolts,
rivets, nuts and other special fastener products. Some bolts
made at the plant are intended to bear loads exceeding
200,000 pounds per square inch. Customers include such major
aircraft and engine manufacturers as Boeing Co., McDonnell
Douglas Corp., Lockheed Corp., General Electric Co. and
United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt & Whitney Co. unit.</p>
<p>At Fairchild headquarters in Chantilly, Va., a spokeswoman
said she couldn't comment on the charges, because the company
is negotiating with the Justice Department to "resolve" the
civil and criminal allegations. "We believe a resolution is
imminent," she said.</p>
<p>The spokeswoman also said Fairchild is confident that the
quality of its products has never jeopardized air safety. She
indicated that Fairchild would issue an additional statement
today after a court hearing in Seattle on the matter.</p>
<p>According to the charges, the investigation of Voi-Shan
was prompted by a complaint from a whistleblower, Thomas
Runion, shortly after he left his job in the metallurgical
laboratory at the Chatsworth plant.</p>
<p>The complaint also names as defendants James E. Ryan, a
former Voi-Shan quality-assurance manager, and Aram
Marderian, a former metallurgical lab supervisor for
Voi-Shan. If convicted, each faces a maximum sentence of five
years in prison and a $250,000 fine.</p>
<p>Neither man could be reached for comment.</p>
<p>The Fairchild unit and the former employees are charged
with conspiracy to commit mail fraud, to make false
statements to the government and to cheat the U.S. According
to court documents, the object of the alleged conspiracy was
to hold down costs of inspection and testing in order to
boost the unit's profits.</p>
<p>The documents cite dozens of instances in which Voi-Shan
allegedly failed to conduct tests of strength, durability and
brittleness, and yet produced reports approved by the
fictitious inspector indicating that such tests had been
properly performed.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, court documents indicate, Voi-Shan allegedly
shipped parts that were later rejected by aircraft makers
which subjected the products to their own testing procedures.
According to an affidavit, Fairchild also shipped some parts
that had rusted in a salt-spray test.</p>
<p>Eight other defendants already have pleaded guilty in the
case, prosecutors said, and the investigation is continuing.</p>
<p>In a prepared statement, Boeing said its use of Voi-Shan
materials "has not compromised the integrity of Boeing
products."</p>
<p>Comments from other major Voi-Shan customers weren't
immediately available.</p>
