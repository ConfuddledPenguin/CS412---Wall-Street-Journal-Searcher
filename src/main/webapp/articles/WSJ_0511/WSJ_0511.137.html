	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Conwest Exploration Co., Mineral Resources
International Ltd. and Barons Oil Ltd. said their
shareholders approved the merger of the three companies.
   Under terms of the merger, Conwest, a Toronto-based oil,
gas and mining concern, will issue new Class B subordinate
voting shares to minority holders of both subsidiaries.
Conwest owns 51% of Mineral Resources, a mining concern.
Toronto-based Mineral Resources owns 85% of Barons, an oil
and gas production company based in Calgary, Alberta.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The new company will retain the name Conwest Exploration
Co. The merger is expected to take effect June 1.</p>
<p>Separately, John Lamacraft, Conwest's president and chief
executive officer, said he expects operating income this year
of 65.5 million Canadian dollars ($56.2 million) on revenue
of C$122.1 million, up from last year's operating income of
C$56.6 million and revenue of C$103.2 million. Operating
income is figured before taxes, depreciation, interest costs
and minority interest payments.</p>
<p>Mr. Lamacraft, speaking at the company's annual meeting,
said the gains will come largely from increased production of
oil and natural gas, following several recent acquisitions.</p>
<p>In yesterday's trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange,
Conwest Class B shares closed at 12.75 Canadian dollars
($10.94), up 37.5 cents. Mineral Resources shares rose 37.5
cents, to C$5.50; and Barons shares gained 15 cents, to close
at C$2.90.</p>
