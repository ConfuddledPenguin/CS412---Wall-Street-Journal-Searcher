	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Millicom Inc. Chairman J. Shelby Bryan said
that while the federal government has licensed the company to
test a new hand-held telephone in the U.S., the company
doesn't have a working version of the phone.
   On Wednesday, the Federal Communications Commission
licensed a Millicom subsidiary, PCN America Inc., to
construct and operate on an experimental basis a personal
communications network in Houston and Orlando. The news
pushed Millicom shares up $1 apiece to $20.50 in national
over-the-counter trading yesterday, after gaining $1.25 on
Wednesday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Millicom already operates a cellular-phone network in
Britain and has been licensed to build a personal network
there by 1992.</p>
<p>While the company recently distributed a photo showing the
pocket phone that customers of Millicom's personal network
would use, Mr. Bryan said that the device in the photo is
simply a plastic shell containing no electronic parts. Mr.
Bryan emphasized that the system is still in the experimental
stage. But, he said, "I fundamentally believe that PCN will
be the future communications technology."</p>
<p>Regarding the phone prototype, he said: "We have not
demonstrated it. But the technology definitely works." He
added that a personal-network lab experiment in Britain
worked fine, but he declined to identify any independent
observers of these lab tests. He did offer to provide a
company consultant who could discuss the technology at a
future date, and said that Millicom is negotiating with
several suppliers to manufacture the pocket phone, but he
declined to identify them.</p>
<p>Millicom's partners in the British personal-network system
are British Aerospace PLC, Matra S.A. of France and Pacific
Telesis Group, the San Francisco regional Bell phone company.</p>
<p>Mr. Bryan also said that published reports stating that
Millicom would build systems servicing more than 20,000
customers in each of its network tests in Orlando and Houston
were incorrect.</p>
<p>"Initially, 10 customers will get the phones," he said.
"We have to prove that we can coexist" with microwave
communications devices that also transmit in the
high-frequency bands that Millicom's personal network would
use. Referring to reports that 25,000 customers would get the
service in the Houston test, Mr. Bryan said: "That number is
an arbitrary number the FCC wanted us to put into the
filing." Extending the network to thousands of customers is
"an evolutionary process," he said.</p>
<p>Millicom's test network would use one to three
transmitters, Mr. Bryan said.</p>
<p>On paper, Millicom's plan looks workable: The military has
been using high-frequency communications for years.
Millicom's network would use thousands of radio systems --
about the size of a water cooler -- strategically placed in
city neighborhoods and office buildings to transmit and
receive calls.</p>
<p>The little-used, high-frequency radio band should allow
for much-smaller phones requiring batteries that are about
one-fifth the size of those used in portable cellular phones.</p>
<p>The personal-network phone itself would be smaller than a
wallet. To activate it, a caller would insert into the
receiver a so-called smart card containing a microprocessor
with his or her electronic identification. This smart card
would allow the caller to be reached anywhere the
personal-network equipment is located.</p>
<p>It would seem that such a pocket phone has the potential
to give cellular phones -- which are bigger and operate at
lower frequency and require more electrical power -- a run
for their money.</p>
<p>But the Swedish telecommunications-equipment company L.M.
Ericsson Telefon A.B. says it is already possible to offer
such personal-network service using tiny cellular
transmitters and receivers. Ericsson has begun testing such a
cellular system in Australia.</p>
