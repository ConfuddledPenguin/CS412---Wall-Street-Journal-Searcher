	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Some of the nation's top specialty retailers
reported strong April sales gains, but comparable-store sales
increases for the combined March and April selling periods
averaged only 5.6%.
   April sales this year were inflated by the addition of
Easter-related revenue. Last year Easter occurred in March.
Still, Gap Inc. showed sales increases of 25% for stores open
at least one year, while Limited Inc. reported
comparable-store gains of 16%. For the 13 weeks ended
Saturday, Gap's comparable-store sales rose 18%, while
Limited showed 11% gains.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Many department stores have undergone financial
restructuring, and they've become much less willing to take
chances on fashion merchandise," said Barry Bryant, analyst
at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. "The result is that
stores like Gap and Limited, which are clearly focused, are
doing well."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at K mart Corp., comparable-store sales,
including foreign, rose 6.3% for the four weeks ended May 2
and 3% for the 13 weeks ended May 2.</p>
<p>"Sales were strong in April, aided by the later date for
Easter in 1990 and by favorable weather conditions throughout
much of the East and Midwest," said K mart's chairman and
chief executive officer, Joseph E. Antonini. "Seasonal
merchandise in both hardline {appliances} and apparel
departments sold well during the April period."</p>
<p>Robert Buchanan, an analyst at Alex. Brown & Sons Inc.,
Baltimore, said the company's performance was in line with
its plan.</p>
<p>"Markdowns weren't significantly higher than last year,"
said Mr. Buchanan. "If you add March and April, however,
comparable-store sales were up about 2.5%, far behind
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which is up about 9.5% for the two
months. It's safe to say that K mart continues to lose market
share to some of its better-focused competitors."</p>
<p>Mr. Buchanan noted that K mart's expense ratio -- selling,
general and administrative expenses in relation to sales --
is 23% for its discount stores, compared with only 15% for
Wal-Mart's discount stores and 16% for the Target discount
division of Dayton Hudson Corp. "This makes it tougher for K
mart to price competitively across the board, and still earn
a high return on sales."</p>
<p>Mr. Buchanan noted that specialty retailers continue to
take market share because of superior execution. "It's
possible some of the big department stores are playing it too
safe," said Mr. Buchanan. "The Limited in particular is
enjoying strong sales. Its Express division was up 28% on a
comparable-store basis in April, and Victoria's Secret was up
41% on a comparable-store basis. Even Lane Bryant rose 18% on
a same-store basis. Overall Limited is aggressive, fully
stocked, and their visual presentation is better than the
competition."</p>
<p>Business at Dayton Hudson, which recently agreed to
acquire Marshall Field's, continued to be good.
Comparable-store sales rose 5.5% for the four weeks ended
Saturday and 6.8% for the 13 weeks ended Saturday.</p>
<p>"Given the Easter shift this year, it's meaningful to look
at the results for March and April combined," said Kenneth A.
Macke, chairman and chief executive. "Total sales for the
two-month period were up 13.5%, and comparable-store sales
were up 7%."</p>
