	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- Ford Motor Co. said incentives and other
variable marketing costs are now running about 10% of its
sales -- an extremely high rate that works out to be about
$1,000 a vehicle, or $4 billion on an annualized basis.
   The No. 2 auto maker also disclosed at its annual meeting
that it spent $1.2 billion last year on world-wide
advertising. About $644 million of that was spent in the
U.S., with television getting $255 million of the total, $109
million going to magazines and $38 million to newspapers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In other matters from the auto maker's second-shortest
annual meeting at 1 hour 58 minutes:</p>
<p>-- Ford Chairman Harold A. Poling said government economic
reforms in Brazil and labor disruptions in Europe will
continue to depress the company's earnings in the second
quarter. These two factors hurt first-quarter earnings, which
wound up at $506.2 million, or $1.10 a share. In the
year-earlier first quarter, Ford earned $1.64 billion, or
$3.44 a share.</p>
<p>Mr. Poling also said the world-wide auto industry's
capacity to build about 8.4 million vehicles this year, or
about 20% more than demand, "will most certainly squeeze
margins" for every auto company.</p>
<p>-- Ford "would not take exception" to being chosen as the
contract target in negotiations with the United Auto Workers
union this summer, Mr. Poling said in a news conference that
followed the meeting. The UAW usually picks one of the Big
Three auto makers as the target for a pattern-setting
contract that it then tries to get from the two other
companies.</p>
<p>-- Ford dealers have already taken orders for 100,000 of
the redesigned 1991-model Ford Escort and Mercury Tracer
subcompacts, Ford officials said. Dealers have taken in about
75,000 orders for the new Ford Explorer sport utility
vehicle. Ford has said it expects to sell 500,000 Escorts and
Tracers next year, the first full year the cars will be on
sale. The auto maker expects to sell 100,000 Explorers this
year and 220,000 in 1991.</p>
<p>-- Ford still plans to spend substantially more in the
next five years than the record $23 billion it spent in the
past five years, including $6.8 billion last year.</p>
