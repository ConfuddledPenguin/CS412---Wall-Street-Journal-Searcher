	<p class="article-leader">Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. moved to the head of the
class in stock picking for the first quarter. But Goldman,
Sachs & Co. widened its long-term lead in a quarterly study
designed to gauge how individual investors would do if they
followed their brokers' advice.
   Investors who bought the stocks recommended by Pru-Bache,
a unit of Prudential Insurance Co. of America, eked out an
estimated profit of 0.6% for the quarter, according to the
joint study by this newspaper and Zacks Investment Research
Inc. of Chicago.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>People who invested in Goldman's favorites roughly broke
even for the quarter, while those who bought the picks of
eight other major brokerage houses suffered minor losses (as
did the market averages). To estimate the returns of
individual investors, the study assumes that a person holds,
in equal amounts, each stock highly recommended by a
particular brokerage house.</p>
<p>The results show how a hot hand can change quickly. In 15
quarters covered by the study, seven different firms have
come out on top for at least one quarter. Pru-Bache was tops
in stock picking for the first quarter of 1987, as well as
the latest quarter, but has done poorly long-term, ranking
10th for the full 45 months.</p>
<p>Long-term, the study's champion is Goldman Sachs, with an
estimated return of 82.1% for the 45 months through March.
Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., a unit of Primerica Corp.,
captured the 12-month crown for the fifth time in a row.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown on how the stocks recommended by the 10
brokerage houses have done, and what sorts of stocks the
firms favor now. The firms are discussed in order of 12-month
performance.</p>
<p>SMITH BARNEY: With an estimated return of 30.7%, Smith
Barney trounced the competition for the latest 12 months. But
it stumbled in the first quarter, mostly by recommending
Hilton Hotels Corp., which slid 34% as takeover talk fizzled.
Smith Barney had been breathing down the neck of Goldman
Sachs for the long-term lead, but an estimated quarterly loss
of 3.3% leaves it seven percentage points behind. What now?
"We're making a big bet on the technology stocks," says
research director Alan Benasuli. "IBM and Digital Equipment .
. . were the underperformers of the 1980s, and we think
they're going to be the leaders of the 1990s." He's also keen
on such oil stocks as Mobil Corp., Oryx Energy Co. and Texaco
Inc.</p>
<p>GOLDMAN SACHS: While the overall market dropped about 3%
in the first quarter, Goldman's Focus List stocks were
essentially unchanged, helping the firm strengthen its grip
on first place in the long-term standings. Its biggest winner
lately has been Maxtor Corp., a San Jose, Calif., maker of
computer disk drives, which was up 35% for the quarter.
William Kealy, research director, says the firm is sticking
for now with a fairly heavy weight on technology and
capital-goods stocks. But he says it may go to more defensive
issues (those with low price-earnings ratios and high
dividends) if it looks like the economy will be weak in 1991.</p>
<p>SHEARSON: The stock pickers at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
have been getting more defensive. "We're in a trading-range
market," says research director Fred Fraenkel. As a result,
he says, the firm's analysts and stock-selection committee
have been actively pruning, trying to make sure "that we
don't keep things on the list that may be risky." In January,
a nasty month for stocks, the American Express Co. unit's
recommended list had the third-smallest drop (6.4%, vs. 6.3%
for Smith Barney and A.G. Edwards). For the quarter, Shearson
was No. 4, as losses in issues like Bairnco Corp. (down 45%)
and Time Warner Inc. (down 21%) canceled out gains in such
stocks as Nike Inc. (up 35%) and Amgen (up 26%).</p>
<p>DEAN WITTER: Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., a unit of Sears,
Roebuck & Co., ranked fourth for the latest 12 months, but
last for the quarter. "We got hurt with bank stocks" and
other interest-sensitive issues, observes research director
Manny Korman. Those included Citicorp. (down 19% for the
quarter), First Chicago (down 17%) and American Express (down
26%). Nevertheless, Mr. Korman thinks investors should stick
with interest-sensitive stocks. The reason: "The market can't
go . . . unless you get a break in interest rates." He also
likes food, drug and beverage stocks, on the theory that the
economy is likely to stay "sluggish" for quite a while.</p>
<p>MERRILL LYNCH: Merrill Lynch & Co. trailed the market
averages by a tad last quarter. "I guess we benefited
somewhat from an emphasis on technology," says research
director Andrew Melnick, "but we were hurt by financials,
banks and HMOs." Health maintenance organizations have given
Merrill some big gains in the past, but "they're a volatile
group," Mr. Melnick notes. "You live by the sword, you die by
the sword." Merrill clients made profits last quarter in
Landmark Graphics Corp. (up 30%) and OEA Inc. (up 29%), but
those who bought Prime Motor Inns Inc. (down 50%) and J&J
Snack Food Corp. (down 30%) aren't smiling.</p>
<p>KIDDER PEABODY: Kidder, Peabody & Co., a unit of General
Electric Co., beat the market averages with an estimated 2.2%
loss last quarter. For both 12 months and 45 months, it ranks
sixth. Stefan Abrams, chief investment strategist, likes
consumer-product "noncyclicals" -- companies whose fortunes
aren't closely tied to the ups and downs of the economy, such
as Procter & Gamble or Bristol Myers. He also favors
technology stocks -- not only computers (IBM, Digital
Equipment, Intel) but also biotechnology and
pollution-control issues. Technology stocks, he says, may be
a bit risky, but "cost cutting and product cycles are falling
into place" and will result in "much more explosive results
in the next couple of years."</p>
<p>PAINEWEBBER: Suffering more from an absence of big winners
than from any awful losers, the PaineWebber Group Inc. unit
PaineWebber Inc. slipped a notch to seventh in the 12-month
standings. The firm's list is "eclectic," says research
director James Voytko. It has some oil issues like British
Petroleum Co. and Texaco; quite a few telecommunications
stocks and drug stocks; and some "soft cyclicals" like
Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing. For the daring, Mr. Voytko
suggests a depressed advertising stock, Saatchi & Saatchi
PLC. The mixture reflects what strategist Edward M. Kerschner
calls an "Andy Warhol market" -- each stock group has its
brief moment of fame.</p>
<p>PRUDENTIAL-BACHE: A good quarter raised Pru-Bache to
eighth in the 12-month standings. Long-term it remains last,
but the four bottom firms are within about two percentage
points of each other. Last quarter it had gains exceeding 30%
in Anthem Electronics Inc., Home Depot Inc. and New England
Critical Care Inc., while suffering one big loss (First
Executive Corp., down 65%). "We still like technology stocks,
even though they have performed well in the first quarter,"
says research director Michael Culp. Among the firm's current
technology picks: Anthem, Chips & Technologies Inc., Lotus
Development Corp. and Silicon Graphics Inc.</p>
<p>A.G. EDWARDS: Like Dean Witter, A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc.
was hurt by the poor performance of interest-sensitive
stocks, as interest rates rose in the first quarter. At
Edwards, utility stocks are an important part of the list.
Research director Terry Dessent says investors shouldn't
abandon utilities and bank stocks, which he says have
"excellent total-return opportunities." They've "been beat up
pretty badly," he says. "We certainly want to buy them when
nobody wants them." He also likes selected technology stocks.</p>
<p>RAYMOND JAMES: Wham] Bam] Raymond James customers get lots
of action: The St. Petersburg, Fla., unit of Raymond James
Financial Inc. has done great picking stocks in up markets,
but badly in down ones. For example, the stocks it
recommended had the study's worst performance in January
(down 14.2%) and the best performance in February and March
(up 12.3%). That's the result of a list devoid of such staid
groups as utilities, foods and beverages (Raymond James
doesn't cover them), and heavy on small stocks and Southeast
regional firms. Research director David Henwood says he's
looking to add some bigger stocks to give the list stability;
he believes corporate earnings and interest rates will
continue to be worrisome.</p>
