	<p class="article-leader">Procter & Gamble Co. consolidated three health and beauty
care divisions into two units, in a further move to digest
and reorganize acquired companies.
   Effective July 1, Cincinnati-based P&G said its existing
beauty care; health and personal care; and Richardson-Vicks
divisions will be restructured into two, one with
responsibility for beauty care and the other for health care.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The new beauty care division will group together existing
activities in beauty care, along with the Noxell division. In
addition, certain businesses from Richardson-Vicks as well as
personal cleansing-products operations from the bar soap and
household cleaning products division will now come under
beauty care.</p>
<p>The new health care division will encompass existing
activities in health and personal care as well as remaining
businesses from Richardson-Vicks and the Norwich division.</p>
