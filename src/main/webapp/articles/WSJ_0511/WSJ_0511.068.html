	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan
suggested several options for toughening regulation of banks
and thrifts if the federal "safety net" is expanded to cover
broader powers that may be given to those institutions.
   Mr. Greenspan, in a speech to a bankers convention here,
said the safety net has "provided measurable benefits to the
U.S. economy" including "virtually {eliminating} financial
panics." But he said the recent savings-and-loan industry
bailout shows the government must find ways to limit the
costs from failures of financial institutions.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Fed chairman described the safety net as including not
only federal deposit insurance, but the Fed's lending to
banks for liquidity purposes, as well as the interbank
payments system backed by the Fed.</p>
<p>A key issue facing policy makers, Mr. Greenspan said, is
whether to expand or restrict the safety net to cover the new
powers likely to be given to banks in the next few years,
such as selling insurance and participating in broader
securities-underwriting and real estate activities.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenspan said that if the safety net is effectively
expanded to back such new activities, "we should probably
develop" new deposit-insurance policies such as pricing
premiums according to the riskiness of a bank's assets, and
more frequent examinations of banks.</p>
