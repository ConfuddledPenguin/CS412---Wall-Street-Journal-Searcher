	<p class="article-leader">On the sixth of June, some 10 days ago, a network
broadcaster noted that it was "the anniversary of D-Day, when
Allied forces invaded the continent of Europe during World
War II." This slightly jarring explanation served as a
reminder that, to a very large segment of the population, the
war is history of a long-gone era. To those who grew up in
the '30s and '40s, of course, it is nothing of the sort: To
this generation, the war is always here, always alive and
lurking just under the skin.
   But even this audience does not entirely account for a
phenomenon long evident to programmers in public television,
namely the existence of an insatiable public appetite for
World War II documentaries. Six years ago, Arts &
Entertainment Network made a similar discovery when it began
broadcasting the films and the ratings soared. Network
representative Brook Bailey Johnson describes the response as
amazing: "What's particularly amazing is their repeatability.
People watch them over and over."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The two most popular are "Victory at Sea" and "The
Twentieth Century." The Churchill documentary, "The Valiant
Years," also has done very well, along with "Between the
Wars," "Air Power," "Crusade in Europe" (airing Wednesdays,
8:30-9 p.m. EDT, along with two related shows) and "Why We
Fight," Frank Capra's classic indoctrination film, made under
the auspices of the U.S. Army. The audience for this material
seems to grow and includes many young people.</p>
<p>None of this is news to the people at public television.
Robert Kotlowitz, vice president for arts and humanities
programming at WNET, New York's PBS channel, notes: "Every
time we rerun `The World at War' or `Victory at Sea' we do as
well as the last time or better. We did `Shoah' -- which I
consider a World War II documentary -- in four parts and the
audience got bigger and bigger as the week went on. That was
true nationally, not just in New York." "The World at War"
comes in 13 parts, Mr. Kotlowitz says. "People just get
hooked on it, including young people. After all, what greater
story is there than World War II?"</p>
<p>That it is a story whose ending everyone knows is not
irrelevant to its drawing power; expectation is greater than
surprise, Coleridge told us. The grimness of the first
installments is unrelenting. Still, despite the triumphant
German blitzkrieg, the Stukas bombing Warsaw, the Belgian's
face streaming tears as the invading Germans parade through
the streets -- despite the German officer on his horse,
smiling triumphant under the Arc de Triomphe as the Wehrmacht
units march past, despite the burning ships at Pearl Harbor,
one knows where this will all end. The footage ahead is of
mobilization, the long enlistment lines outside the induction
centers the day after Pearl Harbor, the destruction of the
Japanese fleet at Midway. Of the Allied troops packed into
boats on the coast of England, the fantastic armada bearing
down on Normandy the morning of June 6, 1944. The landing
craft door drops, a British soldier turns to look back, pats
the arm of the man in front, and with the rest lurches into
the water toward the spindly tall house on shore. To
generations of viewers, that soldier, that landing craft,
that tall house on shore, are the central images of D-Day. So
is the infantryman who falls at the shore's edge, and the
one, still walking, dragged out of the water by comrades.</p>
<p>The footage to come is the liberation of Paris, the
assault on Berlin and the Reichstag, the long lines of
defeated Nazi soldiers trudging home. A cameraman recorded a
scene in "The World at War" -- at a newly liberated death
camp. It is of a British officer standing face to face with
the highest ranking Nazi officer in charge. The Nazi
commandant smiles and extends his arm to shake hands. The
British officer stares icily, refusing the hand. It is a
moment -- one, like so many in these films, that sums up the
moral passion of the war.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that some documentaries of this
kind are better than others. After all, what can compete with
"The World at War" -- a work so formidable dramatically and
historically, and to top it off, narrated by Sir Laurence
Olivier. One can ask almost the same question about "Victory
at Sea," with its score by Richard Rodgers. Still, every one
of the documentaries draws from the same source -- World War
II combat footage -- which is why they are getting audiences.</p>
<p>No movie about the period can equal the evocative power of
these grainy black-and-white clips. Not "The Longest Day,"
fine as it is, nor any other Hollywood film, particularly war
movies of the past 30 years. For one thing, the footage is
history unadulterated by revisionism, whereas a kind of
progressive political impulse seems to have unhinged movie
makers on the subject of the war in recent years. For
example, by way of atonement for Hollywood's representation
of our wartime Japanese enemies as buck-teethed runts, there
now appears to be an unwritten law that in current movies all
Japanese military personnel be depicted as not less than
six-foot-five, noble of visage, with Hyperion's curls, vast
sensitivity and learning. A mother could ask no more for her
daughter.</p>
<p>Arts & Entertainment plans to continue showing the war
documentaries, it says, until it gets signals that viewers
are losing interest. If that is the case it will likely be
showing those films into the indefinite future. In "The Great
Gatsby," the narrator refers to those who could, for the last
time in the world, look on something larger and more
significant than themselves. That, for so many in it and of
it, is the meaning of The War. The heroic moment of our
century. Not surprising that the wish to keep revisiting it
is unappeasable.</p>
