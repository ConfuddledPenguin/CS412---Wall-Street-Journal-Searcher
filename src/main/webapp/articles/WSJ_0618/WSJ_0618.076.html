	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Saatchi & Saatchi Co. hopes to win a #45 million
(US$76.9 million) bank guarantee this week so that its
advertising agencies can keep booking commercials on British
television stations.
   But some of the troubled ad giant's 20 banks apparently
are balking. The bankers may demand a stiff price: toughened
terms for Saatchi's recently renewed $450 million line of
credit. "That is something Saatchi may have to consider,"
said one knowledgeable individual. The recalcitrant banks
"would rather not do it {the guarantee}" because "it's a risk
on top of a fairly fully drawn {lending} facility," this
person added.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A Saatchi spokesman said the company has nearly completed
several weeks of negotiations over the bank guarantee.
"Whenever it is required, we'll have it," he said, but
declined to elaborate.</p>
<p>Officials of Saatchi's lead banks, including Barclays Bank
PLC, Chase Manhattan Bank and Citibank, also declined comment
Friday about the guarantee talks. The consortium of 20 banks
renewed the broader $450 million credit line earlier this
year to cover all of Saatchi's financial obligations over the
next three years.</p>
<p>"Saatchi is a very borrowed company," observed Mark
Shepperd, an analyst at UBS Phillips & Drew, a British
brokerage firm. "Most banks don't want to expand their
exposure for something they aren't very happy with."</p>
<p>The ITV Association, which represents British commercial
TV companies, asked Saatchi for the guarantee last month, the
knowledgeable person said. The company is supposed to arrange
the backing before an association committee meets this week.
Without support from all 20 banks, Saatchi may have to ask
the association for more time or to "reduce its demand," this
individual suggested.</p>
<p>The association requests such bank guarantees when it
becomes concerned about ad agencies' financial condition.
Saatchi never had to provide such a guarantee before, the
Saatchi spokesman said, although other big advertising groups
have done so. Saatchi, saddled with heavy debt from a flawed
diversification strategy, recently posted a #7 million net
loss for the fiscal first half and omitted its dividend for
the first time.</p>
<p>The bank guarantee covers the highest amount that agencies
expect to spend on TV commercials during two consecutive
months over the next year, according to Susan de Cesare, the
association's agency executive. The association may withdraw
credit from agencies which fail to arrange a bank guarantee.
These agencies then must "pay for it {air time} up front or
they can't book it," she added.</p>
