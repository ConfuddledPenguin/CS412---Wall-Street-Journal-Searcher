	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Integrated Resources Inc. agreed to sell its
general partner interests in its American Insured Mortgage
Investors series of limited partnerships to Krupp Cos. for
$38.6 million.
   But it isn't clear whether the agreement will be
completed. CRI Inc. is seeking to gain control of the
interests by approaching the partnership investors directly.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Integrated's agreement with Krupp was reached through an
auction supervised by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court here.
Integrated has been in bankruptcy proceedings since February,
and has been seeking to raise cash by selling assets. Krupp
is a Boston real estate investment manager.</p>
<p>The agreement with Krupp, however, is conditioned on a
proposal by CRI being ended. A real estate investment trust
managed by CRI, a real estate syndicator based in Rockville,
Md., last week filed a proposal with the Securities and
Exchange Commission to offer to swap interests in two of its
real estate ventures for the Integrated partnership
interests. CRI values its proposed offer at about $664
million. CRI also filed two lawsuits accusing Integrated's
management of trying to entrench itself at the expense of the
limited partnership investors by changing the management
agreements.</p>
<p>It isn't known what steps Integrated might take to try to
have CRI's proposed exchange offer ended. One option might be
for Integrated to ask the bankruptcy court to block the CRI
proposal. But the AIM partnerships themselves, which invest
in government-insured or guaranteed mortgages, aren't part of
the bankruptcy-law process and continue to operate.</p>
<p>The four funds involved have about 64,000 investors.
Integrated receives income from managing the partnerships in
addition to its general partnership interest.</p>
<p>The CRI proposal is "something we and Krupp are discussing
. . . right now," said Stephen D. Weinroth, Integrated
chairman. He didn't elaborate, but said that if CRI succeeds
in its proposed bid and unseats Integrated as the general
partner, "they would be obligated to give Integrated a
substantial amount of money" under the American Insured
partnership agreements for Integrated's partnership interests
in the funds, aside from management fees.</p>
<p>Mr. Weinroth said he hasn't read the CRI complaint, but
said allegations that Integrated adopted "this cleverly
disguised poison pill are clearly untrue."</p>
<p>A Krupp spokeswoman said she didn't know how or when the
issue might be resolved. There isn't a deadline for the pact
to be completed.</p>
<p>Integrated manages more than 600 partnerships, and values
its assets at about $700 million. Mr. Weinroth said senior
creditors, who are owed about $1 billion, were told in
January they would receive about 45 to 50 cents on the
dollar. He said that figure remains "a proper valuation".
It's unclear what junior creditors, who are owed about $600
million, can expect.</p>
<p>Although the auction set a minimum bid of $40 million
without conditions for the American Insured interests, CRI
said in its filing it was rebuffed in earlier efforts to
purchase the management entities from Integrated, including
an offer of $60 million in February. According to the filing,
Krupp in late May sought to have the court reduce the minimum
bid on the partnerships to $30 million. However, the pact
announced Friday calls for Integrated to receive an added
$6.5 million within a year after Krupps's $38.6 million
payment.</p>
<p>Mr. Weinroth said Integrated hadn't turned down any offers
but he said CRI's $60 million offer involved substantial
deferred payments. The CRI proposal is conditioned on
Integrated reversing the change in its management contract.</p>
