	<h3>The Outlook: Big U.S. Banks Need Much Greater Latitude</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Hoary complaints that economists can't agree
on anything weren't borne out at a recent conference
sponsored here by the American Enterprise Institute.
Discussing "International Competitiveness in Financial
Services," most of the participants agreed on a lot.
   They agreed that the internationalization of finance is
likely to grow even more rapidly in the 1990s than in the
1980s. That strong, highly competitive banks are essential to
strong, highly competitive manufacturing. And that if the
U.S. doesn't modernize its regulatory policies, it may
regulate its big banks into an ever-weaker position.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The AEI conference also turned up little dispute about
what ails U.S. banks: the relatively high costs of capital
and the steep rates they must pay on deposits; the
perhaps-excessive regulatory reports and reserve requirements
demanded of them; their own penchant for making bad loans,
and, perhaps most of all, the limits on the regions and
businesses they may enter.</p>
<p>"We have financial institutions that aren't allowed to
exploit their expertise," complained David W. Mullins Jr.,
the recently appointed member of the Federal Reserve Board.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, restrictions on geographical expansion have
done much to push American banks far down on the lists of the
world's banking giants. In contrast to other countries'
liberal statutes, American antitrust and anti-branching laws
have long barred the creation of nationwide banks.</p>
<p>Consequently, "no U.S. banking organization reflects the
economic strength of our country as a whole," Rep. John J.
LaFalce, a New York Democrat who sits on the House Banking
Committee, told the AEI conference. "Continuing limitations
on interstate operations preclude some of our institutions
from accumulating the critical mass" to help them expand into
other markets.</p>
<p>However, size alone doesn't guarantee global power; some
huge foreign banks are almost exclusively domestic. And
George J. Benston of Emory University attributed "the
dominant current position of the Japanese banks" largely to
Japan's rapid economic growth. He added that measures of
deposit totals ignore "banks' ability to lend or offer
services to customers."</p>
<p>It is that very ability that is being weakened by the
product-line restrictions. At a time when American banks have
already lost many large corporate customers to the
direct-loan market, such restrictions may become the most
serious handicap hobbling U.S. institutions in the 1990s.</p>
<p>"Legal prohibitions that prevent U.S. banks from offering
their customers complete securities and insurance
underwriting and sales," Prof. Benston said, "reduce those
banks' ability to serve their customers and to diversify
their activities. As a result, U.S. banks are somewhat less
profitable and possibly more risky than they would be in the
absence of these restrictions."</p>
<p>Despite the prohibitions, Prof. Benston noted, U.S. banks
are highly innovative, especially with regard to
off-balance-sheet activities. He cited their role "in
developing interest and foreign-exchange rate swaps, futures,
and options for customers to allow them to deal with the
increasing variability of interest rates and other prices."</p>
<p>During the 1990s, he said, U.S. banks' European
subsidiaries "will be able to offer the same services as EEC
banks even though their U.S. branches and subsidiaries must
conform to more restrictive U.S. laws. But because the
Glass-Steagall Act and other laws prohibit most U.S. banks
from being directly involved in such activities as corporate
securities underwriting, insurance and real estate, U.S.
bankers may lack the skills to compete effectively."</p>
<p>Acknowledging that "U.S. banks have lost some competitive
edge to foreign competitors," Kathleen B. Cooper, the chief
economist at Security Pacific National Bank, observed that
it's hard to introduce new products abroad if you can't learn
how at home. "If U.S. banks don't get a broader range of
products, they will no longer be the most innovative," she
added.</p>
<p>Although some AEI speakers forecast nationwide banking
within 10 years, there is some doubt that it will come soon
enough to keep foreign banks from gaining devastating
advantages over their U.S. competitors.</p>
<p>Describing the U.S. as "lurching ineffectively" toward
reform, Rep. LaFalce stated, "Barriers to interstate banking
are gradually falling, and U.S. banks are gradually being
allowed to make limited forays into the securities business.
But the changes we are seeing are not part of a long-term
strategic plan designed to ensure the competitive strength of
our financial-services sector."</p>
<p>Those changes are coming mostly through moves by
regulatory agencies and state legislators. But, arguing that
"piecemeal reform" led to the S&L mess, Mr. Mullins said,
"Reforms should be comprehensive." Also criticizing the
reforms to date, Willard C. Butcher, chief executive of Chase
Manhattan, attacked the currently required "rigid firewalls"
within bank holding companies. Rather than preventing
problems, he said, they can endanger troubled operating units
and reduce service to customers.</p>
<p>"Despite years of debate on financial-institutions
reform," Rep. LaFalce complained, "neither the administration
nor the Congress has made the issue the top priority it
deserves to be." With elections looming, he does "not expect
that we will see any significant legislation on this issue in
this congressional session." But he said the prospects in the
next Congress "are growing stronger with each passing day,"
and he added, "We dare not wait too long -- 1991 must be the
year]"</p>
