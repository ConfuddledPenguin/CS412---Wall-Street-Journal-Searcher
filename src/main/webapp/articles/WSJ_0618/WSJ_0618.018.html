	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- When the Sixth International Conference
on AIDS begins here Wednesday, opening ceremonies will
feature an array of scholars and officials, as well as a gay
activist who chained himself to the New York Stock Exchange
last fall to protest the high price of the AIDS drug AZT.
   Despite the wooing and the inclusion of angry young men
such as Peter Staley of the New York-based activist group ACT
UP, the conference promises to be a theater of political
discontent over the U.S. response to the decade-old epidemic.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Inside the bunker-like Moscone Center, a subterranean
conference center in the gritty area south of Market Street,
more than 10,000 registered participants will gather to hear
some 2,500 reports on the spread, treatment and prevention of
the global epidemic of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.</p>
<p>In the streets outside, several thousand activists are
expected to stage daily demonstrations, many directed by ACT
UP, which is prepared for as many as 500 arrests. They plan
to protest immigration laws restricting entry of homosexuals
and people with the AIDS virus as well as the country's
health establishment for the pace of research and limited
access to new drugs.</p>
<p>"Access is the watchword," says Kevin Farrell, a member of
ACT UP Los Angeles, a branch of the organization. While the
group espouses peaceful civil disobedience, San Francisco
activist Josh Gamson says: "It's hard to call. There are a
lot of angry people out there."</p>
<p>Despite special training in peaceful demonstrations on the
activists' part and a commitment by the San Francisco Police
Department to sensitive crowd control, there were nasty
exchanges last week over fears of violence on both sides.</p>
<p>One police officer, in a televised interview, said
activists might be carrying syringes filled with tainted
blood. A police spokesman tried to defuse the incident by
branding the interview as unauthorized and the syringe story
as "rumors . . . not substantiated reports." Activists said
the affair was a ploy to unleash brutal crowd-control tactics
-- an image the city is struggling to shed. Amid such
tensions, conference organizers have offered top scientists
and dignitaries special secure accommodations and bodyguards
for the week.</p>
<p>Nor will the scene inside Moscone Center be a haven of
scientific decorum. Activists vow to disrupt many speeches
and denounce powerful researchers as "criminals" in white
coats. "The intent isn't to stop the presentation, but we'll
correct them from the floor," says Robin Haueter, a member of
ACT UP from New York. "It could get interesting."</p>
<p>Many scientists, such as Jerome Groopman of New England
Deaconess Hospital in Boston, say that if it turns into "a
zoo," it will doom all future efforts at a large
interdisciplinary AIDS meeting.</p>
<p>The prospect of a debacle also infuriates the moderates
within the AIDS community. Pierre Ludington, an activist
here, wants to attend the meeting to learn more about the
virus that he himself is trying to fend off. To him, the
disruptions are "an absurd infringement."</p>
<p>"I am going to listen and learn," Mr. Ludington says. "And
I bet the majority of virus-positive people want this meeting
to go on." He argues that the less visible majority of gay
people shouldn't allow a small cadre of activists to write
their agenda for them. Moreover, he frets about a possible
backlash.</p>
<p>"People in Des Moines will watch this on TV and say,
`There go those queers again.'" Mr. Ludington says.</p>
<p>If the meeting's scientific agenda doesn't collapse into
chaos, attendees can expect to hear, not about breakthroughs,
but substantial reports on vaccine progress, new disease
manifestations such as AIDS lymphoma and new drugs such as
the designer antibody from Genentech Inc. called CD4-IGG.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, activists expressed only a little optimism
about any sign of reconciliation from Washington. "We're
hoping that President Bush will back down on the immigration
policy on the opening day of the conference," says ACT UP's
Mr. Farrell. Although it wouldn't derail this year's
demonstrations, he says it could salvage the 1992 AIDS
conference in Boston. That meeting just lost its major
sponsor last week, when Harvard University's AIDS Institute
withdrew its support in a protest against the border
restrictions.</p>
<p>As for Mr. Bush, who declined an invitation to address the
conference, he's scheduled to spend Wednesday in more serene
surroundings, at a fund-raising event for the man whom gay
activists consider most inimical to their cause, Sen. Jesse
Helms (R., N.C.).</p>
