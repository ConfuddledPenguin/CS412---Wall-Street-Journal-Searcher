	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- President Bush vetoed a bill that would ease
restrictions on political activity by federal civil servants,
saying the change would "inevitably lead to repoliticizing
the federal work force."
   Mr. Bush's veto, which was expected, was his 12th since he
took office. All his previous vetoes have been sustained;
most recently, the Senate last week sustained his veto of an
Amtrak authorization bill by two votes. Mr. Bush is also
expected to veto a measure passed by Congress late Thursday
that would guarantee workers as much as 12 weeks' unpaid
leave for childbirth, adoption or serious family illnesses.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In rejecting the measure to lift restrictions on federal
workers' campaign activities, Mr. Bush said the current
system protects workers from harassment and ensures the
integrity and neutrality of the federal work force. Since
1939, the so-called Hatch Act has barred federal workers from
most partisan political activity aside from voting, including
holding partisan political positions or participating in
campaigns. Federal workers can, however, participate in
non-partisan activities such as school board races.</p>
<p>Labor leaders and representatives from jurisdictions with
a substantial federal work force pressed for the changes,
saying three million federal and postal workers should have
the same rights as other citizens. The changes approved by
Congress last week, by a vote of 334-87 in the House and
67-30 in the Senate, would allow federal and postal workers
to hold positions in the political parties, to attend party
conventions as delegates and to raise money from fellow
members of the same union.</p>
<p>Although the original votes in both houses were large
enough to override Mr. Bush's veto, GOP leaders have
expressed confidence they can muster the votes in the Senate
to sustain the veto.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some Republicans are urging Mr. Bush not to
follow through on his threat to veto the parental-leave bill.
"I would hope the First Father wouldn't make this decision
without first hearing from Republicans who support the bill,"
said Rep. Marge Roukema (R., N.J.). "There are reasons why
business should be concerned about intrusive new mandates,
but this isn't one of them."</p>
