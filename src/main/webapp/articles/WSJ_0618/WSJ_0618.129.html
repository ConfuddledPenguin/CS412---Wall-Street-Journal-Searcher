	<p class="article-leader">MIAMI -- American Capital Corp. said it missed a $3.3
million interest payment on its 8.4% subordinated notes that
it was supposed to make Friday.
   The savings and loan holding company said it has until
July 16 to make the payment before it is in default. It said
it is discussing a proposed transaction with noteholders that
would involve the exchange of the notes for other securities
not requiring cash interest payments.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>If those talks fail, the company said it will decide by
July 16 whether to make the interest payment.</p>
