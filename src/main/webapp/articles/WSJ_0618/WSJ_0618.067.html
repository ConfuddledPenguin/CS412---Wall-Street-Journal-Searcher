	<p class="article-leader">PHOENIX -- Amid the piles on Sam Steiger's desk is a
political guidebook entitled "Break the Rules and Win." It
was someone's fitting gift to an Arizona institution who is
like no other candidate for a governorship this fall.
   The Republican rancher-businessman is a candidate without
a car phone, holding his pipe instead as he shuttles
contentedly about this metropolis in a Dodge convertible. He
sometimes sounds like he's running to prove a point to the
campaign consultants of America. He emphasizes a distaste for
"packaging." His radio spots were cut from a Steiger
monologue his sons taped in their father's kitchen in
Prescott. No pollster pointed him toward winning issues, and
the ads run randomly without an attempt to target subject
matter to station audience.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the jumble of politics in the nation's
second-fastest-growing state (behind only Nevada), maybe it
pays just to let the rhetorical missiles fall where they
will. Arizona is an uneasy mix of cowboys & Indians, retirees
and urban professionals, but the fact that nearly a million
of them found their way here in the 1980s gives it added
national weight. It should gain two congressional districts
from the new Census, and that makes the governorship a bigger
prize. Moreover, Mr. Steiger's beliefs, a modified form of
laissez faire, have special significance here, where the
political drift is toward the bigger government that typifies
populous jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Long removed from his native Brooklyn, Mr. Steiger appears
comfortable with who he is, where's he been and what he
thinks. That's not as clear a plus as it might seem, because
in standard political terms, he is damaged goods.</p>
<p>His story began auspiciously enough, with election to the
Arizona Senate in 1960 at age 31. He was a congressman at 37
and recognized as a conservative comer during the Nixon
presidency. After five House terms, however, his bid for the
U.S. Senate in 1976 was entangled in a bitter primary that he
says included anti-Semitism by his opponent; he was defeated
in the fall by Democrat Dennis DeConcini.</p>
<p>Thus began a decade of setbacks private and public. The
cattle business went sour. In 1982 he ran for governor -- as
the nominee of the Libertarian Party. Mr. Steiger got an
unusually high 5% of the vote then, but the link with what
even he and many other small-L libertarians regard as a
fringe group did not enhance his gravitas. The Purple Heart
winner in Korea was already an oddball in some eyes because
of a brush with the law years before when he shot some feral
burros in the behind. (The incident still comes up.)</p>
<p>Mr. Steiger re-entered public life as an aide to Evan
Mecham, the right-wing populist elected governor in a
three-way race in 1986. He left his post prior to Mr.
Mecham's impeachment and removal by the Legislature in 1988,
but not before he himself was caught up in the
political/legal storm. He was convicted of extortion for
threatening a parole official's job, but an appellate court,
apparently accepting Mr. Steiger's contention that his
characteristic bluster was distorted by an anti-Mecham
prosecutor, overturned the verdict.</p>
<p>In his campaign appearances Mr. Steiger jokes about his
hard times. He portrays himself as an "SOB" who can whip a
fractious Legislature into action, and as a man whose own ups
and downs suit him for governing a state that's suffered a
real-estate finance blowout in recent years but, according to
Mr. Steiger, is primed for recovery.</p>
<p>Mr. Mecham, also trying a comeback as one of Mr. Steiger's
opponents in the Sept. 11 Republican primary, includes his
former aide in his stump vitriol. The pair are among the
three leading GOP contenders. (Fife Symington, a wealthy
developer, is considered the front-runner by some.)</p>
<p>Mr. Steiger has been less harsh on his former boss, though
he points up management and personal weaknesses. What brought
the two together in 1986 was a shared antipathy for Arizona's
power structure, which these days is a bedfellowship of
statist Democrats and corporatist Republicans. Mr. Steiger
says he wanted to strike at the expanding governmental mass
through streamlinings and privatizations, but Mr. Mecham was
distracted by uproars over his crankiness toward cosmopolitan
culture. With only a limited political base to begin with,
Mr. Mecham couldn't withstand a press frenzy fed by his own
maladroitness. He was later acquitted of criminal charges.</p>
<p>The Democrat who took his place, longtime Secretary of
State Rose Mofford, generally restored the policies of Mr.
Mecham's predecessor, Bruce Babbitt. Symbolically foremost
among these: a paid holiday to honor Martin Luther King Jr.
After a petition campaign made the first attempt at
reinstituting the King day off subject to a referendum this
November, Ms. Mofford and a media-led coalition got the
legislators this spring to pass a bill to circumvent the
vote. This has led to another active petition drive to get
the issue back on the November ballot. Mr. Mecham's people
are leading the effort. Meanwhile, a referendum drive is
pledged by opponents of a tax increase that may pass in the
legislature today to accommodate rapid growth in state
spending.</p>
<p>The particular volatility of Arizona politics in 1990 is
an environment the rough-and-tumble Mr. Steiger may find
advantageous. He says, however, that stability is required
because "Arizona is fast earning a national reputation as the
Venice Beach of the world" because of its freakish politics,
and that his free-market pragmatism and common sense are the
antidote.</p>
<p>Indeed, Mr. Steiger appears to have kept at least a foot
in the establishment's camp. His campaign treasurer is a top
official of the Phoenix 40, a civic group that functions as a
sort of executive council of what might be called the
governing Arizocracy. And he has taken a progressive stance
on some social issues. He backs the King holiday. He urges
more use of "intensive probation" as an alternative to prison
time, which he says breeds more crime. And he favors abortion
rights, admitting he's lost conservative backers as a result
but arguing that a lucrative black market would spring up in
the event of restrictions.</p>
<p>Although he has discarded the formal affiliation, Mr.
Steiger remains essentially a libertarian. He says economists
Milton Friedman and Murray Rothbard have most influenced him.
When asked, he's prone to say that farmers shouldn't get
subsidized water and other businesses shouldn't be favored
either, except possibly on land-improvement costs. But his
platform comes off as rather moderate. He dodges the
drug-legalization issue. Privatization remains his way of
slimming down the state agencies, 40% of whose employees, he
says, are in management.</p>
<p>A big issue for Mr. Steiger recently has been the rapid
growth of the state university system. (Arizona State now has
65,000 students; the University of Arizona, 40,000.) He
suggests that many enrollees belong instead in a beefed up
community-college system.</p>
<p>Mr. Steiger likes to bash the bar. One of his aims is to
have "lawyers leaving Arizona for lack of business, and
business coming for lack of lawyers." He seeks to require
losing plaintiffs to pay civil-court costs of the defense in
order to deter litigiousness. It was reported last week
however, that Mr. Steiger himself hasn't paid a 1984 judgment
and costs from a civil case he initiated.</p>
<p>Although he lists as qualifications a penchant for
personal deal-making and "a perverse delight in making people
mad," two traits that might be ascribed to Evan Mecham, Mr.
Steiger hastens to draw a contrast. He knows when to cajole,
he says, and would delegate authority, whereas Mr. Mecham
wouldn't. He recalls being in the governor's office during
one of the tense periods when Mr. Mecham, an auto dealer in
private life, was interrupted to approve an advertising
jingle his son, then running the dealership, had conceived.</p>
<p>Mr. Steiger may be an effective bargainer in the halls of
power, and he's uncommonly funny for a politico, but his
people skills on the campaign trail are being tested. Like
many successful and/or wealthy men, he can seem oblivious to
indignities felt by those below his station, his gruff humor
only making matters worse. At a small Kiwanis luncheon in
May, Mr. Steiger joked a couple of times about the uninspired
Red Lobster venue. This was received well enough, but then he
tried a variant of the "food's not so good, but the service
is lousy" line in front of the waiter. The youth wore one of
the chain's "Star Performer" pins, and despite an "only
kidding" assurance, the candidate didn't leave 'em laughing
at that one.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, for much of the electorate, a contrast
between Mr. Steiger and the likely Democratic nominee, the
recently resigned mayor of Phoenix, Terry Goddard, could work
in the GOP's favor. Mr. Goddard, himself the son of a former
Arizona governor, is perceived as a yuppie. Before that
match-up can occur, though, Mr. Steiger must turn back Mr.
Mecham, who retains a loyal following, and Mr. Symington, the
pick of the corporate elite.</p>
<p>Polls show the three Republicans in a tight race, but Mr.
Steiger isn't listening to any numbers anyway. He's only
speaking his mind. Just don't expect to hear from him while
he's driving.</p>
