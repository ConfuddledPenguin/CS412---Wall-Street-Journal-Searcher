	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Cineplex Odeon Corp., continuing its strategy
of selling off non-core assets to reduce its heavy debt load,
said it has found buyers for 62 of its U.S. movie theaters.
   In one transaction, set to close by the end of June,
Cineplex agreed to sell 24 theaters in North Carolina, South
Carolina and Tennessee to Columbus, Ga.-based Carmike Cinemas
Inc. Cineplex said it would receive between $7 million and
$13 million for the theaters, depending on their operating
cash flow in 1990.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Cineplex also agreed to sell 38 movie theaters with 150
screens in Utah, Idaho, Minnesota, Oregon and Washington to
Plitt Amusement Co., Los Angeles, for $31.8 million. That
transaction is scheduled to close by July 31.</p>
<p>The sales take the motion picture theater chain one step
closer to its goal of raising $200 million through asset
sales by the end of 1990. Under new, more restrictive bank
agreements, Cineplex must complete the asset sales and apply
$135 million of the proceeds to reducing its debt load. At
the end of the first quarter, Cineplex had debt of about $620
million.</p>
<p>But Cineplex's president and chief executive officer,
Allen Karp, warned that the market for theaters is difficult
and that the company doesn't intend to dispose of assets at
what he called "fire sale prices."</p>
<p>"We are not going to give assets away," Mr. Karp said
after Cineplex's annual meeting Friday.</p>
<p>Mr. Karp said an "extremely, extremely healthy
relationship" with the company's two major shareholders, MCA
Inc. and Montreal's Bronfman family, allows him to hold out
for "realistic" prices for the assets. The two major holders
have agreed to invest a total of $100 million in Cineplex if
the company doesn't achieve its asset sale targets, either in
the form of subordinated debt or through a rights offering.</p>
<p>"I would have felt good if we could have gotten another $5
million or $10 million," Mr. Karp said of the sales. Analysts
note that the movie theater industry is characterized by
overcapacity and a difficult financing environment.</p>
