	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Sutton Holding Corp., which has been trying to
acquire DeSoto Inc. since last year, said it will seek three
seats on DeSoto's board.
   Sutton also said it offered to buy certain of DeSoto's
businesses as an alternative to its $50-a-share, or $200
million, tender offer for the Des Plaines, Ill.-based maker
of paints, chemical coatings and detergents.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>DeSoto stock fell $3.25 Friday, closing at $40.25 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
<p>Two Sutton executives, Chairman William Spier and Senior
Vice President Michael Zurawin, will seek board seats at
Desoto's annual meeting July 16, along with Giorgio Arra, a
Sutton director.</p>
<p>Sutton and a DeSoto spokesman said the nominations were
made under an agreement with Sutton, a New York investor
group. The election of the three would expand DeSoto's board
to 13 members.</p>
<p>Saying that DeSoto had failed to enhance shareholder
value, Sutton said it would offer $45 million for DeSoto's
detergent business if the company sold all of its other
businesses. Sutton said it would then take steps to acquire
all of DeSoto's outstanding shares.</p>
<p>Failing that, Sutton said, it would offer about $90
million for DeSoto's detergent and surfactant businesses.</p>
<p>In a statement, Sutton said the offers were made because
DeSoto "was having trouble selling certain businesses in a
timely manner."</p>
<p>Sutton also said it extended its tender offer until
midnight EDT June 25. The offer had been set to expire last
Friday.</p>
<p>The DeSoto spokesman had no comment on Sutton's
unsolicited offers for DeSoto or its businesses.</p>
