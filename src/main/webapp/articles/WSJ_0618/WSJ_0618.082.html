	<p class="article-leader">JOHANNESBURG -- Anglo American Corp. of South Africa said
it will curtail mining operations at two of its subsidiaries
because of the plummeting price of gold.
   Anglo American said the moves at its Free State
Consolidated Gold Mines Ltd. and Vaal Reefs Exploration &
Mining Co. subsidiaries would cut at least 7,800 jobs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The price of gold reached a four-year low of $346.25 an
ounce in New York and London last Thursday before recovering
amid central bank buying. Gold is South Africa's major
industry, earning more than half the country's foreign
currency.</p>
<p>Lionel Hewitt, managing director of Anglo American's gold
and uranium division, said the curtailment of operations will
take place over the next nine months. He said the cutbacks at
Vaal Reefs won't necessarily eliminate jobs, because workers
may be assigned to other areas of the mine.</p>
<p>Operating reductions at Free State will reduce its gold
output by less than 1%, while the proposed action at Vaal
Reefs probably will improve production, Mr. Hewitt said.</p>
