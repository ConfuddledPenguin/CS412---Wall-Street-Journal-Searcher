	<p class="article-leader">Wendy's International Inc., Dublin, Ohio, agreed to drop a
year-old lawsuit against Carl Karcher Enterprises Inc.,
Anaheim, Calif., that related to conversion of 10 Wendy's
fast-food restaurants in Arizona to Carl's Jr. restaurants.
   Karcher bought the restaurants from Ronald Brown, owner of
Wendy's of Tucson Inc., a Wendy's franchisee, over the
objections of Wendy's International. Wendy's filed suit
against Karcher, Mr. Brown and his company, charging that the
transaction violated Wendy's franchise relationship.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the settlement, Wendy's agreed to approve sale of
the restaurants and to drop its lawsuit, which sought damages
exceeding $100 million from Karcher and Mr. Brown. Karcher,
also a fast-food restaurant chain, agreed not to buy any
additional Wendy's restaurants without the consent of Wendy's
International.</p>
