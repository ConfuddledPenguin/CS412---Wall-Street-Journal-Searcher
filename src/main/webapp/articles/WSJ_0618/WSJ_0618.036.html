	<p class="article-leader">Reebok International Ltd. itself is the most likely buyer
for the 31.5% stake in the company put on the block by
Pentland Group PLC, its largest shareholder, analysts say.
   Several analysts speculated that London-based Pentland
will shop the block around for several months, but find few
bidders because of the limitations on what a buyer could do
with the shares. However, the effort may help determine a
fair price. "I think it's a dance to determine price," said
Gary Jacobson, footwear analyst at Kidder, Peabody & Co.
"Pentland feels it's worth a premium. Reebok probably
doesn't," he said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Reebok disclosed Pentland's plan late Thursday, and
simultaneously announced new takeover defenses. In New York
Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Reebok rose 50 cents
to $18.50. At that price, Pentland's 36.2 million shares of
Reebok would be worth about $670 million.</p>
<p>U.S. analysts struggled to come up with names of companies
that might be interested in acquiring a minority stake in a
maker of trendy footwear. They noted that standstill
agreements would prohibit a buyer from expanding its stake.
In addition, Reebok's second biggest holder, Chairman Paul
Fireman, who owns 14.5% of the firm's stock, has a right of
first refusal on the Pentland shares.</p>
<p>In a telephone interview Friday, Frank Farrant, finance
director of Pentland, a footwear trading firm, said "we have
a list of people that we intend to contact" about possibly
buying the stake. He declined to identify then or provide the
timing of any sale. He said Pentland plans to sell the stock
as a block in order "to get strategic value for it."</p>
<p>Mr. Farrant, who also sits on Reebok's board, emphasized
that Pentland was ending its relationship amicably. He said
Pentland originally invested $77,000 in Reebok in 1981 and
has realized #37 million ($63.2 million) through previous
sales of Reebok shares.</p>
<p>The executive said Pentland is disposing of its remaining
Reebok shares because it doesn't reap cash flow from a
minority position, only dividends. Reebok pays a quarterly
dividend of 7.5 cents a share. Mr. Farrant added: "We don't
want to take the money and run. We want to take the money and
invest it in a business that will give us cash flow." But he
conceded that Pentland won't easily find another growth stock
like Reebok: "The reality of life is you only are blessed
once."</p>
<p>Pentland has hired S.G. Warburg & Co., London, to help it
sell its Reebok stake. Reebok has hired First Boston Corp., a
New York investment banking firm, to advise it, according to
Wall Street executives. First Boston declined comment.</p>
<p>A Warburg official indicated that Pentland expects to
receive offers for its Reebok shares from companies outside
the U.S. which could help Reebok grow abroad. "We think it is
important to help Reebok to grow in international markets and
I think that's where a lot of interest will come from," the
Warburg official said.</p>
<p>The Warburg official declined to comment on whether
Pentland had asked Reebok to buy its holdings, or how Reebok
might have responded.</p>
<p>Pentland decided to sell its Reebok shares now because a
series of contracts under which Pentland supplies Reebok with
merchandise expire this year, the Warburg official said.</p>
<p>If Reebok does end up buying back the shares it would be
good for Reebok holders because it would "shrink the market
capitalization and accelerate the earnings gains," said Alice
Ruth, an analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco.
She said Reebok has ample cash flow to support borrowing
money to buy back the Pentland block. She calculated that if
Reebok bought the Pentland stake at $20 a share it would cost
about $82 million in annual interest costs, well below the
company's estimated $250 million in available annual cash
flow, she said.</p>
<p>Ms. Ruth said Reebok's value in a takeover might be as
high as $24 to $26 a share, but she said she considers a
takeover unlikely.</p>
<p>Heidi Steinberg, who follows specialty retailing for
Salomon Bros., said that in a hostile takeover, "Reebok would
be more than a $2 billion purchase. The companies that could
afford it wouldn't be interested. Those who would be
interested couldn't afford it. I don't think Reebok is likely
to be put into play."</p>
<p>However, Dennis Rosenberg, a special situations analyst
with Oppenheimer & Co., said the Pentland plan "definitely"
puts Reebok in play. He said that between its substantial
cash flow and its well-known brand name, the company would be
attractive to acquirers who might bid for the Pentland block.
He speculated that such a bidder would want to make an offer
for the entire company, despite Mr. Fireman's wish that it
remain independent.</p>
<p>"Fireman has to act in the interests of all the
shareholders," Mr. Rosenberg said.</p>
