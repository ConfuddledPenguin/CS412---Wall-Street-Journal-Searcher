	<p class="article-leader">MADRID -- Repsol S.A., the Spanish state-controlled oil
company, and La Caixa, Spain's largest savings bank, are
understood to be at an advanced stage in negotiations for the
creation of a giant Spanish gas utility.
   The principal remaining question, however, is understood
to be who will be Repsol's partner in the utility: Repsol
wants La Caixa itself as a partner, while the savings bank
would prefer to participate indirectly through water utility
Aguas de Barcelona S.A., of which it is a shareholder.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At stake are Spanish government efforts to reorganize
Spain's fragmented gas industry and keep it under Spanish
control. Repsol officials say their aim is to create a single
large gas utility along the lines of British Gas, Gaz de
France or Belgium's Distrigas.</p>
<p>Repsol's parent, the state oil and gas agency Instituto
Nacional de Hidrocarburos, is investing heavily through
Repsol's sister company, Enagas, in a project to bring
natural gas by pipeline to Spain from Norway.</p>
<p>In parallel, Repsol began talks last year aimed at
regrouping its gas activities with those of Spain's biggest
gas utility, Barcelona-based Catalana de Gas S.A.</p>
<p>But alarm bells rang a few months ago when the U.K.'s
British Gas disclosed it had bought around 8% of Catalana de
Gas.</p>
<p>The prospect of foreign companies getting an inexpensive
back door into Spain's gas market added impetus to Repsol's
efforts to forge a unified national gas utility.</p>
<p>To strengthen Repsol's hand, INH launched a bid last month
for control of Gas Madrid, Spain's second largest gas
utility. As a result of this bid, INH now controls 87% of
Enagas, directly and through Repsol.</p>
<p>The plans under discussion between Repsol and La Caixa
call for the creation of a joint holding company owning
Repsol's holdings in Gas Madrid and a number of regional gas
utilities. The regional interests would include a sizable
stake in Catalana de Gas, which in turn has stakes in gas
firms in Andalusia and Valencia. Repsol owns 11.8% of
Catalana de Gas, and La Caixa owns 24%. Another
Barcelona-based savings bank, Caja de Barcelona, which is
planning to merge with La Caixa, owns 10% of Catalana de Gas.</p>
<p>But a spokeswoman for La Caixa said the talks, though at
an advanced stage, appear for the moment to have reached a
dead end.</p>
<p>The reason, she said, was the government's insistence that
La Caixa be Repsol's direct partner in the gas venture.</p>
