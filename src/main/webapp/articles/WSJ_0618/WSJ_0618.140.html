	<p class="article-leader">Dow Chemical says there are going to be a lot of red faces
on Wall Street when its earnings rebound and the stock starts
climbing.
   "People are going to be surprised," says John Lillich,
investor relations director.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company says Wall Street analysts are overreacting to
a cyclical downturn in commodity prices while ignoring its
shift toward high-profit-margin specialty chemicals, drugs
and consumer products. Such "value-added" products will
account for 50% of Dow Chemical's 1990 profit, up from 32%
last year, and their future contribution will be greater than
many analysts think, Mr. Lillich says.</p>
<p>Dow Chemical says earnings in 1991 should actually
increase, albeit "slightly," from 1990 estimates in the range
of $6.50 to $7 a share.</p>
<p>That would certainly be a shock for the Street. Several
analysts recently downgraded the stock to a hold from a buy,
citing a big cost that might grow out of its Marion
Laboratories acquisition. Many say that earnings, widely
expected to drop 25% this year, are likely to be flat or down
slightly in 1991.</p>
<p>A lone wolf in praising the stock is Allen Simpson, owner
of Simpson Capital Management in Philadelphia. He says the
chemical industry is poised for strong growth when the
economy picks up, which it should if interest rates fall as
he expects. Dow Chemical's estimated 20% return on equity
this year makes the stock "a strong buy" at around 10 times
this year's estimated earnings, he says. "It's significantly
undervalued" at Friday's 63 and he says it could top 90
within 12 months.</p>
<p>Most analysts couldn't disagree more.</p>
<p>"There has been a perception that Dow could lead the
industry in 1990 and 1991, but the outlook still isn't good.
We think the stock will only be an average performer," says
Leonard Bogner of Prudential-Bache Securities. Expanding
industry capacity is expected to trigger "precipitous" price
declines starting in late 1990, prolonging softer earnings
until mid-1991, he says. This month Mr. Bogner downgraded Dow
to a hold from a buy, shaving his per-share estimates to
$6.60 for 1990 and to the same amount (down from $7.25) for
1991.</p>
<p>A major concern is the $1.5 billion some think Dow
Chemical may still have to pay in connection with its Marion
Laboratories acquisition; it now holds 67% of a combined
Marion Merrell Dow. Dow Chemical promised to pay as much as
that amount on Sept. 30, 1991 -- or a larger amount in 1992
-- if Marion Merrell shares don't reach specified levels.
(Dow Chemical's obligation would decline incrementally if
Marion Merrell's shares top $30, and would reach zero if they
hit $45.77.)</p>
<p>But the Street is skeptical that Marion Merrell, at 23 1/2
Friday, will rise beyond the low to mid-30s. Two mainstay
drugs, the heart drug Cardizem and the nonsedating
antihistamine Seldane, lose marketing exclusivity in 1992 and
1994, yet the company hasn't announced major new drugs to
replace ground that may be lost to generics.</p>
<p>Even if Marion Merrell shares reach $35, Dow Chemical
would have to fork over roughly $1 billion at an awkward
time. With earnings down and capital spending peaking at $2
billion a year, Dow Chemical is expected to have negative
cash flow in 1991. A major outlay for Marion could force the
company to increase debt.</p>
<p>The Marion situation is "the catalyst" for downgrading
Dow, says Paul Leming of Morgan Stanley. He says the company
faces a "high probability" of paying the maximum $1.5 billion
liability at the same time it is experiencing a "classic
end-of-cycle cash flow problem." Nonetheless, Mr. Leming says
Dow presents a "paradox." He still thinks the shares could
climb to $75 or $80 in the next year, despite "diminishing
likelihood of positive developments" as 1991 earnings slip to
perhaps $6 a share.</p>
<p>Analysts say Dow's new products, such as Spiffits cleaning
towels, aren't big enough to compensate for sagging commodity
prices. Ethylene prices, for example, are expected to drop an
additional 35% over the next 20 months.</p>
<p>"I don't see any great blockbuster coming down the pike
that will make a major improvement in Dow's profitability
over the next three to four years," says William R. Young of
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. The shares could rise or fall
depending on the economy, says Mr. Young, who has a neutral
rating on the stock.</p>
<p>Dow remains attractive for long-term investors, says Avi
Nash of Goldman Sachs, though the stock isn't on the firm's
recommended list. With leading products, geographic
diversity, a strong position in Europe and low production
costs, he says, the company should rebound with solid growth
in 1992 or 1993.</p>
