	<p class="article-leader">Dravo Corp., Pittsburgh, said it has resumed its shell
dredging in southern Louisiana following a consent judgment
ending a lengthy dispute over the legality of Dravo's leases.
Dredging had been suspended last May 25.
   Dravo said the dispute began in 1983 over procedures in
which the company obtained leases to dredge for shells, which
it uses as an aggregate in road construction. The agreement
deletes from the leases three specific areas that previously
had been included in the dredging tracts, Dravo said, but
impact on shell recovery "will be minimal."</p>
