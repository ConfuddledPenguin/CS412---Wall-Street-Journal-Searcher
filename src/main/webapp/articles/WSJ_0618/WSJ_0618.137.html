	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- All the trend lines in the Middle East
suddenly point toward trouble for President Bush.
   Public attention has been focused on the souring of U.S.
relations with both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute.
The formation of a right-wing Israeli government clearly has
complicated the Bush administration's peace efforts. At the
same time, Mr. Bush is considering whether to suspend the
American dialogue with the Palestinian Liberation
Organization because of the role a PLO group played in a
seaborne attack on Israel.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But those events are just pieces of a broader, more
troubling mosaic of new problems in the region that are
deeply worrying Bush administration policymakers.
Specifically:</p>
<p>-- Once-moderate Jordan is moving more and more into the
orbit of Iraq and its hardline leader, Saddam Hussein.
Jordan's King Hussein is spouting anti-American, anti-Israeli
rhetoric; he has allowed his air force to conduct joint
military maneuvers with Iraq and is warning of dire
consequences if Soviet Jews emigrating to Israel push
Palestinians out of Israeli-occupied territories and into
Jordan.</p>
<p>-- PLO leader Yasser Arafat also seems to be drifting
closer to Iraq. That means Mr. Arafat is sliding away from
Egypt's Hosni Mubarak, who has been a moderating influence on
the PLO chief for the last few years.</p>
<p>-- The rise of an increasingly belligerent Iraq and the
drift of Jordan and the PLO toward it have left Egypt,
America's best friend in the Arab world, more isolated and
less effective.</p>
<p>-- All this is occurring against a backdrop of
proliferation of dangerous arms in the region, particularly
long-range missiles and chemical weapons. There is "a sense
of the Middle East on edge," says one of the administration's
top Middle East policy-makers.</p>
<p>Richard Murphy, formerly the head of the State
Department's Middle East bureau, says the situation is
particularly troubling because it is developing at a time
when there is an Arab perception that a war government has
just been brought to power in Israel. "I guess my concern is
of accidents happening because there is no or very little
peace process to point to," he says.</p>
<p>Of course, these dangerous trends are offset in part by
the decline in U.S.-Soviet animosity, which removes a source
of tension that long contributed to fears of war in the
Middle East. With the Soviet Union beset by its own problems,
it no longer seems plausible that Moscow might seek to alter
the superpower balance of power by prodding its friends in
Iraq and Syria to seek a fight with Israel, America's closest
friend in the region.</p>
<p>But new forces, many of them beyond President Bush's
control, could lead to hostilities. Iraq seems to have grown
more bellicose toward Israel in recent months, in part out of
genuine fear that Israel is contemplating some kind of
pre-emptive military strike at Iraq's missile and
chemical-arms installations. Those Iraqi fears will only grow
as a result of the formation of Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir's new government.</p>
<p>The Israelis, in turn, already are edgy because of the
signs of increased military cooperation between Iraq and
Jordan. Israel was particularly troubled by an incident last
year in which Jordanian and Iraqi jets flew a joint training
mission near Israeli territory. King Hussein, his kingdom in
bad economic shape, may see little choice now but to
cooperate more with oil-rich Iraq in hopes of winning both
its protection and its economic aid.</p>
<p>The increased flow of Soviet Jews into Israel is
exacerbating Arab-Israeli tensions across the board. King
Hussein, in particular, worries that the new Israeli
government is likely to funnel thousands of the Soviet
emigres into the Israeli-occupied West Bank, prodding
Palestinians there to head into neighboring Jordan. There,
they might disrupt the king's regime.</p>
<p>Adding to this volatile mix is the prospect that the
long-running uprising among Palestinians in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip may grow in intensity if Palestinian anger is
stoked by an American decision to cut off its dialogue with
the PLO.</p>
<p>The danger for President Bush is that some spark could set
off this volatile mixture, creating an explosion that draws
in the U.S., says Judith Kipper, a Middle East analyst at the
Brookings Institution, adding that rather than simply wait
for peace agreements, the U.S. and the Soviet Union ought to
move jointly to put in place a "regional security structure"
to prevent a blowup.</p>
<p>For their part, President Bush's aides insist they don't
intend to retreat from the region simply because trends are
bad; they argue that American involvement is more important
than ever at such times. But the dangers are arising at a
time when the chief American tool to prevent a blowup -- a
peace process that holds out some hope of resolving the
Palestinian problem -- is dead in the water.</p>
