	<p class="article-leader">LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Cumberland Federal Bancorp. said it
holds four first-mortgage loans from Hunnington Group Inc.,
which filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of
the federal Bankruptcy Code Wednesday.
   Cumberland, a thrift holding company, said $17.4 million
is due on the loans. The company said it believes collateral
for the loans, a group of retail, commercial and residental
development projects in eastern Jefferson County, Ky., "is
adequate to protect its investment."</p>
