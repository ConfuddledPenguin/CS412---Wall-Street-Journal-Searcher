	<p class="article-leader">The U.S. political arena is beginning to look like a
traveling circus. In center ring, the world-famous American
flag-burning controversy. Ring left, we feature a national
argument over the sex-drenched lyrics of a rap group called 2
Live Crew. And in the arts circle there's a nonstop pitched
battle over the erotic photographs of Robert Mapplethorpe.
   The news outlets that describe and in a sense do the
promotion for the actors in these controversies tend to
define them in the same basic terms. It's always a
confrontation between right-wing zealots on one side and free
thinkers and First-Amendment advocates on the other. In a
Flag Day parade in Chicago last week, one sign read: "Make
Our Day -- Try and Burn These Flags, Pinkos," while in front
of the city's Art Institute the Revolutionary Communist Youth
Brigade did burn flags.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>When a Cincinnati objects to photos of Robert
Mapplethorpe's most private behavior or when a Chicago
objects to an artist at the local Art Institute laying out
the American flag as a foot-wipe, the signal coming off
nearly every news account in the land of these disagreements
is that folks in Cincinnati and Chicago reflect some
tight-lipped, up-from-the-swamps provincialism. And, the
story line continues, if truth is to prevail, media pressure
and a congenial judge will send them scuttling home, tails
between their legs.</p>
<p>To a great extent, many of these controversies are largely
scams. They exist because the people who organize them know
that the press and the people in the TV business will provide
publicity. The Broward County, Florida, legal system hasn't
made 2 Live Crew rich and famous; the media have. All such a
group has to do is manage to get arrested, and the media
moguls will descend on them with millions in free
advertising. But of course, the newspapers defending the 2
Live Crew lyrics or the Mapplethorpe photographs somehow
desist from inflicting them on their readers.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>It's been fun, but maybe it's time to recognize that
something more complex is going on than yet another First
Amendment dispute. We'll admit that some of these issues
arrive in difficult shades of gray, but how did it ever
happen that it is now a settled "right" to spend public money
to promote Robert Mapplethorpe's bullwhip photographs, but an
indisputable "crime" to spend public money on prayer in a
school. Somehow, it seems to us, the country's basic social
and political principles have left the tracks.</p>
<p>Or rather, perhaps, the principles of the country's
largely self-appointed elites have fundamentally diverged
from the broader public's. Our sense is that the broader
public wants some sense of community; it feels the community
has a right to set some standards. As Harlem political leader
Basil Patterson said recently: "Everything has gotten so
crude. You hear it in the streets all the time, and not just
there. In some of the music you hear now, and on television."
Standards, of course, imply that some things are left in and
some are left out; some things are allowed, some are not. It
is sometimes called having a sense of judgment.</p>
<p>Against this, elite culture in the U.S. over the past 20
years has developed the position, and presses it every time
one of these flaps arises, that community standards equate
with majority repression of anything that is individual,
iconoclastic, experimental, free. What is primarily at work
here is an assault on the notion of community standards. It
is an attempt to eliminate all the practices and procedures
that civil society in the United States has established to
define itself.</p>
<p>What's more, this mind-set has its own internal
censorship. Many common-sense liberals have discovered that
they are expected to adhere to a seamless web of ideological
commitments -- flag-burning as politics, Sierra Club
environmentalism, the most extremely militant gay rights,
militant women's rights, animal rights, sexual display as
art, unlimited abortion. Liberals are not only not allowed to
deviate from the claims of their most extreme members on any
of these matters, they will be denounced or driven out if
they do. And so Congress's hapless Democrats end up making a
no-win defense of flag burners.</p>
<p>It is something of a paradox that these are the people who
claim to be defending independent thinking. For example it is
they, in the torrent of lobbying and reporting around funding
"controversial" programs at the National Endowment for the
Arts, who claim to be holding back the booboisie from the
gates of late 20th-century culture, represented by the
chocolate woman Karen Finley (formerly the yam woman), Andres
Serrano's "Piss Christ," and 2 Live Crew. Culture? Are these
people kidding?</p>
<p>Further, it is simply foolish to believe that refusing to
give public grants to a Karen Finley is the first step on a
slippery slope to banning "Ulysses." No one is talking about
community standards that legalize oppressions such as
separate racial drinking fountains. They are looking for
standards that help the community's members with the task of
moving forward in a complex world with a moral and political
compass. Denying the community's right to press its views on
flag burning or public obscenity because it might hamper
someone's "individual rights" is to obliterate the very idea
of judgment. Just who are the yahoos here?</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Sooner or later the political and intellectual leadership
of this country has to wake up to fact that this constant,
recurring tension between these extreme positions and the
American middle class is about something other than the First
Amendment. The flag's man-on-the-street defenders know that
their battle is about something larger than just the flag
itself. And they know that each time the courts, politicians
and press combine to defeat their claims to mainstream
values, civil life in this country somehow ends up more
corrosive and antagonistic.</p>
<p>We agree that there's something preposterous about
amending the Constitution to prohibit flag burning, but no
more preposterous than the mindset of court rulings that make
such lengths necessary. It is in fact a relatively harmless
way of telling the courts and the intelligentsia they have
tilted too far against community standards. A community has
some rights, and a law against burning the very symbol of
community is not a lot to ask.</p>
