	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The U.S. economy continues to show little
luster, with slow growth and steady inflation.
   Friday's economic data gave some cause for optimism. The
Federal Reserve reported that a rebound in auto production
pushed factory output up 0.6% in May. And the Labor
Department said consumer prices rose a modest 0.2% in the
same month.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But in the wake of Wednesday's dismal retail-sales report,
economists say the latest data only confirm that the economy
is stuck in a slow-growth rut.</p>
<p>"Friday's numbers offer some hope that activity in the
manufacturing sector is at the very least stabilizing, and
perhaps improving," said Norman Robertson, chief economist
for Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. "But that comes at a time when
activity in almost every other sector is showing signs of
weakness. Putting it all together, it's very hard to see
anything much better than an economic growth rate in the 1%
to 2% range."</p>
<p>The slow growth in consumer prices during May provided
little reason to fear that inflation is accelerating. But the
report also offered little evidence that the rate of
inflation is coming down.</p>
<p>"Year over year, excluding food and energy, you are still
dealing with 4.8% core inflation," said Lyle Gramley, chief
economist for the Mortgage Bankers' Association and a former
Federal Reserve Board governor. "Inflation has been
contained, but there hasn't been an outright reduction."</p>
<p>Michael Boskin, chairman of the president's Council of
Economic Advisers, said the latest figures are in line with
the administration's expectations. "As we said last year, we
expected the economy to grow more slowly in late '89 and
early '90, and that is indeed what is happening," he said.
The administration believes "the economy will do better in
the second half of this year," Mr. Boskin said.</p>
<p>Privately, administration officials have been hoping the
Federal Reserve would give a boost to the economy by easing
credit and bringing down short-term interest rates. But with
few signs of a recession, and with inflation unchanged, the
Fed is unlikely to change its policy soon. Fed officials say
that before easing, they would like to see convincing
evidence that the inflation rate has started to drop.</p>
<p>"The only way to keep inflation under control is to keep a
tight rein on the economy," said Robert Ortner, former
Commerce Department undersecretary and author of the book
"Voodoo Deficits." Referring to the Fed chairman, he added:
"Alan Greenspan's job is to promote a healthy economy; it is
not to get George Bush re-elected."</p>
<p>May's rise in industrial production followed a month in
which factory output, according to revised estimates, was
unchanged. The Fed initially reported a 0.4% drop in output
in April. Most of the rise in May was in motor vehicles and
parts. Excluding those, production rose only 0.2% from the
previous month.</p>
<p>The rise in production brought the operating rate at the
nation's factories, mines and utilities to 83.6% in May, up
from 83.3% in April.</p>
<p>May's 0.2% rise in consumer prices was the same as April's
increase, but it followed a string of much bigger jumps in
the first three months of this year. Prices in May were 4.4%
above their level during the same 1989 month.</p>
<p>Medical care costs showed the biggest increase in the
month, while prices for gasoline and apparel dropped.
Excluding food and energy prices, which are volatile, prices
rose 0.3% in May.</p>
<p>The Labor Department also reported that the average weekly
earnings of nonsupervisory workers rose 0.3% in May, after
accounting for inflation. That followed a 0.2% rise in April.
During the past year, earnings have fallen a steep 1.8% after
inflation.</p>
