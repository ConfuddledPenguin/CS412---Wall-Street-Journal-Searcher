	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Among British investors being wooed by the New
York Stock Exchange with its plan to trade stocks in the wee
hours, reaction runs the gamut from lukewarm acceptance to
icy opposition.
   Some big investors doubt there will be enough heavy
hitters to provide smooth trading during the graveyard shift.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the plan, continuous trading in Big Board issues
would be conducted by computer after the exchange closes at 4
p.m. Eastern time, which is 9 p.m. London time. The Big Board
said it would begin such trading this year, but hasn't
specified dates. Starting in 1991, it also would let brokers
enter potential trades all night, with computers matching and
executing orders at 8 p.m. (1 a.m. in London), midnight (5
a.m.) and 5 a.m. (10 a.m.).</p>
<p>The plan is designed partly to woo business from London's
International Stock Exchange, where the Seaq International
system trades 49 Big Board issues. The London system recently
has amassed a healthy, but far from enormous, chunk of volume
in Big Board stocks, mostly when the New York market was
closed. Between last February, when London began keeping such
statistics, and the end of May, Seaq International volume in
those stocks totaled 816 million shares -- about one good
week of volume in New York.</p>
<p>The London exchange said Friday that it hadn't any plans
to expand trading hours in response to the Big Board's move.
The London market is open from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., but
Seaq International trades can take place at any time. Few
dealers linger after the close, however.</p>
<p>Investors are concerned about inadequate service in an
after-hours market. "I'm skeptical about how much liquidity
would be provided," Graeme Johnson, a fund manager for
Glasgow-based Scottish Amicable Investment Managers, said.
"Trading should be fairly thin. That would mean wide spreads
and greater volatility. We would reserve judgment as to
whether we'd trade."</p>
<p>Moreover, the Big Board plan seems to overlook the
long-view approach many British investors take. Baillie
Gifford & Co., an Edinburgh-based fund manager, said this is
why it isn't interested in the Big Board's plan. Gavin J.N.
Gemmell, chief pension investments manager, said: "We try to
buy stocks in successful companies and hold them for a long
period. We don't care if we pay an extra eighth {of a point,
or 12.5 cents, for a share}. If we've made the basic decision
right, we're going to make a lot of money, anyway. If you've
got that basic attitude, it doesn't make much sense to come
into the office in the middle of the night."</p>
<p>Even some who cautiously endorsed the idea predicated this
on the after-hours market's attracting enough trading volume
to minimize wild price swings. But they acknowledged that
their reticence could lessen the new market's chances of
success. "We're cautiously positive. The move is a good one,"
Ian Young, U.S. investment manager for Norwich Union
Insurance Group, said. "If the liquidity is there, we're
prepared to use it."</p>
<p>Some investors, while generally opposed to the plan, said
after-hours trading could be a useful tool in emergencies,
such as the October market plunges of 1987 and 1989. "We
certainly wouldn't trade after hours as a matter of course,
but we probably would do it in exceptional circumstances when
quite a lot of dealing has to be done," said Richard A.
Barfield, chief investment manager for Edinburgh-based
Standard Life Assurance Co.</p>
<p>Some London units of Big Board member firms, eager for
more business in a market long bereft of heavy volume,
welcomed the plan. "It must help us. These are serious moves"
by the Big Board, Bernie Leaver, head of equity trading at
Shearson Lehman Hutton International Inc., said. "If that's
the way of the world, we're ready for it."</p>
