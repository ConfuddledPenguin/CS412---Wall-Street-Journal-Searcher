	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Support is growing in Japan for what was once
unthinkable but now may be inevitable: importing rice.
   The first signs of what will likely be a slow, steady
public campaign to accept an end to this nation's 48-year
virtual ban on foreign rice came June 8 when Komeito, an
opposition party often allied with the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party, said it would consider supporting partial
liberalization of rice trade. On June 13, Noboru Takeshita, a
former prime minister who remains a leading LDP power broker,
publicly praised the move as "courageous" and said public
opinion might shift in that direction.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Recent polls have shown strong majorities of the general
public backing such a move, reversing the results of similar
surveys from two years ago.</p>
<p>Top elected officials have yet to openly embrace rice
imports and most still vehemently oppose it. Last week, five
LDP Diet members flew to Washington to try and persuade the
U.S. to drop its demand. Indeed, the positive but
noncommittal stirrings also come at a time when Japan is
trying to navigate through another set of difficult trade
negotiations with the U.S., the Structural Impediments
Initiative talks slated to end by early next month. But in a
nation where shifts in government policy are often carefully
choreographed to create the necessary public opinion, some
Japanese and American officials say a change is underway.
"People living in urban areas cannot understand why we give
subsidies to the farmers who produce rice," said a government
official who supports liberalization. "We should educate
Japanese public opinion to get back to normalcy" in accepting
such a move. He said a "campaign" would start with "political
leaders," and "when the time is right, then we {government
leaders} can come out." He added that "perhaps Mr.
Takeshita's remarks" were the beginning of the drive.</p>
<p>An American Embassy official asserted Friday: "The
decision's been made for quite some time. The Japanese
understand that they're big players in the world trade
environment and they're in an untenable position in insisting
on a total import embargo."</p>
<p>The Japanese government's official policy, submitted in
the ongoing multilateral Uruguay Round of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, says that a country should be
allowed "adjustment measures necessary to maintain its
required domestic production level in basic foodstuffs for
food security considerations." Both the Japanese and American
government officials interviewed said the statement doesn't
necessarily mean support for a continued import ban.</p>
<p>The U.S. is asking Japan to loosen its rice policy as part
of the Uruguay Round, scheduled for completion by the end of
the year. The U.S. is also pressuring Europe to relax
agricultural trade restrictions, and is offering to do the
same if the other countries comply.</p>
<p>Any change in Japan's policy would likely be symbolic,
however, at least at the beginning. Under the U.S. proposal,
countries would first convert agricultural quotas to tariffs,
then phase them out. According to U.S. calculations, Japan's
rice ban is the equivalent of a 700% tariff. If the ban were
replaced with that high a tariff, little rice would be
imported.</p>
<p>Under outside pressure, Japan has over the past decade
taken down many of its formal trade restrictions. But the
U.S., recognizing the political sensitivity, had refrained
until the current GATT talks from pushing on rice, even as it
pried open Japan's beef and citrus markets two years ago. At
that time, the Diet endorsed a resolution, backed by all the
major parties, supporting the no-import rice policy.</p>
<p>Japan has justified the protection of its rice farmers as
preserving cherished symbols of its agrarian heritage, and as
maintaining a policy of "food security" for a nation with new
natural resources. Consumers groups, especially housewives
organizations, have campaigned against rice imports, even
though it means higher prices. They also argue that foreign
rice is unsafe.</p>
<p>(Actually, Japan does allow some importation of rice for
certain rice-based products, like rice crackers. Once,
according to one government official, Japan "borrowed" rice
from Korea during a shortage, then "paid it back" during a
surplus period.)</p>
<p>But the reality is that the number of rice farmers is
dropping drastically, and many who remain do so simply for
tax breaks and government subsidies while holding other
full-time jobs. In the fiscal year ended March 31, per capita
rice consumption dropped 1.6%, the fourth consecutive annual
decline.</p>
