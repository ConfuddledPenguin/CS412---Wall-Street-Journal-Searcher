	<p class="article-leader">ROME -- Italy's unadjusted index of industrial production
rose 1% in April from a year earlier, the state statistical
institute Istat said.
   Istat said the index, on which 1985 equals 100, registered
116.0 in April, compared with 114.9 in April 1989.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The index was based on 19 working days in April, the same
as in April 1989.</p>
<p>The increase in April followed a year-on-year rise of 2.8%
in March.</p>
<p>Industrial production in the first four months, which had
a total of 83 working days, rose an average of 2.1% from the
year-earlier period, which had 82 working days.</p>
<p>In the first four months, production of capital goods rose
5.9% from a year earlier. Production of consumer goods was up
1.2%, while output of intermediate goods was up 1.5%.</p>
<p>The increase in capital goods was due to an 8.5% rise in
the production of transportation goods, a rise of 5.9% in the
production of machinery and equipment and a drop of 1.6% in
the production of other goods.</p>
