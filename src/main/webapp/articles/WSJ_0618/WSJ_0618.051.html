	<p class="article-leader">SAN DIEGO -- Wahlco Environmental Systems Inc. canceled
plans for a $50 million offering of convertible subordinated
debentures and said delays in orders for its core product
could reduce 1990 earnings by about 10 cents a share from
previous expectations.
   The maker of air-pollution control systems for utilities
said it withdrew the offering because of its eroding stock
price, which has fallen from a record $16.625 late last
month. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
Wahlco dropped $2.75 a share to $10.375.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company didn't disclose what its previous earnings
expectations were, but it said it is comfortable with
analysts' current expectations of 70 to 75 cents a share for
the year. Last year, Wahlco had net income of $10.4 million
on revenue of $40.6 million. The company, which has about
17.6 million shares outstanding, didn't report per-share
results for last year because it didn't go public until
April.</p>
<p>Wahlco blamed the drop in anticipated earnings on delays
in several orders for its flue gas conditioning systems. Of
particular significance, analysts said, was the delay of a $6
million order by a U.K. concern. Wahlco said it hasn't
received contract cancellations from its customers.</p>
<p>Wahlco said it believes clients are delaying their orders
until the Clean Air Act is completed by Congress, probably
later this year, and that the earnings lost this year "should
be realized" in 1991.</p>
