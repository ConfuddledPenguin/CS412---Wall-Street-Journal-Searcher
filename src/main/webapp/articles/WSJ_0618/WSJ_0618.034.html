	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo stock prices finished lower in light trading Friday
on index-linked selling in the last half hour of trading.
   The Nikkei index of 225 issues, which advanced 296.34
points Thursday, was down 129.71 points at 32538.40.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>London shares were moderately lower.</p>
<p>Tokyo stock prices moved in a narrow range most of the
day, as investors remained on the sidelines ahead of releases
of U.S. economic indicators later Friday, traders said.</p>
<p>Investors picked up laggards among pharmaceutical,
machinery and food sectors as well as small-capitalization
second-section stocks. Shipbuilding, construction and
electrical shares, meanwhile, ended mostly lower.</p>
<p>In early trading in Tokyo Monday, the Nikkei index rose
88.85 points to 32627.25.</p>
<p>Friday's volume on the first section was estimated at 450
million shares, in line with 456.2 million Thursday.</p>
<p>Declining issues outnumbered advancing issues 477-443,
while 198 remained unchanged.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section, which gained 21.56 points Thursday, was down
3.65 points, or 0.15%, at 2396.32.</p>
<p>The second section index gained for the fourth consecutive
day. The index, which advanced 19.87 points Thursday, was up
47.61 points, or 1.16%, to close at 4153.60.</p>
<p>Volume in the second section was estimated at 33 million
shares, up from 26.7 million Thursday.</p>
<p>"The first section trading was lackluster," said Shigeru
Akima, head of equity trading at UBS Phillips & Drew
International. "Little money is coming into the section, and
investors are passing off the time by trading in small-cap
stocks on the second section with bright earnings outlooks,"
he said.</p>
<p>In addition to the second-section stocks, traders said,
high-priced shares on the Osaka and Nagoya stock exchanges
advanced strongly, drawing buy orders from investors going
after these smaller stocks that often move up significantly
on relatively small amounts of buying.</p>
<p>Trading in large-capitalization shares on the first
section requires encouraging factors such as a sign of lower
interest rates, traders said.</p>
<p>Even a favorable market "mood" such as expecting the yen's
rise or interest rates to fall would be helpful, said Atsushi
Koishihara, general manager of stock trading at Taiheiyo
Securities. "Everybody is waiting to see such a cue," he
said.</p>
<p>Expectations of lower U.S. interest rates grew last week,
triggered by Wednesday's report of unexpectedly low U.S.
retail sales for May and fueled by Thursday's remarks by U.S.
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan that U.S.
interest rates will fall "very significantly" if a credible
budget-deficit reduction accord is reached.</p>
<p>"But after all, investors are unable to tell which way
rates are heading," said a senior trader at Dai-Ichi
Securities.</p>
<p>Traders predicted that stock trading for this week will
depend largely on how the foreign exchange market reacts to
the latest U.S. economic data.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical shares, which had been lagging in recent
weeks, bounced back Friday as investors shifted their
attention from shipbuilding and electrical shares, both of
which had been traded actively earlier in the week, traders
said.</p>
<p>Dainippon Pharmaceutical went up 400 yen ($2.59) a share
to 3,210 yen, Mochida gained 80 to 3,950, and Daiichi
Pharmaceutical rose 100 to 2,500.</p>
<p>Also higher were retail issues such as Isetan, which
advanced 120 to 4,480, textile shares such as Kurabo, which
increased 52 to 1,000, and Kuraray, which was up 60 at 1,550.</p>
<p>Shipbuilding and steel shares advanced through midday but
ended lower on late profit-taking, traders said.</p>
<p>Electrical stocks also softened. Sony dropped 60 to 8,510,
while Sharp declined 20 to 1,880.</p>
<p>London share prices finished a sluggish session moderately
lower amid disappointment over the latest U.S. and U.K.
economic figures and a soggy early performance on Wall
Street.</p>
<p>Traders termed the session frustrating, as many had
awaited the outcome of the U.K. data for most of the week as
well as a slew of U.S. figures.</p>
<p>But the indicators caused little stir in the market, with
many traders closing their books early for the weekend.
"There was such a great buildup to Friday that we thought
we'd see some action," said one trader. "But it just didn't
happen."</p>
<p>U.K. inflation figures for May showed that the retail
price index rose 0.9% from April and was up 9.7% on a
year-on-year basis, compared with expectations of a 9.5%
increase.</p>
<p>At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index was down 10.7 points at 2392.3, up from its
midafternoon low of 2387.4 but well below the early morning
peak of 2414.4.</p>
<p>The final calculation of the narrower FT-30 share index
showed a 2.7-point drop to 1925.9. Volume amounted to a
modest 400.2 million shares, compared with 554.2 million
Thursday.</p>
<p>Reuters shares chalked up the largest advance on the day,
surging 44 pence (75 cents) to #12.94 ($22.10). Dealers
suggested a stock shortage forced the price higher, while
talk also circulated that the company will win the contract
to provide the electronic dealing system for the American
Stock Exchange in New York.</p>
<p>Polly Peck surged 16 to 435 after a series of bullish
presentations to analysts in the U.S., dealers said.</p>
<p>Securities house Smith New Court reported pretax profit
for the year to April 27 rose 115% from year-earlier levels.
Its shares finished 5 higher at 106.</p>
<p>Employment services concern Manpower, formerly known as
Blue Arrow, slipped 1 to 86 after reporting six-month interim
pretax profit down 14%. The results were worse than expected,
analysts said.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, share prices closed lower in Paris, Brussels,
Amsterdam, Milan and Madrid. Prices were mixed in Frankfurt,
Zurich and Stockholm. South African gold stocks closed lower.</p>
<p>Share prices closed lower in Sydney, Taipei and Seoul and
higher in Manila, Wellington, Singapore and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.</p>
