	<p class="article-leader">FLINT, Mich. -- Action Auto Stores Inc. said it has
voluntarily filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter
11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code "in order to continue the
company's restructuring and consolidation program."
   C. James Sabo, chairman and chief executive officer of the
auto-parts retailer, said: "We regret having to take this
action, but we believe that it was absolutely necessary for
the overall well-being of the company."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Chapter 11 protects a company from creditor lawsuits while
it works out a plan to repay debt. A spokesman said the
company filed under Chapter 11 after taking an "assessment of
our financial situation." He declined to be more specific.</p>
<p>In reaction to recent quarterly losses, Action Auto in
March said it started a cost-cutting program, obtained a $9
million secured line of credit from its bank and modified its
agreement with another lender.</p>
<p>Mr. Sabo said that the Chapter 11 filing shouldn't affect
the efforts under way by the investment banking firm of
PaineWebber Inc. to restructure the company.</p>
