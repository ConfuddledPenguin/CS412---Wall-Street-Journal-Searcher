	<p class="article-leader">All of us, from time to time, think nostalgically about
reliving at least part of our childhood. But then we remember
our introduction to algebra and "word problems." If you
haven't quit reading yet, stick with me -- it might be
important to your financial well-being.
   For example, here are a couple of word problems anyone
contemplating retirement ought to learn how to solve. You
estimate that you must accumulate $600,000 of investable
funds by age 65, just seven years from now. How much must you
deposit at the end of each year in an account that pays 8%
tax-free to reach that goal?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>You also have decided that you do not wish to leave an
estate and you believe you will live 13 years after you
retire. (That is one actuarial estimate for a 65-year-old
male.) If you want a monthly income of $7,000 over your
retired lifetime, at what annual rate of return must your
nest egg be invested?</p>
<p>Such are the tense relationships between money and
investing that Michael Thomsett considers ever so gently in
his new book, "The Mathematics of Investing" (John Wiley, 244
pages, $29.95). Mr. Thomsett starts by reviewing the basic
ideas of the time value of money, illustrating them with
simple examples. He then moves on to more complicated
problems so that within an hour you could easily manage the
answers to the two questions posed above (and if you can't,
keep reading).</p>
<p>Two forces are certain to play an important role for
anyone considering retirement-taxes and inflation. Mr.
Thomsett has a brief chapter on how to include the effects of
those facts of life on any investment. The material presented
is not detailed, but should encourage you to include them in
your planning. Another chapter gives the math that should be
known by anyone who buys bonds. With the junk-bond market in
the tank many savvy investors now are trying to pick up a few
bonds that bark like Dalmatians.</p>
<p>On the surface, investing in the bond market looks simple.
And it is, if you only compute the current yield -- the
stated interest rate for the bond divided by its cost.
(That's the calculation this newspaper makes in its New York
and American bond listings.) But Mr. Thomsett shows how to
figure out approximately a bond's yield-to-maturity that
takes into account if it is purchased at a premium or a
discount to its face value. That approximation should be good
enough for most people who have not been convicted of
shenanigans in the junk-bond market. This book is elementary
and so it won't turn you into a financial wizard, but it will
help you find answers to some key questions involving money.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>But suppose you already understand how to use the simpler
mathematical relationships that govern money and investing.
Then you might be ready for the book by Stephen Brown and
Mark Kritzman, "Quantitative Methods for Financial Analysis"
(Dow Jones-Irwin, 266 pages, $42.50). This is the second
edition of this book and is required reading for candidates
for chartered financial analyst certification. However, that
doesn't mean others shouldn't consider owning it.</p>
<p>Besides covering nearly all the techniques described in
Mr. Thomsett's book, "Methods" goes considerably further. For
example, it applies mathematical techniques to real estate
investments, option and futures instruments and asset
allocation. It even has a section on "closet indexing" that
can be cheerfully discussed without embarrassment in mixed
company. And for those of you who have forgotten what you
learned in Statistics 101 and/or managed to avoid
successfully finding out whether your roommate was a standard
deviation, the book has an appendix on the principles of
statistics.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>But suppose you have no interest in learning about the
mathematics of finance but just want to reduce the amount of
money you are going to have to pay back on your mortgage. For
you Marc Eisenson has written "The Banker's Secret" (Villard
Books, 256 pages, $14.95). He has managed to put his own time
to good use, generating an entire book out of a simple
application of time value of money principles. This book
makes a big deal out of how a homeowner who pays an
additional $25 a month on his mortgage would save more than
$34,000 in interest and shorten a 30-year loan by more than
five years. It includes copious mortgage tables and schedules
to guide you through the calculations required to find your
savings. A homeowner interested in reducing his total
financial outlay on his house might be better off: (1)
applying the cost of this book to the principal he owes on
his house, and (2) then learning to solve all kinds of time
value of money problems by purchasing either of the first two
books reviewed in this column.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>And now for the envelope, please. The way I figure, you
must deposit $67,243 in the account annually to accumulate
$600,000 and your nest egg must be invested at 10.3% for you
to receive a monthly income of $7,000.</p>
