	<p class="article-leader">The Justice Department is investigating one of the most
controversial offshoots of airline deregulation -- the
domination of major airports by one or two large airlines.
   A department spokesman confirmed that the agency is in the
preliminary stages of a broad inquiry into possible antitrust
violations in these markets. As an initial step in the probe,
federal prosecutors asked USAir Inc. to supply information
about how gates will be allocated at a new terminal at
Greater Pittsburgh International Airport.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A Justice Department spokesman said the agency wants,
among other things, to find out if arrangements between the
airport and USAir could make it harder for other airlines to
start service in Pittsburgh. The unit of Arlington, Va.-based
USAir Group Inc. already controls 81% of the market in
Pittsburgh, measured by the number of passengers carried.
Including its commuter airline affiliate, USAir has an 87%
market share. USAir denies any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>The USAir investigation, first reported last Friday by the
Pittsburgh Post Gazette, is part of a broader federal probe,
said Joseph Krovisky, a Justice Department spokesman. He
declined to identify the other airlines or airports under
scrutiny. A number of major carriers, including NWA Inc.'s
Northwest Airlines, Delta Air Lines Inc. and UAL Corp.'s
United Airlines, said they hadn't been contacted by the
Justice Department in connection with this investigation.</p>
<p>The trend toward the building of "fortress hubs" by major
carriers has been a controversial one in recent years. The
wave of airline mergers in the 1980s left some airports with
little open competition. In cities like Pittsburgh,
Minneapolis, Detroit and St. Louis, a single carrier now
controls nearly all the business. At others, only two
airlines share most of the business.</p>
<p>A study by the General Accounting Office, Congress's
investigative arm, found that ticket prices at these airports
have risen faster than elsewhere. The average one-way fare
between Pittsburgh and New York, for instance, has risen 70%
to $90.28 in 1988 from $52.98 in 1984.</p>
<p>The USAir investigation, which is "in the preliminary
stages," is separate from a continuing Justice Department
probe of possible ticket price-fixing by major airlines, the
spokesman said. The price-fixing investigation targets AMR
Corp.'s American Airlines, among other carriers, although the
Justice Department has never formally confirmed which
companies are under scrutiny.</p>
<p>"Justice Department has turned up the heat," said William
E. Kovacic, a former antitrust attorney at the Federal Trade
Commission. "We've seen the {amount of} activity pick up."</p>
<p>The agency's concern about market domination at certain
airports dates back to the mid-1980s when it opposed big
mergers such as Trans World Airlines -- Northwest-Republic.
But the Transportation Department, which had final authority
over the mergers, approved the transactions. At the time,
airlines and officials of the Transportation Department
reasoned that competition between airports was a more
important consideration than what would happen in individual
markets. They also decided that the threat of new competition
would force carriers to hold down fares in their home
markets.</p>
<p>But now there is concern about whether or not carriers are
taking steps to keep new competitors off their turf. For
instance, the agreements under investigation in Pittsburgh
would allow USAir to control 50 of the 75 gates at the new
terminal. This "may limit the entry of new competitors into
the Pittsburgh market," in violation of federal prohibitions
on restraint of trade and attempted monopolization, the
Justice Department spokesman said.</p>
<p>The issue of market domination also was raised last year,
when the Justice Department threatened to file a civil
lawsuit to block the sale of Philadelphia gates and other
assets owned by Eastern Air Lines Inc., a unit of Continental
Airlines Holding Inc., to USAir, which is the largest carrier
in Philadelphia. Midway Airlines Inc., a new entrant in the
market, got the okay instead. Two years ago, the Justice
Department asked United Airlines for information about the
control of takeoff and landing slots at Chicago's O'Hare
International Airport. In that case, which is still under
review, the agency is concerned that the way slots are
acquired could restrict competition.</p>
<p>The latest investigation came to light when USAir
disclosed it in documents related to the issuance of about
$85 million in revenue bonds for the Pittsburgh airport
expansion.</p>
<p>The Justice Department has sent USAir formal requests for
documents on its activities at the Pittsburgh airport. The
requests, known as civil investigatory demands, are the civil
equivalent of criminal subpoenas. They ask for a broad range
of documents and data related to possible antitrust
violations.</p>
<p>"Nobody has accused USAir of anything," says a spokesman
for the carrier. The airline says it believes its agreements
with airport authorities won't prevent increased competition
at Pittsburgh and aren't designed to do so.</p>
<p>Herb Hovenkamp, an antitrust attorney at the University of
Iowa, considers the Justice Department's series of
investigations into the airline industry "a silent
recognition that one important aspect of the Reagan era's
antitrust policy didn't work very well."</p>
<p>"I think they believe that the error of indulgence toward
mergers was most serious toward the airline industry," says
Mr. Hovenkamp.</p>
<p>The Justice Department's investigation of major airport
dominance by one or two big carriers reflects the Bush
administration's stepped-up concern about antitrust
enforcement, especially in the airline industry. In contrast,
the Reagan administration took a generally lenient approach
toward mergers among rivals and allowed three major airline
combinations, which significantly increased the market power
of the surviving carriers.</p>
<p>Although he hasn't blocked any notable mergers, President
Bush's chief antitrust enforcer, James Rill, has talked tough
about increased federal scrutiny. He has launched
investigations in a number of industries, including airlines,
health-care and higher education, reminding corporate America
that the antitrust laws aren't dead.</p>
<p>Mr. Rill, an assistant attorney general, has indicated
personal concern about single-carrier domination at key
airports resulting in higher ticket prices. During a recent
interview, he pointed out that an internal Justice Department
"discussion paper" had concluded that two recent airline
mergers had resulted in higher prices at major airports.</p>
<p>Specifically, the document concluded that the merger of
TWA and Ozark "appears to have caused a slight increase in
fares and a far greater reduction in service" out of the St.
Louis airport. The paper also concluded that the merger of
Northwest and Republic "appears to have caused a significant
increase in fares and a significant reduction in overall
service" out of the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport.</p>
