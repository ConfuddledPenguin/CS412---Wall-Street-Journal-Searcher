	<p class="article-leader">PEORIA, Ill. -- When George A. Schaefer assumed the reins
at Caterpillar Inc. in 1985, Japan's Komatsu Ltd. was on the
move in the construction-equipment industry. It opened a
plant in Tennessee and vowed to wrest market share from the
industry leader.
   Caterpillar pounced back with a plan to virtually remake
its factories: PWAF, for Plant With a Future. The $2 billion
project, coupled with the restraining of price increases,
helped Caterpillar retain its No. 1 position among global
construction equipment companies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But that didn't help profits. In Mr. Schaefer's five years
as chairman and chief executive officer, profit went on a
roller-coaster ride of up, down, up, up and down. Although
Caterpillar says the PWAF payoff will start this year, Mr.
Schaefer won't be around to see it.</p>
<p>After 39 years at the company, his long-planned retirement
starts July 1, at age 62. Before leaving, he shared his views
about everything from the competition to his wife's critique
of his office decor.</p>
<p>Q: Have you learned anything from Komatsu?</p>
<p>A: We used to be not overly concerned about Komatsu. That
all changed radically as we moved through the early part of
the '80s and we started to see erosion of our historic market
shares, particularly in North America.</p>
<p>So I can tell you today that we know all we can legally
know about our friends from Japan. We read everything that's
published. We digest it. We look over their shoulders from
our vantage point in Tokyo, as I'm sure they do from their
vantage point in Peoria. They have a plant right here in
Peoria.</p>
<p>Q: Are you saying you spy on them?</p>
<p>A: No, I wouldn't say that. We know everything we can
legally know, but we sure don't spy on them. We know they've
had excellent quality. We know they've had a determination to
prevail and grow in this industry. And we know that they are
long-term players. They absolutely are not concerned about
next quarter's profit. They're concerned about market share
and long term.</p>
<p>For us to maintain the lead in the industry we have to
excel in those areas. That's the reason we aren't the
favorite around Wall Street, although recently the stock has
been moving pretty well considering the earnings pressure
we're under.</p>
<p>Q: Have you felt it was unfair to demand of Caterpillar or
George Schaefer better short-term results?</p>
<p>A: You can look at that from two different vantage points.
When we sit down with our pension fund managers, we say,
"Well come on, where were you {in performance} last quarter?"
There, we're kind of talking short-term.</p>
<p>If you look at our situation, we're kind of saying, we
have to be long-term players, or we're not going to be
around.</p>
<p>I don't think it's unfair. We are making the right
long-term judgments, and if people want to take us to task
for doing that, that's their prerogative.</p>
<p>Q: Why is market share so important?</p>
<p>A: For us to take a less aggressive stance vis-a-vis
market share means that we lose that long-term stream of
parts and service. Parts are more profitable than prime
product or machines. It's really like the razor blade
business, when you get right down to it.</p>
<p>Q: Why did the cost of your plant modernization program
increase so much over your original projection?</p>
<p>A: We had an overall blueprint within our own company, but
there was no case study or textbook. We are doing something
very unique in a major manufacturing company. We are
simultaneously restructuring world-wide our manufacturing
processes from A to Z, and it's a gigantic undertaking. We
are 60% to 65% along, but it has cost more to get there, and
it has taken longer than we thought.</p>
<p>Q: Is there a peace dividend for Caterpillar?</p>
<p>A: We're already seeing some results, faster than we
thought. We recently took our West German dealer and gave him
the East German dealership. And we've sold over 100 machines
in East Germany this year. And I think that's just a start.</p>
<p>Granted, all these Eastern Bloc countries need the
wherewithal to pay for all this stuff. But you'll see
increasing evidence of the Western countries, Japan and
others willing to make some of the funds available.</p>
<p>Q: Are we losing ground to foreign competitors in
manufacturing?</p>
<p>A: There isn't any question we were losing ground in the
early '80s, but we've got it stabilized. The advent of the
world-wide competitive situation is making management
everywhere -- not only the U.S.smarter. It's caused us to do
a better job.</p>
<p>Q: Will your domestic work force change in the 1990s?</p>
<p>A: There's no question. And it will even accelerate
because a lot of these jobs in the plants are being
reoriented to higher-skilled jobs. Running major complexes
with computer assistance means we've got to have
higher-skilled people on those things. We're doing a lot of
training, and a lot of the menial jobs of the past are gone.</p>
<p>Q: Why aren't there more women executives at Caterpillar
today?</p>
<p>A: It's probably just a function of the industry we're in.
There just aren't that many women engineers. We are seeing
upward movement in some of the other areas -- financial,
specifically. We do recently have a lady running our service
tool company, which is a pretty substantial ancillary. But
the base that we've drawn from has not been there
historically.</p>
<p>Q: Your successor, Donald Fites, has reorganized the
company into profit units. Does this mean the company will be
focusing more on short-term profit than it has in the past?</p>
<p>A: The tendency will be there to focus more on the short
term because the heads of these profit centers will be
challenged to meet their business plan. As they find they're
having difficulty, they may want to take short-term actions
as the year {goes on}. Therein is the challenge of what we
call the executive office, to make sure that the long-term
interests are being tended to.</p>
<p>Q: Will this mean Caterpillar managers will be worrying
about their jobs more?</p>
<p>A: In a word, yes.</p>
<p>The guy that runs that business unit is totally
responsible for product, for design, for engineering, for
manufacturing, for pricing, for everything. And he's got his
target, which is the bottom line of his business unit. And a
fair amount of his compensation will eventually be determined
by how well he meets or exceeds or falls short of that
target. That's never been in our approach.</p>
<p>Q: Can a top executive at an American corporation also be
a good parent?</p>
<p>A: I think so, but he or she better be very, very specific
in allocating their time and prioritizing their time.
Fortunately, our children were in the formative stages,
through the later grade school and high school, when I was
much less active -- when I was plant manager in Decatur
{Ill.}, for example. I spent a lot of time with my children.
If I had teen-age children and I was a CEO, I would have a
problem trying to find the time they really need -- and
should have.</p>
<p>Q: Will you miss this job?</p>
<p>A: I'll miss all the fancy ability to pick up the phone
and ask for something. But I tell you, the demands that are
there are such that I'm going to relish some time to reflect
and do some things at a slower pace.
</p>
<p>Q: Who gets this big corner office?</p>
<p>A: Well, the best office in the place is the one that Don
{Fites} already is in. I don't care where I'm at. I really
don't. My wife thinks this is a terribly poorly decorated
office, and it is.</p>
<p>Q: What doesn't your wife like about it?</p>
<p>A: She doesn't think things go together very well. I don't
care about any of that kind of stuff. I'm different, I guess.</p>
