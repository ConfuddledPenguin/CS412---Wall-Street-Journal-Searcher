	<p class="article-leader">Saab-Scania AB said Friday its pretax profit in the first
four months surged 27% to 817 million kronor ($133.9 million)
from 642 million kronor in the corresponding period a year
ago.
   The Swedish aerospace and automotive group said
consolidated sales rose by 11% to 10.2 billion kronor from
9.2 billion. Consolidated income before appropriations and
taxes was 2.52 billion kronor, compared with 642 million in
the first four months last year. The increase reflects 1.7
billion kronor from the sale of 50% of Saab's profit-losing
car operations to General Motors Corp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Saab's pretax profit in the first four months was about

<p>Among business areas, Saab Aircraft reported a 74% surge
in sales to 1.65 billion kronor from 951 million, propelled
by the success of its turboprop commuter planes, Saab 340 and
Saab 2000.</p>
<p>The car division, Saab Automobile, owned jointly by Saab
and GM, which started operations Jan. 1, reported a
995-million-krona loss in the first four months.</p>
