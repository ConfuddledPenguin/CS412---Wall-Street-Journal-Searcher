	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Chrysler Corp. will soon get help selling its
vehicles from an unlikely ally -- Honda Motor Co.
   Honda, the target of a recent Chrysler advertising
campaign, said it agreed to help the No. 3 U.S. auto maker
sell its Jeep Cherokee and Wrangler models in Japan beginning
this fall.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Honda said it plans to sell 2,000 Jeep models in 1991.
Chrysler sold only 1,500 cars and Jeeps in Japan last year.</p>
<p>Honda and Chrysler officials previously disclosed they
were negotiating a distribution agreement, but details
weren't announced until Friday.</p>
<p>A Chrysler spokeswoman said there is "potential for
discussion about Honda distribution of other Chrysler
vehicles" but declined to elaborate.</p>
<p>Honda, which doesn't build off-road vehicles or minivans,
said it entered into the agreement to help broaden its appeal
in the Japanese market. A Honda spokesman said the Chrysler
ad campaign that claims Chrysler models are superior to
Honda's Civic and Accord never deterred the Japanese company
from going ahead with the marketing alliance.</p>
<p>"This agreement is not a matter of helping anybody; it's a
matter of Honda dealers expanding sales," the Honda spokesman
said.</p>
<p>Honda said it will sell and service Chrysler vehicles
through its 1,375-dealer Primo chain.</p>
