exposure to deteriorating real estate markets. The ratings
concern said it lowered its rating on HomeFed Bank's
subordinated debt to triple-B-minus from triple-B-plus. It
lowered its rating on the thrift's long-term certificates of
deposit to triple-B from single-A-minus. It affirmed at
single-A-2 its ratings on the bank's commercial paper and
short-term certificates of deposit. HomeFed officials
couldn't be reached for comment.

	<div class="article-body"><p>PHILADELPHIA -- Citing a chronic fiscal imbalance,
Standard & Poor's Corp. lowered its rating on $1.3 billion of
Philadelphia general obligation bonds to Triple-B-minus from
Triple-B-plus. The rating agency cited the city's inability
to erase its deficit, which is expected to reach $60 million
for the year ending June 30. It would be the city's third
consecutive deficit and next fiscal year's budget also has a
likelihood of an imbalance, S&P said. Other issues downgraded
to Triple-B-minus from Triple-B-plus include $9 million
issued by the Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority, $6
million issued by the Philadelphia Parking Authority, and
$7.6 million issued by the Philadelphia Parking Authority. A
final rating is still pending on the March 1990 offering of
$148 million of variable rate general obligations, backed by
a letter of credit by Fuji Bank. S&P said Philadelphia's
financial outlook for fiscal 1991 is not expected to improve.
A recent court stipulation will require the city to provide
an additional $32 million for child welfare. The city also
may be required by court order to refund an additional $25
million in real estate transfer tax collections that were
declared illegal a year ago. S&P also anticipates the city
having to pay $20 million in labor arbitration settlements
and an indeterminate amount in court costs.</p>

<p>RELIANCE GROUP HOLDINGS Inc. (New York) -- Standard &
Poor's Corp. said it raised its ratings on this insurance and
financial holding company's senior debt to double-B from
single-B-plus and on subordinated debt to single-B-plus from
single-B-minus. The rating concern affirmed its ratings on
debt of related entities, including Reliance Group Inc.,
Reliance Financial Services Corp., and Reliance Insurance Co.
About $1.2 billion in debt was affected. S&P noted that
Reliance Group Holdings continues to show improved financial
leverage, augmented by a large capital gain from the sale of
an insurance unit in April, and that it expects the trend of
improved financial leverage to continue. But S&P lowered to
triple-B-plus from single-A its rating on the claims-paying
ability of United Pacific Life Insurance Co., which S&P said
has a "significant tolerance for single-issue concentrations
in its large high-yield portfolio."</p>
