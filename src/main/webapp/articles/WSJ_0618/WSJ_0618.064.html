	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- When Sir Kit McMahon took the helm at Midland
Bank PLC three years ago, his mission was to straighten out
Britain's most troubled major financial institution. It
increasingly looks like a mission impossible.
   Midland, Britain's third-largest bank, seems to be
slipping backward rather than turning around. Costs are
rising, earnings are declining and finding new business is
growing harder in a saturated market. The situation raises
questions about Midland's future and clouds prospects for its
long-expected combination with Hongkong & Shanghai Banking
Corp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Though Sir Kit has shaken some of tradition-bound
Midland's complacency, he and his team haven't rectified
Midland's core problems: a fatter cost base, a worsening
bad-debt portfolio and poorer-yielding assets than its major
U.K. competitors. After bad-debt write-offs, Midland has
spent two of the past three years in the red, and probably
would face another if it could afford to raise reserves for
soured international loans to competitors' levels. With the
economic climate worsening at home, Sir Kit has been warning
that earnings are running below last year's slackened pace.
If the trend continues, and many analysts say it will, Sir
Kit's management will have produced lower operating earnings
for two consecutive years -- half the time he's been in
command. (Midland releases first-half results Aug. 2.)</p>
<p>"There's disappointment" among investors with Midland's
lack of progress, says Gary Mairs, analyst and fund manager
at Scottish Amicable Investment Managers in Glasgow, a
Midland institutional holder. Sir Kit's team hasn't "achieved
what the market was expecting." Salomon Brothers analyst
Stephen Lewis, son of a Midland banker and a former employee
himself, says Midland "is in the weakest position" of
Britain's major banks. "They really haven't got the financial
resources" to compete in the longer term.</p>
<p>Against that backdrop, bankers and customers in London and
Hong Kong are asking whether the transaction that was
expected to resolve Midland's capital problems and transform
its future -- a merger with or friendly acquisition by larger
Hongkong Bank -- will occur this year or next, if at all.
Such a combination would create the world's ninth-largest
bank; its nearly $240 billion in assets would make it
slightly bigger than Citicorp.</p>
<p>Merger talks began in late 1987 when Hongkong Bank
acquired a 14.9% Midland stake. Those discussions had been
expected to produce closer links by this December, when
Hongkong Bank is freed from an accord freezing its stake. But
Midland's recent problems, coupled with smaller-scale
uncertainties at Hongkong Bank, have raised doubts that the
move will happen so quickly.</p>
<p>In an interview, Sir Kit says "tactical" problems have
cropped up at both banks, but he adds the merger strategy
remains unchanged. Hongkong Bank Deputy Chairman John Gray
echoes the view. "The concern that has been expressed by Sir
Kit {about Midland's current profit outlook} we would have to
share," says Mr. Gray. But "the relationship is going pretty
well." He points to several hundred million pounds in
referred business shared by the banks and to the successful
swap of certain Midland Far Eastern assets for Hongkong Bank
European branches. "Conceptually {a combination} has to make
sense," says Mr. Gray. Neither he nor Sir Kit will talk about
a timetable.</p>
<p>However, Midland's darkening outlook weakens Sir Kit's
bargaining power on jobs, management power and price. Even if
the banks do combine, they still will face deep problems.</p>
<p>Sir Kit, a former central banker and academic, brought a
new style to Midland, but acknowledges he has found the going
tougher than expected. "Certainly a lot of people expected it
to produce change quicker than it has, and maybe we incited
their expectations too much," says Sir Kit. "In many ways we
set out explicitly to change the culture." That, he adds, "is
a hazardous and difficult thing to do, which leads to
accidents as well as successes."</p>
<p>Though Britain's inflation-infested economy is hurting
many banks, Midland suffers from a combination of troubles
all its own. Just 45 years ago, Midland was the world's
biggest bank. But its failure to modernize and diversify from
its base in Britain's rusting industrial heartland caused the
bank to slide several dozen places. When Midland finally
expanded overseas, it moved recklessly and accumulated
billions of dollars in losses from Third World debt and its
Crocker Bank acquisition in the U.S.</p>
<p>Sir Kit has shuffled a dozen senior managers and
directors, but the team still looks like the gang that
couldn't shoot straight. Though Sir Kit came in wielding a
cost-cutter's knife, Midland's operating costs have risen
steadily. Cutting salaries and closing branches has proven
difficult; indeed, staff compensation rose 11% last year to
#1.19 billion ($2.03 billion). As a result, Midland has
failed to lower its cost-to-income ratio, which rose slightly
last year to 72.4%, the highest among major British banks and
well above U.S. averages.</p>
<p>Part of the cost growth is due to back-office investment.
H. Eugene Lockhart, an abrasive former consultant now in
charge of Midland's U.K. banking, says 13 regional
"processing factories" are handling more of Midland's
clearing business and are already saving money. But he says
significant improvement in cost ratios depends less on
cutting costs than drumming up new business.</p>
<p>To do that, Midland has embarked on an ambitious and
costly strategy to market its products as brands, like candy
or cigarettes. But it's still far from clear how much
customers appreciate the effort. The most unconventional
campaign is a series of surreal advertisements for a
telephone-banking service, called First Direct, which has
British tongues wagging -- some with ridicule. Sir Kit says
the ads have grabbed attention, and he cites a high product
awareness among target consumers.</p>
<p>Less pleasing was Midland's #116 million loss in a
money-market division last year. Senior asset managers
incorrectly anticipated a fall in U.K. interest rates; when
those rates rose, Midland took a big hit on its money-market
positions. Midland expects a similar-scale loss this year as
the position unwinds.</p>
<p>Richard Delbridge, who became finance director in the
aftermath of the loss, says the loss "could happen to any
bank," but adds "we wouldn't take that size position again."
In an unrelated -- but some say analogous -- management
mix-up earlier in Sir Kit's tenure, Midland staged an
embarrassing flip-flop in its accounting practices related to
bad-debt write-offs.</p>
<p>The search for an explanation for such blunders often
comes back to Sir Kit. Though peers give the 62-year-old
Australian high marks for intellect and charm, he is
sometimes aloof and is considered to give subordinates too
much freedom.</p>
<p>Counters Sir Kit: "If you don't let people do what they
can, you don't get the best out of them. But then they
sometimes make mistakes." He says Midland, which continues to
spend heavily on new technology and marketing, is on track to
emerge leaner and more profitable. "By five years from now
there will be quite a change."</p>
