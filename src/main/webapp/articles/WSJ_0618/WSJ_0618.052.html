	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Trade barriers notwithstanding, 80 of the 100
largest foreign-affiliated companies (FACs) entered Japan
before 1975. Today these companies are confronted with a
serious form of mid-life crisis: They have to reinvigorate,
even reinvent, themselves because the sources of their early
advantage are much harder to find and to sustain.
   FACs represent a considerable body of economic activity in
Japan. In 1987, foreign industrial presence here, most of it
U.S.-related, amounted to roughly $300 billion, or about 13%
of Japan's GNP. Of the approximately 450,000 people employed
by FACs in Japan, some three-quarters work for U.S.
companies. This activity is also fairly concentrated. Four
industries -- oil, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and medical
and office equipment -- account for some 60% of sales, and in
each, FACs have achieved industry penetration greater than
10%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>More than 60 of the top 100 FACs established and
consolidated their initial positions on a foundation of
clear-cut technological advantage. But the remaining 40 got
in a different way. Most established themselves by bringing a
completely new product or business concept to Japan.</p>
<p>With fast-foods, the key was to transfer a product or
service concept from elsewhere -- usually the U.S. -- to
Japan before the local market had begun (e.g., McDonald's,
Nestle, Kentucky Fried Chicken), and to create a strong and
defensible position before local competitors could react.
Coca-Cola seized an opportunity by end-running the
established distribution system and rapidly signing up
top-quality bottlers. It then spent five years training the
bottlers, despite their strong opposition, in Coca-Cola's
route sales approach.</p>
<p>In these cases, the company introduced a concept new to
Japan and modified it to meet local market needs. This
appears obvious. Not so. How many companies would invest in
building a hamburger chain when all the available market
research says that no one in the target market eats
hamburgers? It's easy to say, with the shoe salesman of
legend, that a new country is a rotten prospect: "No market;
no one wears shoes." It is far harder to say: "Great market;
no one wears shoes" -- and to back it up with the necessary
dollars, people, time and imagination.</p>
<p>However, even those FACs that started out well and found
effective routes into Japan often have met a crisis as the
initial window of advantage closes. Fuji-Xerox, for example,
showed extraordinary returns until the mid-1970s, when it
came under pressure from emerging Japanese competitors that
were able to capitalize on small copiers and out market them.
Similarly, Procter & Gamble created the disposable-diapers
market in Japan, but its share of almost 100% in 1979 tumbled
to less than 10% as Uni-charm and Kao first met and then
surpassed it on technology, and outmaneuvered it in
distribution-channel management (wholesalers, distributors
and retailers, etc.).</p>
<p>A senior Japanese executive of a U.S. chemicals company,
now in his 50s, recalls: "Twenty years ago I spent every
night at the best restaurants in Tokyo being entertained by
the chief executives of major Japanese companies, who wanted
to gain access to our technology through joint venture or
licensing. . . . Today, Mitsubishi Chemical has technology to
equal ours; Sumitomo Chemical has surpassed us in some
aspects. No one asks me out to dinner any more."</p>
<p>For those FACs that do not disappear off the map, this
plunge into a mid-life crisis usually precipitates a major
internal review. The conclusion, quite predictable, is that
"we need to become more of an insider." Since it is difficult
to attract top-level Japanese managers from outside the
company, internal Japanese managers are moved up rapidly.</p>
<p>While this solution may result in temporary improvements,
management at headquarters outside Japan usually has
difficulty understanding or accepting local Japanese managers
in the top slots. The result is often a swing back toward
"foreign" management -- most visibly, by the outright removal
of the FAC's top managers or by shunting them sideways.</p>
<p>The ability to manufacture, market and/or sell in Japan
depends, in large measure, on the training and development of
personnel. Few FACs manage to recruit staffers of the quality
of those that enter their Japanese competitors. Effective
execution and the harnessing of global resources also depend
on the transplanting of resources to Japan, despite the high
costs of doing so. Nearly all the industrial companies among
the top 100 FACs have, for example, now established R&D
laboratories in Japan.</p>
<p>The demands of doing business successfully in Japan,
however, go beyond hiring practices and the transplantation
of R&D laboratories and even factories. As the head of one
FAC put it: "We take the most crucial and complex decisions
about Japan and give them to a group whose knowledge about
doing business here amounts to an annual visit to the Okura
Hotel."</p>
<p>Thus, the pressure is on to move in the direction in which
IBM moved in the early 1980s when it shifted a full set of
headquarters functions for the Asia-Pacific region to Tokyo.
Johnson & Johnson asked a retiring member of its Executive
Committee, Frank de Angeli, to head the area and based him in
Japan. Others have taken their former Japan "heads" and put
them in charge of the whole Asia-Pacific region (still based
in Japan) with a new Japan head below them.</p>
<p>These changes highlight what is becoming a core challenge
for FACs and their parents: To compete effectively in Japan
means changing the organization both outside and inside
Japan. As my McKinsey colleague Ken Ohmae has long argued,
success in a global competitive environment requires
companies to "decompose" their global headquarters. There is
often great resistance in doing so. Why, managers wonder,
change comfortable arrangements many thousand miles away when
the problems are local in Japan?</p>
<p>How FACs resolve the problems accompanying their mid-life
crisis will do much to shape the Japanese economy of the 21st
century as well as Japan's economic relationships with the
rest of the world. Traditional sources of advantage no longer
work, and making the necessary adjustments requires carrying
out substantial changes not just in operations in Japan, but
also at headquarters.</p>
