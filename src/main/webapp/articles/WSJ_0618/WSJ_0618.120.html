	<p class="article-leader">PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Hewlett-Packard Co., struggling to
quiet critics of its purchase last year of Apollo Computer
Inc., today is to introduce its first computer workstations
that combine product lines from both brands.
   H-P is unifying only one segment of its H-P and Apollo
workstation families -- the machines based on microprocessors
from Motorola Inc. H-P will still market its own and Apollo
computers that are based on other, dissimilar
microprocessors, and that use different operating systems,
the software that controls a machine's basic functions.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>H-P's new workstations are based on Motorola's new 68040
microprocessor. The 68040 workstation starts at $8,990 and
will be available in late summer. H-P also is releasing a
$4,990 machine based on Motorola's 68030 chip, but buyers
will be able to swap their processors for the more powerful
68040. The introduction of the 68040 model was delayed
because the Motorola chip hasn't been available, H-P said.
Both models, which come equipped with various options, are
aimed more at demonstrating the seriousness of H-P's vow to
streamline its workstation offerings than at any one
particular competitor.</p>
<p>How quickly H-P merges the two different workstation lines
is a critical factor in whether the $476.4 million
acquisition, which vaulted H-P to the top of the roughly $7
billion workstation market, is considered a success. Already,
in the 13 months since buying Apollo, confusion over the
company's direction in workstations and pressure from
competitors have proven costly.</p>
<p>H-P's executives acknowledge problems in coming to grips
with Apollo's operations, but they vigorously defend the
purchase. Many observers, however, are pessimistic, noting
that the strength of Apollo, which helped forge the
workstation market in the early 1980s, had begun to wane even
before the purchase. "The whole Apollo acquisition has turned
out to be quicksand," said Peter Rogers, an analyst at
Robertson Stephens & Co.</p>
<p>H-P concedes that workstation sales are below its
expectations this year, and that Sun Microsystems Inc., which
H-P displaced from the top spot last year, is again the
market's frontrunner. Workstations are generally used by
engineers and scientists for a variety of everyday tasks, and
in recent years have become essential tools in the design of
everything from semiconductors to airplanes.</p>
<p>Observers say Sun is gaining momentum, putting last year's
operational troubles behind it and recently introducing an
under-$5,000 version of its best-selling Sparcstation model.</p>
<p>"Sun is clearly considered to be a more aggressive
marketing company, a win-the-big-deals company," said Thomas
Bruggere, chief executive officer of Mentor Graphics Corp.,
which last week agreed to purchase $300 million of Sun
computers over the next three years. Before the deal, Mentor
was virtually wedded to Apollo workstations.</p>
<p>Strong new products by other competitors also have
squeezed H-P. Earlier this year, International Business
Machines Corp. introduced a slew of aggressively priced
workstations, re-entering the market after years on the
sidelines. Digital Equipment Corp., which like Sun and H-P
has more than 20% of the workstation market, also introduced
new models recently.</p>
<p>The stream of competitive products isn't likely to slow
because the workstation industry is very much a game of
technical leapfrog. Analysts say H-P could trail in the race
for some time. "Until it has a single, coherent workstation
family, H-P is going to find things increasingly difficult,"
Mr. Rogers said.</p>
<p>H-P executives insist that its new workstations, to be
unveiled in Boston, are the first in a series of moves by the
company aimed at reversing its slide in this market. "We have
not abandoned the idea of being the No. 1 workstation
vendor," said Lew Platt, who runs H-P's computer products
sector, which includes the company's workstation group. "We
can certainly regain that position."</p>
<p>David Wu, an analyst at S.G. Warburg & Co., agrees. "While
everyone complained about the costs {of the purchase}, the
benefits are substantial," Mr. Wu said. "Now if Sun ever
stumbles, {H-P has} a shot at No. 1."</p>
<p>Mr. Platt believes the new workstations will put some heat
on Sun and testify to its ability to meld Apollo's
workstation family with its own diverse offerings. Both H-P
and Apollo have workstation lines that are based on
Motorola's chip, and William Kay, general manager of H-P's
workstation group, said this was a natural place to start
blending the product lines.</p>
<p>But analysts questioned H-P's willingness to heavily
support the 68040, Motorola's most advanced chip, at a time
when many customers are choosing workstations that contain
reduced-instruction-set-computing chips at their heart.
Workstation users are notoriously power-hungry, and the
so-called Risc chips outperform Motorola's microprocessors on
most measures.</p>
<p>"They are going against the trend by continuing to push
Motorola," said Jay Prakash, an analyst at Strategic Focus
Inc., a Milpitas, Calif., company that tracks workstation
trends. "The industry is moving to Risc." H-P has its own
Risc workstations, as does Apollo, but Mr. Platt admits that
in bringing Apollo into the fold, H-P neglected important
work in providing new Risc machines.</p>
<p>H-P also must blend two different software operating
systems. The machines announced today use either Apollo's or
H-P's operating system, but customers want a single operating
system that covers every workstation sold by H-P. "They're
working on it," said Mr. Bruggere. "The question is how soon
they'll get there."</p>
<p>Mr. Kay, H-P's workstation chief, said the company planned
to support two different Risc families through 1992. Analysts
expect H-P to support multiple operating systems at least
until then as well. "That's very expensive to do," said Mr.
Prakash.</p>
