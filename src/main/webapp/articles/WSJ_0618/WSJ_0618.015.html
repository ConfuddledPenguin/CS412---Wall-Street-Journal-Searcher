	<p class="article-leader">HARTFORD, Conn. -- It's 8 a.m. Monday and Aetna Life &
Casualty Co. employees, once a lockstep army, are marching to
their own tune.
   And the weekly maneuvers begin for managers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A corporate meeting planner arrives to find an employee he
didn't expect to see until Wednesday busily organizing her
desk; she's switched places with her job-sharing partner, who
usually works Mondays. A finance manager calls a department
meeting, then cancels it after realizing two part-timers
won't be in until Tuesday. And a data processing manager
ponders how her department of six will function when three
employees, all expecting babies, take six-week family leaves.</p>
<p>Faced with a tight labor market, Aetna is rewriting its
rules to give employees more say in when, where and how much
they work. While other companies are beginning to do the
same, Aetna seems to be on the vanguard. And a look at what
the insurer is doing shows some of the benefits and the
pitfalls of breaking away from workweek rigidity.</p>
<p>The new flexibility means difficult adjustments for
managers. Suddenly they must negotiate an array of work
schedules, supervise "out of sight" subordinates and assuage
traditional nine-to-fivers who may resent their freewheeling
colleagues.</p>
<p>"You can no longer say `this is the way it's always been
done' and expect that to continue," says Barbara Prescott,
director of health claims. Nearly 40% of her 107 employees
now work "flextime" (adjusting their own starting and
quitting hours), while others work part-time or from home.
"Today's work force is fluid," she notes. "You've got to give
up some control and be open to new ideas -- but also realize
you aren't going to please everyone."</p>
<p>Daniel Durej, director of financial services-commercial
insurance division, admits "a chill went through me" when a
manager on his staff requested a part-time schedule after the
birth of her second child two years ago. "My first response
was `we can't do it,'" he says. "I thought maybe if we were
standing on an assembly line making widgets it would be
possible, but this is a management job."</p>
<p>But the alternative -- losing a highly valued employee --
seemed worse. So Mr. Durej offered her a three-day-a-week,
nonmanagement job. Still, he adds, he probably assigned her
too many duties for a part-time schedule, and "she ended up
taking work home a lot, working overtime and feeling
overburdened."</p>
<p>He, in turn, found himself "stepping in too often" to
absorb some of the load. The solution: putting a layer of
management between himself and the part-timer.</p>
<p>Despite the snags, Mr. Durej became "less apprehensive"
about flexible scheduling. When a second manager requested a
four-day week after the birth of her third child, he didn't
immediately rule out a management slot. Instead, he polled
her staff, who agreed they'd have no problem working for a
part-time boss. But to ensure that they wouldn't be
overworked, he added one more employee to her staff.</p>
<p>The biggest fear among managers is that once they say yes
to one employee, everyone will want part-time or job sharing.
After Vin Darcy, a systems supervisor, arranged a three-day
schedule for a woman who was juggling caring for a new baby
and her two elderly parents, he heard "me too" rumblings from
others on his staff. "I called them together and said `you
know you'd have to take a pay cut' if you work fewer days --
and they all backed off," he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Darcy isn't at all certain he'd offer part-time
equally to everyone. "It takes a very strong person to do
this," he says. Two women on his staff who currently work
compressed weeks "do as much in three days as others do in
five."</p>
<p>Still, the success of such arrangements has propelled
Aetna to offer employees a medley of options. Some 1,200
employees now work part time, up from 700 a few years ago;
several hundred telecommute from their homes and 65 to 70
work part-time in pairs, sharing one job, one salary and one
set of benefits.</p>
<p>"We're not doing it to be nice, but because it makes
business sense," says Sherry Herchenroether, manager of
family services. Nearly 70% of Aetna's 45,000 employees are
female, including 17% of the company's managers. Three years
ago, Aetna found that 23% of those who had taken maternity
disability left the company after becoming mothers. A year
later, after introducing a six-month unpaid family leave,
that attrition rate was cut in half.</p>
<p>The hardest thing to manage is job sharing. "You have to
match the right people together, and you're supervising two
people for the time it would take to supervise one," Ms.
Herchenroether says.</p>
<p>Sue Yucha and Karen Queno for the past four years have
shared a job arranging conferences for Aetna managers. Each
woman has a distinct style (Ms. Yucha, for instance, admits
she's messy, while Ms. Queno is neat). But the pair, both
mothers of two children, have made it work. They aren't
supervisors, so there isn't the problem of subordinates
answering to two masters. They hash out differences privately
and stay in close touch by phone. Ms. Queno works the first
half of the week, Ms. Yucha the second, and they confer over
lunch on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Their boss, Paul Rannenberg, acknowledges that he had
initial reservations -- but says he'd now welcome an entire
staff of job sharers. "The synergy you get can be great, and
if one is sick or on vacation, the other is always there."</p>
<p>At what point is flexible scheduling more trouble than
it's worth? When employees try to take advantage of the
situation, says Ms. Herchenroether. One employee, she says,
arranged a flextime schedule when his parents became ill --
but instead of honoring the new arrangement arrived at work
later and later. Another wanted to work just 20 hours a month
-- not nearly enough to make a contribution.</p>
<p>But if there's a will, there's usually a way. She recalls
the dilemma faced by a data processing manager when three of
her six staffers, all specialists, became pregnant at the
same time. All three wanted family leaves and part-time
schedules on their return. "The thought of having even one
out was frightening," says Ms. Herchenroether. But the
manager mapped out a plan to cross-train the employees to do
each other's jobs. She also found temporary workers to fill
in during family leaves.</p>
<p>"The manager said she was bending over backwards to
accommodate everyone because she'd eventually want the same
treatment," says Ms. Herchenroether. And indeed, the manager
became pregnant nine months later and is currently on a
family leave.</p>
