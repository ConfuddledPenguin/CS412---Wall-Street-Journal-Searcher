	<p class="article-leader">WAUKEGAN, Ill. -- Outboard Marine Corp. isn't positioning
itself for "tomorrow or the next quarter, but for the long
term" during the current slump in the recreational boating
industry, James C. Chapman, president and chief executive
officer, said.
   Outboard Marine is sticking with its program of vertical
integration of engine and boat manufacturing and stepping up
its global sales and marketing efforts, Mr. Chapman said in
an interview.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Initially a leading manufacturer of boat engines, Outboard
Marine will step up its presence in all aspects of boat and
engine sales and manufacturing to "compete in every product
line," according to Mr. Chapman. He said Outboard Marine also
will work to rebuild its relationship with its 5,000 North
American dealers, many of whom are wary of expanding
inventory as consumers shun recreational boats.</p>
<p>In its second quarter, ended March 31, Outboard Marine had
a loss of $5.6 million, or 29 cents a share, from continuing
operations. It had profit of $9.2 million, or 47 cents a
share, in the year-earlier period. Sales in the quarter fell
to $309.2 million from $402.6 million.</p>
<p>While expanding its interests from engine manufacturing to
boating packaging and sales, Outboard Marine has shed its
unrelated units. After selling its Cushman industrial vehicle
and turf-care business to Ransomes America Corp. for $150
million and its Lawn-Boy lawn mower division to Toro Co. for
$85 million, Outboard Marine is in a strong cash position
with a debt-to-equity ratio of about 26%. A flurry of
acquisitions has added the Donzi and Chris-Craft boat and
cruiser lines to Outboard Marine's industry-leading Johnson
and Evinrude outboard brands.</p>
<p>Mr. Chapman said Outboard Marine's recent acquisition of
Grumman Corp.'s boat division brought it 11 boat makers with
13 brand names. He said the purchase has allowed Outboard
Marine to push hard to boost its position in the world
market.</p>
<p>In the 3 1/2 years that it has been selling packaged
boats, Outboard Marine brands accounted for 25% of all U.S.
boats sold overseas, Mr. Chapman said. International sales
accounted for 23% of the company's $1.46 billion revenue in
1989, and its goal is to boost overseas sales to as much as
35% of the total.</p>
<p>Mr. Chapman said Outboard Marine will continue to hold
down manufacturing costs in the capital-intensive engine
manufacturing business. From 1980 to 1985, the firm spent
$100 million to move 70% of its manufacturing capacity from
Northern plants to technically improved sites in the South,
Mr. Chapman said. Those moves resulted in a 50% reduction in
labor costs, he said.</p>
<p>Outboard Marine has responded to the 15% industrywide
sales downturn over the past 18 months by closing one plant
and idling workers at others. The closing last month of an
engine assembly plant in Rutherfordton, N.C., will result in
a $3 million charge for the current quarter.</p>
<p>"It may seem contradictory to close an assembly plant and
buy a boat company," Mr. Chapman said. "But the closings help
us consolidate our outboard manufacturing in the here and
now. The acquisitions are for our long-term strength. The
next 100 years, that's what we're looking at."</p>
