	<p class="article-leader">Outbreaks of violence in Central Asia are being attributed
by Soviet authorities to "inter-ethnic" conflicts, mainly
between Uzbek and Kirghiz factions. But Moscow has a far
bigger problem than that. Central Asia, populated mainly by
the descendants of Genghis Khan, has never cottoned to
Russian rule. Now it is in a position to do something about
it.
   Shukrulla Rahmatovich Mirsaidov, prime minister of the
most populous Central Asian republic, Uzbekistan, recently
issued a "declaration of economic independence." He is
demanding greater control over the republic's resources.
Uzbekistan already is conducting some foreign and domestic
trade independently of Moscow's directives. The Soviet
Parliament, desperately trying to stave off economic
collapse, may have added impetus to such ad-hoc
decentralization moves last week by pushing for devolution of
central-government property to regional and local authorities
to promote market economics.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A housing shortage was the flash point of Central Asian
unrest. Rapid growth of the population has been aggravated by
an influx of refugees from other trouble spots, such as
Armenia and Azerbaijan. There are well-founded suspicions
that the KGB stirred up some of the ethnic quarrels over
housing to provide an excuse for the military crackdown
unleashed on the region by Moscow early this month.</p>
<p>The most serious "inter-ethnic" conflict is between the
Central Asian peoples as a group and the Russians. It has
existed for centuries. Ivan the Terrible, reacting against
many years of devastating assaults on Russia by the Mongols
and Tartars, conquered the Khanate of Kazan in 1552, giving
Russia its first Moslem subjects. The Russians completed
their conquest of the region in 1873.</p>
<p>But this part of the Russian empire, as with others, has
been held together mainly with force and cunning, not by
mutual advantage of the type that has made other empires
thrive. Some of the more idealistic Bolsheviks of the Lenin
era hoped to create a genuine "union" of peoples of disparate
cultures. But just as communism ultimately failed as an
economic idea it also failed as an instrument for creating
social and cultural comity.</p>
<p>Central Asians helped the Bolsheviks overthrow Czar
Nicholas II. The Uzbeks had visions of shucking off the czars
and setting up a European-style democracy, as might befit a
country nearly as large as Spain. But all those early dreams
were wiped out by Stalinist tyranny. Islam was brutally
suppressed. Secret-police methods of political control were
installed, and the Central Asians were no better off than
they had been under the czars.</p>
<p>During World War II, Stalin moved factories to Uzbekistan
to get them out of the reach of the Germans. The Russians
also have developed Uzbekistan's natural resources -- gas,
oil, a variety of metal ores, uranium and the gold of the
Kyzyl Kum desert. But the region still is heavily
agricultural. One of the many Uzbek grievances is over their
share of the fruits of their natural wealth. Pipelines
carrying Uzbek gas to Russia pass through regions that have
no access to fuel, they complain.</p>
<p>One of the biggest failures, however, has been the
self-conscious Russian attempt at cultural imperialism. No
one would doubt the richness of Russian culture, but Central
Asia has its own cultural history. Indeed, it was a thriving
outpost of Persian civilization at the time of Alexander the
Great's conquests in the fourth century B.C., when Russia was
a vast wilderness. The emperor Tamerlane, sitting in his
wealthy capital of Samarkand, ruled a 14th-century empire
that stretched from Baghdad to Delhi.</p>
<p>I had a firsthand glimpse of the Russian-Uzbek cultural
division in 1967 when I toured Tashkent, Samarkand and
Bukhara -- three ancient Uzbek cities -- for an article in
this newspaper about Soviet tourism. The Soviets had just
opened up Central Asia to tourists. I asked the Intourist
bureau at the Tashkent Hotel for a ticket to a concert that
would give me a taste of the local culture. What I got
instead was a ticket to a viola concert by a Russian woman.
It was almost a private performance because the vast hall was
nearly empty. Russian culture was not a big draw in Tashkent.</p>
<p>A few nights later, I made the same request in Bukhara, an
ancient city that still had at its center the large domed
caravansary that once was an overnight haven for the richly
laden camel caravans traveling the silk route between the
Middle East and China. This time, the Intourist desk was
manned by Uzbeks and a young Uzbek guide conducted me to a
concert very much to her own liking, seating me in the front
row with a jolly group that seemed to be members of her
extended family. This time the performer was an Uzbek man
plucking a stringed instrument and keening the haunting,
unrhythmic music of the Turkic world.</p>
<p>"He is a classic," my guide whispered, and a packed house
seemed to agree, applauding each song wildly. The guide's
kinfolk, pleased at having a visitor from a distant planet,
treated me to a glass of Pepsi.</p>
<p>In Samarkand, another guide showed me the observatory
where Ulugh Beg, the great Uzbek astronomer, in the 15th
century had made precise calculations of the distance to the
sun. Nearby, gleaming in the spectacular light that followed
a thundershower, were the beautiful turquoise domes of
mosques that still decorate Tamerlane's capital. At that time
their use for worship was being discouraged by the Russians.
Indeed, the grand mosque at Bukhara, with columns made of
wood from the Holy Land, had been converted to a billiard
parlor by Soviet authorities.</p>
<p>On a still-seamier note, I had been greeted in Tashkent
when I deplaned at 2 a.m. after a five-hour flight from
Moscow by a tough-looking fellow who had joined the young man
from Intourist. His purpose was to see that I stopped in the
airport lounge to have a drink with some of his friends, two
men and two women. It soon became obvious that these were my
local KGB shadows, folks I kept glimpsing out of the corner
of my eye throughout my innocent pursuit of the tourism
story.</p>
<p>Today's unrest is the legacy of economic exploitation, KGB
fun and games, and attempts to suppress Islam (which have
proved unsuccessful). It comes as no surprise today that
local politicians in Tashkent and elsewhere in Central Asia
have been emboldened by "glasnost" to begin to talk about
Uzbek independence and about keeping some of the wealth of
their country for the direct benefit of the people there. As
with the Baltic peoples, they complain about having their
young men drafted to serve in the Soviet army. Those soldiers
proved highly unreliable when they were sent into Afghanistan
early in the war there, so much so that they were quickly
withdrawn. The Afghan rebels looked more like brothers than
did the Russians.</p>
<p>None of this says much about the future of Central Asia,
particularly now that Soviet troops are on the scene. But it
is useful to remember that it does have a culture, and a
polity, of its own. And after all these years, the Russians
are discovering that their brand of imperialism has not been
a big success.</p>
