	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Journalists from five newspapers and a news
service sued Eastman Kodak Co.'s Atex electronic-publishing
unit for $330 million, claiming that using the Atex computer
system at work caused them permanent injuries.
   The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleged
that Atex knew the computer system could pose health risks,
such as injuries to the wrists and arms, from repetitive use.
The lawsuit accused the company of negligence in not
notifying users of the risks or changing the computer system,
which is used for reporting and editing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The lawsuit said Atex "disregarded medical and scientific
information, studies, tests, data and literature concerning
the causal relationship between the repetitive use of
computer systems and cumulative trauma disorders," as the
ailments are known.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Atex said the company hadn't seen the
suit. He said the company doesn't comment on issues that are
in litigation. Eastman Kodak, the parent company, isn't named
as a defendant.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs are seven journalists working for both the
New York and Long Island editions of Newsday, Discount Store
News, the Village Voice, American Banker and the Associated
Press, and one former American Banker reporter. Three of the
plaintiffs' spouses also are plaintiffs, seeking additional
damages for the loss of the journalists' support.</p>
<p>The journalists claim their injuries prevent them from
pursuing normal activities and employment. The injuries
include carpal tunnel syndrome, tendinitis and nerve
disorders, the lawsuit said.</p>
<p>In the lawsuit, the journalists also alleged that the
computer system -- including the keyboard and video display
terminal -- was defectively designed. A similar suit was
filed against Atex in state court in Manhattan earlier this
month by three other Newsday reporters.</p>
