	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A federal appeals court threw out an $11
million jury verdict against Grant Thornton, an accounting
firm that was sued in connection with its audits of
Auto-Train Co. in 1978 and 1979.
   A federal jury in Washington awarded the damages in 1985
for breach of contract, negligence and fraud. The damages
were awarded to Murray Drabkin, the bankruptcy trustee for
Auto-Train, who filed the suit in 1983. Auto-Train ceased
operations in 1981.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The lawsuit charged that Chicago-based Grant Thornton,
formerly Alexander Grant & Co., failed to disclose in its
audits that Auto-Train used funds withheld for federal
payroll taxes to meet its cash needs. The lawsuit also
charged that the audits overestimated the value of
Auto-Train's assets. Because of these omissions, the lawsuit
said, the audits failed to sound alarms about Auto-Train's
worsening financial plight.</p>
<p>But the appeals court, in a 3-0 decision written by Judge
Stephen Williams, said the evidence on which the jury relied
failed to show that Grant Thornton caused or contributed to
Auto-Train's problems. Moreover, the appeals court noted that
Grant Thornton's audits included qualified opinions on the
company's stability.</p>
<p>The appeals court ruling didn't establish any new legal
principles. But Kathryn Oberly, a Washington lawyer for Grant
Thornton, said that with lawsuits against accounting firms
becoming more common, "We're delighted to have the appeals
court recognize that, regardless of how badly or how well the
auditing firm did its job, plaintiffs must prove" that the
accountants caused the problem for which a suit seeks to hold
them liable.</p>
