	<p class="article-leader">ZANZIBAR, Tanzania -- Bob Hope, Bing Crosby and the
Hollywood movie to the contrary, there is no Road to
Zanzibar.
   For one thing, it's an island in the Indian Ocean
inaccessible by land. You can't even be sure of getting there
by boat or plane. And once you are there, you might wonder
why you bothered.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>All of which is trouble for the local tourist trade.</p>
<p>Zanzibar is a quirky place. Once part of a British
protectorate, it overthrew Arab rulers in 1964, only to then
merge with Tanzania. Its president at the time, hoping to
attract visitors, set about building the world's largest
swimming pool -- in a swamp. Pouring concrete there didn't
work out well, but hope springs eternal.</p>
<p>Today, Chief Minister Omar Juma, who, like many
Zanzibaris, is given to sighing wistfully, considers it his
mission to create a tourist trade that will save Zanzibar's
decaying economy.</p>
<p>In theory that isn't a bad idea, since the island has the
makings of a tropical paradise: groves of coconut palms
hugging pristine coral beaches, an equatorial climate with a
dry period from June to October and cool southeast trade
winds. Native spices -- cloves, cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg
-- add an alluring aroma. The ancient Stone Town, the
commercial quarter of limestone buildings set on twisting
narrow streets, oozes history of Arab slave traders, Persian
craftsmen and African chieftans.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the streets at times also ooze sewage. The
buildings, in various stages of collapse, are mainly occupied
by squatters. Half the island's children are malnourished.
And skinny cats chase skinny rats. The local mosquitoes carry
malaria. The water isn't potable, and the best hotel is none
too good.</p>
<p>It isn't surprising then that the tourist trade suffers
from a decided lack of tourists. The government claims there
were 43,557 of them last year, but the figure is way off,
including as it surely must residents returning from the
mainland and everybody else who came to the island for any
reason at all. The 700,000 people who live on Zanzibar mostly
are peasants engaged in farming, fishing and trade.</p>
<p>Since transport is a problem, there are precious few
visitors to Zanzibar today. Those who actually make it here
are mainly Europeans, Arabs and Indians -- and students with
packs on their backs.</p>
<p>"I must confess," sighs Mr. Juma, "it is very difficult
for tourists to get to Zanzibar. You can get stranded in Dar
es Salaam."</p>
<p>That isn't a pleasant prospect either. Dar es Salaam is
the seedy capital of Tanzania, a huge, seedy nation. Dar es
Salaam has the biggest urban potholes in Africa. It also has
a fairly modern airport, which is a plus, since one is likely
to get stuck there for hours and hours.</p>
<p>Dar es Salaam lies a mere 20 miles west of Zanzibar, a
distance shorter than a marathon but harder to negotiate.</p>
<p>The latest brochure on Zanzibar from the tourist office in
Dar was printed in 1983 and speaks of "up to four flights
daily" and "several passenger ferries." That information is
hopelessly out of date. Zanzibaris tell the tale, sighing
wistfully, of the Virgin Butterfly, a Norwegian catamaran
that carried travelers between Dar es Salaam and Zanzibar.
For several months last year, the Butterfly actually plied
the seas in air-conditioned style, making the trip in less
than an hour. Then one day, the Butterfly broke down. Fixing
it was adjudged to be "too sophisticated" for Zanzibari
technology, so the craft was towed to the Kenyan port of
Mombasa. Work was just commencing when, as a local
businessman explains it, "one fine night, the Butterfly, she
just disappears." Apparently, she disappeared back to
Scandinavia.</p>
<p>In the wake of the Butterfly came the Dolphin, a
fresh-water ferry from the U.S. made seaworthy for saltwater.
Two months ago it began chugging from mainland to island in
about three hours. It was no Butterfly, but for several weeks
it did the trick, until it hit a reef about six miles off
Zanzibar. It awaits repair.</p>
<p>For the truly desperate traveler, there are the Arab
trading dhows, which carry all manner of cargo in their
wooden hulls, including the occasional tourist. If the wind
is right, the dhows can make the trip to Zanzibar in four to
five hours. If the wind isn't right, the traders lower sail
and can drift for four or five days. To lighten the load, the
traders will first throw the tourists' luggage overboard, and
then, if need be, the tourists themselves. "It happens," says
a travel agent for the Tanzania Tourist Corp. in Dar es
Salaam. "Better to forget the dhows. Why not just fly?"</p>
<p>Ah, yes, the national airline, ATC. It's not for nothing
that the locals call Air Tanzania Corp. "Any Time Canceled"
and "Air Total Confusion." Whatever the brochures say, it is
cause for jubilation on the island when a flight arrives.
Scheduled flights to Zanzibar are routinely rerouted to
destinations on the mainland, and even foreigners who have
paid for their tickets in dollars are frequently bumped and
recompensed in Tanzanian shillings. Last month, passengers
flying to Zanzibar from Oman were told to disembark in Dar
because the plane was being rerouted. The passengers refused.
After a standoff lasting several hours, the plane actually
made the 15 minute flight to Zanzibar.</p>
<p>The last resort is to charter an 18-year-old Cessna. On
take-off, the pilot apologizes for the plane's tattered
condition. "At least it flies," he says. It has till now. The
fare: $200, one way.</p>
<p>Of course, even the charter doesn't fly when the Zanzibar
airport is closed, as it was for five days last month. That
was one week that this tourist paradise went without
tourists, except for those already marooned here.</p>
<p>Some Zanzibaris are willing to blame everything on bad
luck. Boats break down, flights are canceled. Things happen.
Still, with African political intrigue as thick as the
malarial mosquitoes, conspiracy theories abound.</p>
<p>"Zanzibar wants tourists, but it doesn't want foreigners,"
whispers Zanzibari political dissident Muhammed Ali. "The
authorities fear that if foreigners come, the Zanzibaris will
inform them about the situation."</p>
<p>Mr. Ali spent seven months in a Zanzibar jail in 1983 for
opposing union between Zanzibar and Tanzania and now, as he
speaks in the foyer of the Dar es Salaam library, he is
suddenly surrounded by young men straining to listen like
extras in one of those old E.F. Hutton commercials.
"Informants," says Mr. Ali. To throw them off, he picks up a
copy of the Economist and pretends to read. Then he walks to
the bookshelves and pretends to browse.</p>
<p>The "situation," he explains quietly, is that a number of
dissidents such as himself are agitating for Zanzibar's
independence. Zanzibar, he says, has been neglected since it
joined the union in 1964. The mainland government, he says,
has consistently refused Zanzibar permission to start its own
air service to provide for a reliable tourist trade. That is
proof, he insists, of a conspiracy to isolate the island.</p>
<p>"Why else," he asks, "should it be so difficult to get to
Zanzibar?"</p>
<p>A lonely bartender at the Bwawani Hotel, confronted with
the riddle, throws up his arms. The Bwawani, a concrete
monstrosity painted a garish yellow, is located on the edge
of the swamp where the world's largest pool is in an advanced
state of rot. On a good day, 20 of its 120 rooms are
occupied. It is supposed to be the best hotel on the island,
providing "luxury accommodations for visitors." Visited
recently, the place was in the middle of a power failure and
phones weren't working. So much for luxury. "No boats, no
planes," sighs the bartender wistfully. "Maybe in 10 years it
will be better."</p>
<p>Zanzibar has already been waiting 30 years for better, its
development on hold since the 1964 revolution. Its heyday was
in the mid-1800s, under the rule of the Sultan of Oman, when
the island was the center of the ignominious Arab slave
trade. It enjoyed a brief renaissance earlier this century as
the fabled Spice Island, exporting its cloves to the world.
But as its largest customers learned to grow cloves
themselves, the market collapsed. As they say here, as cloves
go, so goes Zanzibar.</p>
<p>Perhaps, says Chief Minister Juma, Tanzania's current tilt
toward private enterprise, after three decades of socialism
and pervasive nationalization, will save Zanzibar. He speaks
hopefully of a privately run airport, a private air service
that can maintain regular flights, and of returning Stone
Town to private owners who will fix up the houses.</p>
<p>There is just one problem. "I must confess," Mr. Juma
sighs, "most of our people are not very experienced in
private matters."</p>
