	<p class="article-leader">Chicago -- We're being administered heavy doses of epochal
theater here, one from the lurid, pre-Hitler Germany of the
1920s, the other from the rapacious, pre-Bush U.S. of the
1980s. "Threepenny Opera," by Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill,
was imported by Chicago's third International Theatre
Festival in a production of the Theater An Der Ruhr, a young
troupe that operates out of Muelheim, West Germany. A local
production company is doing a new play, "Other People's
Money," originally produced in New York in 1987 and still
running there as a kind of cult event. The playwright is
Jerry Sterner, a former real estate syndicator and
stock-market speculator, whose venture into theater plays
resonantly along with the Brecht. One of the most famous
lines in "Threepenny Opera" is: "Grub first, then ethics."
MacHeath, Mackie the Knife, sings the line to a laconic but
delightful Kurt Weill tune. Mr. Sterner is no Brecht, and he
has no Weill to lift his leaden prose. But his main
character, the takeover artist Lawrence Garfinkle, Larry the
Liquidator, can sound Brechtian: "We've come from `Ask not
what your country can do for you' to `What's in it for me?'
to `What's in it for me -- today]' all in one short
generation."
   Nobody even started out innocent in Brecht's Berlin.
Mackie is an old-fashioned crook who would steal anything not
tied down, even if he had to kill for it. He could count on
his friend, Tiger Brown, the police chief, to look the other
way. The only thing Mackie favored above crime was sex, and
sometimes he was able to combine them in rape. His women
loved Mackie as much as he loved them, which is to say they
had no problem betraying him to Peachum, the father of
Mackie's bride, who wanted Mackie hanged.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Greed also was pretty widely distributed, according to Mr.
Sterner, in the epoch of corporate cannibalism just ending.
Labor sucked companies dry. Politicians stole money and
raised taxes, making it even harder for our companies to
compete. Management ignored the handwriting on the wall in
order to protect their cushy jobs. Lawyers and investment
bankers hired themselves out to the highest bidders and
conjured up schemes such as stock repurchases, shark
repellents, poison pills, greenmail and golden parachutes, to
protect unworthy managements while diluting stockholder, or
"stuckholder" interests, as Garfinkle puts it.</p>
<p>So we live in a time that should make it possible for an
accomplished German theater troupe to visit these shores and
re-create the mood of Brecht and Weill's Berlin. To be sure,
"Threepenny Opera" is not easy to bring off, but the
International Theatre Festival had an obligation to import a
company capable of doing so. Chicago, after all, is not
Edinburgh, or Spoleto, or Charleston, S.C., cities and towns
that import theater periodically because they have relatively
little of their own. The millions of dollars in grants from
Ameritech, Illinois Bell and other corporate sponsors
expended to shlep Theatre An Der Ruhr and the other
international companies across the water might instead be
nourishing another "Grapes of Wrath" at Chicago's Steppenwolf
Theatre Company, which just won the Tony Award for best
Broadway play, or "Glengarry Glen Ross," the David Mamet
piece that was developed at the Goodman Theatre. Instead of a
"Threepenny Opera" dramatically better than one of our own
young theaters might have done locally, we got a mildly
interesting production by a company younger and greener than
several doing business here.</p>
<p>Much of the mild interest was supplied by having the part
of Jenny, brilliantly created and often re-created by Weill's
wife, Lotte Lenya, played by a mincing man, Volker Roos. The
point, I suppose, is to suggest the utter decadence of the
epoch, but one can't help thinking that it was to obscure the
absence of a female who could come close to matching Lenya's
recorded performances, notably the splendid 1931 film version
made by G.W. Pabst.</p>
<p>The street singers and pianist who open the show with the
famous "Ballad of Mackie the Knife" are played as clowns.
Perhaps because they can't sing either, director and company
founder Robert Ciulli has them run through lots of clown
business as the evening wears on, but to no good effect. The
play itself is burlesque enough without superfluous gags. If
the unnecessary and unwanted clown shtik made the audience
impatient, the lack of adequate translation was downright
frustrating. We cannot blame the acting troupe for the
failures of the simultaneous-translation technology that
prevented those not fluent in German from understanding the
opening scene. But it must have been by design that Mr.
Ciulli didn't even attempt to translate Brecht's lyrics to
Weill's tunes -- a great mistake.</p>
<p>In "Other People's Money," Mr. Sterner's dialogue
sometimes reads as if it were a mediocre translation from
some other tongue, but director Kevin Conway, who played
Garfinkle in the New York production, derives real feelings
and mixed motives from his characters. As Jorgenson, the
elderly chairman of the unfriendly takeover target, Edgar
Meyer conveys a nice sense of challenged rectitude. Peter Van
Wagner's smart, roguish Lawrence Garfinkle plays the takeover
game with a feeling of joy that obviously transcends his
quest for money. Larry not only wants to liquidate New
England Wire and Cable, he also wants to win the body and
even the heart of Kate Sullivan, the tough yuppie lawyer who
comes back to her home town of Providence to defend the
company.</p>
<p>The role of Kate is not easy to portray. She's got to be
smart, shrewd, tough and sexy. Elizabeth Hess plays Kate as
an aggressive cheerleader, which just isn't enough. I can
imagine Kathleen Turner succeeding with Kate, but even she
would have problems. The young Lotte Lenya would have been
perfect. But even without a script that sings or a perfect
cast, "Other People's Money" is very satisfying theater.
Unlike the movie "Wall Street," Mr. Sterner's play doesn't
let us rest comfortably with the false notion that the
takeover artists are unnatural predators who are destroying
our industrial ecology. Larry the Liquidator is no more a
hero than Mackie the Knife. He's in the game because he loves
money and what it buys. But he also believes that he is
making assets more productive, forcing workers to do a day's
work for a day's pay, replacing complacent managers with
those who know how to go head to head against the Japanese .
. . and the Germans.</p>
<p>If these theatrical productions are a gauge of how well
various countries can compete in the international
marketplace, buy American. Theater An Der Ruhr presented
"Threepenny Opera" as part of the International Theatre
Festival and immediately returned to Germany to begin
rehearsals for its new season. Other People's Money" will run
at least through the summer at the Royal George Theater.</p>
