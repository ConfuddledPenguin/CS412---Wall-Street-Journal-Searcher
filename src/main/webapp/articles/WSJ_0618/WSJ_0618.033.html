	<p class="article-leader">In his June 14 editorial-page article ("Stop Bashing
Program Trading"), Dean Furbush, an economic adviser to the
chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,
criticized the SEC's Division of Market Regulation report and
argued that we should "stop bashing program trading." Mr.
Furbush misstates our position on index arbitrage and misses
the main factual conclusions.
   It has never been the position of the SEC or the division
that program trading or index arbitrage causes extreme
volatility in the market. Indeed, the division emphasized in
its report regarding Oct. 13, 1989 -- when the securities
markets lost $190 billion in market value, $160 billion of
which was lost in the space of just 90 minutes -- that the
triggering event for the decline was the announcement that
financing for a buy-out of United Airlines had fallen through
with predictable effects on potential takeover activity.
These are not opinions, they are simply facts regarding what
actually happened that day.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>What the division's market reconstruction actually did
find was that, from the UAL announcement to the close of Oct.
13, index arbitrage and other program selling on the New York
Stock Exchange accounted for nearly 27% of S&P 500 stock
volume. Moreover, program selling accounted for 36% of S&P
volume when the futures were not subject to price limits and
reached levels as high as 50%. These aggregate levels were
substantially higher than the aggregate program trading
levels during the market crash of October 1987.</p>
<p>The division found that index arbitrage has the effect of
concentrating selling activity in a time period in which
market participants are not always capable of responding
effectively. Moreover, even when index arbitrage is not
flooding the stock market, the "billboard effect" of
plummeting index futures can lead to additional selling and
discourage buying interest. To use Mr. Furbush's automobile
metaphor, when prices are falling rapidly, index arbitrage
can act like a turbocharger on a car engine. The driver has
to press the gas pedal, but once the pedal is pressed the
turbocharger causes the car to accelerate far more rapidly.</p>
<p>Our finding that index arbitrage will "accelerate" market
declines isn't new. Since 1986 we have concluded in every
study of volatility that program trading and index arbitrage
compress the time in which market moves occur from days to
hours and -- in the case of Oct. 13, 1989 -- minutes. Index
arbitrage, however, is not the end of the story, it is the
beginning.</p>
<p>Because of its structure and leverage, the stock-index
futures market has assumed a price leadership role. Arbitrage
trading acts, in effect, as a bridge transferring potent
price swings from the futures markets to the stock market. As
such, it highlights the need to scrutinize carefully not the
transmission belt of arbitrage trading, but the underlying
trading practices and dynamics of the futures market that may
encourage periods of extreme price volatility. While Mr.
Furbush ignores this question, there are a number of relevant
findings in the division's report.</p>
<p>-- Index-futures selling on Oct. 13 was dominated by
short-term traders. The division found futures selling was
focused in small and large speculative accounts, foreign
accounts (mostly speculative short-term trading accounts) and
options-market-maker accounts.</p>
<p>-- Chicago Mercantile Exchange floor traders ("locals")
did not provide net liquidity to the market. Throughout the
critical period between 2:40 p.m. and 4:15 p.m. locals were
net sellers in seven out of nine 10-minute periods. This does
not compare well with stock specialists who were net buyers
of stock during that period.</p>
<p>-- A number of transactions classified as index arbitrage
were not executed contemporaneously, as bona-fide arbitrage
transactions normally are. These "legging" transactions --
where one side of the transaction is completed before the
other -- are really speculative trading in arbitrage clothing
and can have a substantially destabilizing impact on the
market.</p>
<p>These findings underline concerns the commission has
expressed over the operation and regulation of the
stock-index futures market. It simply makes no sense for
fundamentally interlinked markets to have different
regulators.</p>
<p>Moreover, the high levels of speculative trading on Oct.
13 explain why the commission along with the chairman of the
Federal Reserve and the secretary of the Treasury all believe
that levels of stock-index futures margin as low as 2.2% are
simply unsafe for our markets.</p>
<p>How can we address these problems without crippling the
futures industry? We strongly believe that the bill recently
introduced by the administration would accomplish these dual
objectives.</p>
<p>By giving a federal agency oversight of stock-index
futures margins -- oversight that exists now with respect to
stocks and options, but not futures -- the bill would ensure
that stock-index futures margins never again would fall to
irresponsibly low levels that can jeopardize the stability of
stock and futures markets. At the same time, by transferring
jurisdiction over stock-index futures to the SEC, the
proposal would reduce costs to market participants,
facilitate regulatory coordination, and improve efforts to
detect and deter fraud in the stock and the futures markets.</p>
<p>As a bonus, the administration's bill would negate the
anti-competitive effects of the so-called "exclusivity
clause" of the commodities laws. This would allow securities
exchanges and corporate issuers to offer investors products
that are forbidden from trading anywhere but on a futures
exchange. To invest in these products today, investors must
look to our competitors in Europe and Canada.</p>
<p>In short, the bill would improve dramatically the current
regulatory environment while significantly reducing costs to
market participants. Most important, both market stability
and protection against intermarket fraud would be improved
for the 50 million Americans who have invested in U.S.
securities markets.</p>
