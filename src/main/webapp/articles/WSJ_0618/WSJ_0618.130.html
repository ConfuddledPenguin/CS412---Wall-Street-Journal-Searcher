	<p class="article-leader">Southeast Banking Corp. slashed its dividend, announced
asset sales, boosted loan-loss reserves and said it expects
to post losses for the second quarter and year, all
reflecting the worsening condition of the South Florida real
estate market.
   As recently as March 23, Charles J. Zwick, chairman and
chief executive officer of Miami-based Southeast, said the
bank holding company would be profitable this year, and many
banking analysts had expected Southeast to turn a modest
profit in the second quarter.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But Friday, the company disclosed that the credit quality
of its large South Florida loan portfolio is much lower than
previously believed.</p>
<p>The bleak outlook sent Southeast stock tumbling Friday to
$11, down $2.375, in heavy New York Stock Exchange composite
trading.</p>
<p>Southeast said it would take several steps to shore up its
balance sheet. First, the company slashed its quarterly
dividend by 64%, to 10 cents a share from 28 cents a share.
The dividend is payable July 17 to shares of record June 25.
The last time Southeast cut its dividend was 1976.</p>
<p>Second, the company said it reached a preliminary
agreement to sell certain assets of its mortgage subsidiary
to Sears Mortgage Corp., a unit of Sears Roebuck & Co. The
transaction, if completed, would include Southeast's
residental mortgage servicing portfolio, a number of branch
offices of the mortgage unit and other assets and would
result in a payment to Southeast of as much as $100 million,
the firm said.</p>
<p>Southeast said it is looking for other "significant cost
savings," including the possibility of deferring some capital
projects.</p>
<p>Third, Southeast said it is adding between $2 million and
$22 million to its loan-loss reserve, raising its total
provision for bad loans to a projected $260 million to $280
million by June 30 from $258 million March 31. The increase
reflects a surge in nonperforming assets. The company said it
expects its total nonperforming loans to range between $600
million and $620 million by June 30, up at least 26% since
March 31.</p>
<p>Loan-loss reserves are a fund that banks set aside to
offset expected losses from bad loans. Nonperforming assets
are loans that have been foreclosed upon or are more than 90
days past due.</p>
<p>Southeast didn't elaborate on its projected results for
the second quarter or year except to say that neither period
will be profitable. In the 1989 second quarter, Southeast had
net income of $32.3 million, or $1 a share. For all of 1989,
it had net of $80.5 million, or $2.42 a share.</p>
<p>"The condition of Florida's economy has not improved and
continues to adversely affect the loan porfolio," Mr. Zwick
said. But, he said, "The situation now is better than it was
in the mid-'70s," the time of the last severe slump in
Florida real estate.</p>
<p>Cheryl Swaim, a banking analyst with Oppenheimer & Co.,
said Southeast's loan portfolio is deteriorating faster than
she expected. In addition to the Florida real estate
problems, she said, Southeast added a $55 million leveraged
buy-out loan to its nonperforming category in the second
quarter. Before Friday, Ms. Swaim projected Southeast would
earn between 25 cents and 30 cents a share in the second
quarter and at least break even in 1990.</p>
<p>Mr. Zwick confirmed that Southeast added an LBO loan to
its nonperforming list in the period, but he wouldn't
elaborate on the size of the loan or provide any other
details. He said 70% to 75% of Southeast's nonperforming
assets are from real estate loans, with the rest from
commercial credit.</p>
<p>John J. Mason, a banking analyst with Interstate/Johnson
Lane, said he expects Southeast to record a roughly $50
million capital gain from the sale of its residential
mortgage unit, compared with the gross price of as much as
$100 million that Southeast said it should receive for the
assets. The difference reflects Southeast's hefty investment
in acquiring the mortgage subsidiary, said Mr. Mason. "They
paid real money for that company," he said.</p>
<p>Separately, Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered
its senior debt ratings for Southeast as well as the
company's commercial paper rating. The rating service also
said it downgraded the ratings of long-term and short-term
deposits of the company's Southeast Bank N.A. unit.</p>
<p>The changes affect about $375 million of debt.</p>
