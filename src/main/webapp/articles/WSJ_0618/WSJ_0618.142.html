	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- With Canada's constitutional crisis near the
boiling point, the Canadian dollar runs the risk of losing
some of its most loyal supporters in recent years: the
Japanese.
   Because of persistently high Canadian interest rates,
traders say, the Japanese have faithfully helped rescue the
Canadian dollar during hard times in the past -- even when
those high rates started to upset the economy. In the bond
market Friday, the 10-year Canadian government bond yielded
10.67%, well above the 8.44% yield on the equivalent U.S.
Treasury issue.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But some currency specialists say Canada's rates might
lose some of their appeal if the nation's political scene
gets any stormier. Manitoba and Newfoundland have yet to
approve the so-called Meech Lake accord that all 10 Canadian
provinces must ratify by Saturday. The accord, negotiated
three years ago at Meech Lake, Quebec, would recognize Quebec
as a "distinct society" within Canada. Quebec has threatened
to secede if the pact doesn't pass.</p>
<p>If the worst-case scenario is borne out and Quebec
announces a quest for independence, knee-jerk sales are
expected to jolt all of Canada's financial markets.</p>
<p>In the case of Japanese investment, however, more
worrisome is the possibility that capital flow from Japan
will dry up over the long run, leaving the Canadian dollar
particularly vulnerable, some analysts say.</p>
<p>There probably wouldn't be an "instant collapse" in
Japanese investment in the Canadian financial markets because
secession by Quebec would take a number of years, says Klaus
Pringsheim, president of the Canada-Japan Trade Council, an
independent, nonprofit organization in Ottawa.</p>
<p>"What will be affected," he says, "is the willingness to
put more" money into Canada.</p>
<p>Japanese portfolio investment in Canada totaled 40 billion
Canadian dollars (US$34.1 billion) last year while Japanese
direct investment in business ventures amounted to C$4.2
billion, says Mr. Pringsheim, adding that the level of direct
investment was up sharply from C$605 million in 1980 because
of strong interest in manufacturing and other sectors.</p>
<p>Although the level of American and British investment in
Canada has been greater than that of the Japanese in the last
few years, Japan's interest has been of "significant"
benefit, Mr. Pringsheim says.</p>
<p>Late Friday here, the Canadian dollar was quoted at 85.38
U.S. cents, marginally higher than 85.37 cents late Thursday.
In early January, the Canadian dollar rose above 86 cents and
traded at its highest levels in more than nine years.</p>
<p>The Canadian dollar plummeted to 83.79 U.S. cents May 22
after Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's chief Quebec political
lieutenant, Lucien Bouchard, resigned and worries about the
future of Quebec intensified. But it has firmed in jittery
dealings in the past few weeks, with traders watching each
new twist in the wrangling about the Meech Lake accord.</p>
<p>In the near term, it wouldn't be surprising to see a range
of 82 cents to 84 cents, Mr. Pringsheim says.</p>
<p>Relatively high interest rates can bolster a currency
because they draw buyers to investments denominated in the
unit, and they make yields attractive in the Eurocurrency
market. And some believe it will be hard to stem the hearty
appetite in Tokyo.</p>
<p>"Canada won't disappear" even if the political picture
isn't pretty, says Naota Kanemitsu, vice president of
treasury at Fuji Bank Canada in Toronto. "So far, the
interest rate differential {between Canadian and U.S. issues}
is very attractive. The return is a very, very good return."</p>
<p>Takeaki Misumi, treasurer at Sumitomo Bank of Canada in
Toronto, agrees. "The most important factor for Japanese
investors is the interest rate differential. It seems
Canadian interest rates aren't likely to go down so fast," he
says. But while Mr. Misumi is upbeat, he concedes that there
is growing Japanese interest in the financial markets of
other nations, including West Germany and Spain.</p>
<p>Even if the Japanese are seen buying the Canadian dollar
on any dips that may occur in coming weeks as Canada tries to
get its political act together, some analysts believe the
currency has a lot more troubles than Japanese purchases can
solve.</p>
<p>"The Canadians have got problems beyond Quebec," says
Roger Shields, chief international economist at Chemical
Bank. He and others say any remaining confidence in Canada's
economy may soon erode, because of sluggishness in a number
of sectors and the nation's shrinking merchandise trade
surplus. "A very low-growth economy" isn't very encouraging,
he says.</p>
<p>As for the U.S. dollar, continued jittery trading within a
range is deemed likely. Traders will be tracking interest
rates closely. Late Friday in New York, the dollar traded at
1.6875 marks and 153.90 yen, down from 1.6935 marks and
154.17 yen late Thursday.</p>
<p>In Tokyo Monday, the dollar was trading at 153.98 yen soon
after opening at 153.77 yen; it closed Friday in Tokyo at
154.52 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about
1.6880 marks, down from Friday's Tokyo close of 1.6938 marks.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold for
current delivery settled at $349.50 an ounce, up $2.70.
Estimated volume was a light 2.4 million ounces.</p>
