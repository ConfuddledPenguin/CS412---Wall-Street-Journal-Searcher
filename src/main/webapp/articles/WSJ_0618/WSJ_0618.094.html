	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Chicago investor Leon Greenblatt, who holds
a 9.9% stake in American Republic Bancorp, said in a filing
with the Securities and Exchange Commission that he plans to
ask the company to form a committee to consider alternatives
to enhance shareholder values.
   Bill Oberholzer, executive vice president of the Torrance,
Calif., bank holding company, said this is the first time
that Mr. Greenblatt, who has been a holder for about two
years, has formally made a proposal to the board.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We view him as someone with a good stake in the bank who
feels that the stock price is undervalued," Mr. Oberholzer
said. The stock has been trading at a small discount to its
book value. In national over-the-counter trading Friday, it
closed at $7.75, up 25 cents.</p>
