	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co. said
exports declined significantly in May from a year earlier,
although domestic sales and production rose.
   Officials of both companies attributed the continued drop
in exports to efforts to shift production overseas.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Exports by Toyota, Japan's largest auto manufacturer, fell
3.6% in May to 147,377 units, the second consecutive monthly
decline. A company official cited a downward trend in exports
to North America.</p>
<p>Toyota exports to the U.S. and Canada in May fell 11.6% to
68,319 units from a year earlier. Conversely, exports to the
Middle East rose 9.4% to 9,625 units, reflecting the region's
improving economy. Passenger car exports to the Middle East
jumped 12.5%, while exports to Europe rose 5.5%.</p>
<p>Nissan, Japan's second largest car maker, reported similar
results. It said exports in May fell for the ninth
consecutive month, declining 6% to 79,049 units.</p>
<p>Exports to Southeast Asia tumbled 29.7% to 6,399 units, a
Nissan official said, while exports to Europe fell 16.5% to
32,592 units.</p>
<p>Nissan's exports to the U.S. climbed 15% to 25,333 units,
but the company official said the rise was exaggerated. "The
volume remains consistent but the basis of comparison was
particularly low," she said.</p>
<p>Toyota's domestic sales rose 8.4% from last May to
194,203, marking the 14th consecutive monthly increase. It
said the total represented a new high for the month, topping
the previous record of 179,165 units set in 1989.</p>
<p>Total domestic market share held by Toyota slipped one
percentage point to 32%.</p>
<p>Sales of Toyota's passenger cars rose 5.8% to 144,479
units, while sales of trucks and buses rose 16.6% to 49,724
units.</p>
<p>Nissan's domestic sales grew 5.6% in May to 103,424,
putting its domestic market share for May at 23.3%, down 0.1
percentage point from May 1989.</p>
<p>Nissan's sales of passenger cars rose 4.2% to 77,145
units, a record for the month. Truck and bus sales rose 9.9%
to 26,279 units.</p>
<p>Toyota's overall production rose 9.1% to 357,503 units
last month, a record for the month of May. Overseas
production soared 58.7% to to 60,447 units. A breakdown of
output showed an 11.7% increase in passenger cars, to
284,173, while trucks and buses slipped 0.1% to 73,330 units.</p>
<p>Nissan's overall production rose 6.5% to 252,173 units
last month, with domestic output rising 10.7% to 196,666
units.</p>
<p>Overseas production by Nissan fell from a year earlier for
the second consecutive month, an indication that Nissan Motor
Manufacturing Corp. (U.S.) and Nissan Motor Manufacturing
(U.K.) Ltd. are set to release new models, the company said.</p>
<p>Nissan produced 161,162 passenger cars in May, up 10.6%,
and 35,504 trucks and buses, up 11.3%.</p>
