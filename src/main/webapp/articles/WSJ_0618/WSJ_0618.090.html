	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Drought-conscious bureaucrats in Southern
California are employing the latest in electronic
surveillance to identify businesses that use too much water.
   The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California is
using pictures from a Landsat satellite circling 450 miles
above the Earth to determine areas of excessive water use.
Computer analysis of the photographs will measure infrared
light waves from plants, with the wettest areas appearing in
bright red. The analysis is being provided under an agreement
between the water district and Terra-Mar Resource Information
Services Inc., Mountain View, Calif.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Homeowners needn't worry just yet about overwatering their
lawns, however. Measurements will only be taken for large
landscaped areas such as golf courses, cemeteries, parks and
big residential projects, as the satellite can only pick up
areas about as big as a football field, a spokesman for the
water district said.</p>
<p>While the district won't be nabbing water gluttons, "this
data is essential for determining potential water savings in
urban landscaping and will be used in developing future water
conservation programs," says Carl Boronkay, general manager
of the water district, which provides more than half the
water used by 15 million people living in Los Angeles,
Ventura, Orange, San Diego, Riverside and San Bernardino
counties. The information will also be used in state water
allocation hearings.</p>
