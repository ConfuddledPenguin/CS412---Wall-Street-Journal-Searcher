	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Export Import Bank approved a $19.3
million grant and a $35.9 million loan guarantee for an
electric power plant project in Uruguay.
   The Ex-Im Bank said it dipped into its tied-aid "war
chest" for the grant after the French government offered a
similar subsidy in an effort to win the equipment contracts
for French suppliers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>General Electric Co. will supply gas turbines and other
equipment for the power station from its factories in
Schenactady, N.Y., and Greenville, S.C.</p>
<p>The guarantee will be on a loan provided by the Private
Export Funding Corp., New York, which is backed by a group of
U.S. commercial banks and other private financial
institutions.</p>
