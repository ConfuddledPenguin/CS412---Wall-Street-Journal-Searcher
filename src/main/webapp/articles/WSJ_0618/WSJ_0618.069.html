	<p class="article-leader">MEXICO CITY -- Shareholders of Telefonos de Mexico
approved a recapitalization plan that should pave the way for
the state-controlled Mexican telephone monopoly's
privatization.
   The recapitalization, which includes a stock dividend of
new, limited-voting shares, is designed to reduce the size of
the investment a buyer will need to obtain operating control
of the company, Mexican officials said. Under the plan,
full-voting shares will be reduced to just 40% of the total
shares oustanding; the buyer will need to obtain the majority
of only the full-voting shares to gain operating control. The
government currently holds an interest of slightly more than
50% in Telmex.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The new capital structure was approved by 87% of
shareholders at a special meeting Friday afternoon. In New
York, amid investor nervousness over the plan, Telmex's
American depositary receipts were the most actively traded
stock on the Nasdaq, closing at $1.53 bid, down 18 cents.
Under the plan, Telmex will use $230 million in accumulated
earnings to issue a dividend of 1.5 shares of new Class L
stock for each share held. The Class L shares will have
limited voting rights.</p>
<p>Of the 40% of shares outstanding with full voting rights,
slightly more than half will be held by the government. A
group seeking operating control of Telmex would have to pay
roughly $1.5 billion for the government's full voting shares,
based on recent market prices.</p>
