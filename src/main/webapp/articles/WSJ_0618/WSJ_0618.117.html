	<p class="article-leader">American Healthcare Management Inc., which emerged from
bankruptcy-law proceedings less than six months ago, said it
retained First Boston Corp. to evaluate additional capital
restructuring alternatives.
   Chief Executive Steven L. Volla, in a news release, said
the Dallas health-care firm's reorganization plan was based
on overly optimistic assumptions. The release noted that
further restructuring is needed to reduce the financial risk
of the current "highly leveraged capital structure."</p>

further explanation.</p>
<p>American Healthcare, which owns or leases 17 hospitals in
10 states, sought protection from creditors in August 1987.
It completed its reorganization at the end of 1989 by issuing
15.2 million new shares of common stock to creditors and
shareholders and by issuing new debt.</p>
