	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The A.C. Nielsen Co., whose audience ratings
methodology is harshly criticized by the three major
broadcast networks, is about to get new competition: AGB
Television Research, a British-based ratings company owned by
Robert Maxwell, the British media conglomerate owner.
   The AGB plan is only one of several expected from research
companies as the networks seek alternatives to the Nielsen
measurement system. For example, the Arbitron Co. is testing
a sophisticated system in Denver, titled ScanAmerica, that
connects product purchasing with the viewing of television
commercials.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>AGB challenged Nielsen, a division of Dun & Bradstreet
Corp., in the 1980s, but lost $67 million after only CBS Inc.
paid for the service. Capital Cities/ABC Inc. and National
Broadcasting Co., a unit of General Electric Co., declined to
participate in AGB's attempt to take on Nielsen's monopoly in
measuring the American television audience. AGB shut down its
American subsidiary in August 1988.</p>
<p>AGB's move, which is expected to be announced today, is
the latest salvo in the increasingly bitter dispute between
the three networks and Nielsen, which earns a combined $15
million annually from the networks for suppling ratings data
on which advertising rates and the fates of prime-time series
are decided.</p>
<p>Each network alleges that Nielsen's ratings based on the
so-called people meter, an electronic device with
push-buttons, are inaccurate. For ratings to register, an
individual must press a button on the people meter each time
a program is viewed. The networks say the audience easily
tires of such an exercise.</p>
<p>The networks have openly encouraged other companies,
domestic or foreign, to take on Nielsen, and they said they
will pay for the service.</p>
<p>"We welcome the competition," said David F. Poltrack, a
CBS senior vice president.</p>
<p>Mr. Poltrack said he didn't expect AGB, a subsidiary of
Audits of Great Britain, will be able to have a service
operational until September 1992. "We anticipate the 1991-92
television season as a year of experimentation for AGB," he
said.</p>
<p>A Nielsen spokesman said: "We welcome the challenge. We've
competed before, we'll compete again. We'll compete with
anybody. Competition is nothing new to us."</p>
<p>AGB pioneered the people meter system in Britain. It was
AGB's arrival in the American market that forced Nielsen to
quickly switch to people meters from handwritten diaries. AGB
supplied ratings during the 1987-88 television season.</p>
<p>Although he declined specific comment, another network
executive said Mr. Poltrack was briefed by AGB officials
Friday about how AGB's system would differ from Nielsen's.
"Clearly the industry does not need a copy cat approach to
Nielsen," he said.</p>
<p>For example, AGB will remove an individual or family from
its survey if it discovers that the household has stopped
using the people meter. Nielsen doesn't turn over its sample
of 4,000 people meter households for two years.</p>
<p>Nielsen recently challenged AGB for the British market.
But AGB prevailed in intense bidding. "We came a lot closer
than anyone expected," said a Nielsen official. Nielsen is
used in other overseas markets, including Australia.</p>
<p>The controversy with Nielsen deepened recently when
Nielsen data showed television network viewing plunging by 7%
in the first quarter. Neither the networks nor Nielsen could
explain the sharp drop, which resulted in the networks giving
back millions of dollars in free ad time to advertisers.
Sponsors receive free commercial time, or "make goods," when
audience viewing levels fall below those guaranteed by the
networks.</p>
<p>All three networks said last week that they will no longer
give advertisers traditional audience guarantees. Instead,
the networks said, they will adopt a plan presented by NBC
last week. That plan uses an eight-year audience average to
project ratings, instead of relying exclusively on Nielsen
ratings.</p>
<p>The moves come as the television and advertising
industries prepare for the projected $4.4 billion up-front
market, when advertising is sold in advance of the 1990-91
season, which begins in September.</p>
