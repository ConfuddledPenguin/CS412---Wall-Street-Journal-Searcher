	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- William Farley's troubles with red ink may be
spilling over into his dealings with printer's ink.
   R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co. has sued the investor for $2.5
million in unpaid bills arising from his troubled takeover of
West Point-Pepperell Inc. The Chicago-based printing concern
says Mr. Farley hasn't paid for the massive amount of
financial printing he ran up during his protracted $1.56
billion tender offer for the West Point, Ga.-based textile
company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Farley has been unable to complete the purchase of the
5% of West Point-Pepperell shares he doesn't own and is said
to be considering offers for his majority stake from other
investors in order to raise cash.</p>
<p>Mr. Farley's difficulties have mounted in the wake of the
collapse of his investment banker, Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., earlier this year. His closely held Farley Inc. had a
pretax loss of about $40 million in 1989, analysts estimated.</p>
<p>Farley spokesmen couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
