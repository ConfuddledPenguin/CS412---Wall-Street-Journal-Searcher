	<p class="article-leader">CUYAHOGA HEIGHTS, Ohio -- American Steel & Wire Corp.
declared a special dividend of $3.25 a share after completion
of a $95 million borrowing.
   The dividend, the steel producer's first since it went
public in 1988, is payable June 29 to stock of record June
24.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company said the dividend will consume about $27
million of the borrowed funds. Slightly more than that will
be used to refinance debt, the company said, with the
remainder available for capital expenditures, working capital
and other corporate purposes.</p>
<p>In late April, American Steel said it might pay a dividend
of as much as $4.25 a share when the financing was completed.
However, sales have been picking up, making it advisable to
retain more of the borrowed funds for improving facilities
and working capital, said C.V. Meserole III, executive vice
president and chief financial officer.</p>
<p>Directors decided to use borrowed funds to pay a special
dividend to shareholders, who haven't fared as well in the
stock market as they might have expected when they bought the
stock at $9 a share in the 1988 initial offering, Mr.
Meserole said. The stock closed Friday at $6.25, up 25 cents,
in over-the-counter trading.</p>
<p>The lending institutions include Security Pacific Business
Credit Inc., Sanwa Business Credit Corp., State Bank of South
Australia and Cigna Investments Inc., American Steel said.</p>
