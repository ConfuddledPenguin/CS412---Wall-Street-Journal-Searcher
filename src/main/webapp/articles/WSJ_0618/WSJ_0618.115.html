	<p class="article-leader">DONALD TRUMP'S debt includes more than $500 million in
bank loans that he personally guaranteed, bankers say.
Lenders are increasingly seeking the liquidation of most of

believed to fall well short of the amount the developer has
borrowed. Trump missed $73 million in debt payments that were
due Friday.
