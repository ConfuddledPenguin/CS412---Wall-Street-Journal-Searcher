	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The creditors' committee of Drexel Burnham
Lambert Group Inc. has begun taking depositions of company
employees to determine whether any improprieties occurred in
the company's controversial bonus payments.
   The committee also is conducting fact-finding interviews
of current and former Drexel officials about transactions
involving gold loaned to Drexel by foreign central banks. The
central banks are estimated to have lost more than $500
million in the deals, in which Drexel paid them interest for
use of the gold as capital.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Robert T. Ladd, an executive vice president of First City,
Texas-Houston who represents the bank on the committee, said
about 50 former and current officials will be questioned in
the next two months. Also under investigation are
partnerships in which Drexel employees benefited from selling
securities underwritten by the company. First City,
Texas-Houston, is the main banking unit of First City
Bancorp. The officials to be questioned include Drexel
President Frederick Joseph and Richard Wright, chief
financial officer.</p>
<p>Under an order signed Friday by U.S. bankruptcy court
Judge Howard Buschman III, the committee's findings will be
part of a disclosure statement to be released about Dec. 10
that will also include proposals for Drexel's reorganization.</p>
<p>Mr. Ladd said the investigation could turn up hundreds of
millions of dollars that may be recoverable under bankruptcy
law. He said the committee is focusing on whether Drexel
acted imprudently in granting the bonuses and entering into
the other transactions just months before filing for
bankruptcy-law protection. The creditors have said they won't
seek to recover the bonuses if the liquidation of Drexel's
assets covers its liabilities. Drexel filed under Chapter 11
of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on Feb. 13.</p>
<p>Drexel has said there was nothing improper about the bonus
payments, the gold transactions or the partnerships.</p>
<p>If the committee finds any improprieties, the report could
give weight to the creditors' demand that current Drexel
management be ousted in the reorganization. Drexel and the
creditors have until mid-November to come up with a
consensual reorganization plan, but the two sides are far
apart in their negotiations.</p>
<p>In the order issued by Judge Buschman in federal
bankruptcy court in Manhattan, the committee has until Oct.
31 to analyze potential steps that could be taken to go after
the bonuses or other payments. The depositions must be
completed by Sept. 15.</p>
<p>The judge also ordered that the value of Drexel's
portfolio of securities be analyzed by Sept. 15. The order
sets Feb. 28, 1991, as the goal for getting a reorganization
plan approved.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Drexel said the order sets forth "a
reasonable time frame to accomplish what we have to
accomplish, which is to get a consensual plan that is fair to
creditors and to shareholders." He added that the judge's
order doesn't give the creditors any investigative authority
they didn't already have.</p>
