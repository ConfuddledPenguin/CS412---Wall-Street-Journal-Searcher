	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Amoco Corp. said the settlement for about $600
million of all claims and counterclaims between it and Iran
will result in an undetermined second-quarter gain.
   The company said it expects to receive by the end of June
a net payment of about $594 million but that the gain will be
offset by income taxes and a charge that will also be booked
in the second quarter. The amount of the charge is
undetermined, in line with the completion of a study under
which the company has targeted specific worksites for
environmental cleanup.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the year-earlier quarter, the energy concern had net
income of $497 million, or 96 cents a share, on revenue of
$6.76 billion.</p>
<p>The settlement ends Amoco's claims for compensation for
the seizure by Iran of its two major Iranian operations in
1978 and 1979. In Washington, U.S. officials said the
settlement wouldn't have any direct bearing on the chances of
gaining release of the six U.S. hostages still held by
pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon. "It's really not related,"
said a senior State Department official, pointing out that
Iran will be paying money, not receiving it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Bush administration privately hopes that
such progress at The Hague, and the promise of more, will
help induce economically strapped Iran to prod the Lebanese
kidnappers into fresh releases. President Bush has adopted a
policy of making whatever gestures appear reasonable in their
own right -- such as working to clear up claims -- and hoping
Tehran interprets them as favorable gestures.</p>
<p>However, claims settlements so far seem to have had little
impact on the hostage problem. After a series of claims
settlements last month, no hostages were released, and Iran's
line even seemed to harden. Tehran and its allies are
demanding the release of Shiite prisoners from Israel and
Kuwait before any more hostages are released, and anti-U.S.
feelings have been rising in the Middle East lately as the
war of words against Israel has heated up.</p>
