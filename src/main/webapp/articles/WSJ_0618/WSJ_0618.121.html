	<p class="article-leader">The Securities and Exchange Commission and a congressional
subcommittee are looking into reorganizations of public
limited-partnerships called "roll-ups" to see if they are
fair to investors.
   The SEC said it initiated a staff inquiry after receiving
complaints from some limited partners involved in the
reorganizations earlier this year. An SEC spokeswoman
wouldn't discuss details of the inquiry and said the agency
won't make the results public.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Rep. Edward J. Markey (D. Mass.), chairman of the House
Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance, told SEC
Chairman Richard C. Breeden this past week, however, that the
subcommittee will conduct hearings on roll-ups next month.
The subcommittee, which deals with securities issues, has
asked the SEC for answers by July 13 to an extensive list of
questions the agency has about the reorganizations.</p>
<p>Roll-ups already in progress or planned by syndicators
will affect an estimated 146,000 investors who put about $1.2
billion into limited partnerships, Rep. Markey said in a
letter to Mr. Breeden. "The subcommittee is generally
concerned that individual investors haven't been well-served
by such reorganizations in the past and that regulatory or
legislative changes may be necessary to assure that limited
partners are treated fairly in future roll-ups."</p>
<p>In a roll-up, several non-traded limited partnerships --
typically including some healthy ones and some that aren't --
are consolidated into new, publicly traded investments.
Limited partners usually approve the reorganization to gain
liquidity.</p>
<p>But often, the supposed exchange value of their interests
is far below the price the market puts on the new units when
they begin trading. Most roll-ups so far have involved real
estate partnerships or those that invested in oil and gas.</p>
<p>Many analysts expect a wave of the reorganizations because
of the large number of syndicators that are financially
troubled. A roll-up effectively transforms limited
partnerships, which have a finite life of about 10 years,
into an open-ended investment that continues to generate
management fees for the general partner.</p>
<p>The subcommittee has asked the SEC for ways to mitigate
such conflicts of interest, suggesting that establishing an
independent board of trustees might be one remedy. The panel
has also requested that the agency evaluate whether the SEC's
current disclosure rules on roll-ups and the legal remedies
available to investors are adequate.</p>
