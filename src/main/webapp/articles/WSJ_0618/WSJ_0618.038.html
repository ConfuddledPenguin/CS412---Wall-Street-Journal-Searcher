	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Small investors can sometimes punish their
brokers in court even when they make big bucks.
   At least that's the message from the Eighth U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in St. Paul, Minn. In a 3-0 decision, the
court Friday upheld a $2 million punitive damage award
against Merrill Lynch & Co. in an unusual excessive-trading
case involving the account of a deceased widow.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Merrill, the nation's largest securities firm, says it is
"greatly disappointed" with the decision, and may appeal. One
reason: The investor's account actually rose 50% during the
time of the complaint, Merrill Lynch says.</p>
<p>It's rare that investors are awarded punitive damages when
they haven't suffered monetary losses, securities lawyers
say. "It's extraordinary," says Sam Scott Miller, a former
general counsel at PaineWebber Group Inc. and currently a
partner at Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe in New York.</p>
<p>Punitive damages are generally awarded to punish and deter
a defendant found to have acted recklessly or maliciously.
(Most cases involving punitive damages occur when investors'
nest eggs have been depleted.) Punitive damages are applied
in addition to awards intended to compensate for actual
injury or loss.</p>
<p>The award for the estate of Ethlyn Davis, the investor,
also included $100,000 in compensatory damages. Merrill Lynch
said the $2.1 million total has been "previously reserved
for." A federal jury awarded the amount in Sioux Falls, S.D.,
in August 1988.</p>
<p>In court papers, Mrs. Davis alleged that from February
1982 to August 1984 former Merrill Lynch broker Steven Ulrich
"churned" her account, which had an average balance of
$144,000, by making 141 trades totaling $2 million. Churning
is excessive trading in a customer's account by a broker
solely to generate commissions.</p>
<p>Despite the heavy trading, Merrill says in court papers
that the account actually made a net profit of more than
$53,000. But the appellate panel, in a 42-page decision,
said: "The gravity of the wrong committed by Merrill Lynch is
not mitigated by the fact that the account was nevertheless
profitable."</p>
<p>Mr. Ulrich was terminated in August 1984 after other
customers complained of unauthorized trading in their
accounts, a Merrill Lynch spokesman says. Mrs. Davis died in
November 1986 at age 91.</p>
<p>Arlo Sommervold, a lawyer for Mrs. Davis's estate, says
Mr. Ulrich should have made much more for his client,
contending that stocks were rising for much of the time the
alleged excessive trading took place. He says punitive
damages were justified.</p>
<p>"You can't rob a bank and then, if they catch you, just
give the money back and everyone's even," Mr. Sommervold
says. "She's entitled to all the money she should have
earned."</p>
