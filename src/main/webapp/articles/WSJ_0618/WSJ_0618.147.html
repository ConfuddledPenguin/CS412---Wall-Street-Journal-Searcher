	<p class="article-leader">Ford Motor Co., for the first time in three years,
announced broad, midyear price increases ranging from $58 to
$134 on many of its cars and trucks.
   The move is unusual because U.S. auto makers have
generally avoided midyear, base-price increases for the past
few years. Also, the U.S. auto market has been relatively
soft since February. Sales of Ford's cars and trucks fell 14%
in May from a year-earlier levels.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the No. 2 auto maker needed to raise base prices on
most 1990 models and one 1991 model "to partially offset
increases in ongoing operating costs and product-related
costs," Robert L. Rewey, vice president-North American sales
operations, said in a statement.</p>
<p>In March, Ford raised option prices by an average of $29.
A month later, General Motors Corp. also boosted option
prices. Neither GM nor Chrysler Corp. have announced any
broad vehicle base-price increases, however. Ford said it
didn't change option prices in its latest action.</p>
<p>The increase in base prices for cars, which took effect
Friday, averages $49, or three-tenths of one percent. The
boost in truck prices averages $95, or six-tenths of one
percent. Ford didn't cut prices on any models, a spokesman
said.</p>
<p>The largest increase came on the new 1991 Ford Explorer
sport utility vehicle, which was introduced only last March
with a base price of $19,015. Ford raised Explorer's base
price 0.7% or $134 to $19,149.</p>
<p>Explorer has sold well since March, but another new Ford
product, the redesigned Escort subcompact, hasn't. Combined
sales of the new Escort and the model it replaces were off
17.2% in May; Ford didn't change price on either version.
Base prices for the Mercury Tracer, introduced June 14, and
the Mercury Capri, due out in July, were also unchanged. "We
felt it wasn't necessary" with the newer models, the Ford
spokesman said.</p>
<p>Ford also didn't raise prices on other, less-popular
products including 1990 Ford Ranger compact pickup truck, the
1990 Ford Probe sporty car and the Festiva subcompact. "Those
vehicles aren't selling as well," the Ford spokesman said. A
price hike could further dampen sales that already "need
stimulation."</p>
<p>The biggest price jump on passenger cars came on Ford's
top three luxury models. The base prices of the 1990 Lincoln
Town Car, Continental and Mark VII all rose by $122. The new
price for the Town Car is $28,110; for the Continental,
$29,546; and for the Mark VII, $29,369.</p>
<p>Sales of the Town Car during the first five months of the
year have been stronger than the Continental and Mark VII,
showing a 39.1% increase during the period.</p>
<p>The smallest price increase, $58, came on the two-door
Ford Tempo GL, now $9,541, the Mustang LX sedan, $9,514; and
the two-door Topaz GS, $10,065.</p>
