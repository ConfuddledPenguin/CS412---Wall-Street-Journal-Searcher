	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Major industrial nations are close to
agreement on a new set of international rules to remove
trade-related restrictions on private direct-investment flows
from one country to another.
   But a group of Third World nations, led by India, Brazil
and Egypt, is balking over accepting such an accord during
the Uruguay Round of world trade negotiations in Geneva.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The U.S., European Community and Japan have conceded that
developing nations need a longer transitional period than the
industrial nations to get rid of "domestic-content"
requirements and other laws and regulations that impede
direct private-investment inflows.</p>
<p>This debate continues among member countries of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade even as barriers to
international investment flows are coming down all over the
world.</p>
<p>Moreover, spokesmen for Third World countries are
expressing concern that many countries in Latin America, Asia
and Africa may be left behind as multinational corporations,
commercial bankers and international lending agencies
concentrate on the urgent needs of Eastern and Central
European countries for loans and private investment to
support their economic reforms.</p>
<p>By late July, governments participating in the Geneva
trade negotiations are supposed to complete the basic
outlines of a big package of new agreements to liberalize
world trade, so that these accords can be completed by the
end of this year.</p>
<p>GATT officials and others are confident that an agreement
to eliminate trade-related international investment
restrictions will be approved this year, although there are
serious questions to be resolved among major nations and
developing countries on agricultural-trade reforms, textiles
and other issues.</p>
<p>U.S. "Open-Door" Investment Policy: Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady and others in Washington maintain that the
U.S. market is wide open to foreign investments.</p>
<p>Yet there is considerable sentiment in Congress for
closing this door a bit on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>Recently, the House voted to relax antitrust laws for U.S.
companies undertaking joint manufacturing as well as
research-and-development ventures, but not for any U.S.
company controlled 30% or more by foreign investors.</p>
<p>The Bush administration favors the thrust of the
legislation but not the discrimination against U.S.
affiliates of foreign companies, according to Treasury
Department officials.</p>
<p>The Senate soon may consider a similar bill to ease
antitrust laws without discriminating against foreign
investors. It's uncertain, however, whether any such
legislation will reach the enactment stage this year.</p>
<p>Also pending on Capitol Hill is a proposal that would
allow the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis
to tap the "confidential" data banks of other government
units to help pull together a clearer statistical picture of
foreign investment in various segments of the U.S. economy.
This legislation wouldn't put any new reporting burdens on
foreign-controlled companies and therefore is considered to
be relatively noncontroversial.</p>
<p>Hills Shelves Trade Sanctions: U.S. Trade Representative
Carla Hills says India's restrictions on U.S. investors and
insurance companies, which can't do business in that country,
are "unreasonable."</p>
<p>But she says it would be "inappropriate" for the U.S. to
impose economic sanctions on India under the "Super-301"
provisions of the 1988 Trade Act because of the continuing
negotiations in world trade talks in Geneva to remove
government restrictions on investments and services.</p>
<p>She warned last week, however, that the U.S. could relight
the fuse on this "Super-301" trade complaint if such action
is "warranted" after the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade
negotiations is completed late this year.</p>
<p>British, Japanese Investors: According to the Commerce
Department, British and Japanese companies were the leading
foreign investors in the U.S. last year in establishing or
acquiring U.S. companies.</p>
<p>The total for such direct investment from all foreign
countries was about $64.6 billion. British investors
accounted for about $22 billion; Japan ranked second with
about $14.9 billion.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department says the Japanese have been
investing in various manufacturing companies and U.S. real
estate. By the end of last year, the report adds, most big
U.S. producers of steel "had embarked upon at least one joint
venture with a Japanese steel manufacturer."</p>
<p>Australia Gets a Seat at the Table: What used to be known
as the "Quad" group of agricultural ministers, representing
the U.S., Canada, Japan and the EC in discussions of
international trade issues, is now known as the "Quint."</p>
<p>Australia joined this group late last year.</p>
<p>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter says the second
meeting of the "Quint" group will be held in Ireland at the
end of next month.</p>
<p>Australia and Canada also are participants in the
so-called Cairns group, a larger group of countries that are
important exporters of agricultural products. They would like
to see reductions in the agricultural-export subsidies of the
U.S. and the EC.</p>
<p>Vietnam Opening: President Bush is being urged by some
business leaders to lift U.S. economic sanctions on Vietnam.</p>
<p>Last week, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce told the White
House that U.S. rules barring trade with Vietnam are "no
longer necessary" and damage the competitive position of U.S.
companies doing business in Asia.</p>
<p>On Cuba, which also has long been cut off from normal
trade relations with the U.S., Mr. Bush has said that he
isn't ready to consider changes in the economic sanctions
against that country.</p>
