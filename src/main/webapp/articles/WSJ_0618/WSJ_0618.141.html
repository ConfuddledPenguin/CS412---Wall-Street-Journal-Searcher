	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The few investors who were hoping the Federal
Reserve would soon push interest rates lower are abandoning
that view and now are hoping the Fed will ease later this
summer.
   But these investors may be missing the point. According to
some international bond-market analysts, investors should
stop crying about the Fed and start focusing on the bigger
problem: even if the Fed did ease access to credit, rate
reductions might not stick because the U.S. is about to enter
a heated world-wide competition for investors' money.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The reduced hope of Fed easing was evident in the bond
market Friday when prices dropped nearly one point, or $10
for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The sell-off was
triggered by news that industrial production rose 0.6% in
May, indicating that recent declines in manufacturing have
ended and that production is beginning to pick up again.
Another report, the consumer price index, confirmed that
inflation is slowing, but that the rate of progress has been
painfully slow.</p>
<p>The industrial-production reports, when viewed along with
an index of business activity issued earlier this month by
the National Association of Purchasing Management, "seem to
be saying that the worst is over in manufacturing and
activity is stabilizing," said Norman Robertson, chief
economist at Mellon Bank Corp. "The inflation numbers were
generally favorable, but I don't think they are good enough
to trigger an easing of Fed policy."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, international analysts see pressures abroad
that could make it more costly for the U.S. government to
borrow money and thereby drive up interest rates.</p>
<p>These investors contend that recent declines in U.S. bond
yields have made the Treasury market less attractive to
foreign investors. They say that cash is already being
diverted away from the U.S. in favor of Europe and Japan.</p>
<p>"In the competition for international savings, countries
with the highest level of rates will have an advantage," said
Hung Q. Tran, director of fixed-income research for Deutsche
Bank Group, Frankfurt.</p>
<p>Currently, yields on U.S. Treasury securities are about
8.4% compared with 8.9% in West Germany and 11.3% in Britain.</p>
<p>With rates in the U.S. trailing rates in other countries
while U.S. inflation remains higher than in West Germany and
Japan, "it's hard to justify lower U.S. yields," said Mr.
Tran.</p>
<p>Another factor that will keep interest rates from falling
is the sheer size of the government's future cash needs.</p>
<p>Lacy Hunt, economist at Carroll McEntee & McGinley Inc., a
primary dealer of government bonds, estimates that the
government raised $31 billion in new cash in the second
quarter, which is $19 billion more than expected. He said
government borrowings in the third quarter could raise more
than $70 billion, more than double the amount of new cash
raised in the third quarter a year ago. He said the
additional funds are needed to finance the Resolution Trust
Corp., the federal thrift bailout agency.</p>
<p>"This sum of money will constitute a very significant test
for the U.S. financial markets," said Mr. Hunt, because while
the U.S. is tapping the debt market, West Germany will also
be vying for investors as it begins to raise billions of
dollars to finance reunification with East Germany.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, bond yields in West Germany surpassed
rates in the U.S. for the first time in more than a decade.
Mr. Hunt says this situation could give West Germany an edge
over the U.S. Even if the West German bond auctions don't
siphon money from Treasurys, he says the U.S. market will
become "sensitive to world-wide pressures."</p>
<p>The Treasury market may find itself in competition with
Britain and Japan, too.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, a flood of foreign cash has swamped the
British bond market due to speculation that the Britain pound
will soon enter the European Monetary System's exchange-rate
mechanism. Joining EMS could be good for gilts because it
would help to stabilize the pound, force Britain to contain
inflation and lead eventually to lower interest rates.</p>
<p>The prospects that Britain could soon join EMS triggered
one of the strongest rallies in the market's recent history.
The price of Britain's benchmark bond 11.75% issue due in
2007 has risen more than eight points in the past five weeks
while the issue's yield has slid to 11.30% from 12.25%,
according to James Capel & Co., London.</p>
<p>According to Geoffrey Dennis, chief international
economist at James Capel, "a lot of overseas" investors were
big buyers of the British bonds, known as gilts. Mr. Dennis
said the opportunity for investors to earn high current
yields on British gilts, with limited currency risk, "is a
situation where investors feel this is too good an
opportunity to miss."</p>
<p>Mr. Tran at Deutsche Bank said that many of the investors
rushing to put money in the British market were from Japan
and the Middle East, especially Saudi Arabia. In recent
months, the Saudis have been selling large amounts of gold
and using the proceeds to buy British bonds, and to a smaller
degree, U.S. bonds.</p>
<p>"Middle Eastern investors are moving away from physical
assets. They like high-yielding bond markets like in Britain
because with the prospects of the pound moving into EMS the
high yields are more attractive and the currency risk will
diminish," said Mr. Tran. Currencies in EMS trade within
specified trading bands. A band limits how far one currency
can trade away from its assigned level without prompting a
change in monetary policy.</p>
<p>Japanese investors, who also have been big buyers of U.S.
Treasury securities in the past, seem to be losing interest
in the U.S. market in favor of Europe and their own market.</p>
<p>Daniel Ceto, an economist at Nikko Securities Co., said
that Japanese investors have sold more U.S. Treasury
securities this year than they have purchased. He said this
trend is likely to continue into the third quarter, which
could cause "some difficulties" for the Treasurys, he said.</p>
<p>No one expects foreign investors to completely ignore the
U.S. Treasury market. After all, Treasurys still are
considered the safest and most liquid market in the world and
the U.S. designation as the No. 1 "safe haven" remains
intact. And with political uncertainties abroad, some foreign
investors are likely to find the U.S. attractive.</p>

<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>Bond prices fell sharply after the government reported
that industrial production in May was stronger than expected.</p>
<p>Industrial output rose 0.6% compared with the 0.4%
economists expected, dashing hopes that the Federal Reserve
would ease monetary policy in the near term. The government
also revised April's industrial production to show the rate
as unchanged instead of the previously estimated 0.4%
decline.</p>
<p>"The hard fact is that the economy is still expanding, and
people didn't like that," said Robert Chandross, a vice
president and economist at Lloyds Bank PLC.</p>
<p>The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of
103 15/32 to yield 8.42% compared with 104 11/32 to yield
8.34% on Thursday. The benchmark bond was down a full point
by midday, but retraced some of their declines on late
position-squaring, dealers said.</p>
<p>Other economic news -- the consumer price index report and
the merchandise trade deficit -- had little effect on bond
prices.</p>
<p>A major focus in the corporate bond market was Chrysler
Corp. Although the auto maker's bonds were reeling from a
sweeping downgrade of its debt, Chrysler's financing unit
braved the public debt market with a $300 million debt issue.</p>
<p>Chrysler Financial offered investors two-year notes that
were priced to yield 10.33% -- two percentage points higher
than yields on two-year Treasury notes. The transaction was
managed by First Boston Corp. and Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets.</p>
<p>The debt offering comes one day after Standard & Poor's
Corp. downgraded certain Chrysler debt and several days after
Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it is reviewing the
ratings of $22.28 billion of debt of Chrysler and its units
for possible downgrading.</p>
<p>In an unusual twist, underwriters led by First Boston
Corp. offered investors a unique form of bondholder
protection.</p>
<p>Essentially, investors can sell the notes back to the
company at the offering price if Chrysler's debt rating is
downgraded by Moody's to below investment grade. The feature,
called a put option, applies during the current review of
Chrysler Financial debt by Moody's.</p>
<p>"This kind of put has never been done before," said
Richard duBusc, managing director and head of syndicate at
First Boston Corp. Mr. duBusc said that about 60% of the
Chrysler issue was already sold. Insurance companies, banks
and money managers were among the prime buyers of the notes.</p>
<p>On Thursday, underwriters at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
were forced to pull a $100 million issue of Chrysler
Financial five-year notes, market sources said.</p>
<p>The note issue was targeted to be priced at a spread of
1.10 percentage points above the Treasury's five-year note
but was withdrawn in the wake of the Moody's credit review
announcement Wednesday and S&P's anticipated action.</p>
<p>In the junk-bond market, prices ended mixed Friday. Most
bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc. rose sharply with the pay-in-kind
bond advancing between 1 3/4 points and 1 5/8 points. PIK
bonds pay interest in the form of additional securities.</p>
<p>The junk bonds of casinos operated by developer Donald
Trump were sharply lower on news that until negotiations
between Mr. Trump and his bankers are completed, interest and
principal payments due on Trump Castle bonds won't be made.</p>
<p>Trump Castle Funding's 13.75% first-mortgage bonds due in
1997 ended three points lower at 55 1/2 in over-the-counter
trading. The Trump Taj Mahal 14% first-mortgage bonds, due in
1998, slipped 1 1/2 points to end at 54 on the American Stock
Exchange while Trump Plaza Funding's 12 7/8%, due in 1998,
were unchanged at 80.</p>
