	<p class="article-leader">A woman named Florica Ichim is hiding for her life in an
apartment on Petre Cretu Street in Bucharest. Florica Ichim
is the executive editor of Romania Libera, until last week
Romania's biggest opposition daily. Wednesday, Romania Libera
was still printing 1.5 million copies. Early Thursday, its
own printers -- doubtless pushed by the government -- arrived
at the paper's door and beat up the only person around to
greet them -- the receptionist. Then they took clubs to
Romania Libera's printing presses and ransacked editors'
offices. Next arrived vandals who called themselves miners
from the countryside. Their leader told a frightened staffer,
"Romania Libera will not be printed anymore."
   President-elect Ion Iliescu made this sudden surge of
government-initiated brutality official when, in a public
speech, he deemed the Romanian press responsible for the
anti-government uprising that has shaken the capital in past
days. Strangers have already appeared at the doors of Mrs.
Ichim's colleagues with trumped-up excuses for house
searches.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The repression, of course, goes beyond Romania Libera, or
the press in general. Crowds looted offices of opposition
parties and systematically beat up pedestrians. A
photocopying machine at the office of the opposition Liberal
Party was presented on television as evidence that the party
was running a counterfeit operation. Leaders of another
party, the Peasant Party -- a group of oldsters mostly well
into their 70s -- were charged with dealing narcotics.</p>
<p>It's rather clear that much of this mob is Ceausescu's old
Securitate police. Many of the "miners" who traveled into
Bucharest to aid Mr. Iliescu this past week wore suits --
hardly the garments of workers. Witnesses also report that
the beatings these forces delivered -- they wielded
truncheons and metal cord -- betrayed professional skill.</p>
<p>That such behavior comes from a government that is the
product of the freest election Romania has experienced in 40
years is disheartening. What is clear is that whatever
mandate Mr. Iliescu garnered in last month's elections is now
cracking. Petre Roman, Romania's prime minister, and Silviu
Brucan, another leading figure, spent this weekend taking
care to distance themselves from the bloody Iliescu
crackdown. There will be a simple way to recognize when real
change has returned to Romania. It will be the moment when
Mrs. Ichim is able to start printing a free paper again.</p>
