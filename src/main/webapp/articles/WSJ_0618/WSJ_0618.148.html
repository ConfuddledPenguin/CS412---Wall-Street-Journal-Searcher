	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Proclaiming himself wiser in the ways of Japanese
business, Texas oilman and corporate raider T. Boone Pickens
Jr. comes to Japan this week for another round of battle with
Koito Manufacturing Co.
   But analysts, and even Mr. Pickens himself, don't expect
this visit to produce any breakthroughs in his campaign to
gain a voice in the auto-parts company's operations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As the largest shareholder, Mr. Pickens has been fighting
for more than a year for seats on Koito's board as well as
access to the company's financial records and pricing
policies. Through Amarillo, Texas-based Boone Co., a merchant
bank he controls, Mr. Pickens owns a 26% stake in Koito.</p>
<p>"Sure, I've learned a lot in a year's time," Mr. Pickens
said in a telephone interview. "But I don't have any hope
that Koito will change its mind."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Mr. Pickens is determined to make his
presence felt at Koito's annual shareholders' meeting June
28. He is paying the airfare for 50 other Americans who own
Koito shares so they can attend the session in Tokyo with
him. And in a sugary appeal for support, he mailed videotapes
to around 4,000 Koito holders. In the video, which cost about
$20,000 to produce, Mr. Pickens outlines his proposals --
which include representation on the board, increased dividend
payments and an anti-greenmail resolution -- as he rides
horseback across the Texas range.</p>
<p>"I've done everything I can to make it clear I am a
long-term investor," insists Mr. Pickens.</p>
<p>But Koito is hardly preparing a red-carpet welcome. The
company argues that Mr. Pickens is really a greenmailer --
someone who tries to force a company to buy back his shares
at a premium. Mr. Pickens is welcome to attend the annual
meeting -- the company will even provide simultaneous
interpretation for the visiting Americans -- but that's as
far as the hospitality may go. "All of his proposals will be
denied," a Koito spokesman says.</p>
<p>Koito's top brass aren't the only ones skeptical of Mr.
Pickens's intentions. Last week, Koito's labor union adopted
a resolution urging management to reject Mr. Pickens's
proposals. Sources say Japanese banks also are under pressure
to refrain from lending money to Mr. Pickens or any companies
associated with him.</p>
<p>Mr. Pickens confirmed reports that a U.S. subsidiary of a
major Japanese bank had withdrawn its intent to join a group
of banks that backs Mesa Limited Partners Oil & Gas Co., a
publicly held company that Mr. Pickens heads.</p>
<p>Other major shareholders such as Toyota Motor Corp.,
Nissan Motor Co. and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.
appear to have no time or sympathy for Mr. Pickens. "We
contacted all the large shareholders and said we'd like to
call on them. They have all said they will be out of town,"
says Mr. Pickens.</p>
<p>While Koito and its supporters may be turning a deaf ear
to Mr. Pickens's complaints, Mr. Pickens has found more eager
listeners back in the U.S. Tapping into growing U.S.
resentment of Japanese business practices, Mr. Pickens has
emerged as a spokesman for those frustrated by Japan's
closely connected corporate relationships and has taken his
case to Washington to testify before congressional
committees.</p>
<p>Analysts in Tokyo agree that Koito and Mr. Pickens seem
headed for a long, drawn-out fight. Mr. Pickens is suing
Koito in Tokyo District Court for access to its accounting
books and other records. He says Koito's pricing policies
favor Toyota -- its second largest holder, with a 19% stake
-- to the detriment of other holders. The next hearing is set
for July 12.</p>
