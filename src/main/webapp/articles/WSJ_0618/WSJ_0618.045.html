	<p class="article-leader">In a potentially serious blow to the union effort to buy
UAL Corp.'s United Airlines, the company's 26,000
nonunionized workers indicated that they might not support
the buy-out.
   The nonunionized workers said they still hope they can
reach an accord with the three unions spearheading the
buy-out effort. Their opposition wouldn't necessarily be a
deal-breaker, but it could pose a public-relations problem
for the buy-out group as it seeks bank financing for the
$4.38 billion offer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Union officials began formal talks with lenders last week.
Banks are already skeptical of the union coalition between
United's pilots, machinists and flight attendants, given the
unions' past disputes. Signs of tension between any of the
labor groups is bound to make the banks even more nervous.</p>
<p>A union adviser called the disagreement "a tempest in a
teapot" and said talks are expected to resume today.</p>
<p>The nonunion workers said they had developed a plan under
which they could agree to support the buy-out, but they are
"very disappointed" that the unions have so far refused to
accept it. "We think it is particularly disturbing that {the
buy-out group} has not yet been able to resolve the issues
relating to the non-contract employees." Previously the
nonunion group hadn't taken a stand on the buy-out.</p>
<p>The dispute centers on two issues. The nonunionized
employees are upset over the buy-out group's refusal to
improve the nonunion pension plan. They also want an overall
agreement with the unions to be binding.</p>
<p>However, the unions want an agreement in principle that
would give future management the authority to make changes in
the nonunionized workers' compensation, as UAL management has
done in the past. The unions say that the nonunionized
workers have never had a binding contract in the past.</p>
<p>"We continue to be hopeful that an agreement can be
reached," said Stephen Fraidin of Fried Frank Harris Shriver
& Jacobson, attorneys for the nonunionized group including
reservations clerks, customer-service agents and managers,
about one-third of the work force.</p>
<p>On another level, the dispute points up the Byzantine
quality of the buy-out negotiations. Just last Friday, the
two sides appeared close to an agreement that included
enhanced pension benefits for the nonunionized group. The
company provided the buy-out group with an estimate of the
cost to make these changes.</p>
<p>Later, when the union appeared ready to accept the
changes, UAL said its original calculations were wrong and
that the pension plan changes would cost about 30% more than
anticipated. The unions backed away from an agreement, and
the talks stalled.</p>
<p>Union officials say UAL may be trying to "sandbag" the
buy-out by creating friction between the two labor groups.
They say that UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf, who stands to
lose his job if the buy-out succeeds, encouraged the
non-contract workers to hire financial advisers. He
recommended First Chicago Corp.</p>
<p>Indeed, UAL is paying the fees for First Chicago and Fried
Frank, the non-contract group's legal adviser. The chief
negotiator from First Chicago has past ties to Mr. Wolf and
Ralph Strangis, a UAL director the unions also are planning
to replace.</p>
<p>First Chicago and Fried Frank deny that they are trying to
frustrate the buy-out effort. They say they want a fair deal
for the non-contract workers, who wouldn't otherwise be
represented in the buy-out negotiations.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Mr. Wolf said the unions' suggestion that
management of Chicago-based UAL is using the non-contract
employees to try to block a deal is "ludicrous and absurd."</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, UAL
shares rose $2 to $157.75. The nonunion statement was issued
yesterday.</p>
<p>The unions have already said they are willing to reduce
the amount of annual concessions they sought from the
nonunionized workers to about $50 million from $55 million.
In return, the non-contract workers would receive a 14% stake
in UAL. However, the unions maintain that they can finance
the transaction even without a contribution from nonunion
workers.</p>
<p>The disagreement between the two labor groups poses the
first major test for Gerald Greenwald, who left the No. 2
spot at Chrysler Corp. two weeks ago to lead the buy-out
effort. Mr. Greenwald will have to find a way to smooth over
the differences quickly to avoid any erosion of confidence.
Mr. Greenwald couldn't be reached last night.</p>
<p>"If this package is not agreed to very shortly by {the
buy-out group}, it does not bode well for its ability to make
business judgments," the nonunionized workers warned in their
statement.</p>
