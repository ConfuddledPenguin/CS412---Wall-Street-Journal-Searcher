	<p class="article-leader">Hershey Foods Corp. is betting that its chocolate-bar
taste can take a big bite of the rapidly growing market for
refrigerated pudding.
   But the market leader, Jell-O, is flexing its muscle to
show the new kid on the block who runs the neighborhood.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We intend to defend our share ferociously, with
everything we've got," declares Dana Gioia, marketing manager
for Jell-O desserts at Kraft General Foods, a unit of Philip
Morris Cos. "We take the competition very seriously, and we
don't intend to make life easy" for Hershey.</p>
<p>One of the fastest-growing categories in the supermarket,
refrigerated pudding is expected to rack up sales of $300
million this year, compared with only $55 million in 1987.
Packaging improvements are helping to boost sales, and many
consumers prefer ready-to-eat desserts and snacks. Moreover,
dry pudding mixes are waning in popularity because they
require extra time to cool.</p>
<p>Until early this year, the refrigerated category had been
dominated by only two players, Kraft's Jell-O brand and
Beatrice Co.'s Swiss Miss. Hershey, hoping to exploit its
famous chocolate name, identified a promising pudding niche
for itself. Beatrice is a unit of ConAgra Inc.</p>
<p>Without test-marketing its new product, Hershey quietly
began its national rollout in New England stores in January,
offering what it promoted as four "chocolate bar flavors you
can eat with a spoon": Hershey's Bar, Hershey's Bar with
Almonds, York Peppermint Pattie and Hershey's Kisses
Chocolate. Hershey introduced the pudding line soon after
that in the West and this month in the mid-Atlantic states.</p>
<p>But Kraft, which says it has captured 57% of the national
market since its 1987 entry, is responding aggressively to
the new competition. Immediately after Hershey's pudding
packs appeared on the racks, Kraft began airing TV
commercials with longtime Jell-O spokesman Bill Cosby leading
the counterattack.</p>
<p>In one television ad, Mr. Cosby warns pudding-eaters about
an unnamed "Johnny-Come-Lately." Asks Mr. Cosby: "What does
it have that Jell-O Pudding Snacks don't? Tropical oils and
artificial flavors." In addition to the ads, Kraft is pasting
stickers on its pudding packages, encouraging the consumer to
"read the label." Kraft says Jell-O is made mostly with skim
milk and contains no preservatives, artificial flavors or
tropical oils.</p>
<p>Hershey didn't like the Cosby ad. "They called us up" to
complain, says Kraft's Mr. Gioia. "I think Hershey has been
surprised by the ferocity of our competitive response."</p>
<p>"I'm a little bit suprised by some tactics of the Jell-O
campaign," said Peter Tate, executive vice president of
D.D.B. Needham Worldwide, the ad agency handling the Hershey
pudding account. He said Kraft "has chosen an issue which is
at best temporal and at worst irrelevant."</p>
<p>Pudding-slinging aside, Hershey is encouraged by the early
results. John McMillin, a food-industry analyst at Prudential
Bache, estimates that Hershey has captured 15% of the markets
where it competes and holds about an 8% share nationwide. The
product line "is meeting or exceeding customer sales
projections," says Grace Thomas, marketing director of
Hershey's Venture Group, which developed the pudding.</p>
<p>But a few weeks ago, Hershey eliminated coconut oil from
its pudding formulas and began using a non-tropical oil
instead. Hershey insists that the Cosby campaign wasn't the
impetus for the recipe change. "We have taken our time," says
Ms. Thomas. "The process has been under way for a year and a
half now." Hershey's newly formulated pudding is ecpected to
be available by late summer.</p>
<p>Hershey plans a new advertising campaign to inform
consumers of the change, although Ms. Thomas says Hershey
will refrain from attacks on Jell-O or Swiss Miss. "It's not
the type of advertising we do," she said. "It doesn't fit
with our philosophy."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kraft says it has more tough-talking ads in the
works. When the pudding market revives from its usual summer
slump, "Hershey will recognize the seriousness of our
commitment," Kraft's Mr. Gioia says.</p>
<p>For its part, Beatrice is sitting back and enjoying the
fracas. The entry of Jell-O and Hershey has "been a good
thing for us, and our business has grown," says Dick Nathan,
marketing manager for the Swiss Miss line, which has an
estimated 30% of the market. Swiss Miss, the oldest big
competitor in the category, sells at a significantly lower
price than the two other brands.</p>
<p>With the refrigerated pudding category expected to
continue its rapid growth (in the past 12 months, Beatrice
estimates total sales volume rose 40%), there seems to be
little need for the Hershey-Kraft squabbling.</p>
<p>"Hershey has ridden on Jell-O's coattails," said
Prudential Bache's Mr. McMillin. "But there's enough growth
in the category for everyone."</p>
