	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Housing Secretary Jack Kemp said that new
housing-construction proposals in legislation that the Senate
will consider today could lead to "institutionalizing
profiteering and political influence peddling."
   Secretary Kemp stopped short of threatening to recommend a
veto of the National Affordable Housing Act, but did say the
Housing and Urban Development Department has "major problems
with this bill as drafted on both policy and budget grounds."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At $17.7 billion for fiscal 1991, the price tag for the
bill is $4 billion more than the administration is willing to
authorize. The act would overhaul federal housing programs.</p>
<p>The bill would create a new Housing Opportunity
Partnership, or HOP, which would expand housing for the poor
through rehabilitation and new construction using government
and private-sector funding. The legislation also includes
administration proposals to help low-income persons buy their
own homes, including units currently in the public housing
stock.</p>
<p>Ten HUD programs, including urban homesteading, rental
rehabilitation and public housing construction, would be
consolidated into HOP, which is "designed to be one flexible
delivery system carrying out many of the purposes of older,
more narrowly focussed programs," according to a report by
the Senate's housing and urban affairs subcommittee.</p>
<p>In a letter to subcommittee Chairman Alan Cranston (D.,
Calif.), Mr. Kemp said federally financed new
housing-construction measures "will run into troublesome
systemic scandals, inadequate targeting to the poor and
management crises." The secretary has made similar criticisms
about legislation approved by a House committee this past
week. Final action on the Senate's measure is expected this
week.</p>
<p>The Cranston subcommittee report said that "a blanket
position against new production is too simplistic to be a
responsible national housing policy."</p>
<p>HUD scandals involving political favoritism, influence
peddling and corruption didn't result from new housing
construction efforts, according to the report. "On the
contrary, individuals implicated in the scandals were among
the most vocal opponents of federal assistance for housing
construction," the report said. It said that already-passed
legislation eliminates certain conditions that led to the
scandal and that the proposed legislation provides for
additional protections.</p>
<p>Mr. Kemp said he favors using the community development
block grant program to provide rental and home-ownership
assistance to low-income families and to assist state and
local governments in the rehabilitation of the existing
housing stock.</p>
<p>He added that "private-sector construction can offer
dramatic new additions to affordable housing" if only state
and local governments eliminated such barriers as rent
controls, exclusionary zoning, high user fees, and
unnecessary environmental and land-use regulations."</p>
<p>"These government imposed barriers can add tens of
thousands of dollars to the cost of affordable housing,
pricing moderate and low-income people out of the
marketplace," he wrote.</p>
<p>The housing bill, which is being considered by the full
Senate earlier than expected, doesn't include Federal Housing
Administration restructuring plans that Mr. Kemp recently
proposed. Those proposals are designed to keep FHA's largest
fund, which insures mortgages with low down payments, from
going broke by the end of the decade.</p>
