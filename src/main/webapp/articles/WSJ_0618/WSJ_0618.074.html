	<p class="article-leader">OSLO -- Norway, an independent North Sea oil producer, may
eliminate output restrictions imposed on itself four years
ago in support of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.
   "It is likely we will not continue these measures" for the
second half of the year, Eivind Reiten, the Norwegian oil
minister, said in an interview. Since 1986, Norway has
voluntarily held its expanding production below capacity in
sympathy with OPEC's similar efforts to bolster prices by
limiting output. Currently, Norway pumps 5% less oil than it
could.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Rescinding the so-called holdback would mean little to the
volume of oil reaching world markets, adding only about
80,000 barrels a day to the nearly 1.7 million a day Norway
pumps. But the country's posture plays a psychological role
in jittery oil markets. Norway was among the first -- and now
is the last -- non-OPEC producer to curb output in a goodwill
gesture to OPEC.</p>
<p>"We are very pragmatic about it," said Mr. Reiten. He said
current oil market conditions suggest Norway no longer needs
to hold down production. While petroleum markets recently
have softened because of high OPEC production, prices still
are nearly double the lows reached during 1986 when Norway
volunteered to cooperate in production-cutting.</p>
<p>In fact, Mr. Reiten, named oil minister only a few months
ago, has already been changing Norway's policies; in January,
he reduced the holdback to the current level from 7.5%.</p>
<p>Mr. Reiten cited other reasons for putting the entire
policy under review. He noted that most OPEC members except
Saudi Arabia are currently exceeding that organization's
production quotas, and that "we seem to be the only country
outside OPEC doing anything at all." He said Norway might
consider production coordination again "if the situation
changes."</p>
<p>Meantime, the country is actively expanding capacity --
largely by developing smaller fields. Mr. Reiten disclosed
that he will present applications in two months to Norway's
parliament to begin development of two such new fields.</p>
<p>Also, Norway will take bids for exploration licenses on 52
offshore tracts in September, the country's 13th such
licensing round and one of its largest ever. The tracts are
divided about equally between the Norwegian sectors of the
North Sea and the Barents Sea. Although Mr. Reiten said oil
companies are "queuing up" for the bidding, the Barents Sea
has proved disappointing for Norway so far. "The North Sea is
much more promising than expected," he said.</p>
<p>He estimated current spending for exploration and
development of North Sea fields at a record 30 billion to 35
billion Norwegian kroner ($4.62 billion to $5.4 billion)
annually.</p>
<p>Although North Sea oil workers have threatened to strike
July 1 and close production temporarily, Norway's total
output is expected to continue rising, at least for a few
more years. "We will see a peaking of production at two
million barrels a day around 1995," Mr. Reiten said. "We
expect it to continue that level for another five or six
years" and then start to drop, he said.</p>
