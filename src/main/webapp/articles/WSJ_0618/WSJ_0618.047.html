	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- U.S. imports of steel mill products in April
rose 17% from March but remained slightly below the
year-earlier month, according to an American Iron and Steel
Institute compilation of Commerce Department figures.
   Imports in April totaled 1,313,000 tons, compared with
1,120,000 tons in March and 1,341,000 tons in April 1989, the
trade group said. April imports were 16.4% of total steel
consumption, the same percentage as a year earlier but up
from 13.5% in March.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the first four months of 1990, imports totaled
4,975,000 tons, equal to 15.7% of consumption, compared with
5,677,000 tons, or 17% of consumption, a year earlier. The
1990 import share of the market was well below the maximum of
19.1% established under a revised "voluntary" import
restraint system that took effect last Oct. 1.</p>
<p>Steel exports in April were 335,000 tons, down 8.2% from
March but practically flat with 334,000 tons a year earlier,
the trade group said. For the first four months, exports of
1,388,000 tons were down 3.3% from 1,436,000 tons a year
earlier.</p>
