	<p class="article-leader">Mitsubishi Motors Corp. said its consolidated pretax
profit edged up 2.2% in the year ended March 31 to 50.23
billion yen ($324 million) from 49.13 billion yen in the
previous fiscal year.
   Net income climbed 11% to 21.13 billion yen from 19.03
billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales soared to 2.361 trillion yen, an 8% increase from
2.186 trillion a year earlier.</p>
<p>Mitsubishi's U.S. joint venture with Chrysler Corp.,
Diamond/Star Motors Corp., was a drag on consolidated
earnings in the year, a spokesman said. However, he said his
company expects to redeem losses at the venture, which isn't
producing at capacity, in the current fiscal year. Diamond
Star started operations in September 1988 and began shipments
in January 1989.</p>
