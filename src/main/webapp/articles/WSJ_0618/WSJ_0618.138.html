	<h3>Marketing & Media -- Advertising: Bellyaching Advertisers Stomach New Audience-Guarantee Plans</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">Advertisers screamed when all three major television
networks scrapped the traditional practice of guaranteeing
audience sizes last week. Sponsors threatened to take their
advertising dollars elsewhere, to place ads on -- perish the
thought -- upstart rivals such as Fox.
   But the temper tantrums appear to be almost pure
posturing. When the upfront market, during which advertisers
pull out their wallets and start negotiating to buy ad time
for the upcoming fall season, kicks off this week, ad agency
executives concede it will be business as usual. Advertisers
are expected to spend $4.4 billion or more on prime time on
the three networks and Fox, up from $4.2 billion a year ago.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"There's a certain amount of money out there that's been
slated to buy {network television}, and that's going to get
spent. It's still the best medium for advertisers to look
at," says Jennifer Young, a senior vice president with Della
Femina McNamee. Once upfront sales start, "the market will
move as if pretty much nothing went on, despite all our
bellyaching."</p>
<p>The change in the guarantee system, agrees Paul Schulman
president of Paul Schulman Co., a media buying firm, "won't
affect the upfront very much at all. It's just one more
factor in the total upfront equation." Some advertisers may
channel a tiny piece of their budgets away from network
television just to slap the networks' wrists, industry
executives say, but that amount will be barely noticeable in
the multibillion-dollar pie.</p>
<p>Late last week, all three networks agreed to use a plan
formulated by NBC which does away with the traditional
guarantee system. Under the plan, the networks will project
audience size for the fall TV season by using an average of
audience levels over the past eight years. The networks will
guarantee audience sizes based on those projections, rather
than based solely on ratings from A.C. Nielsen Co., as they
have in the past. The reason behind the change: Nielsen
ratings showed a steep, unexplained drop earlier this year, a
drop that cost the networks dearly.</p>
<p>Until now, the networks guaranteed advertisers certain TV
ratings as measured by Nielsen. If the actual ratings fell
short, the networks would have to cough up free commercial
air time to the advertisers, known as "make goods." The three
networks just this year have had to shell out as much as $200
million of make goods after the disastrous, mysterious
ratings decline. With the new plan, they are trying to avoid
another such trouncing.</p>
<p>Advertisers immediately denounced the plan; they still
don't support it, but now say they will treat it as just
another issue at the negotiating table. "Certainly, anything
you give away you try to get back somewhere else," says Mr.
Schulman. He and others say that advertisers will attempt to
hold out for slightly lower prices, a better programming mix,
or other extras in return for the reduced guarantee.</p>
<p>Advertisers may also attempt to stick to the traditional
guarantee system, if they have enough leverage to twist the
networks' arms. "Every deal may be slightly different,"
predicts Marc Goldstein, director of national broadcast for
Lintas.</p>
<p>With the audience-guarantee issue moving to a back burner,
advertisers and networks alike are now trying to fathom who
the big winners will be in the upfront market. Advertisers
say Capital Cities/ABC's network, the second-ranked network
that has been gaining on No. 1 NBC, is looking for the
biggest price increases, ranging from 17% to 20% for the
desirable 18- to 39-year-old age group. Although ABC is
unlikely to get increases that big, advertisers say it may
well win double-digit rises.</p>
<p>NBC, a unit of General Electric, is expected to win
smaller increases. Its stable of hits is seen as aging and
vulnerable. And CBS could eke out even smaller increases.</p>
<p>News Corp.'s Fox, which brought in about $300 million in
the upfront market last year, is expected to make a
particularly strong showing; industry estimates for its
upfront take range from $425 million to $600 million. Fox not
only is introducing additional new programming, but has a
strong hold on the 18- to 34-year-olds advertisers love. It
also wins points among advertisers because it is sticking to
the traditional guarantee system.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest unanswered question in the upfront
market, though, is its size. Last year, ad executives
expected modest increases at best. But a surge of buying by
auto makers set off a feeding frenzy that led to almost a 25%
increase in upfront sales to $4.2 billion. This year, ad
executives say, the auto market has clearly cooled, and they
are looking for only modest increases again.</p>
<p>H. Weller "Jake" Keever, head of sales at ABC, estimates
the market will grow to $4.4 billion to $4.6 billion, while
advertisers say the figure will be on the low end of that
range. Several ad executives interviewed said their clients'
budgets are flat or only marginally above last year's levels.</p>
<p>But ad executives could be surprised again, just as they
were last year. Agencies have already submitted their plans
to the networks -- some more than a week ago -- and
negotiations are about to start in earnest. ABC is already
working with auto makers, and ad executives say movie firms,
which are seeing some moderate increases in spending, may
also be early out of the gate.</p>

<p>Billboard Guidelines</p>
<p>The Outdoor Advertising Association of America this week
will announce a new "code of advertising practices" calling
for restrictions on the placement of billboards promoting
alcohol and tobacco products.</p>
<p>The OAAA, a trade group, has no power to enforce its new
code, which is expected to call for a ban on tobacco and
alcohol billboards within 500 feet of churches, hospitals,
schools and playgrounds. The group is expected to strongly
urge its member companies to adopt the code.</p>
<p>But the code isn't likely to appease tobacco foes, who in
recent months have garnered hefty press for their attacks on
the outdoor ad business. In New York, for example, the Rev.
Calvin Butts got a lot of press when he whitewashed
billboards in Harlem.</p>
<p>A number of big billboard companies have recently adopted
their own policies governing the placement of billboards that
pitch products illegal to minors. Patrick Media Group, for
example, instituted formal guidelines in January.</p>
