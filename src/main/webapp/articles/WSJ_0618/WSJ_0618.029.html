	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Where's the beef?
   It's showing up again on many British dinner plates as a
monthlong scare over "mad cow disease" has begun to ease.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>However, the consumer panic may now reignite -- but this
time hurt pork and poultry sales -- because of new scientific
fears that pigs and chickens could become susceptible to the
deadly disease.</p>
<p>In recent testimony before a parliamentary panel, several
researchers urged the U.K. government to include pigs and
poultry in an animal-feed ban intended to check the disease's
spread among cattle and sheep. "The best way to control this
thing is to make {the ban} mandatory" for all animal feed,
Gareth Roberts, a lecturer in neuroanatomy at St. Mary's
Hospital Medical School in London, said in an interview
elaborating on his testimony. "It's common sense, really,
rather than any startling scientific finding."</p>
<p>Ivor Mills, a Cambridge University emeritus professor of
medicine who also testified, added in an interview that "if
they {government officials} are going to wait until this
{infection} has taken place, then the danger to man increases
dramatically."</p>
<p>But the government, still shaken by the domestic
beef-sales tumble and a fight with three European neighbors
over "mad cow disease," refuses to buy any more such
hypotheses. "Ministers can only act on good science," said
Peter Wilkinson, a spokesman for Britain's Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. "There's no scientific
justification for such a ban" on poultry and pig feed.</p>
<p>British farmers aren't taking any chances, however. The
National Farmers Union is encouraging its members to stop
using any animal feed that may be infected with the disease.
In an internal memo, the farmer group said that consumer
organizations believe the voluntary ban "would help public
confidence" even though "there is no danger to pigs and
poultry" from the feed.</p>
<p>Mad cow disease, officially called bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, has forced the slaughter of 14,324 cows in
Britain since 1986. The government has paid farmers about #6
million ($10.2 million) for their losses. The disease,
thought to be carried by a virus, makes cows' brains go
spongy and causes the animals to stagger and foam at the
mouth.</p>
<p>There isn't any proof that humans are at risk from eating
contaminated beef. The panic among British consumers was
triggered by the mid-May death of Max, a Siamese cat with
symptoms like those of the disease. His death prompted fears
that the disease can be passed from one species to another.</p>
<p>Tabloid newspapers ran sensational headlines on the
matter, and several communities banned beef from school
lunches. But U.K. officials insisted that British beef
remained safe to eat. Many consumers discounted such
reassurances, however, because they felt the government had
handled previous food scares badly. Beef consumption dropped
an estimated 10% to 15% in late May, and the European
Community began buying British beef to try to keep prices
from plunging.</p>
<p>France, Italy and West Germany then banned imports of
British beef, setting off a political firestorm amid threats
of EC legal action and of British counteraction. The three
countries lifted their bans June 7, when EC ministers agreed
on measures to contain mad cow disease. But the crisis isn't
over. Last week, Switzerland imposed an immediate ban on
imports of British cattle and beef as a precaution against
the disease.</p>
<p>In Britain, meanwhile, meat producers and major food
chains such as J. Sainsbury PLC and Tesco Stores Ltd. say
beef sales are starting to recover. The EC settlement helped
to push mad cow disease off newspapers' front pages.</p>
<p>"People have begun to realize that it {the scare} was
exaggerated and have gone back to eating beef," says Clare
Cheney, assistant director of the British Retailers
Association. Gavin Richardson, an account director at
market-research concern AGB Research, says that "people have
short memories" about food scares.</p>
