	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Despite growing concern about possible links
between exposure to chemicals and degenerative nerve diseases
such as Parkinson's, the U.S. fails to adequately monitor the
neurological risks of chemicals used in farms and factories,
a congressional study concludes.
   "Neurotoxic chemicals constitute a major health threat;
the social and economic consequences of excessive exposure to
them are potentially very large," warns John Gibbons, the
director of the Office of Technology Assessment, the
congressional research agency that issued the report.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The government's current system for testing chemicals and
pesticides focuses primarily on determining cancer risks. But
"adverse effects on organs and organ systems, particularly
the nervous system, may pose an equal or greater threat to
public health," the report says. "Consequently, it is
important to devise risk-assessment strategies to address
non-cancer health risks."</p>
<p>The impact of toxins on the nervous system can range from
dizziness to death. Some recent scientific studies have
linked an increased incidence of two degenerative nerve
diseases -- Parkinson's and amyotrophid lateral sclerosis,
commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease -- to environmental
factors. In addition, some researchers speculate that
prolonged exposure to some chemicals may help cause
Alzheimer's disease. But the report stresses that "no link
between a toxic chemical and the disease has been
conclusively demonstrated."</p>
<p>The Environmental Protection Agency, which monitors some
65,000 toxic chemicals, is currently drafting new
neurotoxicity guidelines for pesticides. The Office of
Technology Assessment suggests a number of other steps the
government could take -- including stepped-up research
efforts and improved coordination among the EPA, the Food and
Drug Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration and other agencies that regulate pesticides,
industrial chemicals, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>Increased testing for neurotoxicity could be expensive for
industry. The OTA calculates that it could boost currently
required testing costs by as much as 240%. Such increases
wouldn't have a large impact on the already high costs of
developing new drugs and pesticides, but it could
significantly boost the costs -- and therefore reduce
innovation -- of developing low-volume, specialty industrial
chemicals, the report says.</p>
<p>Over the last six years, both Congress and regulatory
agencies have grown more concerned about the impact of toxins
on the nervous system. The OTA report, which is entitled
"Neurotoxicity: Identifying and Controlling Poisons of the
Nervous System," is likely to stimulate more activity in that
area. "It's time we develop new tests for neurotoxicity,
promote research into the causes and treatments of neurotoxic
effects, and use our regulatory programs to reduce human and
environmental exposure to neurotoxic chemicals," says Rep.
Robert Roe (D., N.J.), chairman of the House Committee on
Science, Space and Technology.</p>
