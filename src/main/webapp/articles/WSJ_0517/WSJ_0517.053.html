	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- Coca-Cola Co.'s $100 million plan to surprise
consumers this summer has turned up some nasty surprises for
the company instead.
   In what Coke calls its biggest promotion ever, the
soft-drink giant has begun distributing 750,000 "MagiCans" --
seemingly ordinary 12-ounce cans of Coca-Cola Classic that
actually contain millions of dollars in cash and prizes.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>When a buyer pops the top, a device rises through the
opening in the can and displays a curled-up legal tender --
anywhere from $1 to $100 -- or a scroll of paper, redeemable
for prizes. To give the cans the feel of the real product,
Coke has partially filled them with water.</p>
<p>But last week, an 11-year-old boy in North Andover, Mass.,
opened a so-called MagiCan and drank a clear liquid that his
mother described as "tasting and smelling like a cleaning
solution." Noting that she knew nothing about the promotion,
the mother, Robin Gendron, said she turned the can over to
local police, asking them if they could determine what was in
it.</p>
<p>Upon inspecting the can, the police found the
prize-delivery mechanism and a $5 bill, and sent the liquid
to a laboratory for analysis, said Mrs. Gendron. The police
spokesman couldn't be reached.</p>
<p>What happened in Massachusetts, a Coca-Cola spokesman said
yesterday, was "an isolated incident."</p>
<p>Concerned Coca-Cola marketing officials have huddled for
the past two days to discuss how serious a problem they face.
The cans are the heart of a $100 million summer promotion
that features commercials with New Kids on the Block, a
popular vocal group, and giveaway promotions at fountain
outlets.</p>
<p>The Coca-Cola spokesman confirmed that there have been
malfunctions in other cans, but said that there were "fewer
than 10." He said the company is looking into the problem.</p>
<p>The early reading, according to one person familiar with
the discussions, is that Coke believes the can problems are
more of an isolated nuisance than a widespread nightmare.</p>
<p>Ever willing to jump on its main rival's mishaps, Pepsi
turned up Tuesday on the doorstep of the Massachusetts youth.
A local Pepsi sales manager, performing what the company
described as a "good-will" visit, offered the boy a couple of
cases of Pepsi, as well as several Pepsi hats and towels.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gendron said she has mixed feelings about the affair.
Her son, she said, "was thrilled to have the $5, as any
11-year-old would be." She added, however, "Knowingly putting
something in a can that says Coke -- but isn't -- doesn't
make a lot of sense to me."</p>
