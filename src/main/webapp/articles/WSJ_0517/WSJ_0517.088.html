	<p class="article-leader">Over-the-counter stocks upstaged exchange-listed issues
and posted a slight gain.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index rose .43 to 442.93, a 0.1%
advance, compared with a 0.1% decline in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average. Advancing shares reclaimed their lead
over declining stocks, 993 to 960, but volume slipped to
152.5 million from 162.3 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Portfolio manager Stephen Lieber, co-chairman of the $700
million Evergreen Fund, says the strength of secondary issues
doesn't surprise him.</p>
<p>"We're beginning to see some evidence of a shifting
phase," Mr. Lieber says. Portfolio managers who were
reluctant to commit their cash in the first quarter are now
buying shares of specialty companies that have reported
healthy earnings, he says.</p>
<p>"I think the evidence shows that in any period of
declining corporate profits, there tends to be
proportionately more interest in those companies that show
rising earnings trends," he adds.</p>
<p>At the same time, more aggressive money managers who
traditionally buy fast-growing, smaller companies "are rather
quiet" after actively trading OTC stocks in the first
quarter, Mr. Lieber says. He also suggests that in the near
term the market in general will reflect the shifts in federal
budget policy and interestrate expectations.</p>
<p>Strong earnings aren't confined to any particular OTC
sector, according to Mr. Lieber, but range from some of the
healthier regional banks to technology shares and even some
speciality retailers. Among some shares favored by the
portfolio manager are: international advertising agency
Omnicom Group, which yesterday gained 1/2 to 25 3/8;
specialty retailer Medicine Shoppes International, which
yesterday dipped 1/4 to 21, and software designer and
marketer Borland International, which advanced 3/8 to 16 7/8.</p>
<p>Peter Coolidge, senior OTC trader at Kidder Peabody, said
he was impressed with the market's action yesterday. After
the Nasdaq Composite Index drifted to a low of 440.58 at
noon, it held firm and then recovered, Mr. Coolidge noted. He
called this performance a sign that the rally may continue.</p>
<p>Mr. Coolidge pointed to two other signs that may bode well
for the market: an increase in initial public offerings and
recent announcements of mergers or proposed buy-outs, calling
the latter "a phenomenon that's creeping back into the
market."</p>
<p>Three of the day's top percentage gainers -- Bio-Medicus,
Unilab and Silicon Valley Group -- were sparked by news of
buy-outs or potential takeover threats.</p>
<p>Bio-Medicus surged 3 3/8 to 20 on 1.2 million shares after
Medtronic, a Minneapolis medical-technology concern,
unexpectedly offered Tuesday to buy the Eden Prairie, Minn.,
health-services company in a tax-free exchange of stock.
Medtronic offered one share of its common stock for each 3.3
shares of Bio-Medicus common. Based on Medtronic's May 11
closing price of $71.375, the offer is valued at $21.74 a
share. Medtronic currently holds about 5.5% of Bio-Medicus's
outstanding shares.</p>
<p>Bio-Medicus said it will consider the offer at a regular
board meeting today.</p>
<p>Separately, Bio-Medicus reported net income for the fourth
quarter ended March 31 of 22 cents a share, up from five
cents a year earlier.</p>
<p>Unilab rose 1 5/16 to 6 after MetPath Inc., a unit of
Corning Inc., said it raised its stake in the Norcross, Ga.,
provider of laboratory testing services to 26.25% from about
20.9%. Metpath said it may consider seeking control of the
company.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley Group gained 1 5/8 to 9 3/4 after
Perkin-Elmer said late Tuesday that it sold a two-third
interest in its semiconductor-equipment business to the San
Jose, Calif., maker of electronic equipment. The two
businesses will form a new company, SVG Lithography Systems
Inc., involved in optical lithography technology used to
produce semiconductors. International Business Machines is
planning to invest in the new business's research and
development; Sematech, a consortium of U.S. industries and
the government, has entered into a joint development with the
new company.</p>
<p>Positive earnings continued to attract investors to
selective OTC shares. Applied Materials gained 2 1/4 to 34
3/4 after the Santa Clara, Calif., maker of water fabrication
equipment reported late Tuesday that net income in the second
quarter ended April 29 fell to 62 cents a share from 83 cents
a year earlier, but was still higher than the average of
analysts' estimates. Scitex rallied 1 1/8 to 33 1/4 after the
Israeli maker of imaging and computer graphics reported late
yesterday net income for the first quarter ended March 31 of
78 cents a share, up from 35 cents a year earlier.</p>
<p>Coda Energy traded as high as 2 5/8 before closing
unchanged at 2 3/8. The Dallas oil and gas drilling company
reported income from continuing operations for the third
quarter ended March 31 tripled to three cents a share from
year-earlier results.</p>
<p>Analysts' recommendations sparked interest in Duty Free
International, up 3 1/4 at 29 1/4, and Optical Radiation, up
1 3/4 at 34 1/2, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor
Report.</p>
<p>Shearson Lehman Hutton retail analyst Stacy Ruchlamer
repeated her "buy" opinion on Duty Free and raised her
earnings fiscal 1991 first-quarter and full year earnings
estimates for the Ridgefield, Conn., operator of duty-free
retail stores, DJPIR said. Duty Free's chief financial
officer tied the rise to the analyst's comments.</p>
<p>Similarly, Montgomery Securities analyst Leonard S. Yaffe
emphasized his purchase opinion on Optical Radiation and
raised his 1991 and 1992 earnings estimates for the Azusa,
Calif., maker of optical equipment, according to DJPIR.</p>
<p>Homestyle Buffet gained 1 to 10 3/4 after a secondary
offering of 1.45 million shares of the Oldsmar, Fla.,
restaurant concern was priced Tuesday at $9.50 a share.</p>
<p>Among the day's biggest percentage losers was Action
Savings Bank, off 1 5/8 at 2 1/4. The Somers Point, N.J.,
thrift bank said Tuesday after the market closed that an
ongoing examination by the Office of Thrift Supervision will
result in as yet unspecified increases in its non-performing
assets and allowances for loan losses.</p>
<p>Common and preferred shares of First Executive lost ground
after the troubled thrift reported that it paid more than
$1.33 billion in the first quarter to people surrendering
insurance policies and annuities. First Executive common
shares fell 1/4 to 2 5/8; the series E preferred shares
dropped 1 3/8 to 5 3/8; series F preferred shares tumbled 2
1/8 to 9 3/8, and series G lost 5/8 to 4 3/4.</p>
<p>Concord Camera fell 1/4 to 3 3/8 after the Avenel, N.J.,
maker and distributor of cameras reported a loss of 24 cents
a share for the third quarter ended March 31, compared with
net income of 17 cents a share a year before. The company,
which a week ago couldn't explain a jump in its stock to 3
7/8, attributed the quarterly loss to price competition,
continuing retail weakness and the financial difficulties of
one of its major customers, Ames Department Stores.</p>
