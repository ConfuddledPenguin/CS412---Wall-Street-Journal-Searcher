	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- The Chicago Board of Trade said it has
developed futures contracts on health and auto-collision
insurance for use by insurance companies.
   Details of the new contracts are being tightly guarded for
competitive reasons, said the futures exchange, which soon
will submit the proposed new contracts to the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission for approval. It's likely to be
several months before the federal regulator acts on the
proposals.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The contracts are likely to be based on "baskets" of
insurance policies maturing at the same time, futures
industry officials speculated.</p>
<p>Futures contracts on insurance policies have been
considered by a number of futures exchanges over the past
several years. The Board of Trade seriously considered
listing insurance futures contracts in the early 1970s, but
it put the product on hold while it pursued interest rate
futures.</p>
<p>Insurance futures found a new champion in Leslie
Rosenthal, who had been exchange chairman when the idea for
the product was floated in the early '70s. Earlier this year,
Mr. Rosenthal was asked to head an exchange subcommittee that
developed the contracts.</p>
<p>Richard Sandor, who advised Mr. Rosenthal on the product,
conceded that there hasn't been a groundswell of demand for
the futures contract, and that it may be a hard sell among
traditionally conservative insurance companies.</p>
