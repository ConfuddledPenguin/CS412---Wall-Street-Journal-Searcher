	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- Unitel Communications Inc., jointly owned by
Canadian Pacific Ltd. and Rogers Communications Inc., applied
to Canadian regulators for permission to compete in Canada's
highly lucrative long-distance telephone market.
   Long-distance telephone service is currently provided, on
a regulated monopoly basis, by one company in each of the
country's 10 provinces. Cross-country services are
coordinated by a telephone-company association, Telecom
Canada.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The federal regulator, the Canadian Radio-television and
Telecommunications Commission, rejected a previous Unitel bid
in 1985 to enter the long-distance market because of concerns
over the financial feasibility of its plan. But Unitel
President George Harvey said he was confident that the new
application will be successful because of what he said would
be the potential benefits from competition. Unitel,
previously known as CNCP Telecommunications, operates a
nationwide telecommunications network, providing private
line, data, video and audio services.</p>
<p>Mr. Harvey predicted a "tough fight" with the phone
companies, centering on their "scaremongering" claims that
long-distance competition would result in sharply higher
charges for basic local phone service, which is heavily
subsidized by long-distance revenues.</p>
<p>The Unitel executive said competition need not prompt
higher local phone rates, because he predicted competition
would expand the telephone market. But Bell Canada, the
largest Canadian telephone company, said that in the U.S.,
which has had regulated competition for long distance since
1978, local rates rose by 100% from 1978 to 1989. Average
flat monthly rates in the U.S. are almost double those of
Bell Canada, the utility said.</p>
<p>Bell Canada, a unit of BCE Inc., said it is able to keep
local rates low by subsidizing them with 65 cents of every
dollar it earns from long-distance business.</p>
<p>The utility, which operates in Quebec, Ontario and the
country's far-northern regions, said that since 1983 the cost
of its local and long-distance services, including taxes, has
declined by 3.5% while the cost of U.S. services has
increased 18%.</p>
<p>Some major Canadian companies, including Royal Bank of
Canada, support long-distance phone competition because they
say they believe it will produce technical advances and lower
phone rates. Unitel said it is cheaper for a Canadian
businessman in Vancouver to route a Toronto phone call
through the U.S. than to place it entirely through the
current Canadian long-distance network.</p>
<p>Unitel's application asked that its proposed regulated
long-distance rates be set 15% below those of the telephone
companies in order to give the company a chance to gain a
foothold in the business. But Bell Canada said Unitel is no
infant enterprise trying to establish itself.</p>
<p>Its owners, Canadian Pacific and Rogers
Telecommunications, are two large companies that want "a
chance to creamskim long distance with an average 15%
regulated price differential," said Bell Canada President
Jean Monty.</p>
<p>To provide long-distance service to businesses and homes,
Unitel asked for permission to interconnect its system with
the local networks of the federally regulated phone companies
in Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, New
Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia. It also
intends to seek access to the long-distance markets of
Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, provided Parliament
approves proposed legislation that would bring the
provincially owned telephone utilities in the three provinces
under the control of federal regulators.</p>
<p>On the Toronto Stock Exchange, BCE closed at C$39.125 a
share, off 25 Canadian cents. Rogers Communications' B shares
closed at C$8 each, down 75 cents, and Canadian Pacific
closed at C$21.375 a share, off 25 cents.</p>
