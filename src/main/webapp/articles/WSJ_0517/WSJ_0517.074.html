	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Citicorp's Citibank Private Bank unit named
James R. Hocking chief investment officer of the U.S.
Investment division, signaling the bank's determination to
raise its profile as a manager of assets for wealthier
individuals.
   Mr. Hocking, 60 years old, joins Citibank from Templeton
International, a unit of Templeton Galbraith & Hansberger
Ltd., the London money manager. As senior vice president and
portfolio manager there, his responsibilities included
creating and marketing mutual funds and managing portfolios.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At Citibank, he will oversee more than 50 portfolio
managers who invest $15 billion for individuals of high net
worth. And Mr. Hocking will direct the bank's efforts for
U.S. customers who want to invest in overseas securities.</p>
<p>In October 1988, Citicorp sold its Citicorp Investment
Management Inc. subsidiary, which invested pension-fund
assets for U.S. institutions. Other banks also have sold such
operations, which are "highly price-competitive," said David
E. Gibson, Citicorp's group executive for global private
banking. The company did maintain its international
institutional business.</p>
<p>But having sold the U.S. institutional line, the bank
resolved to boost its individual private-banking work. "We
have a big involvement and a big commitment" to individual
private banking, but "we don't have the public image," the
50-year-old Mr. Gibson said. Through "selected important
personnel," including Mr. Hocking, the bank hopes to boost
that profile, he added.</p>
