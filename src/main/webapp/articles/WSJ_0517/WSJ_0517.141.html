	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The leveraged buy-out fund run by Merrill
Lynch & Co. acquired Londontown Holdings Corp., maker of
London Fog rainwear and other apparel for an indicated price
of more than $63.2 million.
   The seller is General Electric Co.'s General Electric
Capital Corp., which financed a $178 million leveraged
buy-out of Londontown in December 1988. Interco Inc. sold
Eldersburg, Md.-based Londontown at the time to reduce debt
Interco took on to fend off a takeover bid.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>GE provided the financing for the original buy-out with
$215 million in debt, $20 million in preferred stock and a
$75 million bridge loan by GE's securities unit, Kidder,
Peabody & Co. That loan was refinanced last year with a sale
by Kidder of high-risk, high-yield junk bonds.</p>
<p>Merrill is paying $1,631.23 a share for 38,750 Class B
Common shares of Londontown Holdings, or $63.2 million, plus
a sum it didn't disclose for part of an equity interest held
by Londontown management. The common shares include 9,687.5
warrants sold in connection with the junk-bond offering and
convertible into a 17.5% interest in the company. The
transaction values the warrants at $15.8 million.</p>
<p>GE will continue to hold its Londontown debt and preferred
stock, and the junk bonds will remain outstanding. But a
spokesman wouldn't disclose GE's purchase price for its
equity stake or its indicated profit or loss on the
transaction.</p>
<p>Executives of Merrill's buy-out fund, Merrill Lynch
Capital Partners Inc., couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
