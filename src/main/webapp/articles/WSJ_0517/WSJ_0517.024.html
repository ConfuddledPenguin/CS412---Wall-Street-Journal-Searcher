	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Production of crude steel in Japan in April
increased 0.2% to 9.1 million metric tons from a year
earlier, the Japan Iron and Steel Federation said.
   A metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds. April
production fell 0.7% from 9.16 million tons in March, when
output was at record levels. Japanese steelmakers increased
their output in the month to meet continuing demand from the
construction sector. Demand for steels used in construction
expanded in April, compared with a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Strong capital investment by the private sector in Japan
is underpinning growth in basic industries such as steel.
Demand from other areas, such as the consumer goods industry,
also has kept production high in the past year.</p>
<p>As of April, the Japanese economy had been expanding for
41 consecutive months, the third-longest period of continuous
expansion in the nation's history.</p>
