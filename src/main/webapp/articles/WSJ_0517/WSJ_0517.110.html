	<p class="article-leader">A federal jury in Los Angeles found that a stockbroker and
a former printing-plant employee committed securities fraud
by trading on information from advance copies of Business
Week.
   In the civil suit, brought by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the jury found that Brian Callahan, formerly a
stockbroker with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., and
William Jackson, who worked at the Torrance, Calif., printing
plant of R.R. Donnelly & Sons Co., broke the law by trading
on confidential information.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The SEC charged that Mr. Jackson traded on information
from Business Week before the magazine hit the newsstands and
then passed the information on to Mr. Callahan. Employees of
Donnelly, one of the companies that prints Business Week for
McGraw-Hill Inc., have been named in other SEC lawsuits
alleging that they used advance information from the
magazine. Donnelly requires its employees to keep such
information secret.</p>
<p>Mr. Callahan and Mr. Jackson were accused of making a
total of 122 transactions involving 53 stocks between July
1987 and July 1988. Mr. Callahan joined the scheme in April
1988 when Mr. Jackson opened an account with him, the SEC
said.</p>
<p>U.S. Judge Stephen V. Wilson issued a freeze on the amount
of the defendants' assets that the SEC is seeking to have
turned over as illegal profits. The SEC said the $19,500
freeze on Mr. Jackson's assets represents illegal profits
made on the transactions in Mr. Jackson's own accounts, those
of a brother and a joint account he had with two brothers.
The brothers weren't accused of any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>The $27,600 freeze on Mr. Callahan's assets equals the
illegal profits that he and eight clients made on the
transactions, plus $8,000 in brokerage commissions, said
Jeffrey Zuckerman, an SEC associate regional administrator
from New York working on the case. The SEC has said Mr.
Callahan was fired by Prudential-Bache in August 1988 for his
alleged involvement in the scheme.</p>
<p>The two defendants also face penalties of as much as three
times the illegal profits. Judge Wilson will decide whether
to order any penalties.</p>
<p>Attorneys for the defendants said Mr. Callahan's and Mr.
Jackson's stock trading violated no securities law. Joseph
Connolly, an attorney for Mr. Callahan, said his client
didn't know the information he received from Mr. Jackson was
confidential. Jack Samet, an attorney for Mr. Jackson, said
he doesn't believe the violation of a work rule should
constitute a securities-law violation.</p>
<p>The defense attorneys have filed a motion asking Judge
Wilson to reject the SEC's use of the "misappropriation
theory" in this case. Under that theory, the SEC charges
securities fraud if a defendant trades on confidential
information that was taken in violation of a fiduciary duty.
The defense attorneys plan to appeal if their motion is
denied.</p>
<p>Although that SEC rule has been upheld in other federal
jurisdictions, including New York, it hasn't been decided in
the Los Angeles court.</p>
