	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Inflation at the retail level is slowing
from its fiery pace at the start of the year, following the
path of wholesale prices, new government figures indicate.
   The Labor Department said its consumer price index rose
0.2% in April, the mildest increase since September and far
below the rises of 0.5% in March and February and 1.1% in
January.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The new price figures, which came a few days after the
Labor Department said producer prices declined in April,
supported the predictions of many analysts that the inflation
surge at the start of the year would be temporary.</p>
<p>The price slowdown comes amid signs of continuing slack in
the economy. The Commerce Department said housing starts fell
5.8% in April, following drops of 11.2% and 5.1% in March and
February. Earlier government reports for April showed
declines in industrial output, retail sales and private
employment.</p>
<p>Many economists said the price figures give little
indication that real progress is being made in reducing the
country's core inflation rate.</p>
<p>"The real changes have been in perception and market
sentiments," said Robert Falconer, senior vice president of
Aubrey G. Lanston & Co. in New York. "Underlying inflation is
not getting any better or any worse."</p>
<p>Excluding food and energy prices, whose wide and frequent
swings tend to distort the overall inflation picture,
consumer prices also rose 0.2% in April. Food and energy
prices, along with a surge in clothing prices, were largely
responsible for the first quarter's swift inflation rate,
which was the fastest pace in seven years.</p>
<p>The latest reading brought the increase in consumer prices
over the preceding 12 months down to 4.7%, where inflation
has been hovering during the past few years. Excluding food
and energy, the rate was 4.8%.</p>
<p>"Obviously the figure was good news," said Richard D.
Rippe, chief economist for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New
York. "But I don't think one month of a two-tenths CPI
reading is going to erase inflation concerns."</p>
<p>Still, given the moderation in both producer and consumer
prices -- along with new evidence of weakness in the economy
-- it seems likely that the Federal Reserve will leave
interest rates alone for a while. Before this month's string
of reports, speculation had grown that the Fed was about to
push up interest rates to battle price pressures.</p>
<p>After the inflation report came out yesterday, John
LaWare, a Fed governor, said: "It sounds pretty good."</p>
<p>Most of the moderation in consumer prices last month came
in categories that posted sharp rises in earlier months.
Energy prices, which soared in January in response to a surge
in demand during a late December cold wave, fell for the
third-consecutive month. They dropped 0.4%. Food prices,
which shot up after the cold snap damaged crops in the South,
fell 0.2%.</p>
<p>Clothing prices grew only 0.1% after leaping 3.3% in
February and 1.6% in March. The earlier jumps had puzzled
analysts, but the Labor Department said they partly reflected
earlier-than-usual introduction of spring-fashion lines,
which escaped the department's formula for adjusting for
regular seasonal price changes. Housing costs inched up 0.1%
after rising 0.5% in March.</p>
<p>In some other areas inflation remained stubborn.
Medical-care costs increased 0.8% for the third month in a
row, bringing their rise over the past 12 months to 8.9%.
Entertainment costs grew 0.4% after rising 0.6% the month
before.</p>
<p>Richard Peach, deputy chief economist at the Mortgage
Bankers Association, blamed the miserable performance in
housing construction on rising mortgage rates. Work began on
houses and apartments at a 1,245,000 annual rate in April,
the lowest level since October 1982, when the country was in
a recession.</p>
<p>At the end of April the interest rate on 30-year
fixed-rate mortgages averaged around 11.1% compared with
about 10% at the start of the year, according to the bankers
association.</p>
<p>"Builders are scanning the environment and seeing sales
falling, inventories rising and interest rates on a dramatic
upward trend for four months," said Mr. Peach. "I suspect
that really shook their confidence in going out and starting
new units."</p>
<p>Starts of single-family homes, the core of the housing
market, dropped 7.5% after plummeting 12.5% in March.
Building permits tumbled 8.7%, to an annual rate of
1,125,000.</p>
<p>But mortgage rates have been edging down in May, leading
housing economists to hope for improvement in both home
building and sales during the month.</p>
<p>The numbers in both reports were adjusted for seasonal
fluctuations.</p>
