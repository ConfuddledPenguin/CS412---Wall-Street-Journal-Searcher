	<p class="article-leader">LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Steel Technologies Inc. said it signed
a letter of intent to form a joint venture with the Mitsui
Steel Development Co. unit of Mitsui & Co. of Japan and the
LTV Steel Co. unit of LTV Corp., Dallas, to construct and
operate two facilities capable of processing more than
500,000 tons of steel annually.
   Each of the partners is to own one-third of the joint
venture, said Timothy M. Graven, president of Steel
Technologies. He said the venture plans to spend $30 million
to $35 million to build and equip the facilities.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>He said the venture plans to have the facilities
constructed within 18 months. The facilities will be in the
Midwest, but Steel Technologies wasn't more specific.</p>
<p>Steel Technologies, a processor of flat rolled steel, said
the facilities will use the latest technology in metal
processing, including slitting and cutting the steel to
length. They also will have the capacity to provide steel
storage of about one million tons a year for customers
requiring just-in-time delivery, Steel Technologies said.</p>
