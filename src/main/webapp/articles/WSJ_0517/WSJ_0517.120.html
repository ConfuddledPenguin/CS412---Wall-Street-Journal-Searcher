	<p class="article-leader">DENVER -- Tele-Communications Inc. reported that its net
loss widened in the first quarter, largely as a result of
increased interest expense arising from financing and
servicing debt of several purchases.
   For the quarter, the nation's largest cable television
operator said its loss widened to $57 million, or 16 cents a
share, from $51 million, or 14 cents a share, a year earlier.
However, operating profit -- before interest, depreciation
and amortization expenses -- grew 34% to $330 million from
$247 million. Revenue rose 31% to $861 million from $655
million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Tele-Communications said interest expense rose to $228
million in the quarter from $175 million a year earlier. TCI
pointed to several purchases, including closing of the
purchase in the quarter of TCI/Cooke Systems, with more than
200,000 subscribers, from Jack Kent Cooke Inc. and Cooke
Media Group Inc. for nearly $400 million. TCI also pointed to
the cost of servicing debt incurred to finance other earlier
transactions, including the purchase of a 42.5% indirect
interest in SCI Holdings Inc. and the merger of United
Artists Communications Inc. and United Cable Television Corp.</p>
<p>In the quarter, TCI also purchased additional shares of
cumulative redeemable exchangeable preferred of Storer
Communications Inc., and now owns about five million
preferred shares, or a 40.55% equity stake. TCI said it may
consider additional purchases of Storer securities.</p>
<p>In national over-the-counter trading TCI closed yesterday
at $13.75 a share, down 25 cents.</p>
