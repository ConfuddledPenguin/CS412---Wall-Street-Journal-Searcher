	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Many investors think rapid-fire buying and
selling is the hallmark of a top stock-fund manager.
   Not so, says the Scrooge school of mutual-fund investing.
These penny-pinchers say that one of the keys to investment
success is controlling costs, and that an important sign of a
thrifty fund is a low portfolio turnover rate.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That admonition is controversial. Most stock-picking
styles involve a fair amount of buying and selling. By
avoiding high-turnover funds, investors end up ignoring the
vast majority of mutual funds.</p>
<p>The penny-pinchers, it seems, may be right. Morningstar
Inc., a mutual-fund research firm in Chicago, looked at the
278 domestic stock funds that have been around for the past
decade. The firm found that the slowest 25% in terms of
turnover -- those that on average bought and sold just 23% of
their stocks each year -- returned 15.8% a year during the
decade ended April 30. That compares with 15.1% for the
average stock fund.</p>
<p>No other group of funds did that well. The 25% of funds
with the most rapid portfolio turnover did minutely better
than average, while the middle two quartiles both trailed the
average fund's return by about 0.4% a year.</p>
<p>Clearly, low turnover isn't going to save a lousy stock
picker, nor will high turnover make too much difference to a
talented fund manager. But for fund investors, steering clear
of high-turnover funds is like avoiding broker-sold funds
that charge sales commissions or those with high annual
expenses. It is just another way of tilting the odds in the
investor's favor.</p>
<p>Less buying and selling of stocks clearly means lower
trading costs. But low portfolio turnover may also have other
benefits.</p>
<p>Kenneth Gregory of San Francisco investment advisers
Litman/Gregory & Co. encourages clients to own value-oriented
mutual funds as their core portfolio position. While Mr.
Gregory doesn't stress turnover when picking between funds,
he says a lot of his favorite value funds do have low
turnover.</p>
<p>"The market focuses on a pretty short time horizon, maybe
six months to one year," says Mr. Gregory. "With value
players who are willing to take long-term positions, that
sort of time horizon seems to pay off. A low turnover may
indicate an investor who is dealing in a relatively
inefficient part of the market."</p>
<p>Gerald Perritt, editor of the Mutual Fund Letter, a
Chicago-based newsletter, is surprised that the low-turnover
funds examined by Morningstar didn't do even better. He
thinks he has an explanation. "In the lower-turnover group,
you're going to find funds that invest in smaller company
stocks, and their performance hasn't been all that great
since June of 1983," he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Perritt also thinks that the highest-turnover funds --
those that turn over their entire portfolios every eight
months, or at a 154% annual rate -- would look much worse on
a risk-adjusted basis. "I would suspect that funds with
average portfolio turnover of 154% are extremely risky," he
says. "Why would you have 154% turnover unless you were
dealing with volatile stocks?"</p>
<p>High portfolio turnover also leads to quicker realization
of capital gains as winning stocks are sold, gains that are
taxable for investors. By hanging onto winning stock
positions, a low-turnover fund is effectively sheltering
shareholders from capital gains taxes.</p>
<p>Morningstar's results jibe with an earlier study done by
Mr. Perritt. In 1987, he looked at the 20 stock funds with
the highest and lowest turnover for the period 1984-86. He
found the 20 low-turnover funds had a compound total return
of 50.7% during the three years, compared with 34.1% for the
high-turnover funds.</p>
<p>The 278 funds Morningstar looked at had average turnover
of 79% during the 1980s. Turnover is measured by the lesser
of securities sales or purchases divided by average assets
during the year. For a fund with 79% turnover, that means the
average holding period for a stock is just over 15 months.</p>
<p>Fund investors often don't realize how much turnover is
costing them in brokerage commissions and other transaction
costs. Though the turnover ratio can be found in a fund's
prospectus, and sometimes also in its annual report, the
actual amount of brokerage commissions paid is normally only
disclosed in a supplement to a fund's prospectus known as the
"statement of additional information." Moreover, brokerage
commissions are not included in the annual expense ratio
published by each fund.</p>
<p>A peek at the statement of additional information for the
$150 million Century Shares Trust, which last year had
turnover of just 3%, shows it paid only $10,678 in
commissions to brokers. The $673 million Janus Fund, by
contrast, forked over $2.5 million in commissions for its
205% turnover.</p>
<p>But the cost of turnover isn't just measured by the
brokerage commissions paid. Fund managers also have to
contend with the spread between the bid and ask price on a
stock, as well as the tendency for stock prices to move away
from a large buy or sell order.</p>
<p>"The question is, what's the cost of a turn?" asks Mr.
Perritt. "That really depends on the market size of the stock
you turn. Most of us fund managers are paying anywhere
between four cents and eight cents per share. But the big
thing is the spread. The spread on a round-trip, large-block
trade is probably between 3% and 6%."</p>
<p>James Craig, manager of the top-performing Janus Fund,
begs to disagree. Janus Fund, which returned 20.8% a year on
average over the past decade, regularly chalks up annual
portfolio turnover of 200%; that's the result of a
growth-stock orientation combined with a rigorous
stock-selling discipline. Mr. Craig says careful trading can
avoid huge trading spreads, and he argues that investors
should ignore portfolio turnover when picking between funds.
"The two most important things for mutual-fund investors are
volatility and return," he says.</p>
<p>The low-turnover value funds favored by Mr. Gregory, the
investment adviser, include Lindner Fund, Selected American
Shares and Clipper Fund. Among low-turnover small-company
funds, Mr. Gregory likes Acorn Fund, Babson Enterprise Fund,
GIT Equity Trust-Special Growth and Pennsylvania Mutual Fund.
All these funds can be bought without paying a broker's
commission.</p>

<p>Mutual fund researcher Morningstar Inc. divided 278
domestic stock funds into four groups based on portfolio
turnover -- slowest first -- then looked at their average
annual total return for the decade ending April 30, 1990.</p>
<p>        Buy and Hold Funds        15.81%</p>
<p>        Sluggish Traders          14.59%</p>
<p>        Moderate Turnover Funds   14.66%</p>
<p>        Rapid-Fire Traders        15.09%</p>
<p>        Average of 278 Funds      15.05%</p>
