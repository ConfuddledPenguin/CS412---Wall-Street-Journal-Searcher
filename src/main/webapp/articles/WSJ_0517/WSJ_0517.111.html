in 1987, reported a narrower first-quarter net loss on 11%
higher revenue, sending its publicly traded bonds higher.

plastics and closures, specialized glass and health care --
posted "strong" performances, Owens-Illinois said in a
Securities and Exchange Commission filing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Toledo, Ohio, company, taken private in 1987 for $3.64
