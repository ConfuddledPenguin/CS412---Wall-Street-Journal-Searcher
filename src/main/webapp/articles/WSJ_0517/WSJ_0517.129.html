	<p class="article-leader">Baltimore Bancorp. rejected an unsolicited offer, valued
at $217 million, from First Maryland Bancorp, a unit of
Allied Irish Banks PLC.
   In rebuffing the $17-a-share offer, the Baltimore-based
bank said its financial advisers had determined the offer was
inadequate.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Baltimore shares closed at $14, down 87.5 cents.</p>
<p>The rejection by Baltimore Bancorp. thwarts AIB's plans to
expand its U.S. presence. Officials at First Maryland
declined to comment until they have received Baltimore's
formal response to their offer.</p>
<p>Even before Baltimore's board met late yesterday afternoon
to discuss First Maryland's offer, Harry Robinson,
Baltimore's chairman and chief executive officer, told
shareholders at the company's annual meeting that the bank
was not for sale.</p>
<p>Baltimore also said there was no assurance that an
agreement on a merger transaction could ever be reached
because the proposal was conditioned on a due-diligence
investigation by Allied Irish and its advisers. The process
would have required Baltimore to open its books and records
to First Maryland, a major competitor.</p>
