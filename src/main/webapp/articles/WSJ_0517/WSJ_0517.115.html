	<p class="article-leader">TUCSON, Ariz. -- Tucson Electric Co. raised the
possibility that it might be forced to seek bankruptcy-law
protection from its creditors if various financing plans
aren't successful.
   In a regulatory filing, the company said its "immediate
cash requirements would exceed available credit under
existing bank lines" if some proceeds of certain securities
offerings aren't received or other financing alternatives
aren't completed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company estimated that an additional $120 million will
be needed to meet its cash requirements through year end.</p>
<p>The bankruptcy threat wasn't mentioned at the company's
annual meeting yesterday, where angry shareholders called for
the resignation of company directors and grilled executives
about the company's failed investments and depressed stock
price.</p>
<p>In an interview after the meeting, Charles Bayless, chief
financial officer, said the company disclosed the bankruptcy
possibility upon legal advice, but doesn't think it is a
serious possibility. The company is "more confident now" of
obtaining adequate credit lines than earlier this year, he
said. Tucson Electric also indicated that it plans to ask
state authorities for a rate increase of about 10% by early
summer.</p>
<p>In January, Tucson Electric eliminated its quarterly
dividend on common stock based on its lack of earnings and
inadequate cash flows. Last year, the company had a net loss
of $82.1 million, or $3.55 a share, on revenue of $593.7
million.</p>
