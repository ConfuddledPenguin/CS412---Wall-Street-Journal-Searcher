	<div class="article-body"><p>A survey of European companies and banks found broad
support for elevating the European currency unit, or ECU, to
become the main currency for commerce within the European
Community.</p>
<p>The study, sponsored by the Paris-based Association for
the Monetary Union of Europe, urged that in 1997 the ECU be
declared the sole currency in the EC, replacing the
currencies of the 12 member states. The study, covering 209
European companies and 47 banks, was conducted by Ernst &
Young Management Consultants and the British-based National
Institute of Economic and Social Research.</p>
<p>The ECU is a basket currency made up of weighted values of
12 currencies. Governments and international institutions
have occasionally issued ECU-denominated bonds, and certain
transactions are accounted for in the currency. But it hasn't
gained wide commercial use.</p>
<p>Most of the companies surveyed expected significant
savings to result from a single currency. Companies could
eliminate the costs of hedging against currency fluctuations
and would have clearer information about prices and costs
throughout the EC, the study pointed out.</p>
<p>A STRIKE IN PERU</p>
<p>A strike this week by 12,000 workers of Peru's biggest
mining concern has cost at least $2.8 million, the
government-owned company said. The strike that began Monday
at Central Peru Mining Co., or Centromin, is "causing grave
and perhaps irreversible damage to {the company} and is
endangering its further operations," a company statement
said. The workers are demanding a 137% increase in their
wages, which inflation has shrunk to about $5 per day;
Centromin is offering a 90% increase.</p>
<p>POLAROID IN MOSCOW</p>
<p>Polaroid Corp. opened a new retail shop in Moscow that
will sell the company's cameras to Soviet citizens for
rubles. The cameras, assembled at a Soviet plant from
Polaroid parts, will sell for 250 rubles, about $405, with
instant film going for 30 rubles, a company spokesman said.
The new shop is a joint venture formed by Polaroid and the
Soviet Ministry of Atomic Energy and Industries. Sales were
expected to be about 10,000 cameras in the first year, a
Polaroid official said.</p>
<p>SWITZERLAND AND THE IMF</p>
<p>Switzerland said it will submit an application for
membership in the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank. It said the decision to apply was made after Swiss
finance and monetary officials held exploratory discussions
with their counterparts in the Group of Ten industrial
countries, of which Switzerland is a member. The questions of
what Switzerland's capital quota would be in the IMF and if
it would obtain a seat on the body's executive board remain
open.</p>
<p>THE CIA ON EASTERN EUROPE</p>
<p>Many Eastern European economies will weaken before they
gain strength, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency said in a
report. The CIA predicted it would take years before East
Europeans' living standards rebounded from the damage
inflicted by longtime communist rule. "The region's economic
situation is deteriorating, and there is a prospect for deep
recession," said the report.</p>
<p>KIRIN PROJECT IN CHINA</p>
<p>Kirin Brewery Co., Japan's top beer brewer, said that it
has reached an agreement with another Japanese company and
Chinese interests to establish a joint agribusiness venture
in China. Kirin officials said the new company, to be called
Qingdao International Seeds Co., will be established in
Qingdao sometime this summer and will be owned 45% by Kirin,
5% by Tokita Seeds Co. of Japan and 50% by Chinese interests.
The new company will grow vegetables and flowers and market
them in and outside China.</p>
<p>FRENCH FIRE PREVENTION</p>
<p>Faced with a replay of last year's drought, France is
pouring a record 780 million francs ($141 million) into
fighting and preventing forest fires.</p>
<p>The campaign has begun two months ahead of schedule
because water reserves are less than half those of an average
year, and 33,300 acres of forest have already burned this
year, though the official fire season hasn't begun.</p>
<p>Half the money targets airborne protection from spotter
and water-bombing planes and helicopters. The rest covers
preventive measures such as clearing highly flammable
undergrowth.</p>
<p>Though efforts focus on Southern France, the drought isn't
limited to the sunny Mediterranean. Normally soggy Lower
Normandy is restricting watering of gardens and golf courses,
and washing cars is temporarily banned.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>Australia's state-owned communications company OTC is
developing a computerized speech simulator with an Australian
accent. An OTC spokesman said current voice-reproduction
systems were generally of poor quality and tended to have
strong American accents. . . . Ireland's Family Planning
Association was fined $600 for selling condoms at a Virgin
Records store in Dublin. Under Irish law, condoms can be sold
only in drugstores and family-planning clinics. Richard
Branson, Virgin Records' British chief, said the Irish
government seemed "to be treating their citizens with the
same disregard as Ceausescu did in Romania."</p>
