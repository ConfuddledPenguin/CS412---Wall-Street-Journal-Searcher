	<p class="article-leader">Thank you for Dave Shiflett's excellent Leisure & Arts
article ("Singing in the Acid Rain," April 18) decrying the
emotional environmental brouhaha currently in vogue. The
ballyhoo of some environmentalists reminds me of Mark Twain's
remark: "There is something fascinating about science. One
gets such wholesale returns of conjecture out of such a
trifling investment of facts."
   To make sweeping, irresponsible statements about the
environment is not to convince others of the righteousness of
the cause. It is merely to sacrifice credibility. When the
Earth itself is the issue, none of us benefit from such a
method.</p>
