	<p class="article-leader">Phnom Penh -- "We have two stomachs, the upper for the
soul, the lower for the body. When the upper is hungry, the
lower is also hungry," says Chheng Phon, Cambodia's Minister
of Culture. "Culture is the soul of the nation. So every
Khmer has to think about culture -- except Pol Pot; he wasn't
interested in culture. To restore culture is to restore the
people's soul that was damaged under Pol Pot."
   That may sound like rhetoric, but the spirit and practice
of the idea pervades Phnom Penh. The capital now has two
lively fine arts schools, one teaching music and dance, the
other specializing in the plastic arts, architecture and
archaeology. The combined enrollment is 1,200 students, and
they are dedicated. The concentration on the faces of girls
no more than eight or nine years old being taught classical
Khmer dance banishes any doubts about the practical results
of the Ministry of Culture's high-mindedness.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Phnom Penh again has a professional theater company,
versed in all forms of traditional performing arts and with
some 300 artists and technicians. There are 15 other theater
groups in the capital, as well as regional folkloric troupes
in four provinces.</p>
<p>These achievements all have come since the overthrow of
Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge 10 years ago. During its 3
1/2-year reign of terror, the Khmer Rouge did its best to
wipe clean the slate of Khmer history, destroying traditional
culture and killing those who represented it.</p>
<p>After the Vietnamese invasion in 1979 and subsequent
installation of the Heng Samrin government, officials wanted
to reopen Phnom Penh's Fine Arts School. The number of
professionals in all spheres of music, dance and theater who
had survived Pol Pot totaled just 47, according to one
source. Mr. Chheng estimates that 80% to 90% of Cambodia's
intellectuals -- scientists, engineers, doctors, as well as
artists -- were lost during Pol Pot's reign.</p>
<p>That tragedy, and the subsequent struggle faced by the
Ministry of Culture, were compounded by the fact that
cultural forms had never been recorded. Historically,
teaching had been conducted through a close master-pupil
relationship, and learning was by a kind of osmosis.</p>
<p>Vietnamese troops remained in the country until the
official withdrawal last September. Some commentators have
accordingly tried to suggest that Cambodian culture has been
"Vietnamized." This isn't true.</p>
<p>"Vietnamization? There's none at all," says William
Lobban, an Australian ethnomusicologist working as a
nongovernment agency volunteer with the Ministry of Culture.
"The Vietnamese did suggest the introduction of Western
ballet, but the Khmer resisted, saying they have their own
style of dance. No, the only Vietnamese influence has been in
Western music."</p>
<p>Walking unannounced through the campus of the Fine Arts
School, I heard the strains of a violin coming from one music
practice room, though the distinctive notes of a classical
Khmer instrument wafted loud and clear from another.</p>
<p>There were no signs of a diluted culture. Khmer forms were
to be seen not only in the classrooms, but also outside.
Donated by Unicef, the new dining hall at the dramatic arts
school has been built in traditional style.</p>
<p>The gains of the last 10 years have been made through
sheer hard work and with limited funding. Yet the will is
strong. "One of the reasons why so much effort is being put
into this field is that the people know if they do not have
their culture, they are no longer Khmer. Classical arts are
probably more pure now than before because the people
realized the danger of losing everything," says Mr. Lobban.
"What is so interesting here is the people's sense of
history. When you talk of classical dance, you are referring
directly to Angkor and pre-Angkor times, and yet there is
continual reference to the classical in modern culture. Even
the children have a sense of history and will play at battles
between Khmer and Chams {the two ancient civilizations of the
region}."</p>
<p>For the moment there are only occasional public
performances of classical Khmer dance, but the interest is
there. At a small show put on by students for visiting Unicef
officials, Khmer drivers and guides in the audience appeared
more enthralled than the guests. They laughed out loud at a
comic scene from the "Riemkay" masked dance drama.</p>
<p>In his work at the Ministry of Culture, Mr. Lobban is
collaborating on a photo book cataloging the 5,000 gestures
of classical Khmer dance. He also is writing a volume
describing the 12 different forms of Khmer theater, including
various types of dance, music and shadow puppets.</p>
<p>With a peaceful settlement to the Cambodian conflict still
to be found, continued success in the revival of classical
Khmer culture remains uncertain. "The next five years will be
critical," says Mr. Lobban. "Teachers are getting old, and
there is a generation gap between them and the students. If
we don't get organized now, it'll be too late. There is a
need to get knowledge out of old heads and into new heads or
on video."</p>
<p>But he is optimistic. "There is a tremendous feeling that
it is going to happen. There was never a doubt in people's
minds that after 1979 they could rebuild their culture."</p>
<p>Mr. Chheng expresses similar confidence in his quiet,
assured conversation. "Even though the country is at war, we
are opening secondary schools of fine arts in the provinces."</p>
