	<div class="article-body"><p>ROBERT BUTERBAUGH OF HILTON HEAD, S.C., is a 37-year-old
college graduate who has trouble reading and writing. This
reflects no failure by Michigan's Hillsdale College, his alma
mater, but the fact that he has dyslexia, a neurological
condition that confuses the way a person reads and writes.
"We read differently," is how he explains it.</p>
<p>Mr. Buterbaugh, who grew up in Detroit, credits his
college degree and his success in the real estate business to
his five years at the Gow School, a New York school for
dyslexics. His feelings, however, go far beyond the old
school tie. He has become Gow's chief fund-raiser.</p>
<p>Dyslexics are a special breed. The disorder, first
identified at the end of the last century, affects probably
10% of all men and 3% of women. It is not a visual weakness
(airline pilots can have it) nor does it stifle talent.
Thomas Edison, Albert Einstein and Nelson Rockefeller were
dyslexics; so is Oscar-winner Cher.</p>
<p>Peter Gow, a Buffalo schoolteacher, had been bothered when
obviously bright students performed miserably in class. He
got interested in dyslexia in the 1920s after he met Samuel
Orton, an Iowa neurologist and psychiatrist who had made a
special study of it. The upshot of their meeting was that in
1926 Gow created a special prep school for dyslexics in South
Wales, N.Y., 30 miles from Buffalo.</p>
<p>Bob Buterbaugh arrived as a seventh-grader after his
parents had despaired of his ever getting much further. In
Gow's deliberately small classes -- 10 is the maximum --
young Buterbaugh was able to overcome his handicap
sufficiently to qualify for college, as most Gow graduates
do. A 1977 study of more than 900 Gow alumni by Johns Hopkins
University found that at least 58% earned bachelor's degrees
and 10% went on to graduate schools. Mr. Buterbaugh says he
has taken on the fund-raising chores for Gow to help pay back
the school for what it did for him. He now makes the 952-mile
trek from Hilton Head to Buffalo four or five times a year,
spending two or three days on each visit.</p>
<p>The main base for Gow's fund raising is its 1,200
graduates, and Mr. Buterbaugh is working to get them into a
habit of making regular gifts. For this, he spends much of
his time working his Hilton Head telephone. In two years as a
trustee, he has raised $250,000.</p>
<p>David Gow, the founder's son who at 66 is about to retire
as headmaster, says part of the money will go for more
student aid to help more dyslexic boys meet the school's
$14,000-a-year tuition bill. (So far it is boys only, but Mr.
Gow expects girls before too long. "With schools like V.M.I.
accepting women," he says, "it has to happen.")</p>
<p>Mr. Buterbaugh doesn't confine his philanthropy to Gow.
After Hurricane Hugo smashed into the Carolinas last year, he
left Hilton Head (which was spared) to spend a week around
battered Charleston doing damage assessment for the Red
Cross. But Gow is his first cause.</p>
<p>"I want to find time for this," Mr. Buterbaugh says of his
work with Gow. But so far, he has ignored one Gow precept.
Because dyslexia cannot be cured but only compensated,
students are advised to "find yourself a wife who can spell."
He's still a bachelor.</p>
