	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- U.S. Rep. Henry Waxman charged that the Bush
administration "silenced" a top health official by preventing
him from testifying on U.S. efforts to promote tobacco
exports.
   In a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan, the California Democrat alleged that James Mason,
assistant secretary for health, was "instructed not to
present testimony" at a congressional hearing on cigarette
exports today. James Brown, a spokesman for Dr. Mason, called
the charge "nonsense."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The flap highlights the awkward position the
administration finds itself in over the promotion of smoking.
Dr. Sullivan and Dr. Mason strongly oppose smoking, and Dr.
Sullivan has sharply attacked cigarette advertisements aimed
specifically at women and blacks. But another branch of the
administration, the U.S. trade representative, has been
fighting to tear down foreign barriers to U.S. cigarette
exports. Despite his outspoken opposition to smoking, Dr.
Sullivan has refrained from attacking the export promotion
policy.</p>
<p>Separately, the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee
voted for an anti-smoking bill after deleting a provision
that the tobacco industry complained would interfere with
nationwide advertising campaigns.</p>
<p>As initially introduced by panel Chairman Sen. Edward
Kennedy (D., Mass.), the bill would have repealed a federal
preemption of state advertising regulations. This would have
freed states to set their own standards, making nationwide
advertising campaign impossible. Sen. Kennedy said he removed
the provision to avoid a jurisdictional controversy that
could have bottled up the bill. Remaining provisions of the
legislation would impose new regulations over certain
cigarette additives and finance new federal anti-smoking
campaigns.</p>
<p>The cigarette export issue pits health concerns against
export promotion. Congressional smoking opponents have
launched a spirited campaign to stop the administration from
expanding markets for U.S. tobacco companies by threatening
trade reprisals against Thailand and other countries that
limit tobacco imports.</p>
<p>Dr. Mason had been scheduled to testify today at a hearing
where a number of witnesses, including the head of the
American Cancer Society, are planning to attack the
export-promotion policy. But he withdrew on Tuesday,
provoking Rep. Waxman, chairman of the health panel of the
House Commerce Committee to suggest that "the administration
has refused to permit Dr. Mason's appearance before us."</p>
<p>HHS officials rejected this interpretation, saying that
Dr. Mason decided not to testify after learning from the
department's legislative staff that the hearing was on trade
practices and that an official from the trade
representative's office was going to testify on behalf of the
administration. "I can assure you that the secretary didn't
tell Dr. Sullivan not to go to that hearing," Mr. Brown said.
"And I can assure you that Dr. Sullivan and Dr. Mason will
continue to speak out about smoking and health."</p>
<p>Controversy over smoking is likely to heat up if, as
expected, a proposal to increase the cigarette excise tax
emerges during the budget summit as one of the measures to
lower the deficit.</p>
