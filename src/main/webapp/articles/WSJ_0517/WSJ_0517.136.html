	<p class="article-leader">ICH Corp. said it expects to report a profit for the first
quarter compared with a net loss of $10.7 million, or 37
cents a share, a year earlier.
   The Louisville, Ky.-based insurance holding company said
release of first-quarter results has been delayed because the
company didn't receive financial statements in time from
First Executive Corp., in which ICH has about a 20% stake, or
from the purchaser of Philadelphia Life and the Denver
subsidiaries that ICH sold at the end of the first quarter.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>ICH said it can't be certain that its outlook is accurate
until it has fully reviewed that financial information.</p>
<p>The company said health-insurance operations "have had
improved levels of policy renewals at rates that have
resulted in a somewhat improved ratio of losses to premiums.
As a result, those operations achieved higher revenues and
improved margins, and are ahead of our internal expectations
for this year."</p>
<p>In composite trading yesterday on the American Stock
Exchange, ICH closed at $3.375, unchanged.</p>
