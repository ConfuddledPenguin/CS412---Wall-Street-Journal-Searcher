	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- American Insured Mortgage Investors, a real
estate investment program sponsored by Integrated Resources
Inc., said it is seeking to find a new lender for a mortgage
that represents 62% of its portfolio after the borrower
missed two interest payments.
   Integrated's AIM 84 partnership originated the $99.9
million mortgage, which is federally insured, on Windsor
Court, a high-rise rental apartment in Manhattan. AIM decided
to take the action in light of a soft real estate market that
caused the borrower, Mastic Associates, to miss two interest
payments totaling $1.9 million. The remainder of the
portfolio, which totaled $166 million, includes 20 other
mortgages.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Thomas M. Finn, chief financial officer of AIM Capital
Management Corp., the managing general partner, said AIM 84
would distribute proceeds of the sale to investors in a range
it estimated at $9 to $10 per unit. Investors would continue
to hold an interest in the remainder of the portfolio, which
Mr. Finn said now totals $18 per unit. The partnership, which
is publicly traded, was quoted at $14, up 50 cents, in
over-the-counter trading yesterday.</p>
<p>If AIM 84 fails to sell the mortgage to a lender in 45 to
60 days, it plans to assign it to the Department of Housing
and Urban Development. In that case, AIM 84 would be entitled
to 99% of the mortgage, plus accrued interest minus one
month. Mr. Finn said AIM 84 is negotiating with a lender, but
there isn't any assurance the transaction will be completed,
or completed on these terms.</p>
<p>Regardless of who is assigned the mortgage, investors will
lose the right to participate in the current cash flow or
residual value of the property.</p>
<p>In addition, Integrated, which is operating under federal
bankruptcy-law protection, has been trying to sell its
general partnership interest in the AIM series of
partnerships through a court-approved auction. Mr. Finn said
the price Integrated could expect to receive "would be less"
as a result of the mortgage sale, but he didn't quantify the
impact.</p>
<p>Integrated, which manages more than 600 partnerships, has
been trying to sell assets to satisfy creditors, who are owed
$1.8 billion. Integrated has said it would accept a minimum
bid of $40 million for its interest in four AIM partnerships
sold in the mid-1980s that raised a total of $789 million.</p>
