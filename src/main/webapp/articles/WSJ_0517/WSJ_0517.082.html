	<p class="article-leader">CUPERTINO, Calif. -- World-wide semiconductor sales are
expected to remain flat this year compared with 1989, before
growing at a double-digit rate through 1993, the
Semiconductor Industry Association said.
   The trade group projected semiconductor sales would reach
$48.4 billion in 1990, down nearly 1% from 1989 sales of
$48.8 billion. In 1991, sales are projected at $54.5 billion,
a 12.8% increase from this year; in 1992, sales are expected
to total $65.2 billion; in 1993, sales are estimated at $74.7
billion, the trade group said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"For the most part, all market segments should experience
double-digit growth in 1991, 1992, and 1993," said Doug
Andrey, the trade group's director of industry statistics.
"Substantial growth in the MOS Logic and MOS Memory markets
will be the key factors for these increases."</p>
<p>The market growth takes into account a stable U.S. dollar
exchange rate through the balance of the forecast, the trade
group said.</p>
