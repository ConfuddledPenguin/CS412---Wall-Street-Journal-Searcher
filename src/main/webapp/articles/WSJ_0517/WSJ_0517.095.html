	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- For nearly a year, President Bush has argued
that his lenient policy toward China would moderate that
repressive regime's behavior. Now, as he considers a
controversial renewal of a lucrative trade benefit for
Beijing, that case is tough to make.
   Mr. Bush's determination to maintain ties with Beijing
over the past year has generated bitter criticism in
Washington, sent conflicting signals to U.S. allies and upset
dissidents in China. Meanwhile, here's what Mr. Bush has
gotten in return from Beijing:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>-- Even as China sought to improve its image in the West
last week by releasing some prisoners it took during the June
massacre of pro-democracy students at Tiananmen Square, a
Florida businessman was being arrested by U.S. Customs agents
for plotting to illegally ship China computer components that
have military uses. And Beijing's Washington embassy was
planning to intimidate Chinese students through visits to
U.S. college campuses.</p>
<p>-- In December, as National Security Adviser Brent
Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger
made their second visit to Beijing and toasted China's
leaders with champagne, China began jailing Roman Catholic
priests, bishops and laymen who supported the pro-democracy
movement, according to Asia Watch, a human-rights group.</p>
<p>-- Despite numerous U.S. requests, China continues to
supply weapons to Cambodia's Khmer Rouge guerrillas, who
slaughtered more than one million people during their
three-year reign. China also recently signed a 10-year
military technology agreement with Iran and is a regular arms
supplier to other Mideast nations.</p>
<p>"Bush's policy has been an embarrassment for the country,"
said Rep. Samuel Gejdenson (D., Conn.), who heads a House
subcommittee that oversees trade issues. "The president's
longtime relations with the leaders of China seem to cloud
his ability to see what's in the best interest of the Chinese
people."</p>
<p>That view is expressed across the political spectrum.
"There is a disturbing general pattern in administration
actions: waivers, vetoes and unrequited conciliatory moves --
and above all the double standard between China and support
for democracy elsewhere," said Winston Lord, U.S. ambassador
to China during the Reagan administration, at a congressional
hearing yesterday. "Repression has really deepened" in China
in the past year, added Holly Burkhalter, Washington director
of Asia Watch, who also testified.</p>
<p>These criticisms are sure to flare anew as Mr. Bush mulls
whether to renew China's most-favored nation trade status,
which entitles it to the same treatment as America's other
trading partners. Some critics say Mr. Bush's lenient
attitude toward Beijing, which sent a signal of
business-as-usual, now further complicates the decision, even
if a renewal were accompanied by rhetoric calling on China to
alter its behavior.</p>
<p>During a White House news conference yesterday, Mr. Bush
said he hasn't made a decision yet. "It isn't an easy call
because I don't want to send a signal that we are happy with
the human rights record," he said. Mr. Bush's tolerant
attitude toward Beijing over the past year would suggest he
is at least leaning toward extending the trade benefit. "I
still am of the mind that having contact and working in an
area where there has been progress -- on the economic side --
with China is important," he said.</p>
<p>Even some members of Mr. Bush's administration wonder
privately why the president continues to pursue a policy with
so little gain. One expert believes that Mr. Bush, a former
envoy to China, sees the bloody events of last June 4 as an
aberration, rather than a fundamental decison by the aging
leadership to cling to power. Other supporters assert that
conditions would grow worse if the U.S. attempted to isolate
China.</p>
<p>But other experts say that Mr. Bush's actions have damaged
his credibility with America's allies. The U.S. labored to
produce a joint statement condemning China's actions last
July at the economic summit in Paris. The allies learned
later that during that same month Mr. Bush had secretly
dispatched Messrs. Scowcroft and Eagleburger to Beijing, even
as he was promising to ban high-level diplomatic meetings
with China.</p>
<p>Moreover, notes Jonathan Pollack, a China expert and head
of the political-science department at Rand Corp., Mr. Bush
further confused U.S. allies and bolstered China's feeling of
self-importance during a news conference in January. He
suggested that it was crucial to cultivate China because it
was a counterweight in Asia to Japan's imposing presence.
State Department officials contend that analysis is faulty
and probably reinforces Beijing's notion that the U.S. isn't
serious about trying to punish it. "Sending such a signal is
dumb," says Mr. Pollack.</p>
<p>The administration's unwillingness to strongly condemn
China's leaders for the massacre also has alienated members
of the younger generation who may be leading China in the
future.</p>
<p>Asia Watch estimates that between 10,000 and 30,000
Chinese dissidents have been arrested since June. No one is
certain how many remain in jail. In January, China announced
that it was releasing 573 political prisoners, but State
Department officials note that because Beijing didn't provide
a list of their names, the U.S. isn't sure how many actually
were freed. Similarly, last week's announcement that 211
prisoners were being released was accompanied by a list of
only about a half-dozen names.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush must decide before June 3 whether to renew
China's most-favored nation status. If he does, Congress may
pass a joint resolution opposing his action. However, Mr.
Bush can veto the resolution, and Congress would need a
two-thirds majority in both houses to override it.</p>
<p>Some congressional aides say that it will be difficult to
muster two-thirds support if the president extends the
most-favored nation status. An intense campaign by U.S.
companies that import goods from China already is under way
to persuade lawmakers to support continuing the trade benefit
to China. Last week, for instance, Sparkomatic Corp., which
sells electronic products to such national retailers as K
mart and Wal-Mart, circulated a letter on Capitol Hill
warning that if most-favored nation status is lifted some
import duties would rise to 35% from 3.7%, making "many of
our most important products noncompetitive."</p>
<p>The conservative Heritage Foundation, in a paper issued
last week, also noted that about 65% of China's exports to
the U.S. first go to Hong Kong for packaging and shipping. As
a result, Hong Kong's economy would be hard-hit if China's
most-favored nation trade status were lost, the study found.
But it didn't make a recommendation on renewing the status.</p>
<p>Because of the pressure and the complexity of the issue,
even some lawmakers like Rep. Stephen Solarz (D., N.Y.),
chairman of the House Asian affairs subcommittee and an
outspoken critic of the president's China policy over the
last year, are ambivalent on the most-favored nation issue.
Late yesterday, Rep. Solarz said it would be appropriate to
extend most-favored nation status if Mr. Bush accompanied it
with certain actions. He said the president should make
"strong tributes" to those killed at Tiananmen Square, commit
the U.S. to maintain existing sanctions, and state that
subsequent renewals will depend on China's making progress on
human rights in the coming year.</p>
<p>"Nobody sounds like they're all fired up to go to the mat
on China," says Roger Sullivan, president of the U.S.-China
Business Council, which supports extending most-favored
nation status. "And I can understand why."</p>
