	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Futures-markets investors can expect higher
trading margins, tighter market surveillance, and more
skeptical review of new financial products if the Securities
and Exchange Commission wins its battle to oversee
stock-index futures.
   Investors also may see the SEC tinkering with the way
index futures are traded on the Chicago and New York
exchanges, as well as the way investment suitability is
handled, regulatory and industry officials say.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Those are just a few of the issues the SEC could take on
if Congress endorses the Bush administration's proposal to
shift regulation of stock-index futures to the securities
agency from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
Currently, the SEC regulates stock and options trading, but
it and the Treasury Department have been pushing to get index
futures switched.</p>
<p>While the jurisdictional debate has by no means been
settled and could well end in a stalemate, debate is raging
in Washington and at the exchanges over how the index-futures
market would change under new overseers.</p>
<p>Stock-index futures, first traded in 1982, are one of the
nation's fastest-growing investment products. Traded
similarly to other futures products on the commodity
exchanges, they allow investors to bet on the movement of a
basket of stocks without owning the actual shares. They are
most often used by large institutional investors to offset
risk in a portfolio -- a technique called hedging.</p>
<p>SEC officials have grown gun-shy about discussing how they
might regulate index futures. "That's much too much of a hot
potato," said one market-regulation official recently when
asked to comment on the issue. But interviews with agency
officials before the imposition of the media blackout,
statements at public hearings and comments by people in touch
with regulators show that the SEC clearly has some things in
mind.</p>
<p>To be sure, not even futures loyalists expect the agency
to wreak immediate and sweeping changes. "My guess is that to
avoid people like me standing up and saying I told you so,
they would regulate them at first exactly the same as the
CFTC does," said John Damgard, who heads the Futures Industry
Association. "But ultimately they would play to their
audiences," the securities firms and exchanges, he says.</p>
<p>Many of those constituents -- as well as SEC and Treasury
officials -- have been calling for higher margins. When
futures margins, which are set by the exchanges, slip too
low, the extra leverage can trigger sharp moves in stock
futures that spill over into the stock market, they argue.</p>
<p>"We would certainly take a look at margins, assuming we
would have the authority," Richard Ketchum, the SEC's head of
market regulation, said in an interview last month. SEC
Chairman Richard Breeden also has urged higher margins,
proposing a national "speed limit" that would set a floor on
futures margins, the good faith money required for trades.</p>
<p>Futures-exchange officials, aware of administration
sentiment, have boosted margins sharply in the past two
months. Currently, for example, margins on the most popular
contract, based on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index,
stand at $20,000, or 11%, for speculators. That's more than
twice the $9,000 level of last September.</p>
<p>If the S&P 500 margin was raised to 20%, a figure Mr.
Breeden has floated, the initial deposit for speculators
would jump to more than $35,000, based on current price
levels. Barry Lind, chairman of Lind-Waldock & Co., Chicago,
the largest discount futures-brokerage firm, contends that
that level would throttle retail trading in stock-index
futures, pushing retail customers to other, lower-margin
contracts, such as soybean or foreign currency futures.</p>
<p>But retail, or individual, customers account for only
about 5% of S&P 500 stock-index futures trading volume at the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, staffers there say. The two
largest groups of users, local traders in the pits and
institutional customers, usually don't trade on margin.
Locals trade on margin only if they hold positions overnight
-- which is rare for these independent traders who often
trade in and out of positions within minutes. Institutional
customers investing money for pensions -- the bulk of the
institutional business -- are prohibited by federal law from
trading on margin.</p>
<p>Futures money managers who trade actively on margin might
have trading damped by higher margins, though traders say the
big managers wouldn't have any problem pulling cash out of
other markets to make a major bet on stock indexes.</p>
<p>But the SEC may have other changes in mind, in addition to
higher margins. As former SEC commissioner Joseph Grundfest
notes, "If you want to change margins you don't have to
change jurisdiction."</p>
<p>For example, the SEC would be forced to decide how to
handle trading-floor surveillance procedures. Currently, it
cedes that responsibility to the stock exchanges, while the
CFTC employs surveillance personnel to patrol the pits.</p>
<p>Despite that floor presence, and despite the stock
market's insider-trading scandals, the Chicago exchanges have
long been perceived as being weaker in policing trading than
are the stock exchanges. The CFTC, which was created in 1975,
was roundly criticized last year after a federal undercover
operation turned up widespread trading fraud on the Chicago
markets. The agency has moved to fix those problems, but SEC
staffers privately point to those difficulties and swear they
would never happen on the stock exchanges.</p>
<p>Conversely, however, the agency historically has been more
willing to allow new products, industry observers note. While
that is partly a result of the more-innovative spirit of the
futures markets, the SEC has been a cautious regulator,
officials at both agencies say. These regulators, who
declined to be named, suggest the SEC might stifle
innovation.</p>
<p>The SEC's cautiousness stems in part from its creation
during the New Deal to protect investors following the 1929
crash. Stock and options investors must clear a suitability
test to be certain the products are appropriate investments.
The futures markets have no similar test. "The SEC has a
regulatory philosophy pervading the agency that goes toward
investor protection," says Mr. Damgard, the futures industry
lobbyist. "But the futures investor needs much less
protection."</p>
<p>That same Depression-era philosophy spawned the SEC's
"uptick" rule, which allows stock-market investors to short
stocks only if the last recorded price move is up. That rule
was designed to keep short sellers, who bet that a stock will
fall, from ganging up on shares and driving them down. "It's
the old philosophy that everyone here wants to see the
markets go up," says one high-level SEC staffer.</p>
<p>But the futures markets have no similar rule, and futures
price moves mainly have daily price limits to rein them in.
The SEC would have to decide whether to carry the uptick rule
into the futures markets.</p>
<p>For some observers, the move of stock-index futures, which
represent about 5% of the total futures volume, is simply a
test for moving other futures to the SEC. "It's only 5% of
the market, so in that sense it might be a good prototype for
combining all regulation down the line," says Thomas Russo, a
New York securities and commodities lawyer who advocates
merging the agencies. "It's probably a good experiment."</p>
