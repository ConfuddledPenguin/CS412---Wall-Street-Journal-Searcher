	<p class="article-leader">The Federal Aviation Administration ordered airlines to
inspect pilot controls on three models of Boeing Co.'s
popular 737 jetliner, after a missing cotter pin caused a
control wheel to come off in a co-pilot's hands.
   The agency said Seattle-based Boeing, which reported the
in-flight incident Monday, had discovered a second airplane
with a cotter pin missing when it conducted an inspection on
airliners being readied for delivery at its Renton, Wash.,
plant. A Boeing spokesman said the plane landed safely after
the pilot took over on the second set of controls.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>An FAA spokesman said the airline that experienced the
in-flight problem was West German, but he wouldn't identify
it, as a matter of policy. The only West German carriers
Boeing lists as flying the 737-400, the 146-seat model that
had the problem, are named Hapag Lloyd and Bavaria.</p>
<p>The Boeing spokesman said a total of 1,857 of the
company's various-model 737 twin-engine jets have been
delivered to 19 U.S. operators and 147 airlines.</p>
<p>The inspection order covers only newer-model 737-300s,
737-400s and 737-500s, the FAA said. Boeing said 94 of the
737-400s, 609 of the 128-seat 737-300s and 10 of the
108-passenger 737-500s are being operated world-wide.</p>
<p>A so-called airworthiness directive for U.S. carriers,
which generally is also followed by foreign airlines, was
sent out by the FAA's Northwest Mountain Region headquarters
in Seattle. It calls for a one-time inspection within 72
hours of the control-wheel installation for cotter-pin
installation and damage to the attached bolts. The West
German airline also reported damage to threads of a bolt that
is part of the control-wheel assembly.</p>
<p>The Boeing spokesman said the steel cotter pin is
installed by mechanics into a control-wheel subassembly at
the company's Portland, Ore., facility, and connected within
the cockpit on the 737 production line in Renton by
mechanics. Discovery of the second plane with the defect
"obviously concerns us," he said, and further study is under
way at Boeing.</p>
<p>The work required by the FAA apparently isn't costly, but
it does suggest that Boeing might not have solved
production-line quality problems that have plagued it in
recent years.</p>
<p>In 1989, after flaws were discovered in fire-extinguisher
systems in the engines and cargo bays of some aircraft, a
world-wide inspection resulted in reports of a total of 94
separate instances of defects, on almost every Boeing model.</p>
<p>As the fire-extinguisher problems were being tallied, the
regional office of the FAA wrote Boeing that it was concerned
that "unsafe conditions" might have resulted from
"inadequacies in several areas of the company, including
basic design of electronic components, manufacturing,
production inspection quality and suppliers."</p>
<p>Boeing, which claims its quality problems aren't systemic,
has said it has taken steps to improve production-line
quality, including redesign of the fire-extinguisher wiring
to prevent installation of the devices with crossed wires.</p>
<p>The electrical problems had followed letters that two of
Boeing's biggest customers, Japan Air Lines and British
Airways, had sent to the manufacturer complaining about
quality problems on planes they had received.</p>
