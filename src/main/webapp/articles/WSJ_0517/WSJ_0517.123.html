	<p class="article-leader">Del Webb Corp. said a nonbinding shareholder resolution to
remove the company's anti-takeover provisions is winning
support from the Phoenix, Ariz., real estate developer's
shareholders, based on a preliminary tally.
   The proposal by Los Angeles-based Webbcott Holdings, which
owns a 9.7% stake and is controlled by director James J.
Cotter, would request that the board redeem shareholder
rights issued under a "poison pill" plan adopted last year.
Less than half the votes have been tallied, but a company
spokesman said a "significant majority" of the votes counted
so far support the resolution. A final tally isn't expected
for several days.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In April, Webb agreed to several of Mr. Cotter's demands
to avert a proxy fight at yesterday's annual meeting. Mr.
Cotter had planned to offer a rival slate of directors and
wanted to eliminate "golden parachute" provisions for senior
management. Webb agreed to expand the board by two members,
and renominate four of 10 directors whose terms were set to
expire, including Mr. Cotter.</p>
