	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- French consumer prices in April rose a
preliminary 0.4% from March and 3.2% from a year earlier, the
National Statistics Institute said.
   The April result follows a definitive monthly gain of 0.3%
in March, while the latest year-to-year rate is down from
3.4% in the previous month. Both figures are in line with
previous forecasts by economists, who had anticipated a
slight acceleration in April as a result of technical
pressure on service prices.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The decline in year-to-year price growth, despite the
higher monthly result, reflects an unusually high 0.6%
increase in consumer prices in April 1989.</p>
