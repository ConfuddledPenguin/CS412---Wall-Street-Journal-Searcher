	<p class="article-leader">Chief Justice William Rehnquist went on the hustings this
week to urge that the courts be freed of a death-penalty
appeals process that leaves the justice system tied up in
knots years after any argument about guilt or innocence has
been settled. He told a law-reform group that the current
system "verges on the chaotic." Typical delays between
sentence and execution run to more than seven years. A man
who killed a state trooper in 1977 is finally scheduled to be
executed in Louisiana tomorrow.
   "At no point until a death sentence is actually carried
out can it be said that litigation concerning the sentence
has run its course," Chief Justice Rehnquist said. He also
noted that voters in 37 states have approved the death
penalty, which means that unelected federal judges endanger
both democracy and federalism when they obstruct capital
punishment for convicted murderers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Chief Justice Rehnquist thought he had solved this problem
last year with the recommendations of a group of judges
headed by former Justice Lewis Powell Jr. They proposed
limiting the number of federal appeals in most cases to two
if states would provide a free lawyer to handle them for the
prisoner. A group of judges in the Judicial Conference who
oppose the death penalty have tried to sandbag this
Powell-Rehnquist proposal, which the Senate will take up next
week.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is not the only proposal on the table.
Senator Joe Biden has a bill that, amazingly, would add to
delays by reversing Supreme Court cases that limited some
appeals. It would also create a right to appeal for a vaguely
defined "miscarriage of justice." An amendment by Teddy
Kennedy would effectively abolish the death penalty by
barring it when there is a "racially discriminatory pattern"
in such cases.</p>
<p>Whether one agrees or disagrees that constitutionally
sound death penalties are good public policy, so long as
states allow them federal judges have no right to interfere.
Too many do. One reason inmates file appeal after appeal is
that they know that in time they will land with a judge who
will rule favorably because he opposes the policy of capital
punishment. These so-called habeas corpus appeals are limited
only by the imagination. One convict recently tried to
persuade the Supreme Court that the death penalty applies
disproportionately to blacks and so his sentence should be
overturned -- even though he is white.</p>
<p>As chief administrator of the federal courts, Chief
Justice Rehnquist worries especially about the huge amount of
court time that goes to these appeals. In a case decided in
March that threw all North Carolina death penalties into
doubt, Justice Antonin Scalia called the newest procedural
hurdle "the sort of argument that causes state legislators to
pull their hair." He found "new substance to the charge that
we have been administering a `bait and switch' capital
sentencing jurisprudence."</p>
<p>The delays and obstructions leave 2,200
multiple-murderers, rapist-murderers, cop-killers and
pusher-murderers on death row. We can find one bright spot,
though, in William Rehnquist's frustrations with the legal
system. It can't be entirely bad that the Chief Justice of
the U.S. discovers for himself how bad laws, cumbersome
procedures and recalcitrant judges can create foolish
results.</p>
