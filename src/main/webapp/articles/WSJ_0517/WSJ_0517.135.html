	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Senate approved the nomination of David
Mullins to the Federal Reserve Board.
   Mr. Mullins will leave his post as the assistant Treasury
secretary for domestic finance to serve out the term vacated
by Robert Heller, who left the Fed last year to become an
executive vice president of Visa International. Mr. Mullins's
term at the Fed will expire in 1996.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Mullins, a former Harvard Business School professor,
was a principal author of the Bush administration's plan to
bail out the savings-and-loan industry. Before coming to the
Treasury, he was a top staffer on a task force set up by
former President Reagan to investigate the 1987 stock market
crash.</p>
