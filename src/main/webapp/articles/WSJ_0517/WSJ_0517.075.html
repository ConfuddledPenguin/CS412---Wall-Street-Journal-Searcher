	<p class="article-leader">SAVIN Corp. shareholders approved a 1-for-5 reverse stock
split for the Stamford, Conn., copier and facsimile
marketer's 132 million shares outstanding. Management had
proposed the split, according to the annual-meeting proxy
material, to bring Savin's stock "to a more appropriate
trading price for a company concerned with long-term
development of its business opportunities." Savin, which is
55%-controlled by HCS Technology N.V. of the Netherlands,
hasn't yet set a record or payment date for the split. Savin
holders also passed a proposal under which HCS could continue
to receive dividends on the Savin Series C preferred shares
it holds, but HCS won't vote the shares that accrue as
dividends. HCS recently agreed to form a 50-50 joint venture
with the West German group Hoechst AG. Based in the
Netherlands, the venture will market and service office
equipment in Europe.</p>
