	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Federal housing officials offered an
unprecedented $16 million bailout loan to the well-connected
developers of a huge and troubled apartment complex here that
already has received a series of unusual government favors.
   Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack
Kemp made the offer hoping to avert what would be the
biggest-ever HUD foreclosure on a housing project. HUD
officials estimated the agency would lose $87 million if it
had to pay off the $159 million balance on the mortgage on
Presidential Towers and sell the 2,346-apartment development
at its market value.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>HUD set as a condition of the loan offer that the
developers and their partners pitch in another $13 million.
However, one of the developers indicated they weren't
inclined to invest anywhere near that amount.</p>
<p>Built by three developers with close ties to House Ways
and Means Committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski -- who helped
them win lucrative financing favors -- Presidential Towers
defaulted on its Federal Housing Administration-insured
mortgage in February after months of financial problems. Last
year, the developers asked HUD for a so-called operating loss
loan of $16 million to see them through a projected six-year
turnaround period.</p>
<p>HUD, however, estimates it will take eight years and $26
million to turn around the project, which consists of four
49-story towers and a connecting atrium on the western edge
of Chicago's downtown area.</p>
<p>The single biggest operating loss loan HUD has made to
date was $2.5 million, an agency official said, and the
longest projected turnaround period on such a loan was five
years; HUD doesn't normally make such loans unless the
project is expected to break even within two years.</p>
<p>Despite the huge potential loss for the government, the
project has been personally profitable for at least one of
its developers, James P. McHugh. He received $4 million in
fees for construction work that his firm performed. Mr.
McHugh said his total profit was $4.5 million on the more
than $100 million construction project. He defended that
amount as being below normal levels for a job of that size.</p>
<p>The two other developers are Daniel E. Levin, who together
with Mr. McHugh owns a property-management firm that is paid
to operate Presidential Towers, and Daniel J. Shannon, a
longtime friend of Mr. Rostenkowski's who produced some big
profits for the congressman while managing his blind
investment trust.</p>
<p>Mr. Rostenkowski has denied any connection between the
trust profits and his help with arranging the government
financing of Presidential Towers, which he said he did to
help redevelop the city of Chicago.</p>
<p>A limited partnership also raised $59 million for the
project, but getting more money from those investors seems
unlikely because changes in the tax code have made such
investments less profitable, Mr. McHugh said.</p>
<p>The three developers' combined net worth was said to be
more than $20 million in partnership documents, but Mr.
McHugh said the $13 million investment requirement by HUD is
far bigger than anything they had considered. "I don't have
$13 million to risk," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Levin wouldn't comment on how much he would commit,
but said: "We're hopeful we'll work something out. We don't
build developments just to make fees and walk away. We don't
walk away from things." Messrs. McHugh and Levin are among
the Midwest's biggest developers of apartment buildings and
have been in the business for 25 years.</p>
<p>The developers spent about $7.5 million getting
Presidential Towers started, and they were reimbursed for
those expenses. They made advances of $331,759 to the project
to help cover operating losses.</p>
<p>James Logue, HUD's deputy assistant secretary for
multifamily housing, said he hadn't discussed HUD's proposal
with the developers, but said the terms aren't negotiable.
"These are basically the conditions under which we could see
ourselves making an operating loss loan," he said.</p>
<p>Even if HUD and the developers can come to an agreement,
Presidential Towers represents a big gamble. The project has
had a higher vacancy rate and lower rents than projected, as
well as a big increase in property taxes. The Chicago market
for high-rise apartments is glutted, and as Presidential
Towers gets older it could have more difficulty competing
with newer buildings.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Mr. Levin is among the developers of a new
904-apartment development under construction here.</p>
