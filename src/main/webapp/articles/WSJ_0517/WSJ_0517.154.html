	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- The pace of growth in lending activities by
Japanese financial institutions during the January-to-March
quarter amounted to 42.3% over the pace of growth during the
year-earlier period, The Bank of Japan reported.
   The pace of growth in lending by large Japanese commercial
banks for the period was 42.1% while the pace in lending by
regional banks amounted to 50.7%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A central bank official said much of the growth reflected
an increase in foreign-currency-denominated -- or "impact" --
loans by Japanese financial institutions, as opposed to
yen-denominated lending.</p>
