	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Northrop Corp. said it is counting on a
strong rebound in 1990 profitability, although Wall Street
reacted skeptically to indications from its chief executive
officer that the defense contractor is seeking to earn as
least $163 million this year.
   In a news conference after Northrop's annual meeting, Kent
Kresa, president and chief executive, said he hopes the
company would achieve better than a 10% return on stockholder
equity this year, excluding the $67 million gain the company
recorded in the first quarter from sale of its headquarter
complex here.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Based on first-quarter shareholder equity of $960.7
million, that would indicate at least $96 million, with total
net income approximating at least $163 million. In 1989,
Northrop had a net loss of $80.5 million, or $1.71 a share,
although in the 1990 first quarter, net income surged to $96
million, or $2.04 a share, including the gain from the
headquarter sale.</p>
<p>Northrop traditionally doesn't forecast corporate
earnings.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Northrop shares closed at $17.50, up 12.5 cents.</p>
<p>Mr. Kresa also said the company plans a reduction in
employment of about 3,000, or 7%, this year from a current
work force of 41,000. Employment was cut by about 2,500 last
year.</p>
<p>The reduction in employment reflects attempts to reduce
overhead expenses at Northrop, which is the prime contractor
for the Pentagon's B-2 Stealth bomber and for the YF-23
Advanced Tactical Fighter, one of two competing designs for
the next generation of Air Force fighters.</p>
<p>Mr. Kresa said better inventory management and the efforts
to reduce overhead will facilitate a planned major reduction
of Northrop's current debt of $1 billion. He said the
company's "financial projections show that we will eliminate
our present debt by the mid-1990s."</p>
<p>The Defense Department's proposal to cut the number of
B-2s to be acquired to 75 from 132 will lead Northrop to
"reduce the size of our B-2 operations accordingly," the
executive said. He said about 500 of the employee cuts could
be directly associated with the Stealth bomber. As a way of
"capitalizing on the reduced requirements for B-2
manufacturing," he said, Northrop would carry out full-scale
development work on the ATF at the same Pico Rivera, Calif.,
facility where work on the B-2 is in progress. He said the
Air Force would benefit from having the fighter developed at
a leading aircraft-development facility.</p>
<p>The company also will continue to sell assets that "don't
match the business environment we see ahead of us, or where
we feel better use can be made of the assets," he said.
Northrop's longer-term goal is for "returning over the next
few years to at least a 20% return on equity," Mr. Kresa told
shareholders.</p>
<p>David Smith, who follows aerospace concerns for the
securities firm of Raymond, James & Associates in St.
Petersburg, Fla., said the investment community "didn't even
blink" at Mr. Kresa's hopes for earnings. That suggests,
according to Mr. Smith, that "the market is saying I don't
believe you." Mr. Smith, like other analysts, however, hasn't
forecast earnings for the company because of a history of
unpredictability that includes numerous write-downs from
weapons programs.</p>
<p>Mr. Smith also suggested that the efforts to pay down
debt, tighten operations and purchase shares of Northrop
stock for the company's retirement plan could be part of a
"scenario that could involve taking the company private." Mr.
Kresa also said at the meeting that 1.2 million additional
shares of Northrop stock had been purchased for the
retirement plan, putting a significant stake in employee
hands.</p>
<p>A Northrop spokesman said the firm doesn't have any plans
to go private.</p>
