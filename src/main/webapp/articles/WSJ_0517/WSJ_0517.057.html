	<p class="article-leader">GENEVA -- Members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade agreed to the Soviet Union's request for observer
status with the world trade group, a spokesman said.
   David Woods said Soviet officials attended a meeting of
GATT's top decision-making body yesterday after it
unanimously approved Moscow's application.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Rufus Yerxa told the
council meeting that a Soviet presence in GATT would boost
its understanding of the world trading system and so help its
own economic reform process.</p>
<p>Washington last year dropped its opposition to the Soviet
Union gaining observer status in GATT but sought to delay
that until December. Mr. Yerxa said the Bush administration
agreed to an earlier Soviet entry, since it was backed by
"nearly all" GATT members.</p>
