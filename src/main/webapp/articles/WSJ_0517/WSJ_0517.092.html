	<p class="article-leader">Jim Henson, who died yesterday at age 53 of a massive
bacterial infection, had already begun numerous projects at
Walt Disney Co. since Disney agreed to acquire his company
last year. And these projects will go forward as planned,
executives said.
   "We vow to do all that we can to see that the
extraordinary legacy of this great friend and colleague will
live on," the company said in a statement.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Henson created the Muppets and a host of other
characters known world-wide. Last August, Disney agreed to
acquire New York-based Henson Associates Inc. (which excludes
Mr. Henson's participation in the television characters on
"Sesame Street") for about $100 million to $150 million. Mr.
Henson has been active in every phase of Disney's operation
since then, although the transaction has not been formally
completed.</p>
<p>At Disney's theme parks, a Muppet show and daily parades
are scheduled to begin at Walt Disney World's Disney-MGM
Studios in Orlando, Fla., on June 15. Mr. Henson was
finishing up a filmed attraction set to open at Disney-MGM
next year and at Disneyland in California in 1993. A "Muppet
Movie Ride" is scheduled to open at Disney-MGM in 1993.
Disney officials say they don't expect any delays in the
projects.</p>
