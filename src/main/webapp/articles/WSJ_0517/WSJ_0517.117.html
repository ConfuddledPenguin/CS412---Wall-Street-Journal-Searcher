	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A U.S. bankruptcy court here permitted Ames
Department Stores Inc. to receive $250 million in interim
financing so the company can purchase goods from hesitant
suppliers.
   Stephen L. Pistner, chief executive officer of Ames,
called the court's ruling "very good news for Ames's
creditors, employees, customers and suppliers." Ames has said
suppliers have refused to ship goods and extend credit since
the company filed for bankruptcy court protection last month.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Pistner said that "merchandise shipments should be
back to normal in very short order." Chemical Bank, a unit of
Chemical Banking Corp., is the lender of the $250 million.</p>
<p>Bankruptcy court Judge Howard Buschman said Ames needed
only $150 million for current purchases, and that the
additional $100 million was needed as an inducement for
suppliers to extend credit on normal terms.</p>
<p>Creditors with other loans outstanding to Ames initially
objected to the new loan, raising concerns about their
repayment priority in relation to Chemical. The court
approved the new loan after the 33 lenders reached agreement
on repayment priorities, and on terms for splitting $91
million in an Ames cash collateral account.</p>
<p>The troubled discount retailer operates about 600 stores
in 20 states.</p>
