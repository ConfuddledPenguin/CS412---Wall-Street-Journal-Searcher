	<p class="article-leader">PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Hewlett-Packard Co. reported an 8%
decline in net income for its fiscal second quarter ended
April 30.
   Though the results were squarely in line with analysts'
expectations, Hewlett-Packard's stock skidded on the news,
closing down $1.875 at $46.125 in composite trading on the
New York Stock Exchange. Analysts said management's cautious
forecast of future business and the disclosure that the
company was losing share in the market for computer
workstations sent the stock tumbling.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The slip in workstations market share is particularly
worrisome since Hewlett-Packard recently was vying with Sun
Microsystems Inc. for the top spot in the segment. Last year,
Hewlett-Packard bought Apollo Computer Inc., its biggest
acquisition ever, with an eye toward commanding a sizable
share of the workstation business, which is growing rapidly.</p>
<p>"From their comments, it's clear that Sun is gaining share
and IBM's entry {into the workstation business} is having an
impact on HP," said Steven Milunovich, an analyst at First
Boston Corp., referring to comments made by Hewlett-Packard
executives yesterday during a conference call.</p>
<p>Orders for Hewlett-Packard's personal computers also have
slowed and are flat compared with last year, Mr. Milunovich
said.</p>
<p>Net income for the quarter totaled $186 million, compared
with $203 million in the year-ago period. The company had
per-share earnings of 78 cents, down 9% from 86 cents in the
year-ago quarter.</p>
<p>Revenue for the quarter was $3.3 billion, an increase of
16% from the year-ago quarter.</p>
<p>Hewlett-Packard, which makes medical equipment,
instruments and other electronic goods as well as computers,
blamed its lower earnings on a continuing shift in its
business that has made the company more reliant on sales of
lower-margin goods such as personal computers and printers.
The company said that, in response, it was moving to reduce
operating costs.</p>
<p>For instance, in the second quarter the company said it
cut its world-wide work force of 93,000 by 1,000, mainly
through an early retirement program.</p>
<p>The situation facing Hewlett-Packard is similar to that
facing International Business Machines Corp., Digital
Equipment Corp. and other makers of minicomputers. As prices
for computers decline sharply and minicomputers are replaced
by smaller, far less expensive machines, these firms are
stuck with large, costly direct sales forces that aren't any
longer efficient.</p>
<p>While analysts said Hewlett-Packard is trying to cut
costs, they said the company isn't moving quickly enough.
They also don't expect any drastic moves any time soon.</p>
<p>"Progress is slow," said Peter Rogers, an analyst at
Robertson Stephens & Co. "This is another discouraging
quarter."</p>
<p>In a statement, John Young, Hewlett-Packard's chief
executive officer, expressed caution about the outlook for
the second half of the company's fiscal year. He called the
company's results so far this year "mixed" and said that
"slower economic growth continues to be a concern in many of
the countries we serve."</p>
<p>"My concern is there's a good chance you'll have a sharp
slowdown in {the company's} revenues growth in the second
half of year," said Mr. Milunovich. However, he said he
wouldn't cut his 1990 earnings estimate of $3.40 a share.</p>
