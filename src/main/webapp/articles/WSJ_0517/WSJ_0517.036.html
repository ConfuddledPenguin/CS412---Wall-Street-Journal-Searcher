	<p class="article-leader">At least one former partner of Harvey Myerson has been
granted immunity and dozens of other former colleagues have
been called to testify in the government's investigation of
alleged overbilling by Mr. Myerson and his law firm,
according to people familiar with the investigation.
   A federal grand jury in Brooklyn, N.Y., may be asked by
early summer to vote on whether to indict the founder of the
now-defunct New York law firm Myerson & Kuhn, the people
said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>These individuals say that prosecutors are likely to seek
to charge Mr. Myerson with conspiring to defraud at least two
clients by overbilling them and with illegally taking more
than $1 million from his own law firm.</p>
<p>"There is an investigation and it's being actively
pursued," said Sean O'Shea, an assistant U.S. attorney who is
leading the investigation of Mr. Myerson. "Beyond that,
there's no comment."</p>
<p>Charles Stillman, a New York attorney representing Mr.
Myerson, said, "When people finally sort through all of the
facts and circumstances, it will be clear that Harvey Myerson
did not violate the criminal law." Mr. Stillman added, "It is
by no means certain that he will be indicted."</p>
<p>Myerson & Kuhn filed for protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code in December. The
New York-based firm was founded in January 1988 by Mr.
Myerson and Bowie Kuhn, the former baseball commissioner. Mr.
Myerson and some of the other partners in the firm were
formerly partners of Finley, Kumble, Wagner, Heine,
Underberg, Manley, Myerson & Casey, which collapsed in
November 1987 and is still in bankruptcy-law proceedings.</p>
<p>According to individuals who have talked to the government
about Mr. Myerson, the government appears to be focusing on
alleged overbilling by Myerson & Kuhn of the United Food and
Commercial Workers union and of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.,
a unit of American Express Co. Both were clients of the firm.
If indicted, Mr. Myerson is likely to be charged with
directing underlings to overbill these clients, people
familiar with the investigation said.</p>
<p>The government is said to believe that Myerson & Kuhn
overbilled United Food by $550,000. Last month, shortly after
it learned of the alleged overbilling from the government,
the union filed a claim with the bankruptcy court in
Manhattan to try to recover the money. Robert Funk, associate
general counsel of United Food, declined to comment.</p>
<p>The government is also said to believe that Myerson & Kuhn
fraudulently overbilled Shearson by at least $2 million. As
previously reported, Shearson last year fired Myerson & Kuhn
and accused it of overbilling the securities firm. In June
1989, Myerson & Kuhn settled a dispute with Shearson,
agreeing to pay it $1.2 million. But Shearson claims it is
still owed $488,000 on the settlement and has also filed a
claim with the court.</p>
<p>The government has also been investigating the possible
withdrawal by Mr. Myerson of more than $1 million from
Myerson & Kuhn. Besides the more than $400,000 Mr. Myerson
withdrew from the law firm in the form of what were termed
"advances," the government is said to have information that
more than $600,000 in additional funds may have been
withdrawn but never accounted for. The missing funds were
discovered in a recent audit of the firm, individuals
familiar with the investigation said.</p>
<p>Former Myerson & Kuhn accountants and bookkeepers have
also been asked to testify in connection with the probe of
possible tax-law violations as a result of the withdrawals.
Mr. Myerson's annual compensation at the firm had been set at
$1.4 million.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Myerson, who has formed a new law firm, is
moving his residence to Florida from New York, associates
said. Under Florida law, an individual's home can't be seized
by creditors.</p>
