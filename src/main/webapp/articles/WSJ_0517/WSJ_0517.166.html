	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- "Hungry Alien Gobbles Tab Trio]"
   That headline might be a fittingly sensationalized banner
in one of the newest properties of British media mogul Robert
Maxwell, who announced plans to acquire three of the
largest-selling tabloid papers in the freaks-and-geeks field
-- the Globe, the National Examiner and the Sun -- from Globe
International Publishing Inc. of Montreal. Publishing
executives involved in the transaction say the price topped
$100 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The acquisition thrusts Mr. Maxwell and his closely held
Mirror Group Newspapers Inc. into an escalating war of
supermarket tabloids. He plans to acquire the three weakest
competitors in the field, aiming to spruce them up and go
head to head with the granddaddy of sensation, the National
Enquirer, and its sisters, the Star and Weekly World News,
all owned by Macfadden Holdings Inc. of New York.</p>
<p>The Globe acquisition gives Mr. Maxwell, the rotund and
hyper-competitive chairman of Maxwell Communication Corp., a
spot on U.S. magazine racks, a market he has fought to enter
before. In April 1989 he lost out to Macfadden in the bidding
for the National Enquirer, the tabloid leader, and the Weekly
World News, which went for $412.5 million combined.</p>
<p>But not all supermarket tabloids are the same. What Mr.
Maxwell has scooped up are the racier, raunchier and riskier
of the tabs. "Jesus Is Already Back On Earth" screams a
National Examiner headline this week. "Boy, 5, Gives Birth"
informs this week's Sun, whose cover also features a large
photo of a badly deformed baby.</p>
<p>Times have been tough for the tabloid field recently, but
the Globe papers have lost circulation at a far higher rate
than their three stronger rivals. The National Examiner
circulation dipped 20.2% in the second half of 1989; the
Globe lost 12.9% in the same time; the Sun's figures weren't
audited for that period. Meanwhile, Macfadden's Enquirer lost
4.3% in the same period while the Star lost 2.6%.</p>
<p>Maxwell executives readily agree the sassy publications
need some help.</p>
<p>The Globe tabloids "aren't the fat cats in the industry,"
concedes Ernest Burrington, deputy chairman and managing
director of Mirror Group. "We realize these newspapers need
to be strengthened." For now, Mr. Burrington plans no major
staff changes at the tabloids, all three of which are based
in Boca Raton, Fla., just down the road from the National
Enquirer, in Lantana.</p>
<p>But the quality of the publications, which are profitable,
may matter less than the national distribution system they
use -- the true object of Mr. Maxwell's desire, in the view
of some industry experts.</p>
<p>Mr. Maxwell bought not only the tabloids but also Globe
Marketing Services, with a 500-person field force that
distributes magazines and newspapers in supermarkets and
convenience stores nationwide and negotiates for premium
display space. Mr. Maxwell could use the operation to
distribute other companies' publications for a fee and, more
likely, to distribute publications he wants to start up or
acquire.</p>
<p>"The field force is a great asset because competition for
space at checkouts is so fierce," says Robert A. Cohen, head
of Robert Cohen Associates, a New York publishing consulting
firm. "I don't know if anyone really wants these magazines
for what they are. What he's done is like buying landing
slots at an airport."</p>
<p>Mr. Maxwell also seems eager to expand elsewhere.
Yesterday he announced his intention to acquire a stake in
Berliner Verlag, an East German publishing company whose
properties include the 420,000-circulation Berliner Zeitung
and the 1.5-million-circulation magazine FF.</p>
<p>Mr. Maxwell already owns several daily U.K. tabloids that
are somewhat less raunchy than rival Rupert Murdoch's
tabloid, the Sun, which regularly runs pictures of
bare-breasted models on Page Three. In photographs in Mr.
Maxwell's Daily Mirror, the women are less scantily clad.</p>
<p>In the U.S., Mr. Maxwell's tabloid archrival, the National
Enquirer, is itching for a fight.</p>
<p>It could be an expensive fight for both publishers. Iain
Calder, editor of the National Enquirer, said he looks
forward to competing with the Maxwell-owned tabloids. But the
Scottish-born editor boasts the largest editorial budget --
$16 million annually -- and thus can outbid other tabloids
for "exclusive" stories. The Enquirer had offered $1 million
to Marla Maples, alleged girlfriend of billionaire Donald
Trump, but she turned it down. (Paying for stories is frowned
on at most major newspapers.)</p>
<p>Globe executives said their tabloids operate with
editorial budgets "significantly less" than that of the
Enquirer. The Canadian publisher decided to sell the tabloids
only within the last week, after choosing to focus on its
consumer magazines, such as Bridal Guide. The company is
owned by Michael Rosenbloom, who is 62 years old and has run
the company for 20 years.</p>
<p>Peter Rubenovitch, chief financial officer of Globe
International, says now is the time to sell the tabloids
because "the prices in the market have been so buoyant." In
March, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. agreed to sell another
scandal sheet -- the Star -- to Macfadden Holdings for $400
million in cash and stock.</p>
<p>Industry experts say the falling circulation of
supermarket tabloids is due largely to overcrowded checkout
shelves as well as the competition for mass audiences from
the growing number of gossip sheets and magazines such as
Time Warner Inc.'s People.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean Globe executives won't miss the tabloid
business, despite its troubles. "I am personally going to
miss it a lot," says Mr. Heine. "It's the most exciting part
of the publishing business."</p>
