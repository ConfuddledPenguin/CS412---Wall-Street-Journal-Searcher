	<p class="article-leader">Veba AG, a West German energy and chemical concern, said
in an interim report that first-quarter profit climbed 5.3%
to 237 million marks ($144.2 million) from 225 million marks
a year earlier.
   Sales climbed 10% to 13.15 billion marks from 11.93
billion marks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Pretax profit climbed 6.3% to 605 million marks from 569
million marks.</p>
<p>The company said higher volume and prices in its mineral
oil division led to a "considerable" increase in that area.
Oil sales climbed 9.2% to 2.53 billion marks from 2.32
billion marks a year earlier; chemical sales jumped 16% to
2.62 million marks from 2.27 million marks; and electricity
sales increased 4.5% to 2.89 billion marks from 2.76 billion
marks.</p>
<p>Veba said earnings in its electricity, trading,
transportation and services divisions rose slightly from a
year earlier, but weren't able to equal "the high
year-earlier level" in its oil and chemical division. It
didn't break down first-quarter earnings by division.</p>
