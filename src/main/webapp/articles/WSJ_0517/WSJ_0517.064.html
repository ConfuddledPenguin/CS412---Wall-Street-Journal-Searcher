	<p class="article-leader">The stock market rally that carried the Dow Jones
Industrial Average to two consecutive records stalled amid
uncertainty about how much farther interest rates can fall.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.77 points to
2819.68 in active trading. The rally swept the Dow 84 points
higher since last Thursday, but gains tailed off to less than
a point Tuesday. The rally was triggered by perceptions
inflation was waning and interest rates were headed lower.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Long-term bond prices were modestly lower for the second
day in a row. The dollar ended mixed.</p>
<p>Analysts said that despite the Dow Jones average's record
highs, investors remain wary about how much further stock
prices can climb without either substantial reductions in
interest rates or big gains in corporate earnings, neither of
which appears likely in the short term.</p>
<p>"The stock market, no matter what happens, is not going to
go an awful lot further until we get through the first half
of the year and start to see better numbers on the earnings
front," said Harold MacKinney, head of the investment policy
committee at Fleet National Bank in Providence, R.I.</p>
<p>Yet some traders contend that prices won't retreat very
far simply because money managers who didn't quickly jump
into the big rally Friday will view any price declines as
buying opportunities.</p>
<p>The bond market's lack of any further gains after last
week's big rally is a major restraint on stock investors.
While the yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond
plunged to less than 8.7% from more than 9% in just two
weeks, the interest-rate decline stopped this week. Even good
news on inflation failed to get any rise out of bond prices
yesterday. The government reported that the consumer price
index rose 0.2% in April. Bond traders said the lack of
response to the data wasn't surprising given the substantial
price gains last Friday.</p>
<p>In major market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices slipped in active trading. Volume on the New
York Stock Exchange totaled 160 million shares. Declining
issues on the Big Board were ahead of gainers 814 to 701.</p>
<p>Bond prices fell. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond
lost about an eighth of a point, or about $1.25 for each
$1,000 of face amount, for a yield of 8.63%.</p>
<p>The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading the
currency was quoted at 1.6455 marks and 151.67 yen compared
with 1.6465 marks and 150.80 yen Tuesday.</p>
