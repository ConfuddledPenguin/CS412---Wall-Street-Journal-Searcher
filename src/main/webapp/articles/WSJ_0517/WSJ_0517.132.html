	<h3>Heard on the Street: Stripped-Down Beneficial Profits by Lending To the Little Guy and Shunning the Big Deals</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Looking for a financial services stock
untainted by commercial real estate loans, leveraged buy-out
loans, foreign loans or junk bonds? Beneficial may be a good
way to bet on the old-fashioned middle American borrower.
   After shedding unrelated businesses such as the Spiegel
mail-order catalog, Western Auto Supply and a loss-plagued
reinsurance unit, Beneficial is focused on consumer lending.
About 63% of its loans are second mortgages; most of the rest
of its assets are unsecured personal loans.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Those loans have helped Beneficial generate consistently
increasing earnings. Several analysts expect earnings to
increase about 12% this year and next; the company is widely
expected to boost its dividend 9% to a $2.40 annual rate at
its board meeting next Wednesday. Yet Beneficial shares, at
52 3/4, are selling for about 10 times trailing earnings,
while the overall market multiple is 16 times.</p>
<p>Noting Beneficial's 13 consecutive quarters of increasing
earnings, analyst Sy Jacobs of Mabon Nugent says, "In an
environment where the Standard & Poor's 500 earnings have
become unpredictable and disappointing, that kind of record
deserves something close to a market multiple."</p>
<p>Others argue that Beneficial offers a chance to invest in
consumer lending unburdened by other businesses. Of
Beneficial's main competitors, Commercial Credit is owned by
Primerica, which has big securities and life insurance units;
and Household International has more than $2 billion of such
unpopular assets as LBO loans, commercial real estate loans
and junk bonds.</p>
<p>"My theory is that Beneficial is really the only pure play
left in the consumer finance business," says Lacy M.
Shockley, a regional bank analyst with Smith Barney, a
Primerica unit.</p>
<p>The major risk for Beneficial is one that the stock market
views as unlikely: A recession or depression in which
unemployment soars and middle-income borrowers stop paying
their debts.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, Beneficial has increased the share
of its lending that is secured by homes, but it has remained
conservative in the amounts it will lend. Beneficial won't
allow total debt on a borrower's house to exceed 75% of its
appraised value. The amount of Beneficial's average
second-mortgage loan is $25,000; its average unsecured loan
is $2,200.</p>
<p>Most Beneficial customers could get lower rates or bigger
loan amounts from banks or thrifts, but the company has
thrived by developing a network of offices staffed by
aggressive, service-oriented salespeople.</p>
<p>One new program that is providing significant earnings
growth is tax-refund lending, offered through H&R Block. For
a flat fee of $35, Beneficial will send a taxpayer a check
for his expected refund within a day or two after H&R Block
makes an electronic tax return filing for the customer. Last
year, Beneficial made about 550,000 of the so-called "refund
anticipation loans"; this year, the number doubled to 1.1
million. Gregory Whyte, a Shearson Lehman Hutton analyst,
expects the program to contribute 65 to 70 cents a share to
earnings, up from 30 to 35 cents a share last year.</p>
<p>Andrew C. Halvorsen, Beneficial's chief financial officer,
won't predict a dividend increase but says the issue "will be
a topic of discussion at the May 23 board meeting. We realize
that dividends are important to our shareholders." He also
assures investors with long memories that Beneficial doesn't
have any remaining liability for its former American
Centennial reinsurance unit. The unit, which ate up $460
million of Beneficial's capital in 1986, was sold for $10
million in cash and $98 million in notes, and its new owners
have paid Beneficial $15 million in principal and interest so
far. Mr. Halvorsen said American Centennial soon will begin
making modest payments on a $60 million note that matures in
1997 and that Beneficial carries on its books at zero.</p>
<p>One drag on earnings is the Harbour Island real estate
development near Tampa, Fla., that will produce pretax losses
of about $21 million this year, which Mr. Halvorsen hopes to
reduce. A potential real estate gain literally surrounds
Beneficial's headquarters in Peapack, N.J., where the company
hopes to sell 600 acres of a 700-acre tract, now on the books
at only $11 million.</p>
<p>Ms. Shockley of Smith Barney believes that within five
years, Beneficial will be acquired by a diversified financial
services company or a big regional bank. "I would not be
surprised to see a price somewhere near $100 a share," she
says.</p>
<p>But beware. Beneficial's management put the company up for
sale in 1986, and some analysts estimated it could fetch a
price of $85 a share. But the best bid was only $75 a share,
which Beneficial rejected, and the stock since then hasn't
approached its takeover-induced high of 78 5/8.</p>
