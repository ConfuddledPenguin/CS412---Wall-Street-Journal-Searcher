	<p class="article-leader">THE U.S. INDICATED that Soviet moves in the Baltics could
jeopardize trade ties.
   As Secretary of State Baker opened talks in Moscow aimed
at resolving superpower arms-control disputes, U.S. officials
said the Bush administration may be unwilling to sign a new
treaty liberalizing U.S.-Soviet trade relations at this
month's Bush-Gorbachev summit because of Kremlin tactics
against independence bids by the Baltic republics. At the
White House, Bush said the situation in Lithuania, Estonia
and Latvia has "put some tension on" the planned Washington
summit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Lithuania's legislature offered to suspend laws enacted
since the republic's March 11 declaration of independence if
Moscow agrees to talks on secession.</p>

<p>South Africa's government declared public hospitals open
to all races, reversing its decades-old policy of segregated
health services. The move, effective immediately, reportedly
affects more than 240 hospitals, and is the latest in a
series of steps taken by the eight-month-old government of
President de Klerk to ease the apartheid system.</p>

<p>East and West Germany are expected to sign a treaty
tomorrow in Bonn on monetary and economic union. The West
German government, meanwhile, announced twin programs to
subsidize East Germany's industrial restructuring, including
a two-year system of bonuses for foreign commercial
investment.</p>

<p>Nicaragua's government reached tentative agreement with
Sandinista labor leaders to end some strikes by government
workers. The walkouts have disrupted public services in
Managua. The accord was reached after President Chamorro
agreed to restart negotiations. The union's wage demand,
however, remained unresolved.</p>
<p>Bush said the Nicaraguan government is "absolutely
bankrupt," and demanded that Congress act on pending
legislation providing $300 million in aid to Managua. The
president, speaking at the White House, also said the U.S.
can't meet Chamorro's request for a $40 million emergency
loan.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The Senate voted to provide $2.9 billion in emergency
funds over five years to help cities and states shoulder the
cost of health care for growing numbers of patients with
AIDS. The measure also provides for 150 FDA inspectors to
monitor the nation's blood supply. The House is expected to
pass a similar bill soon.</p>

<p>Negotiators in Manila appeared to hit an obstacle in talks
over the future of six U.S. military bases in the
Philippines, with the Aquino government demanding $222
million in back payments from Washington. At the White House,
Bush said he was studying alternative locations for the
installations.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>El Salvador opened peace talks with the country's leftist
guerrillas, the first direct negotiations in six months. The
U.N.-mediated discussions in Venezuela are aimed at ending a
10-year-old war that has left more than 70,000 people dead.
An earlier round of talks ended in November after the bombing
of a leftist union hall that killed 10 people.</p>

<p>U.S. housing officials offered a $16 million bailout loan
to the well-connected developers of a troubled Chicago
apartment complex that already had received a series of
unusual government favors. HUD chief Kemp made the offer in
an attempt to avert what would be the biggest HUD foreclosure
on a housing project.</p>

<p>A congressional study concluded that despite growing
concern about possible links between exposure to chemicals
and degenerative nerve diseases such as Parkinson's, the U.S.
fails to adequately monitor the neurological risks of
chemicals used in farms and factories.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>A top Iranian official met in Dublin with EC officials and
demanded the release of Moslems held in Israel and Lebanon.
He indicated that two Americans recently freed would be the
last until there is a reciprocal gesture. The meeting was
called by Tehran, which has been seeking Western Europe's
help in rebuilding its economy.</p>

<p>Voters in the Dominican Republic cast ballots in a
presidential race between President Balaguer and former
President Bosch, both octogenarians. The contest was viewed
as close. Voting was being monitored by 30 international
observers, including ex-President Carter. Results are
expected today.</p>

<p>The republic of Slovenia established Yugoslavia's first
regional non-Communist government in almost 50 years. The
premierelect, speaking in Ljubljana, announced plans to
abolish the northern state's secret police, and said Slovenia
would strive to form an army and seek greater autonomy.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Paramilitary police in Ivory Coast seized control of
Abidjan's airport from military recruits who occupied the

West African nation.</p>
