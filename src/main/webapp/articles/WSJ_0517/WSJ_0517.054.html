	<h3>Speaking of Business: It's Not How Much You Pay CEOs -- but How</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">The cover of Business Week earlier this month showed Craig
R. McCaw, founder of McCaw Cellular Communications, the
nation's largest cellular phone company. Last year, according
to the magazine, his total compensation of $53.9 million made
him No. 1 among chief executives. That's a nice bundle,
especially for the CEO of a company that has yet to earn a
dime.
   Some McCaw investors, Business Week says, are beginning to
wonder whether Mr. McCaw isn't overdoing it. But Michael
Jensen and Kevin Murphy argue that we should look not at the
total amount of executive pay but at the way it is paid. Mr.
Jensen, who teaches at Harvard Business School, and Mr.
Murphy, who is at the William E. Simon Graduate Business
School at the University of Rochester, offer their views in a
Harvard working paper.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As it happens, Mr. McCaw last year was paid $289,000 in
salary and bonuses. The rest of his income came from exercise
of stock options. If he holds on to a great deal of that
stock, he is moving in a direction that Mr. Jensen and Mr.
Murphy will like: His future earnings will depend heavily on
just how well McCaw does.</p>
<p>The two professors suggest three steps to make corporate
CEOs more accountable: Boards can require that CEOs hold
substantial amounts of company stock. Salaries, bonuses and
stock options can be structured so as to provide big rewards
for superior performance and big penalties for poor
performance. The threat of dismissal for poor performance can
be made real.</p>
<p>"In most publicly held companies," the authors write, "the
compensation of top executives is virtually independent of
performance. On average, corporate America pays its most
important leaders like bureaucrats. Is it any wonder then
that so many CEOs act like bureaucrats rather than the value
-- maximizing entrepreneurs companies need to enhance their
standing in world markets?"</p>
<p>U.S. CEOs earn several times as much as their counterparts
in Japan and Germany. American chief executives, however,
still haven't caught up with U.S. corporate leaders of a
half-century ago.</p>
<p>According to the study, the average salary and bonus for
CEOs of leading companies on the New York Stock Exchange
during the period 1934 through 1938 was $882,000, in 1988
dollars. This compares with $843,000 for 1982-88.</p>
<p>The study also showed that, with respect to pay for
performance, CEO compensation "is getting worse. . . . The
most powerful link between shareholder wealth and executive
wealth is direct stock ownership by the CEO. Yet CEO stock
ownership for large public companies, measured as a
percentage of total shares outstanding, was 10 times greater
in the 1930s than in the 1980s. Even over the last 15 years,
CEO holdings as a percentage of corporate value have
declined."</p>
<p>All the public complaints about the levels of executive
compensation do a lot of harm, the authors contend. Corporate
directors, leery of likely publicity, shy from writing
employment contracts that would reward CEOs handsomely for
superior performance, even though such contracts would
penalize the executives for poor performance.</p>
<p>One reason directors may not force perform-or-be-punished
contracts on CEOs is that chief executives often are very
close to the directors. Boards' compensation committees
usually are composed of outside directors, but the outsiders
usually have been chosen with at least the advice and counsel
of the CEOs.</p>
<p>Messrs. Jensen and Murphy would like companies not only to
punish CEOs with pay cuts, if they deserve them, but to boot
them out now and then. The authors are annoyed by the fact
that chief executives seem to become corporate fixtures,
whether they're doing a good job or not. "On average," they
write, "CEOs in our base sample (2,505 CEOs) hold their jobs
for more than 10 years before stepping down, and most give up
their title (but not their seat on the board) only upon
reaching normal retirement age." The authors cite two other
studies, spanning 20 years and more than 500 management
changes, that showed only 20 cases where CEOs left their jobs
because of poor performance.</p>
<p>While tying the executives' compensation to the fate of
the company stock has advantages, it also has weaknesses. The
stock market often moves in mysterious ways, not always
governed by the company's current financial results. That's
why the Jensen-Murphy study would like to see companies make
innovative use of cash compensation, something that few of
them now do. In fairness, such plans should be based on the
company's results in relation to similarly situated firms.</p>
<p>Someone may object that CEOs are motivated by
considerations other than money: the beautiful offices,
limousines, airplanes and other perquisites that often go to
chief executives. These things go with the job and to some
extent always will. But they have a major disadvantage as
incentives to performance. If a CEO leads a company to a bad
year, it's not likely the board will move him out of his
office and into a broom closet. Cash is easily paid and
fairly easily taken away.</p>
<p>If the compensation system were reformed as Messrs. Jensen
and Murphy suggest, they reckon that the average CEO would
probably make more money. But a number of current chief
executives would lose their jobs and the high pay would
attract talented men and women to take their places.</p>
<p>The individual companies and the economy would be better
served.</p>
