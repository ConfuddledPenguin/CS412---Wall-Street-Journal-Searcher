	<p class="article-leader">Tomorrow may be Canada's last chance to save itself from
breaking into pieces. A committee of the House of Commons is
scheduled to unveil a last-ditch plan to save the Meech Lake
accord. The accord -- a package of decentralizing
constitutional reforms designed to satisfy once and for all
Quebec's recurrent demands for more autonomy -- was
negotiated three years ago, and requires ratification by all
10 provinces. Three provinces still hold out: Manitoba, New
Brunswick and Newfoundland. If the parliamentary committee
fails to come up with enough concessions to please them -- or
if it comes up with so many that it offends Quebec -- the
Meech Lake accord will founder.
   In that case, it is quite possible that Quebec will choose
to secede. A May 14 poll found that 56% of Quebeckers now
favor sovereignty -- the highest proportion ever. Quebec's
federalist premier, Robert Bourassa, has been hinting that
his loyalty cannot be counted on if Meech fails.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But even if Meech does become law, Canada's prospects
don't look much brighter. The English provinces have become
more and more exasperated with Quebec. Federal Environment
Minister Lucien Bouchard, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's
most trusted Quebec adviser, said last month that if
Newfoundland would not give way on Meech, "Canada would have
to make a choice about what Canada will be -- a Canada
without Quebec or a Canada without Newfoundland."</p>
<p>From every beer hall, phone-in show and
letter-to-the-editor page in English Canada came the reply --
in that case, we choose Newfoundland. A majority of English
Canadians, according to a December poll, would cheerfully
permit Quebec to leave if it asks. Twenty-five percent want
to throw it out even if it doesn't ask.</p>
<p>Canada is not just divided along French-English lines.
British Columbia's finance minister, Mel Couvelier,
complained in a television interview two weeks ago: "It's my
opinion that on a straight dollars-and-cents basis, it
doesn't make sense for B.C. to be in Confederation." An
insurgent populist party, the Reform Party, which wants to
reduce the influence of both Quebec and Ontario in Canadian
politics has popped into first place in the opinion polls in
Alberta. It was, though, Nova Scotia Premier John Buchanan
who expressed the great unutterable thought of Canadian
politics last month: If Quebec were to secede, the four
Atlantic provinces would have "no choice" but to seek
admission to the U.S.</p>
<p>If worse comes to worst, then, Canada could be fractured
not into two pieces but into four or even more: Quebec,
Ontario, some grouping of Atlantic provinces, some grouping
or groupings of Western provinces -- with some of those
pieces possibly pleading for admission to the U.S. But before
anybody gets too excited about redrawing the U.S. border
northward, take a look at what America would be getting.</p>
<p>According to a December poll, 27% of Newfoundlanders and
21% of New Brunswickers would accept an invitation to join
the U.S. The figure for the rest of English Canada was just
13%. But Atlantic Canada was also the region most virulently
opposed to the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement. What the
four Atlantic provinces are seeking is not economic
opportunity, but a bigger, richer sugar daddy.</p>
<p>More than any other Canadians, people down east believe it
is the responsibility of government to look after them. At
fabulous cost, governments -- particularly the federal
government -- have tried. The region is littered with the
carcasses of white elephants, most notoriously two
now-abandoned heavy water plants on Nova Scotia's Cape Breton
Island. Nearly 37% of the budget of the government of Nova
Scotia is funded by federal transfers. Federal spending in
Prince Edward Island is equal to half the gross provincial
product.</p>
<p>Despite all this federal assistance, tax rates are higher
in Atlantic Canada than anywhere else in the country. Debt
service consumes an average of 14.6% of the revenues of the
four provinces, again more than anywhere else in Canada,
except Quebec. Not surprisingly, federal assistance has not
succeeded in alleviating the region's poverty. Incomes per
capita are only two-thirds those in the rest of the country
(in Newfoundland 56%), and unemployment rates the highest: 9%
in Nova Scotia, 12% in New Brunswick, 14% in PEI and nearly
15% in Newfoundland. The dole is a way of life. By current
law, 10 weeks of work qualifies the recipient for 42 weeks of
unemployment insurance. Kind employers rotate one job among
five people.</p>
<p>One-quarter of all Quebeckers say they would join the U.S.
if invited, but the province would make a very odd state.
Despite the pro-business talk that issues from the lips of
separatists and federalists alike, Quebec remains the most
statist place in North America. Fully 5% of Quebec's GDP is
accounted for by one giant state-owned company, Hydro Quebec.
The most powerful financial institution in the province,
Caisse Populaire, is also state-owned. The province's
technology industries, especially aerospace, depend on
government, usually federal, funding.</p>
<p>The private sector is heavily involved with dying
industries such as clothing, textiles, shoes and furniture.
It is hobbled by some of Canada's most destructive trade
unions and burdened by government spending. As a result,
while Quebec's GDP equaled 62.2% of Ontario's in 1979, a
decade later it had sunk to 58%. Quebec unemployment rates
are nearly double Ontario's and labor force participation is
five percentage points lower.</p>
<p>Nor is the province's statism purely economic. The Quebec
government regulates the language of corporate memos in any
company that employs more than 100 people. Commercial signs
must be in French only. If the Montreal French-language
school board has its way, after June 30 schools in the
province will discipline or expel any student caught speaking
any language other than French on school property, including
playgrounds. Quebeckers may flirt with joining the U.S., but
once they got a glimpse of the Bill of Rights, they'd change
their minds.</p>
<p>Canada really has two Wests, and, if the country
dissolves, each might go its separate way. Saskatchewan and
Manitoba are economically depressed farming provinces that
vote socialist. British Columbia and Alberta are
resource-producing provinces (timber in British Columbia, oil
in Alberta) with free enterprise traditions.</p>
<p>The two far western provinces believe they could do pretty
well on their own or as American states. The U.S. government
apparently agrees. State Department documents produced during
the last bout of Quebec separatism and obtained by Quebec
journalist Jean-Francois Lisee under the U.S. Freedom of
Information Act identified British Columbia as the only
province that should be considered for statehood if Canada
broke up.</p>
<p>All four western provinces share a list of grievances
against Ottawa: high interest rates set by the Bank of Canada
to dampen inflation in Ontario, the 9% goods and services tax
that comes into effect on Jan. 1 and an angry sense that
Quebec gets too much federal patronage and pork barrel while
they get too little. A former Manitoba attorney general has
explained his province's hostility to Meech Lake as
retaliation for Ottawa's decision four years ago to award a
military maintenance contract to Montreal instead of
Winnipeg.</p>
<p>The West's angry belief that it pays more than it gets has
often been true in the past. But with commodity prices low
and falling, it is likely to be much less true in the future.
The Globe & Mail reported Monday that a new federal report
found that from 1984 to 1988, Ottawa spent more in British
Columbia than it raked in -- $2.3 billion more in the peak
year, 1985. On their own, British Columbia and Alberta would
be boom and bust economies; Saskatchewan and Manitoba, bust
and bust.</p>
<p>The province that cares most about holding Canada together
is the one that would profit most if it fell apart. Ontario
is the only province where Canadian nationalism counts for
much -- 90% of its people think of themselves as Canadians
first and citizens of their province second. Only 74% of
Albertans, 63% of Nova Scotians and 44% of Quebeckers think
of themselves that way. Good thing, since Ontario, with about
one-third of the country's population, is the province paying
the bills.</p>
<p>A few Ontarians have begun to wonder aloud whether the
province might not do better, now that it has access to the
U.S. market through the Free Trade Agreement, if it stopped
subsidizing the have-not provinces. They note that the
world's richest countries -- Sweden, Switzerland, Austria --
tend to be compact and homogenous places, not sprawling
federal states that need to bribe antagonistic regions into
consensus. Others say that if Canada does split up, Ontario's
interests lie in union with Quebec, not with the other
English-speaking provinces.</p>
<p>Most Ontarians continue to be willing to pay the price of
empire. But how long will they be able to afford it? The
Liberal government of Premier David Peterson has proven
itself among the most profligate in the developed world:
Spending on social programs has grown, from an already high
base, by 9.5% a year since 1984.</p>
<p>Nor is the underlying economy troublefree: Ontario's
biggest industry is making cars for GM, Ford and Chrysler. In
the coming decade, that could be nearly as precarious a
living as growing wheat. Still, over the long haul, Ontario's
location, educated population and ethnic harmony should
enable it to retain its place among the richest jurisdictions
in North America.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Ever since Quebec nationalism emerged in the late 1950s,
the U.S. has unambiguously supported Canadian unity. If
Canada should disintegrate, though, what ought the U.S. to
do? Extending statehood to Canada's eastern and near-western
provinces would only bring three or four more hungry
Democratic senators, accustomed to the chunkier Canadian
style of pork barrel, to Washington.</p>
<p>The American interest in Canada remains what it has always
been: stability and openness to trade and investment. That
means economic integration, but not political annexation. A
North American common market -- composed of as many
sovereignties as the people of North America want -- would
contribute to the welfare of all; sending the checks to
Canada's regions from Washington rather than Ottawa would
benefit nobody.</p>
