	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration's budget-deficit
projections have grown so large that concern exists in the
White House and Congress that meeting deficit targets may do
more harm than good to the economy.
   New administration forecasts show that to avoid
across-the-board spending cuts this fall, the government may
need to find as much as $64 billion in spending cuts and tax
increases -- even if the added borrowing needed to clean up
the thrift industry is excluded. If all the thrift costs are
included, as the law currently requires, they would need as
much as $114 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At his first news conference since the start of budget
talks with Congress, President Bush said that paring the
deficit by more than 1% of the gross national product --
about $55 billion -- would "risk . . . slowing down the
economy further."</p>
<p>Mr. Bush said that he won't give details of his position
on budget issues until an agreement has been reached and that
he was concerned about "frightening" the financial markets by
exaggerating the extent of the budget problem.</p>
<p>The president dismissed calls by some Democrats that he
give a televised address or otherwise lead a broad public
discussion of the budget deficit, presumably to prepare the
public for the possibility of tax increases or other
measures.</p>
<p>Another alternative mentioned with increasing frequency on
Capitol Hill would be to alter the targets under the
Gramm-Rudman law to require less deficit reduction this year.
Both administration and congressional negotiators already
seem prepared to alter the law so they don't have to count
the cost of the thrift bailout.</p>
<p>Cutting the deficit in one year by the amount that may be
required to meet the Gramm-Rudman target might be neither
politically possible nor economically wise, some congressmen
say. "You may not be able to save that much without harming
the economy in some way," House Budget Committee Chairman
Leon Panetta (D., Calif.) warned.</p>
<p>Both White House Budget Director Richard Darman and Robert
Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office, are
to discuss this issue with budget negotiators this afternoon.</p>
<p>A major economic rationale for trimming the federal
deficit is to curb the government's appetite for debt, thus
freeing up money for private investment and bringing down
interest rates. This, in turn, would help keep the economy
growing. But the newly expressed fear is that such a
beneficial effect might be offset by a sharp cutback in
government spending and an increase in taxes. The resulting
reduction in overall demand could slow the economy down.</p>
<p>"I don't think anyone can say for sure where that line can
be drawn," Mr. Reischauer said.</p>
<p>Some members of Congress say worrying about cutting too
much from the deficit is ridiculous. They say the greater
risk is that this year's deficit-reduction package, like
those in the past, will be swollen with accounting gimmicks
that have little economic impact.</p>
<p>In the past several years, Congress never agreed on more
than $25 billion in real, lasting reductions of the deficit,
according to the Congressional Budget Office.</p>
<p>At his news conference, Mr. Bush defended his reticence,
saying he doesn't want to "go out there and do something that
might inadvertently suggest crisis and frighten markets."</p>
<p>But Democrats continued to press him. "The American people
must hear from the president about the length and breadth of
this problem, and they must also see a proposal from him,"
said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D.,
Texas).</p>
<p>Mr. Bush said that while he feels an obligation to be
candid with lawmakers, he sees no need to involve the public
in the discussions. Nor, he said, will he put his own
proposals out first, as some members of Congress have
suggested.</p>
<p>"I want to go out when we have a bipartisan answer to the
problem, (and) say, `Here's what the problem is and here's
what the answer (is).' And if I go out there today, we don't
have a bipartisan answer, and that's the only way this
problem's going to be solved," Mr. Bush said.</p>
<p>Mr. Darman now figures the deficit for the year beginning
Oct. 1, without any policy changes, will total between $123
billion and $138 billion, congressional staffers said. Mr.
Darman says thrift borrowing could add as much as $50 billion
to that total. The range is slightly different than the one
reported by lawmakers immediately after the first budget
"summit" meeting Tuesday. Under the Gramm-Rudman law, the
deficit for the year can't exceed $74 billion.</p>
