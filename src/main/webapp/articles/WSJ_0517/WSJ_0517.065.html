	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A food-labeling law moved closer to reality
as a House panel brushed aside the objections of a dozen
food-trade groups to adopt consumer-protection legislation.
   Designed to dispel consumer confusion over nutrition and
health claims, the bill would require food manufacturers to
use a uniform nutrition label that lists the amount of
calories, fat, salt and other nutrients in thousands of
packaged foods. The measure also would require the nation's
supermarkets and groceries to post information or distribute
brochures regarding the nutrition content of fruits and
vegetables as well as fresh fish.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The bill, approved by the House Energy and Commerce
Committee, would empower the Food and Drug Administration to
regulate disease-prevention claims and health messages. It
also would authorize state agencies to enforce federal
labeling requirements.</p>
<p>The measure, co-sponsored by Rep. Henry Waxman (D.,
Calif.) and Rep. Edward Madigan (R., Ill.), would require
food manufacturers to relabel virtually all of their packaged
products within six months of enactment. Industry
representatives complained that it would take at least 18
months to relabel the 20,000 food products typically carried
by supermarkets.</p>
<p>In the Senate, a companion food-labeling bill cleared the
Labor and Human Resources Committee by a 10-5 vote last month
and now awaits floor action.</p>
<p>"The purpose of this legislation," said Mr. Waxman, "is to
make sense of the confusing array of nutrition labels that
confront all consumers every time they enter the
supermarket."</p>
<p>But spokesmen for the food industry argued that the bill
doesn't go far enough in pre-empting state food-labeling laws
and warned that it would only bewilder shoppers.</p>
<p>"We must have one set of national rules governing health
and disease information," asserted C. Manly Molpus, president
of the Grocery Manufacturers of America. "This bill fails
this critical test."</p>
<p>Many in the industry fear a proliferation of state laws
patterned after California's Proposition 65. Passed in
November 1986, Proposition 65 requires manufacturers to put
health warnings on any food containing an ingredient believed
to pose a risk of cancer or birth defects.</p>
<p>At the industry's behest, Mr. Madigan, the ranking
Republican on the Commerce Committee, proposed pre-empting
Proposition 65-type regulations. But Committee Chairman John
Dingell (D., Mich.) rejected the amendment, saying it wasn't
germane to the legislation since Proposition 65 applies to
carcinogens, not nutrients.</p>
<p>The bill, among other things, would require that nutrition
claims such as "low" and "light" be consistent with
food-content definitions set by the FDA. "On some products,
`light' means low in fat; on others, such as some brands of
olive oil, it refers to the color of the product," said Mr.
Waxman. "The bill would correct this deceptive and misleading
state of affairs by requiring that {such} terms have a single
meaning."</p>
<p>As for disease-prevention claims, such as bran prevents
cancer, none could be made until the FDA has reviewed the
scientific evidence and ruled on the validity of the claim.
Once a specific claim has been approved, any company could
make the claim so long as it was consistent with the FDA's
findings.</p>
<p>But some food processors complain that the provisions on
disease claims are too narrowly drawn. "The bill is so
restrictive on what you can say that it is tantamount to a
no-health-message policy on foods," said Jeffrey Nedelman,
spokesman for the Grocery Manufacturers of America.</p>
<p>In a letter to Rep. Dingell this week, a phalanx of
food-trade groups, including the American Meat Institute,
National Grocers Association, Snack Food Association and
American Bakers Association, voiced "significant concerns"
about the legislation. They contended -- without mentioning
Proposition 65 -- that the bill would allow states to impose
different health-labeling laws and that these laws would
disrupt the nation's food-distribution system and jeopardize
food exports.</p>
<p>Consumer advocates counter that both the House bill and
the Senate bill, drafted by Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D.,
Ohio), would provide uniformity in food labeling and
sufficiently empower the federal government to pre-empt state
laws.</p>
<p>Lobbying efforts by some trade groups to broaden the
bill's pre-emption provision to cover Proposition 65 are
"simply an attempt to turn a piece of consumer-health
legislation into a Trojan horse that would void consumer and
environmental-protection measures across the country,"
asserted Bruce Silverglade, spokesman for Center for Science
in the Public Interest, a Washington-based consumer group.</p>
<p>Both bills would require disclosure of serving size, the
number of servings per container, the number of calories per
serving and the number of calories derived from total fat and
saturated fat in a serving. Both also would require
manufacturers to list the total amount of fat, saturated fat,
unsaturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, sugar, fiber, protein
and carbohydrates on the label.</p>
<p>The bills would exempt, among other things, restaurant
food and prepared foods sold in delicatessens. They wouldn't
cover meat and poultry products, which are regulated by the
Agriculture Department.</p>
<p>he House Commerce Committee, in a 24-19 vote, rejected an
amendment pushed by the Food Marketing Institute to exempt
fruits, vegetables and fresh fish from labeling requirements.
Under the Waxman-Madigan bill, supermarkets would have to
post nutrition information or distribute brochures regarding
only the 20 top-selling items in each category.</p>
<p>Rules to carry out the legislation would be written by the
FDA, which already is working on a comprehensive
nutrition-labeling package. The agency also is sounding out
the public on proposed health-message regulations. The FDA's
proposal appears to dovetail with what lawmakers have in
mind, and the agency's regulatory timetable for issuing new
regulations -- by early 1991 -- appears to satisfy them as
well.</p>
