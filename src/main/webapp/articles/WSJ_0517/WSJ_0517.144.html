	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- The Fourth of July is a long way off, but
the fireworks have already started here.
   Declaring its own independence from the federal calendar,
the city of Pittsburgh will hold its celebration of
Independence Day on July 3 this year, even though the Fourth
remains a holiday. Despite tradition, city officials figure
it's a way to save some money.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the decision has lit a fire under some residents, who
consider it dumb and, if nothing else, un-American.</p>
<p>Not so, counters Pittsburgh Mayor Sophie Masloff, who made
the change through her authority as chief civic permit giver.
Through an aide, the 72-year-old mayor insists the change
shouldn't be seen as a litmus test of her patriotism. It's a
prudent move, she says, because it will save about $23,000 in
holiday overtime for police officers, fire fighters,
ambulance workers and city park employees.</p>
<p>As for people who have complained, city officials say,
they should consider themselves fortunate for having even a
July 3 celebration. It was "either canceling the Fourth of
July celebration or compromising," says Albert Neri, the
mayor's press secretary.</p>
<p>Still, the mayor's rationale hasn't cooled the fire of
local business owners. They say the switch will cost them
thousands of dollars because people won't be coming downtown
on the Fourth.</p>
<p>"Anytime they change the celebration of a holiday two
months ahead is asinine. If you're going to make a change,
make it for 1991, don't make it for the same year," says
Sonnie Miller, co-owner of Love Tourists, a local tour-guide
operator. Now, Ms. Miller says, her company is going to have
to notify 181 people who booked a dinner cruise on the Fourth
expecting to sail down the Allegheny River with fireworks
bursting overhead.</p>
<p>The city's police are also hopping mad. They charge that
the mayor is merely being vindictive. She's sour, they say,
because city employees won an arbitration case in February
that more than doubles their overtime pay on holidays.</p>
<p>Although the city will sidestep holiday overtime pay, the
police department may have the last laugh. Patrick McNamarah,
president of the Fraternal Order of Police, says the
department normally has more officers off on Tuesdays than
Wednesdays. So the city will have to pay some overtime to
bring in extra officers on July 3, a Tuesday.</p>
