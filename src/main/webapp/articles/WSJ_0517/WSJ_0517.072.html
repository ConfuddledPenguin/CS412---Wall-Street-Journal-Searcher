	<p class="article-leader">Maybe George Bush convened the budget summit because he
felt sorry for Washington. Out in places like Prague, Riga,
Mexico City and Moscow, democracies are being created, ideas
are flying and national systems are being transformed. Back
in Washington, the inheritors of the Constitutional
Convention are spending the best years of their lives on . .
. parental leave, Section 301, and carbon dioxide buildup in
the atmosphere.
   So it's heartening to see the old juices flowing again.
Democrats ripping Dick Darman. Another press run at John
Sununu's power. The smell of the White House putting the tax
fat in the fire. Republicans gagging. Sunday-morning viewers
abandoning the excitements of the Discovery Channel to watch
the talk shows again. But George Bush is a shrewd man, and we
suspect he knows that one of the great attributes of the
American political circus is that if you pull enough people
under the big top, a few may go off in a corner and
accomplish something serious -- such as getting a rope around
the out-of-control federal budget.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The spending side of the federal budget has had quite a
run 16 years to be exact. It began back in 1974 with passage
of the ironically titled Budget Reform Act. One of the act's
chief "reforms" was to eviscerate the President's rescission
authority, or the power to trim back spending levels. One
year after the new budget law, spending as a percentage of
GNP had jumped from 19% to 21.8%. Except for 1979, it has
never fallen below 21%. Yet on Monday, Senate Budget
Committee Chairman Jim Sasser announced with the confidence
of a man who has been at it since 1977, "The problem is not
the process. The problem is that revenues do not match
outlays."</p>
<p>How ungrateful of the American people the past 16 years
not to convey tax payments equal to the spending commitments
made by Senator Sasser on their behalf. How irresponsible for
the citizenry to have created these deficits by voting in the
last three presidential elections for men who opposed raising
federal receipts to cover the outlays of Senator Sasser's
blameless "process."</p>
<p>In the accompanying chart, we depict the level of budget
receipts collected by Washington since the end of World War
II (see accompanying illustration -- WSJ May 17, 1990). Note
that taxes today as a percentage of GNP are roughly at levels
seen only during the wartime periods of Vietnam and Korea.</p>
<p>Therefore we disagree emphatically with those members of
the Washington establishment who, like former congressional
budget office head Alice Rivlin, are now describing proposals
to reform the process "mostly diversionary." Ms. Rivlin, like
Senator Sasser, simply wants taxes hiked. As to the spending
cuts, well, we all have read articles and heard calls on the
TV talk shows for a gas tax, liquor tax, tobacco tax, sales
tax, VAT tax, user fees, pollution tax, popping the bubble
and taxing the rich. But has anyone read a single, serious,
detailed article about spending cuts?</p>
<p>In fact, the Democratic delegates to the budget summit
came out of the White House Tuesday saying that they wanted
the President to go on national TV and propose spending cuts.
News reports yesterday on the summit had the Democrats saying
that the President had to take responsibility for financial
sacrifices, and the President had to help them sell the hard
decisions to their constituents.</p>
<p>Yet let anyone suggest that this same President should
have line-item veto authority or even enhanced rescission
power and suddenly Senator Byrd is back on Mount Olympus:
"You eliminate the need for Congress." Senator Hatch: "It
would give the President an unprecedented power to play
politics with the budget." Heaven forfend]</p>
<p>But of course it would allow the President to play
hardball with the 535 members of Congress who for 16 years
have pushed spending through "omnibus appropriations" and
"supplementals" to its current level of $1.2 trillion.</p>
<p>Process reforms are not a diversion. They must be at the
heart of any serious agreement to tame the deficit if the
deal is to withstand future assaults by Congress's spenders.</p>
<p>Finally, if the parties to this budget summit come away
with a deal that raises taxes higher than current levels with
no lasting institutional reform, then the case grows for a
constitutional 12-year limit on congressional terms.</p>
