	<p class="article-leader">Chyron Corp., a Melville, N.Y., manufacturer of television
graphics and special-effects equipment, reported a $2 million
fiscal third-quarter net loss on a 36% sales drop.
   Hurting results in the quarter were the company's halting
of a deferred-payment plan for dealers and customers,
expenses from unsuccessful merger discussions, and an
unprofitable subsidiary.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Chyron shares fell 25 cents to $1.75.</p>
<p>Adjusted for a 2% stock dividend paid March 1, the loss
for the quarter ended March 31 equaled 17 cents a share,
compared with net income of $112,000, or one cent a share, in
the year-earlier period. Sales sank to $7.7 million from
$11.9 million.</p>
<p>Alfred O.P. Leubert, chairman and chief executive officer,
said that effective Jan. 1, the company stopped offering
extended payment terms. Dealers now will pare inventories and
order products as they need them. "We see the loss of sales
as temporary," he said.</p>
