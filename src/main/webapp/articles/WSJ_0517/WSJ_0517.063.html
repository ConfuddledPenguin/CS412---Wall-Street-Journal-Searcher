	<h3>Economy: Economists See Europe Carrying the U.S. --- Upbeat Mood Is Crimped Only By Inflation Vigilance</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- Europe's current economic boom, fueled by unity
in the West and collapsing walls in the East, should be more
than capable of withstanding any slowdown in U.S. economic
growth, economists and businessmen here say.
   With factories in France and West Germany working close to
capacity, however, and West Germany preoccupied with the
costly task of absorbing East Germany, the risk of reignited
inflation on the continent remains high. Inflation in Britain
reached an eight-year high of 9.4% in April, and is expected
to near or top double figures before subsiding. British
industrial growth trails that of its continental partners.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But mainly the mood here is euphoric. "The outlook is
unremittingly rosy," says Jacques Plassard, the head of
Rexeco, a Paris forecasting company. "The main brake on
economic growth right now is not enough skilled workers and
industrial capacity. This should keep growth to a level of 3%
to 3.5% across Europe, which in turn should keep inflation
down in France and Germany." In the medium term, says Mr.
Plassard, the opening of Eastern Europe should solve Western
Europe's skilled labor and capacity problems much faster than
they would have been solved had the Iron Curtain stayed up.</p>
<p>Mr. Plassard adds that European growth is now helping to
pull along the U.S. economy, a reversal of historical trends.
"France is running a trade deficit with the U.S., while the
German trade surplus with the U.S. is falling," he says. "So
two of its major trading partners are aiding U.S. growth."</p>
<p>The Franco-German couple looks like it can exceed all
growth forecasts this year, just as it did last year. Both
countries' economies grew by about 4% last year, way ahead of
expectations. The West German economics ministry this week
raised its estimate for this year to 4%. The official French
statistical office INSEE currently pegs French growth at 3.4%
this year, but private economists expect that to be revised
up toward 4% as the year goes on. For the first time in many
years, France may even end the year with a lower inflation
rate than its neighbor.</p>
<p>"The economies of France and Germany, as well as all of
Europe, are going to be drawn toward higher growth by the
needs of Eastern Europe," says French Finance Minister Pierre
Beregovoy. "And the fact that German unity is happening at
the same time as closer economic and monetary union in
Western Europe isn't a contradiction, but rather reinforces
both processes."</p>
<p>The speedy reunification of Germany is forcing West German
companies, especially, to plan and make quicker, bigger
investments in the East, rather than sit on that money in
West German banks. Elsewhere, mergers, acquisitions and
investments continue to quicken on the continent as companies
prepare for the removal of most trade barriers within the
European Community by the end of 1992. "It's a pure case of
what (John Maynard) Keynes called the release of the animal
spirits of entrepreneurs," says Giles Keating, chief
economist for Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd. in London.
"Europe in the 1990s will see a major increase in
investment."</p>
<p>David Lomax, group chief economist at National Westminster
Bank in London, adds: "West Germany is the first beneficiary
of the investment boom, because it makes the capital goods in
Europe." Mr. Lomax estimates that East Germany alone will
absorb nearly $200 billion of investment over the next 10
years or so, which in itself would give a small but
measurable boost of between 0.5% and 1% to Europe's growth.</p>
<p>But the real boost goes well beyond the figures. European,
especially West German, companies of all sizes are rushing to
either sell to Eastern Europe, invest in it, or both,
especially in East Germany. All the big West German banks are
opening branch networks in the East. Volkswagen AG will make
and sell cars there. Fiat S.p.A. has big plans in the Soviet
Union. Virtually every European carmaker is looking into
investing in or buying Skoda, the Czech auto company.</p>
<p>In addition to private investment, Western governments
will inject more than $10 billion into Eastern Europe over
the next few years through official grants. "There is the
potential for a classic, investmentled expansion, with
incomes and productivity levels spreading across open
borders, just as classic economic theory tells us they will,"
Mr. Lomax adds.</p>
<p>Managing this expansion is largely a question of keeping
inflation in check. West German inflation of about 4% is
worrisome to both the Bundesbank and securities markets,
which expect higher German interest rates and increased
inflation to pay for reunification. But so far, at least,
this inflation pressure hasn't spread to France, which
recently managed to cut interest rates a little. In Britain,
worrisome inflation is seen as largely self-generated, as
British wage increases have run well ahead of productivity
increases, and consumer demand has remained relatively
strong.</p>
<p>Worries about German inflation and potentially big
interest-rate increases there to control it, have sent
jitters through the Frankfurt-based stock and bond markets.
But much of this money has found its way westward to Paris,
where the Bourse has recently touched record levels.</p>
<p>Michel Develle, chief economist for Banque Paribas in
Paris, thinks inflation won't get out of hand, but he is also
much more pessimistic about the strength of Europe's economy
than are most of his colleagues. He sees growth slowing
everywhere, to under 4% in Germany, and to zero in Britain
and the U.S. This is "not at all a catastrophe," he says,
reasoning that slower growth will lessen inflationary
pressures.</p>
<p>So far, Europe's higher-than-expected growth has had an
uneven impact on its higher-than-desired unemployment, which
is down nearly everywhere but not by much. In France, it
remains a stubborn 9.4% and in West Germany 7.3%, both well
above the U.S. figure of 5.4%. The British rate has dropped
steadily to 5.6%, but many economists expect it to rise
before it falls any further.</p>
<p>Mr. Plassard of Rexeco says that both the French and
German figures are misleading. "Both countries face a big
shortage of skilled labor. The unemployment is among the
unskilled, or women seeking part-time jobs, or immigrants who
have been laid off from less-efficient enterprises. The
welfare systems also encourage less-skilled people to stay
unemployed rather than take a low-paying job."</p>
