	<p class="article-leader">As an accounting firm on the make, Laventhol & Horwath was
eager five years ago to land an unusual new client: the
religious organization of now-defrocked and imprisoned
evangelist Jim Bakker.
   The work for his PTL brought Laventhol fees of $180,000 a
year -- and a lawsuit seeking $184 million in damages from
Laventhol and many other defendants.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The suit is only one of a series directed at Laventhol,
which over the past three years has been forced to pay out
more than $50 million for allegedly sloppy audit,
financial-statement and tax work. After insurance recoveries,
it was still out at least $20 million. Two years ago,
Laventhol also suffered the distinction of being the first
accounting firm to lose a jury trial under the federal
anti-racketeering law.</p>
<p>Laventhol, once one of the nation's fastest-growing
accounting firms and now the seventh-largest (425 partners in
51 offices), has hit hard times. Key employees are leaving.
An important Canadian affiliate has defected to Price
Waterhouse. Laventhol's operating profits, prior to legal
costs, have declined in the past two years. Lenders are said
to be pushing it to sell major units.</p>
<p>What caused such a decline? Consultants to accounting
firms say Philadelphia-based Laventhol, which acquired no
fewer than 70 other firms between 1968 and 1980, grew too
quickly. From 1980 to 1986, its annual revenue surged almost
fourfold to $275 million; since then it has grown 28% more,
to $345 million.</p>
<p>"Laventhol was overly aggressive doing some mergers that
it shouldn't have done and therefore probably didn't pay as
much attention" as it should have to the quality of the firms
it was buying and of the new clients it was picking up, says
Jay Nisberg, a Ridgefield, Conn., consultant. "It may soon be
scrambling for a merger to stay afloat." Laventhol won't
comment.</p>
<p>Lawrence Reisman, a former Laventhol tax supervisor,
thinks he knows why the firm got into trouble. He and many
others in accounting believe that Laventhol took too many
risky clients like PTL -- a strategy that, ironically,
accountants often advise their clients to avoid.</p>
<p>When he was at Laventhol in late 1982, Mr. Reisman and his
boss, Martin Helpern, sent a memo to the managing partner of
the New York office recommending that the firm drop a Houston
oil-drilling tax shelter as a client. Laventhol was getting
$150,000 a year to do the shelter's tax and audit work. But
Messrs. Reisman and Helpern said expenses that the shelter,
Terra Drill & Heavy Oil, was deducting to sublicense a new
drill gun "are not a valid business deduction." They
questioned whether Laventhol's reputation is "enhanced by our
association with this type of sham."</p>
<p>The New York managing partner, Leonard Douglas, rejected
the advice. "Every person is entitled to be represented by as
competent a professional as he can get," he wrote back. "Even
in criminal law, there is a guaranteed right under the
constitution. The client is entitled to representation." Mr.
Douglas recently retired; messages left for him at Laventhol
weren't returned.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Laventhol, Messrs. Reisman and Helpern
proved prophetic. The Internal Revenue Service later
disallowed all the deductions claimed by Terra's investors.
In a deposition taken by investor-plaintiffs in a subsequent
class-action lawsuit, Neil Kran, an IRS engineer who
investigated Terra, said the shelter's "sublicense fees are
unsupported by the value of the rights acquired." Terra
officials defended the fees but said they needed more time to
make the drill commercially feasible.</p>
<p>In 1986, the class-action lawsuit, filed in federal
district court in Houston, charged that Laventhol helped
mislead hundreds of investors into buying allegedly
fraudulent limited partnerships in Terra. The suit contended
that the investors lost $42 million. Last December, a federal
jury returned a $72 million judgment, including interest,
against Laventhol for allegedly violating anti-fraud statutes
in working for the shelter.</p>
<p>Laventhol settled the suit early this year for $13.5
million, of which only $4.4 million was covered by insurance.
Richard Drubel, a Houston attorney who represented the
investors who sued, says, "We offered to settle the case
before trial for $5 million. Apparently, Laventhol likes to
take risks. They lost this one, too."</p>
<p>As for other matters, Laventhol confirms the recent loss
of its Toronto affiliate, with its 30 partners and 200
professional staffers, to Price Waterhouse; Eric Slavens,
co-managing partner in Toronto, says the affiliate needed
"more cross-country coverage for clients in Canada."</p>
<p>Laventhol declines to comment on its other problems. This
would be only a "rehashing of past situations and innuendo
and unattributed false claims," the firm says. Robert N.
Levine, who will assume the top post at Laventhol on June 1
and is actually running the firm now, declines to go beyond
this.</p>
<p>Laventhol's recent payouts in legal settlements are
enormous and are stretching the firm's insurance coverage. An
out-of-court settlement in Chicago last October with nine
creditor banks in a holding-company bankruptcy cost Laventhol
at least $30 million. Of that, only $18.5 million was covered
by insurance.</p>
<p>In 1988, Laventhol paid $15 million in an out-of-court
settlement of the suit it lost under RICO, the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law. The firm has said
the settlement was covered by insurance. In that case, in
federal court in Sacramento, Calif., the jury found that
investors, relying on Laventhol's audits of fraudulent
cattle-breeding tax shelters, put more than $20 million into
the partnerships, which then collapsed and resulted in tax
penalties for the investors.</p>
<p>Laventhol still isn't free of lawsuits alleging
professional negligence. In 1988, shareholders of Convenient
Food Mart charged in a state court in Chicago that Laventhol,
the food-store franchiser's auditor in 1986 and 1987, didn't
adequately review and check work papers and other information
prepared by Convenient. In mid-1988, Convenient stunned
securities analysts by disclosing that it had overstated 1987
profits by 68%.</p>
<p>Another case involved a report issued by Laventhol for
Wieboldt Stores Inc. in 1985. The report stated that a
leveraged buy-out of the store chain wouldn't make it
insolvent. Former Wieboldt stockholder-managers, who were
sued in Chicago federal court by Wieboldt's bankruptcy
trustee for allegedly running the company into the ground,
charged in their own suit in the same court that Laventhol
had misrepresented the retailer's finances.</p>
<p>Laventhol has denied allegations in both of these
still-pending cases but declines to comment further.</p>
<p>Laventhol also must regret taking on the PTL ministry.
After Deloitte, Haskins & Sells (later merged with Touche
Ross to form Deloitte & Touche) was dropped for unexplained
reasons by the PTL in 1984, Laventhol took the job a year
later.</p>
<p>In 1987, a group of investors with "lifetime memberships"
in the PTL sued Mr. Bakker and others, including Laventhol,
in federal court in Charlotte, N.C. They charged that the PTL
had perpetrated a massive fraud against them. The suit
alleges that Laventhol helped Mr. Bakker "cook the books" and
turn a $19 million loss into a $26 million profit in the
fiscal year ended May 31, 1986. It says Laventhol permitted
the PTL to change the method of amortizing lifetime partner
income to "convey to bankers and other outside partners a
false sense of solvency."</p>
<p>PTL directors, the suit says, were "lulled into a false
sense of security" about PTL's finances by Mr. Bakker. The
suit says he told them the PTL "had excellent accountants,
that it had internal control by certified public accountants
{and} that it had external audits by reputable firms."</p>
<p>The suit also charges that $60,000 of the annual $180,000
audit fee that Laventhol collected was "to manage a secret
bank account" that the PTL allegedly used to conceal
embezzlement by some of its top officers. The suit says the
PTL's vice president for finance wasn't allowed to know what
was in the account but "the outside auditors {Laventhol}
maintained a running account of the funds."</p>
<p>The PTL has collapsed, and Mr. Bakker has gone to prison
after being found guilty of financial fraud. In 1987, after
Mr. Bakker resigned from the PTL amid the scandal, his
successors replaced Laventhol as PTL's accountant with Arthur
Andersen & Co., which worked for six months to help the PTL
clear up its books.</p>
<p>In court filings in response to the lifetime investors,
Laventhol has noted that it criticized PTL's accounting
controls and qualified PTL's 1986 annual report -- that is,
indicated that it had some reservations about PTL's finances.
As to the bank account, Laventhol told the Washington Post
that it wasn't "secret" but was a "clerical payroll" account
that didn't compromise Laventhol's independence as an
auditor. Laventhol declines to comment further.</p>
<p>Another black eye for Laventhol was its work for Grabill
Corp., a Chicago real-estate firm run by William J. Stoecker.
Mr. Stoecker's empire crumbled early in 1989 when it was
forced to seek bankruptcy-court protection. Last January in
Chicago federal court, Mr. Stoecker was found not guilty of
criminal charges of bankruptcy fraud for allegedly failing to
turn over records to the Chicago bankruptcy court. But his
activities are still under investigation by the U.S.
Attorney's office in Chicago.</p>
<p>Mr. Stoecker, his lawyer says, isn't available for
comment. However, in an interview on the CBS program "60
Minutes" early this year, Mr. Stoecker was asked whether
Laventhol should have been able to see his company was in
trouble. He replied that it should have taken the accountants
"no more than a day or two to look at" his books and see the
company had questionable assets and was low on cash.</p>
<p>According to papers filed by the trustee in the Chicago
bankruptcy court, Laventhol's last audit of Grabill, on June
30, 1988, showed $390 million in assets, including $68.6
million in real estate. Grabill Trustee Jay Steinberg says,
"We cannot reconcile the books to the audit. We found less
than $2 million in real estate."</p>
<p>Laventhol was charging Grabill a fee of close to $1
million a year -- considered exorbitant by many in the
accounting profession. Lee Seidler, a former accounting
professor at New York University and special associate
director of Bear, Stearns & Co., the major securities firm,
says such a huge fee for a small real-estate operation raises
"obvious questions." He adds: "A million dollars a year is
what Bear Stearns pays for its audit. Laventhol failed to
employ one fundamental practice for auditors -- kick the
tires."</p>
<p>Laventhol declines to comment.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Levine, who's currently running Laventhol, is
assumed to be tuning down Laventhol's hunger for new, risky
business, the firm may be showing questionable judgment in
hiring some new executives. Last March, its Chicago office
hired Andrew Doppelt, a former Internal Revenue Service
agent, to head a new financial investigative operation. What
Laventhol apparently didn't know was that Mr. Doppelt was
being criticized for exaggerating the sales of National
Investigative Services Corp., a company that he helped found
several years ago and that went out of business earlier this
year.</p>
<p>National Investigative Services was ranked 125th in the
nation in growth of private companies by Inc. magazine last
year with 1988 sales of $4.7 million. But John Case, an Inc.
senior writer, says now that the company's sales two years
ago "weren't anywhere near $4.7 million." Mr. Case says the
bigger figure was supplied to Inc. in a letter signed by Mr.
Doppelt. Mr. Doppelt denies the figure came from him,
attributing it to a company sales employee he refuses to
name.</p>
<p>Sheldon Epstein, who heads Laventhol's Chicago office,
says National Investigative Services' 1988 sales were "a
little over $1 million." Asked why Laventhol hired Mr.
Doppelt in light of the questionable sales figures, Mr.
Epstein says: "Maybe Andy's ability to run a business isn't
as good as his ability to service clients. He is one of the
best professionals at helping trustees uncover assets after a
bankruptcy and finding individuals who counterfeit products
without paying royalties. We feel we can manage him without
any problems."</p>
<p>In the wake of Laventhol's troubles, a raft of top
Laventhol executives are leaving the firm. For example,
Steven Matthews, a former Laventhol employee-benefits
consultant in Phoenix, Ariz., says he left last March
"because of the litigation problems."</p>
<p>Mr. Reisman, the former Laventhol man who urged caution,
left the firm in 1983 and now has a New York tax practice. He
says he was upset about Laventhol's professional standards.
"The urge to take such risks there was too ferocious," he
says. "The dog-eat-dog atmosphere and knowledge that if you
weren't willing to cut a corner, someone else would be found
there who will, was too much for me."</p>
