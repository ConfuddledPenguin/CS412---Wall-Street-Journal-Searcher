	<p class="article-leader">Results from the infamous Nazi medical experiments at
Dachau to see how much cold the human body could withstand
are scientifically useless, a Harvard Medical School surgeon
said.
   The surgeon, Robert L. Berger, reported that he had
examined the surviving Nazi report on the experiments in
which Dachau prisoners were immersed in tanks of ice water
under various conditions. It is believed that as many as 300
male prisoners were subjected to the experiments, of whom 80
to 90 died.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In an article in this week's New England Journal of
Medicine, Dr. Berger said he undertook the examination
because of a long-simmering debate over whether scientists
should use the results of the experiments despite their
atrocious nature. Some physiologists claim the results might
help advance research on the body's response to cooling --
hypothermia -- and thus save lives. But others, like Arnold
Relman, editor of the New England Journal of Medicine,
advocate a total ban on using the Nazi results because the
experiments were "a gross violation of human standards."</p>
<p>Dr. Berger wrote that the 56-page report to SS
Reichsfuhrer Heinrich Himmler on the results of the Dachau
experiments was "riddled with inconsistencies" and contained
evidence of data falsification and fabrication. "On analysis,
the Dachau hypothermia study has all the ingredients of a
scientific fraud, and rejection of the data on purely
scientific grounds is inevitable. They cannot advance science
or save human lives," the surgeon wrote.</p>
