	<p class="article-leader">Data General Corp. unveiled four new models of its Aviion
workstation family that are based on Motorola Inc.'s 88000
RISC microprocessor.
   Data General, Westboro, Mass., said its new AV-200
workstation, with a base price of $5,950, runs at 17 million
instructions per second, or MIPS, a common industry measure
of performance. The company said its price of $350 per MIPS
is lower than that of RISC workstations of other computer
makers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Data General, a maker of midrange systems, has been going
through a difficult period as sales of its proprietary
midrange computers slow down. It is counting on the Aviion
series, introduced last year, to lead to a turnaround.</p>
<p>Data General also unveiled the $12,995 AV 3200 server
system, which can work as the center of a network of
workstations or personal computers. It also introduced two
faster, more expensive servers.</p>
