	<p class="article-leader">Some individuals infected with the AIDS virus may not be
detected by current testing procedures, according to a new
study.
   Researchers at Emory University and the Centers for
Disease Control, both in Atlanta, examined a group of 165
individuals at high risk of having the virus associated with
acquired immune deficiency syndrome. While no one in the
group had tested positive for AIDS using conventional
examinations, a new test found that 30 individuals -- or 18%
of the group -- were, in fact, infected.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The report, which appears in the current issue of the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, doesn't mean
that current testing procedures are inadequate or should be
replaced, says A. Ahmed-Ansari, a professor at Emory and one
of the authors of the study. Rather, he says, the new test
provides a "window for early detection {of the virus} in
high-risk groups," such as drug abusers.</p>
<p>Current tests for AIDS involve examining serum samples for
the presence of antibodies against the human immunodeficiency
virus. The new test involves stimulating purified blood cells
to induce the release of such antibodies.</p>
