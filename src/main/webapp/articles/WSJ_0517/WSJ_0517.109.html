	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Most interest rates ended little changed
despite further signs that inflation pressures have eased
from their torrid pace earlier this year.
   A government report yesterday morning showing that
consumer prices rose only 0.2% last month sparked a brief
bond-market rally. That was the mildest increase since
September and was slightly less than the 0.3% rise many
analysts expected.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the rally didn't last long, partly because of growing
concern about the nation's huge budget deficit. Several money
managers and bond traders are worried about the lack of
progress so far in budget talks between Bush administration
officials and congressional leaders.</p>
<p>Prices of actively traded Treasury notes and bonds ended
the day unchanged to slightly lower. Long-term government
bonds fell about 1/8 point, or about $1.25 for each $1,000
face amount. Short-term Treasury bill rates were flat.</p>
<p>Washington's growing budget woes are "not a positive for
the bond markets," said William Brachfeld, executive vice
president and head of fixed-income securities trading at
Daiwa Securities America Inc. He said several Daiwa clients
here and in Japan "are increasingly concerned" about the
failure so far of the White House and congressional leaders
to agree on a big deficit-reduction package.</p>
<p>The budget talks are being watched closely because an
accord could mean less government borrowing and might even
encourage the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates. The
Fed's policy-making arm, the Federal Open Market Committee,
met Tuesday to review strategy.</p>
<p>Until recently, many analysts had expected the Fed to
raise short-term rates in an effort to fight an inflation
problem that appeared to be growing. But those worries
evaporated quickly following a string of government reports
showing unexpectedly weak business activity and less
inflation than generally feared. Now, the consensus is that
the Fed will hold short-term rates steady in coming weeks.</p>
<p>However, the Treasury's borrowing needs remain huge, and
investors received a fresh reminder of this yesterday.</p>
<p>The Treasury said it will sell $10.8 billion of new
two-year notes Wednesday, followed Thursday by the sale of
$8.5 billion of notes due in five years and two months. The
size of these two sales was "bigger than expected," said
Kevin Flanagan, money-market economist at Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. "It eclipsed even our gloomy expectations."</p>
<p>Mr. Flanagan and other analysts worry that the Treasury's
borrowing needs could be exacerbated by the thrift bailout
and a growing federal deficit. "Things don't look that rosy
for next year" for the budget deficit, Mr. Flanagan said.</p>
<p>Late yesterday, the new two-year notes were quoted in
when-issued trading at 8.55%, while the new five-year,
two-month notes were trading at about 8.60%.</p>
<p>Fed officials probably won't make any credit policy
changes at least until early next month, after the release of
May employment statistics, several analysts said. The April
employment report, released earlier this month, showed much
smaller employment gains than expected.</p>
<p>Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities Co.
International Inc., said the bond market appears to be "on
hold" until the May jobs report. Until then, Treasury bond
yields are likely to hover between 8.55% and 8.75%, he said.</p>
<p>Corporate Issues</p>
<p>Lured by lower borrowing costs, two more large
corporations tapped the bond market.</p>
<p>Sears, Roebuck & Co., the Chicago-based retailer, was the
biggest borrower in the corporate debt market with a $400
million offering of new three-year notes. The non-callable
notes were priced to yield 9.387%. Underwriters led by
Goldman, Sachs & Co. boosted the size of the issue from $300
million in response to strong investor demand.</p>
<p>Desmond Wong, corporate finance director at Sears, said
the company decided to tap the market after the consumer
price report showed an unexpectedly small increase in
inflation last month. "In our case, we just saw the
opportunity when the consumer price index was announced and
the market was stable," he said. "We are getting a coupon of
9.35%, and for a three-year, we think that's a good level for
us."</p>
<p>Separately, Maytag Corp. sold $200 million of 12-year
debentures. Thomas Ringgenberg, treasurer at Maytag, said the
appliance maker had been seeking to tap the market for some
time. However, "it was really last Friday's PPI {producer
price index} number that caused {yields on} Treasurys to come
down within our range" and prompted Maytag to issue debt, he
said. Maytag's 12-year debentures were priced to yield
9.814%.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, many other corporate treasurers are waiting
on the sidelines for lower rates before they tap the market.</p>
<p>"It's going to take a long {Treasury} bond range of
between 8 3/8% and 8 1/2% to bring a lot of corporate
treasurers in," said James Quigley of Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets. The Treasury's 30-year bonds yielded about 8 5/8% as
of late yesterday.</p>
<p>In the investment-grade corporate debt market, corporate
issues closed between 1/8 and 1/4 point lower. In the junk
bond market, high-yield issues, or bonds with
below-investment-grade ratings, ended the day mixed.</p>
<p>Among the junk bonds that advanced were issues of
Owens-Illinois Inc. as investors were encouraged by the
company's first-quarter earnings report. But among the big
losers in the market were junk bonds of Burlington Holdings
Inc., which slipped about 1/2 point on average.</p>
<p>Mortgage-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Mortgage securities fell 1/32 to 5/32 point, but most
issues held up better than Treasurys despite talk that the
Resolution Trust Corp. sold as much as $1 billion of mortgage
issues.</p>
<p>The RTC, the government conservator for failed thrifts,
has stepped up its sales of mortgage securities in recent
weeks as it seeks to resolve the situations of 141 thrifts by
the end of the quarter.</p>
<p>While the RTC was a rumored seller, there also was strong
demand for mortgage securities.</p>
<p>Government National Mortgage Association 9% securities for
June delivery ended at 95 18/32, down 2/32; 9 1/2% securities
were at 97 30/32, down 3/32; 10% securities were at 100
13/32, down 1/32; and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9 1/2%
securities were at 97 1/2, down 5/32.</p>
<p>The Ginnie Mae 10% issue was supported by the issuance of
a $500 million real estate mortgage investment conduit backed
by 10% securities via Salomon Brothers Inc.</p>
<p>The Ginnie Mae 9% issue was yielding 9.78% to a 12-year
average life assumption, as the spread above the Treasury
10-year note narrowed 0.01 percentage point to 1.12.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>After a brief early-morning rally, Treasury bond prices
reversed direction, finishing the day with slight declines.</p>
<p>The government's benchmark 30-year bond initially rose to
101 19/32, a gain of about 1/4 point from Tuesday. But by
late in the afternoon, the price had fallen to 101 6/32, to
yield 8.63%.</p>
<p>The latest 10-year notes fell to 101 9/32 from 101 14/32.
Earlier yesterday, the issue traded as high as 101 19/32. The
yield rose to 8.66% from 8.64%.</p>
<p>However, prices of two-year Treasury notes inched higher,
helped by rumors that an institution had purchased a large
amount of the latest two-year issue and sold a similar-sized
block of long-term bonds. The two-year notes rose 1/32 point
to 100 19/32 to yield 8.51%.</p>
<p>Municipals</p>
<p>Tax-exempt issues ended mostly unchanged to off 1/8 point
with some issues trading down 1/4 in a moderately active
session.</p>
<p>In new-issue activity, $266 million in debt was priced,
following more than $1 billion on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In related activity, Moody's Investors Service Inc.
confirmed its single-A-1 rating on Nassau County's general
obligation bonds, citing the New York county's "strong,
diverse and affluent economic base" that provides
"fundamental credit strength." The confirmation came ahead of
the sale today of $85.1 million of various purpose bonds via
competitive bid.</p>
<p>Among seasoned bonds, New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% issue of 2018 was unchanged at 98 bid to yield 7.36%.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>Snapping a three-day rally, Japanese government bond
prices fell as the yen sank against the dollar.</p>
<p>Japan's benchmark bond due in 1999 was quoted in
mid-afternoon at a price of 87.79, down 0.34, to yield 7%.</p>
<p>In other major markets, West German bond prices drifted
lower as traders braced for a heavy supply of new borrowing.
The government is creating a 115 billion mark ($69.8 billion)
special German Unity Fund, which will issue large amounts of
debt to raise money to rebuild East Germany's economy. West
Germany's 7 3/4% bonds of 2000 fell 0.15 point to 93.95 to
yield 8.69%.</p>
<p>In London, British government bond prices seesawed
throughout the day, ending very close to where they were the
previous day. Britain's benchmark 11 3/4% bonds due 2003/2007
declined 1/8 point to 98 7/32 to yield 12%. The 12% bonds due
1995 rose 1/32 point to 96 27/32 to yield 12.92%, while the
11 3/4% issue due 1991 was unchanged at 98 6/32 to yield
14.75%.</p>
