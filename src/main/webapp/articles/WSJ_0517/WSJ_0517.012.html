	<p class="article-leader">Landmark Land Co. said it retained Salomon Brothers Inc.
to explore a possible sale of the company, one week after its
proposed $967 million land sale was thwarted by federal
authorities.
   The Carmel, Calif., company, which owns its real estate
through its New Orleans-based Oak Tree Savings, said last
week that the Office of Thrift Supervision had objected to
its plan to finance 75% of the real estate sale to California
developer Barry G. Hon.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yesterday it said it would instead sell just one
development to Mr. Hon for $275 million, and that it would
explore restructuring or selling the entire company.</p>
<p>Landmark said it would realize a $170 million pretax
profit if the sale to Mr. Hon closes. Landmark Chairman
Gerald G. Barton said that while the Office of Thrift
Supervision hadn't explicitly approved the transaction, he
believed the sale fell within federal guidelines.</p>
<p>The OTS had objected to the previous agreement with Mr.
Hon, because the transaction would have committed more than
20% of Landmark's assets to a single borrower.</p>
<p>The possible sale of Landmark is a direct result of the
Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act
of 1989, which tightened restrictions on savings and loan
associations' ownership of real estate.</p>
<p>The company is best known for its ownership and management
of golf resorts, including PGA West, La Quinta and Mission
Hills, all located in the Palm Springs area. Salomon Bros.'
managing director in charge of real estate, J. Steven
Manolis, said the company's real estate and golf management
could be attractive to Japanese buyers. But in the past six
months, Japanese interests have generally shunned
high-profile U.S. real estate deals, partly because of
anti-Japanese sentiment.</p>
<p>Mr. Barton said it was possible a single buyer such as Mr.
Hon, a Southern California home builder and land developer,
would emerge to purchase the company's real estate, and a
different investor would wind up owning Oak Tree Savings.</p>
<p>Landmark, which has only eight million shares outstanding,
is 28%-owned by Mr. Barton and 24%-owned by Olympia & York
Developments Ltd., the Toronto conglomerate controlled by the
Reichmann brothers.</p>
<p>In American Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Landmark
stock rose 50 cents a share to $10.875.</p>
