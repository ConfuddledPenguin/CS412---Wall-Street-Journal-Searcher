	<p class="article-leader">TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Trading in the New Taiwan dollar
continued to be volatile Wednesday, one day after Taiwan's
central bank withdrew support for the unit. Analysts said the
currency is likely to remain shaky for several weeks.
   After a roller-coaster day of trading, the currency closed
in Taipei at NT$27.35 to one U.S. dollar, near its intraday
low but stronger than its close of NT$27.50 to the U.S.
dollar on Tuesday, when the Taiwanese currency plunged
approximately 4%, its sharpest fall since 1981.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As a drop in stock prices and expectations of slower
economic growth increased pressure against the New Taiwan
dollar, the central bank had spent about US$6 billion to
support the currency this year. But in the final minutes of
trading Tuesday, the central bank pulled its support. Some
dealers said the bank joined speculators and started selling
New Taiwan dollars.</p>
<p>Several dealers said there was no apparent intervention
Wednesday, but one report said the central bank sold
approximately US$40 million.</p>
<p>Several dealers said the central bank's main goal is to
push out speculators because of concern they might shift
their attention to the foreign-exchange market from the
declining stock market. On Wednesday, share prices on the
local stock exchange plunged 6% in response to the New Taiwan
dollar's tumble.</p>
<p>Officials of the central bank have been unavailable for
comment since Tuesday. On Sunday, the bank's governor, Samuel
Shieh, denied rumors that the currency was about to be
devalued.</p>
<p>The U.S. has long urged Taiwan to let market forces,
rather than manipulation, rule foreign-exchange rates. In
April, the U.S. Treasury gave Taiwan improved marks for
allowing the rate to more closely follow the market. That is
just what Taiwan's central bank did Tuesday.</p>
<p>Dealers said the New Taiwan dollar might rally a bit in
the next few days but is likely to consolidate around a rate
of NT$27 to the U.S. dollar for a few months while people
holding the currency evaluate changes in the country's
economy.</p>
