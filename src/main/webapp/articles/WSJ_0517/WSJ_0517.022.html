	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Varity Corp. said it proposed to amalgamate the
operations of Kelsey-Hayes Canada and its Kelsey-Hayes unit
in a transaction valued at about C$36 million.
   Varity said it plans to offer the minority shareholders of
Kelsey-Hayes Canada either C$20 (US$17.01) a share or a yet
to be determined number of Varity common shares for their
holdings in the Canadian unit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At last report, minority shareholders own about about 1.8
million shares of Kelsey-Hayes Canada, or about 27.3% of the
total number of shares outstanding.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Varity said the proposal is "a logical
extension" of Varity's acquisition last year of Detroit-based
K-H Corp., the parent of Kelsey-Hayes Canada.</p>
<p>Varity said it has retained Gordon Capital Corp. to review
the proposed amalgamation and to provide a fairness opinion
on the value of the Varity shares to be offered in exchange
for Kelsey-Hayes Canada shares.</p>
<p>The companies said they expect that the amalgamation
couldn't occur before August.</p>
<p>At least two-thirds of the shareholders of Kelsey-Hayes
Canada would need to approve the amalgamation at a special
meeting. Varity said Kelsey-Hayes Co. would vote its 72.7%
interest in favor of the amalgamation.</p>
<p>Kelsey-Hayes Canada has formed a committee of independent
directors to review the proposal.</p>
