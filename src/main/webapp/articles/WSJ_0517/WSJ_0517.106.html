	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The New York Stock Exchange is expected to
nominate the head of Morgan Stanley Group Inc. as a Big Board
vice chairman, people familiar with the selection process
said.
   The naming of Morgan Stanley Chairman S. Parker Gilbert --
subject to Mr. Gilbert's acceptance and a vote of the
exchange's new board on June 7 -- could have important
repercussions. Among other things, it could solidify the
influence that powerful Morgan Stanley already has over the
exchange's policies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Also, the appointment could defuse an internal debate at
Morgan Stanley over the role of the Big Board on a modern
Wall Street. Some top Morgan officials have been questioning
whether Morgan, at a time when much stock trading is done
away from the traditional exchange floor, needs to remain a
member of the Big Board at all. It's unlikely that Morgan
Stanley would abandon the Big Board while Mr. Gilbert is
serving as a vice chairman.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a Big Board spokeswoman said, "We don't comment
on board matters."</p>
<p>Mr. Gilbert, 56 years old, has been Morgan Stanley's
chairman since 1984 and is the highest-paid chief of a Wall
Street securities firm whose shares trade publicly. According
to Morgan Stanley's latest proxy statement, Mr. Gilbert
earned nearly $5.5 million in cash compensation last year,
double that of his peers at other big firms.</p>
<p>Asked in a brief interview about becoming Big Board vice
chairman, Mr. Gilbert said it would be premature to talk
about the issue.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley already wields much influence at the New
York Stock Exchange, and floor traders both fear it and
respect its technological prowess. There is a faction of
officials within Morgan Stanley that is in favor of
purchasing a specialist firm -- the floor traders who each
have a monopoly on the trading of a particular Big Board
stock -- as almost a charitable act in which Morgan Stanley
could demonstrate how a modern specialist firm can work. But
other Morgan officials who think the exchange is an
anachronism are against such an idea.</p>
<p>Morgan says it's committed to the exchange, although it
has also formed a special, highly secretive committee to
develop an electronic network between giant institutional
investors, enabling them to trade away from the Big Board or
any other exchange floor.</p>
<p>A Morgan spokesman declined comment on the committee or on
the debate over specialist firms, saying both were internal
issues.</p>
<p>The Big Board currently has two vice chairmen, one from
outside the exchange and one from inside. If elected, Mr.
Gilbert, a board member since 1986, would succeed William A.
Schreyer, the chairman of Merrill Lynch & Co. Mr. Schreyer is
ending a five-year term as an exchange director, the last
three as vice chairman. Mr. Gilbert would not have to give up
the Morgan chairmanship.</p>
<p>The "inside" vice chairman is Donald Stone, senior partner
at the Big Board specialist firm Lasker, Stone & Stern. Mr.
Stone doesn't appear to have a challenger for his vice
chairmanship post. Indeed, his name has surfaced as a
possible successor to Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Jr.,
who has said he plans to step down later this year after
about six years as chairman. But Mr. Stone has said he isn't
seeking the chairmanship.</p>
