Refining Corp. sold two million subordinate voting shares of

didn't know who bought the shares. He said Mr. Novelly and
Mr. Goldstein have sold about 3.5 million Horsham subordinate
voting shares in the last few months and currently hold about

Peter Munk, who holds all of the company's multiple voting
shares and about an 83% voting stake.</p>
<p>Mr. Melnuk said Apex Oil, of St. Louis is on the verge of
coming out of U.S. Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.
