	<p class="article-leader">N.V. Philips of the Netherlands said it signed an accord
with Thomson S.A. of France to push jointly for a European
launch of new high-definition television, or HDTV, technology
in 1995.
   French government officials said the two companies,
Europe's biggest consumer electronics concerns, plan to
expand their joint laboratory research in HDTV. Philips
declined to comment. But it said the companies estimate
HDTV's launch may cost all of European industry three billion
European currency units ($3.73 billion); the Philips-Thomson
outlays haven't been decided. HDTV would offer extra-sharp
color pictures, improved sound, and cinema-style screen
formats. But HDTV sets in Europe initially may be priced at
as much as 30,000 French francs ($5,410).</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Billing the HDTV market as the battleground for global
dominance in consumer electronics, big makers have been
seeking government research subsidies. State-controlled
Thomson is negotiating its five-year research budget; the
accord and the big HDTV cost estimate may buttress Thomson's
arguments for increased funding. Thomson declined to comment.</p>
