	<p class="article-leader">CALGARY, Alberta -- North Canadian Oils Ltd. said it plans
an offer to acquire the 13.5% of Bankeno Resources Ltd. that
it doesn't already own in a transaction valued at about 18
million Canadian dollars (US$15.3 million).
   If successful with its planned C$4.25-per-share offer,
North Canadian said it will merge with Bankeno. Both
companies are Calgary-based oil and gas producers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>North Canadian said it expects to mail its offer next
week. Grant Billing, North Canadian's senior vice president,
said the company hopes to complete the purchase by June,
subject to government and regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>Mr. Billing is also president of Bankeno, which said
separately that its board plans to recommend acceptance of
the offer. In Toronto Stock Exchange trading yesterday
Bankeno closed at C$4.20, up C$1.35 a share, and North
Canadian closed at C$18.125, unchanged.</p>
<p>North Canadian's announcement follows its proposal Tuesday
to restructure the debt of Coseka Resources Ltd., of which it
owns 47.6%, and ultimately merge with it.</p>
<p>Pending the outcome of talks with Coseka's lenders, who
collectively hold about C$165 million of debt, North Canadian
hopes also to conclude a merger with Coseka by June, said G.
Barry Padley, senior vice president, finance.</p>
<p>Mr. Padley declined to offer details of the proposed
Coseka debt restructuring, or merger. But he said it would
largely involve cash. North Canadian had cash and short-term
investments of about C$250 million at the end of 1989.</p>
