	<p class="article-leader">PEOPLE'S BANK (Bridgeport, Conn.) -- Moody's Investors
Service Inc. said it lowered its ratings on the commercial
paper and short-term debt of this savings bank to not prime
from prime-3. The rating concern cited weakening asset
quality because of continued deterioration in the Connecticut
real estate market. But Moody's noted that the company has a
valuable retail franchise in Connecticut, a strong capital
position, and low interest-rate sensitivity.</p>
