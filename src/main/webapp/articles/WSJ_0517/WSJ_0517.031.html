	<p class="article-leader">HONG KONG -- More than half of this colony's imports and
exports to China last year were related to outward
processing, according to a government survey released
Wednesday, providing the freshest evidence of the degree to
which Hong Kong's economy is integrated with the mainland.
   The study, which comes less than three weeks before
President Bush is to decide whether to renew China's
most-favored-nation trade status, indicates that 53% of the
colony's 1989 exports to China, or 76.87 billion Hong Kong
dollars (US$9.87 billion) out of a total of HK$145.05
billion, are sent for processing and then reimported into the
colony.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Business and industrial groups in Hong Kong have argued
that the colony would be badly hurt if the U.S. were to
rescind its most favorable import duties on Chinese
merchandise because of the local economy's mounting links
with southern China. President Bush has until June 3 to make
the decision, which could be rejected by Congress.</p>
