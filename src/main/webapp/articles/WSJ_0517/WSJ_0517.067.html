	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Farm policy makers in Congress are in a rush
to pass a politically palatable 1990 farm bill, putting off
until later any deep crop-subsidy cuts that may come out of
the budget summit.
   Such a legislative strategy would let Congress reauthorize
the government's expiring farm programs for another five
years and avoid the pain of slashing agricultural subsidies
until the fall or, conceivably, in a lame-duck session after
the November elections.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Both the House and Senate appear inclined to hold the line
on farm spending by adopting a $53 billion proposal, roughly
what would be spent over the next five years if the 1985 farm
law were extended. At the same time, House and Senate
Democrats are contemplating various plans to boost farm
income, including tying subsidy payments to farm-production
costs or the consumer price index. But they would find
savings elsewhere in the farm budget to offset such subsidy
increases.</p>
<p>The current thinking is that if the White House and
congressional negotiators reach a budget agreement, farm
lawmakers can always go back in September or December and
make whatever cuts are required of agriculture. With the
entire House and one-third of the Senate, including nine
Agriculture Committee members, up for re-election, this
approach has considerable bipartisan appeal.</p>
<p>"Politically, you always look for the course of least
resistance," said Rep. Kika de la Garza, chairman of the
House Agriculture Commitee. "My estimation is that they can't
hit us with any more cuts. {But} if we need to do more, we
will."</p>
<p>At this point, the consensus is that agriculture won't
have to take more than a $1.5 billion cut in fiscal 1991 --
about what the Bush administration has recommended. "There's
a strong case for freezing {commodity} target prices where
they're at," said Rep. Leon Panetta (D., Calif.). "Frankly,
from the view of the House Budget Committee, that wouldn't be
all that bad."</p>
<p>The administration proposes cutting farm-program spending
$19.2 billion over the next five years, while the Senate
budget resolution spares farmers from any cuts. The House
budget resolution calls for cuts totaling $8.1 billion,
including $800 million in fiscal 1991. But it insists that
these cuts be contingent on a summit agreement regarding
taxes or other revenue-raising measures.</p>
<p>"In political and procedural terms, we won't be forcing
spending cuts until we have a revenue deal," said a Budget
Committee staff member. "That could be very much later this
year."</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter
denounced several House Agriculture subcommittees for
exceeding the so-called spending baseline of $53 billion by
$14.3 billion. "Maybe these big, high numbers make good
campaign material back home, but the day of reckoning is
coming," Mr. Yeutter said.</p>
<p>Mr. de la Garza (D., Texas), in turn, cautioned his
colleagues: "We have promised policies we don't have money
for." He now has a contingent of subcommittee chairmen and
ranking Republicans working to bring the budget numbers down.</p>
<p>Taking a bloated farm bill to the House floor would be "a
big mistake," said Rep. Edward Madigan, ranking Republican on
the House Agriculture Committee. "It would be just inviting a
lot of trouble that the committee wouldn't be able to
handle."</p>
<p>For one thing, a coalition of conservative Republicans and
big-city Democrats, led by Rep. Richard Armey (R., Texas) and
Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.), is preparing to pounce on
the bill at the first opportunity. One of the coalition's
main objectives is to prohibit farmers earning $100,000 a
year or more from receiving farm subsidies. Some members also
have targeted certain programs, such as peanuts and sugar, as
being anti-consumer.</p>
<p>"I think their presence dictates to the committee an extra
degree of fiscal responsibility," said Mr. Madigan of
Illinois.</p>
