	<p class="article-leader">Here's a multiple-choice question for parents: How much
will it to cost to send your kids to college?
   a) $500,000</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>b) $50,000</p>
<p>c) Nothing, since you'll never be able to afford it
anyway.</p>
<p>Too often, parents are paralyzed by financial advisers who
sell so-called college-savings investments and equate the
cost of an undergraduate degree with the purchase price of a
B-2 bomber. But while college is expensive, it may be more
affordable than many parents think.</p>
<p>In fact, parents with a two-year-old daughter who save
$419 a month will accumulate $163,334 by the time she starts
college, assuming an 8% annual return -- enough to cover the
projected average cost of four years at a private school. If
they send her to a public school, they will need $77,040, or
$198 a month.</p>
<p>And there are some uncomplicated, no-fee ways for parents
to do their college saving. These include making regular
investments in no-load mutual funds, contributing the maximum
to 401(k) retirement plans at work, and prepaying mortgages.</p>
<p>The most important thing to do is to find a simple plan,
start now and stick with it. Parents who wait until their
child is 10 to start saving will have to put aside $705 a
month to afford a private college.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the investment strategies financial
advisers frequently tell parents about involve
high-commission products purportedly designed for college
savings. "Most of them offer nothing special for college
savers except the name," says Richard E. Anderson, director
of the Forum on College Financing, a federally funded center
at Columbia University.</p>
<p>Among the most common "college investments":</p>
<p>-- Variable and universal life insurance policies offer
earnings that grow tax-deferred. Then, when the child goes to
college, parents can withdraw the premiums, or borrow against
the "cash value" (premiums plus earnings), at rates
comparable to market interest rates, plus or minus one to two
percentage points.</p>
<p>But sales commissions, which are subtracted from policies
in the early years, keep cash values low, making the policies
suitable only for parents who plan to hold them at least 10
and preferably 15 years. In addition, a portion of the annual
premium goes toward the cost of term life insurance, which
reduces yields by cutting into the amount invested.</p>
<p>"The tax advantage is what's driving the sale of these,"
says Glenn Daily, an insurance consultant in New York who has
analyzed the products. But everything considered, he says,
the tax advantage may not be enough to make the policies
worthwhile. "If you hold the policy for at least 10 years --
and optimally 20 -- you may do 0.5% to 0.7% better on an
annual basis than if you bought term insurance and invested
in similar taxable investments."</p>
<p>-- Zero-coupon bonds, including tax-free zero-coupon
municipal bonds, are sold at a big discount to their face
value, making them accessible to many financially strapped
parents. So-called "baccalaureate bonds," offered by at least
12 states specifically for college savings have been
especially popular.</p>
<p>The problem with all fixed-income investments is the
interest-rate risk between the time the investment is made
and when it matures. "If there's an upward shift in
inflation, the purchasing power of these bonds can be
drastically reduced," says Mr. Anderson, who next month
becomes vice chancellor of finance at Washington University
in St. Louis. Moreover, since zeros don't pay interest or
principal until maturity, their market value over the years
will fluctuate more than conventional bonds -- a problem if
they have to be sold before maturity.</p>
<p>-- Prepaid tuition plans, which are offered by four
states, promise to cover the cost of four years at a state
school when the child is ready to attend. Parents "can prepay
up to four years of a college education in today's dollars,
essentially freezing the price so they don't have to worry
about investing their dollars in the interim period," says
Greg Stringer, president of Hemar Corp., St. Paul, Minn.,
which is developing a private prepaid-tuition plan that could
be used at schools nationwide.</p>
<p>What parents get in simplicity, however, they give up in
flexibility. If their child doesn't attend a participating
school, they may get back only their principle, or at best a
4% return. "Parents should investigate cash-out provisions
carefully," says Mr. Anderson.</p>
<p>-- "Income shifting," in which parents put college savings
in their child's name, is supposed to help money grow faster
by reducing the tax bite. The so-called kiddie tax has
crimped this approach a bit, by taxing unearned income of
children under age 14 at the parents' rate on amounts above
$1,000. But many financial advisers still suggest the
strategy, using investments that don't pay out earnings until
after the kids turn 14, when they'll be taxed at their lower
rate of 15%.</p>
<p>In reality, however, the tax advantage may be of minimal
benefit. Say, for example, parents put $10,000 for their
child in Series EE Savings Bonds, which are free from state
taxes. Assuming a 7% yield, the value at maturity in 10 years
will be $18,221, after figuring taxes at the child's 15%
rate, says Jim Mulvaney, a tax manager at BDO Seidman, an
accounting firm in New York. Meanwhile, if the parents put
the same amount in a taxable investment yielding 9%, they'd
have $17,657 after 10 years, even taking into account federal
and state income taxes amounting to 35%. Mr. Mulvaney
suggests that parents consider AAA quality tax-exempt bonds.
At 7 1/8%, this couple would have $19,903.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are easier ways to save. "Ignore the
hype and choose an investment solely on its merits," says Mr.
Anderson of the Forum on College Financing. "Investing for
college is no different from investing for any other
long-term goal."</p>
<p>Investment advisers say investing for growth makes the
most sense if parents have a long-term horizon. Then, as the
child approaches college age, parents should shift gradually
into fixed-income or money-market accounts, they say.</p>
<p>One of the easiest ways for parents to save is by using
no-load mutual fund families, which enable parents to
allocate their money among growth, fixed income and other
types of funds. Many fund companies can arrange automatic
withdrawals from a parent's checking account, and a few,
including T. Rowe Price Associates, can arrange for automatic
payroll deductions.</p>
<p>Another way to save that most parents overlook is by using
their 401(k) retirement plans at work. Contributions reduce
their taxable income and grow tax-deferred, and they are
often matched by employers at least 50 cents on the dollar.
Parents can allocate their savings among growth stock funds,
or guaranteed investment contracts that pay a fixed rate that
is often comparable to certificates of deposit. "There's no
way you can duplicate those kinds of benefits," says
Frederick Rumack, director of taxation at Buck Consultants, a
benefits consulting firm in New York.</p>
<p>Parents often worry about tying up dollars they may need
for college. But many companies allow employees to borrow as
much as half of their 401(k) account balance, up to $50,000,
without taxes or penalties. Interest rates are low, says Mr.
Rumack, but parents will have to repay the money within five
years to keep the loan from being treated as a taxable
distribution.</p>
<p>Even if parents can't borrow from their accounts, some
advisers recommend that they contribute as much as they can
anyway when children are younger. Then, while the child is in
college, they should quit funding the accounts and instead
use the money to pay for tuition.</p>
<p>Another strategy to consider is prepaying a home mortgage.
By prepaying an additional $200 a month on a $100,000,
30-year 11% fixed-rate mortgage, parents of a three year-old
can pay off a loan in 15 years, and save $142,391 in
interest.</p>
<p>"Meanwhile, the equity in their home has grown
tax-deferred, and is available to be withdrawn via a
home-equity loan (the interest on) which is also tax
deductible," says Marc Eisenson, author of "The Banker's
Secret," a book that discusses such strategies. With the
mortgage paid off, parents could also redirect the money from
mortgage payments toward tuition.</p>
<p>The impact of this strategy on deductions for mortgage
interest is minimal. But if interest rates rise above the
rate one's paying, it won't make sense to prepay money that
could be earning a greater return, says Mr. Mulvaney of BDO
Seidman.</p>
