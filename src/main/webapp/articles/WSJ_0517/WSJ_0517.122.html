	<p class="article-leader">Westinghouse Electric Corp., Pittsburgh, said it formed a
partnership to develop robotic technology for use in the
nuclear-service and nuclear-waste markets.
   The company said its partners in the venture are Carnegie
Mellon University and RedZone Robotics Inc., both of
Pittsburgh. RedZone, which originated at Carnegie Mellon, is
a privately held robotics designer and fabricator.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the contract, the field robotics center at Carnegie
Mellon will perform basic research and RedZone will develop
concepts to the application stage. The partnership won't be
capitalized, officials at Carnegie Mellon and RedZone said.
But Carnegie Mellon will maintain a financial interest in the
technologies developed at the university.</p>
<p>In addition to its interests in waste management,
Westinghouse is a defense electronics, electrical equipment
distribution, broadcasting and financial services concern.</p>
