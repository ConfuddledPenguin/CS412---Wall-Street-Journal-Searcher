	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- As the impressionist art market shows signs of
cooling from its torrid pace of appreciation, another sector
of the art market may be taking off.
   Sotheby's Holdings Inc. held a well-received sale here
last night of the art collection of Lydia Winston Malbin,
which consisted mostly of Italian futurist paintings.
Moreover, the auction house had its own money on the line.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sotheby's had estimated that the artworks for sale would
fetch $56.5 million to $74.8 million. The final total for the
91 artworks sold was $74.3 million, with many of the lots
selling above their highest presale estimate.</p>
<p>While the sale was technically not part of the spring
series of impressionist and modern art auctions that sets the
tone for the overall art market, it was notable because
Sotheby's had gone out on a limb to guarantee the entire
collection.</p>
<p>Sotheby's declined to disclose the amount of its
guarantee, but dealers reportedly put the figure at upward of
$70 million. That includes the artworks sold last night and a
handful of others, notably a Claude Monet painting estimated
at $6 million, which are up for bid at separate Sotheby's
auctions.</p>
<p>Bidding was active and broad-based from a variety of
mostly European dealers and collectors. Buyers said demand
was brisk because futurist works rarely come up for auction.</p>
<p>Under a guarantee arrangement, the estate receives the
amount of the guarantee, regardless of what the bids for the
artworks total, essentially making Sotheby's, not the estate,
the primary seller. Guarantees have been much criticized
because of the conflict-of-interest questions they raise, but
they have grown increasingly common as competition for
collections has intensified among the three fine-art auction
houses here, Sotheby's, Christie's International PLC and
Habsburg, Feldman Inc.</p>
<p>At the Sotheby's sale, among the top-selling artworks was
Piet Mondrian's "Composition in Black and White with Blue
Square." The stark geometric canvas sold for $6.8 million. It
had been estimated to sell for between $5 million to $7
million. Overall the handful of impressionist and modern
paintings in the Malbin collection, such as paintings by
Matisse and Miro, sold within their estimates.</p>
<p>Sotheby's stock, which is traded on the New York Stock
Exchange, closed $1.25 higher at $18.625 yesterday. The stock
rose primarily on news of the stunning, world-record price
set for a Vincent van Gogh at Christie's Tuesday evening.
Kobayashi Gallery of Tokyo paid $82.5 million for "Portrait
of Dr. Gachet," almost double the previous record for an
artwork. Christie's stock also rallied in London Stock
Exchange trading, closing at #3.37 ($5.66), up 10 pence.</p>
<p>At Tuesday night's impressionist painting sale at
Christie's, the total for the artworks came to about $269
million, in the midrange of the company's published presale
expectations. Overall, 24 of the 81 works Christie's
auctioned didn't sell, and of those that did, 31% sold below
their presale price estimates. Moreover at a daytime sale of
second-tier and less-expensive impressionist art yesterday,
Christie's reported that one-fourth of the artworks were
unsold.</p>
<p>On balance, the results weren't as impressive as those
reached in recent years, showing a slowing in the rate of
appreciation for impressionist art, but they were better than
the doleful returns fetched for contemporary art at Sotheby's
and Christie's last week.</p>
<p>Christopher Burge, president of Christie's America, noted
that, while some pieces sold below estimates on Tuesday,
"they sold," and the numbers represented a "solidifying of
the market."</p>
<p>The sales so far have been a prelude to Sotheby's huge
auction of impressionist and modern paintings tonight. The
centerpiece of that sale is Pierre-Auguste Renoir's "Au
Moulin de la Galette," an ebullient, colorful depiction of a
Parisian dance hall. The estimate for the painting is $40
million to $50 million, but given the price fetched by the
more somber van Gogh, some dealers are now expecting it to
break the world record. Reportedly, the well-endowed Getty
Museum of Los Angeles is expected to be among the bidders.</p>
