	<p class="article-leader">Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. of Japan, which makes Subaru
autos, aircraft and other machinery, said its unconsolidated
pretax profit for the year ended March 31 tumbled 52% to 6.65
billion yen ($44.1 million) from 13.86 billion yen a year
earlier, citing surging material costs and higher
administrative and general expenses.
   Operating losses totaled 29.63 billion yen, compared with
fiscal 1989 operating profit of 2.68 billion yen. Income from
dividend and interest payments helped offset pretax losses,
but special losses erased extraordinary gains from sales of
capital assets. Thus, net income fell 47% to 5.74 billion
yen, or 9.85 yen a share, from 10.89 billion yen, or 19.81
yen a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales eased 0.8% to 658.02 billion yen from 663.44 billion
yen. Exports contributed 268.65 billion yen to sales. The
auto category, Fuji's biggest business, was the only area of
decline, substantial enough to obliterate gains in all other
sectors. Sales of autos, including exports and domestic
sales, fell 2.7% to 524.4 billion yen.</p>
<p>Fuji intends to cut the annual dividend to six yen a
share, including a 0.5 yen special payout already paid, from
eight yen.</p>
