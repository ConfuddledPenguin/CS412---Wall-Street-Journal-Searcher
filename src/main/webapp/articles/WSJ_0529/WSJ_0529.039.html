	<h3>Summer Electric Capacity Seen Meeting Demand, but Some Brownouts Predicted</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">Residents of the nation's capital should hope that the
only hot air they get next month is the political kind.
   The North American Electric Reliability Council predicted
that, because of the temporary outage of a big power plant,
hotter-than-normal weather in June may necessitate voltage
reductions, also known as brownouts, in the
Washington-Baltimore area.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While generally imperceptible, voltage reductions force
machines to work harder, making them more trouble-prone.
Moreover, a utility doesn't trim its output until after it
has publicly appealed to its customers to voluntarily turn
off air conditioners and other electrical appliances.</p>
<p>Otherwise, said the utility industry's Princeton,
N.J.-based forecasting unit, there should generally be enough
electrical capacity to meet this summer's peak demands. It
added, however, that under certain circumstances -- very hot
weather and unexpected plant outages -- the Southeast and
Mid-Atlantic regions could have problems. It further said
that Midwest utilities may be forced to trim sales to other
regions if an unexpectedly high number of power plants go
down.</p>
<p>Two private power-supply forecasters offered somewhat
different assessments. In Lexington, Mass., Larry Mackovich,
director of electricity services for McGraw-Hill Co.'s DRI
Energy unit, said the only area where problems might occur
this summer is the Mid-Atlantic region, specifically,
Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland.</p>
<p>Noting that utilities in that region are operating with
only about a 13% reserve margin -- 17% to 20% is preferred --
Mr. Mackovich said there is a 50% chance of voltage
reductions, and a 10% to 15% chance of rolling blackouts,
during the first half of August, but only if the weather is
hot and if there are unexpected plant outages.</p>
<p>Rolling blackouts occur when one section after another of
a utility's service territory is blacked out by the utility,
generally for a few hours at a time. Utilities employ the
tactic only after brownouts have failed.</p>
<p>In New York, Marie Corio, president of Applied Economic
Research Co., said the greater problem is in Virginia and
North and South Carolina. Ms. Corio explained that a number
of plants in that region aren't expected to be available this
summer. Thus, she said, if the weather's hot, there's a 50%
chance of brownouts and a 10% or so chance of rolling
blackouts in Virginia and the Carolinas in July and August.</p>
<p>Ms. Corio agreed with Mr. Mackovich's assessment of
Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland. She further agreed
with the Council that Midwest utilities might have to trim
their "off-system" sales; Mr. Mackovich doubted that would
happen. Both said they didn't know enough about the
Baltimore-Washington situation to comment.</p>
