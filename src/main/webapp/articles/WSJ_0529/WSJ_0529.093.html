	<p class="article-leader">SEATTLE -- Boeing Co. confirmed that it received firm
orders valued at $1 billion for 16 757 jetliners from Spain's
Iberia Airlines.
   The order also includes options Iberia secured on 12 more
of the jetliners plus spare parts and training. Engine
selection will be made at a later date, Boeing said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The order, disclosed by Iberia in Madrid last Friday,
calls for the airplanes to be outfitted for 188 passengers,
86 in business class and 102 in tourist. Iberia said the
jetliners will be delivered starting in 1993 through the
third quarter of 1994.</p>
<p>Iberia, which is controlled by Spain's National Industrial
Institute, has said it is in the midst of renovating much of
its fleet, which consists of 84 aircraft ranging from
McDonnell Douglas DC-9s to widebody Boeing 747s.</p>
<p>The airline's new Boeing airplanes will replace some of
its 35 Boeing 727 aircraft, Iberia said. They will be used
primarily on its route network to European, African and
Middle Eastern destinations.</p>
<p>Last year, Iberia ordered eight airbus A-340 airplanes and
took options on four others, as well as 17 McDonnell Douglas
MD-87 aircraft, at a combined cost of $1.1 billion. Iberia
has said it expects to replace its entire fleet by 2000.</p>
<p>Seattle-based Boeing said that Iberia's order for 16 of
its 757s brings to 648 the number of 757s ordered by 33
customers including Iberia. The aerospace concern said that
so far this year, it has had orders for 154 of the aircraft
valued at about $12.4 billion.</p>
