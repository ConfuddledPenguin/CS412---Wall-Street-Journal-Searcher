	<p class="article-leader">WEAK HIRING seems likely in second half. But bright spots
persist.
   International Business Machines Corp. plans to cut 10,000
U.S. jobs this year. Still, it looks for programmers,
engineers and holders of advanced degrees. Union Pacific
Corp. wants to bargain reductions in unionized rail crews.
But it anticipates adding 400 to 600 truck drivers, 100
professionals for a new telemarketing center and 30 oil and
gas workers. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. calls its hiring
plan "conservative." Yet it can't recruit enough engineers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>U.S. Homes Corp. says "all we're doing is replacing people
lost to attrition." Eastern Co. expects little change.
Stevens Graphics, though, wants to add 25 to 50 new workers
in the second half to increase marketing efforts in Western
Europe and the Eastern bloc. And Pier 1 Imports says its
employment has jumped to 9,000 workers from 7,800 a year ago,
and it expects to add 15 employees for each new store it
opens every 4 1/2 days.</p>
<p>Apple Bank is "in a replacement mode" but it has trouble
finding qualified workers for entry-level jobs.</p>
<p>LABOR SHORTAGE grows more worrisome in Japan. Can you wait
five years?</p>
<p>Last year, for the first time in 14 years, the number of
job openings exceeded the number of job seekers in Japan, and
the imbalance is getting worse in 1990, says the Fuji
Economic Review. But Japan's bustling export trade isn't
responsible. The review lays the current worker shortage to a
strong increase in domestic demand in Japan.</p>
<p>It may take five years, but the shortage will ease, the
publication says. One reason for its optimism: "The Japanese
economy has grown about 5% annually for nearly three years.
This pace will not likely be maintained." And Japan, it says,
could recruit more males over 55 and females between the ages
of 25 and 44. Far fewer women of child-bearing age work in
Japan than in the U.S., it observes.</p>
<p>IN MIDDLE AGE, some still fantasize about what we'll do
when we grow up.</p>
<p>Most people between 35 and 54 continue to daydream about
their careers: to anticipate a job change, compensate for
something missing, or escape from day-to-day tedium. But
Judith Meyerowitz, in a doctoral dissertation at Columbia's
Teachers College, says something seems to happen at age 45.
We shift from daydreaming about our current jobs to
fantasizing about what we will do in the future.</p>
<p>The study -- based on interviews with 60 bankers, teachers
and university personnel -- finds we look for different
rewards as we grow older. In early career lives, men
particularly dream of control, pay and recognition. By 45,
these daydreams turn to personal expression, even aesthetics.
"Women, too, look inward as they grow older," Ms. Meyerowitz
says. "But as men enter late middle age they seem to
fantasize more about a less complex life while women talk
more about owning their own businesses as a way to assert
themselves."</p>
<p>Most fantasies are realistic. Still, one librarian dreams
of playing shortstop for the St. Louis Cardinals.</p>
<p>RATING THE BOSS: Only 36% of the workers surveyed by
consultant Hay Group from 1987 through 1989 thought their
companies were run well. But that's an improvement from the
30% who expressed such confidence in 1981-82.</p>
<p>STRESS RIDES one way. Three of four managers say stress at
work sometimes affects their home life, finds a study by
Dunhill Personnel System and Columbia Business School. But
only one in three managers brings stress from home to work.</p>
<p>REIMBURSEMENT ACCOUNTS grow. Consultant Foster Higgins
says 41% of all companies, up from 30% a year ago, let
workers set aside pretax dollars to pay for health and
dependent care. A further 22% are considering the benefit.</p>
<p>TRAINING WORKERS at colleges costs companies $2.9 billion
a year, the American Society for Training and Development
says. Total training expenditures come to $30 billion, of
which $9 billion goes to outside contractors, including the
schools.</p>
<p>WORKERS APLENTY are ready to mow lawns. But sprayers often
need a license.</p>
<p>In Southern California, immigrants from Mexico and Central
and South America assure an ample supply of hands for routine
lawn chores. But Green Scene in Tarzana, Calif., has a hard
time finding workers fluent enough in English to deal with
customers. To apply pesticides and herbicides, it needs
people with a high school education "who can read and
understand labels."</p>
<p>Atlanta firms, too, see no shortage of applicants for
$6-an-hour lawn-cutting jobs. But Alfred L. Simpson & Co.
says even $8 to $10 an hour isn't enough incentive for some
workers to handle chemicals. "A lot of people are afraid of
pesticides," it says. And Landscapes Inc. worries that lawn
labor is going to become a lot scarcer. "We're having to do a
much smarter job of hiring" to secure people who "are
prepared for their jobs and will stick with them."</p>
<p>Carey's Professional Turf in Des Moines says spring hires
often weary of the work by summer's heat.</p>
<p>THE CHECKOFF: One in two senior executives never takes
unsolicited calls and most see only 10% of their mail, says
Blue Chip Marketing Group. . . . "Additional time spent on
breaks at work apparently does raise earnings (i.e.,
productivity), but not to the same extent as does additional
time spent working," concludes a study by the National Bureau
of Economic Research.</p>
