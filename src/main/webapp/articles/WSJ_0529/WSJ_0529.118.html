	<h3>Heard on the Street: Merrill Stock May Just Be Bridge to Troubled Waters</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Merrill Lynch said it bit the bullet last year
when it took a $470 million pretax charge for layoffs and
other retrenchment. But there might be another bullet or two
on the way.
   Inside Merrill, executives are worried about a possible
credit crunch this summer at companies whose temporary
"bridge" loans Merrill has financed. There's a chance Merrill
will need additional reserves of $100 million to $200 million
to deal with soured bridge loans and other exposure to the
struggling market for high-yield, high-risk junk bonds.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As a result, Merrill's stock, tempting though its may seem
as it languishes below book value, may not be a happy hunting
ground for bargain hunters just yet.</p>
<p>A Merrill insider says the firm is "constantly looking
over {its} shoulder" at the bridge loans and "will take
reserves as necessary" if a borrower stops making interest
payments.</p>
<p>Until Merrill safely navigates out of its junk-bond
dilemma and shows that its cost-cutting plan has worked, the
firm's earnings potential is suspect, some analysts say.</p>
<p>"We don't see the commitment by management to really push
this company toward a competitive {earnings} return," says
James P. Hanbury of Wertheim Schroder, who maintains an
unenthusiastic "hold" rating on the stock. Earnings probably
won't improve without "an even more stringent cost-reduction
program" and "another big write-off."</p>
<p>On Friday Merrill closed, in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading, at 24 3/4, off 1/4. The shares traded as
high as 36 3/4 early last year and 46 3/4 before the October
1987 stock-market crash.</p>
<p>Besides bridge loans, the major concern for investors is
whether Merrill's cost-cutting has been sufficient. Merrill
acknowledges that revenue in its capital markets segment --
including underwriting, trading and other non-brokerage
business lines -- has been less than expected this year. Some
analysts can't see any way to avoid more cost-slashing and
another charge, unless the firm's investment banking business
stages a miraculous recovery.</p>
<p>A Merrill spokesman says: "As of now, we are on target
with our restructuring program, and don't envision any
further charges or reserves relating to the restructuring."
But he adds: "We continuously reserve against possible
exposures of various kinds throughout the year." Last year's
big one-time charge gave Merrill its first yearly net loss as
a public company -- $213.4 million.</p>
<p>Merrill has a lot of exposure to markets that have been
weak, including stock-and-bond underwriting, merchant banking
and the junk bond market.</p>
<p>The company has $540 million tied up in five bridge loans,
which are used to finance takeovers, and $350 million in
junk-bond inventory. It now appears that Merrill is working
to refinance three of the five big bridges; it wants to
reduce its bridge exposure to about $200 million by the end
of the third quarter, if business conditions cooperate.</p>
<p>Merrill may have a tougher time getting the junk bonds off
its hands. Once hellbent on dethroning Drexel Burnham Lambert
as junk-bond king -- it briefly considered opening a junk
office near Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif., headquarters --
Merrill has, since Drexel's demise, been adamant about
reducing its financial commitment to junk. It wants to trim
whatever it can from its junk inventory by the third
quarter's end, and at the very least not add to it.</p>
<p>Although Merrill has been increasing its trading of junk
bonds and its manpower devoted to related areas such as
corporate restructurings, "I want to make it absolutely clear
-- we're not committing more dough to this market," a Merrill
insider says of the world of junk.</p>
<p>Merrill can't control what the junk market does. But it
has a bit more control over its own expenses. For two
consecutive years, Merrill has had to set aside money to pay
for layoffs, retreats from excess office space and the like.
If it takes another restructuring charge, it would be further
evidence of the severity of Wall Street's industrywide slump.
Yet some industry analysts say an additional charge is just
what Merrill needs.</p>
<p>People inside Merrill and several securities analysts say
they understand that since the fourth-quarter charge, revenue
isn't coming through as anticipated. Among other things,
investment banking revenue plunged 26.7% in the first
quarter, when Merrill had net income of $41.3 million mainly
because of a $27 million increase in money-management and
custodial fees. In 1988 Merrill made a $65.5 million pretax
provision for restructuring, and in 1989 it made the $470
million pretax provision ($395 million after tax).</p>
<p>That fourth-quarter charge covered rental losses related
to excess space at its World Financial Center headquarters in
lower Manhattan, as well as severance payments for layoffs
this year of at least 3,000 employees.</p>
<p>So why isn't Merrill's empire shrinking? At rival Shearson
Lehman Hutton, a cost-cutting drive has included the closing
of 67 of that firm's almost 520 U.S. branches. Merrill, in
contrast, has closed some branches but opened others, leaving
it with the same number as last year: 460.</p>
<p>Perrin Long, an analyst at Lipper Analytical Services,
says that "if things don't get better and better quickly,"
hundreds of millions of dollars in additional reserves or
charges will be required "to get the company whipped into
shape."</p>
<p>The timing of any charge is uncertain. Wertheim's Mr.
Hanbury says: "My guess is there will be one, but I don't
know when."</p>
<p>Lawrence Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache is another
brokerage analyst with a "hold" on Merrill. "I'd like to be
able to get enthusiastic about it, but there's not much to
get enthusiastic about," he says. "They're focused on the
cost side until revenues get stronger -- but my concern is
when revenues pick up that the commitment to cutting costs
goes out the window, which has been the pattern in past
years."</p>

<p>Index funds may soon double in size, the New York Stock
Exchange says.</p>
<p>In its annual report just off the presses, the Big Board
envisions tremendous growth in institutional investors' role
in the markets. Currently, there is about $250 billion in
index funds that buy long lists of stocks and futures in an
attempt to match the performance of major indexes such as the
Standard & Poor's 500. "Before the decade is half over,"
predicts the Big Board, "that sum is likely to reach $500
billion."</p>
<p>What about the little guy? The Big Board goes on to say a
"top priority" of the exchange for the 1990s will be
"encouraging participation by individual investors."</p>
