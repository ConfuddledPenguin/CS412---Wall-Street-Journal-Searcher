	<p class="article-leader">STOCKHOLM, Sweden -- The telecommunications industry's
leading technology symposium opened with fiber optic
communications and so-called intelligent computer networks
taking center stage.
   The triennial conference, last held in Phoenix, Ariz., in
1987, goes by the arcane name the International Switching
Symposium. It is a place for the industry's most prominent
scientists and developers to present their views on
leading-edge technologies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>ISS in the past has offered a window on where the
telecommunications industry is headed in terms of new voice
and data services for business and residential customers.
This year's presentations on optical switches and network
management systems seemed to presage a revolution in the
public phone network over the next three to 10 years.</p>
<p>These changes will enable companies to begin trading vast
amounts of information with other firms by using fiber optics
and the public network. Moreover, the presentation shows that
public phone companies have begun laying the groundwork for
better integrating of disparate communications technologies,
which include cellular radio and private data networks.</p>
<p>Many of the technologies discussed were in varying stages
of development at the time of the Phoenix meeting in 1987,
when the thrust of the technical presentations dealt with
so-called System VII common channel signaling networks that
helped route voice and data calls. Others dealt with
Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) technology for
sending voice and data calls simultaneously over the same
wire.</p>
<p>Since Phoenix, System VII networks have proliferated. In
fact, one of those networks figured prominently in the
software malfunction that felled American Telephone &
Telegraph Co.'s long-distance network last January. And ISDN
systems are now being used by numerous companies, such as
American Express Co., to increase the efficiency of their
workers, who can now talk on the phone and share computer
information on their personal computers without having to
make an expensive and time-consuming second call.</p>
<p>Some of this year's more noteworthy presentations include
those by scientists at AT&T, Japan's NEC Corp. and France's
Alcatel, who are presenting papers on optical computers that
switch voice and data calls using light beams from lasers
rather than electronic signals. Other industry giants, such
as Northern Telecom Ltd. of Canada; Ericsson of Sweden;
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. of Japan, and British
Telecom plan presentations on high-capacity or broad-band
transmission using fiber optic networks and the methods for
managing such traffic.</p>
<p>Systems management is becoming more critical because
companies will eventually transmit their data through the
public network at the rate of trillions of bits of
information per second, compared with the millions and in
some cases billions of bits today.</p>
<p>"In the future, the public networks will have to provide
whatever transmission {pipeline} is needed by a customer and
make it as accessible as dialing a simple voice call," said
Desmond Hudson, president of Northern Telecom World Trade.</p>
<p>Another focus is so-called Intelligent Networks of
computers that will someday enable phone companies to allow
third-party suppliers, such as software companies, to send
their programs to customers on a dial-up basis. Bell
Communications Research Inc., the laboratory owned by the
seven Bell regionals, and telecommunications authorities from
West Germany, France and Italy are among the presenters in
this category.</p>
<p>Attendance at this year's ISS underscores the
globalization of the telecommunications industry, with 84
countries sending scientific representatives, compared with
48 countries three years ago.</p>
