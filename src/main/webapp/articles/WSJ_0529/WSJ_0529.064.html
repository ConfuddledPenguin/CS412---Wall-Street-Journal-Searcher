	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- The troubled British economy faces double-digit
inflation, downward pressure on the pound and slackened
capital investment, according to the latest economic bulletin
by the Bank of England.
   But the central bank's report carried a glimmer of
optimism: British companies are managing to increase exports
to countries such as West Germany, where economic conditions
are more robust. That finding dovetails a suprisingly
sanguine report by Salomon Brothers, which predicted a boom
in U.K. manufacturing exports during the 1990s.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The British inflation virus is currently the worst of any
major industrial country. But the Bank of England warned that
tight labor markets in the U.S. and Japan, along with skill
shortages in Europe, harbinger more inflation in those
regions.</p>
<p>German unification threatens further international
inflation, according to the Bank of England, which cited
higher consumer demand from East Germans, along with added
spending by the West German government. In addition, the bank
report argued that the West German trade surplus probably
will decline as West German industry shifts its focus from
export markets to shoring up the collapsing East German
economy. That could lead to higher German interest rates.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the worrisome inflationary trends,
economic activity in continental Europe should bring a surge
in exports for Britain's steel, aerospace and auto
industries, according to Salomon Brothers' equity strategist
Michael Howell.</p>
<p>Overall, Mr. Howell predicted a reversal of the economic
patterns that prevailed in the 1980s, when the U.K.
manufacturing sector shrunk and the service sector expanded.
In the 1990s, he said, British advertisers, real estate
brokers and leisure companies will suffer while manufacturers
rebound.</p>
<p>Already, the Salomon report said, U.K. manufacturing
exports are running 20% higher than in 1988. Salomon
predicted 15%-20% growth in each of the next two years.
Assuming such growth, Mr. Howell said it's "increasingly
realistic" to consider Britain "the Hong Kong of Europe" in
the new decade.</p>
<p>The Bank of England wasn't that optimistic, but it
forecast that export growth will "remain strong" despite
sluggishness elsewhere in the British economy.</p>
<p>Salomon predicted that British Aerospace PLC, Dowty Group
PLC and BBA Group PLC should all gain from increased demand
for aerospace engines and equipment. Increased demand for
cellular radios and telephones should boost sales for Racal
Electronics PLC, Salomon said. Meanwhile, Eurotunnel PLC,
after weathering a succession of cost overruns and slowdowns,
can expect profits to roll in after 1996, according to the
report.</p>
