	<p class="article-leader">TOMS RIVER, N.J. -- Statewide Bancorp. said it increased
its allowance for loan losses by $30 million, omitted its
cash dividend and agreed to a close review of its main
subsidiary bank.
   The loan-loss provision rose to $50 million from $20
million at March 31, as some real estate loans continued to
deteriorate and the New Jersey real estate market remained
uncertain, the bank said. One of its loan participations had
been criticized by the Comptroller of the Currency, the
principal regulator of both of Statewide's subsidiaries.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Statewide, which has about $2 billion in assets, said it
believes the new provision is adequate, but it didn't rule
out further increases. "We can't hold out to people that it
definitely won't get worse," said Charles Sanders, the bank's
secretary.</p>
<p>Statewide said the suspension of its quarterly cash
dividend, which was 20 cents a share, will take effect in the
second quarter and continue indefinitely. Douglas Johnson,
president and chief executive officer, said the bank's
previous dividend payments have amounted to about $8 million
a year.</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson said the suspension is intended to preserve
Statewide's "strong capital position," which he said is well
above regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>The review of Statewide's lead subsidiary, First National
Bank of Toms River, is the result of an agreement with the
Comptroller of the Currency. It covers the adequacy of
loan-loss provisions and requires the development of plans to
strengthen assets, ensure adequate capitalization, and
improve supervision of bad loans.</p>
