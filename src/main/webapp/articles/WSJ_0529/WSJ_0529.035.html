	<p class="article-leader">Victoria's Secret catalog, the one with the attractive
models wearing tiny little underthings that cost a fortune
per square inch, is surfacing in the most unlikely places.
   Like at Popkin & Stern, a large St. Louis law firm.
Attorney Jeff Michelman once asked his secretary to send a
local publisher a copy of Insight, a sober magazine of
politics and opinion, along with a note about an article on
free speech. Then he left the magazine on his desk. Big
mistake. Also on his desk lay a Victoria's Secret catalog,
which -- you guessed it -- the secretary mailed instead.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The puzzled publisher called Mr. Michelman to ask what,
exactly, was the relationship between lingerie and free
speech. "I went through the color spectrum from pale to red
and back to pale again," Mr. Michelman says.</p>
<p>Which doesn't explain, of course, what a Victoria's Secret
catalog was doing on Mr. Michelman's mahogany desk to begin
with. But that's the point: The glossy catalog of see-through
lace camisoles, floral garter belts and sheer teddies now can
be found in boardrooms as well as bedrooms, on desk tops as
well as coffee tables -- and in Richard Emory's briefcase.
Says Mr. Emory, a St. Louis real-estate investor: "It takes
the edge off an otherwise difficult day. It's sort of like a
martini on paper."</p>
<p>As a result, the controversial catalog that pioneered sexy
underwear as fashion has become one of the fastest growing
mail-order businesses. It now offers a lot more than garter
belts, G-strings and sexy poses, but it's clear what makes a
lot of people pick it up. "I usually browse through it right
when I open the mailbox, and leave the bills," says Thomas
Buell of Dallas. And he's an actuary.</p>
<p>You can find Mr. Buell's catalog on the coffee table along
with his sports magazines. But to him, it's more than just a
display piece. Last year, Mr. Buell ordered a pair of silk
boxer shorts with geese and ducks for $40. With his willpower
weakened, he then visited a Victoria's Secret store and
bought $300 more worth of briefs. After all, the paisley went
with his sheets and comforter. "It's going to take me a year
to pay off my underwear," he says glumly.</p>
<p>The company, which is a division of Limited Inc., won't
disclose numbers, but it says sales and earnings doubled last
year. Analysts estimate sales have increased to $120 million
from under $30 million four years ago. As anyone who's on the
mailing list can attest, there seems to be a new catalog
every week -- actually there are about 15 a year -- but the
company won't say how many millions are delivered.</p>
<p>Among the catalogs for popcorn, hunting gear, chocolate
and thimbles, it's easy to see why Victoria's Secret stands
out. "When you get Lands' End, what are you going to do,
fantasize that you're fishing?" asks Victoria Brown, a Wall
Street analyst and portfolio manager.</p>
<p>To hear the company talk about it, the catalog has
liberated generations of repressed pajama wearers. "It's been
a process of educating the entire population that lingerie
can be fun, sensuous, fashionable, and that it doesn't have
to be purely functional," says Cynthia Fedus, president of
Victoria's Secret Catalogue. "We're selling hope."</p>
<p>The company also has 500 stores, all in the U.S. Two
hundred have opened in the past two years, and another 75 are
scheduled for this year. But the catalog, which operates
independent of the stores, is still critical, and Gregg Young
can tell you one reason why. Mr. Young once went into a
Victoria's Secret store to buy some underwear for his
girlfriend. He nervously selected a pair of black satin
panties. Then, unfortunately, he was forced to follow the
saleswoman around the store while she looked for the matching
garter belt and bra.</p>
<p>"I was the only guy in the store," says Mr. Young, who
swears the search for the garter belt took more than 30
minutes. "I almost fainted."</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Young shops in the catalog -- so far, spending
about $800 on frilly garments.</p>
<p>Women still account for most sales, but the company is
plying more and more men, including those on Wall Street.
Limited makes sure analysts are kept up to date on the latest
frills. When company executives brief analysts, "the first
thing they do is ask if we want to see the new catalog," says
Barry Bryant, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities. He
in turn stocks up on back issues in a file discreetly labeled
"Limited Miscellaneous." Mr. Bryant explains: "I use them as
an inducement for traders and salesmen to come into my
office."</p>
<p>It took a while for the catalog to gain such a mainstream
following. Founded in 1977 in San Francisco, the business was
initially several low-brow lingerie stores and a tacky
mail-order catalog. The name poked fun at the Victorians'
outward prudishness.</p>
<p>Leslie Wexner, Limited's chairman, bought the business in
1982 in a stock transaction valued at $1 million. The stores
were remodeled into potpourri-scented boutiques, with
spaghetti straps perfectly aligned and panties always
plumped.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the catalog limped along. It had more flesh
than fabric, picturing near-naked men and women groping for
each other in tawdry bedroom scenes. The publication
generated a storm of angry letters and calls.</p>
<p>So the book was overhauled two years ago. To damp its
prurient reputation and appeal to a wider audience, the
catalog has been given a mannered, aristocratic look and is
filled with British affectations. The catalog price is listed
in pounds (two) as well as dollars (three), although it's
usually mailed for free. The word "pajamas" is spelled
"pyjamas," and men in boxer shorts read the Financial Times.
If you call the 800 number to place an order, the voice on
the answering machine speaks with a British accent.</p>
<p>The catalog also tries to entice with some breathless
text. "Victoria's Secret satin and lace lingerie sets evening
alight. . . . Beginning the day with beautiful, unusual
lingerie can change her entire outlook."</p>
<p>The catalog's sexy sleepwear and underwear ("a rich design
of peacock satin with black lace overlay creates the beauty
of the demi-bra and bikini") constitutes about half the
publication. There's a growing line of sportswear and evening
wear, and last year the company added toiletries, fragrances
and the boxer shorts. Men and women are no longer
photographed together. Complaints have slowed down.</p>
<p>But they haven't stopped. Critics assert that dressing up
models in skimpy lingerie, amid the accouterments of a
luxurious boudoir, is simply exploitation with the veneer of
Victorian respectability.</p>
<p>"Women are posed in postures of submission, and they're on
display," says Norma Ramos, general counsel for Women Against
Pornography, a New York-based advocacy group. Ms. Ramos says
the catalog is similar to ads for blue jeans, cars and other
products that use women's bodies to sell products. "Women get
the message that they should be sexually available," she
says.</p>
<p>The company disputes that, but acknowledges that it does
strive to shock. "We've always had a certain segment of the
population that find both the store and the catalog
offensive," says Howard Gross, chief executive officer and
president of Victoria's Secret Stores. "But to be honest, if
we don't get some complaints we feel we aren't doing our
job."</p>
<p>Despite the controversy, the catalog and the stores have
influenced how lingerie is marketed. Department stores used
to primarily sell low-margin "foundations" (bras and
girdles), and Frederick's of Hollywood offered naughty
nightwear.</p>
<p>Today, big stores like Bloomingdale's run full-page
underwear ads of women in seductive poses and offer a richer
variety of frilly sleepwear. Frederick's, meanwhile, has
become more conservative, and its catalog is now a
less-upscale version of Victoria's Secret.</p>
<p>Says Richard Grunsten, president of GSP Marketing Service
in Chicago, which produces catalogs: "Victoria's Secret
legitimized lingerie as something that's not kinky, but
something that's legitimate apparel."</p>
<p>Well, maybe. A high-school theology teacher in Houston and
her husband, a prominent lawyer, hide their catalog when
guests arrive, and leave the National Geographic and Parent
magazines on the coffee table. The teacher asks -- insists,
actually -- that she not be identified. "If you're doing a
story on the Smithsonian magazine, you can use my name," she
says, "but not about this."</p>
