	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Most of Japan's six major steel companies Friday
reported record pretax earnings in fiscal 1989 ended on March
31, 1990, owing to strong domestic demand.
   Only NKK Corp., the second largest manufacturer, showed a
pretax earnings decline. NKK's pretax earnings declined 19%,
mostly as a result of a change in the way the company
measures depreciation costs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The others -- Nippon Steel Corp., Kobe Steel Ltd.,
Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd., Kawasaki Steel Corp., and
Nisshin Steel Co., reported healthy pretax profit growth,
though Sumitomo's net income declined, as did NKK's.</p>
<p>Nippon Steel, Sumitomo Metal Industries and Kawasaki Steel
decided to increase their dividends for the year.</p>
<p>Company officials said vigorous demand from such major
domestic steel users as construction companies, auto makers
and machinery manufacturers helped buoy sales and profit,
though recovering export prices also made contributions.</p>
<p>"This was the best year we have ever had," an official at
Nippon Steel said. "Domestic demand was very strong because
of economic growth and that accounted for most of the gains."</p>
<p>"Things were very good, overall," an official at Kobe
Steel agreed. "Exports to some countries like China were
sluggish, but domestic demand more than made up for the
drop."</p>
<p>The brisk earnings gains in the latest reporting year for
most companies presented a stark contrast with their
performance only a few years back when, battered by the yen's
sharp upturn and by the growing inroads into the world market
by other Asian countries like South Korea and Taiwan, they
suffered serious setbacks. In an attempt to tide over the
trouble, the steel companies laid off workers and branched
into new areas of business.</p>
<p>Nippon Steel's pretax earnings climbed 26% to 202.34
billion yen ($1.34 billion) from 160.361 billion yen. Net
income showed a 55% upsurge, going up to 97.054 billion yen,
or 14.09 yen a share, from 62.728 billion yen, or 9.45 yen a
share.</p>
<p>Sales were 2.573 trillion yen, up 7.9% from 2.385 trillion
yen.</p>
<p>Nippon Steel, encouraged by its performance, decided to
raise the dividend for the year to six yen from five yen in
the previous fiscal year.</p>
<p>Nippon Steel's strong performance came despite an 83% jump
in extraordinary losses, a result of investment under its
medium-range program to improve production efficiency and
streamline operations.</p>
<p>The company, however, posted extraordinary gains of 6.128
billion yen, though it had no such profit in fiscal 1988.</p>
<p>Steel sales increased 4.8% to 2.242 trillion yen, while
the engineering division showed a 35% jump with sales at
259.400 billion yen.</p>
<p>Exports dipped 3.7% to 600.001 billion yen. Officials at
Nippon Steel, as did those at other companies, said shipments
to China registered a conspicuous drop as that country pushed
an economic adjustment program.</p>
<p>NKK's pretax earnings were 82.081 billion yen, in contrast
with 101.058 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. Net
income fell 27% to 30.847 billion yen, or 8.75 yen a share,
from 42.013 billion yen, or 13.17 yen a share.</p>
<p>Sales showed a modest 1.3% gain, inching to 1.277 trillion
yen from 1.261 trillion yen.</p>
