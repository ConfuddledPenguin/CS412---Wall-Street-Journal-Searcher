	<p class="article-leader">Mondadori S.p.A., Italy's largest publishing concern, said
1989 net income plunged 48% to 54 billion lire ($4.4 million)
from 103.5 billion lire a year earlier.
   Directors proposed reducing dividends to 180 lire an
ordinary share from 380 lire, and to 200 lire each for
preferred and savings shares from 400 lire.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mondadori blamed the earnings drop on costs stemming from
last year's acquisition of L'Editoriale Espresso S.p.A., a
Rome-based publisher. Revenue jumped to 2.367 trillion lire
in 1989 from 1.495 trillion lire in 1988. Excluding special
items, profit fell 31% to 138.3 billion lire. Debt totaled
372.5 billion lire at the end of 1989, compared with net
liquidity of 220 billion lire a year earlier. The parent's
profit fell to 73.9 billion lire from 78.4 lire and sales
rose to 1.106 trillion lire from 1.091 trillion lire.</p>
<p>Mondadori is at the center of a conflict between the media
magnate Silvio Berlusconi, who was named chairman in January,
and the financier Carlo De Benedetti, who lost control of
Mondadori in December; the two sides are in talks on a
compromise that may break up the company.</p>
