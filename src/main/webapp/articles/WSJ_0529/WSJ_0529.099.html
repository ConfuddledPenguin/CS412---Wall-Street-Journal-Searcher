	<p class="article-leader">Degussa AG said its group, or world-wide, pretax profit in
the first half of the year ending Sept. 30 slid 13%.
   In the six months, ended in March, pretax profit fell to
159 million marks ($94.5 million) from 183 million marks a
year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Frankfurt-based chemical company's earnings fell
despite a modest 3.1% gain in world-wide sales to 7.09
billion marks from 6.88 billion marks.</p>
<p>Overall earnings were dragged down by the chemical sector,
where despite a 6% rise in sales to 2.35 billion marks,
earnings fell by an unspecified margin. Degussa explained
that profit margins were tightened by foreign exchange
factors.</p>
<p>In its other sectors, Degussa registered both sales and
earnings gains. The pharmaceutical division "posted good
results," the company said, citing a slight, though
unspecified, profit gain.</p>
<p>Degussa said it is still negotiating the takeover of
U.S.-based Engelhard Corp.'s world-wide gold and silver
operations. A letter of intent was signed in March.</p>
