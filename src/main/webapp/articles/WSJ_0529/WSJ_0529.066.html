	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Argentina, striving to repair relations with
its foreign creditors, has revived a $1.4 billion loan
agreement with the International Monetary Fund and will begin
negotiations Thursday on resuming payments to its main
commercial bank creditors.
   Late Friday, the IMF's executive board cleared a $240
million loan to Argentina, after the board had approved
revised targets for an economic program originally agreed to
in November 1989. Argentina can draw the $240 million
immediately; it previously had drawn another $240 million of
the $1.4 billion credit. The IMF had held up further
disbursements until Argentina had set revised targets for
such important economic indicators as inflation and the size
of the government deficit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Latin American country has succeeded in reviving its
agreement with the IMF after two months of much-improved
management under Economy Minister Erman Gonzalez. Inflation
has moderated, and the government even seems to be balancing
its budget.</p>
<p>The renewed IMF agreement will, for the first time, allow
Argentina to set aside 25% of what remains of the $1.4
billion credit to allow it to pursue plans to reduce its bank
debt. Faced with a total of about $60 billion of foreign debt
-- with more than half of that owed to commercial banks,
Argentine officials are eager to try such strategies.</p>
<p>Argentina's leading commercial bank creditors struggled
hard -- but failed -- to ensure that the country made an
interest payment to them before it could restore its
relations with the IMF. They also had hoped to extract an
interest payment from the Argentines as the price of resuming
talks on Argentina's approximately $30.5 billion of medium-
and long-term foreign bank debt. But that strategy also
didn't succeed.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the banks remain hopeful that they will
receive a payment around the time the talks start in New
York. "I think that they'll make a payment when we start
talking," said a senior U.S. banker. Argentina is as much as
$6 billion in arrears on interest payments to banks, having
not paid interest to them for as much as two years. It is
struggling to restructure its economy, and is reluctant to
make payments to banks from its estimated $1 billion of
foreign-exchange reserves.</p>
<p>In a statement released in New York, William Rhodes, the
Citicorp executive who heads the 13-bank committee that
negotiates with Argentina, and Javier Gonzalez Fraga, the
vice president of the Argentine central bank, said they had
agreed to resume negotiations. Mr. Rhodes said they will
discuss "the resumption of a regular flow of payments by
Argentina to commercial bank creditors" on the country's
medium-term and long-term public-sector debt.</p>
<p>Argentina's progress with its foreign creditors contrasts
with Brazil, which has yet to reach agreement with the IMF
and reopen talks with foreign bank creditors. Brazil, which
now has interest payment arrears to its commercial banks that
amount to about $5 billion, seems to be preoccupied with
trying to improve the enactment of its economic plan.</p>
<p>Its economy minister, Zelia Cardoso de Mello, visited
senior bankers in New York recently. They seemed
disappointed. "She's not doing much in the way of listening,"
said one. With reserves of as much as $8 billion, the bankers
reckon that Brazil could start to clean up its payments
arrears before they become unmanageably large.</p>
