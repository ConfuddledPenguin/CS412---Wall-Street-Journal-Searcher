	<p class="article-leader">INDIANAPOLIS -- Race car driver Tony Bettenhausen, the
subject of a Journal page one story on the finances of auto
racing, finished 26th at the Indianapolis 500.
   Mr. Bettenhausen's race car developed engine problems
early in the race Sunday, forcing him to retire after
completing 76 laps of the 200-lap race. Mr. Bettenhausen
expected to make a profit on the race only if he finished
seventh or better, but said after the race that he planned to
return to the Indy 500 next year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>His brother, Gary, finished 31st of 33 entries because of
problems with a wheel bearing. Only 15 cars were still
running at the end of the race, which was won by Arie
Luyendyk, a native of Sommelsdyk, the Netherlands, now living
in Scottsdale, Ariz.</p>
