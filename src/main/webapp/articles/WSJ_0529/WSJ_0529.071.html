	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- A company controlled by New Zealand financier
Sir Ronald Brierley said it now owns a 9.3% stake in Triton
Energy Corp. and may seek federal clearance to acquire 50% or
more of the energy concern.
   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Industrial
Equity (Pacific) Ltd. said it has clearance under federal
antitrust laws to acquire as much as 14.9% of Triton's common
shares outstanding.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>To get the most from its investment, Industrial Equity
also said it may seek to exercise a controlling influence
over Triton's affairs, pursue a seat on its board or make a
tender offer for some or all of Triton's shares.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Triton, which has extensive overseas oil
and gas holdings, said it is unsure of Industrial Equity's
intentions. The Hong Kong-based investment firm is a vehicle
for U.S. and British investments by Mr. Brierley.</p>
<p>"All we know is what has been on the financial wires," the
spokesman said. "They've previously held the stock for
long-term value. There have been rumors over the years of
takeover potential," but he said Mr. Brierley and the company
have developed a "close relationship."</p>
<p>In its filing, Industrial Equity said it believes current
trading prices for Triton shares fail to reflect the value of
the company's underlying business and assets. Triton's stock
price, which traded about $15 a share in March, had fallen to
below $11 recently. It jumped $1.125 Friday in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading to close at $11.625.</p>
<p>In recent months, Industrial Equity has tangled with
Cummins Engine Co. over shareholder rights issues and sought
clearance under antitrust laws to raise its stake in
Petroleum Helicopters Inc. to 25%.</p>
<p>Industrial Equity said it holds almost two million of
Triton's 21.2 million shares. That includes 1.3 million
shares bought between April 30 and May 22 at between $10.13
and $10.76 a share.</p>
<p>Triton has operations in France, Britain and the North
Sea. For the nine months ended Feb. 28, it had a net loss of
$19.6 million, after a $5.6 million write-down of assets, on
revenue of $192.5 million.</p>
