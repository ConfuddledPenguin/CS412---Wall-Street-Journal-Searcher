	<p class="article-leader">Continental Airlines said a federal appeals court ruled a
group of employees was entitled to back pay, but awarded them
less than $1 million, not the $40 million the workers had
sought.
   The Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans
ruled that the employees could get back pay only for the six
days between the time Continental filed for bankruptcy in
1983 and when the workers struck the carrier, the carrier
said. Continental, a unit of Texas Air Corp., filed for
bankruptcy protection Sept. 23, 1983, unilaterally abrogating
labor contracts and offering lower wages. The unions struck
the carrier Oct. 1. Continental emerged from Chapter 11
protection in 1986.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A group of 474 pilots and flight attendants claimed they
were owed several years of back pay, the amount they
contended they would have received if the bankruptcy court
hadn't approved the abrogation of their union contract. The
court of appeals agreed the employees were entitled to back
pay, but denied damages for the time they were on strike.</p>
<p>Continental said it was pleased with the ruling.
Representatives of the employees couldn't be reached.</p>
