	<p class="article-leader">HONG KONG -- Despite the Hong Kong economy's stagnation in
the first quarter, the government is maintaining its forecast
that gross domestic product will grow 3% in 1990, up from
1989's 2.5% expansion.
   Government economist Tang Kwong-yiu said that while Hong
Kong has registered three consecutive quarters of
"negligible" growth, the economy's underlying strength is
indicated by the persistently high level of capacity at which
local factories operate and the large number of job
vacancies.</p>
