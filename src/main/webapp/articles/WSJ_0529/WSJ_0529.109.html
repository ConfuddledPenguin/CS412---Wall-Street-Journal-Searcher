	<h3>Economy -- Tracking the Economy: Downdrafts in May Data Seen as Slight --- Jobs, Purchasing Reports Expected to Blow Breezy Rather Than Blustery</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Fresh May data promise to bring more economic
downdrafts through two favorite reports, employment data and
the purchasing managers' index, both to be released Friday.
   But economists said they expect more breeze than bluster
in the numbers. Overall civilian payrolls are expected to
rebound from April's poor showing -- payrolls actually shrank
after subtracting temporary census workers -- though factory
jobs are likely to fall again, all contributing to an
unchanged unemployment rate.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Meanwhile, the consensus view expects the purchasers'
index to fall below the pivotal 50% reading attained in
April, according to MMS International, a unit of McGraw-Hill
Inc., New York. The week's other offerings wrap up April
softness with weaker data expected from new home sales,
factory orders and construction spending.</p>
<p>After four months of eccentric behavior in employment
data, economists hope that the May numbers could return to
more normal patterns; that is, after accounting for the
lion's share of census workers in the one month. Even Janet
Norwood, federal commissioner of labor statistics,
acknowledged to Congress that unusually warm weather in
January and February boosted hiring, which, in turn, made
March and April look particularly weak.</p>
<p>Or, as Donald Fine, economist at Chase Manhattan Bank,
noted, "We've had two months of ridiculously strong growth
and two months of ridiculously slow growth." So, after four
months of "distortions," Mr. Fine hopes that the May number,
"if not yet the trend number, will be closer to a trend."</p>
<p>The consensus view expects overall, nonfarm payrolls --
excluding census workers -- to add about 127,000 jobs in May,
according to the MMS survey. In April, nonfarm payrolls grew
by 69,000 new workers. But excluding the government's hiring
of 79,000 temporary workers, the April number declined.
Economists estimate that census workers are expected to
account for more than 100,000 jobs in May.</p>
<p>No matter how the May jobs numbers are sliced, they look
weak to economists. Nonfarm payroll growth of 127,000 jobs,
while stronger than in March and April, is much softer than
during 1989, when growth averaged more than 225,000 jobs a
month. What's more, factory jobs are expected to decline in
May, as are positions in the services sector.</p>
<p>Brian Fabbri, chief economist at Midland Montagu
Economics, New York, pointed out that recent flooding in the
Southwest could cut employment data further. Mr. Fabbri
expects nonfarm payroll growth of 130,000 jobs in May. But he
said: "The flood could wipe my number right out. And it could
prevail over all the numbers that come out in May."</p>
<p>Still, economists seem able to fit these weaker numbers
into a slow-growth-but-no-recession outlook. Chase
Manhattan's Mr. Fine holds that the manufacturing sector has
"bottomed out." He expects real gross national product to
grow 1.5% or so in the months ahead. Midland Montagu's Mr.
Fabbri said he is "still in the 2% camp."</p>
<p>The MMS consensus expects that the National Association of
Purchasing Management index slipped to 49.7% in May, after
pushing above 50% in April for the first time in months. A
reading below 50% indicates a generally expanding
manufacturing economy, while one below 50% suggests a
declining economy.</p>
<p>Gary Ciminero, economist at Fleet/Norstar Financial Group
in Providence, R.I., said he expects the association index's
decline to "mark the resumption of the contraction in
manufacturing, which had been under way for 11 of the prior
12 months." Still, economists noted one month's move
shouldn't carry too much weight in the index, particularly if
it might be teetering on a new trend.</p>
<p>Often, the association index provides the first reading on
the new month. But this month, the May employment data will
precede the index by two hours on Friday. Most likely, the
jobs data will steal thunder from the index, though
economists didn't rule out the possibility of conflicting
signals from the two reports.</p>
<p>April's leading indicators' index, to be released
tomorrow, is expected to have declined 0.2%, following
March's jump. Once again, building permits are expected to
have dragged the index down. Other negative contributors are
likely to include contracts, and orders for plants and
equipment, as well as manufacturers' unfilled orders,
economists said.</p>
<p>Last week's report of a 4.1% drop in April durable goods
orders led economists to expect a falloff in overall factory
orders, data for which are to be posted Thursday. April
factory orders are expected to have declined about 2%,
following March's steep 3.8% gain, according to MMS.</p>
<p>All continues to look weak on the housing front. April new
home sales, the report on which is to be released tomorrow,
are expected to have dropped 1%, albeit much less than
March's sharp fall. The report on April construction
spending, scheduled for release Friday, also is expected to
show a 1% drop, according to MMS. In March, construction
outlays fell 1.4%, as the spending trend retraced gains
induced by warm weather earlier in the year.</p>
