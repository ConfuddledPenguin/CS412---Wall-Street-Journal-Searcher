	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- Geodyne Resources Inc. said it expects to
report that net income in its fourth quarter ended Feb. 28
fell to roughly $1 million, or about six cents a share, from
$1.6 million, or nine cents a share, a year earlier.
   Michael W. Tomasso, president and chief executive officer,
said that revenue declined to about $6 million from $6.3
million a year earlier. PaineWebber Inc., Geodyne's majority
shareholder, raises capital for Geodyne to acquire ownership
in domestic producing oil and natural gas wells on behalf of
investors. Geodyne receives interests in the producing
properties as well as a management fee from the investors for
managing and operating the properties.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Tomasso attributed the drop in revenue and earnings to
a decrease in property acquisitions for the period. Geodyne
bought about $18 million in properties during the quarter,
compared with about $30 million in the year-ago period. In
addition, Geodyne paid its first ever taxes in the quarter.
The company's pretax operating profit rose, Mr. Tomasso said.</p>
<p>Revenue and earnings are expected to continue upward on a
year-to-year basis, while quarter-to-quarter results will
fluctuate, largely dependent upon the number of acquisitions
made during a given quarter, Mr. Tomasso said.</p>
<p>For the full year, Geodyne expects to report net income of
about $5.8 million, down from $7.4 million a year earlier.
Pershare earnings are expected to be about 33 cents, compared
with 43 cents. Revenue is expected to climb about 27%, to
$25.7 million from $20.2 million.</p>
<p>Calling itself "risk adverse," Geodyne looks to acquire
properties in proven fields such as Oklahoma's Arkoma Basin
and the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma and Texas. And, "by
design," Mr. Tomasso said, Geodyne puts a lot of its eggs
into one basket -- natural gas. The company owns about 20
billion cubic feet of natural-gas reserves, about 70% of its
overall energy assets.</p>
<p>Geodyne, like many other energy concerns, anticipates
natural gas prices, currently depressed, will rise in coming
years. It says demand should rise, in part, because gas is a
more environmentally clean fuel than oil in many respects.</p>
<p>Geodyne thinks it can still acquire natural gas properties
at attractive prices ahead of the expected upturn. "We
consider natural gas underpriced," Mr. Tomasso said.</p>
<p>Geodyne's oil reserves total about 950,000 barrels. The
company expects its oil and natural gas reserves to increase
by the equivalent of about one million barrels of oil in
fiscal 1990, similar to increases in recent years.</p>
