	<p class="article-leader">BALTIMORE -- Allied Research Corp. named Reinald W. Carter
to the added post of chief executive officer, succeeding M.B.
Ruffin.
   Mr. Carter, 58 years old, has been president and chief
operating officer. Mr. Ruffin, 72 years old, plans to remain
chairman until December, and then become a consultant to the
company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Separately, the company reported a $2.1 million loss for
the third quarter on revenue of $8.4 million, and said it may
not return to profitability as it had predicted. The company
cited revisions to a contract at its Belgian subsidiary,
Mecar S.A., and a spokesman said the margins on the $9
million contract with an unnamed country haven't been as
large as the company anticipated.</p>
<p>The company said Allied Research, which designs and
develops high-technology products and weapons systems, "was
facing a variety of financial issues," but expected to
resolve them through more cost cutting and refinancing.</p>
