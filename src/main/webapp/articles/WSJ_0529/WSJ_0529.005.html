	<p class="article-leader">MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- It will be a long time before Sun
Microsystems Inc. again ignores the advice of Andreas
Bechtolsheim, its chief computer designer.
   Mr. Bechtolsheim, 34 years old, is a hero at Sun today
because he inspired its Sparcstation family of computers, on
the market for just a little more than a year and already
responsible for most of the company's business. Yet when Mr.
Bechtolsheim, a co-founder of Sun and the designer of its
earliest computers, first proposed to build the Sparcstation
in January 1987, Sun's senior executives looked askance at
the project. Miffed, Mr. Bechtolsheim came within a whisker
of quitting to launch his own company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sun is fortunate Mr. Bechtolsheim never left its fold.
"Andy saved Sun from a product standpoint," said David
Marquardt, a former member of Sun's board of directors.</p>
<p>Mr. Bechtolsheim's rebirth as a visionary at Sun after a
period in eclipse illustrates how the process of bringing new
computers to market is rife with conflict, pitting designers
against marketers. No other senior Sun executive shared Mr.
Bechtolsheim's sense of urgency that Sun must push ahead of
competitiors in desktop computing.</p>
<p>The West German native designed his first computer in 1980
while a graduate student at Stanford University. When he
couldn't sell the machine, a so-called workstation for
engineers and scientists, to a large computer maker, Mr.
Bechtolsheim founded Sun with software whiz Bill Joy and two
entrepreneurs, Vinod Khosla and Scott McNealy. Mr.
Bechtolsheim's machine was the company's first product.</p>
<p>Within a few years, Sun and Apollo Computer Inc. were
leaders of the computer industry's fastest growing segment,
and Digital Equipment Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co., two
behemoths, were hot on the upstarts' heels. By 1987, Sun had
outraced Apollo and blunted the attacks of its larger
competitors.</p>
<p>But Mr. Bechtolsheim saw a new threat to Sun's prosperity:
Steven Jobs, co-founder of Apple Computer Inc. After Mr. Jobs
left Apple in 1985, he formed Next Inc., vowing to build an
advanced desktop computer. At the time, Sun built computers
for individuals, but they were too large to rest on top of a
desk. Mr. Bechtolsheim urged Sun to build a powerful desktop
computer.</p>
<p>The clarion call was a classic move for Mr. Bechtolsheim,
who relishes his role as a gadfly within Sun. He is "always
in here telling me how I'm running the business wrong," says
Scott McNealy, Sun's chief executive officer.</p>
<p>Officially Sun's vice president of technology, Mr.
Bechtolsheim doesn't formally oversee any engineers, budgets
or projects. "I can just tell people what I think," he says.
"I don't have to worry about protecting my budget. I don't
have a budget."</p>
<p>Mr. Bechtolsheim, who held $26 million of Sun's stock when
the company first went public several years ago, sometimes
personally bankrolls his unofficial work at Sun. "One way
Andy gets action at Sun when the company won't back him is to
pay for it himself," says James J. Ludemann, a former Sun
engineer who worked on Sparcstation 1.</p>
<p>This was one of those times. He began work on the machine
without official company support, spending $200,000 of his
own money on an office and design help. "I felt if Sun wasn't
going to let me do it, I was going to do it on my own," he
says.</p>
<p>Soon afterward, Mr. Bechtolsheim distanced himself from
Sun, forming a new company called UniSun to bring his
computer to market. Mr. Khosla, then a member of Sun's board,
agreed to be its president. Finally, he offered Sun the right
to invest in the company and purchase it in the future.</p>
<p>Sun seriously considered both possibilities. But Mr.
McNealy, fearing that Mr. Bechtolsheim's new venture might be
viewed as a new competitor, agreed to build Sparcstation 1.</p>
<p>"Ultimately, we decided that if Sun couldn't do this
internally, we weren't worth our salt," says Curt Wozniak,
who was chosen to head a new division formed to house the
enterprise. In return, Mr. Bechtolsheim sold his fledgling
company to Sun for no gain.</p>
<p>But the battle over Mr. Bechtolsheim's computer wasn't
over. To start with, Sun placed restrictions on which of its
engineers could join Mr. Bechtolsheim; he was allowed to hire
only those who said they would otherwise resign. And in the
months that followed, Mr. Bechtolsheim saw many of his ideas
criticized. A perfectionist -- for months he asked
houseguests to sit on his living room floor because he
couldn't find a couch he liked -- Mr. Bechtolsheim
ferociously defended his positions.</p>
<p>For instance, when engineers on the project told him the
package containing the guts of Sparcstation 1 needed three
more millimeters in order to be manufactured, he refused to
widen it. "The company's culture was to build big boxes," he
says. "Mine wasn't going to be big." Finally Mr. Wozniak, the
division head, overruled Mr. Bechtolsheim. The three
millimeters were added.</p>
<p>In April 1989, Sun introduced Sparcstation 1, a blazingly
fast machine, for a barebones price of $9,000. It quickly
became Sun's biggest seller. Since then, two more models have
been introduced, with the latest, unveiled this month, priced
at below $5,000.</p>
<p>The Sparcstation family is now Sun's biggest seller. Sun
doesn't break out sales of the machines, but Vicki Brown, an
analyst at International Data Corp. said the company will
sell about 87,000 Sparcstations this year, comprising nearly
75% of its total unit sales of computers. Last year, Sun sold
35,000 Sparcstations, she said.</p>
<p>Now Mr. Bechtolsheim is working on future Sparcstations:
smaller, more powerful machines utilizing advances in
semiconductors and miniaturization of other parts. He won't
be specific about his work, but says: "Our future computers
will be credit cards that you plug into your keyboard."</p>
