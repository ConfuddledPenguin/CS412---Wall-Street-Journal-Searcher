	<p class="article-leader">History suggests that a liberal dose of skepticism is in
order about whether Washington's current budget negotiation
efforts will finally get us on a better fiscal path, but
there are some important points to keep in mind. The outcome
will have an important effect on the course of the economy
for years ahead.
   To be successful, the fiscal package must include actions
on both sides of the budget. It must be perceived by the
citizenry as fair. Finally, to make the trauma and travail of
this year's efforts worthwhile, some therapy needs to be
applied to the basic processes of budgetry.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It is important now for the federal budget to get some
real therapy. The reason is not that if we do not mend our
ways some sort of fiscal explosion or financial collapse will
occur. No such detonation has obviously occurred or is likely
to occur. Seeing a crisis as the problem is itself part of
the budget problem.</p>
<p>Policies do, however, have consequences. And the fiscal
policy we have been pursuing is producing some consequences
that suggest that we need changes. (It has also produced some
desirable consequences -- e.g., a little more reluctance to
vote large new spending programs.) Clearly the budget has
contributed to the deterioration in the dynamism of the U.S.
economy that has made its performance in recent years compare
unfavorably with that of our own history or of other
industrial nations. Turning this around and reviving the
economy's capability to deliver sustained gains in real
income is the major challenge facing managers of economic
policy -- and this includes both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.</p>
<p>In our pride about the increased number of jobs available
we tend to overlook the fact that most of our increased
output has come from more people working, and too little has
come from doing things better, from things that enlarge
output per person employed.</p>
<p>The result is that average weekly earnings in real terms
have been declining in recent years, and in the early months
of 1990 they had receded to about the level of 30 years ago.
If we had sustained rates of increase more in line with our
history, or with what has been happening in Europe and Asia,
today's average earnings from a week of work would be about
50% higher in real terms, and the president and the
congressional leaders would have the joy of negotiating a tax
reduction.</p>
<p>For years our investment has been low relative to that in
the rest of the industrial world. The rate of growth in the
amount of productive capital backing up each American worker
has itself declined, and on average it therefore represents
older technology. The inevitable result has been the
deterioration in the purchasing power of earnings from a
week's work.</p>
<p>The federal budget has made its contribution here. The
Treasury's large borrowing requirements plus private credit
needs outpaced domestic credit resources for most of the past
decade, with the imbalance becoming particularly severe by
the mid-1980s, and this has forced drawing on foreign
savings. This was no crisis and probably could continue, but
it produces consequences -- to repeat, adversely affecting
the economy's ability to deliver gains in real income. The
higher costs of capital had a deterrent effect on U.S.
capital formation. And the net flow of investment income from
abroad (equal to somewhat over 1% of gross national product a
decade ago) this year may be negative.</p>
<p>While there are differences between a sovereign
government's finances and those of a family or business or
city, there are parallels, and the consequences of living by
borrowing are on that list.</p>
<p>To get the nation on a better fiscal path, actions on both
sides of the budget will probably be required. In principle,
a tax system that already generates well over a trillion
dollars of revenue ought to be adequate to cover what could
be spent prudently. And there is a strong case for hanging
tough on new taxes, and forcing the nation to take a harder
line on spending.</p>
<p>The real cost of throwing more money at any interest group
that is loud enough is some combination of reduced
consumption for average Americans, reduced capability for the
economy to grow, and in many cases perverse and even adverse
effects on the very problems the programs were supposed to
solve. Developments in Eastern Europe as well as our own
experience here would suggest that we re-think our
inclination to deal with problems through programs based on
"the primacy of politically directed social planning." (The
phrase is from Zbigniew Brzezinski's excellent "The Grand
Failure.")</p>
<p>Probably, however, it is unrealistic to expect a solution
by spending cuts alone. Visions of Russian peace, good will,
and an orderly transfer to a liberal political and economic
order that would enable us prudently to wield a big machete
on our defense spending are fading a bit before new
uncertainties. And behind every spending program, not
excluding defense, is a special-interest group ready to
threaten political oblivion for those casting negative votes
-- and piously equating their program with the general
interest.</p>
<p>A part of the needed budget package must, therefore, be
increased revenues. This will be tough for the members of
Congress who vote for more taxes, and whose folks back home
will not love them more in November for it. And it will be
tough for the president. This is, of course, the price the
political system is paying for our having jettisoned the
fiscal discipline of the always-balanced-budget philosophy.</p>
<p>The revenue part of the package must be seen by the public
as fair, it ought to point in the right direction for
national policy, and it must be something that embodied in
legislation can be passed. There will be a good deal of the
least-squawk principle in any package. A European-style
value-added tax probably would not yet be seen by the public
as fair, and in any case it is outside the present structure
for tax administration. Somewhat higher rates for people with
large incomes might have to be part of a "fair" package.</p>
<p>Higher gasoline taxes are also a candidate for more
revenue. The combination of federal and state taxes in many
states produces lower taxes in real terms on a gallon of
gasoline than before the energy crisis. The level of these
taxes is quite low relative to those in most European
countries, and they are a revenue producer -- roughly a
billion dollars per penny. A higher gasoline tax would at
least help to resolve national policies currently pointing in
precisely opposite directions. Through the legislated
average-mileage requirements that new cars are supposed to
meet (the corporate average fuel efficiency standards),
national policy tells consumers to buy smaller cars. Through
low gasoline taxes, it tells us to buy large cars. Not
surprisingly, the latter signal tends to win.</p>
<p>At one time higher U.S. gasoline taxes could reasonably be
criticized because they would penalize the American auto
industry, whose comparative advantage was in producing large
cars, and favor foreign companies, who specialized in small
cars. That difference is being blurred now as foreign
producers have moved effectively into the market for larger
and more expensive cars.</p>
<p>This year's budget agony will largely have been futile and
wasted unless it includes measures to strengthen basic budget
processes. A great many political brownie points will be
expended in any case, so some permanent improvement in
budgetry should be the result. Two sets of things are needed.</p>
<p>The set of financial statements constituting "the budget"
should present a better picture of the fiscal operations and
position of the federal government. What with off-budget
financing, credit programs, and the failure to estimate the
value of public capital expiring during the year
(depreciation), the present budget does not even begin to
give a true picture of the economic resources pre-empted by
the federal government. If a corporation sent a comparable
annual statement to its stockholders, the Securities and
Exchange Commission would have management in court. It would
seem not unreasonable to require of the federal government,
which pre-empts more than a quarter of the national income
through taxes or borrowing, as high a standard of disclosure
as government imposes on a business.</p>
<p>The budget process must also further fortify the defenses
of fiscal discipline. When the benefits of programs are
specific to a group and the costs are socialized, the demand
for spending is, naturally, unlimited. The pressures are
further intensified by a half-century of "the primacy of
politically directed social planning." Clearly the president
should have the authority to impound authorizations and to
veto specific items. Even stronger sanctions may be required
to achieve the fiscal discipline needed for limiting total
spending.</p>
<p>Four years ago on this page I made a proposal that, if
implemented, would do the job: "To give teeth to the new
process, a further provision might be added. For 12 months
following any year that the budget is in the red, no salaries
could be paid to members of Congress, the president, or
members of his cabinet."</p>
<p>That proposal, however, may not make it this time around
the budget track.</p>
