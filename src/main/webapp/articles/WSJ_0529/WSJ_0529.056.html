	<p class="article-leader">From an editorial on drugs in First Things, a monthly
published by the Institute on Religion and Public Life:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Among the chic it is now much less chic to do drugs. Those
at the bottom of society, however, the structure of whose
lives were most fragile to begin with, made the mistake of
believing their social betters. For them, "alternative
lifestyle" turned out to mean the alternative to sustainable
life. It is nice today to hear celebrities on talk shows
affirm the importance of sobriety, family, and even marital
fidelity. One hopes they remember the line they were
chattering a few years ago. If one wants today to see the
continuing social consequences of that liberationist line,
one has only to visit Bedford-Stuyvesant, South Chicago, or
the crack babies in the preemie wards of our city hospitals.</p>

<p>From an interview on March 20 with Richard Solomon, U.S.
assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific
Affairs:</p>
<p>In Northeast Asia there has been no diminution of the
Soviet threat. While the numbers may have been reduced
somewhat, the deployment of more advanced equipment,
aircraft, ships in particular, has kept the firepower, the
mobility, the effectiveness of the Soviet challenge in
Northeast Asia pretty much where it is. In Southeast Asia
there has been a reduction in the Soviet military presence in
Vietnam.</p>
<p>But the stability of these changes in the Soviet Union
that have made these dramatic developments possible is not at
all assured. And, more to the point in terms of our security
relationship with the Philippines, those facilities have
never been exclusively oriented toward the Soviet Union.</p>
