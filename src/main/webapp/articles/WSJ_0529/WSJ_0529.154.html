	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- American Express Co., in a move that confirms
plans to split Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in half, is
expected to put one of its top travel executives in charge of
Shearson's vast brokerage and money-management side.
   The executive, Jonathan S. Linen, is currently head of the
traveler's checks, direct marketing and publishing group of
American Express Travel Related Services Co. Described by
colleagues as "very refined" and statesmanlike, Mr. Linen has
no experience running a brokerage firm, let alone one of
Shearson's size.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yet despite his inexperience on Wall Street, the
46-year-old Mr. Linen is considered one of American Express's
rising stars, with experience at fixing the firm's troubled
businesses over the years. "He's big on customer service and
quality. Those things are important {too,}" said one American
Express person familiar with the situation who requested
anonymity.</p>
<p>When he takes over at Shearson this week -- an official
announcement is expected today -- Mr. Linen will run the
nation's second-biggest brokerage firm behind Merrill Lynch &
Co., with 470 branches, nearly 10,000 brokers and $90 billion
under management.</p>
<p>His job will be to restore the brokerage force's shattered
morale, stem defections of key personnel and preside over the
cleanup of Shearson stumbles -- including its spotty record
in marketing limited-partnership investments during the
1980s.</p>
<p>Neither American Express nor Shearson would comment about
the expected naming of Mr. Linen. However, it's understood
that the appointment has been in the works for most of this
month, and was completed over the holiday weekend.</p>
<p>The loser in the management move is Hardwick Simmons, for
nearly a decade the head of Shearson's individual-investor
businesses, including the brokerage network. Mr. Simmons
resigned Friday after being told he was being passed over in
favor of Mr. Linen. Mr. Simmons couldn't be reached for
comment over the weekend.</p>
<p>The expected heads of the non-brokerage side of the
reconfigured Shearson are expected to come from within
Shearson. The betting is that Richard S. Fuld Jr. and Sherman
Lewis will co-head this side of the firm, which will operate
under the resurrected name of Lehman Brothers, and will
include Shearson's investment banking and trading operations.
Shearson took over the venerable Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb
Inc. investment bank in 1984.</p>
<p>Mr. Linen's side of the firm will probably retain the
Shearson name, and be called Shearson Group or something
similar.</p>
<p>American Express -- forced to pump more than $1 billion
into struggling Shearson and acquire the remaining common
stock it doesn't already own -- has been moving to put its
imprint on the company and restore confidence in it. The
Shearson split-up is part of that plan; American Express
denies Shearson is being divided as a precursor to a sale of
one or both parts of the firm.</p>
<p>Earlier in the year, Shearson Chairman Peter Cohen was
ousted and was replaced by Howard Clark Jr., at the time
American Express chief financial officer.</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Clark's friend Mr. Linen is moving down from
American Express's executive suite to Shearson's. A person
familiar with the thinking of James D. Robinson III, American
Express chairman, avows that Mr. Robinson has "gone to the
A-team" in installing Mr. Linen at Shearson.</p>
<p>"It's Jim's reaffirmation that he's serious about reviving
Shearson," the person said.</p>
<p>Mr. Linen's first job at American Express 20 years ago was
as an assistant to Howard Clark Sr., then-chairman of
American Express and father of the current Shearson chairman.</p>
<p>American Express has shown a clear dissatisfaction with
the management talent currently at Shearson. It brought in
its own man, Mr. Clark, to run Shearson after Mr. Cohen's
departure. Now, it again has tapped an American Express man
for a senior management role at Shearson, bypassing Shearson
hopefuls.</p>
<p>American Express executives say privately that they think
Shearson can turn around if it's run as well as American
Express is.</p>
<p>Still, American Express has had problems of its own over
the years. And Mr. Linen has been the man that Mr. Robinson
has turned to in the past for problem-solving. Among other
things, Mr. Linen has handled potential major problems at
American Express's travel, publishing and insurance
businesses, say American Express executives.</p>
<p>Mr. Linen wasn't available for comment yesterday.</p>
<p>Mr. Linen's new move will cause some shuffling at American
Express Travel Related Services, where he was one of three
chief executives who, along with Chairman Aldo Papone, report
directly to Mr. Robinson.</p>
<p>Mr. Linen had been head of what is technically called the
Direct Marketing and Travelers Cheques Group, encompassing
traveler's checks, publishing, merchandise services,
world-wide quality assurance, the Amex Life insurance arm and
investment products.</p>
<p>It is expected that Mr. Linen's responsibilities will be
divided between Edwin Cooperman, chief executive of Travel
Related Services North America (which includes American
Express charge cards), and Rick Thoman, chief executive of
American Express International.</p>
<p>Although one American Express executive denied it
yesterday, Mr. Linen's shift to Shearson could remove him as
a candidate to succeed Mr. Robinson as American Express
chairman one day.</p>
<p>In April 1989, when American Express reorganized top
management, the company indicated that one of the three chief
executives in Travel Related Services would probably be named
to follow Mr. Robinson. A job at Shearson, never considered a
direct member of the American Express family, seems to take
Mr. Linen out of the running for the top job, even if he were
to be successful in helping to revive the brokerage firm.</p>
