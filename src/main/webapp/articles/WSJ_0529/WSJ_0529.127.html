	<p class="article-leader">HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Chrysler Corp. confirmed that Vice
President and Treasurer Frederick W. Zuckerman is planning to
leave the auto maker.
   In a statement issued on Friday, Chrysler said Mr.
Zuckerman approached Chrysler management "several months ago"
to say "he was considering leaving Chrysler . . . because of
his strong desire and interest to involve himself in
corporate restructurings or other senior financial officer
activities." Chrysler said Mr. Zuckerman also "has grown
tired of the travel grind" after 11 years of commuting
between Detroit and his home in New York.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Chrysler said its management "reluctantly agreed to let
Fred pursue the many other opportunities open to someone of
his experience and expertise." Chrysler added that Mr.
Zuckerman, 56 years old, "has put together an outstanding
team in the treasurer's office, which will see to it that
Chrysler's financial stability and strength continue to
grow."</p>
<p>A spokesman said the company hasn't any more details about
Mr. Zuckerman's departure, including where he might go or
when.</p>
