	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- Stung by criticism of a plan that will sharply
boost their pensions, General Motors Corp. Chairman Roger B.
Smith and his successor, Robert C. Stempel, said they
probably wouldn't put such an issue to a shareholder vote
again.
   GM shareholders approved the plan by an 83% to 17% margin
Friday. While the vote was lopsided, the proposal to boost
executive pensions attracted the most anti-management ballots
of any issue on the GM proxy this year. Now that it has
passed, one result will be that Mr. Smith, who retires August
1, will see his annual pension benefit nearly double to $1.2
million a year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Separately, GM also disclosed:</p>
<p>-- It plans to increase its European vehicle-making
capacity by 25% to 2 million vehicles by the mid-1990s, in
part by building cars in a joint venture with East German
auto maker Automobilewerke Eisenach. The Eisenach venture
will begin production this year at a rate of 10,000 cars
annually, but GM officials say they hope eventually to
increase output to 150,000 cars annually.</p>
<p>-- It will push in contract talks this summer to get the
United Auto Workers union to accept three-shift production
plans at U.S. factories. GM currently runs three European
factories on three shift production schedules, and that is a
major factor in the record profits GM is reaping from its
European car operations. UAW officials have balked at
accepting three-shift production in the U.S., in part because
they suspect it will allow GM to shut more U.S. plants.</p>
<p>But the hottest issue at the annual meeting was clearly
pensions. The plan to give 3,350 top executives fatter
retirement benefits drew fire from a broad spectrum of GM
constituents ranging from big shareholders to members of the
United Auto Workers union. Shareholders gathered in the
cavernous Fisher Theatre in downtown Detroit cheered
opponents of the plan and booed Mr. Smith when he spoke to
defend it as a reasonable effort to make GM's executive
benefits more competitive.</p>
<p>Afterward, Mr. Smith and Mr. Stempel declared that the
outcry had convinced them to think twice about again going
public with an issue that could be settled privately by GM's
board.</p>
<p>"It's an experiment in corporate governance that's gone
astray," Mr. Smith told shareholders. Later, he added: "If
this is something that gets blown out of proportion by the
press and damages our reputation, it doesn't help us."</p>
<p>Mr. Smith argued that GM was losing "good people" because
its pension benefits were in the bottom 21% of a sample of
big U.S. companies. Pressed to elaborate, Mr. Smith declared
that GM had lost "about 60 {managers} here in the last couple
of months to competitors . . . we lost them all the way up
and down, {from} plant managers {to} paint superintendents.
They were experienced people we need to run our programs."</p>
<p>With the new pension program, GM's white-collar pensions
will still be in the bottom 39% of large U.S. companies, Mr.
Smith said.</p>
<p>Mr. Stempel, seated at Mr. Smith's right hand during a
press conference, seconded the chairman's feelings about
sharing such issues with the public.</p>
<p>"We're certainly going to use judgment in what we bring
forward" to shareholders in the future, he said. However, Mr.
Stempel added GM should get credit for airing the executive
pension issue before the start of contract talks with the
United Auto Workers union this summer.</p>
<p>"I would certainly much rather go into bargaining with the
UAW knowing where we are, as opposed to going through
bargaining and all of a sudden have a surprise," Mr. Stempel
said.</p>
<p>Indeed, GM badly hurt its labor relations in 1982 when it
won concessions from the UAW and then announced fat executive
bonuses shortly after the union contract was signed.</p>
<p>But UAW leaders showed little appreciation Friday for the
advance notice.</p>
<p>"It's unfortunate that GM stockholders have affirmed the
corporation's plans to award unjustifiable pension increases
to already overpaid GM executives," said UAW vice president
Stephen P. Yokich, head of the UAW's GM department.</p>
<p>And some big GM shareholders who opposed the pension plan
didn't quit after the votes were tallied.</p>
<p>"GM would make much better use of this money by investing
in product research and development, plant modernization or
directing the funds" to beef up the company's pension assets,
said Michigan State Treasurer Robert A. Bowman, who manages
retirement funds holding some 8.8 million GM shares. New York
City's pension fund also criticized the plan, saying it
"unduly benefits those who are currently retiring."</p>
