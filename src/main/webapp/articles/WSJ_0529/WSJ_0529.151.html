	<p class="article-leader">When Iraqi President Saddam Hussein called for an Arab
summit in Baghdad, the plan was that Arab heads of state
would formulate a message to George Bush and Mikhail
Gorbachev when they meet this week in Washington.
   So far, the message seems unlikely to be the one Mr.
Hussein intended. He had hoped to demonstrate that the Arab
world is a united force, but yesterday's poorly attended
opening session indicated lingering disunity among Arab
nations. Calls in the government-controlled Iraqi press for
an Arab investment embargo and use of the "oil weapon"
against Western nations suggested that radical Arabs are
groping for ways to impose their will.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The main item on the agenda is the mass immigration of
Soviet Jews to Israel, which many Arab leaders, including
such moderates as Egypt's Hosni Mubarak and Jordan's King
Hussein, see as a threat to the peace process because the
influx may increase Israel's appetite for land. Yet the
summit opened without Hafez Assad of Syria, a crucial figure
in any attempt to pressure neighboring Israel. Mr. Assad
didn't attend because he and the Iraqi president have been
engaged in a feud for years. Lebanon, Syria's ally, also
boycotted the gathering. Algeria, Oman and Morocco sent
delegations below head-of-state level, making the turnout the
worst in the past four years of Arab League summits.</p>
<p>Last year's summit in Casablanca, called to address the
Lebanon problem, failed to come up with a workable plan. A
1988 gathering in Algeria was supposed to finance the
Palestinian cause, but Palestine Liberation Organization
leader Yasser Arafat has complained that the funds weren't
forthcoming.</p>
<p>The Iraqi president opened the Baghdad summit with a
speech attacking Israel. He reiterated his threat of a month
ago that Iraq will use "weapons of total destruction" against
Israel if it attacks Iraq with similar weapons. He blamed the
U.S. for arming and encouraging Israel, saying, "The Zionist
entity would not be able to commit aggression and expansion
territorially at the expense of the Arabs without the
military might and political support of the United States."</p>
<p>In an interview before the summit, Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's
deputy foreign minister, said the issue of Soviet immigration
is one on which the Arab position can easily be
misrepresented. "We don't like to appear as if we are against
freedom of movement," he said, but the rights of Soviet Jews
can't be allowed to trample the rights of Palestinians. "We
are for the right of people to move, but we are also for the
right of Palestinians to return to their homes, whether
inside Israel's pre-1967 borders or on the West Bank."</p>
<p>Mr. Hamdoon said the summit was motivated by fear that the
Middle East could turn more violent in a short time if a
combination of such factors as stagnation in the peace
process, economic hardship in such states as Egypt and Jordan
and the repercussions of Soviet immigration weren't
addressed. "I don't want to talk about months, but there is a
very small gap of time when somebody can do something. After
that it will get out of control," he said.</p>
<p>Jordan's King Hussein, speaking at the session, asked help
for his state's troubled economy, warning that "abandoning
Jordan is abandoning Palestine." Previously, the king has
said that since 1987 thousands of Palestinians have crossed
the border separating the West Bank from his kingdom, driven
out by Israeli military harassment and fear of extremist West
Bank settlers. If Soviet Jews begin to settle the West Bank
en masse, he says he fears such numbers could accelerate,
destabilizing his already fragile kingdom in which half the
population is Palestinian.</p>
