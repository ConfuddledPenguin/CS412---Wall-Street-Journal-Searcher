	<p class="article-leader">Petro-Canada Inc. said its 120,000-barrel-a-day oil
refinery near Edmonton, Alberta, will be closed indefinitely
after an explosion late Thursday killed one worker and
injured two others.
   A Petro-Canada spokeswoman said in Calgary that the cause
of the blast wasn't immediately known and that an
investigation is under way.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Edmonton plant accounts for about one-third of
Petro-Canada's refined crude output. The state-owned company,
which the Canadian government is preparing to take public, is
Canada's second-largest oil refiner, after Toronto-based
Imperial Oil Ltd., 70%-owned by Exxon Corp.</p>
<p>The Edmonton refinery had been closed for about five weeks
for routine maintenance prior to the explosion, and was
scheduled to resume production shortly.</p>
