	<p class="article-leader">Campbell Soup Co. hung a "for sale" sign on some of the
company's least profitable foreign operations, conceding that
the businesses can't deliver adequate returns to
shareholders.
   In connection with the divestitures, the Camden, N.J.,
food company said it expects to record a one-time charge of
$55 million, or 43 cents a share, against earnings for the
fourth quarter ending July 29. For the year-earlier quarter,
Campbell reported a net loss of $194.7 million, or $1.51 a
share, including one-time restructuring charges of $261
million, or $2.02 a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The proposed sales of Campbell's United Kingdom frozen
vegetable and seafood lines and its Italian cookie company
are the latest cost-cutting maneuvers by David W. Johnson,
who became president and chief executive officer in January.</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson's zealous campaign to improve productivity and
profits is resulting in a repudiation of several initiatives
by his predecessor, R. Gordon McGovern, who resigned abruptly
in November 1989. The foreign businesses on the block, which
were pet projects of Mr. McGovern, have annual sales of about
$200 million. In his brief tenure, Mr. Johnson also has
eliminated 364 staff jobs, closed several plants, offered for
sale the company's Juice Bowl unit and scotched plans for a
new corporate headquarters.</p>
<p>Industry analysts praised the latest move, which was
anticipated after Mr. Johnson's tour of Campbell's European
operations a few weeks ago. The Italian cookie business, D.
Lazzaroni & Co., has been plagued with production and
distribution problems. And investors have been calling for
the disposal of the frozen-food businesses ever since
Campbell acquired them in 1988 through its $201 million
purchase of Freshbake Foods Group PLC.</p>
<p>"Lazzaroni and Freshbake have been a running sore at
Campbell for a couple of years," said William Leach, an
analyst at Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette. "The only surprise
was that they didn't sell all of Freshbake."</p>
<p>Indeed, Campbell is putting only the commodity vegetable
divisions of Freshbake on the block. The company maintains
that the half of Freshbake operations devoted to frozen
convenience foods can be made profitable by moving the
low-end lines into a more premium position under the Campbell
name.</p>
<p>In the frozen quiche category, for example, the company
recently renamed its line as Campbell and has boosted its
market share to about 40% in the U.K. "We are working to
build that {frozen convenience foods} business because it is
a strategic one for us," a spokesman said.</p>
<p>Given the commodity nature of the vegetable businesses,
Campbell may have difficulty finding a buyer for the units.
Although United Biscuits PLC recently approached Campbell
about buying certain undisclosed Freshbake operations, "I
don't think even it would be interested," said David
Atkinson, a securities analyst with London-based County
NatWest Wood MacKenzie, which occasionally represents United
Biscuits.</p>
<p>"Freshbake has got such a poor reputation," Mr. Atkinson
said. "I can't really see why anyone would like to come in."</p>
<p>But even a sale at a low price would improve Campbell's
long-term earnings picture, said Ronald Morrow of Smith
Barney, Harris Upham & Co. "Campbell has been underperforming
for so long," he said, "that even getting it up to the
industry average will look good."</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange on
Friday, Campbell shares fell 25 cents to close at $53.375.</p>
