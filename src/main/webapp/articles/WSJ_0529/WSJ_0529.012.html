	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Resolution Trust Corp. sold the 37
branches of Horizon Financial, Southampton, Pa., to First
Valley Bank, Bethlehem, Pa., and Union National Bank of
Pittsburgh.
   The transaction was part of another block of thrift sales
and takeovers, as the agency accelerates the S&L industry
bailout.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Horizon Financial had $1.76 billion in assets and
liabilities of $2.1 billion. The RTC will receive premiums of
$26.5 million from the two acquiring institutions. The RTC
will advance about $1.25 billion to the acquirers and will
retain about $1.75 billion of the Horizon's assets. The
agency expects to recover some of the advances by selling the
assets, and it estimated the ultimate cost of the transaction
at $357.8 million.</p>
<p>Separately, the RTC placed Pima Savings & Loan
Association, Tucson, Ariz., and Mercury Savings & Loan
Association, Huntington Beach, Calif., into receivership. The
assets of Pima Savings totaled $2.7 billion, and the assets
of Mercury Savings totaled $2.2 billion.</p>
<p>The RTC also placed Caguas-Central Savings Bank of Puerto
Rico, with $1.7 billion in assets, and American Pioneer
Savings Bank, Orlando, Fla., with $1.8 billion in assets, in
conservatorship. Caguas-Central Savings Bank is the first
thrift in Puerto Rico to be taken over by the RTC.</p>
<p>Under conservatorships, the institutions are managed by
the government but the owners maintain their interests in the
thrifts. Under receivership, ownership interests are wiped
out and the RTC prepares to sell off the thrift's assets.</p>
<p>In other actions by the RTC last week:</p>
<p>-- Mountainwest Savings & Loan Association, Ogden, Utah,
was sold to Mountainwest Financial, Sandy, Utah, a newly
chartered subsidiary of Sears Consumer Financial Corp.
Mountainwest Savings had assets of $155.3 million and
liabilities of $211.4 million. The RTC will advance about
$180 million to the acquirer and retain $128.4 million in
assets. The agency expects the transaction ultimately to cost
$65.1 million.</p>
<p>-- Deseret Savings & Loan Association, Salt Lake City, was
sold to Zions First National Bank, Salt Lake City, a unit of
Zions Bancorporation. Deseret had assets of $131.8 million
and liabilities of $221.8 million. The RTC advanced $125.3
million and retained $104.3 million in assets, and expects
this transaction to cost $99.2 million.</p>
<p>-- The insured deposits of First Federal Savings & Loan
Association of Brenham, Texas, were transferred to Kilgore
Federal Savings & Loan Association, Kilgore, Texas. First
Federal had $116.4 million in assets, and liabilities of
$125.4 million. The RTC advanced $76.8 million, and expects
the transaction to cost $36.8 million.</p>
<p>-- Remington Savings Association, Elgin, Texas, was placed
in receivership. The thrift had $174.2 million in assets.</p>
