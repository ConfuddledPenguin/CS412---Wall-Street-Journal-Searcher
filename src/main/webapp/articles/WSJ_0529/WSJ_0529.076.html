	<p class="article-leader">FRANKFURT, West Germany -- Only a year ago, the
ultrarightist Republican Party was flying high with its
borderline neo-Nazi brand of nationalism. This year it should
have been celebrating a new legitimacy as Germany
rediscovered nationhood.
   But West Germany's mainstream parties have stolen its
thunder.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>German nationhood is no longer an issue for the
Republicans alone, and the rush toward reunification has
deflated the nationalist party's bid for political leverage.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, or CDU,
and other important parties now embrace German unity with a
zeal previously heard only at the Republicans' beerhall
rallies, albeit more delicately and with greater effect.</p>
<p>Voters are turning away from the Republicans' blunt
law-and-order rhetoric and its haunting visions of a greater
Germany. Demoralized and split into bickering camps, the
party is being written off as a contender in national
politics.</p>
<p>Indeed, the party's death knell may have been sounded
Friday with the resignation of Chairman Franz Schoenhuber,
who complained that the party he founded had been taken over
by "a small clique of extremist functionaries" that he felt
unable to oppose. Otto Lambsdorff, head of Chancellor Kohl's
junior coalition partners, the Free Democrats, commented:
"The remains. . .of this party will soon scatter themselves
into the wind."</p>
<p>The Republicans burst onto the national scene with a
startling 7.5% vote in the January 1989 city-state elections
of West Berlin, where social tensions played to the party's
anti-immigrant themes. Alarm grew in Bonn again last June
when the upstarts captured 7.1% of the West German national
vote for the European Parliament. Germany's European
neighbors and Israel expressed concern over the party's
popularity.</p>
<p>The center-right Christian Democrats were battered in the
polls as conservative voters flocked to the brash Republicans
in state and local elections, handing upset victories to the
left-of-center Social Democratic Party, or SDP. The
Republicans hoped to win more than 5% of the vote in next
December's national ballot, enough for parliamentary seats.
Worried CDU leaders talked of coalitions with the Republicans
on the state level.</p>
<p>All that has changed. In the key May 13 elections in the
big states of North-Rhine Westphalia and Lower Saxony,
accounting for 40% of the West German electorate, the
Republicans fell woefully short of the minimum 5% required
for representation. Pollsters say the party would be lucky to
muster 2% of a national vote now.</p>
<p>The relief in Bonn is audible. During a televised
political roundtable analyzing the May election results, the
only point on which CDU Chairman Kohl and SDP Chairman
Hans-Jochen Vogel could agree was the demise of the
Republicans.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, many West Germans, including Republican
supporters, lately have been thinking twice about
unification. Estimates that unity will cost West Germans
hundreds of billions of marks over several years have even
sent some conservatives scurrying to the Social Democrats,
who have been urging a slower approach to unification.</p>
<p>"Unification has become a two-edged sword for us. We've
lost a lot of wind from our sails," concedes Centa Hirsch,
the Republicans' national manager.</p>
<p>The Republicans, described by senior SDP politician
Johannes Rau as "a mixture of prejudices brewed into a
political soup," have tried to regain the initiative. They
assert that German unity should reinstitute the borders of
1937, which include large parts of what is now Poland and the
Soviet Union. This drew a deafening silence from an
electorate already fretting about the Kremlin's reaction to
losing East Germany.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, West Germany's preoccupation with unification
has overshadowed other issues that earned the Republicans
points: tough anti-crime reforms and airtight immigration
laws to keep "Germany for Germans." In addition, the Kohl
government, trying to regain right-wing voters, last year
switched interior ministers and clamped down on immigrants
with a series of tougher asylum laws.</p>
<p>Before he quit, Republican Chairman Schoenhuber, a
charismatic, hard-hitting speaker who referred frequently to
his wartime service as a Waffen-SS sergeant, had blamed the
party's poor showing in the elections and in polls on a
hostile news media and left-wing smear campaign. On the
morning after the Republicans' May 13 setbacks, Mr.
Schoenhuber declared that the political winds would shift
again, and "the votes will go to those who have had a
snootful of socialism in all its forms."</p>
<p>Admittedly, the Republicans' press has been less than
favorable. But the media hasn't had to look hard for
material.</p>
<p>Mr. Schoenhuber's wartime escapades with the Waffen-SS
were vividly described in his memoir, "I Was There."
Anti-Semitic remarks by one regional party boss was followed
by another's assertion that anti-nuclear protesters were scum
belonging in labor camps. Yet another gained a reputation as
a bully for personally manhandling dissenters at party
meetings.</p>
<p>Hounded by the commercial press, the Republicans took a
stab at setting the record straight with its own Credo
magazine. But the venture backfired after Die Zeit, a
national newsweekly, drew attention to the fact that Credo
was advertising videos for sale featuring Third Reich
newsreels of Adolf Hitler and other Nazi bigwigs.</p>
<p>"Things can't go on like this," said the Republicans' Ms.
Hirsch. "Voters from the far right aren't enough. We can't
get into the big parliaments without mainstream voters. And
they are being alienated by some of our front-line people."</p>
<p>As the party split into rebellious factions, Mr.
Schoenhuber tried to weed out radical firebrands. His prime
target was the Bavarian party chief, Harald Neubauer. Mr.
Neubauer, co-publisher of Credo magazine, was seen as a
leading candidate to eventually replace Mr. Schoenhuber, who
is 67 years old. After Mr. Schoenhuber resigned Friday, party
headquarters in Munich said his former deputy, Johanna Grund,
56, would replace him until a new party leader is chosen.</p>
<p>If the Republicans have one last shot, it would be
October's state election in Bavaria, an arch-conservative
stronghold long dominated by the Christian Social Union, the
Bavarian sister party of Mr. Kohl's Christian Democrats. The
Republicans confidently set a goal of polling 15%. But a
recent Munich newspaper poll put their statewide backing at
less than 3%.</p>
