	<p class="article-leader">BRUSSELS -- Alitalia joined the growing ranks of European
carriers teaming up with U.S. airlines by signing a
commercial agreement with USAir.
   Signed in Rome, the accord will give the two carriers'
passengers easier access to each airline's network.
Passengers of 81% state-owned Alitalia will be able to link
up with USAir planes in Boston, Los Angeles and Miami and
travel on to some 40 U.S. destinations. Alitalia carried 16.2
million passengers last year and served 102 cities.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>USAir, which has its hubs in Pittsburgh and Charlotte,
N.C., will funnel its international passengers through
Alitalia's Milan and Rome hubs for onward travel to the
Italian airline's 23 destinations in Eastern Europe, the
Middle East and Africa. USAir, which last year absorbed
Piedmont Airlines, carried a total of 61.2 million passengers
last year and served 135 cities.</p>
<p>USAir's only European routes are to Frankfurt and London's
Gatwick Airport. Giovanni Bisignani, Alitalia's managing
director, said in a telephone interview that flying to Europe
isn't USAir's "major strategy." Thus, he said, he
"absolutely" doesn't expect the U.S. carrier to announce
plans to fly to Rome or Milan.</p>
<p>The agreement will begin June 16 in Boston and Los
Angeles. The Miami link will begin Oct. 29. In a new
bilateral air-services agreement between the U.S. and Italy,
Alitalia will be able to expand its services to five new U.S.
gateways over the next four years. Miami was Alitalia's first
choice. Mr. Bisignani said future choices will depend in part
of how the alliance with USAir works.</p>
<p>Randall Malin, vice chairman of USAir, told a news
conference in Rome that although the accord doesn't include
an equity swap, he wouldn't rule one out. "It's a possibility
in the future," he said. "I wouldn't say it's a probability."</p>
<p>USAir officials weren't available for comment.</p>
<p>Alitalia hopes the easy access to U.S. destinations will
help it raise its market share of air traffic between the
U.S. and Italy. In 1989, Alitalia transported 700,000
passengers on the trans-Atlantic routes, equal to 46% of the
total. Pan American World Airlines and Trans World Airlines
are the other airlines linking the U.S. and Italy. Mr.
Bisignani said he expects traffic to increase by at least 20%
as a result of the USAir link.</p>
<p>The accord will put Alitalia into USAir's frequent-flier
program and will allow first-class, business-class and
full-price economy passengers on Alitalia to fly first-class
on USAir. It also will extend to cargo activities.</p>
<p>In recent years, several U.S.-European airline alliances
have been formed. British Airways cooperates with United
Airlines; KLM Royal Dutch Airlines works with Northwest
Airlines; Swissair has an agreement with Delta Air Lines.
Alitalia has its own marketing agreement with United at the
U.S. carrier's Chicago hub.</p>
<p>But Mr. Bisignani said that agreement "is quite limited"
whereas the USAir accord has "strategic relevance." He said
he doesn't expect Alitalia to link up with any other U.S.
carriers.</p>
<p>Another strategic link came last week, when Alitalia
signed an accord with Iberia, the Spanish flag carrier. As
previously reported, Alitalia will use Madrid as its gateway
to Latin America and Iberia will use Rome as its transfer
point to Asian destinations. Mr. Bisignani said the next step
will come when Alitalia finds an Asian airline partner.</p>
