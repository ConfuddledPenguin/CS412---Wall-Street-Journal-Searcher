	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo stocks ended the afternoon firmly higher yesterday,
inspired as the yen managed to maintain steady levels after
its strong move against the dollar, traders said.
   Although a burst of morning buying had calmed to a simmer
by midday, stocks on the Nikkei Index still were able to
close the day notably higher.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The London market was closed yesterday for a holiday.
Friday, London shares finished mostly lower, the end of a
two-week trading account, in mainly sluggish trading.</p>
<p>Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues, which rallied 482.13
points Friday, was up 397.73 points yesterday to 33191.61.</p>
<p>In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the Nikkei index fell
54.30 to 33137.31.</p>
<p>Monday's volume on the first section was estimated at 750
million shares, down from 1.04 billion shares Friday.
Advancers outnumbered decliners 541 to 430, while 163 issues
were unchanged.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section, which swelled 24.04 points Friday, added 14.11
points, or 0.58%, at 2434.05.</p>
<p>But the second section index fell 8.47 points, or 0.22%,
to close at 3884.38. The index slipped 0.75 point Friday,
ending an 18-session winning streak. Volume was estimated at
13.9 million shares, down from 16.3 million shares Friday.</p>
<p>Participants returned from the weekend to find that the
yen had strengthened substantially against the dollar in New
York trading Friday, breaking through the 150-yen barrier.</p>
<p>Convinced that the Japanese currency could hold the higher
levels against the dollar, many investors bought domestic
demand-related stocks heavily in the morning, traders said.
Construction stocks, both of large and small companies,
rallied, as did shares of some environmental-energy
companies.</p>
<p>In addition, one trader said some institutional and
index-linked buying in the Tokyo morning gave the impression
that the market was shooting forward with little resistance
ahead.</p>
<p>But selling pressure broke the rally's momentum before the
early session closed, as some institutional investors, who
suffered heavy losses this year on special money accounts,
moved to take profits on a broad range of issues.</p>
<p>Although volume was moderately active in the afternoon,
trading consisted of a matched amount of selling against
buying, allowing for only sideways movement on the indexes,
observers said.</p>
<p>Yusuke Fujiwara, head of trading at Baring Securities
Ltd., noted that volume of 750 million shares wasn't bad,
particularly for a Monday, which happened to be the last day
of trading on accounts for May settlement.</p>
<p>But further gains for the Nikkei Index will depend partly
on whether trading volume picks up, Mr. Fujiwara said. And he
pointed out that "it's going to be hard to buy from here,"
with prices having recovered substantially from the Nikkei's
most recent post-crash low of 28002 on April 2.</p>
<p>A test for the market will be developments in the
dollar-yen rate over the next few days. If the dollar doesn't
recover in the short term, and slips to 145 yen, Mr. Fujiwara
said, the market should advance further.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the yen's strength put a damper on
buying high-technology electrical shares, noted Kevin Haag, a
dealer in overseas operations at Nomura Securities Co.</p>
<p>Many investors were still disappointed with Sony's
earnings forecasts of a 12% rise in pretax profit for the
current year and the absence of a gratis issue for the
previous fiscal year, Mr. Haag said.</p>
<p>Mr. Fujiwara noted, however, that high-technology stocks
haven't been completely ignored during the yen's recent
recovery, with interest in these high-priced issues, though
somewhat more selective, still remaining at normal levels.</p>
<p>Traders noted special caution for investors seeking to buy
at current levels. "More than resistance, the story to watch
for is the selling pressure" from institutions, who needed
the Nikkei Index reach around 34000 points to break even on
their special money accounts, Mr. Haag said.</p>
<p>Although that level wasn't achieved by the March 31 end of
the fiscal year, these institutions have recovered much of
their losses since the Nikkei was seen bottoming out April 2,
and so will likely start taking profits soon, he said.</p>
<p>Several pharmaceutical shares were hit by profit-taking,
including Ono, down 110 yen to 5650 yen (73 cents to $37.43),
Dai ichi, down 50 yen to 2470 yen, and Fuso, down 30 yen to
1530 yen.</p>
<p>But construction shares held their gains against such
selling pressure, with Shimizu Corp. up 180 yen to 2040 yen,
Ohbayashi up 50 yen to 1740 yen, and Taisei up 40 yen to 1410
yen.</p>
<p>Among other advancers were securities firms such as
Nomura, which gained 100 yen to 2580 yen, Daiwa, up 50 yen to
1710 yen, and Yamaichi, up 60 yen to 1460 yen. In addition,
some cement, real estate and a wide range of speculative
issues were higher.</p>
<p>On Friday, London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100
Share Index finished down 11.5 points at 2265.6, slightly
below the intraday best of 2276.3 and above the low of
2258.4.</p>
<p>The Financial Times 30 Share Index was down 5.2 points at
1800. Volume was a scant 385.6 million shares.</p>
<p>Profit-talking and an obvious absence of buyers for much
of the session dragged prices lower, traders said. A lack of
stimulating corporate or economic news further burdened the
market, causing prices to drift down, the traders added.</p>
<p>Equities staged a modest rally during the last hours of
trading, stemming largely from fresh buying that will carry
over into the new account, dealers said.</p>
<p>One trader with a major London brokerage firm said the
last-minute influx of investors reflected a general sentiment
among participants that the market has good upside potential
this week.</p>

Zurich, Brussels and Stockholm, lower in Milan, mixed in
Paris, Amsterdam. South African gold stocks closed narrowly
mixed. Friday, prices closed higher in Stockholm and Milan;

and Seoul. The Hong Kong and Taipei markets were closed for
holidays. Friday, stocks closed higher in Tokyo, Sydney, Hong
Kong, Manila, Wellington and Seoul; and lower in Singapore
