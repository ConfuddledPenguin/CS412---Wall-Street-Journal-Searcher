	<p class="article-leader">Rep. Bob Smith thinks one way to win votes in New
Hampshire is to annex part of Maine.
   The New Hampshire Republican, running in a heated primary
for a U.S. Senate seat, is expected to disclose soon evidence
showing that the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard -- currently found
in Kittery, Maine -- belongs to the Granite State. It's the
latest blow in a border war simmering since 1976, when the
states landed in court over where to draw the line on the
broad Piscataqua River that flows between them.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The congressman can probably count on the support of most
of the 4,000 shipyard workers who commute daily across the
river from New Hampshire: They'd rather not pay Maine income
taxes. Victor Bourre, a shipyard worker who says he uncovered
the new evidence after searching through old, yellowed
documents, has been staging such tea party-like protests as
dumping Maine potatoes and a giant tea bag into the disputed
river.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the 190-year-old shipyard -- on an
island connected by a short bridge to Kittery -- says the
Navy is "staying out of this one."</p>
<p>But New Hampshire Attorney General John Arnold says that
the governor has asked him to look into the issue and that
the state might support a lawsuit. "I'm sure there will be
amicable discussions with Maine, which will prove fruitless,
after which I expect we'll move to file before the Supreme
Court."</p>
<p>Under law, most state border disputes go straight to the
high court. The last such spat -- over lobstering rights --
was decided, in Maine's favor, when the justices agreed in
1976 that the border was drawn by a 1740 King's Court decree.</p>
<p>Maine officials say their neighbors are just sore because
Maine bases its income-tax rate on the joint income of
married New Hampshire workers, even if only one spouse works
in Maine.</p>
<p>Maine Attorney General James Tierney says he's ready to
cut a deal. "But we want {New Hampshire's} Mount Washington
and the turnpike tollbooths on the table," he says. Mount
Washington isn't near the border, but, he says, "We can
easily see it from here."</p>
<p>It's a case of a congressman who's willing to go the extra
mile to fight taxes, "even if it's in somebody else's state,"
says Joseph Brennan, a Democrat and former Maine governor.
"Nice try, New Hampshire, but it won't work," he says. "Pay
your taxes."</p>
