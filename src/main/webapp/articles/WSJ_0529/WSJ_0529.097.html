	<p class="article-leader">BRAINTREE, Mass. -- Grossman's Inc. said a shareholder
group has indicated its intent to solicit shareholder consent
to unseat the company's directors.
   The action comes one month after Grossman's nine directors
were re-elected to the board at the company's annual meeting.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission
announcing the proxy contest, the dissident group indicated
disastifaction with the board's decision to reject a recent
financial restructuring plan it had proposed.</p>
<p>The proposal, made last month, included an $85 million
capital infusion through the sale and leaseback by the
building materials retailer of 81 properties. Grossman would
have the option of buying back all the properties in five
years.</p>
<p>In a May 21 letter Grossman's rejected the proposal saying
it wasn't in the best interest of shareholders, Stanley G.
Berman, executive vice president of administration at
Grossman's said.</p>
<p>The shareholder group, led by Hawaii-based real estate
investor Jay H. Shidler and Robert W. Holman Jr., a San
Francisco investor, holds approximately 21.6 million shares
of Grossman's stock outstanding, or 4.7% of the company.</p>
<p>The SEC filing also disclosed that the Holdman-Shidler
group offered to acquire Grossman's last year for $10.25 a
share but withdrew the proposal after Grossman's agreed to
sell its Moore division.</p>
<p>The division, consisting of 59 stores, was sold last
September for approximately $85 million to a U.S. unit of
Harrisons & Crossfield PLC of London.</p>
<p>A month later the partnership again offered to acquire 83%
of Grossman's for $9 a share in cash and the remainder for
preferred stock. Grossman's didn't respond, according to
federal filings.</p>
<p>The partnership continued to express interest in the
company through last March. Instead the Holman-Shidler group
said it has decided to solicit shareholder consent to remove
the board. Because technically this is a consent solicitation
and not a proxy contest an election can be held before the
board's next annual meeting. The group said in its SEC
filings that Mr. Holman and Mr. Shidler would serve as
nominees for election as directors but added that it hasn't
determined who the other candidates will be.</p>

<p>A SHAREHOLDER GROUP led by Jay H. Shidler and Robert W.
Holman Jr. holds about 1.2 million shares of Grossman's Inc.,
or about 4.7% of the stock outstanding. In Tuesday's edition,
the number of shares was misstated.</p>
