	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Japan's major retail stores reported sales of
1.651 trillion yen ($10.94 billion) in April, a 16% rise from
a year earlier when the introduction of a 3% consumption tax
curbed sales, the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry said.
   Japanese consumer demand has been supported by growing
income as the nation's economy continues to expand. In March,
however, retail sales fell 2%, the first annual decline in
more than five years. The ministry attributed the drop to
high year-earlier sales as consumers rushed to buy before
retail stores began raising prices to include the 3% tax.</p>
