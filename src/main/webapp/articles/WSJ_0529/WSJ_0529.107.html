	<p class="article-leader">Hans Martin Glang, a roofing contractor in Philadelphia,
didn't want to sign a collective-bargaining agreement with
the local union, so 11 thugs attacked him one night outside
an American Legion hall. Thomas Hudecheck, a contractor in
Downington, Pa., accepted a commercial roofing job, so the
union, which said he could only work on residential
buildings, firebombed his office. Robert Kryszczak used two
union roofers for a warehouse repair job instead of the six
that the union had demanded. So at the Bucks County, Pa.,
jobsite one day, the shop steward beckoned to Mr. Kryszczak
to join him on the warehouse roof.
   Mr. Kryszczak climbed up a 40-foot ladder and was
confronted by six men. "We want six roofers on the job]" one
demanded. Then, Mr. Kryszczak later testified in a federal
case, "I received a bone-crushing blow to the left side of my
face, which caught my jaw underneath and literally ripped it
off and rendered me semiconscious on the roof. I remember
more kicks to the head, and I started pleading to God for the
kicking to stop, but it didn't." Mr. Kryszczak's jaw was
wired shut for 12 weeks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But things have changed. Philadelphia's 1,500-member
Roofers Union Local 30/30b, once controlled by a Mafia-backed
hoodlum who terrorized roofing contractors in Pennsylvania,
southern New Jersey and Delaware, now is supervised by the
U.S. government. The union local was declared a criminal
enterprise, union officials went to prison, and people like
Nicodemo (Little Nicky) Scarfo were replaced with a
Philadelphia lawyer named Robert Welsh Jr., who says, "They
can't write a check or hire a secretary without my
signature." The result, says Mr. Hudecheck: "I don't have to
look over my shoulder anymore."</p>
<p>The U.S. takeover of Local 30/30b -- and of a New York
cement workers' union and a New Jersey Teamsters local -- are
examples of the government's most successful offensive ever
against the Mafia. Fourteen Mafia chieftains -- the heads of
nearly half the crime "families" in the nation -- are in
prison, more than at any other time since the Mafia first
emerged as a nationwide crime syndicate in 1931.</p>
<p>Nor is the pressure easing. In March, the Mafia boss of
Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut, Raymond
Patriarca Jr., was indicted on racketeering and other
charges. "There's no more hiding," complained Anthony F.
(Guv) Guarnieri, a captain in Pennsylvania's Bufalino crime
family. "They can get us no matter where we go." He was
right: He was being secretly recorded at the time.</p>
<p>More witnesses are speaking up as the fear of retaliation
eases, according to Mafia specialist G. Robert Blakey, a law
professor at Notre Dame University. "As more bosses are
prosecuted," he says, "the notion that the Mafia is
invincible is seen as a myth."</p>
<p>The ebbing influence of the Mafia -- or La Cosa Nostra,
the crime group established by Salvatore (Lucky) Luciano and
still supervised by a ruling council known as the Commission
-- extends beyond its hobbled leadership cadre. In the past
four years, the government has made significant inroads on
another front: ridding the marketplace of domination by
Mafia-infested unions. Using the broad powers of the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations act,
prosecutors are tackling labor racketeering with a dual
thrust: filing criminal RICO charges against mob figures and
civil RICO actions against the unions themselves. That allows
judges to appoint trustees to supervise the union and set the
stage for free elections.</p>
<p>Since last year, three court-appointed overseers have been
policing the Mafia-linked International Brotherhood of
Teamsters. In February, the Justice Department zeroed in on
what it describes as a Mafia stranglehold of the New York-New
Jersey waterfront, the world's second biggest port. Through
civil RICO, federal lawmen are seeking a court's
authorization to police an entire marketplace by clamping
trusteeships on six local unions of the Mafia-linked
International Longshoremen's Association. The ILA locals, the
government asserts in a civil RICO case, are employed by the
Mafia for extortion and other crimes -- charges that the
defendants deny. "There's a general malaise, if you will, in
the Cosa Nostra underworld," says Frederick T. Martens,
executive director of the Pennsylvania Crime Commission.</p>
<p>The news, of course, is not all good. John Gotti, reputed
boss of the New York-based Gambino crime family, enjoys a
charmed life. Three times in recent years, the "dapper don"
has beat the rap, including his acquittal in February of
assault charges.</p>
<p>The Mafia still exerts control over legitimate businesses
through as many as 400 individual local unions nationwide,
law-enforcement officials estimate. Although they make up
less than 1% of the total, these Mafia unions are often
strategically situated to shut down an entire industry
through mob-directed work stoppages.</p>
<p>The Justice Department estimates income of all organized
criminal groups at $100 billion a year. The Mafia has the
largest share, and the biggest chunk now comes from labor
racketeering -- usually extortion of employers or
embezzlement of union pension and welfare funds. The Mafia
maintains a strong presence in parts of the transportation,
meat processing, waste disposal and construction industries.</p>
<p>And building RICO cases against union locals is tedious
and often frustrating work. Years of entrenched mob influence
can't be obliterated with the stroke of a judge's pen. Still,
as the following vignettes show, there is demonstrable
progress in the fight against the Mafia.</p>
<p>Philadelphia Roofers</p>
<p>Philadelphia's Roofers Union Local 30/30b has a history of
sporadic violence and corruption. In the 1980s it sank to new
lows.</p>
<p>In late 1980, Local 30/30b's boss, John McCullough, was
murdered in a Mafia hit. In the union power struggle that
followed, according to federal law enforcement officials,
Philadelphia Mafia chieftain Nicodemo Scarfo threw his
support to a McCullough functionary, Stephen Traitz Jr. Mr.
Traitz, easily elected union leader, lost no time repaying
his powerful benefactor. He collected Mr. Scarfo's debts,
gave jobs to Mr. Scarfo's people, and had his sons serve as
Mr. Scarfo's bodyguards. Mr. Scarfo won assurances from Mr.
Traitz, an ex-boxer, that he wouldn't physically assault
roofing contractors friendly to the mob. Mr. Traitz also
allowed some of these contractors to pay below-scale wages.</p>
<p>In return, Mr. Scarfo gave Mr. Traitz his blessing. As Mr.
Traitz said in a recorded conversation, "{Scarfo} says what
can I do for you? I says . . . make sure everybody knows I'm
your {expletive} guy. . . . If they know you're in back of
me, I'm un{expletive}beatable."</p>
<p>For a time, it seemed he was. Roofing contractors bought
labor peace with "initiation fees" and other questionable
payments to the union. Those who challenged Local 30/30b even
in petty matters risked property destruction or assaults by
union goons weighing as much as 340 pounds. In a recorded
conversation, Mr. Traitz boasted: "I'm a fistfighter. I got
all fistfighters."</p>
<p>Money embezzled by union officials from a local 30/30b
benefit fund was used for payoffs to nearly 50
Philadelphia-area public officials. Recipients of bribes
included judges, policemen, prison officials, an employee of
the Philadelphia district attorney's office and an official
of the Pennslyvania Department of Labor, according to federal
Judge Louis C. Bechtle, who imposed the government
supervision on Local 30/30b.</p>
<p>Contractor Thomas Zimmerman tangled with Local 30/30b in
1983 while serving on the board of a Philadelphia trade group
that negotiates contracts with the union. After Mr. Zimmerman
opposed the union twice on policy matters at board meetings,
his veteran roofing employees were ousted by the union and
replaced with union-designated workers.</p>
<p>William Hargrove, a contractor in Camden, N.J., was
beaten, his trucks were set afire and his repair work was
vandalized because he refused to dismiss his nonunion roofers
and hire Local 30/30b workers, he said in an interview. And
Mr. Hudecheck, whose office earlier had been firebombed, was
later beaten up in his office when the union accused him --
falsely -- of hiring a nonunion employee.</p>
<p>Mr. Hudecheck, now a nonunion contractor, joined other
roofers in testifying in a civil RICO hearing. "When they
asked us to cooperate, a lot of us were a little reluctant,"
he says. "Anybody who cooperated faced retribution if nothing
was done to those in power."</p>
<p>Today, the Scarfo-Traitz alliance has ended. Last year Mr.
Scarfo received life in prison for murder in a state case,
and 55 years for racketeering in a federal case. Meantime, 13
union officials and employees have been convicted under RICO
of extortion, racketeering and other crimes. Mr. Traitz drew
a 15-year prison sentence. Local 30/30b was declared a
criminal enterprise by Judge Bechtle, who named Mr. Welsh to
supervise the union.</p>
<p>The situation "has changed 180 degrees for the better,"
says Mr. Hargrove. "We can operate without intimidation since
the government has taken over." Since the federal crackdown,
he also is winning back subcontracting business. "Contractors
had second thoughts about hiring us a second time," Mr.
Hargrove says. "They feared they'd suffer retaliation from
the roofers union. Now some of the guys who had stopped using
us are using us."</p>
<p>Says Mr. Hudecheck: "The government did a thorough job.
The intimidation is basically nonexistent now."</p>
<p>Mr. Zimmerman has operated as a nonunion contractor since
last November, and says he has experienced no intimidation.
Yet he is still shaken. "The feds asked me if I wanted a gun
permit," he says. "I said no, I'm no Wyatt Earp." Instead, he
armed himself with a mobile phone. "I can punch in Welsh's
number, and the Department of Labor. I take it to the roof
with me. That's my lifeline."</p>
<p>Mr. Welsh, the court-appointed officer of the union,
agrees that there has been external progress. "Instead of
violence {against employers} or burning buildings," he says,
"now the union puts up picket lines, or files charges with
the National Labor Relations Board."</p>
<p>But, he cautions: "In terms of internal democracy, I'm not
encouraged. They have a long way to go in that area." The
roofers union elected officers last June in what Mr. Welsh
says "appeared to be a free election." But he says many of
those elected had been associated with the Traitz group and
"haven't yet learned to permit dissenting opinion." Mr. Welsh
believes it could take more than five years before dissenters
can criticize the leadership without fear of reprisal.</p>
<p>N.Y. Concrete Workers</p>
<p>For the privilege of pouring the concrete foundations of
Manhattan office and apartment buildings, contractors
regularly paid kickbacks to Ralph Scopo, a member of the
Colombo crime family and president of the New York District
Council of Cement and Concrete Workers Union, according to
testimony in federal criminal cases in New York. Carlo
D'Arpino, a New Hyde Park, N.Y., contractor, testified in
1985 that he gave $16,000 to the union leader during a period
of about two years. "{Scopo} made it plain, if you want to
exist and get by with no problem, this is the procedure," Mr.
D'Arpino says in an interview.</p>
<p>Testimony in a 1987 federal criminal case showed that Mr.
Scopo and the Colombo family extorted 1% of all
concrete-pouring contracts up to $2 million. In an intricate
bid-rigging scheme, contracts exceeding $2 million were
allocated among roughly six Mafia-designated contractors
known as "the Club." Club members paid kickbacks of 2% of
their contracts, and the payoffs were split among four New
York crime families. Contracts above $15 million were
reserved for S&A Concrete, in which Genovese crime family
boss Anthony (Fat Tony) Salerno held a secret interest,
according to the New York State Organized Crime Task Force.</p>
<p>Contractor Stanley Sternchos testified that his company
was excluded from the Club and thus could bid only on jobs
under $2 million. He also testified that he obtained some
larger contracts by paying Mr. Scopo personally $10,000 per
contract. His company's total payments to the mob over
several years totaled $800,000, he testified.</p>
<p>The FBI estimates that during the period of Mafia control,
New York concrete companies overcharged builders by more than
$40 million a year to offset their illegal payoffs. Prior to
construction of Manhattan's Jacob K. Javits Convention
Center, for example, engineers projected that the contract
for pouring concrete would be $18 million. Instead, S&A
Concrete got the contract for $30.3 million.</p>
<p>The shakedown ring was smashed. Mr. Scopo and his Mafia
bosses were sentenced under RICO in 1987 to 100-year prison
terms for extortion and other crimes. Then, in a civil RICO
action, the District Council and Local 6a of the Cement and
Concrete Workers were placed under a court-appointed trustee.</p>
<p>Mr. Salerno, a member of the Mafia Commission, is in
prison; S&A Concrete still operates, but under court-imposed
trusteeship.</p>
<p>Irving Fisher, chairman of HRH Construction, a major New
York builder, estimates that the absence of competition
increased developers' costs 20%. Since the federal crackdown,
he says, "there's no question in my mind there's more
competition." Typically, he says, six or eight companies will
bid on a job now, versus one or two in the past.</p>
<p>Though Mr. Scopo and some of his henchmen have been ousted
from the union, other officials -- against whom no damaging
evidence surfaced -- kept their jobs. Eugene Anderson, the
New York attorney who is the union trustee, says that the
incumbents of Local 6a and the District are viewed by the
membership as part of the old regime, whether or not such a
view is justified. For whatever reason, the membership
refused to challenge the incumbents in elections held in 1987
-- a fact that Mr. Anderson calls his "single biggest
frustration" as trustee. New elections are scheduled for this
fall.</p>
<p>New Jersey Teamsters</p>
<p>For a quarter-century, Anthony (Tony Pro) Provenzano, a
captain of New York's Genovese crime family, bossed the
7,800-member Teamster Local 560 in Union City, N.J. He died
in 1988 while serving a 20-year sentence for accepting
illegal payments from employers. Since 1986, the local has
operated under a trusteeship, the first imposed on a union
under RICO.</p>
<p>In an interview, the current trustee, Edwin H. Stier,
relates an incident that occurred during Christmas 1987 to
show how deeply embedded union corruption was. A union
business agent whom Mr. Stier had appointed paid a routine
call on an employer, whose warehousemen belong to Local 560.
According to Mr. Stier, the employer asked the business
agent: "Who do I make the payment to? Every Christmas I'm
supposed to come up with $5,000."</p>
<p>"The employer believed he was buying labor peace," Mr.
Stier says. "He didn't realize, until he was explicitly told,
that the corruption was over."</p>
<p>During the Provenzano regime, two union dissidents were
murdered, union funds were misused, and former convicts were
put on the union payroll. Some employers paid union officers
illegal kickbacks for "sweetheart contracts" that enabled
them to pay below-scale wages.</p>
<p>Robert Kortenhaus, an Elizabeth, N.J., trucking executive
and critic of the Provenzano regime, employs Teamster drivers
who don't belong to Local 560. For a long time, he says, this
put him at a disadvantage: "You can't compete when {Local
560} negotiates $9 to $10 an hour, against your $14 an hour."
Today, he says he's better off "to the extent there's not all
these sweetheart deals going on with Local 560." Under the
trusteeship, "employers have got somebody to go to. As long
as the police are on the beat, we're in good shape. We needed
an overseer. Now there's a feeling of honesty."</p>
<p>Union pension and welfare funds are now under the control
of the trustee, and the corruption alleged by the government
is being rooted out. The cleanup not only frees more money
for actual benefits but also "tends to slow down the
acceleration rate in employer premiums," says John West,
president of TNT Red Star Express in Newark.</p>
<p>In Teamster Local 560, the election for president in late
1988 was the first under the trusteeship. Michael Sciarra, a
former 560 president, was the choice of the union's
pro-Provenzano group. But the court removed him as a
candidate after the Justice Department contended that he
acted on the Genovese crime family's behalf even after the
court declared the trusteeship. Mr. Sciarra has denied any
wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Instead, his brother, Danny, was elected president by a
two-to-one margin and took over the union's day-to-day
operations, as he was permitted to do under terms of the
trusteeship. He replaced the trustee-appointed business
agents with his own people, including his brother Michael.
"We're doing a good job here, and the members like us," Danny
Sciarra says. "The government don't belong here."</p>
<p>Some employers, too, are satisfied with the new
leadership. "I'd much rather deal with Sciarra's {business
agents} now than with the trustee's people," says Bill
Clifford, the president of St. Johnsbury Trucking Co. "The
Sciarra people are more knowledgeable."</p>
<p>Mr. Stier, who, as trustee, retains control of Local 560's
pension and welfare funds, says some people may be
disappointed by the election results. But he says the RICO
trusteeship has clearly had a positive effect. After all,
"this was the first contested election in 25 years."</p>
<p>What's more, the union's executive board recently asked
Mr. Stier -- to his surprise -- to become the permanent, paid
overseer of 560's pension and welfare funds after the union
trusteeship expires. According to Mr. Stier, union officials
told him they wanted to protect the funds from racketeering.
"To me, this is a behavioral change since the trusteeship,"
Mr. Stier says. "Regardless of motive, the executive board
did make the offer. There's hope that this board, left to its
own devices, can run this union effectively without control
by organized crime.</p>
<p>But Mr. Stier cautions: "It's a war of attrition. You're
trying to change values. The change will come about in small
increments."</p>
<p>In the meantime, Michael Sciarra has been removed as
business agent effective May 31 under a preliminary
injunction issued by Judge Dickinson Debevoise. The judge,
ruling on a Justice Department request, found that Michael
Sciarra's dominating presence inhibited the board from acting
independently.</p>
