	<p class="article-leader">When Soviet advance men visited Washington to plan this
week's summit between George Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev,
White House aides treated them to a night out at a Washington
Capitals hockey game.
   Sitting in a plush skybox at the Capital Centre sports
complex, the Soviets wolfed dozens of hot dogs, guzzled mixed
drinks and amused their hosts with a running critique of
American hockey. They also illustrated that U.S.-Soviet
relations have improved to the point that presidential aides
can have a rollicking good time planning a summit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Unfortunately, their bosses may not have quite as much fun
when they meet this week.</p>
<p>Publicly, the Bush-Gorbachev summit that begins Thursday
is sure to be hailed as a big success. That's largely because
the two leaders are expected to declare that they have agreed
on the major elements of a long-awaited treaty slashing
strategic nuclear arms.</p>
<p>But after those headlines are forgotten, this summit is
likely to be remembered for the sober and businesslike new
tone it sets in superpower relations and for how it shapes
the future of Europe. The honeymoon with Mr. Gorbachev is
over. Nuclear arms aside, the U.S. and Soviets are unhappily
bogged down in disputes over issues that constitute a higher
priority for both: reunification of Germany, conventional
arms cuts across Europe and the fate of the Baltic states.
These are the issues that will determine the face of
post-Cold War Europe.</p>
<p>Now, says Secretary of State James Baker, push is coming
to shove. "Moscow's willingness to make hard choices
internally and externally will affect the course and future"
of its relationship with Washington, he says. In particular,
the hopes raised at the Malta summit last December for broad
U.S.-Soviet economic cooperation have faded, and disagreement
over Lithuania has nearly eliminated the chances that trade
liberalization will be enacted at this summit.</p>
<p>"Both sides are likely to feel uneasy during the talks"
because of the new tensions, predicts Andrei Kortunov, a
political analyst at the U.S.A. and Canada Institute, a
Soviet government think tank in Moscow.</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev last week took steps to ease some of the
tension with Washington by telling Lithuania that it might be
able to negotiate its freedom within two years if it suspends
its declaration of independence. But it's far from certain
that such a trade-off is acceptable to Lithuania's leaders,
and Mr. Gorbachev has also threatened to tighten his grip on
the republic if his deal is refused.</p>
<p>As the Soviet leader slides deeper into domestic trouble,
Mr. Bush's ability to wrest concessions at the negotiating
table may be declining. The acute Soviet economic crisis, for
example, directly affects European troop talks because it
makes it harder for Mr. Gorbachev to bring the Red Army home:
The Soviets say they have neither houses nor jobs for
returning soldiers. The Soviet military is already
increasingly inclined to criticize him. Mr. Gorbachev will be
vulnerable to charges that he is giving away the store to the
Americans if he makes further concessions on the crucial
question of whether a united Germany can be part of the
Western military alliance. Moreover, his economic problems
are clearly more immense than any economic assistance from
Washington could remedy.</p>
<p>"I don't think our leverage was ever as great as we
thought it was," says Ed A. Hewett, a specialist on the
Soviet economy who recently returned from Moscow and has just
briefed President Bush. "We had a kind of illusion of great
leverage."</p>
<p>Over the weekend, Mr. Gorbachev's troubles took another
turn for the worse. A new government plan to raise the price
of bread and other goods set off a wave of panic buying in
cities throughout the Soviet Union. Mr. Gorbachev was forced
to go on television to try to calm the country's citizens.
And in Armenia, Soviet troops clashed with nationalists in
gun battles that left at least 21 people dead, and again
inflamed passions in the region.</p>
<p>While President Bush's domestic concerns aren't as
serious, he too feels new constraints. He's already under
attack from American conservatives for supposedly giving away
too much to Mr. Gorbachev in bargaining in the strategic arms
reduction talks, or START. "I think you're going to have some
real resistance in the U.S. to any START agreement," says
former defense secretary Harold Brown.</p>
<p>The generally hard line Mr. Gorbachev has pursued against
Lithuanian independence has tarnished his image in the U.S.,
making it harder for Mr. Bush to offer economic help. Mr.
Bush "will be split between the wish to support Gorbachev and
the understanding that the situation is changing," says Mr.
Kortunov. Yet since Malta, Mr. Bush has invested so much
political capital in Mr. Gorbachev that he may be able to do
little more than complain mildly about the Soviet leader's
tactics.</p>
<p>Of course, either president could pull a surprise out of
his hat. Some analysts, for instance, speculate that Mr.
Gorbachev may try to sidestep the disagreement over whether
Germany should be part of the Western alliance by proposing
that all Soviet and American troops and nuclear weapons be
yanked off German soil. Mr. Bush undoubtedly would say no;
such a scheme would undermine his plan to keep Germany in the
Western orbit. Nonetheless, simply making the offer could
bolster Mr. Gorbachev's image in Germany.</p>
<p>Similarly, some American analysts are urging the Bush
administration to take a bold step by offering Mr. Gorbachev
emergency economic relief -- with the firm understanding that
such help is contingent on rapid moves toward a market
economy and true democracy in the Soviet Union, and an end to
pressure on Lithuania. The administration's policy is that
the West shouldn't proffer the Soviets significant aid until
the Kremlin makes more fundamental economic reforms. But
there are now indications that U.S. officials nonetheless may
have discussed some possible aid -- in broad and vague terms
-- in recent meetings with the Soviets.</p>
<p>Without such surprises, public attention at the summit
will focus on Cold War-era arms-control issues that are of
declining importance in rapidly changing East-West relations.
In addition to the expected statement that they have nearly
finished a START agreement, Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev will
sign agreements to restrict nuclear testing and begin
destroying chemical weapons.</p>
<p>In the end, the ability of the U.S. and the Soviet Union
to go further may be determined partly by the personal
chemistry that emerges between Messrs. Gorbachev and Bush,
who have developed a good but tentative relationship. In many
ways, the two men are similar. Consummate products of their
nations' political systems, each spent two decades working up
the political ladder. Each is far more of a hands-on manager
than his predecessor. And each is excitable and competitive,
and has a readily apparent sense of humor.</p>
<p>At one point in the Malta summit, for instance, Mr.
Gorbachev pulled out a map showing the location of American
naval forces at sites all around the Soviet Union and said it
illustrated why the Soviets sometimes feel surrounded. Mr.
Bush wryly responded by asking whether he could show the map
to the Central Intelligence Agency to check the Soviets'
accuracy.</p>
<p>Yet there also are key differences in style that could
crimp this personal diplomacy. Mr. Gorbachev is given to
public flamboyance, while Mr. Bush is not. More notably, the
Soviet is a natural risk-taker, while the American prides
himself on his prudence.</p>
<p>Another difference bears directly on this week's meetings.
Mr. Bush likes to conduct business with world leaders in
informal recreational settings, where he thinks he gets a
truer measure of his counterpart. This session will be no
different: He initially wanted to take Mr. Gorbachev to his
Maine vacation home, but wound up settling for a Saturday
with the Soviet at the Camp David retreat near Washington.</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev doesn't seem to have much use for relaxed
settings. One U.S. official who has watched him at several
superpower summits says he has yet to see him remove his suit
coat or loosen his tie. "Gorbachev is a lot looser than any
Soviet leader we've ever seen before, but that's not saying
much," says Peter Teeley, a longtime Bush adviser. "The guy
has come light years from the Brezhnev mold, but there's
still a certain stiffness there."</p>
<p>The private summit talks the two men hold on Thursday,
Friday and Saturday could prove to be some of the most
important since Yalta. For as long as 14 hours, the two
leaders will discuss the future shape of Europe and the
Soviet Union itself. The most urgent and contentious of these
issues is the future of Germany.</p>
<p>East and West Germany are roaring toward political
unification. The U.S. and West Germany want the united German
state to be a full member of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, the Western military alliance. At least
publicly, Mr. Gorbachev remains hard set against that. Above
all he wants to avoid accusations that he has lost the Cold
War by allowing the World War II prize of Germany to slip
away for nothing.</p>
<p>A related Kremlin worry about Germany also appears to have
slowed negotiations on a sweeping new treaty cutting
conventional troops and arms in Europe. Mr. Gorbachev
apparently wants assurances that the new, unified German army
will be too small to threaten the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Thus, American officials say that Mr. Bush's top priority
at the summit will be persuading Mr. Gorbachev to back off on
these German-related issues. He will argue that the Soviets
should want a united Germany in NATO because that would
stabilize Europe, and that cutting the size of the new
Germany's armed forces will have to be decided as part of a
round of future troop cuts throughout Europe.</p>
<p>But even if he does agree to a Western-oriented united
Germany, Mr. Gorbachev may insist that, in return, he get
economic help from West Germany, some German demilitarization
and a new pan-European security organization to succeed NATO
and the Warsaw Pact. He may even push for a peace treaty
formally ending World War II, something the Germans fear
could be used to extract big economic concessions from them.</p>
<p>The Soviets "want to get a price" for letting go of East
Germany, says Dimitri Simes, an emigre Soviet scholar at the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "They want to be
sure it won't appear they are surrendering."</p>
<p>Thus it isn't surprising that Germany and rebellious
Lithuania are so dominant on the summit agenda. "The German
issue really involves whether the Soviet Union can continue
to be a superpower," says Stephen Sestanovich, a former
National Security Council staff member. "Lithuania involves
whether the Soviet Union can be a power at all."</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev's worsening domestic problems make the task
of resolving these issues more complicated than it was just
six months ago at the friendly Malta meeting. Soviet
economists now indicate privately that, rather than growing
sluggishly, the Soviet gross national product actually has
been shrinking by 2% to 4% for each of the last four years. A
new package of economic reforms proposed this month by the
Kremlin is widely considered too timid.</p>
<p>What's more, the Soviet Communist Party now is divided
into at least three factions. A formal split is likely to
take place at the Party's 28th Congress, which opens July 2.
Even Mr. Gorbachev's personal popularity is suffering. This
month he was elected a delegate to the party congress by
Communists in his home district -- but won just 61% of the
vote.</p>
<p>While these problems distract Mr. Gorbachev, a clearer
constraint on his bargaining freedom is his strained
relations with the Soviet military. In a recent article, Yuri
Katasonov, a retired colonel, summed up many of the
military's grievances about Mr. Gorbachev's arms-control
policies by charging that Mr. Gorbachev "is trying to
conclude agreements at any price."</p>
<p>The Soviet defense establishment already is struggling to
cope with the consequences of unilateral troop cuts Mr.
Gorbachev announced in 1988. A staggering 170,000 officers
and their families now have no permanent place to live,
according to the Soviet Defense Ministry. Clearly, the
military will be even unhappier if Mr. Gorbachev agrees to
more troop cuts in Europe.</p>
<p>"When our units are withdrawn from Eastern Europe, dozens
of thousands of families will find themselves in a similar
situation," grumbled one officer in a recent article in the
Soviet press.</p>
