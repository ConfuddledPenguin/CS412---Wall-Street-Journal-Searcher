	<p class="article-leader">The nation's manufacturers are buying machinery somewhat
more willingly than they did three months ago, machine tool
producers say. And there's no indication so far that even
small manufacturers are feeling a credit crunch, industry
executives add.
   U.S. machine tool plants in April received $289.5 million
of orders, a 19% rise from $242.6 million a year earlier,
according to the NMTBA -- The Association for Manufacturing
Technology , a McLean, Va., trade group. Last month's orders
were up 8.9% from March, and were 49% higher than February's
$194.6 million, this year's low.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Unlike March, when a big Soviet order bolstered the total,
the April rise resulted from increased ordering by U.S.
factories.</p>
<p>However, machine tool distributors, who handle
foreign-made machines as well as those produced in the U.S.,
reported a sharp drop in orders during April. An order index
published by the American Machine Tool Distributors'
Association, Rockville Pike, Md., dropped 27% from the
year-earlier month. The index is quite volatile, and the
March report was unusually strong, which suggests that the
April drop may result from an accidental bunching of orders
rather than the start of a downtrend.</p>
<p>Machine tools are complex part-making machines ranging
from computer-controlled lathes and machining centers to
metal-forming presses. Orders are a good indicator of
spending by durable-goods manufacturers because machine tools
shape most metal parts.</p>
<p>"Business is very good," said Stephen M. Peterson, vice
president, sales, for Giddings & Lewis Inc., Fond du Lac,
Wis. "We see some real confidence out there among our
customers."</p>
<p>Jet engine manufacturers, construction equipment concerns
and pump manufacturers have been ordering actively, Mr.
Peterson said. "We're getting some military business, though
not as much as last year, and there's quite a bit of activity
in the oil country" after a prolonged period when the oil
field equipment industry was dormant.</p>
<p>Also, Giddings & Lewis recently sold two
computer-controlled manufacturing cells in the Far East, one
in Singapore and the other in Taiwan, he said. Cells consist
of several machine tools served by automated
materials-handling equipment and controlled by a computer
that can make a variety of parts without a human operator.</p>
<p>"Our second quarter is better than the first," said Donald
D. Bowers, president of Leblond Makino Machine Tool Co.,
Mason, Ohio. "Companies committed to long-term objectives" in
improving productivity and product quality "are ordering
equipment to carry out those programs," he added. But other
companies that base their equipment buying on the immediate
business outlook are holding back.</p>
<p>Auto companies and auto suppliers remain a weak spot, said
Harold J. Winch, president of Minster Machine Co., a major
producer of stamping presses in Minster, Ohio. "They're
weighing a lot of decisions right now, including plastic
versus metal parts, government fuel economy standards, clean
air legislation and next year's auto sales outlook." Until
they hash out those decisions, auto concerns are deferring
some capital spending decisions.</p>
<p>Machine tool producers frequently sell to small machine
shops, which would be among the marginal borrowers denied
loans in a credit crunch. So far, at least, that doesn't
appear to be happening, machine tool executives say.</p>
<p>"I haven't seen any evidence of a credit crunch," said
Minster Machine's Mr. Winch. "A company with a decent balance
sheet doesn't have any more trouble getting a loan" than it
did last year.</p>
<p>There has been concern that banks would tighten lending
standards following the high loan losses sustained by banks
and thrifts, and the resulting closer scrutiny of bank loan
portfolios by government regulators. There's been some
tightening on real estate development lending, but
manufacturing has been affected relatively little so far.</p>
<p>"There is no evidence of a credit crisis . . . nor is
there much reason to expect one," said Gail D. Fosler, chief
economist for the Conference Board, a New York business and
economic research group. The slower growth in bank loans
results from lower loan demand in a slow-growing economy
rather than more stringent lending standards, she said.</p>
<p>April orders for lathes, grinders, milling machines,
machining centers, boring mills and other machines that shape
metal parts by cutting rose 35% to $206.9 million from $152.8
million a year earlier. However, April 1989 was the first
month of an order slowdown by the auto industry, after 18
months of active buying, making for an easier comparison.
Nonetheless, the latest month's orders were up 8.9% from
March's $198.2 million, despite the inclusion in March of a
$38 million Soviet order received by Cross & Trecker Corp.,
Bloomfield Hills, Mich.</p>
<p>Orders last month for metal-forming presses and other
machines to shape metal with pressure were $82.6 million, the
NMTBA said, down 8% from the year-earlier month's $89.8
million, but up 22% from $67.7 million in March.</p>
<p>Shipments of all types of machine tools by domestic plants
totaled $258.2 million, a 3.5% rise from $249.6 million in
April 1989.</p>
