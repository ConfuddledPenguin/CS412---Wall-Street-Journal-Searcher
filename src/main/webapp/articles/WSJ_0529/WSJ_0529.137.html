	<p class="article-leader">MALVERN, Pa. -- Vishay Intertechnology Inc. made a
friendly tender offer valued at about $52 million to acquire
Crystalate Holdings PLC, topping a hostile offer of about $47
million by TT Group PLC.
   Crystalate, a U.K.-based maker of resistors and automotive
sensors, issued a brief statement advising its shareholders
to take no action for the time being.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the statement, Crystalate said its board believes there
would be "considerable logic" in combining its operations
with Vishay's. But the company also indicated that it wants a
higher offer.</p>
<p>Vishay's chairman and chief executive officer, Felix
Zandman, said he held talks last week with Crystalate
officials, who had originally asked Vishay in April to make a
competing bid for the company. He didn't indicate whether
Vishay would be willing to increase its offer.</p>
<p>Mr. Zandman said Salomon Brothers International Ltd. is
making the tender offer on behalf of Vishay, a maker of
resistors, sensors and strain gages. The bid isn't being made
to any U.S. citizen or to anyone residing in the U.S., he
said.</p>
<p>Terms call for Crystalate holders to receive 80 pence in
cash for each of the 32 million ordinary shares outstanding
and 55 pence for each 5.6% cumulative preference share.</p>
<p>Instead of cash, holders may elect to receive one Vishay
common share for every 14 Crystalate ordinary shares.
However, the option of exchanging stock is limited to 1.5
million newly issued Vishay common shares. The stock swap
would cover about 60% of the proposed transaction, Mr.
Zandman said. Vishay has about 12 million shares outstanding.</p>
<p>The proposed merger, if successful, would strengthen
Vishay's operating base in Europe and would boost
significantly the company's market share in the U.S.</p>
<p>Vishay supplies Crystalate with resistor chips and other
products for distribution and resale. In addition, two
Crystalate units have a combined 10.4% share of the U.S.
market for fixed resistors; Vishay already has a 33% share of
that market. For the year ended Sept. 30, 1989, Crystalate
had sales of about $180 million.</p>
<p>TT Group officials were unavailable to comment on the
Vishay bid.</p>
