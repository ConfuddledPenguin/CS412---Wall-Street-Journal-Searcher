	<p class="article-leader">John W. Henry, who manages more than $260 million in
commodity futures markets, has no illusions about his line of
work. "It's an ugly way to make money," he says.
   By that, he means putting your money in the hands of a
successful commodity trading adviser, such as himself, isn't
a no-sweat limousine ride to the bank. It just looks that
way: One of the pools he runs out of his Westport, Conn.,
firm has compound annual returns of 77% in the past six
years; his five other pools have averaged 32% a year in their
lifetimes. Only a few other commodity trading advisers with
as much money to manage as Mr. Henry have returns in the same
league.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Such performance figures are tempting to investors who are
looking for big-return opportunities now that the high-yield
junk bond market has tanked and the jackpots from takeover
plays have all but disappeared from the stock market. Most
investors quickly learn that futures-market profits of any
size are hard to come by without their full-time attention,
which is why many are turning their fast-action money over to
trading advisers.</p>
<p>Only then do they realize they're not in the hands of a
kindly bank trust officer but often in those of a
damn-the-torpedoes commando hellbent for glory. To endure the
wild ride in volatile futures markets, they need stoic
patience, a strong stomach and the ability to sleep when
their accounts are substantially under water.</p>
<p>Skeptical? Consider Mr. Henry's International Foreign
Exchange pool, which invests in currency futures and options.
Since it was launched in March 1986, it has generated a
compounded annual return of 30%, a number considered more
than respectable in the world of managed futures. But suppose
you didn't buy in until the end of May 1989, when it had
risen 14% from three months earlier. Four months later the
pool was down 52% from its May value. Today, that pool
remains 35% below the May 1989 level.</p>
<p>Most, but not all, investors who have let Mr. Henry trade
for them for at least a couple of years have done well. He
acknowledges that he frequently receives phone calls from
shellshocked new investors after sharp declines in their
accounts, called "drawdowns" by trading advisers.</p>
<p>"I always tell them the truth, with no sugarcoating, by
explaining to them that we are always dealing with the
unknown," Mr. Henry says. He used to have a lot of clients
who pulled out of the pools after bad drawdowns, he says, but
"most of them now just close their eyes and wait for the good
times."</p>
<p>Barclay Trading Group Ltd. of Fairfield, Iowa, which
tracks 121 commodity trading advisers with at least $5
million under management, places Mr. Henry's six pools among
the top third in terms of returns. But he's also in the third
with the sharpest drawdowns.</p>
<p>Mr. Henry was introduced to the futures market in 1976
when he was operating a couple of family-owned farms near
Quincy, Ill. He was advised to sell a soybean futures
contract to hedge the value of his crop against a price
decline. He bought a contract instead, because he "just knew"
that soybean prices were going to rise, which made him a
speculator. As luck had it, soybean prices rose and he bought
more contracts on the way up.</p>
<p>"By pure luck I sold out my futures contracts at the exact
top of the market and the next day sold my cash crop out at
the top," he recalls. His first experience in the futures
market netted a profit of $75,000.</p>
<p>Though the day would come, only four years later, that he
lost $75,000 in a single day in soybean futures, Mr. Henry
was hooked. After researching 100 years of commodity prices
at the library, he fashioned what he calls a "mechanistic"
trading strategy. It is essentially a long-range, trend --
following trading system that he has been using since 1981,
when he started managing other people's money.</p>
<p>Mr. Henry's system is always in the market, which means
he's either buying futures, expecting the price to rise, or
selling them short in anticipation of a price decline. His
various pools trade over 50 markets, some of which he has
combined into unusual if not unique hybrids. For example, Mr.
Henry trades gold not only in dollars but also in yen and
marks.</p>
<p>Trading systems that follow long-haul price moves either
up or down typically join and leave the trends late. This
type of trading is particularly frustrating to new investors,
who see their accounts miss substantial profits at the
beginning of trends and give back a portion of profits before
the trends are abandoned. And when markets meander without
any long-term direction, such trading systems can generate a
string of losses. For example, Mr. Henry says, "In 1989 in
one of our pools we had 33 losses out of 34 trades, and the
one winner was a small one."</p>
<p>Mr. Henry has learned to suppress his own feelings about
markets and let his trading system make the calls. He recalls
that in 1985 the system called for buying coffee futures. "I
thought it crazy," he says. "The international coffee
agreement that attempts to control the supply of coffee had
collapsed. The freeze season was over in Brazil. There was
just too much coffee around. I just knew we were in for one
of our standard losses of 2% of account equity."</p>
<p>But he took the plunge anyway, and the system worked for a
while; an account with $1 million in equity at one point had
$1.2 million in paper profits. But it was a white-knuckle
experience. "When an account's equity fluctuates $100,000 a
day as that one did, nobody is happy," Mr. Henry says. "The
client wants you to get out at the top, but I don't know
where the top is." He says he finally sold out at a $700,000
profit for his client.</p>
<p>Last year wasn't good for most of his pools, but he says
the first quarter of 1990 was one of the best he ever had.
"We were short the Japanese yen, and the German, French and
Japanese bond markets. They all collapsed in
once-in-a-lifetime moves."</p>
<p>Commodity markets aren't Mr. Henry's only interest. He
owns part of two baseball teams, the Tucson Toros and the
West Palm Beach Tropics. The Tropics are one of the senior
league teams for players age 35 and older. "They're great
investments and I love baseball," says Mr. Henry.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:</p>
<p>Grains & Soybeans</p>
<p>Though President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev will dominate headlines with their summit meeting
this week, analysts don't expect announcements with major
impact for grain futures. It's widely acknowledged among
traders that the Soviet Union won't be granted
most-favored-nation status this week, partly because of
lingering emigration restrictions for Soviet Jews. Favored
status probably won't come until the Soviets remove the
restrictions, said Daniel W. Basse, director of market
research for AgResource Co., Chicago. Mr. Gorbachev's U.S.
visit begins tomorrow.</p>
<p>Weather, on the the other hand, will continue to dominate
traders' attention. Heavier-than-normal rain in many parts of
the Midwest continues to delay planting of corn. Because corn
takes longer to grow than soybeans, the rain delay could
force corn farmers to switch to soybeans. In Illinois, one
rule of thumb is to make the switch after June 5. If weather
continues to be soggy this week, traders expect continuing
strength in corn futures prices, which rose firmly late last
week on speculation that fewer-than-expected acres would be
planted with corn.</p>
<p>Energy</p>
<p>This is the time of the year that thoughts of oil traders
turn to gasoline. Memorial Day traditionally launches the
so-called driving season, and the direction of petroleum
prices often depends on the level of gasoline demand. But
some oil analysts aren't very excited about this year's
prospects.</p>
<p>Last year gasoline was "the dynamo that drove up oil
prices," but 1990 demand for motor fuel has been "basically
flat," said Nauman Barakat, a first vice president of
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. Because of gasoline's indicated
sluggishness in the U.S. as well as the world crude oil glut
resulting from high output by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, Mr. Barakat expects petroleum prices to
remain under pressure into the third quarter.</p>
<p>Still, gasoline futures prices have shown surprising
strength even after crude oil prices began eroding earlier
this year. Among the reasons have been relatively low
operations of refineries. There have been shutdowns of
several refineries from accidents or for prolonged
maintenance. This has meant some hints of tight supplies for
some grades. Unlike burdensome crude oil inventories,
gasoline in storage in the U.S. still is below last year's
level. According to the industry's latest weekly count, U.S.
inventories of gasoline totaled 213.2 million barrels, down
from 215 million barrels a week earlier and 221.3 million a
year earlier.</p>
