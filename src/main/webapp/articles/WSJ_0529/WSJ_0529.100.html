	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Denison Mines Ltd., which is already trying to
sell its oil and gas assets, said it may have to put other
noncore assets on the block to meet its financial
obligations.
   Helen Roman-Barber, chairman and chief executive officer,
told the annual meeting that the company's plan to sell its
overseas oil and gas assets has "proved to be a difficult"
task.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Denison sold its Canadian oil and gas properties last
November for 44.6 million Canadian dollars (US$37.7 million).
Ms. Roman-Barber declined to place a value on the remaining
assets, which are in Spain, Egypt, Italy and Greece.</p>
<p>"We are dealing with the prospect that the oil and gas
divestiture program may not provide us with sufficient funds
to meet our financial obligations," she said.</p>
<p>The company has about C$316 million in debt and faces
payments of C$31 million this year and C$86 million in 1991.
It also will need about C$175 million next March to retract
its Series B preferred shares. The company has the option to
pay stock for the shares, but Ms. Roman-Barber said Denison
hopes to be able to pay cash.</p>
<p>The company decided in 1989 to concentrate on its uranium
operations. But uranium prices are at all-time lows, and
Denison had a first-quarter loss of C$4.8 million, or 15
Canadian cents a share.</p>
<p>On the Toronto Stock Exchange Friday, the company's Class
B shares fell one Canadian cent at C$1.13, well off the
issue's 52-week high of C$5.375.</p>
<p>The company continues to have interests in potash and coal
mining, though it wrote off its entire interest in its only
remaining coal operation in 1986.</p>
<p>Jake Fowler, president and chief operating officer,
wouldn't say which assets might be sold. "We like the potash
business very much, but our core business is uranium," he
said.</p>
<p>Mr. Fowler also said the company won't pay dividends on
its common shares until "we're generating sufficient cash."
Denison doesn't have a set dividend policy. Previous payment
was a stock dividend in Class B shares equal to 24 Canadian
cents in Febuary 1989.</p>
