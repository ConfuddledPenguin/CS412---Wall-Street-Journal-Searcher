	<p class="article-leader">ST. LOUIS -- LA, an Anheuser-Busch Cos. beer whose name
was an abbreviation for "low alcohol," now also stands for
"little acceptance."
   The brewer said it was turning off the brand's spigot
after a disappointing six-year marketing effort. The first of
several beers with about half the alcohol content of regular
beers, LA was an attempt to slake the thirst of those who
liked beer but wanted to reduce their alcohol intake.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But that consumer niche apparently is miniscule. Industry
estimates put Anheuser's LA production last year at only
about 20,000 barrels -- so small that the company didn't even
mention the brand in its latest annual report.</p>
<p>Analysts said the beer market has evolved into an
all-or-none situation, where drinkers either want regular
beer or beer with no alcohol at all. To meet the latter
niche, Anheuser recently introduced O'Doul's, a
premium-priced non-alcoholic brew.</p>
