	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- When designer Bill Robinson started selling his
classy men's sportswear in Japan last year, he had to do two
things he'd never done before: offer a line of cotton sweat
shirts, and abandon his commitment to the understated by
stitching a tiny logo on the chest.
   "This will be an eye-catcher," says Toru Hatori, a
spokesman for Kindwear Corp., a Tokyo apparel maker producing
the clothes under license. "It's certainly necessary for the
Japanese market," he adds, where showing the name is what
counts.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Japanese consumers have tastes and needs in fashion that
often puzzle American retailers. Teen-agers snap up
Philadelphia Phillies jerseys, though many have never heard
of the team. Outmoded U.S. brands such as Pinky & Dianne
become a fad among secretaries. Many Japanese dress up even
on weekends, shopping at department stores in suits and
dresses. But in the summer, Japanese bankers and brokers
think nothing of working in short-sleeved dress shirts.</p>
<p>Figuring out local preferences may well be worthwhile.
Young Japanese in particular are increasingly seeking foreign
brands, influenced by detailed articles on them in such
fashion magazines as "Fineboys." As Japan's huge apparel
market -- in which designer brands alone account for annual
sales of two trillion yen ($13 billion) -- welcomes more U.S.
names, American companies face a growing opportunity.</p>
<p>One key to successful marketing in Japan is to emblazon
products with a name. Logos, slapped onto anything from
umbrellas to socks to toilet seat covers, can never be too
obvious. Michiko Koshino, a London-based Japanese casual wear
designer, says one of the best-selling items in her business,
which has annual sales of three billion yen, is a winter
jacket whose entire back is covered with her logo, Michiko
London Koshino, in thick capital letters. The names don't
even have to make sense: Other popular Japanese logos include
Posh Boy, Papas and Pink House.</p>
<p>Many Japanese have a tremendous fondness for Americana,
which offers companies easy promotional strategies. Levi
Strauss & Co.'s Japanese subsidiary saw its sales soar after
launching an advertising campaign 12 years ago that claimed
James Dean, Marilyn Monroe and John Wayne all wore Levi's
jeans. In 1978, only 6% of Japanese identified Levi's as a
preferred brand in surveys, but the figure shot up to 51%
last year, the company says.</p>
<p>Of course, appealing to the Japanese also requires some
subtle tactics. Consumers crowd the streets dressed in
surprisingly similar clothes, and yet many like to feel
they're picking out something exclusive. Japanese retailers
say they address this problem by displaying only a few items
at a time in the same size and color, though more are in
stock.</p>
<p>Quality is one area in which, in the eyes of Japanese
consumers, many U.S. companies still could stand to improve.
An official at a Japanese apparel maker says he recently
rejected a high-priced American T-shirt because he found that
the seams had little stitching holes when he stretched the
shirt. Japanese consumers "expect high-quality items to
include hidden effort, even in areas that don't show," says
the official, who asked not to be identified. "Whether that's
really necessary is a different matter."</p>
<p>But sometimes, American retailers can attract consumers by
being just plain American, according to retail conglomerate
Aeon Group. The company, which a few years ago bought Talbots
Inc., a Hingham, Mass., women's clothing retailer, made its
Tokyo store look exactly like its U.S. stores. It imports
conservative linen dresses in colors so bright that most
Tokyo retailers would immediately tone them down. But the
store's sales are strong enough that the 200 million yen
sales projection for this year may have to be upgraded, says
Motoya Okada, president of Talbots's Japanese operation.
"We're selling more than we thought," he says.</p>
