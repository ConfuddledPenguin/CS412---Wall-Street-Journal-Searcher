	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Restaurant diners seem more finicky than ever
these days.
   They still want something different. But they don't want
to take too many risks, at least compared with diners of a
few years ago. And compared with a few years ago, they're
more tightfisted.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That was the message some experts offered restaurateurs at
the annual National Restaurant Association convention here
last week. The thousands who attended work in a notoriously
difficult industry dominated by small business. Most sought
ideas that can give them an edge in a field where so many
fail.</p>
<p>They searched the massive McCormick Place exhibition halls
for suppliers of fresher, more nutritious items, grazing as
they went. They tried out equipment designed to cut
preparation time. They observed chefs racing through culinary
contests -- and stole their menu ideas.</p>
<p>But more than anything, they sought clues to understanding
the wily consumer. Some listened to Barbara R. Caplan, vice
president of Yankelovich Clancy Shulman, a Westport, Conn.,
market research firm, who described today's consumers as,
paradoxically, seekers of "safe adventure."</p>
<p>As in the 1980s, consumers still desire new experiences,
but they feel less need to be trendy, she said. Rather, they
demand novelty within a familiar framework -- and don't want
their sensibilities jarred. They'll try, for instance, a new
restaurant if the chef is familiar.</p>
<p>In a backlash to the opulent, risk-seeking '80s, consumers
now are dollar-conscious and risk-averse. They insist more
than ever on quality food, service and atmosphere but don't
want to pay top dollar, Ms. Caplan said. And they're more
mindful of their own social image in selecting eating places,
afraid someone may say, "You chose this dump?"</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Restaurant owners had an eye out for solutions to common
problems. Robert Schimmel, a restaurateur in York, Pa.,
dreamed of a way to keep tabs on his diners' needs while the
waiter is away. "Somebody always wants something when you're
not there," he says.</p>
<p>While strolling among exhibitors' booths at the show, Mr.
Schimmel stumbled on an answer to his problem: a call light
for the diner's table. The gadget, dubbed a Waiter Lite, has
a button on its base that activates a light at the end of a
clear plastic wand. There's an optional water vase to hold
fresh flowers that slips over the wand.</p>
<p>The device's inventor, Stephen Hauser, said his company,
Roher Industries Inc., Santa Ana, Calif., started selling the
devices earlier this year at a base price of $24.95. Mr.
Schimmel said he'd buy 48.</p>
<p>However, Michael E. Hurst, president of the National
Restaurant Association and a restaurant owner himself, says
he wonders whether use of call lights might actually make a
staff less attentive.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>American Express Co. used the convention to launch a
sweepstakes promotion that it says will help restaurant
owners reward employees for good service. It is the company's
latest salvo in the intensifying battle for restaurant
credit-card business.</p>
<p>Predictably enough, the promotion requires diners to pay
their bills on their American Express cards. In addition,
they must fill out a portion of a sweepstakes brochure,
praising an employee for good service, then mail it to
American Express. The employee fills out another part of the
brochure and sends it in.</p>
<p>The grand prize for the employee submitting the most
entries is $10,000. The top prize in a drawing for card
holders is a food-and-wine trip through the French
countryside. Restaurants that card holders cite most
frequently for good service will be awarded with ads touting
them.</p>
<p>Not everyone loves the promotion. Spencer Nilson,
publisher of the Nilson Report, a credit-card industry
newsletter, called it "a dumb idea." He wondered why American
Express, which has long marketed a prestige name, would sully
that image by trying to encourage somebody to enter a
sweepstakes. But he noted that the high price of American
Express cards is "hurting" the company in the marketplace and
he complimented it for trying anything to boost card usage.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Restaurant owners fed up with cooking everything
themselves found hope at the convention. Among many
exhibitors pushing products to ease the restaurateur's load,
Vie de France Corp. touted its new entry into the market for
precooked menu items, prepared using a controversial method
called "sous vide."</p>
<p>The Alexandria, Va., company recently joined other U.S.
sous vide processors by opening a plant to produce the items.
In the sous vide process, popular in France, fresh food is
sealed in special pouches, cooked at low temperature in
water, then refrigerated until it's reheated and served. Vie
de France also offers a frozen version of the products.</p>
<p>Harve A. Elsea, owner of a French-American restaurant in
Arlington Heights, Ill., said he may order from Vie de
France's new line, because the precooked, prepackaged foods
would better control portion sizes and cut labor costs.</p>
<p>However, federal regulators remain mindful of the dangers
of food contamination that theoretically could result from
faulty processing. No known cases of botulism have resulted
from the sous vide method so far, says an analyst at the
federal Food and Drug Adminstration. And the agency permits
processors, such as Vie de France, to use the process,
assuming they pass inspection. But it advises state and local
health authorities to prohibit restaurant cooks from making
their own sous vide products.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Cooking contests drew crowds of restaurateurs at the
convention. For professional chefs, a top honor is a gold
medal at the international Culinary Olympics in Frankfurt,
West Germany.</p>
<p>Thanks to a strong showing in elimination rounds for the
1992 U.S. team at the convention, Franz Poepperl, a Portland,
Ore., chef, will have a shot at the gold.</p>
<p>But the meal he prepared was far from perfect. The chef
himself admitted, "I overcooked my roast." Overall though,
his skills impressed the judges -- and they expect he'll
sharpen up in time for 1992.</p>
