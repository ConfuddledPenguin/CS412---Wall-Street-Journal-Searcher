	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- The average unemployment rate among the 11
leading industrialized countries eased to 5.9% in March from
6% in February, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development said.
   The organization said jobless rates declined in nine of
the countries, with the most significant drops in Canada, the
Netherlands and Australia.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The OECD average unemployment rate in this year's first
quarter was 6%, down from 5.8% a year earlier. But the
jobless rate has remained roughly unchanged since mid-1989.
European unemployment rates, however, have eased about 0.5%
on average, compared with a year earlier, with the greatest
declines in West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Britain.</p>
<p>The organization said April unemployment rose slightly in
four of the six countries for which data are available.</p>
