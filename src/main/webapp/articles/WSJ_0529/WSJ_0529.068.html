	<p class="article-leader">HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Chrysler Corp. agreed to pay $2.9
million to settle allegations that its Electrospace Systems
Inc. unit overcharged the government in contracts before
being acquired by the auto maker in 1987.
   Also, four top officials of Richardson, Texas-based
Electrospace resigned last week. Chrysler maintains the
departures were unrelated to the settlement, although a
government prosecutor says the moves were related.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"There's nothing in the settlement at all that is
conditional with employment changes," said John Stellman,
chief financial officer at Chrysler Technologies, the
subsidiary that includes Electrospace. A government
prosecutor, while declining to mention names, said the
government wouldn't have approved the settlement unless
Chrysler agreed "to remove the officers involved in the
allegations."</p>
<p>Marvin Collins, U.S. attorney for the northern district of
Texas, added, "We typically don't allow a contractor to
insulate the people involved."</p>
<p>The allegations involved hundreds of government contracts
handled by Electrospace Systems between 1978 and 1987, said
Ronald Eddins, an assistant U.S. attorney in the northern
district of Texas. Many of the contracts were for electronics
installed in U.S. Air Force planes, including one contract
for Air Force One, the plane used to transport the president.</p>
<p>The government contends that Electrospace used a
subcontractor to do much of the work and then billed the
government as if the work had been performed by Electrospace
itself. "Instead of doing the work themselves, they had (the
subcontractor) using less-skilled labor at a lower cost,
increasing the profit to themselves," Mr. Eddins said.</p>
<p>Chrysler characterized the issue as a "price dispute" and
added that the civil settlement contained no admission of
"improprieties" by Electrospace.</p>
<p>Mr. Collins, the Texas U.S. attorney, said the government
had conducted a criminal investigation before agreeing to the
settlement. "We didn't find a case that could be successfully
prosecuted before a jury," he said.</p>
<p>The settlement is a "global settlement," meaning that the
government won't seek criminal prosecution in the case. The
$2.9 million settlement is roughly twice the amount the
government contends it was overcharged from 1985 to 1987, Mr.
Eddins said. The government was unable to seek restitution
for contracts before 1985 because of a five-year statute of
limitations.</p>
<p>Chrysler recently dropped plans to sell Electrospace and
two other units of Chrysler Technologies because it couldn't
find a buyer. "Chrysler settled to avoid the cost and
disruption of a long dispute," Mr. Stellman said. "The
settlement allows Electrospace management to concentrate on
the main thrust of our business."</p>
<p>The officials leaving Electrospace included Electrospace
President Robert Carrel and former Chairman James Lightner,
who was still an Electrospace director at the time of his
departure. Mr. Stellman said the officials left because their
three-year employment contracts, signed when Chrysler bought
the company, had expired.</p>
