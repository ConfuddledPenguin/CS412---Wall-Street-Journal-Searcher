	<p class="article-leader">Avery International Corp. and Dennison Manufacturing Co.
agreed to merge in a stock swap with an indicated value of
$456 million that would create one of the nation's largest
office-products concerns with $2.5 billion in annual sales.
   The successor company, Avery Dennison Corp., would be
dominated by the board of Avery International and based at
its corporate offices in Pasadena, Calif. Besides marker
pens, stationery and other office supplies, Avery Dennison
would sell self-adhesive materials, product fasteners, and
printing and labeling systems.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the agreement, approved by the boards of both
companies last week, Dennison shareholders would receive 1.12
shares of Avery common stock for each share held of Dennison
common.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
Dennison shares jumped $8.375 to $27.375 on turnover of 1.7
million shares. Avery shares fell $2.25 to $26.25; 1.8
million shares changed hands. Dennison has 15.5 million
shares outstanding; Avery has 44.2 million shares
outstanding.</p>
<p>Avery and Dennison described the transaction as a
"strategic merger" of companies with "complementary"
products. Dennison, based in Framingham, Mass., is stronger
in certain East Coast markets, while Avery is stronger in the
Midwest and on the West Coast. About 35% of Avery Dennison's
sales would be in overseas markets that are growing more
quickly than domestic ones.</p>
<p>Charles D. Miller, Avery chairman and chief executive
officer, would retain those titles at Avery Dennison. The
merger would create a strong global competitor on the eve of
the integration of the European Community in 1992, he said.
Avery Dennison also would be a "more important supplier" to a
growing group of office-supply superstores.</p>
<p>The emergence of superstores such as Staples Inc., which
sells stationery goods at big discounts, has put strong
downward pressure on wholesale office-supply prices. Because
of this trend, there will be more consolidations like the
Avery-Dennison deal, analysts said. Some of the two
companies' biggest competitors are Minnesota Mining &
Manufacturing Co. in St. Paul, Minn.; Esselte AB of
Stockholm, Sweden, and American Brands Inc., Greenwich, Conn.</p>
<p>The chairmen of Dennison and Avery have known each other
for 15 years. Mr. Miller said he proposed a merger with
Dennison in 1987 that fell apart at the last minute over
price and "organization structure." The latest talks were
initiated by Dennison in March, Mr. Miller said.</p>
<p>Nelson S. Gifford, Dennison chairman and chief executive
officer, would become vice chairman of Avery Dennison. The
board would include Avery's 12 current directors and four
Dennison directors. The combined companies would have 19,000
employees, of which more than one-quarter would be overseas.</p>
<p>Analysts generally agreed that the companies are a good
fit, but some of them worried that Dennison's problems might
rub off on Avery. "Conceptually {the merger} makes sense;
making it work is a completely different ballgame," said
David Nelson, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. Avery
could have trouble integrating Dennison, which is
restructuring, he said.</p>
<p>Last December, citing "a rapid slowdown" in its domestic
orders, Dennison announced a plan to cut costs by $10 million
annually. By the end of the first quarter, Dennison had let
go 400 employees, or 4% of its work force. As conditions
continued to deteriorate, the company said it would
re-evaluate its assets for possible downsizing.</p>
<p>For the year ended Dec. 31, 1989, Dennison's profit
plunged 24% to $29.1 million, or $1.82 a share, from $37.2
million, or $2.35 a share, the prior year. Its 1989 sales
edged up to $770.9 million from $721.8 million the year
before. Reflecting its lackluster earnings, Dennison's stock
price has declined from a 52-week high of $32.875.</p>
<p>Avery sales rose 10% to $1.73 billion from $1.58 billion
for the year ended Nov. 30, 1989. Net income increased 11% to
$86.5 million, or $1.96 a share, from $77.7 million, or $1.77
a share.</p>
<p>If the merger is completed, Avery management said it would
recommend a quarterly cash dividend of 18 cents a share.
Avery currently pays a quarterly per-share dividend of 16
cents, or 64 cents a year. Dennison pays an annual dividend
of $1.32 a share.</p>
<p>The merger is subject to shareholder and regulatory
approvals, but analysts doubted that antitrust or other
obstacles would emerge. Certain Avery affiliates and employee
benefit plans expected to approve the merger hold about 25%
of Avery shares. Dennison directors and officers and an
employee stock ownership trust expected to vote for the deal
own about 20% of Dennison's stock. Mr. Miller said he hoped
the merger could be completed by the end of September.</p>
