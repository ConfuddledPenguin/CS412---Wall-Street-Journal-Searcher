	<p class="article-leader">A generation ago we built a national consensus for a new
direction on race relations. But today that consensus is
under unprecedented pressure. There have been too many
reported racial "incidents" on U.S. campuses, neighborhood
agitators now boycott Asian grocery stores, and racially
motivated taunts, beatings and even shootings are on the
rise.
   Amid this, President Bush is told by the most familiar
civil-rights organizations that if he vetoes the proposed
Civil Rights Act of 1990 it "would unleash a firestorm of
protest." The NAACP's Ben Hooks says the bill is a "litmus
test" of President Bush's support for blacks. Perhaps this
issue no longer holds the simple clarity that Mr. Hooks sees.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In practice, it is very likely that this bill would
exacerbate race relations. That is because the bill is rooted
in the paradoxical notion that the way to lessen racial
tensions is to encourage many lawsuits. How could anyone
truly believe such a thing?</p>
<p>Litigation by its nature is bitter and divisive. Lawsuits
exaggerate differences, forcing people to take extreme sides
in the hothouse atmosphere of courtrooms. President Bush said
recently that it would be a mistake to sign a bill that is
"some lawyers' bonanza, encouraging litigation at the expense
of conciliation, mediation or settlement." He is right.</p>
<p>The litigation this bill has in mind is different from the
important and necessary court opinions of the 1960s that
ensured desegregation, voting rights and equal opportunity.
Instead, the current bill will use litigation to effectively
mandate quotas.</p>
<p>Its sponsors are too politically sensitive to use the word
"quota," but the bill's mechanics would drive the system
toward that end. Setting aside due process, it creates a
presumption of an employer's guilt. An employer who is sued
will be guilty of "discrimination" unless he can explain the
existence of any "disparate impact" in hiring by race and
sex. The explanation must prove that employment practices
such as requirements and tests must have what the current
compromise language calls a "substantial and demonstrable
relationship to effective job performance." No one knows what
this means.</p>
<p>Civil Rights Commission Chairman Arthur Fletcher assures
that the result will be "goals" and not "quotas." We have 20
years of Supreme Court cases describing how goals became
unconstitutional quotas. This was true even without the
innovations of this bill -- such as that there should be jury
trials with punitive damages. It hardly seems prudent to set
off an explosion of litigation by contingency-fee lawyers now
to test the bill's vague wording.</p>
<p>Without meaning to be at all frivolous about the bill's
least desirable effects, it would not be too much to call it
the Alton Maddox Bill. Mr. Maddox is the black New York City
lawyer who, with the Rev. Al Sharpton, was at the center of
the racially inflammatory Tawana Brawley case. This past
week, attorney Maddox and his associate C. Vernon Mason, also
a lawyer, were making further contributions to New York's
current anguish over race relations.</p>
<p>Speaking of Mayor David Dinkins's attempts to heal the
city, Mr. Maddox said, "Any black man who advocates racial
harmony is out of his mind." Mr. Mason likened Mr. Dinkins to
former South African President P.W. Botha. (It is one of
history's ironies that this Maddox shares the same surname
with the famous racial inflamer of the 1960s, Georgia
Governor Lester Maddox.)</p>
<p>Is there any reason to believe that Messrs. Maddox and
Mason would not use the bill's irreparably flawed provisions
to drive the flames higher? It is not enough for proponents
to simply wave away this concern, because attorneys Maddox
and Mason, and others like them, are obviously manipulating
the current system to unwind much of the racial tolerance
that is one of the civil-rights movement's greatest
achievements.</p>
<p>(And why, we wish someone would ask them, does Congress
plan to exempt itself from the bill's coverage?)</p>
<p>Perhaps it's time to consider that civil rights today has
more pressing needs than endless litigation and debate over
goals vs. quotas. Civil rights now ought to be about ridding
poor neighborhoods of crime and crack, keeping families
intact, and improving schools. Any serious civil-rights bill
would abolish -- as this one does not -- the employer
sanctions in the immigration bill, which force employers to
discriminate against Hispanics who are here legally just to
avoid possible criminal liability.</p>
<p>We suspect that one reason President Bush's popularity
among blacks is so high is that everyone can sense that he
has genuine good will and concern for minorities. Indeed, we
think most Americans feel this way. The bill's supporters
ought to bear some burden for explaining why its obvious
incentives to litigate will not cause further bitterness and
divisiveness, while the real problems that beset the poorest
black Americans fester on.</p>
