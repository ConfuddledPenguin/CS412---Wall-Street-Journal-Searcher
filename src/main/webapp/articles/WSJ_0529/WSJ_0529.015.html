	<p class="article-leader">Michael Herr was six or seven years old when he enlisted
in the great American army of Walter Winchell recruits. He
read him faithfully, even obsessively, in his hometown
morning paper, the Syracuse (N.Y.) Post Standard, one of
1,000 dailies that carried Winchell's gossip column in the
years after World War II. "God knows what an influence on my
life those columns were," Mr. Herr muses. "They were so
alive, so seductive. I'm not a prude about that. I like
gossip. Most people do, but they won't admit it."
   Winchell died in 1972, no longer famous or feared. Once,
in the old days when radio held America in thrall, half the
country dedicated 15 minutes every Sunday evening to
Winchell's staccato reports. ("Good evening, Mr. and Mrs.
America and all the ships at sea. . . .") It surely is a
commentary on our chronically brief attention span that today
few Americans have reason to recall him and almost no one
under the age of 40 would recognize the name.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Well, here's Mr. Herr with an arresting corrective --
"Walter Winchell" (Knopf, 156 pages, $18.95), which is sort
of a novel and sort of a biography, narrated in a form that
is sort of a screenplay. Movie-swift and often Broadway
funny, it is a compelling and somewhat terrifying account of
the rise and fall of the brassy, minimally talented former
hoofer who became, as Mr. Herr puts it, "the architect of our
heartbreaking addiction to knowing everyone else's business."</p>
<p>In Winchell's prime, his power extended far beyond show
business. Politicians courted him, gangsters surrendered to
him, and the literati pandered to him. Authorities on the
order of H.L. Mencken decreed, wrongly as it turned out, that
his trashy gift for linguistic invention -- infanticipating,
cinemagic, to name two Winchellisms -- surely had earned him
a permanent place in the literary pantheon. All in all, he
was journalism's sacred monster. "You're a terrible price to
pay for freedom of the press," an editor in the novel tells
him.</p>
<p>At first sight, "Walter Winchell" is not the sort of piece
you might expect from the author of "Dispatches," probably
the best book written about the Vietnam misadventure. In
contrast to the novel, that work was narrated with a
compelling density of language and an almost unbearable
emotional intensity. But Winchell and Vietnam are, in some
respects, metaphoric twins. Mr. Herr is drawn to occasions
and figures that embody "great American lies."</p>
<p>"Dispatches," published in 1977, brought its author fame
and success that he fully savored but finally felt compelled
to flee from. For the past 10 years, he and his British-born
wife, and a family now including two daughters, have lived in
London. Mr. Herr, who quite cheerfully turned 50 recently,
was back here briefly to promote the novel. He is bearded,
bulky, soft-spoken and sweet-tempered, dresses with the
casualness of a man who has never brooded about being a
fashion plate and is almost unnervingly polite; for what must
have seemed hours, days even, he sat through most of an
interview in his publisher's office with an unlit Gauloise in
his right hand.</p>
<p>Mr. Herr said his interest in Winchell was rekindled a few
years ago when he collaborated on "The Big Room," a rather
odd work that appeared in 1987 and didn't sell enough copies
to qualify as a cult book. It was an anti-nostalgic album:
brooding Hopperesque paintings by Guy Pellaert of 48
celebrated figures who had been corrupted or otherwise done
in by fame, money and power. Mr. Herr wrote the text blocks;
among all the heavyweights -- Howard Hughes, Richard Nixon,
Orson Welles, Meyer Lansky, Marilyn Monroe -- he found
himself most attracted to a half-forgotten gossip monger.</p>
<p>When a Hollywood producer solicited his talents -- he had
worked on the scenarios for "Apocalypse Now" and "Full Metal
Jacket" -- he proposed Winchell as a film subject. Bob Fosse
was lured, reluctantly, into the project. "I can't see myself
spending three years of my life doing a film about a guy I
disliked as much as Walter Winchell," the director told him.
Neither could the writer. Fosse changed his mind after he saw
half of the Herr script. But then he died, and the script ran
into trouble at Warner Bros., which still owns the film
rights.</p>
<p>"I got fired," Mr. Herr says amiably. The ax appears to
have been welcome. "I meant it to be a real screenplay, but
from the first third on I think I was writing something else.
I was too attached to the material to be a real professional
doing a film. In fact, I was not really willing to turn it
over to other people's interpretations. I felt I would rather
let the reader do the movie. Which is what readers do
anyway."</p>
<p>For "The Big Room" project, Mr. Herr had read some
Winchell biographies. For the script, however, his main
source was Winchell. A New York researcher sent him microfilm
copies of 3,000 columns chosen more or less at random, and he
read every one. "The guy really came alive for me in a way
that none of his biographers could do. From those columns, a
real person emerges. I know he was a terrible human being,
but there is something attractive about him. He had a certain
horrible charm, I think. And he had such chutzpah, such
chutzpah."</p>
<p>It was Mr. Herr's stubborn ambivalence about Winchell that
caused problems in Hollywood and, he suspects, may be
troubling early readers. "I'm getting some funny signals," he
reports. "A lot of what went into the book really happened,
but essentially it's imagined and invented. And romanticized
to a degree. But sort of hard-edged, I hope. Some people seem
offended by my sympathy for him. There's also a strange
feeling that even though they've enjoyed the book, somehow
they shouldn't have."</p>
<p>One salutary effect of "Walter Winchell" is that, as an
exercise in story-telling, it seems to have freed him up at
last to tackle what he calls a non-ambivalent novel, his
first. No one has ever accused Mr. Herr of publishing too
much, too fast. The Vietnam book was delayed for five years
by a ferocious writer's block and by his experimentation with
a variety of controlled substances. Domesticity has tamed his
appetite for drugs but hasn't done much for productivity. Not
long ago, he abandoned a "genre-defying" nonfiction book
built around rock and roll. He decided he just couldn't get
it right, and eight or 10 years of labor went down the drain.
He is amazingly serene about the lost time. It's okay, he
says. For a writer, nothing is ever really lost or wasted.</p>
