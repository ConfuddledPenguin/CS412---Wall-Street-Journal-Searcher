	<p class="article-leader">With regulators and shareholders increasingly
unsympathetic to its excess power problems, Public Service
Co. of New Mexico has said it might sell all or part of its
operations to keep the lights on.
   Analysts and utility executives see a major flaw in that
strategy, however: Likely buyers -- other electric utilities
in the Southwest -- are already fighting the same battle of
too much power and too little demand.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>PNM, like other utilities in the region, paid dearly to
expand ahead of the widely expected Sunbelt boom that never
materialized. Saddled with unneeded electricity from its $1.2
billion investment in the Palo Verde nuclear project, the
utility in the past two years has had to suspend its common
dividend payment, slash its staff by a fifth and sell off its
non-utility assets to stay afloat. The utility took $138
million in charges to rid itself of its ill-fated real estate
operations.</p>
<p>Now, "We're a plain vanilla utility," said Jerry D. Geist,
chairman and president of PNM. But it's still got rocky road
ahead.</p>
<p>PNM had asked regulators for a $13.7 million rate increase
and permission to start a 10-year phase-in of $800 million of
its Palo Verde costs into its rate base. The requests would
have meant $20 million, or 50 cents a share, in earnings this
year. Last month, the New Mexico Public Service Commission,
however, ordered the utility to cut rates by $2.9 million and
ruled against the phase-in altogether, instructing the
utility to absorb the Palo Verde costs. "The order simply
carves a hole in our revenues," said Mr. Geist.</p>
<p>It was a second blow to PNM's revenue outlook. In
December, Southwestern Public Service Co. in Amarillo, Texas,
said it found other sources and wouldn't renew its six-year
purchased power contract with PNM. The $110 million-a-year
contract accounted for 17% of PNM's $620 million in total
electric revenue last year.</p>
<p>Jim Martin, attorney for the public service commission,
said the commission didn't feel PNM proved its case that it
needed more money to cover costs. The commission has been
loath to let utilities raise rates to cover the cost of
producing unneeded power. PNM has a reserve of 66% above its
peak demand; a cushion of about 15% to 20% is generally
considered adequate. Because of the surplus, the commission
ruled to cut the utility's return on equity to 12.5% from
15%.</p>
<p>The commission's decision sent the company's already
anemic stock price even lower. PNM shares have fallen $2
since last month to close unchanged at $11 Friday in trading
on the New York Stock Exchange. Three years ago the stock was
selling at a record high of $39.25.</p>
<p>"They're in a rut," said Daniel Scotto, an analyst with
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. Mr. Scotto and
other analysts are scaling back earnings projections for PNM
to around 90 cents a share for the year, down from last
year's $1.73. Moody's Investors Service Inc. last month
downgraded PNM's credit rating to Ba-1.</p>
<p>Shareholders have sued the company for mismanagement.
Already smarting from the dividend suspension, they recently
heard from PNM that they'll get "little or no return on their
investments over the next several years" because the phase-in
was disallowed. At PNM's annual meeting last week in its home
town of Albuquerque, irate shareholders hanged Mr. Geist in
effigy.</p>
<p>Now the ailing utility is considering putting itself on
the block. "We're going to be interested in reviewing any
options that make sense," Mr. Geist said. "Obviously that
{selling the company} would be one of the options that would
come up," he said.</p>
<p>Analysts, and even the PUC, say PNM's future isn't really
so gloomy that it needs to sell itself off. The area is
growing, though by no means booming, and by the mid-1990s, or
certainly by the year 2000, much of its excess power will be
needed. "With the addition of customers and tightening of
available power, PNM should be in good shape," Mr. Martin
said.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, PNM has contracted Morgan Stanley & Co. to
assist in evaluating the choices available, Mr. Geist said.
He wouldn't put a price on the energy concern, saying it
could jeopardize future negotiations. But the company's
current stock price gives an estimated market value of $450
million, said Mr. Scotto of Donaldson Lufkin. The utility has
$2.3 billion in assets, a company spokesman said. PNM
wouldn't say if prospective buyers have inquired about the
properties.</p>
<p>Those properties include the 10.2% stake in the 3.8
million-kilowatt Palo Verde nuclear project outside Phoenix,
Ariz., as well as interests in the San Juan and Four Corners
coal-fired plants in northwestern New Mexico. PNM owns
outright a gas processing company and a gas-gathering
operation, the water company that serves Santa Fe, and the
gas company that serves most of New Mexico.</p>
<p>Finding a buyer might prove extremely difficult because
utilities in need of extra power simply don't exist in the
Southwest. Arizona Public Service Co., a unit of Pinnacle
West Capital Corp., El Paso Electric Co. and Tucson Electric
Power Co. all also have excess power, Mr. Scotto said.
Potential West Coast buyers often mentioned by analysts,
PacifiCorp and Southern California Edison, a unit of SCE
Corp., both said they are working on other mergers and aren't
interested in PNM.</p>
<p>Two other companies have prompted more intense speculation
among analysts. The first, Southwestern Public Service, which
had purchased power from PNM and is connected through power
lines with the utility, is looking to grow and needs more
generating capacity, said Al Mazzorana, an analyst at UBS
Securities Inc. A Southwestern spokesman said the utility
doesn't comment on its acquisition plans.</p>
<p>The second is Public Service Co. of Colorado, which buys
about 40% of its power from outside sources, said Ed Tirello,
an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. He said PNM and PS
Colorado are already connected and would only need power
lines with more capacity to transport the electricity. A
spokesman for PS Colorado said it is company policy not to
comment on mergers or acquisitions.</p>
<p>"If they do find some buyers, it's not going to be an
attractive price," Mr. Scotto said. "The chances of them
coming out with any money is slim to none."</p>
