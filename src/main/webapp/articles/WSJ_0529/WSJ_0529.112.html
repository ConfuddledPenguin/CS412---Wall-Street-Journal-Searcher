	<p class="article-leader">A GE Capital Corp. unit will move into a new area of the
mortgage finance business with its agreement to purchase
Travelers Corp.'s mortgage services subsidiary. Terms weren't
disclosed.
   The acquisition will allow GE Mortgage Capital Corp.,
Raleigh, N.C., to enter the mortgage servicing business.
Until now, GE Mortgage's main activities were selling
mortgage insurance and packaging bundles of mortgage loans
for the secondary market. GE Mortgage was formed in 1983.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"In today's marketplace, many of our customers are trying
to sell valuable servicing rights to generate capital. Due to
the current restructuring of the industry, there's a shortage
of buyers," said Greg Barmore, GE Mortgage Capital's
president.</p>
<p>Travelers Mortgage Services Inc., headquartered in Cherry
Hill, N.J., will be transferring to GE Mortgage a $12 billion
portfolio of residential mortgage loans that it currently
services. The acquisition includes Travelers' mortgage
servicing business, its relocation services and its mortgage
wholesale operation, which buys mortgages originated by other
companies as well as thrifts and banks.</p>
<p>But GE Mortgage's purchase won't include Travelers' retail
mortgage origination business. GE Mortgage doesn't want to be
in the business of making mortgage loans because it doesn't
want to compete with its customers, which are thrifts, banks
and other mortgage finance companies.</p>
<p>Before it finalizes its deal with GE Mortgage, Travelers
hopes to find another buyer for the mortgage origination
business. The Hartford, Conn., insurer originally planned to
sell the entire mortgage services unit to management and
investor group nearly a year ago. But the transaction fell
through in last December and the mortgage unit remained since
then.</p>
<p>Travelers is selling the mortgage unit as part of its
restructuring to return to its core insurance business. The
insurer purchased the unit, formerly known as Brokers
Mortgage Services, in 1985.</p>
