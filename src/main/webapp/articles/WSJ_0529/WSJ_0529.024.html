	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- From its white-gloved doormen to its tasteful
mix of high fashion and artsy housewares, specialty retailer
Barneys New York has a distinctive image.
   It's so distinctive, in fact, that in preparation for the
opening of the first Barneys store in Japan in November, five
Japanese retailing employees are spending two years in New
York learning Barneys' merchandising ideas and style.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The new store is part of a recently formed joint venture
between Barneys and Tokyo's Isetan department store chain.
The two have agreed to expand Barneys throughout the U.S. and
Asia. Though Isetan, with $30 billion in annual sales, has
plenty of experience merchandising apparel, household goods
and food, with Barneys it is carving out a new niche for
itself: selling clothes to the affluent and urbane customer.</p>
<p>"We have to educate ourselves and the Japanese customer on
a new life style," says Toriaki Tashiro, who will run the
first Barneys store in Tokyo. He notes that about 80% of the
merchandise will be identical to that sold in Barneys stores
in America, and the rest will be chosen by the Tokyo staff.</p>
<p>Buyers from Tokyo have traveled with their New York
counterparts to European fashion houses, while Japanese store
managers have studied Barneys New York's background music
(contemporary and jazz) and noted the china and cutlery used
in Barneys' basement cafe.</p>
<p>For further cross-pollination, five "exchange" employees
-- a select group of young Isetan sales clerks -- are
learning how to turn a store into a Barneys. It's still
unclear which techniques they'll incorporate into the Tokyo
store, though saleswomen will join their male colleagues in
being able to wear their street clothes, rather than the
uniforms that women at Isetan must wear.</p>
<p>Each day, after watching Barneys' employees in action and
taking notes on what they refer to as "the Barneys air," the
exchange employees fax their impressions to Japan. Mallory
Andrews, a vice president at Barneys New York, says: "You
can't imagine it. All day long there's a flurry of faxes
constantly being sent between New York and Japan. It's all
part of the background information that's required before any
decisions are made."</p>
<p>Natsu Ohtani, a 24-year-old exchange employee, spends her
days trailing Connie Darrow, a vice president in Barneys'
women's area. Ms. Ohtani has been surprised at the daring Ms.
Darrow uses in arranging the colors of clothes on the sales
floor. She does "dangerous things like putting red next to
black," Ms. Ohtani says. At Isetan, Ms. Ohtani learned to
arrange displays only according to the color spectrum -- as
dictated by a little rainbow chart that each employee carries
at all times.</p>
<p>And compared with Isetan's static floor displays, which
typically change only at seasonal intervals, Barneys' sales
floors are a moving theater. "Every week we shift everything
around so that the floor looks completely different," Ms.
Ohtani says.</p>
<p>One aspect of Barneys that isn't likely to be copied in
Japan is the separation between buyers for the store and
their subordinates, such as assistant buyers and salesclerks.
In Japan, says Ms. Ohtani, "the buyers were friendlier to the
assistants. . . . Here, the buyers are on a higher level, and
they don't explain all they do, and as a result the assistant
buyers are frustrated."</p>
<p>Hiroshi Higuchi, a 25-year-old exchange employee with a
wet-look crew cut and natty double-breasted suit, clearly
fits the Barneys attitude. Working with Barneys'
public-relations and display staff, he's amused to hear such
catch phrases as "That's fabulous" used repeatedly around
him.</p>
<p>Mr. Higuchi, who sold toys at Isetan, has become
fascinated with Barneys' quirky windows and print ads --
Barneys' current ads use vintage photographs that don't even
show clothes. He's convinced that such creative flourishes
come from Barneys' policy of doing all its advertising and
sales promotion in-house. But Barneys Tokyo is unlikely to
copy that approach. Instead, it probably will hire outside ad
agencies to create ads and promotions, just as most Japanese
retailers do.</p>
<p>"But outsiders don't always understand Isetan because they
never worked there," says Mr. Higuchi. "So sometimes they
misunderstand, which requires a lot of meetings and
compromises, and sometimes results in boring displays."</p>
