	<p class="article-leader">Mannesmann AG said its group profit in the first quarter
"was at the good level of the year earlier," as sales climbed
5%.
   But the diversified West German steel and engineering
company didn't provide specific first-quarter earnings
figures.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mannesmann recently said last year's group profit had
soared 73% to 505 million marks ($300 million) on sales of
22.3 billion marks ($13.3 billion), a 9% increase.</p>
<p>The company said that the "favorable conditions" continued
in the first quarter for most divisions. It said that gains
in its machinery-making and plant-equipment divisions, along
with vehicle technology, more than compensated for declines
in other groups.</p>
<p>Mannesmann is benefiting from the inflow of business from
European manufacturers who are retooling their plants in
advance of the border-free Europe after 1992. Also, business
is being boosted by companies that are trying to expand
capacity to take advantage of the opening of Eastern Europe.</p>
