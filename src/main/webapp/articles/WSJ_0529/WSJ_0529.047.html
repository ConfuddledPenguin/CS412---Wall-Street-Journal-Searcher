	<p class="article-leader">Mikhail Gorbachev and George Bush may not meet in many
more summits like the one taking place this week. As Mr.
Gorbachev's approval rate in the Soviet Union drops below
40%, demands that his administration resign have been voiced,
most recently in the powerful Literary Gazette. His
presidential term does not expire until 1995. But mounting
pressures, especially after the Communist Party Congress in
July, could force new elections before then. Should this
happen, who are Mr. Gorbachev's likely successors?
   Some claim there are no alternatives to Mr. Gorbachev. But
the times create leaders as much as leaders shape the times.
The scene in Moscow resembles a cross-country race in which a
pack of contenders has formed inconspicuously behind the
pace-setter. All of them are waiting for the right moment to
make their move.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Communists remain the only legal party, but many
others are being founded. Scanning the horizon today, one can
speak of at least three groups, in addition to pro-Gorbachev
reformers: party traditionalists who think Mr. Gorbachev has
gone too fast; radical democrats who think he has gone too
slow; and moderate conservatives who support basic change but
want it rooted in tradition. All but the last have produced
viable champions.</p>
<p>The current standard-bearer for party traditionalists is
Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov. Backed by the law-and-order
group "Soiuz" (Union), Mr. Ryzhkov recently defended a
program of economic stabilization that has failed -- notably.
He has also been hurt by allegations that he led the cover-up
of the disaster at Chernobyl.</p>
<p>The other party traditionalist with wide support is
Leningrad secretary Boris Gidaspov. An alumnus of the
military-industrial complex, Mr. Gidaspov, as a colleague put
it, "missed the thaw." He gained fame by successfully
organizing an anti-reform demonstration by workers. But
colleagues in his own institute have recently rebuffed him
for an elective post in Moscow, a serious setback.</p>
<p>A lesser-known opponent of reform is metal-worker Veniamin
Yarin, whom Mr. Gorbachev named to his Presidential Council.
Anti-democratic, anti-market and pro-military, Mr. Yarin has
the backing of the "Rossiia" faction of Party troglodytes.
But Mr. Yarin is still a marginal figure. Mr. Gorbachev sees
him as co-optable.</p>
<p>Sometimes mentioned among traditionalist standardbearers
is novelist Valentin Rasputin. A fierce polemicist, Mr.
Rasputin has garnered visibility by his service on Mr.
Gorbachev's Presidential Council. He lacks practical
experience, though, is narrowly ideological in outlook, and
has little appeal beyond the circles of nationalist true
believers.</p>
<p>For all the talk of party reactionaries moving against Mr.
Gorbachev, they are disorganized and lack popular support. No
wonder that some whisper darkly of a military coup. Such
rumors center around the popular Gen. Boris Gromov, former
commandant of Soviet forces in Afghanistan. But military
coups are not in the Russian tradition and would find little
support even from party stalwarts.</p>
<p>Opposing these traditionalists are radical democrats, many
still party members but others already committed to a
separate path. Most are organized under the Inter-Regional
Group of delegates to the Congress and the voters alliance
"Democratic Russia." They already control the Moscow and
Leningrad city councils, as well as a quarter of all national
deputies. These radicals may constitute a European-type
Social Democratic Party in embryo.</p>
<p>The current darling of this group is Gavriil Popov, the
bushy-haired economist who presides over the Moscow City
Council. An editor, Mr. Popov has little administrative
experience but a canny sense of the public's mood, witness
his uncharacteristic defense of rationing. No milquetoast, he
authorized the recent May Day march that drove Mr. Gorbachev
from the reviewing stand in Red Square.</p>
<p>Mr. Popov's friend Yuri Afanasyev is an archivist by
profession and another hero of the radical democrats. Party
regulars challenged him to lead the radicals out of the
Communist Party in July. Instead, he quit immediately. For
all his boldness, Mr. Afanasyev has yet to gain the national
recognition necessary to capture the top job in an elective
system. Still another radical, Leningrad lawyer and Congress
deputy Anatolii Sobchak, has impressed millions of television
viewers with his eloquent defense of civil rights. However,
when Mr. Sobchak wavered and then decided to support Mr.
Gorbachev's plea for new presidential powers, he slipped from
the pack, at least temporarily.</p>
<p>Besides party stalwarts and radical reformers a third
group exists -- moderate non-party reformers who affirm
traditional values. They may prove strongest of all. A
Christian Democratic Party recently formed in Moscow, and
several similar groups exist to promote democracy, a mixed
economy and "family values." Such proto-parties are strong
both in Russia and the non-Russian republics, but they have
yet to produce real national leaders.</p>
<p>The non-Russian republics are a seed bed for future
leaders. Marju Lauristin and Edgar Savisaar in Estonia,
Anatolijs Gorbunovs in Latvia, and Ivan Drach in the Ukraine
are among many talented new leaders who have come to the
fore. None can be considered candidates for high office in
Moscow, however, for the simple reason that all have staked
careers on resisting the Kremlin's control. Odds are any new
president will be an ethnic Russian.</p>
<p>Most of the emerging leaders in Russia were until recently
outsiders who came up not through party or governmental posts
but through the rapidly expanding "third sector" of
nongovernmental organizations. Untainted but inexperienced,
these "new people" are probably not one but two steps from
power. This cannot be said of the charismatic radical
democrat Boris Yeltsin, who honed his managerial skills in
the Urals and his political skills as mayor of Moscow. He
pulls 85% of the votes in his hometown of Sverdlovsk.</p>
<p>A founder of the Inter-Regional Group, Mr. Yeltsin
embraces a broad program. He speaks glowingly of Western
democracy and mixed economies but at the same time feels
Russia (as opposed to the Soviet Union) has lost its
"spiritual, national and economic independence." He defends
the right of non-Russian republics to secede, yet champions
the cause of Russian colonists who have returned to Russia
from homes in Soviet Central Asia and the Caucasus.</p>
<p>Mr. Yeltsin's backers are promoting him for the presidency
of the Russian Republic -- this week he pulled more votes
than any other candidate but not enough to secure him that
seat. If the empire falls apart this post will soar in
importance, which is why Mr. Yeltsin has already proposed
that the Russian Republic have its own foreign policy. Mr.
Gorbachev recognizes that Mr. Yeltsin leads the pack
breathing down his neck and frequently singles him out for
abuse. Meanwhile, Mr. Yeltsin calmly tours the world, issuing
policy statements from Tokyo and Madrid, Moscow and
Sverdlovsk.</p>
<p>Boris Yeltsin remains sui generis, an ardent democrat who
has appropriated many causes associated with other groups and
factions. For now, he is best positioned to fill a power
vacuum at the top. But the entire Soviet Union has become a
laboratory for leadership, and other equally powerful
contenders will doubtless move up in the pack soon.</p>
