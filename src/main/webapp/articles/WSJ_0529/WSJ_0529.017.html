	<p class="article-leader">In your article "Laventhol & Horwath, Beset by Litigation,
Runs Into Hard Times" (page one, May 17), you report that I
was upset with Laventhol & Horwath's professional standards,
and quote me as saying, "The urge to take such risks there
was too ferocious. The dog-eat-dog atmosphere and knowledge
that if you weren't willing to cut a corner, someone else
would be found there who will, was too much for me."
   My words were a description of the pressures facing the
entire public-accounting profession, and not just Laventhol
alone. What I said was, "The urge to take such risks was
ferocious. The dog-eat-dog atmosphere and knowledge that if
you weren't willing to cut a corner, someone else would be
found there who will." You changed the meaning and applied it
to something other than what was intended. I never told you
that I was upset at Laventhol's standards, nor that the
pressure to take on questionable clients "was too much for
me." I made it very clear that I did not consider Laventhol's
standards any lower than any other growing accounting firm
during the time I worked there and that, in fact, during my
years with the firm there was a concerted effort by Laventhol
to upgrade the quality of the work done by personnel who came
to the firm through mergers. I would also add that
Laventhol's professional standards had nothing to do with my
decision to leave the firm.</p>
