	<p class="article-leader">First Executive Corp. said its board of directors rejected
Rosewood Financial Inc.'s proposal that a Rosewood nominee be
elected to the troubled insurance concern's board.
   Los Angeles-based First Executive said that, in light of
Rosewood's actions as a stockholder in First Executive, the
proposal wouldn't be "in the best interests of the company,
its policyholders and stockholders."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Officials of Rosewood Financial, whose previous efforts to
take over troubled First Executive failed, couldn't be
reached for comment over the holiday weekend.</p>
<p>The unit of Dallas-based Rosewood Corp., which is owned by
the trust estate of oil heiress Carolyn Rose Hunt, had
proposed earlier this month that First Executive expand its
board by one seat and appoint Donald F. Craib Jr., former
chairman and chief executive of All State Insurance Group, to
the position.</p>
