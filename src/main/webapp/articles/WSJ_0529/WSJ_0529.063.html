	<p class="article-leader">VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Cash-rich Placer Dome Inc.
offered 229.5 million Canadian dollars (US$193.8 million) or
C$67.50 a share for Stikine Resources Ltd., 50% owner of
British Columbia's burgeoning Eskay Creek gold deposit.
   The offer, which begins today and expires June 19, is
expected to spark a battle with Toronto's Corona Corp. for
control of the rich deposit. Its reserves to date total 4.8
million contained ounces of gold or equivalent, worth about
US$1.76 billion at current spot prices.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We see it as very unfriendly. It caught us by surprise,"
said Peter Steen, Corona's chief executive officer. He said
Corona and Placer Dome were holding unspecified talks prior
to the offer; an analyst who declined to be indentified said
the companies were studying a possible joint venture at Eskay
Creek.</p>
<p>The shares of Stikine, a small Vancouver-based exploration
outfit whose stock traded at less than C$1 a share just 18
months ago, rose sharply yesterday in Toronto Stock Exchange
trading, closing at C$68.50 each, up C$7.25 and C$1 above
Placer Dome's bid price. Placer Dome closed at C$19 a share,
unchanged.</p>
<p>Currently, Corona owns 20% of Prime Resources Group Inc.,
Stikine's partner and the operator of the Eskay Creek
project, which is in northwestern British Columbia. Under a
complex plan announced in April, Corona proposes to secure
control of Eskay Creek by acquiring 44.6% of a new company
formed through the merger of Stikine and Prime.</p>
<p>Corona's proposal, which still requires shareholder
approvals at meetings expected in July, calls for Stikine
holders to receive a package of securities, including Corona
shares, that analysts value at anywhere from C$65 to C$70 a
Stikine share.</p>
<p>Placer Dome, a big gold producer whose cash holdings will
swell to about C$1 billion with the pending sale of its oil
and gas interests, said it views its bid as "superior" to
Corona's plan. As an alternative to its cash bid, Placer Dome
is also offering to swap 3.5 of its shares for each Stikine
share.</p>
<p>Placer Dome's offer, if successful, would block the
planned merger of Stikine and Prime, which requires approval
from 75% of each company's shareholders to proceed. If more
than 25% of Stikine's shares are tendered to Placer Dome's
offer, therefore, analysts said Placer Dome could stymie the
merger plan, as well as Corona's effort to gain control of
Eskay Creek.</p>
<p>Mr. Steen wouldn't say whether Corona would consider
sweetening the pot for Stikine shareholders, though investors
clearly expect a higher offer to come, in view of Stikine's
C$68.50 closing price yesterday.</p>
