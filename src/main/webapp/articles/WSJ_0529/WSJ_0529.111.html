	<p class="article-leader">Cleveland-based BP America Inc., the U.S. affiliate of
British Petroleum Co., said it agreed to sell most of its
remaining U.S. coal operations to closely held Zeigler Coal
Holding Co., Fairview Heights, Ill., for $115 million.
   The agreement, which is subject to government approval,
includes the sale of BP's Franklin Coal and Old Ben Coal
companies. The coal operations consist of BP's four
underground steam coal mines in Illinois, two surface steam
coal mines in Indiana, and steam and metallurgical operations
in West Virginia. Only a few small inactive reserves will
remain in BP's coal operations.</p>
