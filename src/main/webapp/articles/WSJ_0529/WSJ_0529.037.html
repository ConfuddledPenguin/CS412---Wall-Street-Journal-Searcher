	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The U.S. merchandise trade deficit shrank to
$26.37 billion in the first quarter, on a balance-of-payments
basis, the smallest gap since the fourth quarter of 1983, the
Commerce Department reported.
   Both exports and imports set records. The department said
exports grew 4.7%, to $96.04 billion, while imports, boosted
by the highest volume of oil in more than 12 years, rose 1.6%
to $122.42 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the fourth quarter, the deficit was $28.75 billion, a
slight revision from the department's initial calculation of
$28.81 billion for the period.</p>
<p>The quarterly balance-of-payments report differs from the
government's monthly merchandise trade numbers by excluding
military trade and making certain adjustments for timing,
insurance coverage and valuation. The monthly trade reports
are followed more closely than the quarterly numbers, but
generally both show the same trends.</p>
