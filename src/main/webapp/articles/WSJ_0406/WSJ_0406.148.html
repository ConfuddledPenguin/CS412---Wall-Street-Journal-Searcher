	<p class="article-leader">Trendex Capital Management Corp., representing a dissident
group of Lionel Corp. shareholders, increased pressure on the
toy retailer to find a buyer.
   The Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based group represents 5% of
Lionel's 13.5 million shares outstanding. It requested that
New York-based Lionel remove any impediments to would-be
acquirers, including cancellation of a standstill agreement
with former suitor Robert I. Toussie, of New York. The group,
in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, also
asked Lionel to empanel an independent committee to examine
Lionel's relationship with Isaac Perlmutter and Bernard
Marden.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Lionel closed at $4.25, unchanged.</p>
<p>Lionel officials couldn't be reached for comment. Nor
could Messrs. Perlmutter and Marden be reached.</p>
<p>James DeBolt, of Trendex, said the group has no intention
of launching its own takeover bid for Lionel but will do
whatever is necessary to maximize shareholder value.</p>
