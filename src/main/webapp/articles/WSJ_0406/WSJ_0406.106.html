	<p class="article-leader">American Airlines, Eastern Airlines and Mesa Airlines all
reported March traffic increases.
   American, a unit of Fort Worth, Texas-based AMR Corp.,
said its traffic rose 4.1% to 6.45 billion revenue passenger
miles from 6.19 billion last year. A revenue passenger mile
is one paying passenger flown one mile. American's load
factor, or percentage of seats filled, fell to 63.2% from
65.6%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the first quarter, American said it flew 17.5 billion
revenue passenger miles, up 7.9% from 16.2 billion. Its
year-to-date load factor was 59.9%, down from 60%.</p>
<p>Miami-based Eastern, a unit of Texas Air Corp., said it
flew 1.72 billion revenue passenger miles last month, against
299 million a year ago, when Eastern was nearly grounded by a
strike. Eastern's load factor was 66.8% last month, compared
with 50% a year ago. For the quarter, revenue passenger miles
rose 9.2% to 4.75 billion from 4.35 billion. Load factor also
was up, to 63.2% from 59.2%.</p>
<p>Mesa said its March traffic soared 74%, to 10.2 million
revenue passenger miles from 5.9 million a year ago. Load
factor fell to 47.4% from 51.5% last March.</p>
<p>The commuter carrier attributed its increased traffic to
its new operations carrying passengers as a United Express
carrier out of Denver. The airline continues to operate as an
independent carrier out of its Albuquerque, N.M., and
Phoenix, Ariz., hubs.</p>
<p>For the first three months of 1990, Mesa said its traffic
jumped 62%, to 25.1 million revenue passengers from 15.5
million in 1989. Load factor for the same period declined, to
44.7% from 48.5%.</p>
