	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- For corporations, being the object of a takeover
war is economically similar to being hit by a hurricane or a
flood. So it isn't surprising that the insurance industry has
hatched a new policy that companies can buy for protection
against this modern catastrophe.
   TOI Corporate Services, a newly formed firm, is pushing
the new takeover insurance in collaboration with Robert
Fraser Group, a brokerage concern here. According to Sandra
Ringsell, one of TOI's founders, "we're the first to market"
takeover insurance, though others have sold it here and there
on a makeshift basis.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A sales brochure TOI is circulating highlights the
dizzying costs of being raided: for a company valued at more
than #30 million ($49.2 million), it can cost about #500,000
to fend off an unwanted suitor, according to TOI.</p>
<p>Merchant bankers lay claim on the biggest chunk of these
costs, with about #320,000. Lawyers and stockbrokers grab
another #110,000. Public-relations people speak for another
#5,000, while accountants claim #35,000.</p>
<p>Then there's all the extra time that executives at raided
companies have to put in. That can be insured too. For
coverage of #500,000 of takeover expenses, an insurance
policy costs as much as #25,000 a year. The premium doesn't
count as a takeover expense, however.</p>
<p>Ms. Ringsell says she has pieced together
takeover-insurance policies through various underwriters for
about 35 companies. Now that TOI has been formed to
specialize in raider policies, she figures she will bring in
about 400 more.</p>
<p>Although takeovers have slowed in the U.S. with the
collapse of the junk-bond market, TOI warns companies in
Europe that they aren't out of the woods yet. "Takeovers are
likely to increase," the company said in sales literature,
partly because "companies will be seeking to be better
positioned in their respective markets ahead of 1992."</p>
<p>So far, Ms. Ringsell said, only one policyholder has filed
a claim. Everything went smoothly: The company got reimbursed
for the costs of repulsing the raider, and it came back to
renew its policy for another year.</p>
