	<p class="article-leader">The soft economy and heavy debt burdens are triggering a
spurt in bankruptcy-law filings by U.S. businesses.
   Many of the companies now seeking court protection from
creditors aren't household names. Rather, they are typically
small-to-medium-sized concerns, mainly in the real estate,
apparel, retailing and construction industries. And though
the filings haven't grabbed headlines like the celebrated
busts earlier this year of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and
Campeau Corp.'s U.S. retailing units, they are proving a boon
to bankruptcy attorneys and a bane to creditors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Business filings nationwide jumped 34% from the third to
the fourth quarter last year, the latest period available,
according to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts in
Washington.</p>
<p>And in just the past week, at least four publicly held
companies have sought bankruptcy-court protection after
failing in last-ditch efforts to obtain new financing. They
range from Amdura Corp., a Denver construction equipment
concern, to Casual Male Corp., a Shrewsbury, Mass., men's
clothing retailer.</p>
<p>"Bankruptcy filings are up significantly," says Harvey R.
Miller, co-managing partner of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, a New
York law firm with a large bankruptcy practice. In his area,
real estate, retailing and manufacturing concerns are having
trouble, as are highly leveraged companies in general. "It's
a result of the generally weak state of the economy," he
says, combined with a drying up of some sources of financing.</p>
<p>Moreover, the situation appears likely to worsen before it
improves. More companies are past due in bill payments, which
is a good barometer of financial health. The next step for
these slow-paying companies may be bankruptcy court.</p>
<p>Nationwide, companies in March paid their bills an average
nine days past due, up from seven days in December, according
to data compiled by TRW Inc.'s business credit division.
"That's a significant change," says Robert Wheeler, marketing
vice president for the division. "It's a strong signal that
companies are in a cash bind."</p>
<p>In certain sectors, the cash bind has become acute. For
instance, the past-due indicator jumped in the same period to
17 days from nine for apparel stores and to 14 from eight for
general retailers, Mr. Wheeler says. In building and
construction, it increased to 14 days from 12.</p>
<p>Most bankruptcy specialists link the increase in filings
to greater uneasiness among bankers. Though the soft economy
clearly has weakened cash flow for many businesses, the
credit environment has also become more cautious. Savings and
loan associations, many of them in trouble, aren't able to
come to the rescue of debt-burdened real estate concerns. And
the junk-bond market, where a lot of less-credit-worthy
companies previously found financing, has all but
disappeared.</p>
<p>As a result, banks have become the lenders of last resort
-- and increasingly they are skittish. "We ran out of cash,"
says Melvin Jaffee, president and chief executive officer of
National Lumber & Supply Inc. The Fountain Valley, Calif.,
operator of building-supply stores filed under Chapter 11 of
the federal Bankruptcy Code after the company's lenders
refused to provide it with more cash. Under Chapter 11,
National Lumber continues to operate while seeking an
arrangement with creditors.</p>
<p>Even though outstanding loans were secured with liens
against inventories and other assets, "our lender wouldn't
give us any more," Mr. Jaffee says. "I think they were scared
by what they saw happening to other retailers."</p>
<p>For their part, commercial loan officers say they are more
cautious partly because bank examiners are scrutinizing their
loans very closely. Adding to bank uneasiness is a new
Federal Reserve guideline, adopted Feb. 6, that sets a
uniform definition for highly leveraged transactions and
requires banks to report them.</p>
<p>"The world has changed so dramatically in just a few
months time. There's been an incredible tightening up of bank
credit," says Richard M. Cieri, a partner at Jones, Day,
Reavis & Pogue in Cleveland, the nation's second-largest law
firm. Mr. Cieri, who co-manages the firm's bankruptcy
practice, cites tight lending as the major reason for a
significant increase in Jones Day's bankruptcy caseload in
recent months.</p>
<p>The tight credit situation "becomes a self-fulfilling
prophecy," adds A. Gary Shilling, a New York economic
consultant. "As lenders get more worried, they stop lending
to the people who most need to borrow, forcing what they most
fear, which is bankruptcy."</p>
<p>Mr. Shilling expects the problem to get worse before it
gets better. "The economy is pretty much dead in the water,"
he says, making it unlikely that troubled companies will be
relieved by an improvement in earnings. "And once lenders get
scared, they tend to stay scared for awhile. We're advising
clients to be very, very cautious, because we think the
economy is very close to a recession, which will be global in
scope." Such a scenario, he adds, would drive a large number
of highly leveraged businesses, from New York to Tokyo, into
a financial crisis.</p>
<p>To be sure, bankruptcies in 1989 and so far this year
don't appear to be as high as they were in the mid-1980s,
when the rust, farm and energy belts suffered a near
depression. Nevertheless, after falling back, filings are
rising again -- and higher debt levels are a big contributor.</p>
<p>The soft economy has eaten into income. As a result,
interest expense is rising far faster than the cash flow from
which it must be paid, says Mr. Shilling. In the 1989 fourth
quarter, he notes, net interest cost equaled 27.5% of
corporate cash flow plus interest costs, up from 18.8% in the
first quarter of 1986, when the buy-out trend was just
getting under way.</p>
<p>Many of the companies bought during that period were
financed with high-risk, high-yield securities, commonly
known as junk bonds. And that heavy burden of debt has set
the stage for some big filings in recent months. In fact,
Beard Group Inc., a Washington, D.C., research firm that
keeps tabs on bankruptcies, says 10 of the 27 largest U.S.
bankruptcies in history occurred in the past 15 months.</p>
<p>The debt bomb permeates the economy. "I can explain {the
increase in bankruptcies} with three letters: LBO," or
leveraged buy-out, says Herman Glatt, a partner with the Los
Angeles law firm of Stutman, Treister & Glatt. "A lot of
companies moved too heavily into the debt market, and they
can't refinance the debt."</p>
<p>Nor is that debt burden likely to lessen anytime soon. A
record $15 billion of high-interest junk bonds are likely to
go into default this year, says Richard Lehmann, editor of
Defaulted Bond Newsletter, a Miami Lakes, Fla. trade
publication. That would be a 28% increase from $11.7 billion
last year and more than three times the $4.97 billion of
1988, he says. Bloated by the $3.5 billion default last
January by the Federated and Allied department-store units of
Campeau, first-quarter defaults totaled $5.7 billion.</p>
