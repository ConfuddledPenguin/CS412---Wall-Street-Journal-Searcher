	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Shuwa Corp., a big Japanese property-investment
company, said it is among the bidders for one of the U.S.'s
top department stores, Saks Fifth Avenue.
   That would put Shuwa, a closely held firm with a
reputation for bold stock-market forays, into a competition
for Saks with a management-led group backed by a sedate Tokyo
retail chain, Tobu Department Stores Ltd.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The management group's offer was made public last month
after B.A.T PLC, a British conglomerate that owns Saks,
closed bidding on the 46-store, New York-based chain. B.A.T
said then that it had several offers for Saks, but it didn't
identify the bidders.</p>
<p>Makoto Ichihara, Shuwa's managing director, confirmed the
bid, but wouldn't provide details of the offer for Saks. A
Tobu spokesman refused to comment on Shuwa's bid.</p>
<p>Shuwa is one of the most active Japanese investors in the
U.S. and Japanese commercial-property market. The firm owns
more than 53 buildings in Japan and 34 in the U.S., with a
total value of more than $10 billion. But it is heavily
indebted. A credit-research agency in Japan estimates Shuwa's
borrowings outstanding total 750 billion yen ($4.72 billion).</p>
<p>Some stock-market analysts said they doubt whether Shuwa,
which has used a lot of its money to invest in the market,
will be able to proceed with an Saks offer because of the
recent drop in share prices here. The Tokyo stock market is
off more than 27% since the start of the year.</p>
<p>That has led to rumors in the market that such highly
geared investors as Shuwa could face funding shortages. The
Yomiuri Shimbun, a national newspaper, reported that more
than 30 securities firms were stuck with 10 million unwanted
shares when a group of speculators was unable to meet its 30
billion yen payment. The group wasn't identified.</p>
