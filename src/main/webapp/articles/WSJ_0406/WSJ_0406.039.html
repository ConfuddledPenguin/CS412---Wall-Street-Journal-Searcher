	<p class="article-leader">ALLENTOWN, Pa. -- A philandering pizza maker and his
homicidal wife may profit from a new movie. And some people
here don't think that's right.
   The movie is a new Hollywood comedy opening today. It's
based on the true-life attempted murder of Tony Toto, a
former Allentown pizzeria owner and admitted womanizer, by
his jealous wife, Frances. Directed by Lawrence ("The Big
Chill") Kasdan, the movie stars Kevin Kline and Tracey Ullman
as the husband and wife.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>If the movie, "I Love You To Death," is a box-office hit,
the Totos could reap a tidy sum. But some people here grumble
that the Totos should be ashamed of trying to cash in on
their wicked ways.</p>
<p>"It's a sin that people can resort to violence and are
rewarded by being made rich beyond their wildest dreams,"
says Lori Donnelly, an Allentown resident. Ms. Donnelly has
started a campaign urging a boycott of local theaters that
show the movie. She has even sent to President Bush a copy of
a protest letter she wrote to Sony Corp.'s Tri-Star Pictures
Inc. unit, which made the movie.</p>
<p>Seven years ago, police found Mr. Toto at home, shot in
the head and in his cheating heart, but miraculously alive.
For a year or so before that, according to a detective who
worked on the case, his wife and inept hired killers had
tried bombing his car, clubbing him, drugging him and
shooting him. But to no avail.</p>
<p>The unsinkable Mr. Toto, who is 44 years old, not only
survived, he bailed his wife out of jail before she was
sentenced, then waited faithfully while she served four
years. Their improbable love-conquers-all story made
headlines.</p>
<p>The movie idea was hatched by two Allentown detectives,
who found a producer who sold the idea to Tri-Star.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania law restricts convicted felons such as Mrs.
Toto from enjoying the fruits of their crimes. But the law
won't stop Mr. Toto, who still has a .25-caliber slug in his
skull, from sharing any gains with her. He stands to receive
an undisclosed share of the proceeds.</p>
<p>Mr. Toto says he just hopes for enough money to send his
three younger children to college. But watching clips from
the movie and chuckling over Mr. Kline's portrayal of him,
Mr. Toto was thinking of another successful black comedy
about a warring couple. "`The War of the Roses' has made"
more than $80 million, he says, adding that he's been keeping
track.</p>
