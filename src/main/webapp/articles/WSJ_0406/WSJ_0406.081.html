	<p class="article-leader">BONN -- New orders to the West German manufacturing
industry rose a price-adjusted and seasonally adjusted 0.4%
in February from January but dropped 2.4% from a year
earlier, the Bonn Economics Ministry said in a preliminary
report.
   The month-to-month rise reflects a 3% increase in foreign
orders, while domestic order bookings fell 1%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The February increase, which follows a 5.5% drop in
January, was smaller than what most economists had expected.</p>
<p>In a two-month comparison, which is less subject to
short-term fluctuations, January-February order bookings
dropped 2.5% from the November-December period. Foreign
orders fell 5.5%, while domestic orders were off 1%.</p>
