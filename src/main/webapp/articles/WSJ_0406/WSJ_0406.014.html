Aeroflot, the Soviet national airline, to update and expand
the Moscow airport, Sheremetjevo I.
   West Germany's national air carrier, which is 51%
government owned, announced a year earlier that it had signed
a letter of intent for the project. Feasibility studies were
made during the past 11 months.</p>
