	<p class="article-leader">SAN ANTONIO, Texas -- Tesoro Petroleum Corp. said it won a
$6.4 million verdict against a foreign subsidiary of Coastal
Corp.
   The company said a New York Supreme Court jury found that
Holborn Oil Co., a Bermuda-based unit of Coastal, had agreed
to purchase 25,000 metric tons of gasoline from Tesoro in May
1979, before a steep decline in the world petroleum market.
Holborn later denied entering into the contract and refused
to accept delivery of the gasoline, Tesoro said, forcing
Tesoro to sell the gasoline at a loss. The jury verdict
represented Tesoro's loss and accrued interest.</p>
