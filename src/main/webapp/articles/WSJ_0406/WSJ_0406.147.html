	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- The principal subsidiary of First Executive
Corp. is a plaintiff in a lawsuit filed here yesterday
alleging that Merv Griffin, Donald Trump, Resorts
International Inc. and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
misrepresented Resort's prospective financial results in the
sale of its debt in 1988.
   The suit, filed in federal court, cites registration
statements related to the sale of $325 million in notes. It
alleges that financial information provided in the statements
failed to reveal that the resulting company would lack
sufficient cash to cover its debt.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Drexel, now in bankruptcy proceedings, was named in the
suit as underwriter of the securities. Mr. Trump allegedly
acquiesced in the misstatements in order to spur the sale of
his interest in Resorts. Also named as a defendant was the
investment banking firm of Houlihan, Lokey, Howard & Zukin.</p>
<p>First Executive's holdings of Resort debt had a book value
of $148.7 million at Dec. 31. Executive Life Insurance Co.
unit, the plaintiff, is the principal holder of the notes,
which were issued in connection with Mr. Griffin's 1988
purchase of Resorts after a takeover battle with Mr. Trump.</p>
<p>The suit alleges the defendants fraudulently
misrepresented the condition of Resorts properties, implying
that they were in good condition and had excellent cash flow.
It also alleges securities fraud and seeks unspecified
compensatory damages.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump and his spokesmen, Mr. Griffin and his lawyer
were all attending the grand opening of Mr. Trump's Taj Mahal
hotel-casino in Atlantic City, N.J., and couldn't be reached
for comment. A Drexel spokesman in New York also was
unreachable late last night.</p>
<p>Mr. Griffin issued the $325 million in senior junk bonds
on top of $600 million in existing Resorts notes. The
entertainer and businessman soon ran into serious cash-flow
problems when it became clear that assets tagged for sale to
pay off debt couldn't be sold as originally planned, and that
the resort required more capital improvements than previously
thought.</p>
<p>In August 1989, Resorts suspended payments on the $925
million in notes. In late December, Resorts simultaneously
filed a petition for protection under Chapter 11 of the
federal Bankruptcy Code and a reorganization plan.</p>
