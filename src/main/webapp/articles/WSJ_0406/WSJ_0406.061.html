	<p class="article-leader">WORCESTER, Mass. -- BankWorcester Corp., citing a
"dramatically weakened" real-estate market, said it will add
$11.9 million to its allowance for possible loan losses,
resulting in a loss for the first quarter -- and possibly
jeopardizing its agreement to be acquired by a Rhode
Island-based subsidiary of Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC.
   In the year-earlier first quarter, BankWorcester had net
income of $2.8 million, or 38 cents a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company said it has charged off about $9.1 million of
loans, and said that after the provisions and charge-offs,
the loan-loss allowance will be about $14.4 million, or 1.5%
of loans outstanding. It said nonperforming assets total
about $44.5 million.</p>
<p>As reported, BankWorcester has agreed to be acquired by
Royal Bank's Citizens Financial Group Inc. unit for $22.50 a
share, or about $149 million.</p>
<p>One condition of the acquisition agreement, however,
provides that Citizens can terminate the agreement if
nonperforming assets and other items exceed $50 million after
all regulatory approvals for the acquisition have been
received. As of March 31, BankWorcester said, the level of
nonperforming assets and other items covered by the condition
totaled $58.6 million.</p>
<p>BankWorcester said that the total is expected to fluctuate
over time and noted that the $50 million benchmark comes into
effect after receipt of all regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>The company said, "The management of BankWorcester
believes that it will be able to meet this condition at that
point in time; however, there can be no assurance that this
condition will in fact be satisfied at that future time."</p>
