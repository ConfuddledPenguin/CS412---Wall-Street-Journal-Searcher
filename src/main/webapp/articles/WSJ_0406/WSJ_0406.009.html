	<p class="article-leader">Under pressure from the pending clean-air bill and the
public, the U.S. high-technology industry is trying to kick
its reliance on ozone-eating chemicals.
   Fearing a federal ban on the use of these chemicals in
manufacturing, many of the nation's largest high-technology
concerns are scrambling for substitutes. International
Business Machines Corp., the world's largest electronics
manufacturer, pledges to eliminate the chemicals, known as
chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, by the end of 1993. Most other
large electronics manufacturers have less ambitious plans,
but only a few have refused to join the war on CFCs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For high-technology companies, kicking the CFC habit isn't
easy. The most popular type of CFC, 113, turns up in more
than 100 different high-tech manufacturing processes, from
cleaning freshly soldered circuit boards to etching a chip
design into a silicon wafer.</p>
<p>"With all these different uses, finding one magic snake
oil to replace them is very difficult," said David Chittick,
American Telephone & Telegraph Co.'s vice president for
engineering and safety. Mr. Chittick, who also heads a new
industry cooperative attempting to spur cuts in CFC use, said
technical difficulties "have made a number of companies
reluctant to pledge to completely eliminate CFCs from the
manufacturing operations."</p>
<p>Progress is being made. Since the start of 1988, IBM has
cut CFC emissions by 31%. AT&T is cutting its use by making
some of its circuit boards with a process that doesn't
require the removal of excess solder; for some other
processes it is switching to a cleanser derived from citrus
rinds.</p>
<p>And Digital Equipment Corp., one of the biggest computer
makers, has devised a way to clean the most advanced type of
circuit boards, using so-called surface-mount technology,
with a water solution that eliminates the need for CFCs.
Digital had said it will offer for free to other high-tech
manufacturers directions on how to use and make the new
solvent.</p>
<p>CFCs, which also are used in Styrofoam containers,
automobile air conditioners and refrigerators, are blamed for
depleting the earth's atmospheric ozone layer. Scientists
believe "holes" in the ozone, created by CFCs, increase the
possibility of skin cancer by letting in more ultraviolet
radiation.</p>
<p>The industry's decision to rely more heavily in the 1980s
on the ozone-eating chemical is harshly criticized by some
observers.</p>
<p>Defenders of the electronics industry concede that it
should have moved more swiftly to curb CFC use. "Should we
have done something {to cut back} sooner? In hindsight, we
should have," said Cheryl Russell, a lobbyist for the
American Electronics Association, an influential trade group
that advocates a 50% cut in CFC emissions by 1993.</p>
<p>But Ms. Russell said the industry had good reasons for
embracing one type of CFC, 113, even after the alarm bells
began to sound. An effective cleanser, CFC-113 was popular
with electronics manufacturers because it posed fewer, if
any, hazards to workers than traditional solvents and was
easily handled and stored, she said.</p>
<p>As a result, CFC-113 won out in a push to rid the industry
of other, patently hazardous chemicals, including
cancer-causing agents.</p>
<p>Even now, many companies are slow to move forward with CFC
substitutes because of uncertainties about their
effectiveness. "We recognize CFCs must go, but we want a
long-term fix. We don't want to try {a substitute} out and
find it doesn't work," said Cliff Bast, who heads a CFC task
force at Hewlett-Packard Co., which manufactures medical
instruments, computers and related products. Through various
conservation measures, H-P did cut its use of CFCs by 8% in
the fourth quarter of last year.</p>
<p>Other electronics manufacturers say they haven't yet
identified substitutes for some processes. "We haven't found
any acceptable substitute for critical cleaning needs," said
a spokesman for Advanced Micro Devices Inc., a semiconductor
maker.</p>
<p>But given the prevailing political winds, the high-tech
industry won't have CFCs around for long. In January, the
federal government placed a hefty tax on new purchases and
existing inventories of CFCs. And on Tuesday, the Senate
passed a comprehensive clean-air bill that, among things,
calls for a phase-out of CFCs. The House may pass an even
tougher provision restricting CFCs.</p>
