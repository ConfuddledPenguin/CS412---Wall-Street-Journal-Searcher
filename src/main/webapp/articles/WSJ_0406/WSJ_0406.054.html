	<p class="article-leader">CUPERTINO, Calif. -- Tandem Computers Inc. said that
earnings and revenue for its second quarter ended March 31
were below its expectations.
   The announcement, which surprised analysts, sent the
company's stock plunging in composite trading yesterday on
the New York Stock Exchange. Tandem shares closed at $22.625,
down $4.625.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Tandem was the most active stock on the New York Stock
Exchange, with 4.8 million shares changing hands. A Tandem
spokeswoman declined to comment on the drop in stock price.</p>
<p>The computer maker said that net income in the quarter was
between $16.9 million, or 17 cents a share, and $30.7
million, or 29 cents a share. The company had expected
earnings to be more than the $30.7 million it posted in the
fiscal first quarter.</p>
<p>In the year-ago period, Tandem posted net income of $16.9
million on revenue of $363.4 million.</p>
<p>Revenue in the second quarter was between $437 million and
$457 million, the company said, falling below its
expectations. A spokeswoman said Tandem expected revenue to
be above $457 million, but wouldn't say by how much. Analysts
had estimated that revenue would be about $465 million.</p>
<p>Tandem said some orders it expected to close in the
quarter were deferred. In addition, the company said higher
interest rates in the United Kingdom may have caused
financial institutions there to tighten budgets, and also
blamed the downsizing of the securities market in the U.S.
Tandem makes computers that are widely used by banks, stock
exchanges and others who seek to record transactions at once,
refreshing their central data bases at the same time.</p>
<p>J. Neil Weintraut, analyst with Hambrecht & Quist, blamed
the stock plunge on Tandem's overly optimistic outlook,
rather than on changes in its markets, or fundamental
problems at the company. "Tandem has unfortunately
established a record of disappointments for Wall Street," he
said, which may have caused investors to react strongly to
the announcement. He now expects Tandem to earn about 22
cents a share for the second quarter.</p>
<p>He said Tandem's high-end computer, Cyclone, introduced
last year, and other recent products "are very competitive"
with offerings from International Business Machines Corp. and
Digital Equipment Corp.</p>
