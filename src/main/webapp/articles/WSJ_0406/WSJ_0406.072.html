	<div class="article-body"><p>Kerry Packer, an international investor and media magnate,
remains Australia's richest person, with assets valued at
$1.8 billion Australian dollars (US$1.38 billion), according
to an annual list published by Australia's Business Review
Weekly. Robert Holmes a Court placed second, with A$800
million.</p>
<p>The magazine's ranking of the country's 200 richest
persons dropped 27 from last year's list, following a spate
of corporate disasters over the past year. Among those
omitted this year were Alan Bond of Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd.
and Christopher Skase of Qintex Australia Ltd.</p>
<p>For the first time in the eight-year history of the
ranking, the threshold for entry was lowered, reflecting the
declining fortunes of Australia's rich. Individuals and
families needed an estimated minimum net worth of A$30
million to reach the list, down from A$35 million in 1989.</p>
<p>The Smorgons, with assets valued at A$1 billion, replaced
the family of Rupert Murdoch, with A$870 million, as
Australia's richest family.</p>
<p>REVIEWING THE BHOPAL SETTLEMENT</p>
<p>India's Supreme Court began a review of last year's $470
million settlement between the government and Union Carbide
Corp. for the 1984 Bhopal gas disaster. A five-judge panel
will hear arguments until at least April 10, after which it
will decide whether to overturn the deal or accept it.
Yesterday, a lawyer for the Bhopal Women Gas Victims
Organization argued that counsel for the government of
previous Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi "had no authority to
enter into a settlement." Union Carbide says the settlement
is fair and binding.

<p>PAPUA NEW GUINEA'S OFFER</p>
<p>Papua New Guinea has offered to place a two-year
moratorium on new logging to save its rain forests in return
for millions of dollars in aid projects. Minister of Forests
Karl Stack said: "We're challenging the international
community to stop pontificating. We've told them, `You do the
right thing and we'll do the right thing.'" A spokesman for
Australia's Foreign Affairs Minister Gareth Evans said
Australia "stands ready to support the moratorium. It's just
a question of how much." The moratorium, which will start in
July, would mean a loss equivalent to about $73 million in
potential earnings, Mr. Stack said.</p>
<p>A VISIT TO NAMIBIA</p>
<p>The United Nations Council for Namibia, set up in 1967 to
administer the territory but never allowed to set foot there,
will finally visit Namibia, three weeks after it attained
independence. The 31-member council will convene in Windhoek,
the capital, from April 9 to 11. South Africa, which ruled
Namibia for 75 years, refused to cooperate with the council
and prevented it from establishing its authority in the
territory. The council's visit will end with a declaration
recommending that the council be disbanded.</p>
<p>CHINA'S SLUMPING AUTO INDUSTRY</p>
<p>The Chinese government pledged to bail out its auto
industry, now struggling with plunging sales and rising
stockpiles, the official China Daily said. The paper said
auto makers produced 54,500 vehicles in the first two months
of the year but sold only 44,390, down 35% from the same
period in 1989. The daily said the government has allotted
$80.9 million in credit to help stimulate the auto market.
The market has collapsed under a 20-month-long austerity
drive that has limited purchases by government institutions,
the industry's main customers.</p>
<p>`YEAR OF THE CATASTROPHES'</p>
<p>Zurich's Swiss Reinsurance Co., calling 1989 the "year of
the catastrophes," estimates in a new study that various
disasters around the world caused insured damage of at least
$13.3 billion last year.</p>
<p>Saying this amount was "unprecedented," the study said
that 292 disasters last year killed 15,000 people. The 1989
insured-damage total was more than double the amount recorded
for 1988.</p>
<p>Four of the costliest calamities occurred in the U.S.
Hurricane Hugo led the U.S. disaster list, causing $4.31
billion in insured damage, followed by an explosion at a
petrochemical plant in Pasadena, Texas, costing $1.3 billion.
The San Francisco earthquake cost at least $1 billion in
insured damage, and the Exxon Valdez oil tanker spill at
least $425 million in insured losses, the study said.</p>
<p>This year, nature has struck hard in Europe. Several
storms that occurred in the first quarter caused "immense
property damage, provisionally estimated to be at least $8.80
billion," the study said.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>The Belgian parliament voted to restore King Baudouin to
his throne, less than two days after he stepped down to avoid
signing a bill that legalized abortion. . . . South Korea and
China agreed to begin jointly operating car-ferry services
between the two countries before the Asian Games in Beijing
in September.</p>
