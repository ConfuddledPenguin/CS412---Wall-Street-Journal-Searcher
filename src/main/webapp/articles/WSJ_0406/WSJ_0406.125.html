	<p class="article-leader">SEATTLE -- A pensive Jim Nordstrom, his hands together as
in prayer, is trying to fathom the firestorm of controversy
that suddenly has marred the reputation for stellar service
at the retail chain bearing his name.
   "We were naive to think the product would speak for
itself," says the Nordstrom Inc. co-chairman. "We got our
brains beat out of us."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Nordstrom is smarting from the fallout of the fight
his family picked last year with its weak clerks union, which
has since retaliated with a barrage of accusations. There
have been national press accounts of complaints that the
retailer's vaunted service comes on the backs of its
salespeople. There's been a ruling by Washington state
regulators supporting that view. A union lawsuit. Shareholder
litigation. Even union allegations that Nordstrom deceives
shoppers by selling clothes its salespeople have worn -- a
charge Nordstrom denies.</p>
<p>It is impossible to predict whether the union spat will
turn off Nordstrom customers or detract from the service they
receive. The company is in the midst of a major national
expansion. But whatever the outcome of the fight, the
Nordstroms are taking the attack on their family-run business
personally. They already pay some of the highest wages in
retailing.</p>
<p>The company may have underestimated the abilities of a
modern union. It is learning firsthand that organized labor
is capable of tactics far more sophisticated than the
traditional strike or boycott. The United Food & Commercial
Workers Union, which represents about 2,000 of Nordstrom's
30,000 employees, is now attracting national attention to
issues that Nordstrom had assumed last year were only of
local interest.</p>
<p>"The tactics that were traditional in the past didn't work
out well in the 1980s," says Daniel Mitchell, an
industrial-relations professor at the University of
California at Los Angeles. He says that the Nordstrom case is
an example of a broad attempt by unions to try new
strategies.</p>
<p>Nordstrom ignited the dispute last June when it angered
labor leaders with an unusual contract proposal: Optional
union membership for employees at its six stores in the
Seattle and Tacoma areas. When the Seattle local put the
proposal to a vote, only about 250 of its 1,500 members
showed up. They overwhelmingly rejected the idea.</p>
<p>That's when the union, which has represented Nordstrom
employees in hometown Seattle for more than 60 years,
threatened to start a public-relations war. Nordstrom stood
its ground.</p>
<p>"The company vastly underestimated our resolve to protect
not only this contract but the other retail contracts" in the
area, contends Joe Peterson, a former Nordstrom shoe salesman
who heads Local 1001. "Optional union dues systems are meant
to do one thing: to eliminate the contract."</p>
<p>Company officials insist they aren't trying to bust the
union. Management proposed the contract change, Mr. Nordstrom
says, because employees had complained over the years about
mandatory union dues. "It's been a source of irritation for
what we felt was the majority," he says.</p>
<p>President Jack McMillan, noting that union members in
Seattle get the same wages and benefits as non-union
Nordstrom salespeople elsewhere, calls the dues "a bad buy."</p>
<p>The union considered a strike against popular Nordstrom
"suicidal," Mr. Peterson says. But it seized the opportunity
to take on the company over what has come to be known as the
"off-the-clock" issue.</p>
<p>Mr. Peterson says Nordstrom salespeople complained to the
union that they were pressured to work without pay to attend
store meetings and to perform other duties such as stock
work, writing thank-you notes to customers and delivering
merchandise to customers' homes and offices. Initially, Mr.
Peterson says even he didn't believe that the practices were
widespread.</p>
<p>Since then, a union inquiry uncovered 825 current and
former salespeople who claim the company owes them more than
$5.3 million in back wages. The state's Department of Labor
and Industries, backing the union, ordered Nordstrom to
change its practices and pay back wages. And the chain, after
months of denying the charges, created a $15 million reserve
for settling back-pay claims. It says it has already paid
about $1 million to workers outside Washington state. It also
changed its record-keeping procedures and vowed to pay
salespeople for all time worked.</p>
<p>But Mr. Nordstrom insists "the off-the-clock issue is a
nothing issue." He hints that Nordstrom may challenge the
state ruling. "We don't think it will hold up under federal
scrutiny," he says. "We think the law says if the bulk of
their income is commissions, they're free to go to whatever
lengths they want to sell more things. If it means doing
things from home, we feel in most industries it means the
time doesn't have to be accounted for."</p>
<p>The company also complains that it has been treated
unfairly by the press, including this newspaper, which a ran
a page one story in February on working conditions at the
company. Last week, Nordstrom announced a sharp cutback in
advertising in Seattle's two daily newspapers. Company
officials deny they were retaliating for unfavorable
coverage. Mr. Nordstrom was quoted in the Seattle Times as
saying "We think your coverage is horrible, the worst in the
nation."</p>
<p>Nordstrom continues to believe the morale of most of its
employees is good -- but the union continues to fire a
fusillade of complaints about the company to regulators, the
courts and the press.</p>
<p>At Nordstrom stores, where Mr. Peterson acknowledges that
union support "has always been the weakest" among the chains
he has under contract, employees are choosing sides. Some
have quit the union since its contract with Nordstrom expired
August 1. The pro-company forces have attended rallies in
Seattle and elsewhere along the West Coast.</p>
<p>Roughly half of the employees in Seattle and Tacoma have
signed petitions seeking to decertify the union. "We're very
angry about the way the union has slandered the company and
the integrity of the people who work for the company," says
John Rockwood, a shoe salesman in Seattle leading one of the
anti-union drives.</p>
<p>"All the salespeople here operate as entrepreneurs," he
says. As for the state's finding, he contends: "It's petty
little time-keeping stuff. We make twice as much money as
anybody else in the industry. We just haven't kept meticulous
records as to the time we have actually spent working for the
company."</p>
<p>But the National Labor Relations Board last week dismissed
the Tacoma petition because of unresolved charges of unfair
labor practices. And Mr. Rockwood's decertification drive met
the same fate Monday. NLRB officials say they consider
decertification efforts inappropriate when charges of unfair
labor practices against an employer are pending.</p>
<p>In one charge, which the labor board has consolidated into
its own complaint against the company, the union asserts that
Nordstrom enhanced employees' vacation benefits without
negotiating with the union. The labor board also is looking
into a union complaint that Nordstrom sponsored the
anti-union rallies.</p>
<p>The union's Mr. Peterson contends that the company is
drumming up anti-union sentiment and aiding the anti-union
forces in other ways. He claims that Mr. Rockwood's schedule
was changed so he could lead the anti-union petition drive.
Mr. Rockwood says he was able to take a week off to gather
signatures because "business hasn't been great."</p>
<p>Still, even Mr. Rockwood can't explain how green
pro-company buttons, proclaiming "No One Asked Us," suddenly
showed up in the stores in February. "They just appeared in
our department one morning," says Helen Thompson, who sells
designer women's clothes in Tacoma.</p>
<p>Employees who support the union say the pressure from
management isn't subtle. "The atmosphere here is, if you're
pro-union, you're anti-Nordstrom," says Sherry Jacobson, who
sold women's clothes at the store in Bellevue, Wash., until
quitting this week. "Jim Nordstrom called me and said, `I
want to know why you have to hurt the company that way.'" She
says he was referring to interviews she had done with a
newspaper and a local TV station.</p>
<p>The company also produced a 22-minute videotape, shown
recently to Nordstrom employees. In the video, Bruce
Nordstrom, a cousin of Jim Nordstrom and one of three
third-generation family members who share the title of
co-chairman, explains the unfavorable press by saying:
"Evidently, the union in Seattle feels so vehemently about
the issue of union security that they're willing to attack
us, even if it means dirty tricks and untruths that are being
propagated in the press."</p>
<p>In the video, Bruce Nordstrom admits the company has been
"sloppy" in some of its record keeping and is "taking every
step possible to make sure that is cleared up." But he
narrows his eyes for emphasis and says: "I view it as a
personal attack. I would hope that . . . you folks feel it's
a personal attack on you also."</p>
<p>Mr. Peterson, meanwhile, vows he won't give up the fight.
"These issues are not going to go away," he says. "As far as
I'm concerned, we're having a strike without having a
strike."</p>
