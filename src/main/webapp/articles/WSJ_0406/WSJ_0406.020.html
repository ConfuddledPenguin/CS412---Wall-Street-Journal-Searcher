	<p class="article-leader">EUCLID, Ohio -- Here on East 185th Street, just beyond
Tony's Polka Village and Donna's Slovenian Restaurant,
Skufca's sports store is holding a sale on bowling shoes.
Across the way, Setina's Meat Market has a special on zeludic
and skilandis, the Slovenian and Lithuanian lean sausages
made with the stomach casing of a steer.
   This is the heart of a sprawling ethnic community that
dropped its roots in the New World on a swath of land east of
Cleveland.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It was also, until last month, the heart of George Bush
country -- a conservative urban enclave that for nearly four
decades made the Republican Party the repository of its
dreams of liberation for Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Now, however, the support for Mr. Bush has dried up as
fast as the early-April snow showers that blow in from Lake
Erie a few blocks away. The Republicans' Captive Nations
constituency -- a small but vocal and influential GOP bulwark
since the early 1950s -- is angered the president hasn't
recognized Lithuania or taken a stronger position to free the
Baltic nations from their ties to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>"It's good that Bush wasn't president during the Civil
War, because the slaves would never be free," says Raymond
Kudukis, an emigre engineer who serves as vice president of
the international Lithuanian World Community. Vida Grigonis
Glinka, a Cleveland-born homemaker, adds: "I was a very
strong Republican. Now Bush is treating Lithuania and the
Baltics like they're garbage."</p>
<p>Two years ago this month, Mr. Bush brought his
presidential campaign to the Lithuanian-American Citizens
Club here on East 185th Street. Speaking amid the traditional
woodcarvings and the brightly colored crests of the cities of
Vilnius, Klaipeda and Kaunas, Mr. Bush talked of "the
commitment to freedom" and promised to "help countries around
the world that want to be free."</p>
<p>Today Mr. Bush's visit to the Lithuanian center -- where
the smell of balandeliai, the stuffed cabbage rolls that are
served with whipped potatoes, hangs in the air -- is
remembered with irony and bitterness. "We'd like him to
repeat the same speech he made here, word for word," says Mr.
Kudukis, a registered Republican. "We'll send him a copy. He
can read it."</p>
<p>Mr. Kudukis and the others are part of one of the post-war
GOP's most loyal constituencies. Wooed to the Republicans by
Dwight Eisenhower, who was looking for ways to appeal to
Midwest voters, the group gave the GOP an entree into
communities they wouldn't have penetrated otherwise because
of economic or ethnic factors. For their part, the
Republicans in their 1952 platform promised "liberation" of
Eastern Europe and, beginning in 1953, repeatedly got
Congress to pass resolutions establishing Captive Nations
Week, commemorations set aside for Americans to pray for the
liberation of people behind the Iron Curtain.</p>
<p>In local politics, the Captive Nations constituency showed
its influence when Ralph Perk, a Czech Republican, was
elected to three terms as Cleveland's mayor beginning in
1971. Even Mr. Perk has trouble defining his coalition in one
breath: "I couldn't have won the election," he says now,
"without the Lithuanians, the Estonians, the Latvians, the
Slovaks, the Hungarians, the Poles, the Byelorussians, the
Ukrainians, the Romanians, the Slovenians, the Croatians, the
Serbians and the Czechs."</p>
<p>The ties to the GOP were strengthened as the Republican
National Committee poured resources into the outreach
operations of its nationalities department. And later, Ronald
Reagan preached a brand of anti-communism that appealed as
much to prewar immigrants, who had tended to be Democrats, as
to the post-war immigrants, who largely were devout
Republicans.</p>
<p>"He talked about family and neighborhood and work," says
Michael Novak, director of social and political studies at
the American Enterprise Institute, "and he sounded right for
this constituency."</p>
<p>But today many of these voters -- and not only those of
Lithuanian descent -- feel betrayed by what they regard as
Mr. Bush's inaction and by their suspicion that he cares more
for the survival of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev than
for the freedom of Baltic peoples.</p>
<p>"We've been led down the primrose lane," says Maris
Manteneiks, a Latvian-born physicist. "President Bush
promised to work for freedom for the Baltic states. Now, all
of a sudden, silence, absolute silence." Lia Staaf, an
Estonian-born school librarian, adds: "I became a Republican
because of Yalta. I trusted Republicans, they gave us so much
hope. I'm angry."</p>
<p>Many of these Cleveland-area Republicans have already
translated their anger into action. They have traveled to
Washington to speak with their members of Congress -- all
Democrats, and all exceedingly pleased to voice their support
at a time when Mr. Bush is measuring his wordsand have
participated at vigils in front of the Capitol and the White
House.</p>
<p>Victor Stankus, a Lithuanian-born dentist, is helping to
lead a petition drive of Lithuanian-American veterans. And
Linas Muliolis, a Cleveland State University student who
wants to study at Vilnius University, is planning to
participate in a coast-to-coast relay that youths of Baltic
descent are arranging, to dramatize their demands for U.S.
recognition of an independent Lithuania.</p>
<p>"We're not going to take this lying down," says Mr.
Kudukis. The complaints have begun to penetrate the White
House, with some Bush administration officials growing
worried that the discontent could be a political problem for
the president.</p>
<p>Some Democrats have tried to capitalize on the president's
predicament. Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, for example, who is
in a tough re-election battle in a state with many voters
with ties to the Captive Nations, has been a leader in
pressing Mr. Bush to recognize a free Lithuania at the
"earliest appropriate time." In all, there are an estimated
one million voters with ties to Lithuania and another 90,000
with ties to Latvia, and while they are scattered all around
the country, there are important pockets in such places as
Chicago; Cleveland; Detroit; Buffalo, N.Y.; and Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Though many of the members of the Captive Nations
constituency found little appeal in Michael Dukakis in 1988,
they share a harsh view of President Bush and -- today at
least -- vow either to vote for a Democrat in 1992 or not to
vote at all.</p>
<p>"He has let us down -- and when he comes around again we
will not forget," says Terese Kalvaitis, an investigator for
the Cleveland public schools. "He has given up the Baltics,
just as Roosevelt did."</p>
<p>And though a number of these voters may stray back into
the GOP fold by the 1992 elections, many of them now regard
Mr. Bush as an appeaser; one of them compared him with
Neville Chamberlain, the British prime minister who wagered
that concessions to Hitler in the late 1930s would forestall
war. They worry, more-over, that Mr. Bush's reluctance to
alienate Chinese leaders during and after the democracy
movement there in 1989 signals a pattern.</p>
<p>"If there's a Tiananmen Square massacre in Vilnius, the
blood will be on the hands of President Bush," says Michael
Krivinskas, a Lithuanian-American engineer who counts himself
a Republican. "This is genocide, a sellout of human rights."</p>
<p>These ethnic voters, who for so long thought their dreams
were unachievable, are overcome with frustration now that the
dreams seem so close to becoming reality. "People are
standing in line to sign our petition," says Dona Cipkus, a
real-estate agent who was born in Lithuania and who worked on
the Bush campaign in 1988. "I cannot understand why the
president is not responding."</p>
<p>But mixed with the anger to Mr. Bush is, simply, sadness.
"He says nothing but `Read my lips,' " says Vytautaf Brizgys,
a retired manufacturing engineer who came to the U.S. from
Lithuania in 1949. "Who can read those lips if they don't
ever open?"</p>
