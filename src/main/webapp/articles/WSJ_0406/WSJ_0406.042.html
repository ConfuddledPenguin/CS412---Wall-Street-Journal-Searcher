	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The House Energy and Commerce Committee
approved its version of clean-air legislation after adopting
an acid-rain package that would help Midwestern utilities
facing steep cleanup costs.
   Approval of the acid-rain amendment, which came on a 39-4
vote, cleared the last major obstacle before passage of the
overall bill. The bill would impose about $20 billion in
costs annually on industry to clean up acid rain, smog and
toxic emissions from chemical plants and other facilities.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Committee Chairman John Dingell (D., Mich.) called the
bill "necessary" and said it would yield environmental
benefits, but would also "have a significantly adverse impact
on jobs and the economy." He predicted that the bill,
approved 42-1 by the committee, would reach the House floor
around the middle of May. William Dannemeyer (R., Calif.)
cast the only negative vote.</p>
<p>Significantly, the acid-rain amendment doesn't include an
explicit subsidy for Midwest utilities, something that the
advocates of such cost-sharing have fought for over the past
year.</p>
<p>Providing financial aid for the Midwest was "never
accepted at any point, at any time, anywhere," said Rep. Phil
Sharp (D., Ind.), who led the cost-sharing drive.</p>
<p>Instead, the measure would aid utilities in the Midwest as
well as utilities in Western states and other regions that
have been seeking assurances they can expand. It would do
this by tinkering with the pollution-trading system to be
created by the legislation.</p>
<p>Under the system, utilities that make especially deep cuts
in sulfur-dioxide emissions would get pollution credits that
they could sell or swap with other utilities, which could use
them to expand.</p>
<p>The acid-rain provision would impose costs of $4 billion
annually on industry to clean up acid rain, which harms lakes
and trees in New England and Canada. Under the bill, 111
dirty coal-burning power plants in 21 states would have to
make deep cuts in sulfur-dioxide emissions by 1996. More than
200 additional power plants nationwide would have to make
cuts by 2001. A total 10 million tons a year in emissions
would be cut.</p>
<p>The bill would include a nationwide cap on total power
plant emissions, designed to preserve the pollution gains
well into the next century.</p>
<p>The agreement on acid rain was reached after several long
nights of intense bargaining between lawmakers from the
Midwest and those from the so-called clean states.</p>
<p>The amendment would generate additional pollution credits
for utilities in the Midwest and clean states by requiring
deeper emissions cuts from all utilities affected by the
first phase. In addition, it would require cuts from several
power plants owned by the Energy Department and certain small
utilities that weren't previously covered.</p>
<p>Midwest plants would also benefit from certain provisions
designed to encourage utilities to install emission-scrubbing
devices rather than switching to cleaner, low-sulfur coal.
These changes are designed in part to preserve mining jobs.
Bill Samuel, a lobbyist for the United Mine Workers, said he
believed the House provisions would result in fewer job
losses among miners than the bill passed this week by the
Senate.</p>
<p>The Senate bill would generate additional allowances to
help the same groups of utilities, but does so by moving up
the two deadlines for cutting emissions.</p>
<p>The committee's overall bill is stronger than the Senate's
legislation in some respects, and weaker in others. On smog,
the House bill calls for a stronger federal role in forcing
cleanups by states and cities. It would also tailor
requirements to the severity of an area's smog problem.</p>
<p>Environmentalists also prefer the committee's provision on
cancer-causing industrial emissions.</p>
<p>The Senate, however, calls for a significantly stronger
program requiring the use of reformulated gasoline or other
cleaner alternatives to conventional fuel in the smoggiest
cities. The Senate's provisions on auto-tailpipe exhaust are
also more stringent.</p>
