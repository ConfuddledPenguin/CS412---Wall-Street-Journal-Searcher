	<p class="article-leader">A dozen shareholder lawsuits have been filed against
Belmont, Calif.-based software maker Oracle Systems Corp.
after last week's 31% plunge in the company's stock price.
   The lead suit by stockholder John Coleman alleges that
Oracle made false and misleading forecasts of its
third-quarter earnings and that the company failed to
disclose that two large contracts wouldn't be completed.
Oracle called the suit "meritless."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In record one-day volume for an over-the-counter issue,
Oracle stock tumbled March 28, the day after the company
reported flat third-quarter earnings of 18 cents a share.
Analysts had expected earnings would be between 25 cents and
29 cents a share.</p>
<p>The stock dropped $7.825 to close at $17.50 with nearly 21
million of the company's 129 million shares changing hands.
The stock price peaked March 19, at $28.125.</p>
