	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK (AP) -- The Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey, trimming its budget, has dropped plans for higher
tolls and PATH fares, but will push for them again in 1991.
   "The 1990 budget does not include a toll increase" nor
does it recommend increases for the PATH fare this year, Port
Authority spokeswoman Mildred Schneider said yesterday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>When the Port Authority unveiled its proposed 1990 budget
in December 1989, the draft called for a $2.9 billion budget
that included $93 million in additional revenue from the
agency's tunnels and bridges: the George Washington, Bayonne
and Goethals bridges, the Outerbridge Crossing and the
Holland and Lincoln tunnels.</p>
<p>That meant round-trip tolls would rise to $4 from $3 for
automobiles and to $4 from $3 per axle for trucks. The
increases were to take effect April 1.</p>
<p>There also was to be a fare increase to $1.25 from $1 on
Port Authority Trans-Hudson trains linking New Jersey to
Manhattan.</p>
<p>In January, it was revealed that a mid-November 1989 plan
outlined a five-year capital program that saw the tunnel and
bridge tolls going as high as $6 by 1993 and PATH fares
increasing to $1.50.</p>
<p>The bulk of the money was to be invested in the area's
three major airports, which are operated by the Port
Authority.</p>
<p>However, the governors of New York and New Jersey must
approve the budgets and increases.</p>
<p>Initial votes on the budget were put off and a new,
revised budget goes before the Port Authority's commissioners
on April 12.</p>
<p>Port Authority representatives declined to speak about any
possible pressures from the governors that caused the change.
The governors' offices did not immediately return telephone
calls seeking comment, but Nancy Kearney, spokeswoman for New
Jersey Gov. Jim Florio, told the Star-Ledger of Newark, "The
governor's office did not direct them to do this."</p>
<p>Hazel F. Gluck, a former New Jersey transportation
commissioner and current Port Authority commissioner, said
the agency's revised budget calls for a $33 million cut in
operating costs and the deferral of $300 million in
construction projects for both states.</p>
<p>She said she assumed that it was "hard to get staff {of
the two governors} to focus on an increase vis a vis the Port
Authority when they are trying to put a budget together."
Both states face sizable deficits.</p>
<p>Ms. Gluck said the lack of increases and the trimming of
the capital budget to about $900 million was reasonable --
for the time being.</p>
<p>The governors of both states will hear again about toll
hikes and PATH fare increases, this time for 1991.</p>
<p>"I'm sure that's going to come up for discussion again,"
Ms. Gluck said. "I think the Port can make a case for it."</p>
<p>She said she did not know how much nor in what form the
increases would be, "but it's not going to be every 18
months" nor will it hit the initially projected $6.</p>
