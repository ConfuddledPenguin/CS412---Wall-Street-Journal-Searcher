	<p class="article-leader">AKRON, Ohio -- B.F. Goodrich Co. said it will raise the
price of pipe-grade polyvinyl chloride resin on May 1 by two
cents a pound, bringing the rail-car price to 38 cents a
pound.
   Goodrich, a major producer of the widely used plastic,
announced an increase of three cents a pound last January.
The company said the increase took effect in stages during
March and April.</p>
