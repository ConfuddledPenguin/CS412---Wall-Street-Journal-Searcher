	<p class="article-leader">CONCERNS PROLIFERATE about the rapid spread of nuclear
technology.
   The Iraqi plot to smuggle nuclear trigger devices is "one
of hundreds of such enterprises they have going" around the
world, asserts Seth Carus, a Naval War College expert on
proliferation. Iraq also is shopping for high-speed
centrifuge components that can be used to make
highly-enriched uranium. Meanwhile, Iran has revived its
nuclear-research program.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>U.S. officials finger China as a key supplier of
nuclear-weapons technology. Intelligence reports say Beijing
may be providing copies of short-range Soviet Scud B missiles
to North Korea, helping Iraq get centrifuge material, and
providing missiles to Iran. Despite U.S. complaints, Israel
and South Africa continue jointly developing missiles and
possibly nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Nations that signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty
will soon consider condemning Iraq and North Korea.</p>
<p>STAGGERING GIANT? Disenchantment grows within the Soviet
military.</p>
<p>Draft-dodging is a special problem; more than 1,000
conscripts fled the Red Army during the first 10 days of
March alone. Unilateral Soviet force reductions in Eastern
Europe have cut younger officers adrift -- 173,000 military
families returning to civilian life are still seeking
housing. And last year, 59 Soviet officers were killed by
civilians, compared to just two in 1988.</p>
<p>U.S. analysts fear mounting frustrations could lead the
Soviet military to withdraw support from Gorbachev. They
believe the Soviet president's crackdown in Lithuania,
especially his pursuit of military deserters, may be designed
at least partly to retain the loyalty of the officer corps.</p>
<p>DARMAN SEEKS reconciliation with Congress on budget
matters.</p>
<p>The budget chief calls on Senate Majority Leader Mitchell
and Budget Chairman Sasser for the first time in months, and
meets with scores of rank-and-file Democrats. He stresses
that a budget accord is needed to reassure markets. The
lawmakers say he is now more conciliatory.</p>
<p>With up to $50 billion in across-the-board Gramm-Rudman
cuts looming if Congress doesn't act, "it's only a question
of when we get to negotiations," Darman says. But Democratic
leaders still shy away from a budget summit, and any accord
could take time to accomplish. Some expect no action until a
post-election session.</p>
<p>Rostenkowski still boosts his big deficit-reduction
package, though an aide concedes it is doomed unless there is
a budget crisis.</p>
<p>LAWMAKERS LAMBAST Cheney for favoring weapons over people
in the defense-budget battle. Sen. Glenn claims the defense
chief "pulled the rug right out from under" lawmakers
determined to maintain manpower levels. Even Gen. Hickey, who
is in charge of Air Force personnel issues, says, "I'm not
comfortable with how things are unfolding."</p>
<p>REPUBLICAN WOMEN organize to back GOP candidates who favor
abortion rights. Their group, Pro-Choice America, includes
Betty Ford. Some likely beneficiaries: GOP candidate Al Brown
against Democratic Rep. Mazzoli of Kentucky, and
gubernatorial candidates William Weld in Massachusetts and
Barbara Hafer in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>CONSERVATIVES STEAM as the Bush administration quietly
lifts a ban on exports to the Soviet Union's Kama River truck
plant. Reagan imposed the ban to show his firm line against
Moscow. He said the plant, built with help from U.S.
companies, was churning out military trucks used in
Afghanistan.</p>
<p>ACADEMIC PORK turns lean. Because of the budget crunch,
the House appropriations subcommittee on energy and water
development, a key benefactor for colleges, earmarks only
$37.5 million for them this year, down from $128 million two
years ago. A congressional backlash against academic lobbying
also lies behind growing opposition to pork barrel projects.</p>
<p>FRIENDLY PERSUASION? The White House talks compromise on
most issues.</p>
<p>After threatening vetoes last week over child care, aid to
Panama and Nicaragua and the Environmental Protection Agency,
the administration now says agreements are likely all around.
It looks to the House to fix the Senate's clean-air bill. The
Justice Department still recommends nixing the Senate's
job-discrimination bill, though.</p>
<p>At the president's behest, Senate Republicans drop a plan
to attach the capital-gains tax cut measure to a minor trade
bill. Instead, Treasury officials and aides to Finance
Chairman Bentsen discuss altering the proposal to make it
cost less or raising other taxes to pay for it. Packwood,
however, says he will attach the tax cut to the pending
child-care bill.</p>
<p>The conservative weekly Human Events says Bush "boots away
good GOP issues" by avoiding fights with the Democrats.</p>
<p>MINOR MEMOS: The black Muslim newspaper Final Call reports
on Rep. Gus Savage's encounters with the "racist white press"
and then offers tapes of Louis Farrakhan's interviews with
the Washington Post and Washington Times for $10 each. . . .
A senior administration official, speaking on background
about the National Security Strategy Report, says "the main
theme of this year's report is continuity and change." . . .
The National Bureau of Economic Research holds a conference
on the economics of aging -- in Carefree, Ariz.</p>
