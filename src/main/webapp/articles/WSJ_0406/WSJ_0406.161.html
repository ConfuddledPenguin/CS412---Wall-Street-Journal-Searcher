	<p class="article-leader">UAL Corp. directors launched an effort to nail down a
purchase agreement with United Airlines' three unions
following a sweetened bid from the group valued at more than
$4.36 billion, or $200 a share, people familiar with the
situation said.
   However, people following the talks noted that major
differences, including the price, remained between the board
and unions. "As a rational matter, they're so close they
could reach agreement," one official said. "But it's very
emotional, very tense on both sides. It could just as easily
break down."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The board's decision to begin acquisition talks came
yesterday evening following a day-long meeting in Chicago and
signaled the directors may be ready to accept the union offer
rather than fight a proxy battle with UAL's largest
shareholder, Coniston Partners. The New York investment firm
is pressing for an employee buyout.</p>
<p>Coniston, which owns 11.8% of UAL, was threatening to
begin soliciting shareholder votes to oust the board if the
directors didn't accept the offer at yesterday's meeting.</p>
<p>Although the offer was said to fall short of the board's
asking price of $220 a share, the directors were faced with
an unappetizing alternative of a proxy slugfest with its
major employee groups that could have further damaged the
nation's second largest airline.</p>
<p>The unusual union coalition of pilots, mechanics and
flight attendants coalesced earlier this year at the prodding
of both the board and Coniston following the collapse of a
$6.79 billion, $300-a-share, labor-management bid in October.</p>
<p>This time, the union decided to proceed without the
cooperation of UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf, who stands to be
ousted from his job if the labor group can pull off the
difficult task of obtaining financing.</p>
<p>If the board accepts the union offer, the question will
become whether or not banks will be willing to lend more than
$3 billion in cash for a buy-out led by a labor group that so
far lacks a major equity investor.</p>
<p>News of the board meeting to consider the union offer
lifted UAL stock as much as $3 a share in early trading
yesterday. But as the day wore on without any news of an
agreement, the shares weakened, closing down $1 a share to
$165.50 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The mechanics of the talks at yesterday's meeting were
complicated by the opposition of Mr. Wolf to an offer that
would cost him his job if the unions later obtain financing.
He is likely to remain in office as a lame duck until then if
a merger agreement is reached.</p>
<p>The board meeting began at 10:30 a.m. Central Daylight
Time, and the merger talks were still under way more than 10
hours later.</p>
<p>The unions sweetened the offer this week from their old
bid of roughly $4 billion, or about $185 a share, which they
made March 19. The offer, negotiated with Coniston, included
$150 a share in cash, $25 in debt, and an equity interest
totaling 25% in the airline.</p>
<p>This week, the unions increased the debt portion,
eliminated the 25% equity interest, and instead threw in
proceeds, expected to be about $500 million, of a prospective
sale of UAL's 50% interest in its Covia computer reservation
system.</p>
