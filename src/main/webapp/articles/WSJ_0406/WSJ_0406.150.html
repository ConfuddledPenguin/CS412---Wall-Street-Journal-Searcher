	<p class="article-leader">DEARBORN, Mich. -- Ford Motor Co. is holding discussions
on the possible sale of its Ford New Holland farm-equipment
subsidiary to Fiat S.p.A. of Italy, people familiar with the
situation said.
   Such a move would mark the second major retreat from
diversification by Ford in recent months. The No. 2 U.S. auto
maker already has announced that it wants to sell its Ford
Aerospace unit. The company wants to free capital and other
resources to concentrate on the increasingly competitive auto
industry worldwide, and to expand its financial-services
operations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Just three years ago Ford was aggressively expanding into
the agricultural-equipment business. The auto maker bought
the New Holland division of Sperry Corp. for $330 million and
combined it with the Ford Tractor division to form Ford New
Holland in January 1987. Later that year, Ford purchased
Versatile Corp., which makes large four-wheel drive tractors.</p>
<p>In all, Ford New Holland had sales of about $3 billion
last year. While significant by farm-equipment industry
standards, that was just a small portion of Ford's overall
revenue of $96.15 billion in 1989.</p>
<p>An announcement of the Ford-Fiat discussions could come as
early as today, said one individual familiar with the talks.
A Ford official referred inquiries to the Ford New Holland
subsidiary, where a spokesman said he wouldn't "comment on
speculation."</p>
<p>Ford and Fiat have a mixed record on completing deals. In
the mid-1980s they held intense and prolonged discussions
about merging their European automotive operations. But the
discussions fell apart when each side insisted on having
control of the combined business.</p>
<p>However, the two companies are partners in the heavy-truck
business in Europe. It's possible, said one industry insider,
that Fiat could swap its interest in that operation in return
for acquiring Ford New Holland.</p>
<p>Taking over Ford New Holland would make Fiat an instant
powerhouse in the U.S. as farmers continue their recent
buying spree. Its chief rivals would be Deere & Co. and the
JI Case unit of Tenneco Inc., which makes Case International
farm equipment.</p>
<p>Fiat's Geotech farm-equipment unit, which has major
operations in Europe, already owns Hesston Corp. in the U.S.,
a relatively small maker of farm implements. It wasn't
immediately clear what a Fiat purchase of New Holland would
mean for the joint venture that Hesston has with Case to make
hay and forage equipment.</p>
<p>However, if a deal is completed, it would "open up an
entire new market for exports of small farm tractors Fiat
builds in Europe," said John Stark, editor of Stark's
Off-Highway Ledger, a Chicagobased trade publication. "It
also gives Fiat flexibility for competing with Japanese
{farm-equipment} companies in Europe in 1992."</p>
<p>In the U.S., Fiat would face the same challenge that
plagues Ford: Ford New Holland's tractors and farm equipment
have loyal customers in what industry officials call the
"horseshoe" from the East Coast through the South and up the
West Coast. But it is relatively weak in the heartland, where
Deere and Case are dominant.</p>
<p>Ford New Holland has about 17,000 employees and does
business in 120 countries, but most of its sales are in North
America and Europe. Besides tractors, it makes combines,
forage equipment and hay-making machines.</p>
