	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Copper futures further declined on the
likelihood that settlement of a Peruvian mine-workers strike
is near.
   The May-delivery contract eased 1.25 cents a pound, to
$1.1890, for a two-day loss of 5.95 cents.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The strike, which began March 12, involves Southern Peru
Copper Corp. workers at two mines and a smelter.</p>
<p>"The company said Wednesday that reports of a settlement
that caused prices to plunge were untrue, but traders
nevertheless feel that a new pact will be agreed upon Sunday
when workers take a vote," said Richard Hirsch of Sharps
Pixley Inc., a New York metals broker.</p>
<p>As a result, Mr. Hirsch said, prices in London were weak,
and the selling continued when New York opened.
Computer-guided funds were particularly aggressive sellers as
they sought to take profits from recent advances, he said.</p>
<p>The liquidation drove the May price as low as $1.1825,
where it leveled off and recovered slightly toward the close.</p>
<p>Despite the softer tone of the market, Mr. Hirsch said
that the current price may prove attractive to
bargain-hunters and that the market has the potential to
stage a recovery.</p>
<p>"The fundamentals, such as tight supplies and continued
steady demand, are still present," he said.</p>
<p>He added that on April 17, the U.S. Mint will be in the
market to buy eight million pounds of copper, to be delivered
in May. "It will be interesting to see what kind of impact
the mint's action will have at a time of shrinking
inventories," Mr. Hirsch said.</p>
<p>Fred D'Agostino, president of Metals Resources Corp., a
Riverside, Conn., metals-trading firm, said that while the
market has correctly declined on the perception that a
settlement will soon be reached, the longer-term impact of
the strike apparently hasn't been taken into account.</p>
<p>"Certainly, the end of the strike removes a production
disruption that heightened the concern about supplies and
caused prices to rise," he said. "But even after an agreement
is reached, it will be several days to a week before full
production is resumed. Add that to the 3 1/2 weeks the
workers have been out, and you get a significant production
loss that isn't going to be made up."</p>
<p>There have been estimates that approximately 20,000 tons
of copper production had been lost. "That's more or less
about right. The loss isn't being felt now, but in time it
will work through the pipeline and have an impact at the
consumption level," Mr. D'Agostino said.</p>
<p>John Gross, president of J.E. Gross & Associates Inc., a
New City, N.Y., copper-industry consultant, said the market
"appeared to have lost momentum" in reacting so sharply
Wednesday to the incorrect report of the mine workers'
settlement.</p>
<p>"Not only did the price decline Wednesday, but again
{yesterday}," he said. "I think there may be a test of $1.17
{a pound} for the May contract. If it breaks below that, the
drop could be as low as $1.15."</p>
<p>However, he said, "one has to consider the fundamentals,
which have been a price-supporting factor. This could lead to
sharp price movements, one way or another."</p>
<p>In other commodity markets yesterday:</p>
<p>GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Prices of corn contracts for delivery
this year rose slightly on continuing rumors that the Soviet
Union is interested in buying U.S. corn, said Susan Leighty,
grain analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., New York.
Corn for May delivery rose two cents to close at $2.7025 a
bushel. Traders are speculating that the Soviet Union is
seeking 1.5 million to two million metric tons of U.S. corn.
One sign that a major export deal might be in the works is
that river barges are raising rates for carrying freight to
the Gulf of Mexico. Much of the corn that is exported from
the U.S. moves from the Midwest down the Mississippi River to
New Orleans. The Soviet Union hasn't been a big purchaser of
U.S. corn since its record-setting buying spree last fall.
Those purchases clogged Soviet ports through much of the
winter. Prices of most wheat futures contracts dipped
slightly yesterday amid profit-taking. Wheat prices at the
Chicago Board of Trade had jumped Wednesday on reports that
Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs owns about half of the
wheat stored in CBOT-approved warehouses in Toledo, Ohio, and
Chicago. CBOT traders use wheat stored in those warehouses to
satisfy their delivery obligations. In reaction to
Wednesday's price move, The Board of Trade more than doubled
speculative margin requirements on May wheat futures to $945
a contract from $405. Futures margins are good-faith deposits
and are raised or lowered by exchanges in response to
changing price volatility.</p>
<p>COFFEE: Futures prices closed higher despite late
profit-taking that trimmed early gains. The May-delivery
contract rose 1.76 cents a pound, to 96.75 cents. At its
highest level of the day, the May contract was at 98.50 cents
a pound. Early strength was prompted by the perception that
Brazil wouldn't auction 17 million bags of coffee that the
Brazilian Coffee Institute has in store, and the belief that
Brazil would establish a minimum price for coffee exports,
said Sandra Kaul, an analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton, New
York. There had been a report that, since the institute is in
the process of being phased out, its supplies would be sold,
she said. However, it was later reported that Brazil would
impose a "floating price" formula that would keep selling
prices in line with world prices, she said. The development
led to cautiousness among traders because of the vagueness
and complexity of the new rules. But the new rules will allow
coffee to be shipped again, after three weeks of export
paralysis, Ms. Kaul noted. Since Brazil is expected to ship
about seven million bags of coffee during the period from
April through June, there should be less concern over
near-term supplies, she said. A bag of coffee weighs 132
pounds.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices fell from early firmness
and ended with moderate losses. The May silver contract was
off 2.2 cents an ounce to $5.1680. June gold declined $2.50
an ounce to $379.30. July platinum fell $4.00 an ounce to
$484.20. A metals analyst said silver's strength in London
influenced its early trading gains in New York. But the rally
stalled after May silver traded at its high for the day of
$5.2450, and prices fell. "The $5.25 level has been a strong
resistance level for silver," one analyst said. He pointed
out that silver prices have failed several times since
February to rise above that price. Thus far, there have been
no fundamental factors to account for the rise in the silver
price, which has been wholly chart-related, the analyst said.</p>
