	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. agreed to
transfer part of its Boston Co. money-management unit to a
new joint venture, a move that will raise more than $10
million for Shearson.
   In a move that was expected, Shearson, a securities-firm
unit of American Express Co., said it would transfer about $6
billion of Boston Co.'s money-management business into a new
joint venture with Nippon Life Insurance Co.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The joint venture, in which Nippon will hold a 50% stake,
will be called PanAgora Asset Management Inc. and be based in
Boston. A related PanAgora joint venture was established last
year in London.</p>
<p>Shearson said it will receive compensation from Nippon in
exchange for the asset transfer. The amount of the
compensation wasn't disclosed, but individuals in the
industry said it was probably $10 million to $15 million.</p>
<p>The part of Boston Co. being transferred to the PanAgora
venture is its Structured Investment Products Group, which
specializes in so-called index funds, asset allocation and
research for institutional investors.</p>
<p>Shearson has been trying to cut costs and replenish its
capital. The securities firm on Monday said it expects to
report a first-quarter loss of $897 million to $917 million,
a securities-industry record, mainly because of charges it
will take to pay for office closings and other parts of its
big retrenchment plan. Included in the expected first-quarter
loss, Shearson said, is $25 million in reserves for losses
primarily on loans made by Boston Co.</p>
<p>Nippon has had a 13% interest in Shearson since 1987
through its holding of Shearson preferred stock. That
interest will decline to approximately 8% when American
Express completes a plan in which it will buy the rest of
Shearson's common stock outstanding.</p>
