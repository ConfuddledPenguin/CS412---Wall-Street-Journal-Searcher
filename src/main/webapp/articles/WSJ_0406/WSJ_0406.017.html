	<p class="article-leader">MIDDLETOWN, R.I. -- Neco Enterprises Inc. shareholders, at
a special adjourned meeting, approved two proposals ratifying
the purchases of certain assets of its chairman and principal
stockholder, David F. LaRoche.
   The transactions required approval of holders of 80% of
the company's stock. Mr. LaRoche, who holds an approximate
stake of 75% of the Providence-based diversified company, was
allowed to vote only 73% of the shares outstanding on the
proposals.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The assets, including a Rhode Island mobile-home
community, and resort properties in Quechee, Vt., were sold
to Neco for a total of $24.4 million last June.</p>
