	<div class="article-body"><p>ARNHEM, the Netherlands -- As far as Marlou Terhorts is
concerned, this is no time for the European Community to be
dismantling what's left of its national frontiers.</p>
<p>Standing at a bus stop here, nine miles from the border
with West Germany, the 19-year-old says she isn't eager to be
a member of a club that will have 16 million new German
members. With German reunification looming, she argues, a
time of reflection is needed before border controls are
removed or the Dutch currency is exchanged for a European
one.</p>
<p>"When Dutch people go to Germany, we speak German," says
Miss Terhorts. "But when the Germans come to Holland, they
treat it like it's theirs. Now is not the time for uniting
Europe."</p>
<p>The European dream of economic unity is bumping up against
the reality of German reunification. While the EC's drive to
tear down remaining trade barriers inside the 12-nation bloc
continues to enjoy widespread public support, a substantial
minority is voicing fears that a powerful, reunited Germany
will hold economic sway over its smaller neighbors.</p>
<p>Europe's leaders say a united EC in which most big
decisions are to be shared by all members should allay the
anxieties surrounding a united Germany. They want to push
forward with both economic and monetary union, eventually
including a single currency, and political union, buttressed
by joint institutions to handle foreign policy, trade
relations, and other matters. They say such common
institutions, which will require at least several years to
realize, will guarantee that no EC country will ever again be
able to use its economic or political power against another.</p>
<p>But moving ahead quickly with this agenda won't be easy.
In Arnhem, a city of 130,000 inhabitants painfully scarred by
the war, people aren't always sure unity is the answer. While
they are mostly delighted by the lessening of tensions in the
East and hopeful about the business opportunities change will
bring, they also have vivid memories of their nation's past
powerlessness compared with a united Germany.</p>
<p>Willem de Kat says such issues are a source of lively
debate these days in the living rooms of Arnhem, sometimes
dividing families and cutting across generations and economic
classes. The 28-year-old proprietor of a fix-it shop called
Handyman is convinced that the events under way in Europe
today will be manageable. But, he says, "My father fought in
the war. He is still a bit suspicious of the Germans."</p>
<p>Public-opinion surveys show that people in the small
countries of northern Europe are the most wary of German
unity and its effects on their countries. The most recent
Pan-EC survey -- taken in November during the euphoric
international reaction to the opening of the Berlin Wall --
showed that more than one in five Dutch, Belgians, Danes and
Luxembourgers were against both German unification and
further steps toward EC integration. On average, that is
about twice the negative response found in the Mediterranean
countries.</p>
<p>These emotions blossom on the streets of Arnhem. "A united
Europe would undoubtedly be better," says Annie Geresee,
drinking coffee with her elderly mother in a cafe. "But I
don't think it's possible under the present circumstances."</p>
<p>Ms. Geresee says she is afraid of having the Netherlands
overrun with foreigners, including East bloc residents
seeking better living conditions. "We shouldn't open the
borders any more than they already are," she says.</p>
<p>In the 45 years since the Battle of Arnhem, memories of
the war have refused to fade. Over eight days in September
1944, 80% of the city was reduced to rubble by bombing. In
recent weeks, some people here have felt as if they were
watching a replay of the uncertain years between the two
world wars. The continuing controversy over the security of
Poland's western border, in particular, has been a sharp
reminder of the 1930s, when no borders were sacred.</p>
<p>Alex, a 26-year-old administrator of a construction firm,
also fears that neither the Netherlands nor the EC is strong
enough to hold Germany down. When the four victorious allies
agreed last month in Ottawa to allow the two Germanys to
unite, Dutch, Belgian and Danish leaders didn't get to say a
word.</p>
<p>"A united Europe might help protect the interests of small
nations," Alex says. "But all of this has started too late.
If the EC had united 10 years ago, they would have been able
to have some say. But the changes are happening too fast, and
the EC cannot react properly in so little time."</p>
<p>West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, trying to reassure his
EC partners, told journalists in Brussels last Friday that he
would support a quickened pace toward EC monetary and
political union, and that he wants to build the new Germany
firmly into a united EC. "We want to be European Germans and
German Europeans," he said.</p>
<p>In Arnhem, it is businessmen who are most eager to have
the controversy about Germany cleared up. The closer ties
they have built up with the Germans through the EC are
directly responsible for much of the economic success that
the Netherlands has enjoyed in recent years. And recently,
Arnhem chose the East German city of Gera as its sister city,
partly with the hope that the Netherlands will share in the
economic revival of East Germany.</p>
