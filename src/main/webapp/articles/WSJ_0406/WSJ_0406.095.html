	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- USX Corp. Chairman Charles A. Corry said
investor Carl Icahn's proposal to split the company's steel
and energy operations would cost the company an additional
$100 million to $120 million a year.
   Moreover, Mr. Corry asserted that Mr. Icahn's $48-a-share
value on a divided USX is the result of "a lightweight
analytical job." He noted, for example, that the more
cyclical steel segment was given the same high asset and
market ratio as the more attractive oil operations. Mr.
Icahn's analysis was also based on asset values, rather than
earnings and cash flow, he said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>If accepted, Mr. Icahn's proposal would result in steeper
interest expenses incurred by a separate steel company
borrowing at about an 11 1/2% rate, compared with the
company's average 8 1/2% rate. That alone would cost $45
million more annually to cover the steel company's $1.5
billion in debt, Mr. Corry said.</p>
<p>In addition, separating the steel business from the parent
would add $20 million to $30 million a year to the combined
entities' insurance expenses. Two separate companies would
also result in higher state taxes and new administrative and
management costs. "The companies aren't going to be as
profitable as they are in a common shell," because they'd
each have costs currently spread between them, Mr. Corry
argued.</p>
<p>The executive said one issue -- the $900 million in
tax-loss carry-forwards -- would resolve itself by year end
because if the businesses are kept together USX would earn
enough to use up the steel-related tax losses that have
sheltered energy-related earnings.</p>
<p>But he questioned whether the proposed spinoff would be
tax-free, as Mr. Icahn indicated. That condition would have
to be determined by the Internal Revenue Service, which would
require a number of complex conditions, Mr. Corry said.</p>
<p>Mr. Icahn defended his analysis by saying it did take cash
flow into account, and did assign different valuation
multiples to the steel and energy units. He also said his
lawyers advised him the split-up could be executed on a
tax-free basis.</p>
<p>He said any extra interest cost for steel could be offset
by lower interest costs for energy operations, but added that
he didn't agree there would be extra steel interest costs. As
for extra state taxes and administrative costs, he said, "If
you take that to its final conclusion, then everything should
be conglomeratized, and we saw the devastating results of
conglomerates in the 1970s."</p>
<p>In proxy materials mailed this week to USX shareholders,
Mr. Icahn advocated the split-up of the Marathon Oil unit and
U.S. Steel, arguing that the separate businesses would be
valued at about 30% above the current market price, or $48 a
share. USX closed yesterday at $36.375, down 12.5 cents, in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Mr. Icahn
is USX's largest investor with a 13.3% stake. Shareholders
will vote on his proposal at a May 7 annual meeting.</p>
