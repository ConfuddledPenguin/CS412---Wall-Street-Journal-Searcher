	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Europe's Berd is going to fly.
   The so-called Banque Europeene pour la Reconstruction et
Developpement, or Berd, is back on the launch pad, planners
say -- although this comes amid nagging questions over the
need for yet another international financial institution.
According to a negotiator for the European Community, there's
a solid consensus on 54 of 58 articles of confederation. The
remaining differences, he said, can be settled or at least
smoothed over at a Paris meeting Sunday and Monday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As the West's principal vehicle for transfusing the
ravaged East bloc economies, the new bank will begin with
about $12 billion to lend to companies and selected public
works. Planners stress that the Berd's loans will come
wrapped in lots of advice about how to set up a
private-enterprise economy and help it flourish.</p>
<p>So far, though, the East Europeans mainly have been given
a lesson in how Western aid gets filtered through a mesh of
egos and jostling political interests.</p>
<p>The French uncorked the idea of a new reconstruction bank
in November at a summit in Strasbourg. Britain was initially
cool to it, but came around in time to churn out a glossy,
trilingual brochure explaining that "from opera to
athletics," London is the logical home for the bank.
Meanwhile, other would-be hosts were elbowing in: Serious
contenders include Amsterdam, Berlin, Copenhagen, and Vienna,
as well as Prague and Budapest from the East bloc.</p>
<p>Within this competitive caldron, compromises bubble up
almost daily. One talked-of bargain has London hosting the
bank, but accepting as its President Jacques Attali, aide to
French president Francois Mitterrand. Another scenario floats
the Berd back to the continent, but places Onno Ruding, the
former Dutch finance minister and a strong British ally, in
the top job. (This scenario collapses if Algemene Bank
Nederland NV and Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV merge and ask
Mr. Ruding to run the combined bank.)</p>
<p>Even the working labels seem to flow from Pan-European
compromises: the acronym, Berd, comes from the bank's French
name, while the official title is the Anglicized European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development.</p>
<p>Lost in the debates over name and place is the fundamental
question of why the Berd should exist. "It's another of
Mitterrand's monuments," says one London economist who
insists on staying anonymous. "It's the
multiplication-of-entities principle."</p>
<p>The World Bank and its affiliated International Finance
Corp. are already doing the sort of financing jobs that the
Berd would take on. Then there's the European Investment Bank
and the International Monetary Fund. Not to be outdone, the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has set
up a new office to advise East bloc economic reformers.</p>
<p>Sir William Ryrie, head of International Finance, said in
a recent interview that he worries about his organization and
the Berd both pursuing the same projects. If the Berd's terms
are more generous, he warns, International Finance could see
clients drift away.</p>
<p>Even the Berd's most vigorous supporters concede that it
will take more time and money to set up a new institution
than to expand those already up and running. "You could
probably do more lending faster by using the existing
institutions," says one European central banker. However,
critics risk looking like spoilers who won't support the East
bloc's courageous march to freedom and economic health.</p>
<p>Discussing the Berd at a congressional hearing in
Washington, U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said,
"Let's conjure up the headlines if we didn't join this." The
U.S., after an internal fracas over its level of
participation, has assured its allies that it will weigh in
with a contribution of about 10%.</p>
<p>Berd's planners also have agreed that the new bank will
devote at least 60% of its resources to private-sector
enterprises. The remainder would go to government
"infrastructure" projects that would help private companies
function: more working telephones and rail cars, fewer
poisonous dumps. There are continuing worries that even with
the emphaisis on private-sector projects, the new bank will
add to the debt burdens of nations already heavily indebted.</p>
<p>The biggest worries involve the Soviet Union. "The size of
the country is such that they could bankrupt the bank," says
the EC negotiator. He adds that in the coming Paris meeting,
"we will come up with a way to let them in -- but fence
them."</p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury's negotiator, David Mulford, has
suggested limiting Soviet borrowings for five years to
amounts equal to the capital it paid in. Moreover, Berd loans
to the Soviet Union would be restricted to private companies
and special technical assistance under the Mulford proposal.</p>
