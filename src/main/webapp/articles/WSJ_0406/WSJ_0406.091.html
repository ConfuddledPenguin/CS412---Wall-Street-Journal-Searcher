	<p class="article-leader">BRIDGEPORT, Conn. -- A Superior Court jury rejected a
Westport delicatessen owner's claim that he was promised a
stake in actor Paul Newman's gourmet food companies.
   The jury found that Mr. Newman never promised Julius Gold
an 8% stake in the companies, Newman's Own Inc. and Salad
King Inc.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Gold contended that he was involved in marketing
efforts as well as manufacturing and bottling operations
since the business began, said his attorney, Richard
Albrecht. Mr. Newman first started the business by making
salad dressing in the basement of his Westport, Conn., home.
The line later expanded to include spaghetti sauce, popcorn
and lemonade.</p>
<p>"Mr. Gold naturally is disappointed but is not totally
surprised," said Mr. Albrecht. "He recognized that he was
going after an extremely popular institution predicated on an
oral agreement."</p>
<p>Attorneys for Mr. Newman said they were "delighted" with
the results. "Paul Newman has always said Newman's Own is
Newman's own and the jury agreed," said W. Patrick Ryan, one
of Mr. Newman's attorneys.</p>
<p>All profits from the companies, $28 million to date, have
gone to charity, according to the Associated Press. The
Westport-based companies had a record $42 million in sales
last year, up from $36 million in 1988, the AP reported.</p>
<p>"It's just tragic, all of this energy and time could not
have been spent in more charitable pursuits, but that's the
nature of the beast," Mr. Newman told the AP after the
verdict.</p>
