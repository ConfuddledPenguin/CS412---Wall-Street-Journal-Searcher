	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Imagine Films Entertainment Inc. said it
postponed its annual meeting for the second time because it
is still negotiating the termination of Robert Harris,
president of motion pictures and television.
   The meeting was scheduled for 10 a.m. PDT and the
company's explanation wasn't released until after the stock
market closed. Meanwhile, Imagine shares climbed sharply to
$16.25 each, up $1.50, in over-the-counter trading amid
speculation the company was negotiating a merger.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company's meeting originally was scheduled for March
21. Imagine Films, which was formed by producers Ron Howard
and Brian Grazer five years ago and went public in 1986, has
produced such movies as "Parenthood," "The Dream Team" and
"The Burbs."</p>
<p>Mike Meltzer, Imagine's chief financial officer, said, "We
aren't negotiating with anyone."</p>
<p>Mr. Meltzer said the stock may have climbed because the
company's latest movie, "Cry-Baby," opens today and "the
reviews have been good." He also noted that shares in New
Line Cinema Corp. climbed before the release of the hit movie
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles."</p>
<p>Mr. Meltzer said the postponement of the annual meeting
was necessary since Mr. Harris is on the company's board. Mr.
Harris wasn't available for comment.</p>
<p>Christopher Dixon, an analyst at Kidder Peabody & Co,
said, "Many of the smaller film companies tend to trade up on
the potential opening of movies."</p>
