	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The U.S. and Japan reached an accord
designed to make it easier for Americans and other foreigners
to do business in Japan, while increasing U.S. savings and
competitiveness.
   If fully implemented, the agreement would be a watershed
in relations between the two nations. But it would require
legislative changes in both countries, which may be difficult
to achieve.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Japan agreed to open its retailing system, boost public
works spending, loosen its clubby business practices, and
strengthen antitrust legislation and patent protection. In
addition, Tokyo pledged to relax restrictive land-use
policies and restraints on foreign investment.</p>
<p>The U.S., for its part, reiterated President Bush's
promises to encourage savings through tax changes, improve
education, expand research and development efforts, cut the
federal deficit, promote exports and liberalize imports of
steel and machine tools. American officials also pledged to
state clearly that the U.S. welcomes foreign investment. They
pointed to Washington's recent liberalization of energy
exports, particularly of Alaskan crude oil and liquefied
natural gas. The Commerce Department also has recently
recommended a partial relaxation on the ban of exports of
heavy crude oil from California. But the administration needs
congressional approval for many of its pledges, including one
to cut capital-gains taxes.</p>
<p>The accord culminates negotiations that began last July to
address "structural impediments" to the U.S.-Japan economic
relationship. An interim report describing areas of agreement
will be followed by a final report in July.</p>
<p>"I think the report demonstrates progress and hard work on
both sides," U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said.
"It's the first time the government of Japan has gone through
such a process and committed to remove barriers to trade."
She said Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu showed
"courage and leadership" in following this "unique approach
and report."</p>
<p>At a news conference this morning in Tokyo, Mr. Kaifu
said, "I rate this highly as an achievement of joint exercise
by the two governments." He added that talks will "benefit
not only the two countries but also the whole world, serve to
prevent the rise of protectionism, and thus contribute to the
steady development of the world economy."</p>
<p>But the report already is attracting skepticism,
particularly from Congress. "Put me down as a skeptic who's
seen too many agreements in which the results don't match the
rhetoric," said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, (D., Texas), chairman of
the Senate Finance Committee. Previous U.S.-Japan trade
agreements "were like nothing so much as a drugstore cowboy
-- all hat and no cattle," the senator said.</p>
<p>Just as some people in Washington question whether Japan
gave enough, critics in Tokyo are complaining that Japan gave
too much, particularly on retailing. The Japan Chamber of
Commerce and Industry released a statement saying there could
be "problems" from changing the distribution system and from
toughening antitrust penalties. Mr. Kaifu, in his news
conference, said Japan's measures "have been attained after
undergoing a difficult domestic process, and their
implementation may, in some cases, be painful." But, he said,
they are "essential in furthering Japan's own national
interest."</p>
<p>He acknowledged that many of the changes will require the
cooperation of the opposition parties, which control the
upper house of the Diet.</p>
<p>In the interim report, Japan promised to amend and
strengthen its anti-monopoly law to combat exclusionary
business practices, and also will strengthen its Fair Trade
Commission. It also will speed up its patent-approval
process, which frequently has frustrated foreign businessmen
seeking to protect their intellectual property.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Japanese will increase disclosure of the
close "keiretsu" links between companies, which can promote
preferential group trade and anti-competitive business
practices. "We believe if the people of Japan have a better
understanding of this arrangement, there will be change,"
said Assistant Treasury Secretary Charles Dallara.</p>
<p>In addition, Tokyo will cut down the approval time
required for licensing large retail stores to 18 months
initially, and then to 12 months, from the current indefinite
period that's sometimes as long as 10 years. Stores that
devote roughly 1,000 square feet or more to foreign goods
will be granted licenses immediately. Japan also will seek to
ensure that it can clear imports any time of day; past delays
-- particularly for perishable goods -- have been costly to
foreign companies.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Japanese have said they'll speed up eight
large public spending projects, including ports and airports,
which could mean business for American companies. They also
will abolish requirements that foreigners give notification
before investing in Japan. And they pledged a full review of
their land taxation system. Critics contend this system has
restricted land use and pushed up prices to prohibitive
levels, making it difficult for foreigners to buy into their
market.</p>
<p>Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Linn Williams said the
talks have "engendered a broad public debate in Japan" that
resulted in widespread approval of many of the measures that
the U.S. was requesting. "This is the first time they've
acknowledged there are barriers and made an attempt to
address them," he added. Michael Farren, an assistant
Commerce Department secretary, said the ruling Japanese party
now realizes that "the ultimate beneficiary (of the reforms
the U.S. requested) is the Japanese consumer."</p>
<p>Some U.S. observers are dubious. "I think we've been here
before," said Clyde Prestowitz, of the Economic Strategy
Institute, a Washington-based think tank. "I'm reminded of
Yogi Berra's comment that this is deja vu all over again,"
said Mr. Prestowitz, a former Commerce Department official
who negotiated trade issues with Japan.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Hills said, "I think there are very real
commitments to remove a number of structural impediments."
She indicated, however, that it would be "premature" for her
to decide whether to list Japan again this year as an unfair
trading partner under the Super 301 designation process. A
decision is expected on that issue at the end of this month.</p>
<p>Japan's stock market and its currency have declined
sharply in recent weeks. There has been speculation that the
U.S. might use Japan's desire for international support for
its currency as a bargaining chip in the bilateral trade
talks. But State Department Undersecretary Richard McCormack,
who led the U.S. negotiating team, and Mr. Dallara denied
there was any trade-off or link between these talks and other
negotiations.</p>
<p>This weekend, the Group of Seven industrialized countries
-- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and
Canada -- are scheduled to meet in Paris to discuss the
coordination of their macroeconomic policies. That meeting is
expected to discuss ways to shore up the weakened yen.</p>
<p>In the interim report, Japan promised to amend and
strengthen its anti-monopoly law to provide stronger
penalties and ensure private damage remedies are effective,
said James Rill, the Justice Department's antitrust chief.
Japanese officials also agreed to strengthen the country's
Fair Trade Commission and speed up its patent-approval
process, which frequently has frustrated foreign businessmen
seeking to protect their intellectual property.</p>
<p>Together, the U.S. and Japan account for more than
one-third of world-wide economic output. Japanese exports to
the U.S. totaled $93.6 billion in 1989, while U.S. exports to
Japan totaled $44.6 billion, leaving a $49 billion U.S. trade
deficit.</p>
