	<p class="article-leader">SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Businessland Inc. said it expects to
report a third-quarter net loss of about $2 million,
reflecting soft retail sales and lower profit margins
overseas.
   The news surprised analysts who had been expecting profit
of $4 million to $5 million. Analysts said Businessland as
late as this past month indicated the quarter would be
profitable. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading
yesterday, the computer retailer fell $1.50 to $8.875.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the year-earlier quarter, net income was $8.5 million,
or 27 cents a share. The company said it expects to report
revenue for the latest quarter ended March 31 grew 9% to
about $320 million from $293.3 million.</p>
<p>Businessland said new product announcements from Apple
Computer Inc. and International Business Machines Corp. in
mid-March caused "unanticipated slowing" in the market, as
customers delayed purchases in order to evalute the new
offerings.</p>
<p>Apple Computer has said it expects to post
better-than-expected results for the quarter ended March 30,
spurred by sales of its newer personal computers.</p>
<p>Businessland's chairman, David Norman, said that a
strategy "to put a cap on discounts" affected sales, and in
some cases "we were not competitive with Apple." In addition,
he said some "sales people lost their focus" in the quarter,
as Businessland geared up to start selling Compaq Computer
Corp.'s products once again. However, Compaq products didn't
begin shipping until this month.</p>
<p>Early last month, Businessland said it would begin selling
Compaq products, after a feud between the companies caused
Compaq to halt sales to Businessland for nearly a year. That
announcement boosted Businessland's stock 23% in one day, to
$10.75.</p>
<p>Mr. Norman said the company's U.K. operations and its
Computer Craft unit weren't profitable in the third quarter.
He said cost-cutting moves, including firing 15 to 20 of the
270 employees in the U.K. may bring U.K. operations back to
profitability this quarter.</p>
<p>Businessland said it would also take an unspecified
write-down for inventory of certain service parts. In the
second quarter, the company took a $7.5 million charge for
the closure of 19 retail centers, and the dismissal of as
much as 7% of its work force.</p>
<p>Sales of Next Inc. computers, the company headed by Steve
Jobs, co-founder of Apple, were "building momentum" in the
third quarter but were "below plan," Mr. Norman said. Last
year, Mr. Norman signed on as exclusive dealer for Next,
which has been off to a slow start.</p>
