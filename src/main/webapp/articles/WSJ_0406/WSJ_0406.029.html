	<p class="article-leader">ROCHESTER, N.Y. -- Eastman Kodak Co. pleaded guilty to two
misdemeanor violations of New York environmental law and paid
the state a $2 million fine.
   Kodak, which had been accused of contaminating ground
water at Kodak Park, its core manufacturing facility, also
signed a consent order to do extensive cleanup work at the
site. Company officials didn't have an immediate estimate on
how much that would cost.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Kodak has already agreed to spend $100 million to replace
or remove 1,013 chemical storage tanks in the wake of
hometown furor over toxic spills. It also agreed to reduce
emissions of methylene chloride, a suspected cancer-causing
chemical, by 70% by 1995. But New York State Attorney General
Robert Abrams yesterday charged the company must still
"remedy decades of environmental abuse."</p>
<p>Kodak pleaded guilty to unlawful removal of hazardous
waste in connection with a July 1, 1986, shipment of 48,900
pounds of contaminated soil to a silver-recovery plant. State
officials said Kodak failed to file proper hazardous waste
documents and ensure that the waste hauler and reclamation
plant were licensed to handle the hazardous soil.</p>
