	<p class="article-leader">WEST CHESTER, Pa. -- QVC Network Inc. said it expects to
report a loss of about $10 million, or about 59 cents a
share, for the first quarter ending April 30. The company
said the loss reflects the costs of absorbing CVN Cos.,
acquired last fall.
   A year earlier, the video-shopping concern posted net
income of $1.2 million, or eight cents a share. Last month,
QVC suspended its quarterly dividend of 10 cents a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>QVC also said its agreement to sell its C.O.M.B.
mail-order business to Damark International Inc. was
terminated because conditions of closing weren't satisfied,
specifically with regard to financing the transaction.</p>
<p>QVC said it also expects a loss in the second quarter but
is "confident" it will return to profitability in the third
quarter. The company added that it hopes to earn $7 million
for the year ending Jan. 31, 1991, compared with $6.3 million
the previous year.</p>
<p>QVC said it is reopening the bidding for the customer
lists, goodwill, and other intangible assets of C.O.M.B. The
mail-order business has only $4 million in inventory, and QVC
said the final disposition of C.O.M.B. will have no material
effect on QVC's financial reports. QVC acquired C.O.M.B. last
fall as part of its purchase of CVN. In February, QVC agreed
to sell C.O.M.B. to Damark contingent on financing and
government approval.</p>
