	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- International Telecharge Inc. said that talks
about a possible sale of the company have ended and that
Allan L. Rayfield, a former telecommunications executive, was
named chairman and chief executive officer.
   The company, which provides operator-assisted
long-distance service to hotels, hospitals and pay phones,
said that discussions to sell the company to a suitor ended
before a formal offer was made. The potential acquirer wasn't
disclosed. International Telecharge said last month that it
had received an inquiry about a possible acquisition.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company also said that it named Mr. Rayfield, a
company director, to the two top posts, succeeding Edmund F.
Tagg, who was chairman, chief executive officer and
president. Mr. Tagg, who remains a director, now will serve
as president and chief operating officer, succeeding Dennis
Geraghty, formerly chief operating officer, who resigned, the
company said.</p>
<p>Mr. Rayfield was a senior vice president and director of
GTE Corp. until a year ago. Since then, he has been a
consultant.</p>
<p>International Telecharge also said that it has agreed to
provide operator services to hotel and hospital customers of
MCI Communications Corp. as part of an agreement calling for
International Telecharge to become a large customer of MCI's
long-distance network. International Telecharge said the pact
reduces its long-distance line costs, and that it calls for
MCI to market its operator, billing and collection services
for hotels under the MCI name.</p>
<p>As part of the agreement, MCI returned warrants to
purchase 2,986,895 International Telecharge shares to
International Telecharge and agreed to provide a
working-capital loan of undisclosed size to defray
development costs for the hospitality services.</p>
<p>In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
International Telecharge rose 12.5 cents to close at $3.125 a
share.</p>
