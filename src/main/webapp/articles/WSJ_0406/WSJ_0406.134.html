	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Salomon Inc. said first-quarter pretax
earnings for its securities firm will exceed $200 million,
but its energy and commodities businesses together are
expected to post a small loss.
   Salomon's estimates were better than many analysts
expected, boosting the stock 12.5 cents to $21.375 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The gains at its Salomon Brothers Inc. unit apparently
stemmed from trading for the securities firm's own account
and don't indicate improving conditions on Wall Street,
analysts say. Earnings will be disclosed April 24.</p>
<p>"Salomon stands out as unique in the quarter," says Alison
Deans, a securities industry analyst for Kidder, Peabody &
Co. "One individual firm making lots of money by trading
doesn't signal a turn in the market."</p>
<p>Both the bond and international stock markets were
volatile in the first quarter, catering to two of Salomon's
strengths. But most other traditional securities businesses
-- notably investment banking and individual-investor
activity -- softened in the quarter. Analysts said the
securities firms that post the best first-quarter results
will be helped greatly by trading gains.</p>
<p>John H. Gutfreund, chairman, said Salomon Brothers's gains
"are broadly based, spanning both product and geographical
lines." But Salomon's other operating units didn't fare as
well. Results for Philipp Brothers, the commodities unit,
"continue to be disappointing," Mr. Gutfreund said; the unit
is expected to post a pretax loss of less than $25 million,
analysts say. And Phibro Energy is expected to post a modest
profit, Salomon says; the energy unit made up for sharp
losses in January and February with gains in March, analysts
said.</p>
<p>The results underscore the volatility of trading firms
such as Salomon. Last year, the parent company had a
consolidated pretax loss of $72 million for the first
quarter, then pretax gains of $453 million, $278 million and
$81 million in successive quarters.</p>
<p>Says James Hanbury, an analyst for Wertheim Schroder &
Co.: "Any company that has consecutive quarterly results like
this one cannot be easy to forecast."</p>
