	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Growth in consumer debt continued to slow in
February, the Federal Reserve Board reported.
   Consumer installment credit expanded $3.42 billion during
the month, a 5.7% annual rate, according to the Fed. That was
the smallest rise since last October and followed rates of
6.4% and 7.3% in January and December, respectively.
Originally, the January rate was estimated at 5.9%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A drop-off in growth of automobile loans held back the
expansion of consumer credit, a statistic that includes all
consumer borrowing except mortgages. Car loans expanded $889
million, a 3.7% annual rate, after spurting $2.02 billion in
January, an 8.4% annual rate. Nevertheless, February's growth
in car financing is an improvement from late last year when
debt from auto loans was declining.</p>
<p>Revolving credit, largely bank card and retail borrowing,
showed weak expansion for the second consecutive month.
Borrowing in this category grew $485 million, for a 2.9%
annual rate of increase, after inching forward at a 1.8%
annual rate in January.</p>
<p>At the end of February, consumer installment debt totaled
$718.67 billion, up 5.3% from a year earlier.</p>
