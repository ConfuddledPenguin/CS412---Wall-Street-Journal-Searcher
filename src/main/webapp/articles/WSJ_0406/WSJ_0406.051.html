	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Allen Karp, president and chief operating
officer of Cineplex Odeon Corp., said the company expects to
end the year with positive cash flow, "significantly" lower
debt levels and higher revenue.
   But he said shareholders "ought not to look for" profits
until 1991 or 1992, after the company's restructuring is
completed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Karp succeeded Cineplex's founder and former chairman,
Garth Drabinsky, in December after Mr. Drabinsky quit the
company after his failure to launch a takeover bid for the
Toronto-based theater-distribution chain.</p>
<p>Mr. Karp's current task is to reduce, through asset sales
and other measures, the debt built up by Mr. Drabinsky during
an aggressive expansion in the late 1980s, and return the
company to profitability.</p>
<p>He said that in the first quarter the company saw a nearly
20% increase in revenue from box office admissions and
concessions from a year earlier.</p>
<p>"Our {operating} revenues are outstripping both 1989
figures and our budgets," Mr. Karp said. "This will trickle
down to the bottom line."</p>
<p>Improved relations with major film studios also means
Cineplex won't be shut out of distributing high-grossing
films this year, as happened in 1988 and 1989, he added.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Karp said he expects to see positive cash
flow by the end of the year, he declined to quantify it,
saying it would be affected by what assets are sold, and when
the sales are concluded.</p>
<p>Cineplex already has "very attractive offers" for some of
its theater chains, Mr. Karp said, and is negotiating the
possible sale of, among others, theaters in Virgina, Oregon
and Washington state.</p>
<p>He said he expects Cineplex to receive around seven or
eight times cash flow for the properties. Most analysts say
eight times cash flow is the maximum any buyer is willing to
pay in the current buyer's market.</p>
<p>Cineplex may report losses on the sale of some of the
chains, but Mr. Karp said he expects "some very large gains
on other sales" to result in a net benefit to the company.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Cineplex closed at $5.50, up 50 cents.</p>
<p>Asset sales will help to cut Cineplex's debt, which
reached a high of $620 million in the first quarter, to
between $400 and $500 million by year end, he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Karp said the company is eyeing a number of ways to
refinance its debt load, including the possible sale and
leaseback of some of its theaters. Other options under study
include a joint venture partnership with another company, or
stand-alone financing arrangements for some of the individual
theater chains. He didn't identify any potential partners.</p>
<p>The key to returning the company to profitability, Mr.
Karp said, is keeping a tight rein on capital spending and
other expenses. Cineplex's capital spending budget will be
limited to $12 million in 1990, he said, although under
agreements with its bankers the company is able to spend up
to $17.5 million refurbishing and building new theaters this
year.</p>
<p>He said general and administrative expenses are expected
to drop from $35 million in 1989 to less than $22 million
this year.</p>
<p>Mr. Karp said that in 1991 "we will be reaping the
benefits" of the restructuring efforts and begin showing
profits again.</p>
