	<p class="article-leader">For Credit-Card Issuers,
   Small Business Adds Up</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>CREDIT-CARD companies are issuing more cards to
small-business clients and offering them more services.
That's good news for small companies, which have watched
banks tighten credit for small-business borrowers.</p>
<p>MasterCard International and American Express Co., for
example, are stepping up already vigorous marketing programs
for cards aimed at small and mid-sized companies. And banks
in local markets, such as Chemical Bank in New York, are
heavily promoting their own small-business credit-card
packages.</p>
<p>The battle for new card holders includes slick direct-mail
offers and sponsorship of small-business seminars. American
Express has a small-business magazine in the works for
cardholders.</p>
<p>The strategy is paying off. MasterCard's small-business
client base, already 60% of its one million BusinessCard
holders, grew by roughly 50% last year. American Express says
it has more than doubled its small-business customer roll
since 1985 to more than one million.</p>
<p>"This is a high-growth area for the company, without
question," says Barbara Barsa, vice president for
small-business services at American Express. "We are starting
to market a lot more aggressively now."</p>
<p>For instance, American Express will extend a card member's
payment period for purchases of certain office equipment such
as fax machines and personal computers. It also offers
insurance plans and a slew of discounts on items such as
hotel rooms and auto leasing.</p>
<p>MasterCard offers insurance plans to holders of its
BusinessCard and a rolling monthly balance, helpful for
high-growth companies with limited cash flow. Credit lines
are around $5,000 a month. MasterCard also offers a toll-free
number for road service, targeted at small companies without
fleet service contracts.</p>
<p>Top Franchise Sellers</p>
<p>Reaping Big Rewards</p>
<p>IN SHORT SUPPLY, specialists in selling franchises command
top dollar.</p>
<p>"People who can effectively sell franchises are few and
far between," says Larry C. Jordan, president of Las Vegas
Discount Golf & Tennis Inc., a Nevada-based franchiser of
sporting goods stores. Mr. Jordan has doubled the commission
rate paid to sales agents, to 10% from 5% two years ago, and
says he still has three sales jobs open.</p>
<p>Demand for experienced franchise salespeople appears to
have outstripped the supply. Also, many franchises are
growing rapidly, and top sales executives are reaping the
rewards in the form of higher compensation.</p>
<p>"The competition is getting keener, and there aren't
enough experienced people out there," says Jerry Wilkerson,
president of Franchise Recruiters Ltd., a Crete, Ill.,
recruiting firm.</p>
<p>To keep their top sales performers from bolting,
franchisers are offering guaranteed compensation and, in some
cases, handsome bonuses, instead of traditional straight
commissions. Mr. Wilkerson says pay guarantees for recruited
franchising sales executives are about 10% higher than a year
ago and probably will rise another 15% this year to nearly
$100,000, on average.</p>
<p>In Japan, Conveniences</p>
<p>Converge at 7-Eleven</p>
<p>COMBINING catalog sales with convenience stores is one
American company's strategy for success in Japan.</p>
<p>New York-based Shop America Ltd. plans to give Japanese
consumers an alternative to the cumbersome, multi-layered
distribution system with seemingly endless middlemen that
inflates retail prices there. It's a members-only catalog
shopping network, dealing mostly in U.S.-made products, to be
run out of 3,940 7-Eleven outlets in Japan.</p>
<p>Consumers pay $20 to join Shop America and place catalog
orders at their local 7-Eleven store, paying in yen. Orders
will be filled by air freight from Shop America's
distribution center in New Jersey within five to 12 days.
Sales are scheduled to begin in July.</p>
<p>Even with long-distance shipping costs, Shop America's
president, Victor Fraenkel, thinks he can undercut the prices
of Japanese products on their own turf with such U.S.-made
items as audio cassettes, compact disks, golf and tennis
balls and cigarette lighters.</p>
<p>"If I can reach Japanese consumers on a direct basis, I
can provide them with roughly the same pricing that exists in
America," Mr. Fraenkel says.</p>
<p>Shop America's strategy is also a play on the soaring
popularity of convenience stores with young Japanese
consumers, who use them for a range of services beyond
shopping, such as paying utility bills and life insurance
premiums.</p>
<p>Seven-Eleven Japan Co. is the largest overseas licensee of
Southland Corp. of Dallas. With sales of $5.4 billion last
year, it also is Japan's largest convenience store chain and
owns 50% of Shop America. Southland just agreed to sell a 75%
stake to 7-Eleven and its parent, Ito-Yokado Group, for $400
million.</p>
<p>A 7-Eleven rival, Tokyo-based FamilyMart Co., is
test-marketing catalog sales at its convenience outlets in
Japan.</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>CONNECTICUT has a legislative commission that is proposing
that employers with fewer than 25 workers be allowed to offer
a "no frills" package of medical benefits instead of the more
costly, broad-based health insurance now required by the
state. . . . SBA Administrator Susan Engeleiter says 98% of
the 520,000 new corporations formed in the first nine months
of 1989 were small businesses.</p>
