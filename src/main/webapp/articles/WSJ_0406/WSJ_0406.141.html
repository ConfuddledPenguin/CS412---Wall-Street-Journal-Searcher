	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stocks finished mixed as worries about
first-quarter corporate-earnings reports offset relief that
the Tokyo stock market hadn't plunged overnight.
   Consumer stocks that were considered largely insulated
from earnings disappointments attracted buyers yesterday,
just as they did earlier this week. Bank issues met with
across-the-board selling in response to indications that
federal regulatory reviews may put continued pressure on
their results.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In addition, shares of Tandem Computers and several other
companies whose estimates for the just-completed quarter
failed to satisfy market expectations were hit with heavy
selling and fell sharply.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.80 to 2721.17 with
the help of gains among blue-chip consumer issues such as
Philip Morris, which rose 3/4 to 41 1/4, and Merck, which
advanced 7/8 to 72 1/8.</p>
<p>Broader market measures ended the session with slight
losses. Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index dropped 0.36 to
340.73 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index slid
0.16 to 187.15.</p>
<p>Losers led gainers by about 744 to 703 on the Big Board,
where trading activity continued at the moderate pace set
earlier this week. Big Board volume totaled 144,170,000
shares.</p>
<p>Prices moved higher at the opening in response to the
Tokyo market's performance, which went against speculation
Wednesday among U.S. market participants that Japanese share
prices would fall sharply. The Nikkei index of 225 Japanese
stocks finished with a loss of just 193.88, or 0.7%, at
28249.06.</p>
<p>But the gains proved short-lived, and the market drifted
through the rest of the session amid periodic rounds of
futures-related buying and selling as the focus shifted to
earnings.</p>
<p>"The market is more vulnerable to earnings disappointments
today than at any time in recent history," because
price-earnings ratios for stocks have been on the rise, said
Carmine Grigoli, chief equity portfolio strategist at First
Boston.</p>
<p>Mr. Grigoli said he expects first-quarter earnings for the
companies included in the S&P 500 to be down 12% to 15%
overall from the year-ago period -- a drop for which he says
the market isn't prepared. In recent weeks, those issues have
traded at an average of about 15 times their earnings over
the past 12 months.</p>
<p>With prices near the upper boundary of their trading range
during the past several months, "We're due for some sort of
setback, and I think earnings are going to be the catalyst,"
he said.</p>
<p>The sell-off in bank stocks came after analysts met
Wednesday with representatives of the Comptroller of the
Currency, who indicated that banks are facing a tough,
sweeping review of their real-estate lending practices and
that the same standards will be used in reviewing their
portfolios of consumer loans and loans to highly-levleraged
comanies.</p>
<p>Two major commercial banks issues were among the most
active stocks on the Big Board: Citicorp, which dipped 1/4 to
22 1/2 on composite volume of 2.1 million shares, and
BankAmerica, which dropped 1 1/4 to 26 3/8 on 1.2 million
shares.</p>
<p>Also, Chase Manhattan fell 5/8 to 27 7/8, Bankers Trust
New York declined 1 3/4 to 36 5/8, First Chicago declined 1
to 29 and J.P. Morgan eased 1/2 to 35.</p>
<p>Prudential-Bache lowered its investment ratings to "sell"
from "hold" on Chase and two regional bank stocks: PNC
Financial, which skidded 2 1/4 to 37 7/8, and Bank of New
York, which retreated 2 1/2 to 31 1/4. Among other regionals,
Security Pacific dropped 1 1/4 to 35 5/8, Wells Fargo lost 1
5/8 to 68 3/4, NCNB fell 1 5/8 to 36 1/8, Citizens & Southern
fell 1 1/4 to 25 1/4, and Bank of Boston declined 1 1/8 to 12
3/4.</p>
<p>Bank of New England fell 3/8 to 3 7/8 on 1.2 million
shares. Shares of the troubled regional bank holding company
had declined 3/8 Wednesday following its acknowledgment that
it faces further increases in nonperforming assets and
loan-loss provisions.</p>
<p>Tandem, the Big Board's most active issue, plunged 4 5/8
to 22 5/8 on 4.8 million shares. The company said it expects
to report that net income for the second quarter, ended March
31, was lower than expectations.</p>
<p>Other stocks hit with earnings-related selling included:</p>
<p>-- Ogden, which plunged 3 1/8 to 24 3/8. The company told
analysts its first-quarter earnings, excluding a gain
resulting from a sale of stock by its Ogden Projects unit,
would be lower than the year-ago level. In response, Kidder
Peabody and Dillon Read both lowered their 1990 earnings
estimates.</p>
<p>-- Businessland, which slid 1 1/2 to 8 7/8 after lowering
its earnings estimate for the March quarter. The company said
it now expects to report break-even operating results for the
period on revenue of about $320 million.</p>
<p>-- WorldCorp, which fell 7/8 to 8 3/4 on news of a
fourth-quarter loss, compared with a profit a year ago. The
company said it also expects to report a first-quarter loss
as well and doesn't anticipate meeting its target of $21
million in net income for the full year.</p>
<p>Baxter International, which announced a planned
restructuring Wednesday, dropped 1 1/2 to 22 7/8 on 4.5
million shares after a meeting with analysts proved
disappointing. Both Kidder Peabody and Prudential-Bache
lowered investment ratings on the stock following the
meeting.</p>
<p>Amax advanced 5/8 to 28 on two million shares amid
continuing speculation the company could become a takeover
target.</p>
<p>Peter Kiewit Sons', a private firm, has been identified as
a possible bidder.</p>
<p>McDermott International climbed 2 to 28 1/8 after
receiving a $250 million contract for 15 offshore sulfur
mining platforms. Also, traders said there was speculation
that Schlumberger may be interested in acquiring the company;
however, McDermott said it hadn't been approached by any
suitors. Schlumberger declined comment.</p>
<p>Rollins Environmental Services gained 5/8 to 13 3/8 on 1.3
million shares. Smith Barney, Harris Upham put the company on
its research list with a "buy" recommendation, citing
promising growth in the market for incinerators.</p>
<p>L.E. Myers Group, which rose 5/8 Wednesday, gained another
1 1/4 to 14 1/2. Analysts attributed the stock's rally to the
Senate's passage of a clean-air bill earlier this week; the
company provides construction services for electric
utilities, among the targets of the measure.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 0.11
to 361.23. Volume on the exchange totaled 15,830,000 shares.
There were 262 issues advancing and 278 declining.</p>
<p>Salomon's newly issued call warrants on the Nikkei index
topped the exchange's list of most active issues. The
warrants, which become more valuable as the index moves
higher, rose 5/8 to 3 3/4 in response to the Tokyo market's
showing overnight; more than 3.3 million changed hands in
composite trading.</p>
<p>International Telecharge, whose board decided against
pursuing a takeover offer from a suitor, who wasn't
identified, rose 1/8 to 3 1/8. The company also signed a
service agreement with MCI Communications and named Allan L.
Rayfield, a former GTE executive, as chairman and chief
executive officer.</p>
