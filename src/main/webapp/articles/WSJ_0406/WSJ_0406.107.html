	<p class="article-leader">PHILADELPHIA -- Thomas P. Gerrity, president of Computer
Sciences Corp.'s rapidly growing commercial consulting
division, was named dean of the University of Pennsylvania's
Wharton School.
   Mr. Gerrity, 48 years old, is expected to guide the
redesigning of the business school's curriculum, while
continuing the international emphasis on research and
teaching that began under his predecessor, Russell E. Palmer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Palmer, 55, who has been the dean for seven years,
said this past summer that he plans to step down June 30. He
will pursue some entrepreneurial ventures.</p>
<p>Mr. Gerrity brings extensive academic and corporate
experience to the assignment. As head of CSC Consulting
Corp., he has been leading the computer-services firm's
efforts to expand into commercial computer-systems
integration in the U.S. and Europe, decreasing the firm's
dependence on federal government contracts.</p>
<p>For four years, Mr. Gerrity taught at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management, where
he founded Index Group, a consulting firm that specializes in
counseling executives on strategic management of changing
information technology. In the early 1970s, he left Sloan to
become a full-time consultant. Index Group is now part of CSC
Consulting.</p>
<p>At Wharton, Mr. Gerrity is expected to infuse both the
curriculum and the research programs with more emphasis on
practical business techniques and problems. Although the
school is already considered to be among the best in the
U.S., faculty members say students still need better
preparation for confronting international markets and
competitors.</p>
<p>Wharton "needs to work continually to see that
globalization is reflected throughout the curriculum," Mr.
Gerrity said in an interview. "There are no more purely
domestic arenas."</p>
<p>Another challenge facing the new dean is the
reorganization of Wharton's core courses, said Anita Summers,
a professor of public policy and a member of the search
committee that selected Mr. Gerrity. She said the school
needs to evaluate whether it is "slicing the subjects
correctly."</p>
<p>In addition to creating more cooperation among Wharton's
segmented departments, Wharton's current dean, Mr. Palmer, is
credited with almost quadrupling Wharton's endowment, to more
than $100 million at current market prices from $27 million
in 1983. "He was able to convince a lot of people that this
was a good place to invest their money -- in human capital,"
Ms. Summers said.</p>
<p>Mr. Gerrity is expected to continue the fund raising, said
Edward Bowman, the deputy dean who led the search. "But he
brings more than that," Mr. Bowman said.</p>
<p>Computer Sciences, El Segundo, Calif., said Chairman
William R. Hoover will assume Mr. Gerrity's responsibilities
until a successor is named. "We regret losing an executive of
Tom's caliber," Mr. Hoover said. "At the same time, we are
proud that Tom has been chosen to lead one of the world's
truly outstanding business schools."</p>
