   The rate was down from 9.7% in February 1989. On an
unadjusted basis, average EC unemployment was 8.9% in
February, also unchanged from January. The rate was down from
10.1% in February 1989.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Eurostat said that during the past three years, the EC
unemployment rate as a whole has fallen by a constant 0.7
percentage point a year, from 10.6% in February 1987.
Unemployment has thus fallen by about 20% during the past 36
months, Eurostat said.</p>
<p>Unemployment fell during that period in all member states,
with the exception of Italy and Denmark, Eurostat said.</p>
<p>Adjusted unemployment in February was highest in Ireland,
