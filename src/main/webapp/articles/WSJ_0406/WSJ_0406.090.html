	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Orbital Sciences Corp. successfully launched
its first Pegasus rocket off the California coast. Now it
must launch a profitable business.
   Pegasus, the first U.S.-developed launch vehicle since the
space shuttle, is designed to carry small satellites into
space. The crewless rocket, outfitted with a distinctive
triangular wing, is launched from a B-52 bomber to eliminate
the need for a costly ground booster.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yesterday, at 12:10 PDT, the rocket worked just as its
youthful inventors hoped it would. The B-52 dropped the
Pegasus booster over the Pacific Ocean; it fell for five
heart-stopping seconds; then it ignited. A camera in a jet
trailing the B-52 televised the rocket's fiery ascent into
space. "I got my view of Pegasus really climbing fast," said
the B-52 pilot, Gordon Fullerton. "It looked like a shuttle
heading for the sky."</p>
<p>The launch's success was a big boost for privately held
Orbital Sciences Corp., which developed the rocket, and for
space entrepreneurship generally. Most immediately, it clears
the way for Orbital Sciences to complete its initial public
stock offering and raise a much-needed $16.3 million, before
underwriting fees. The offering was postponed last week after
a Wall Street Journal article appeared describing the risk of
the launch.</p>
<p>Even more important, the launch enhances the credibility
of the Fairfax, Va., company, which had been promoting
Pegasus for several years but had run into a host of
technical problems in building the rocket. "The first launch
represents the ultimate proof of concept -- of design,
analysis and testing," said Orbital Sciences Chairman David
Thompson. "It's a very important milestone."</p>
<p>The launch also was a milestone for aerospace technology.
No winged vehicle ever accelerated to eight times the speed
of sound, as Pegasus did. The computer models that Orbital
Sciences used to make the rocket will now be utilized by the
National Aerospace and Space Administration to design its
proposed X-30 jet, which would take off from an airport and
vault into space.</p>
<p>The Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Agency bought the
first three Pegasus rockets and ran yesterday's launch,
indicating the military's keen interest in Pegasus.
Air-launched rockets can be used to put up small
reconnaissance and communications satellites quickly over
out-of-the way trouble spots. Indeed, one of the two small
objects Pegasus put into orbit yesterday was a Navy
communications satellite that could be useful for spies.</p>
<p>"Pegasus offers a capability we haven't had before," said
Jerry Grey, vice president of technology for the American
Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. "You can launch
from anywhere into any orbit."</p>
<p>But Orbital Sciences may have a tough time exploiting that
advantage because of competition and price pressures. NASA
plans to choose a company later this year to build that
agency a small launcher of its own and may be hesitant to use
a Pegasus-based vehicle for fear of relying too much on a
single launcher. Meanwhile, commercial customers demand low
prices, but the cost of Pegasus may be going up.</p>
<p>Orbital Sciences charges the Pentagon research agency
about $6.5 million for each Pegasus -- about half the going
rate for small launchers. But Orbital Sciences has said it
will raise that price to about $8 million to launch
commercial satellites, and may have to raise it even more
once it starts renting its own plane instead of using the
NASA B-52.</p>
<p>The rocket company also will be under pressure to raise
prices to boost profit. So far, the company has had losses of
about $46.5 million since its founding in 1982. In the nine
months ended last Sept. 30, the latest period for which it
has filed financial data, Orbital Sciences had a loss of $5.4
million on revenue of $56.8 million.</p>
