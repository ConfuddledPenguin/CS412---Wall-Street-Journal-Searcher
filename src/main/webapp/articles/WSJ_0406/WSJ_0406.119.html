	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- It was a poignant scene: Robert W. Kearns, an
unknown and nearly broken man, had stepped before the judge
to explain, in a figurative way, why he was suing the world's
biggest car companies.
   "I'm wearing a little badge here, and that badge says I am
an inventor," he said at the court hearing in 1980. "Maybe
you can't see the badge. I don't think anybody is going to be
able to see the badge until my trial is finished."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>What's more, Mr. Kearns insisted, he is an inventor of
substance, not some eccentric tinkerer with a wild story
about a big company stealing his creation and, with it,
millions of dollars in royalties. It was he who designed the
first practical, electronic intermittent windshield wiper --
the popular stop-and-go system now found on millions of cars.
And it was Ford Motor Co. and others, he claimed, who pirated
the invention.</p>
<p>Mr. Kearns's lawsuits would drag on for years, and show
how consuming this sort of pursuit of vindication can be. In
the course of battle, he suffered an emotional breakdown. He
was dropped by three law firms. He sparred with judges. And
he relied heavily on his son Dennis, who, on one occasion,
proposed intimidating Ford lawyers with a .45-caliber pistol,
and, on another, had an affair with a paralegal in an
opposition camp -- and came away with a fistful of
incriminating documents. "I don't think there's been a patent
case like this one before," grumbles the judge presiding over
the suits.</p>
<p>Intent in his cause, Mr. Kearns, now 62 years old, waged
an extraordinary and solitary crusade. Then, on Jan. 29, a
jury returned an equally extraordinary decision.</p>
<p>Given to rumpled clothing, his hair white and wispy, Mr.
Kearns looks the part of the eccentric inventor. He once
dreamed of getting rich in Detroit supplying his wiper to the
world's auto makers, but he ended up with a much more obscure
career: studying the skid resistance of highway surfaces for
the U.S. government. Even after abandoning Detroit for
Maryland, he still considered himself the righteous David in
a world of Goliaths. So he sued them all: Ford, General
Motors Corp., Chrysler Corp., Daimler-Benz AG, Porsche AG,
Toyota Motor Corp. and 18 other auto makers.</p>
<p>The federal district judge overseeing the Ford case, Avern
Cohn, has imposed a gag order on participants in the trial,
so Mr. Kearns, his family, his lawyers and Ford have refused
comment for this article. Nonetheless, the story of Robert
Kearns and his invention is amply told in stacks of
depositions and motions that fill more than a half-dozen
boxes in Detroit's federal courthouse.</p>
<p>It begins in 1962, when Robert Kearns was 35 years old and
simultaneously a professor at Wayne State University in
Detroit and a Ph.D. candidate in engineering at Case Western
Reserve University in Cleveland. At the time, Mr. Kearns was
trying to devise a project for his doctoral dissertation. "I
had chosen a rather elaborate topic that the professor
thought would cost me $30,000," he said in his court
testimony. "I began to think of something that might be of
lower cost."</p>
<p>What followed was the kind of inspiration that separates
inventors from ordinary people. Mr. Kearns had been virtually
blind in his left eye since a flying champagne cork hit him
in the face on his wedding night. That injury, he says, made
him think about how his eyes worked, and specifically, how
his eyes were periodically cleaned when he blinked. This
observation sparked an idea: Why not develop windshield
wipers that would "blink" too. That way, during light rain,
the wipers would just occasionally clear the windshield.</p>
<p>Mr. Kearns began to tinker. He was familiar with
transistors, thanks to a four-year stint in the military
research labs of Bendix Corp. He had a test car: The Kearns
family 1962 Ford Galaxy convertible. And he had access to a
cheap supply of windshield wiper motors, courtesy of his
brother, Martin, who had a low-level job in Ford's research
labs.</p>
<p>By October 1963, Robert Kearns had produced a working
prototype of his "blinking" wiper. The key elements were a
collection of circuits hidden inside a red metal box mounted
on his 1962 Ford. The device was far from perfect. When it
got hot, for instance, the wipers would suddenly switch on by
themselves -- rain or no rain. Nonetheless, on Oct. 22, 1963,
Mr. Kearns drove out to meet with two Ford engineers to see
if they were interested.</p>
<p>They were. And that began a six-year waltz between Mr.
Kearns and Ford. Ford engineers had been trying to develop an
intermittent wiper of their own. But their devices relied on
a variety of mechanical systems -- plungers, springs and
diaphragms. Mr. Kearns's system was more advanced and
reliable because it was controlled electronically.</p>
<p>Mr. Kearns quickly fixed the problem that caused his
wipers to jump into action in hot weather. During the next
year, he tested the system's durability by running the wipers
for six months in a fish tank filled with oil and sawdust.
Then he took out the first of several patents.</p>
<p>But his dreams of ascending into the affluent ranks of
Detroit's auto-parts suppliers soon came a cropper. Between
1966 and 1969, Mr. Kearns worked with Ford, passing along
details about his wiper in return for encouraging words, but
little else. Ford officials even gave him an award: A
specially mounted, two-speed wiper motor. But they didn't
give him a contract.</p>
<p>Instead, according to Ford documents and testimony at the
trial, Ford engineers were busy dissecting the Kearns wiper.
Then, in 1969, the auto maker introduced an electronically
controlled, intermittent wiper system that incorporated many
of Mr. Kearns's ideas -- something a Ford official
acknowledged under cross examination during the trial.</p>
<p>Mr. Kearns was stunned. Ford, however, insisted the system
was Ford's own, and that Mr. Kearns's patents were based on
common knowledge, and therefore not valid. For the next eight
years, Mr. Kearns and his lawyers traded letters with Ford
and its lawyers. Meanwhile, Mr. Kearns began what his lawyers
describe as a spiral into emotional collapse.</p>
<p>By 1971, Mr. Kearns had moved to Gaithersburg, Md., and
had gone to work for what was then the National Bureau of
Standards. From this obscure post, Mr. Kearns, aided by his
son Dennis, continued his fight with Ford. The younger Mr.
Kearns, then in his 20s, was launching a career as a private
investigator by helping his father get dirt on auto makers.</p>
<p>Dennis Kearns says that, in July 1976, he bought a control
box for a Mercedes Benz intermittent wiper system from an
auto dealer and obtained the wiring diagram that went with
it. Robert Kearns, worried that his invention was being
pirated by Daimler-Benz, too, began composing his own diagram
of the Mercedes system to see if it matched his patents. In
the midst of this effort, he suffered his emotional collapse.
"He never finished the drawing," Dennis Kearns says today.</p>
<p>According to court documents filed by his lawyers, Mr.
Kearns had experienced an "emotional breakdown . . . so
severe that it caused {him} to run away from home and wander
aimlessly through three states." He wound up in a hospital.</p>
<p>Since then, Mr. Kearns has often portrayed himself as a
man clinging to sanity after years of battling his giant
adversaries. "My psychiatrist advises me there is always the
possibility that I could go over the brink," he once told the
court. "And if I go over the second time, it might be
permanent."</p>
<p>By January 1978, Mr. Kearns had recovered sufficiently to
start filing suits, starting with Ford. By 1985 he had sued
virtually every major auto maker, accusing them of stealing
his ideas. (He also tried manufacturing his wiper in Ireland,
but never found financing for the venture.)</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the federal court boggled at the sheer
volume of the litigation and its complexity. Mr. Kearns's
testy relations with the three law firms that ultimately
dropped him didn't help speed things along. Firm No. 1 --
Harness, Dickey & Pierce of Birmingham, Mich. -- quit in
1979, less than a year after filing Mr. Kearns's first suit.
In a motion asking the court to let them leave the case,
Harness lawyers said Mr. Kearns berated them with "constant
verbal reprimands." The lawyers also weren't too happy about
Dennis Kearns's packing a heater.</p>
<p>Harness said in its motion that Dennis Kearns drew the .45
and declared he wanted to leave it "exposed" during a meeting
with Ford lawyers so they "would be impressed with his
seriousness." Harness said it told Mr. Kearns, before Ford's
lawyers arrived, "to take the weapon out to his car . . . and
never bring it to our office again."</p>
<p>Harness's successor, Washington patent lawyer Richard L.
Aitken, lasted less than two years. He got out in December
1980 after complaining to the court about Mr. Kearns's
demands. Mr. Kearns, according to his lawyers' testimony,
would sometimes refuse to let his own attorneys see his
records, fight even routine requests by the defense for
information, and turn down settlement offers. When
Daimler-Benz AG and Porsche AG offered to pay $150,000 each
to settle his suits against them, Mr. Kearns said no. "I was
not interested in any money settlement," he said in a 1980
hearing. "What I am looking for is a purchase order" -- an
agreement to supply the wipers.</p>
<p>Mr. Aitken was unimpressed, particularly since Mr. Kearns
already owed his firm $25,000 in fees. He also was tired of
the hail of motions and counter-motions that delayed the
case. So he quit.</p>
<p>Chicago litigators Keith V. Rockey and Thomas C. Elliott
of McDougall, Hersh & Scott signed on next, and lasted nearly
six years. They would later label their client
"recalcitrant." But it was Dennis Kearns's amorous exploits
that made them bolt for the exit.</p>
<p>Dennis Kearns is the oldest of six children, and, unlike
his father, is a natty dresser given to stylish suits, French
cuffs and a large gold ring on his right hand. His private
detective agency, Phoenix Group International Inc., occupies
a suite of small offices in the tony Detroit suburb of
Birmingham. Two samurai swords rest on a black wood stand
behind his desk.</p>
<p>The younger Mr. Kearns has said he is innocent of any
wrongdoing in his relationship with the paralegal. In 1985,
he told the court that he met the woman, Laurie J.
Fitzpatrick, at a paralegal seminar in Washington, D.C. He
says Ms. Fitzpatrick, who worked for an opposition law firm,
offered him the documents, which included records of Porsche
internal meetings discussing the Kearns wiper.</p>
<p>Ms. Fitzpatrick, however, offered a different story. In a
1985 deposition, she said Dennis Kearns met her at the
seminar and asked her out for a drink. That began their
eight-month relationship. One day, she said, he called her at
work to say her employers had agreed to provide him with
certain documents. He then gave her a sketchy description of
the papers, and added: "I want to see you tonight, you can
give them to me then."</p>
<p>"Like a dummy, it didn't occur to me to check this out,"
she said. They met at her apartment, where she handed over
copies of the documents. Then they went to a restaurant, and
Mr. Kearns broke off the affair. (Ms. Fitzpatrick couldn't be
located for comment, and her former law firm has since
disbanded.)</p>
<p>Lawyers for Porsche discovered the leak when the papers
turned up in court filings. At the time, Judge Philip Pratt
was presiding over the case and, after reviewing the
controversy, he sided with Ms. Fitzpatrick. "Her testimony
was candid, even though at some points painful," he wrote in
his opinion. He ordered the elder Mr. Kearns to pay nearly
$134,000 in penalties as punishment for his son's
"outrageous" conduct. (Dennis Kearns, who provided comment
for this article on this issue alone, says he may appeal the
decision.)</p>
<p>The flap, and the subsequent death of Judge Pratt, helped
delay a trial of the lawsuits for several more years. The
cases got moving again when Judge Cohn took over in early
1989 and decided to try the suit against Ford first. Finally,
in January, the case went to trial.</p>
<p>By this point, Mr. Kearns was on his fourth set of
lawyers, William Durkee and Paul M. Janicke of the Houston
firm Arnold, White & Durkee. Their refrain sounds a bit
familiar: "Sometimes, it's hard for me to get things across"
to Mr. Kearns, one Arnold White attorney said in court.</p>
<p>The trial lasted three weeks and, on Jan. 29, the six
jurors returned with their verdict. It had taken Mr. Kearns
fully 12 years of wrangling in court to get to this stage. By
his own account, the effort had left him financially ravaged.
"My kids are commuting 35 miles {to college}, they're driving
on bald tires," Mr. Kearns lamented at one point. "That is
the sort of price I'm paying to be here."</p>
<p>But the resilience ultimately won him his vindication. The
jury declared Mr. Kearns in the right, and said Ford stole
his idea for the wiper.</p>
<p>Ford's potential exposure is huge. Internal Ford studies
ordered into evidence indicate the auto maker has sold more
than 16 million cars with intermittent wiper systems. The
systems currently sell for about $20 each -- of which as much
as half is gross profit to Ford, according to calculations by
Mr. Kearns's attorneys.</p>
<p>Ford's best hope in avoiding a whopping judgment, assuming
there isn't an out-of-court settlement, now appears to be
Judge Cohn. Already, the judge has ruled that, based on
precedent, Mr. Kearns's award can't be a share of Ford's
profits from intermittent wiper sales. And earlier this
month, he said, "If the jury came back with a judgment of
$500 million, I'd be constrained to set it aside as shocking
to judicial conscience." The jury is expected to begin
deliberating on an award this month, and Ford is expected to
appeal.</p>
<p>The fact that the case dragged on for 12 years may, in the
end, be to Mr. Kearns's advantage. When he filed his suit
against Ford in 1978, the climate in the federal courts was
hostile to patent holders, experts say. But by the time the
Kearns case came to trial, this attitude had shifted: More
infringement cases were being decided in favor of patent
holders. And, the appeals court was letting more of those
decisions stand.</p>
<p>What is more, the appellate court has effectively removed
many of the limits that constrained damage awards in the
1960s and 1970s. Now, "the damages are out of sight," says
Harold C. Wegner, a Washington patent lawyer.</p>
<p>In January, for instance, a Chicago federal-court jury
ordered toy maker Mattel Inc. to pay Jerome H. Lemelson $24.8
million, plus interest estimated at an additional $46
million, for violating his patent on flexible plastic toy
tracks. Mattel, which is appealing the judgment, sold the
tracks for its Hot Wheels toy cars.</p>
<p>At the very least, the Ford decision will give Mr. Kearns
big leverage in his pending cases against other auto makers,
leverage that could win him rich settlements. After all, he
was found to have valid patents, which Ford violated. The
jury agreed with Mr. Kearns's defiant declaration: His badge
does read, Inventor.</p>
