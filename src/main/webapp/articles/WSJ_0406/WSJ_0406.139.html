	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Hitachi Ltd. is apparently declaring victory but
also scrambling to retreat in its semiconductor-patent
dispute with Motorola Inc.
   By all accounts, Motorola was the big loser in a U.S.
federal court ruling handed down last week. But Hitachi is
now the one seeking a settlement. And Motorola is so far
holding out and apparently considering an appeal.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A Texas judge last week declared that both companies
violated patents owned by each other, and ordered them to
stop U.S. sales of the chips in question. The ruling affected
Motorola's flagship microprocessor, the 68030.</p>
<p>Hitachi, meanwhile, was ordered to stop selling its H-8
microprocessor, which accounts for only about 1% of its
semiconductor revenue.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Lucius Bunton, at Motorola's request,
later stayed the order, allowing both companies to sell their
chips pending an appeal.</p>
<p>Industry officials say Hitachi may have gotten more than
it bargained for from the court fight. A protracted legal
battle could hurt Hitachi politically: The 68030 is crucial
for many companies, and a snag in its supply could stir up a
backlash against Hitachi.</p>
<p>But Hajime Yasuda, deputy general manager of Hitachi's
semiconductor design and development center, maintains that
Hitachi is eager to settle because it is concerned about
possible damage to its reputation as a reliable supplier.</p>
