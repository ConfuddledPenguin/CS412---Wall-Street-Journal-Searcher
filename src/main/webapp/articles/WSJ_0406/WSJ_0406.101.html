	<p class="article-leader">On Sunday Peruvians go to the polls to elect their new
president. The leading contender is novelist Mario Vargas
Llosa. A few months ago, Mr. Llosa was interviewed by his
friend, Chilean economist and essayist David Gallagher. The
interview took place at the Center of Public Studies in
Santiago and was published in the Center's publication
Estudios Publicos. Excerpts appear below:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Gallagher: Why do you think that, generally speaking,
writers and intellectuals have the tendency to oppose
free-market experiments and libertarian revolutions?</p>
<p>Mr. Vargas Llosa: Because unlike socialism, capitalism has
never generated a mystique; capitalism was never preceded by
a utopian vision.</p>
<p>Intellectuals and artists have a strength -- that comes
perhaps from the artist's condition itself -- which is the
condition of the dreamer; the man who wants to transcend the
limits of reality, to go further. Capitalism has nothing to
do with that. It has to do with reality. Capitalism is within
the limits of the human.</p>
<p>The poet and novelist want no part of this reality. They
want to transcend it. They want to substitute it. They want
to change it for a reality that comes out of their fantasies
-- out of their desires. Then, how can they accept
capitalism? It is very difficult; there is a resistance to
human mediocrity.</p>
<p>What the intellectual should do is at least tolerate
mediocrity, because mediocrity is what has brought us
progress. The utopian vision, on the other hand, which is so
beautiful in the abstract, has brought nothing but barbarity.
Utopias have never brought progress. After the establishment
of religious or revolutionary utopias there are multitudes of
cadavers, great amounts of tortured people, millions who are
purged and sent to concentration camps. We are living it now
in Iran: that materialization of the utopia in which a whole
country gets hooked, bringing thousands of deaths, and the
destruction of an economy that could be, perhaps, one of the
most prosperous in the world.</p>
<p>The intellectual in Latin America confronts a tragic
panorama of hunger, exploitation and terrible discrimination.
Therefore, there exists the totally false but deeply rooted
beliefs about what capitalism is. Of course, this vision is a
complete caricature. Thus, to defend a capitalist model means
to defend the existent model -- to defend the
"establishment."</p>
<p>The curious part is that in Latin America, reality has
became more socialist than capitalist. This is a socialism
that does not carry the name, but in practice that is what it
is. We have states that have been overbuilt; we have
interventionist practices; we have a multitude of economic
policy control systems. The confusion in the intellectual
world is that they have come to accept the idea that
capitalism is the "establishment," when it is exactly the
contrary. What our countries do not have is a genuine liberal
economy; a genuine capitalist economy with a free market,
free competition and nonintervention by the state.</p>
<p>It is not bad that intellectuals and artists will be
constant critics of the "establishment." I believe it is
legitimate that they defend the utopian vision. What is
dangerous is if this utopian vision turns into political
power.</p>
<p>Mr. Gallagher: If you become president, your term will
coincide with the fifth centenary of the discovery of
America. How are you going to celebrate this milestone?</p>
<p>Mr. Vargas Llosa: The anniversary is going to provoke a
lot of speeches around the Hispanic world -- endless ones.
But I am afraid that a good part of the celebration will
remain in the realm of rhetoric effusions. We may lose the
opportunity of celebrating in a creative fashion.</p>
<p>For instance, we should explore the battle against the
spirit of "nationalism" in Latin America, which still is
pending. All ideologies in Latin America -- whether on the
political right or left -- are, in some way or another,
involved in applauding this curse of nationalism. This is an
issue that is approached very prudently and very rarely in
Latin America.</p>
<p>But I believe this attachment to nationalism as an ideal
is a curse we will have to fight if we ever are to get out of
the stage of underdevelopment. Even if we become a bit more
developed, we will still be out of step with the rest of the
world if we do not become a part of the profound process of
integration taking place around the world. And I believe that
process is incompatible with the nationalist culture that is
rooted at all levels of our society.</p>
<p>Thus, the anniversary should remind us that our borders
are, in large part, fictitious, artificial things created by
bureaucrats who do not respond to the profound realities of
Latin America -- neither the past ones nor the present ones.
This fifth centenary should be used to help liberate us from
nationalism, to provoke a great continental mobilization to
the idea of integration, to dissolve the borders. But I am
afraid that because the celebrations will be directed by
governments -- I mean, through political power -- politicians
will take advantage of ceremonies to engage in exercises of
auto eulogy. So, I am afraid that nothing important is really
going to happen.</p>
<p>Mr. Gallagher: How is the writer in you -- one who is a
merciless critic of power -- going to coexist with the
political actor?</p>
<p>Mr. Vargas Llosa: Well, as cat and dog. It is a very
difficult coexistence between the writer and the politician.
Both are activities that intimately repel one another, there
is no doubt about that. The writer is a man who works in
solitude. He is entirely owner of his own acts, of everything
he does. This is very different from the politician who works
immersed in a mixture of people, who has to permanently
accept the politics of the minor evil, knowing that he can be
wrong about identifying the minor evil.</p>
<p>My distrust of power has not decreased. Now that I am
doing politics, I daily verify how all those low levels of
personality show up in endless ways in the political life,
because they have to do with power. And power brings out the
worst there is in human beings. So, that reconfirms my
distrust toward power, my conviction that power brings out
the worse.</p>
<p>I think that is why I have come to liberalism. If there is
a system of generalized distrust toward power, that is
liberalism. True liberalism believes that power is a danger
and that it has to be dispersed -- pulverized -- in society.
That is why I believe that the best defense the human race
has against that threat to the individual is to disperse
power within society in a way that no group, no party can
really subordinate others to their convenience or to their
will.</p>
<p>That is why, if I get to power, I want to fight so that
executive power is kept limited, restricted and decentralized
so that all Peruvians can start to participate in power. I do
not know if I will accomplish this, but the idea I have is at
least clear: The only way to fight exploitation,
discrimination, brutality -- something that is a part of the
Peruvian experience -- is by distributing power throughout
the society. The ones who have gone farthest in this are the
liberal thinkers, who have come to the defense of individuals
who confront the modern monster that is power.</p>
