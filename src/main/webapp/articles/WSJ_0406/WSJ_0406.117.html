	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- Westinghouse Electric Corp. said it agreed
to sell its soft-drink beverage business to a group led by
management of the unit. In addition, Westinghouse said it
will purchase a 15% stake in the new company. Terms weren't
disclosed.
   A Westinghouse spokesman said the company expects to
record a gain from the sale, which is expected to close in
the current quarter. However, the spokesman declined to be
more specific.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Financing will be provided by Citicorp Venture Capital
Ltd., a unit of Citibank; Hong Capital Investors Limited
Partnership, managed by Hong & Co., of Richmond, Va.; and
other institutional investors, Westinghouse said.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Westinghouse closed at $74.875, down 25 cents.</p>
<p>The divestiture of the beverage group, a leading bottler
of brands such as 7-Up and Royal Crown, had been expected.
Sale of the unit, which has estimated annual sales of about
$400 million, marks the last major divestiture expected to be
made during the tenure of John C. Marous, chairman and chief
executive officer. Mr. Marous will retire later this year,
and will be succeeded by Paul E. Lego, president and chief
operating officer.</p>
<p>The beverage group, based in Vernon, Calif., also bottles
and distributes A&W Root Beer, Sunkist Orange, Hawaiian Punch
and Seagram's Wine Coolers. It also distributes Perrier and
Evian bottled water, the company said.</p>
<p>Last year, Mr. Marous signaled that the beverage group was
on the block because it had been hurt by pricing competition
within the soft-drink industry.</p>
<p>In the past three years, Westinghouse has shed businesses
representing $2.64 billion in annual revenue while acquiring
more than 70 smaller businesses with revenue of about $1.5
billion.</p>
<p>Westinghouse has interests in broadcasting, defense
electronics, community development, financial services and
over-the-road refrigeration.</p>
