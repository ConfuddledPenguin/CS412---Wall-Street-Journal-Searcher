	<p class="article-leader">EAST PEORIA, Ill. -- Caterpillar Inc.'s tough battle to
remain the international leader in heavy machinery is being
waged here at plant KK, where yellow-helmeted workers are
ripping out antiquated machine tools and putting in dozens of
octopus-shaped robots. The work is part of a $2 billion
overhaul of Caterpillar's manufacturing operations.
   But across the Illinois River at Caterpillar's world
headquarters, executives fret that a force beyond their
control is undermining this efficiency drive: the weakening
Japanese yen. Over the past 16 months, the dollar has climbed
30% against the yen, making Japanese goods comparably less
expensive in the U.S. and third-country markets and giving
Caterpillar rivals such as Komatsu Ltd. a substantial
competitive edge.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Indeed, the difference in the exchange rates alone has
slashed Komatsu's costs by a greater percentage than the
reductions Caterpillar anticipates from its entire
modernization program.</p>
<p>"It gets tougher and tougher to compete," complains James
W. Wogsland, a Caterpillar executive vice president. "We're
concerned about the (dollar's) trend, and we don't see how
it's going to stop."</p>
<p>Caterpillar's factories obviously aren't the only ones
likely to be hurt. C. Fred Bergsten, who heads the Institute
for International Economics, a Washington consulting
organization, estimates that if the yen-dollar exchange rate
remains at its current level, U.S. exporters could lose $5
billion to $10 billion in business annually. In addition,
billions more could be lost as Americans buy more
Japanese-made goods.</p>
<p>"It's a matter of great concern when you work so hard to
see it wiped out by something you don't control," says G.
Mustafa Mohatarem, the director of trade and competitive
analysis at General Motors Corp., which also has invested
heavily to modernize its U.S. manufacturing.</p>
<p>Caterpillar, in seeking government help, faces a struggle.
So far, Japan has been carrying the load in trying to prop up
the yen, and the central bankers of other nations have, at
best, acted sporadically. In Washington, the Federal Reserve
Board and some in the Bush administration appear opposed to
any concerted moves; the problem in U.S. manufacturing is by
no means their only concern about currencies. At the Paris
meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized nations this
weekend, officials are expected to take little concrete
action on foreign-exchange rates. (With traders skittish over
the meeting, the dollar eased to 157.40 yen in New York late
yesterday from 158.95 Wednesday.)</p>
<p>Caterpillar's voice has become somewhat lonelier among
major U.S. companies. In the past 10 years, many American
corporations have built more overseas factories, increased
purchases of Japanese materials and components, and become
more sophisticated in using financial hedging instruments --
all moves that lessen the impact of a strengthening dollar.</p>
<p>And their overseas investments are growing. The Commerce
Department said yesterday that U.S. companies plan to
increase their overseas capital spending 13% this year, up
substantially from a 2% rise projected six months earlier. In
the wake of increases of 14% in 1989 and 24% in 1988, the
majority-owned foreign affiliates of U.S. companies now plan
to spend $54.9 billion this year. So, even though major
multinationals' U.S.-based manufacturing operations suffer
when the dollar rises, the companies can still look good in
their financial reports.</p>
<p>The result: There are fewer fired-up corporate advocates
for industrial America. The attitude among many companies
today is "Who cares where I make my money?" says Ben Fischer,
a former Steelworkers union official who directs the Center
for Labor Studies at Carnegie-Mellon University. "You do not
have sharp, black-and-white motivations in terms of what
happens in U.S. operations." Even Timothy L. Elder,
Caterpillar's chief lobbyist, concedes that "there aren't a
whole lot of folks getting concerned" about the declining
yen.</p>
<p>Motorola Inc. was once a staunch advocate of a stronger
yen, but Robert W. Galvin, chairman of its executive
committee, says the electronic-equipment maker is less
concerned about the issue today. In the past 10 years,
Motorola has sharply increased production overseas, building
plants in Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore. Today, Mr. Galvin
says, his bigger worries include such issues as building
products at low cost and opening Japan's markets.</p>
<p>Like many U.S. companies, Caterpillar has taken some steps
to protect itself from currency gyrations, but it also has
retained a singular commitment to succeeding as a
predominantly American manufacturer. More than two-thirds of
its 60,400 employees work in the U.S., where it has 17
production sites.</p>
<p>Caterpillar's executives express pride that it is second
only to Boeing Co. in the roster of U.S. exporters. Last year
alone, Caterpillar contributed $1.6 billion to the U.S.
balance of payments through exports of mammoth machines such
as its 103-ton, $950,000 bulldozer. Its familiar yellow
machines remain the market-share leaders throughout the
world. They are even popular in Japan, where they are widely
used in building golf courses.</p>
<p>In the mid-1980s, it was Caterpillar that led corporate
America's charge against the then-sky-high dollar, which was
much higher than it is now. Enlisting the aid of such potent
groups as the National Association of Manufacturers and the
Business Roundtable, Caterpillar Chairman Lee L. Morgan waged
a crusade on Capitol Hill and met more than a dozen times
with top administration officials, including President
Reagan. The lobbying helped lead to the landmark Plaza
Agreement in 1985, when industrialized nations agreed to try
to drive down the dollar.</p>
<p>Now, Caterpillar is again revving up its exchange-rate
activism. Its executives are warning any bureaucrat who will
listen that the dollar's rise against the yen damages
American competitiveness. "They are gearing up to make a
major point on the issue," says Jerry Jasinowski, the
president of the NAM, who has become a supporter of propping
up the yen. Caterpillar President Donald V. Fites has pressed
the case in visits to Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady.</p>
<p>Caterpillar's point of view does have some supporters,
including a number of major companies such GM and Chrysler
Corp. Says Robert N. Spolum, senior vice president at Clark
Equipment Co.: "I wouldn't want to see the dollar get a hell
of a lot stronger."</p>
<p>Caterpillar's lament can be illustrated at its
transmission factory here. Plant KK -- the company uses
letters to distinguish its factories -- is one of dozens of
Caterpillar operations being reworked from the ground up.</p>
<p>Following the company's success in driving down the dollar
in the 1980s, Caterpillar made an intense commitment to
improving its U.S. manufacturing. Rather than join the
stampede of American manufacturers that set up low-cost
operations in Mexico and around the Pacific Rim, Caterpillar
sought to make its domestic plants competitive on a world
scale. To do so, it launched its so-called Plant With a
Future program -- PWAF for short. The program called for
overhauling virtually all the company's U.S. factories,
installing fancy new robotics and streamlining assembly
systems.</p>
<p>Before the work started at KK in 1987, the plant's system
for making transmissions was "inflexible and cumbersome,"
says John Bennett, the plant's cigar-chomping manager. Today,
with new equipment, a lathe that once took eight hours to set
up can be rejiggered in nine minutes, saving both manpower
and the need to make parts in big, inventory-building
batches. Cat even raised the roof to make room for a
heat-treating complex that toughens gears and helps them
resist abrasion. Although the factory overhaul won't be
completed until 1993, the incidence of faulty transmissions
already has been sliced from 4% two years ago to less than
2%. KK's costs are expected to drop 19% eventually.</p>
<p>But Caterpillar officials worry that the slumping yen
threatens years of work at factories such as this one. "How
long do you think it takes a company to take 20% out of its
cost structure?" asks D.G. Paris, a company economist. (The
answer for Caterpillar's PWAF program: seven years.) In
recent months, Mr. Paris has frequently telephoned Federal
Reserve officials to make this point.</p>
<p>If Caterpillar hadn't undertaken its modernization
program, of course, it would be in even worse shape now. It
also would be suffering more if it hadn't moved to hedge its
position. Since 1984, its sales from Europe have more than
doubled to $1.9 billion, while sales from the U.S. rose 45%
to $8.1 billion. And Shin Caterpillar Mitsubishi Ltd. of
Japan, a joint venture with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.,
posted sales exceeding $2.5 billion last year -- nearly a
fourfold increase from 1984.</p>
<p>Many U.S. companies say they've limited the damage from
exchange rates because they are more competitive today than
they were in the 1970s and 1980s. "We've turned our nose to
the grindstone," says Adrian Dillon, the chief economist at
Eaton Corp., the Cleveland-based maker of truck and
electronic components.</p>
<p>But the decline in the yen also makes it less likely that
companies will enjoy the fruits of their streamlining
efforts. Caterpillar, for instance, may not be able to raise
prices at all this year -- and may even have to offer
discounts. At the moment, Komatsu seems content to maintain
its prices and increase its financial war chest. But as its
margins fatten, it could easily trim prices in a drive for
market share.</p>
<p>That's a disturbing thought for Cat dealers such as B.
Crane Patten Jr. of Elmhurst, Ill. Mr. Patten vividly
remembers the one-two punch of a strong dollar and weak sales
of the early 1980s, when he had to lay off 420 of 700
employees at his dealership and diesel-engine business. He
also sold his airplane, scrapped free coffee for employees
and closed the executive dining room.</p>
<p>The problem today, Caterpillar dealers say, is that their
margins have shrunk by half. Thus, the dealers have less
flexibility in offering deals, while Komatsu dealers have
lots of elbow room.</p>
<p>Some economists and manufacturers fear that a declining
yen carries repercussions that will be felt for months, even
years. "I'm worried the whole manufacturing sector could get
set back again," Mr. Paris says. U.S. auto makers say they
already are feeling increased heat from Japanese competitors.
"All of a sudden, they appear to have more of a margin to
offer (sales) incentives," says Mr. Mohatarem, the GM
economist.</p>
<p>Caterpillar officials acknowledge, however, that there
aren't any clear solutions to their problems. In the first
half of the 1980s, the dollar was overvalued against most
major currencies. Today, some economists see it more as a
"yen problem." But a recent increase in Japanese interest
rates didn't boost the yen, as some observers had hoped.</p>
<p>Caterpillar and other U.S. companies would welcome a
reduction in U.S. interest rates, which could make the dollar
less attractive and bolster their business. But the Fed fears
that if it acts to lower rates, U.S. inflation probably would
increase. In addition, attempts to intervene in currency
markets -- in the current situation, to buy up yen to
strengthen the currency -- might not work. With
foreign-exchange trading sometimes totaling a staggering $500
billion a day, according to some estimates, the financial
markets can easily swamp any central-bank maneuvers.</p>
<p>So, some experts contend that it's better to let the
markets themselves correct any short-term imbalances.</p>
<p>But that doesn't stop Caterpillar from pressing its point.
And if the yen doesn't stop slumping, more manufacturers may
join Cat's chorus. Vows Mr. Elder, the company's lobbyist:
"In the next couple of months, we'll turn up the heat."</p>
