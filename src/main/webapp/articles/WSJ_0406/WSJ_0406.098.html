	<p class="article-leader">The politics of Eastern Europe have held the world's
attention. But if these brave people are to succeed, the
world had better keep paying attention when the talk turns to
the harder subject of money. This weekend at the G-7 meeting
in Paris, finance ministers will hear that a $12 billion
development bank will do wonders for Eastern Europe. In fact,
history suggests that it will prolong the shift from
socialism to capitalism.
   The Eastern European Development Bank (EEDB), with 27
Western and seven East European member nations, was largely
the brainchild of French President Francois Mitterrand. He
insisted that the European Community provide most of the
capital and make most of the decisions. The U.S., Japan and
the Soviet Union each are invited to chip in 8.5% to 10% of
the capital.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The U.S. was leery of French insistence that 40% of the
lending in Eastern Europe go to governments rather than
private firms, but it went along. It is drawing a line,
however, on loans to the Soviet Union. Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady told Congress that the U.S. won't join if the
Soviets are allowed to borrow more than their share of the
capital. He noted that the Soviet Union is clearly not yet an
emerging democracy. Since it still spends 15% to 20% of its
GNP on defense it has ample resources to finance perestroika.</p>
<p>But U.S. concerns go deeper. If the record of the World
Bank and its offshoots is any guide, an EEDB would help
preserve statism. The French insist that the EEDB will be
different, with 60% of its loans going to the private sector.
But this is a distinction without a difference.</p>
<p>Such bodies fund private-sector borrowers by giving the
money to state-run development banks whose bureaucrats then
"on-loan" to private borrowers of their choosing. Last year a
World Bank internal report noted that in a sample of 18 of
these "directed credit" programs, an average of nearly 50% of
loans were in arrears. Yet, the first World Bank loan to
post-communist Poland this February was $265 million to the
National Bank for "directed credit" to export industries. Is
it likely that the EEDB's private-sector lending will be more
rational?</p>
<p>Such infusions often act as a narcotic, delaying needed
economic reforms and thus making matters worse. Politicians
can't help but look at aid as a way to delay privatizations
and painful price reforms. The Czechs seem to agree.
President Vaclav Havel told Margaret Thatcher during his
British visit that "we value your advice and moral support
far more than your money."</p>
<p>U.S. policymakers are going along with the EEDB partly out
of concern that the U.S. will be ridiculed if it doesn't. But
rather than fret about its image, the U.S. should stand up
for the incentive-based policies that the rest of the world
is now emulating.</p>
<p>Any money the U.S. does send to Eastern Europe would be
better spent in the forms recommended by the commission on
Hungary, whose conclusions are summarized in an article
nearby (See: "A Recipe for a Free-Market Hungary" -- WSJ
April 6, 1990). Additionally, Eastern Europeans could be
brought to the U.S. to work as trainees and interns, much the
way American corporations routinely bring foreign nationals
to the U.S. for intensive training.</p>
<p>The West should be helping Eastern Europe. But the
proposed EEDB looks no better than the other development
banks. If they are so good, how come so many of their Third
World clients are still doing so badly?</p>
