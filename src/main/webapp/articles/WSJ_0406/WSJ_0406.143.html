	<p class="article-leader">Greyhound Lines Inc., Dallas, said it had fired 60
employees for incidents of violence and vandalism associated
with the strike by 9,300 members of the Amalgamated Transit
Union. Company spokesman George Gravley said the company was
processing a "very large number" of complaints that would
result in additional terminations.
   The action came a day after a suspicious fire erupted at a
Greyhound terminal in Boston. Since the strike began onMarch
2, 29 Greyhound buses and terminals have been struck by
gunfire, and the company has received 81 bomb threats. In
addition, one striker driver has been killed and one
replacement was seriously injured.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Gravley described as "talk and not action" a statement
issued earlier in the day by ATU President James La Sala, who
condemned the violence as "reprehensible." Greyhound, a unit
of GLI Holding Co., has said it will not return to the
bargaining table until a week passes without violence.</p>
<p>Regarding that stance, Mr. La Sala complained that: "Any
crackpot can stop negotiations from resuming by calling in a
phone threat or by taking a potshot at a bus."</p>
