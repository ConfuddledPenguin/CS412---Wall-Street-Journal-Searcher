	<p class="article-leader">Bethlehem Steel Corp. agreed to pay a fine of $1 million
to New York state for violating state air-pollution laws. The
steelmaker also agreed to eliminate a major source of benzene
emissions from its Lackawanna, N.Y., plant.
   Under the agreement, reached after negotiations between
Bethlehem and New York state environmental officials,
Bethlehem will cease operating one of its three coke oven
batteries by July 1, 1990, construct a closed-loop cooling
system and upgrade its two remaining coke oven batteries at
Lackawanna. That will result in a 95% reduction of the 1.5
million pounds of benzene that the plant emits each year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Bethlehem also must pay $700,000 of the fine within 30
days. Payment of the remaining $300,000 will be suspended
subject to Bethlehem's compliance with the July 1
cease-operation date.</p>
