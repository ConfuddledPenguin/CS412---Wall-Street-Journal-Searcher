	<p class="article-leader">Amgen Inc. said it appealed an order issued last month by
a federal judge in Boston under which Amgen and Genetics
Institute Inc. are required to cross-license their respective
versions of the anti-anemia drug erythropoietin, or EPO.
   Separately, Amgen confirmed that Robert D. Weist, senior
vice president, general counsel and secretary, resigned those
posts Monday. Mr. Weist, 50 years old, joined the company in
the early 1980s and in recent years has been Amgen's point
man in the tangled patent litigation.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"He will be a consultant on the team, but he will no
longer be heading up the team," said an Amgen spokesman in
Thousand Oaks, Calif. The spokesman said he didn't know why
Mr. Weist resigned. Mr. Weist couldn't be reached.</p>
<p>A federal magistrate ruled last year that both Amgen and
Genetics Institute are infringing certain provisions of each
other's EPO patents. Last month, Judge William Young in
Boston issued an order aimed at making the companies at least
temporarily cross-license their versions.</p>
<p>Spokesmen for Cambridge, Mass.-based Genetics Institute,
and its marketing partner, Chugai Pharmaceutical Co., Japan,
declined to comment on Amgen's appeal.</p>
