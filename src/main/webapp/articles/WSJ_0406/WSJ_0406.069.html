	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The Conference Board, reporting that
help-wanted ad volume continued to fall in February, said
that it may begin to stabilize over the next few months.
   The Help-Wanted Advertising Index, a seasonally adjusted
indicator of hiring plans, fell six points from January's 147
and eight points from 149 in December. The index was 14
points lower than in February 1989.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Labor demand was measurably lower in February 1990 from a
year ago because of the slower pace of economic activity over
the past 12 months, said Ken Goldstein, a Conference Board
economist. "However, economic growth is not expected to erode
from its present level," he said, "suggesting that recent
declines in help-wanted advertising are unlikely to
accelerate."</p>
<p>Ad volume, measured in 51 major U.S. newspapers, rose in
three of nine regions. Leading was the West North Central
region with a 6.8% increase. The East South Central and West
South Central regions showed increases of 1.7% and 1.5%,
respectively. Declines ranged from 6.9% in the East North
Central region to 3.9% in the Pacific region.</p>
