	<p class="article-leader">LEXINGTON, Mass. -- Unitrode Corp., plagued with
quality-control problems that prompted the Pentagon to ban
taking shipments of some semiconductor products, said its
president is resigning and its chairman will retire.
   The electronics company said Howard F. Wasserman, 45,
president and chief executive officer, is resigning to
"pursue other interests" and George M. Berman, 64, chairman
and founder, is retiring. Both moves take effect June 5.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Robert L. Gable, 59, an outside director who headed a
special committee overseeing an investigation into the
quality-control problems, will become chairman and chief
executive. Franklin P. Weigold, 51, who is a Unitrode vice
president, will become president and chief operating officer.</p>
<p>Although Unitrode said the departures of Messrs. Wasserman
and Berman are voluntary, analysts said the quality-control
problems may have led to the change.</p>
<p>Mr. Wasserman said he was "frustrated by the lack of
results I had been able to bring about in the last three
years. The potential for the company to succeed is still very
high and . . . some other people in the organization may be
able to achieve it."</p>
<p>Mr. Gable is the former president of Computervision Corp.,
a Bedford, Mass., computer-aided design and manufacturing
systems concern that was acquired by Prime Computer Inc. in
1988.</p>
<p>"Our immediate task is to restore {Unitrode} to
profitability as soon as possible and to enhance its position
as a dependable supplier of quality products," Mr. Gable
said.</p>
<p>Partly because of the shipment ban, Unitrode posted a
$20.6 million loss in the fiscal year ended Jan. 30.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Unitrode closed at $4.625, up 25 cents.</p>
