	<p class="article-leader">Concerning your Feb. 27 article "As HMO Premiums Soar . .
.":
   Yes, the number of HMOs is less than a year or so ago --
but HMO membership continues to increase. The smaller number
of HMOs is mostly the result of consolidation and mergers.
HMOs continue to attract more and more new members.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yes, HMO premiums have increased -- but "soar" is an
overstatement, especially when you compare HMO increases of
16.5% for 1989 with indemnity increases of more than 20%.</p>
<p>Yes, HMOs have to find new ways to control costs and still
provide a quality product and provide better data to
employers. But great progress has been made and will continue
to be and, contrary to your pessimistic view, the HMO, or
"Managed Care Industry," is proving to be more and more
popular as a way for employers and employees to meet
health-care needs.</p>

<p>You focused on a finding by A. Foster Higgins & Co. that
not many employers perceive they are saving money with HMOs.
Were you unaware the survey included a reality? The reality
is, employers pay roughly $300 less per employee for HMO
coverage than for indemnity insurance, a figure that
translates into about $4 billion in savings a year.</p>
<p>More encouraging news in the Foster Higgins survey went
unreported: Employers who get the data they seek are more
likely to believe HMOs save them money; the greater the
number of employees enrolled, the more likely the employer is
to be satisfied. Furthermore, where employers have the
greatest experience with HMOs -- the Far West -- they are the
most satisfied.</p>
<p>HMOs and employers are experimenting with "open-ended"
products so that employees will give HMOs a try. Once they
do, employees are likely to experience the levels of
satisfaction, often as high as 90%, reported by current
members, and to select their providers from within the HMO
network.</p>

<p>It has been our experience that HMOs rely completely on
arbitrary methods for controlling costs. Typically, an HMO
negotiates with physicians and, in our own case,
neurosurgical specialists, to reduce our fees. At first look
this might seem to be a prudent, cost-effective way to do
business. However, the real cost-savings in health care will
not be in the reduction of surgical fees, but rather by the
overall reduction of costs that are built into the
health-care system. Fee negotiation proves to be
counterproductive; the real savings in health care is by
tighter controls of unnecessary costs.</p>
<p>The goal of health-maintenance organizations to control
costs is certainly admirable. Our concern is the approach
that is often taken. For example, recently, one of our
patients was having a cervical-disk operation that requires
an intraoperative cervical X-ray. Because of the inexperience
of an X-ray technician, at least 25 additional minutes were
required in the operating time (which essentially doubled the
surgical time). This added between $500 to $750 onto the
patient's bill for the unnecessary delay in time.</p>
<p>We believe it is more prudent and cost-effective to reward
health-care providers that identify these "wastes" and that
work to eliminate such inefficiencies, rather than penalizing
them. We should all contribute to and expect more effective
and efficient patient care through education and
collaboration among physicians, nurses, insurance carriers,
institutions and health agencies, such as HMOs.</p>

<p>You say HMOs are "under attack" by consumers long
"dissatisfied" with HMOs, while employers are suddenly
dissatisfied. In fact, quite the opposite is true: Every
consumer-satisfaction survey available shows that consumers
prefer HMOs to traditional insurance. By contrast, employers
have been less satisfied for years because the savings from
HMOs is focused on lower employee cost-sharing.</p>
<p>The value of the benefits provided by HMOs is greater than
traditional insurance, even at a lower price, but the
employee receives most of the advantages. Employers simply
want to share in the savings, which is much different from
wanting lower prices or being dissatisfied with HMO premium
increases.</p>
<p>It is true that employers recently have shown tremendous
concern about the proliferation of HMOs with poor track
records, but this is not caused by higher prices. The real
problem for employers is that they cannot get enough
employees to go into HMOs. If they could get rid of
traditional insurance, their premiums would really be low
because there would not be any wasteful insurance products.
This is what most major benefits advisers are telling Fortune
500 firms every day.</p>

<p>If "only 28% of employers" feel "their rates fairly
reflect services delivered," does that mean 69% were
satisfied while only 31% disagreed fully?</p>
<p>The same applies when you indicated that only one-third
believe HMOs are effective in controlling health-care costs:
Does that mean 67% disagreed with your statement and were
satisfied that HMOs controlled costs?</p>
