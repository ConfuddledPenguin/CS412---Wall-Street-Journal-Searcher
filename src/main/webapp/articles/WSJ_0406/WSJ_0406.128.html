	<p class="article-leader">Sanyo Electric Co., Tokyo, said it developed a
new-generation, high-performance, nickel-metal-hydride
storage battery cell, which is rechargeable and yet provides
a relatively large energy density.
   The company said that the battery cell provides 1.8 times
the energy density of conventional nickel-cadmium battery
cells, and that it is suitable for use in equipment such as
transceivers, cellular phones and laptop computers.</p>

HR-4/3A, this autumn. The former weighs 26 grams with a
14.5mm diameter and 55mm length, while the latter weighs 51
grams, and is 17mm in diameter, 67mm in length.</p>
<p>The company plans to churn out 400,000 units of the
rechargeable cells a month in the initial production year.</p>
