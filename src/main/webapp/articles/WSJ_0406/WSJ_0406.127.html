	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- U.S. District Judge David Hittner barred
Torchmark Corp. from nominating five directors for American
General Corp.'s board, a move that could stifle Torchmark's
current bid to win influence with the insurance concern.
   Torchmark had proposed nominating candidates for five of
the six American General seats that are up for election on
the 15-member board at American General's annual meeting May
2.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>However, American General argued that Torchmark failed to
notify American General of its plans 60 days in advance of
the meeting, as required by American General's bylaws.</p>
<p>In granting the preliminary injunction, the judge said
that American General had shown that it had a substantial
likelihood of proving its case, that the company would be
injured if the injunction weren't granted and that the
injunction wouldn't harm the public interest.</p>
<p>Torchmark immediately said it plans to appeal the
preliminary injunction and said it still plans to solicit
proxies for a resolution calling for American General to
appoint a special committee to evaluate acquisition
proposals. The resolution also calls for American General's
board to hire an investment banking firm to solicit offers
for American General.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Torchmark, a Birmingham, Ala., insurer,
dropped a $50-a-share, or $6.3 billion, unsolicited bid for
American General after American General didn't respond to its
offer within 48 hours. American General had said it would
consider the offer at its next regularly scheduled board
meeting.</p>
