	<p class="article-leader">THE U.S. AND SOVIETS SAID Bush and Gorbachev would meet
late next month.
   Amid tensions over Lithuania, the president and the Soviet
leader agreed to meet May 30-June 3 in the U.S. The
announcement came as Secretary of State Baker and Soviet
Foreign Minister Shevardnadze continued talks in Washington
aimed at resolving arms-control disputes. The Soviets
reportedly eased their stance on a neutral, united Germany,
and said they would consider allowing direct flights of
Soviet Jews to Israel with assurances that the refugees
wouldn't be settled in the occupied lands. U.S. officials
said that Baker also warned Moscow over Lithuania, where
Soviet troops reportedly occupied the office of the
republic's prosecutor.</p>

immediately to observer status in world trade negotiations.
Bush had originally sought to delay Moscow's entry until next
year.</p>

<p>De Klerk and Mandela agreed on a new date for talks
between South Africa's government and the African National
Congress on giving blacks a share of political power. The
date wasn't disclosed. Before their Cape Town meeting, the
president accused the black nationalist of dissuading
homeland leaders from meeting with Pretoria.</p>
<p>Soldiers in Venda overthrew the government of the small
nominally independent homeland and said the territory should
be reincorporated into South Africa. The coup, apparently
bloodless, was the second in five weeks in a South African
tribal area. The fate of President Ravele wasn't known.</p>

<p>East Germany's legislature declared the nation a democracy
and began building a political system that will lead toward
reunification with West Germany. The Parliament also
empowered Christian Democrat leader de Maiziere, whose party
holds the most seats, to form a new government from the 11
parties in the legislature.</p>
<p>West Germany said it was proceeding with plans to replace
the East German currency with the Western mark by summer,
despite an uproar over a proposed 2-to-1 exchange rate. Bonn
also said it would open talks with East Berlin this month to
prepare for a full treaty on monetary union.</p>

<p>Authorities in China staged daylong rallies in Beijing's
Tiananmen Square to mark the annual day for mourning the
dead, preventing unofficial visits to the huge plaza to honor
those killed in last year's crushed movement for democratic
freedoms. It was the second time this week that the square
was closed to the general public.</p>

<p>Israel's Likud bloc sought to lure right-wing defectors
away from Peres in an effort to prevent the Labor Party
leader from forming a governing coalition. Peres, who claims
to have enough parliamentary support to form a new
government, reaffirmed that he would be able to pursue peace
talks with Arabs if he is named prime minister.</p>

<p>Cheney called for reduced congressional control over
details of Pentagon spending. Proposals unveiled by the
defense secretary seek to curtail some of the lawmakers'
prerogatives, including annual authorization of weapons
purchases and line-item review of the Pentagon budget.</p>

<p>A Pegasus rocket was blasted into space from a B-52
bomber, and the unmanned spacecraft placed a satellite into a

Base, Calif. The Orbital Sciences Corp. experimental rocket

shuttle.</p>

<p>Explosives experts in Colombia defused a 900-pound bomb
hidden in a truck in a Bogota suburb, a day after suspected
cocaine traffickers pledged renewed violence against an
anti-drug crackdown. Police said the vehicle was parked near
the homes of several high-ranking government officials.</p>

<p>Artillery fire erupted between rival Christian forces in
and around Lebanon's capital, leaving at least 14 people dead
and eastern Beirut ablaze, and shattering a brief cease-fire
called by Maronite Catholic clergymen. More than 800 people
have been killed in the fighting for control of Lebanon's
Christian enclave, which began Jan. 30.</p>

<p>The EPA released an annual survey on air quality. While
the study showed steady improvements since 1970 in seven
categories of pollutants, the agency found that the urban
smog problem became 15% worse in 1988 compared with the year
before, with 121 million Americans living in areas that
failed to meet national health standards.</p>
