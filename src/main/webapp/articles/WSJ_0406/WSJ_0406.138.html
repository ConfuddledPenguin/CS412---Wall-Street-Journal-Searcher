	<p class="article-leader">Excerpts from the Blue Ribbon Commission's report on
Hungary's transformation to a free market:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Since 1968's New Economic Mechanism, which decentralized
(some) decision-making, Hungary has seen repeated
half-measures to reform the exhausted command economy.
Politics did not permit full transformation. But an economy
only partially free, like a people only partially free in
their political life, ultimately is demoralized when false
hopes are dashed by experience.</p>
<p>Any large program will take years to put into place even
at maximum speed. The keys are a preannounced path and a firm
timetable. . . . Certain benefits should be apparent within
months -- for example, improved quality and availability of
consumer goods and services, cuts in waste and inefficiency,
and better employment opportunities for skilled, diligent
employees.</p>
<p>Practically all retail trade, service establishments,
workshops and similar sized firms should be privatized within
one year. . . . Parent companies should be forced to sell
their outlets and shops to private buyers who will obtain
real assets in exchange for cash and real payment
obligations.</p>
<p>A new Act on Agricultural Land (should) guarantee the
right of private ownership and the right to dispose of land.
. . . Land transferred earlier to the cooperatives, or
similar land, should be offered for repurchase to the
original owners.</p>
<p>Convert present import restrictions into temporary tariffs
and concurrently announce a firm timetable for the reduction
of such tariffs.</p>
<p>The current proportion of foreign ownership in many small
West European countries is about one-third of the country's
industry. At the beginning of 1990 foreigners own only about
2% of Hungary's industry, so there is ample room for
expansion, by any reasonable standard.</p>
<p>Hungary's (past loans) were not used for sound investments
that could generate foreign exchange earnings to service the
debt. Hungary (now) has to obtain additional capital imports
of about $1.5 billion a year for each of the next three years
in order to turn a potentially large net outflow into a net
inflow. . . . In large part, this current-account gap can be
financed though an aggressive policy of foreign investment.</p>
<p>The central government should retain broad planning
responsibility for the railroad system and for the national
networks; e.g., main roads, oil and gas pipelines,
electricity grids, and the telephone system. But it should
look for innovative ways of cooperating with the private
sector to finance, build, and operate (them).</p>
<p>The entire sector of state-owned apartments should become
globally self-financing in three years. Rent should be
adjusted to reflect real conditions, based on location, size,
and quality. (Any) subsidies should be given (upfront) to
people because they are poor and not because they occupy
particular dwellings. . . . Free-market rents should be
allowed to emerge for state-owned apartments of the best
quality. . . . The current process of selling off state-owned
flats should continue, though prices should be set closer to
real market values. . . . The government should not enter
into any more mortgage contracts which involve interest
subsidies.</p>
<p>Initiate steps to seek associate membership in the
European Community.</p>
