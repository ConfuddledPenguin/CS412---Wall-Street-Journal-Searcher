	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The Wall Street recession has found its way
inside the New York Stock Exchange, where last year's return
on market makers' capital plunged to 5.9%, the lowest level
on record.
   The specialists, the 46 firms that make markets in
individual stocks on the Big Board floor, found their
after-tax annualized return on capital fell to about half the
1988 level of 11.7%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The latest return is "the lowest since the exchange began
reporting these figures in 1981," said a spokeswoman for the
exchange.</p>
<p>The small return underscores the price wars sweeping the
Wall Street stock-trading business and the pressures faced by
many brokerage firms, who pay the specialists commissions. It
also reflects the growing competition faced by the Big Board
from regional and off-exchange trading.</p>
<p>"It is indicative of the same squeezes in the rest of the
industry," said Robert B. Fagenson, president of the
specialist firm Fagenson & Co. "Volume is down and trading
opportunities are down. Our revenue is someone else's
expense, and when our customers, the brokerage firms, are
under tremendous strains, we are one of the sitting ducks."</p>
<p>In the past, Big Board specialists have had years of
stupendous returns. In 1987, they finished with a 15.5%
return on capital despite the October crash. The best year on
record is 1983, when they earned 17.4%.</p>
<p>But recently, specialists and Wall Street brokers have
been feuding over trading costs. The big brokers argue that
their clients incessantly demand lower commissions. In turn,
the brokers want the trading-floor firms to cut fees.
Goldman, Sachs & Co. in January even started shipping orders
of 5,000 shares or fewer to the Midwest Stock Exchange to
pressure the floor firms to cut rates, though specialists say
that after about a month Goldman sent the orders back to the
Big Board.</p>
<p>"The {specialists'} portion of the commission pie is in
most cases higher than it should be," says Dudley Eppel, head
of equity trading at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "Rates on
the floor have not come down the way they have upstairs."</p>
<p>The pressure is still on, though negotiations are quieter
these days. Trading volume has stunted commissions so far in
1990 for both the "upstairs" traders and the floor firms.
Average daily New York Stock Exchange volume fell 3.7% in the
first quarter to 159.2 million shares from 165.3 million in
the year-earlier period. Also, some brokerage firms are
parting with their traditional alliance to the Big Board and
sending orders to regional exchanges and off-exchange market
makers where trades are cheaper.</p>
<p>In another sign that times are tough on the Big Board
floor, New York Stock Exchange seat prices are falling
sharply this year. In February, a seat was sold for $351,000,
the lowest price since January 1985.</p>
<p>Despite the gloom, a few brokerage and specialist
executives think the bottom of the Wall Street recession may
be in sight.</p>
<p>"Wall Street is going through a cycle that we've been
through many times before," says Donald Stone, New York Stock
Exchange vice chairman and senior partner at the specialist
firm Lasker, Stone & Stern. "In the 1990s, there will be the
realization that equities are the place to be and we will go
into a very big stock market."</p>
<p>Charles B. Milligan, co-director of PaineWebber Group
Inc.'s equity department, which recently bought a Big Board
specialist firm, adds: "The New York Stock Exchange has had a
lot more difficult times than it's weathering now. If a
specialist firm is a franchise, and if you staff it
correctly, you should be able to make a great deal of money."</p>
