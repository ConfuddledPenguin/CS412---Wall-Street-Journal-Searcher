	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Sotheby's Holdings Inc., the British-based
auction house, may finally get to be a real estate developer.
   Sotheby's has long sought to build a tower of luxury
condominium apartments atop its Manhattan auction
headquarters. Late Wednesday, it cleared a local hurdle in
the four-year-old effort.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The subcommittee of a local community board, which has
been meeting on-and-off since 1986 with Sotheby's officials,
voted to give the apartment project a green light. However,
some area residents gathered at the meeting expressed
opposition.</p>
<p>"The community's concerns have less to do with the
building than with quality-of-life issues" such as increased
limousine traffic and construction noise, said Hedi H. White,
chairman of Community Board Eight, an advisory group which
oversees development on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. But
Sotheby's pledge to construct low-income housing, probably on
a site on East 96th Street, was seen a benefit to the
community, she said.</p>
<p>The project, which will add 26 residential floors and a
health club above Sotheby's headquarters at East 72nd Street
and York Avenue, was certified by the Department of City
Planning Feb. 27. It still awaits approval by the full
committee of the community board, which meets Wednesday, and
then by the city's Board of Estimate.</p>
<p>Sotheby's already has a real-estate brokerage division
which handles sales of luxury homes. A. Alfred Taubman, head
of Taubman & Co., one of the largest real-estate development
firms in the U.S., is the auction house's chairman.</p>
<p>Architect Michael Graves designed the tower, which
includes 256 apartments. In addition, Sotheby's will add one
floor to its existing four-story auction facility, which will
be remodeled while auction operations continue. Mr. Graves is
also the designer of a controversial addition to the Whitney
Museum of American Art in New York. His design for the
Sotheby's building -- full of details such as balconies that
jut out at angles and diagonal designs of glazed ornamental
tile -- is modeled in part after an Italian palazzo.</p>
<p>The building was originally scheduled to be finished in
1989, but "given the state of the New York real estate
market," it probably was in Sotheby's interest that the
project has been delayed, said Michael Ainslie, Sotheby's
president. Even after approval, "we didn't say we're going to
build," he added.</p>
<p>But Shelly S. Friedman, an attorney for Sotheby's, said
construction will probably begin late this year or in early
1991.</p>
