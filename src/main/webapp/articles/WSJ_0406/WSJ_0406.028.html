	<p class="article-leader">I find it incredible that your television critic Martha
Bayles would call Ernest Hemingway's "The Old Man and the
Sea" a "pretentious, mediocre novella" (Leisure & Arts, March
15). I would like to remind her that Hemingway won the Nobel
Prize for literature for this work in 1954. Ms. Bayles's
judgment undoubtedly has been altered by watching too much
TV. I suggest that in the future she forgo literary criticism
and stick to reviewing such masterpieces as "The Gong Show."

<p>"The Old Man and the Sea" re-established Hemingway as one
of the significant writers of the 20th century. Even
Hemingway's most virulent literary critics would hesitate to
describe "The Old Man" in such negative terms.</p>
<p>Ms. Bayles, who must spend much of her working life
watching television, has obviously had her tastes jaded by
that most pretentious, mediocre media.</p>
<p>As a bookseller, I am pleased that she is not a book
reviewer and hope she continues to work in a field to which
she is so nicely suited.</p>
