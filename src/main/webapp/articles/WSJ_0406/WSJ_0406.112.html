	<p class="article-leader">ZURICH, Switzerland -- A study by Union Bank of
Switzerland forecasts lower inflation in most major
industrial countries in 1991.
   The bank's economists estimate that average U.S. inflation
in 1991 will ease to 4.3%, after 4.5% this year and 4.8% in
1989.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Japan should see average inflation fall to 2.0% in 1991
from 2.5% this year and 2.3% last year. West Germany,
meanwhile, is expected to have inflation of 3.0% next year
and this year, after 2.8% in 1989.</p>
<p>The most pronounced improvement is expected for the U.K.,
where average inflation is seen sinking to 4.0% in 1991 after
6.8% this year and 7.8% in 1989.</p>
