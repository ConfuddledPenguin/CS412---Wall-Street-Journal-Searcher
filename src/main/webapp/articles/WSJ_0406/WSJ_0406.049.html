	<p class="article-leader">SAN ANTONIO, Texas -- National Bancshares Corp. of Texas
said it has come under pressure from certain creditors to
sweeten the terms of its debt-swap offer, but added that
federal regulators said they would block any changes in the
proposal.
   National Bancshares said the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. threatened to use its newly endowed powers to close the
troubled bank holding company's solvent member banks --
scuttling a pending open-bank recapitalization plan -- if at
least 85% of the company's $25 million in debentures aren't
tendered by the April 26 deadline.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Terms call for holders to receive $1,000 face amount of
increasing-rate senior subordinated debentures, due 2006, and
10 common stock warrants, for each $1,000 face amount of its
10% convertible subordinated debentures, due 2006. Creditors
estimate that the proposed swap would give them about 30
cents on the dollar of original debentures.</p>
<p>Regulators say the swap is crucial to the recapitalization
plan, under which Equimark Corp. of Pittsburgh agreed to
invest or raise about $116 million of new capital for
National Bancshares. The FDIC is expected to contribute about
$255 million to the recapitalization. If the debt swap isn't
completed, the FDIC has said it would attempt to use the
so-called "cross-guarantee" provisions of the 1989 thrift
bailout bill to seize assets belonging to solvent National
Bancshare banks to help defray the costs of rescuing
insolvent subsidiaries. Such a move would likely render the
healthy banks insolvent, too, National Bancshares said.</p>
<p>Some creditors decried the FDIC's tactics, predicting that
the move would backfire. "They're doing this as a
Gestapo-like threat to bondholders," said Jay Lustig, an
analyst at Drake Capital Securities Inc., Santa Monica,
Calif. He predicted that few bondholders would agree to the
swap unless they receive a better offer.</p>
<p>But an FDIC official said the agency won't back down.
"It's a free world," he said. "If {creditors} would rather
have bankruptcy, they have that option."</p>
