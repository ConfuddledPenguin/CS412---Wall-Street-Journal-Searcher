	<p class="article-leader">John Sununu at least deserves credit for candor. The White
House chief of staff was talking to business lobbyists
assembled for a clean-air pep talk last month, and it wasn't
going well.
   The visitors were bewildered and angry. They'd endorsed
George Bush's original clean-air bill. But now they felt
betrayed by the White House embrace of a Senate "compromise"
far more expensive and regulatory. After a shouting match
with lobbyist William Fay, Mr. Sununu replied that sometimes
you just have "to punt."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The football metaphor perfectly captures the White House
performance on the politics of clean air. Drug czar William
Bennett likes to say that politics, like football, comes down
to "time of possession." If you're not moving the ball on
your opponents, they're moving it on you. Despite all the
self-congratulation, the Bush White House on clean air has
resembled Northwestern containing Notre Dame.</p>
<p>The official White House line is that this week's Senate
bill is a big victory, of course. Privately, White House
sources will concede that its January veto threat against a
bill costing more than $19 million has been breached, though
they add they had no political choice.</p>
<p>Even more privately, many White House officials agree that
the business lobbies have a right to be angry. The most
influential environmental skeptics, budget director Richard
Darman and chief economist Michael Boskin, didn't wield much
clout on this one. The administration's greens and White
House process-is-policy aide Roger Porter did the
negotiating.</p>
<p>Anecdotes suggest the breadth of the clean-air rout:
Though the devil is always in the regulatory details, the
White House left the drafting of its own bill to what Mr.
Sununu would later call "unnamed bureaucrats" at the
Environmental Protection Agency. They obliged with an onerous
regulation on clean-air permits.</p>
<p>This early blunder led to the ludicrous scene this week of
the White House lobbying the Senate to pass an amendment
repudiating the White House's own proposal. Not surprisingly,
the Senate hanged Mr. Bush with his own rope, 51-49.</p>
<p>The administration also blinked on a last-minute amendment
that dictates an entirely new gasoline (and, not
coincidentally, a new subsidy for the ethanol industry).
White House officials had once called such an amendment
veto-bait. But after Senate minority leader Bob Dole joined
the cause, the same officials dropped out of sight.</p>
<p>Oil companies say this gasoline redesign will raise prices
from 15 to 25 cents a gallon, even if the new formula works.
Supporters say the cost is only a penny a gallon. Compromise
and assume it's a mere eight cents a gallon. That's still a
hefty gasoline tax, a direct transfer of wealth from
working-class drivers to Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., the
principal maker of ethanol. Clean air has nothing to do with
it.</p>
<p>These and other stories have eliminated any credibility
from a White House veto threat. Sen. Steve Symms (R., Idaho)
hoped to kill the bill by supporting an expensive amendment
(sponsored by Robert Byrd of West Virginia) to compensate
coal miners thrown out of work. Mr. Sununu called to twist
his arm. He told the senator that even the Byrd amendment
wouldn't prompt a veto -- the opposite of what the
administration was saying in public.</p>
<p>White House officials say they'll do better in the House,
relying on their alliance with Democratic Rep. John Dingell
of Detroit. But their embrace of the Senate bill has given
Mr. Dingell less latitude. No politician now wants to be less
"green" than the White House, so the greens need to make
fewer concessions. "It's as if they played a game of chess
without thinking they had a second move," says Mr. Fay, the
business lobbyist.</p>
<p>It may be true, as many in the White House argue, that by
anteing up on clean air, Mr. Bush proves his green
credentials and so can resist green extremists in the future.
Robert Teeter, the White House pollster, has numbers showing
Mr. Bush with low credibility on the environment.</p>
<p>But Karlyn Keene, who follows public opinion for the
American Enterprise Institute, thinks that misreads the
public mind. A consensus clearly exists on preserving the
environment as an end, but the public is far less clear about
means. Ms. Keene says George Bush has more leverage to
negotiate a better bill than his advisers understand.</p>
<p>More disappointing for the long run, no one in this
administration has made a case for an alternative
environmentalism -- one that speaks of the ecological
benefits of growth and new technologies, or of the disaster
that befell Eastern Europe from the same sort of
command-and-control economics many environmentalists now
want.</p>
<p>Instead, Mr. Bush has implicitly embraced the apocalyptic
assumptions of the greens. This week, he was planting a tree
for clean air and decrying "extremists" on all sides -- as if
the owner of a polluting dry-cleaning business is somehow a
radical. His EPA director, William Reilly, raised the specter
of 50,000 "premature deaths" from air pollution, just the
sort of unproved scare statistic used by the greens. The
environmentalists are winning a political grand slam: a bill
that has enormous economic costs but that the public sees
described as too "weak."</p>
<p>Messrs. Reilly and Bush like to say they favor
environmental "stewardship." It's a good word, a Bush kind of
word, suggesting moderation and a check on democracy's
tendency toward extremism in the name of desirable goals like
clean air. Yet both men have embraced the green movement's
rhetoric. They've flunked the steward's test.</p>
