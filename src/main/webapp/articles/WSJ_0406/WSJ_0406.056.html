	<p class="article-leader">Newspaper advertising in 1990, never expected to be
robust, is shaping up to be even weaker than 1989's dismal
showing.
   Publishers have been caught by surprise by an ad
environment far weaker than even some pessimists had
predicted. Ad revenue is flat or down at papers across the
country, especially in the Northeast. Retailers have slashed
their ad budgets, classified ads generally are down and many
publishers don't foresee the faintest flicker of a comeback
until the fourth quarter at best. Publishers are puzzled and
depressed as they watch the modest gains that they had hoped
for evaporate into thin air.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It has been just awful," says Valerie Salembier,
president of the New York Post. "What happened to us and our
competitors is the retail market fell out, period. It's that
simple. It's just endless, endless bad news. We're all
suffering, and no one really expected it, not to this
degree," she says.</p>
<p>John Morton, an analyst with Lynch, Jones & Ryan, says
newspaper revenue at the 17 companies he follows rose only a
modest 4% in 1989, the first time in recent memory that
revenue didn't keep pace with inflation. The first two months
of this year were even weaker, with flat revenue and
declining ad linage, he says. The first quarter is normally
weak, but rarely this weak. He expects ad revenue for the
year to edge up 4% to 4.5% overall.</p>
<p>Certainly, ad conditions vary from market to market.
Gannett, for example, says some of its newspapers in the
South and West -- including papers in Fort Myers, Fla.,
Tuscon, Ariz., and Marin County, Calif. -- are in line with
modest expectations of about 5% linage increases. Those in
the Northeast and elsewhere, though, are below projections.
Overall, advertising at Gannett's 82 newspapers is "weaker
than expected," with ad linage flat for the first two months,
says Sheldon Lyons, president of Gannett National Newspaper
Sales.</p>
<p>Perhaps the major culprit is the retail industry, which
typically accounts for half of all newspaper ads. Just two
days ago, a U.S. bankruptcy-court judge ordered the
liquidation of most Bonwit Teller retail stores. Bonwit's
sister chain, B. Altman & Co., is already out of business
following the bankruptcy-law filing last year of the two
chains' parent, L.J. Hooker Corp. Campeau Corp.'s U.S.
operations, including Bloomingdale's and Rich's, filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January.</p>
<p>New York newspapers have taken a double hit because of the
demise of some smaller but important retailers, like the
Crazy Eddie electronics chain. All in all, retailers are
spending far less than they, or the newspapers, had expected,
industry executives say. Says Ms. Salembier, "Every major
retailer has cut their budgets. No one is healthy right now."</p>
<p>The problem is compounded in some places, including Boston
and New York, by softness in classified ads -- especially in
help-wanted advertising. At the Boston Globe,
lower-than-expected ad revenue is due almost entirely to
falling classified advertising. For the first nine weeks of
the year, classified volume was off 12%, while retail
advertising was off just 2%, says Art Kingsbury, executive
vice president of Affiliated Publications, which publishes
the Boston Globe.</p>
<p>"The Massachusetts Miracle is over, and has been over,"
Mr. Kingsbury says. Classified advertising had been off in
1989, but "we hoped it would level off {this year}," he says.
"It hasn't."</p>
<p>Since help-wanted advertising is often used to gauge the
economy's health, industry analysts say the softness
forebodes uneasy times ahead. "The question is, despite what
all the indicators {coming out of Washington} say, have we
already slipped into a recession? Certainly, the media
business is having one," says Mr. Morton, the Lynch Jones
analyst.</p>
<p>The paltry showing of retail and classified ads is partly
countered at some papers, including the New York Post, by an
increase in national advertising, like auto and packaged
goods ads. But national advertising is also down in many
areas. Landon Associates Inc., a newspaper sales firm that
represents 630 local papers nationwide, says national
advertising is running 4% to 5% below what it had budgeted
for last fall. Help-wanted advertising is also weak in a
number of areas.</p>
<p>The poor advertising environment overall is taking its
toll on the major newspaper chains. Just last week, Times
Mirror reported that for the first nine weeks, ad revenue
fell 2.8%. While its flagship Los Angeles Times reported
gains, the chain was badly hurt by double-digit declines in
ad volume at its Newsday, Baltimore Sun, and Southern
Connecticut Newspapers -- all of which performed "well below
our earlier expectations," says Robert F. Erburu, chairman
and chief executive officer.</p>
<p>Newspaper publishers see little sign of relief until the
country's skittish economy makes a comeback. "When business
contracts, advertising is the easiest thing to hold back on,"
says Robert Keim, Landon's executive vice president and
director of sales. "Most advertisers look upon advertising as
an expense and not an investment, which is a terrible
mistake. Advertising generally produces results -- but their
focus is, `Well, I'll cut back right now and wait and see
what happens.'"</p>

<p>Wells Rich Wins Coolers</p>
<p>Seagram Beverage Co. pulled its Seagram's Coolers account
from Ogilvy & Mather and awarded it to Wells, Rich, Greene.</p>
<p>Billings weren't disclosed. The Seagram Co. unit said it
spent $15 million advertising the wine coolers in 1989.</p>
<p>Seagram put the account up for review in January, and
asked Ogilvy; DDB Needham, an Omnicom Group unit; and Wells
Rich to pitch the account. All handle other Seagram business.</p>
<p>An executive familiar with the situation said Seagram
decided to review the brand because it wasn't satisfied with
Ogilvy's creative work. Ogilvy, a unit of WPP Group,
developed the ad series that starred actor Bruce Willis.</p>
