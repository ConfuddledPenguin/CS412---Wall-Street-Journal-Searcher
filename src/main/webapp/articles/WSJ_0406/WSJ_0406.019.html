	<p class="article-leader">KATHMANDU, Nepal -- From Berlin to Managua, the past year
has seen people all over the world turn out despotic
governments in favor of democracy and human rights. Now
isolated Nepal is trying to join the club. For the past six
weeks, Nepali citizens have been rallying, mostly peacefully,
to demand a greater say in the running of their country.
   In response, the government has ordered all schools and
campuses closed, arrested hundreds of people and shut down
seven newspapers. Armed policemen patrol the streets in this
once polite and peaceful city; four people were reported
killed in the suburb of Patan last weekend when police opened
fire on a demonstration. The situation has reached a point
that cosmetic measures like the cabinet reshuffle announced
last weekend will no longer do. The government must come to
terms with the opposition or lose its legitimacy.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The demonstrations cap a difficult year for Nepal. In
March 1989, India refused to renew trade and transit treaties
with Nepal, closing down all but two of the 15 trade routes
along the 1,100-mile border. The combination of economic
tension and the refusal to relax the ban on political parties
sparked a resurgence of political activism. The seven
bitterly divided communist groups formed the United Left
Front in January; then the democratic Nepali Congress Party
decided to launch a protest movement Feb. 18, the anniversary
of the restoration of the Hindu monarchy in 1950. The two
groups joined together in the Movement for Restoration of
Democracy and pledged to fight for Western-style liberal
political institutions.</p>
<p>On the announced day, thousands of people converged on
Kathmandu's main street and in a dozen other towns and
villages. Their demands: dismissal of the government; a
lifting of the ban on political parties; and parliamentary
elections.</p>
<p>At the heart of the dispute is the Panchayat method of
government, which rules through a series of indirectly
elected councils, culiminating in a National Assembly, but
with the king as the source of all authority. Panyachat
leaders enjoy a life even Europeans would envy while the
average Nepali earns only $150 a year -- and inflation is
high. Nepalis can be jailed for up to 18 months without
charge. Religious freedom is limited.</p>
<p>Since the protests began, police have killed, by their own
count, 15 people, and released prisoners say they have been
tortured and beaten. The use of force has rallied most of
Nepal's intelligentsia behind the anti-government movement.
Doctors and health workers staged a general strike Sunday to
protest the imprisonment of medical workers while 250 lawyers
marched on the prime minister's office to demand the release
of 64 jailed colleagues. Government workers went on strike
for two hours yesterday.</p>
<p>There are signs that the movement may be gaining support
among urban workers. Industrial laborers in Hetauda staged a
one-day strike in support of the movement on March 22. The
following day, hawkers refused to sell state publications and
set fire to government newspapers. Housewives in Kathmandu
rattled steel pans at the university last Friday to make
their displeasure heard. But Harvard- and Eton-educated King
Birendra has refused to budge on the issue of Panchayat rule.</p>
<p>In Kathmandu, life is normal enough between
demonstrations, but Patan is as tense as a war zone. On
Tuesday, condolence meetings were held in memory of the
people killed Sunday, and on Monday, the Constitution of
Nepal is to be burnt publicly.</p>
<p>The government is getting nervous at what it calls the
"anti-national, anti-social, subversive and terroristic
elements out to disrupt peace and stability with foreign
backing." Official sources privately admit that they have
given Panchayat workers foreign aid money to stage counter
rallies. Meanwhile, the Swiss and West German governments
have officially notified Nepal that they will stop aid unless
the human-rights situation improves.</p>
<p>Even some of King Birendra's supporters oppose the
extended crackdown and have urged negotiation. A statement
signed Feb. 22 by 40 members of the 145-member national
assembly, including a former prime minister, six former
ministers and two nominees of King Birendra, criticized the
use of force and called for a political dialogue. They blamed
the "desperation of reactionaries" in the government for the
unrest.</p>
<p>Former Attorney General Sambhu Prasad Gyawali, who served
under the Panchayat for 11 years, has called on King Birendra
to recognize the major political parties to save Nepal "from
the whirlwind of a devastating civil strife." Last weekend,
Foreign Minister Shailendra Kumar Upadhyaya, who urged the
government to negotiate, resigned in protest against the
crackdown. Prime Minister Marich Man Singh Shrestha submitted
his resignation last night, the Associated Press reports. The
Panchayat policy committee is scheduled to meet on April 18
to discuss possible reforms, but it is unlikely to make the
dramatic concessions needed to curb the country's
restiveness.</p>
<p>For its part, the Congress Party could ease fears about
its aims by repudiating its alliance with the United Left
Front, which is led by Sahana Pradhan, the widow of a Maoist
leader, Puspa Lal. The ULF is violent and unpredictable.
Congress can hardly believe in the ULF's sudden conversion to
democracy, and the front's violent tactics give the
government a pretext to crack down on even peaceful protests.</p>
<p>The relationship between Nepalis and their king is
important. He is the symbol of national unity, the source of
all government policies, the defender of tradition and a
Hindu saint. That does not mean, however, that the
relationship cannot change. All around the world, from Japan
to Sweden, monarchy coexists with multi-party democracy.
Since 1950, the Nepal monarchy has based its legitimacy on
the consent of the people. Now is the time for King Birendra
to accept that his people want reform. The alternative is
more bloodshed, which can only weaken the ties that bind
together king and people.</p>
