	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo stocks managed to avoid another plunge, helped by a
strong rebound in the last hour.
   The Nikkei index of 225 issues fell 193.88 points to
finish at 28249.06. The index lost 316.78 points Wednesday.
In trading Friday, the index rebounded to rise 899.11 points,
or 3.2%, in the morning session to 29148.17.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In London, meanwhile, stocks Thursday finished a
lackluster session firmer and at intraday peaks, with little
motivation to pilot the market.</p>
<p>The Nikkei index plunged 1200 points midday because of a
fast-paced sell-off spawned by growing concern about reported
financial troubles of speculative groups.</p>
<p>Individual investors dumped their holdings beginning in
the morning, regardless of whether or not the shares were
related to speculative groups, traders said.</p>
<p>Lack of confidence in the market and fear that further
price drops would increase the burden of additional deposit
for margin buying hastened selling by individuals, analysts
said.</p>
<p>Fully stifled buying activity in the morning left a number
of shares unpriced.</p>
<p>However, after rounds of sell-offs were complete, stock
prices gradually turned upward, helped by a return of buying
activity led by the Big Four Japanese brokerage houses,
participants said.</p>
<p>Some stocks, which are believed to be held by speculator
groups and which have been falling sharply in the past week,
were pushed up by such dealer buying, which appeared to be an
effort to support the market, said a trader at Jardine
Fleming (Securities).</p>
<p>The Nikkei increased its upward pace as institutional
investors and investment trust funds started to hunt for
bargains among high-tech and pharmaceutical shares, as well
as among some large-capital shares, traders said.</p>
<p>Also, index-linked buying helped push up the Nikkei later
in the afternoon session, traders said.</p>
<p>They said that since the Nikkei fell sharply in the
morning due to a lack of buy orders, a small amount of buying
was able to push up the index.</p>
<p>Volume on the first section was estimated at 580 million
shares, down slightly from 596 million shares Wednesday.
Losers outnumbered gainers 648 to 185, while 44 issues were
unchanged.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section, which lost 35.15 points Wednesday, was down
17.14 points, or 0.83%, to finish at 2058.82.</p>
<p>The impact of the sell-off by individual investors hit the
second section severely, reflecting that the stocks in the
section are largely held by individual investors. The second
section index, which fell 95.45 points Wednesday, plunged
176.70 points, or 5.06%, to 3313.92. Volume was estimated at
eight million shares, down from 11 million shares.</p>
<p>Rumors that speculative groups are having financial
difficulties because of the continuous decline of stock
prices this year have been whispered now and then among
participants in the past month, traders said.</p>
<p>Wednesday, rumors that the groups' financial conditions
might be worsening to levels that would force them to
drastically reduce their holdings spawned a sell-off of
speculative shares.</p>
<p>And then yesterday, investor uncertainty was fueled by a
local newspaper's report that about 30 small-sized and
midsized securities companies suffered defaults on payments
for stock purchases by one of the speculative groups,
totaling 30 billion yen ($188.8 million).</p>
<p>All sorts of rumors swept through the market in the
morning, including that these securities firms are being
rocked and that a branch manager of a securities company
committed suicide.</p>
<p>During the lunch break, the Tokyo Stock Exchange denied
such rumors, calling them "totally unfounded" and urged
investors not to be carried away by them.</p>
<p>In trading yesterday, Honshu Paper ended at a bid of 1420
yen, up 160 yen. Nippon Beet Sugar gained 100 yen to 790 yen.</p>
<p>Sankyo closed at 2430 yen, up 160 yen.</p>
<p>Ono Pharmaceutical was up 210 yen to 4850 yen.</p>
<p>Large-capital shares fared well. Nippon Steel was up 30
yen to 540 yen. Sumitomo Metal was up 22 yen at 520 yen.
Toshiba gained 60 yen to 1090 yen, while Hitachi finished at
1650 yen, up 70 yen.</p>
<p>In London, dealers said today marks the end of a difficult
two-week trading account. Investors were content to close out
positions and wait until the next account opens, the dealers
said.</p>
<p>Some traders said investors were still digesting the
ramifications of Tokyo's gyrations, with whispers that should
some large Japanese investors find themselves short of cash,
they might have to liquidate British equity positions to meet
margin calls.</p>
<p>Investors "haven't got a clear picture of what's happening
in Tokyo so they're saying they'd rather not risk the money,"
said one chief dealer. "Also, we seem to be in quite a tight
range where we're running into buyers at 2222 {on the
Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 share index} but above
that, there's nothing there."</p>
<p>At the close, the FT-SE 100 share index was up 7.9 points
at 2239.5, its intraday best level and well above its
midmorning minimum of 2222. Some market watchers contended
that the index's early 10-point drop and subsequent
eight-point gain underscore the market's dearth of direction.</p>
<p>The Financial Times 30 share index gained 6.6 points at
1756.3. Volume was a moderate 499.5 million shares, compared
with 505.4 million shares Wednesday.</p>
<p>There was little corporate news to enliven the market. In
fact, the next major company results aren't expected until
well into next week. Of these, food retailer Tesco added 3.5
pence to 198 pence (6 cents to $3.25) ahead of Wednesday's
full-year earnings results. British Aerospace surged 18 pence
to 528 pence on news that its Rover Group unit saw its sales
rise 33% to 31,963 from 23,989 in February and 7.2% from
29,809 a year earlier. Rover's market share edged to 15% from
14% in February and 14% a year ago.</p>
<p>Sun Alliance, a British composite insurer, firmed 8.5
pence to 312 pence following Wednesday's earnings
announcement. The shares are still being supported by the 22%
increase in its full-year dividend, giving investors a good
value-for-money argument.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Europe, prices closed higher in Paris,
Zurich, Madrid and Milan, lower in Frankfurt, Oslo and
Helsinki, mixed in Stockholm and Amsterdam. South African
gold stocks closed lower.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, prices closed lower in Sydney, Wellington,
Manila and Singapore. Hong Kong, Taipei and Seoul were
closed.</p>
<p>Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.</p>
