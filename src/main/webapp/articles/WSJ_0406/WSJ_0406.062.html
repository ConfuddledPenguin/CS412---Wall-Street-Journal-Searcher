	<p class="article-leader">PHILADELPHIA -- A federal appeals court ruled that
Canada's Belzberg family, which owns about 10.68% of
Armstrong World Industries Inc., can directly contact
shareholders regarding proposed amendments to the company's
charter.
   The ruling modified a lower court order last month. A
judge had ruled that the Belzberg family couldn't directly
contact Armstrong shareholders regarding the amendments,
which would revoke certain anti-takeover provisions in
Armstrong's bylaws.</p>

directors to Armstrong's board and to revoke the
anti-takeover measures.</p>
<p>The Belzbergs have said they may seek to acquire the
buildings-product manufacturer.</p>
