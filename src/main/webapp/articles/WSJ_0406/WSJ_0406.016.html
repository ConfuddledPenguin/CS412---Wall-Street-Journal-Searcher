	<p class="article-leader">KUCHING, Malaysia -- Mention the fate of Southeast Asia's
tropical forests these days and watch official hackles rise.
   "I'm not an environmental villain," protests Abdul Taib
Mahmud, chief minister of Sarawak, a steamy Malaysian state
on the north coast of Borneo. He challenges conservationist
critics to fly over his timber-carpeted domain: "You'll be
lucky if you see any bald patches anywhere in Sarawak."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Like other government leaders across the region, Tan Sri
Taib has reason to be defensive. Like it or not, Southeast
Asia is being sucked into the center of a global controversy
over the world's fast-diminishing tropical forests.</p>
<p>International environmental groups assert that unless the
region's governments and timber industry mend their ways,
their actions will contribute to ecological problems that
ultimately will affect the entire Earth. Rapid deforestation
of the tropics, environmentalists say, threatens to wipe out
species of plant and animal life, contributes to harmful
changes in the global climate, and destroys forest-dwelling
societies.</p>
<p>But Southeast Asian governments, committed to using timber
earnings to help power their developing economies, are
lashing back. They say their forest policies aren't as bad as
the critics charge, and they see protectionist motives behind
the critics' complaints. Malaysia's combative Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad, for example, regularly blasts foreign
environmentalists' criticism as a subterfuge intended to keep
developing lands economically subservient long after the
industrialized West and Japan have laid waste to their own
forests.</p>
<p>The confrontation threatens one of Southeast Asia's
biggest industries. The region holds a quarter of the
estimated one billion hectares of remaining tropical forest
and controls about 80% of the world's $7 billion in annual
tropical-timber trade.</p>
<p>In Tan Sri Taib's Sarawak state, for example, the forest
provides thousands of jobs, pays half the government's bills,
finances local political dynasties and supports some of
Asia's richest, if most obscure, tycoons. One of the world's
main exporters of hardwood logs, Sarawak reaped an estimated
$1 billion last year from timber sales.</p>
<p>"If you stop logging tomorrow, you stop the whole state,"
says Sarawak's environment and tourism minister, James Wong
Kim Min.</p>
<p>Southeast Asia's forests aren't facing extinction yet. But
all is not well. Recent studies -- as well as interviews with
government officials, timber-industry officials, academics
and conservationists throughout the region, and visits to
logging sites and forest settlements -- make it clear that
current methods of exploitation are shrinking the size and
degrading the quality of Southeast Asia's remaining forest.</p>
<p>"The forests have been treated like mines," says a
European tropical-forestry expert based in Indonesia. "They
are exploited, not appreciated as a permanent resource."</p>
<p>The region hasn't suffered the wholesale destruction that
has marred some Latin American and African forests. Despite
heavy logging and an influx of settlers, huge areas of
Southeast Asia -- especially in Indonesia, Malaysia and Papua
New Guinea -- are blanketed in the ecologically richest rain
forests in the world, lush in timber, plant and wildlife.</p>
<p>Independent experts say long-term preservation of the
Southeast Asian forests depends on whether they can be
managed on an economically productive and ecologically sound
basis. That is technically feasible, they say, but the effort
will require fundamental changes in government and popular
attitudes toward the forests, a firm commitment to new
policies that place a higher value on the resource, and
sophisticated forest management never before seen in the
region.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the outlook is for an increasingly bitter
confrontation between Southeast Asian governments scrambling
to defend their policies and environmental groups seeking to
curtail commercial logging. The clash could cause headaches,
too, for international lending institutions and Western
officials who formulate trade and aid policies.</p>
<p>Last year, the World Wide Fund for Nature (formerly the
World Wildlife Fund), the world's largest private
conservation organization, called for a halt, within five
years, to all international tropical timber trade that isn't
produced by ecologically sound logging practices.</p>
<p>Only about 1% of tropical-timber output currently meets
the fund's criteria. The fund chastised Japan, in particular,
for abetting deforestation by being the largest importer of
tropical timber, more than 90% of it from Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Other environmental groups and "Green" political parties
in Europe want boycotts of tropical-timber products and are
spreading their campaign to the U.S., where the issue has
attracted the interest of legislators. The activists want
such institutions as the World Bank and the Asian Development
Bank to stay out of development projects that they charge
contribute to forest degradation. They also want to make
Western aid to timber-producing countries contingent on the
recipient's environmental record.</p>
<p>The pressure appears to be producing some results. The
European Parliament has called on the European Community to
adopt regulations imposing quotas on tropical-timber imports,
although the EC has yet to do so. In Indonesia,
environmentalists are claiming partial credit for Scott Paper
Co.'s recent decision to drop out of a $654 million
pulp-and-paper project, although the U.S. company says it
acted for other reasons. In Malaysia, conservationists claim
credit for a central-government decision, announced in
November, to stop the export of logs from its Borneo states
of Sarawak and Sabah. Both states are resisting the move,
however, and no timetable has been set for its
implementation.</p>
<p>Alarmed at the growing influence of the environmental
movement, Southeast Asian governments and the timber industry
have mounted a public-relations counterattack. Last month,
officials of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations,
which comprises Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Brunei, decided to send missions to
the EC, Japan and the U.S. to lobby against restrictive
timber-trade measures being advocated by environmental
groups.</p>
<p>Officials contend that Western critics are, wittingly or
not, promoting trade restrictions in the guise of
environmental protection. "If the world is really concerned
with tropical forests, then it should open its markets so we
won't be so dependent on forest industries," says Indonesia's
environment and population minister, Emil Sa lim. "Everybody
talks about tropical forests, but they don't talk about
development."</p>
<p>At the same time, however, Southeast Asian policy makers
concede that their forests have suffered from poor management
and ill-controlled exploitation. In the Philippines and
Thailand, for example, most primary forests have been ravaged
beyond hope of rehabilitation by reckless logging and illicit
settlement.</p>
<p>Southeast Asian officials also privately acknowledge that
despite adoption of logging and land-use policies that look
reasonable on paper, enforcement is haphazard and damaging
practices continue.</p>
<p>But officials in Malaysia and Indonesia say conditions in
their countries aren't as bad as portrayed by the critics.
They assert that foreign activists, and small but
increasingly vocal domestic environmental groups, are
ill-informed and present a distorted picture of what is going
on. Between them, Indonesia and Malaysia account for about
75% of the remaining primary-forest area in Southeast Asia
and are the region's main timber exporters.</p>
<p>Across Southeast Asia, officials say they are taking steps
to improve matters. For example, Indonesia's forestry
minister, Hasjrul Harahap, has pledged to crack down on
abuses by politically well-connected logging concessionaires
and is backing policies designed to make the timber industry
more efficient and more ecologically responsible. "The
question you're asking is, Can we control it?" he says. "The
answer is yes. But give us time and give us help."</p>
