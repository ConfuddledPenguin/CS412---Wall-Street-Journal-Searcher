	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- In an unusual move, Avon Products Inc.'s board
suggested that its largest shareholder not acquire additional
shares in the company.
   In a letter to Richard Fisher, a leading participant in
Chartwell Associates L.P., Avon Chairman James Preston wrote,
"Our board views Chartwell's additional purchases of Avon
stock as inappropriate." Chartwell owns about 16% of Avon's
common, or 12% of voting stock including preferred. On
Wednesday, Chartwell bought three million shares of Avon
common.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Preston said Avon's board believes additional
Chartwell purchases will unfairly influence Avon's desire to
"maximize shareholder value." He also expressed concern that
more purchases will be unfair to other holders and harm
Avon's door-to-door business.</p>
<p>To underline its point, the board amended Avon's share
rights plan. Share rights are attached to each share of
common, and in Avon's case allow shareholders to acquire Avon
stock at half price if any buyer passes a 20% common stock
threshold.</p>
<p>Now, the board has decided that if anybody acquires more
than 12.5% of Avon's voting shares, the board will have only
10 days to redeem the share rights for that particular buyer.
After that, the poison pill will automatically kick in at the
20% benchmark.</p>
<p>"What we're telling Chartwell is don't try to buy the
company on the cheap," said an executive familiar with Avon's
strategy.</p>
<p>A Chartwell spokesman said, "We are disappointed by Avon's
unilateral change in its rights plan. We haven't read the
full amendment, but we are considering all of our options."</p>
