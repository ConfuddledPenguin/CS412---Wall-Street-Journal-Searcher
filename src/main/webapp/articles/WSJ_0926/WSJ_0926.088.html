	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Trammell Crow Co. should thank Donald Trump.
   With all the attention focused on the flashy New Yorker's
recent financial troubles, the Crow company has been able to
duck the limelight while it restructures and refinances its
wounded real estate empire. "The Crow deals will make Donald
Trump's look like a walk in the woods," says a former Crow
partner, referring to the size of the company and the
complexity of the restructuring.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Crow retrenchment has occupied some of the country's
biggest lenders for almost 18 months as the recession in
commercial real estate has spread beyond the company's home
base of Texas to a great many markets in the U.S.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as the company's massive development machine
has slowed to a crawl, Crow has staked its future on property
sales and management of other people's properties,
historically second- and third-string lines of business.</p>
<p>Through all this, Crow's management and front-line
partners are stoic and, occasionally, even enthusiastic about
the changes the company is confronting. Loan workouts, for
instance, aren't the most pleasant of business activities,
but Crow takes pride in the orderliness of negotiations with
its lenders, in contrast to the panicky, 11th-hour efforts
that have characterized some other developers' refinancings.</p>
<p>As for the shift away from speculative development, the
party line, as reiterated by managing partner Joel Peterson,
is this: "We want to be a full-service real estate company."</p>
<p>The change of life isn't unique, of course. Other big
national developers and their lenders have had to switch
gears as rents and property values have declined and capital
sources have all but dried up. Crow has seen its top
Texas-based competitors, Lincoln Property Co. and Vantage
Co., slide from national prominence while paring staffs and
operations to a fraction of what they were in the early
1980s.</p>
<p>But Trammell Crow's fortunes or misfortunes are more
closely watched than those of most developers. It survived
the Texas real estate massacre because it's huge and diverse,
so its problems now show how bad things have gotten
nationwide.</p>
<p>The company's 170 partners hold $10.5 billion in assets
spread through a nationwide maze of more than 3,000
independent partnerships. Those partnerships have been
responsible for the development of about 8,000 individual
projects, from office towers to warehouses.</p>
<p>It's no wonder that Crow's woes affect lenders and real
estate markets across the nation. In mid-March, the company
and its lenders got an inkling of what a Crow collapse would
mean as rumors spread that the developer was about to default
on billions of dollars in loans.</p>
<p>In a twinkling, the stocks of Crow lenders nose-dived.
NCNB Corp., frightened by the heavy trading in its stock,
took the unusual step of revealing to securities analysts the
amount of its loans to Trammell Crow ($56 million at the
time) to prove its exposure was limited. Suddenly, people
started to think the unthinkable: Could Crow collapse?</p>
<p>The rumors about massive defaults proved unfounded and,
thanks to its complex partnership structure and sheer size,
collapse isn't likely. But aftershocks from that episode
still reverberate through the company.</p>
<p>With 15% to 20% of its 8,000 projects in financial
trouble, according to a person familiar with the company's
operations, Crow lenders, both domestic and foreign, have
been pressing questions about the viability of the company.
Shaken by the experience, the usually-secretive Crow
organization is discussing its problems more openly and has
retained, for the first time, an outside public relations
counsel to get its story out.</p>
<p>At one time, it was a grand story. Trammell Crow, a Dallas
native and accountant, founded the company 42 years ago on
the belief that he could create a national powerhouse in what
had traditionally been a regional business.</p>
<p>From his first warehouse development in Dallas's Trinity
River bottoms, Mr. Crow's vision of real estate grew to
include huge trade markets for the apparel, furniture and
computer industries, posh high-rise office towers,
first-class hotels, homes, apartments and retail
developments. (The trade markets and hotels are parts of a
separate business run by the Crow family. Trammell Crow
Residential, comprising the home and apartment interests, is
a distinct entity headquartered in Atlanta.)</p>
<p>To build this far-flung empire, Mr. Crow lured waves of
aggressive young Turks from the most prestigious business
schools, and gave them the same perks he and all other Crow
partners enjoyed: an $18,000 base salary and a spartan
cubicle. But, filled with promises of autonomy and equity in
the projects they created, they became to the development
world what investment bankers were to Wall Street during the
takeover craze -- cocky gunslingers eager to make big deals.</p>
<p>And, oh, did they make deals. For more than a decade,
starting in the late 1970s, Crow led all commercial
developers in the dollar value of annual new construction,
according to a survey by Building Design & Construction
magazine. The company colors -- two shades of blue -- could
be found in every major city in the country.</p>
<p>Crow employees saw themselves as an elite, the proteges of
the master builder. They took pride in the company's unusual
culture, with its egalitarian management structure and the
low base salaries intended to motivate creative development.</p>
<p>Now, top Crow officials say the compensation structure
worked too well. "Not only was it a little low," says
managing partner Peterson, "it encouraged only one kind of
activity." That was development.</p>
<p>"You had to keep developing," says one young ex-partner.
"It forced new partners to make some incorrect business
decisions."</p>
<p>Particularly in the Southwest, Crow's gung-ho developers
-- and a host of others -- didn't know when to stop building.
When oil prices nose-dived in the mid-1980s, followed by the
1986 tax reform that wiped out most tax breaks for real
estate investments, the overbuilt Houston market tanked.</p>
<p>Partners there quickly ran through the division's cash
reserves; eventually, Crow's 10 top partners were forced to
bail out the Houston group, dipping into their own pools of
profit.</p>
<p>As more and more Southwestern reserve pools were depleted,
Crow's top managers were confronted with a tough choice: Raid
reserves in other geographical divisions or force property
sales in healthy markets. Selling properties was anathema to
a company that, with few exceptions, still adhered to Mr.
Crow's philosophy: "The one who sells is wrong."</p>
<p>And when the reserve pools were first established in 1978,
partners had been promised that one division's funds wouldn't
be tapped for losses in another. With minimum reserve levels
rising steadily to cover mounting losses, partners' profits
were already dwindling. A raid on other divisions' reserves
could have spawned a mutiny.</p>
<p>A mutiny was brewing anyway, as Crow's spooked senior
partners decided to centralize decision-making, hoping that
would prevent overbuilding from spreading beyond the
Southwest. That prompted an exodus of dozens of key regional
partners, who saw the plan as a short-sighted overreaction to
what was then a Texas problem. Among them were rising stars
such as Allen Hamilton in Chicago, Don Childress in Atlanta
and Ned Spieker in California, each of whom now heads his own
real estate company.</p>
<p>But many partners, particularly the younger ones, found
themselves trapped. To finance development of their projects,
they'd borrowed from other Crow partners and the reserve
pools via a kind of internal chit system. As the projects'
health worsened, the partners dipped deeper into the
reserves.</p>
<p>Young partners were unable to leave without paying off the
balance of their debts to the reserve pools or having the
debts forgiven, an alternative that carried the threat of a
massive tax hit in addition to saddling remaining partners
with more debt.</p>
<p>"It was the Hotel California syndrome," says one former
partner, citing the lyrics of the rock song: "You can check
out any time you like, but you can never leave."</p>
<p>By the time Crow applied the development brakes, however,
the damage from overbuilding had been done. In Minneapolis,
for example, Crow built the first Class-A office tower in the
city's southwestern suburbs. But the company, and other
developers, continued building; now, about 25% of suburban
Minneapolis office space is empty.</p>
<p>As a result, Crow has defaulted on about $150 million in
loans for its Minneapolis projects from Teachers Insurance &
Annuity Association of America. To clear up those loans, Crow
is handing Teachers the keys to two of its Minneapolis office
buildings and selling the lender a third.</p>
<p>The negotiations with Teachers follow by just a few months
the completion of Crow's most ambitious refinancing effort to
date -- a $456 million deal with Equitable Real Estate
Investment Management Inc., a unit of Equitable Life
Assurance Society and a Crow lender since the 1950s.</p>
<p>Equitable played an important role in the company's
largest previous refinancing effort, back in 1977. Then, in a
now-legendary showdown with lenders, Mr. Crow offered the
lenders an unappealing choice: Accept loan terms dictated by
him or walk away with the keys and the deeds to the
properties they financed and manage the vast portfolio
themselves.</p>
<p>The lenders acquiesced, winning only a concession that Mr.
Crow, then 63 years old, relinquish control of the company to
J. McDonald (Don) Williams, a lawyer handling loan workouts
for the company. Eight years later, chief financial officer
Mr. Peterson was also named a managing partner. Mr. Crow
continues to manage his own investments, and maintains a busy
work schedule, but is no longer involved in day-to-day
management.</p>
<p>For this round of loan workouts, Crow was seeking $600
million to cure its biggest headache: the company's decimated
Southwest properties.</p>
<p>By early 1989, when the talks began, Crow's Southwest
region had bottomed out with a negative cash flow of $48.5
million. Much of the damage had been done by the collapse of
Dallas's two largest bank holding companies, emptying much of
the three million square feet of office space in three
high-rise towers built by Crow in downtown Dallas between
1982 and 1986. "Enough space came back on the market to fill
two high-rises," says Crow partner Barry Henry. "It was the
single most critical thing that affected downtown Dallas."</p>
<p>The Equitable money was earmarked to pay off loans from
about 30 Southwest lenders and bring other loans current.
While the talks were under way, Crow's 10 senior partners
ponied up even more of their own profits to keep the loans on
the Southwest properties current. In 1989 alone, according to
Mr. Williams, the 10 senior partners kicked in $57 million,
for a total of $200 million since late 1985.</p>
<p>By the time the Equitable deal was sealed this spring, the
size of the refinancing had been scaled back to $456 million,
reflecting the sales of some properties and improved
conditions at others. The bulk of the cash was used to pay
off loans on about 90 properties, which were then pledged as
collateral for the new debt. About $90 million was used to
pay down debt on another 60 Crow properties.</p>
<p>In mid-April, the company's 10 senior partners voted to
forgive about $175 million in internal debt racked up by
about 30 junior partners in the Southwest. As many as 25 more
partners will be offered the bailout this year. In return,
the young partners are giving up their cherished equity in
the projects they developed.</p>
<p>Now, remaining partners' earnings are no longer tied to
the profitability of their projects: most are drawing
market-rate salaries. "We don't want them to have the
incentive to go out and build," says Mr. Williams.</p>
<p>Finding new incentives is going to be tough. Some former
developers are being asked to manage properties for fees, an
activity with far less profit potential than building them
for a piece of the action.</p>
<p>Others are being asked to channel their natural
competitiveness into landing build-to-suit projects on behalf
of single tenants; still others are scouting real estate
acquisitions for the Crow company's joint-venture partners.
Crow's top executives insist they've been in these businesses
all along and are simply shifting emphasis to meet customer
needs.</p>
<p>Crow is doing that by tapping some of its most
enthusiastic young partners to lead new divisions in the
company, including once-unheard-of departments such as land
sales and corporate services, through which Crow is
contracting to take over some or all of the duties of
national companies' in-house real estate departments. The
first contracts in the pipeline are with Deerfield,
Ill.-based Baxter International Inc. and McKesson Corp., San
Francisco.</p>
<p>Not everyone is sticking around. Leasing agents and more
senior marketing principals have departed, and headhunters
specializing in real estate placements report receiving
record numbers of Trammell Crow resumes during the past nine
months -- including those of partners.</p>
<p>Others didn't leave voluntarily. During the past 18
months, the company has closed or consolidated 28 of its 90
offices and cut 8% to 10% of its 3,300 employees.</p>
<p>The company is counting on property management to generate
as much as half of its fee income, which last year totaled
almost $140 million. But that field is crowded with long-time
property-management firms competing against newcomers,
including former developers like Crow, displaced thrift
executives and even lenders.</p>
<p>There's an unmistakable sense of loss as Crow's top
officials discuss the changes, and their impact on Crow
partners. "It's not the same world they signed up for, but
it's the world we've got," Mr. Williams says. "There's been a
sea change in our business. This is not a get-rich-quick
industry any more. That's over. I'm sorry. I wish there were
a lot of development opportunities. This is now a
professional, nickel-and-dime, grind-it-out, customer-service
business."</p>
