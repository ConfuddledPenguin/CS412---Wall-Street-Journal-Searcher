	<p class="article-leader">Minton's, a Harlem nightclub, was home in the early 1940s
for young musicians who were, it seemed, not so much
expanding as dismantling jazz traditions. Charlie Parker,
Dizzy Gillespie, Bud Powell and Kenny Clarke, among others,
were creating jagged, explosive, continually surprising
rhythms and dizzyingly complex harmonies that seemed to
collide with themselves. The melody? It was there, somewhere,
if you could piece together the fragments as they whizzed by.
   But there was a melodist among them. Pianist-composer
Thelonious Monk was as disdainful of mass popular taste as
his colleagues; but as startlingly unexpected as his rhythms
and harmonies were, his melodic lines were so clear, strong
and often witty that they stayed in the mind.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the early 1950s, though most of the earlier pioneers
were now playing downtown for slightly more money, Minton's
was still alive. I started going up there to hear the
intermission pianist, Carmen McRae, who still played there
occasionally.</p>
<p>She also sang, just as she played -- crisp, precise (you
could hear the commas in the lyrics), with a sure, playful
beat. Then as now, she had the bearing of someone who had no
patience with small talk, small minds or people with
intrusive personal questions. When pressed beyond annoyance,
she could shoot you with her eyes.</p>
<p>McRae had been intrigued by Thelonious Monk's music from
the time Minton's had been the boy equivalent of King
Arthur's Round Table. She had been married to the pervasively
influential modern drummer, Kenny Clarke, and so, she says,
"I was in on the ground floor." For a long time, there were
those -- older jazz critics, for instance -- who found Monk's
pieces and playing strange, forbidding, lacking a center of
gravity. McRae, however, found that reaction
incomprehensible. "His music," she told me recently, "made me
smile."</p>
<p>For a long time, she has wanted to make an album of Monk's
works, with lyrics added, but she doubted that any record
label would be interested. RCA/Novus, however, proved her
wrong, and the resulting album is "Carmen McRae: Carmen Sings
Monk."</p>
<p>Preparing to record the album, McRae listened to tapes of
his recordings "for hours and hours -- in my car, in hotel
rooms on the road, in my bed at night. I lived with that
music."</p>
<p>Getting inside the music meant that she had to learn "how
the melodies were really meant to go, not the way I thought
they went. In fact, nothing went where you thought it was
going to go." Her knowledge of the piano -- which included
five years of classical studies starting when she was eight
-- helped a lot in understanding how Monk constructed his
lines and chords.</p>
<p>"I'm sure," she says now that the album is done and she's
including some of the songs in her concert repertory, "that
Monk never had a vocalist in mind for his songs. If he had,
he wouldn't have made them so hard."</p>
<p>On the album, she doesn't sound as if Monk is any harder
to sing than Jerome Kern. In all these years, I've never
heard McRae sound anything but coolly self-assured. Sometimes
she's been too cool, as if the music wasn't worth her full
attention, but here she's clearly enjoying the experience of
being stretched by Monk's music.</p>
<p>He had no patience with musicians who complained that his
music was too hard. On one recording session, Coleman Hawkins
and John Coltrane were having trouble reading his music. Monk
walked over to Hawkins and said, "You're the great Coleman
Hawkins, the guy who invented the tenor saxophone, right?"
And to Coltrane: "You're the great John Coltrane, right?"
Monk paused. "Well, the music is on the horn. Between the two
of you, you should be able to find it."</p>
<p>Carmen McRae found it. With a wit as crisp and pungent as
Monk's, she illuminates the fun in some of the songs. A far
more accomplished musician than many singers, she is able to
become a member of the band, not just a singer, without
trying to imitate an instrument. Her natural phrasing and
time blend with those of the sidemen. And her presence is so
authoritative that it might have impressed the inscrutable
Monk himself.</p>
<p>The songs include such essential parts of the Monk canon
as "Well, You Needn't," "Rhythm-a-ning," "Ask Me Now,"
"Pannonica," "Ugly Beauty," "'Round Midnight" and "Straight,
No Chaser."</p>
<p>The lyrics -- by Jon Hendricks, Sally Swisher, Abbey
Lincoln, Bernie Hanighen and Mike Ferro -- are not candidates
for anthologies. But like her good friend Billie Holiday,
McRae's sound phrasing and time are so arresting that the
lyrics take on connotations that the writer never had in
mind. Also, there is the powerful undertow of Monk's music.</p>
<p>McRae has chosen an especially attentive and intelligent
group of sidemen: Saxophonists Clifford Jordan and, on two
tracks, Monk alumnus Charlie Rouse; bassist George Mraz, a
consistently luminous musician; alternating pianists Eric
Gunnison and Larry Wills; and drummer Al Foster.</p>
<p>"Everything fits so well in Monk's work," John Coltrane
said, "Once you get to see the inside" -- the inner voicings
and rhythms. These are compositions, not just tunes.</p>
<p>One night, when Coltrane was playing with Monk, he came
off the stand looking desolate. "I missed one of those turns
on the inside," he told me, "and it was like falling down an
empty elevator shaft."</p>
<p>In "Carmen Sings Monk," there are no casualties. When his
music was going good, Monk would get up from the piano and
dance. Some said it was to make his rhythmic imperatives
clearer to his musicians. Some said that he was just feeling
so good he had to move. There are many passages in this set
during which it's difficult not to move.</p>
