	<p class="article-leader">Amoco Corp. and Occidental Petroleum Co. said they
tentatively settled long-simmering antitrust suits alleging
they fixed natural-gas prices in the Midwest in the early
1980s.
   A spokesman for Amoco in Chicago said, "Details of the
settlement are being held confidential pending final
documentation and approval by the court." An Occidental
spokesman in Los Angeles also declined to provide details on
the size of the settlement but said it "will have no
materially adverse impact on Occidental's consolidated
financial position."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing,
Amoco indicated that a series of claims arising out of the
same charges totaled about $5.6 billion against all
defendants. However, in the filing, Amoco called the claims
"grossly inflated" and predicted that the case wouldn't have
a material impact on it, either.</p>
<p>The settlement was reached yesterday just as the trial was
set to begin in federal district court in Kansas City, Kan. A
third defendant, the pipeline company Williams Cos. of Tulsa,
Okla., hasn't settled and trial is scheduled to begin today,
said Neil Woerman, chief of staff for the Kansas attorney
general, a plaintiff in the suit.</p>
<p>Late yesterday Williams couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Woerman also declined to disclose the size of the
settlements. He said the court has asked that settlement
documents be filed Friday, but isn't certain lawyers will
meet the deadline.</p>
<p>The suits were filed by attorneys general in Kansas and
Missouri as well as retail utilities in the states. The suits
alleged that units of Amoco, Occidental and Williams used a
1980 change in natural-gas pricing rules to amend contracts
to sell and supply gas to those utilities that doubled the
price.</p>
