	<p class="article-leader">AUSTIN, Texas -- Motorola Inc.'s microprocessor products
group said it slashed prices on its reduction instruction set
computer (RISC) chips by as much as two-thirds, in a bid to
improve its share in that fast-growing market.
   RISC chips are speedy, streamlined microprocessors
currently used in workstations, but they have become so
inexpensive that personal-computer makers are about to adopt
them. They pose a threat to conventional PC microprocessors
built by Intel Corp., Santa Clara, Calif., and Motorola.
Those two companies' own RISC chips lag significantly in
sales behind those of Sun Microsystems Inc., Mountain View,
Calif., and MIPS Computer Systems Inc., Sunnyvale, Calif.,
according to analysts. The market, however, is still young.
Motorola estimates that about 200,000 RISC chips were sold
last year, a small fraction of PC chip sales.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Motorola said it cut the price on its 16 megahertz 88100
chip to $49 from $148, and made cuts of similar magnitude on
chips that operated at speeds of 20 to 33 megahertz. The
prices apply to orders of 1,000 chips or more.</p>
<p>"The 88000 family now sets a RISC price/performance
standard for the industry," said Jeff Nutt, marketing manager
for the 88000 family. "We believe these are the lowest-price
RISC chips for the computer market."</p>
<p>But Andrew Allison, a consultant and editor of RISC
Management newsletter, Los Altos, Calif., said Sun and MIPS
are likely to keep their early leads.</p>
<p>"This is in response to Motorola's negligible market
position," Mr. Allison said. "They haven't succeeded in
acquiring any volume customers for the product and time is
flashing by." He added that Motorola's new prices are "now in
the ballpark, but given their market position that isn't
enough."</p>
