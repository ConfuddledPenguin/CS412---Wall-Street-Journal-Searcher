	<p class="article-leader">If Michael Milken's attorneys get their way, the former
$550 million-a-year man will be sentenced to work with the
Los Angeles Police Department to help inner-city youth.
   The attorneys proposed that Mr. Milken develop educational
and vocational programs to "combat the problems of drugs,
crime, unemployment and illiteracy threatening to destroy the
lives of inner-city youth in Los Angeles."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The proposal was based on a letter sent to U.S. District
Judge Kimba Wood by Daryl F. Gates, chief of police of Los
Angeles. Mr. Gates said in his letter that he met Mr. Milken
only once, several years ago, but that he believes Mr. Milken
would be uniquely qualified to establish a "domestic peace
corps" to help underprivileged children.</p>
<p>In their sentencing memo, Mr. Milken's lawyers promised
that he would work, at a minimum, from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.
daily, "and weekends {if the court desires.}"</p>
<p>The memo noted that "Michael would not find this work
easy; nor would it be risk-free." Chief Gates proposed that
Mr. Milken work "not behind a comfortable corporate desk, but
in the communities targeted by the program."</p>
<p>The government is expected to propose instead that Mr.
Milken serve a long prison term, and that its length be
dependent in part on his willingness to cooperate in the
government's continuing investigation of securities-related
crime.</p>
<p>Mr. Milken's lawyers oppose any attempt to link the length
of the sentence to his cooperation, arguing that his plea
agreement made clear that he would cooperate only after his
sentencing.</p>
