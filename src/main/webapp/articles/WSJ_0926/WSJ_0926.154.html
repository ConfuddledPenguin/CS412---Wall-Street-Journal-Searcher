	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- A Carolco Pictures Inc. stockholder filed
suit against the company's board, charging that Carolco's
recently announced buy-back of 3.4 million common shares from
its chairman is a "breach of fiduciary duty and an abuse of
control."
   According to the complaint, filed by stockholder
Arthur-Magna Inc. in state court here, Carolco Chairman Mario
Kassar will make a profit of about $11.5 million on the sale
and still own 57% of Carolco's shares.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The action, technically filed on Carolco's behalf as a
derivative lawsuit, charged that the agreed upon purchase
price of $13 a share, to be paid to Mr. Kassar, is $5.75 a
share higher than the closing price of the shares on the New
York Stock Exchange Monday, when the buy-back was announced.</p>
<p>The funds for the repurchase were "apparently derived"
from the sale of convertible preferred shares last June to
Canal Plus Productions and Pioneer LDCA for about $90
million, the complaint said.</p>
<p>"Thus, defendants saddled the corporation with substantial
added liability through the issuance of the preferred stock,
which was utilized primarily to fund the inequitable stock
repurchase complained of herein," the complaint said.</p>
<p>A Carolco spokesman at the entertainment concern's
headquarters in Los Angeles declined comment on the suit.</p>
