	<p class="article-leader">U.S. energy companies have contingency plans for all
mannner of oil-industry mishaps -- well blowouts, refinery
fires, even Gulf of Mexico hurricanes.
   But since Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2, U.S. companies with
workers caught in the Persian Gulf have had to grapple not
only with frozen operations and assets, but also with helping
stateside families and colleagues cope.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>And that chapter isn't in their crisis management manuals.</p>
<p>"We didn't know anything" about helping dependents,
concedes T.B. O'Brien, president of O'Brien-Goins-Simpson
Inc., whose OGE Drilling Inc. unit has six workers missing.
In 11 years of business in Kuwait, "this is the first time we
ever had this kind of thing happen," he says.</p>
<p>Baker Hughes Inc., too, admits being caught unawares.
"None of us anticipated this happening," says Phil Rice, vice
president of human resources for the oil-field service
company. Baker Hughes, like nearly all the industry, says the
government asked it not to give specifics on the Middle East
crisis. On State Department advice, a spokesman answers "two
or three" when asked how many Baker Hughes workers are being
held.</p>
<p>Companies are learning on the fly what families of
hostages need. So far, everything falls into one or another
of three categories: Families want a steady stream of
reliable information, readily available psychological
support, and assurances that salaries and benefits are
sacrosanct.</p>
<p>Such moves don't just reassure the distraught, management
consultants say. They could also stave off lawsuits and help
temper the industry's profiteering image. Wrong moves, they
warn, could make already scarce energy workers hesitant to
take future assignments in the Persian Gulf. Either way, what
companies do now will affect their businesses and reputations
long after the current crisis is over.</p>
<p>"People will be looking," says Robert Bies, associate
professor of management at Georgetown University. "This is
when the character of the company is tested" and the company
is expected to show loyalty and commitment to its workers and
their families.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean the kind of derring-do that led
billionaire H. Ross Perot to hire commandos in 1979 to rescue
two Electronic Data Systems workers held in Iran. Instead,
consultants say, companies should stick with giving
information, psychological help and financial support, no
matter how prosaic that may seem compared with Mr. Perot's
exploits.</p>
<p>Information tops the list. "Keep the families informed,"
says Donna Niehous of Toledo, Ohio. "Level with them. There's
no greater thing {companies} can do." Mrs. Niehous knows
first-hand what families of hostages need. Her husband,
William, now retired, was held by terrorists in Venezuela for
40 months in the late 1970s when he was an executive with
Owens-Illinois Co.</p>
<p>Consultants echo her advice. "Family members need to
know," says Mr. Bies of Georgetown. "They are feeling a great
deal of helplessness. The company can stem the tide from
moving into hopelessness."</p>
<p>Many companies set up 24-hour hotlines after the Iraqi
invasion. Santa Fe International Corp., a Kuwait Petroleum
Corp. unit with eight oil-field workers held in Baghdad, says
its human resource department provides information to
families and company employees. Bechtel Group Inc., the
engineering and construction giant, established a world-wide,
toll-free phone network.</p>
<p>Because companies can tell families only what they
themselves have been able to find out, some staff members may
have to be assigned to gather information from government
agencies and news sources.</p>
<p>Chevron Corp., for instance, has an employee in
Washington, D.C., who checks in with the State Department
several times a day and prepares updates for Chevron's
hotline.</p>
<p>A good communications network is the cornerstone of the
psychological support a company can provide, consultants say.
Calling the company, even when there's nothing new to learn,
can be reassuring.</p>
<p>Psychologist Harry Levinson, president of a Belmont,
Mass., management consulting firm, says company officials
should also help families with their everyday needs,
maintaining a sense of normalcy wherever possible. "They
ought to help the family adapt to whatever they might need
to," Mr. Levinson says. For instance, he says, if a hostage's
dependent is about to enroll in college, the company should
assist with those arrangements.</p>
<p>Most consultants say the go-between should be someone from
the company's employee assistance program or the human
resource department because those staff members are trained
to handle other people's problems. Nonetheless, some top
executives have taken on the role during the current Mideast
conflict.</p>
<p>Gordon Anderson, president of Santa Fe International's
drilling unit, and Joe Boyd, vice president of personnel,
flew from their Alhambra, Calif., headquarters to Texas to
reassure families after the invasion. In Fort Worth, they
rented a car and drove 75 miles to tiny Jacksboro to visit
Marjorie Walterscheid, whose husband Rainard, a Santa Fe
Drilling supervisor, was captured by Iraqis.</p>
<p>The two California executives spent an hour with Mrs.
Walterscheid and her 10-year-old daughter Raina, offering
extra financial help and their home phone numbers before
leaving to visit other families in Texas and Louisiana.</p>
<p>"They certainly didn't have to come here," Mrs.
Walterscheid says. "They did it because they care."</p>
<p>But some management experts wonder how practical it is to
have top executives make face-to-face contacts. During a
crisis, "do you put your CEO on tour?" asks Brian Jenkins, a
managing director of Kroll Associates, an international
investigative and consulting firm.</p>
<p>Emotional stress brought on by the crisis may require
hiring additional counselors and making them available around
the clock to families and employees. After one of its
chemical engineers escaped from Kuwait, Chevron had the human
resources staff member who had been working with the
engineer's family meet him at the airport. Now that he's
home, the company is offering him counseling.</p>
<p>Almost all the companies with workers in the Mideast say
they will pay the salaries and benefits of detained workers
to their dependents. Chevron and Santa Fe International are
two of several that have even offered extra financial help,
usually through salary advances.</p>
<p>Not every company has the financial wherewithal to keep
idled workers on the payroll, however. O'Brien-Goins prompted
a public outcry when it said it would have to stop paying six
missing OGE Drilling workers or risk going out of business in
months. OGE Drilling's sole business is working Kuwait oil
fields.</p>
<p>It has all been worked out now -- OGE Drilling managed one
more month's pay and medical benefits until February, and a
group of 13 energy companies and the Kuwaiti
government-in-exile agreed to pay the rest. But O'Brien-Goins
learned the hard way that, in the public's eye, even
impending bankruptcy isn't reason enough to abandon the
families of hostages.</p>
<p>The families say having the salaries and benefits
guaranteed is a heavy weight off their shoulders. "Now I can
spend my time and energy worrying about my son and my
husband," said Donnita Cole of Odessa, Texas. Her son has
been deployed to Saudi Arabia with the U.S. Army. Her
husband, an OGE Drilling employee, is a hostage in Iraq.</p>
<p>Santa Fe International, the unit of Kuwait's national oil
company, knows it has a lot to lose if experienced workers
balk at going back to Mideast jobs once the crisis is over.
That's why the company's goodwill rounds since the invasion
have included families of hostages who work for other
companies. Santa Fe officials have telephoned these families
and offered whatever assistance and information they could.</p>
<p>"We're not drawing the line," John J. Mika, vice president
of administration, says. "At times like these, you don't draw
lines."</p>
