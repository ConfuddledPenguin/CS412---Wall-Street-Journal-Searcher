	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The three major television networks are
betting that Matshushita Electric Industrial Co.'s talks to
acquire one of Hollywood's most venerable studios, MCA Inc.,
could be the final event they need to win over Washington in
the push for deregulation.
   The disclosure of the Matsushita-MCA discussions comes
just as the Federal Communications Commission weighs whether
to ease regulations that block the NBC, ABC and CBS networks
from the $3-billion-a-year syndication market. Because the
major studios are heavily involved in syndicating reruns and
first-run shows to local stations, the FCC rules all but
eliminate the networks as potential bidders for any
production company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Network officials yesterday said that any FCC action to
lift the so-called Financial Interest and Syndication Rules
would likely come too late to let the networks bid for MCA
and its Universal television and film operations. But the
possible purchase of MCA already is being brandished by
network lobbyists who are arguing that the restrictions
should be lifted.</p>
<p>The "fin-syn" rules have been left untouched for two
decades, but in the past year the networks have made major
progress in arguing for revisions -- in part by hammering the
steady encroachment on Hollywood by foreign rivals.</p>
<p>"From a policy perspective," says NBC general counsel Rick
Cotton, the MCA talks "sure ought to be a final nail in the
coffin." He adds: "The apparent discussions between MCA and
Matsushita underline the imperative for Washington policy
makers to deal urgently with getting rid of the rules and
allowing the three U.S. networks to compete in the global
marketplace."</p>
<p>The networks' major opponent in the fight over the rerun
rules, the Motion Picture Association of America, declined to
comment on the MCA discussions. But studio officials seem
likely to greet word of a Matsushita overture grimly.</p>
<p>If Matsushita ultimately is able to buy MCA, three of the
eight major studios that comprise the association will be
foreign-owned. Sony Corp. acquired Columbia Pictures
Entertainment earlier this year. Australia's News Corp. owns
the Twentieth Century Fox film studio and the Fox network.
And Pathe Communications Corp., controlled by Italian
financier Giancarlo Parretti, is trying to complete its
acquisition of MGM/UA Communications Co.</p>
<p>A Matsushita-MCA merger also would mean that over
one-third of the three networks' prime-time schedule will be
produced by foreign-owned companies, an NBC spokesman said.</p>
<p>Senators and congressmen "became more willing to let the
FCC move" on lifting the rerun rules when Sony acquired
Columbia earlier this year, says George Vradenburg, general
counsel for CBS Inc. "If Matsushita acquires MCA, it will
reinforce the view that the regulations are totally out of
date in today's world-wide marketplace."</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Vradenburg got his first crack at
capitalizing on the MCA-Matsushita ties, as he, CBS President
Laurence A. Tisch and Mr. Tisch's key political operative,
Senior Vice President Jay Kriegel, met with FCC Commissioner
James Duggan to lobby for lifting the rerun rules. The MCA
disclosure "came up obliquely," Mr. Vradenburg says.</p>
<p>Even FCC Chairman Alfred C. Sikes has pointed a finger at
the foreign incursions -- not because they should be
prohibited, but because the networks can't take the same
steps, given the rules that block them from the rerun market.
In a speech to a television trade group last week, Mr. Sikes
noted that federal law would bar NBC's owner, General
Electric Co., from acquiring a studio. "But we have no
special rules regarding the acquisition of a major studio by
a Japan-based electronics firm, such as Sony," the FCC
chairman said.</p>
<p>Mr. Sikes has said that the FCC will hold a hearing this
fall to hear all sides of the rerun debate, and that the
commission hopes to issue a ruling in the first quarter of
next year.</p>
<p>Whether Matsushita itself culminates its talks by
acquiring MCA, however, is another matter.</p>
<p>Several takeover-stock traders put the odds at only 50-50
that Matsushita will buy MCA for a price of $80 to $90 a
share. That explains why MCA shares closed yesterday at only
$54 each, up $19.50. If Matsushita actually buys MCA,
shareholders could get an additional $30 a share. If no
transaction results, MCA shares would fall $15 to $20 each,
several traders said.</p>
<p>But it seems unlikely that many U.S. companies have the
desire or the wherewithal to fund an acquisition in the $6
billion to $7 billion range that MCA and Matsushita are said
to be discussing. That is especially true given the rerun
regulations that rule out three well-heeled suitors: CBS,
NBC, and Capital Cities/ABC Inc.</p>
<p>Other U.S. movie studios might run into antitrust problems
in buying MCA. In addition, financial players, such as
leveraged buy-out firms, would find it difficult to raise the
$8 billion or more in financing that a buy-out of MCA would
require. If a buyer of MCA paid more than $90 a share, the
deal would be nearly twice the size of the proposed buy-out
of UAL Corp., which has floundered for more than a year.</p>
<p>"It would be hard to compete with a Japanese buyer as
large and as well-heeled as Matsushita," said one takeover
stock trader. "It's also hard to see somebody raising $8
billion in this market."</p>
<p>But Jessica Reif, an analyst who follows MCA for First
Boston Corp., believes it is likely that MCA will be sold,
even if the talks with Matsushita break down. The
acknowledgment by MCA that it is talking about a friendly
acquisition "seems to put a `For Sale' sign up," Ms. Reif
says. "I put it at better than 50-50 that something could get
done."</p>
