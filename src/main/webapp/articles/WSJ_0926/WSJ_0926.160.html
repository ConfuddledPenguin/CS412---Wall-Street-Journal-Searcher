	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Chemical Waste Management Inc. agreed to pay a
$3.75 million fine for pollution violations at a toxic-waste
incinerator.
   Under the agreement with the Environmental Protection
Agency, Chemical Waste admitted no wrongdoing, but dropped
its earlier opposition to the fine. The company is 77%-owned
by Waste Management Inc. of Oak Brook, Ill.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The EPA charged that Chemical Waste's incinerator on
Chicago's South Side didn't properly monitor emissions when
burning toxic polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCB's, and didn't
stop burning the compound when the pollution-monitoring
system failed. The agency additionally cited the company for
other, related violations of the Toxic Substances Control
Act, including improper record keeping.</p>
<p>The problems became known after a former company employee,
who had been terminated for unrelated reasons, informed
Chemical Waste officials in 1987 that he and others had
deliberately disconnected the monitoring devices. Such a move
would permit concealment of overloading at the incinerator.
Chemical Waste subsequently fired two managers at the
incinerator and notified the EPA of the problem.</p>
<p>In the agreement, the EPA reduced the penalty from an
proposed $4.3 million, partly in consideration of Chemical
Waste's reporting to the agency. The lowered fine also
reflects $353,000 in penalties Chemical Waste paid to state
pollution authorities for the same violations, the EPA said,
as well as the company's "current compliance with Federal
regulations and substantial improvements in its monitoring
operations."</p>
<p>A Chemical Waste spokesman stressed that the "alleged
violations" occurred in 1986 and 1987, and "resulted in no
threat to {public} health or the environment."</p>
