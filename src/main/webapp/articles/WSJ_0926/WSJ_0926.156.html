	<p class="article-leader">Kerr-McGee Corp. said its refining unit will sell its
retail properties in the Southeast, including 52 operating
service stations, and concentrate its marketing efforts on
retail properties in the Midwest and Texas.
   The Oklahoma City energy company said the 95 properties to
be sold also include 31 closed service stations and 12
undeveloped sites in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana,
Mississippi and Tennessee. The company said it will continue
its wholesale marketing operations in the Southeast.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The sale of the operating service stations in the
Southeast will reduce the number of company-operated stations
by half, a Kerr-McGee spokesman said. Another 1,700 stations
are operated by lessees under the company brand.</p>
