	<p class="article-leader">In another sign that the boom in leveraged buy-outs has
come and gone, Citibank will soon lay off 100 workers in its
leveraged-lending unit and transfer hundreds of others,
according to a senior official at the bank.
   The move, expected to take place over the next two weeks,
is the first in a series of reductions aimed at slashing $250
million to $300 million in annual expenses in the sector
serving corporations in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Other
Citibank business units in the U.S. are expected to announce
cutbacks internally over the next six to eight weeks, with
other units outside the U.S. announcing similar moves and
restructurings in the first quarter of next year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Citibank, a unit of Citicorp, has about 450 persons in its
Leveraged Capital division. The majority of those remaining
will be transferred along with their clients to existing
units that promote the full range of the bank's service, said
Todd Slotkin, a Citibank senior corporate finance executive.
Citibank has leveraged lending offices in five other U.S.
cities besides New York.</p>
<p>"The leveraged buy-out market is down about 50% this year
and the outlook is flat for another year or so," said Mr.
Slotkin, who confirmed rumors about the cutbacks. He added
that the conflict in the Mideast and further uncertainty over
the economy dashed a rebound in leveraged buy-outs this
summer. "August was almost a non-month" for leveraged
buy-outs, he said.</p>
<p>Citibank's retrenchment in leveraged lending and expected
cutbacks in other areas of corporate finance is in line with
staff reductions in those areas at other major banks and on
Wall Street. Bankers Trust cut 75 professional employees from
its 750 person professional corporate finance staff in June.
And Chemical Bank reduced staffing in those areas as part of
a 1,100 staff rollback in February.</p>
<p>On Wall Street, about 200 investment bankers specializing
in leveraged buy-outs have lost their jobs at major firms
since the first of the year, estimates Perrin Long of Lipper
Analytical Services.</p>
<p>Ironically, leveraged lending is not one of the areas
slated for cutbacks at Chase Manhattan Bank, which announced
Friday plans to reduce staff by 5,000. Chase did not build up
as large a full-time leveraged-lending staff as Citibank, and
it handles a broader mix of financing alternatives, including
infusions of equity, said Maria Beechey, head of merchant
banking at Chase. In addition, she said, "There still are a
significant number of middle market leveraged buy-outs that
are keeping us busy."</p>
<p>The cutbacks are part of a business-by-business scrutiny
at Citibank that has been underway for the past two months.
It is expected by analysts to reduce the 15,000 person staff
of the wholesale banking division for the developed world by
at least 1,000 persons.</p>
