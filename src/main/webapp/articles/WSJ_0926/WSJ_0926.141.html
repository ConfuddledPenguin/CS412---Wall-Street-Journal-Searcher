	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. agreed to pay
a $220,000 fine to settle an administrative complaint by the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission for its role in helping
a Brazilian investor violate position limits in orange-juice
futures.
   The agency said that from October 1987 to June of the next
year, Horst Happel of Sao Paolo, Brazil, an individual trader
and general manager of a Brazilian frozen concentrated
orange-juice processor allegedly traded through accounts at
Shearson. Shearson and account executive Charles Barley,
Windermere, Fla., allegedly aided and abetted Mr. Happel's
actions.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Shearson also was charged with failing to disclose
information in reports, failing to update those reports, and
filing innaccurate reports to the CFTC. Shearson agreed to
settle the charges without admitting or denying them.</p>
<p>Shearson called the CFTC allegations "highly technical in
nature," involving "no customer losses and related to
activity at only one of our branches several years ago." The
brokerage firm is a subsidiary of American Express Co., New
York.</p>
<p>Mr. Barley also agreed to settle the charges without
admission or denial, will be suspended for 30 days and must
pay a $35,000 fine. Mr. Barley's manager, Gerald Helmich,
Longwood, Fla., without admitting or denying wrongdoing,
agreed to CFTC charges of failing to supervise and won't be
allowed to supervise any brokers for 14 days.</p>
<p>Mr. Happel hasn't settled the agency's charges. His
lawyer, Howard Schneider, said Mr. Happel "doesn't think that
the CFTC is correct and he intends to vigorously defend
himself."</p>
<p>The CFTC said that Mr. Happel, through his account and
others he controlled, held far more than the maximum number
of 800 juice contracts on the Citrus Associates of the New
York Cotton Exchange for 166 days during the October to June
period. Each contract is equal to 15,000 pounds of solid
frozen juice. On some of those days, Mr. Happel's positions
exceeded the limit by 1,142 contracts, the CFTC said.</p>
<p>"Shearson knew they were all his accounts and as a member
firm should have known what the limits were," said Dennis
Klejna, the agency's enforcement director. "The positions
should have been aggregated."</p>
