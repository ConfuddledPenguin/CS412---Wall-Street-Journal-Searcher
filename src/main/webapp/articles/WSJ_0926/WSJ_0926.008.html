	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Smokers of all ages experience immediate and
substantial health benefits when they quit, the U.S. surgeon
general reported in her latest report on smoking and health.
   Twenty previous reports from the Public Health Service
have focused on the dangers of smoking, but Surgeon General
Antonia Novello said she decided to focus on the benefits of
giving up smoking in order to stress the point that "it's
never too late to quit smoking."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Persons who quit smoking before age 50 have one-half the
risk of dying in the next 15 years compared with continuing
smokers," Dr. Novello said. The risk of coronary heart
disease, the leading cause of death in the U.S., falls by
half within one year of the cessation of smoking, according
to the report.</p>
<p>Many smokers fear that they'll gain weight if they quit.
The report said, however, that weight gain averages only five
pounds, and that the risk from the additional weight is far
less than that of continuing to smoke.</p>
