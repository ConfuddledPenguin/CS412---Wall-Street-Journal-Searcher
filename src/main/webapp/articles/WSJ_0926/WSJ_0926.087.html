	<p class="article-leader">MADISON, N.J. -- Schering-Plough Corp., sitting on a cash
hoard and hoping to snatch up its shares cheaply, said it
would spend up to $1 billion to buy back its stock.
   The announcement sent Schering-Plough shares up $3.25, to
$44, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Based on that price, the company would be able to buy back
about 10% of its 226.9 million shares outstanding.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Since the steady decline of stock market prices in the
aftermath of the Middle East crisis, a number of companies
have started or extended stock repurchase programs.</p>
<p>Robert P. Luciano, chairman and chief executive officer of
Schering-Plough, said that while the company continues to
seek acquisitions and business partnerships, "we are
undertaking this share repurchase program because current
market conditions have made the stock an exceptionally good
value."</p>
<p>Indeed, Schering-Plough was trading at about $49 a share
before the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, but has steadily
declined since, reaching its low of $40.75 a share on Monday.</p>
<p>The company said it expects to purchase the shares in the
open market from time to time, depending on market
conditions. Merrill Lynch & Co. will act as exclusive broker
on the transactions, the company said.</p>
<p>Schering-Plough, by tapping into its vast pool of funds --
about $1.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments -- joins other cash-rich pharmaceutical concerns
in enhancing the market value of their stocks. In 1987, Merck
& Co. and Eli Lilly & Co. initiated $1 billion buy-back
programs.</p>
<p>"A lot of health companies have done this," said Kent
Blair, analyst with Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette. "But some
companies never followed through. They felt the stock was
cheap but when it went up the buy-backs were canceled."</p>
