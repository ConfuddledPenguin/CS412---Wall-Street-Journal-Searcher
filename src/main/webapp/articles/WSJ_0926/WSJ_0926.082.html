	<p class="article-leader">If President Bush is defeated in his confrontation with
Saddam Hussein, by now the essential test of his Presidency,
the battle will be lost not in the deserts of Arabia but in
the trading rooms of the world. Not by the Pentagon but by
the Treasury.
   It is enormously instructive that the naysayers and
putative war resisters are no longer talking much about body
bags, but instead are zeroing in on Mr. Bush's financial
Achilles' heel. Congressmen are flying off to have their
pictures taken with the troops, but are balking at forgiving
debts for Egypt or providing aid for Turkey. Anthony Lewis
invokes Professor Paul Kennedy and his decline of America
thesis, viewing the Persian Gulf defense effort as the last
gasp of a financially crippled giant.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>This is the first international crisis in which the dollar
has fallen instead of rising, Kevin Phillips and Michael
Kinsley gloat. James Webb, a respected voice on the risks of
combat, cites the experience of Anthony Eden in the Suez
crisis. The United States refused to lend him financial
reserves to defend sterling, his military campaign was
stopped in its tracks, his career was ended and the sun set
on the British Empire.</p>
<p>Now, none of this is inevitable and much of it is
nonsense. The Eisenhower-Dulles position on Suez was, along
with the coup against Ngo Dinh Diem in Vietnam, one of the
two great blunders of post-World War II foreign policy. The
rise in the U.S. tax burden has not been due to military
spending, but to welfare entitlements and special-interest
boondoggling. The answer to most of these complaints, and to
the spiraling price of oil, is to strike quickly, massively
and intelligently, and to win on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Yet a general point rings true: Wars require a serious
financial policy, not to mention a strong currency. Yet the
dollar is falling, as Lawrence Kudlow elaborates nearby,
because the U.S. Treasury more or less wants it to (see
related editorial: "Treasury's Malign Neglect of the Dollar"
-- WSJ Sept. 26, 1990). This is no way to fight a war -- or
to run an economy. Even before Saddam invaded, the economic
expansion President Bush inherited from President Reagan was
gradually eroding away. In the second quarter, yesterday's
report confirmed, it crawled at an 0.4% annual rate.</p>
<p>With the change in administrations, we have seen a policy
of optimism and growth gradually supplanted by a policy of
pessimism and austerity. Mr. Reagan was no economist, but he
wanted growth, and felt the general path was getting
government out of the way with tax cuts and deregulation. Mr.
Bush is evidently not interested in economists and their
abstruse quarrels, but has put his trust in Nick Brady's
loyalty and Dick Darman's brilliance. But with Secretary
Brady's "short-term" and Director Darman's "now-nowism," both
have enrolled as closet members of the American-decline set.</p>
<p>Thus, predominance has tipped back to an economic model
harking to "malaise." The S&Ls have sinned, so punish them
with heavy-handed regulation. Financial markets fluctuate, so
threaten them with stock-transfer taxes, and make the
Treasury's number-one priority getting hold of the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission.</p>
<p>Above all America is trapped by debt and deficits, the
model runs. The only hope is a "deal" with Congress to reduce
the deficit, thereby lowering interest rates and sparking a
recovery. So go along. Make the focus of the negotiations
"the deficit" instead of the expenditure level, which really
would mean something. Give away the President's read-my-lips
pledge. Even though you don't believe them, take the revenue
projections of the Joint Tax Committee on the effects of a
capital-gains tax cut, and therefore the effects on income
distribution; but complain when Bob Dole draws the logical
outcome of playing with this stacked deck. Beat on the Fed
for easier money; a lower dollar will help the trade deficit,
and anyway is what we deserve.</p>
<p>The lessons of the 1980s confounded this model and bared
its multiple fallacies. The U.S. has issued public debt
amounting to 50.9% of GNP, while Japan has issued public debt
for 63.8% of GNP. Britain has a budget surplus, but runs high
inflation and high interest rates. A depreciating currency
does not help a trade deficit and never has. Easy money does
not mean lower interest rates; since the Fed eased in the
summer, as Mr. Kudlow points out, Treasury bond yields have
risen to 9.16% from 8.42%. And it is feckless to believe
Congress could reach, in Fed Chairman Greenspan's phrase, a
"credible, long-term, enforceable" budget agreement.</p>
<p>The financial-political recipe for a growth policy is
quite different: Tax cuts to revive incentives, in particular
a return to the historic policy of a lower rate on capital
gains, reflecting the effect of inflation and the limitations
on deductibility of capital losses. Reform of deposit
insurance as the centerpiece of S&L (and banking) reform.
Replacing rhetoric about the deficit with an emphasis on
restraining expenditures. Keeping the no-new-taxes pledge as
the centerpiece of confrontation with Congress over budget
priorities. Monetary restraint, as Fed Governor Wayne Angell
urged yesterday, to guard against inflation. And ideally,
exchange-rate reform to preserve the dollar at purchasing
power parity with other currencies.</p>
<p>Merely to list these policies shows how far public
discussion has drifted from the tone and the direction of the
Reagan years. If growth policies had been preserved and
extended these past 20 months, we believe the nation would be
on a much sounder footing to face the financial side of
defense deployments. Others will dispute this, of course, but
the policies in place put us on the brink of recession even
without the threat of war. And if we now enter a protracted
stalemate in the Gulf -- with a frantic oil market, a
faltering dollar and the administration pushing the Fed to
inflate -- George Bush will be threatened on the financial
front just as Anthony Eden was.</p>
<p>Like his predecessor, Mr. Bush is no economist. But he is
a fighter pilot and an athlete. Surely this prepares him to
understand that you do not win wars by relying on generals
who believe in malaise.</p>
