	<p class="article-leader">SANTA MONICA, Calif. -- In the 1960s, there were protest
rallies over the Vietnam War, civil rights, farm workers and
other important issues.
   Social activism has taken a different turn in the 1990s: A
dating service organized a protest rally here against a
bank's advertising campaign.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It all started when Jeffrey Ullman, president of Great
Expectations, a large video-dating service, was driving on
the freeway behind a bus. On the back of the bus, an ad for
Santa Monica Bank said: "WE HANDLE MORE ZEROS THAN A DATING
SERVICE."</p>
<p>"I was so shocked I almost ran off the road," says Mr.
Ullman. "I got on my car phone and I called the bank. I was
offended." He was transferred to Pat Robertson, a vice
president of Team One, the advertising division of Saatchi &
Saatchi that dreamed up the line. "She laughed it off,"
recalls Mr. Ullman. "She said it was a whimsical campaign."</p>
<p>The ad agency isn't laughing now. At Mr. Ullman's protest
yesterday in front of the bank, only 21 protesters showed up,
but so did reporters and television cameras. Picketers
carried signs that said: "Santa Monica Bank thinks singles
are zeros. Reduce your balance to zero."</p>
<p>"I don't consider myself a zero," says Corinne Balzac, a
crisis counselor, who attended the rally. "I take offense at
the ads." Brian Baker, a sales engineer at the rally, said:
"The implication is that anyone who belongs to a dating
service is a zero. If I had an account at the bank, I would
close it."</p>
<p>Bank officials didn't return calls. Ms. Robertson brands
the rally a publicity stunt: "Mr. Ullman told me he was going
to seize the moment and turn this to his advantage. We
certainly didn't mean to demean any organization or person."</p>
<p>So what did the agency mean by zeros? "We all have dates,
myself included, that aren't love connections," she says. "We
were playing off the zero as a double entendre -- cash zeros
and a zero that doesn't connect in a dating sense."</p>
<p>Ms. Robertson says the bank won't buckle to protesters.
She says the monthly ad campaign will change as scheduled, on
Oct. 1, to: "MONEY DOESN'T GROW ON TREES. JUST AT OUR
BRANCHES." Past slogans included, "MONEY ISN'T EVERYTHING.
(YEAH, RIGHT.)" and "WE SELL CDS DOWN BY THE SEASHORE."</p>
