	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- The California Public Utilities
Commission disallowed $48.3 million of expenses incurred by
Southern California Edison Co. from 1985 through 1987 under a
power-purchase contract with the Kern River Cogeneration Co.
   Southern California Edison, a unit of SCEcorp in Rosemead,
Calif., "negotiated a contract that was too favorable to Kern
River Cogeneration and much less favorable" to Edison's
customers, said Commissioner Stanley Hulett. Kern River
Cogeneration is 50%-owned by an SCEcorp affiliate and 50% by
a Texaco Inc. affiliate.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Edison said it would appeal the decision, which it called
"extremely unfair and totally unjustified." Edison said it
presented testimony to the commission last year showing that
the contract is more beneficial to Edison's customers than
purchases mandated under standard contracts authorized by the
commission.</p>
<p>Edison said it was pleased that the commission "recognized
(the company) has not engaged in self-dealing with its
non-utility affiliate as claimed by the Division of Ratepayer
Advocates," an independent arm of the commission that
represents consumers.</p>
<p>The commission ordered SCEcorp to limit future
transactions with its affiliates to "standard contracts," or
to seek prior approval of any non-standard contracts.</p>
