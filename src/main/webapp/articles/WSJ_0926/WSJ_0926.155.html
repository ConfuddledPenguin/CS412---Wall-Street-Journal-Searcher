to three felony counts in connection with an alleged
money-laundering scheme involving a former official of Bear,
Stearns & Co.
   In federal court in Manhattan, Mr. Stella, 51 years old,
pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to obstruct justice
and two counts of obstructing justice. He was indicted in May
along his brother Joseph Stella, 46, formerly head of Bear
Stearns' stock-loan department, and two others. Joseph Stella
resigned from Bear Stearns in April. Bear Stearns, a unit of
Bear Stearns Cos., wasn't involved in the alleged wrongdoing.</p>

stock-loan transactions that others sought to avoid paying
taxes on. Bankers Trust is a unit of Bankers Trust New York
Corp.</p>
<p>Fred Stella, of Brooklyn, is scheduled to be sentenced
Dec. 5 by federal Judge Charles Haight. The other defendents
are to go on trial Oct. 5 before Judge Haight.</p>
