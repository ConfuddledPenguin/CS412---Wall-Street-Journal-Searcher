	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Commerce Department, reversing an
earlier determination, ruled that imports of Argentine
leather are unfairly subsidized and thus subject to
countervailing duties.
   The department said the Argentine government's prohibition
of exports of cattle hide is tantamount to a subsidy for
Argentine leather producers because the ban assures those
producers of lower hide prices than what their U.S.
competitors have to pay. This ruling supersedes an earlier
finding that Argentina didn't unfairly support its leather
producers in other ways.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The ruling authorizes the U.S. Customs Service to collect
countervailing duties of 8.02% and 24.16% on the value of
imports from Antonio Esposito S.A. and Ultrahide S.A.,
respectively. Duties of 14.97% are to be collected from other
Argentina suppliers. These duties are intended to offset the
allegedly unfair price advantage that these imports have over
comparable U.S. products. The department said the subsidy
rates represent the estimated differences between U.S. and
Argentine hide prices.</p>
<p>The ruling covers many kinds of leather, including that
made out of sheep, swine, reptile and chamois skins. The
value of all these Argentine imports last year was $143.6
million, according to the Commerce Department.</p>
<p>The department acted on a petition filed by eight U.S.
tanning companies.</p>
