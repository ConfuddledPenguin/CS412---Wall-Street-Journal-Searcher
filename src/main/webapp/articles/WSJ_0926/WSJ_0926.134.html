quarter, ended Aug. 31, rose 24% to $16.5 million, or 63
cents a share, on a 15% sales increase to $148.2 million.

footwear retailer had net income of $13.3 million, or 49
cents a share, on sales of $128.5 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Stride Rite's Keds division posted a 24% sales increase in
the quarter, partly because of increased shipments of women's
and children's leather products, which supplemented the
growth of Keds basic canvas products, the company said.</p>
<p>Third-quarter sales at Stride Rite's Children's Group rose
5% from last year's quarter, while Sperry Top-Sider sales
posted a 7% increase.</p>
