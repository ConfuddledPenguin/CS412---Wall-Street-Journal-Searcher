	<p class="article-leader">Portland General Corp. said it established an employee
stock ownership plan that will buy about $36 million of the
electric utility and energy holding company's common stock on
the open market over the next six months.
   The Portland, Ore., company's electric utility subsidiary,
Portland General Electric Co., will lend the money to the
ESOP to buy the shares. Funding for that loan will come
through either a private placement or public offering of debt
by the utility unit. Salomon Brothers Inc. is acting as
financial adviser. The ESOP will hold about 2.25 million of
the parent company's 46.3 million common shares outstanding,
Portland General said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"This plan enables us to offer our employees a benefit
package that is competitive within our industry," Ken
Harrison, chief executive officer, said. "Since an ESOP
generally promotes stock ownership among employees, this
gives employees of all Portland General's companies a
longterm stake in the corporation's success and allows them
to participate in its growth and profits."</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Portland General shares closed at $15.625, up 12.5 cents.</p>
