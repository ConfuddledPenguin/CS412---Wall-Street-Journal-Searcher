	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Chase Manhattan Corp.'s big restructuring
isn't allaying the fears of one rating concern that harder
times are ahead for the nation's second-largest banking
concern.
   Moody's Investors Service Inc. yesterday downgraded its
ratings on Chase's long-term debt and commercial paper.
Moody's cited the continued growth in Chase's nonperforming
real estate loans, the deteriorating Northeast economy and
the bank's exposure to other risky loans.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But Chase shares rose 87.5 cents, to close at $12, in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. Volume of
more than 1.7 million shares made Chase the fourth
most-active issue on the Big Board.</p>
<p>Last Friday, Chase said it will fire 5,000 employees,
provide an additional $650 million for possible loan losses,
and slash its quarterly dividend to 30 cents a share from 62
cents. Moody's said that these actions "are positive steps,"
but that it remains concerned about Chase's exposure to
commercial real estate, less-developed countries and highly
leveraged transactions.</p>
<p>Moody's said the funding and liquidity positions of both
the holding company and its Chase Manhattan Bank unit remain
sound. It also said Chase's credit standing is supported by
management's capital-building efforts and the company's
significant undervalued assets.</p>
<p>Chase said it was disappointed by Moody's actions. "Even
after the aggressive action Chase took on Sept. 21, our
capital is in excess of $11 billion and our capital ratios
exceed the government's guidelines that take effect in 1992,"
the bank said in a statement. The bank also noted that as
part of its restructuring announcement last Friday, it
indicated it expects fourth-quarter earnings to be "in excess
of $140 million." Chase said earlier that as a result of the
restructuring program, it expects to report a third-quarter
pretax loss of about $625 million.</p>
<p>Moody's lowered its ratings on Chase Manhattan's senior
debt to Baa-3 from Baa-2, subordinated debt to Ba-2 from
Baa3; preferred stock to Ba-2 from Baa-3, and commercial
paper to prime-3 from prime2.</p>
