	<p class="article-leader">HONG KONG HIRING CONTROVERSY</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A decision by the Hong Kong government to open the British
colony's labor market to Chinese nationals living overseas
has been welcomed by the local business community but has
prompted questions about the government's motives.</p>
<p>The government said it hoped that allowing Chinese
nationals to seek employment with Hong Kong companies would
help offset the steady departure of professionals from the
territory in the run-up to 1997, when Hong Kong reverts to
Chinese rule. Political observers and others outside the
government, however, said local authorities have bowed to
Beijing's demands that they allow an increased flow of
Chinese nationals into the territory.</p>
<p>Under current regulations, mainland Chinese enter the Hong
Kong labor market by only two routes: a one-way immigrant
visa, granted to 75 Chinese nationals each day; or
sponsorship by a mainland employer operating in the
territory. Under the new policy, Chinese nationals who have
lived overseas for at least the past two years may apply for
jobs with private Hong Kong companies.</p>
<p>Separately, Hong Kong Tourist Association Chairman Martin
Barrow disclaimed an earlier zero-growth forecast for 1990
tourism and predicted 8% growth instead. He cited gains in
arrivals from Southeast Asian countries and from Taiwan,
Japan and South Korea.</p>
<p>SPANISH THEME-PARK ROW</p>
<p>In a last-minute effort to salvage plans by Anheuser-Busch
Cos. to build a multimillion-dollar theme park and resort in
northeastern Spain, a top official with the Catalonian
regional government is traveling to St. Louis for direct
talks with the U.S. brewing company. The city of
Vilaseca-Salou, in which the project was to be built,
recently split into two warring municipalities, one of which
now refuses to allow the park to be built within city limits.
Anheuser-Busch last month threatened to relocate the project.</p>
<p>EAST BLOC REQUEST FOR HONDA</p>
<p>Japan's Honda Motor Co. said that state-owned motorcycle
companies in the Soviet Union and Poland have asked it to
provide technical support for their operations. Honda is
studying the feasibility of offering such support, a
spokesman said, adding that the companies are interested in
Honda's small-engine technology.</p>
<p>HELPING THE MIDEAST'S MIGRANTS</p>
<p>The International Labor Organization said it plans to send
teams to several countries with large migrant communities in
Iraq and Kuwait to assess financial losses of workers
returning home. The Geneva-based United Nations agency urged
the world to heed the plight of migrant workers in the
Persian Gulf region. Among the countries the ILO teams will
visit are Egypt and the Philippines.</p>
<p>WARNINGS FROM ARGENTINA</p>
<p>The director of Argentina's state telephone company said
Manufacturers Hanover Corp. wouldn't be given more time to
line up cash and debt papers it needs to take over a section
of Entel Oct. 8. Manufacturers Hanover Vice President Cesar
Deimonas told Radio Mitre the consortium led by the bank
hadn't formally requested an extension, and "we think we can
put together" the funds in time. Separately, Argentina's
public-works minister said that the Spanish airline Iberia
and its Argentine partner have three days to come up with a
$130 million down payment for 85% of the national carrier
Aerolineas Argentinas or lose the bid.</p>
<p>VIETNAMESE-SOUTH KOREAN LINKS</p>
<p>Vietnamese officials have proposed the opening of
Vietnamese and South Korean trade offices in Seoul and Hanoi
to help expand trade relations between the two nations. The
officials, in Seoul for a trade and investment seminar, said
foreign businesses participating in Vietnam's reconstruction
would be given tax and other benefits.</p>
<p>BRITAIN'S ANTI-POLLUTION PACKAGE</p>
<p>The British government unveiled a package designed to curb
pollution of the air, land and waters.</p>
<p>Draft legislation, promised by the ruling Conservatives
for more than two years, pledged to spend $53 billion on
environmental protection measures by the year 2000.</p>
<p>The 300-page document outlined 350 proposals for tackling
increasing pollution but contained no surprises and repeated
many prior commitments. Among those are a drive to improve
water quality and a pledge to phase out ozone-depleting gases
by 1997.</p>
<p>Environmental groups attacked the plans as "too little,
too late." But Environment Minister Chris Patten described
the paper as the "first really comprehensive statement of
government policy on the environment, ranging from the street
corner to the stratosphere."</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>A banknote denominated at one million British pounds,
printed just after World War II but no longer legal tender,
will be auctioned in London next month. The note, used by the
British Treasury as a record of the movement of money from
the Marshall Aid Fund, is expected to fetch up to $56,500. .
. . Tanzania announced the arrest of 2,500 poachers and the
seizure of 11,000 weapons and 3,000 elephant tusks in a
two-year anti-poaching campaign. Wildlife Director Costa Mlay
said most of the poachers arrested had either been fined or
sent to jail for terms ranging from five to 22 years.</p>
