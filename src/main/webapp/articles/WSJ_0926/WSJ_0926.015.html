	<p class="article-leader">DENVER -- The former chief lending officer at the failed
Silverado Banking, Savings & Loan Association suggested that
Neil Bush should have told the thrift more about his ties to
a business partner for whom he tried to arrange a line of
credit.
   However, the former lending officer, Russell Murray, said
information that Mr. Bush didn't disclose in another instance
involving the same business partner wouldn't have made any
difference in the thrift's action. In both cases, federal
regulators have criticized the actions of Mr. Bush, the
president's son.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Murray was testifying under subpoena in the first day
of the hearings on regulators' administrative charges that
Mr. Bush didn't adequately disclose conflicts of interest
while an outside director of Silverado from August 1985 to
August 1988. Denver-based Silverado was taken over by the
government in December 1988 at an expected cost to taxpayers
of $1 billion.</p>
<p>At yesterday's hearings, former Silverado Chairman Michael
Wise appeared under subpoena but asserted his Fifth Amendment
rights against self-incrimination 14 times, refusing to
answer any questions. Mr. Wise, a prominent figure in the
thrift industry during the 1980s, recruited Mr. Bush as a
director. Mr. Bush and Mr. Wise were among 12 officials of
Silverado or its holding company who were charged last week
in a separate $200 million civil lawsuit by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. alleging "gross negligence" in
operating the thrift.</p>
<p>Mr. Murray, questioned about a $900,000 line of credit Mr.
Bush sought in 1986 for an Argentinian oil and gas
exploration business of Mr. Bush and business partner Kenneth
Good, said he would have turned to Silverado's attorneys for
an opinion if he had known the full extent of the business
ties between Messrs. Bush and Good.</p>
<p>"I would have contacted counsel to determine if the
transaction would have been prohibited," Mr. Murray
testified. The administrative case brought by the Office of
Thrift Supervision maintains that the transaction would have
been prohibited because of restrictions on loans to thrift
employees.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush and his attorneys have argued that the line of
credit wasn't prohibited because the business, which was
controlled by Mr. Good, never intended to draw on it. Rather,
they say, Mr. Good wanted the promise of credit only to prove
financial strength to the government of Argentina. Though Mr.
Bush sought the line of credit from Silverado, he abstained
from voting on it and other matters involving Mr. Good, and
the line of credit was never granted, Mr. Bush and his
attorneys have noted.</p>
<p>On another matter, Mr. Murray's testimony appeared to
support Mr. Bush's case. The OTS has charged that Mr. Bush
breached his duty to Silverado by not disclosing that Mr.
Good had an option to inject $3 million into Mr. Bush's oil
company at the same time Silverado's board voted to allow Mr.
Good to pay only $3 million to Silverado to release more than
$11.5 million in collateral. Silverado lost more than $13
million on the restructured loans to Mr. Good, the government
said.</p>
<p>But Mr. Murray said that Mr. Good was in no position to
exercise that option, and that it wouldn't have made any
difference if Mr. Bush had disclosed this arrangement.
Silverado investigated Mr. Good's financial condition
thoroughly, Mr. Murray said, and "we came to the conclusion
that his ability to pay any money to anyone was suspect."</p>
<p>Testimony in the hearings is expected to last until
tomorrow. Mr. Bush, who is scheduled to be the last of 11
witnesses, didn't attend yesterday's session at the federal
courthouse here.</p>
<p>The OTS is seeking a so-called cease and desist sanction,
a light punishment that would bar Mr. Bush from breaking
conflict-of-interest regulations in the future.</p>
