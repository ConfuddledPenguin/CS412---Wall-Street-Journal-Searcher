	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- William Seidman, chairman of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp., said that he favors scaling back the
FDIC's insurance coverage for billions of dollars of pension
funds held in banks.
   Congress and the Bush administration are looking for ways
to reduce taxpayer risk in deposit insurance, following the
massive S&L bailout law passed last year. Such a proposal
also would inevitably restructure the banking industry. The
changes are likely to break down the decades-long separation
between commercial banking and investment and to allow new
freedom for banks to open branches across state lines. Mr.
Seidman, however, didn't offer a specific legislative
package.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At the same time that a consensus is forming to limit
federal insurance coverage for wealthy depositors,
multibillion dollar pension funds continue to benefit from
full deposit insurance coverage. Under current FDIC policy,
each beneficiary of the pension fund is protected up to the
$100,000 maximum coverage.</p>
<p>"The FDIC might be moving toward becoming the insurer for
the nation's pension programs," Mr. Seidman told the House
Banking Committee yesterday, calling the trend "not
attractive."</p>
<p>Most of the pension funds held in banks are in instruments
called investment contracts, which have grown from a few
hundred million dollars in 1987 to nearly $10 billion
currently, said a spokesman for Morley Capital Management
Inc. of Lake Oswego, Ore., which places the investment
contracts in banks. "Whether or not this could lead to an
exodus {of the funds} from the banks, I can't say," he said.</p>
<p>The Bush administration is expected to unveil its own
study on deposit insurance before year end and is likely to
include similar pension fund limitations, an administration
official said. "Our notion is to try to return deposit
insurance to its historical purpose, to protect small
savers," he said.</p>
<p>Before the October recess, it's likely that Congress will
pass a law permitting the FDIC to raise bank insurance
premiums above current caps in order to bolster the FDIC bank
fund, which is at a record low. The Senate Banking Committee
will hear testimony today on the Senate legislation to raise
the insurance caps. The House already has passed its version.</p>
<p>Mr. Seidman said, however, that regulators haven't yet
decided whether to raise premiums, and he warned against
using the FDIC fund as a tool to help balance the federal
budget. One recent budget proposal by Democrats hinged on $12
billion in higher bank insurance premiums as an offset for
other spending. "I wouldn't count on us as part of the budget
process to increase {the premiums} to that rate," he said.</p>
<p>Aside from raising premiums, consensus is forming around
other limitations on deposit insurance. House Banking
Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas) lauded a bill
introduced yesterday by Sen. Donald Riegle, (D., Mich.),
chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. Both chairmen want
to abandon the "too-big-to-fail" policy, in which all
depositors in large banks are protected during a failure --
even those with deposits of more than $100,000. Mr. Seidman
said the idea had "certain appeal" in reducing risk to
taxpayers but could cause instability in banking markets.</p>
<p>He also joined Messrs. Gonzalez and Riegle in leaning
toward preserving the current $100,000 limit on deposit
insurance, rather than scaling it back to a lower amount as
some in the industry have urged. Such a move would hurt small
banks disproportionately, he said, and limit their ability to
attract funds.</p>
<p>Mr. Seidman also said that banks should be restructured
sooner rather than later, urging stronger supervision, higher
capital requirements, and reduced bank investment risk. He
has proposed that banks be permitted to engage in riskier
activities only in separately financed subsidiaries. "We have
to decide what we are going to do and move ahead on it," he
said.</p>
<p>Separately, the Resolution Trust Corp., the S&L cleanup
agency, said the 247 thrifts it controls posted net losses of
$2.6 billion in the second quarter, compared with $2.2
billion in the first quarter.</p>
