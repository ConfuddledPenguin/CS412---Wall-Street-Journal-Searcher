	<p class="article-leader">Pirelli S.p.A. said consolidated profit fell 9.9% to 137
billion lire ($117.6 million) in the first half from 152
billion lire in the 1989 period.
   The key holding company of the Italian tires and cables
group predicted a similar decline in earnings for all of 1990
compared with the 320 billion lire earned in 1989.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Pirelli blamed the earnings drop in the year's opening
half on the 61% decline in profit at its Netherlands tire
division, Pirelli Tyre Holding N.V.</p>
<p>Consolidated revenue was flat at 5.272 trillion lire,
while gross earnings edged down to 280 billion lire from 285
billion lire.</p>
<p>Pirelli said that barring a "further deterioration of the
international situation" it expects 1990 revenue to be little
changed from last year's 10.342 trillion lire.</p>
<p>The company didn't make any reference to its hostile bid
last week for Continental AG of West Germany. Continental on
Monday rejected Pirelli's offer to merge its tire division
with Continental and take control of the West German tire
maker.</p>
<p>Pirelli hasn't commented on Continental's decision not to
accept the offer.</p>
