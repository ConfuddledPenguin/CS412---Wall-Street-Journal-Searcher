	<p class="article-leader">Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, Mich., said it is recalling
approximately 14,500 of its 1989-90 Aerostar minivans
equipped with "Quad" captain's chairs to replace latch
assemblies in the second-row, right-hand bucket seat. The
company said it is concerned that these seats, which are
designed to tilt forward to permit access to third-row seats,
may unlatch during severe frontal impacts. However, the
company said it is unaware of any accident in which the seat
has unlatched.
   In a second action, Ford is notifying owners of a
voluntary safety recall of approximately 18,000 of its
1989-90 L-Series heavy trucks to replace an air-brake check
valve that may malfunction and not close as intended. Ford
said it was unaware of any accidents stemming from this valve
malfunctioning.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Owners will be asked by mail to return the vehicles to
local dealers to have the work performed at no charge.</p>
