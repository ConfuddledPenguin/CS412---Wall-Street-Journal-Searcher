	<p class="article-leader">Brush Wellman Inc. said third-quarter earnings will be
"significantly less" than the 22 cents a share recorded for
the year-ago period. Sales for the quarter ending Oct. 1 will
be about 8% below year-earlier levels, the company said.
   Henry G. Piper, president and chief executive officer,
said several of Brush Wellman's markets have been hurt by
weakness in the economy and by production interruptions at
certain government facilities.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the 1989 third quarter, the Cleveland maker of
engineered materials reported net income of $3.6 million on
sales of $77.6 million.</p>
<p>The company expects seasonal improvements in the fourth
quarter, but "it is clear that second-half sales will fall
short" of 1989 levels, Mr. Piper said.</p>
