	<p class="article-leader">CAMP SHERMAN, Ore. -- On the surface, Republican Sen. Mark
Hatfield is in a commanding position as November's election
approaches. A fixture in Oregon politics who seems to mirror
the state's progressive political traditions, he holds a big
lead against a little-known challenger.
   But in a season when the breezes of antagonism against
politicians sometimes get whipped into a gale, Sen. Hatfield
suddenly is on the defensive.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>This week Oregon voters are digesting allegations that
Sen. Hatfield's longtime, Oregon-based aide, Gerald Frank,
had traveled widely at taxpayers' expense, including 52
visits in the past four years to New York, where he publishes
a guidebook on shops and restaurants. Bill Calder, Mr.
Hatfield's spokesman, says that there may be an "appearance
of impropriety" but that the public hasn't underwritten any
of the expenses for Mr. Frank's personal business trips.</p>
<p>Mr. Calder calls the allegations against Mr. Frank "a
politically inspired attack." He says that the aide's travel
was "entirely legitimate, done in an above-board way," and
that "there have been no violations of Senate rules."</p>
<p>The aide's peripatetic travel, first reported by Portland
television station KATU-TV, comes as Mr. Hatfield's
Democratic challenger, Bend businessman Harry Lonsdale, is
calling the senator a "timber beast" and a "timber pawn" --
fighting words in Oregon, where the timber industry provides
a third of the state's personal income but where concern over
environmental issues is deepening.</p>
<p>The debates over Mr. Frank and timber are being conducted
at a distance because Mr. Hatfield refuses to face his
opponent and because -- a potentially dangerous decision in a
year when politicians are being labeled out of touch -- the
senator hasn't even set foot in the state in more than three
weeks and probably won't return until Congress goes out of
session, which could be another four weeks.</p>
<p>But now Mr. Lonsdale is preparing a new offensive,
concentrating on Mr. Frank's ties to the American Federal
Savings & Loan Association, which was bailed out by the
federal government at a cost of $113 million. Mr. Frank, who
left the thrift's board before regulators stepped in, says he
didn't think Sen. Hatfield knew he was involved with the S&L
-- whose board once included GOP Rep. Denny Smith of Oregon,
now considered vulnerable.</p>
<p>The result is that Mr. Hatfield, who is holding a
two-to-one lead in the polls, is emerging as the classic
example of a popular candidate who could become the victim of
an anti-incumbency backlash. Already Massachusetts Democrats
selected John Silber, a symbol of protest against the
political establishment, as their gubernatorial nominee,
while Oklahoma voters approved a measure to limit legislators
to 12 years in office.</p>
<p>For months Mr. Lonsdale has been building support by
tapping into resentment about how the state, a sylvan empire
that provides a fifth of the nation's softwood and forest
products, has been scarred by the vast patches of
clear-cutting that are visible from precipices in the Mount
Hood National Forest and in the Willamette National Forest.</p>
<p>A political neophyte who can grow dewy-eyed over a Pacific
silver fir tree, Mr. Lonsdale, 58 years old, has never voted
against Sen. Hatfield. But now he's taking on not only Mr.
Hatfield, one of the ponderosa pines of politics, but also
Oregon's timber industry, the keystone of the state's
economy. At the center of his campaign is his proposal to ban
log exports from private lands.</p>
<p>Mr. Lonsdale is calculating that he's more than a voice
crying out in the wilderness of the rugged Deschutes National
Forest here in central Oregon. He's arguing that prohibiting
the log trade with Japan is the answer to the state's
economic challenges and the way to protect the towering
700-year-old trees that give the state its character and
identity.</p>
<p>It might work. "There's this instinctual feeling that
people don't want these logs exported," says K. Norman
Johnson, a forest economist at Oregon State University.</p>
<p>In a state that is agonizing over the fate of the
endangered northern spotted owl and the 20,000 jobs it may
cost to preserve its ancient-forest habitat of heavy tree
canopies and its prey of woodrats and flying squirrels, the
complex economics of the log trade has become part of the
argot of politics.</p>
<p>Although the Japanese can buy finished lumber products
cheaper than they can buy Oregon's raw logs, they purchase
the logs to keep their own workers employed. What's more,
they're willing to pay a premium price for them; last year
Japanese timber importers seeking Douglas fir, the coveted
giant conifers that can have diameters as big as 16 feet,
paid an average wholesale price of $604 per thousand board
feet -- more than double the domestic U.S. price of $263.50.</p>
<p>Mr. Lonsdale's plan is to end these exports, thereby
limiting the timber cuts. Then, to ensure that the state's
logs provide jobs for Oregonians rather than Japanese, he'd
switch the emphasis of the timber industry from cutting and
exporting logs to manufacturing modular homes, wooden doors,
window frames and other lumber products.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield, chary of banning log exports and interfering
with private property rights, wants to use economic
incentives -- a 15% capital-gains tax break for timber
companies -- to keep logs onshore. "They'll cut less because
they'll have an economic incentive to do different things,"
he says in an interview in Washington. "The result will be
more jobs."</p>
<p>Mr. Lonsdale's initiative, made in a setting where
business looks naturally to the Pacific, is itself something
of a gamble. Portland is one of the principal unloading
points for Japanese automobiles and a major export point for
grain and flour along with timber products. A Japanese
semiconductor plant employs 475 workers in Gresham, just east
of Portland. Oregon, moreover, has run a trade surplus with
Japan for the past two years.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield says his opposition to the Lonsdale plan is
consistent with his philosophy of "balance" in the forests
that cover nearly half the state. "The middle ground is where
the people are," he says. "The extremists get the simple
slogans -- `ban log exports' -- but there's more to this
question than chanting slogans."</p>
<p>But the senator is drawing unusually strong enmity from
environmentalists, some of whom have chained themselves to a
tree outside his Portland office, and from his rival's
campaign, which is charging that Mr. Frank's ownership of
timber stock raises important ethical questions. Mr. Calder,
the Hatfield spokesman, says the stock issue is "outrageous"
and an indicator of how "desperate" the Lonsdale camp is.</p>
<p>His critics argue that Mr. Hatfield, the powerful ranking
Republican on the Senate Appropriations Committee, pushes for
higher timber-cutting targets than the Forest Service and the
Bureau of Land Management request. "He's the single most
serious threat to the environment we have here, the biggest
devastator of the forest," argues James Monteith, executive
director of the Oregon Natural Resources Council.</p>
<p>Such jarring language is incongruous in a state known for
its tidy politics, especially when the invective is directed
at Mr. Hatfield, former two-term governor who has held public
office for four decades and who would, if he wins a fifth
Senate term this autumn, become the longest-serving senator
in the state's history.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield, 68, has made a career of blazing his own
political trail, seldom suffering when he wanders off into
the wilderness. He was the only dissenter in a National
Governors' Association resolution supporting Lyndon Johnson
during the early days of the Vietnam War and later lent his
name to the McGovern-Hatfield Amendment to end the war. He
attacked the Nixon administration for practicing the
"politics of revulsion" and was skeptical of many Reagan
administration initiatives.</p>
<p>Deeply religious, Sen. Hatfield presided over the Reagan
defense buildup as appropriations chairman when the GOP
controlled the Senate, but, because of his commitment to
peace, he never voted for a defense authorization bill. Today
he opposes abortion, breaking with Oregon voters, who support
abortion rights by large margins. "People in Oregon
understand this," he says. "They thought I was wrong on
Vietnam then and some think I'm wrong on abortion. But they
know my pattern."</p>
<p>Today he sticks to his own path despite cries from
newspaper editorialists that he should debate Mr. Lonsdale.
"He's arrogant, above it all -- St. Mark, the senator from
Heaven," Mr. Lonsdale says in frustration. The question about
Mr. Frank's travel records hadn't appeared through
yesterday's editions of the the state's biggest newspaper,
the Portland Oregonian, where the aide writes a nonpolitical
column.</p>
<p>"I have knowledge of my opponent of course," Mr. Hatfield
says. "But I don't mention him by name, and I don't lambaste
him. That's my style. I consider a campaign a time to talk
about my record and my involvement in the life of Oregon. Why
should I talk about my opponent?"</p>
