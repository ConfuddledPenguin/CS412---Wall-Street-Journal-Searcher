	<p class="article-leader">The tourists were getting restless. In fact, they were
getting downright hostile.
   Here they stood, wilting in the 100-degree Florida heat on
a day dripping with importance for MCA Inc. The company's
touted, $650 million Universal Studios Florida in Orlando was
having its opening, and several major rides didn't even work.
The earth wasn't quaking, King Kong wasn't bellowing, and the
shark from "Jaws" wasn't snapping at pontoon boats, at least
not on cue.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>One band of sweaty malcontents, having paid full-price $29
admission, charged up to the assembled TV cameras, thrust
down their thumbs, and shouted, "We're going to Disney
World]"</p>
<p>This was not a high-water mark for public relations, and
MCA's chairman, Lew Wasserman, and its president, Sidney J.
Sheinberg, weren't pleased. But they had pushed too hard,
opening the park in June before it really was ready.</p>
<p>After years of indecision about creating the theme park,
and after a decade of missed opportunities, MCA had become
obsessed with proving itself capable of competing throughout
the world with Walt Disney Co., Time Warner Inc., Sony Corp.,
and News Corp.'s Fox. Yet it may have clung so long to its
traditional Hollywood ways that the only means of achieving
this goal was to be merged or acquired.</p>
<p>Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. fills the bill: its
familiar brands are marketed world-wide and include
Panasonic, Quasar, Technics and National. Reacting to a
report in yesterday's Wall Street Journal, MCA announced that
it is talking with a major international company about a
buy-out.</p>
<p>People knowledgeable about the talks say the takeover
price could range from $80 to $90 a share, or about $7.4
billion to $8.3 billion. In New York Stock Exchange composite
trading yesterday MCA shares soared $19.50, to close at $54.</p>
<p>People close to the situation say that MCA was in merger
discussions with Paramount Communications Inc. several weeks
ago, but that talks broke off because executives of the two
companies couldn't come to terms on sharing control.
Paramount declines comment but is said to be worried about
its existing joint ventures with MCA, notably the USA cable
network and the international film distributor U.I.P.</p>
<p>It is far from certain that a Matsushita acquisition of
MCA will ever take place. But MCA appears to be "in play,"
and other bidding scenarios are possible. One of Matsushita's
appeals for MCA is that it's among the few companies so
wealthy it wouldn't have to spin off assets to support the
acquisition.</p>
<p>The only required sale would be the
U.S.-government-mandated divestiture of MCA's New York-area
TV station WWOR, which Disney and many others would love to
get their hands on. The merged company also could spin off
the TV station to MCA shareholders. However the Matsushita
talks turn out, a hostile takeover of MCA isn't likely
because Mr. Wasserman controls much of the company.</p>
<p>An acquisition by Matsushita might leave MCA's management
intact. That was an issue -- and a stumbling block -- in
other talks over the years. A merger would give MCA new
international heft and more financial resources.</p>
<p>But would MCA stay MCA, with all its current corporate
quirks? The botched opening and continued operational
problems at Universal Studios Florida raise questions about
whether a merged MCA would continue to pay for the missteps
of the past. And they lead observers to wonder whether the
corporate culture that served the company well in its early
years -- tough, arrogant, inflexible, and, above all,
conservative -- is right for the '90s.</p>
<p>"Life is filled with missed opportunities," a
philosophical Mr. Sheinberg said Monday. "I prefer to look
forward. There's a lot ahead of us that looks optimistic, and
I'm generally pessimistic about most things." He wouldn't
comment about merger plans.</p>
<p>Even before there was word of the Matsushita talks, change
was afoot in the Black Tower, MCA's cold, black glass world
headquarters in Universal City, just over a hill from Los
Angeles. It was exemplified by Mr. Sheinberg's recent
acquisition of Geffen Records for 12.5% of MCA's stock, worth
about $540 million. The deal, which takes effect at year-end,
demonstrated that the 77-year-old Mr. Wasserman finally had
passed leadership of MCA to Mr. Sheinberg, who is likely to
stay on should Matsushita actually acquire MCA.</p>
<p>"The Geffen deal was Sid's decision," says investment
manager Mario Gabelli, who controls 4% of MCA's stock. "You
don't make a decision about 10 million shares unless you're
running the company."</p>
<p>The changes at MCA aren't entirely self-generated. The
company needed a nudge, and it came last year in the form of
the multibillion-dollar merger of Time Inc. and Warner
Communications Inc. "We're a 200-pound gorilla in a game with
1,000-pound gorillas," Mr. Wasserman told one MCA
shareholder. "We've got to become a 1,000-pound gorilla, or
get out of the game."</p>
<p>MCA has been at the game a long time. In Hollywood, where
marquees are continually changing, Mr. Wasserman and Mr.
Sheinberg, who is 55, have been the longest-running show in
town. Mr. Wasserman, who with the late Jules Stein built MCA
from a tiny band-booking agency that had its beginnings in
the Chicago of the 1920s, is still treated like a Roman
senator at industry functions. Mr. Sheinberg has been Mr.
Wasserman's head of operations since 1973. The two still make
the nostalgic trip to Chicago every year for the company's
annual meeting.</p>
<p>Every day Mr. Wasserman and Mr. Sheinberg put on their
dark suits and ties and drive to their grim Black Tower. A
bust of Mr. Stein, who died in 1980, stands guard over the
elevator bank. He amassed warehouses of English antiques over
the years, and the building still groans with the collection.
Even the hippest, high-tech movie executives must toil amid
the hulking sideboards and horse-and-hound prints, which
suffice as office furnishings while others in Hollywood are
forever redecorating.</p>
<p>MCA itself had become a bit musty and creaky. In a
changing world, MCA suddenly found itself no longer a
market-leading behemoth but a relatively small player. And
Mr. Wasserman, many observers felt, had become rather too
preoccupied with holding onto what he had built. He avoids
the press and declined to be interviewed for this story. But
the beauty of the Matsushita deal, individuals close to the
situation say, is that MCA can expand internationally without
needing equity partners, and shareholders can be rewarded
without breaking up the company or sending its management
packing.</p>
<p>From its Prohibition-era start, MCA grew into a major
talent agency. It represented actor Ronald Reagan, among
others, in the '50s. Late in the decade it expanded into
movie and television production by buying Universal Studios,
which at the time was best known for "B" movies and horror
films. Universal eventually became a major supplier of
network TV shows, which generated cash to compensate for the
bumpy fortunes of the movie division. They have indeed been
bumpy. On the one hand, Mr. Sheinberg took on an unknown
director named Steven Spielberg, who went on to produce for
Universal the highest-grossing film of all time, "E.T. The
Extra-Terrestrial," released in 1982. But the studio also
passed up the opportunity to produce the 1981 movie "Raiders
of the Lost Ark." It put out the disastrous "Howard the
Duck."</p>
<p>MCA, meanwhile, proved itself resistant to change. It
bitterly fought Sony Corp.'s introduction of the Betamax home
video recorder. A venture to market a competing videodisk
system that could play back but not record failed to
electrify consumers. And Mr. Sheinberg rancorously opposed
the growing power of pay-cable TV services such as Home Box
Office, now a Time Warner operation.</p>
<p>At least twice in the past decade, MCA came close to
merging with other entertainment companies, once with the
then-independent RCA Corp., and later with Walt Disney Co.
shortly before the current management team took over at
Disney in 1984. Both times, questions arose about who would
control the merged entity -- questions that turned out to be
insurmountable, executives say.</p>
<p>MCA seems to be trying to make up for lost time. In the
past year or so, it has divested itself of its troubled LJN
toy unit; it has taken charge of its ailing 49%-owned
Cineplex Odeon theater chain; and it has opened one, at least
temporarily troubled, theme park. (It is planning to build
two more parks, near Paris or London and in Japan.) MCA broke
with tradition to handsomely reward (with millions of dollars
in stock options) Thomas P. Pollock, the architect of its
movie division's newfound success, and it is finally about to
start developing a long neglected asset, 200 acres of
Universal City real estate at the junction of two Los Angeles
freeways.</p>
<p>Yet Mr. Wasserman only reluctantly assented to Mr.
Sheinberg's strongly argued desire to buy WWOR-TV for $387
million. The station, based in Secaucus, N.J., serves the New
York market. He put a stop to plans to buy a big stake in
Hasbro Inc., the now struggling toy-industry giant. MCA
executives stood idly by watching Fox Inc. start a TV
network, something MCA might have attempted but didn't.</p>
<p>MCA itself is primarily responsible for current problems
with its Florida studio tour, a vaster version of the
company's successful California attraction. Theme park chief
Jay Stein (no relation to Jules) recommended as early as 1969
that a Florida park be built, and MCA acquired land in
Central Florida with that in mind. But Mr. Wasserman, ever
gloomy about looming recessions and reluctant to take on
debt, insisted on more research and a partner with whom to
share the risk. Meanwhile, Disney opened Walt Disney World in
1971, EPCOT Center in 1982 and, finally, Disney-MGM Studios
last year. Little wonder that every time Mr. Stein is
interviewed, his vitriol about Disney bubbles up. A sample
comment re: Walt Disney World -- "Ask the kids. It's a
rip-off]"</p>
<p>Although Mr. Stein's candor can seem refreshing compared
to Disney's happy-faced facade, some MCA executives contend
privately that his combativeness hurts MCA. Others say it was
arrogance that led the company to open in Orlando before the
park was ready -- and then to charge visitors full price.
Executives in Orlando apparently kept assuring the Black
Tower in L.A. that attractions would be operational
"tomorrow." Mr. Stein says he was misled by the rides'
designers. "We bought a lemon."</p>
<p>Despite the negative publicity, analysts believe the park
will be profitable in the long run for MCA and the British
partner it ultimately found, Rank Organisation PLC.</p>
<p>MCA's style clearly flows from Mr. Sheinberg. A lanky
Texas attorney, he has a hot temper and a legendary
proclivity to sue people. "At MCA, litigation is a profit
center," he once boasted. In an industry in which moguls can
be at one another's throats in court then dine together as
old friends, Mr. Sheinberg takes things personally. He
resigned from the board of the American Film Institute when
it accepted a contribution from Sony during MCA's bitter
battle seeking to block home video technology as a copyright
violation.</p>
<p>While Disney executives carefully avoid knocking MCA in
public, Mr. Sheinberg growled once that Disney was a
"ravenous rat" and accused his competitor of stealing MCA's
theme-park ideas. Disney responds subtly. In worshipful
issues of Variety and the Hollywood Reporter honoring
Universal's 50th Anniversary this year, every major studio
but one bought ads.</p>
<p>Mr. Sheinberg's frequent outbursts may also may have
contributed to Universal's failure to license its 1989 slate
of films to pay-cable networks, which are a vital source of
revenue for major studios.</p>
<p>"I'm sick and tired of the process of trying to license
these films to pay cable," Mr. Sheinberg groused during
negotiations earlier this year, calling HBO and Viacom Inc.'s
Showtime "a monopoly." He threatened to take the films
directly to the commercial networks, and, in April, he did
sign a precedent-setting deal with CBS Inc. It was a creative
solution, but MCA undoubtedly left millions of dollars on the
table.</p>
<p>Mr. Sheinberg also has conceded that he is attracted to
executives who can be as ornery as he is. That trait has led
directly to multimillion-dollar losses from MCA's investment
in Cineplex Odeon, the Toronto company that operates the
largest theater chain in North America.</p>
<p>Mr. Sheinberg looks visibly pained when the subject is
broached. He was drawn to Cineplex's brash young founder
Garth Drabinsky, and saw him not just as a protege but almost
as a son. Yet Mr. Drabinsky hatched a plot to take over
Cineplex. It failed, and he was ousted last December, leaving
behind about $600 million in debt. MCA is still picking up
the pieces.</p>
<p>"We found ourselves in a nightmare," says Mr. Sheinberg,
who at the last minute canceled an MCA table at a charity
fundraiser for Mr. Drabinsky last year, even though he was
co-chairman of the event. "I'm a victim of Garth Drabinsky's
charms. I'm a big boy, and I have nobody to blame but
myself." Mr. Drabinsky declines to comment.</p>
<p>TV production, where MCA had been king, has fallen from
past heights. When the bottom dropped out of the TV
syndication market for hourlong dramas several years ago, MCA
fell hardest. How could a company create a hot cultural
phenomenon like "Miami Vice" -- and wind up losing money when
it went to sell the show to local stations for reruns? Mr.
Sheinberg blamed the networks for not paying their share of
production costs.</p>
<p>Some in the syndication business were glad to see it
happen. At the annual National Association of Television
Programming Executives convention, for example, MCA had for
years refused to set up shop on the exhibition floor.
Instead, station managers would be summoned to a hotel suite
for an audience with MCA program sales people. Now humbled,
MCA is down on the floor. Never known for its sense of humor,
the TV division is still trying to become a presence in the
more lucrative business of producing half-hour comedy shows.</p>
<p>Change still comes slowly to MCA. When Mr. Pollock joined
as president of the motion picture group in 1987, he couldn't
understand why Universal, alone among studios, insisted on
"firm terms" when it rented films to theaters, refusing to
adjust the percentage of ticket sales it keeps according to
how much business the film does.</p>
<p>"Lew made it clear: How else do you know where you stand?"
says a now-converted Mr. Pollock. But the practice works well
only when films are in demand. During this past crowded
summer, Universal's "The Jetsons" didn't appear in some
cities at all because the studio's terms were too tough.</p>
<p>Mr. Wasserman has also been obstinate about compensation.
While Disney and Warner executives were making millions on
stock options and incentive profit-sharing, MCA executives
made relatively little.</p>
<p>Former records chief Irving Azoff left for an affiliation
with Warner because MCA wouldn't offer him a piece of the
action even though he had taken the division from a loss of
$8 million to operating profits of $60 million in five years.
Mr. Azoff was also frustrated because MCA wouldn't let him
buy Motown Records for $61 million (it's worth much more now)
or a significant stake in Polygram Records at a bargain
price. "I was a little too entrepreneurial for them," says
Mr. Azoff, "and they were a little too conservative for me."</p>
<p>The lesson of Mr. Azoff's departure had some effect. MCA
soon broke precedent by offering Mr. Pollock stock options
valued at about $7.8 million as a reward for turning the film
division around. And the huge Geffen deal was done in less
than a week.</p>
<p>Such happenings give longtime observers confidence that
MCA is on the move again. And the backing of Matsushita, with
annual sales of $44 billion in fiscal 1990, would give MCA
tremendous financial clout. "The company seems to be
energized, and it's becoming more opportunistic," says New
York investment banker Roy Furman. "They're not as deliberate
as they once were."</p>
<p>MCA is even slowly changing its button-down style. Over
the hill from the Tower, in a funky office on the Sunset
Strip, five long-hairs in motorcycle jackets float through
the waiting room. Upstairs, a slender man in a T-shirt, jeans
and sneakers talks on the telephone as papers lie at his
feet. There is no desk. "Yes, Michael, I love you, too," he
says soothingly and hangs up.</p>
<p>Who was that? "Michael Jackson," casually answers David
Geffen, 47, now MCA's largest stockholder. With his vast
network of contacts, Mr. Geffen is already undermining the
imperious, steely image of the company.</p>
<p>Mr. Jackson himself is rumored to be thinking of taking
his recording career to MCA/Geffen. Similar rumors abound
about Bruce Springsteen.</p>
<p>If Mr. Geffen knows everyone in the music business, his
Hollywood equal may be Mr. Pollock, 47, a onetime
entertainment industry lawyer who has pushed through
innovative deals MCA once would have resisted. Strong on
relationships but cost-conscious to a fault, he has indulged
the desire of box-office draw Arnold Schwarzenegger to do
light comedy roles that cost less to produce than action
films do. The successful Schwarzenegger film "Twins" will be
followed by "Kindergarten Cop." Controversial filmmaker Spike
Lee has also found a home at MCA.</p>
<p>Messrs. Geffen and Pollock are joined on an operational
level by less-visible Charles "Skip" Paul, 41, a former Atari
Inc. executive who, as president of MCA Enterprises, has been
the troubleshooter on Cineplex Odeon, the toy company
divestiture and international theme park plans.</p>
<p>Even without a Matsushita takeover, there are some wild
cards in MCA's future. While the company itself hasn't been
charged with any wrongdoing, both its record and its home
video division have been entangled in business deals with
reputed mobsters in recent years. The longtime president of
its Home Entertainment Group was dismissed last year after
accusations were made, based on FBI wiretap affidavits, that
he associated with organized crime figures.</p>
<p>"I hope my grandchildren don't come home from kindergarten
and say someone said the mob has infiltrated MCA," responds
Mr. Sheinberg. "Does anybody really think that?"</p>
<p>Mr. Sheinberg has long been coy about impending alliances
or mergers. After reporters rushed to a Los Angeles hotel
catering to Japanese businessmen last year on reports that
Sony was in discussions to buy MCA, an amused Mr. Sheinberg
showed up at an industry banquet sporting a Sony button and
told the audience that if coming Universal films weren't big
hits, "expect to see me selling closed-out Walkmans on some
street corner next year."</p>
<p>Before the news of the Matsushita talks, he said MCA is
like an eligible young woman whom lots of people want to
date. "We're going to go to some dances," Mr. Sheinberg
added. "We may even get married."</p>
