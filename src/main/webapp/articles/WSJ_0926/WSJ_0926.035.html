	<p class="article-leader">Bell Communications Research Inc. is expected to introduce
today a low-cost device that can help prevent electrical
fires in homes, businesses and major computer centers.
   The device detects fires involving polyvinyl chloride, a
common cable insulation material used in the electrical
wiring for nearly all homes and businesses. Polyvinyl
chloride, or PVC, also commonly is used in telephone
switching offices and data centers, covering the connectors
between personal computers and large mainframe computer
systems.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The purpose of the device is to detect a fire very early
on," explains Glen Neuburger, who invented the fire detector
for Bell Communications, also known as Bellcore. With
PVC-related fires, Mr. Neuburger says, "a few minutes can
mean the difference between a minor, localized event and one
that can cause widespread damage to remote equipment."</p>
<p>In June 1988, a fire involving PVC gutted a two-story
Illinois Bell Telephone Co. building in the Chicago suburb of
Hinsdale, Ill. The fire crippled key elements of the
company's central switching office and fiber-optic network.
It also knocked out service for about 35,000 customers.</p>
<p>Bellcore's zinc-based device works by "sensing" a PVC fire
in its initial stage, reacting chemically to the presence of
hydrogen chloride gas. The gas, emitted when PVC overheats or
burns, is extremely corrosive and destructive to electronic
equipment. It also can cause severe irritation to workers'
throat and lungs.</p>
<p>Other sensors detect fires by "seeing" the smoke, using
light scattering technologies, or by "feeling" the heat,
using thermal sensing devices. Accordingly, in fires that
don't involve PVC, the Bellcore device wouldn't trigger an
alarm. The device "isn't meant to replace fire detectors,"
says Mr. Neuburger, "but to work in conjunction with them."</p>
<p>Bellcore, the research arm for the seven regional Bell
companies, is banned from manufacturing such devices itself.
That restriction is part of the consent decree that broke up
the Bell System in 1984.</p>
<p>Instead, Bellcore licenses its technology. Several of the
regional Bells have expressed interest in the product.
BellSouth Corp. has been testing the device in its switching
offices in Kentucky.</p>
<p>The device is expected to cost about the same as
conventional smoke detectors used in office buildings today.</p>
<p>As its active sensing element, Bellcore's fire detector
uses an inexpensive quartz crystal coated with zinc and
activated by electrical current. The crystal is calibrated to
vibrate at a certain frequency. The sensor is attached to a
palm-sized computer that monitors frequency changes.</p>
<p>Zinc is one of the prominent metal finishes used in
telecommunications equipment. When hydrogen chloride gas is
present, zinc corrodes and forms zinc chloride, which rapidly
absorbs water from the air. The added water weight and zinc
residue on the crystal combine to alter the frequency and set
off an alarm before smoke and flames erupt.</p>
<p>Other devices that detect hydrogen chloride gas cost
several thousand dollars each. Among the makers are
Pyrotronics, Fenwal Inc. and Simplex Time Recorder Co. Most
of these products are used mainly in factories where hydrogen
chloride can be released inadvertently.</p>
