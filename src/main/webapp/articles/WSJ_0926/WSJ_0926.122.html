	<p class="article-leader">Paramount Pictures Corp., in a move that has been rumored
for weeks, named David Kirkpatrick, 39 years old, as the
president of its motion picture group's production
operations.
   He succeeds Sidney Ganis, 50, who entered into an
exclusive long-term agreement yesterday to develop and
produce motion pictures for Paramount.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Kirkpatrick left Walt Disney Co. in July to become an
executive vice president of the motion picture group at
Paramount, where he had previously worked. Prior to his
tenure of more than a year at Disney, Mr. Kirkpatrick had
left Paramount to be president of the motion picture group of
Weintraub Entertainment Group for two years.</p>
<p>Mr. Ganis and Mr. Kirkpatrick couldn't be reached for
comment. Frank Mancuso, the chairman of Paramount, a unit of
Paramount Communications Inc., also couldn't be reached. Mr.
Ganis's independent production agreement is a typical
arrangement when a top executive is replaced at a movie
company.</p>
<p>The change is widely viewed in Hollywood as a move by
Paramount to bolster its future performance at the box office
and to allay concerns that it is too heavily focused on
marketing and distribution and not enough on creative
development, production and talent relationships. Although
Paramount has the current box office hit, "Ghost," it has
been disappointed by the results of other recent films such
as "Days of Thunder," and "The Two Jakes."</p>
<p>Mr. Ganis joined Paramount in 1986 as head of marketing
and was named co-president of the motion picture group in
1988, responsible for production. The move raised eyebrows at
the time because Mr. Ganis had no previous experience in the
creative side of movie production, and didn't bring any
strong relationships with talent to the job.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Ganis is widely liked and considered a
talented marketing strategist, he was unable to develop the
combination of talent relationships and tough negotiation
skills necessary to succeed at overseeing the studio's annual
production slate and dealing with often-difficult
negotiations over movie production issues, Hollywood
executives said.</p>
<p>Mr. Kirkpatrick has never run a big studio's movie
operations either, but he has spent most of his career on the
production side of the business, and is known for cultivating
good talent relationships with producers, directors, writers
and actors. For example, he has a strong relationship with
Eddie Murphy, who is in the midst of renegotiating his
exclusive contract with Paramount, and one of the reasons he
was brought back was to help repair the rifts in that
relationship.</p>
<p>"David has great expertise in talent relationships, and he
has strong creative production capabilities," said Jerry
Bruckheimer, who along with partner Don Simpson has an
exclusive production agreement at Paramount that has included
movies such as "Beverly Hills Cop II," "Top Gun" and "Days of
Thunder." Mr. Bruckheimer added, "He's been a great executive
to work with and he brings many years of expertise to the
job."</p>
<p>Still pending against Mr. Kirkpatrick is a suit filed by
Disney charging that when he left Disney for Paramount, he
took another executive and a film project with him, in
violation of a contract. Mr. Kirkpatrick's attorney said the
suit was without merit. Ironically, Paramount sued Weintraub
and Mr. Kirkpatrick when he originally left the studio to
take the Weintraub post. The suit was finally settled.</p>
