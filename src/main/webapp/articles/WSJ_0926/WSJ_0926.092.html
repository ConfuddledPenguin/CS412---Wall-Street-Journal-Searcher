	<p class="article-leader">ENVIROSOURCE Inc. (Stamford, Conn.) -- Moody's Investors
Service Inc. said it lowered its ratings on long-term debt
and preferred stock of this environmental services company,
citing the company's weak operating performance. Moody's
dropped the ratings on the company's 14% extendible reset
notes due 1998, and its class G $7.25 cumulative convertible
preferred, to Caa from single-B-3. About $160 million of
long-term debt is affected.

	<div class="article-body"><p>SUPERMARKETS GENERAL HOLDINGS Corp. (Woodbridge, N.J.) --
Standard & Poor's Corp. said it lowered its ratings on about
$700 million of subordinated debt of the grocery store and
retailing concern to triple-C-plus from single-B-minus. S&P
said the downgrade reflects "lower-than-anticipated sales and
subsequent weak cash generating ability." S&P said the
company, which was taken private in a management buy-out in
1987, "continues to be highly leveraged, and interest expense
places a substantial call on cash flow."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>UJB FINANCIAL Corp.'s rating on its preferred stock was
cut to Ba-2 from Baa-3 and its commercial paper to not prime
from prime-3 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. The
credit-rating company's downgrading affects $250 million of
securities for the Princeton, N.J., holding parent of United
Jersey Bank. The rating action reflects "continuing
deterioration in the credit quality of UJB's real estate loan
portfolio, which will likely require substantially higher
levels of reserves, and lead to more significant
charge-offs," Moody's said.</p>
