	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Michael Milken's lawyers urged a federal judge
to view Mr. Milken's crimes as aberrations in an otherwise
exemplary life and to sentence him to perform full-time
community service with inner city youths in Los Angeles.
   Meanwhile, prosecutors prepared to release a barrage of
new allegations painting Mr. Milken as a white-collar
criminal of major proportions, in its effort to get a stiff
prison sentence for the former king of junk bonds.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The conflicting views about the former Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. official appear in sentencing memoranda prepared
by the two sides. Mr. Milken's memorandum was made public
yesterday. The government's memorandum is expected to be
released today.</p>
<p>Mr. Milken is scheduled to be sentenced next Monday by
U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood for six trading-related crimes
to which he pleaded guilty last April. Mr. Milken admitted to
one count each of conspiracy, filing a false statement with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, securities fraud,
aiding and abetting net-capital violations, mail fraud and
assisting the filing of a false tax return. He faces a
maximum of 28 years in prison.</p>
<p>The pre-sentencing memos have taken on great importance,
because the government is alleging that Mr. Milken committed
numerous securities-related crimes -- including insider
trading -- beyond those included in his plea bargain. And
prosecutors are urging Judge Wood to consider these further
allegations against Mr. Milken as reasons to dole out what
they have called a "substantial" prison sentence.</p>
<p>People named in the government's memo had sought to keep
the additional unproved allegations sealed, but, at the
request of news organizations, Judge Wood ordered them to be
made public, with the names of people who had not been
charged with crimes blacked out.</p>
<p>Judging from Mr. Milken's reply memoranda, the
prosecutors' memo accuses Mr. Milken of systematically
engaging in criminal behavior throughout much of the 1980s,
working in concert with convicted former stock speculator
Ivan F. Boesky and a host of other clients. The government
also accused Mr. Milken of being a "greedy" individual who
depended on corrupt dealings to enhance Drexel's market share
and his own compensation, which reached $550 million in 1987.</p>
<p>Lawyers for Mr. Milken took issue with the government's
entire memorandum, saying that it was "written without regard
to legal or factual constraint, seemingly to appeal to the
public and to pressure the Court" to issue a stringent
sentence. Mr. Milken's attorneys contested each allegation
that went beyond the six charges to which he pleaded guilty.
And they accused the government of "sneaking in through the
back door" evidence of offenses that Mr. Milken has "never
acknowledged and has never committed."</p>
<p>Although many details in the government's sentencing memo
have already come to light in the SEC complaint filed against
Mr. Milken and others in 1988 and in the 90-count indictment
of Mr. Milken filed in March 1989, the government presented
some new allegations in its sentencing memo, according to Mr.
Milken's reply.</p>
<p>Among other charges, the government said in its memo that
Mr. Milken built Drexel's business and achieved personal
financial rewards through insider trading.</p>
<p>Mr. Milken didn't plead guilty to any insider
trading-related charge. But in its memo, the government
presents four instances of alleged insider trading from which
it said Drexel benefited, involving securities of Caesars
World Inc., Viacom Inc., Republic Airlines and Lorimar Inc.
In each of these transactions, the government alleges that
Mr. Milken directed Drexel traders to trade on the basis of
material nonpublic information that Mr. Milken possessed as a
result of his role as a financial adviser to companies
pondering mergers.</p>
<p>The government also claimed that Mr. Milken provided
"tips" and "advice," as well as illegal payoffs, to certain
money managers and others who were among Drexel's best
clients.</p>
<p>Names of these individuals were blacked out in Mr.
Milken's memo. But according to people with knowledge of the
government's investigation, those who received allegedly
illegal payoffs include former money manager David Solomon;
former First Investors Management Co. junk-bond portfolio
manager Ben Bayse; and Thomas Spiegel, former chief of
Columbia Savings & Loan Association.</p>
<p>Mr. Solomon, who has received immunity from prosecution,
is cooperating with the government. Mr. Bayse left First
Investors last year, and the firm's lawyer has said First
Investors funds weren't in any way "harmed" by Mr. Bayse's
activities; the lawyer has declined to elaborate. Attorneys
for Columbia and Mr. Spiegel have acknowledged that the firm
is under investigation and have denied wrongdoing.</p>
<p>According to the government, Mr. Milken offered personal
investment opportunities to favored customers in exchange for
their promises to purchase securities from Drexel. In one of
these transactions, the government alleges that Mr. Milken
improperly gave certain money managers and corporate
executives an opportunity to invest in Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts & Co.'s 1985 acquisition of Storer Communications
Inc.</p>
<p>In a previously reported allegation, Mr. Milken encouraged
these money managers to buy risky securities by allowing them
to buy equity warrants at relatively cheap prices. The
warrants were held in a Drexel-organized partnership known as
"MacPherson."</p>
<p>According to the Milken reply memo, the government also
details a number of crimes that it said Mr. Milken committed
with Mr. Boesky, beyond the three Boesky-related offenses to
which Mr. Milken pleaded. And the government provides
additional evidence about Mr. Milken's dealings with Columbia
Savings & Loan, without referring to the thrift by its name.
The government alleges that Mr. Milken helped the Beverly
Hills, Calif., S&L obtain tax benefits by purchasing
securities from Columbia, with the understanding that those
securities would later be sold back at a pre-arranged time
and price.</p>
<p>Finally, according to Mr. Milken's memo, the government
says that Mr. Milken had obstructed justice by ordering the
destruction of documents after Mr. Boesky agreed to plead
guilty to securities fraud in November 1986.</p>
<p>Regarding the specific allegations, Mr. Milken's attorneys
say the insider-trading allegations are refuted by documents
and testimony that the government has in its possession. In
three of the cases, the attorneys say, "Mr. Milken did not
discuss the trades" with his traders.</p>
<p>Mr. Milken never tipped favored customers about deals
either, his attorneys contend. Instead, they say, he merely
provided investment advice to money managers who requested
it. Mr. Milken's lawyers also disagree with the government's
position on MacPherson.</p>
<p>They say that Mr. Milken didn't have to bribe money
managers to purchase the risky securities; these securities,
they say, were valuable and highly profitable. Mr. Milken's
lawyers say the warrants sold to money managers were
"speculative" investments and had nothing to do with these
managers' agreement to buy risky securities.</p>
<p>Moreover, Mr. Milken's attorneys say their client had been
given approval by Drexel to establish MacPherson and to own
Storer warrants. In a series of interviews, however, senior
Drexel executives have denied that any such approval was ever
granted and have indicated that they had no knowledge of the
fund managers and other executives' participation in
MacPherson.</p>
<p>Mr. Milken's lawyers also take issue with the government
concerning the payment of $5.3 million to Drexel by Mr.
Boesky. Both the government and other Drexel officials have
alleged that the payment was made to turn over to Drexel its
gains in a series of illegal trades, in which Mr. Boesky held
stock for Drexel with the understanding that it would be sold
back at a later date.</p>
<p>In their sentencing memo, Mr. Milken's lawyers argue that
the $5.3 million was a payment for "services rendered," a
theory that Drexel rejected after its own guilty plea in
1988. They also deny that Mr. Milken directed anyone to
destroy documents.</p>
<p>The second prong of Mr. Milken's argument seeking a
lenient sentence focuses on his character and good works. His
lawyers' memo relies heavily on more than 170 letters that
have been sent to Judge Wood by Mr. Milken's friends, family
and associates. Quoted extensively are letters by New York
takeover attorney Joseph Flom; Steven Ross, chairman of Time
Warner Inc.; and Daryl Gates, the Los Angeles chief of
police, among others.</p>
<p>According to the memo, the letters "paint a portrait of .
. . a person of great conscience, compassion and charity who
has always been generous with his time, money and spirit."</p>
<p>Mr. Milken, his lawyers say, possessed "unusual talents
and compassion" at an early age. By the first grade, he could
perform complicated multiplications in his head. After
school, he tutored fellow students in math. And "as a
schoolboy, Michael organized numerous school charity drives
and volunteered his time, services and modest allowance money
to an array of local charities."</p>
<p>This work and charity ethic has continued throughout his
later life, his lawyers say.</p>
