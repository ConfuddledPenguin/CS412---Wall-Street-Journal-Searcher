	<p class="article-leader">Donald Trump's bankers are expected to demand today that
he slash salaries and institute layoffs at the Trump Shuttle
in exchange for keeping control of the airline.
   The demands come on the heels of disclosures that Mr.
Trump won't be able to make interest payments on the $245
million in unsecured shuttle debt he is required to make
under last month's $65 million bank bailout. Mr. Trump
borrowed $380 million to purchase the airline from Eastern
Airlines in 1989 and has already missed a $1.1 million
interest payment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"You've heard about what happened at the New York Post?"
asked one banker, referring to the 20% salary cut employees
of that paper agreed to recently. "Well Trump can do the same
thing."</p>
<p>Mr. Trump couldn't be reached to comment.</p>
<p>About 20 of Mr. Trump's creditors who hold pieces of the
$245 million loan plan to meet with Mr. Trump at the offices
of the law firm of Weil Gotshal & Manges, which has
represented Citibank throughout the Trump restructuring
talks. The Citicorp unit was the lead lender for the $245
million unsecured loan, as well as an additional $135 million
Trump Shuttle equity loan. The bank subsequently sold off
most of its shuttle debt, and now is believed to hold only
about 15% of the unsecured debt.</p>
<p>Citibank has emerged as a conciliatory force in
negotiations with other Trump lenders, largely because it has
the most to lose in the event Mr. Trump cedes control of his
assets. As part of the bailout, Citibank received second and
third mortgages on many Trump assets; should he lose them to
other creditors, Citibank's chances of recovering its losses
would be greatly diminished. Including the shuttle, Citibank
lent Mr. Trump a total of $1.1 billion.</p>
<p>Some of the shuttle lending group, which includes Fuji
Bank, Bank of Tokyo, Natwest, and Bank of America, were
startled to hear about Mr. Trump's restructuring plans last
week, only weeks after Mr. Trump personally assured them the
debts would continue to be paid.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, America West Airline's plans to purchase both
new planes and the Pan Am Shuttle, which competes with the
Trump Shuttle, are believed by bankers to be another setback
for Mr. Trump. If it closes on its purchase of the Pan Am
Shuttle, America West will most likely be able to use its
Boeing 737s for the shuttle, which are more modern than the
727s used by both Pan Am and the Trump Shuttle.</p>
