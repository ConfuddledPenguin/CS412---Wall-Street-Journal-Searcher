	<p class="article-leader">MORGANTOWN, W.Va. -- Natalie Tennant raises her
muzzle-loading rifle into the air, races onto the West
Virginia University football field and pulls the trigger. The
blast jolts her, but the real kick comes next: Booing
cascades from the student cheering section in the upper deck,
and front-row fans taunt, "Go back to the kitchen] No
Mountaineer can have PMS]"
   Ms. Tennant, a 22-year-old senior, is the university's
Mountaineer mascot this year -- the first woman ever. Some
people want her to become the first to be targeted in a
recall election.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>West Virginians have revered the buckskin-clad Mountaineer
mascot of the university as the embodiment of the state's
macho frontier past. Many students and alumni are mortified
that the pride of West Virginia now uses eyeliner instead of
after-shave.</p>
<p>Angry football fans have thrown paper cups and ice at Ms.
Tennant during games. Others have circulated petitions
demanding her ouster and passed out bumper stickers and
buttons that read: "We Don't Want a Mountain-dear. Give us
back our Mountaineer."</p>
<p>Other places don't seem to have this problem. Harvard
hasn't even figured out what a Crimson looks like, much less
what its gender is. Nobody cares whether there's a woman
under the Princeton Tiger-skin. Notre Dame's Leprechaun has
always been male, although who would know the difference if
it wasn't?</p>
<p>The difference could become an issue elsewhere, of course
-- just as it has here. Sitting in the stadium's lower deck
during the Maryland game, Jim Bartley, a Morgantown
advertising man, boos as Ms. Tennant passes by. "Should the
Florida State Seminole be a squaw?" he asks. "Should the USC
Trojan be a maid? Should the Texas Longhorn be a milk cow?
For 60 years," he adds, "we've had nothing but total support
for the Mountaineer, and now she's divided the state."</p>
<p>Huffs Derek Farley, who graduated from the university two
years ago, "If finding sanctuary in a 100-year tradition is
sexist, then you can tattoo it on my chest."</p>
<p>Ms. Tennant has her supporters. Stores here are selling
sweatshirts emblazoned with a striking dark-haired woman
dressed like Daniel Boone. The campus newspaper has rallied
behind Ms. Tennant with glowing editorials. Many alumni,
particularly women, call out encouragement when they see her.
"Keep it up, Natalie]" yells a woman at a pre-game tailgate
party. "I've got four daughters, and you're a pace-setter]"</p>
<p>University officials have expressed dismay over Ms.
Tennant's treatment. "I thought we were more sophisticated
than this," says Gordon Thorn, the school's assistant vice
president for student affairs. "It's discouraging, and it
says we have a long way to go before we can handle this kind
of question."</p>
<p>Ms. Tennant, a journalism major who was raised on a West
Virginia farm, shows a steely indifference toward her
opponents. The abuse is directed toward the idea of a female
Mountaineer, she says, not toward herself as a person. "It
keeps me humble and gives me more drive," she says of the
opposition.</p>
<p>During the game, she scurries through the stands of the
60,000-seat stadium, slaps hands with fans and has her
picture taken with children. A small blond-haired boy runs up
to her, hands her a quarter and says, "Call me."</p>
<p>The mascot mess began in the spring, after a student club
selected Ms. Tennant and a male aspirant as finalists in a
competition to become mascot. At a basketball game "cheer
off," thousands of students baited Ms. Tennant, raucously
informing her that she wasn't anatomically fit to be
Mountaineer. To almost everyone's surprise, the club selected
her anyway.</p>
<p>The next day, the campus statue of the rifle-holding,
knife-toting Mountaineer was wearing women's underwear.
School officials later sprayed the statue with lubricant to
keep it from being painted.</p>
<p>Some students and alumni want the entire, 22,000-person
student body to elect a new mascot. They say West Virginia's
mountaineer iconography is ample proof that the mascot was
never meant to wear skirts and pantyhose. Whether on the
state seal or a corporate logo, they say, the moutaineer is
almost always depicted as a virile white male.</p>
<p>The university mascot not only attends athletic events and
parades but also gives speeches at high schools, 4-H Club
meetings, Bible-study classes and pig roasts.</p>
<p>Many students say that about three-quarters of the student
body, including many women, don't think Ms. Tennant should be
the mascot. Some attribute this to tradition; others, sexism.
There's concern that male students will try to take her gun
at the football games.</p>
<p>"Some men just hate women," says Dawn Miller, managing
editor of the Daily Athenaeum, the campus newspaper.</p>
<p>Says Ms. Tennant: "I'm the first female mascot at West
Virginia University, but there were female mountaineers long
before me, like our grandmothers."</p>
<p>When humans dress up as tigers, panthers or even, as at
Syracuse University, oranges, they rarely display obvious sex
characteristics. But there's never been any doubt about the
gender of the Mountaineer, who dresses in tight-fitting
buckskin with coonskin cap and moccasins. Ms. Tennant's
critics fault her for not having a beard, for being too short
(5 feet, 3 1/2 inches), and for not yelling loud enough.
Because of her size, she can't carry the state flag at games;
it would scrape the ground.</p>
<p>After the Maryland game, an exhausted Ms. Tennant's
lace-trimmed suit is streaked with sweat. Her cheeks are
sunburned, her hands are smeared with gunpowder and her
pinkie finger sports a bruise from shooting the rifle.</p>
<p>"You shot the gun too late]" yells a student from the
stands, sunglasses draped around his neck. He also complains
that she didn't wave the state flag and didn't come up to the
student section. He recommends that Ms. Tennant study last
year's mascot from game films.</p>
<p>Yet her enthusiasm for the mascot-ship has won over some
of West Virginia's crustiest males. This past summer,
attending a pig roast in coal-mining Boone County, she was
told to avoid a 70-year-old resident called "Ol' Buster."
Instead, she marched right up to him, extended her hand and
said, "I hear you're my biggest fan."</p>
<p>"The hell I am]" Buster snorted, refusing to shake it.</p>
<p>But Ms. Tennant persisted. She had her rifle; and Buster
also carried a muzzle-loader. Bonded by gunpowder, the two of
them went to an abandoned field to blast away. "Buster" --
Mosie Atkins -- was won over. Today he offers her his
ultimate compliment for her tomboyish toughness. "Hell, she's
worse than a damn boy]" he says in admiration.</p>
