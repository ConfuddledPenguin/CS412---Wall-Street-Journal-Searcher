	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Japan's oil imports in August rose 10.9% from a
year earlier, to 122.7 million barrels, according to a
preliminary report from the Ministry of International Trade
and Industry.
   Imports were up 16.3% from July because of increasing
demand and seasonal refining factors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mideast sources accounted for 86.7 million barrels, 70.7%
of the total and up 7.8% from a year earlier. Imports from
Southeast Asia grew 17.4%, to 21.2 million barrels.</p>
<p>The oil from the Mideast was purchased before Iraq's Aug.
2 invasion of Kuwait, and thus wasn't affected by Japan's
embargo on purchases of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil.</p>
<p>Some of the Southeast Asian oil was purchased after the
embargo, explaining part of that increase.</p>
