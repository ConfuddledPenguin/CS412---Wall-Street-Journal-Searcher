	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Short interest among over-the-counter stocks,
both large and small, rebounded in the month ended in
mid-September after easing in August.
   Short interest among larger OTC stocks gained 4.5%, while
short interest among smaller shares rose 6.5%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Rouse Co., a Columbia, Md., real estate developer, led the
issues with the largest increase in short interest. On Aug.
24, President Michael Spear died in an airplane crash.
Mathias J. DeVito, chairman and chief executive officer,
assumed Mr. Spear's duties as president. Short interest in
Rouse rose more than 1.1 million shares to 3.3 million.</p>
<p>Short interest in troubled Oracle Systems jumped 93.7% to
more than two million shares. Shares of the Redwood City,
Calif., software maker plummeted this summer amid signs that
its fast-paced growth had slowed. Oracle, which laid off 10%
of its work force last week, yesterday reported a loss for
the first quarter, ended Aug. 31, of 27 cents a share,
compared with net income of nine cents a share a year
earlier.</p>
<p>Short interest jumped in three health care-related stocks:
SciMed Life Systems, St. Jude Medical and Healthcare
Services. Among technology companies, Software Toolworks and
Adobe Systems both turned up large increases in short
interest. Among financial institutions, Sunwest Financial
Services and BayBanks posted large boosts in short interest.</p>
<p>First Executive, the Los Angeles life insurance company
that once held a large portfolio of junk bonds, continued to
hang on to its lead as the stock with the largest short
position with 8.5 million shares sold short.</p>
<p>Traders who sell short borrow stock and sell it, betting
that the stock's price will decline and that they can buy the
shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender.</p>
<p>Short interest is the number of shares that haven't yet
been purchased for return to lenders. Although a substantial
short position reflects heavy speculation that a stock's
price will decline, some investors consider an increase in
short interest bullish because the borrowed shares eventually
must be bought back.</p>
<p>And some short interest doesn't reflect any opinion on the
stock at all but shows up as part of another strategy, such
as arbitrage or dividend capture.</p>
<p>The National Association of Securities Dealers Inc., the
self-regulatory agency that operates the Nasdaq computerized
system on which more than 4,300 OTC issues trade, compiles
short interest data in two categories: the approximately
two-thirds, and generally biggest, Nasdaq stocks that trade
on the National Market System; and the other, generally
smaller stocks that don't.</p>
<p>The NASD reported that short interest in 2,320 National
Market System securities as of mid-September totaled
266,883,329 shares, up from 255,404,934 shares among 2,319
NMS issues for August.</p>
<p>Short interest in 1,217 other smaller issues totaled
39,176,536 shares for September, compared with 36,799,476
shares in 1,215 issues in August.</p>
<p>The National Market System's short-interest ratio at
mid-September rose to 2.93 from 2.19 a month earlier, while
the short-interest ratio for other OTC issues climbed to 1.42
from 1.04 a month earlier.</p>
<p>The ratio -- the number of trading days at the market's
average daily trading volume that would be required to
convert the total short interest position -- is a measure of
negative trader sentiment. Some analysts suggest, however,
that the ratio has weakened in value as an indicator because
options and other products can be used to hedge short
positions.</p>
