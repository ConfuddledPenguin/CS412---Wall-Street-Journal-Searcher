	<p class="article-leader">Smokers trying to quit shouldn't try to chew nicotine gum
and drink coffee or soda at the same time.
   Addiction researchers said a laboratory experiment with
eight longtime smokers showed that coffee and cola-type soft
drinks will prevent the absorption of nicotine from the
nicotine chewing gum, thus defeating the use of the gum as an
aid to breaking the cigarette habit. The gum is sold in the
U.S. under the brand name Nicorette by Marion-Merrell Dow
Pharmaceuticals Inc., a subsidiary of Dow Chemical Co.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The researchers said many smokers may fail to quit smoking
because they inadvertently render the nicotine gum
ineffective by consuming slightly acidic food and drinks at
the same time they chew the gum. The drinks increase the
acidity of the saliva and change the gum's nicotine into a
non-absorbable form, researchers said. They suggested that
other foods and drinks, including beer, tomato juice and
various fruit juices, are also acidic enough to defeat the
purpose of the gum.</p>
<p>It is difficult enough for smokers to get an effective
dose of nicotine from the chewing gum even under the best of
conditions, a research team from the federal National
Institute of Drug Abuse and the University of Kentucky said
in this week's Journal of the American Medical Association.</p>
<p>The Nicorette gum sold in the U.S. contains two milligrams
of nicotine per stick, or cube, of gum. But even if the
patient chews the gum precisely according to instructions, he
or she will absorb only 0.8 to 0.9 milligrams of nicotine per
stick, which is slightly less than that which is absorbed
from a cigarette with a moderate amount of nicotine.</p>
<p>Interviews with nicotine gum users found that many of
those who failed to get an adequate dose of nicotine from the
gum drank coffee, fruit juices or soft drinks as they chewed
gum, Jack E. Henningfield of the NIDA's Addiction Research
Center in Baltimore and his colleagues said.</p>
<p>To see if these acidic beverages were affecting absorption
of nicotine, they enlisted eight adult smokers who agreed to
sit in the lab for three hours, submitting to blood tests,
chewing nicotine gum and rinsing their mouths with coffee, a
cola or distilled water at precise intervals. The nicotine
gum used was a version sold in the U.K. and Canada by the
Swedish drug maker, Pharmacia AB; this version contains four
milligrams of nicotine, twice the dosage of the U.S. brand of
Nicorette.</p>
<p>Whenever the volunteers rinsed with distilled water, or
did a simulated rinse with their own saliva while chewing the
high-strength gum, nicotine levels in their blood rose
sharply within five minutes and stayed up for at least 15
minutes. But whenever they rinsed with coffee or the cola,
there was only an insignificant rise in blood nicotine
levels.</p>
