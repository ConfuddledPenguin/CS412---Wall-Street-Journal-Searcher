	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The British publisher Robert Maxwell said he
is organizing a $250 million venture-capital fund to make
equity and related investments in emerging businesses in
Eastern Europe.
   Mr. Maxwell, chairman and chief executive officer of
Maxwell Communication Corp., said that he will commit $52
million to the fund, and that New York-based Merrill Lynch &
Co., which is handling the private placement, will commit $5
million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Maxwell said he is having "serious discussions" about
possible investments in Eastern Europe. In Moscow, for
example, he said, "We have been offered a major building that
needs completing" for use by Western companies that can pay
rent in foreign currency. And he said, "Newsprint mills in
certain European countries need modernization, and are
willing to pay in newsprint. There's clearly a demand for
newsprint."</p>
<p>Mr. Maxwell said he will be the general partner of the
fund, which will provide not only investments but "know-how"
to Eastern European ventures in which the fund takes a
minority stake. He said he hopes the fund will "get off the
ground in the next few weeks."</p>
<p>He called the $250 million sum "a beginning. Obviously, if
we are successful, it could go substantially bigger. They in
Eastern Europe need to privatize all their firms in order to
join the free-market economy."</p>
