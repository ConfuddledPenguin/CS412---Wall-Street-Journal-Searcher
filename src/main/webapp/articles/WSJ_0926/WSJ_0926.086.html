	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- Carlo De Benedetti's French holding company,
Cerus S.A., agreed to shed about a third of its 14.4% stake
in Societe Generale de Belgique S.A.
   The move, in which 4.8% of the company will be sold, will
leave Cerus with less than 10% of Generale's shares, a
reminder of its failed 1988 takeover bid for the Belgian
holding company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Cerus will exchange the shares for stock in Cie.
Financiere de Suez, the French banking group that came to
Generale's rescue against Mr. De Benedetti, an Italian
financier, two years ago. Cerus also will acquire small
stakes in some Suez allies as part of the exchange, Paris
financial sources said.</p>
<p>Mr. De Benedetti won't take a cash loss, even though the
shares are down almost 40% from what he paid. Yesterday, on
the Brussels Bourse, Generale shares fell 50 Belgian francs
($1.56) to 2,125 francs ($66.40). In 1988, Cerus paid an
average of 3,500 francs a share.</p>
<p>Detailed terms of the swap weren't available. But at
current share prices, a 5% stake in Generale is valued at
about 6.8 billion francs.</p>
<p>Today's agreement will leave Mr. De Benedetti holding
Generale paper which he will still want to sell, analysts
said.</p>
<p>Before the transaction, Cerus had slightly under 3% in
Suez, while Suez had about 4% in Cerus and a further 10% in
Mr. De Benedetti's Italian parent company, Cofide.</p>
<p>Cerus will stop consolidating Generale's earnings in its
group accounts and will cause an earnings drop.</p>
<p>Last year, Generale accounted for almost one-third of
Cerus's 1.24 billion French franc ($238 million) net profit.</p>
