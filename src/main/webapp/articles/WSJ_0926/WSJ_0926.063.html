	<p class="article-leader">We see where California's Senator Alan Cranston has rushed
forward to attract news coverage as the first Member of the
Senate to announce his intention to vote against David
Souter's Supreme Court nomination; Mr. Souter didn't sign the
necessary blood oaths on behalf of abortions. Surely there is
something more appropriate Senator Cranston can do with his
political capital. Why not help bail out Charlie Keating, the
S&L impresario, now languishing in a California jail for want
of $5 million bail. In the process of seeking senatorial
intervention with the thrift regulators, Mr. Keating
contributed nearly $1 million to Mr. Cranston's
voter-registration operation. With Mr. Keating now pleading
poverty, perhaps Senator Cranston could disgorge some of the
earlier distributions to help poor Charlie make bail.</p>
