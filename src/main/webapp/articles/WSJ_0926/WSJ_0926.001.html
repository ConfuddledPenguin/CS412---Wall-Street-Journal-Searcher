	<p class="article-leader">The Navy plans to buy $300,000 of crucial AV-8B Harrier
jet parts from Northrop Corp., even though the division that
makes the parts has been suspended from Pentagon contracting
for falsifying test data on the program.
   "A procurement system in which the Navy is forced to
obtain parts from a corporate criminal is intolerable," said
Rep. John Conyers (D., Mich.), chairman of the House
Government Operations subcommittee on legislation and
national security, which held a hearing on the matter
yesterday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Navy maintained that suspending the waiver is required
to keep the Harrier fleet flying. Already, four of the jets
have been taken out of service because of a shortage of
replacement parts, and 18 could be down within a year if the
parts aren't available, the subcommittee was told. Some of
the Pentagon's 200 Harriers are being flown by the Marines in
the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>The Defense Department is not out "to cheat the
taxpayers," Col. James Hart, program manager on the AV-8B,
assured lawmakers. But without a qualified second source,
Northrop is the only short-term supplier of the spares, and
going elsewhere could take as long as two years and cost more
than $1 million, he said.</p>
<p>The officer alleged that "Northrop has cheated all of us,
but most of all the young Marines" who require their aircraft
to perform flawlessly. There is no doubt, he said, that "the
reliability of the system would have been improved" had
Northrop conducted tests properly.</p>
<p>A Northrop spokesman in Los Angeles reiterated that the
company has fired the employees who falsified testing, and
that the parts now meet all specifications. "People are
trying to smear the whole corporation for the acts of a
handful of people," the spokesman added.</p>
<p>The devices in question, known as rate sensor assemblies,
are used in systems that help stabilize the vertical-takeoff
Harriers, especially while hovering. The parts -- "vital to
safety of flight," according to an internal Navy memo -- have
lasted an average 999 flight hours instead of the 1,525 hours
intended.</p>
<p>Last February, Northrop pleaded guilty to falsifying test
results on the Harrier program. One test completely omitted,
according to subcommittee investigators, was for
life-expectancy of the devices.</p>
<p>An angry Rep. Conyers complained that going back to
Northrop for more parts "looks like business as usual" for
the company, and he vowed to press Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney to "personally ensure that Northrop does not make a
dime off this forced procurement."</p>
<p>Asked about this, the Northrop spokesman countered: "If
you get a contract, you ought to make a profit on it."</p>
<p>Subcommittee members also were exasperated that Northrop
declined to testify yesterday. "It goes without saying that
until Northrop is prepared to be forthcoming. . . . I will be
reluctant to support any payment of U.S. taxpayer dollars to
this contractor," fumed Rep. Frank Horton (R., N.Y.).</p>
<p>Lawmakers also said that McDonnell Douglas Corp., the
AV-8B prime contractor, and Honeywell Inc., maker of the
system containing the sensor assemblies, didn't cooperate.</p>
<p>The Air Force also was supposed to address the hearing on
the reliability of the nuclear-tipped cruise missile, which
contains a Northrop-built guidance unit identified as having
problems operating in subzero weather. But Jack Jones, an Air
Force engineering supervisor, appeared with only a short
statement saying the guidance unit hadn't ever caused an
operational test-flight failure. This, however, is
contradicted by documentation previously disclosed by this
newspaper.</p>
<p>Rep. Conyers ordered Mr. Jones to appear at another
hearing to be held soon, and to be better prepared. "He
thought he'd come out here and stonewall us," Rep. Conyers
asserted, adding: "There was no point in even taking his
testimony because it amounted to nothing."</p>

<p>Corrections & Amplifications</p>
<p>AN AIR FORCE engineering supervisor's statement before a
House subcommittee -- that a Northrop Corp. cruise missile
guidance component hasn't ever caused an operational
test-flight failure -- was contradicted by documentation
previously disclosed in The Wall Street Journal. Because of a
typographical error in yesterday's edition, the contradictory
nature of the statement wasn't indicated.</p>
