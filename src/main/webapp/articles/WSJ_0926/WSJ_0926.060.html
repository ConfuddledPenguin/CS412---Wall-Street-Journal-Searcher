	<p class="article-leader">Philadelphia -- At a time when most museums are
preoccupied with broad and exhaustive -- and frequently
exhausting -- blockbuster shows, small and focused temporary
exhibitions are as welcome as they are rare. A good case in
point is the lovely little show that the Philadelphia Museum
of Art has built around a picture from its own collection,
Pierre-Auguste Renoir's "The Great Bathers," which the artist
worked on between 1884 and 1887. This popular painting is one
of Renoir's largest and most striking depictions of female
nudes. It also is a painting that gave him a good deal of
trouble and that marked an important turning point in his
art.
   For the occasion, the museum has regrouped its own fine
Renoir collection and augmented it with a number of works
borrowed from other museums and private collectors --
including some 25 preparatory studies for "The Great
Bathers." This condensed overview of the artist's work not
only provides a good deal of pleasure but also says a lot
about the particular historical and psychological context in
which "The Great Bathers" was done. The inclusion of both his
fluidly lyrical early pictures and of his late monumental
nudes allows us to see where he was coming from when he
painted "The Great Bathers," and where he eventually ended
up.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The exhibition makes it clear that despite its typical
Renoir subject -- buxom young women cavorting in an
unblemished landscape -- "The Great Bathers" is stylistically
one of the artist's most unusual paintings.</p>
<p>The two largest figures are more artificially posed than
is normal in Renoir's work and there are considerable
technical differences in the rendering of the figures, the
water and the trees. The women are crisply drawn and smoothly
modeled, in a manner distinctly at odds with the more freely
brushed impressionistic rendering of the landscape, and the
stylized and somewhat stilted composition contains strong
echoes of the old masters. Moreover, the laborious
preparatory studies that Renoir did for the picture, and his
repeated reworking of the figures, also were departures from
the usual impressionist practice of working quickly and
spontaneously.</p>
<p>Renoir's attempt to distance himself from impressionism in
this picture was quite deliberate. In fact, like many other
avant-garde artists in the mid-1880s, he was plagued by
doubts about the insubstantiality of the impressionist style
and was seeking a more solid and more classical approach to
painting.</p>
<p>One of the most striking moments in the show is the
installation on one wall of three paintings of nudes that
clearly show how Renoir's thinking developed in the decade
before he painted "The Great Bathers." The first is "Nude in
Sunlight" of 1875, a voluptuous figure that is nearly
engulfed by the dappled light and luxuriant vegetation that
surround her. In "Blonde Bather" of 1881, by contrast, the
light is more even and the figure is more clearly detached
from the surrounding landscape.</p>
<p>In "Seated Bather" of 1883-84, the drawing of the figure
is decidedly more linear and the landscape functions merely
as a kind of decorative backdrop, indicating Renoir's growing
uneasiness about strict impressionist practice.</p>
<p>This uncertainty about impressionism took a rather
particular turn, for it led him to question his general
ability as an artist. "I had wrung impressionism dry," he
later said, "and I finally came to the conclusion that I knew
neither how to paint or draw." (To which some might say,
"Well, it was about time he realized that." For Renoir is
doubtless the most uneven of the major impressionists, and
occasionally his drawing and modeling are almost unbelievably
inept.) Leaving aside the ironic truth contained in the
hyperbolic rhetoric of his complaint, during the mid-1880s
Renoir was intensely anxious about how he stood up to the old
masters. In a sense, "The Great Bathers" can be seen as a
kind of test of his abilities.</p>
<p>Just how assiduously Renoir worked at trying to get this
picture right -- and "to beat Raphael," as he told a friend
-- is clear from the great variety of the studies that he did
for it. These range in size and style from large, broadly
worked compositional sketches to small pencil drawings that
are as tightly rendered as an Ingres. Throughout the studies,
you sense a tension between impulsiveness and a will to
discipline, between a letting-go and a reining-in.</p>
<p>This unresolved split shines through the final painting,
which is at once both sensual and cool, energetic and oddly
stiff. In fact, if "The Great Bathers" is a masterpiece, it
attains that status in large part because of its flaws and
inconsistencies, which give our experience of it a grittiness
that it might not otherwise have had.</p>
<p>"The Great Bathers," moreover, seems to have intensified
Renoir's interest in the kind of sculptural form that emerges
in his best late paintings. In a nice touch, the last gallery
also contains some of the sculptures that Renoir did during
the last decade of his life, in collaboration with the
youthful Richard Guino, who obviously provided the arthritic
artist with more than just a sensitive pair of hands.</p>
<p>Also in this gallery is the superb "Bather" that Renoir
painted around 1905, one of the best of his late pictures of
nudes. Here monumentality, sensuality and sheer painterly
skill are combined and harmonized with a mastery only hinted
at in "The Great Bathers."</p>
<p>The exhibition will be on view until Nov. 25. It is
accompanied by an informative special issue of the museum's
Bulletin, written by curator Christopher Riopelle, and was
sponsored by Atochem North America Foundation and the Pew
Charitable Trusts.</p>
