	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- As oil prices soar, the Bush administration
is split over a proposal from the Energy Department to sell a
half million barrels a day from the nation's Strategic
Petroleum Reserve.
   Energy Secretary James Watkins offered the proposal at a
meeting of the president's National Security Council last
week, arguing it would help moderate increases in oil prices,
according to people at the meeting. Although there is
currently no shortage in the supply of oil, the Energy
Department plan would put a million more barrels of oil a day
onto the market as soon as possible, with half coming from
U.S. reserves and the other half coming from Japanese and
German reserves.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The proposal was supported by the State and Transportation
Departments. But Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady argued
strongly against it, according to sources at the meeting. And
Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, who was represented at
the meeting by his counselor, Wayne Berman, was also opposed.</p>
<p>President Bush, who presided over the meeting but gave no
hint of his leanings, is expected to make a decision on the
plan as early as this week. If the president decides to back
the proposal, U.S. negotiators at Friday's meeting of the
International Energy Agency in Paris are likely to try to
reach an agreement with Japan, Germany and other
oil-consuming nations that hold reserves.</p>
<p>Mr. Brady, the strongest opponent of the plan at the
security council meeting, argued that futures markets suggest
oil prices may be headed down, not up, the sources said. He
compared intervention in oil markets to his own experience as
Treasury secretary intervening in foreign-exchange markets,
saying that any such action must be well timed and well
thought out.</p>
<p>The steep rise in oil prices this week has tended to
undercut Mr. Brady's arguments and put even more pressure on
the White House to back the Energy Department plan. There's
no indication that Messrs. Brady or Mosbacher have dropped
their opposition to the plan.</p>
<p>Mr. Mosbacher's role in opposing the Energy Department
plan has raised some eyebrows both inside and outside the
administration. Mr. Mosbacher built a fortune in Texas oil
fields valued at an estimated $200 million, and still owns
huge interests in the family businesses, which own
oil-producing properties in Texas and Louisiana. Some critics
say a decision not to tap the reserves would keep oil prices
high and thus boost Mr. Mosbacher's personal wealth.</p>
<p>"It's highly inappropriate" for Mr. Mosbacher to be
involved, said Edwin Rothschild, energy policy director at
Citizen Action, a Washington lobbying group on consumer and
labor issues. "The man stands to gain a lot of money from not
using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. There is certainly a
vested interest on the part of anyone who has crude oil --
and Mosbacher has a lot."</p>
<p>Before the Persian Gulf crisis began, Mr. Mosbacher
recused himself from any consideration of energy issues. But
President Bush waived that recusal last month, saying he
needed Mr. Mosbacher's advice in the current crisis.</p>
<p>Mr. Berman, counselor to the commerce secretary, said that
Mr. Mosbacher is simply providing advice to the president,
and not making decisions that affect the oil industry.
Moreover, Mr. Berman said, Mr. Mosbacher has "taken no
position on whether or not you draw down the strategic
petroleum reserve." Rather, he said, the commerce secretary
argued against the Energy Department proposal because the
president needs more time and information before making a
decision.</p>
