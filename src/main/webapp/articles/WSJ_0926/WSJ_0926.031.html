	<p class="article-leader">WATERTOWN, Mass. -- Like a jeweler displaying his wares,
Gregory Yurek, president of American Superconductor Corp.,
proudly lays out a set of silver objects his concern has
crafted.
   "I get a warm, fuzzy feeling in my stomach when I see the
results on this," he says, holding one that looks like a
fettuccine noodle. It contains a superconductor embedded in
silver. American Superconductor has made similar malleable
strands several feet long that can carry more electricity
than a copper cable as thick as a broomstick.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That's the kind of thing that, three years ago, exuberant
scientists said would be possible with new "high-temperature"
superconductors. But then reality set in: The materials were
brittle, chemically unstable and unable to carry much
electricity when fashioned into wires. Last year, some
observers even declared the superconductor party was over --
at least for applications, such as levitated trains and
cheaper power generation, requiring wires or other "bulk"
forms of the materials. For various reasons, researchers
working on superconducting thin films for electronic
applications didn't face such problems.</p>
<p>But now, somewhat to researchers' surprise, predictions
they made in the heady days of discovery are beginning to
come true. American Superconductor, for example, recently
delivered a superconducting magnet to the U.S. Navy for
research on a new generation of sonars. The company expects
by 1995 to be selling large quantities of superconducting
wires for prototype magnets, electric motors, generators and
other technologies, Mr. Yurek says.</p>
<p>"The possibility (of bulk applications) for
high-temperature superconductors didn't look very good 12
months ago," says David Larbalestier, a University of
Wisconsin expert on the materials. "It looks a great deal
better today." Adds John Rowell, vice president and chief
technical officer at Conductus Inc., a Sunnyvale, Calif.,
superconductor company: "When you put together incremental
advances, you realize the situation is very different from a
year or two ago."</p>
<p>Perhaps the main advance during the past year has been the
discovery of a solution to the "weak-link" problem, which has
bedeviled researchers trying to make wires of the new
materials. The wires contain countless tiny crystals, each of
which conducts electricity without resistance when cooled --
the hallmark of superconductivity. But the meeting points of
the crystals, the weak links, acted like loose connections in
an old radio, hindering or cutting off the superconducting
current. That sharply limited the current that wires of the
new materials would carry.</p>
<p>About a year ago, however, German and Japanese researchers
discovered that at a temperature of around 20 degrees Kelvin,
or minus 423 degrees Fahrenheit, the weak-link problem
largely disappears in new superconductors containing the
element bismuth. That's far below the 77 degrees Kelvin, or
minus 321 degrees Fahrenheit, of liquid nitrogen, the cheap
refrigerant that scientists planned to use with the new
superconductors. But it's not as dauntingly cold as the four
degrees Kelvin above absolute zero needed for older
superconductors.</p>
<p>For example, reaching four degrees Kelvin requires helium
"liquefiers," machines that "can be somewhat finicky" and
cost $200,000 to $500,000 or more, says Mark Jalbert, a sales
manager at the CTI Cryogenics division of Helix Technology
Corp., Waltham, Mass. By comparison, CTI and other companies
make high-technology refrigerators, called "cryocoolers,"
that can reliably cool things to 20 degrees Kelvin and are
priced at less than $20,000. Another cooling option around 20
degrees Kelvin is liquid neon, which may prove useful in
superconducting electronics, says Conductus's Mr. Rowell.</p>
<p>Furthermore, "reliability and ease of use" of
superconducting systems are much enhanced at 20 degrees
Kelvin, compared with levels of four degrees Kelvin, notes
Frank Fradin, who manages superconductor research at Argonne
National Laboratory near Chicago. Various properties of
superconductors make them less likely to "go normal," or
suddenly lose superconductivity, at 20 degrees Kelvin, he
adds. That's a crucial factor to engineers developing
superconducting wires, magnets and motors. Such devices can
instantly melt if they go normal, as the huge currents they
are carrying suddenly meet electrical resistance and produce
heat.</p>
<p>Researchers can't explain the weak-link advance, which may
apply to thallium as well as to bismuth superconductors. But
they've been quick to jump on it. "We're lining up contracts
and building a business" to supply wires for prototype
devices based on bismuth superconductors at 20 degrees
Kelvin, says American Superconductor's Mr. Yurek, a former
Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor.</p>
<p>The company, a venture-backed concern founded in 1987 by
four MIT professors, has formed partnerships with Inco Ltd.
and Pirelli Cable Corp. to help make such wires. It also has
formed a joint venture with undisclosed partners to make
cryocoolers, which Mr. Yurek says will be integrated with its
bismuth wires for operation at around 20 degrees Kelvin.</p>
<p>At the heart of the company's strategy is a simple,
old-fashioned metal-working technique that Mr. Yurek calls
"heat and beat." The process involves baking superconductor
precursors and silver in kilns, then forcefully shaping the
compounds into wires and noodle-like tapes with off-the-shelf
machines. After testing countless heat-and-beat variations,
the company now can tailor wires' properties for specific
applications by slightly varying the basic recipe, boasts Mr.
Yurek.</p>
<p>Despite such successes, researchers haven't given up their
original goal of using superconductors at balmier, and more
easily attained, temperatures. "The real benefits (of the new
materials) come out at liquid-nitrogen temperature," asserts
Peter Loconto, president of Ceramics Process Systems Corp.,
Milford, Mass., whose CPS Superconductor Corp. unit is
developing superconducting wires for use at that temperature.
But he adds that revenues from near-term applications at 20
degrees Kelvin should give superconductor developers critical
funds to support their longer-term quest for blockbusters
that work at liquid-nitrogen temperature.</p>
<p>To be sure, there are still hurdles to commercializing
superconductors at 20 degrees Kelvin. First, researchers must
fabricate wires tens or hundreds of feet long that can carry
the huge currents they've recently attained in test samples a
few inches or feet in length. Then they must devise ways to
reliably manufacture and insulate many miles of the wire.</p>
<p>The cost of silver, the coating for superconducting wires,
may pose another stumbling block. Silver helps conduct
electricity, imparts malleability and is one of few
substances that can protect superconductors from chemical
changes that rob them of their magic powers. Thus, it has
become a standard sheathing for new superconductors. Still,
notes Mr. Yurek, it isn't as expensive as some other precious
metals used in high-tech applications, such as the niobium
widely used in older, "low temperature" superconductors.</p>
<p>Perhaps the darkest cloud now on the U.S. superconductor
horizon is the possibility that the Japanese competition will
dominate the nascent market. Sumitomo Electric Industries
Ltd., for example, recently announced that it plans to offer
bismuth superconductor tapes within two years for prototype
applications. Furukawa Electric Co. and Hitachi Ltd. also are
reportedly moving quickly to commercialize bismuth
superconductors. In a recent report, the Commerce Department
stated that although the U.S. stands about even with Japan in
the race to commercialize superconductors, it will "lose
badly" to Japan if present trends continue.</p>
<p>"There are 20 companies in Japan developing advanced
superconductors," says American Superconductor's Mr. Yurek,
"and all 20 are focusing on wires" and their applications. A
recent Japanese report, he adds, predicts that such
applications will comprise an estimated 75% of the $8 billion
to $12 billion market for new superconductors in 2000.
Meanwhile, the U.S. push in new superconductors has focused
mainly on electronic applications such as faster computers
and sensors for military uses.</p>
