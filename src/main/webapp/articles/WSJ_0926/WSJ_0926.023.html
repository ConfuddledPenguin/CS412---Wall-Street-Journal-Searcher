	<p class="article-leader">The end is nigh. October 1 is the day. We know this
because all around Washington politicians have begun to wear
sandwich boards announcing that if the budget summit doesn't
yield up an "agreement" by next Monday, the hellfire of
"sequester" will rain down upon us all.
   "We are 10 days from Armageddon," said Minnesota
Republican William Frenzel last Friday. Picking up Darman's
Book of Revelation, Wisconsin Republican Steve Gunderson said
on Monday, "Seven days to Armageddon. Seven days and the
government stops."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The government stops. The Education Department is
furloughed. There are riots in the streets. It's enough to
make you think about life's meaning, or at least the
government's.</p>
<p>For example, there's the fact that the dreaded
Gramm-Rudman sequester would cut spending by only $85.4
billion. Not exactly peanuts, but out of a federal budget of
$1.3 trillion, not mass starvation either. It's a cut of
merely 6.5% -- from the previously scheduled levels. In fact,
the cut is less than the rate that spending was already
scheduled to increase. In other words, even after the dreaded
sequester, overall federal spending would increase.</p>
<p>Armageddon. Beltway style. Out in the real world, Chase
Manhattan just said it plans to lay off 5,000 employees, Pan
Am 2,500.</p>
<p>Rather than actually cut anything in government, though,
Washington threatens the country with the worst layoffs
possible. Rather than force choices, Congress and Budget
Director Darman somehow manage to agree that air-traffic
controllers are the first to go. Threaten military defeat in
Iraq. Shut down O'Hare Airport before sending home
congressional staff.</p>
<p>What will expiate our sins? Of course, a budget agreement.
Some $50 billion in "savings" next year -- out of an economy
of $5 trillion. Higher income-tax rates. More for cigarettes,
beer and gas. We don't know about our readers, but the end
we're praying for isn't October 1, but November 6. That's
Election Day.</p>
