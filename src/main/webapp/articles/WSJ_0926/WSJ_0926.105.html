	<p class="article-leader">Oil prices generally pulled back after Monday's sizzling
gains.
   Traders and analysts attributed the pause to a correction
and to profit-taking in what has been a frenzied market.
Whatever the reason, futures prices for so-called
prompt-month crudes fell in both New York and London.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the November crude
contract, which surged $2.82 a barrel Monday, fell 72 cents
yesterday to settle at $37.53. December crude was up $1.25 a
barrel to $36.07, but that was a catch-up move after exchange
limits held its Monday gain to $1.50.</p>
<p>On the International Petroleum Exchange in London, crude
oil futures for November and December delivery were lower
after Monday's stunning run-ups. The November contract
dropped 58 cents a barrel to settle at $37.10, while December
crude fell 62 cents to $35.50.</p>
<p>There were continuing reports of some North Sea crudes
being priced at more than $40 a barrel, but trades at these
"notional" levels weren't confirmed. Meanwhile, some fuel
prices weakened.</p>
<p>In U.S. futures trading, heating oil for October delivery
fell 2.72 cents to settle at $1.012 a gallon. Unleaded
gasoline for October delivery fell 2.18 cents to $1.0205 a
gallon, and traders said the gasoline market actually was
much weaker than that for heating oil.</p>
<p>One reason for the slackening of interest in gasoline was
concern in the market that the latest weekly report by the
American Petroleum Institute would show another big buildup
in inventories. That could mean demand for motor fuel would
fall more quickly than seasonal factors would suggest, mainly
because of the slowing U.S. economy and motorist reaction to
the past few weeks' surge in prices at the gasoline pump.</p>
<p>The report, released as usual after the futures market had
closed, appears to have confirmed those market fears.
Although the API reported a decline of 5.7 million barrels in
crude oil inventories last week, it also showed that gasoline
inventories rose by nearly 5.3 million barrels, a much bigger
increase than had been expected.</p>
<p>"This definitely removes the bullish scenario for
gasoline," said Andrew Lebow, an energy analyst with E.D.& F.
Man International Futures. He had been expecting an increase
of only 200,000 to 1.2 million barrels in gasoline
inventories.</p>
<p>In other commodity markets yesterday:</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices eased. December delivery
gold was off 70 cents an ounce to $407.60. December silver
slipped eight cents an ounce to $4.9150. October platinum
dropped $8.90 an ounce to $451.80. Oil prices took a
breather, backing away from their recent strong advances in
the absence of any new threatening rhetoric from Iraq. As a
result, precious metals also retreated from Monday's gains.
The small size of the decline in gold indicated that the
metal still has a strong underpinning, according to analysts.
Also a supporting factor was that producer selling hasn't yet
appeared. It did appear to some degree in silver and
platinum, however, one analyst said. Because those markets
have less investor interest and are thinly traded, they
showed significant losses. Another saving grace for gold, the
analyst said, was that industrial demand for it is remaining
strong, while demand for platinum is dropping with sagging
automobile sales. Yesterday, U.S. auto makers reported a drop
in sales for mid-September.</p>
<p>GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Futures prices closed mixed in
moderate trading. Soybean futures for November delivery
gained four cents a bushel to $6.175 on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Prices were supported partly by the outlook for
continued dry weather in the Mississippi River valley and
some other Southern growing areas, analysts said. Because of
the dry weather, "there's a feeling that soybean yields are
less than they were two to three weeks ago," said Conrad
Leslie, a futures analyst in Chicago. December corn futures
fell one cent a bushel to close at $2.2775, and December
wheat futures edged one-half cent a bushel lower to $2.7475.</p>
<p>COPPER: Most futures prices eased. The September contract,
which will cease trading today, was up 0.80 cent a pound at
$1.2920, mostly because of a relatively large number of
contracts remaining to be fulfilled by delivery of the
commodity or nullified by offsetting trades. Warehouse stocks
of copper for delivery against the September contract are
low. December, however, was off 0.55 cent a pound to $1.1750
after trading in a wide range. The market was influenced by
the liquidation that has continued since prices fell in
London last week, one analyst said. However, he said, demand
for copper remains strong in West Germany, Japan and even the
U.S., where buying interest has held up despite the slowdown
in the economy. According to another analyst, copper prices
have a good prospect of rebounding because North American
supplies are relatively tight and futures have tended to be
oversold recently.</p>
