	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Inspiration Resources Corp., a natural
resources company, said it will have a $16.5 million non-cash
charge in the third quarter related to the previously
announced plan to close operations of an offshore gold mining
vessel in Alaska, Western Gold Exploration & Mining Co.
   Inspiration holds a 50% interest in the venture. Though
the charge reduced Inspiration's equity investment to zero,
Western Gold's net assets at Sept. 30 are expected to total
about $40 million.</p>
