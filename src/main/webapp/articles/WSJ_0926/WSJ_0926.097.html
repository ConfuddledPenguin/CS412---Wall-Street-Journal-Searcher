	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- CS First Boston Inc., in an effort to rid
itself of $1.1 billion in troubled "bridge" loans, is quietly
preparing to pool the bridges into a package and sell them.
   The high-yielding loans, which First Boston plans to
peddle in the private placement market, would be packaged in
securities much like a collateralized bond obligation, or
CBO. That's a package of a diversified group of high-risk
junk bonds that are pooled and separated by credit quality.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>First Boston's plan is Wall Street's latest effort at
grappling with the year-old collapse of the $200 billion
junk-bond market. The junk collapse left Wall Street firms
saddled with billions of dollars in temporary "bridge" loans
to corporate clients that couldn't be paid off. The bridges
were to have been paid when the clients sold junk bonds, but
that's been impossible with the paralysis in that market.</p>
<p>Final details of First Boston's bridge-loan plan haven't
yet been worked out, according to people familiar with First
Boston. And the offering could be delayed if investors remain
skittish. But some of the loans are likely to be bought by CS
First Boston's parent, CS Holding, they said.</p>
<p>The plan has apparently mollified credit-rating agencies,
which had been disappointed that First Boston has continued
to hold such a heavy bridge load. First Boston's $1.1 billion
bridge exposure is the greatest on Wall Street.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Standard & Poor's Corp. affirmed its ratings of
CS First Boston's commercial paper, or short-term IOUs, and
about $147 million of subordinated debt, citing a "credible
plan to reduce these exposures."</p>
<p>Archibald Cox Jr., newly named chief executive of the
firm's big First Boston Corp. securities unit, declined to
comment on the plan. He said only: "I believe the bridge
problem will be resolved before year end."</p>
<p>People close to First Boston said its plan is expected to
include all its bridges except a $257 million loan to Campeau
Corp.'s Federated Department Stores Inc., which currently is
in bankrutpcy-law proceedings. The other bridges include a
$230 million loan to Ohio Mattress Co., $420 million to
American Medical International Inc. and about $200 million to
Jerrico Inc.</p>
<p>CS First Boston is 44.5%-owned by CS Holding, the parent
of the big Swiss bank Credit Suisse. (Earlier this year,
First Boston sold about half the original $450 million Ohio
Mattress bridge to CS Holding, under pressure from rating
agencies.)</p>
<p>Like most Wall Street firms, CS First Boston desperately
wants the bridges off its books. The firm was forced to take
more than $200 million in reserves last year for the bridge
loans, and this year is taking a similar amount under
pressure from credit-rating agencies.</p>
<p>Before the recent plan, credit-rating agencies hadn't
ruled out a future downgrade of the debt of CS First Boston.
But yesterday, S&P said it affirmed its ratings on the firm's
commercial paper at A1 and subordinated debt at
single-A-minus.</p>
<p>In a statement, S&P said that CS First Boston has "had to
contend with the dramatically reduced levels of activities in
the securities markets in general and a significant bridge
loan portfolio."</p>
<p>S&P believes, however, "that management is working on a
credible plan to reduce these exposures. In addition, the
close affiliation with CS Holding and related entities
combined with the overall strategic importance of CS First
Boston to CS Holding should provide adequate resources and
financial strength to maintain the current ratings."</p>
<p>Edward Emmer, an S&P managing director, said that the
rating agency "has an ongoing dialogue" with CS First Boston
and that "it seems from our discussions that they are
seriously addressing the problem of the bridges." He declined
to elaborate.</p>
<p>CS First Boston has recently undergone a series of
management changes that have shaken morale at the firm; the
latest management shift occurred a week ago, when Curtis
Welling, head of First Boston's equity department, was
ousted.</p>
<p>John M. Hennessy, CS First Boston chief executive, has
sought to calm the troops amid all the changes. "Assembling
the team is the most important part of any business plan," he
said in a recent internal memo. "In time, the results of
these leaders and our strategy will speak louder than any
words."</p>
<p>Yesterday, First Boston Corp. named Charles H. Mayer as a
managing director and chief information officer, a new
postion. Mr. Mayer, a veteran of Salomon Inc. and Morgan
Stanley Group Inc., will report to Robert Raziano, First
Boston's head of finance, administration, operations and
systems.</p>
<p>Today, the firm is expected to announce that it hired Paul
J. McAuliffe from Morgan Stanley to be a director in First
Boston's burgeoning real estate group, working for David M.
Malcolm, the firm's former junk-bond chief who earlier this
year was reassigned to head the real estate unit.</p>
