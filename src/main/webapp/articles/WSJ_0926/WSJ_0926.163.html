	<p class="article-leader">A South Dakota rancher, who said he was bilked by his
broker, won a jury award of $800,000 in punitive damages
against E.F. Hutton & Co.
   The jury in the town of Rapid City concluded that Hutton
and a former Hutton broker took advantage of an inexperienced
investor, pursuing a risky investment strategy that cost the
plaintiff $27,000. E.F. Hutton & Co. is now part of Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In addition to the punitive damages, designed to punish
the defendant, the jury compensated rancher Wayne Stark for
his loss plus interest, amounting to $36,360.</p>
<p>The case began in December 1983, when Mr. Stark decided to
invest the proceeds from a cattle sale. The 45-year-old
cattleman from Belle Fourche, a town in the Black Hills,
opened an account at a Hutton office in nearby Rapid City.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Stark's attorney, Ronald Clabaugh of
Rapid City, Hutton used the money in a risky strategy known
as "naked" put writing. This meant that the broker, William
Van Drunen, sold options committing Mr. Stark to purchase
various securities at a fixed price in the future. When the
market fell in October 1987, Mr. Stark lost $27,000.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Stark's 1989 lawsuit, Mr. Van Drunen was
trading in the rancher's account without his knowledge.
Furthermore, according to the suit, the broker was "churning"
the account -- generating excessive turnover in the account
to make money in commissions. Hutton, the suit claimed, had
failed to supervise its broker adequately.</p>
<p>The trial began last week in Rapid City and lasted five
days. The jurors, all from Rapid City, deliberated less than
five hours to determine culpability.</p>
<p>Donald Walford, a Denver investment banker who testified
as an expert witness for Mr. Stark, said, "He had no
knowledge of option trading. If you said stock to this guy,
he said horses or cattle. He had no idea he could lose, and
he lost a lot."</p>
<p>Mr. Van Drunen, who was not named as a defendant in the
case, could not be located for comment. A Hutton attorney in
Chicago, Timothy Carey, said, "We intend to file a motion to
have the verdict set aside."</p>

<p>LOCKHEED faces wrongful-dismissal case filed by three
company auditors.</p>
<p>In the case set to begin today, Lockheed Corp. is accused
of firing the auditors in 1985 for questioning the structural
integrity of the giant C-5B military cargo plane. The C-5B is
being used a lot in the Persian Gulf because of its 145-ton
capacity.</p>
<p>The auditors say they were fired because they raised
concerns about the C5B's metal mainframes, complaining all
the way up the chain of command to the then-president of
Lockheed, Lawrence Kitchen. The defense contractor maintains
that Thomas Benecke and Terrence Schielke were dismissed
after exhibiting "unprofessional conduct" and circumventing
"company policies and audit procedures." The third employee,
Clyde Jones Jr., "had elected to retire well before" Mr.
Kitchen learned of the matter, Lockheed says.</p>
<p>The trial pits Lockheed against Herbert Hafif, an attorney
perhaps best known for suing ComputerLand Corp. over a
$250,000 promisory note and ending up winning 20% of the
company for his clients in a highly publicized jury award.
Mr. Hafif said in an interview he aims to show how the C-5B
is "a ticking time bomb," although he doesn't claim to be
able to prove any specific accidents occurred because of
mainframe problems.</p>
<p>Lockheed says the company and the Air Force have studied
the possibility of mainframe deficiencies over the years --
including through task forces that the plaintiffs were
members of -- and they've determined "the parts had been
properly prepared and are safe."</p>
<p>The case will focus in part on a letter the auditors sent
in August 1985 to Mr. Kitchen, which ended: "Our patience is
exhausted. We will not be delayed or stonewalled for any
reason. This issue deals with life and death, and this letter
represents our last resort in dealing with this problem
internally. The ball is in your court."</p>
<p>Mr. Kitchen threw the missive back across the table to Mr.
Benecke. "I told him I didn't like their approach," Mr.
Kitchen said in a deposition. "I asked why they had not
followed the procedure of an audit report and taken it
through the proper process; why they hadn't carried out their
responsibilities that they had as auditors; and that I didn't
appreciate them coming in at the last hour."</p>
<p>Mr. Jones said later that he never "dreamed that {Mr.
Kitchen} would get in that state of anger." But Mr. Kitchen,
who retired as Lockheed chairman in 1988 and is still a
director, described himself as perhaps "forceful in my
response, but nothing out of the ordinary."</p>

<p>TOBACCO-LIABILITY verdict leaves both sides claiming
victory.</p>
<p>By finding American Tobacco Co. liable for the death of a
longtime smoker -- but awarding no damages to his family -- a
jury in Oxford, Miss., has muddied the waters of tobacco
litigation.</p>
<p>The family of Nathan H. Horton, a housing contractor who
died of lung cancer in 1987, charged American Tobacco with
marketing a "defective and unreasonably dangerous product."
The company, a unit of American Brands Inc., denied any
responsibility for Mr. Horton's death. But anti-smoking
forces saw Mississippi's state law, which is more favorable
to plaintiffs than most other states, as working to their
advantage.</p>
<p>A Lafayette County circuit court jury, by a 9-3 vote,
found for the plaintiffs -- but went no further. Testimony
showed that Mr. Horton "continued to smoke in the face of
warnings from his family and doctors," said David Roach, jury
foreman, "and therefore, he assumed some of the risk and
fault."</p>
<p>Mike Davis, an attorney with Byrd, Davis & Eisenberg in
Austin, Texas, who helped represent the Hortons, termed the
outcome "unusual," but said it represents progress in the
"evolutionary process" of tobacco litigation. "Five years
ago, a verdict for a plaintiff was unheard of. Now public
opinion is beginning to evolve to the point where {physical
harm} is a matter of shared responsibility."</p>
<p>Some tobacco industry analysts, however, seized on the
same point as evidence that cigarette makers scored a major
victory. "Even if you can prove" that smoking causes harm,
said Kurt Feuerman at Morgan Stanley, "it's difficult to
prove that the plaintiff wasn't aware of the risks. This
{verdict} won't snowball into a tremendous number of new
cases." American Tobacco declined to comment.</p>
<p>Immediately following the verdict, attorneys for American
Brands asked Judge Eugene Bogen to enter a judgment for the
company, since no damages were due to the Hortons. Attorneys
for the Hortons, meanwhile, asked the judge to award at least
nominal damages or to set a new trial to determine damages.
Judge Bogen said he would consider both sides' requests.</p>

<p>SCHOOL FINANCING LAW declared invalid by Texas judge.</p>
<p>The law was adopted in June, eight months after the Texas
Supreme Court said the state's system of financing public
education was unconstitutional because of disparities in the
treatment of rich and poor school districts. Like most
states, the Texas system relies on a combination of state
funding and local property taxes.</p>
<p>In response to the state supreme court ruling, Texas
lawmakers approved a five-year education plan that adds $528
million to state funding for public schools in 1990-91. But a
number of poorer school districts went back to court,
contending the new law doesn't cure the inequities. In
Austin, State District Judge F. Scott McCown agreed,
concluding that the system "remains unconstitutional."</p>
<p>Judge McCown said the state's lawmakers had failed to
establish a system that provides wealthy and poor school
districts with "substantially equal" access to revenue. He
didn't order immediate changes, but told the Legislature to
come up with a better plan by next Sept. 1. If it doesn't,
the judge said he would consider barring the spending of
state and local funds earmarked for schools, or else telling
them how to spend the funds.</p>
<p>W.N. Kirby, Texas commissioner of education, said he'll
ask the state to appeal the ruling, but he also urged the
Legislature to work on a new plan "or risk having the courts
lead our children down the road of mediocrity for all."</p>

<p>FORMER THRIFT REGULATOR joins Washington law office.</p>
<p>Rosemary Stewart, former director of enforcement for the
Office of Thrift Supervision, became a partner in the
220-lawyer Washington office of Cleveland-based Jones, Day,
Reavis & Pogue.</p>
<p>Ms. Stewart resigned her post at OTS in August. Prior to
the creation of OTS in 1989, Ms. Stewart was enforcement
chief at the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. In that capacity,
she received some criticism for her role in drafting a 1988
memo of understanding with lawyers for Lincoln Savings & Loan
Association, a unit of American Continental Corp., Phoenix.</p>
<p>The memo, nicknamed "Rosemary's Baby" by thrift critics,
cleared Lincoln for the pre-1986 period in exchange for a
promise from Lincoln not to sue the bank board. But Ms.
Stewart says that the memo resulted in a 1988 Bank Board
examination that led to Lincoln being closed down. American
Continental Chairman Charles Keating Jr. unsuccessfully
challenged the Bank Board's actions in federal court. He is
now in jail awaiting trial on fraud charges brought by
California.</p>
<p>Ms. Stewart said she will spend at least part of her time
working on thrift matters at Jones Day. Although there is a
federal prohibition against many former federal employees
representing clients before their former agency in their
first year out of government, it doesn't apply to Ms.
Stewart. She said she will begin representing clients before
OTS immediately.</p>
