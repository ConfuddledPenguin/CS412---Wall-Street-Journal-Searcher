	<p class="article-leader">Shares of FileNet Corp. plunged 43% after the Costa Mesa,
Calif.-based maker of document image-processing equipment
said it may report a small loss for the third quarter because
of "a significant number of delayed decisions" by potential
customers.
   "These recent delays appear to be directly related to the
increasingly negative economic environment," Ted Smith,
president and chief executive officer, said.</p>
