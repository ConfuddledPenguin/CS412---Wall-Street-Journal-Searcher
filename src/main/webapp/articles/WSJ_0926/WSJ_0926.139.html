	<p class="article-leader">Banco Exterior de Espana confirmed it is studying a
possible merger with Banco Hispano Americano, but denied
talks between the two Spanish banks are under way.
   "We are not in negotiations, nor do we have a merger
plan," an Exterior official said, adding that combining the
state-owned bank with Hispano would imply privatization and
require government approval. A Hispano spokesman also
emphasized that a merger with Exterior isn't in the offing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Exterior, Spain's seventh-largest bank, is 51.4%-owned by
the government. The state industrial holding company
Instituto Nacional de Industria and the Bank of Spain jointly
own a 13.94% stake in Exterior, and the financial services
company Factorex has an 8.42% interest. The rest is listed on
Spanish stock exchanges.</p>
