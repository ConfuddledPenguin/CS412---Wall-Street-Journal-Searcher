	<p class="article-leader">Acquired immune deficiency syndrome will become a major
killer of children by the year 2000, offsetting some of the
recent global reduction in child mortality rates, the World
Health Organization reported.
   By the end of the century, 10 million or more children
will have contracted the AIDS virus, and most will have died,
the WHO estimated in a new report. In some parts of
sub-Sahara Africa, where AIDS is particularly prevalent,
deaths for pediatric AIDS may boost the child mortality rate
by as much as 50%, the Geneva-based agency warned.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Over the last decade, some 700,000 AIDS-infected babies
have been born around the world, but the number is expected
to expand rapidly. In most countries, but not the U.S.,
heterosexual intercourse is becoming the primary method of
transmitting the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes
AIDS. The WHO also estimates that 15 million to 20 million
adults will have been infected by HIV by the year 2000.</p>
<p>The WHO issued the report, its first on pediatric AIDS, as
world leaders are preparing to meet at the United Nations
this weekend for the world summit on children. Michael
Merson, director of the WHO's AIDS program, said the report
is designed to call attention to a growing health and welfare
problem that must be addressed by world leaders.</p>
<p>Not only will many children die of AIDS, but millions who
aren't HIV-infected will be orphaned as their parents die of
AIDS. "We have to plan for the implications of this," Dr.
Merson said. "This is going to be a burden on society. There
are going to be big economic and welfare implications."
Because there is no cure for AIDS, the only way to combat the
epidemic is stronger programs to reduce the sexual
transmission of AIDS.</p>
<p>Over the last decade, expanded childhood immunization
programs have significantly reduced mortality from such
diseases as diphtheria, measles, polio, tetanus and
tuberculosis. "Now because of AIDS, we fear this progress
will be reversed," said Hiroshi Nakajima, director-general of
the WHO.</p>
