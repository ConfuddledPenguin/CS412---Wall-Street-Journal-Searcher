	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Over-the-counter stocks rebounded from
Monday's lows as investors hunted for bargains among some
larger OTC stocks.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 2.62 to 354.78, 0.7% gain,
as volume eased to 109.9 million shares from 114.8 million
Monday. Declining shares narrowly outpaced advancers, 967 to
948, as 2,329 issues remained unchanged. The number of stocks
falling to new lows continued to swamp those posting new
highs, 317 to 9.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"This is a reflex, corrective rally," said Jerry Newman,
institutional trader at Cowen & Co.'s OTC department in San
Francisco. Institutions strode in to buy more shares of
better-quality companies they already own, including some
technology shares, said Patrick O'Malley, vice president of
OTC trading at Needham & Co., New York. Among those, Borland
rose 1 5/8 to 18 and Synoptics Communications jumped 2 to 26
1/2.</p>
<p>"No news is good news," said Robert McCready,
institutional trader at A.G. Edwards & Sons, St. Louis. While
small investors didn't rush in to buy shares, they also
weren't readily selling shares in the absence of any
developments on the economic and geopolitical front, Mr.
McCready said. However, he agreed with other traders that the
rally probably will be short-lived.</p>
<p>Oracle Systems rose 1/8 to 7 3/8 as officials with the
Redwood City, Calif., software maker met with analysts and
investors. After the market closed, Oracle reported a loss
for the first quarter ended Aug. 31 of 27 cents a share,
compared with year-earlier net income of nine cents a share.
Oracle cautioned investors on Sept. 7 that it expected a loss
of 20 cents a share.</p>
<p>Investors flocked to OTC market's largest stock, MCI
Communications. Shares of the Washington, D.C., long-distance
carrier rose 1 1/4 to 31 and were the day's most active. MCI
unveiled a family of products that the company said will
enable users to "bring the power of supercomputers to the
desktop." Separately, MCI said it will interconnect its
electronic mail service with three Scandinavian electronic
mail services. The Nasdaq Utility Index, which includes MCI,
rebounded 5.78 to 468.13.</p>
<p>Buy-out news boosted the stocks of several companies.</p>
<p>Justin Industries sprinted 1 1/4 to 15 after a group of
dissident shareholders launched an $18-a-share tender offer
for 6.2 million shares of the Fort Worth, Texas, maker of
boots and building components. Justin has twice rejected
buy-out offers from the group, led by Perry H. Sutherland of
Kansas City, Mo., and Barry S. Rosenstein of New York.</p>
<p>Separately, Justin said a federal judge refused to delay
the closing of the company's $9-a-share offer for Tony Lama
and denied a motion by the dissident group calling for a
special shareholders' meeting.</p>
<p>TVX Broadcast Group leaped 1 3/8 to 9 after the Virginia
Beach, Va., concern accepted a sweetened $9.50-a-share bid
from Paramount Communications to buy the 17% of TVX that
Paramount doesn't already own. In July, a TVX special
committee rejected a $7.50-a-share bid from Paramount.</p>
<p>Henley Group jumped 1 3/8 to 20 7/8. A group including
Libra Investment & Trade Ltd. said late Monday that it
increased its stake in the La Jolla, Calif.-based laboratory
and medical-equipment maker to 22.9% of the common shares.</p>
<p>Intel gained 1 3/4. Intel and Alliant Computer Systems
have joined four multinational computer companies in agreeing
to set standards for certain Intel software, which can be
used as alternative to Sun Microsystems' RISC-based
workstation architecture. Alliant was unchanged at 2 3/8 and
Sun was unchanged at 27 1/4.</p>
<p>Other technology shares were mixed.</p>
<p>Microsoft gained 1 7/8 to 60 3/8 and Conner Peripherals
edged up 1/8 to 19 1/2, but Apple Computer eased 1/4 to 30.</p>
<p>Companies continued to take advantage of low stock prices
to announce plans to buy back their stock. Maynard Oil rose
1/2 to 8 1/4 and Oshkosh Truck Class B shares advanced 3/8 to
8 1/4. Both companies said they plan to repurchase shares.</p>
<p>Among the day's losers, FileNet plunged 3 7/8 to 5 1/8.
The Costa Mesa, Calif., management systems concern said
revenue for the third quarter will fall below analysts
expectations. FileNet also said it may report a "modest loss"
for the quarter.</p>
<p>Old Stone slipped 1/4 to 7 1/4 after the Providence, R.I.,
commercial bank cut its quarterly dividend to 20 cents a
share from 39 cents. Old Stone also said it expects to report
a "small loss" for the third quarter ending Sept. 30. A year
earlier, Old Stone reported a loss of $6.17 a share,
including provisions for loan losses and real estate-related
investments.</p>
<p>Ilio tumbled 2 1/8 to 3 7/8. A spokeswoman for the
Secaucus, N.J., clothing retailer and distributor said the
company has no pending news to account for the plunge.
Concern about the financial status of Ilio's underwriter,
R.H. Damon & Co., apparently pressured the stock, according
to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. However, an
official with R.H. Damon said the underwriter is financially
sound and suggested that some investors may have sold Ilio
shares to meet margin calls.</p>
<p>Bizmart fell 5/8 to 7 1/2 and traded at a 52-week low of 6
3/4 before recovering. Analysts again lowered earnings
estimates for the Arlington, Texas, operator of office
products superstores, DJPIR reported. Bizmart went public at
$10 a share in August 1989 in an initial public offering led
by Alex. Brown & Sons and Robertson Stephens. Traders
attributed yesterday's selling to reduced earnings estimates
released by Alex. Brown.</p>
<p>Monty R. Standifer, Bizmart vice president of finance,
told DJPIR the company isn't discouraging analysts from
lowering their earnings for the company's 1991 fiscal year
ending in April to a range of 30 cents to 35 cents a share,
compared with a loss of 15 cents a share in fiscal 1990. Mr.
Standifer said that September sales have slowed "a bit" and
that competition in Dallas and Houston has pressured
Bizmart's prices.</p>
<p>Separately, Alex. Brown has made some changes in the
consumer areas of its corporate finance and research
departments. Monday, Mark Goodman and Peter Breck were named
co-heads of the consumer group of the firm's corporate
finance division. Senior retail analyst Fred E. Wintzer also
recently retired, according to an official with firm.</p>
<p>Alex. Brown's reputation was tarnished this summer when
two consumer companies -- Bizmart and In-Store Advertising --
released poor earnings outlooks shortly after they had issued
shares in offerings underwritten by the Baltimore investment
banking firm.</p>
