	<p class="article-leader">SYDNEY, Australia -- Huge write-downs on investments
plunged Elders IXL Ltd. into the red by 1.3 billion
Australian dollars (US$1.08 billion), setting a record for
the largest corporate annual loss in Australian history.
   In the past two years of corporate mayhem in Australia,
former highflying businessmen have been outdoing each other
to post larger losses. Now, John Elliott, who built Elders
from a jam maker into a world-class brewer, joins a list of
titleholders that has included Alan Bond and Bruce Judge,
architect of investment company Ariadne Australia Ltd.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Elders's operating profit after tax fell 80.3% to A$131.9
million in the fiscal year ended June 30 from A$668.6 million
a year earlier. After accounting for extraordinary losses of
A$1.44 billion from write-offs, though, the brewing, finance
and agribusiness company posted an overall loss of A$1.3
billion.</p>
<p>The company's directors were expected to opt for big
write-downs in the latest annual results as part of a
corporate overhaul to strip the company down to solely a
brewing concern. But the size of the writedowns exceeded many
analysts' predictions. The losses prompted directors to omit
the final dividend, triggering a sharp reduction in the
annual dividend payout -- in line with some predictions.</p>
<p>It was "a little worse than expected," said Craig
Drummond, who tracks Elders for brokerage firm J.B. Were &
Son. Paying no final dividend, he added, "will come as a
surprise" to many investors.</p>
<p>And while Elders's directors forecast a return to
profitability soon, some Elders watchers warn that the
current year's profit might not be all that buoyant. In
addition, directors indicated they have further deferred
plans, originally announced last March, to make a capital
return to shareholders of about A$2.2 billion that was to be
raised from the sale of Elders's assets.</p>
<p>It's all bad news for Elders's debt-strapped controlling
shareholder, Harlin Holdings Pty., a closely held concern
associated with Mr. Elliott, who is also Elders's chairman.
Harlin currently controls 55% of Elders. It depends on the
dividend income to service the hefty debts it incurred in
building its Elders stake and needs the capital return from
Elders to reduce its borrowings.</p>
<p>In an effort to relieve its financial bind, Harlin this
month arranged to sell 19.9% of its Elders holding to Asahi
Breweries Ltd. of Japan for A$960 million.</p>
<p>Asahi directors aren't expected to meet to approve the
transaction until sometime in October. But in Tokyo, Koichiro
Iwaki, a senior managing director of Asahi Breweries, said
the Elders loss was expected and won't affect the Japanese
brewer's plans to invest in the world's fourth-largest
brewing group. Indeed, Mr. Iwaki said that Tuesday's
announced loss "is slightly less than we had expected." But
he left open the possibility that other factors could arise
to complicate the decision. He didn't elaborate.</p>
<p>In the latest year, Elders said, revenue fell 10.3% to
A$15.39 billion from A$17.16 billion, reflecting reduced
contributions from businesses being sold. By the end of the
financial year, Elders had sold A$1.6 billion of nonbrewing
assets and shrunk the gross assets of its finance division to
A$2.7 billion from A$5.9 billion.</p>
<p>Elders shares closed unchanged Tuesday on the Australian
Stock Exchange at A$1.47 each, ahead of the company's
announcement.</p>
<p>Before accounting for the extraordinary losses, per-share
earnings dropped to 5.2 Australian cents from 31.3 cents a
year earlier. The company paid a dividend of 8.5 cents for
the fiscal first half and that has become the total annual
payout. Last year, Elders paid a full-year total of 17.6
cents, adjusted for a free-share issue. The company said it
expects to pay a dividend on its preference shares.</p>
<p>Elders's directors said they are taking the write-offs now
to prepare the company to concentrate on its breweries in
Australia, Britain and Canada. The company, which will be
renamed Foster's Brewing Group Ltd., has been trying to sell
its nonbrewing assets for several months, but the sales have
gone slowly.</p>
