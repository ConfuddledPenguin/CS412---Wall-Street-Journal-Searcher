	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada may be
the most unpopular leader in the Western world.
   His Gallup Poll approval rating of 19% is lower than
Richard Nixon's at the height of Watergate; below that of
Lyndon Johnson during the Vietnam War.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It's one of the lowest, if not the lowest, of any Western
leader," says Bob Wybrow, a director of Gallup's British
affiliate.</p>
<p>The prime minister's unpopularity may mean trouble for the
U.S.'s closest ally and biggest trading partner. Canada is on
the brink of a recession and in the midst of tax reform. Its
government debt is bigger, per capita, than in the U.S. The
country is searching for the way out of a constitutional
crisis that many Canadians fear will tear their country
apart.</p>
<p>"He isn't in a position to lead that," says Dalton Camp,
who was a top political adviser to Mr. Mulroney until last
year. Mr. Camp says that in their present mood, Canadians
"wouldn't take him on as a baby sitter."</p>
<p>Under Canada's parliamentary system, Mr. Mulroney can rule
for as many as three more years before he has to call an
election, because his party has a majority in the House of
Commons. But his loss of credibility already makes it harder
for him to govern.</p>
<p>This week the prime minister may be forced to expand the
Canadian Senate, in order to rescue a 7% value-added tax
scheduled to take effect Jan. 1. The appointed Senate never
before has killed an important measure passed by the elected
House of Commons, but it has been emboldened by the
government's unpopularity. The Senate's banking committee
yesterday recommended against passing the the new tax.</p>
<p>No Canadian prime minister has ever used his
constitutional power to pack the Senate, either, but Mr.
Mulroney can't govern effectively if it blocks crucial
legislation. Canadian retailers already have ordered millions
of catalogues with prices that will be incorrect if the new
tax isn't passed. Many have reprogrammed checkout counters or
ordered new cash registers in preparation for the new tax.
Some Canadian workers will lose unemployment benefits because
the Senate has tied up another government bill.</p>
<p>"We almost have a coup here," said Harvie Andre, the House
of Commons leader for Mr. Mulroney's Progressive Conservative
Party.</p>
<p>Unrest has spread beyond the Senate. Eight members of the
House of Commons, including a cabinet minister, have left Mr.
Mulroney's party this year. Until Parliament reopened Monday,
Mr. Mulroney had been lying so low that many Canadians
thought his troubles had made him sick.</p>
<p>Many Canadians just don't like Mr. Mulroney as a person.
They call him `Lyin' Brian' because a gift for off-the-cuff
hyperbole makes him seem insincere. He tried to reform
Canada's lavish welfare benefits after declaring that they
were "a sacred trust." He negotiated a free-trade agreement
with the U.S. after saying that free trade "affects Canadian
sovereignty and we will have none of it."</p>
<p>But Mr. Mulroney's problems stem mostly from politically
risky efforts to solve Canada's most pressing problems.</p>
<p>"He had the most ambitious agenda of any prime minister I
know of. He may pretty well have worn the people out," says
Mr. Camp.</p>
<p>The issues of trade with the U.S. and relations between
French and English Canadians have dominated Canadian politics
since the country was formed in 1867. Canadian nationalists
always opposed closer ties with the U.S. and they still do.
Mr. Mulroney took a huge gamble when he signed the trade pact
with the U.S. in 1988. He took another when he persuaded the
premiers of all 10 Canadian provinces to approve
constitutional amendments that met French-speaking Quebec's
demand to be recognized as a "distinct society."</p>
<p>The benefits of free trade have been swamped by other
economic factors. The Canadian dollar has risen about 12%
against the U.S. dollar since the pact, more than wiping out
the competitive gains from U.S. tariff reductions.</p>
<p>The "distinct society" plan proved unpopular with
English-speaking Canadians. It collapsed this summer in a
bitter national debate that left French and English more
antagonistic than before. Now Quebec is making tougher
demands and the Western provinces want to rewrite the
constitution to give themselves more power. And this summer,
Indians blocked roads, bridges and railroads to demand
special constitutional status.</p>
<p>Canadians see Mr. Mulroney's constitutional initiative as
a "total failure" says Donna Dasko, vice president of
Environics Research Group Inc., a polling concern. "The
country is blaming the politicians for getting us into this
and coming out with a fractured country," she adds.</p>
<p>The prime minister raised more hackles by trying to check
a generation-long government borrowing spree. He raised taxes
and cut programs. Government revenues have risen 60% since
Mr. Mulroney took office. Spending, aside from interest on
government debt, has gone up only 20%.</p>
<p>This belt-tightening meant a chorus of complaints over
shrinking subsidies for everything from women's crisis
centers to unprofitable railroad lines. "You can't introduce
{the value added tax}, reform unemployment insurance, shut
down the trains and do all those things without incurring the
wrath of the people," concedes Bill Fox, a longtime friend of
the prime minister and his former press secretary.</p>
<p>The 7% value-added tax on almost all goods and services,
except food, is a crucial part of Mr. Mulroney's fiscal
revision. It's meant to replace a 13.5% tax on manufacturers,
which economists say skews investment away from manufacturing
and favors imports over Canadian goods.</p>
<p>But consumers see it as a new burden. Provincial
governments hate it because sales taxes previously were a
provincial monopoly. A recent Environics poll found 76% of
Canadians opposed to the tax, including 54% of Conservative
voters.</p>
<p>Canadians' dislike for Mr. Mulroney hasn't made them any
fonder of other national leaders. The three-year-old Reform
Party, which wants more power for the Western provinces, now
leads the public opinion polls in Alberta, a traditional
Conservative stronghold. A separatist candidate for the
national Parliament won 68% of the vote in the only Quebec
by-election held since this summer's "distinct society"
debacle. Voters in Ontario earlier this month elected the
socialist New Democratic Party to a majority of seats in
their provincial parliament.</p>
<p>The prime minister still has a core of support, especially
among business executives who welcome his free-trade and
deficit-fighting policies.</p>
<p>And Mr. Mulroney says he can recover. "I've been through
this before," he told reporters earlier this week: "I started
the '84 election campaign way behind. I started the '88
election campaign way behind. This is pretty well where we've
been before we climbed slowly and surely back to win another
majority government."</p>
