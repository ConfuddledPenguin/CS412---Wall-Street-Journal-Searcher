	<p class="article-leader">United Services Advisors Inc., which manages $650 million
in mutual fund assets, is again trying to distance itself
from a possible business embarrassment.
   Last year, the San Antonio, Texas, concern changed hands
after its founder, Clark Aylsworth, was forced by the
Securities and Exchange Commission to give up control. The
SEC action followed a discovery in the mid-1980s that one of
the fund group's portfolio managers was conspiring with two
Vancouver stock promoters to stack the mutual fund he ran
with worthless Canadian mining stocks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Now, United Services, which specializes in gold and
natural resource stocks, is eager to deny any connection with
Mr. Aylsworth's son, C. Allyn Aylsworth.</p>
<p>The firm sent a letter last week to 500 United Services
fund shareholders who had invested through the younger Mr.
Aylsworth's coin and gold bullion business, Auric United
Corp. The letter advised the shareholders that Auric was
being investigated by the Texas attorney general's office and
said that there isn't any connection between Auric and United
Services.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a district court in Bexar County, Texas,
granted a temporary restraining order stopping Auric from
doing business or disposing of any assets, according to the
Texas attorney general's office, which requested the court
order. In addition, the attorney general's office filed a
suit alleging that Auric had violated the state's Deceptive
Trade Practices Act.</p>
<p>According to the state's assistant attorney general, Raul
Noriega, there is a gap between the value of the coins and
bullion held by Auric and the amount it should be holding on
behalf of customers. C. Allyn Aylsworth's lawyer declined to
comment on the case; a recorded telephone message at Auric
said its office was closed yesterday.</p>
<p>Paul Robertson, general counsel for United Services, said
the firm owned 24.3% of Auric until June 1987, when it sold
its stake to Allyn Aylsworth. In that same month, Mr.
Aylsworth, who was then a vice president for marketing at the
fund group, left United Services, Mr. Robertson said.</p>
<p>Mr. Aylsworth's father, Clark Aylsworth, agreed to sell
his controlling stake in the firm late last year to settle
SEC charges of failing to properly supervise a fund manager.
The charges, which he didn't admit or deny, grew out of the
manager's purchase of the worthless mining stocks.</p>
<p>The elder Mr. Aylsworth had continued to work as a
consultant with United Services, but yesterday the firm said
the arrangement had been terminated. Mr. Aylsworth couldn't
be reached for comment.</p>
<p>United Services' largest fund is a gold fund, the $250
million U.S. Gold Shares fund.</p>
