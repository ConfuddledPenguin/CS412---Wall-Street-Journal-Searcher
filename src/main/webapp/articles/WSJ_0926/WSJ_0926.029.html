	<p class="article-leader">Marriott Corp. said it will delay construction starts of
most new hotels and senior living centers as well as reduce
next year's capital expenditures because of the weakness in
the real-estate, lodging and financial markets.
   The lodging and food-services company, based in
Washington, D.C., also said asset sales would be lower than
expected earlier this year. In the spring, the company told
analysts it expected to sell about $2 billion of assets.
Yesterday, William J. Shaw, Marriott's chief financial
officer, said the company has sold about $900 million in
assets this year and expects to sell a further $700 million
in the next few months. The company didn't detail which
assets it was looking to sell.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>James Meyer at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia
said the Japanese would probably be the most likely buyers
for some of Marriott's properties as U.S. demand has died
away.</p>
<p>Capital expenditures will be reduced to about $650 million
next year, compared with $1.3 billion this year, Mr. Shaw
said. Construction projects already under way, such as a new
senior living center in Boca Raton, Fla., will be completed.</p>
<p>Marriott is also putting a different spin on its business
strategy. Traditionally, the company has developed hotel
properties and then sold them to investors, while retaining
the management contracts. Going forward, Marriott will place
greater emphasis on prefinancing development projects as well
as working with third parties and developing joint ventures,
Mr. Shaw said.</p>
<p>While most analysts said Marriott's scaled-back
construction and capital-spending plans were a step in the
right direction, few are bullish on the company. Caroline
Levy at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. is worried that some of
the company's assets might be overstated on its balance
sheet.</p>
<p>Ms. Levy suspended her earnings estimate on Marriott
Monday because she believes the company might have to "take
write-downs against up to $3 billion of its assets." Sizable
write-downs "could feasibly wipe out its net worth," she
said. The company had $461 million in equity at the end of
the second quarter, with $3.4 billion of debt.</p>
<p>Marriott's announcement yesterday came just one day after
its stock hit an eight-year low at $10.875. The stock has
lost about half its market value in recent months as worries
about the slowdown in the lodging industry and sinking
real-estate markets have increased.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Marriott shares rose 75 cents to $11.625 in
active New York Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
