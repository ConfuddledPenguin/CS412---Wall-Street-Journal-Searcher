	<p class="article-leader">BRUSSELS -- The European Community's energy commissioner,
Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, warned against further rises in oil
prices and called the recent surge "totally unjustified and
indefensible."
   Mr. Cardoso e Cunha accused traders of speculating "at the
expense of the consumers." He said oil stocks remain at
unusually high levels, despite the Persian Gulf crisis, a
fact known by "everyone on the market."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>He also disputed the perception that a Gulf war would
result in oil shortages. "The speculators should remind
themselves that both countries continued to produce and
export oil throughout the Iran-Iraq war, despite repeated
attacks on their oil facilities," he said, and predicted that
markets would soon realize this, leaving companies and
traders holding high-priced oil to face big losses. "They
will deserve no public sympathy," he said. "But in the
meantime, we are all suffering from their misguided actions."</p>
<p>The International Energy Agency on Friday is to discuss
oil stocks, but the EC commission isn't viewed as likely to
recommend releasing strategic stocks to push prices down.</p>
