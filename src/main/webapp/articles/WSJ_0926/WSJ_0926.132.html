	<p class="article-leader">The French energy group Total-Cie. Francaise des Petroles
(CFP) reported that its consolidated profit for the first
half of 1990 fell 33% to 1.27 billion francs ($244 million)
on an attributable basis, compared with 1.91 billion francs a
year earlier.
   Total-CFP noted, however, that the latest results were
largely influenced by regular accounting adjustments in the
value of its petroleum inventories, which lopped 1.4 billion
francs off its earnings in the first half after having added
1.7 billion francs a year earlier. These latest adjustments,
which reflect changes in the market price of oil, are
expected to be offset during the second half of the year by
price rises tied to the Persian Gulf crisis.</p>
