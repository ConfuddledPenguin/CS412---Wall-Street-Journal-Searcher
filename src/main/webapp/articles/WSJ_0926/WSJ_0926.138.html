	<p class="article-leader">Aluminum Co. of America, Pittsburgh, disclosed details of
a joint venture with Kobe Steel Ltd. of Japan to produce
aluminum can stock, and said the companies will explore
broader cooperation, such as automotive applications.
   Alcoa and Kobe will make an initial equity investment of
10 billion yen ($72.8 million) in a new plant in Japan to
produce and market aluminum can stock, mainly for the
Japanese and Asian beverage container markets; the total
investment, including debt, wasn't disclosed. The 50-50
venture, KSL Alcoa Aluminum Co., is to begin production in
1993, with annual capacity of 180,000 metric tons; each ton
is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds. The companies also will
study forming a venture to produce aluminum products for the
automotive industry in Japan or the U.S. or both, and explore
technical exchanges in areas such as recycling.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For Alcoa, the region offers growth, as only 35% of cans
in Japan are made of aluminum, compared with 95% in the U.S.
Kobe, which imports aluminum ingot from various suppliers,
said it will get a stable supply from Alcoa.</p>
