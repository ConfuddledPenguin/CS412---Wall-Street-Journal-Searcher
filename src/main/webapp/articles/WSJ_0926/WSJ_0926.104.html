	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Lawmakers pushing legislation to tighten
fuel-economy rules for cars lost a procedural vote in the
Senate, dooming the bill's chances for this year.
   Separately, the Environmental Protection Agency released
data showing that nine of the 10 most fuel-efficient
1991-model cars are made in Japan.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Senate supporters of the bill fell three votes short of
the 60 needed to cut off a filibuster by opponents. The vote
was 57-42. The measure was opposed by the administration and
the auto industry.</p>
<p>The legislation, sponsored by Sen. Richard Bryan (D.,
Nev.), would require auto makers to increase the fuel
efficiency of their fleets 20% in the model year 1995 and 40%
by 2001.</p>
<p>Among other administration efforts against the bill,
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner two weeks ago called
a news conference to release studies asserting that the
measure would result in additional highway accidents and
deaths. And along with Energy Secretary James Watkins and
Environmental Protection Agency chief, William Reilly, Mr.
Skinner sent a letter opposing the measure to Senate leaders
this week.</p>
<p>Sen. Bryan said in an interview that "the administration
really brought out its heavy artillery" to defeat the bill.
Nonetheless, he said the vote indicated considerable support
for tougher fuel-economy standards among lawmakers, and he
added that he looked forward "to waging a new battle" for the
bill next year.</p>
<p>The auto makers were delighted by the Senate vote. A
spokesman for Toyota Motor Co. said, "It looks like the bill
is dead this year. We think {that is} great."</p>
<p>The fuel-economy bill, once viewed largely as an
anti-pollution measure, gained new momentum as an oil-saving
proposal in the wake of the Mideast crisis. Proponents were
buoyed two weeks ago when they won an earlier procedural vote
by a wider margin than expected. Following that vote,
however, the White House stepped up its lobbying, which
helped to defeat yesterday's effort.</p>
<p>Moreover, the bill's chances always were less certain in
the House, where it was pending before the House Energy and
Commerce Committee. Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), chairman
of that panel, is a longtime champion of the auto industry.</p>
<p>The EPA rankings listed the subcompact Geo Metro XFI as
the most fuel-efficient car, at 53 miles per gallon for city
driving and 58 mpg on the highway. The car is made by Suzuki
and sold by General Motors Corp.</p>
<p>Eight other Japanese-made cars and one from West Germany
rounded out the top-10 list. They are the Honda Civic CRX HF,
GEO Metro, Geo Metro LSI, Suzuki Swift, Honda Civic CRX HF,
Geo Metro LSI Con, Suzuki Swift, Daihatsu Charade and the
Volkswagen Jetta.</p>
<p>The 10 least fuel-efficient cars all come from Europe,
with the Lamborghini DB132/Diablo topping the list. It gets
nine mpg in the city and 14 on the highway, the EPA said.
Purchasers of this model have to pay a $3,200 gas-guzzler
tax.</p>
<p>The EPA figures on fuel efficiency have been released
annually since 1974.</p>
