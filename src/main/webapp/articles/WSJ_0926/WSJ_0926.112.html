	<p class="article-leader">Amoco Corp., the nation's fifth-largest oil company,
elected H. Laurance Fuller chairman and chief executive
officer.
   The 51-year-old Mr. Fuller, president of Amoco since 1983,
is known as a more gregarious executive than the current
chairman and chief executive, Richard M. Morrow, who has held
those jobs since 1983. "Larry could be an inspirational CEO,"
said Bryan Jacoboski, an oil analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in
New York. The job change is effective Feb. 27, when Mr.
Morrow retires.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As chairman, Mr. Fuller faces the job of improving the
performance of the company's oil and natural gas operations.
Also, like the rest of the industry, Amoco could face huge
environmental costs related to gasoline this decade. More
immediately, Amoco must figure out how to recover more of the
sharply higher crude costs encountered sicce the Iraqi
invasion. So far, the company has passed on only some of the
increase in the form of rising gasoline prices.</p>
<p>In an interview, Mr. Fuller said, "The exploration and
production business is the one with the greatest challenge."
He added, "The rate of return we've had since the early '80s
is not adequate."</p>
<p>The company needs to reduce its oil-finding costs, he
said. Unlike other oil giants, Amoco remains largely a
domestic exploration company, though in the past few years it
has made roughly two-thirds of its exploration expenditures
outside the U.S., compared with one-third in the past.</p>
<p>"That's the direction of the future," Mr. Fuller said.
Despite the surge in oil prices to nearly $40 a barrel, Mr.
Fuller said Amoco is making its long-term exploration plans
based on prices in the low to mid-$20s.</p>
<p>Amoco became the largest holder of natural gas reserves in
North America after it acquired Canada's Dome Petroleum in
1988 for $4.2 billion, but much of those reserves remain in
the ground. "The challenge is to take those gas reserves and
turn them into production," said Mr. Jacoboski, the
PaineWebber analyst.</p>
<p>Mr. Fuller said there isn't enough available pipeline
capacity to move some of Amoco's gas, so the company may take
equity interests in planned pipeline projects to speed their
construction. Amoco also will open a Houston operation in
October to try to improve natural gas sales.</p>
<p>In gasoline refining and marketing, where Amoco is
acknowledged to have a leading operation, short-term earnings
are being hurt because the company has been able to pass just
two-thirds of the huge increase in crude oil costs through to
gasoline prices, Mr. Fuller said.</p>
<p>He added, however, "I would not represent that we're not
able to make money under these circumstances."</p>
<p>Longer term, Mr. Fuller said Amoco may have to spend $1
billion to $2.5 billion on "environmental gasoline" through
the mid-1990s, depending on the outcome of the Clean Air
legislation in Washington.</p>
<p>Mr. Fuller, who has a chemical engineering and law degree,
joined Amoco in 1961. He has held corporate posts since 1981
and was named head of the company's gasoline refining and
marketing business in 1978.</p>
<p>"His first major management job was head of the refinery
in Casper, Wyoming," recalled John Swearingen, chairman of
Amoco until 1983. "I sent him out to Casper, a year later he
had everybody eating out of his hand."</p>
<p>Mr. Fuller said he will retain his position of president.
"I don't think it will be long before we look at the
structure of the organization," he said, adding he would
contemplate changes in senior management between now and
February.</p>
