	<p class="article-leader">GAITHERSBURG, Md. -- Optelecom Inc. said its president and
chief operating officer, George Konkol, will retire as soon
as the company chooses a successor.
   Mr. Konkol, who will be 67 years old next month, joined
the maker of communications equipment and laser systems in
1985. He said his departure isn't for health reasons or
because of any unhappiness about his relationship with the
company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I've been here five years now," he said, "and I think a
young, vigorous company like this one should have younger
leadership." He noted that William H. Culver, Optelecom's
chairman and chief executive officer, is 64.</p>
<p>After his successor is named, the company said, Mr. Konkol
will serve as a consultant "for a period of time to be
mutually agreed upon."</p>
<p>Optelecom said its board has formed a search committee
that is "actively reviewing" candidates.</p>
