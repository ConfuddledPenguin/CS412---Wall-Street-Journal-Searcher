	<p class="article-leader">Why should the end of the Michael Milken prosecution be
any less bizarre than the initial outrage of RICOing
investment bankers? Judge Kimba Wood is scheduled to sentence
Mr. Milken on Monday, but first prosecutors want hearings on
why she should jail Mr. Milken for crimes he did not admit.
Prosecutors who originally sought a sentence of 520 years
have decided the only "trial" they will risk is a sentencing
hearing without niceties such as a jury or presumption of
innocence.
   If Judge Wood considers the government's arguments on a
sentence based on Mr. Milken's non-pleas, she must first hold
hearings on whether the charges are likely true. Despite
due-process problems, courts sometimes allow Fatico hearings,
named for Carmine Fatico. He pleaded guilty to hijacking
trucks; then a judge held a post-plea hearing on whether he
also was a fully initiated member of the Gambino Mafia crime
family.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Judge Pierre Leval refused to hold Fatico hearings before
he sentenced Robert Freeman. Mr. Freeman agreed to a plea
based on his "Your Bunny has a good nose" conversation. Judge
Leval refused to let prosecutors file a sentencing memo
claiming 20 other crimes, noting that "the government had the
opportunity to charge the defendant with those 20 crimes" and
that he would be "simply incapable of resolving these
disputed issues."</p>
<p>Mr. Milken's prosecutors have a 215-page sentencing memo
that tries to justify the original indictment on 98 counts
including RICO and insider trading. Mr. Milken refused to
admit any racketeering or insider trading. The good news for
Mr. Milken is that the 129-page response from his lawyers
released yesterday starts to clear the air about what he did
and what he did not do:</p>
<p>-- Mr. Milken's lawyers note that prosecutors still accuse
him of insider trading in several securities including Viacom
and Lorimar. They say this is despite the evidence by the
traders involved, now the government's own witnesses, who say
the trades were legal and that they never discussed them with
Mr. Milken.</p>
<p>-- Prosecutors could not gather enough evidence linking
Mr. Milken to allegedly illegal activities by
Princeton/Newport. The Milken memo notes that they want Judge
Wood to "assume" that Mr. Milken was somehow involved based
in part on a phone call in 1978, six years before the alleged
offenses.</p>
<p>-- In their reply memo, Mr. Milken's lawyers accuse
prosecutors of extraordinary overreaching. In addition to the
abusive use of the anti-Mafia RICO law, they make the serious
accusation that "many of the allegations presented by the
government relate to incidents that we believe are not
`crimes' under federal statutes."</p>
<p>Prosecutors seeking a sentence for crimes Mr. Milken
refused to admit is par for the course in this prosecution.
Rudolph Giuliani twisted RICO to coerce a plea from Drexel
Burnham Lambert and testimony from others. Prosecutors
indicted Mr. Milken's brother Lowell as a hostage. They even
sent an FBI agent to pressure Mr. Milken's 92-year-old
grandfather. The battle over Mr. Milken's non-admissions is
another reason that after all the publicized investigation
prosecutors should have taken this case to trial.</p>
<p>How much punishment does Mr. Milken deserve? Anything like
the maximum 28 years would be absurd. Unlike Ivan Boesky,
Dennis Levine and Martin Siegel, Mr. Milken was not convicted
of insider trading. Mr. Boesky made more than $80 million by
trading cash -- often literally in suitcases -- for the
inside information bankers Levine and Siegel stole from their
clients. All three knew they were committing serious,
entirely nontechnical crimes.</p>
<p>So Mr. Boesky's three-year sentence should establish a
high ceiling for Mr. Milken's punishment. Indeed, Judge Wood
might note that despite prosecutors analyzing hundreds of
transactions where Mr. Milken had enormous inside information
on takeovers, they could not prove he traded on any of it.</p>
<p>Mr. Milken committed crimes, but these were chiefly
accommodations for more serious lawbreaking by others,
including Mr. Boesky. Most of the crimes in years past would
have been dealt with by stern letters from the Securities and
Exchange Commission. There are few, if any, victims. Even the
clearly illegal fudging on the commissions Drexel got from
the Finsbury Fund (legal if disclosed) amounted to several
hundred thousand dollars.</p>
<p>Judge Wood has hundreds of letters on the sentence Mr.
Milken deserves. These overwhelmingly urge a light sentence.
There are few letters from clients claiming Mr. Milken did
them wrong. Letters from public-school teachers and hospital
administrators cite Mr. Milken's volunteer work and often
anonymous charitable donations, which predated his legal
troubles. Letters from former Drexel colleagues remind the
judge that Mr. Milken criticized recent overly leveraged
takeovers, which he called "Xeroxes" of earlier successful
financings that ignored changed circumstances.</p>
<p>The most provocative information may be what was redacted
or censored from the sentencing memos. There is a single
reference to a probation report in Mr. Milken's memo. This is
followed by blackouts wherever it seems there might be a
reference to favorable conclusions of a probation officer.
These findings are confidential, but there are reports that
it concludes Mr. Milken's contributions outweigh his crimes.
This first assessment by a neutral observer may help explain
why prosecutors want more hearings.</p>
<p>Mr. Milken has already suffered from the years of legal
battles. Indeed, consider the $1.1 billion prosecutors said
he earned from 1984 to 1987. Subtract from this the $600
million fine Mr. Milken agreed to pay, the $500 million he
probably paid in state and federal taxes and the $300 million
his aides say he gave to charities. Grand total: minus $300
million, not counting his legal bills.</p>
<p>What would be an appropriate sentence? Mr. Milken's
lawyers suggest taking up the invitation of Los Angeles
Police Chief Daryl Gates to sentence him to community service
on an anti-drug program.</p>
<p>Whatever the punishment, Judge Wood's sentencing will at
least be the first legitimate legal action against Mr.
Milken. The contribution to justice from prosecutors in this
case includes RICO, unconstitutionally freezing Mr. Milken's
salary, helping drive Drexel into liquidation and threatening
Mr. Milken with the smear of lawsuits blaming him for the
savings-and-loan crisis. It is time for a judge to try to
craft some justice after a prosecution that knew no bounds.</p>
