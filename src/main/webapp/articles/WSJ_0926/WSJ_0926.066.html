	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK BANCORP Inc. directors declared an initial
quarterly dividend of 25 cents a share. The payable and
record dates are to be set if regulators clear the move by
the holding company for Home Federal Savings Bank. New York
Bancorp, which converted to stock ownership from mutual
ownership in February 1988, had nearly 3.2 million shares
outstanding at June 30, 1990.</p>
