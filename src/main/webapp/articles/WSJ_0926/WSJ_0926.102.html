	<p class="article-leader">Grown Kids at Home?
   Most Parents Don't Mind</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>MOST PARENTS are happy to have adult children living with
them -- but there are important exceptions.</p>
<p>William Aquilino and Khalil Supple of the University of
Wisconsin's Center for Demography investigated relationships
in a representative sample of over 600 families where parents
had "co-resident" young adult children, ones between ages 19
and 34. They asked the parents about the frequency of
disagreements and quarrels, whether there was much shouting
and bad blood, the amount of pleasurable time spent with the
adult children and in general how well the living
arrangements were working out.</p>
<p>The result: A full 70% of the parents were well satisfied
with the co-resident situation. Only one in four reported
disagreements as often as once a week, and the intensity of
the arguments "appeared to be quite low." Moreover, most of
the parents recounted frequent enjoyable conversations and
shared leisure activities with the child.</p>
<p>If the children were unemployed or otherwise financially
dependent, however, parent-child conflict increased. The
return home of a divorced or separated child often strained
relationships, too -- particularly with fathers. If
grandchildren were also brought back into the nest,
additional strain was reported by both mothers and fathers.</p>
<p>Poor Mothers Share</p>
<p>Traits, Aid or No</p>
<p>WELFARE MOTHERS and poor mothers not on welfare have many
characteristics in common.</p>
<p>Child Trends, a nonprofit research organization based in
Washington, analyzed several large government surveys to see
how women getting help from the government's Aid to Families
with Dependent Children program differed from poor mothers
not receiving such help and also from mothers with greater
incomes.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, both the AFDC and the other poor mothers
tend to be younger than mothers who aren't poor, consisted of
larger proportions of minorities, had less schooling and did
less well on intelligence tests, and had somewhat larger
families (though not as large as in former years, the
researchers note).</p>
<p>What was unexpected, though, were the many similarities
between the two impoverished groups. For example, 31% of each
group had their first child before they were 17 and another
one-fourth before they were 20. Nearly one-third of each
group held the traditional attitude that mothers of young
kids shouldn't work, and another 30% leaned that way.</p>
<p>Just about half of each group had finished high school and
another 12% had some college as well -- figures the analysis
characterizes as "higher than often assumed." Despite this,
intelligence test scores of both the AFDC mothers and the
non-welfare poor mothers were well below average and almost
identically so.</p>
<p>But there were differences between the AFDC mothers and
the other poor mothers, of course. Many more AFDC mothers had
never been married, while many more non-AFDC poor were
divorced, separated, or widowed. More AFDC mothers were black
or Hispanic, and the AFDC group was also more likely to have
alcohol-related problems.</p>
<p>States of Health Vary</p>
<p>From State to State</p>
<p>MINNESOTA and Utah are the healthiest states, Alaska the
least healthy.</p>
<p>So says a complex rating system developed by Northwestern
National Life Insurance Co. The system, worked out with the
help of a panel of health experts, ranks states on the basis
of weights assigned to 17 different components of health,
subdivided into five broad categories: life style, access to
health care, incidence of major diseases, extent of disabling
injuries and sicknesses, and death rates. Included in life
style, for instance, are the prevalence of smoking, amount of
violent crime, number of auto deaths, prevalence of obesity
and other factors contributing to heart disease, and
percentage of high school graduates.</p>
<p>Utah won a tie for first place for overall healthiness by
coming in first in the life-style category and ranking well
on mortality, disease and disability, though it was only 20th
on access to health care. Minnesota tied with Utah by getting
high grades on disease, mortality, access to health care, and
life style, though it didn't do so well on the disability
scale.</p>
<p>New Hampshire and Hawaii were close behind the top two,
followed by Nebraska, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Wisconsin
and Iowa. Connecticut ranked first on access to health care,
North Dakota had the lowest death rates, Wyoming had the best
record on major diseases, and Hawaii had the least
disability.</p>
<p>Other than Alaska, the states ranked the worst were West
Virginia, Mississippi, Nevada, Louisiana and New Mexico.</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>AVERAGE child-support payments by absent fathers increased
16% in real terms from 1985 to 1987, the Census Bureau
reports. This contrasts with a drop of 12% from 1983 to 1985.
. . . Catholic schools enroll 54% of all private school
students, according to the Department of Education. Other
religious schools account for 30% and nonsectarian schools
for the remaining 16%. . . . Elderly white women in the
Southeast suffer substantially more hip fractures than those
in the North, University of Illinois epidemiologists
discover. They admit they have found no good explanation for
this variation. . . . The government's Agency for Health Care
Policy estimates that over 13 million Americans, including
one out of six between the ages of 45 and 65, have a disabled
elderly parent or spouse.</p>
