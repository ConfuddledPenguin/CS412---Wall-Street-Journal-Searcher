	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon said the Soviet Union cut
overall defense spending last year by 4% to 5% and slashed
production of tanks, ammunition, helicopters and other
weapons.
   Nevertheless, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, in releasing
the department's annual review of the Soviet military, warned
that the Soviet Union remains a military threat that must be
countered.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The ninth edition of Soviet Military Power reported a cut
of between 6% and 7% in weapons procurement spending, a
halving of tank production to 1,700 from 3,500, and lesser
cuts in the output of fighter planes, bombers, artillery and
other important weapons. It also disclosed a "dramatic
decrease" in Soviet space launches and predicted that Moscow
will scrap as many as 450 navy ships by 1996 and cut 80,000
sailors from its navy.</p>
<p>The slick book still features photos of menacing Red Army
weapons, just as it has since it was first issued by the
Reagan administration to gather public support for the
military buildup of the 1980s.</p>
<p>But this year, the book also included photos of Soviet
troops leaving Eastern Europe, Soviet missiles being
destroyed to comply with arms-control treaties, and Soviet
bombers whose tails had been cut off to make them unusable.</p>
<p>The report, however, repeatedly noted that in some weapons
categories, especially strategic nuclear weapons, Moscow is
continuing to build strength and that even reduced output
levels for items such as tanks still top Western production
rates. It also stressed that the Soviets still field the
world's largest military force.</p>
<p>"What it does not reveal, no matter how much we might wish
it," said Mr. Cheney, "is an eviscerated Soviet force
structure and an evaporating threat . . . The Soviet Union
remains an enormous military superpower."</p>
