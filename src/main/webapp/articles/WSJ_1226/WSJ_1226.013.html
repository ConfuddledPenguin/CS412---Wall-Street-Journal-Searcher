	<p class="article-leader">OAK BROOK, Ill. -- Waste Management Inc. plans to have its
fast-growing international business and two other
majority-owned companies swap stakes, and the concern could
also take the overseas operations public within about one
year, the company said.
   In an interview, James E. Koenig, the parent company's
chief financial officer, said the moves are designed to help
finance Waste Management International Inc., which is
expected to report 1990 revenue more than doubled from last
year's $388 million, and to avoid having the three Waste
Management-controlled companies needlessly compete in foreign
markets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The two companies each granted an option to swap their
common shares for a 15% stake in Waste Management
International Inc. are Chemical Waste Management Inc., the
78%-owned hazardous waste handler, and Wheelabrator
Technologies Inc., a waste-to-energy and
environmental-services company in which Waste Management
recently increased its stake to 55% from 22%.</p>
<p>Without stakes in the overseas business, those two
companies could be compelled to open their own foreign
offices, which would be a costly duplication of effort, Mr.
Koenig said. Waste Management is investing heavily to
increase its domination over the garbage, hazardous waste and
other waste businesses, and keeping its costs down is crucial
to maintaining strong profits during this period.</p>
<p>For the first nine months of this year, net income was
$489.1 million, or $1.04 a share, after a $24.5 million
charge, on revenue of $4.2 billion. A year earlier, net was
$409.2 million, or 89 cents a share, on revenue of $3.3
billion.</p>
<p>Marc Sulam, an analyst at Kidder Peabody & Co. in New
York, said he expects the international unit to post 1990
revenue of about $900 million, and that revenue will rise to
between $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion next year for the unit.
The company has been acquiring garbage hauling operations,
particularly in Europe, where it hopes 1992 economic
unification will allow it to further expand.</p>
<p>The operations' value isn't clear because, although it is
growing rapidly, Waste Management International's profit
margins are about one-half of those of the company's domestic
solid waste business, Mr. Sulam said, in part reflecting cost
of doing business overseas. Nevertheless, the unit could be
valued at $2 billion or more by the time Waste Management is
ready to take it public in 1992, Mr. Sulam said.</p>
<p>Mr. Koenig, who said the earliest a public offering of
shares in the international unit could occur is 1992,
wouldn't estimate the value of the unit and wouldn't disclose
its profits.</p>
<p>Under the plan, Chemical Waste and Wheelabrator wouldn't
pursue customers outside of North America, but could share in
the foreign growth by owning a stake in the international
unit. Waste Management, while operating the companies
separately, is trying to get them to share customers and
technologies.</p>
<p>Chemical Waste and Wheelabrator's options are to buy the
15% stakes at a 15% discount of Waste Management
International's value, to be determined by outside
appraisals. They can exercise the option beginning Jan. 1,
1991.</p>
<p>In addition, as part of increasing its Wheelabrator stake
to 55%, Waste Management agreed to:</p>
<p>-- Help Wheelabrator obtain an "A" or better rating from
major credit rating agencies. Among other things, that could
involve Waste Management investing as much as another $200
million in Wheelabrator by buying subordinated debt
securities or preferred stock.</p>
<p>-- Sell its still-small medical waste business to
Wheelabrator at a 15% discount to its estimated value. The
medical waste business has sales approaching $50 million, but
could grow rapidly because Waste Management already has
garbage hauling contracts with many hospitals.</p>
