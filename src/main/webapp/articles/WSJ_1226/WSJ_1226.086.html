	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS (AP) -- AMR Corp.'s American Airlines charges that
its pilots are staging a sickout over stalled contract talks
and have contributed to flight cancellations, but the pilots'
union denies there's any organized protest.
   American management and the Allied Pilots Association have
been negotiating a revised contract for 14 months, but have
made little progress.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The increase in the number of pilots calling in sick,
coupled with bad weather, the holiday traffic crush and the
airline's loss of 230 pilots to Operation Desert Shield led
to an unusually high number of flight cancellations over the
weekend, said American spokesman Marty Heires.</p>
<p>At its hub at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport on
Sunday, the carrier canceled 37 arriving and 37 departing
flights, amounting to about 9% of its flights.</p>
<p>The Fort Worth-based carrier said the number of pilots
calling in sick over the weekend soared to record numbers,
almost 70% higher than normal, airline officials said.</p>
<p>Robert W. Baker, American executive vice president for
operations, told the Dallas Morning News that 529 of
American's 9,000 pilots were on sick leave Monday and about
500 called in sick over the weekend.</p>
<p>The typical pilot absentee rate is 250 during normal
periods and 300 during Christmas holidays, said Mr. Heires.</p>
