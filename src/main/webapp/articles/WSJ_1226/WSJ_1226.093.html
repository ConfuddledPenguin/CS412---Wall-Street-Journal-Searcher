	<p class="article-leader">MIAMI -- Carnival Cruise Lines Inc. expects to report
per-share earnings for the fiscal year ended Nov. 30 of about
$1.50 to $1.55, up from $1.44 in the previous year, said
Micky Arison, chairman and chief executive officer.
   In the year ended Nov. 30, 1989, Carnival had net income
of $193.6 million on revenue of $1.15 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Through the nine months ended this August, Carnival had
net of $1.39 a share, indicating that this year's
fourth-quarter earnings will be about 11 cents to 16 cents a
share. Net in the year-earlier fourth quarter was 16 cents a
share.</p>
<p>Mr. Arison said in an interview that the flat to lower
fourth-quarter results don't reflect trouble in the company's
overall cruise business, which he characterized as "good." He
said he is "very satisfied" with advance bookings, which
cover travel over the next six months or so.</p>
<p>Despite greater capacity -- this year the company has
added one new ship and a greater number of "berths," or beds
on another -- Carnival's bookings are currently at about the
same percentage of occupancy as this time last year, he said.</p>
<p>The trouble spot was the company's resort and casino
business in Nassau, the Bahamas. That business was "clearly
impacted by the economy," particularly by the economic
slowdown in the Northeast -- a key base of customers for
Carnival's Crystal Palace Resort & Casino in the Bahamas,
said Mr. Arison.</p>
<p>Discounting in the cruise industry has been more
widespread than normal in recent months, the chairman
conceded.</p>
<p>"We have been doing quite a bit of discounting on the
Mardi Gras and Carnival," said Mr. Arison, referring to two
of the company's older ships. "We would anticipate, to some
degree, {the discounting} will continue in that segment as
the economy stays soft."</p>
