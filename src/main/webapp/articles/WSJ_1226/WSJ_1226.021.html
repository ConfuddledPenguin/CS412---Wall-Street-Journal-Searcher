	<p class="article-leader">Pamela Quillin and Rob Hosinski got their baby through the
classified ads.
   Seeking an infant to adopt, the Sacramento, Calif.,
husband and wife pooled some money with several other
prospective adoptive couples to buy an ad in USA Today's
"Life" section.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The ad told women with unplanned pregnancies about "open"
adoption, in which the two sets of parents get to know each
other. A 26-year-old Georgia woman read the ad and responded.
A few months later, Ms. Quillin and Mr. Hosinski adopted her
baby.</p>
<p>Under the laws of some 20 U.S. states, publishing this
kind of ad is illegal, although offenders are rarely
prosecuted. Now a California adoption center is seeking to
change that state's law restricting adoption ads, claiming it
impedes a constitutionally protected communication of a
desire to adopt.</p>
<p>At a time when advertising has spread into just about
every corner of America -- from law to medicine to topless
models -- some people believe advertising for babies
represents a border that should never be crossed. "It's like
opening a bazaar, and children are the product," says Jim
Brown, chief of adoptions for California's department of
social services.</p>
<p>Yet proponents of adoption advertising say they're only
disseminating a message that otherwise gets short shrift in
the public debate about birth control and abortion. "We're
not forcing anyone to call us," says Bruce Rappaport,
executive director of the Independent Adoption Center in
Pleasant Valley, Calif. "We just want to make sure women know
the choice exists. We're doing what the state and federal
governments won't do -- funding adoption education."</p>
<p>In some states, including California, licensed agencies
alone can place adoption ads; attorneys, individuals or
unlicensed agencies are barred from ad pages. In other
states, advertising for babies by anyone is strictly
forbidden.</p>
<p>Yet even in states with rigid rules about such ads,
regulators say the ads constantly crop up in local and
regional newspapers. The regulators then call or write to the
newspapers, reminding them of the state's law, which usually
curtails the practice -- at least temporarily. Ads in
national publications like USA Today, which estimates it runs
some 500 a year, are technically illegal in some states, but
are mostly ignored by regulators. Us and Rolling Stone
magazines, with their youthful demographics, also publish
such ads.</p>
<p>The people who oppose such advertising worry that
prospective adoptive parents will vie for scarce healthy
white infants by pitching their life style as though it were
a competitive product. "Have large Victorian home, two lazy
cats, in a neighborhood filled with playmates. Summer
weekends at lakeside mountain camp, with doting grandparents
and cousins to play with," read one recent ad in USA Today.
"$$ Security, books/music, outdoor sports, holidays with
family and LOVE," read another.</p>
<p>Mr. Brown, the California adoptions chief, says he's
concerned that a pregnant woman might read about and choose
one couple, then another and another, leaving a trail of
bereavement behind her.</p>
<p>"Someone runs an ad saying `Two Harvard-educated
physicians are seeking an infant,'" says Mr. Brown. "A birth
mother says okay. Then someone runs an ad saying, `Two
Harvard-educated physicians with Oxford postgraduate
fellowships . . . .' The woman says, `That's even better.' We
see things like that now. Imagine what we'd see without the
law."</p>
<p>About 40% of the inquiries Diane Michelsen, a California
adoption attorney, gets from prospective birth mothers come
from advertising, according to a recent book, "An Open
Adoption," by Lincoln Caplan. Ms. Michelsen, in an interview,
confirmed that she advertises in college towns and areas with
high unemployment and tries not to advertise in places where
there has just been a catastrophe, such as a tornado or
hurricane. She also tries to advertise in places where the
physical characteristics of the native population might match
those of some prospective adoptive parents -- for tall,
Scandinavian-looking couples, for example, she might
advertise in Minnesota and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>"I love advertising -- I think it's a real appropriate way
to get people together," says Ms. Michelsen. "But it's true
that there are more attempted scams through advertising than
any other way of connecting birth mother and adoptive
parents."</p>
<p>Although in many states licensed agencies have the right
to advertise their services, most agencies that advertise at
all do so cautiously and conservatively, concentrating on the
Yellow Pages.</p>
<p>One exception is a Cherry Hill, N.J., adoption agency
called the Golden Cradle, which has advertised not only in
the Yellow Pages, but also on billboards, bus benches,
television, radio and in the classified pages. When the
agency first decided to advertise about 10 years ago, says
Marlene Piasecki, the agency's executive director, the Yellow
Pages wouldn't accept the ads even though they had a category
for abortion services.</p>
<p>"There was a tremendous uproar when we started
advertising," says Ms. Piasecki. "But our founder was an
entrepreneur, and he thought some of the same principles that
make an effective business could also make an effective human
service. People said, `That means you're selling a baby.' We
said, `No, we're offering a service, and sometimes it ends up
with an adoption taking place.'"</p>
<p>In Kentucky, which has one of the highest out-of-wedlock
birth rates in the country, not even licensed agencies are
allowed to advertise for babies. "It seems like a terribly
risky way to find adoptive homes for children," says Sue
Howard, adoption specialist for the state. Ms. Howard says
she herself approached USA Today to inform the paper that the
advertising it was carrying violated Kentucky law. "Someone
in the classified section told me, `Oh, we don't bother with
state laws,'" says Ms. Howard, who referred the matter to the
state attorney general's office.</p>
<p>A USA Today spokesman says the paper tries to protect
children with its strict guidelines about who can publish the
ads and what they say.</p>
<p>But to Pam Quillin and Rob Hosinski, a classified ad ended
five years of sadness and frustration and brought them a
daughter named Caitlin. "I called the county about adoption,
and they wouldn't even put my name on a list to get on a
list," says Ms. Quillin. Meanwhile, in Georgia, Caitlin's
birth mother had herself been frustrated by the attitude of a
local agency, which urged her to give up any concerns about
the fate of her baby.</p>
<p>"I would never presume to tell someone what to do about an
unplanned pregnancy," Ms. Quillin says. "But young women tend
not even to consider adoption. Advertising is a way of
letting them know it's there."</p>
