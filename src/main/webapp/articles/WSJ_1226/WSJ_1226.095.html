	<p class="article-leader">UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. -- MCA Inc. said the Federal
Communications Commission approved the spinoff of WWOR-TV,
clearing another hurdle on the way to completion of the
company's $6.59 billion acquisition by Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co.
   The Secaucus, N.J., television station is being spun off
to MCA shareholders because TV stations are prohibited from
being more than 20%-owned by foreign interests. MCA holders
are to receive an "equity stub" in the station in addition to
the $66 a share they receive when the tender offer is
completed. MCA has estimated the stub to be worth about $5 a
share; holders will receive one share of the new company for
every five MCA shares.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts believe the station will be sold within a short
period of time. MCA bought it for $386 million in 1987.</p>
<p>The acquisition of MCA by Matsushita is expected to be
completed anytime within the next three weeks. The Securities
and Exchange Commission still must approve the transaction,
and a hearing in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles set for
Friday will rule on one shareholder suit which hasn't joined
five others in a tentative settlement. The tender offer is
scheduled to expire Friday.</p>
<p>An antitrust suit filed by Go-Video Inc. seeking to block
the merger is on appeal after a federal court in Phoenix
denied a temporary restraining order. Another shareholder
suit which had claimed that foreign ownership of a U.S. media
company violated the U.S. Constitution was dismissed by a
federal judge in New York last Friday. A call by Interior
Secretary Manuel Lujan for a review of MCA's proposed
placement of its Yosemite Park and Curry Co. into escrow
pending its sale isn't thought to be an obstacle to
completing the merger.</p>
