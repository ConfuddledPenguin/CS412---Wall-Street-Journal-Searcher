	<p class="article-leader">What a year this has been for filers of absurd lawsuits
and prosecutors of noncrimes. In the spirit of the charitable
season, however, let's honor those whose creative energies
have challenged the law as it had been understood. Herewith
entries for the most brilliantly frivolous legal argument of
the year.
   There was the lawyer who sued Huntington Beach, Calif., as
a RICO racketeer after police there gave him three speeding
tickets. Other cases that have appeared in this space include
a Tennessee couple who sued a hospital for $4 million when
their newborn was temporarily and harmlessly dyed blue by a
medical procedure, then called a "Smurfette" by a nurse,
allegedly causing "distressing and permanent emotional
damage." And the federal prosecutors who forced a broker to
spend nearly a year in jail before federal judges announced
that being a fourth-hand tippee of insider information
violated no law because no such law exists.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Also consider the New York City man who fell drunk on a
subway track. He lost his arm when he was hit by a subway
train, so naturally sued the city's transit system for
damages. A jury decided that the accident wasn't his fault,
that a subway worker should have noticed his inebriated state
and forced him off the platform. The award for $9.3 million
was reversed by a party-pooping judge, who announced that the
"jury acted irrationally."</p>
<p>Then there is the case that wins the special-award
category of Whose Ox Is Suing? showing that the corporation
that complains about excessive litigation might be the next
plaintiff to gore another corporate defendant with a
rule-breaking lawsuit. In Travelers Insurance v. Budget
Rent-a-Car, a parking valet for a restaurant in Maui caused
an accident involving a rental car. The valet was not covered
by the Budget rental agreement that limited the number of
authorized drivers. Travelers paid the claim on behalf of the
restaurant, but then tried to collect from Budget. The
argument was that despite the clear language about who was an
authorized driver and who was not, judges should interpret
the contract as implying that a valet is covered.</p>
<p>Los Angeles federal appeals Judge Alex Kozinski would have
none of it. Contracts such as the rental agreement "are
useful only insofar as each side can count on being able to
hold the other to the terms of the agreement." The problem,
Judge Kozinski wrote, is that "increasing uncertainty through
judicial meddling raises insurers' costs of doing business;
inevitably those costs are passed on to customers."</p>
<p>The sharp-eyed Judge Kozinski noted that Travelers had
taken the opposite view of the law in a similar case in New
York in the 1970s where Allstate sued Travelers -- and,
surprisingly, won. "While parties are free to argue on good
faith whatever position they deem advantageous in a
particular case," Judge Kozinski said, "we doubt that such a
myopic litigation strategy contributes to the healthy
development of the law or serves the long-term interest of
those whose livelihood depends upon certainty and
predictability in the enforcement of commercial contracts."</p>
<p>These cases make honorable runnersup, but the envelope
please. The winner of the most frivolous case is Carroll v.
Otis Elevator, where Chicago federal appeals court Judge
Frank Easterbrook began his opinion with these enticing
words: "Those seeking to burlesque modern products liability
law could do no better than to examine this case."</p>
<p>Here goes. A clerk for a department store in downstate
Illinois was injured on an escalator when a child played a
prank by pressing the emergency stop button. The store
reimbursed the clerk for her medical expenses and lost wages
under the workers' compensation law, but she also sued Otis
for her pain and suffering. Her argument was that Otis should
have known better than to put a bright-red emergency button
on each end of the escalator.</p>
<p>There is a reason escalator manufacturers make emergency
stop buttons easy to find and press. They know that clothing
or fingers, especially of children, sometimes get caught in
the moving stairs. A quickly pressed button can avoid
injuries and even death. So buttons should be easy for
children to press, but common sense is no defense in today's
courtroom.</p>
<p>"For reasons best known to itself," Judge Easterbrook
noted, Otis limited its appeal to the narrow issue of whether
the trial judge erred by letting the plaintiff call an expert
witness to say that brightly colored buttons will entice
mischief. Otis lost the appeal. It was perhaps out of
exasperation with the Monty Pythonness of the legal arguments
here that Judge Easterbrook inserted into his opinion the
visual illusion reproduced nearby. The lines separating the
cubes don't look parallel, but they are; in principle, an
expert could show that children are somehow lured to press
bright escalator buttons.</p>
<p>Judge Easterbrook, a former University of Chicago law
professor, wrote that the real outrage with this case was
more fundamental than silly expert testimony: "Why should
escalator design be a question for juries?" Even with the
help of experts, juries and judges aren't likely to design a
better escalator. Easily found buttons might lead to rare
false stops, but will also help avoid more serious injuries.
"The ex post perspective of litigation exerts a hydraulic
force that distorts judgment," Judge Easterbrook wrote.
"Jurors see today's injury; persons who would be injured if
buttons were harder to find and use are invisible." A
plaintiff wins but the losers are those who "must pay higher
prices, who will be deprived of beneficial products or who
will be injured in turn if manufacturers change their designs
to be jury-proof."</p>
<p>The jury decided that Otis should pay some $43,000 in
damages. Yet no one expects Otis to change its
emergency-button design, which meets or exceeds industry
standards. Despite the judgment against it, Judge Easterbrook
wrote that "Otis won't (and shouldn't) color its emergency
stop buttons blue, or even pink; it won't (and shouldn't)
make them harder to push, or put them five feet off the floor
where toddlers can't reach them."</p>
<p>Instead, he said, this is another case where judges impose
liability "where they have never done before." Hard
experience shows that assessing liability where there is no
fault raises prices but also that the legal system rarely
acknowledges its own excesses. Judge Easterbrook concluded
his opinion with the hope inspired by so many cases these
days, that "state judges who are tomorrow's pathfinders will
take these comments as a skeptical report from the front."</p>
