	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- The Department of National Revenue for Customs
and Excise said a "dumping" investigation has been initiated
regarding certain stainless-steel welded pipe originating in
or exported from Taiwan. Dumping is the selling of a product
in a foreign market at a price lower than the cost of
production or the domestic price.
   The investigation follows a complaint filed by Associated
Tube Industries, a division of Samuel Manu-Tech Inc. of
Toronto, alleging the injurious dumping of these goods. A
decision to end the investigation or to make a preliminary
determination of dumping is expected within 90 days.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The department also has asked the Canadian International
Trade Tribunal to judge whether there was sufficient evidence
of injury to initiate this investigation. If the tribunal, in
making its decision within 30 days, indicates evidence wasn't
sufficient, the case will be terminated.</p>
