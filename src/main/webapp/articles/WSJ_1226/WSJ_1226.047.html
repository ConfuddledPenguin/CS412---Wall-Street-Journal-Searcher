	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- Most places, it's only rock 'n' roll. In France,
it's an urgent question of public policy.
   The problem here has been the embarrassing failure of the
private sector to come up with a French mega-star to rival
Madonna and Michael Jackson. So 18 months ago the government
decided to take matters into its own socialist hands and
appoint the nation's first Minister for Rock 'n' Roll.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The bureaucrat who holds this unofficial title is Bruno
Lion, a clean-cut, 27-year-old one-time amateur bass-guitar
player, who also holds some degrees from the Sorbonne. As
assistant to Culture Minister Jack Lang, Mr. Lion was given a
budget of 40 million francs ($8 million), a fax machine and a
computer (but no stereo) and was charged with the formidable
task of making French rock roll. His dream is that one day
American stars will fight for air time against the likes of
Patricia Kaas, Guesch Patti and Vanessa Paradis.</p>
<p>Who?</p>
<p>These "vedettes" of French rock are hot stuff here, but
they're ice cold outside France, and that's where the
challenge lies. Mr. Lion says that by subsidizing rap groups,
remodeling rock clubs in Tours, sponsoring music festivals in
Nimes and holding concerts in Harlem (New York), his ministry
is "building the frame in which French rock music can
flourish" at home and abroad.</p>
<p>But a Minister for Rock 'n' Roll?</p>
<p>"French governments have always intervened to support
culture," says Mr. Lion, puffing a cigarette in his top-floor
office, "from early court concerts and opera through the
founding of the Ministry of Culture in 1959 by de Gaulle."</p>
<p>Indeed, spreading French culture, and above all the French
language, has long been a national priority. Even before Mr.
Lion was appointed, his boss floated an abortive idea for
quotas for French-language songs on radio and television.
Another Culture Minister, Francois Leotard, launched an
equally abortive campaign to force French TV stations to
subtitle in French any English-language rock videos they
broadcast.</p>
<p>Besides meddling in rock, the current Socialist government
supports a lot of nutty-sounding programs. There are
ministers for humanitarian action, for technological risks
and major natural disasters, for the sea, and for the
forests. But given France's minor-league status in global
rock, some here argue that a rock ministry is about as
appropriate to France as an Alpine ski team is to Holland.</p>
<p>"It's stupid, a complete waste of money," fumes Lionel
Rotcage, editor of the French-language version of Rolling
Stone magazine. "We're one of the only countries in the world
where the government feels it has to put its stamp on
culture. Rock music is by definition anti-establishment,
anti-institution, so how can you possibly institutionalize
it?"</p>
<p>Furthermore, says Mr. Rotcage, the French would be better
off sticking to traditional romantic ballads and leaving rock
riffs to the Americans and British who invented them.
"There's no reason for there to be French rock 'n' roll," he
says.</p>
<p>Mr. Lion is too busy to be rattled by such sentiments.
When he's not traveling around France persuading local
governments to find space for more rock clubs and music
halls, he's engaged in giving seed money to small French
record companies to back unknown groups -- like les Croaks,
Elmer Food Beat, Fly and the Tox, les Monotones and
Loudblast, each of which recently received $8,000 in
government subsidies.</p>
<p>Or he's jetting to the U.S. to shake hands with French
rockers at a recent government-aided bash at Harlem's Apollo
Theater, where a glittery, invitation-only, French-speaking
crowd was on hand to cheer their home-grown talent, among
them Misses Kaas, Patti and Paradis. Unfortunately, these
stars were soundly upstaged by two Americans -- Cab Calloway,
singing "Minnie the Moocher" in English, and Grace Jones,
vamping her way through the Edith Piaf classic "La Vie en
Rose," mostly in French.</p>
<p>Mr. Lion may be facing a long and winding road, but he has
had some success. One group he helped discover is the Gipsy
Kings, which has a gold album in the U.S. Their music is more
Latin and African-influenced than classically French, but
they do live in Paris. Chico Bouchikhi, the band's leader,
says Mr. Lion helped promote a festival in Nimes where the
then-unknown group performed. "Rock is a part of the culture
like everything else," Mr. Bouchikhi says in defense of
government funding. As for Mr. Lion: "He listens to groups
before anybody else does."</p>
<p>Since "Monsieur Rock" came to office, there are 80 more
rock venues than before, more festivals, more new groups
recording and a few more records being sold outside France.
"Five years ago the only piece of French music you ever heard
outside our national boundaries was Ravel's `Bolero,'" Mr.
Lion contends.</p>
<p>He also is encouraged by the popularity of "world music,"
an eclectic blend of African, South American and other beats.
There's nothing especially French about it, but many of its
practitioners are based here. Mr. Lion's critics, however,
point out that by far the biggest-selling examples of "world
music" are "The Rhythm of the Saints" and "Graceland," both
by Paul Simon, an American.</p>
<p>Mr. Lion confronts this problem every day: The French go
gaga over Paul Simon, Madonna and Michael Jackson, but
Americans are indifferent to French rockers. Last year Mr.
Lion brought seven largely unknown French groups to New York
as part of the French Revolution Bicentennial celebrations.
They came, played and left, still largely unknown.</p>
<p>The biggest French stars, such as Johnny Hallyday, a
Gallic Elvis Presley now rocking into his late 40s, can pack
football stadiums in Paris but probably couldn't crowd a
phone booth in Pasadena. Lesser lights might conquer Belgium,
but rarely make it to Britain. Even Mr. Lion, who formerly
published an annual guide to the French music industry,
concedes he grew up listening to the Beatles, the Clash and
the Police, all British.</p>
<p>Still, there's time to change the course of rock history.
Mr. Lion's strategy is to encourage anybody who sings in
French, regardless of nationality. Local rappers are usually
of Algerian extraction; Mr. Lion recently handed out $400,000
to rap groups. And anyway, France has always been a vocal
melting pot. Of its biggest international stars, Edith Piaf
was half German, Yves Montand is Italian, Jacques Brel was
Belgian, and Charles Aznavour is Armenian.</p>
<p>A current bright hope is Ms. Kaas, whose mother is German.
Ms. Kaas is a star in France and the Soviet Union and "is on
the verge of making it big in Japan," says Mr. Lion. In time,
he thinks she'll be hitting it big in the U.S. with soulful
ballads like "D'Allemagne," (Of Germany):</p>
<p>Of Germany where the past is painful,</p>
<p>Of Germany where the future is an adventure,</p>
<p>Of Germany where I know forbidden meanings,</p>
<p>I know where the rifles sleep."</p>
<p>Skeptics remain unconvinced. "Patricia Kaas is great in
France," says Mr. Rotcage. "But is the teen-ager in Memphis
really going to buy a song sung in French by a girl from
Strasbourg about the difficulties of Franco-German
relations?"</p>
