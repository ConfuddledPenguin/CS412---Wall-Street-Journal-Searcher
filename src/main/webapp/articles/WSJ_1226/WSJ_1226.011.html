	<p class="article-leader">GROWTH MANAGEMENT elbows its way up the legislative agenda
in many states.
   Although budget and tax woes grab the biggest headlines,
two new surveys by the National Conference of State
Legislatures suggest that several issues of critical
importance to small business are emerging near the top of
many lawmakers' wish lists.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Among legislative leaders, interest grows significantly in
the issues of land use and how to manage growth. Leaders in
California, Florida, Hawaii, Maryland, Oregon, Rhode Island
and Washington identified both among their top priorities for
1991. Leaders in Arizona, California, Delaware, Maryland and
Pennsylvania say growth management is particularly important
for the longer-term interests of their states.</p>
<p>The issues "have been a fairly low profile kind of topic
before," notes Doug Sacarto, the NCSL's state-issues
director. But lawmakers say that failure to address them
"will lead to a backlash to stifle economic development," he
says.</p>
<p>In a separate survey, states' legislative-committee
chairmen continue to rank a half dozen small-business topics
very high for deliberation in 1991. For spurring economic
development, efforts to expand tourism and foreign trade
rated highest, followed by aid to distressed communities,
especially rural areas. Lawmakers in 29 states listed
assistance to start-up enterprises as important, and those in
27 states cited efforts to develop high-technology
businesses.</p>
<p>Next year's agenda on labor issues apparently again will
focus on corralling workers' compensation costs; 40 states
ranked that as their top labor issue. Other issues moving up:
family-leave policies for employees, job retraining and
employee drug testing. The small-business lobby favors a
workers' compensation overhaul and generally opposes
mandatory family-leave measures.</p>
<p>But interest wanes in helping troubled and mature
industries. Only nine states gave a priority label to issues
such as plant-closing legislation and state financing to help
turn around failing companies.</p>

<p>NEW ENGLAND, Mid-Atlantic states register big gains in
black-owned firms.</p>
<p>Nationally, the number of black-owned firms rose 38%
between 1982 and 1987, to 424,165 from 308,260, a new Census
Bureau report shows. Posting the strongest growth were
several New England and East Coast states, while Pacific
states showed the slowest growth.</p>
<p>New Hampshire led the nation with an 86% gain, spurred by
a proliferation of service-related businesses, though the
number of black-owned businesses there remains low at just
229. Wyoming, bringing up the rear, actually had a 10% drop
in such businesses, to 81 from 90.</p>
<p>Regionally, New England had a 68% increase in the
five-year period, followed by the Mid-Atlantic states of New
Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania, with a 50% increase, and
the eight-state South Atlantic region, at 47%. The slowest
growth came in the Pacific states, with a 23% increase; the
Great Lakes states, at 27%; and the South-Central states, at
28%.</p>
<p>California has the most black-owned businesses, 47,728,
followed by New York, 36,289, and Texas, 35,725. States with
fewer than 100 black-owned firms: North Dakota (the only
state without a black-owned manufacturing firm), South
Dakota, Montana, Wyoming and Vermont, the survey said.</p>

<p>ONE-STOP SHOPPING: Toledo, Ohio, officials have
established a Central Permit Center downtown that speedily
issues any of the city's 112 different permits. Previously,
people starting a business and other applicants had to go to
each department involved. Officials think the center may be
bringing in more permit fees because its convenience keeps
prospective applicants from giving up in frustration.</p>

<p>CLEANING UP: Arizona, South Carolina and Tennessee have
eased procedures allowing laundromats and dry cleaners to
dispose of unclaimed items. New Jersey moves to make it
easier for these firms to get rid of unclaimed carpets. And
Connecticut lawmakers reduce to one from two the number of
required inspections of dry cleaners by fire marshals,
reports State Net, which tracks legislation.</p>

<p>WARY WATCHDOGS: For three years, members of the Council of
Independent Business Owners in Asheville, N.C., have been
monitoring city and Buncombe County governing boards. The
upshot: The small-business group this month filed a petition
for a 10% cut in Asheville property taxes and asked that the
city council or Asheville residents vote on the plan early
next year. The business owners said their monitoring
convinced them "the only way to achieve a more frugal
government is through a forced reduction in funding."</p>

<p>STATES SEEK increasingly to link small business to
anti-illiteracy efforts.</p>
<p>A tax credit for Mississippi businesses went into effect
early this year and Colorado lawmakers are expected to
consider a similar measure to be introduced next month.
Businesses can write off 25% of any direct costs for
providing basic-skills training to employees.</p>
<p>Colorado's comprehensive literacy bill is expected to
include several other provisions to tap small-business help,
including grants for workplace literacy training. Jim
Henderson, a regional small-business advocate at the Small
Business Administration, says chances "are good" that some
form of literacy legislation will pass.</p>
<p>Mr. Henderson notes that about half the state's lawmakers
attended at least one of 15 literacy hearings around the
state this fall. A 1985 study placed the illiteracy rate for
Colorado adults at 8%, lower than the 13% national average,
but Mr. Henderson thinks it's actually higher.</p>
<p>In South Carolina, with a 15% adult illiteracy rate, the
governor's office has held talks with business owners to
promote literacy efforts.</p>
