	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- When President Bush and his advisers huddle
to talk about a possible Persian Gulf war, they naturally
discuss what kind of military strike would overwhelm Iraqi
troops occupying Kuwait.
   But periodically, a senior official says, they also
discuss the flip side of that issue: their desire to prevent
war from fully destroying or dismembering Iraq.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Bush and his top advisers worry -- as do many outside
analysts -- that any military campaign that tears apart Iraq
or leaves it too weakened could greatly enhance the power of
Iran and Syria and bring about a new regional instability as
dangerous as the current incendiary situation. "That is
something we've thought a lot about," says the senior Bush
aide. "We're not interested in destroying Iraq."</p>
<p>As a result, although the Bush administration has pledged
to use whatever power is necessary to prevail if war erupts,
it also is quietly hoping to calibrate its use of force to
drive Iraqi troops out of Kuwait swiftly and destroy some
Iraqi military power without bringing the entire country to
its knees.</p>
<p>That might prove to be an exceedingly difficult
undertaking. Military analysts say it's tricky trying to
calibrate military force that precisely once a chaotic war
situation is unfolding.</p>
<p>But a look at the map explains the desirability of such a
strategy. Iraq sits directly between Syria and Iran, two
equally ambitious and dangerous regional powers that might
literally gobble up pieces of a disintegrating Iraq. At a
minimum, Syria and Iran would be able to take advantage of
the void left by a dazed and staggering Iraq to expand their
own influence. Many experts believe that Syria and Iran are
as great a threat to U.S. interests in the region as Iraq.</p>
<p>In addition, northern Iraq is populated by a
Kurdish-speaking minority that has long sought its own nation
-- the same kind of Kurdish minority that lives in adjoining
parts of Iran and Turkey. A war that hobbles Iraq might
inspire a new drive among Kurds to carve out their own nation
-- a development that would alarm Turkey and Iran as much as
Iraq and could set off a violent reaction from them.</p>
<p>"If Iraq were truly dismembered you could have a scramble
for the remains and set off a secondary conflict," says
William Quandt, a Middle East analyst at the Brookings
Institution. "That could set off another round of fighting
among fairly substantial powers in the region."</p>
<p>Even those analysts who have been the most hawkish on the
showdown with Iraq share that view. "I don't want to leave
them completely wiped out," says Richard Perle, a former top
aide in the Reagan administration Pentagon who is part of an
ad hoc group urging that the U.S. maintain a credible
military threat against Iraq. "They are entitled to some
capacity to defend themselves."</p>
<p>The cohesiveness of Iraq is a question mark because modern
Iraq, though situated on the spot of the ancient civilization
of Mesopotamia, actually is a fairly young nation made up of
a sometimes uneasy ethnic mix and lands traditionally coveted
by others.</p>
<p>Turkish and Iranian regimes over the centuries have laid
claim to much of what is today Iraq. Saddam Hussein himself
proclaimed in a speech in 1980: "They used to take turns on
Iraq. Turkey goes and Iran comes; Iran goes and Turkey
comes."</p>
<p>And while Saddam Hussein buttresses his claim to Kuwait by
asserting that it is an artificial country created by British
colonialists, the fact is that Iraq's own borders are perhaps
an even more artificial colonial creation.</p>
<p>British diplomats sketched out the borders of today's Iraq
in the 1920s, mostly to serve the needs of the British empire
at that time. Iraq then was granted its independence in 1932.
But Baghdad governments ever since have had to struggle to
create a common identity among Iraq's diverse population of
Shiite Moslems in the south, Sunni Moslems in the center and
Kurds to the north.</p>
<p>Iraq's leaders have had some success in unifying these
groups. Most notably, they held Iraq together throughout the
pressures of an eight-year war with neighboring Iran, a
Shiite nation that actively tried to win over the loyalty and
territory of Iraq's Shiites.</p>
<p>Still, there is a risk that a war with a powerful
international coalition might unleash new forces and send out
unpleasant ripple effects.</p>
<p>For starters, Syria has been a bitter rival of Iraq in
recent years, and the two nations have served as a check on
each other's power and influence in the Arab world. If Iraq
is laid low, Syria's influence would increase. It's hard to
guess just how much. Israel still would serve as a check on
Syrian power. And a decline in Iraqi clout also would enhance
the power of moderate, pro-American Egypt inside the Arab
world -- a development that would please the U.S.</p>
<p>For those reasons, some analysts are more worried about
the chance that Iran might move in to lay claim to part of
Iraq if it were seriously weakened.</p>
<p>Even if Iran doesn't have any current plans for a land
grab, it might be drawn in once fighting starts. Shireen
Hunter, a former Iranian foreign service officer who now is
an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, doubts that Iran has any plans to claim any
territory. But she worries that if Iran suspects others are
going to try to slice off pieces of Iraq, such as its Kurdish
area, it may feel compelled to stake a claim of its own.</p>
<p>"If there is a scramble for the area, Iran may feel that
in order to protect itself it has to get involved," Ms.
Hunter says. Similarly, she worries that if Shiite holy sites
in southern Iraq are damaged in any fighting, Iran might feel
compelled to move in to defend such sites, if only in
response to popular opinion at home.</p>
<p>And at a minimum, a war that seriously weakens Iraq would
prevent it, at least temporarily, from continuing to serve as
the Arab world's main bulwark against Iranian efforts to
spread its version of Islamic rule around the region.</p>
<p>"Whatever one thinks of Saddam Hussein, it is indisputably
true that in the 1980s no one other than Iraq was willing to
stand up to an Iranian bid for hegemony in the gulf," says
Mr. Quandt of the Brookings Institution. "If Iraq is out of
the picture, then there isn't really any counterweight to
Iran."</p>
