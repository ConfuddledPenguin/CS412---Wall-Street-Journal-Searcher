	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Bond prices fell sharply Monday for the fourth
consecutive session in nervous pre-holiday trading.
   Traders said the increased likelihood of war in the Middle
East added to the pressures of year-end profit-taking and
looming supply, pushing yields on long-term bonds to the
highest levels in several weeks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell nearly 7/8
point, or $8.75 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The
yield on the benchmark bond, which was as low as 8.08% on
Dec. 12, rose to 8.36% from 8.28% Friday.</p>
<p>Shorter-term securities posted smaller declines. Prices of
two-year notes, for example, fell just 1/8 point.</p>
<p>Dealers said Monday's losses were exaggerated by the
extremely thin Christmas Eve trading conditions. The Public
Securities Association suggested a 2 p.m. EST close for the
government securities market, and many dealers closed their
trading desks an hour or two before that. Financial markets
were closed yesterday for the Christmas holiday.</p>
<p>Kevin Flanagan, a money market economist at Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc., said prices weakened Monday as investors sold
bonds to try to capture profits.</p>
<p>"It's the end of the year, so people have closed out their
books," Mr. Flanagan said. "They want to cash in and take a
portion of the profits" generated during the market's recent
13-week rally.</p>
<p>Bond prices also were hurt by heightened perceptions that
the U.S. will end up going to war with Iraq. Fanning their
fears were comments from officials in both countries. U.S.
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney warned Sunday that "the clock
is ticking" quickly toward war. Meanwhile, Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein said Tel Aviv will be Iraq's first target if
war breaks out in the Persian Gulf, whether Israel joins in
the war effort or not.</p>
<p>Some analysts say the market's poor tone might not improve
much this week because it will be hit with a large new supply
of securities. The Treasury is scheduled to sell a record
$12.5 billion of two-year notes today and a record $8.5
billion of four-year notes tomorrow.</p>
<p>In when-issued trading, the new two-year notes were quoted
to yield 7.28%, up slightly from Friday. The yield on the new
four-year notes was also quoted higher at 7.73%.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late
Monday at a price of 104 6/32, down from 105 Friday.</p>
<p>Three-month Treasury bills, however, moved in the opposite
direction as prices rose and rates continued to decline. The
average discount rate on three-month bills ended at 6.54% for
a bond equivalent yield of 6.72%, down from a discount rate
of 6.59% to yield 6.77%.</p>
<p>Six-month bill rates were little changed. The discount
rate on six-month bills ended at 6.64% for a bond equivalent
yield of 6.94%.</p>
<p>Corporate Bonds</p>
<p>Investment-grade corporate bonds finished with moderate
losses as slumping Treasury bond prices weighed on the
market.</p>
<p>Long-term high-grade issues registered losses of as much
as 5/8 point, but the declines weren't as steep as some of
those in the long-term Treasury market.</p>
<p>As a result, the spread, or difference in yields between
Treasury and corporate bonds, narrowed by as much as five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, traders said.</p>
<p>"With the long bond down nearly a point, corporate spreads
have definitely tightened," said one trader.</p>
<p>However, Robert Schwartz, senior financial economist at
Merrill Lynch & Co., said he wouldn't attach much
significance to the tightening.</p>
<p>It's fairly typical, he said, when the Treasury market
registers steep losses, for corporate bond movements to lag
and the spreads to tighten.</p>
<p>"I would think any price action you are seeing today
reflects nominal markups and markdowns rather than any real
trading," Mr. Schwartz said Monday.</p>
<p>He said it will be difficult to gauge spreads in the
corporate bond market until activity in the sector picks up
again after the first of the year.</p>
<p>Municipal Securities</p>
<p>Municipal bond prices ended an abbreviated session
unchanged to 5/8 of a point lower, dragged down by escalating
concerns about possible war in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Following Treasury issues downward in thin trading, the
New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% issue due in 2018 was
down 5/8 at 98 1/4 to 99 1/4, yielding 7.26%.</p>
<p>While the week's economic data are expected to prove
bearish for the economy and positive for the credit markets,
Mideast headlines may supersede and continue to dominate the
market's tone, traders say.</p>
<p>November durable goods data are scheduled to be released
tomorrow, and the leading economic indicators are set for
Friday release.</p>
