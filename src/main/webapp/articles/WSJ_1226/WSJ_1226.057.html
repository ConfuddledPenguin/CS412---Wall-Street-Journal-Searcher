	<p class="article-leader">MOSCOW -- Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev narrowly won
approval for constitutional changes that will give him vast
new powers and redesign the government.
   The Congress of People's Deputies, the nation's highest
legislative body, was expected to pass the president's
proposal, despite last week's startling resignation by
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, who warned that such
new powers could lead to a new, law-based dictatorship.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The vote among the 1,827 delegates scraped by with only 17
votes beyond the two-thirds majority needed to authorize
constitutional changes. Under Soviet parliamentary procedure,
elements of the proposal are still to be debated and some
could be amended before a final vote.</p>
<p>Since the congress started meeting on December 17, almost
every important vote has transpired in accordance with Mr.
Gorbachev's wishes. A hotly debated proposal for a new union
treaty that purports to permit real sovereignty for the
Soviet republics while retaining strong central control,
passed the congress in principle on Monday. The president's
proposal to hold two nationwide referenda on crucial
questions, the union treaty and private ownership of land,
was also approved.</p>
<p>The congress also voted to keep the official name of the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, rather than the "Union
of Soviet Sovereign Republics," despite the fact that several
republics that are seeking independence have already dropped
the word "socialist" from their own official names.</p>
<p>But for Mr. Gorbachev, enforcing such decisions is sure to
prove more difficult than winning them. Russian republic
leader Boris Yeltsin, the most popular politician in the
nation and often a direct rival to Mr. Gorbachev, said before
the vote that he wouldn't support the new powers. "I'm
against giving too much power to one man -- it's too risky,"
he told reporters at the congress.</p>
<p>Mr. Yeltsin said the president was trying to push around
the Russian people, in particular with regard to the
referendum on land and property reform. Exactly how or when
such referenda would be conducted, or how its results would
be applied, aren't clear. But the vast Russian Federation,
which includes more than half the Soviet population, has
already approved its own concept of private land ownership
and is drawing up legislation to let farmers own land and
pass it on to their children.</p>
<p>The congress's decisions reveal how conservative the
legislative body is, and increasingly how it fails to reflect
the sentiment in the republics it represents. Created less
than two years ago, the congress is composed of 2,200
delegates, about two-thirds of them elected representatives
and the remainder appointees from major Soviet institutions
such as labor organizations and the Academy of Sciences. At
the time, the Communist Party was still the only legal
political organization and voters had had almost no exposure
to democratic methods. Liberals say a new election should be
held based on multiparty politics permitted since February.</p>
<p>This congressional session is particularly out of step
with national trends, as delegations from some of the most
independence-minded republics -- the Baltics, Georgia,
Armenia and Moldavia -- have either walked out or boycotted
the meeting. A roll call taken Tuesday showed that 730
delegates registered themselves within the Communist Party
faction, 561 aligned with the right-wing group Soyuz, or
Union, and only 229 considered themselves part of the radical
Interregional Group of Deputies. Many members of that group
are among the delegations boycotting the congress.</p>
<p>The congress revealed its greater allegiance to the center
than to republican governments in its vote on an integral
element of government structure that was designed to give
republics a stronger voicethe Federation Council. That
council was originally conceived as an organization
subordinate to the president and comprised of the heads of
the 15 republics, which would coordinate and carry out
republican policies. The congress voted to expand the council
to include representatives of 38 autonomous republics,
regions and areas, which will turn it into a huge and
unwieldly structure. Many of those autonomous areas are
seeking sovereignty from the republics in which they are
located, preferring to ally with the center in hopes of being
granted full-fledged republic status.</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev did lose nominally on a couple of issues
Tuesday: on establishing a control commission to monitor the
implementation of laws, and granting executive powers to a
new position of vice president. But many delegates expect
that, as often happens, he might return with re-worded
proposals this week for another vote, which could go in his
favor.</p>
<p>Worries that Mr. Gorbachev has been drifting toward
conservatism in recent weeks were heightened Saturday, when
KGB chairman Vladimir Kryuchkov gave a lengthy speech
denouncing dangerous foreign interference in Soviet affairs
and economic sabotage and warning against the breakup of the
union. On Tuesday he held a rare solo press conference in
which he deftly evaded questions asking him to substantiate
his accusations.</p>
<p>"It's strange how people understand things," he said. "I
didn't say economic sabotage from the West, I said it
resembles economic sabotage and that isn't one and the same
thing." The Soviet intelligence director said he favored
cooperation with Western business while attacking unnamed
"unscrupulous" firms.</p>
<p>He took an unusually long perspective on Soviet history,
justifying the union by linking it to the pre-1917 revolution
days of the Russian empire. "The union is our great
achievement. It was formed during more than one century."</p>
<p>The KGB chief dismissed Mr. Shevardnadze's warnings of an
advancing dictatorship. "If life has become abnormal, maybe
some extraordinary measures may become necessary," he
continued. "But I am convinced that if our president does
introduce extraordinary measures, it won't mean going back to
dictatorship. It will just mean restoring the order that
everyone is craving."</p>
