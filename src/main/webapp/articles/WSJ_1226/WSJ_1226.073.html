	<p class="article-leader">Calton Inc., Freehold, N.J., said it reached an accord
with lenders that would revise its $85 million secured credit
agreement by restructuring it and extending the term.
   Under the proposed restructuring, the interest rate on its
borrowings will rise to half a percentage point above the
prime rate from the current one-quarter of a point over the
prime, and the method of determining how much may be borrowed
will be changed. The revised agreement also prohibits Calton,
a housing developer, from paying dividends, incurring
additional debt or acquiring additional land without the
lending group's consent, except under certain circumstances.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The accord is conditioned on, among other things, Calton
entering into a definitive agreement to exchange certain
properties and joint-venture interests for about $18 million
face amount of its 16 5/8% senior subordinated notes by Jan.
10. Calton has said it has a nonbinding letter of intent to
acquire the notes and expects to have a definitive agreement
with the holder of the notes by Monday.</p>
<p>The accord with lenders would extend the credit agreement
until Dec. 1, 1991, from April 30, 1991.</p>
