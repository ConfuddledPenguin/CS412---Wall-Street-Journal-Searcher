	<p class="article-leader">Isuzu Motors Ltd. said pretax earnings in the fiscal year
ended Oct. 31 tumbled 38% to 15.370 billion yen ($113.5
million) from 24.805 billion yen despite a 9.5% gain in
sales.
   Net income fell 49% to 7.640 billion yen, or 7.41 yen a
share, from 14.977 billion yen, or 16.30 yen a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales amounted to 1.196 trillion yen, in contrast with
1.092 trillion yen in the previous fiscal year.</p>
<p>Isuzu, Japan's medium-sized maker of cars and trucks,
plans to keep its dividends for the year unchanged at five
yen.</p>
<p>Company officials said sales were strong during the year
owing to Japan's sustained economic growth as well as robust
demand overseas.</p>
<p>However, they added, growing material, personnel and
research and development costs cut deeply into earnings.
Those costs came to some 26.3 billion yen, officials said,
more than the gains amounting to about 22 billion yen
resulting from cost cutbacks and better production
efficiency.</p>
<p>In addition, they noted, extraordinary gains, which
included those from the sales of fixed assets and securities,
plunged to 3.536 billion yen from 12.481 billion yen in the
prior fiscal year, though extraordinary losses also dwindled
sharply, to 6.046 billion yen from 12.329 billion yen. Among
those losses were depreciation on company investments and
retirement pension payments.</p>
