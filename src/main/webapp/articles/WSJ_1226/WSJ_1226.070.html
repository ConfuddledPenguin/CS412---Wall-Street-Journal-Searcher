	<p class="article-leader">DUTCH HOSTAGE CONTROVERSY</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Netherlands plans to charge nationals held hostage for
months in Baghdad for the cost of their hotels, but the
former captives say they won't pay.</p>
<p>"We'll organize as a group against it," one angry former
hostage, identified only as L. Roskam, was quoted as telling
a Dutch newspaper. The Dutch Foreign Ministry said it didn't
yet know the total cost of the hostages' involuntary stay in
Baghdad but had already been billed for about $47,000 by
hotels.</p>
<p>"The hostages were offered accommodation in Dutch
Embassy-owned buildings, which would have been free, but most
did not take up the offer, so we will pass on to them the
cost of their hotel bills," a ministry spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>About 160 Dutch hostages were held in Iraq, but 105 of
them were sailors who lived aboard dredgers under contract to
deepen the navigation channel to the southern Iraqi port of
Umm Qasr.</p>
<p>IN FRANCE, A HOLIDAY WARNING</p>
<p>A French radio station warned New Year revelers to beware
of flying champagne corks. "Eye trauma by champagne cork is
the main cause of eyes lost in this country," radio
France-Infos told listeners in a list of holiday safety tips.
"You aim the bottle in jest at someone near you when opening
it and -- pop -- off it goes into their eye or into yours."</p>
<p>HONG KONG TOURISM IMPROVES</p>
<p>Tourist arrivals in Hong Kong totaled 5.4 million in the
year's first 11 months, the Hong Kong Tourist Association
said. That figure was up 10% from the same period in 1989,
when tourism to the region fell sharply following the
suppression of China's democracy movement. Despite the marked
growth in tourism so far this year, visits by North
Americans, considered to be among the biggest spenders, were
off 2%. The numbers of tourists from Japan and Taiwan, who
together account for more than two-fifths of all visitors,
were up 13% and 18%, respectively.</p>
<p>ILLEGAL SOVIET PAYMENTS</p>
<p>The Soviet State Bank warned foreign banks and financial
institutions not to accept illegal payments in rubles from
Soviet banks and businesses. The bank said Soviet enterprises
have recently tried to make tens of billions of rubles of
payments to foreign companies, claiming they have the
government's backing. Soviet law forbids anyone, be it an
individual or a business, from exporting more than 30 rubles
without special permission. The Soviet Union is concerned
about an accumulation of rubles abroad, which could be dumped
back into the economy without notice.</p>
<p>`COME TO ISRAEL'</p>
<p>Israel's ambassador to Bonn, Benjamin Navon, said Israel
was troubled that Soviet Jews fleeing anti-Semitism and
dismal living conditions were streaming to newly united
Germany. In an interview with the Berlin daily Neue Zeit, Mr.
Navon said the Soviet Jews' fleeing to Germany "is contrary
to the Zionist position that since the state of Israel has
existed, there can be no more Jewish refugees in the world."
He added: "The issue of refugees is totally unacceptable for
us. If they leave the Soviet Union, they should come to their
old and new homeland Israel, where they are wanted and
loved."</p>
<p>FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN INDONESIA</p>
<p>Indonesia has approved $8.7 billion of foreign investments
in 1990, a jump of 84% over the 1989 figure, the chairman of
the nation's Coordinating Investment Board said. Sanyoto
Sastrowardoyo said Japan was the biggest foreign investor in
Indonesia in the period, with a total investment of $2.23
billion in 75 projects. Following were Hong Kong with $993.3
million in 36 projects, South Korea with $720.9 million in 85
projects and Taiwan with $616 million in 93 projects.</p>
<p>DRUG SWEEP IN IRAN</p>
<p>More than 1,900 alleged drug traffickers and 16,000
addicts were arrested in Iran in a five-week nationwide
sweep, Tehran Radio reported.</p>
<p>The broadcast quoted the Komiteh, the organization
responsible for internal security, as saying that more than
1,653 pounds of various drugs were confiscated in the
crackdown. The radio said 57 guns and 80 vehicles also were
seized.</p>
<p>Iranian law calls for a mandatory death sentence for
possession of drugs. More than 1,500 people accused of drug
trafficking have been hanged in the past two years, and more
than 100,000 people accused of being addicts have been sent
to hard labor camps.</p>
<p>Iranian opposition groups and independent human-rights
organizations maintain the executions actually are carried
out to crush political opposition.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>The South Korean government marked Christmas by releasing
470 prisoners and juvenile delinquents in a general amnesty,
the Justice Ministry said. However, political prisoners and
those jailed for organized crime, drug use and burglary were
excluded from the special pardon. . . . Albania plans to make
its police independent from the ruling Communists as part of
the country's conversion to democracy after four decades of
Stalinism. "We will be independent and act according to the
laws and not according to the orders of the party," said
Police Commander Bajram Yzeri in Albania's capital city of
Tirana.</p>
