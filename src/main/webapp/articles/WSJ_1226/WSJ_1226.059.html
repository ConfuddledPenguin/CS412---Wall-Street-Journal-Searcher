	<p class="article-leader">Clemson University's football program was placed on
probation last spring for the second time in six years, and
the coach who guided the team to a national championship in
1981 quit or was forced to resign. Last season's Heisman
Trophy winner played at the University of Houston, a school
banned from TV and postseason bowl appearances by the
National Collegiate Athletic Association; Southern Methodist
University fields a team barely resurrected last fall from
the "death penalty" it received three years ago; and scandals
have rocked the basketball programs at Kansas, Kentucky,
Memphis State and North Carolina State.
   Each of these events, which are only the latest in a
series of NCAA rules violations, has generated the usual
amount of hand-wringing about the apparent loss of amateurism
in college sports. Nostalgia for supposedly simpler times
when love of the game and not money was the driving force in
college sports has led to all sorts of reform proposals. The
NCAA's decision to require its member institutions to make
public athletes' graduation rates is perhaps the least
controversial example. Proposition 48's mandate that freshman
athletes must meet more stringent test score and grade point
requirements to participate in intercollegiate sports has
been criticized as a naked attempt to discriminate against
disadvantaged (and mostly minority) high-school graduates who
see athletics as a way out of poverty.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But whether or not one supports any particular reform
proposal, there seems to be a general consensus that
something must be done. If so, why stop at half-measures? I
hereby offer three suggestions for solving the crisis in
college athletics.</p>
<p>1. Create four-year degree programs in football and
basketball. Many colleges and universities grant bachelors'
degrees in vocational subjects. Art, drama and music are a
few examples, but there are others. Undergraduates who major
in these areas are typically required to spend only about one
of their four years in basic English, math, history and
science courses; the remainder of their time is spent in the
studio, the theater or the practice hall honing the creative
talents they will later sell as professionals.</p>
<p>Although a college education is no more necessary for
success in the art world than it is in the world of sports,
no similar option is available for students whose talents lie
on the athletic field or in the gym. Majoring in physical
education is a possibility, of course, but while PE is hardly
a rigorous, demanding discipline, undergraduates pursuing a
degree in that major normally must spend many more hours in
the classroom than their counterparts who are preparing for
careers on the stage. While the music major is receiving
academic credit for practice sessions and recitals, the PE
major is studying and taking exams in kinesiology, exercise
physiology and nutrition. Why should academic credit be given
for practicing the violin, but not for practicing a
three-point shot?</p>
<p>2. Extend the time limit on athletic scholarships by two
years. In addition to practicing and playing during the
regular football or basketball season, college athletes must
continue to work to improve their skills and keep in shape
during the off-season. For football players, these off-season
activities include several weeks of organized spring practice
as well as year-round exercise programs in the weight room
and on the running track. Basketball players participate in
summer leagues and practice with their teams during the fall.
In effect, college athletes are required to work at their
sport for as much as 10 months a year.</p>
<p>These time-consuming extracurricular activities make it
extremely difficult for college athletes to devote more than
minimal effort to the studies required for maintaining their
academic eligibility. They miss lectures and exams when their
teams travel and the extra tutoring they receive at athletic
department expense often fails to make up the difference.</p>
<p>If the NCAA and its member schools are truly concerned
about the academic side of the college athletic experience,
let them put money where their collective mouth is. The
period of an athlete's eligibility to participate in
intercollegiate sports would remain four years, but the two
additional years of scholarship support could be exercised at
any time during the athlete's lifetime. Athletes who use up
their college eligibility and do not choose a career in
professional sports would be guaranteed financial backing to
remain in school and finish their undergraduate degrees.
Athletes who have the talent to turn pro could complete their
degrees when their playing days are over.</p>
<p>3. Allow the competitive marketplace to determine the
compensation of college athletes. Football and basketball
players at the top NCAA institutions provide millions of
dollars in benefits for their respective institutions.
Successful college athletic programs draw more fans to the
football stadium and to the basketball arena. They generate
revenues for the school from regular season television
appearances and from invitations to participate in postseason
play. There is evidence that schools receive increased
financial support from public and private sources -- both for
their athletic and academic programs -- if their teams win
national ranking. There is even evidence that the quality of
students who apply for admission to institutions of higher
learning may improve following a successful football or
basketball season.</p>
<p>Despite the considerable contributions made to the wealth
and welfare of his or her institution, however, the
compensation payable to a college athlete is limited by the
NCAA to a scholarship that includes tuition, books, room and
board, and a nominal expense allowance. Any payment above and
beyond this amount subjects the offending athletic program to
NCAA sanctions. In-kind payments to players and recruits in
the form of free tickets to athletic contests, T-shirts,
transportation and accommodations are also limited. These
restrictions apply to alumni and fans as well as to the
institutions themselves. The NCAA also limits the amount of
money athletes may earn outside of school by curtailing the
use of summer jobs as a means by which coaches and team
supporters can offer higher wages to athletes.</p>
<p>The illegal financial inducements reported to be
widespread in collegiate football and basketball represent
conclusive evidence that many college athletes are now
underpaid. The relevant question is whether the current
system of compensation ought to remain in place. Allowing it
to do so will preserve the illusion of amateurism in college
sports and permit coaches, athletic departments and college
administrators to continue to benefit financially at the
expense of the players. On the other hand, shifting to a
market-based system of compensation would transfer some of
the wealth created by big-time college athletic programs to
the individuals whose talents are key ingredients in the
success of those programs.</p>
<p>It would also cause a sea change in the distribution of
power among the top NCAA institutions. Under current NCAA
rules, some of the major college athletic programs, such as
those of Alabama, Notre Dame and Penn State in football, and
North Carolina and Indiana in basketball, have developed such
strong winning traditions over the years that they can
maintain their dominant positions without cheating.</p>
<p>These schools are able to attract superior high school
athletes season after season at the mandated NCAA wage with
the offer of a package of nonmonetary benefits (well-equipped
training facilities, quality coaching staffs, talented
teammates, national exposure and so on) that increases the
present value of an amateur athlete's future professional
income relative to the value added by historically weaker
athletic programs. Given this factor, along with NCAA rules
that mandate uniform compensation across member schools,
these top institutions have a built-in competitive advantage
in recruiting the best and brightest athletes.</p>
<p>It follows that under the current system, the weaker
programs are virtually compelled to offer illegal financial
inducements to players and recruits if they wish to compete
successfully with the traditional powers. It also follows
that shifting to a market-based system of compensation would
remove some of the built-in advantages now enjoyed by the top
athletic programs. It is surely this effect, along with the
reduction in the incomes of coaches and the "fat" in athletic
departments to be expected once a competitive marketplace is
permitted to work, that is the cause of the objection to
paying student-athletes, not the rhetoric about the
repugnance of professionalism.</p>
<p>It is a fight over the distribution of the college sports
revenue pie that lies at the bottom of the debate about
reforming NCAA rules. And despite the high moral principles
and concern for players usually expressed by the debaters on
all sides of the issue, the interests of the athlete are in
fact often the last to be considered.</p>
