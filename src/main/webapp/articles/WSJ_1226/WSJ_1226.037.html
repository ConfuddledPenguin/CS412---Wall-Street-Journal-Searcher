	<p class="article-leader">Dalai Lama means different things to different people. To
some it means that I am a living Buddha, the earthly
manifestation of Avalokiteshvara, Bodhissatva of Compassion.
To others it means that I am a "god-king." During the late
1950s it meant that I was a Vice President of the Steering
Committee of the People's Republic of China. Then when I
escaped into exile, I was called a counterrevolutionary and a
parasite. But none of these are my ideas. To me "Dalai Lama"
is a title that signifies the office I hold. I myself am just
a human being, and incidentally a Tibetan, who chooses to be
a Buddhist monk.
   With these words Tenzin Gyatso begins "Freedom in Exile:
The Autobiography of the Dalai Lama" (Harper/Collins, 288
pages, $22.95). As the title itself implies, the Dalai Lama
may be the supreme temporal as well as spiritual leader to
the Tibetan people, but legally speaking he is just another
another stateless refugee from Communist China. More than
three decades after he fled the Land of the Snows and a year
after the Nobel Committee awarded him its Peace Prize, the
Dalai Lama is telling his story. In so doing he pulls back
some of the mysterious curtains on his Buddhist faith and the
homeland to which he has never returned.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Born in 1935 to peasant farmers in a cowshed in
northeastern Tibet (with his eyes wide open, according to his
mother), the Dalai Lama had a normal childhood and even
recalls enjoying such unlamalike activities as playing
soldier. This normal childhood changed when a search party
identified the boy -- not quite three -- as the reincarnation
of the 13th Dalai Lama, after he'd correctly identified some
of his predecessor's belongings. Shortly thereafter, he was
taken from his parents and prepared for the Lion Throne.</p>
<p>The arrival of the Chinese Communists did not immediately
fill him with foreboding, he now recalls. The Chinese signed
an agreement promising to respect Tibet's traditions and
local autonomy (just like they did in the 1984 Sino-British
Joint Declaration on Hong Kong). And the notion of creating a
sort of Buddho-Liberation Theology was appealing to the
teen-ager. "The more I looked at Marxism," he writes, "the
more I liked it." Personal audiences with Mao only confirmed
his youthful ardor, though the actual destruction wrought by
the Chinese soon demonstrated that the Great Helmsman's words
were like a rainbow: "beautiful, but without substance."</p>
<p>Now, the relationship between China and Tibet has never
been as clear or straightforward as either side insists,
though history leans decidedly toward Tibetan claims. A stone
monument outside Jokhang Cathedral in Lhasa records the 821
A.D. treaty between Tibet and China and delineates clear
boundaries between two separate nations. Beijing dates its
claim to the 13th century, when the Mongol Khans established
an empire that ruled both China and Tibet ("Dalai Lama," in
fact, is a Mongol title). But what really counts for China is
that Tibet covers about a quarter of its land mass and serves
as a nuclear armament base.</p>
<p>At the time of the invasion, Tibet had only about 8,500
mostly ceremonial soldiers, and the Dalai Lama's urgent
appeals to the United Nations never elicited a response
largely because Tibet in its geopolitical indifference "had
never sought to become a member." These days the Dalai Lama
is an internationalist.</p>
<p>Yet for all his bitter personal experience with Sino
communism he remains astonishingly open to its premises. Like
the current pope, the Dalai Lama seems to think that the
problem with Marxism lies not in its anti-human premises but
only in the barbaric application of them by overly ambitious
(and godless) men. "Some responsibility for the excesses of
Communism rest squarely on the West," he writes. Elsewhere he
confesses he has still not given up the possibility of an
ideological rapprochement. "The two approaches to life
{Buddhism and Marxism} are so obviously complementary," he
says. "It is sad that people tend to think of them as being
in opposition."</p>
<p>He can be similarly confusing about his beliefs. The Dalai
Lama is a bit coy about whether he really thinks he is a
reincarnation of the other Dalai Lamas. ". . . I have no
difficulty accepting that I am spiritually connected both to
the 13 previous Dalai Lamas, to Chenrezin {the Spirit of
Compassion}, and to the Buddha himself," he writes.</p>
<p>Whether he is in fact a reincarnation of the Spirit of
Compassion I am unable to say. I am even less willing to
concede his peculiar interpretation of Marxist theory and its
potential for good. But these are abstractions, and there can
be no doubt that in practice the Dalai Lama has been a
consistent champion of freedom. And as a refugee living in an
India that would just as soon not have him, as the head of a
Tibetan government-in-exile nobody but his own people
recognizes, and spokesman for a nation that has suffered so
much under communism, he is a living reminder of the heavy
price paid by those courageous few who could have gone along
-- and didn't.</p>
