	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Yields on certificates of deposit continued to
slide in the latest week, with the biggest declines coming on
CDs sold by major brokerage firms.
   The average yield on small-denomination, three-month CDs
sold directly by banks slipped under 7% in the latest week,
according to an 18-bank national survey by Banxquote Money
Markets, a New York information service.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The three-month average eased to 6.93% Monday, from 6.99%
last Thursday and 7.01% the previous Tuesday, Banxquote
reported. The average yield on five-year consumer CDs
declined to 7.62% Monday from 7.68% the previous Tuesday.</p>
<p>Average yields for large-denomination CDs, which typically
require deposits of $90,000 or more, also eased. The average
yield on six-month jumbo CDs declined to 7.12% from 7.16% the
previous Tuesday, while the average yield for five-year
jumbos declined to 7.73% from 7.81%.</p>
<p>The decline in yields was most noticeable at major
brokerage firms, which negotiate CD rates with banks and then
sell the CDs to brokerage customers. The average yields on
small-denomination six-month CDs sold by leading
broker-dealers declined to 7.52% from 7.67% the previous
Tuesday, while the average yield for five-year broker-sold
CDs declined to 7.73% from 8.15%, according to Banxquote.</p>
<p>Banxquote's usual Tuesday survey was conducted on Monday
because of the Christmas holiday.</p>
