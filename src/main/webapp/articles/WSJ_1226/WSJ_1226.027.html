	<p class="article-leader">ALL AMERICAN TELEVISION Inc., a New York-based distributor
of television programming and seller of commercial time to
advertisers, said it revised its record date for payment of a
cash dividend in connection with its proposed merger with
closely held Scotti Brothers Entertainment Industries Inc., a
Los Angeles-based entertainment company. Holders of All
American common are to receive a $2.50-a-share cash payout
when the merger is completed. This will be payable to shares
on the transaction's closing date, rather than on Jan. 2. The
record date for voting at the annual meeting remains Jan. 2.
Thus, All American shares won't trade ex-dividend until the
first business day following the date the dividend is
payable, which hasn't been determined. Completion of the
merger, which is scheduled for late January or early
February, is subject to conditions such as approval by All
American holders of its recapitalization.</p>
