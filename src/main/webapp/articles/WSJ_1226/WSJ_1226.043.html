	<p class="article-leader">A new experiment by federal scientists failed to support a
widely circulated report last spring that a gene related to
alcoholism had been found.
   In the new experiment the scientists found that the
putative alcoholism gene wasn't any more common among 40
alcoholics than among 127 nonalcoholics. Moreover, they
couldn't find any linkage between the putative alcoholism
gene and alcoholism in two families where a tendency to
alcoholism appeared to be inherited.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The new study throws a splash of cold water on an
experiment reported last April by pharmacologist Kenneth Blum
of the University of Texas at San Antonio and alcoholism
researcher Ernest P. Noble of the University of California,
Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Drs. Blum and Noble reported in the Journal of the
American Medical Association that a variation of the dopamine
receptor gene was associated with alcoholism. The variation
is known as the A1 version of the gene. The gene itself
enables a nerve cell to receive molecules of dopamine, one of
the chemicals that transmits nerve impulses from cell to
cell.</p>
<p>The two researchers last April said they had checked brain
cells of 70 deceased people, half of whom had been severe
alcoholics and half of whom were nonalcoholics. The A1
version of the dopamine receptor gene was present in 69% of
the deceased alcoholics but in only 20% of the nonalcoholics,
they reported.</p>
<p>The finding, Drs. Blum and Noble suggested, hinted that
the A1 version of the gene may render people more susceptible
to alcoholism than people with other versions of the dopamine
receptor gene.</p>
<p>The new experiment, reported in this week's issue of the
Journal of the American Medical Association, checked blood
cells of living individuals for the A1 version of the
dopamine receptor gene. It found that 38% of 40 alcoholics
possessed the A1 version of the gene, almost half the
prevalence seen in the experiment by Drs. Blum and Noble. Of
the 127 nonalcoholics 30% had the A1 version of the gene,
which was almost the same prevalence seen in the alcoholics.</p>
<p>The new experiment also looked at two families that
appeared to be haunted by a tendency toward alcoholism. One
parent in each family had begun heavy drinking in
adolescence. Of the 10 children in the two families, six had
followed their parent into early stage alcoholism and nine
had become drug abusers.</p>
<p>In neither family, however, could the researchers find any
evidence that the A1 version of the dopamine receptor gene
was being inherited along with the tendency toward early
alcoholism.</p>
<p>Neither Dr. Blum in San Antonio nor Dr. Noble in Los
Angeles could be reached Monday for comment.</p>
<p>The new experiment was reported by David Goldman and his
colleagues from the federal National Institute on Alcohol
Abuse and Alcoholism in Bethesda, Md.</p>
