	<p class="article-leader">WILMINGTON, Del. -- Hercules Inc. said Arden B.
Engebretsen, vice chairman and chief financial officer, will
retire next Tuesday, as the chemical and aerospace company
realigns top management to refocus on its aerospace business
and reassess its strategic direction.
   A successor wasn't named.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Hercules also announced a series of changes in its
reporting relationships, effective Tuesday. Richard Schwartz,
executive vice president and the Hercules aerospace unit's
president, will report directly to Thomas L. Gossage, who is
to become chairman and chief executive officer, succeeding
David Hollingsworth on his retirement next Monday. All other
operating units, including the fragrance and food materials
group and the advanced materials unit, will report to Fred L.
Buckner, president and chief operating officer.</p>
<p>The company also will group several of its business
activities -- technology, international, planning and
environmental -- to develop a new long-term direction.</p>
<p>Hercules was set back by difficulties recently, including
technical troubles and order delays in its rocket-booster
operations, which led to a $221.9 million charge against
results for 1989, when the company had a net loss of $81.3
million, or $1.76 a share, on sales of $3.09 billion.</p>
