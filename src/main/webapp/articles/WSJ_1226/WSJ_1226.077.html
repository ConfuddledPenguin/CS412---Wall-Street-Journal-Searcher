	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- The New York financier Stephen C. Swid
signed a letter of intent to acquire Nelson Entertainment
Group Inc. for $30 million in cash and notes and the
assumption of $186 million in debt.
   As part of the transaction, Mr. Swid also would infuse $30
million of capital into the ailing entertainment company,
which is the principal operating subsidiary of Toronto-based
NHI Nelson Holdings International Ltd. Like many other
Hollywood independents, Nelson Entertainment has fallen on
hard times and been searching for an investor to bail it out.
For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Nelson Holdings had a net
loss of $12.1 million, or $3.33 a share, on revenue of $54
million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Swid is chairman and chief executive officer of SCS
Communications Inc., which owns Cinecom Entertainment Group,
Spin magazine and the textbook publisher Westview Press. For
the past two years, he has been hunting for an ailing movie
company to buy at bargain-basement prices, but was
unsuccessful in attempts to acquire Qintex Entertainment Inc.
and the now-bankrupt Weintraub Entertainment Group.</p>
<p>Mr. Swid began investing in entertainment companies after
building his fortune in carpeting and furniture makers. In
1986, he and two partners paid CBS Inc. $125 million for CBS
Songs, with a 250,000-title library that includes classics
such as "Over the Rainbow" and "Singin' in the Rain," and
contemporary hits by James Taylor and Marvin Gaye. Three
years later, the group turned around and sold the music
publishing business to Thorn EMI for $337 million.</p>
<p>An acquisition of Nelson Entertainment would give Mr. Swid
home-video distribution rights in North America to an
800-title library, including feature films and children's and
music programming, and distribution in North American
home-video markets and all international markets of films
co-produced with Castle Rock Entertainment, including the hit
"When Harry Met Sally" and the current thriller "Misery."</p>
<p>Under terms of the letter of intent, a newly created
company controlled by Mr. Swid would pay $5 million in cash;
a $5 million note due within one year and secured by a lien
on all of Nelson Entertainment's assets; and a $20 million,
seven-year note, which would be non-interest-bearing and
subject to prepayment under certain conditions after March
31, 1992.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Swid's new company would assume Nelson
Entertainment's debt outstanding of about $166 million --
including $108 million it owes under a credit facility with
its principal lender, Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland N.V. --
plus $20 million of Nelson Holdings' debt under a secured
convertible debenture issue, due March 31, 1992.</p>
<p>The agreement also would give Mr. Swid's new company a
five-year warrant to acquire 5% of Nelson Holdings' 69%-owned
Nelson Vending Technology Ltd. subsidiary, an owner and
operator of videotape vending machines in the Toronto area.
Nelson Holdings would get a five-year warrant to acquire a 5%
stake in Mr. Swid's new company.</p>
<p>A Feb. 4 deadline has been set for a definitive agreement.
Nelson is free to pursue other offers before that time,
though it must pay separation fees if a deal with Mr. Swid
isn't completed. Nelson's adviser is Lazard Freres & Co., and
Mr. Swid's adviser is Ocean Capital Corp.</p>
