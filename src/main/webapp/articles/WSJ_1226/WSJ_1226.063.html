	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The U.S. initiated an investigation of
Thailand's copyright enforcement practices, U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills said.
   The investigation under U.S. trade laws was begun Friday
in response to a petition filed by organizations representing
U.S. copyright interests and alleging piracy of U.S. movies,
music and other copyrighted works.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We have repeatedly expressed our strong concern to Thai
officials at all levels that the rights of U.S. copyright
holders are not adequately safeguarded," Mrs. Hills said.
"Unfortunately, we have seen no improvement in Thailand's
willingness to shut down the considerable illegal copying of
U.S. movies, music, books and computer software, or to ensure
that U.S. companies obtain prompt and effective redress
through Thailand's legal system."</p>
<p>Mrs. Hills said, "Thailand's stake in improving protection
is considerable, both in terms of attracting desired foreign
investment and ensuring that its own artists and
entrepreneurs receive fair compensation for their efforts."</p>
<p>The U.S. is seeking to schedule prompt consultations with
the Thai government on the issues raised in the petition.</p>
