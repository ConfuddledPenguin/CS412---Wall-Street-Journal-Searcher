	<p class="article-leader">Are your mortgage payments too high?
   It often feels that way for many homeowners, particularly
now, as they try to cut costs in the face of a slowing
economy. But for those with adjustable-rate mortgages, it may
pay to check: Thousands of mortgage holders may actually be
paying more than they should be on variable-rate loans,
because the lenders have miscalculated periodic adjustments
in the monthly payments.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Unlike fixed-rate mortgages, which carry the same interest
rate for the term of the loan, the rate on an adjustable
mortgage changes periodically in line with a specific index.
A specified amount, often between two and three percentage
points, is added to the index to determine the mortgage rate.</p>
<p>Figuring out whether you are being overcharged is fairly
easy, once you have all the information. When there is an
error, "it's usually a question of using the wrong index or
picking the wrong week" in figuring the adjustment, says Paul
Havemann of HSH Associates, a mortgage-information service in
Butler, N.J.</p>
<p>Most lenders have automated systems to calculate the
adjustments; some concede that there could be clerical errors
in entering the data.</p>
<p>For borrowers, the hard part of checking the rate on an
adjustable-rate mortgage is often determining just what rate
is used as the index. While federal regulations require that
indexes be publicly available, borrowers still sometimes have
trouble tracking them.</p>
<p>"You have to read your loan document very carefully to see
exactly what it says," advises Michael Wilson, deputy
director of research for the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions.</p>
<p>There are indexes based on various Treasury securities,
banks' and thrifts' cost of funds, and even on the London
interbank offered rate -- or Libor. Some indexes are based on
a single date, others are moving averages. Some loans are
adjusted monthly, others every six months, annually or every
three years.</p>
<p>Besides the index and the frequency of adjustments, the
loan agreement stipulates the maximum change in each
adjustment period and for the life of the loan, as well as
when the new rate is calculated. Lenders generally must
notify mortgage holders of the new rate 45 days before it
takes effect.</p>
<p>If digging out the papers and looking up interest rates
sounds like more bother than it's worth, keep in mind that a
recent report from the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, said some analysts believe as
many as a quarter of adjustable-rate mortgages may have been
billed incorrectly. Mr. Havemann of HSH Associates says that
between 10% and 20% of the thousands of homeowners who have
called in the past few years seeking help calculating their
payments have found errors.</p>
<p>Although the GAO said federal law probably doesn't require
lenders to reimburse consumers for any overcharges, some
financial institutions have already issued refunds. HSH says
most lenders probably would give borrowers a choice of having
overpayments credited against their mortgage or receiving a
check for the full amount. The rate would also be adjusted
for future payments.</p>
<p>Here's a look at some indexes and how to find out about
them.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities. Interest rates on six-month and
one-year Treasury bills and on three-year and five-year
Treasury notes often are used for adjustable-rate mortgage
indexes, particularly on the East Coast. Some lenders take
the rate on a certain day, usually 45 days before adjustment
date; others use a weekly average.</p>
<p>Rates and yields on Treasury securities are published in
this newspaper and in the business section of many local
papers. The Federal Reserve Board also publishes these
numbers. Individuals can get on the mailing list for the
Fed's release H-15, issued weekly, and G-13, issued monthly,
by contacting the publications office of the Federal Reserve
in Washington. Mr. Wilson of the U.S. League of Savings
recommends getting both. The total cost is $20 a year. (Write
to: Publications Services, Federal Reserve Board, 20th and
Constitution Ave., N.W., Washington, D.C. 20551.)</p>
<p>Cost-of-Funds Indexes. The 11th District Cost of Funds
index, issued monthly by the Federal Home Loan Bank in San
Francisco, is more popular among West Coast lenders. The bank
has a telephone hotline (415-616-2600) with a recorded
announcement giving the index.</p>
<p>The national median cost of funds is a weighted average
reported monthly by the Office of Thrift Supervision in
Washington. Although the office's toll-free telephone number
has been discontinued, individuals can get on a mailing list
for the monthly release by calling the thrift agency's public
affairs office (202-906-6677).</p>
<p>Libor. The London Interbank Offered Rate, an interbank
lending rate used by London banks on dollar-denominated
deposits, can vary daily. It is published in this newspaper
and in business sections of some local papers.</p>
<p>The various indexes also are available through several
computerized data bases.</p>
<p>What happens if after figuring it all out borrowers
discover that they are being undercharged? HSH Associates
says that in most states the lender probably can't bill
mortgage holders for the difference.</p>
