	<p class="article-leader">AUSTIN, Texas -- In the dawn light, a funeral procession
marching to "Amazing Grace" carries a coffin through
downtown. The deceased: A failed local thrift, Capitol City
Savings, whose burial is about to commence on the premises of
its new owner, Bank One.
   As former employees dressed in black gather round, the
"minister" proclaims that Capitol City has been saved] The
coffin lid is pulled open. Blue Bank One balloons fly out. To
the tune of "When The Saints Go Marching In," the mourners
rip off their black clothes to reveal Bank One T-shirts. Then
everyone breaks into dance, even William Renfro, the balding,
55-year-old chairman of Bank One, Austin.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The party's just beginning for Banc One Corp., the
Columbus, Ohio, holding company that runs Bank One, Austin.
Banc One entered the Texas market last year by buying MCorp's
20 failed banks in a $500 million, federally assisted
transaction. Banc One has also been buying up sick thrifts,
among them Capitol City. The Texas foray has plunged Banc One
into risky, unfamiliar waters, but so far with considerable
success. The newly created Bank One, Texas, earned a total of
$38 million in the 1990 second and third quarters -- 18% of
the parent company's profit.</p>
<p>Texas may be just the beginning for Banc One, which until
a few years ago was little known outside Ohio. Even without
the Texas operation, Banc One now is the nation's
24th-largest bank -- and including the Texas properties, the
15th-largest, with more than $40 billion in assets. It also
is one of the industry's most consistently profitable banks.
And as banking's weak sisters get blown down in the current
economic storm, the cash-rich Banc One should be among the
strongest survivors, able to plunge into new regions and pick
up the pieces of fallen rivals.</p>
<p>Banc One Chairman John B. McCoy doesn't hide his broader
ambition. "I never imagined we'd be in Texas," he says. "But
we have a process that could take us to many states, and
that's what we ought to do."</p>
<p>Mr. McCoy says that he would "look at New England," where
several large banks are struggling, and that California is a
possibility. But he says he will stay out of New York,
explaining that he doesn't know how to run a money-center
bank. And Banc One won't enter a new market unless it can
quickly establish a major presence and has credit protection
against the acquired bank's bad loans.</p>
<p>That was the case in Texas, which is an important proving
ground for Banc One's national ambitions. Mr. McCoy says he
was initially reluctant to buy MCorp, mainly because he saw
Texas as unfamiliar territory where the risks outweighed the
rewards. But subordinates convinced him that the deal was too
good to pass up and that MCorp management was strong.</p>
<p>During the bidding, Banc One was considered a dark horse.
Its officials weren't even permitted inside MCorp's opulent
Dallas headquarters; they had to study the bank's books in a
hotel.</p>
<p>But Banc One won the bidding, reportedly against First
City Bancorp. of Texas, Chemical Bank-owned Texas Commerce
Bank, NCNB Corp., Bank of Scotland and Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts & Co. Banc One pledged $500 million to recapitalize
the MCorp banks. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. ponied
up $2.5 billion to spin off the MCorp bad loans into a
special debt-collection bank that Banc One manages for a fee
paid by the agency.</p>
<p>Now, the acquisition looks like a winner. "Banc One is the
best retail bank in the country, and Texas is the country's
most underserved retail banking state," says Dennis Shea, an
analyst at Morgan Stanley & Co. "I don't see how they can
lose."</p>
<p>Whether it's golf, gin rummy or salmon fishing, losing is
something Mr. McCoy hates. At 48, he still looks like a
choirboy, while his low-key manner hides a fierce
competitiveness. Since becoming chief executive in 1984, Mr.
McCoy has more than tripled the bank's assets by buying
profitable but underperforming Midwest banks. Among his
rules: Keep management in place, consolidate back-office
functions, build up the retail business. And never buy a bank
more than one-third the parent company's size.</p>
<p>The fast growth has brought risks, however. Banc One's
nonperforming assets jumped 19% in the third quarter,
primarily from real-estate loans, and more bad loans are
likely to surface as the Midwest property market slumps.
Without Bank One, Texas, the parent company's profit in the
second and third quarters would have been about flat. (The
parent recently announced that fourth-quarter net would
increase 5% to 10% from the year-earlier $92.6 million, or 70
cents a share, despite a one-time charge of $25 million.)</p>
<p>"The big challenge for Banc One is how to keep consumer
lending up in an economy that's slowing down," says James
Sheldon, a money manager at Alliance Capital in New York.
"Where is there consumer growth? Texas."</p>
<p>In courting consumers, Banc One has a proven track record.
In the 1960s, when few banks used broadcast advertising,
comedienne Phyllis Diller was the bank's television
spokeswoman. In addition, Banc One was among the first to
offer automatic teller machines, drive-through windows, cash
management for consumers and affinity-group marketing of
credit cards. It keeps many branches open on weekends and
recently began 24-hour telephone service in some markets.</p>
<p>But in taking on insolvent MCorp, Banc One has had to call
upon all its marketing savvy. MCorp was formed in 1984, when
Mercantile Texas Corp. merged with Southwest Bancshares Inc.
Like most Texas banks, MCorp got caught up in the frenetic
growth-at-any-cost 1980s, and bad real-estate and energy
loans forced the government to bail it out in one of the
largest bank rescues in history.</p>
<p>The MCorp-Banc One link was an odd combination, like
bringing together J.R. Ewing and Woody Hayes. At MCorp's
towering headquarters in Dallas, the atrium lobby has marble
floors, granite arches and $8 million worth of cherrywood
paneling. At one point, Bank One officials apologized to
analysts for the extravagance of MCorp's fifth-floor
executive suites, which were decorated with paintings and
sculptures valued at $2.5 million and now likely to be sold
off. Bank One officials have since moved off the floor (the
bank leases space in rather than owns the building).</p>
<p>At Banc One's nondescript headquarters in Columbus, in
contrast, the most conspicuous picture in the chairman's
office is a painting of Mr. McCoy's predecessor -- his
father, John G. McCoy, a steely executive who used to patrol
the building at night to see that desks were neat.</p>
<p>Inside the Ohio headquarters, discipline and efficiency
are prized. Employees who have a glass of wine, or any other
alcoholic beverage, at lunch are told not to return in the
afternoon. They also aren't allowed to drink coffee at their
desks. When the younger Mr. McCoy became chief executive, a
vice president asked him to lift the coffee ban. Mr. McCoy
wouldn't consider it.</p>
<p>Although Banc One has shied away from applying all those
rules in branch offices, it has, right from the start, found
ways to minimize its risks in Texas. When Banc One bought
MCorp, it took a 7.2% stake, while the FDIC got the rest. The
bank agreed to buy out the government's position over the
next five years with profits from Bank One, Texas. If the
Texas operation posts losses, however, the value of the
FDIC's stake will drop, effectively reducing Banc One's
acquisition cost.</p>
<p>Banc One also has installed more conservative financial
practices at its Texas operation. Aware of MCorp's past
troubles with bad real-estate loans, Mr. McCoy is trying to
make sure that lightning won't strike twice. He has sent to
Texas a team of iron-fisted executives to review loans and
impose austerity.</p>
<p>Banc One has cut $100 million in annual costs by
renegotiating leases on everything from office space to
copying machines and by trimming some operations and
executive perks. In each branch, it has installed an
electronic management information system, which monitors its
finances and shows bankers how their operation is doing
compared with Banc One's other 747 branches across the
country.</p>
<p>The most lucrative market probably will be consumers.
Until recently, branch banking wasn't allowed in Texas; so
large banks catered to corporations, and savings and loans
got the consumers. But as the thrift industry collapses,
people are scrambling to move their deposits.</p>
<p>To build a retail network, Mr. McCoy has doubled the
number of Bank One branches through acquisitions, including
the huge Bright Banc Savings Association in Dallas. Bank One
now has the second-largest number of retail offices in every
major Texas market except Houston.</p>
<p>New automatic teller machines should help strengthen
customer relationships. Bank One, San Antonio, is using a
tie-in with Diamond Shamrock to install ATMs in the chain's
350 convenience stores.</p>
<p>Marketing ideas are bubbling up from the bottom. At a Bank
One, San Antonio, branch, tellers wearing safari hats stand
beneath paper snowflakes, as a parade of cut-out penguins
look on from the back wall. It's all part of a marketing
tie-in with the zoo. And in the small Gulf Coast town of
Orange, the Bank One branch has a popcorn machine in the
lobby. Does it help business? Hard to say, but Robert Morgan,
the branch's president, notes: "If the fresh popcorn's not
popped, the customers want to know why."</p>
<p>MCorp, in contrast, had been primarily a commercial
lender. Bank One officials insist that they won't abandon oil
and energy lending. They foresee commercial loans ultimately
making up 60% of the Texas portfolio.</p>
<p>Analysts expect Bank One to hold its own as a
middle-market lender, partly because of the problems of most
other large Texas banks, which, the analysts say, don't have
balance sheets as strong as Banc One's.</p>
<p>Bank One's toughest competitor in Texas is likely to be
NCNB Corp., of Charlotte, N.C. Now the largest bank in Texas,
NCNB has racked up profits since it entered the state in 1988
through its acquisition of the failed First RepublicBank
Corp. Bank One, Texas, with $13.6 billion in assets, is the
state's fifth-largest bank.</p>
<p>And Bank One could be hurt in Texas by a fragile economy,
already-slow loan growth and the possible threat of a deep
recession. In addition, Thomas E. Hoaglin, a veteran Banc One
executive who now is president of Bank One, Texas, concedes
that he has seen his Texas lending officers in action only
for a short time and doesn't know how they will perform.</p>
<p>Motivating and educating the troops has been a top
priority from the outset. On the first business day after the
MCorp acquisition was announced, Banc One parachuted 250
officials into 35 MCorp branches across the state and spent
$18,000 to give a videotape, outlining Banc One's philosophy,
to each of the 6,000 Texas employees.</p>
<p>"We wanted to see, talk to, touch all our new employees,"
says William Boardman, Banc One's point man on acquisitions.</p>
<p>The wooing of employees had just begun. One rainy night
last January, Bank One held a statewide pep rally. Employees
across the state were bused to balloon-filled auditoriums,
which were hooked up by satellite. Thousands of bankers in
paper hats waved blue foam-rubber No.1 signs and watched
high-school bands, fireworks and the Dallas Cowboy
cheerleaders. Executives declared that this was a winning
team, and, at the close, employees belted out the Bank One
fight song.</p>
