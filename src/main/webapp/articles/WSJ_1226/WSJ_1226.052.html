	<p class="article-leader">On Nov. 23 you printed comments from various people
concerning "Milken's Sentence: Was Justice Done?"
   These comments were from important people but not from a
guy called "the average American taxpayer" who will again get
stuck with the bill to clean up another mess. You did not
solicit my comments as an average American taxpayer, but I
will give them to you anyway.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Was justice done? Absolutely not. Michael Milken should
have received the maximum prison sentence with no hope of
parole due to the damage he has done to our economy.</p>
<p>If he is released from prison early and is required to
perform community service, what will he do, teach the younger
generation how to manipulate stocks and bonds? The only
community service he should be permitted to do is to clean
the streets of Alaska.</p>

<p>What Mr. Milken did for corporate America was to introduce
(through greed) unmanageable corporate debt and siphon off
hundreds of billions of dollars from needed capital
improvements into the pockets of manipulative investors,
arbitragers and attorneys, thereby so weakening corporate
structure as to displace hundreds of thousands of workers.
These displacements and a loss of confidence in the
marketplace have brought about a very real recession. To say
that there were no victims is to belie the fact that our
entire country was the victim.</p>

<p>In my opinion, having lost money in a number of Mr.
Milken's manipulations, I think the sentence was not stiff
enough. He probably will be sent to a country-club type of
prison, like San Luis Obispo or Eglin AFB. He needs to do
"hard time." I suggest a prison like Joliet.</p>

<p>Investor Harold C. Simmons characterized the sentence
given as "too strenuous." There is no disputing that Mr.
Milken is a brilliant man and contributed greatly to our
country's wealth and financial history, but he broke the law,
and I believe his sentence was anything but strenuous.</p>
<p>Anyone who is in a position to alter greatly the course of
events, as Mr. Milken was, must be above reproach. Michael
Milken had control over millions of dollars at any given
moment and, whether he realized it or not, controlled the
fate of many lives as a result.</p>
<p>How can Mr. Simmons say this is a victimless crime, with
more than 40,000 people on Wall Street out of work already
and more to come? When is the small investor going to feel it
is safe enough to venture back into the market?</p>

<p>It is truly amazing that Mr. Simmons could suggest there
were "no victims."</p>
<p>Mr. Milken, through his junk-bond shenanigans, is second
only to Congress in causing the savings-and-loan debacle. The
taxpayers will pay billions of dollars in the decade ahead to
cover the S&L losses. Mr. Milken, through his crimes, has
cost innocent stockholders of savings and loans, banks,
mutual funds and closed-end funds additional millions. Many
insurance companies, college endowment funds and pension
funds have fewer assets today than they did a few years ago
due to Mr. Milken's greed. Further, the number of jobs lost
and careers destroyed because of his manipulation of the
markets and destruction of heretofore viable enterprises far
outweighs any good he may have done.</p>
<p>No victims? Mr. Simmons must have been emulating Rip van
Winkle these past few years.</p>
