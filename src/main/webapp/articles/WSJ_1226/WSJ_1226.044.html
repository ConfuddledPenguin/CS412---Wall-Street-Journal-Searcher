	<p class="article-leader">While I believe that justice is on the side of the
striking Daily News unions, I so far have restrained from
fueling the tension with any public words of my own. But when
Michael Gartner, president of NBC News (an employer of many
IATSE Local One members), said the striking unions were
orchestrating a conspiracy of violence and compared them with
terrorists and murderers in his Nov. 29 op-ed Viewpoint
column, "Nation Shrugs as Thugs Firebomb Freedom," I had to
try to douse his reckless rhetoric with a little common
sense.
   Mr. Gartner blamed the unions for all the violence and
described the newsstand boycott of the Daily News as sweeping
proof that the unions are violating First Amendment freedoms.
He doesn't even acknowledge what many analysts have said:
that many newsstand owners volunteered to boycott the Daily
News out of loyalty to the drivers and their customers. Mr.
Gartner brushed aside the intimidation campaign orchestrated
by the Tribune Co. aimed at driving workers to a point of
fury so that they would strike and the unions could be
permanently replaced and destroyed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Many Americans would be more conversant with the issues
facing working people, from child care to occupational health
and safety, if they were given more coverage on the network
news. A study by journalist Jonathan Tasini found that in
1989 the three network evening-news programs devoted a little
more than 2% of the total air time to all workers' issues
while business reporting received twice as much coverage. Our
journalists, and yes our network-news-division presidents,
have a professional responsibility to take us beyond their
own bias, beyond the easy cliches, slogans, myths and
preconceptions that govern much of our social discourse. News
professionals must show us the issues behind the conflict.</p>
<p>Has Mr. Gartner really looked into the background of the
News strike? Violence has occurred on both sides, and the New
York City Police Department has testified that no organized
conspiracy of violence exists among the union members. For a
year the Tribune Co. has used guard dogs and armed security
guards to intimidate, harass and pressure workers. Mr.
Gartner fails to mention that the unions have offered
compromises but found the way to settlement blocked by the
Tribune Co.</p>
<p>Mr. Gartner wails about First Amendment rights, but his
diatribe is selective about which rights are important and
which aren't. It is interesting that "freedom of speech" has
been News publisher Jim Hoge's biggest argument. Mr. Gartner
ignores all the other civil and economic rights at stake in
this dispute. The Tribune Co. has interfered with the unions'
right to strike without being permanently replaced, to
bargain collectively, to protest and to assemble peacefully.</p>
<p>Mr. Gartner misses the point when he accuses New Yorkers
of "standing by" with little concern for the violence. New
Yorkers care about the strike because they care about union
issues -- the disappearance of good-paying jobs and the right
of workers to have some voice in their own economic future.
An independent poll commissioned by the unions showed that
people who regularly read the Daily News support the strikers
by a dramatic 60%.</p>
<p>Management is insisting that the News's unions give up the
voice of union representation and protection, and a lot of
people are upset about that.</p>
