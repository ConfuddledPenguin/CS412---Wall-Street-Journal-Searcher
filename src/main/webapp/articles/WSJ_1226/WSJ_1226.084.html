	<p class="article-leader">Japan's Sumitomo Chemical Co. and Nippon Shokubai Kagaku
Kogyo Co. Ltd. agreed to form a joint venture company with
Korea's Lucky Ltd. to produce a raw material for an
industrial resin.
   The three companies said they would build a plant in Korea
to produce an ingredient for methacrylate resin, used to
enhance transparency or weather resistance in items such as
housing materials.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The plant, scheduled for completion in the spring of 1993,
is capitalized at 24 billion won ($33.6 million). Fifty
percent of financing will be provided by Lucky Ltd.; the rest
will come from the Japanese firms in equal shares.</p>
<p>The plant will be built in the Lucky Goldstar Group's
petrochemical complex in Yeochun, Korea, the companies said.
The new venture will be called Lucky MMA Corporation.</p>
<p>The plant will make 40,000 tons annually of the MMA
monomer used in the industrial resin, and 35,000 tons yearly
of isobutylene, MMA monomer's raw material.</p>
<p>Currently, the materials that the plant is expected to
make are all imported into Korea, as there are no local
producers, the companies said.</p>
<p>The two Japanese companies, which have been cooperating in
the development of their own MMA monomer operations, run a
joint venture in Japan called the Nihon Methacrylate Monomer
Co.</p>
