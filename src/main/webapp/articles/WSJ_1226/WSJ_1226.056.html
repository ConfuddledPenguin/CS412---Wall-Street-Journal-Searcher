	<p class="article-leader">HAYDEN LAKE, Idaho -- Transtector Systems Inc. said it
extended to April 30, 1991, from Nov. 30, 1990, the deadline
for either the company or a group of managers to terminate a
previously announced plan to take the company private.
   The electronics company said the agreement was extended
because of generally poor market conditions and its weak
financial performance. The company also said it will reduce
its work force by 10% and trim overhead costs because of a
change in its marketing programs and the weakening of the
economy.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Transtector entered into the pact with managers in May.
The original date for completion, Sept. 1, was extended to
Nov. 30. The company's stock was quoted at 12.5 cents a share
bid in over-the-counter trading Monday.</p>
