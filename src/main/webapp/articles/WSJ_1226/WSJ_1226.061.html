	<p class="article-leader">The next time you pick up a James Bond movie at the
world's biggest video chain, the spying may start long before
you turn on the television.
   The Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. chain is quietly
taking advantage of a loophole in the nation's privacy law to
prepare a massive data base of the movies its 30 million
customers rent. It plans to sell information from the data
base next year to direct mailers, for planning
target-marketing campaigns.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Many businesses commonly sell their customer lists, but
Blockbuster is one of a small fraction using sophisticated
computers to keep records of each individual's transactions.
Its data base promises to raise especially difficult privacy
issues, for the same reason it should be such a gold mine for
direct mailers: Video choices are among the most revealing
decisions a consumer makes.</p>
<p>A two-year-old federal law forbids video stores to
disclose the names of movies its customers rent. But the law
permits stores to tell direct marketers "the subject matter"
of movies a customer has rented.</p>
<p>Blockbuster, whose members represent one out of six
American households, says its data base will be legal because
it will only monitor video categories, not specific titles.
The chain currently organizes its shelves by 37 categories,
and plans to add as many as 30 to 40 more.</p>
<p>The new categories may be almost as descriptive as movie
titles themselves. Blockbuster says categories under
consideration include James Bond, Police Buddy Movies, and
Slasher Horror. Blockbuster already has such precise headings
as Hitchcock, Elvis, Religious, and "Le Bad Cinema."</p>
<p>Blockbuster doesn't carry X-rated videos, though it stocks
movies with the new adults-only NC-17 rating.</p>
<p>Direct-marketers are ravenous for information about
consumers' taste and life styles, because such data help
pinpoint targets for expensive mail campaigns. Blockbuster
envisions selling lists of mystery movie renters to mystery
book clubs, kids movie renters to toy stores, classics
renters to senior-citizen marketers, and many such other
matches.</p>
<p>"I can turn around and promote all the John Wayne names to
the national Republican Party," says Allan Caplan, the
Blockbuster vice president overseeing the database project.
"We not only will know their tastes in movies -- we'll know
their frequency and that will give us a little more
information about their life style."</p>
<p>The Fort Lauderdale, Fla., chain also intends to make
heavy use of its data base for its own marketing. Mr. Caplan
says Blockbuster customers will be able to stay off other
mailing lists by checking a box when they sign up for a
membership.</p>
<p>Even so, the Blockbuster plan worries some civil-liberties
advocates.</p>
<p>"It seems so directly at odds with the purpose of the
video-privacy bill," says Marc Rotenberg, the Washington
director of Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility,
and a former Senate lawyer who helped draft the law. "What
does a privacy law mean, if you can't say he rented the movie
`Misery,' but you can say he rented a suspense thriller by
Stephen King?"</p>
<p>Congress hastily passed the video privacy bill in 1988,
after a Washington reporter cajoled a video-store clerk into
showing him the rental records of Judge Robert Bork, then up
for confirmation for the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The reporter published his findings in a local weekly,
revealing that the controversial jurist liked Alec Guinness,
Alfred Hitchcock and James Bond movies. The ensuing
legislation immediately became known as the "Bork Bill."</p>
<p>Since then the subject has virtually disappeared from the
public eye. Meanwhile, advances in computers have made it
easier and cheaper for businesses of many different types to
gather and store customer-by-customer records -- if they can
induce consumers to identify themselves at the cash register.</p>
<p>For example, Waldenbooks, the giant bookstore chain owned
by K mart Corp., keeps records of members of its 10-month-old
"Preferred Reader" program. Members who pay $10 a year
present a card and receive a 10% discount on books. For 14
cents a name, direct mailers can buy the membership list
complete with address, children's ages, and interest in
romance, self-improvement, sci-fi and five other categories.
Waldenbooks doesn't sell data about specific book titles.</p>
<p>An even more aggressive data-collector is Staples Inc., a
Newton, Mass., chain of 68 office-supplies stores for small
businesses. Staples customers can get a free "membership"
card simply by filling out a form. Customers who don't
present a card pay 5% more than the posted prices -- a rare
example of penalizing consumers who don't want their
purchase-records to be collected. Staples sells its customer
addresses and professions for six to eight cents a name.</p>
<p>Systems like these don't always run smoothly. Last month,
Citicorp dismissed about half the staff of a big project to
collect individual shoppers' purchase data at supermarkets.
Citicorp says the expensive program wasn't gathering enough
data to meet its goals.</p>
<p>Privacy advocates don't dispute the business merits of
these data bases, but they worry that the consequences aren't
adequately disclosed to consumers.</p>
<p>"The basic principle is that information collected for one
purpose shouldn't be used for another purpose without an
individual's consent," says Mary Culnan, a Georgetown
University business professor specializing in electronic
privacy issues. "Even if people check off a box but they
don't understand how the information is sold, basically
that's violated the principle."</p>
