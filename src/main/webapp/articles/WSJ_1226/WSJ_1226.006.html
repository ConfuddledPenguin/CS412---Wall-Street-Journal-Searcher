	<p class="article-leader">Christmas is over and some toys are already broken. So are
the toy makers' stocks.
   Mattel sells for 20 5/8, down from a 52-week high of 26
3/8. Hasbro goes for 15, down from 21 1/2. Tonka can be
picked up for 3 5/8, way down from its high of 14.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"This has been the worst Christmas in toy retailing in 13
years," declares Robert Schweich, analyst for Wertheim
Schroder.</p>
<p>In the past, toy sales held up fairly well in recessions,
such as the one that now seems to be grabbing the U.S.
economy by the throat. But toys have become much pricier in
the past decade.</p>
<p>A toy that cost $30 used to be considered expensive.
Cabbage Patch dolls at the height of the craze, Teddy Ruxpin
and other talking electronic dolls and Nintendo video games
have helped push the high-price point to around $100. With
costlier goods to sell, toy makers and retailers now may be
less recession-resistant than in bygone years.</p>
<p>That's one reason analysts and money managers prefer
broadly diversified toy makers with good balance sheets. Just
two toy makers fit that bill -- Mattel and Hasbro. Of the
two, Mattel has better momentum in sales and earnings. Hasbro
has the superior balance sheet, with lots of cash and very
little debt.</p>
<p>Shares in both Mattel and Hasbro sell for about 10 times
earnings (profits for the 12 months ended Sept. 30). But if
you adjust for Hasbro's cash hoard, it is selling for less
than eight times earnings, points out Sean McGowan of Gerard
Klauer Mattison.</p>
<p>Money managers and analysts are mostly steering clear of
toy makers or retailers with heavy debt, such as Lewis Galoob
Toys, Tonka, and Child World. Opinion is sharply divided on
Tyco Toys. It has some hit products, but is speculative and
carries considerable debt (about 45% of total capital as of
midyear).</p>
<p>Besides the budding recession, toy retailers are suffering
from a bloody price war. Price slashing at cash-starved Child
World has been so deep -- particularly on its Nintendo
cartridges -- that rival Toys "R" Us in many cases couldn't
match Child World's prices. Child World has told its
suppliers not to expect payment until after Jan. 15. It
doesn't take long for retail price softness to affect
manufacturers.</p>
<p>Losing some bargain-hunting customers to Child World, Toys
"R" Us will report a 7% decline in fourth-quarter sales at
stores opened for more than a year, predicts Mr. Schweich.
The drop compares with a 24% jump last Christmas. The
company's fourth-quarter earnings will fall to 79 cents a
share, Mr. Schweich predicts, from 82 cents a year ago.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, some money managers are buying Toys "R" Us,
partly in hopes that one or more competitors will go bust.
"If the competition goes out of business, is that good news
or bad news? To me, that's damn good news," says J. David
Mills, manager of the Boston Co. Capital Appreciation Fund.
"Maybe fourth-quarter earnings will be bad. . . . So what?. .
. . I think Toys "R" Us is going to be a terrific long-term
growth stock." His fund owns more than 100,000 shares.</p>
<p>Detractors concede that Toys "R" Us is a fine company. But
they question the wisdom of paying 20 times earnings for any
company, when the economy is sliding into a recession.</p>
<p>Toys "R" Us is one of "the three sacred cows for
growth-stock investors," says Scott Black, president of
Delphi Management in Boston. (The other two are WalMart and
Limited.) There's no way he would pay the current price of 23
1/8 for Toys "R" Us, Mr. Black says. "Comparable-store
results are very sluggish."</p>
<p>As if a recession and a retail price war weren't enough,
the toy industry also has a case of new-product blahs.
Potential 1991 hits? No one seems very excited, even though
retailers and a few analysts already have had a peek at the
new crop. Predicts Barry Rothberg, analyst for Mabon Nugent,
who has seen a few previews, "The next Toy Fair is going to
be a yawner."</p>
<p>The drought of mega-hit toys in recent years has spruced
up Mattel's Barbie into a hardy evergreen. This year the doll
will bring home more than $700 million, or nearly half the
firm's revenue. And Gary Jacobson, a toy analyst for Kidder
Peabody, estimates the company's revenue will jump 13% in
1991 to $1.65 billion from a projected $1.46 million this
year. He anticipates its per-share earnings will climb to
$2.40 from $2.05 this year.</p>
<p>Friess Associates in Greenville, Del., sold at least
250,000 Mattel shares in the third quarter as part of a move
to raise cash. It hung onto part of its Mattel holding,
though. The share price is "still fairly reasonable," and the
company in recent years has "a pretty nice track record,"
says money manager Bill D'Alonzo. Also, he says, Mattel is
well enough diversified that it could withstand a flop by any
particular toy -- except, of course, for Barbie. Ariel
Capital Management in Chicago has been buying Hasbro
aggressively. It had 446,000 shares as of Sept. 30,
government filings show. Eric McKissack, director of
research, won't say how many shares Ariel has now, but
describes Hasbro as "a core position" for the firm, which
manages about $1 billion.</p>
<p>He likes Hasbro's international operations, strong cash
flow, and steady sellers such as GI Joe, My Little Pony and
Milton Bradley board games. "In the conservative or cautious
times we have now, people are probably more likely to look at
traditional types of toys," he says.</p>
<p>Mr. McKissack acknowledges certain problems at Hasbro. The
company hasn't had a blockbuster hit for a long time, sales
have been rather flat for five years, and some people think
it will be hard for Chief Executive Officer Alan Hassenfeld
to fill the shoes of his late brother Stephen, who died in
June 1989.</p>
<p>Mr. McKissack wouldn't buy Tyco "even though they have a
good mix of products," including electric trains. "I think
one should be cautious with Tyco, because their debt levels
are high," he says. But some analysts admire Tyco, citing
hits such as its crawling Oopsie Daisy doll last year, and
its pirouetting My Ballerina doll this year.</p>
<p>Hardly anyone seems willing to take a gamble on Tonka, the
third-largest toy maker (Mattel and Hasbro are neck-and-neck
for first). Mired in debt, the Minnetonka, Minn., concern has
seen its stock price plunge nearly 75%, yet nobody nibbles.
Unless Tonka finds new hits, a bankruptcy-law filing is a
possibility, says Frank Rolfes, analyst for Dain Bosworth
Inc.</p>
<p>Tonka's once-big money maker, Ghostbusters, is fading
fast. Other hopefuls, such as Batman, Baby Alive and
Wrestling dolls, although doing reasonably well this year,
may not sell next year. Rumors persist that Tonka will be
forced to sell its Parker Brothers board game operations, to
buy time in which Tonka can hope to find another hit. Mr.
McGowan thinks several companies would be happy to buy Parker
Brothers. But he says that Parker Brothers and the rest of
Tonka's line are intertwined administratively, especially in
Europe. So untangling the two would be a challenge.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>January Effect: Henry Scheuer, vice president of the
Institutional Brokers Estimate System (I/B/E/S), recommends
15 stocks that he thinks are good bets to take advantage of
the January effect this year.</p>
<p>Most years, smaller stocks bounce upward in January. The
effect especially applies to issues that were battered by
tax-loss selling in December -- in other words, issues that
turned in crummy performances the year before.</p>
<p>To make Mr. Scheuer's list, a stock needed to have a
market value smaller than $500 million, be down substantially
in the past six months, have a low P/E ratio (price divided
by the past 12 months' per-share earnings), and be expected
to show positive earnings growth for both 1990 and 1991.
Also, a stock was ruled out if analysts had recently lowered
estimates of the company's profit.</p>
<p>Here's the list, in alphabetical order: Bytex, Clean
Harbors, Club Med, Computer Task Group, Cooker Restaurant,
Envirosafe Services, Fidelity National Financial, Inspiration
Resources, International Rectifier, La Petite Academy,
Network Systems, OHM, Shoney's, Westmoreland Coal, and Zenith
National Insurance Corp.</p>
