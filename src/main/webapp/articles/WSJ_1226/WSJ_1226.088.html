	<p class="article-leader">BRAMPTON, Ontario -- Hillsborough Resources Ltd., an
engineering and contracting services concern serving the
Canadian mining industry, said it and Curragh Resources Inc.,
a Toronto-based lead and zinc mining concern, obtained 55
million Canadian dollars (US$47.4 million) in financing for
their Mount Hundere lead-zinc project.
   The venture, of which Curragh owns 80% and Hillsborough
20%, was formed to develop a lead-zinc deposit in Canada's
Yukon Territory. Curragh is the project operator.
Hillsborough said the financing was obtained from a Canadian
bank. Commercial production is expected to begin next summer.
Curragh officials couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
