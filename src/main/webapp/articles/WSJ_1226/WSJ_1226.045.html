	<div class="article-body"><p>It frightens, it paralyzes,</p>
<p>It leaves me aghast --</p>
<p>This manner in which the present</p>
<p>Surpasses the past:</p>
<p>The girl who spent two hours</p>
<p>Powdering her nose</p>
<p>Earns fifty thousand a year</p>
<p>Designing offbeat clothes,</p>
<p>And the lad who flunked arithmetic</p>
<p>(Too busy with his scooter)</p>
<p>Becomes another Einstein</p>
<p>On an electronic computer.</p>
<p>-- Al Bernstein.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Empty-Nest Celebration</p>
<p>Our last-born child was wed today,</p>
<p>And, while we feel the lack,</p>
<p>There is a bright side, I must say --</p>
<p>We got our car keys back]</p>
