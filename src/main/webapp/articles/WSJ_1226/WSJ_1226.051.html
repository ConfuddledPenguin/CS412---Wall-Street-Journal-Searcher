	<p class="article-leader">A federal judge in San Jose has come up with a brilliant
solution to the annual holiday rush of lawsuits by the
American Civil Liberties Union. One of the ACLU lawsuits this
year was against an allegedly unconstitutional creche in
front of City Hall in Monterey, California. Supreme Court
precedents obliged the judge to hear the case, but he decided
to schedule arguments for today. Other judges might want to
follow this precedent for postponing hearings until the day
after Christmas, or in the case of menorahs after Hanukkah.
This is one case where mootness sings the loudest tidings of
good cheer.</p>
