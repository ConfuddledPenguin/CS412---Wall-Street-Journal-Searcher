	<p class="article-leader">New York -- When Richie Havens sang "Freedom" at Woodstock
in 1969, little did he know that 21 years later it would
still be his biggest hit. But his Woodstock-earned reputation
has allowed him to parlay singing into his own sort of
freedom: the chance to do what he wants.
   Sitting in his company's midtown Manhattan office
recently, Havens, an imposing but friendly figure with hands
full of rings, expounded on music, a new album due out next
month, television and radio ads, environmental projects and
philosophy, always philosophy.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>On the subject of Woodstock, Havens said he wishes the
event was more understood. "Kids are discovering Woodstock
every day . . . It's been a 20-year job for me just defending
Woodstock's actuality." Folklore has it that Woodstock was
his big break, but Havens stressed that he had performed
overseas by 1969 and had done albums by then. Nevertheless,
the legendary outdoor concert certainly didn't hurt his
popularity, and he was the first performer on stage, thanks
to a twist of fate. "I went on first because there was no one
else there to go on," he said. All the other groups were
still stuck in traffic.</p>
<p>Havens is a man who insists he's happy scrambling. At 49,
he claims fans of all ages and appears at jazz, rock, folk
and blues concerts. But he hasn't always enjoyed big
financial success with his records. "So many companies," he
said; "the minute I put out an album they go out of
business." But, he added, "I don't need a record to allow me
to work."</p>
<p>A guitarist/singer who performs with backup guitar or
four-piece band, Havens has done 19 albums, three of them
gold (sales of more than 500,000). He has also done
soundtracks for the television program "The Wonder Years" and
the film "Coming Home." One of his latest albums, "Simple
Things" (RBI), sold more than 100,000 copies in the U.S.
after it was issued two years ago, but then RBI folded. He
reissued the record in Europe recently on his own ELO label
and it sold 40,000 copies in Italy alone.</p>
<p>These are not astounding figures. Indeed, Havens's career
has been a tepid affair since the '60s, perhaps because of
the kind of music he performs. "Richie Havens is essentially
an interpretive singer in the folk genre," said Rolling
Stone's Anthony DeCurtis, the point being that interpretive
singers in the folk genre didn't ship much platinum in the
'70s and '80s. But Havens stayed alive and his number may be
coming up again, in the wake of recent successes by folky
artists such as Tracy Chapman. Mr. DeCurtis thinks it's "not
impossible for Richie Havens to stage a comeback."</p>
<p>Johanan Vigoda, the Los Angeles co-producer of Havens's
upcoming album, called "Richie Havens Now," has his sights
set high for a commercial success. The album, which will
include a Jimi Hendrix song, one Cyndi Lauper tune and eight
to 10 originals, will be released by Solar Records, a soul
label distributed by CBS. That, Mr. DeCurtis remarked, should
be a boost to Havens, who has suffered in the past under
smaller labels that lacked marketing and promotion clout. "A
lot of people have heard of him, but have never heard him,"
said Mr. Vigoda, a long-time industry hand who represents
Stevie Wonder.</p>
<p>Actually, millions have heard Havens without knowing it.
He sings jingles for a variety of commercials. The Woodstock
rebel's voice now hymns Amtrak, Folgers coffee, Bell
Atlantic, MasterCard, Kodak and others. He won a 1990 Clio
award for an ad he sung for the cotton industry.</p>
<p>"I like Richie Havens," said Amtrak spokesman Clifford
Black. "Havens's voice gives {the ad} a signature that makes
it special."</p>
<p>The jingle business can bring a volume singer in New York
as much as $10,000 under union scale in residuals over the
life of a commercial. Havens earns over scale, industry
executives say. And, added Mr. DeCurtis, Havens's jingles are
"very lucrative," noting "no one's going to have to take up a
collection for Richie Havens." Havens himself downplays the
part played by jingles in his current career: "Every jingle
house calls me up and I refuse most. It's not my business.
The ads are projects. I support my own ideas in that kind of
way."</p>
<p>Havens does indeed seem to be constantly in motion, doing
concerts "all over the planet" every weekend in large and
small settings. His recent schedule included a trip to Prague
for two days for an Italian television special with Joe
Cocker and Billy Preston, then California a few days later.
He also performed at a concert honoring Nelson Mandela in New
York earlier this year.</p>
<p>Time was, of course, he was on the road every day, but he
says he has cut his traveling to three or four days a week,
to leave time for a variety of projects. The North Wind
Underseas Institute on New York's City Island, which he
co-founded, developed a device to rescue whales and teaches
harbor seals to rescue people trapped underwater. He is also
starting a cable project called Weekend Future Television.</p>
<p>If the new album takes off, the only thing Havens will
have to worry about is another jingle singer who imitates the
Havens voice so well that "a lot of times I thought it was
me, too."</p>
