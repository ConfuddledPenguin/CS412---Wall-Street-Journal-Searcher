	<p class="article-leader">Southwestern Bell Corp., St. Louis, said its
fourth-quarter net income will be cut by about $36 million,
or 12 cents a share, as a result of one-time payments to
about 1,100 managers who participated in a plan to reduce the
company's management ranks.
   In the year-earlier quarter, the company earned $297.2
million, or 99 cents a share, on revenue of $2.32 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company said the number of participants in the plan
was in line with its expectations. In October, the company
offered managers on its corporate staff, as well as managers
at Southwestern Bell Telephone and Southwestern Bell Yellow
Pages, as much as one year's salary if they left the company
by year end.</p>
<p>Southwestern Bell said it will report results for the
fourth quarter and the year in late January.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Monday,
Southwestern Bell shares closed at $56.375, down 25 cents.</p>
