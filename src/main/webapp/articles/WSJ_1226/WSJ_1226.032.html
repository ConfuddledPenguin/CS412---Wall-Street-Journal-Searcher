	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- After a record-breaking year of criminal-law
enforcement, the Justice Department's environmental chief is
considering ways to create safe harbors to shelter from
prosecution polluters that are trying to clean up their acts.
   Assistant Attorney General Richard Stewart, a professor on
leave from Harvard Law School, has intensified criminal
prosecution of environmental violations, which only a few
years ago typically were addressed through civil litigation.
In the year ended Sept. 30, federal grand juries returned 134
felony indictments for environmental crimes, 33% more than in
the previous year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Both the statistics and the big cases" -- such as the
indictment of Exxon Corp. for the 1989 Alaska oil spill --
"indicate the advancement of innovative concepts for
protecting the environment and enforcing existing laws," says
Fred Krupp, executive director of the Environmental Defense
Fund, a research and advocacy group here.</p>
<p>Mr. Stewart himself speaks proudly of this aggressive
approach. But in almost the same breath, he says that federal
prosecutors "don't have coherent guidelines on how to draw
the line between criminal and civil" enforcement.</p>
<p>Noted for his seminal academic work on creating economic
incentives for pollution control, Mr. Stewart fears that
ironically, overly enthusiastic criminal prosecution may
encourage companies to overlook their environmental
transgressions and cover up those they do know about.</p>
<p>The treatment of internal corporate environmental audits
illustrates the problem.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, businesses increasingly have relied
on in-house reviews to try to stay in compliance with the
expanding number of environmental statutes and regulations.
Experts in the field applaud the trend toward self-policing.
But in an era of stiffened criminal enforcement, internal
documents describing instances of noncompliance can become
evidence of "knowing" violations that send people to jail. As
a result, says John Quarles, a former Environmental
Protection Agency official who now practices corporate law
here, his clients "are agonizing over" whether to document
their own environmental shortcomings honestly.</p>
<p>The stakes can be high: Last year, the president of
MacDonald & Watson Waste Oil Co., Johnston, R.I., was
sentenced to 28 months in prison for environmental crimes
after a prosecution that relied in part on evidence from
internal audit documents.</p>
<p>"The normal reaction of the prosecutor is (that) you don't
give any aid or comfort to violators of the law," says Mr.
Stewart. "The problem is that we aren't talking about bank
robbers here. We are talking about" companies engaged in
"productive economic activity, and we want there to be
incentives for improved compliance."</p>
<p>Industry advocates have sought federal legislation
immunizing companies from criminal liability based on
internal audits. Some lawmakers expressed interest in the
idea, but it wasn't included in this year's amendment of the
Clear Air Act.</p>
<p>Not waiting for legislative action, Mr. Stewart says he is
drafting standards for prosecutors. He hopes to issue them
early next year. He is nervous about sharing specifics before
the guidelines are cleared by more-senior administration
officials, but basic principles he is mulling include
establishing that audits won't be used in criminal
prosecutions if they were performed in "good faith" and
resulted in "prompt remedial action."</p>
<p>Those terms obviously would be vulnerable to manipulation
by lawyers. "The danger," Mr. Stewart says, "is, what do you
do when a company rushes out to do an audit as cover" for
earlier violations.</p>
<p>Corporate defenders applaud Mr. Stewart's concern, but
they remain cautious. "He sure found the problem," says Mr.
Quarles. But the former EPA official adds, "The solution is
nowhere in sight."</p>
