	<h3>And if This Doesn't Do the Trick, They May Call for Squirrel Rifles</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">Balloons make good targets.
   Environmentalists have long said balloons that land in the
sea choke marine life. Now California says metallic balloons
do a number on power lines.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>So, starting Jan. 1, Californians who unleash
helium-filled metallic balloons will be committing a crime
under a new law. First-time offenders will be fined $100, and
repeat offenders face as long as six months in jail and a
$1,000 fine.</p>
<p>The new balloon law results from the lobbying efforts of
California utilities and the state's Public Utilities
Commission. Their crusade was inspired by a commission report
that fugitive metallic balloons and their streamers cause
nearly 1% of California's power outages each year.</p>
<p>Metallic balloons, on the market since the early 1970s,
are made of aluminum-coated nylon. They stay aloft longer
than latex balloons because the aluminum coating prevents the
helium, which has very tiny atoms, from leaking out. Metallic
balloons account for about $400 million of the nation's $1
billion balloon industry.</p>
<p>Utility companies were so concerned about the commission's
findings that they wanted to ban the sale of the balloons.
But the Silver Balloon Association, a Sacramento-based group
representing metallic-balloon vendors and manufacturers,
convinced legislators that such a ban would devastate
thousands of small businesses.</p>
<p>"Squirrels and birds cause nearly 2.5% of the outages,"
says Silver Balloon Director Lisa Rea. "And automobiles and
the weather cause a lot more. But you can't ban squirrels,
birds and storms; so they went after balloons."</p>
<p>As of Jan. 1, the sale or distribution of any balloon
attached to metallic ribbons or streamers will be prohibited.
Metallic balloons must have a weight attached and bear a
label warning consumers about the dangers that balloons pose
for power lines. And vendors can sell metallic balloons in
bunches only if the balloons are attached to an object, like
a mug or a key chain.</p>
<p>Still, balloon companies don't seem too deflated.</p>
<p>Alan Harris, a vice president of M&D Balloons, a large
U.S. balloon maker, thinks the weighted balloons will be
popular. "The new product will prevent a child from losing a
balloon in a grocery store with 20-foot ceilings. And there
will no longer be a need for people to tie their balloons to
their desks or weight them down with a book, only to lose the
balloon once the book is lifted . . . We're optimistic."</p>
