	<p class="article-leader">MONTVALE, N.J. -- Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. said it
will support a new share offering by Isosceles PLC that would
reduce A&P's stake in the debt-laden British supermarket
retailer to 6.6% from the 19.9%.
   A&P, a supermarket chain that is 52%-owned by the
Tengelmann Group of Germany, and Isosceles fought last fall
for Gateway Corp., another British food retailer. Isosceles
won the takeover battle, and A&P in turn wound up with the
19.9% stake in Isosceles.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A&P said Isosceles is proceeding with the new share
offering, which is part of a previously announced
restructuring to provide it with about #222 million ($418.8
million) in new equity and converted debt.</p>
<p>A&P said it doesn't intend to purchase any shares in the
offering, but intends to vote in favor of the shareholder
resolutions authorizing the transaction. A&P also said it
will retain its directorship on the Isosceles board.</p>
<p>A&P's investment in Isosceles has a current value of about
$140 million, an A&P spokesman said. "We decided not to put
any more of our funds into Isosceles at this time, because we
feel we have enough invested as it is," he said. "But we
recognize the need for Isosceles to refinance, and this
equity will help them."</p>
