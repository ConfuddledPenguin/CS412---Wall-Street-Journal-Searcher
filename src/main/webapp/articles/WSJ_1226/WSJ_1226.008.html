	<p class="article-leader">The dollar weakened in light Tokyo trading Tuesday after
having risen Monday in European and U.S. dealings.
   The greenback was quoted late in Tokyo Tuesday at 135.95
yen, below 136.00 yen late Monday in New York but up from
135.70 yen late Friday in Tokyo. Tokyo markets were closed
Monday to honor the Japanese emperor's birthday. U.S. and
European markets were closed yesterday for the Christmas
holidays.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The U.S. currency also finished in Tokyo at 1.5380 marks,
lower than 1.5440 marks late Monday in New York but well
above 1.5088 marks in Tokyo Friday.</p>
<p>In Tokyo early Wednesday, the dollar was trading at 136.28
yen, and at about 1.5390 marks.</p>
<p>The main feature of Tuesday's trading was the mark's
modest firming against the yen, which traders attributed both
to profit-taking in the yen and short-covering of mark
positions. The short-mark positions were acquired during the
German currency's fall of roughly two yen following the
resignation of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
late last week.</p>
<p>The German currency, thought to be the most vulnerable
among major currencies to instability in the Soviet Union,
found support at around the 88.20-yen level, where
participants began the covering of short-mark positions. To
be short a currency means, in essence, betting that the
currency will fall.</p>
<p>Late in the Tokyo session, the mark was trading at 88.39
yen, up from 88.08 late Monday in New York but well below
89.93 yen in Tokyo Friday. The mark opened the Tokyo session
Tuesday at 88.05 yen.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, traders say the dollar continues to draw
support from fears of war in the Persian Gulf, ahead of the
approaching Jan. 15 deadline set by the United Nations for a
peaceful Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. The greenback is also
benefiting from concern over possible political turmoil in
the Soviet Union. The dollar has traditionally served as a
"haven" for investors in times of turmoil.</p>
<p>Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze, long a close ally of
President Mikhail Gorbachev, resigned from his post to
protest to what he called growing dictatorship in his
country.</p>
<p>On Monday, the dollar had gained in thin pre-holiday
dealings in Europe and the U.S. as traders troubled by the
Mideast crisis and Soviet political instability moved to
cover any short-dollar positions. The mark was the market's
wallflower as participants abandoned long-mark positions
across the board.</p>
<p>"When you look at the political makeup in the Soviet
sector and ask who's most susceptible, Germany comes out loud
and clear," said Marc Cohen, vice president of corporate
foreign exchange at Fuji Bank in New York, citing Germany's
proximity to and investments in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The Shevardnadze resignation "tacked on a minimum of five
pfennigs," or 0.05 mark, to the dollar's trading range, said
Jerry Egan, chief dealer at Bank of Boston in Boston. The
question now is whether that boost will serve as a catalyst
for a larger dollar rally once the market returns to normal
after the year-end holidays.</p>
<p>European and U.S. trading institutions mostly operated
with skeleton staffs and closed early for Christmas Eve. In
these conditions, the effects of each transaction were
amplified, causing wider swings in exchange rates than would
have been seen in a more liquid market.</p>
<p>Although the market's lack of liquidity draws into
question the durability of the dollar's recent gains, many
technical traders were calling the rally significant.</p>
<p>Mary Ingrassia, customer dealer at Bank of Tokyo in New
York, said that since the U.S. currency broke and remained
above 1.50 marks, participants have been viewing 1.55 marks
as the next objective. The dollar stopped just shy of that
goal Monday, hitting an intraday high of 1.5470 marks.</p>
<p>There was no gold trading on the Commodity Exchange in New
York Monday or yesterday. Hong Kong markets were closed
Wednesday for a holiday.</p>
