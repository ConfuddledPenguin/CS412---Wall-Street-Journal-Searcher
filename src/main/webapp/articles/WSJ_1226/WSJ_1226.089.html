	<p class="article-leader">Though trading activity was light Monday -- most U.S.
commodity markets were closed for a long weekend in
observance of Christmas -- concern remained high about the
severe weather that has hit the West Coast and is moving
east.
   Southern California over the weekend was sent reeling by
record and near-record low temperatures in the citrus-growing
San Joaquin Valley. Readings ranged from the low teens to the
low 20s on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights, according to
Peter Leavitt, vice president of Weather Services Corp., of
Bedford, Mass.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Preliminary estimates indicated considerable damage to
fruit still on the trees," Mr. Leavitt said.</p>
<p>Some California groves have equipment to combat cold
spells, Mr. Leavitt said. There is some heating equipment,
but mostly it consists of very powerful fans, mounted on
towers that take warmer air 30 to 50 feet above the ground
and drive it down toward the ground to dispel the cold air
that collects there, he said. Even helicopters are used
sometimes for this purpose, he said.</p>
<p>"In this case, the cold was so deep and extended so high
above the towers that the fans were ineffective," Mr. Leavitt
said.</p>
<p>The effect of the freeze damage will be to sharply reduce
or wipe out the supply of California oranges that are used
for fresh fruit. More orange juice than normal will be
created because damaged oranges will be salvaged by using
them for juice, he said.</p>
<p>Normally, only a minor portion of the California orange
crop goes to juice. Prior to the frost, California was
expected to produce an estimated 20 million gallons of juice,
compared with Florida's 236 million gallons. Florida itself
is in the process of rebounding from the devastating frost
that hit that state's citrus-growing areas last Christmas.</p>
<p>Mr. Leavitt said the current West Coast freeze is the
worst since January 1937, when the citrus-growing industry
was in its infancy in California.</p>
<p>Temperatures in California are expected to moderate as
this week goes on, but turn colder again at the weekend, Mr.
Leavitt said.</p>
<p>None of this cold weather, however, is expected to reach
Florida, according to Mr. Leavitt. Lowest temperatures in the
Florida citrus belt will remain well above freezing during
the week, ranging mostly in the 40s and 50s, he said.</p>
<p>In other commodity markets Monday:</p>
<p>GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Political tensions in the Soviet
Union depressed grain futures prices as traders worried that
a retreat to authoritarianism in that country would dim
prospects for U.S. food aid.</p>
<p>In a public statement, a KGB official said that a
crackdown might be necessary to quell unrest, analysts said.
Such a crackdown might cause the Bush administration to
rethink the $1 billion in food credits it has granted to the
shortage-plagued country, they said.</p>
<p>In light pre-holiday trading Monday, the price of the corn
futures contract for March delivery declined 0.75 cent, to
$2.3325 a bushel; the price of the soybean contract for
January delivery fell 0.5 cent to $5.6225 a bushel.</p>
<p>Foreign demand for U.S. corn and soybeans already is
anemic: Soybean exports are at their lowest since 1974, and
corn sales to foreign customers this year trail last year's
sales by 510 million bushels. Any reduction of the
administration's announced credit allocation would exert
downward pressure on soybean and corn futures prices,
analysts said. Moreover, a return to dictatorship in the
Soviet Union would all but eliminate prospects for the
administration to grant more credits to buy U.S. grain early
in the new year.</p>
<p>In addition to the Soviet leadership's ominous
pronouncements, the World Bank in an International Monetary
Fund report said food aid to the Soviet Union will do little
to help the country until a free-market economy is
established there. "It basically said that all this food aid
from countries around the world is going into a black hole,"
said Daniel Basse, grain analyst for AgResource Co., Chicago.
Traders weren't encouraged by the report, Mr. Basse said.</p>
<p>LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Pork futures prices declined slightly
on expectations that more hogs will come to slaughter when
the current cold snap eases, analysts said. The cold weather
has slowed shipment of hogs, but farmers are expected to make
up the slack when conditions improve. In light trading
Monday, the pork belly futures contract for February delivery
fell 0.42 cent to 64.2 cents a pound; the hog contract for
February delivery declined 0.3 cent to 48.77 cents a pound.</p>
