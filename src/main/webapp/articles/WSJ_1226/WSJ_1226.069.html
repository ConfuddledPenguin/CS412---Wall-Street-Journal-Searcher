	<p class="article-leader">California Governor George Deukmejian shortly will join
Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher in private life. As he
leaves the helm of the world's eighth-largest economy, the
liberal pundits say his state is in disarray. His eight years
in office have been much like those of the nation at large
over the same years: explosive growth and change, divided
government and, in the end, malaise.
   In some ways, California has simply been more manic.
Already a megastate, it grew by fully a quarter in the past
decade. Much of that influx came from abroad: Mexico,
especially, and East Asia, but also in large numbers from
places you might not expect, such as Iran and India. As late
as 1982, more citizens were naturalized in New York state,
but now California has twice as many yearly. In the years
1982-88, foreigners accounted for 1.1 million of California's
3.6 million new residents. The smaller number doesn't include
children born after their parents' arrival.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Much as we like to see the doors to opportunity in this
country open, there's no denying the tumult that accompanies
large-scale immigration. Urban schools are jammed, hospital
emergency rooms become doctor's offices of first resort,
uninsured motorists contribute to traffic havoc and, yes,
some newcomers are disposed to long-term welfare and crime.
Where Californians sense wear and tear on their society, much
of it is caused by demographics beyond the control of any
Governor.</p>
<p>Mr. Deukmejian nevertheless prided himself on prudent
governance, and the state's high bond rating testifies to it.
In some areas, such as mental facilities and thrift
supervision, managerial corners were cut. But with all the
California commotion came a remarkably pliant and robust
economy; one in every seven new American jobs was to be found
there. But prosperity isn't purely a natural phenomenon; it
can be squashed under a load of taxes and regulation. Under
politically difficult conditions, George Deukmejian mostly
acted to check that burden.</p>
<p>He was not considered the conservative choice when first
nominated in 1982, having initially opposed the tax revolt
that began to sweep the state four years earlier. But he
acted to safeguard most of the tax-relief measures that put
California's burden near the middle of the 50 states instead
of the top. And beginning with his first budget, he showed
the tremendous power that a line-item veto can wield. He
lopped $6.8 billion from state spending in that manner.</p>
<p>As with Ronald Reagan's presidency, the liberals have
never forgiven Mr. Deukmejian's refusal to allow them a
general tax increase. They call this a failure of leadership.
Yet with the Democratic Legislature, state spending grew by
double-digit percentages for most of his term.</p>
<p>The Governor did make one major concession -- in our view,
a mistaken and fateful one. This past June, he led a
"bipartisan" drive to double the state's gasoline tax and
relax its constitutional limits on spending. He did so
because he believed it was the only way to gain significant
highway improvements and provide some budgetary leeway the
schools lobby had sought to deny him. With Democrats backing
the plan, it carried narrowly and briefly gave rise to
tax-revolt obituaries around the country.</p>
<p>Like others across the nation, Mr. Deukmejian's
transportation department has opened up to market-oriented
approaches to cutting congestion, but as long as freeways are
expanded they will continue to fill up because they are . . .
free. Meanwhile, with the Governor's partial blessing,
California has set off on a rail-transit binge that will cost
taxpayers dearly before it is over.</p>
<p>Mr. Deukmejian is a former prosecutor, and his heart has
always been in putting criminals behind bars. He and other
factors have had enormous impact in that area -- California's
prison population has tripled, the number of supervised
parolees quadrupled. Yet the justice system buckles under the
caseload weight, many arrestees walk, and the state may not
end up a good test of whether locking up large numbers on
drug-related charges will improve society's lot.</p>
<p>On many other issues, the Governor has greatly deferred to
the traditional Republican constituency of organized
business. Where that orientation has led him to contest a
culture of overregulation and high ancillary costs such as
workers' comp and torts, his restraint has helped the broader
entrepreneurial climate.</p>
<p>The Governor's admirable fortitude in so often saying
"no," however, was not always complemented by imaginative,
affirmative policies to enhance liberty. Empowerment
initiatives have yet to gain a powerful voice in California.
For all his battles with the education claque, Mr. Deukmejian
wouldn't take up the choice mantle. And his best shot at
shelter for the masses was billions in "affordable housing"
bonds. We suspect a "new paradigm" is likely to prove
necessary to break free from entrenched poverty, stagflation
and crime.</p>
<p>Still, California's outgoing chief executive strikes a
model politicians in other states and future times should
ponder. In the course of the political horse trading that
will accompany and often dilute bold concepts, voters are
also going to value officials with the steadfast, quiet
conservatism George Deukmejian embodied.</p>
