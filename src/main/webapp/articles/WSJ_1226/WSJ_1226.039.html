	<p class="article-leader">New York -- Those of us who have long observed that
off-Broadway possesses the vitality that used to glisten on
the Great White Way itself are finding it hard to defend that
position this season. Of course, it's only December -- and
yet to come are a Sondheim musical, a complete Henry IV at
the Public, and a David Mamet adaptation of "The Three
Sisters." But so far there's nothing new off-Broadway likely
to last more than a few weeks. Nor is there anything that apt
to off its "off" prefix and follow the examples of "Six
Degrees of Separation," "Once on This Island" and "Prelude to
a Kiss," three O-B shows upgraded to B-status earlier this
year.
   Of all the plays that have opened off-Broadway in the past
month, Richard Greenberg's "The American Plan" (Manhattan
Theater Club) promises much and therefore disappoints most.
Mr. Greenberg is a talented playwright with a gift for
dialogue. He has made a specialty of writing about smart,
articulate people on the fringes of society. "Eastern
Standard," an earlier play, is about a man dying of AIDS and
some yuppies who adopt a homeless woman.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Each of the five characters in "The American Plan" is
disaffected in some way: Lili, an emotionally unstable poor
little rich girl who longs for a Prince Charming to sweep her
away; her manipulative mother, Eva, who's a refugee from the
Nazis; their black housekeeper, whose Sphinx-like decorum
masks some never-explained anger; Lili's too-perfect,
boy-next-door suitor, Nick; and a shifty stranger who
disrupts Lili's love affair.</p>
<p>Act I revolves around Lili and Nick's budding romance, and
Eva's savage attempts to sabotage the match while seemingly
encouraging it. Joan Copeland makes a fascinating Eva. Her
grand gestures and exuberant manner are tinged with menace.
Wendy Makkena is equally fine as Lili, radiant and witty with
Nick, sullen and spiteful with her mother. At intermission
we're left with two not uninteresting questions: Will Eva
succeed in tearing the lovers apart and is Lili emotionally
strong enough to break free of her clutches?</p>
<p>When the curtain rises on Act II, however, these questions
have been dropped and the focus shifts to the far duller
Nick, who has to come to terms with a homosexual episode from
his past. Does he really love Lili or only her money? Can he
marry her and live a double life as a closet homosexual?
These are not uninteresting questions either, but they are
only tentatively explored. Moreover, they come out of the
blue -- there's little hint of them in the first act. It's
almost as if Mr. Greenberg folded another play into the one
he started to write. I missed Eva and Lili. As a play about
mother love, "The American Plan" shows much promise. As one
about homosexual love, it's pretty mundane.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Mother love is the subject, too, of "The Caucasian Chalk
Circle," Brecht's famous play about a kitchen maid who
rescues a baby abandoned by its rich mother and the
Solomon-like judge who must determine the better parent. In
George Wolfe's imaginative staging at the Public, the setting
is moved from Soviet Georgia to Papa Doc's Haiti. The actors
speak in musical (though not always consistent) island
accents, and reggae tunes syncopate in the background.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolfe's production highlights the highly allegorical
nature of Brecht's play, which is about the triumph of
goodness and justice in this otherwise wicked world. The
evildoers are larger than life -- quite literally in a couple
of cases thanks to outlandish costuming. And the good folks
do a lot of singing and dancing that I suspect would surprise
Brecht.</p>
<p>This is all extremely diverting -- even considering that
it goes on for nearly three hours. But is it Brechtian? To my
mind, it's rather too much of merry romp. It's not possible
to take the heavies seriously -- even when they wear
jackboots. A happy ending is never in serious doubt. Of
course, now that the totalitarianism that Brecht was
inveighing against in 1948 is on the decline even in the
Caucasus, perhaps it's fair to take a happy ending for
granted.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>A merry romp about which I have absolutely no
philosophical reservations is "Daugherty & Field
Off-Broadway," a sparkling two-man revue at the Double Image
Theater in Soho.</p>
<p>Bill Daugherty and Robin Field are a smooth cabaret team
who, after several hot years on the cigarette-and-martini
circuit, are seeing if they can hold the attention of an
audience not working its way through a two-drink minimum.</p>
<p>Their show really isn't much different from one they would
deliver in a nightclub -- just two guys in dinner jackets
tinkling the ivories, crooning some oldies and cracking some
goofy jokes. They specialize in tunes from the '20s, '30s and
'40s, including some gag songs (my favorite is their
rendition of Spike Jones's "Pagliacci," a hillbilly ode to
opera). Not surprisingly, they devote a lot of time to
Broadway melodies -- in fact, they probably deserve a place
in the Guinness Book of World Records for cramming the most
showtunes into a single medley.</p>
<p>Mr. Daugherty, who looks as if he's in his early 20s, is a
glorious Irish tenor with a cockeyed Midwestern
wholesomeness. Mr. Field is a fortysomething sophisticate
with a lighter voice but classier patter. He plays the piano
with panache and it's his snappy arrangements that tie the
numbers together. Together, they provide a nostalgic,
cheerful evening. It's almost enough to make a girl take up
cigarettes and martinis.</p>
