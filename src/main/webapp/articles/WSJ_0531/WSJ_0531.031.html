	<p class="article-leader">BRIDGEPORT, Conn. -- First Connecticut Small Business
Investment Co., which lends to and invests in small-business
concerns, said it will omit its dividend indefinitely, citing
poor results and falling values in the New England real
estate that secures many of its loans.
   The quarterly cash dividend of 25 cents a share was last
paid Jan. 26. The company had a loss of $460,667, or 39 cents
a share, for its fourth quarter ended March 31, according to
David Engelson, president. For the fiscal year, First
Connecticut's earnings declined 42% to $1.2 million, or $1.05
a share, from a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Engelson said the dividend omission will help the
company conserve cash, but he emphasized that First
Connecticut remains "basically solid. We just want to see our
earnings before declaring a dividend." Dividend payments
amounted to about $1.1 million in fiscal 1990, and about $2.3
million in fiscal 1989, when an extra dividend of $1 was
paid, he said.</p>
<p>First Connecticut shares plunged $1.875, to close at
$9.50, in American Stock Exchange composite trading
yesterday.</p>
