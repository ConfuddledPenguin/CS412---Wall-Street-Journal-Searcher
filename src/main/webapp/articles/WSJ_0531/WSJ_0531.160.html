	<p class="article-leader">Last spring jazz impresario Norman Granz, who among other
things has produced most of Ella Fitzgerald's records since
1956, mentioned casually to me that he was doing an album
with Fitzgerald in a week. I was surprised. Neither had been
in a studio for nearly four years. I wanted to be there.
   "Do you think I could be a fly on the wall," I asked.
Okay, he said, but he'd have to check with Ella first. A few
days later he called back. "Sorry," he said. "It's her first
session in a long time, and she's not that sure of herself or
how well it will go. She'd rather not."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>". . . Not sure of herself." It sounded ominous. After
all, she'd been hospitalized for respiratory problems in
1985; undergone bypass surgery in August 1986; and cut back
her concerts to fewer than a dozen a year since. Under the
circumstances, what could one expect?</p>
<p>A few weeks ago the album came out, "All that Jazz" (Pablo
Records 3210-398, all formats). And it is proof of what comes
when a frail-looking, semi-retired, 72-year-old singer,
perhaps insecure in her music, tries for a feeble last
hurrah. Right? Well surprise] It's a wonderful album. Backed
by Benny Carter, Clark Terry and Harry Edison, she moves
gracefully through 10 standards ("Dream a Little Dream of
Me," "Jersey Bounce") with command to spare.</p>
<p>There's nothing frail about Ella Fitzgerald. In fact, 1990
will be her busiest year in a long time. Her company, Salle
Productions (Ellas spelled backward), has scheduled nearly 30
concerts, including Minneapolis June 16 and the New York JVC
Jazz Festival June 29.</p>
<p>To see her craft in context, it may help to remember that
inside every singer there lives an actor and a musician. The
actor aims for the heart and soul; the musician, for the head
and feet. But each singer ultimately leans one way at the
expense of the other, so it's the actor-musician ratio that
ultimately defines a singer's most fundamental focus.
Singer-actors see a lyric as a role. They inhabit its
character and magnify its emotions by making you believe it's
their personal statement.</p>
<p>The secret of artists from Al Jolson to Judy Garland to
almost any rock singer is their sense of theater, not their
musicology. Singer-musicians, on the other hand, tackle a
song more in instrumental terms. The drama of its lyric is
less important than the abstractness of its melodic and
harmonic logic. And when words get in the way, they twist
them into knots or toss them off entirely in favor of
wordless voice-as-an-instrument improvisation.</p>
<p>Singers from Louis Armstrong to Mel Torme to Bobby
McFerrin make up a line of musicians who happen to sing. And
bestriding this lineage like the proverbial colossus is Ella
Fitzgerald.</p>
<p>If her clear, youthful voice has been nature's gift to her
art, the musicianship that drives it is all hers. Yet it was
fate, not training, that led her into singing only after
dancing failed. She joined the Chick Webb band at 17 in 1935
and quickly made it her appendage. Decca saw to it that most
of Webb's records featured her vocals. Today they hold up
poorly.</p>
<p>Her sound is adolescent. Her style follows period pop
conventions. And for every good tune she gets ("Don't Worry
'Bout Me"), there are a dozen pieces of junk ("Chew Your
Bubble Gum"). After Webb's death in 1939, Decca built her as
a single, and for the next 17 years she muddled along as a
moderately interesting pop singer who sang what she was told
and never got out of second gear. Today there is not a single
CD in release from Fitzgerald's long Decca era.</p>
<p>By the late '40s, though, there was another Ella emerging,
one nurtured and managed by Mr. Granz. This Ella sang only
the best songs. And in Granz's open-ended "Jazz at the
Philharmonic" concerts she had the space and freedom to
perform with the finest musicians of her generation.</p>
<p>Fitzgerald had always had a knack for mimicking other
singers. In the JATP concerts she began mimicking the
musicians. She coined an uncanny vocabulary of semiverbal
onomatopoeia that expressed the subtlest nuances of swing
improvisation -- its attack, smears, curves, phrasing,
vibrato and pulse. Coupled with an overdrive falsetto
reserve, she met players such as Oscar Peterson and Ben
Webster on their terms and dazzled audiences. ("Ella
Fitzgerald at the Opera House" on a Verve/PolyGram CD is a
superb 1957 sampling of her JATP fireworks.)</p>
<p>There was a problem, though. Mr. Granz may have managed
Ella, but Decca still managed her recording career, which was
not distinguished. For 10 years she was partitioned between
two sovereigns. Then in 1956 fate handed Mr. Granz powerful
leverage. Decca, which owned Universal Pictures, was
anticipating with pleasure big profits from the soundtrack
album of Universal's "Benny Goodman Story." Until, that is,
Mr. Granz jumped out of the bushes waving exclusive contracts
with most of the film's star musicians.</p>
<p>His price for their release? A buy-out of Fitzgerald's
contract. Decca reluctantly surrendered, and a reunified Ella
Fitzgerald promptly went to Mr. Granz's Verve label.</p>
<p>There, in the second week of February 1956, she made the
first of the masterpieces that would put her among the
immortals: "Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Cole Porter Song Book"
(Verve/PolyGram CD 82l-989/990). Other song books followed --
Ellington, Gershwin, Berlin, Rodgers, etc. Then loads of
Pablo albums in the '70s and '80s with everyone from Count
Basie to Andre Previn to Nelson Riddle.</p>
<p>What does this body of work tell us about Fitzgerald and
her contributions? First, her song books have helped change
the way we think about our popular music. Without being
stuffy about it, she showed that it was all right to take
good popular music seriously; that the best of it had a life
outside the zeitgeist that produced it; that there was an
almost classical essence inside it that could be given
something approaching a definitive interpretation.</p>
<p>She treated our greatest songwriters as composers; their
music as a body of work. A lot of the respectability that
"the American popular song" enjoys today exists because
Fitzgerald sang it. She has served both art and commerce
without pandering. Her commercial albums have shown a respect
for the mass market rare in popular culture. And her jazz
albums have been so consistently good, critics seem to have
given up finding fault, except perhaps for the creeping
redundancy of the Pablos. As for me, I'd rather hear her
fifth version of "Don't Be That Way" any day than not hear
her at all. Or worse, hear her sing the Barry Manilow song
book.</p>
<p>Although her mannerisms are familiar, her technique and
sense of proportion have held them in balance. Fifty-five
years in the big time -- 30 of them as an icon -- have not
come between Ella and the kind of artist she is. She never
fell into the kind of self-caricature that, say, Billie
Holiday became. Self-destruction brought out the actor in
Billie at the expense of the musician. If the musician in
Fitzgerald should ever fail, the actor in her could not pick
up the slack.</p>
<p>Few singers are as dependent upon pure musicianship as she
is. Or have such reserves of it. More important still, she's
never groveled to the god of nostalgia because she's never
attached herself to the cycles of fashion that nostalgia
feeds on. The elite aesthetics Mr. Granz has underwritten for
her these 34 years have given her distance without isolation
in the protected sanctuary of mainstream jazz. If she had
self doubts, she never embarrassed us with them by doing Cole
Porter in disco (as her only peer, Frank Sinatra, once did).
Her values have been as consistent as her musicianship. It
hardly matters now that she no longer seriously scouts for
new repertoire. Her core capital appreciates more every year.</p>
