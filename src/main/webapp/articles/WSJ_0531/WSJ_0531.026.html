	<p class="article-leader">For small businesses that have been victims of a
nationwide federal contracting scandal, help may be on the
way.
   Today, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah) is scheduled to preside
over a fact-finding meeting in Washington that could
eventually lead to Congress's appropriating funds to repay
firms hurt by so-called individual sureties, says an aide to
Sen. Hatch.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Subcontractors and government officials will discuss with
Mr. Hatch surety problems they have encountered and means to
help the victims. Some federal investigators estimate such
sureties have cheated small businesses out of tens of
millions of dollars in the scandal.</p>
<p>At the same time, however, a separate effort in Congress
seeks to revive the individual-surety business -- just as it
is dying out in the face of tough new federal regulations.
This time, fans of the measure say, small businesses will be
safeguarded.</p>
<p>An individual surety is supposed to be a well-heeled
person who for a fee from the prime contractor provides
financial-guarantee bonds on a government building project.
If the prime contractor fails to finish the job, the surety
is supposed to step in and make sure that the work gets done
and that all the subcontractors get paid, even if some of the
money has to come from his own pocket.</p>
<p>Government contracting officials say the use of individual
sureties grew sharply in recent years as contractors found it
increasingly difficult to get bonding from insurance
companies.</p>
<p>As reported in this newspaper and elsewhere over the past
year, the individual-surety market was invaded in recent
years by individuals whose prime asset turned out to be an
ability to vastly inflate their own net worth on financial
statements. Many of these bogus financial statements slipped
by federal contracting officers and weren't discovered until
the building jobs went sour and subcontractors weren't paid.</p>
<p>In February, federal acquisition regulations were changed
to substantially toughen rules on individual sureties. For
instance, if a surety wants to claim real estate on his net
worth statement, he has to prove his ownership and the value
of the property. He also must give the government a lien on
the property until the job is done, says J. William Green, a
Navy contracting attorney.</p>
<p>Since the new regulations went into effect, "the number of
contractors using individual sureties has shrunk to almost
nothing" around the country, says Albert Proctor, an attorney
with the Army Corps of Engineers. Before the rule changes,
some government agencies estimated that individual sureties
were appearing on more than 10% of their construction jobs.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the new rules may be too effective, says
Mr. Green, the Navy attorney who has been a vocal advocate of
tougher individual-surety regulations. Now "all those
small-business men who used individual sureties have a chance
to argue that they can't get any of the {government
contracting} action because the rules are too stringent."</p>
<p>Which is exactly what some businessmen and their
representatives are arguing. The new individual-surety rules
"have had a devastating impact on our members," says Ralph
Thomas, executive director of the National Association of
Minority Contractors, a Washington, D.C.-based trade group.</p>
<p>Partly because minority contractors tend to be smaller and
newer than their white counterparts, they have had a more
difficult time getting insurance-company bonding and have
relied on individual sureties, he says. Mr. Thomas estimates
that up to 75% of his members that do government construction
contracting have been hurt by the new rules.</p>
<p>In response to such complaints, Rep. Cardiss Collins, an
Illinois Democrat, is sponsoring a bill to authorize a pilot
project that would allow individual sureties to form
self-policing associations. These groups would ensure that
claims against individual members got paid. Critics worry
that such a plan would simply pool bad risks and wouldn't
significantly reduce the risk of abuse. The House Government
Activities and Transportation subcommittee, which Ms. Collins
chairs, has scheduled a hearing next Wednesday on the
individual-surety issue.</p>
<p>What makes the debate particularly vexing is that for
every contractor who has been hurt by the tough new rules,
there seems to be a subcontractor hurt by the old lax rule.
For example, Camilo Ramirez says he is owed over $98,000 for
masonry work his small firm did in 1988 on a building project
for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in
California. When the prime contractor failed to pay, the
individual sureties also failed to come up with the money.</p>
<p>The absence of that money left him unable to pay his
workers or keep up payments on his equipment, which was
eventually repossessed, says Mr. Ramirez. Creditors are
hounding him for thousands of dollars of unpaid bills and his
business, which he spent eight years building, is essentially
closed down. The financial stress contributed to the breakup
of his marriage, says the 37-year-old Mr. Ramirez. "This has
ruined my life. I have nothing now," he adds.</p>
<p>He does have some unhappy company in the form of about two
dozen other subcontractors who say they are owed a total of
$2.8 million on the same NASA job. These firms have banded
together to demand the federal government pay them, and
representatives of some of these firms are to meet with Sen.
Hatch today.</p>
<p>Getting Uncle Sam to pony up in such matters is a tall
order, concedes John Tacke, the subcontractors' attorney. The
government aimed to keep itself out of such payment disputes
by requiring sureties.</p>
<p>A NASA spokeswoman said the agency believes it acted
properly on the contracts.</p>
<p>Sen. Hatch is looking at introducing special legislation
to pay these subcontractors and others "who fell into the pit
before the surety rules were changed," says Robert Lockwood,
an aide to the senator. Already, he adds, more than a dozen
senators have expressed interest in co-sponsoring such a
measure.</p>
