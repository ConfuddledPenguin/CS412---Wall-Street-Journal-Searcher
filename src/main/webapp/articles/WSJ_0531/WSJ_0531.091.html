	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- The Supreme Court of Ontario blocked a plan by
Canadian Pacific Ltd. to spin off its real-estate unit to its
common shareholders, saying that holders of preference shares
who aren't included in the transaction would be hurt.
   In his ruling, Justice A.M. Austin said Canadian Pacific's
proposed 767 million Canadian dollar (US$650 million) spinoff
of Marathon Realty Co. wasn't necessary and wouldn't benefit
Canadian Pacific. While the spinoff would enrich Canadian
Pacific's holders of common shares, it would leave fewer
assets in the company from which to pay preference-share
dividends, Mr. Austin said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The judgment was a surprise because Mr. Austin had ruled
on April 23 that holders of preference shares weren't legally
entitled to participate in the spinoff, which was devised as
a dividend to Canadian Pacific's common shareholders. Holders
of preference shares are appealing the April 23 ruling. But
in his latest decision, Mr. Austin said Canadian Pacific also
must show that the spinoff is fair to holders of preference
shares.</p>
<p>Under Canadian law, Canadian Pacific must obtain court
approval for a spinoff, which represents a "fundamental
change" in the company's corporate structure.</p>
<p>A lawyer for Canadian Pacific said the Montreal-based
railway, resources, telecommunications and real-estate
concern is studying its options: whether to appeal the
court's decision; submit a revised spinoff plan; provide
other compensation for Canadian Pacific preference-share
holders; or scrap the spinoff plan. The company has 30 days
in which to appeal Mr. Austin's ruling to the Ontario Court
of Appeal, the province's highest court.</p>
<p>As reported, at Canadian Pacific's annual meeting on May
2, its common shareholders voted 90% in favor of the
company's proposal to spin off 80% of Marathon through a
share distribution.</p>
<p>Under the plan, Canadian Pacific would keep 20% of
Marathon, but the real estate unit's 99 million shares
outstanding would make it Canada's most widely held public
real-estate concern. Marathon's assets, which have a market
value of more than C$4 billion, include office buildings in
Canada and the U.S. and prime undeveloped land in railway
corridors in downtown Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver.</p>
<p>At the annual meeting, common shareholders also narrowly
approved a shareholder-rights plan that would make it
prohibitively expensive to launch a takeover bid for Canadian
Pacific. Observers saw the spinoff of Marathon as another
important anti-takeover measure.</p>
<p>Holders of Canadian Pacific's preference shares are led by
the Fielding family of Sudbury, Ontario, which holds about
82% of the shares.</p>
<p>The latest ruling could delay Marathon's debut as a public
company for months if the decision is appealed. For several
weeks, Marathon has been trading in the so-called gray
market, where investors are exchanging promises to buy or
sell the stock after it is listed on the Toronto Stock
Exchange.</p>
<p>Marathon shares were quoted yesterday in gray market
trading at C$7.86 to C$8, up from C$7.75 to C$7.86 on Tuesday
when the court ruling was issued. In composite trading on the
New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Canadian Pacific common
closed at $18.75, up 25 cents, on volume of 648,300 shares.</p>
