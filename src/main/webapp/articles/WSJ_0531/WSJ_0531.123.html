	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- A former employee has sued Smith Barney,
Harris Upham & Co. for allegedly forcing employees to resell
stock to the securities firm just before a merger with
Primerica Inc. in 1987.
   According to a complaint filed in Los Angeles Superior
Court by John L. Heath, a former first vice president in
Smith Barney's San Francisco office, the firm falsely claimed
it had the right to force repurchase of shares owned by
employees in Sbhu Holdings Inc. The suit, which seeks
class-action status, is requesting unspecified damages.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Heath said he bought blocks of stock annually in the
holding company, under a company stock-purchase plan,
accumulating shares with a book value of more than $300,000
between 1979 and 1985.</p>
<p>In his complaint, the executive said he left the company
in 1985 and was subsequently told three times by Smith Barney
that he must sell portions of the shares back at book value.
The last repurchase of about $200,000 of shares came just two
months before the Primerica acquisition, Mr. Heath alleges in
his suit.</p>
<p>It was common practice among Wall Street brokerage
partnerships to require partners who resigned to gradually
sell back their stock in the partnerships. Smith Barney was a
partnership before being acquired by Primerica, and had such
a stock buy-back plan.</p>
<p>The complaint says that Smith Barney breached its
fiduciary duty to employees because it didn't disclose the
pending acquisition by Primerica in which shares were
acquired at more than double book value.</p>
<p>Richard Callahan Jr., Mr. Heath's attorney, said, "The
company had the right to buy back the stock under certain
terms of the employee agreements, but those terms weren't
met. It's our position, and we intend to prove, that there
must have been awareness that at least negotiations {to merge
with Primerica} were going on, and employees should have been
given knowledge of that." A Primerica official said the
company and its Smith Barney unit hadn't seen the complaint,
and couldn't comment.</p>
