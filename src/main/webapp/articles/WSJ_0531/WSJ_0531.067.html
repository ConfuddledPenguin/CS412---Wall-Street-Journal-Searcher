	<p class="article-leader">WAYNE, N.J. -- Lederle Laboratories was cleared to begin
marketing an antihypertensive drug that will be the first
direct competitor in the U.S. against the best-selling drugs
of G.D. Searle & Co. and Knoll Pharmaceuticals.
   The Food and Drug Administration's approval of the drug,
sold under the trade name Verelan, gives Lederle its first
entry in the big U.S. market for drugs called calcium channel
blockers that are made in once-a-day doses. Lederle had
licensed U.S. marketing rights to Verelan from Elan Corp.
after Elan applied for FDA approval.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Lederle, a division of American Cyanamid Co., will market
Verelan directly against Searle's Calan SR and Knoll's
Isoptin SR. All three drugs are formulated from the same
compound, known generically as verapamil.</p>
<p>But Elan, of Althone, Ireland, developed Verelan with its
own sustained-release technology and put the drug through its
own clinical trials. As a result, Verelan isn't classified as
a generic drug and probably won't start an intense price war.
A Lederle spokesman said that the pricing will be
"competitive" with that of the Searle and Knoll drugs.</p>
<p>In the U.S. in 1989, sales of Calan SR, which Searle
licenses from Knoll, were $364 million; U.S. sales of Isoptin
SR were about $90 million. Searle is a subsidiary of Monsanto
Co., St. Louis. Knoll is a subsidiary of BASF AG,
Ludwigshafen, West Germany.</p>
<p>Elan estimated annual U.S. sales of calcium channel
blockers at $1.5 billion. Several drugs of this class,
besides verapamil compounds, also are on the market. Their
uses include treating chest pains known as angina pectoris,
as well as treating high blood pressure.</p>
