	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Jack R. Meyer, treasurer of the Rockefeller
Foundation, emerged as the leading candidate to head Harvard
University's $5 billion endowment, people familiar with the
university said.
   The search to find a new president for the Harvard
Management Co., Harvard's investment arm, neared a conclusion
this week as the management company's board met on the issue.
People familiar with the situation said a formal announcement
of the choice is expected soon.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Meyer, a 1969 graduate of the Harvard Business School,
declined to comment.</p>
<p>The presidency of Harvard Management is considered one of
the premier jobs in the money-management business. In
addition to handling the nation's largest private university
endowment, Harvard Management has gained prestige in the
investment world as an early and large investor in such areas
as venture capital, oil and gas properties and leveraged
buy-outs.</p>
<p>While Mr. Meyer already holds a top investment job at the
Rockefeller Foundation, a move to Harvard would be a major
step up. Rockefeller Foundation has about $2 billion in
assets and relies heavily on outside money managers to handle
its investments. Harvard Management, on the other hand, is a
much larger organization, with a staff of about 115 people,
and manages many of its investments directly.</p>
<p>Harvard has been looking for a new endowment head since
January, when the university announced that Walter Cabot, the
only president of Harvard Management since it was set up in
1974, was stepping down, following a 1989 heart attack.</p>
<p>Finding a replacement for Mr. Cabot is believed to have
been a priority for Harvard University President Derek Bok,
who announced Tuesday that he planned to leave his post at
the end of the next academic year. A Harvard spokesman said
yesterday he wasn't aware of any announcement plans regarding
Mr. Cabot's replacement.</p>
<p>The selection of Mr. Meyer would be "a superb choice,"
said David Swensen, director of investments for the Yale
University endowment. "He's one of the most impressive
institutional fund managers I've ever met," Mr. Swensen said.</p>
