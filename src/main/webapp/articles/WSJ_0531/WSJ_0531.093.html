	<p class="article-leader">Brent Scowcroft has said that this week's meeting between
President Bush and President Gorbachev "will not be an arms
control summit." It will have to do with "what's going on in
the Soviet Union" and "with remaking a political map of
Europe."
   That gets our priorities about right. Moves toward free
economic and political choice in the Soviet empire are
redrawing the political map of all Eurasia. It is these
movements -- not arms agreements -- that are transforming and
reducing the Soviet threats that have preoccupied the West.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>U.S.-Soviet agreements to reduce arms and relocate troops
and equipment not only lag behind the reductions and
withdrawals demanded by the newly independent Eastern
European states (and needed by the shattered Soviet economy)
but have tended to slow them down. Second, arms agreements
focus excessively on two far-fetched contingencies: an
all-out conventional invasion through the center of Europe
and an unrestricted nuclear attack on thousands of targets in
the U.S. They ignore other Soviet threats -- ones that were
always more plausible and now are more transparently so.</p>
<p>Third, they neglect the increasing dangers presented by
the spread to many countries of nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons. And last, arms agreements try
artificially to separate the strategic and the nuclear
systems from theater and nonnuclear systems, even when they
are essentially the same -- as in the Soviet attempt in the
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty to constrain conventional
cruise missiles we need to meet a wide range of conventional
threats in any of several widely separated theaters.</p>
<p>Arms control bureaucracies treat arms control essentially
as a technical matter of matching numbers on each side. That
assumes wrongly that Soviet forces are in the center of
Europe only because our forces are there. It ignores the key
difference between NATO and the Warsaw Pact: The Soviets have
inserted troops in Eastern Europe by force, while NATO, a
voluntary organization of free, sovereign democracies, asked
for U.S. troops and can tell them to leave knowing that the
U.S. will do so -- as it did when it withdrew its forces from
France in the mid-1960s.</p>
<p>Unless U.S. and West European governments misguidedly
negotiate a continuance of the Soviet presence in East
Europe, the new democratic states there can make it
impossible for the Soviets to support their forces
logistically. The Soviets would have to use massive force to
keep them there. This is a most implausible course given
their other troubles. (Agreements can't lock in future Soviet
governments; the new political realities can lock them out.)
It is primarily the governments of Czechoslovakia, Hungary,
Poland and Germany that should negotiate the withdrawal of
Soviet forces. West Europe and the U.S. should help mainly by
providing moral support to these governments and perhaps,
like West Germany, help in financing civilian housing and
retraining in the Soviet Union for the demobilized soldiers.</p>
<p>The main aim of U.S. security policy in Europe should be
to let the democracies in the region decide what foreign
forces they will allow to be located within their own
boundaries. The same objective should animate the arms
agreements the U.S. supports. If the U.S. achieves this goal,
U.S. forces in West Germany will dwindle and Soviet forces in
East Europe will disappear without endangering Soviet
citizens.</p>
<p>U.S. arms control bureaucracies should also recognize that
it is the Soviet independence movements that will have the
dominant effect, beyond the center of Europe, on Western
interests world-wide.</p>
<p>In short, arguments that the U.S. must sacrifice the
democratic independence movements inside the Soviet Union in
order to get arms control agreements get things exactly
backward. By doing so, the U.S. would sacrifice or seriously
compromise the movements that are genuinely reducing threats
and making lower defense budgets feasible in return for
agreements that do little or nothing for either purpose.</p>
<p>The nationalism that moves so many parts of the Soviet
empire toward independence can have its flip side. The U.S.
wants such moves to be peaceful, but they may well be violent
-- especially if repressed.</p>
<p>The various nationalities are not only hostile to their
communist rulers, but have many old antagonisms among
themselves. But the Politburo is a very implausible defender
of any minority. In fact, it is Mr. Gorbachev's Politburo
that has been stirring up ethnic violence:</p>
<p>-- In Georgia in April 1989, Moscow authorized the use of
poison gas to end peaceful demonstrations and to incite
Georgian Christians against Moslem Meshketians.</p>
<p>-- In Azerbaijan, Moscow sent troops to Baku several days
after the Popular Front for Azerbaijan had stopped the
pogroms against Armenians. Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov
admitted that the presence of the troops had nothing to do
with separating the Azeris and Armenians but with the
destruction of the Azerbaijanian independence movement.</p>
<p>-- In Lithuania, Moscow sent in armored personnel carriers
ostensibly to protect the civil rights of Russian minorities
there; dropped leaflets from helicopters in an attempt to
rally the Russian minorities against the Lithuanians; and
imposed an economic blockade.</p>
<p>-- In Latvia and Estonia, the Soviet military led
simultaneous unarmed assaults on the legislatures.</p>
<p>All of these examples provide evidence of Moscow's
continuing attempts to stir ethnic antagonisms and to obscure
the fact that whatever reconciliation these nationalities
need to achieve with each other, they have in common an
unquenchable desire to be free of their Soviet rulers.</p>
<p>Over the past 70 years, the Soviet Union's leaders have
tried and failed to meld its citizens into one "Homo
sovieticus." They are even less likely to succeed now. Soviet
leaders have had little success in rallying even ethnic
Russians in support of holding on to the empire. Just this
week leaders in the Russian republic held the founding
meeting of the Democratic Party of the Russian Federation,
which favors immediate independence for all of the national
republics and immediate privatization and transition to a
free market.</p>
<p>The fanfare that greets every announcement by Mr.
Gorbachev that he has sweetened his offer to negotiate about
the secession of various republics cannot conceal the fact
that these concessions are so much smoke.</p>
<p>Take the case of Lithuania. Mr. Gorbachev has demanded
that before negotiations can begin the Lithuanians must
suspend their declaration of independence, thus admitting
that they are subject to Soviet law. That is the main point
stalling negotiations, but it is sharpened by the fact that
Mr. Gorbachev has designed the two laws that he rushed
through this year so as to make secession essentially
infeasible. One, a new secession law, outlines a nightmare
obstacle course.</p>
<p>First, it demands that a referendum on secession pass by a
majority of more than two-thirds. This majority must obtain
not only in each republic at large, but in each autonomous
subdivision or "place densely populated by an ethnic group"
within the republic. It's conceivable that Lithuania might be
able to get over this obstacle, but Latvia and Estonia, which
have been extensively colonized by the Soviets and whose
populations have been subject to extensive deportations,
might not.</p>
<p>Even if they did, independence would then have to be
approved by the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies, whose
2,250 members were elected only after the Communist Party had
rigorously screened all proposed candidates. Miraculously, a
few hundred free spirits slipped through the party net, but
not enough to give independence for one of the republics much
of a chance.</p>
<p>If somehow a republic cleared that second obstacle,
however, Mr. Gorbachev could assure that an application for
independence was withdrawn by using another drastic new law.
Under it, he has the power to impose direct presidential rule
in any of the republics and to replace the local authorities
with his own appointees. The Balts will remember how the
Soviets "replaced" the Hungarian leaders with whom they were
negotiating in 1956 and the leaders of the Prague Spring in
1968.</p>
<p>Finally, a new republic could secede only if it paid
compensation for Soviet investments in the territory. In
short, Mr. Gorbachev would ask the prisoners to pay for the
costs of their imprisonment.</p>
<p>For sheer gall this last requirement is the top. Soviet
authorities assert this right of compensation not only in the
relatively rich Baltic republics, but in other republics as
well, including -- as an example -- the impoverished Moslem
republic of Uzbekistan, whose natural endowment Soviet
planners ruined by an enormous ecological disaster -- the
shrinking of the largest inland sea in the world, the Sea of
Aral -- by poisoning the soil with a huge overload of
pesticides, and by destroying human capital through the
extensive use of child labor. Some accountant among the
central planners no doubt is totting up the cost of the
pesticides and the irrigation pipes and trenches that drained
the Sea of Aral. It's as if, instead of paying compensation
to the survivors of Hitler's Final Solution, Germany had
demanded compensation from Israel or from the Diaspora for
the expense of the gas ovens.</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev, as the Communist official answerable to the
party for the economy before he became its leader in March
1985, deserves credit for recognizing the need for drastic
economic restructuring. But he has swung wildly among
attempts to improve central planning, partial ventures into
decentralizing and halfway flirtations with the market and
private ownership.</p>
<p>Though an increasing number of his advisers have made
clear that nothing short of rapidly freeing markets and
instituting private property rights will do, he has
vacillated and reversed course and never indicated clearly
where he is headed. A master of oxymoron, he last week
launched his latest dash to "free" (regulated) markets. For
all his talk of pluralism and democracy, he has refused to
face the fact that the economic crisis in the Soviet Union
can be solved only by a move to economic freedom, and that
economic freedom is not feasible without political freedom.</p>
<p>All this suggests that:</p>
<p>a) Western policy should support a path of evolution in
communist empires rather than specific leaders such as Mr.
Gorbachev or Deng Xiaoping.</p>
<p>b) While there are sharp limits to what Western
governments can do to encourage paths of decolonization
favorable to Western security and they are most unlikely to
intervene militarily to counter crackdowns, they are not
helpless to affect events.</p>
<p>c) At a time when communist economies are in trouble,
Western governments can make clear that suppression of
independence movements will slow or stop access to Western
capital markets, technology and other assistance -- just as
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan reduced such access.
(President Bush's statement this week that Soviet treatment
of Lithuania is delaying Most Favored Nation status is a step
in the right direction.)</p>
<p>d) Western governments can make this clear not only by
private communications but by taking preliminary actions to
delay help. Whatever they say in public should be phrased not
only to minimize the loss of face on the part of communist
leaders, but the loss of credibility on the part of Western
governments.</p>
<p>e) Western governments should understand that even a
Soviet Union limited to Great Russia would be the most
formidable military power in Eurasia. At the same time, such
a Soviet Union, perhaps joined by other republics in a
voluntary confederation of states modeled on the British
Commonwealth (as Mr. Gorbachev has sometimes suggested),
would drastically reduce threats to U.S., European and
Japanese interests not only in Europe but in Asia and the
Mideast as well in precisely the same way as independence
movements in East Europe have reduced the threat in the
center of Europe.</p>
