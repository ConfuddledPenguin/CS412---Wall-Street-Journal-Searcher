	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A feud between families owning two
blue jeans companies was settled out of court yesterday when
Jordache agreed to give back its half-interest in Guess.
   The settlement came after a four-month trial and during
the jury's third day of deliberations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The terms for division of about $106 million held in an
escrow account weren't disclosed. Attorneys said all parties
had agreed not to disclose disposition of funds.</p>
<p>The family feud involved four Frenchborn Marciano brothers
-- Maurice, Armand, Paul and Georges -- who founded Guess in
1981, and three Israeli-born Nakash brothers -- Joe, Ralph
and Avi -- who own Jordache and who purchased a half-interest
in Guess in 1983.</p>
<p>The partnership disintegrated into allegations of fraud
and double-dealing that led to two separate trials to resolve
the claims.</p>
<p>"The parties agree and the court orders that the sale of
Guess stock by the Marcianos to the Nakashes is hereby
rescinded," said the settlement agreement filed in Los
Angeles Superior Court.</p>
<p>Under terms of the accord, the Nakashes returned to the
Marcianos a half-interest in Guess that they bought for just
under $5 million. The Marcianos won an earlier court fight in
which a jury determined that the Nakashes had defrauded the
Marcianos when they purchased the interest in the
then-fledgling company.</p>
<p>"It seemed like a senseless thing to ever have it happen,"
said Dennis Townsend, who was a juror in the lengthy trial.
"These people are supposedly such good friends, and it turned
into a war."</p>
