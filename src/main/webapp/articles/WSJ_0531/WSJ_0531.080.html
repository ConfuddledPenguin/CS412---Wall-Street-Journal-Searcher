	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- PPG Industries Inc. said it agreed to
acquire the two-thirds of Silenka B.V., a Netherlands-based
fiber glass producer, that the glass, chemical and glass
concern doesn't already own. Terms weren't disclosed.
   Silenka had 1989 sales of about $120 million. PPG will buy
the remaining two-thirds of Silenka from two other owners,
Akzo N.V., a chemical company, and a government investment
and development company. The sale is subject to government
and board approval.</p>
