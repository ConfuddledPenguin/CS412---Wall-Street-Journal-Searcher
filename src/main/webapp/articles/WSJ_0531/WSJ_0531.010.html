	<p class="article-leader">Knowing Leslie Combs II's "fondness for younger women was
legendary" ("Dead Horse Breeder Raises a Ruckus With a
Beneficiary," page one, April 25), Linda Mauk should have
taken special cautions to see that volunteers (not paid
staff) connected with the McDowell Cancer Foundation
cultivated the late Mr. Combs and involved themselves in all
his vicissitudes. As foundation director, her lack of
professional judgment with a major potential contributor
resulted in this unfortunate situation. She already has let
the issue fester by publicly involving the board and the
community. This can be ameliorated simply by Ms. Mauk doing
the honorable thing and resigning.
   The good work of the McDowell Cancer Foundation and the
needs of those yet to be served by its eleemosynary efforts
far outweigh the personalities and idiosyncrasies involved.
Let Mr. Combs speak from the grave -- that's the idea of a
legal and directed gift.</p>
