	<div class="article-body"><p>MONEY IS THE LEGAL TENDER of philanthropy, but it can take
forms other than cash. Sir Thomas Lipton, for example, the
Scottish-born master marketer and yachtsman who made
tea-drinking big business in the U.S., willed $4 million to
the poor of his native Glasgow. His successors at the Thomas
J. Lipton Co. (now a Unilever subsidiary) who, unlike Sir
Thomas, must explain their largesse to stockholders, are
celebrating their U.S. centennial by giving time and
expertise to a whole spectrum of causes.</p>
<p>When Blaine Hess, Lipton's president, called for
"something special" to add to the conventional 100-year
hoopla, his staff gave him the idea of using the company's
considerable marketing and promotion muscle to urge consumers
to volunteer for worthy causes.</p>
<p>The timing was right on the money. Volunteers can be as
vital as cash, and their numbers have been shrinking. The
Bureau of Labor Statistics found this year that one in five
Americans was giving time to charity; in 1974, it was one in
four. From 1981 to 1988, according to Independent Sector, a
Washington, D.C., umbrella group for nonprofit organizations,
the percentage of adults doing volunteer work dropped to 45%
from 52%. Among women, traditionally the mainstay of charity
drives, the falloff was from 56% to 47%.</p>
<p>With a cash outlay of $500,000, Lipton will stage half a
dozen fairs at shopping malls across the country, the first
in Chicago, the others in New Orleans, Kansas City,
Philadelphia, Dallas and Tampa. At these "mall events," local
agencies serving  everything from AIDS to the Little League
will be invited to make their pitches for volunteers among
the crowds Lipton expects to generate.</p>
<p>To round up the agencies, Lipton teamed with an
organization that has been recruiting volunteers for 11
years. This  is the Volunteer National Center, a Washington,
D.C.-based nonprofit group headed by former auto executive
George Romney. The Center selected the six cities for the
volunteer fairs and will handle the job of inviting the local
charities. Lipton takes it from there.</p>
<p>As a food company, malls are Lipton's home ground,
explains Anthony Montuori, vice president for marketing
support. To keep the crowds coming, shopping centers are
hungry for any event that will draw them. Four malls in
Kansas City, Mr. Montuori says, began competing for Lipton's
volunteer fair as soon as they heard of it.</p>
<p>Lipton's staff warmed up with a minifair at its New Jersey
headquarters, rounding up 30 local philanthropic agencies to
make their pitches to Lipton employees and those of neighbors
like Lever Brothers (a sister Unilever subsidiary), publisher
Prentice-Hall and other companies based along the Jersey
Palisades. Five hundred potential volunteers showed up.</p>
<p>Before the first volunteer fair opened at Chicago's North
Pier Mall, Lipton flew six regional directors of the
Volunteer National Center to New Jersey for a two-day,
all-expenses-paid seminar on public relations and media
techniques. The six, in turn, were expected to conduct their
own PR drills in each of the mall cities. To back up these
amateur drumbeaters, Lipton will fly its own promotion people
to each site to round up local media coverage, help conduct
interviews and oversee the fanfare.</p>
