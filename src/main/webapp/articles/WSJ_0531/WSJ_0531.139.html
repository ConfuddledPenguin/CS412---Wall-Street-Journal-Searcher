	<p class="article-leader">Harnischfeger Industries Inc., Milwaukee, said it plans to
buy shares in Measurex Corp., in a move it says will
"strengthen the existing relationship" between its 80%-owned
Beloit unit and Measurex.
   Harnischfeger isn't obliged under the agreement to
purchase any shares, but said it had agreed not to exceed a
20% Measurex stake through its purchases. Harnischfeger
produces construction equipment and industrial machinery.
Beloit makes equipment for the paper industry.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Measurex, a Cupertino, Calif., maker of industrial
process-control systems, has about 17.8 million common shares
outstanding.</p>
<p>In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Measurex shares climbed $2.25 to close at $21.875.</p>
<p>Additionally, Harnischfeger said, Beloit and Measurex
entered into a joint marketing, sales and development
agreement which expands an existing 1987 agreement to cover
additional products.</p>
<p>As part of the link between the companies, Harnischfeger's
chairman and chief executive officer William W. Goessel, will
join Measurex's board, increasing membership to eight.</p>
