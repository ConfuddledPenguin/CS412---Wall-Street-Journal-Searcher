	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A federal judge said the Department of Health
and Human Services is violating the law in the way it
processes many Social Security disability claims. The
decision could force the U.S. to reconsider tens of thousands
of applicants who have been turned down for disability
benefits.
   Judge Leonard Sand said he will order Social Security
officials to change their policy for processing the
applications. The suit was filed in 1984 after the Reagan
administration began taking a harsh approach to most
applications for mental and physical disability benefits.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the Reagan administration approach, called
non-acquiescence, federal officials rejected disability
applications, although courts had ruled that the procedures
they used were wrong. As a result, thousands of people were
rejected for benefits without ever being informed that in
similar cases a federal appeals court had ruled that the
process used was inappropriate.</p>
<p>Because most of the applicants are poor people without
lawyers, they usually never learn that they had grounds for
challenging the benefit rejections, said Burt Neuborne, a New
York University law school professor who helped bring the
case when he was legal director for the American Civil
Liberties Union.</p>
<p>Under the disputed policy, the applicants could be
disqualified for benefits for various reasons. In some cases,
for instance, the opinion of the Social Security
Administration's own doctors were given more weight than the
applicants' regular physicians. Judge Sand, in federal
district court in Manhattan, found that and other guidelines
to be illegal.</p>
<p>The judge said that although the department had revised
its policy in 1985, apparently in response to the litigation,
the procedure for granting claims "leaves a great deal of
room for non-acquiescence." The judge said the policy allows
the agency to continue avoiding complying with previous
holdings by the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>The agency has maintained that it hasn't engaged in any
form of non-acquiescence in disability cases at least since
1985.</p>
<p>Judge Sand said a plan has to be worked out to remedy any
harm caused by the policy. The remedy could involve reopening
disability cases that were rejected as long ago as 1981. But
Judge Sand rejected a proposal by the benefit applicants'
attorneys to reopen all the cases. Instead, he ordered the
attorneys to come up with a narrower plan. He said the plan
should cover cases that were rejected for the specific
reasons now found to have been in violation of previous court
rulings.</p>
<p>Attorneys working on the case said it is impossible to
predict how many cases might be affected and how much money
might be involved. Prof. Neuborne said a small percentage of
rejected applicants did appeal cases involving the disputed
policy and that nearly all of them won. Generally the
benefits at stake amount to about $500 a month for each
individual.</p>
<p>Nancy Morawetz, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said she
expects a remedy plan to be approved within two or three
months.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Justice Department, which represented
the Health and Human Services Department, said attorneys are
reviewing Judge Sand's opinion. He said they have no comment
at this time.</p>
<p>Prof. Neuborne said the Social Security Administration
adopted the policy of non-acquiescence because it believed
that its interpretation of the law, rather than the federal
appeals court's intrepretation, was correct. Instead of
incorporating the court rulings into its policy, the agency
required that each individual applicant go to court to
challenge the decisions. Prof. Neuborne said the policy was
one of the first "to use non-acquiescence against people who
couldn't afford lawyers."</p>
<p>Judge Sand said the applicants had no reason to believe
their requests were being rejected in ways courts previously
had found to be invalid. Under Judge Sand's decision, the
Social Security Administration's policy will have to be
changed to state that the previous court rulings are binding.</p>
