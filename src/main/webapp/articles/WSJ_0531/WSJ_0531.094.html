	<p class="article-leader">A joint venture between two U.S. companies and the Soviet
Union will try to take the guesswork out of navigation during
transoceanic flights, increasing the safety of long flights
and opening the skies to even more planes.
   Currently, commercial airline pilots face some big
headaches when they fly over the ocean. Less than an hour off
the coast, planes lose contact with land-based ground
controllers. After that, their crews must rely on on-board
navigation equipment that's "subject to drift and errors," an
airline official concedes.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Moreover, pilots are encountering increasing air traffic,
particularly over the Pacific, that one airline official said
was "approaching gridlock."</p>
<p>To help alleviate those concerns, Honeywell Inc. and NWA
Inc.'s Northwest Airlines unit announced yesterday that they
plan to put sophisticated equipment aboard a Northwest Boeing
747 freighter in a test that taps into both U.S. and Soviet
satellite navigation systems.</p>
<p>While both satellite systems now leave numerous holes in
the sky, plans call for the countries to launch as many as
two dozen satellites to plug them. Once that's done, most of
the world's long-range aircraft could be equipped with a
single "black box" capable of marrying location data from the
two satellite networks. Pilots would be able to get
second-by-second data about their whereabouts, greatly
decreasing the chances of straying off course.</p>
<p>One official involved in the experiment speculated that
such a system could have prevented the loss of Korean Air
Lines flight 007, which wandered off its trans-Pacific route
in late 1983 and was shot down by a Russian jet fighter.</p>
<p>After that disaster, which cost 269 lives, investigators
determined that the KAL pilots probably punched the wrong
navigational coordinates into their on-board computer. That
device had no way of checking that the information was
correct; once airborne, the plane was on its own.</p>
<p>Such commercial airliner on-board navigation systems rely
primarily on gyroscopes that sense the movement of the
aircraft, allowing pilots to keep track of the plane's
progress. But they "don't have the means of . . . confirming
the position the aircraft is at," according to Robert Buley,
Northwest's manager of flight standards projects who helped
negotiate the venture. As a result, planes can be off course
by a number of miles at any one time.</p>
<p>Because of the uncertainty, air traffic controllers now
must keep wide spaces between aircraft over the oceans -- 60
miles on each side and about 85 miles before and behind a
plane. Such wide separation is a particular problem in the
Pacific, where air traffic is burgeoning and many carriers
are operating flights during the same hours because of the
big time change.</p>
<p>Since satellites provide much more precise navigational
information, controllers would be able to reduce the
separation and increase the number of flights over both the
Atlantic and the Pacific without compromising safety.</p>
<p>By electronically consulting both U.S. and U.S.S.R.
satellite systems "over water, they'd tell you at all times
accuracies within 100 meters," said D. Larry Moore, president
of the space and aviation systems business at Honeywell,
which is a major producer of on-board inertial navigation
systems.</p>
<p>Both the U.S. and Soviets already have satellite
navigational systems for military use. But because commercial
airlines are held to different safety standards than military
aircraft, use of the satellite systems for commercial jets
remains in the testing stage. What's more, neither country
alone has enough satellites to test the system on a
continuous basis. By combining the two systems, there will be
enough satellites to provide navigational guidance to flights
around the world on a second-by-second basis, as well as to
cross-check information coming from each, officials said.</p>
<p>The test is expected to last until mid-1993, after which
Northwest and Honeywell will turn their results over to the
Federal Aviation Administration, and presumbly also to the
Russians. Although the FAA has been encouraging international
technical cooperation, officials yesterday estimated that it
may not be until 1995 that the industry moves away from the
current land-based navigational equipment.</p>
<p>Mr. Moore estimated that the resulting black box, which
his company hopes to make, could cost between $35,000 and
$50,000. "It's going to be the navigation system of the
mid-to-late '90s," he predicted.</p>
<p>Northwest's Mr. Buley said he broached the idea of a joint
venture with the Soviets when he attended a conference
between U.S. and Soviet aviation technology experts in
Leningrad earlier this year. Northwest is the biggest U.S.
carrier in the North Pacific, and thus has an interest in
ensuring that it can expand its number of flights on
trans-Pacific routes.</p>
