	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Uranium Resources Inc. said it plans to seek
shareholder and regulatory approval for a 1-for-4 reverse
stock split of its approximately 26 million shares
outstanding.
   The uranium mining company said it believes the reverse
split will make its stock more liquid and help it become
eligible for trading on the national market system of the
over-the-counter market. The company said officers and
directors owning about 60% of Uranium Resources' stock
already have approved the transaction.</p>
