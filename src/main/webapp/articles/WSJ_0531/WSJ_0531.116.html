	<p class="article-leader">SEOUL, South Korea -- The U.S. arranged a last-minute
meeting between South Korean President Roh Tae Woo and Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev. The meeting would be the most
significant gesture by the Soviets toward South Korea in more
than four decades.
   The meeting will take place in San Francisco Sunday, U.S.
officials confirmed, after Mr. Gorbachev finishes the
official phase of his summit meeting with President Bush in
Washington.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Seoul and Moscow don't have formal diplomatic ties and
Moscow maintains strong links with North Korea. But trade and
other business links between the South Koreans and the
Soviets have been strengthening. Topics would most likely
include South Korea asking Soviet help in diminishing the
antagonism between the South and the Communist North and
Soviet diplomatic recognition of Seoul.</p>
<p>The U.S. involvement in setting up the meeting indicates
Washington's eagerness to defuse one of the world's last
trouble spots where U.S. troops face a Soviet-supported army.
About 42,000 U.S. troops are based in South Korea, many of
them at the Demilitarized Zone that divides the Korean
peninsula, eye-to-eye with North Korean troops.</p>
<p>In Washington, a State Department spokeswoman said the
U.S. "would welcome a meeting" between the Soviet and South
Korean leaders, but she declined to answer questions about
such a meeting.</p>
<p>The San Francisco meeting would be the first between a
Soviet leader and a high-level South Korean government
official, let alone a South Korean president. In addition to
seeking diplomatic recognition from the Soviets, Seoul wants
Moscow to let it join the United Nations. North Korea, which
also isn't a U.N. member, doesn't want South Korea to join
and has asked its allies -- China and the U.S.S.R. -- to veto
any admission attempt. Moscow, on the other hand, needs South
Korean trade and investment to help its struggling economy.</p>
<p>Seoul has tried for many months to convince North Korea's
allies to recognize South Korea and to rein in North Korea,
whose excesses in past years have included bombing and
killing South Korean leaders in Rangoon and Burma, and
blowing up a Korean Air Lines commercial jet on the eve of
the 1988 Summer Olympics. Even before communism began
faltering in Eastern Europe last year, South Korea made
progress with many of those nations and was isolating North
Korea. Seoul established diplomatic ties with Poland, Hungary
and Czechoslovakia; in December, it and Moscow began limited
consular services in their trade offices in each other's
capitals.</p>
<p>But Moscow, North Korea's main supporter, has held back on
full diplomatic ties. The Soviets very much want South
Korea's trade and economic assistance. China, which has
become more hard-line following the Tiananmen massacre last
summer, also shows little eagerness to openly support South
Korea over North Korea, though its trade relations with South
Korea have been growing rapidly, too.</p>
<p>North Korea has always successfully played China off
against the Soviets and it has never been clear how much real
influence Moscow and Beijing have on North Korean leader Kim
Il Sung. North Korea has shown no sign of retreating from its
rigid Stalinist policies.</p>
<p>The Gorbachev-Roh meeting could provide a major boost for
Mr. Roh, whose popularity is slipping as South Koreans blame
him for their economy's fits and starts. The Korean stock
market reversed its plummet Wednesday when rumors about the
trip circulated. It closed at 789.89, up 6.02 points.</p>
<p>The trip will also undoubtedly feed criticism of Mr. Roh
and the U.S. by Korea's radicals, who are likely to contend
that the U.S. hand in setting up the Roh-Gorbachev meeting
proves their allegation that Mr. Roh is a puppet of the U.S.</p>
<p>Mr. Roh originally planned to be in the U.S. during the
Gorbachev visit, but canceled his trip to Mexico, Canada and
the U.S. because he didn't want to risk being criticized for
leaving Korea when the country faced economic troubles.</p>
