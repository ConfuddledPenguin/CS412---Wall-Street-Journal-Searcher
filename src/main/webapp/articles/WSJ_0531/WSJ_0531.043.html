	<p class="article-leader">Lotus Development Corp. said it acquired the AlphaWorks
integrated software package from Alpha Software Corp. and
will market the package as LotusWorks. Terms weren't
disclosed.
   The software, which provides word processing, data
management, financial analysis and communications functions
in a single package, competes with Microsoft Corp.'s popular
Microsoft Works product.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The purchase strengthens the Cambridge, Mass., company in
the entry-level segment of the market for integrated
software. Its Symphony product is aimed at high-end
customers, but that market isn't growing as fast. Symphony
sells for $695, while LotusWorks will sell for $149.</p>
<p>Alpha Software says it has shipped more than 300,000
copies of AlphaWorks since its first version was introduced
in 1983. The program has been well-received by reviewers and
software experts.</p>
<p>Lotus also said it has struck agreements with several
personal computer manufacturers, including Olivetti Office
USA, Packard Bell and Poquet Corp., which will sell the
product bundled with some PCs.</p>
