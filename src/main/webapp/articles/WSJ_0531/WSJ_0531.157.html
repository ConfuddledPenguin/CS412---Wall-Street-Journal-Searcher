	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Blackstone Group said Richard Ravitch, the
former public official and turnaround specialist who ran
unsuccessfully for mayor of New York in 1989, will join the
investment boutique as a general partner.
   Mr. Ravitch, who will start work tomorrow, said he will
focus mainly on restructuring over-leveraged companies -- "of
which there will be many in the 1990s" -- and on
recapitalizing troubled thrifts and other financial
institutions. He also said he will scout out prospects for
Blackstone's $800 million buy-out and investment fund.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Everything he does will be tied in some way to his past
experience and background," said Jerome Traum, a Blackstone
general partner.</p>
<p>Mr. Ravitch, 56 years old, is known mainly for his
chairmanship during the mid-1970s of the New York State Urban
Development Corporation, which he is credited with saving
from bankruptcy; and for heading the New York State
Metropolitan Transit Authority, which he saw through a bitter
transit strike in 1980 and spent until 1984 rebuilding with
bond issues and innovative financing.</p>
<p>His bailout plan for the UDC became the model for the
Municipal Assistance Corporation, created in 1975 to help New
York City out of its fiscal crisis.</p>
<p>Mr. Ravitch has also served as chairman of HRH
Construction, a developer of several major New York office
buildings and residential projects. In 1985 he led a group of
investors who bought, ran and resold in 1988 -- at a big
profit -- New York's Bowery Savings Bank. "That's one of the
most successful turnarounds that has ever taken place," said
Mr. Traum.</p>
<p>Since 1989, Mr. Ravitch has concentrated on writing,
teaching at New York University and seeking new opportunities
in business.</p>
