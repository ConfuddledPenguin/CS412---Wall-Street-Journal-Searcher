	<p class="article-leader">From the abyss of Burma comes the Marxist world's latest
cry for freedom. After 28 years of vicious one-party rule by
Ne Win and his military proteges, the Burmese government on
Sunday attempted to legitimize itself with a managed
election. It miscalculated. Voters delivered a landslide
victory to the opposition National League for Democracy.
   Sadly, it's a long shot that Burma's vote will translate
smoothly into democratic government. The ruling military
junta has said that the newly elected legislature must write
a new constitution before there is any serious transfer of
power. It is perfectly capable of using that requirement as
an excuse for an indefinite stall that ignores the popular
will while it renews its policy of political oppression.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Since democratic protests broke out in 1988, the junta has
employed shootings, jailings and forced resettlements to
discourage its critics. The winning opposition's most
prominent figure, Aung San Suu Kyi, is serving a one-year
sentence under house arrest. Another opposition leader, U Tin
Oo, is doing three years of hard labor for sedition. Hundreds
more remain in prison.</p>
<p>But whatever comes next, Burma's vote offers encouragement
that democracy may yet prevail over the tyrannies of Asia --
where no communist regime has fallen so far.</p>
<p>Conventional wisdom likes to blame the despotic gridlock
on Asian cultures, which are presumed to have some affinity
for dictatorships. Burma reminds us that since communism
proved itself a ferocious failure in the region, Asian
cultures have shown a keen affinity for Voice of America
broadcasts, fax machines, and anything that brings news of
how good life can be in a free society.</p>
<p>Burma's people know enough to place no trust in their
government, whose Burmese Way to Socialism has reduced their
once rich country to a poor and forgotten hellhole. Tuned in
to the VOA, the BBC and Indian radio, they have heard about
the Tiananmen uprising in China and the overthrow of
communism in Eastern Europe. According to diplomats based in
Bangkok and Rangoon, the Burmese took special note of the
fall of Romania's tyrant, Nicolae Ceausescu.</p>
<p>Indeed, Burmese dissidents like to point out, correctly,
that the democratic avalanche of the past year really began
almost two years ago in Burma. It was in the summer of 1988
that Burmese protesters took to the streets, demanding
democratic reform. They were killed by the thousands. But not
before they had achieved the formal resignation of Ne Win,
who after 26 years of misrule was at least banished to
behind-the-scenes manipulation of today's military junta. And
not before they had reminded the world that even in such
obscure places as Burma, there were people brave enough to
challenge what seemed then an immovable Marxist regime.</p>
<p>It would be a pity for Burma's glad news to be swept under
the clippings of this week's Bush-Gorbachev summit. Burma's
next move bears watching, not only because its people have
shown admirable courage and a great appetite for freedom, but
also because their persistence will not be lost on the people
of countries such as Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and especially
China. What began with Burma's 1988 days of rage may yet feed
into a democratic avalanche in Asia to match the one in
Europe.</p>
