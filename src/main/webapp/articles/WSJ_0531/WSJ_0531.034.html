	<p class="article-leader">Suzuki Motor Co. of Japan reported that consolidated
pretax profit for the year ended March 31 rose 76% to 25.48
billion yen ($168.7 million) from 14.48 billion yen a year
earlier, after the company limited growth in manufacturing
and administration costs.
   But net income fell 14% to 5.61 billion yen, or 13.75 yen
a share, from 6.54 billion yen, or 17.38 yen a share, because
of higher tax payments.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales of Suzuki vehicles and parts rose 2.3% to 982.57
billion yen from 960.49 billion yen. Costs increased only
0.4% for sales and 1.9% for administration, allowing
operating profit to surge from a year earlier. A Suzuki
official attributed the slower growth of costs to
exchange-rate factors, as well as changes in Japan's tax
system.</p>
<p>Receipts from auto sales slipped 0.7% to 617.06 billion
yen from 621.66 billion yen. Motorcycle sales inched up 0.6%
to 148.266 billion yen from 147.384 billion yen. Parts sales
rose 13% to 217.247 billion yen from 191.45 billion yen.
Vehicle volume sagged in every area but sales of motorcycles
overseas; unit sales fell 2.2% for motorcycles and 6.6% for
autos.</p>
