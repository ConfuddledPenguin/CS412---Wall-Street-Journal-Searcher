	<p class="article-leader">CHRYSLER IS LOSING its vice-chairman, Gerald Greenwald,
who has agreed to lead the UAL buyout effort by United Air's
unions. The move is a big boost for the airline's unions,
whose buy-out depends partly on a strong candidate to replace
UAL Chairman Wolf. But Greenwald's departure is a further
blow to Chrysler.

	<div class="article-body"><p>Leading economic indicators fell 0.2% in April, tempering
the optimistic outlook suggested by a 1% rise in March. Also,
new-home sales slid 1.6% in April, the fifth drop in a row.</p>
<p>New construction contracts fell 6% in April to a four-year
low, F.W. Dodge said. The decline reflects the recent
regulatory clampdown on high-risk real-estate lending.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Stock prices climbed further in heavier volume, pushing
the Dow Jones industrials up 8.07, to 2878.56, another
record. The S&P 500 index also set a record. Many investors
remained puzzled by the market's advance amid weak economic
data. Bonds and the dollar also rose.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Portfolio insurance has returned in a new guise,
"portfolio puts," which threatens to turn market drops into
huge declines. The SEC is taking a hard look at the new
version of the trading strategy, which helped exacerbate the
1987 stock-market crash.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Stock mutual funds are continuing to attract small
investors. Some $2.2 billion poured into funds in April, and
even stronger inflows are reported for May. Still, much of
the new money hasn't ended up in stocks because fund managers
remain bearish.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Canada's Belzberg family sold its entire 11.7% interest in
Armstrong World Industries at a loss estimated at as much as
$18 million. The abrupt sale ends a year-long losing battle
to bring about a takeover or otherwise influence the
company's direction.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>A growing U.S.-EC dispute over agriculture subsidies has
complicated efforts to advance the current round of world
trade-liberalization talks. The disagreement also could
torpedo the GATT negotiations completely.</p>
<p>An EC court has found widespread criminal fraud,
mismanagement and waste in the European Community's $33
billion farm-subsidy program.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>West Point-Pepperell's cash-strapped owner, William
Farley, may be approached by several outside investors who
are considering buying a majority stake, sources said.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>A Delaware banking bill was signed into law by the
governor. The measure allows banks to underwrite and sell
insurance nationwide.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The leading candidate to head Harvard's $5 billion
endowment is said to be Jack Meyer, currently treasurer of
the Rockefeller Foundation.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>A key aide to Ivan Boesky testified that he conducted
numerous illegal securities trades with John Mulheren, the
former Jaime Securities chief who is on trial in New York for
conspiracy, securities fraud and other charges.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Kemper said it will take a $126.5 million charge to pare
down its securities brokerage division. The move by the
insurance and financial services firm was viewed as a belated
recognition of the brokerage unit's problems.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Borden named Anthony D'Amato president and chief operating
officer, continuing a tradition of tapping its chemical unit
for top managment.</p>
