	<p class="article-leader">Webcott Holdings, holder of a 9.7% stake in Del Webb
Corp., said its nonbinding shareholder resolution to remove
Del Webb's anti-takeover provisions was approved by more than
78% of the holders who voted on the proposal, according to an
official tally.
   The votes in favor of the proposal represented a majority
of the company's shares outstanding.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Del Webb, a Phoenix, Ariz., real estate development
concern, had said last week that a preliminary report of
inspectors of election for its May 16 annual meeting
indicated that the resolution had passed.</p>
<p>The resolution by Los Angeles-based Webcott, controlled by
Del Webb director James L. Cotter, requested that the board
redeem shareholder rights issued under a so-called "poison
pill" plan adopted last year. In April, Del Webb agreed to
several of Mr. Cotter's demands to avert a proxy fight at the
annual meeting. A poison pill plan is aimed at making hostile
takeovers prohibitively expensive.</p>
<p>A special committee of the company's board will consider
options and make a report to the board regarding the
nonbinding resolution.</p>
