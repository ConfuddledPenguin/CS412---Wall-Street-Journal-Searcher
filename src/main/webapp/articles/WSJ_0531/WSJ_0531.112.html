	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Commerce Department said it will assume
responsibility for negotiating U.S. participation in Japan's
plans to pool international know-how in automated
manufacturing.
   The measure effectively halts Tokyo's earlier attempts to
recruit individual U.S. companies and trade associations for
its Intelligent Manufacturing System, or IMS, program, and it
gives the department the right to coordinate any U.S. role.
"Our aim is that everyone's interest be served in a balanced
manner," Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said in a
department statement.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The statement said the action is based on an agreement
reached earlier this month in Brussels by the U.S., the
European Community and Japan. At that meeting, the U.S. and
the EC agreed to submit proposals for taking part in the IMS
program, while Japan agreed to refer all private U.S.
inquiries to the Commerce Department.</p>
<p>A Commerce Department spokesman said yesterday that before
any U.S. company can participate in the IMS program, there
must be an agreement detailing the methods of cooperation,
the ownership of patent rights, the nature of the funding,
and the specific areas of research. The original Japanese
plan was to create an international consortium to design the
automated factories of the future, using the most advanced
computer and artificial-intelligence techniques. Some U.S.
and European officials had charged that the scheme was a
Japanese "Trojan Horse" intended to obtain Western technology
without a reciprocal pooling of knowledge.</p>
<p>A Japanese Embassy spokesman here declined to say how
Japan will implement the agreement.</p>
