	<p class="article-leader">S.G. Warburg Group PLC, a British merchant banking and
stockbroking concern, said pretax profit for the year ended
March 31 rose 68% to #188 million ($318.4 million) from #112
million a year earlier, but warned it is unlikely to match
this performance in fiscal 1991.
   The pretax profit was below some market forecasts. Fiscal
first-half pretax profit more than doubled to #102.6 million,
largely from corporate finance activity; its pace slowed in
the second half.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Profit after taxes and minority interests jumped 67% to
#112 million from #66.9 million, and fully diluted per-share
earnings rose 64% to 49.9 pence from 30.4 pence. Net profit
attributable to shareholders, after preference-share dividend
payments, increased 73% to #108 million from #62.5 million.
Warburg said it will recommend a final dividend of 10.5 pence
a share, raising the total payout for the year to 15 pence
from 12.5 pence.</p>
<p>In its cautious fiscal 1991 forecast, Warburg cited tight
monetary policies and high real interest rates as reducing
corporate takeover activity, and low securities trading
volume.</p>
