	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Merrill Lynch & Co. has agreed to buy the main
businesses of Elders Futures Inc., a futures and options arm
of Australian brewer Elders IXL that has been on the block
for several months, people close to the transaction said.
   The move is part of a series of asset sales by merchant
bank Elders Finance Group Ltd., an Elders IXL unit that owns
Elders Futures.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Merrill is making the acquisition to beef up its Merrill
Lynch Futures metals and energy futures operations. Merrill
will pay less than $20 million for Elders Futures, people
close to the transaction said.</p>
<p>A Merrill spokesman declined to comment. However, an
announcement of a definitive agreement to acquire the main
businesses of Elders Futures is expected as soon as today.</p>
<p>The one part of Elders Futures that Merrill won't buy is
the financial-futures operations. Securities-industry
executives said those operations would be sold to
Chicago-based Cargill Investor Services Inc., a subsidiary of
Cargill Inc., Minneapolis. A Cargill spokesman confirmed the
purchase yesterday, but declined to disclose the terms.</p>
<p>Gene D. Donney, president of Elders Futures, didn't return
phone calls.</p>
<p>The Elders IXL parent company operates agribusiness,
trading, brewing and finance companies in nearly 30
countries, and is perhaps known best for its Fosters Lager.
Elders Futures provides brokerage, research and other
services in New York, Chicago, London and Geneva, with a
staff of about 175.</p>
