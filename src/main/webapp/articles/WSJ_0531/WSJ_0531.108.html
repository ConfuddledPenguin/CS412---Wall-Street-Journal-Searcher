	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- French consumer prices rose 0.4% in April from
March and were up 3.2% from a year earlier, according to
definitive results announced yesterday by the National
Statistics Institute.
   The definitive results confirm previously released
preliminary data. They follow a monthly rise of 0.3% for
March, when the year-on-year growth rate was 3.4%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Unlike the preliminary data, the definitive result
included a breakdown of price growth by product category.
This showed that service prices led the monthly gain with a
rise of 0.8% from March. This advance had been widely
anticipated because the index for the first month of every
calendar quarter includes housing and rent increases that
generally add about 0.1% to the monthly growth rate for the
overall index.</p>
