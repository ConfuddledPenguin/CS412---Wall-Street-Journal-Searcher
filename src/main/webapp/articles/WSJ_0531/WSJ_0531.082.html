	<p class="article-leader">SEATTLE -- The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office will
conduct "interference proceedings" to determine which of two
sparring biotechnology companies have rightful claim to a
patent to GM-CSF, a promising protein hormone that increases
infection-fighting white blood cells.
   Immunex Corp., based here, interpreted the government's
decision to hold an administrative hearing as a sign that the
company is still "a serious contender" in the patent race.
Genetics Institute Inc., the Cambridge, Mass.-based company
that filed its patent application for GM-CSF in July 1984,
maintains that Immunex forfeited its claim by filing its
application three months later.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A spokeswoman for Genetics Institute said, "We filed our
application first, we published our results first, and we
feel we are in the stronger position." She characterized the
hearings as "standard procedure" when two parties file
applications less than six months apart. (Genetics Institute
has assigned its patent application to Sandoz Pharmaceuticals
Corp., an East Hanover, N.J. drug company.)</p>
<p>U.S. law, however, states that the party who first invents
the product, not the one who first files an application,
should receive the patent. Scott Hallquist, Immunex's general
counsel, said that his company has lab records and witnesses
who will show that the firm invented the hormone "early
enough for us to win." The government is expected to make a
decision within two years.</p>
<p>GM-CSF is a protein that appears to shorten recovery time
for bone-marrow transplant patients and reduce bone-marrow
failures among some AIDS patients. The patent war over the
drug has high financial stakes. Analysts have estimated the
potential U.S. market for GM-CSF could run about $300 million
to $600 million a year. And if Immunex received the patent,
it could likely turn a profit for the first time by 1991,
according to its chief financial officer, Alen Frazier.</p>
<p>Immunex is also currently ensnared in interference
proceedings over interleukin2, an immune-systems booster.
Immunex is claiming patent rights along with Japan's
Dainippon and Switzerland's F. Hoffmann-La Roche & Co.</p>
