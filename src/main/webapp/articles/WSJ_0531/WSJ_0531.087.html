	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The government's premier gauge of expected
economic strength declined slightly in April, indicating
continuing weakness.
   The Commerce Department's index of leading economic
indicators dropped 0.2% in April, diluting the optimistic
outlook suggested by the 1.0% increase in March. It was the
index's second decline in four months. The leading
indicators, intended to foreshadow economic activity several
months in advance, tumbled 1.0% in February after holding
steady in January.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Although the figures do suggest a weakness in the economy,
economic analysts said, they don't foreshadow a recession.</p>
<p>"This trendless indicator suggests that the economy is
going to grow slowly," said David Berson, chief financial
economist at the Federal National Mortgage Association.</p>
<p>Bob Dieli, a financial economist at Northern Trust Co. in
Chicago, also forecast slow growth, saying the indicators'
seesaw behavior reflects "a mixed economy that is still
managing to move forward."</p>
<p>In another sign of sluggishness in the economy, the
Commerce Department also reported that new home sales dropped
1.6% in April, the fifth straight month of decline.</p>
<p>Seven of the 11 statistics making up the index of leading
indicators contributed to the April decline: average
workweek, unemployment claims, factory orders, capital
spending, building permits, unfilled orders and stock prices.
Positive contributions were made by vendor deliveries, raw
materials prices, money supply, and consumer expectations.</p>
<p>Many economists said the April drop doesn't mean the
economy is deteriorating.</p>
<p>"Nothing has changed," said Fred Sturn, senior financial
economist with Fuji Securities Inc. The numbers "have been
bobbing up and down for the last year . . . we're looking at
low growth."</p>
<p>April's 1.4% decline in new home sales, following a 8.4%
drop in March, brought this key sector of the housing
industry to its lowest level since December 1982, when the
country had just emerged from a recession. Sales of new
single-family homes fell to an annual rate of 546,000 in
April, the department said, from a 555,000 annual rate in
March.</p>
<p>Economists said increased mortgage rates were a major
contributor to the April drop, but predicted a slow decline
in the rates for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>In fact, mortgage rates have already begun to come down a
bit in May, and Mr. Berson of Fannie Mae said he expects home
sales to pick up during the next two months.</p>
<p>Sharing Mr. Berson's view, Mr. Sturn said, "A bottom may
be forming in the home sales market."</p>
<p>Mr. Sturn said that although lower mortgage rates should
help the market to level off, "the issue of whether banks
will be willing to make loans" is still an important factor
in the level of housing sales. "Interest rates are secondary
to credit policy," said Mr. Sturn.</p>
<p>The numbers in both reports were adjusted for normal
seasonal fluctuations.</p>
<p>                 Leading Indicators</p>
<p>Here are the net contributions of the components of the
Commerce Department's index of leading indicators. After
various adjustments, they produced a 0.2% decline in the
index for April and a 1.0% increase for March.</p>
