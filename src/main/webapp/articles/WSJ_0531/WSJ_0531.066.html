	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Japan's exports of cars, trucks and buses fell
18% to 430,216 units in April from a year earlier, the Japan
Automobile Manufacturers' Association said.
   The year-to-year decline was the sharpest since December
1986, when vehicle exports fell 17.8% year-to-year, according
to the association.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A sharp drop in exports to the U.S., the largest importer
of Japanese vehicles, and a decline in exports by Toyota
Motor Corp., the nation's top car exporter, contributed to
the fall in the overall exports, an official at the
association said.</p>
<p>The slowdown of exports to the U.S. should be seen as a
trend due to declining demand and continuing expansion of
production in the U.S. by Japanese car makers, the official
said.</p>
