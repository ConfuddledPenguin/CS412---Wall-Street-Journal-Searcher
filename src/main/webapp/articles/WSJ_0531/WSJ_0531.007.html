	<p class="article-leader">In an April 13 article, you invited the reaction of
Carnegie Mellon University's president, Richard Cyert, to
Yale's "de-emphasizing the organizational approach" to
studying management problems. He responded in kind. Both the
question and the response appear to be outdated. We recently
have changed our program to improve the education we offer to
managers who wish to make a positive contribution to our
society in the private, public or nonprofit sectors. We have
diversified our Organizational Behavior offerings, emphasized
professional, rather than Ph.D., education in this field, and
changed the content of the required first-year course. We
have not "de-emphasized" the school's commitment to
understanding how organizations work and how people work
within them, nor have we "driven . . . out" those who are not
"discipline-oriented."
   We offer an innovative and interdisciplinary professional
education to those who wish to be leaders in management. We
continue to offer courses and to recruit faculty whose
paradigms are drawn from the behavioral sciences. Our recent
curriculum changes are meant to make sure that our education
continues to offer an innovative response to the educational
needs of managers for the 21st century. They should not be
misunderstood as being hostile to organizational studies.</p>
