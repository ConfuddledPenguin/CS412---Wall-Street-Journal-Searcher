	<p class="article-leader">Phoenix Technologies Ltd. said 14 personal computer makers
will license its EISA-standard system software, suggesting
new strength for the EISA computer communications standard
over International Business Machines Corp.'s MCA design.
   EISA, which stands for extended industry-standard
architecture, was developed last year by a group of PC makers
led by Compaq Computer Corp. to counter IBM's effort to push
a new standard that wasn't compatible with existing PCs. IBM
says its MCA -- or micro-channel architecture -- design
allows faster data exchange within and among its computers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a statement, Ron Fisher, president and chief executive
officer of the Norwood, Mass., company, said, "We continue to
see a groundswell of development activity on the EISA"
design. Phoenix, which sells system software that allows PC
makers to build IBM-compatible computers, said its EISA
products are made for PCs using Intel Corp. 80386 and 80486
chips.</p>
<p>Companies licensing the EISA compatibility products from
Phoenix include Intel, NEC Corp., Tandy Corp. and Altos
Computer Systems.</p>
