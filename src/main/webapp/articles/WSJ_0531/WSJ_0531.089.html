	<p class="article-leader">State courts, the workhorses of the nation's court system,
added an astonishing total of 98 million new cases to their
dockets in 1988, the most recent year for which data are
available.
   While 68 million involved traffic and ordinance
violations, more than 30 million were new civil, criminal and
juvenile cases, according to a study by the National Center
for State Courts in Williamsburg, Va.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In contrast, about 962,000 cases were brought into federal
courts last year, nearly 5% more than in 1988.</p>
<p>State court civil filings in 1988 increased 4.3% from
1987, and new criminal cases rose more than 5%. The overall
increase in new filings is consistent with the steady growth
in state court caseloads since the center began the annual
study in 1984, says David Rottman, project director.</p>
<p>Completion of cases filed in state courts in previous
years has not kept pace with new filings, the study shows.
The center estimates that the number of cases added to state
court dockets in 1988 exceeds the number of files closed by
about 5%.</p>
<p>In the state trial courts that hear the most serious
felony and misdemeanor cases, filings of criminal cases rose
an unprecedented 8.4%, a rate which, if it continues, could
double the number of these cases every decade. Court experts
say the upsurge in state-level criminal cases is largely an
indication of a rise in drug-related prosecutions, which are
also clogging the federal courts.</p>
<p>Defense lawyers, who have long complained about a
so-called litigation explosion, view the data as confirmation
that litigation is out of hand. Defense attorney James Morris
of the Richmond, Va., law firm Morris & Morris says one
reason for court congestion is judges' willingness to admit
unreliable expert testimony. Many cases, he said, wouldn't
"even be filed if it weren't for the fact that some paid
expert loosely applying science is able to give an opinion"
that the plaintiff should recover.</p>
<p>But the president of the mostly plaintiff-oriented
American Trial Lawyers Association played down the caseload
increase, saying it has generally kept pace with population
growth and has also reflected the rise in business failures.
The group's president, Russ Herman, said: "Even if all types
of litigation were increasing, in a democracy that's good.
The civil courts are the pressure valve for society."</p>
<p>George Milko of HALT, a Washington organization that seeks
to promote the interests of consumers of legal services,
notes that the persistent rise in case filings provides
evidence that efforts to promote forms of dispute resolution
outside the court are not succeeding. "Maybe we ask our
courts to do more than they can handle," he says.</p>

<p>RETIREE BENEFIT termination is halted by court restraining
order.</p>
<p>A federal judge in Connecticut ordered the energy
conglomerate Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine of Paris to
refrain temporarily from terminating a health benefits plan
for former senior executives of Texasgulf Inc., a U.S. oil
company acquired by the French company in 1981.</p>
<p>Richard D. Mollison, who was chairman and chief executive
officer of Raleigh, N.C., company at the time of the
acquisition, sued Elf Aquitaine and its current chief
executive officer, Michel Schneider-Maunoury, after he
received a letter from Mr. Schneider-Maunoury that said the
plan would be abolished May 31, 1990.</p>
<p>Marilyn Ford, a professor of law at the University of
Bridgeport in Connecticut, who represented Mr. Mollison,
asked the judge for a restraining order, arguing that the
takeover agreement guarantees continuation of the benefit
plan.</p>
<p>The suit is part of a recent trend of cases against
companies that attempt to cut retirees' benefits in response
to rising health care costs. The case appears to be one of
the first in which a judge has put a restraining order on a
company before any termination of benefits.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Elf Aquitaine said that the company
decided "to provide the same medical coverage for senior
officers as everybody else." He said although the takeover
agreement stipulates that employee benefit levels would not
be changed, the rising cost of health care has created a
definitional dispute over whether "level of benefits" implies
costs borne by the company or health services actually
received by retirees.</p>
<p>Elf Aquitaine has retained the New York law firm Sullivan
& Cromwell to represent it in the lawsuit. The judge
scheduled a hearing for June 1, when he will consider
granting a preliminary injunction, a stronger measure than
the restraining order he issued last week.</p>
<p>Ms. Ford said that other former Texasgulf executives have
expressed interest in joining Mr. Mollison as plaintiffs in
the lawsuit and that there is potential for a class action
against the company.</p>

<p>NEW YORK ELECTION law is challenged as unconstitutional in
federal suit.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed by a group of labor unions, targets the
state's requirement that voters must register at least 60
days in advance to be able to vote in a primary election.
Deborah H. Karpatkin, an attorney for the unions and for 100%
Vote/Human Serve Campaign, a national group seeking to make
registration easier, said New York's 60-day cutoff "is one of
the longest, if not the longest," in the U.S.</p>
<p>The suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, claims the
requirement is unreasonable and detrimental to voter turnout.
"It places a harsh and unnecessary barrier in the way of
citizens' ability to participate in the political process. .
. . Many primary contests don't reach a high level of public
attention until the last few weeks before the election, when
it is too late to register for that primary," the suit said.
For the general election, the registration cutoff is 30 days
before the vote.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the New York State Board of Elections said
the board and the state attorney general's office are
reviewing the suit. He said 60-day requirement is meant
mainly to deter "party raiding," in which a member of one
party tries to influence the opposing party's primary
results.</p>
<p>For instance, a voter might register in the other party's
primary in an effort to get the other party's weaker
candidate into the general election, the spokesman said.</p>

<p>CHINESE PROVINCE appoints U.S. lawyer as legal
representative.</p>
<p>John T. Kesler, president of the 18-lawyer Salt Lake City
law firm of Woodbury, Jensen, Kesler & Swinton, said he will
represent Szechwan province in business dealings and in legal
disputes between U.S. and Szechwan organizations. Szechwan
province has more than 105 million residents and is in
Western China. Many defense and aerospace companies are based
there.</p>
<p>Woodbury Jensen specializes in international commercial
work, as well as real estate, technology and corporate law. A
visiting Chinese lawyer is an associate with the firm. The
firm has also established ties with four Chinese law firms in
different parts of China.</p>
<p>Mr. Kesler received the appointment after lecturing in the
province's capital on international commercial law.</p>

<p>SALARY FREEZE: Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue, one of the
nation's largest law firms, said it will keep starting
salaries this year at 1989 levels, ending years of annual
increases. In all its cities except New York, the
1,160-attorney firm will pay new lawyers, who arrive during
the summer and fall, a salary package worth $74,000. In New
York, the figure is $83,000. Michael H. Carpenter, the Jones
Day partner in charge of recruiting, said the Cleveland law
firm decided that "this was an appropriate year to hold the
line in terms of the concerns of our clients and in terms of
outside legal costs and in controlling those outside legal
costs." Jones Day's move could tempt other firms, many of
them hit hard by the current slowdown in corporate deal work,
to hold the line on salaries as well.</p>

<p>ROSENMAN & COLIN, New York, will merge its six-attorney
Washington office with Casson & Harkins of Washington, whose
24 attorneys specialize in health care. "Rosenman had wanted
to increase its presence in Washington for some time," said
Casson & Harkins's Joseph Casson, who said his own firm would
benefit from Rosenman's expertise in taxes and securities.</p>
