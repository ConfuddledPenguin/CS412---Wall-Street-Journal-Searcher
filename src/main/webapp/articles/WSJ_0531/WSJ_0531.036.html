	<p class="article-leader">Chrysler Corp. will reduce the cash it offers consumers on
at least three of its car lines, when it renews its buyer
incentive program this week.
   A spokesman confirmed that the Highland Park, Mich., auto
maker will reduce to $750 from $1,000 the rebate to buyers of
its Dodge Shadow and Plymouth Sundance compact cars; its
Chrysler LeBaron line; and its Dodge Spirit and Plymouth
Acclaim midsized cars.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Chrysler officials attributed the reduced incentives to
stronger sales and lower stocks of the cars. Sales of the
Spirit and Acclaim vehicles this year through May 20 rose 34%
from a year earlier, Chrysler said. Inventories of the cars
represent about a 50-day supply, relatively low for the
industry. Chrysler said its aggressive sales campaign, which
compares the cars directly to those built by Japan-based auto
makers, has helped boost sales.</p>
<p>Chrysler isn't the only auto maker to cut incentives
recently. Ford Motor Co. this month reduced its cash
incentives on some of its more popular models.</p>
