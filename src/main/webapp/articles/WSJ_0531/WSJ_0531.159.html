	<p class="article-leader">Xerox Corp., a major blue-chip client of Backer Spielvogel
Bates, is talking to other agencies about its advertising,
industry executives said.
   The executives said Xerox has asked the agencies on its
roster to compete for a domestic advertising project. Backer,
a unit of Saatchi & Saatchi, typically handles most of
Xerox's domestic account, which billed close to $20 million
last year. The other agencies on the big electronics
company's roster include Ogilvy & Mather, Young & Rubicam and
Lowe Marschalk.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Rumors have been swirling for months that Xerox was about
to put its account at Backer up for review. The loss would be
a painful one, especially since Backer lost the $60 million
Prudential Insurance account earlier this year.</p>
<p>But one of the executives involved in the pitch for the ad
project stressed that the full account isn't up for review.
"I'm sure that they aren't even thinking review," he said.
"They have a little problem; if (an agency) is on a roster of
a client, it helps out on things that aren't its account.
This happens quite often. It's a way a client can get help
without putting their account up for review."</p>
<p>Xerox executives couldn't be reached, and executives at
the agencies involved declined comment. However, all three
agencies aside from Backer have been hoping to pry away the
domestic business from Backer, whose predecessor agency Ted
Bates snared the account in 1986. "We've been chasing the
business for years," conceded an executive at one of the
competing agencies, who asked not to be identified. Clearly,
the competing agencies are hoping the project work will turn
into a bigger chunk of the domestic business.</p>
<p>All three agencies have powerful reasons for coveting more
Xerox work. Ogilvy, a unit of WPP Group, has been working
desperately to turn around its troubled New York office.
Earlier this month, it picked up the $45 million Eastern
Airlines account, its first major win in more than two years.
Another prestigious win would help wipe out the poor morale
and problems stemming from account losses and management
turnover that have plagued the agency's New York office for
several years. Ogilvy currently handles some direct response
work for Xerox.</p>
<p>Lowe Marschalk, which also handles some Xerox direct
response work, has been trying to build its roster of
blue-chip clients. It recently won the Prudential account
away from Backer. Young & Rubicam, meanwhile, is among the
most competitive of all agencies. After some setbacks last
year, including lawsuits -- later settled -- involving its
backing of a start-up agency and its work on the Jamaica
account, it also is looking for a big win.</p>
<p>The agencies have been unsuccessful so far, though, in
wooing the Xerox account away from Backer, despite persistent
rumors to the contrary. Backer's hallmark is its service, and
its hands-on attention from its chairman, Carl Spielvogel.
Mr. Spielvogel was traveling and couldn't be reached for
comment.</p>
