	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- U.S. government officials from four executive
agencies and one congressional committee arrived here this
week bearing a letter from President Bush to Prime Minister
Toshiki Kaifu.
   Their mission: to coax roughly $1 billion from Japan for
the superconducting supercollider to be built in Texas.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Their pitch is becoming more common. Big basic-science
projects are getting more expensive. The U.S. government is
financially pinched. And there is growing sentiment that
Japan should share more of its wealth -- particularly because
it has benefited greatly from relatively free access to
Western basic research.</p>
<p>In February U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney pressed
Japan to share more of its military technology, noting that
"Japan and other allies have long benefited from technology
flow from the United States." Japan is also likely to get
requests as Americans raise funds for other megaprojects such
as an advanced fusion reactor and a manned journey to Mars.</p>
<p>But such pleas, at least in the short term, will likely go
unfulfilled, further fraying bilateral relations. Japanese
officials say they agree in general with foreign demands, but
Japanese science policy-making works against major spending
on basic research.</p>
<p>That stance already is creating problems. Last year,
prominent American biologists, led by Nobel laureate James D.
Watson, lambasted Japan on Capitol Hill for foot-dragging in
supporting a multibillion-dollar effort to map the human
genetic system. "The days when the United States can
effectively subsidize Japanese science are over," Mr. Watson
wrote to a Japanese colleague.</p>
<p>The supercollider, scheduled for completion by 1998, is
supposed to push particle physics to unprecedented energy
levels, giving new insights into the basic laws of matter.
The U.S. government is planning to underwrite $5 billion of
the $8 billion price tag, with the state of Texas chipping in
another billion dollars. American officials are now tapping
other sources to meet the total. Japan is their first stop.</p>
<p>U.S. Deputy Energy Secretary W. Henson Moore, the leader
of this week's delegation, said at a press luncheon here
yesterday that the government is approaching Japan because of
its advanced work in physics. He refused to say publicly how
much support he seeks from the Japanese, but several members
of the delegation put the figure at $1 billion. Mr. Moore
stressed that Japan is being approached as a potential
partner -- participating in designing and constructing the
project -- not just as a financier. He said he will also
discuss the issue with other countries, starting with South
Korea next week.</p>
<p>Other officials say the U.S. expects Japan in particular
to play a greater role. In bilateral discussions in
Washington at the beginning of May, "there was a general
agreement that greater cooperation was needed in basic
science in general and in the megaprojects in particular," J.
Thomas Ratchford, associate director of the White House
Office of Science and Technology Policy, said publicly.</p>
<p>By its own admission, Japan is a relative laggard in
fundamental scientific research. Research-and-development
spending by the government, the main source of basic research
funds, is less than 0.5% of Japan's gross national product,
compared with more than 1% in the U.S., West Germany, and
France.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry issued a report calling for Japan to increase
government funding to 1% of GNP by the year 2000. "Until now,
we haven't placed emphasis on basic, or creative R&D work,"
said Yukio Honda, director of the technology policy planning
division at MITI's Agency of Industrial Science and
Technology.</p>
<p>Japan is already contributing somewhat more to
international projects. It is helping build, along with
Europe, a part of the U.S.-sponsored space station. "The
trend is toward convergence" in basic research spending by
Japan and the U.S., Mr. Ratchford noted. But it will be a
difficult battle before Japan reaches parity. The Ministry of
Finance opposes any increase in the national budget. And
Japan's policymaking, particularly in science, is divided
among several bureaucracies that rarely agree.</p>
<p>"Everybody feels we have to contribute something on these
international matters," says Genya Chiba, vice president of
the government-sponsored Research & Development Corp. of
Japan and a major proponent of more basic research. "But I
don't know how. Which ministry, which department is
responsible for that? A consensus hasn't been formed."</p>
