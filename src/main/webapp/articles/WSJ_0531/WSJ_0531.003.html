	<p class="article-leader">Your April 23 article "Smokers Go Out of Their Way to Beat
Restrictions on Lighting Up in Flight" distorted the reality
of the overwhelmingly successful implementation of the
smoking ban on virtually all domestic airline flights. You
focused on a few addicted smokers and one "smokers' rights"
activist funded by the tobacco industry, but failed to
mention that 455 million people fly each year in the U.S.,
the vast majority of whom are thrilled with the new law.
   The measure has been a huge success since it went into
effect on Feb. 25, surpassing even its proponents' greatest
expectations. The almost complete lack of news about the
public's adjustment to the new law is a sign of its warm
welcome. Thus, by focusing on three or four of the millions
of smokers and nonsmokers who have enjoyed your article, you
drew an inaccurate picture of what has occurred.</p>

<p>So the government has banned smoking on domestic flights,
and passengers are sneaking smokes in the bathroom. Is anyone
surprised? Sooner or later, there will be a bathroom fire, a
plane crash and many deaths.</p>
<p>Will the government then admit its mistake and restore the
smoking section as the lesser risk? Of course not. The
government will ban bathrooms.</p>

<p>The current intolerant attitude of many Americans toward
smokers shows with chilling clarity how easily a good
propaganda campaign can create socially acceptable hatred of
a minority. As the harassment, bullying and mistreatment
escalate, it should surprise no one that more and more
smokers are reacting angrily and impolitely.</p>
<p>The federal law banning smoking on flights of less than
six hours is an excellent example of unnecessary government
action that causes more problems than it solves. Decisions
regarding smoking should have been left to the individual
airlines. The marketplace would have decided the issue
peacefully and efficiently. Why was it not allowed to do so?</p>

<p>I am sorry that smokers are trapped between their
addictions and the regulations, but like many nonsmokers, the
regulations mean that finally I am able to enjoy traveling.
No longer do I get nauseated just at the thought of boarding
an airplane. No longer do I arrive at my destination feeling
slimed by smokers sitting 20 rows behind me. No longer does
my wife make me shower and change my clothes the moment I
walk in the door from a trip.</p>
