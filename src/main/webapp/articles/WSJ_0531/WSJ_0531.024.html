	<p class="article-leader">Shortly into "Back to the Future Part III," zany Doc Brown
(Christopher Lloyd) realizes he and Marty McFly (Michael J.
Fox) are about to embark on more time travel, and the Doc
says: "I can't believe this is happening."
   That sentence may be the only one uttered in the entire
film that contains an ounce of true feeling. Certainly that
was the thought on my mind as I watched this depressing
rehash of material that seemed original just five years ago,
when it was. And "I can't believe this is happening" seemed
to be what most of the actors were thinking as they gamely
trudged through their paces yet again.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Director Robert Zemeckis ("Who Framed Roger Rabbit"; "Back
to the Future" and its sequels) has a gift for seeing the
world as it appears in Loony Toons. The usual laws of gravity
don't apply to his imagination.</p>
<p>What's reined him in has been his ability to succeed with
mediocrity. "Back to the Future Part II," the main purpose of
which seemed to have been to sell advertising space, took in
more than $300 million at the box office. In its first
weekend, "Back III" grossed $23.7 million.</p>
<p>This time around Mr. Zemeckis and his
producer-screenwriter, Bob Gale, have sent their show to the
Wild West, in the year 1885. That's where Doc Brown landed at
the end of the last movie, and where Marty goes to rescue
him. The setting has allowed Mr. Zemeckis to stage some
elaborate Western scenes. Like a television commercial shot
in Monument Valley, the terrain looks right but you know it
isn't "Stagecoach." Something is being sold, but it isn't
story or character or emotion.</p>
<p>In much of the dialogue, the characters pass the time
reminding one another what year it is. As part of the Western
homage, Marty McFly calls himself Clint Eastwood and wears a
poncho. Mary Steenburgen was brought in to fall in love with
Doc Brown and to talk about H.G. Wells. This only adds to the
misery, because it brings to mind an earlier Steenburgen
film, "Time After Time," made a decade ago, when she -- and
time travel -- were still fun to watch.</p>

<p>The ticket seller at a Manhattan theater showing Pedro
Almodovar's "Tie Me Up] Tie Me Down]" informed patrons before
they paid that the movie is in Spanish with English
subtitles. "Of course it doesn't need subtitles," he added.
"Heh. Heh. Heh."</p>
<p>The ticket man must have suspected that not everyone going
to see this comedy about sadomasochistic sex/love has a deep
interest in Mr. Almodovar's flamboyantly idiosyncratic vision
of the New Spain. He'd figured out that at least some people
were attracted by the picture's contested X rating, and were
titillated by the chance to see a dirty picture made
respectable by its director's reputation. Mr. Almodovar's
cinematic virtuosity has been much acclaimed around the
world, especially since the success of his kitschy "Women on
the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown."</p>
<p>Those seeking pornographic thrills, however, will be
disappointed by the relative brevity of the movie's one
relatively explicit sex scene. But they won't be as
disappointed as the viewers looking for the wayward bawdy
humor many people managed to find within the convoluted plot
of "Women on the Verge." The only thing in "Tie Me Up]" that
may satisfy both camps is a bath toy, a motorized plastic
scuba diver with a slyly naughty desire to dabble in human
speleology.</p>
<p>Otherwise Mr. Almodovar takes a remarkably earnest
approach to this story of a psychopath named Ricky who
kidnaps a porn star named Marina and woos her by tying her up
in bed. She disdains him completely until he gets drugs for
her and is beaten up by thugs. Ricky's wounds touch Marina,
and she touches them, and Ricky, and all of this leads to the
X-rated moment of passion.</p>
<p>Mr. Almodovar has mingled this story of warped desire with
the story of an old film director who has starred Marina in
her first -- and last -- legitimate film. The "legitimate"
film is a horror picture that uses Marina much the way the
porn films do, as a prop with a firm and pliable body.</p>
<p>Victoria Abril, who plays Marina, has the right kind of
hard beauty, worn around the edges, for the vulnerable porn
princess. Antonio Banderas gives Ricky's madness a sweetness
that somewhat diminishes the crude horror of what he is doing
(brutally forcing a woman to love him). But the movie's ideas
and Mr. Almodovar's handling of them are seriously unfunny.</p>

<p>VIDEO TIP: But does the movie deserve an X rating? Miramax
Films, its distributor, argues that it doesn't, in a lawsuit
filed against the Motion Picture Association of America.
Miramax, as represented by William M. Kunstler, argues that
the film deserves an R rating, which permits people under 17
years of age to see the film only when accompanied by a
parent or guardian.</p>
<p>Miramax claims that the ratings board is being harsh on
"Tie Me Up]" because it is a foreign film, and cites several
examples of R-rated American films with equally explicit sex
scenes. These include "Body Heat," "9 1/2 Weeks," "Looking
for Mr. Goodbar," "The Postman Always Rings Twice," "Fatal
Attraction," "An Officer and a Gentleman," "Lethal Weapon
II," "No Way Out," "The Accused," "Dead Ringers" and "Blue
Velvet." Every one of these is available on videocassette.</p>
