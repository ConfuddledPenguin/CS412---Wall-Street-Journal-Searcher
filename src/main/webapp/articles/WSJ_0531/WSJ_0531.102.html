	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- A team of physicians at the University of
California Medical Center here performed delicate prenatal
surgery that saved two infants from a potentially fatal
congenital defect.
   It is the first time doctors anywhere have reported
success in fetal surgery to correct the problem -- a
diaphragmatic hernia, or hole in the muscle wall dividing the
chest from the abdomen.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Such hernias occur in about one of every 2,200 babies
born. Although children suffering from such hernias may
undergo surgery after birth, they stand only a 25% chance of
survival using this approach. This is because pressure forces
internal organs up through the hernia and into the chest
space, crowding and stunting the growth of the fetal lungs so
they cannot support life outside the womb.</p>
<p>The prenatal surgery has previously been used to correct
urinary obstructions, but doctors termed the hernia repair
about 10 times more difficult to perform.</p>
<p>Drs. Michael Harrison and Mitchell Golbus and their
colleagues at the University of California reported the first
successful patient to undergo such surgery is now nine months
old and doing well. A second infant now is six weeks old.
Their report is published in the current issue of the New
England Journal of Medicine.</p>
<p>"We're extremely proud of these kids. It was a terrible
struggle and they were heroic," Dr. Harrison said, flanked by
both families at a news conference.</p>
<p>At the news conference, Dr. Harrison added the team has
spent 12 years of intense and sometimes frustrating work
developing and testing the technique using fetal lambs and
monkeys. Prior to June 1989, the surgery was attempted on six
infants who died, four of them due to effects of the hernia
on the liver and umbilical vein.</p>
<p>About a year ago, the team worked out problems in
diagnosis, anesthesia and organ replacement. They had refined
ways to preserve the fetal blood supply during surgery, and
to prevent preterm labor afterward. Last June, what was to be
the first successful hernia repair was undertaken to save the
24-week-old fetus of Beth and Rick Schultz of Chelsea, Mich.</p>
<p>"I was scared because I had never had surgery," Mrs.
Schultz said yesterday. But chances of {the baby} surviving
long enough to have the surgery after birth weren't good."</p>
<p>After anesthetizing mother and fetus together, surgeons
made an incision in the mother's abdomen. They opened the
uterus, partially removing the fetus from the womb and making
a small cut under his ribs. The fetal stomach and other
organs were taken out of the chest, and replaced in the
abdomen where they belonged. Then the diaphragm was repaired
with a small fabric patch. The fetal abdomen, too small to
accommodate all organs in their proper place, also was
enlarged with a fabric patch. The entire procedure took 54
minutes.</p>
<p>Seven weeks after surgery, Blake Schultz was born by
Caesarian section, about six weeks premature. At nine months
old, he weighs 14 pounds. Passed from Dr. Harrison to his
parents, Blake squirmed, generally upstaged his surgeon, and
punctuated the news conference with a series of squeals.</p>
<p>A second baby, Devona Anderson, the daughter of Stephen
Anderson and Lora Scott of Tacoma, Wash., underwent the
operation March 3. At six weeks old, she slept unperturbed
through her press debut in her parents arms.</p>
<p>Drs. Harrison and Golbus said the fetal surgery, at
$18,000, costs far less than the $50,000 necessary to perform
surgery after birth due to the intensive-care-unit stay that
follows the later procedure.</p>
<p>Asked about the debate over pitting such high-tech
procedures against cheap and basic prenatal care, Dr. Golbus
countered: "This in no way denigrates prenatal care. They're
both necessary to have the healthiest possible cadre of
newborns."</p>
<p>Still, Dr. Harrison said only one in 10 babies thus
afflicted will become candidates for the rare procedure. "I
don't think it will ever be routine. The disease is rare.
{The procedure} is hard to accomplish," he said. "But it will
save a few babies' lives."</p>
<p>Moreover, he said he was concerned that "as a surgeon and
an admitted enthusiast, we might talk parents into it. They
need to talk to the skeptics, too."</p>
<p>In the future, he said, the team may attempt to use such
surgery to correct certain other congenital defects, such as
tumors that steal the fetal blood supply, or malformations of
the lung.</p>
<p>Dr. Golbus said fetal surgery may one day be combined with
techniques of gene-therapy to perform genetic repairs before
birth. "It's harder conceptually," he said, "but easier
mechanically. You're talking about thousands of babies,
instead of the few babies with surgically correctible
lesions" of the kind presented yesterday. en</p>
