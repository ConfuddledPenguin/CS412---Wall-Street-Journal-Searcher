	<p class="article-leader">Barclays Bank PLC of Britain acquired the international
private banking operations of Marine Midland Bank, the banks
said. The price wasn't disclosed.
   The operations sold by Marine Midland, a subsidiary of
Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp., a Hong Kong-based
financial services holding company, have a staff of 40
employees, and offices in New York City and Miami, involved
in private banking largely for clients in North America,
Central America and South America.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Andrew Etherington, head of the Barclays international
private banking operations, said the Marine Midland line is a
"nice fit" with Barclays, which opened a private banking unit
to service the same territory three years ago. The Barclays
unit also operates offices in New York and Miami.</p>
