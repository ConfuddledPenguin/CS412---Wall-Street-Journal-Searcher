	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Borden Inc., continuing a tradition of tapping
its chemical operations for top management, named Anthony S.
D'Amato president and chief operating officer, effective July
1.
   The appointment of Mr. D'Amato, 59 years old, comes at a
time when Borden, largely a food business, is going through a
restructuring designed to streamline its food and
consumer-products operations by consolidating production
plants and cutting back its dairy business. The two posts
have been vacant since early 1987, when R.J. Ventres became
Borden's chairman. Mr. Ventres, 65, remains chairman and
chief executive officer. It is clear, however, that the
choice of Mr. D'Amato puts him firmly in line to take over
from Mr. Ventres at his expected retirement at the end of
1991.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. D'Amato's background as a corporate executive vice
president and president of the packaging and industrial
products division, which accounted for 23% of the company's
$7.59 billion sales in 1989, gave food industry analysts
little expectation that the company eventually would shed its
films and adhesives business to concentrate solely on its
food lines. A number of large food companies have been
disposing of non-food operations in recent years.</p>
<p>Mr. D'Amato said he planned to continue the strategies
that were put in place within the past year, including
efforts to reduce costs through restructuring and investing
significant capital in building more-efficient plants.
Borden, the nation's leading milk producer, took a charge of
$404.4 million in the third quarter for its restructuring
program.</p>
<p>Mr. D'Amato characterized himself as "a mixed bag" between
the food and chemicals segments, although he comes from the
division that used to be called chemicals. He noted his
division responsibilities included the company's Brazilian
pasta products and other consumer-products businesses. He
also pointed to the strength in the three other executive
vice presidents who run the food businesses. Mr. D'Amato said
he planned to become "much more aggressive in growth and
acquisitions overseas," continuing to look for acquisitions
and selling some businesses.</p>
<p>Mr. D'Amato, instrumental in Borden's divestiture of its
commodity chemicals operations, also was elected a director.
He has been with Borden 31 years and will be succeeded as
corporate executive vice president and president of packaging
and industrial products by Joseph M. Saggese. Mr. Saggese, 58
years old, had been senior group vice president of the
division. He also was named to the office of the chairman,
joining Mr. Ventres, Mr. D'Amato and the three other
executive vice presidents.</p>
<p>John M. McMillin, a food analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities, was impressed by Mr. D'Amato's ability to explain
the dynamics of the wall-coverings business and said he
appeared "street smart" and "production driven."</p>
<p>Mr. McMillin said that although "Wall Street may be
disappointed with the appointment of a chemical man," Mr.
D'Amato would "slowly gain acceptance." He noted that many of
the analysts who follow Borden are food analysts and know
little about chemicals.</p>
<p>William Leach, a food industry analyst with Donaldson
Lufkin & Jenrette, said, "I've never understood the synergy
between wallpaper and pasta," a reference to Borden's
standing as the biggest company in the world in sales in both
areas. Mr. Leach said most analysts feel Borden would be
worth more if the two aspects of the company were separated.</p>
