	<p class="article-leader">As George Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev meet today to toast
the end of the Cold War, we hope someone responsible is
keeping an eye on another summit, where all the talk has been
of hot war. Hosting other Arab chiefs in Baghdad, Iraq's
Saddam Hussein has been ranting about "weapons of mass
destruction" and threatening to "burn up half of Israel."
   To be sure, the Iraqi dictator has always prefaced his
remarks with "if Israel attacks us." It may be that his
bluster is intended to preclude a new attack on the nuclear
reactor now being rebuilt after a 1981 Israeli attack. Israel
is widely assumed to have its own nuclear deterrent, which
even Mr. Hussein is not apt to take lightly. His Arab
neighbors might have more to fear; Syria's Assad even refused
to attend the summit. Mr. Hussein also has scores to settle
with Iran.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Still, feigning fear of an attack has been the aggressor's
tactic since time immemorial, and Saddam Hussein is not a man
to be easily dismissed. He started the last big war by
invading Iran, after all, and a million lives were lost. He
used the war as an excuse to turn his nation into an armed
camp. Iraq, for example, has a larger air force than Britain.
He has pursued every armament opportunity, like bankrolling
the "supergun" that was apparently foiled by Western
intelligence.</p>
<p>Most of all, Saddam Hussein does have a capability that
plausibly might wipe out half of Israel in a matter of hours:
Soviet Scud B missiles armed with chemical warheads. What's
more, he demonstrated his willingness to use chemical warfare
against both Iran and his own rebellious Kurds.</p>
<p>Mr. Hussein's bluster, moreover, has been playing to
applause in much of the Arab world. The pretext for the Arab
summit and other "concern" in the West is the recent flood of
Soviet Jews to Israel. This of course will revitalize Israel.
Demographic trends are being reversed; no longer is it likely
that Arabs will constitute a majority of the nation at some
time in the future. The new immigrants will boost the Israeli
economy, and break the country's political deadlock, probably
in favor of the conservative Likud Party.</p>
<p>If Saddam Hussein has emerged as the Arab point man for
the new offensive, he is of course being aided in this effort
by Yasser Arafat, who has proposed another scheme. Under it,
Israel would immediately withdraw from the West Bank to be
replaced by U.N. forces, until, as he says, "a final
settlement -- Palestinian sovereignty -- is reached." Mr.
Arafat knows that U.N. forces wouldn't stay long on the West
Bank. The PLO would gain control of the territory without
having to make any meaningful concessions to Israeli
security. Understandably, Israel's Yitzhak Shamir quickly
rejected the U.N. idea.</p>
<p>Astonishingly, U.S. Secretary of State James Baker has
sent signals that he supports some U.N. role on the West
Bank. The White House also grabbed Mr. Arafat's bait by
dwelling on the phony issue of new Soviet Jewish settlements
on the West Bank. Fewer than 1% of the Soviets have chosen to
settle there; they just emerged from an embattled
environment, and don't want to move to another. President
Bush compounded this by also criticizing settlements in East
Jerusalem, a departure in American rhetoric.</p>
<p>On April 16, Mr. Arafat went out of his way to praise
President Bush and Secretary Baker for their "good
intentions" in the region. U.S. good intentions
notwithstanding, Palestinian terrorists launched a large
attack via speedboats yesterday against Israeli beach-front
hotels on the Jewish holiday of Shavuot. Against a mountain
of proof, the State Department has refused to acknowledge
that the PLO remains implicated in the terrorism. Though
Saddam Hussein has emerged as a brutal dictator, the
administration continues to placate him.</p>
<p>The tilt toward the Arabs is no doubt part of some arcane
diplomatic strategy by which the State Department hopes to
solve the riddles of the West Bank and 42 years of Middle
East tension. We doubt the White House has any overt
intention of departing from the historic bipartisan consensus
that has committed the United States to Israel's continued
existence. But recent U.S. diplomatic activity in the Middle
East surely creates ambiguities about whether the U.S. would
in fact intervene to support Israel in a military crunch. And
Mr. Hussein is neither a prudent nor cautious man.</p>
<p>It is of course to be hoped that nothing will come of Mr.
Hussein's threats. But if some fit of anger or madness leads
him to unleash a chemical-weapons assault on Israel,
President Bush and Secretary Baker (and for that matter Mr.
Gorbachev) might face an excruciating decision: Would they
allow another Holocaust to take place on their watch? We
expect the Bush administration would follow the historic
American commitment rather than its own recent bobbing and
weaving. But if so, it might be a good idea for it to let Mr.
Hussein know now rather than stand silent before his
bellicose threats. Ambiguity may be a clever negotiating
ploy, but clarity of American intent is the way to stop war
from happening.</p>
