	<p class="article-leader">Chrysler Corp. vice chairman Gerald Greenwald, the heir
apparent to succeed Chairman Lee A. Iacocca, is leaving the
No. 3 U.S. auto maker to lead a proposed buy-out of United
Airlines by UAL Corp.'s unions.
   Chrysler and UAL announced the move yesterday evening,
after the stock market closed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The move was startling because, as recently as last
Friday, the 54-year-old executive instructed a Chrysler
spokesman to say there was "nothing to" reports that he might
join the buy-out.</p>
<p>Since two other Chrysler vice presidents also recently
announced their departures, Mr. Greenwald's move creates
uncertainty at a time the No. 3 auto maker needs to focus on
regaining lost market share and boosting profitability.</p>
<p>At Chrysler, Mr. Greenwald faced considerable personal
uncertainties: the auto maker's long-term viability as an
independent company, and whether the 65-year-old Mr. Iacocca
will actually retire at the end of next year, as tentatively
planned.</p>
<p>Now Mr. Greenwald will face considerable risks. He will be
aligning himself with a transaction that financial analysts
and Wall Street investors have given only a 50-50 chance of
succeeding because of poor market conditions for financing
leveraged buy-outs.</p>
<p>But Mr. Greenwald's presence provides the buy-out effort
with a major shot in the arm. The unions needed to show they
could attract credible management in order to secure bank
financing for the $4.38 billion deal. Mr. Greenwald, a
well-respected figure in financial circles, will spearhead
efforts to obtain financing, which must be completed by Aug.
9, union advisers said. If the takeover succeeds, Mr.
Greenwald would become the airline's chairman, replacing
Stephen M. Wolf.</p>
<p>One takeover stock trader predicted yesterday's
developments could boost UAL's stock price by $5 a share
today. UAL stock, which has remained far below the nominal
$201-a-share price of the union bid, closed yesterday at
$150.875, down 62.5 cents, in composite trading on the New
York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>"I was approached at the right time and with the right
challenge," said Mr. Greenwald, in a statement. "I've been
offered an opportunity to lead another great company during a
period of major transition and it's an opportunity I can't
turn down."</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwald was a major architect of the financial
restructuring that led Chrysler out of near-bankruptcy in the
early 1980s.</p>
<p>In his statement, Mr. Greenwald didn't indicate any
concern for the company he is leaving. "Future product
programs are on schedule and securely funded, product quality
has been steadily increasing, significant progress has been
made in reducing costs and, most important, our market share
has started to rebound from its April low," he said.</p>
<p>But a Chrysler spokesman acknowledged that possible
uncertainty about Mr. Greenwald's personal future may have
played a role in his decision. Mr. Greenwald "is the heir
apparent here but that doesn't necessarily mean he'd be the
heir."</p>
<p>The 65-year-old Mr. Iacocca signed a contract with
Chrysler that expires at the end of 1991. But recently, the
Chrysler chairman has been coy about whether he actually will
leave next year, telling audiences in Chicago and Los Angeles
that he hasn't made a decision about the matter.</p>
<p>In a statement, Mr. Iacocca said Mr. Greenwald leaves
Chrysler "with my deep gratitude and highest respect for the
job he's done here. He has told me that it's time for him to
run his own show . . . he is a major management talent and
he'll have a chance to show it."</p>
<p>The unions said Mr. Greenwald's name surfaced early in
their two-month search, which was managed by Spencer Stuart,
an executive-recruitment firm. In all, the unions considered
more than 50 names. Recently, the names were whittled down to
a list of about six managers, none of whom currently works
for airlines. The labor group said they ruled out any current
airline chief executives early in the search.</p>
<p>If the takeover succeeds, Mr. Greenwald will be entering
unfamiliar territory. He has no previous airline experience.
However, UAL's unions said they were less concerned about
enlisting an executive with airline experience than in
tapping one they believe could work well with labor and
command Wall Street's respect.</p>
<p>The labor group said it will probably seek an airline
executive to take the No. 2 post. Union advisers said they
will begin working on filling that position now that a
chairman candidate is on board. They also indicated they want
to keep several of the 40 members of UAL's current senior
management team.</p>
<p>In his new role, Mr. Greenwald faces the daunting task of
leading the largest experiment ever in employee ownership,
where he will answer to a board of union leaders and their
hand-picked outside directors.</p>
<p>At Chrysler, he got mixed reviews from labor leaders.
However, leaders of the three UAL unions praised him, with
John Peterpaul, vice president of the International
Association of Machinists, hailing him as "a top-notch
executive with a proven performance record who's shown he can
get along with workers."</p>
<p>Mr. Peterpaul said the UAL union has agreed to pay Mr.
Greenwald $1.1 million a year over five years, which matches
the compensation package Mr. Greenwald received from Chrysler
in 1989. He will also be compensated for Chrysler stock
options he lost and given an undisclosed amount of UAL stock.</p>
<p>UAL paid current chairman Mr. Wolf a $6.7 million bonus to
take the job.</p>
<p>Chrysler didn't say whether it will replace Mr. Greenwald,
or who will assume his current duties, which include acting
as adviser and sounding board for Mr. Iacocca and overseeing
Chrysler's technology, financial, international, parts,
quality and productivity operations.</p>
<p>"There's no shortage of very able executives at Chrysler"
who would like to assume his mantle as Mr. Iacocca's
successor, however, said David Healy, a long-time automobile
industry analyst.</p>
<p>The prime candidates are Robert A. Lutz, the 58-year-old
president of Chrysler Motors, and Robert S. Miller Jr., 48,
executive vice president and chief financial officer.</p>
<p>A possible third candidate could be Bennett E. Bidwell,
62, chairman of Chrysler Motors. But Mr. Bidwell has broadly
hinted that he might take early retirement, although he told
reporters recently he won't retire in 1990. He hasn't ruled
out a departure after that, however.</p>
<p>The Chrysler spokesman downplayed the timing of Mr.
Greenwald's announcement -- coming within two weeks of
similar announcements by Chrysler's treasurer and vice
president of international operations.</p>
<p>"I know what it looks like," he said. "But I don't think
these three are in any way, shape or form related."</p>
<p>Still, Chrysler faces considerable challenges as it enters
a two-year period that will prove critical to its long-term
survival. Among the problems it faces are a dearth of
all-new, high-volume cars until at least 1992. In addition,
even though the company is introducing a new minivan this
fall, production constraints currently prevent Chrysler from
boosting output much above traditional capacity levels --
which means no big boost in sales.</p>
