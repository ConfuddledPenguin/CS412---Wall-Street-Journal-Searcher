	<p class="article-leader">Over-the-counter stocks gained slightly as ardor for
technology shares cooled a bit.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 1.26 to 458.77, a 0.28%,
gain, matching the rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
Advancing stocks continued to lead over declining shares,
1,041 to 923, as volume rose to 169.4 million from 134
million Tuesday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I saw them take everything a little too fast and too soon
right at the opening," said James Tarantino, head of OTC
trading at Hambrecht & Quist in San Francisco. The Nasdaq
Composite Index gained more than 2 points by midmorning
before fading. "That left {stocks} vulnerable later in the
day," Mr. Tarantino said, adding that he saw some
"nervousness" in late-afternoon trading.</p>
<p>Technology shares are beginning to falter with the
approach of summer, typically a slow season for the computer
industry, according to two managers of technology funds.
"Summer generally is not a good time to own tech stocks,"
said William Keithler, manager of the $75 million Financial
Dynamics Fund of Denver-based Financial Programs.</p>
<p>Larry Bowman, manager of the Fidelity Select Computer Fund
and Fidelity Select Technology Fund, Boston, explains that
summer demand for computer wares are particularly weak in
Europe, where August is a big vacation month. Typically
there's a sell-off in technology shares by the end of the
summer, when computer companies are reporting weak revenue,
Mr. Keithler added.</p>
<p>Mr. Keithler and Mr. Bowman said they've already begun
paring back their technology holdings, taking profits in
stocks they think have become too expensive and holding on to
shares of companies with strong earnings-growth momentum.
Both men said they are selling shares of Apple Computer.</p>
<p>Mr. Bowman, who noted that the last quarter of the year is
typically a strong one for technology stocks, said he's
holding on to issues of Pyramid Technology, Quantum, Applied
Materials, MCI, Maxtor and Intelligent Electronics. Mr.
Keithler said he likes LSI Logic, Seagate Technology and
Intel.</p>
<p>Shares of Adobe Systems continued to trade heavily,
falling 2 1/2 to 35 3/8 on 3.7 million shares. Technology
analyst Peter D. Schleider of Wessels, Arnold & Henderson,
Minneapolis, said in an interview he downgraded his
investment opinion on the Mountain View, Calif., software
maker to "hold" from "buy."</p>
<p>Mr. Schleider said that given Adobe's surprise revenue
outlook last week, along with his earnings estimate for the
company, he thinks the stock is fairly valued at $30 a share,
but no higher. The analyst pointed out that Adobe has been
losing some market share for inexpensive software for
printers to Hewlett-Packard and isn't expected to come out
with a competitive product until the fourth quarter. He
estimates that Adobe will earn $1.65 a share in fiscal 1990,
ending in November, and $2.45 in 1991. But, he added, the
company must do well in the next two quarters to reach those
levels. In the long run, however, he said that he believes
Adobe "is a very solid company."</p>
<p>Elmwood Federal Savings rose 1/4 to 13 1/4. Susquehanna
Bancshares of Lititz, Pa., said it will now buy the Media,
Pa., bank in a stock swap valued at about $15.85 a share,
down from an indicated value of about $19 a share agreed to
in November. The revised terms call for an exchange of shares
at a rate of 0.88 Susquehanna share for each for each Elmwood
share outstanding. Susquehanna said the price was reduced "in
light of recent changes in the market for bank stocks."</p>
<p>Psicor gained 1/4 to 8 1/2 after the San Diego, Calif.,
medical service company said that Diatek Inc. will develop
for Psicor a data base management system used in surgery.</p>
<p>Immucor rose 1/4 to 14 3/4 after the Norcross, Ga., maker
of blood-bank reagent systems and related products said late
Tuesday it plans to acquire its German distributor, Immucor
G.m.b.H, which markets blood collection bags and Immucor's
products.</p>
<p>First American (Tennessee) advanced 1 to 14 3/4 after the
Nashville, Tenn., bank named vice chairman James F. Smith Jr.
to replace chairman, president and chief executive officer
Kenneth L. Roberts on an interim basis.</p>
<p>Goulds Pumps added 3/4 to 21 3/4. Goldman Sachs analyst
Thomas G. Burns Jr. spoke positively about the stock, Dow
Jones Professional Investor Report said. The company's chief
financial officer, John Morphy, told DJPIR there weren't any
corporate developments to account for the rise, but said he
was comfortable with Mr. Burns's estimates that Goulds will
earn $1.50 a share in 1990 and $1.70 a share in 1991, up from
$1.41 in 1989.</p>
<p>Office Depot tumbled 2 1/4 to 18 3/4 on nearly eight times
average volume. The Boca Raton, Fla., operator of office
supply stores said that sales for the second quarter ending
in June will be lower than originally expected. The company
said it plans to open nine new stores in the quarter, but
several will open later than anticipated. Office Depot also
said that gross margins are being hurt by pricing
competitiveness, but it hopes to offset that weakness in
other ways.</p>
<p>Survival Technology slid 1/2 to 9 3/4 after the Bethesda,
Md., medical technology concern said two-thirds of its common
stock outstanding was left to the Stanley J. Sarnoff
Endowment for Cardiovascular Science Inc. by Dr. Sarnoff, the
company's founder, who died May 23. The company's board
elected James H. Miller, president, to succeed Dr. Sarnoff as
chief executive.</p>
<p>Rax Restaurants dipped 1/4 to 2 1/8. The Columbus, Ohio,
chain of fast food restaurants reported that the loss in the
fiscal third quarter ended April 30 narrowed to 10 cents a
share from a loss of 27 cents a year earlier.</p>
