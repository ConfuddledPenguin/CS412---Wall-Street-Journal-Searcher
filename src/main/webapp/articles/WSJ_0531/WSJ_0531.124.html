	<p class="article-leader">Delaware's governor yesterday signed into law a measure
that allows banks chartered in the state to underwrite and
sell insurance nationwide to consumers.
   A few other states allow a limited number of banks to
underwrite insurance, but Delaware is the first to put such
broad legislation on its books. The new law opens the door to
major and superregional banks, several of which already had
financial services operations in the state. It also could
make Delaware a springboard for national insurance-marketing
efforts by banks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>About a dozen banks with operations in Delaware could
benefit from the new law, and some are moving quickly to take
advantage of it. Shortly after Gov. Michael Castle signed the
banking bill yesterday afternoon, New York-based Chase
Manhattan Corp. announced plans to transfer its Delaware
subsidiary, Chase Manhattan Bank (USA), from a federal to a
state charter.</p>
<p>Chase said its Delaware unit plans to underwrite and sell
homeowners and auto insurance, possibly in partnership with
other insurance carriers, using direct mail, telemarketing
and advertising.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Citicorp said the New York-based bank
plans to establish a headquarters in Kent County for
underwriting and agency purposes. This office will eventually
employ approximately 300 to 500 people.</p>
<p>The Delaware banking law allows banks chartered in the
state after 1933 to engage in all aspects of the insurance
business through separate divisions or subsidiaries. Assets,
liabilities and records of the insurance units are to be kept
separate from those of the bank. A bank can't invest more
than 25% of its total capital, surplus and undivided profits
in its insurance operations.</p>
<p>Banks pushed aggressively to get this banking bill through
the Delaware Legislature. They see insurance as a
multibillion-dollar business that they want to enter on a
large scale. The Castle administration and some state
officials backed the measure, because it holds the promise of
generating thousands of new jobs that could prolong the
state's economic boom.</p>
<p>The powerful insurance lobby waged a bitter battle in the
past two years to try to defeat the bill. Insurance agents
claimed that the banks would bring unfair competition to the
market. Insurance company officials fear that the solvency
safeguards in the new law might not withstand a crisis and
capital shortage.</p>
<p>A group of five insurance trade associations requested the
Federal Reserve to block the Delaware law. The insurers are
asking the Fed to rule that federal bank holding company
regulation prohibits the nationwide sale of insurance by a
bank's nonbanking subsidiary.</p>
<p>Gov. Castle also signed into law a companion bill that
offers some protection to insurance agents in Delaware. This
law limits banks' marketing of insurance to Delaware
residents. The companion bill was designed by state senators
to win the votes needed to get the banking bill through the
Delaware Senate.</p>
