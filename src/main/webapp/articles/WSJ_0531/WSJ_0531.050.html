	<p class="article-leader">In another move to reduce its debt, the Anglo-American
pharmaceutical company SmithKline Beecham PLC said it agreed
to sell its European cosmetics businesses to closely held
Joh. A. Benckiser G.m.b.H. of West Germany, a household
chemical company, for #210 million ($355.6 million).
   The sale, which requires West German government approval,
involves the Margaret Astor and Lancaster businesses, which
had 1989 sales of #264 million; the rights to several
designer brands, and manufacturing facilities in West
Germany, France and Spain. Benckiser's payment will be made
in at least two installments, the first for about #176
million on completion of the sale, expected in about a month.
SmithKline said the deal brings to #701 million the sum it
has raised in its continuing program of selling assets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Benckiser said the acquisition will boost its 1990 sales
more than 50% to 3.4 billion marks ($2.03 billion). The
purchase, Benckiser's first in the cosmetics industry, also
marks its second deal with SmithKline; in December, it bought
the U.S.-based Household Products operations for #66 million.</p>
