	<p class="article-leader">Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd., Toronto, said it was notified
that one of its shareholders will seek a temporary court
injunction to block the gold mining company's planned
offering of 40 million Canadian dollars (US$33.9 million) in
common shares and share-purchase warrants.
   Application for the injunction will be made tomorrow in
Quebec Superior Court by Jacques Forget, who owns about 3% of
Agnico's shares, the company said. Agnico said Mr. Forget
also will seek a permanent injunction, on grounds concerning
the company's management, operations and policies. Mr.
Forget, who has said he plans to establish a group of holders
to pursue a takeover bid for Agnico, has accused the company
of "errors in management, which undermined shareholders'
equity and pushed down the share price."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Agnico said it will contest the injunction applications,
which it said are "totally without merit." The company said
it will proceed with its planned offering of shares and
warrants.</p>
