	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. and
several local companies have committed $39 million toward a
targeted $125 million investment fund for building 4,000
low-income housing units in California.
   The five-year fund raising effort is spearheaded by the
Local Initiatives Support Corp., a nonprofit community
development organization formed by the Ford Foundation in
1979. The organization operates three investment funds --
National Equity Fund, California Equity Fund and New York
Equity Fund -- which allow companies to take advantage of
federal and state tax credits for investing in low-income
housing. Since their inception in 1987 and 1988, the funds
have raised $141 million from 59 companies, and invested in
more than 5,200 rental apartments and houses in 23 cities.</p>

California fund, agreeing to invest one dollar for every two
raised by a California company. The quasi-private agency has
previously invested $11 million in the National and New York
Equity Funds.</p>
<p>Great Western Financial Corp. and Security Pacific Corp.'s
Security Pacific National Bank each invested $10 million for
the five-year California effort. City National Corp.'s City
National Bank committed $5 million for five years. Atlantic
Richfield Co., Avery International Corp., H.F. Ahmanson &
