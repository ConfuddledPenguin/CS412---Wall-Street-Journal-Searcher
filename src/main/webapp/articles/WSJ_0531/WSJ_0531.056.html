	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Bond prices inched higher again in light
trading activity as investors continued to mark time ahead of
two key economic reports due out tomorrow.
   The most important of the two indicators is the May
employment report, which is anxiously awaited because it will
provide the first official reading on how the economy
performed this month. The findings in the report are expected
to set the tone in the bond market for the next several
weeks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"People are not willing to speculate in the bond market
with a report of such importance coming out," said Michael
Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc.</p>
<p>Also due tomorrow is the May survey of the nation's
purchasing agents. Dealers and analysts said indications of a
sluggish economy in data issued yesterday morning on April
leading indicators and new home sales helped to buoy bond
prices.</p>
<p>"The data that came out this morning were positive, and
that set the tone for trading during the day," said Brian
Fabbri, chief economist at Midland Montague Securities Inc.
Leading indicators fell 0.2% last month, which was in line
with market forecasts. New home sales fell more than expected
to their weakest pace since December 1982.</p>
<p>Sales of new single-family houses fell 1.6% in April to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 546,000, the Commerce
Department said.</p>
<p>The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended 1/4 point
higher, or up $2.50 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The
issue's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its
price, eased slightly to 8.59%.</p>
<p>The highlight of an otherwise dull session was the Federal
Reserve's purchase of an estimated $3.5 billion to $4 billion
of Treasury bills for its own account in an infrequent
operation known as a bill pass.</p>
<p>The Fed's action, which added reserves to the banking
system, had only a small impact on bond prices because it was
viewed as technical in nature.</p>
<p>"The action meets a seasonal need for increased reserves
and has no monetary policy significance," said Louis
Crandall, an economist with R.H. Wrightson & Associates.</p>
<p>The Fed's bill pass did push Treasury bill rates lower
because it helped to sop up some of the new supply in the
short end of the market, analysts said.</p>
<p>In addition to yesterday's sale of $12 billion of
cash-management bills, the Treasury will sell $10 billion of
52-week bills today and a record $17.2 billion of three-month
and six-month bills Monday.</p>
<p>The bill pass "helped to relieve some of the congestion in
the bill market," said Mr. Moran. Also in the short end of
the market, the federal funds rate fell to 7%, well below the
8 1/4% perceived target.</p>
<p>However, the softness in the funds rate, which banks
charge each other on overnight loans, had little effect on
the market because it was attributed to yesterday being the
final day of a two-week statement period, when funds often
fluctuate widely as banks adjust their reserve positions.</p>
<p>Traders said that apprehension about tomorrow's data was
reflected in rumors circulating in the bond market that the
index of the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago,
due to be released today at 10 a.m. EDT, would show a strong
rebound in that region's manufacturing sector.</p>
<p>The Chicago survey is closely watched by the bond market
because many players believe it can provide an early reading
of the national survey, due tomorrow.</p>
<p>However, the composite diffusion index of the National
Association of Purchasing Management is expected to have
declined to 49.5% in May, according to the average of
estimates of 10 economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital
Markets Report.</p>
<p>In April, the index was pegged at 50.2%, the first time in
a year that it was above the 50% level. A reading above 50%
indicates an expanding industrial sector, and a reading below
50% suggests the sector is contracting.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, employment growth is expected to have picked up
considerably in May, with nonfarm payrolls expected to have
increased 253,000, with a gain of 135,000 seen if newly hired
census workers are excluded, according to a Capital Markets
Report survey of 20 economists.</p>
<p>In the month, the civilian unemployment rate is expected
to have been unchanged at 5.4%. The jobless rate rose 0.2
percentage point in April.</p>
<p>Municipals</p>
<p>Investors willing to gamble to get high yields went flying
after a $201 million special project revenue bond issue by
the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.</p>
<p>Yields on the bonds, sold on behalf of Continental and
Eastern airlines, topped 9%, about two percentage points
higher than the average municipal bond. The new bonds posted
the highest yields seen on a municipal issue in almost three
years.</p>
<p>The yields were high because the bonds aren't rated and
aren't obligations of the Port Authority, which means the
authority is under no responsibility to repay the bonds if
the airlines default on the debt.</p>
<p>The bonds, which are subject to alternative minimum tax,
fall into the "speculative" category, which means they are
essentially municipal junk bonds.</p>
<p>Although Continental, a unit of Texas Air Corp., is
modestly profitable, Eastern is operating under Chapter 11 of
the federal Bankruptcy Code. Eastern, a former Texas Air
unit, has been put in the hands of a trustee by the
bankruptcy court.</p>
<p>Despite these facts, underwriters led by Smith Barney,
Harris Upham & Co. said the bonds drew strong demand from
institutional and high net-worth individual retail investors.</p>
<p>The bonds were priced to yield from 9.38% for bonds that
mature in 2005 to 9.63% for bonds that mature in 2015. In
comparison, the Bond Buyer municipal bond index yielded 7.62%
yesterday.</p>
<p>Proceeds from the sale will be used to build a new 10-gate
passenger terminal at La Guardia Airport in New York.</p>
<p>Traders say Continental, based on its own credit, would
have to pay exorbitantly high yields to do this type of
unsecured bond deal in the corporate market. Also, this type
of special project financing is usually done in the municipal
market. Continental's corporate junk bonds generally yield
between 17% and 19%.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, most actively traded municipal bonds ended
between 1/8 and 1/4 point higher. New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% bonds due in 2018 rose 1/8 point to 98 bid
to yield 7.36%.</p>
<p>Corporate Issues</p>
<p>The junk bonds of a Bally Manufacturing Corp. subsidiary
surged on news that the company is launching an exchange
offer that analysts called favorable to bondholders.</p>
<p>Bally Health & Tennis's 13 5/8% senior subordinated
debentures rocketed five points to finish the session at 58.</p>
<p>Under terms of the exchange offer, each holder of Bally
Health & Tennis 13 5/8% subordinated debentures will receive
57 shares of Bally common stock for each $1,000 principal
amount of debentures tendered. Based on yesterday's closing
price of $10.625 for the common stock, analysts said
bondholders would receive equity worth almost $606 for each
$1,000 principal amount of debentures exchanged. That's
considerably more than what the bonds were trading at before
news of the exchange offer.</p>
<p>The junk bonds of R.H. Macy & Co. weakened after news that
other vendors and lenders are concerned about the retailer's
financial health.</p>
<p>Macy's 14 1/2% senior subordinated debentures due in 1998
ended at a bid price of 68, off one point from Tuesday. The
14 1/2% subordinated debentures maturing in 2001 finished at
a bid of 58 1/2, down 1/2 point.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Michelin Finance B.V. said its offers to buy
Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co.'s and UGTC Capital Corp.'s junk
bonds expired Tuesday without any bonds changing hands.</p>
<p>Traders said investors are holding out, expecting Michelin
to sweeten the offer. But some investors are doubtful that a
higher offer will materialize, which explains why Uniroyal
Goodrich junk weakened slightly. The company's 14 1/8% senior
subordinated notes lost 1/4 point to end at 110 3/4.</p>
<p>Most junk bonds, or speculative-grade bonds with low
credit ratings or no credit ratings, ended about 1/4 point
higher.</p>
<p>Investment-grade corporate bonds also closed about 1/4
point higher.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 101 18/32,
compared with 101 10/32 on Tuesday. The latest 10-year notes
ended at a price of 101 22/32 to yield 8.60%, compared with
101 15/32 to yield 8.63%.</p>
<p>Short-term rates moved lower. The discount rate on
three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.75% for a
bond-equivalent yield of 7.99%, while the rate on six-month
bills ended at 7.67% to yield 8.07%.</p>
<p>Here are details of yesterday's sale of cash-management
bills:</p>
<p>Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon-equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.</p>
<p>                            20-Day           111-Day</p>
<p>                                                                                                    

 Applications ............ $29,598,000,000  $43,455,000,000

<p>Both issues are dated June 1. The 20-day bills mature June
21, and the 111-day bills mature Sept. 20.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>British government bonds, which have risen considerably in
the past month, ended sharply higher again.</p>
<p>Prices of long-term gilts climbed more than one point
during early trading, but they gave back some of the gains
later to end about 3/4 point higher.</p>
<p>As in previous sessions, the impetus for the rally came
from the foreign exchange markets, where the pound resumed
its upward climb, especially against the mark.</p>
<p>Once again, speculation about the imminent entry of the
pound into the exchange rate mechanism of the European
Monetary System was the starting point for the pound's rise.
Dealers said the latest speculation began ahead of a meeting
between Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major and his French
counterpart, Pierre Beregovoy. But no announcement on the
exchange rate mechanism was scheduled nor was such a meeting
expected by analysts.</p>
<p>In Paris, Mr. Major helped damp the market's euphoria by
reiterating that monetary policy must remain tight for some
time to come and that higher interest rates can't be ruled
out.</p>
<p>The Bank of England contributed to cooling things off with
its money market operations. Faced with an estimated shortage
in the money markets yesterday of #1.15 billion ($1.95
billion), the bank quickly arranged only #15 million of
repurchase agreements and then purchased through the rest of
the day a total of only #948 million of short-term bills to
help meet the shortage.</p>
<p>"That was a clear signal to the market not to be looking
for lower interest rates soon," one dealer said.</p>
<p>Britain's benchmark 11 3/4% security due in 2003/2007
ended 3/4 higher at 100 1/8 to yield 11.72%, while 12% notes
due in 1995 rose 9/32 to 98 29/32 to yield 12.29%.</p>
<p>Mortgage-Backed Securities</p>
<p>After being stalled at their opening levels throughout the
morning, prices of mortgage-backed securities steadily edged
higher to stand at session highs late in the day.</p>
<p>Government National Mortgage Association 9 1/2% securities
for June delivery were up 9/32 to 98 16/32. The spread
between the Ginnie Mae issue and the Treasury 10-year note
remained at 1.25 percentage points.</p>
<p>News that sales of new single-family homes in April fell
1.6% had little impact on the mortgage-backed market.</p>
<p>Ginnie Mae 9% securities were up 10/32 at 96 3/32, and 10%
securities were at 100 29/32, up 6/32.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9 1/2%
securities were up 6/32 at 98 1/32, and 10% securities were
at 100 1/ 32, up 5/32. Federal National Mortgage Association
9 1/2% securities were up 6/32 at 98 17/32, and 10%
securities were at 100 18/32, up 5/32.</p>
