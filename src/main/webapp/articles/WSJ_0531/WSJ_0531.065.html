	<p class="article-leader">POGO PRODUCING Co. said that holders of its 10%
convertible subordinated notes, due May 1, 1994, elected to
convert their notes to additional shares of the company's
common stock. The total face amount of the debentures is $20
million. The conversion represents 3,333,333 common shares at
a conversion price of $6 a share. Before the conversion, the
Houston oil and natural gas exploration and production
company had 24.1 million common shares outstanding. Pogo said
its total debt and production payment obligations are now
less than $287 million, down from $346 million at the close
of the first quarter of 1989.</p>
