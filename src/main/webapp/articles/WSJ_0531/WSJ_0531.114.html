	<p class="article-leader">Homer Simpson, the decidedly downscale patriarch of Fox
Broadcasting's "The Simpsons," has become a pop icon. So has
Roseanne Barr, the proletarian star of ABC's hit series
"Roseanne."
   Regular folks are back in fashion, a fact that hasn't
escaped the attention of some of the nation's most powerful
marketers. Blue-collar and other nonprofessional people have
always represented a vast and loyal group of consumers. But
now, with growth in most upscale markets slowing to a crawl,
more companies than ever are viewing them with renewed
respect.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Consider: McDonald's Corp. features working stiffs in new
TV commercials. Burger King Corp. plans to use cartoon
characters from "The Simpsons" in promotions. A Southern
cable operator has revamped its marketing to lure low-income
viewers. Clothing maker Gitano Group Inc. cultivates a trendy
image, but focuses its products and prices on middle America.</p>
<p>Procter & Gamble Co. advertises some of its top brands in
the National Enquirer.</p>
<p>Of course, it wouldn't make sense to peddle luxury items
to consumers who can't afford them. But for most of the past
decade, Madison Avenue has been loath to target downscale
markets for even mundane products. In part, that's because
advertisers like to show their products as part of an
affluent life style.</p>
<p>Some critics also attribute the lack of interest to a
cultural bias on the part of image makers, who often create
marketing campaigns that tend to reflect their own life
styles more than the lives of average consumers. "Nobody
wants to work on a downscale product," says a New York ad
executive. "We're all pretty upscale people, and we all wear
the prestige products we've worked on on our sleeves."</p>
<p>It's hard to dispute the demographic appeal of Middle
America. The average household earns about $34,000 a year,
according to the most recent Census Bureau figures. That may
not be in a league with gilded yuppiedom, but because of
their numbers, households that live on that figure or less
control more than 30% of total income in the U.S.</p>
<p>Moreover, middle-class consumers may respond to
down-to-earth pitches in growing numbers because more are
feeling squeezed. Since the early 1970s, family incomes have
hardly managed to stay ahead of inflation. For baby boomers
starting out, that makes upward mobility more difficult.
Allow for climbing health-care costs, property taxes and
tuition bills rising much faster than inflation, and the
ranks of penny pinchers swell.</p>
<p>"It's the phenomenon of the fading fortunate," says Carol
Colman, a partner in the New York consulting firm Inferential
Focus. "Marketers may have made the mistake of thinking
average Americans made $75,000, and now even that
aspirational group is feeling squeezed."</p>
<p>The appeal of the blue-collar market goes beyond the
numbers. Despite their image as traitorous coupon clippers,
lower-income consumers may actually be more brand-loyal than
their wealthier counterparts. Because they can less afford to
make mistakes, experts say they're more likely to stick with
a brand that pleases them. "A brand is a safety net for these
groups," says Stewart Owen, director of research at Landor
Associates, a San Francisco image consulting firm.</p>
<p>Marketers are trying a range of techniques to woo the
diverse downscale market. McDonald's, for example, exalts the
average guy in several new TV commercials created by Leo
Burnett Co. Though the nation's largest purveyor of meals for
the masses has never courted the silk-stocking set, several
ads rolled out in early May more pointedly reflect the modest
life styles of some of its customers.</p>
<p>In one spot, a nervous suitor launches into a monologue on
his prospective date's doorstep. He's not a doctor or a
lawyer, he proclaims, but a record-store salesperson. The
awkward Romeo is eager to set the record straight on a few
other points: He doesn't wear designer clothes or go to
restaurants that refer to themselves as "bistro." The woman
is enchanted, of course, and happily follows him to the curb
-- where his 1980 Chevrolet Citation awaits.</p>
<p>In another ad, a little girl waits for her mother to
return from work on a rainy night. When the woman --
apparently a single mom -- finally arrives looking exhausted,
the child reminds her of a promised meal at McDonald's. On
the way to the restaurant, the daughter listens to the
account of her mother's trying day at work. "We're saying
it's OK to be regular," says a McDonald's spokesman.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, rival Burger King, a unit of Grand Metropolitan
PLC, seems to be sending the message that it's all right to
be a little weird. The fast-food chain plans a series of
promotions starting this summer based on "The Simpsons." A
spokesman for Fox confirms that Burger King has licensed the
characters Homer Simpson, a safety inspector at his town's
nuclear power plant, and his puckish son, Bart, to push
burgers.</p>
<p>Other marketers are going much further. Birmingham Cable,
which operates cable-TV systems in Birmingham, Ala., and
nearby Bessemer, has repositioned its service to draw
working-class customers. Though the company was doing well
among upscale residents, lower-income people weren't hooking
up in large numbers -- bad news since such customers account
for about two-thirds of the population in the systems'
territories.</p>
<p>Through a research firm that develops neighborhood
profiles, the cable operator found its territory includes a
cluster of neighborhoods occupied mainly by single adults and
one-parent families who earn an average of $15,000 a year.
Market research also showed that such consumers are put off
by complicated pitches.</p>
<p>So, Birmingham Cable changed its approach. The company
ditched a glossy brochure, which had included a letter and a
response form, in favor of a brief appeal, and it began to
push the service as cheap family entertainment rather than as
a luxury. Response to the modified mailer more than doubled.</p>
<p>The cable operator also started advertising its monthly
charges, rather than breaking the cost of the service down to
40 cents a day, a tactic customers found suspicious. "The
people in these market segments are very good money
managers," says Rod Clark, vice president of marketing at
Birmingham Cable. "They're worried about hidden costs."</p>
<p>For many marketers, targeting the blue-collar brigades is
a matter of finding the right vehicle. Procter & Gamble
places ads in some unexpected publications. For several
years, P&G has been advertising some of its best-known brands
in the noisy pages of the National Enquirer. Tucked near the
tale of a woman who was run over by her own "van from hell"
in a recent issue was this unfanciful claim: "If it's got to
be clean, it's got to be Tide."</p>
<p>Other marketers court downscale consumers by presenting a
middle-class or affluent image to which they can aspire.
Gitano Group spends some $15 million a year to promote its
women's clothing with slick ads in swanky publications such
as Vogue and Mademoiselle.</p>
<p>But in fact, Gitano clothing is aimed squarely at the
discount crowd. The primary outlets for the company's wares
-- mostly women's tops and bottoms that sell for around $20
-- are mass merchandisers such as K mart Corp. and Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. And despite Gitano's trendy, youthful ads, most
of the clothes are cut to fit more mature bodies. Some of the
brand's big sellers are maternity clothes and jeans for
larger-sized women.</p>
<p>General Mills Inc.'s Hamburger Helper brand of dinner
mixes uses a similar marketing illusion to create a
comfortable, middle-class image. The product, whose sales are
booming, was created in the mid-1970s, when meat prices
soared, as a way to stretch ground beef. But ads for the
boxed dinners stress convenience and taste over economy, and
often feature an affluent-looking suburban family.</p>
<p>Despite the size -- and spending power -- of working-class
America, most marketers don't want their products associated
with the masses. "The marketing community has no aspirations
to address the needs of a demographic group of which it is
not a member," says John Quelch, a professor at Harvard
Business School who specializes in consumer marketing.
Indeed, most brand managers and ad executives have far more
in common with Mr. Quelch's students than with Roseanne or
Homer.</p>
