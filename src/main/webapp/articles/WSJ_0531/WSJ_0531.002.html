	<p class="article-leader">Investors resumed pulling their money out of money-market
mutual funds as yields stayed where they've been since
January.
   Assets of 427 taxable funds fell by $1.1 billion to $375.6
billion in the week ended Tuesday, according to
IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report. The Holliston, Mass.-based
newsletter has reported only one increase in assets in these
funds in the past nine weeks -- the week ended May 15.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Some of the cash "may be going into the stock market,"
said Brenda Malizia Negus, editor of Money Fund Report.
"People may be tempted by the latest rally." Individual
investors accounted for most of the latest outflow -- $830
million.</p>
<p>The average seven-day compound yield of the taxable funds
remained at 7.98% for the second consecutive week. It has
been at or just below 8% for 19 weeks. (Compound yields
assume reinvestment of dividends.)</p>
<p>The average maturity of the funds' investments -- such
things as commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs),
Treasury bills and certificates of deposit -- shortened by a
day to 43 days. It was the first change in seven weeks, but
shifts of one day usually aren't considered significant.</p>
<p>Shorter maturities generally are considered a sign that
portfolio managers think interest rates are rising, because
they allow a fund to latch onto higher rates sooner.
Conversely, longer maturities are thought to indicate
declining rates. Average maturities have been as short as 29
days and as long as 53 days in recent years.</p>
<p>The average seven-day simple yield remained at 7.68%. The
average 30-day simple yield also remained at 7.68% and the
average 30-day compound yield again was 7.98%.</p>
<p>Yields on tax-exempt money funds fell. The average
seven-day compound yield slid to 5.54% from 5.59%. That's
equivalent to 8.27% for an investor paying 33% in taxes, but
just 7.69% for someone in the 28% bracket.</p>
<p>Assets of the 222 tax-free funds tracked by Donoghue's
declined by $289.2 million to $75.4 billion. Average maturity
shortened by a day to 39 days.</p>
