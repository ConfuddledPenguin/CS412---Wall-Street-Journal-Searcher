	<p class="article-leader">Kitkat & Aitkin, the British stock brokerage division of
Royal Bank of Canada, was closed permanently at the end of
trading Tuesday, the bank said.
   "The chronic overcapacity in the securities industry will
probably persist for a number of years, and therefore, it is
unlikely that an acceptable rate of return from Kitkat &
Aitkin can be achieved," John R. Sanders, chairman of RBC
Dominion Securities International, said. He described Kitkat
& Aitkin as a low-cost producer and consistently at the top
of second tier of British brokerage houses.</p>
