	<p class="article-leader">BRUSSELS -- In a devastating condemnation of the European
Community's agricultural policy, the EC's Court of Auditors
found widespread criminal fraud, mismanagement and waste in
its $33 billion-a-year farm-subsidy program.
   The court criticized the EC member states and the EC
Commission for their roles in managing farm policy. The court
said member states provided too few safeguards against
financial abuse and that the commission had failed to satisfy
"the requirements of public accountability."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>John Carey, one of the court's 12 members, said he
couldn't estimate how much money the EC was losing to fraud
and mismanagement. Previous estimates from other sources have
ranged between $3 billion and $10 billion a year. But Mr.
Carey said court investigators had uncovered a series of
multimillion-dollar cases in the past two years including
rigged tendering of contracts, subsidies paid on
misidentified or nonexistent products and other abuses. He
also said the EC's policy was too complex and difficult to
administer.</p>
<p>Guy Legras, the commission's top civil servant in charge
of agriculture, defended the EC's farm policy and the
commission's management of it. He said many of the cases the
court uncovered were blown out of proportion. But the
criticism of the EC farm policy comes at an awkward time for
the commission; it is trying to defend its agriculture policy
in world trade talks and at the same time convince member
states to give more powers to EC institutions.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time the court has faulted EC farm
policy, but the strong language of the report is likely to
get more attention than previous investigations. A U.S. trade
official said she hoped the Court of Auditors report "would
finally wake EC consumers up to the fact that they are paying
through the nose" for a program that is supposed to be
helping farmers but instead is lining the pockets of big
traders, shippers and other middlemen.</p>
<p>The court's findings also could make it more difficult for
the EC to defend its agricultural subsidies program in the
current Uruguay Round of world trade talks. In those talks,
the EC's export-restitution program is blamed by most other
countries for raising retail food prices and creating unfair
competition. Experts say the policy is unfair to producers
from less-developed countries who are often squeezed out of
the market by the subsidized European products.</p>
<p>The independent Court of Auditors is charged with
overseeing financial management of the EC budget, about 54%
of which is composed of the agricultural subsidy program. The
latest investigation covered only beef, dairy and grain
exports. The total export subsidies program costs EC
taxpayers more than $11.5 billion a year.</p>
