	<p class="article-leader">From a speech on the invention of photocopying by Sol M.
Linowitz, a Washington lawyer, given at the Bicentennial
Celebration of United States Patent and Copyright Laws in
Washington this month:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>After Haloid {Xerox's predecessor} acquired the rights to
xerography, the company set forth on its mission to develop
the invention, and to explore and fulfill its promise. The
crucial fact is that it took 14 years between the time Haloid
obtained the first license on the Carlson patents and the
successful introduction of the first truly commercial
product, the Xerox 914. They were years of anguish,
uncertainty, disappointment, frustration and only occasional
satisfaction during which we were never entirely sure that
xerography would ever be a success. It took truly tenacious
commitment to bring it all to pass.</p>
<p>How did it happen? I think there were several qualities
that gave Haloid and later Xerox its special character.</p>
<p>First, there was faith in the idea. From the beginning
there was a belief in this untried, uncertain and still
largely ephemeral concept about which many more sophisticated
companies had misgivings. It took faith -- and some
foolhardiness -- to pursue xerography with such commitment
when we knew that other, more knowledgeable, experienced and
competent companies had looked at and turned down. . . .</p>
<p>A second essential characteristic of the company was its
enthusiasm -- a kind of corporate contagious enthusiasm about
what was being done and what might yet be done. From the
beginning there was a feeling of excitement which permeated
Xerox. . . .</p>
<p>Third, there was a sense of idealism. We saw xerography as
far more than a way to make better copies. We sensed not only
a copying revolution but also the nascent information
revolution. . . .</p>
<p>None of this could have happened without our antitrust
laws and the patent system which provided the incentive for
investment in an uncertain technology of potential value.</p>
<p>The protection provided by the patent laws enabled the
international licensing and marketing of a technology that
has brought benefits to the world and continues to reward
improvement in xerographic processing.</p>
