	<p class="article-leader">Susquehanna Bancshares Inc. reduced the value of its offer
to acquire Elmwood Federal Savings Bank by about $5 million,
to a revised price of about $22.8 million in stock.
   By mutual agreement, the two bank companies said that
Elmwood shareholders would receive 0.88 Susquehanna share for
each Elmwood share outstanding. Based on Susquehanna's
closing price of $17.75 a share, down 75 cents, in national
over-the-counter trading yesterday, the transaction has a
value of $15.62 an Elmwood share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Elmwood, based in Media, Pa., has about 1.46 million
shares outstanding. Susquehanna, based in Lititz, Pa., has
about 7.96 million shares outstanding.</p>
<p>In November, the two institutions agreed to a stock-swap
combination valued at about $19 for each Elmwood share, or a
total of about $27.7 million at then-current market prices.</p>
<p>Susquehanna said the price was reduced due to "recent
changes in the market for bank stocks." Because the exchange
ratio for the proposed merger has been fixed, any further
change in Susquehanna's share price would alter the value of
the transaction, an Elmwood spokesman said.</p>
