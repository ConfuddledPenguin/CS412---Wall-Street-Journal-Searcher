	<p class="article-leader">LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- Former Arkla Inc. executive Sheffield
Nelson won the Republican nomination for governor of
Arkansas, besting Tommy Robinson in a bitterly personal
campaign.
   The defeat of Mr. Robinson, a flamboyant U.S. congressman
who described himself as a "junkyard dog," was also a setback
for the powerful Little Rock investment-banking firm of
Stephens Inc. Chairman Jackson T. Stephens heavily backed Mr.
Robinson, causing Mr. Nelson to charge that the chairman was
out to destroy him politically.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Democratic Gov. Bill Clinton, who's widely thought to
harbor presidential ambitions, won renomination for a fifth
term. But the governor's percentage of the vote, about 54% in
a six-candidate race, was lower than expected.</p>
<p>Mr. Nelson is the former chief executive officer of
Shreveport-based Arkla, owner of Arkansas-Louisiana Gas Co.
He's a Democrat-turned-Republican, as is Rep. Robinson, whose
political conversion was announced by President Bush last
year.</p>
