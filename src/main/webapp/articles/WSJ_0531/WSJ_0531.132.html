	<p class="article-leader">Pic `N' Save Corp. posted a 9.6% increase in net income
for the first quarter ended April 29, to $5.9 million, or 17
cents a share, from $5.4 million, or 15 cents a share, a year
earlier.
   Sales of the Dominguez, Calif., close-out retailer rose
26% to $119 million from $94.1 million, with sales in
comparable stores up 5.8% from the year-earlier period.
"While virtually all of our markets contributed to the
increased sales performance of the company, sales from our
newest stores, those in the Southeast, were particularly
strong during the quarter," said Lewis B. Merrifield III,
chairman and chief executive officer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Merrifield also said the company plans to lower its
capital expenditures for new store openings by about $9
million this year compared with last.</p>
<p>Pic `N' Save is seeking to fend off an attempt by Girard
Partners L.P. to seize control of the board.</p>
