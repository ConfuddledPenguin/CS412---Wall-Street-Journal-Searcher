	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Populist Boris Yeltsin's election as president
of the Soviet Union's Russian Republic and expected wrangling
at the Bush-Gorbachev summit over the military status of a
unified Germany highlighted underlying nervousness about
German unification yesterday, driving the mark broadly lower.
   The mark dropped almost a pfennig against the dollar and
slipped about a third of a yen after rallying against both
currencies on Tuesday. The pound, bolstered by British
Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major's remarks supporting
continued high interest rates, rose about 1 1/2 pfennigs
against the mark.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 1.6830 marks, up from 1.6740 marks late Tuesday, and at
151.45 yen, up from 151.25 yen late Tuesday. Sterling was
quoted at $1.6950, up from $1.6940 late Tuesday.</p>
<p>In Tokyo Thursday, the dollar was trading soon after the
opening at 151.62 yen, up from Wednesday's Tokyo close of
150.75 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about
1.6830 marks.</p>
<p>The mark's decline came despite a steady stream of
positive-sounding statements about unification by West German
monetary authorities and news that the West German
cost-of-living index rose a preliminary 0.2% in May.</p>
<p>Anticipation of a moderate cost-of-living figure had
helped the West German currency post gains Tuesday, and past
remarks by West German authorities suggesting that the
process of unification is well in hand have helped boost the
mark.</p>
<p>But both the inflation news and the remarks on unification
were overshadowed yesterday by a burst of pessimism about the
chances for a smooth transition to one Germany, participants
said.</p>
<p>The closer unification gets, the more "people are wary,"
said Jack Griffin, a vice president and corporate trader at
Banque Indosuez in New York.</p>
<p>The election of the maverick Yeltsin to the presidency of
the huge Russian Republic added to traders' nervousness
because he is seen as a rival to Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev and possibly a further destabilizing influence
within the already tumultuous Soviet political scene. Mr.
Gorbachev recently has been widely perceived as having
political trouble at home despite successes overseas.</p>
<p>The issue of a united Germany's membership in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization is likely to be discussed at the
U.S.-Soviet summit meeting that begins today in Washington.
Market participants will watch the summit carefully because
the two sides may find it difficult to compromise on that
issue, traders said.</p>
<p>Chief among the slew of statements by West German
officials yesterday was Bundesbank President Karl Otto
Poehl's remark that the central bank is "very satisfied" with
the state treaty between East and West Germany on economic
and social unification. Rumors of a split between the
Bundesbank and government over the treaty had been weighing
on the West German currency recently, and the mark enjoyed a
slight rebound against the dollar after news of the comment
at midafternoon New York time, but soon lost its gain on
continued selling.</p>
<p>Earlier, Bundesbank directorate member Hans Tietmeyer said
there is no extreme threat of inflation in West Germany due
to unification, a comment supported from the government side
by Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann, who said that the
central bank will take appropriate action to keep West German
inflation below a 3% annual rate after July 2, when the
treaty on unification takes effect.</p>
<p>Mr. Griffin of Banque Indosuez noted that the potential
impact of the statements by West German officials was diluted
by the perception that the remarks were politically motivated
as different forces within West Germany jockey for position
before unification and coming national elections.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for delivery
next month settled at $364.10 an ounce, down $3.30. Estimated
volume was a heavy six million ounces.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at $364.45 an
ounce.</p>
