	<p class="article-leader">He warmed up with a bottle of beer, cleared his throat a
little and slowly headed to the stage. Not for him weeks of
rehearsals and endless caterwauling in the dressing room.
Intermissions he spent wondering where he might party
afterward. "The thought of a good meal after he'd finished
work incited him to his finest performances," recalled Frida
Leider, whose diet suffered whenever she sang Isolde to his
Tristan.
   And what performances. Lauritz Melchior (1890-1973) was
simply amazing. Melchior exhaling could make Brunnhilde's
battle gown billow at 20 paces. His tones were golden; his
declamation eloquent; his stamina astonishing. In the
Wagnerian repertoire nobody today can match him, old-timers
say, and they are right judging by Melchior's numerous
recordings and the pipsqueaks recently heard in the Met's
"Ring" cycle. Even the Melchior Foundation, which
periodically runs a heldentenor competition, has so far
failed to find a replacement for this most heroic tenor and
happy ham.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Just how Melchior got so big in so many ways is the story
told in Shirlee Emmons's "Tristanissimo" (Schirmer/Macmillan,
$24.95). It is a perfectly splendid biography, candid,
informed, amusing and, at 462 pages, appropriately scaled to
a giant who weighed in at 250 pounds in his lean years. "Like
a moving couch covered in red plush," commented Rudolf Bing,
after witnessing his Tannhauser. Bing, caustic and
"cadaverously thin," was not one to appreciate Melchior's ego
or his size, and though the tenor's voice was still strong,
he refused to re-engage him during his first season as
general manager of the Metropolitan Opera in 1950-51.</p>
<p>"Tristanissimo" (the title comes from a sobriquet
superlative coined by Toscanini; another nickname was "Big
Noise") is as much a biography of the Danish tenor as it is a
history of changing opera traditions. Melchior was the
helmeted ornament of an era in which singers reigned supreme
and traveled with their favorite costumes and staging
notions. With Bing "Production Values had arrived . . . and
with them, the world of the director," writes Ms. Emmons.</p>
<p>All Melchior asked in the way of a production was a table
that didn't collapse when he jumped on it to reach for the
sword in "Die Walkure." Mostly he was content to repeat the
gestures he had learned at Bayreuth, where he debuted in 1924
when Wagner's antique widow, Cosima, was still running the
shrine by remote control, conveying what she insisted were
the master's wishes to son Siegfried, who would then scurry
from her darkened box to the stage.</p>
<p>Expressive eye movements executed in accordance with the
Cosima codex were a major part of the Bayreuth style, writes
Ms. Emmons: "(1) lids covering a major portion of the eyes,
which gazed onto the stage floor about five yards in front of
the performer; (2) eyes exposed normally, with the gaze
raised to eye level; and (3) eyelids drawn up as the eyes
widened in an expression of recognition, longing, or
fatigue." Unfortunately, critics insensitive to the master's
widow's wishes, often thought Melchior was just too lazy to
move.</p>
<p>Big Noise stopped singing in Bayreuth in 1931 after the
widow died and Hitler became a favorite guest.
"Tristanissimo" is particularly interesting in its
descriptions of private lives impacted by politics and
finally war. At Covent Garden, Lotte Lehmann, a favorite
colleague and usually a cool cucumber, suddenly threw her
hands up in the middle of the first act of "Der
Rosenkavalier" saying, "I cannot go on." Her stepchildren
were at that moment illegally crossing the Austrian border.</p>
<p>Germany's loss was America's gain. Melchior's career
boomed in the States, so much so that Kirsten Flagstad feuded
with him over first place. Kirsten, he would say, "the opera
is called `Tristan and Isolde' not `Tristan or Isolde.'"</p>
<p>Melchior owed his immense popularity in no small part to
the constant efforts of his pretty, pushy second wife,
Kleinchen (Little One), and Constance Hope, a pioneer in
personal publicity. Years before Kathleen Battle plugged
Japanese Scotch for vast sums, Melchior cheerfully hustled
cigarettes. "I favor Lucky Strike for the sake of my throat,"
the cigar smoker declared for $7,000. Years before Luciano
Pavarotti bombed in Hollywood, Melchior made several silly
MGM movies -- which further disgusted Bing.</p>
<p>No more serious offstage, the tenor sometimes entertained
luncheon guests wearing pajamas picked up in a store for the
full-figured woman -- or nothing at all. Cover up, darling,
Kleinchen would giggle, tossing a napkin. Such vignettes do
enliven a text. Now a voice teacher who sang with Big Noise
on his variety show in the 1950s, Ms. Emmons had access not
only to vast archives of Melchioriana (including diaries and
scrapbooks), but to the two appallingly mistreated children
from his first marriage. Ib and Birte pop up frequently in
the text, taking great pains to be fair, though the partly
Jewish daughter was left to fend for herself in Nazi-occupied
Denmark during the war and the son was blackballed at several
jobs by his stepmother. Only after Kleinchen's death did
Melchior finally repair his family ties.</p>
<p>He never lost his appetite for fun and food. In a charming
foreword, Birgit Nilsson describes meeting Big Noise when he
was long retired from the Met, where she herself had sailed
into legend as Isolde in 1959. "What a wonderful couple we
would have made," he sighed, tucking her under an arm pit and
dragging her off to a groaning smorgasbord augmented by vast
quantities of pumpernickel bread slathered with goose fat and
peppered onion slices.</p>
