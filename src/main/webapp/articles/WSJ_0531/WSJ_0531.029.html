	<p class="article-leader">Central Bancorp., Wenatchee, Wash., said its board
rejected an unsolicited cash offer of $12.30 a share from
another financial institution and will go ahead instead with
a repurchase stock plan. A company spokesman declined to name
the rejected bidder.
   Central Bancorp., the parent company of Central Washington
Bank with $105 million in assets, said it will purchase up to
150,000 shares of company stock at $10 a share. The plan was
recently approved by federal bank regulatory authorities.
Central Bancorp. expects to start purchasing the shares
within a few weeks.</p>
