	<p class="article-leader">This is in regard to Jose de Cordoba's April 19 article
recalling his trip to Cuba.
   It may be true that you do not see children begging in
Havana or "misery belts" surrounding the city. Other things
that you do not see in Havana are freedom and prosperity. You
do not see the small business. Or the corner newsstand where
people drink a cup of coffee and enjoy a political
discussion. Or the middle-class neighborhoods where families
live and enjoy watching their uncensored TV programs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>By Mr. de Cordoba's standard, most cities in the world
wouldn't compare favorably with Havana. Yet we do not see
Haitians rowing their rafts to Cuba. But we do see Cubans
rowing to Miami.</p>
<p>One thing you do see in Havana, and not in other Latin
American capitals, are hotels and restaurants for the
exclusive use of tourists. There is no other country that
excludes its citizens, and its currency, from tourists'
resorts. Newlyweds cannot spend their honeymoon in the better
Cuban resorts. A Cuban cannot take his family out to dinner
at one of these exclusive restaurants. This is the way life
is in the "socialist paradise" of Cuba.</p>
<p>Something puzzles me. Journalists who visit Cuba always
speak of the free health care enjoyed by Cubans. On the other
hand, our relatives in Cuba are always requesting medicine in
their letters. The answer is that Fidel Castro has been
better at building hospitals than providing medicine.
Furthermore, he has done all of this by turning Cuba into one
of the world's indebted nations. His legacy will be political
prisons and a massive foreign debt.</p>
<p>When Mr. Castro moves from the political scene, and Cuba's
doors are finally opened to the world, we will learn the
truth of Cuba. As with Romania and the other East European
countries, we will learn about the corruption, the faulty
health care, the ecology crisis and the people's discontent.</p>
<p>Communism has been far better at impressing U.S.
journalists and academicians than at gaining the acceptance
of local citizens. We saw this in Eastern Europe. And we will
soon see what Cubans have known for 30 years: The venerated
Mr. Castro and his socialist paradise have been a big fraud.</p>
