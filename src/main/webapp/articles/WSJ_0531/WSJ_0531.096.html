	<p class="article-leader">MINNETONKA, Minn. -- Tonka Corp. said it expects to post a
"significant" second-quarter loss because of lower sales and
that it might post a loss for the full year as well.
   The toy maker said sales of some fad toy lines have been
lower than expected, failing to take up the slack from the
company's popular Real Ghostbusters line, which is petering
out after three strong years of sales.</p>

been discontinued.</p>
<p>Tonka said it now is doubtful that its revenue will exceed
last year's $870.5 million, and that the company is in talks
with its banks to relax some debt covenants that the company
could be in violation of. "We are clearly disappointed by the
current outlook," Stephen G. Shank, chairman and chief
executive officer, said, "and are examining every option to
improve performance for the balance of the year."</p>
<p>A spokeswoman attributed the sales decline to a series of
relatively small disappointments in the fad toy line, which
promotes toys tied to movies and other phenomena through
Tonka's Kenner Products unit. Tonka wouldn't identify the
items not selling well, she said, for fear that sales would
be further hurt by identifying the lines as slow sellers.</p>
<p>In the year-earlier second quarter, Tonka had profit of
$100,000, or two cents a share, on sales of $189.4 million.
Tonka wouldn't project results for the current quarter.</p>
<p>For all of 1989, Tonka had profit of $5.7 million, or 67
cents a share, after a $2 million charge.</p>
<p>Tonka expects a profitable second half for 1990, but now
isn't sure whether that will be enough to offset the
first-half loss. For this year's first quarter, Tonka had a
$10.3 million loss, or 71 cents a share, on revenue of $135.9
million.</p>
<p>International sales and sales of Parker Brothers games are
above last year's levels, Tonka said. In addition to the fad
lines, sales in the Tonka Products division, which makes toy
trucks, Play-doh and other general items, are off.</p>
