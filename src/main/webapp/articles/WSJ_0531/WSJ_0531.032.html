	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Wendy's International Inc. said its
restaurants are running better, its revamped menu is selling
better and its outlook is more optimistic than many analysts
think.
   Wendy's President and Chief Executive Officer James W.
Near said that analysts' second-quarter operating earnings
estimates of eight to 10 cents a share are "low" and that the
company will do "much better" in all of 1990 than last year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>April sales were very strong, Mr. Near said; the trend
seemed to continue into May.</p>
<p>Rumors have circulated that Wendy's may be a candidate for
takeover-rumors that the company won't address.</p>
<p>Today, Shearson Lehman Hutton raised its earnings estimate
to 35 cents a share for 1990, rating Wendy's as likely to
outperform the market by 10 to 20 percentage points.</p>
<p>The fast-food industry is emerging from a period of
discounting that swallowed profits as restaurants offered
coupons and other inducements to diners. Wendy's problems
were compounded by financial difficulties at some franchises.</p>
<p>Mr. Near says Wendy's expanded too rapidly through the
early and mid-1980s, selling franchises to owners who wanted
the investment and not the work. The company has been atoning
for those errors by buying back ailing franchises.</p>
<p>While the company was able to show improved net income for
1989, thanks to a five cent-a-share gain from an accounting
change and a two cent gain from early extinguishment of debt,
operating results eroded from 1988. Wendy's net from
operations last year was $23.7 million, or 25 cents a share,
down from $28.5 million, or 30 cents a share, in 1988.
Revenue increased slightly to $1.07 billion, from $1.06
billion in 1988.</p>
<p>Wendy's revenue fell in the first quarter of 1990 to
$241.3 million, from $259.5 million a year ago. Operating
profit increased to $3 million, from $814,000 in the 1989
first quarter. The 1990 quarter included a $499,000, or
one-cent-a-share, gain on extinguishment of debt for net
income of $3.5 million, or four cents a share. The 1989
quarter included $339,000 from extinguishment of debt and
$5.2 million, or six cents a share, from an accounting
adjustment for net income of $6.3 million, or seven cents a
share.</p>
