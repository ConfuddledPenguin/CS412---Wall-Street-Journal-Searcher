	<p class="article-leader">WARSAW -- Poland's state-run railroad, recently hit by a
crippling weeklong strike, will double passenger fares on
Friday, the official PAP news agency reported.
   The fare increases, which were planned before the labor
strike, result from higher fuel and other operating costs and
the cut in state subsidies under the new government's
economic overhaul program, a railway official told PAP.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The railroad had used government subsidies to keep fares
unrealistically low.</p>
<p>For example, a first-class ticket for the three-hour
express train ride from Warsaw to Gdansk cost about three
dollars before the increases, and even less before the
inflation surge of the second half of 1989.</p>
<p>Wildcat strikers snarled freight and passenger service to
northwest Poland from May 20 until Monday, when Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa persuaded the workers to return to their
jobs and give the government until June 13 to consider their
demands.</p>
<p>The government, not veering from its anti-inflation
economic overhaul plan, had refused to consider pay raises
for the workers while the strike was on.</p>
<p>However, officials said a plan, including new pay scales,
was being drafted to restructure the railroad for Poland's
post-Communist, market-driven economy.</p>
