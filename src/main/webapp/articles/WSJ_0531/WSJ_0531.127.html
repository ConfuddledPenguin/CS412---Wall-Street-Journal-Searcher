	<p class="article-leader">TCBY Enterprises Inc., Little Rock, Ark., said it expects
to report earnings of 35 cents to 40 cents a share for the
fiscal second quarter, ending today, up from 33 cents a share
in the year-ago period.
   However, the frozen-yogurt retailer, whose stock has been
something of a highflier on Wall Street, said it expects
sales at stores open more than a year will be down for the
quarter because of poor weather during April and May.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company's stock, which had climbed as high as $23 two
weeks ago, dropped 75 cents to close at $18 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading yesterday, on unusually heavy
volume of more than 1.5 million shares.</p>
<p>TCBY had net income of $8.9 million on sales of $41.7
million for the second quarter last year.</p>
