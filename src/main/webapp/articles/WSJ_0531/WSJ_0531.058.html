	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Trade statistics issued by the Japan Trade
Council, a group of major trading houses, show that Japan's
imports will continue to climb sharply because of strong
domestic demand.
   Import contracts signed in April by 18 leading trading
companies surged a record 65% from a year earlier to 1.359
trillion yen ($9 billion), the council said. This followed a
54% jump in import contracts concluded in the previous month.
The statistics indicate that imports will continue to
register sharp gains in the coming months, helping reduce
Japan's trade surplus.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The trade gap has been dwindling steadily as the pace of
import growth has exceeded export gains, because of vigorous
domestic demand such as corporate investment in plant and
equipment that has been fueling sustained economic growth in
Japan. Export contracts signed in April totaled 849.7 billion
yen, a 20% increase from a year earlier.</p>
<p>The council's report, based on contract data provided by
the trading companies, is considered to be a short-term
indicator of overall trade trends. The 18 trading houses
handle about half of Japan's overall exports and two-thirds
of imports.</p>
