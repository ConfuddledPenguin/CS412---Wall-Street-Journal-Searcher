	<p class="article-leader">The first garbage-burning plant in Hempstead, N.Y., was a
disaster. It rarely worked, and when it did, it smelled like
rotten eggs. Its chimney spewed soot, heavy metals and
dioxin. Neighborhood groups, fearing for children's safety,
picketed the plant. After it closed in 1980, they protested
to stop it from reopening.
   But Hempstead's garbage crisis only got worse. The Long
Island community's 740,000 residents continued to generate
mountains of trash. The first of its two local landfills
closed in 1984, the second in 1988. Then the
"not-in-my-backyard" activists became realists. If an
incinerator plant was inevitable, they would fight for the
cleanest one they could get.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Their campaign seems to have succeeded. Since last year,
Hempstead has had a new, high-tech incinerator that is
considered among the cleanest and safest anywhere. State
regulators, who issued a final operating permit this month,
conclude that it poses no health threat. And town officials
say the plant will save $49 million a year, consuming all of
the community's trash at half the cost of hauling it to
distant landfills.</p>
<p>The Hempstead project could become a model for a national
incinerator program. Experts say it demonstrates how an
improved plant design and responsiveness to community
concerns could help resolve the national deadlock over trash
disposal. "These technologies have demonstrated they protect
the public health and are much more benign than landfills,"
says William Rosenberg, Environmental Protection Agency
assistant administrator.</p>
<p>The $360 million waste-to-energy facility is operated by
American Ref-Fuel, a joint venture of Air Products &
Chemicals Inc. and Browning-Ferris Industries. American
Ref-Fuel is among six major participants in an industry that
is growing rapidly as landfill capacity diminishes.</p>
<p>The potential for burning trash is tremendous. By 1994,
the EPA estimates that incinerator plants will consume 15% to
20% of the nation's municipal waste. To help meet that need,
52 plants are under construction or approved to join the list
of 166 already operating. Capacity could double to more than
200,000 tons a day by the year 2000, says analyst Richard J.
Sweetnam Jr. of Kidder, Peabody & Co.</p>
<p>But growth isn't guaranteed. Some incinerator projects are
being delayed or canceled as more cities view recycling as a
safer and cheaper alternative to burning waste. Among the
concerns is incinerator ash, which represents about 10% of
the volume of waste. Ash is laden with toxic heavy metals and
dioxin and must be deposited in special landfills.</p>
<p>Seattle, for example, decided to increase its recycling
rate to 60% by 1998, from 36% currently, after the city found
such an approach would be cheaper than dumping most waste in
landfills or building an incinerator. "The public was very
concerned that an incinerator would be a disincentive for
recycling," says Lorie Parker of the Seattle Solid Waste
Utility.</p>
<p>Similarly, Los Angeles and Philadelphia canceled
incinerators because of public opposition, while New Jersey,
Massachusetts and New York City have delayed new projects in
hopes of promoting recycling. Isolated pollution problems
continue to fan public fears. Detroit's new incinerator was
shut down temporarily in April for exceeding mercury emission
limits. The facility agreed to screen garbage to remove
mercury-laden "button" batteries and install better pollution
controls.</p>
<p>American Ref-Fuel's plant in Hempstead is among a new
generation of incinerators that is improving the outlook for
an industry damaged by plant failures in the late 1970s. The
plant relies on "mass burn" technology, widely used in Europe
and Japan for 25 years, which is cleaner burning and more
dependable than early refuse-derived fuel plants.</p>
<p>Waste is fed into the furnace on rolling drums known as
grates. Computers monitoring temperature and pollutants
automatically adjust the speed of the grates and the air
mixture to maximize combustion. Next, a "scrubber" injects
lime into the flue gas to neutralize acid rain components.
Finally, a "baghouse" containing more than 1,000 vacuum
cleaner-like bags captures ash particles. The ash is trucked
to a landfill near Buffalo at $140 a ton. Federal officials
say such pollution controls should meet strict national
standards, proposed for adoption later this year, that would
require 85% to 99% reductions of key pollutants. They expect
these tough safety standards to diminish opposition to
incinerators.</p>
<p>Tests show the Hempstead technology works. Plant emissions
were far below state standards for 16 chemical pollutants
sampled over three weeks. Dioxin, a suspected carcinogen, and
particulates, which include most toxic metals, were at least
five times lower than proposed federal standards. "These
results are the lowest I've seen in New York state. We are
very impressed," says Harold D. Berger, regional director of
the state Department of Environmental Conservation. The state
Health Department concluded that the cancer risk was less
than one in one million, which it says is about the risk of
being hit by a train. The plant would require minor
modifications to comply with proposed limits for gases
causing acid rain.</p>
<p>But some environmentalists complain that annual testing
for dioxin and particulates isn't frequent enough. Theodore
D. Goldfarb, a chemistry professor at State University of New
York at Stony Brook and member of the town's solid waste
advisory committee, worries that recent results may reflect
ideal conditions. "You need a lot more test results over a
longer period of time to get an accurate picture of the
plant's emissions," Mr. Goldfarb says.</p>
<p>Town officials say the plant has exceeded their
expectations. Since it began commercial operation in October,
the plant has been running at its 2,250 tons-per-day capacity
97% of the time. The town's waste disposal fees have dropped
to $79 a ton, from $160 a ton.</p>
<p>Burning garbage is also a good deal for its owners. Air
Products estimates the plant will earn $3 million to $6
million this year, with profits rising steadily to $12
million to $15 million by 1995. Like other new plants,
roughly half of its revenue comes from its steam turbine,
which generates enough electric power for 60,000 homes.</p>
<p>The Hempstead project also has been helped by a
sophisticated community relations program to calm fears and
counter negative perceptions of the previous plant. In 1986,
when the state was going to allow American Ref-Fuel to build
a new incinerator, neighborhood groups mobilized. They
demanded American Ref-Fuel install the "baghouse" filter and
build its stack 384 feet high instead of only 284.</p>
<p>At various stages, the plant sent four newsletters to each
of the town's 250,000 households. Plant officials meet
monthly with local activists and make available plant
emissions records. A 24-hour hot line was installed after
neighbors complained they couldn't reach anyone to inquire
about a dark plume that appeared one Sunday. State officials
say the plume was caused by a baghouse malfunction that has
since been corrected.</p>
<p>Activist Shelley Lotenberg, who lives a half-mile away,
says the plant is now "as safe as we can make it." But there
is continuing concern about potential hazards in the waste
stream. For example, neighborhood groups forced the plant to
reject hospital waste and are pushing the town to recycle
plastic and compost yard waste. Mrs. Lotenberg complains that
recycling efforts are limited in Hempstead now because
three-fourths of the town's waste is contracted to the plant.
Proposed federal regulations would require the town to
recycle 25% of waste, up from 13% today, and collect
batteries to further reduce toxic metal emissions.</p>
<p>American Ref-Fuel officials say the plant, their first in
operation, is their best selling tool. The firm is building
incinerators in Newark, N.J., and Preston, Conn., and has
been selected to build plants in Bergen County, N.J., and
Oyster Bay, N.Y.</p>
