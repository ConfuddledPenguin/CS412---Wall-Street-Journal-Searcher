	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- The Ministry of International Trade and Industry
officially approved a standard for digital audio tape players
Wednesday, clearing the way for Japanese makers to produce
machines for the mass market.
   A year ago, the major hardware makers from Japan and
Europe agreed on a standard for the equipment, but they had
to seek clearance from their governments. DAT machines
reproduce sound more clearly and accurately than conventional
tapes.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Spokesmen from Sony Corp. and Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co., which makes Panasonic equipment, said the
companies will probably start selling machines in the U.S.
later this year.</p>
<p>It still isn't clear, however, whether record companies
will produce the necessary software for the machines. Many
record companies have expressed concern that the DAT machines
will encourage greater private copying in violation of
copyright rules. The standard is supposed to discourage such
behavior by limiting the ability of the tapes to copy from
compact disks.</p>
<p>Some Japanese companies displayed DAT machines at the Las
Vegas, Nev., consumer electronics show earlier this year, but
those were only prototypes, a ministry official said. More
companies will probably display such machines at the
electronics show in Chicago, which opens Saturday.</p>
