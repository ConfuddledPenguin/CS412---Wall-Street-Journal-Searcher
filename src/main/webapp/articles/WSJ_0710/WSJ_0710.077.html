	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- General Instrument Corp. said a potential
bidder has emerged that may be interested in topping a $1.42
billion, $44.50-a-share bid for the company by Forstmann,
Little & Co.
   The cable TV equipment maker said an unnamed "financial
entity" has expressed interest in obtaining information about
the company and evaluating a possible transaction. But it
said there aren't any negotiations under way.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In response to the disclosure, General Instrument stock
rose 62.5 cents to $46.25 a share in composite trading on the
New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Although the stock is trading well above the Forstmann
Little offer, some takeover stock traders are skeptical that
a higher bid will emerge. These traders and some investment
bankers say the company had already been offered informally
for sale during the past year without attracting any other
bids.</p>
<p>Documents filed with Forstmann Little's offer said
Forstmann's advisers, Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Lazard Freres
& Co., will share a fee of $8 million if the purchase is
completed. General Instrument's adviser, Merrill Lynch & Co.,
stands to receive a fee of roughly $8 million based on the
current offer and more if shareholders receive a higher
price.</p>
