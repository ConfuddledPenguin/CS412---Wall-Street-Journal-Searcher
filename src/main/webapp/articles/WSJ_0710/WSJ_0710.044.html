	<p class="article-leader">No ballet is as carefully choreographed as an economic
summit like the present chat in Houston. In the clubby world
of international finance, you can dine out the rest of your
career after being a "sherpa," one of the aides who decide in
advance what the industrial world's heads of government get
to talk about. So there's not much point proposing any new
subject for Houston along with agricultural subsidies, aid to
the Soviet Union and the rest.
   There is a broader and more philosophical issue, though,
that the presidents and prime ministers might set the sherpas
working on for some future meeting. Quite simply, what's gone
wrong with economic growth throughout the world?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>President Bush, Chancellor Kohl, Prime Minster Kaifu and
the rest preside at a most hopeful moment. There is peace, by
world standards, with the threat of war receding. The great
inflations of the 1970s have been subdued. The technological
possibilities are stupendous, promising a new industrial
revolution. And yet, growth is grudging at best. Despite
passing bright spots, the world has not been able to recover
the growth rates it enjoyed from the end of World War II
until 1973.</p>
<p>This was brilliantly documented by Angus Maddison in an
impressive study for the OECD, "The World Economy in the 20th
Century." He compared average compound growth rates between
1950 and 1973 with growth rates between 1973 and 1987. U.S.
growth fell to 2.5% from 3.7%. But Japanese growth fell to
3.7% from 9.3%. In 16 OECD countries it fell to 2.4% from
4.9%.</p>
<p>Similar declines were recorded throughout the world: in
Latin America, the Middle East, the Soviet Union, Eastern
Europe. Asia, aside from Japan, was the sole exception, and
may have joined the crowd with the evident economic plunge in
China after the events of 1989. In some regions, growth in
the 1973-1987 period fell behind the increase in population,
so that GDP per capita actually declined -- by 0.3% a year in
Latin America, 0.8% in the Middle East and 0.9% in Africa.</p>
<p>The question the sherpas ought to study, in short, is
"Whatever happened in 1973?"</p>
<p>Everyone remembers that 1973 was the year of the Arab oil
embargo and sudden increases in energy costs. As Prof.
Maddison says, "The suddenness of the slowdown points up the
role of external shocks," the oil price explosion and the
Latin American debt crisis. But he sagely adds, "the shocks
are far from the whole story."</p>
<p>He identifies two more reasons for the slowdown. One is a
change in growth potential, since the pre-1973 period
includes recovery from World War II. Against the growth rates
of 1900 to 1950, what looks unusual is not the slow growth
after 1973 but the rapid growth in 1950-1973.</p>
<p>Prof. Maddison's third reason for the post 1973 slowdown
was the collapse of the Bretton Woods exchange-rate system.
"This removed the monetary pillar of the postwar
international order," he writes. "Henceforth there was a
non-system," with the U.S., U.K. and Japan favoring floating
exchange rates and Germany and France seeking "an island of
stability" with the European Monetary System.</p>
<p>My argument is that the final collapse of Bretton Woods
was the decisive event of 1973. With the technological
opportunities before us, the world economy should not be
satisfied with the growth rates of 1900-1950, a period that
included two world wars and the Great Depression. The oil
shocks were dramatic and painful, and no doubt amplified the
basic problem. But they were only an artifact of the
underlying monetary disorder.</p>
<p>The collapse of Bretton Woods was a gradual process,
measured by the dissolution of the London gold pool in March
1968, the closing of the U.S. gold window in August 1971 and
finally the advent of generalized floating rates in March
1973, a few months before the Arab oil embargo. To strip away
the caveats, the breakup of Bretton Woods caused the oil
crisis. Many observers will find this an extraordinary
assertion; what is the evidence for it? For one thing, OPEC
told us so, and in advance.</p>
<p>Five weeks after the closing of the gold window, the OPEC
conference convened an extraordinary meeting in Beirut and
issued Resolution XXV.140:</p>
<p>The Conference, having considered the report of the
Secretary General concerning the recent international
monetary developments and their adverse effect on the
purchasing power of the oil revenue of Member Countries;
noting that these developments have resulted in a de facto
devaluation of the United States dollar, the currency in
which posted prices are established, vis-a-vis the currencies
of the major industrialized countries; recalling Resolution
XXI.122 which calls, inter alia, for adjustment in posted or
tax-reference prices so as to offset any adverse effect
resulting from de facto or de jure changes in the parity of
monies of major industrialized countries; resolves 1. that
Member Countries shall take necessary action and/or shall
establish negotiations, individually or in groups, with the
oil companies with a view to adopting ways and means to
offset any adverse effects on the per barrel real income of
Member Countries resulting from the international monetary
developments as of 15th August, 1971. 2. that the results of
negotiations shall be submitted to the next Conference. In
case such negotiations fail to achieve their purpose, the
Conference shall determine such action as necessary for the
implementation of this Resolution.</p>
<p>At this same meeting, the OPEC nations moved to take
direct interests in the oil concessions previously owned by
foreign companies. In reporting these actions at the time,
this newspaper remarked: "Several oil sources said they
regard the new OPEC demands as breaking the agreements signed
last spring, which supposedly fixed financial terms on
foreign oil production for the next five years. At the time,
the oil companies had hailed the agreements as guaranteeing a
semblance of stability in oil prices to consumers despite the
agreed increases." As events unfolded, the OPEC resolution's
"such action as necessary" became known as the "energy
crisis."</p>
<p>For perspective on this issue, though, I once asked the
helpful folks at Cyrus J. Lawrence to program up the price of
oil in terms of gold. At the historic price of $35 gold and
$2.75 oil, an ounce of gold bought 12.73 barrels of oil. This
ratio prevailed so long as the London Gold pool lasted. In
1969, the price of gold started to creep up, and an ounce of
gold would command 13 barrels of oil. In 1972, it would buy
16 barrels of oil. By the eve of the Arab oil embargo in
1973, an ounce of gold commanded 26 barrels of oil. After the
embargo, in the first half of 1974, an ounce of gold was
worth 12.76 barrels of oil.</p>
<p>Only for a brief period -- from mid-1975 to the end of
1977 -- did OPEC push up the price of oil fast enough to
improve its value in gold. The oil/gold ratio touched 8.84
barrels an ounce in the second half of 1976. By 1986, with
the collapse of the cartel, an ounce of gold was worth 33
barrels of oil.</p>
<p>Readers can attach their own caveats to this, but surely
it suggests that the sudden emergence of OPEC was not the
driving force in the post-1973 economy. There was no gold
cartel, yet by and large the nominal prices of gold and oil
moved in tandem. While the parallel movement was not perfect,
it certainly does not look like a coincidence. There must
have been some more fundamental underlying force.</p>
<p>This force was the explosion of international monetary
reserves during and after the collapse of Bretton Woods. This
is not well understood by economists thinking in terms of
closed national economies, but was quickly understood by
international economists, who see the world as one integrated
system. Prof. Robert Triffin, for example, linked
international reserves and the oil crisis as early as 1975.
In papers delivered that year at the American Enterprise
Institute and elsewhere, he wrote that international reserves
increased by 168% from January 1, 1970, through Sept. 30,
1974. He added:</p>
<p>"This fantastic expansion well preceded the oil price
explosion of the fall of 1973 and fueled the world-wide
inflation of which oil prices are only one -- and not the
major -- of the components. World reserves had already more
than doubled over the years 1970, 1971 and 1972, increasing
in this short span of three years by more than in all
previous years and centuries since Adam and Eve. If such a
process were not arrested -- and it has not been so far -- it
would continue to fuel world inflation even if the energy
problem could be solved tomorrow."</p>
<p>Similarly, another great international economist, Prof.
Robert Mundell, wrote in this newspaper on Jan. 31, 1983,
which also happened to be the inaugural issue of The Wall
Street Journal/Europe:</p>
<p>"The oil price increases of the 1970s would not have been
possible without the accompanying rise in the price of gold
(hence gold reserves) and foreign exchange holdings. After
the price of oil was raised industrial countries and the LDCs
faced the prospect of deficits which would have meant either
deflation or depreciation of their currencies against the
dollar, had the U.S. not provided the reserves upon which the
Eurodollar market could expand to finance the oil deficits in
the great lending spree of 1973-81."</p>
<p>The reserve explosion continued because generalized
floating rates lacked any external discipline, Prof. Mundell
added. In one month of 1982, more international liquidity was
added than in all the years prior to the 1971 closing of the
gold window. "Balance-of-payments discipline under a fixed
exchange rate system was replaced eventually by the barrier
of fiscal discipline, reached after a once-for-all explosion
of lending exhausted government credit."</p>
<p>Ultimately, an impending collapse led to the appointment
of Paul Volcker as Federal Reserve chairman in 1979.
Inflation was wrung out of the system at great cost,
especially to developing nations still straining under a debt
load assumed when both borrower and lender assumed further
rapid erosion of the dollar. A world recession seemed
imminent, but was averted with recovery starting in the U.S.
in 1983, which was also the year of the first effective rate
reductions under the Reagan tax program. We are nonetheless
left with inflation above Bretton Woods norms, and the
slowdown in secular growth documented by Prof. Maddison.</p>
<p>Precisely how would the collapse of Bretton Woods slow
growth? First and most obvious, the inflationary experience
of 1973-1980 and its subsequent correction would be no
economists' prescription for growth. Also, the floating-rate
regime with free capital movement, Prof. Maddison comments,
forced government policy makers to become more cautious:
"Full employment was no longer an objective of policy,
economic growth had become a secondary goal. The top
priorities were to stop inflation and avoid payments
deficits." (In this new orthodoxy, he adds, "The United
States has been an important deviant, with policy action
which has been a quixotic version of the old Keynesian
mode.")</p>
<p>I would submit, though, that there is an even more
fundamental reason why the present international monetary
regime retards world growth from its potential. To unite the
themes I have been striking, in a one-world economy,
exchange-rate movements thwart Adam Smith's invisible hand.</p>
<p>All of Adam Smith's great perceptions depend on accurate
transmission of prices. The division of labor, for example,
depends on the trade-off between the product of one man's
labor and the product of another's. To achieve an efficient
result, however, their output has to be measured by the
yardstick of common prices. If there are two yardsticks, and
their lengths keep changing, labor will not flow to its best
use.</p>
<p>We once imagined that floating exchange rates would merely
iron out differences in inflation and other extraneous
influences, and allow the accurate transmission of real
prices throughout an integrated world economy. But that has
not been our experience.</p>
<p>Between the middle of 1985 and the end of 1987, both the
yen and the mark doubled in value against the dollar: in
round terms, from 240 yen to 120 and from three marks to 1.5.
This was, of course, without a hyperinflation or depression
in the American economy. There is simply nothing in the
economic fundamentals to explain a 100% change in 2 1/2
years. The same can be said of exchange-rate volatility
measured on a monthly or even daily basis.</p>
<p>What's more, exchange rates obviously overshoot purchasing
power parity in both directions. Purchasing power parity,
when exchange rates do not affect the buying power of a given
amount of money, is presumably an indicator of long-run
equilibrium. The 1989 estimate of PPP by Prof. Ron McKinnon,
the leading proponent of the idea, is 1.9 to 2.1 marks and
155 to 175 yen. At the time of the Plaza meeting in September
1985, the dollar was obviously overvalued against PPP; in
most of 1988 it was undervalued. This produces disequilibrium
in the various economies, for example pressure toward
inflation and deflation through the international arbitrage
of goods.</p>
<p>From the point of view of the individual firm, such swings
are certain to swamp the profit margins in cross-border
transactions. From a macroeconomic point of view, similarly,
they are going to swamp such concepts as the division of
labor, comparative advantage and Pareto optimality. That is,
they distort the exchange of goods and services, and destroy
the efficiencies Adam Smith saw in free exchange.</p>
<p>The pull of an integrated world economy is so powerful
that individual firms find it worthwhile to find ways around
the swings of exchange rates. They can, for example, set up
plants in each of the three major currency areas, and shift
production from one to another depending on exchange rates.
Politically, the seesaw adjustments implicit in this kind of
scheme are a breeding ground for protectionism among affected
suppliers, workers and communities. Economically, they are a
waste of capital and a drain on efficiency. The firms may
adjust, but the economy will produce sub-optimum growth of
the kind recorded in Prof. Maddision's numbers.</p>
<p>It should scarcely be a surprise, then, that the Bretton
Woods period goes down as a "golden era" in world economic
growth. Come to think of it, the previous golden era
apparently took place during the gold-standard years prior to
World War I. And today, with instant world-wide communication
and 24-hour financial markets, it is surely more disruptive
than ever to try to run one integrated economy with multiple
currencies.</p>
<p>This is not the place to discuss the economic
technicalities or political difficulties of constructing a
new international monetary order. But let me suggest a few
things:</p>
<p>A new fixed-rate regime, albeit with very wide bands, is
already implicit in the G-5 and G-7 agreements at the Plaza
and Louvre meetings; I regard it a major failing that the
U.S. refused to accept even the minimum financial discipline
of the Louvre parities, allowing the dollar to sink below
them. The evolution of the European Monetary System is
providing much valuable experience; perhaps Britain would
have found it easier to join a world-wide system than a
strictly European one. In the U.S. there is a budding
recognition that, whether or not a lower dollar helps the
balance of trade, it provides a bargain sale of U.S. assets.
And finally, if governments worry about the loss of
sovereignty, episodes like France's abandonment of the
Mitterrand economic policies or the U.S. abandonment of
"benign neglect" of the dollar leave one to wonder how much
sovereignty they have left to lose.</p>
<p>A great deal of progress, it seems to me, would result
from the adoption of one seemingly simple principle. The
objective of an international monetary order is not to
balance the flow of goods and services among different
regions of the world economy. It is not to liberate
politicians in individual regions from the disciplines of the
marketplace. Rather, the purpose of an international monetary
order is to provide accurate transmission of price signals
across arbitrary borders, to let Adam Smith's invisible hand
work throughout an increasingly integrated world economy.</p>
