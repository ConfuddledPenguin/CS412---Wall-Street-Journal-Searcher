	<p class="article-leader">STAMFORD, Conn. -- General Signal Corp. said it agreed to
sell its Ultratech Stepper unit to an employee group in a
cash and paper transaction in which it will retain a minority
interest. Precise terms weren't disclosed.
   General Signal, a maker of process controls, electrical
equipment and semiconductors, said Ultratech Stepper
accounted for about $40 million of its 1989 sales of $1.92
billion. A stepper is a photolithography tool used to put
circuit designs on semiconductors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>C. Woodrow Rea, a general partner in New Enterprise
Associates, a San Francisco-based venture capital firm and a
former president of Ultratech, heads the employee group.
Under the pact, General Signal will provide "significant
financing."</p>
<p>General Signal had planned to combine Ultratech, based in
San Francisco, with General Signal's GCA Stepper unit, which
has about twice the sales of Ultratech. The agreement to sell
Ultratech, with about 300 employees, "was a more attractive
alternative to the risks associated" with the merger plan, a
General Signal official said.</p>
<p>The transaction will allow General Signal "to focus its
research and marketing efforts" on the world-wide market for
GCA Stepper's technology.</p>
