	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo stocks rose on index-linked buying, but volume
remained slack as investor interest continued to flow into
the smaller markets, traders said.
   In London, stocks ended cautious, quiet trading modestly
softer, as limited buying interest is proving highly
selective.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Although profit-taking checked gains in Tokyo throughout
the day, traders noted that the inability by arbitragers to
support strong index-linked buying was more the reason that
the Nikkei Index closed off its intraday high of 32608
points. The index of 225 issues gained 93.16 points to
32538.28.</p>
<p>In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the Nikkei index fell
75.67 points to 32462.61.</p>
<p>Monday's volume on the first section was estimated at 400
million shares, down from 462.1 million shares Friday.
Decliners narrowly outnumbered winning issues 476 to 469,
while 178 issues were unchanged.</p>
<p>Program buying was tied mostly to the Nikkei Index, while
the Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the first
section reflected the more general market softness. The Topix
dropped 1.79 points, or 0.08%, to 2362.41.</p>
<p>The second section index surged 74.69 points, or 1.73%, to
4397.72. The section's volume was estimated at 45.8 million
shares, down from 48.6 million shares Friday.</p>
<p>Traders said that the market hasn't yet been aroused by
the economic summit of the Group of Seven industrialized
nations in Houston, not anticipating a change in the global
interest rate situation will result.</p>
<p>"I don't expect anything revolutionary" out of the summit
to affect foreign-exchange rates, one trader at a top
domestic securities firm said. He added that the current
macroeconomic scenario provides "no real reason to buy the
yen right now."</p>
<p>Until news lures aggressive buying on the yen, pulling the
dollar below 147 yen, institutional investors are seen
unlikely to return to the broad market, noted the chief
trader at a U.K. securities firm in Tokyo.</p>
<p>As the first section is being "artificially" manipulated
by program trading, he said, light selling should continue
while institutional buying interest continues to enter the
smaller markets, particularly the Tokyo Stock Exchange second
section, over-the-counter and Osaka trading.</p>
<p>"Unless it's small, regional, cheap or heavily
foreign-oriented," the U.K. firm's trader said,
"institutional investors are unlikely to buy" any of the
first section stocks for some time.</p>
<p>Of interest yesterday was Mitsubishi Oil, which with
Mitsubishi Petroleum Development will purchase Merlin
Petroleum from Bond Corp. Holdings for $75 million, Bond
Corp. said.</p>
<p>The news sparked initial buying in Mitsubishi Oil, but
support later faltered for the entire oil sector. The stock
closed flat at 1260 yen ($8.31).</p>
<p>Soft-drink can maker Toyo Seikan surged 200 yen to 4550
yen, as some speculators reasoned the hot, muggy summer
weather would induce the seasonal rise in beverage sales,
analysts said.</p>
<p>Retail shares were also higher, helped by news this past
week that retail prices continue to rise in Japan. Ito-Yokado
rose 30 yen to 4060 yen, Isetan gained 50 yen to 4500 yen,
Marui advanced 60 yen to 3330 yen, and Daiei gained 70 yen to
2070 yen.</p>
<p>Blue-chip shares Sony and TDK continued to attract value
buying, although both shares are expected to see a correction
soon, analysts said. Also helped by index-linked buying, Sony
was up 10 yen to 8810 yen, while TDK added 30 yen to 7360
yen.</p>
<p>Kyocera was hit by profit-taking after a long run of
advances, closing at 8900 yen, down 70 yen.</p>
<p>Also lower were steel, construction, mining and banking
shares.</p>
<p>In London, meanwhile, there were again several company
profit downgradings by equity analysts, adding to the growing
wariness among investors, who may be reluctant to trade ahead
of the U.K. June inflation report Friday.</p>
<p>A firm pound is encouraging for some segments of the
market, particularly those stocks with predominantly
U.K.-based earnings, but these same equities are being hit by
current high interest rates, dealers noted.</p>
<p>The resulting mixed picture has sidelined some investors,
although one dealer noted that there is still a surprising
amount of liquidity in the market, albeit in a very selective
fashion.</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index ended
2.5 points lower, at 2337.5. The Financial Times 30 Share
Index fell 5.7 points to 1859.3, while the September FT-SE
100 Index was quoted at 2403, off from Friday's close of
2412.</p>
<p>Volume was light, with 369.8 million shares changing
hands. Monday was the first day of a new two-week trading
account.</p>
<p>Highlights included Cadbury Schweppes's losing 6 pence to
end at 361 pence (11 cents to $6.44), on a weekend newspaper
report that the concern would bid for the confectionery
business of Switzerland's Suchard, following its recent
takeover by Philip Morris.</p>
<p>Although Cadbury denied the report, the market takes the
view it is still interested in mounting a bid, one dealer
said, adding, "This can't be good for its share price."</p>
<p>Glaxo gained 17 pence to 830 pence on strong buying by one
U.S. investor. However, the company was downgraded by a
handful of analysts, reflecting its exposure to dollar
earnings.</p>
<p>Thorn EMI shed 34 pence to end at 735 pence. Dealers said
21.5 pence of the fall was because of the share going
ex-dividend while the balance was ascribed to heavy selling
of the stock.</p>
<p>Construction concerns were also downgraded on the view
that they had had a good run in the previous quarter and were
ripe for profit-taking. Redland fell 4 pence to 604 pence.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, stocks closed higher in Zurich, Stockholm and
Madrid, lower in Paris and Frankfurt, mixed in Brussels and
Amsterdam, and unchanged in Milan. South African gold stocks
fell slightly.</p>
<p>Also, stocks ended higher in Sydney, Wellington, Taipei,
Manila, Hong Kong and Seoul and lower in Singapore.</p>
