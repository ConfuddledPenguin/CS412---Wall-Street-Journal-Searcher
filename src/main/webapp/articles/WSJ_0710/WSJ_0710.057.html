	<p class="article-leader">Rank Organisation PLC claimed control of 50.7% of the
ordinary shares of Mecca Leisure Group PLC, a rival British
entertainment concern.
   Rank's financial advisers, J. Henry Schroder Wagg & Co.,
said a Rank takeover offer had received acceptances from
Mecca shareholders representing 160 million Mecca shares.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Rank launched its bid June 1, offering 90.9 pence of its
own shares for each Mecca ordinary share. Though Mecca
initially rejected the offer, its board late last month
decided to recommend acceptance when it became clear Mecca
was unlikely to be able to carry out the asset sales needed
to reduce its crippling debt load.</p>
<p>The Rank bid, which values Mecca at #512 million ($914
million), needs regulatory approval. Together, the two firms
would hold large shares of the domestic bingo parlor and
resort-village market.</p>
