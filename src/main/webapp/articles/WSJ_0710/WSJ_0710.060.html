	<p class="article-leader">Strange statutes, puzzling regulations and no familiar
lawyer to call. Coping with foreign laws can be an
executive's nightmare.
   Stephen J. McGarry has a solution. Persuade 8,000 or so
reliable lawyers around the world to cooperate in handling
each other's clients. An unlikely prospect, except that Mr.
McGarry has already organized such a group, and somehow
persuaded prominent law firms from Paris to Pittsburgh to
sign up.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We represent about 1% of the lawyers on Earth," he
proclaims.</p>
<p>Mr. McGarry isn't touting some giant law firm, but a loose
affiliation of 105 dues-paying firms that have agreed to
share information and, when appropriate, refer clients to
fellow members. Known as Lex Mundi ("World Law" in Latin), it
is one of the most recent illustrations -- and by far the
largest -- of a major trend in the legal profession: the
banding together of firms to serve clients who want to
transact business in far-flung markets. With law-firm members
in 43 states and 49 other countries, Houston-based Lex Mundi
is aimed at the red-hot race for international legal
business.</p>
<p>"Competition is growing among law firms, so it's logical
to assume something like this would develop," says Jim Bunch,
managing partner of Davis, Graham & Stubbs, a Denver law firm
that doesn't belong to Lex Mundi.</p>
<p>Attorneys estimate that more than a dozen of these
confederations -- sometimes called networks -- exist, most of
them formed since 1980. Some are informal. Others, such as
Lex Mundi, are governed by a board and accept members on an
invitation-only basis. Some enlist only firms with a
speciality practice, such as high technology. Lex Mundi, a
nonprofit group formed in January 1989, is the first to try
spanning the globe.</p>
<p>Members say it's too soon to tell whether Lex Mundi will
aid their business, but some signs are encouraging. Howard R.
Majev, an attorney with Weinberg & Green in Baltimore, says
fellow-Lex Mundi members in Europe recently helped one of its
clients with financing for a European real estate project.
The client had trouble making contact with European bankers;
the European firms persuaded lenders they knew to meet with
the client.</p>
<p>And Billings, Mont., attorney Gareld F. Krieg says a Lex
Mundi firm in a Scandinavian country recently helped him
track down some much-needed information on an individual in
that region. "If I had tried to get that by just picking a
law firm name out of a directory, I don't know if I would
even have gotten an answer," says Mr. Krieg of Crowley,
Haughey, Hanson, Toole & Dietrich.</p>
<p>Mr. McGarry conceived of Lex Mundi five years ago while
working as an international lawyer for NL Industries Inc., a
Houston oil and chemical company. Struck by how few law firms
had reliable contacts outside their own region, he began
researching a wish-list of prominent firms, aiming to enlist
one from each state in the U.S. and from most countries. By
1987, he was making his pitch -- often to wary listeners.</p>
<p>"The first question I'd always get is: Who else is in the
organization?" recalls Mr. McGarry, 41 years old. "The answer
would be: `Nobody. Would you like to be the first?' "</p>
<p>Eventually, six firms from around the world agreed to
draft bylaws for the proposed organization. The rules bar
firms from advertising Lex Mundi membership or using it on
letterheads. That avoids conflict with various
bar-association rules; it also reduces the chance Lex Mundi
could be viewed as a law firm and sued for malpractice. On
the other hand, firms are free to tell clients about Lex
Mundi.</p>
<p>By early 1989, 82 firms had joined Lex Mundi, agreeing to
pay an initiation fee of $2,000, plus annual dues that range
from $1,100 for firms with fewer than 20 lawyers to $9,000
for those with more than 250. Mr. McGarry says he spent
$25,000 to $40,000 getting Lex Mundi started, but
subsequently was reimbursed.</p>
<p>As president, Mr. McGarry coordinates Lex Mundi from a
small Houston office he shares with a secretary. Each firm is
independent, but collaboration is the byword. Get-acquainted
member meetings are scheduled often (usually in conjunction
with other legal conventions, to save money).</p>
<p>Information sharing is particularly encouraged. Lex Mundi
computers hold resumes noting the specialties of the group's
8,500 attorneys. If one writes an article on, say, real
estate law, Mr. McGarry can quickly retrieve the names of
other Lex Mundi lawyers with similar interests. Lex Mundi
publications provide legal updates in Europe, the Pacific Rim
and Latin countries, covering everything from Bolivia's tax
system to securities regulation in Japan.</p>
<p>Some people still can't understand why prominent law firms
around the world bothered to listen to Mr. McGarry, an
obscure stranger to most of them. Several say he simply
spotted a niche in the marketplace, and made his pitch at the
right time -- when law firms were worrying about being left
behind in the race for international business.</p>
<p>Others offer another explanation. "He is a real
wheeler-dealer," says Allen L. Cleveland, a vice president in
the Houston office of Hildebrandt Inc., a legal consulting
firm.</p>
<p>Mr. McGarry does talk a good game. An example: "I've
always felt I could stick my finger in the yellow pages and
make a million dollars in three years."</p>
<p>Mr. McGarry hasn't sold everyone on Lex Mundi. One law
firm already has dropped its membership, he acknowledges. The
firm said it was a waste of time and money; Mr. McGarry says
it didn't try hard enough. Other critics insist the defectors
will increase after they realize that client referrals aren't
always a two-way street. Still others wonder whether such
diverse law firms have enough in common to stay together.</p>
<p>"I think there's some benefit to it, but I don't know what
the long-term viability is," says Mr. Cleveland of
Hildebrandt.</p>
<p>Lex Mundi also has some holes in its membership. It
doesn't include, for example, firms from Texas, New York,
Illinois, California or Washington, D.C., areas where many of
this country's most powerful law firms are based. Mr. McGarry
says he tried to interest some of those firms, but concluded
they probably didn't need the contacts Lex Mundi is offering.</p>
<p>Gibson Gale, managing partner of Fulbright & Jaworski in
Houston, agrees. With 640 attorneys, Fulbright already has
four offices in Texas, plus outlets in Washington, D.C.; New
York; Los Angeles; London; Zurich, Switzerland; and Hong
Kong. It also maintains time-honored relationships with firms
in countless other cities. "I think we probably would take
the position that we already have our own network," says Mr.
Gale.</p>
<p>But Mr. McGarry argues that most law firms either don't
want or can't afford that sort of expansion. Moreover, he
feels it has more limitations than an association such as Lex
Mundi. "If a Japanese investor wants to buy a ranch in
Wyoming, the fact you have a branch in London doesn't really
do you much good," he says.</p>
