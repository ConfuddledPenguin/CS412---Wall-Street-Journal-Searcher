	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK (AP) -- Mobil Oil Corp. agreed to pump out an
underground lake of fuel oil, gasoline and naphtha that
leaked beneath the streets from a creekside terminal during
the past half-century or more.
   The 14.5 million gallon pool of petroleum products lying
under a section of Brooklyn is larger than the almost 11
million gallons spilled by the tanker Exxon Valdez off Alaska
last year. That was the nation's largest one-time spill.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>State officials said it will take years and cost tens of
millions of dollars to remove the Brooklyn oil, which lies on
top of an aquifer. The aquifer is not used for drinking
water, and authorities also are unsure what health danger, if
any, may be posed by the underground oil.</p>
<p>Authorities have known of the problem at least since 1950,
when gasoline fumes exploded in a sewer on Henry Street. In
1978 they estimated the size of the spill at 17 million
gallons. Of that, about 2.5 million gallons have been pumped
out in a cleanup program that began in 1981.</p>
<p>The state has called that cleanup rate far too slow. The
work had been shared by Mobil and Amoco Corp. Under the new
agreement, Mobil alone is to clean up the spill; it may seek
on its own to recover costs from other oil companies that it
believes share responsibility.</p>
<p>The oil and other petroleum products leaked from the
Greenpoint terminal, a complex on Newtown Creek where oil has
been stored since after the Civil War. The leaks date at
least to World War II. No oil is known to be leaking now,
although authorities cannot be certain about the condition of
underground pipes at the terminal.</p>
