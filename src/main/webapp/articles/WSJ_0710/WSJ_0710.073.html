	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- How's this for a rare bird: A U.S. industrial
giant's stock is being recommended because of the quality of
its management, of all things.
   Wall Street chemical analysts are stretching their
metaphors to the limit to praise the new leadership at Du
Pont, where Chairman Edgar S. Woolard Jr. took control little
more than a year ago.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"You're seeing the same kind of change in the management
at Du Pont that you've seen in the Kremlin," Paul Leming, an
analyst at Morgan Stanley, says. "You've literally seen a
generational shift from an old guard to the new guard." He
also notes that Du Pont's board has been slimmed to 23
members from more than 30, sharply reducing directors'
average age in the process.</p>
<p>For the first time, Mr. Leming says, Du Pont has a
management system where "in underperforming businesses,
they're taking managers out and shooting them. You don't have
lifetime job security anymore."</p>
<p>As an example, Mr. Leming points to Du Pont's decision,
announced last January, to cut 900 jobs from its polymer
products department, as part of an effort to trim costs in
that unit by $100 million a year. The cutbacks followed a
management shake-up in the polymer unit late last year.</p>
<p>Even analysts who have a neutral stance on Du Pont's
shares are impressed by the new approach at Du Pont
headquarters in Wilmington, Del. "The management is working
hard to change the culture and the cost structure," Leslie
Ravitz, a chemical analyst at Salomon Brothers, says. He
notes that Du Pont has closed an operation that made acrylic
fiber, which the company well nigh invented.</p>
<p>In addition, the analysts note that Du Pont's management,
while continuing a huge capital spending program, has been
more aggressive in raising the company's dividend and buying
back stock. Du Pont raised its dividend 10.5% in January 1989
and an additional 14% in October 1989.</p>
<p>To some analysts, Du Pont seems undervalued, compared with
other big industrial companies. George Krug of Oppenheimer,
who put the stock on his firm's recommended list in May, says
Du Pont shares are selling at about 10 times his estimate of
the company's 1990 earnings, a multiple that is about 40%
less than the earnings multiple for stocks in the Standard &
Poor's 500 index.</p>
<p>Mr. Krug also says Du Pont should benefit from an expected
drop in commodity chemical prices over the next few years.
Though Du Pont produces some commodity chemicals, Mr. Krug
argues that the company is, on balance, a buyer of commodity
chemicals, which it uses to produce other chemicals with
fatter profit margins.</p>
<p>Despite the raves for Du Pont management, Mr. Ravitz of
Salomon and Paul Christopherson, chemical analyst at Bear
Stearns, point to a series of uncertainties that could keep
Du Pont's earnings from growing rapidly in the next year or
so.</p>
<p>With more than $35 billion in annual sales, Du Pont is a
huge company exposed to vagaries in many sectors of the
economy. As a big supplier of basic chemicals for paints and
coatings, and a big producer of carpet fibers, Du Pont has
been hurt by slowdowns in auto and home sales. As the owner
of Conoco, a major oil producer and refiner, Du Pont is
affected by oil price swings. And though the company's
medical products unit is expected to revive from a $25
million loss last year (on revenue of about $1.5 billion), it
remains a weak spot.</p>
<p>At yesterday's closing price of 37 1/8, Mr. Christopherson
says, Du Pont is "probably at the low end of the range" of
fair valuation, "but it's not enough to make it a buy with
us."</p>
<p>Mr. Ravitz, who is estimating that Du Pont will earn $3.50
a share this year and $3.75 a share next year, believes its
earnings won't really take off until 1992 or 1993, because
the company now is in the midst of a major capital spending
program. Du Pont, which had capital outlays of $5.09 billion
last year, is projecting $5.2 billion of spending this year.</p>
<p>Among the spending programs are two that will expand Du
Pont's production of two mainstay fibers: nylon and Lycra.
Over the next decade, Du Pont will spend $1 billion to expand
nylon production in Asia alone.</p>
<p>But the real snap for Du Pont earnings could come from
Lycra, a fiber that got its start in women's underwear, moved
into swimsuits, and now is widely used in pantyhose and
exercise clothes. Du Pont is betting between $400 million and
$600 million that more designers will weave Lycra into
dresses, suits and skirts, even after the spandex minidress
fades from the scene.</p>
