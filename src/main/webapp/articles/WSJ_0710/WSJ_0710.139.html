	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- In the latest combination of Chicago futures
and options acumen and foreign financial clout, Chicago
Research & Trading Group Ltd. said it agreed to form a
trading joint venture with Mitsubishi Trust & Banking Corp.,
Japan's largest trust bank.
   The CRT Group joint venture will give the closely held
Chicago trading company increased access to Japanese
financial markets and Mitsubishi's corporate customer base,
said Malcolm Hanney, CRT Group executive vice president. The
joint venture, which is subject to regulatory approval in the
U.S. and Japan, will emphasize off-exchange trading of
currency and interest-rate management products, he said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Late last month, the futures brokerage unit of
Chicago-based Rodman & Renshaw Capital Group Inc. said it was
forming a futures trading joint venture with
Creditanstalt-Bankverein, the largest Austrian bank, to tap
Central and Eastern European markets. And O'Connor &
Associates, a closely held Chicago trading firm, formed a
futures and options trading joint venture with Swiss Bank
Corp. last December.</p>
<p>Chicago's futures and options exchanges are the world's
most active, but their individual member firms have
traditionally been relatively undercapitalized. To tap the
growing global off-exchange markets in options and other
so-called derivative financial products, trading firms are
increasingly turning to banks or other deep-pocketed partners
to provide the necessary credit backing.</p>
<p>Trading firms need to significantly boost their financial
backing to participate in off-exchange transactions made
directly with other financial institutions-transactions that
don't have the benefit of an exchange clearinghouse, where
members pool funds to assume the credit risk of every
transaction.</p>
<p>CRT Group's primary dealer in government securities, CRT
Government Securities Ltd., is expected to be incorporated
into the joint venture, Mr. Hanney said.</p>
