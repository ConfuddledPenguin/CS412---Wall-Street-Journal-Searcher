	<p class="article-leader">ST. LOUIS -- Interco Inc. reported a net loss of $41.3
million for its fiscal first quarter, but the widening
deficit isn't likely to affect the company's talks with
bondholders about restructuring almost $900 million in debt.
   Interco is a furniture and shoe maker that borrowed
heavily in 1988 to fend off a hostile takeover.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Rothschild Inc., financial adviser to bondholders who have
been grumbling about Interco's debt restructuring plan since
it was announced in May, presented a counterproposal last
week in separate meetings with the company, its bankers and
its medium-term note holders. Details of the bondholders'
plan couldn't be learned. But holders have said they don't
like the company's plan because it relies heavily on issuing
new common stock, instead of interest-paying bonds. They also
have suggested that the company's bank lenders should make
more concessions.</p>
<p>Wilbur Ross, a Rothschild senior managing director, said
only that the counterproposal is "more favorable" to
bondholders. "The real issue is what's a fair distribution of
values here and that's what we tried to address in the
counterproposal," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Ross added that the first-quarter loss was in line
with expectations and wouldn't affect the discussions. He
said the bondholders expect to receive a response in the next
few days.</p>
<p>Interco said only that the talks with bondholders "have
been constructive."</p>
<p>For the quarter ended May 31, Interco's net loss widened
to $41.3 million, or $1.64 a share, from $31.6 million, or
$1.29 a share. The company said its Converse and Florsheim
shoe operations earned more than a year ago, but its
furniture business was soft.</p>
<p>Lower interest expenses, however, helped narrow the loss
from continuing operations to $34.1 million, or $1.46 a
share, from $41.4 million, or $1.54 a share, a year earlier.</p>
<p>Sales from continuing operations declined 24% to $357.9
million from $468.7 million.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Richard B. Loynd, Interco's chairman,
predicted that full-year earnings for the company's four core
units -- Converse and Florsheim shoes and Broyhill and Lane
furniture -- will exceed last year's results.</p>
