	<p class="article-leader">Years ago you'd see signs like the one still outside a
county-government service yard in Santa Ana, Calif., boasting
of consecutive days in operation without time lost to injury.
This seemed a macabre, public form of bean counting. These
days it pays to keep such a watch.
   Wage costs are beginning to hurt after nearly a decade of
relief, and U.S. employers are being pinched on the payroll
periphery by such factors as rising health-care premiums and
Social Security taxes. The most rapid increases, however, may
be in workers' compensation expenses, now approaching $50
billion a year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Workers' comp -- the liability for an employee injured on
the job -- is a burden varying greatly among companies,
industries and states. It's four times worse in California
than in Indiana, for example. But the general trend is not a
happy one for business owners. In jurisdictions where costs
have gotten most out of hand, some reforms have been
attempted. They aren't fundamental enough.</p>
<p>In some ways, the workers' comp picture resembles that of
health care: a rapid growth in expenditures punctuated by
attempts to control costs that are followed by new breakouts.
The similarity is understandable, given that the medical
component of workers' comp has been rising (to about 40%)
vis-a-vis the traditionally dominant payment in lieu of
wages.</p>
<p>Thus also expectedly, is that plaintiff lawyers and other
fee grabbers have caught wind of this honey pot and are
widening the gap between what employers pay in and employees
take out.</p>
<p>The rise in job-injury litigation is ironic because
workers' comp programs were begun in most of the states early
this century as a no-fault way of handling industrial
accidents. Companies generally favored the approach and
unions didn't. The system sufficed from an employer's
standpoint but the benefits for injured workers didn't keep
pace with rapidly rising wages after World War II. By 1972, a
report to President Nixon cleared the way for big hikes in
most states. Costs rose with benefits, not simply for the
obvious reason but also because, scholars seem to agree,
higher payouts draw more claimants.</p>
<p>If that explained a leap in the '70s, the late '80s cost
surge is harder to figure. Lost-pay benefits have been
ratcheted higher in some states to catch up with steep wage
inflation a decade ago, but other factors are at work.</p>
<p>Foremost is medicine, which by one forecast will
constitute half of workers' comp costs in the year 2000.
Techniques for holding down treatment bills, though rapidly
being introduced to standard employee health-care coverage,
mostly aren't found in workers' comp. Some suspect that
off-the-job ailments are increasingly being passed off as
work-incurred.</p>
<p>"Occupational disease," including service-counter
"stress," has gained favor in liberal jurisdictions. These
are less physically taxing times, but exposure to suspected
carcinogens and other toxins is a perceived peril, while the
pain of so-called carpal-tunnel syndrome, traced to
repetitive hand and arm motions, is a complaint of
journalists and other electronic-keyboard users. But,
according to Cornell Prof. John Burton, who publishes the
newsletter Workers' Compensation Monitor,
occupational-disease remains a tough sell in most states, as
employees must show that their last job and not the life
leading up to it is the source of woe.</p>
<p>Most workers' comp claims are for short absences with a
minor injury. These are the ones that seem to rise most
surely with the benefit level. The most costly tab, however,
is for what's known as permanent partial disability. Often
those claims are settled in large lump sums to close out
open-ended obligations. Ten years ago, it was thought that
employers were remiss in not bringing such injured workers
back into productive employment, so some states mandated
"vocational rehabilitation." This mainly profited providers,
alas, and the mandates are being repealed.</p>
<p>The biggest third-party cut, not surprisingly, is going to
attorneys. California is particularly beset, although Texas
and Florida too have big workers' comp bars. Alan Tebb of the
insurer-funded California Workers' Compensation Institute
says 12% of all claims in that state are litigated -- 44% of
those involving lost work time -- and he puts the "frictional
cost" per contested case (in lawyer fees, paid testimony from
the "dueling doctors" on each side, photocopying) at $5,800
as of 1988 (vs. $2,436 in 1981). A sixfold rise in litigation
costs in 10 years helps to explain why workers' comp cost
California employers $637 per worker in 1987, 72% above the
national mean.</p>
<p>Unions and some academics say lawsuits wouldn't be a
problem if employees didn't feel abandoned, if state workers'
comp agencies promptly and conscientiously adjudicated
claims. Wisconsin is praised in this respect, but usually
appeal boards are a budgetary backwater. Indeed, in its
current fiscal crunch, California may target employers for an
extra hit to cover administration of the program.</p>
<p>California also saw one of the most recent efforts to
reform workers' comp, in legislation passed last year.
Benefit levels were hiked while some of the other costs were
attacked. Only sketchy results are in, but previous revisions
in other states, such as in Florida at the end of the '70s,
proved to have only a passing effect.</p>
<p>The trick is to get incentives right, to empower employees
to choose the best affordable option while discouraging them
from malingering. One idea is to allow payroll deductions
into a tax-deferred "portable" account for each employee. The
benefits could be drawn out for certified job injuries or, if
unused, partially converted to cash at retirement.</p>
<p>Long-term disabilities could cause actuarial problems in
that setup, so maybe we should start with Princeton economist
Alan Krueger's proposal to establish a deductible of sorts:
Workers would need to be off the job 14 days before they
could collect workers' comp. Each worker would have to
shoulder the burden of minor injuries -- which Mr. Krueger
thinks are more likely to be fudged -- in return for higher
long-term benefits, which he supports.</p>
<p>With employers, encouraging the growth of self-insurance
would discipline companies by forcing them to bear the actual
costs of their practices. (And guess what? -- workers seem to
return to the job sooner when their boss is directly on the
hook for their absence.) Meantime higher benefit levels seem
to result in fewer serious injuries, presumably by prodding
the boss to maintain a safer workplace.</p>
<p>Workers' compensation is a classic societal safety net.
The challenge is to make it available and reliable for those
who need it by making sure the financial supports are strong
and getting rid of the ballast of middle men holding it too
near the ground.</p>
