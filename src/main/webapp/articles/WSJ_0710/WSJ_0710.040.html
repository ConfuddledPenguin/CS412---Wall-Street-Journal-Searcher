	<p class="article-leader">Women who choose lives like Slim Keith's usually don't get
to write their memoirs. Instead, they appear as glamorous
figures in the biographies of their men, as tokens of men's
success, or occasionally, sirens of men's destruction.
Because they have no career achievements of their own, other
people end up having the last word -- at least the last
printed word.
   Yet, the lives of charmers like Keith are careers in
themselves, crafted day-by-day, year by year. Many young
girls dream of being movie stars, but a few, like Nancy
Gross, who grew up to be called Slim Hawks, then Slim Hayward
and, finally, Slim Keith, aim at glamorous lives. The key to
the kingdom isn't the silver screen, it's the golden
marriage.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Perhaps now they are a dying breed who had their heyday in
such good-natured, time-faded works as "Gentlemen Prefer
Blondes." If aspiring actresses are starlets, perhaps these
girls begin as wifelets.</p>
<p>I ought to say quickly that Slim Keith (who died in April
at age 72) wouldn't have liked my suggestion, but therein
lies the central confusion of her memoir.</p>
<p>"I've never been kept, ever," she says early on in "Slim:
Memories of a Rich and Imperfect Life" (Simon & Schuster, 319
pages, $22.95), written with Annette Tapert.</p>
<p>She bases that claim on her proven ability to get her
chosen target to the altar. Never mind that she was Howard
Hawks's constant companion for three years while he got a
divorce. Never mind that when her 20-year-old eyes sight
42-year-old famous film director Hawks she describes him not
in terms of passion, but as "exactly the package I wanted";
never mind that she spent another period of years with her
second husband, the agent and producer Leland Hayward,
waiting for his divorce; and never mind that her third
marriage, to British banker Sir Kenneth Keith, was, in her
words, a calculated deal.</p>
<p>So, while Keith wrote a book rich in anecdotes about her
life, she missed the opportunity to define that life on the
page -- to tell us clearly the deal she made with fate: what
she set out to do and how she did it. It's a shame, because
this was no accidental life. When Keith dropped out of
convent school to aim her yellow Packard roadster from her
hometown of Salinas, Calif., toward a popular winter resort,
it was no casual vacation, but the launch of a mission whose
success NASA might envy. She was smart enough and tough
enough to lead the life, but somehow she flinched at writing
what was in her heart and mind.</p>
<p>Her memoir is full of tales of the rich and famous, but
there's a hole at its center where the intelligence, ambition
and sex appeal of Slim Keith ought to be.</p>
<p>After all, she created a style that had her on the
best-dressed list for years; Lauren Bacall's role in "To Have
and Have Not" was modeled on her; men from William Powell,
who nicknamed her Slim, to Clark Gable to Ernest Hemingway
were among her admirers. She came a long way from Salinas.</p>
<p>She walks to the edge of explanation, saying that her
celebrity was a combination of good looks, brains, taste and
style. But she gives us precious few examples of her brain at
work and would have us believe it was all easy and
uncalculated. Only occasionally does she let us see just how
clearly she understood what she meant to men. "I was a
fabulous arm-piece, the ultimate decoration," she writes.</p>
<p>Because of Keith's reticence, when she dishes Pamela
Churchill (now Pamela Harriman), who stole Leland Hayward
from her, it's easy to understand her motive, but not her
distinction between her rival and herself. "Rich and powerful
men were, in short, her career," she writes, after listing
eight wealthy men with whom Ms. Churchill's name had been
linked. She remarks that men didn't have to marry Ms.
Churchill to get what they wanted. Well, Hayward and Harriman
did.</p>
<p>An unpleasant cattiness pops up even where motive is
lacking. She was thrilled at age 20 to be a frequent guest of
William Randolph Hearst at San Simeon and elsewhere. Yet, a
page later, she's carping that Hearst was a boring host.
Husband Hawks undoubtedly was the cold-hearted philanderer
she describes, but she belittles his films as well as the
man.</p>
<p>After establishing her pride in not being kept, she argues
that marriage and men are tedious over the long term. The way
she portrays Sir Kenneth Keith, a girl would have had to hold
her nose and close her eyes to marry him.</p>
<p>She calls Leland Hayward the love of her life, but she
drove him crazy by a lengthy flirtation with Clark Gable.
Poor Gable, however, is rated too dumb to get to first base.
(Well, make that home plate.)</p>
<p>Perhaps her manner comes of marrying so rich so young.
Perhaps it's a case of what her friend Truman Capote (until
he described her as a nasty gossip in "La Cote Basque")
called answered prayers -- gifts it turns out you didn't
want.</p>
<p>Some of the best stories Keith tells are about her
friendship with Hemingway. (Or maybe its just that Hemingway
was more interesting than most people she knew.) Poor Papa.
His sexual fears and confusions have been much described and
Keith had fun playing on them. By her account she teased him
for years.</p>
<p>Neither Gable nor Hemingway could score with her, although
she allows that others did, despite her married state.
There's no accounting for taste, but I wish she'd tried a bit
harder to explain hers.</p>
