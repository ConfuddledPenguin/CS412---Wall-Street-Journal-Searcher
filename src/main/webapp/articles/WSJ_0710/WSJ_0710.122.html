	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The House panel investigating federal
housing corruption will ask a special prosecutor to
investigate possible acts of perjury by former housing
Secretary Samuel Pierce.
   The House employment and housing subcommittee will send a
letter of "at least 20 pages" to Arlin Adams, the special
prosecutor who was appointed this year to look into
irregularities in the Department of Housing and Urban
Development's moderate-rehabilitation rent-subsidy program.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The subcommittee will ask Mr. Adams, a retired federal
judge, to seek permission from the three-judge appellate
court panel that appointed him to expand his authority. The
subcommittee wants Mr. Adams to examine three additional
areas, the most serious of which is perjury, according to
Stuart Weisberg, the subcommittee's chief counsel.</p>
<p>The letter to Mr. Adams, which Mr. Weisberg expects to be
delivered next week, will "cite the specific quotes, the
specific statements" in testimony of Mr. Pierce that the
House panel believes may be false.</p>
<p>Mr. Pierce's lawyer, Paul Perito, said it is
"inconceivable" that Mr. Adams would find that the former
secretary lied. Mr. Perito added that the subcommittee's
effort is a "bold and unwarranted attempt to put the
secretary in unfavorable light with the independent counsel."</p>
<p>Mr. Weisberg wouldn't give examples of possible Pierce
inconsistencies. But members of the House panel previously
have pointed to testimony from former HUD officials, who
contradicted the former secretary by indicating that Mr.
Pierce had direct involvement in awarding contracts through
political favoritism.</p>
<p>In May, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh asked the special
prosecutor to expand his inquiry to include allegations of
favoritism in grants from the secretary's discretionary fund
and from an urban development program. Mr. Adams office
wouldn't say what decision, if any, has been made on the
Thornburgh request.</p>
<p>Mr. Weisberg said the subcommittee won't accuse Mr. Pierce
of committing perjury, but will suggest there is reasonable
cause to believe that further investigation is warranted. "We
believe that standard has been more than met in these
instances," he said.</p>
<p>He wouldn't disclose the other two areas the panel wants
the special prosecutor to examine, but Mr. Weisberg did add:
"Perjury is the one Pierce will have the most trouble with."</p>
