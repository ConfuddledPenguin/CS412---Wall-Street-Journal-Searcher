	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Bond prices continued to sag over Friday's
unexpectedly strong employment report and concerns about how
well the market will absorb this week's heavy load of
government offerings.
   Stocks drifted higher in thin trading. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average added 9.16 points to close at 2914.11. The
dollar was mixed, but surprisingly stable, considering all
the focus on the ebullient British pound.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Long-term U.S. Treasury bond prices fell nearly half a
point, or $5 for each $1,000 of face amount. But trading was
light as investors waited to see how today's Resolution
Funding Corp. auction of $5 billion of 30-year bonds goes.
Adding to the supply tomorrow will be the government's sale
of $8 billion of seven-year notes.</p>
<p>"Supply is weighing heavily on people's minds," said
Michael Rosen, an analyst at First Interstate Bank, Los
Angeles.</p>
<p>In the stock market, investors are nervously awaiting the
onslaught of second-quarter earnings reports and watching how
the bond market responds to its new supply. Hugh Johnson,
chief investment officer at First Albany Corp., said, "Nobody
wants to be a hero and step up to the plate before we see
those earnings reports."</p>
<p>In major market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices rose on volume of 119.4 million shares in the
New York Stock Exchange trading. Advancing issues edged out
decliners, 764-673.</p>
<p>Bond prices fell. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond rose to 8.54%.</p>
<p>The dollar ended mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.6530 marks and 151.15 yen, compared
with 1.6520 marks and 151.70 yen Friday.</p>
