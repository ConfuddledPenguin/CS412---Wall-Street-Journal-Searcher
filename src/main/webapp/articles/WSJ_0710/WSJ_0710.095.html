	<p class="article-leader">Flight International Group Inc. said three shareholder
lawsuits against the company, officers and directors, and its
accounting firm were settled for cash, stock, and notes
valued at $5.25 million.
   Flight International, based in Newport News, Va., is an
aviation-services company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the settlement, Flight International will issue
340,000 new shares of common stock to shareholders who
purchased company stock between June 21, 1988, and Sept. 29,
1989. Flight International has about 3.7 million shares
outstanding.</p>
<p>The class-action suits alleged that the company filed
inaccurate financial statements for fiscal 1988 and fiscal
1989. In March, the company restated its fiscal 1989 earnings
to a loss of $3.8 million, or $1.29 a share, from previously
reported net income of $3.0 million, or $1.01 a share.</p>
<p>Flight International valued its portion of the settlement
at about $1 million, based on an assumed stock value of about
$3 a share. The company's stock was delisted by NASDAQ
several months ago and does not actively trade.</p>
<p>The remaining defendants contributed the rest of the
settlement, the company said. Those defendants include
Douglas G. Matthews, the company's former chairman; John W.
Orange Jr., former chief financial officer; and Deloitte &
Touche, the company's independent accounting firm during the
alleged misstatements.</p>
