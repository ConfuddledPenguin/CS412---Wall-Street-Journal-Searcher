	<p class="article-leader">Ayer, one of the ad industry's oldest names and one of
just a handful of huge agencies to remain privately held, is
considering going public, its new chief financial officer
said.
   In an interview, Glenn Corlett said that financial
pressures on the beleaguered agency, which is still reeling
from two major client losses, are prompting him to explore a
number of alternatives, including going public.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That admission is startling, considering that Ayer has
repeatedly stressed its determination to remain independent
and private. It also augurs a new direction for Ayer, which,
perhaps for the first time, is taking its finances as
seriously as it takes its ads.</p>
<p>Mr. Corlett said the likelihood of such a drastic step is
probably less than 50%, but that he nevertheless must give it
some consideration. "Taking this agency public is certainly
one thing we need to look at from time to time. We've
historically said we want to remain independent. . . . But
the fact of the matter is, in this changing world, you have
to re-evaluate that preference regularly. I'm looking at
that." He added that "the mandate I've been given is,
`nothing is out of bounds.'"</p>
<p>Mr. Corlett said he would also consider other options,
such as selling a minority stake in Ayer to a foreign firm,
or a setup similar to the one between Foote, Cone & Belding
and France's Publicis, in which each holds a minority stake
in the other. He said selling all or a majority of Ayer to
another company isn't under consideration. Any of those
alternatives would be a radical departure for Ayer, founded
121 years ago and known for its emotional ads for blue-chip
clients like American Telephone & Telegraph, General Motors
and Procter & Gamble.</p>
<p>The fact that Mr. Corlett is even considering steps that
management had until recently ruled out categorically points
up just how distressed the advertising industry has become.
Ayer in particular has had a few rough years. Since 1988,
U.S. billings have plunged 23%, to an estimated $726 million
from $947 million, mostly because of the loss of two huge
accounts: Burger King in 1989 and Continental Airlines
earlier this year. The agency recently closed its Houston
office and last year had to merge its Chicago office with a
local agency there after the Chicago outpost lost almost all
its clients.</p>
<p>Mr. Corlett, who became chief financial officer last
month, spoke candidly in the interview about Ayer's financial
situation. In the past year, he said, revenue slid 25%,
mostly because of the loss of the two clients. At the same
time, New York-based Ayer hasn't cut costs enough to counter
the revenue loss. U.S. payroll costs, for example, have
declined only 17% since 1988, to an estimated $59 million
this year. The upshot: While the agency remains profitable,
its profitability fell last year and will remain about flat
this year, he said.</p>
<p>Layoffs might seem a reasonable step to improve
profitability. But Ayer, which prides itself on its
paternalistic tradition of avoiding layoffs, is determined to
preserve that culture. Considering layoffs "was clearly
discouraged" by top management, Mr. Corlett said. He said he
is hoping to cut costs by attrition, doing away with some
duplicated functions and more fully computerizing the
company.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ayer, like other large privately held agencies,
must wrestle with how to expand and compete with agencies
that have access to funds from the public. The mega-agencies
that grew and merged throughout the 1980s relied on raising
money through the public markets. Private agencies had to use
their own money and bank loans to keep up. Now, with ad
spending in a stubborn lull and with the economy awash in
uncertainty, the private agencies are finding expansion
difficult.</p>
<p>Ayer, for one, used to make acquisitions with internally
generated cash. But in the past two years, it had to borrow
about $25 million to make several dozen European acquisitions
with a total price tag of over $50 million, Mr. Corlett said.
Part of his mandate is to find "economical ways to service
that debt," he said, while part is to find new ways to
continue growing.</p>
<p>"You can raise money from the public markets if you're
public. But if you aren't, you've got a real problem with
financing that rapid growth," he said. "We are struggling
under the issues of how do we finance our growth and control
the related costs." He said one possible answer will be to
create joint ventures abroad, rather than to buy existing ad
agencies outright. The agency has 71 offices in 41 countries
and owns either the majority or 100% of most of its agencies
abroad.</p>
<p>Emphasizing that Ayer has ruled out selling all or a
majority of the agency to an outsider, Mr. Corlett said that
to remain independent, the agency "is willing to accept
tightening our belt and a little less profit."</p>
<p>Mr. Corlett's appointment is a sign that even the most
traditional Madison Avenue holdouts are taking finances more
seriously. A Price Waterhouse veteran, Mr. Corlett is the
first Ayer chief financial officer to come from the "outside"
and the first who didn't start his career in advertising. His
predecessor at Ayer, for instance, began as an account
executive.</p>
<p>Mr. Corlett also is the first chief financial officer in
the agency's history to be named to the board. The fact that
his predecessors weren't "gives you a hint of what the
advertising people thought of that function -- they didn't
hold it in high regard," he said.</p>
<p>"The financial function is coming out of the closet, and
it's becoming a lot more important in terms of whether the
agencies can remain competitive," he said. "Today, in order
to survive and compete, you'd better have effective financial
management. It probably hasn't been true before, but in the
1990s, it certainly is going to be true. You'll see a lot of
ad agencies go out of business because they don't pay
attention to the financial side."</p>
