	<p class="article-leader">OMAHA, Neb. -- ConAgra Inc. said federal antitrust
regulators requested additional information about the
company's planned $1.34 billion cash and stock purchase of
Beatrice Co.
   In early June, ConAgra agreed to acquire Beatrice from
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., which had taken the company
private in 1986. At that time, the transaction had been
expected to close in about a month.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>ConAgra said the request, under Hart-Scott-Rodino
regulations, extends the waiting period for completion of the
transaction until 20 days after the Federal Trade
Commission's request has been fully met.</p>
<p>Both food companies received the request, and in a joint
statement noted that it isn't unusual for the FTC to seek
additional information in such a transaction.</p>
<p>Neither company would disclose what data the agency are
seeking, and the FTC wouldn't comment.</p>
<p>John McMillin, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., pointed out that "normally, big deals get more
attention" from regulators. The analyst added that there
isn't a "tremendous amount of overlap between" the two
companies.</p>
<p>Mr. McMillin noted, as have others, that ConAgra and
Beatrice are both major forces in the prepared-meats
business, and that the FTC may be scrutinizing the antitrust
implications in that field.</p>
<p>ConAgra's chairman and chief executive officer, Charles M.
Harper, has said he wasn't worried about antitrust problems,
saying "we think we're below the threshold of their
{regulators'} concern level."</p>
<p>The companies said they plan a full and prompt response to
the FTC request.</p>
