	<p class="article-leader">AMSTERDAM -- Because of 3% decline in imports, the
Netherlands' trade surplus in April widened to 700 million
guilders ($375.7 million) from the year-earlier surplus of
200 million guilders.
   But the trade surplus for the first four months of this
year narrowed to three billion guilders from a surplus of 3.4
billion guilders a year earlier.</p>
