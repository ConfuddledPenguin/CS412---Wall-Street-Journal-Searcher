	<p class="article-leader">While a torrent of words pours out of the Party Congress
inside the Kremlin, the Moscow City Council has just voted to
take the city's housing stock away from the state authorities
and give the apartments to the people who now live in them.
City Council spokesmen argue that Moscovites have already
paid for those apartments, in the form of the suffering they
have endured under 70 years of socialism. If the plan proves
workable, housing in Moscow will soon be in the hands of
private owners.
   The motivation behind the effort is largely political. The
City Council's reformist politicians figure that if
Muscovites possess private property, then they'll be more
likely to support politicians who aim to protect property
rights, even in the depths of any potential austerity period.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Proponents of the plan also argue that owners will do a
better job of maintaining the buildings than the state has
done. They could scarcely do worse. Hallways, lobbies, stairs
and elevators, which are supposed to be maintained by the
authorities, are in conditions resembling the worst Western
ghettos. They smell of urine, the paint peels and floors
crumble.</p>
<p>Significantly, the plan would allow Muscovites to buy and
sell apartments. Now, the only way to get a new apartment is
through a straight-up swap, involving reams of paper work and
bribery. Imagine the difficulty a growing family faces trying
to swap a one-room apartment for a two-room version.</p>
<p>The City Council's plan is a step in the right direction,
but it's also a step in the dark. Introducing a sector of
private property into an economy still predominantly
socialist remains a mysterious business. Socialist-induced
scarcity may sink the effort. New owners will have trouble
getting materials to refurbish their buildings. And if they
do obtain some cement or bricks, the goods may be stolen.
It's also hard to see why a tenant would want to sell his
apartment for rubles, a virtually worthless currency.</p>
<p>But the Moscow City Soviet has advantages on its side. It
clearly intends to make housing privatization the first of
many privatization efforts. Private carpenters, plumbers and
painters are already working on the black market. If private
lumber companies and the like are legalized, and if there is
a realistic way to pay people for their services, then the
Moscow City Council's brave reform could have a dramatic
effect.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Moscow housing privatization is a clean
break from the past, and doesn't resemble the gradual,
halfway reform models that we have come to expect from
Gorbachev and company. The city of Budapest embarked on a
halfway effort several years ago. Rather than simply taking
possession of their own apartments, Hungarians had to put in
the purchase order with the state bureaucracy. Naturally,
delay and corruption were rife.</p>
<p>Last week's City Council vote is more evidence that the
most notable activity occurring in Moscow and elsewhere is
not taking place at the Party Congress, but amid the
reformers who now control a number of local governments. It
is intriguing that so many Western leaders persist in
devising schemes to "help" Mr. Gorbachev and the rest of his
Communist Party colleagues, who are, at best, partisans of
halfway reform. In doing so, the Soviet democrats say, the
West is actually retarding the efforts of those who are the
true agents of change. At the least, the dramatic action
taken by the Moscow City Council to bring private property to
the country's citizens indicates that Mr. Gorbachev's is not
the only timetable for achieving perestroika.</p>
