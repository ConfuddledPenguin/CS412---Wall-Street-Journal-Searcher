	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Donald Trump signed France's largest retailer,
Galeries Lafayette, to a lease in Trump Tower, his building
on Fifth Avenue here.
   The Galeries Lafayette store, which caters to an affluent
clientele, will replace Bonwit Teller, whose lease was
purchased by Mr. Trump in April for $5 million. Bonwit Teller
had paid more than $4 million a year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the lease terms, Galeries Lafayette, which will
occupy about 80,000 square feet of space, will pay about $5
million a year, or $62.50 a square foot, for the first six
years.</p>
<p>In years seven through 10, the store will pay $8 million a
year, and it will pay $9 million a year in years 11 through
16, according to a person familiar with the transaction.
Also, Mr. Trump will receive a "special fee" of about $2
million a year for five years.</p>
<p>The deal is considered positive news for Mr. Trump, but
it's not expected to alter his debt troubles. Mr. Trump is
currently restructuring $2 billion in loans from his banks,
and he must still service $1.3 billion in casino debt.</p>
<p>Last month, he received an additional $20 million from his
banks, as part of an eventual $65 million package that would
allow him to defer interest on $800 million of his bank debt.</p>
