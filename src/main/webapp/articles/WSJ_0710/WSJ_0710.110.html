	<p class="article-leader">Net investment in the stocks of one country's companies by
investors in another country soared to a record $92.3 billion
last year, nearly triple the previous high of $31.7 billion
set in 1986, a Salomon Brothers Inc. study found.
   The firm said that gross cross-border equity investment
climbed to a record $1.6 trillion last year -- or 14.5% of
world stock turnover -- from $1.2 trillion a year earlier.
British money managers led the way, followed by those from
the U.S. and Japan. Swiss portfolio managers ranked fourth.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>These numbers mean that one stock transaction out of every
seven world-wide involves a foreign investor. Ten years ago,
that ratio was less than one in every 16, according to
Salomon.</p>
<p>As of last year, the value of international shares held by
foreign investors stood at $830 billion, or 7.2% of the
aggregate value of world stock markets, up from $640 billion
in 1988.</p>
<p>Still, Salomon said: "We believe the globalization of
equity markets has significantly further to go." The firm
estimated that the average investment portfolio contains less
than 10% of international assets, compared to what Salomon
contends should be an optimal level of 15%-20%.</p>
