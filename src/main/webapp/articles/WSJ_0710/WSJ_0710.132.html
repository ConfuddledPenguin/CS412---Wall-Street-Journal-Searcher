	<p class="article-leader">The stocks of athletic-footwear makers Nike and K-Swiss
jumped, while the rest of the OTC market stumbled into a
mixed close.
   Nike leaped 7 1/4 to 87 1/4 after turning in a shining
profit report for its fourth quarter ended May 31. The
company earned $1.77 a share, up from 97 cents a year ago.
The earnings were better than analysts had expected and were
over the top of Nike's own projected profit range, which it
had boosted higher in June.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The OTC market's new athletic footwear stock, K-Swiss,
bounded along with Nike, adding 1 1/4 to 27 1/2. K-Swiss,
which specializes in tennis shoes, has gained an incredible
57% since it went public for $17.50 a share in early June.</p>
<p>But the Nasdaq Composite Index failed to keep up with the
rubber-soled stocks, adding only 1.15, or 0.25%, to 461.68.
Much of that rise came late in the day.</p>
<p>The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index gained only
0.23%.</p>
<p>More stocks fell in price on the OTC market than gained,
however. OTC advancers trailed decliners 925 to 1,030.</p>
<p>Volume rose to a weak 118.5 million shares from Friday's
anemic 101.4 million shares.</p>
<p>William R. Rothe, managing director of OTC trading at
Alex. Brown & Sons, says that despite the recent light
trading volume institutions are continuing to buy stocks.</p>
<p>"People are still putting cash to work because they don't
have any viable alternatives," he says.</p>
<p>Nike drew the loudest cheers in the OTC market. The
company said its world-wide orders for athletic footwear and
apparel scheduled for delivery between June and November 1990
are 42% higher in dollars compared to the same period last
year. Foreign orders are up 70%, Nike said.</p>
<p>Nike's international business could match its domestic
sales within the next three to five years, says Shearson
Lehman Hutton analyst Josie Esquivel. International sales
comprise only a little more than 20% of the company's
business currently, she says.</p>
<p>"Basketball is the fastest growing sport in Europe," Ms.
Esquivel says, giving Nike an opportunity to exercise one of
its strongest suits there. Meanwhile, Nike is pursuing other
European sports markets such as soccer, she says.</p>
<p>"All that put together will continue to give Nike a
tremendous edge overseas," says Ms. Esquivel. She expects the
company's earnings to grow 20% annually for the next three
years. Yesterday, Ms. Esquivel raised her estimate for Nike's
fiscal 1991 profit to $7.80 a share from her earlier estimate
of $7.50 a share.</p>
<p>Eager investors may get a buying opportunity soon, she
says. Ms. Esquivel believes the market overreacted to
yesterday's earnings news and says the stock will fall back a
bit in the next few days.</p>
<p>Apple Computer led the most-active list, gaining 1 7/8 to
46 5/8. Soundview Financial Group upgraded its long-term
investment rating on the stock to a "buy" from a "hold"
because of expectation that new product introductions will
help boost Apple's share of the desktop computer market over
the next year, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor
Report.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the technology front, 3Com rose 7/8 to 17
5/8. International Business Machines announced a joint
development effort with 3Com to write specifications that
they say will result in customers being able to more
effectively manage different kinds of networks.</p>
<p>MCI Communications eased 3/4 to 40 7/8. PaineWebber's
telecommunications analyst Jack Grubman says the stock is
reflecting underlying nervousness about second-quarter
earnings in the long-distance telephone industry. He says,
however, that MCI has told analysts that it will meet
expectations.</p>
<p>MCI's drop and the weakness in other telecommunications
stocks translated into a 1.97-point loss by the Nasdaq
Utility Index to 643.82.</p>
<p>Laidlaw added 3/4 to 24 1/8. The company's founder,
Michael Degroote, has named Donald Jackson as the new head of
the $2 billion transportation and hazardous-waste managment
company.</p>
<p>Carrington Laboratories fell 2 1/2 to 17. Yesterday's
"Heard on the Street" column in this newspaper raised
questions about the prospects for use of the company's
Carrisyn drug in treating AIDS. Carrington said its stock has
been the target of a "bear raid" by so-called short sellers,
who sell borrowed stock in hopes of profiting from the
decline in the stock's price.</p>
<p>DEKALB Genetics lost 1 to 42 1/2. The company said it
expects to report that an unexpectedly large Argentine
currency loss will cut its third quarter profit to less than
half of the 85 cents a share earned in the quarter last year.</p>
<p>Microlog lost 1 1/4 to 3 1/2. The company said Hambrecht &
Quist cut its earnings estimate for the company's fiscal year
ending in October to 40 cents a share from a previous
estimate of 60 cents. In fiscal 1989, the Germantown,
Md.-based manufacturer of voice-processing systems earned 46
cents a share.</p>
