	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Hughes Aircraft Co. Chairman Malcolm R.
Currie denied that he improperly handled Pentagon budget
secrets in the early 1980s, maintaining that such allegations
are based on "innunendoes and hearsay."
   In response to a Wall Street Journal story last Friday
about an ongoing federal grand jury probe of illegal
gathering and swapping of Pentagon budget documents, Mr.
Currie issued a letter to employees of Hughes, a unit of
General Motors Corp. In the five-paragraph letter, Mr. Currie
said, "I did not know or approve of the unlawful activities
in question." The letter also said that prosecutors "advised
us that I am not a target of this criminal investigation."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Further, he said, "I offered my testimony freely and
voluntarily" to federal investigators and no civil lawsuit is
"contemplated against Hughes or myself" by the government.</p>
<p>Mr. Currie declined to be interviewed for last Friday's
Journal story. The company issued a brief comment saying that
Mr. Currie "did not have any knowledge" of illegal conduct by
a Hughes employee convicted last month of trafficking in
bootlegged Pentagon documents.</p>
<p>The story said Mr. Currie had been under criminal
investigation, and had been interviewed by federal
investigators, but wasn't a target of the grand jury inquiry.
Law enforcement officials in Washington couldn't be reached
yesterday, but repeatedly have indicated that they haven't
ruled out some sort of civil action against Mr. Currie and
others.</p>
