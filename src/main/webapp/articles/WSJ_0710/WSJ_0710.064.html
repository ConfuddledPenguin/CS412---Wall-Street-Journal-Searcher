	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The brave souls who tiptoed back into junk
bond mutual funds in the spring are already starting to get
rewarded. According to New York's Lipper Analytical Services,
junk funds produced a total return, or share price change
plus dividends, of 4.1% over the past three months, better
than any other category of domestic bond fund.
   Investing in longer-term bonds "was right for this
quarter, and the lower quality funds also worked," said A.
Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical. "We're back
to normality."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the mutual fund companies, which have been bleeding
junk fund assets for much of the past year, the junk market
turnaround is welcome news. According to the Investment
Company Institute, total junk fund assets dwindled from $35.2
billion in June 1989 to $24.5 billion in April 1990, as junk
bond prices fell and investors yanked $6.3 billion more out
of junk bond funds than they invested. But junk fund
investors turned mildly bullish in May, with junk funds
enjoying net inflows of $57.2 million. Fund groups say junk
funds are continuing to pull in cash.</p>
<p>But, warned Ronald Lout, a bond fund manager at Denver's
Financial Programs, "The {junk bond} rally is pretty narrow."
He noted that most of the quarter's gain came from the
interest paid out by the high-yield bonds and that to date
there's been little in the way of appreciation in junk bond
prices.</p>
<p>But that was also true for other fund categories. Ian
MacKinnon, head of Vanguard Group's fixed-income department,
dubs the past six months the "era of the coupon," with
investors earning the yield on their bonds but not enjoying
or suffering much in the way of capital gains or losses.</p>
<p>In the past six months, the yield on the benchmark 30-year
Treasury bond has moved in a relatively narrow band. The
yield at the end of June was 8.4%, down from 8.63% at the end
of the first quarter but up from 7.97% at the end of 1989.</p>
<p>Mr. MacKinnon said he anticipated the becalmed bond market
back in June 1989, when the yield on long Treasurys was about
8.5%. "We thought rates wouldn't go much one way or the
other," he said. "At the time, we figured inflation was
around 4% or 4.5%, and that a real rate of interest of 4% or
4.5% was a reasonable rate of return. Our outlook hasn't
really changed. I would say that market timing will not prove
a lucrative endeavor over the next 12 months, just as it
hasn't been over the past six months."</p>
<p>Recently, the dull but safe money market funds lagged
those that held longer maturity bonds or riskier credits. But
for the past six months and the past year, money market funds
rank as the top-performing category among fixed-income funds.</p>
<p>So far this year, money market funds have also outstripped
most stock funds. Money markets returned 3.84% through the
first six months of 1990, vs. 3.46% for the diversified
domestic equity funds.</p>
<p>Although junk fund investors were paid to take risks in
the second quarter, that pattern didn't always hold true when
it came to investment grade corporate credits. Government
bond funds tended to outperform corporate bond funds holding
securities of comparable maturity.</p>
<p>"I think there's a concern about credit," said Mr. Lipper.
He noted that investors also weren't paid to take additional
risk in the money market area. The second-quarter return for
money market funds that buy only short-term U.S. government
paper was just 0.03 percentage point less than the return for
those money market funds that dabble in the corporate IOUs
known as commercial paper.</p>
<p>GNMA funds, which buy mortgage-backed bonds that are
guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association,
rank just behind money market funds in terms of one-year
performance. These funds continued to do well in the second
quarter, as the gap between the yields on Ginnie Maes and
Treasurys narrowed to 1.2 percentage points. The spread had
jumped to 1.6 percentage points in early 1989 because of
fears that the mortgage bond market would be swamped when
troubled savings and loans liquidated their portfolios. Jack
Lemein, manager of the $11 billion Franklin U.S. Government
Securities Fund, thinks the spread isn't likely to narrow
much further. "From here on out, you're starting to bet
against historical numbers," he said.</p>
<p>The second quarter was kindest to the small band of
international bond funds, which rose 4.76% in dollar terms.
Paul Suckow, director of fixed income at Oppenda and the
United Kingdom, short-term interest rates are higher than the
yields on longer bonds. "You can go overseas and get a
handsome yield without taking a lot of interest rate risk,"
said Mr. Suckow.</p>
<p>Dale Rabiner, Bartlett & Co.'s director of fixed income,
is also intrigued by the foreign bond markets. He is already
dabbling in Canadian government bonds and eyeing West German
government bonds. "From a global perspective, our real rates
in the U.S. are the lowest of all industrialized countries,"
noted Mr. Rabiner.</p>
