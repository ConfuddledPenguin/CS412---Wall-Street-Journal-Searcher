	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- News Corp.'s HarperCollins Publishers
subsidiary sent a shock wave through the book industry with
an unusual agreement to acquire three books, including movie
and television rights, from British writer Jeffrey Archer.
   Although terms of the agreement weren't disclosed,
publishing industry executives said the contract could be
valued at between $15 million and $30 million to Mr. Archer,
author of such books as "Kane and Abel" and "First Among
Equals." Such huge advances for as-yet unfinished books are
rare in the industry, and it is virtually unheard of for
publishing companies to also acquire video rights to a book
property.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Archer confirmed last week that he was about to
conclude an auction of his next three books after rejecting a
$20 million offer from a publisher he declined to name.
HarperCollins, the winning bidder, has spent millions to lure
big-name authors away from other houses recently. But its
previous contracts with authors have been the standard
book-rights-only arrangements, with rare exceptions such as
"The Thorn Birds" by Colleen McCollough for which it also
acquired video rights.</p>
<p>Mr. Archer, reached in London, also declined to say
exactly how much his new contract is worth, but said, "As I
turned down $20 million, I would think it must have been for
more." The $20 million offer -- which was never confirmed by
any publisher -- might have included world rights, which the
HarperCollins agreement doesn't.</p>
<p>Mr. Archer's previous novels have sold best in his native
England, where he is keeping his longtime British publisher,
closely held Hodder & Stoughton. HarperCollins got hardcover
and paperback rights for the U.S. and Canada, all translation
rights except for Japanese, as well as movie, television and
audio rights.</p>
<p>Top New York literary agencies such as International
Creative Management and the William Morris Agency have movie
agents in Hollywood and much experience negotiating for movie
and television rights; most say they would never think of
selling those rights to publishing houses, which aren't as
well equipped to handle them. The speculation is that Mr.
Archer, who was represented by a retired British literary
agent, was inexperienced in dealing with Hollywood. At the
same time, he might have found HarperCollins reluctant to pay
the high fees he wanted without some additional rights in the
package.</p>
<p>HarperCollins Senior Vice President Eddie Bell, who made
the bid for the Archer books, says he got the idea to buy the
extra rights because he liked Mr. Archer's nearly completed
next novel so much. "It's a big international novel with
romance and intrigue, and it'll be a monster seller," says
Mr. Bell, adding that it thus has movie potential.</p>
<p>News Corp. also owns Twentieth Century Fox, the movie
studio, but that doesn't necessarily mean Fox will get the
rights, assuming it wants them. "I would love to see Fox do
it," said Mr. Bell, but he added that he hasn't shown it to
anyone at either the movie studio or the Fox television
network.</p>
<p>The HarperCollins offer includes two more books by Mr.
Archer, another novel and a collection of short stories. The
first novel, to be called "As the Crow Flies," will be turned
in by the author this fall, said Mr. Bell, and published next
spring.</p>
<p>HarperCollins was formed by the merger of American
publisher Harper & Row and the British publisher Collins.
Before its acquisition by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., Harper
& Row was known as a publisher of high-brow and academic
books, with only an occasional best seller. The new
management has added a paperback division and emphasized best
sellers, spending millions to attract such big name authors
as Len Deighton from other publishers.</p>
<p>After a period of soaring advances and several big
write-downs in the industry, publishers had been holding the
line on authors' advances recently. But the Archer auction
and the recent news that another publisher is paying $12
million for two novels by Ken Follett show that for name
writers, the bidding wars aren't over.</p>
<p>"This has always been a business of stars, and it's now
that way more so than ever," says Morton Janklow, whose
agency represents such stars as Danielle Steel and Jackie
Collins. "About half the trade books are sold in chain stores
now, and they favor best sellers. As the publishing houses
continue to consolidate, there is more money out there and
it's chasing a small number of proven stars."</p>
