	<p class="article-leader">GREENWICH, Conn. -- United Parcel Service of America Inc.,
the world's largest package-delivery company, agreed to buy
as much as 17.4% of fast-growing Mail Boxes Etc. Inc., San
Diego.
   A spokesman for closely held UPS said the company "derives
a substantial amount of business" from Mail Boxes Etc. and
similar companies. Mail Boxes Etc., targeting particularly
small businesses, operates a chain of franchised storefronts
offering services including post boxes, phone answering,
faxing, copying and funds transfer by wire.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In turn, Mail Boxes Etc. franchisees derive 40% to 50% of
their total revenue by acting as drop-off points for
customers who want UPS to deliver their packages, said A.W.
DeSio, Mail Boxes Etc.'s vice chairman and chief executive
officer. The franchisees also can take drop-offs for UPS
competitors.</p>
<p>UPS agreed to pay $25.25 for each of 400,000 shares of
Mail Boxes Etc., a total $10.1 million. UPS also would buy
400,000 warrants, each exercisable into one Mail Boxes Etc.
share, for about $1.2 million, or $2.92 apiece. UPS can
exercise the warrants over three years at prices of $27 to
$38.88 a share; if it exercises the warrants it would hold
17.4% of Mail Boxes Etc.</p>
<p>In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Mail Boxes
Etc. shares jumped $3 to $25.</p>
<p>The agreement, subject to UPS doing a due-diligence review
of Mail Boxes Etc.'s operations and a definitive agreement,
also allows UPS to boost its stake to as much as 35% after
one year. UPS would get a seat on Mail Boxes Etc.'s board,
which currently has seven members.</p>
<p>The agreement will provide capital for Mail Boxes Etc.'s
growth; it has been adding about one new outlet a day for the
past year, Mr. DeSio said. The company has issued licenses to
franchise its name, trademarks and system in Canada and
Japan.</p>
<p>"UPS has done nothing in {its} ground system and little in
the air system on their own to facilitate retail access to
their" services, said Paul Schlesinger of Donaldson, Lufkin &
Jenrette Securities Corp. The pact with Mail Boxes Etc. might
be "a means of exercising some influence" over a network of
drop-off centers for the infrequent, retail user of package
delivery.</p>
<p>In March, Mail Boxes Etc. agreed to act as agent
exclusively for DHL Worldwide Express for domestic and
international overnight package delivery. That agreement,
which runs for a year, won't be affected.</p>
