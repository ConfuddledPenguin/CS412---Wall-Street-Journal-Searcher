	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Revlon Inc. owner Ronald Perelman plans to
sell stock valued at up to $182.1 million in National Health
Laboratories Inc. in a move to repay bank debt and highlight
the value of Revlon's assets.
   The proposed public sale of 13 million shares of National
Health Laboratories, a Revlon subsidiary, follows the
restructuring in May of a $1.8 billion bank loan to Revlon.
Revisions in the loan agreement boosted the amount Revlon
must repay by 1992 to $650 million from $150 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Although some bankers said the bank-loan change was
designed to force Revlon to sell assets to make the
repayment, aides to Mr. Perelman said he was free to repay
the debt any way he could, including through asset sales or
refinancing.</p>
<p>Mr. Perelman, who has operated Revlon with a heavy debt
load since acquiring the cosmetics and health care company in
a hostile takeover in late 1985, wants to reduce Revlon's
debt leverage in coming months, his aides say.</p>
<p>Some highly leveraged companies have faced financial
pressure in the past year following the collapse of the
market for high-yield, high-risk junk bonds and a reluctance
by banks to make loans for highly leveraged transactions. The
new bank loan for Revlon, which also has $800 million in junk
bonds outstanding, was classified a highly leveraged
transaction.</p>
<p>In the stock offering announced yesterday, Revlon plans to
reduce its stake in National Health, a medical testing
concern based in La Jolla, Calif., from 95% to 80%. Revlon
founded the company in 1968 in an effort to diversify its
core beauty business.</p>
<p>Revlon proposed a maximum offering price of $14.50 a
share, the price at which National Health's stock closed on
Friday.</p>
<p>The stock to be offered consists of 12.6 million shares
owned by Revlon and 441,358 shares owned by Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc., the securities firm which financed the Revlon
takeover but whose parent earlier this year sought
bankruptcy-law protection from creditors.</p>
<p>Some bankers applauded Mr. Perelman's move. "A transaction
like this demonstrates the liquidity of Perelman-controlled
assets," said Michael Zarrilli, a managing director of
Manufacturers Hanover Corp., one of the four lead banks on
the new Revlon loan.</p>
<p>The stock of National Health Laboratories declined $1.25 a
share to $13.25 a share in national over-the-counter trading
yesterday. With 99 million shares outstanding, that implied a
market value of $1.31 billion for the entire company.</p>
<p>Some analysts believe that boosting the percentage of
stock traded publicly from 5% to 20% could increase the
accuracy of market value indicated by the stock price. Revlon
sold 5% of the company in 1988.</p>
<p>Joel M. Ray, a health care industry analyst at Smith
Barney, Harris Upham & Co., said the stock offering should be
positive for the price because the increased number of shares
will make it more accessible to institutional investors.</p>
<p>Since 1985, National Health's revenue has grown 24%
annually and its earnings have grown 31% annually. In 1989,
its earnings were $64.7 million, or 65 cents a share, on
revenues of $402.4 million. Mr. Ray estimates the company
will earn 80 cents a share this year on revenue of $500
million.</p>
