	<p class="article-leader">Kuhlman Corp., Troy, Mich., said it completed the sale of
its plastics operations to the U.S. subsidiary of Solvay &
Cie., a Brussels-based chemical corporation, in a transaction
valued at about $30.6 million plus the assumption of $14.5
million in debt and other liabilities.
   The deal leaves Kuhlman primarily a maker of electrical
transformers. The Kuhlman Plastics Group made, among other
things, plastic fuel tanks for General Motors Corp.'s
Chevrolet Corsica and Beretta cars. But Kuhlman officials
said the continuing slump in U.S. auto sales has been
reducing the profitability of the plastics operations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The April sale agreement called for Solvay America Inc. to
pay about $24.4 million immediately, with about $6.3 million
deferred over five years. The price had been subject to
change upon the closing of the deal, but Kuhlman didn't
disclose whether the payment was altered.</p>
<p>A Kuhlman spokesman said the company will elaborate on its
future plans and uses for the proceeds from the sale in a
forthcoming interim report.</p>
