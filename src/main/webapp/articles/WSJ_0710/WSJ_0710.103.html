	<p class="article-leader">Jury duty is becoming a fact of life for a rapidly growing
percentage of Americans, according to a new national survey.
   Forty-five percent of adults in the U.S. have been called
at least once for jury duty, up from 35% in 1984, according
to the study by the consulting firm of Research & Forecasts,
Inc.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Jury scholars link the increase to innovations in court
administration, including better methods of identifying and
finding potential jurors and greater efforts to limit the
length of most jurors' service.</p>
<p>The survey's sponsor, a group of corporate defense lawyers
called the Defense Research Institute, also suggests that the
expanded need for jurors may be a byproduct of increased
litigiousness in the society. Archie Robinson, president of
DRI, says more cases are being filed and prepared for trial
than in the past. In addition, he says, a higher percentage
are high-stakes cases that often take a long time to try. In
such cases, he says, it's customary to call a larger pool of
potential jurors, since many will be unable to serve in a
long case and will have to be disqualified.</p>
<p>But jury researchers dispute Mr. Robinson's conclusion.
Marc Galanter, a litigation expert at the University of
Wisconsin law school, says available data in several large
states indicates that the number of civil jury trials did not
increase between 1984 and 1988. In federal court, there were
5,555 civil jury trials in 1984 and 5,676 in 1989, he said.</p>
<p>Any increased need for jurors, Mr. Galanter says, is
probably the result of "a lot more of an intent to use jurors
efficiently." He adds, "In a lot of places they instituted a
one trial, one day system, so they call more people and don't
keep them sitting as long."</p>
<p>Under such a system, a person is called for a single day,
and if he is not assigned to a trial that day he is not
required to return. If the person is selected for a longer
trial, he must serve for the duration of that trial. The one
day, one trial system is now used in jurisdictions that
embrace about 25% of the U.S. population, according to an
estimate by Thomas Munsterman, director of the Center for
Jury Studies of the National Center for State Courts.</p>
<p>Mr. Munsterman says that another reason more people are
being called for jury duty is that many courts are expanding
their methods of finding potential jurors. While most
jurisdictions used to rely primarily on voter-registration
lists, in recent years many have added back-up lists,
including driving records. Drivers' lists generally include
90%-95% of adults, while only about 70% of adults are
registered to vote in most areas, Mr. Munsterman says.</p>
<p>In other findings, the Defense Research Institute survey
determined that people with incomes over $40,000 a year are
much more likely to be called for jury duty than those with
incomes income of less than $40,000. In addition, men are
slightly more likely to be called than women.</p>
<p>The survey also found that most people who are called on
to serve only sit and wait; with most potential jurors
disqualified for one reason or another before trial, only 17%
of adult Americans get to serve on a jury in an actual trial.</p>

<p>WOMEN HARD HATS win an unusual settlement with
construction company.</p>
<p>Tishman Construction Corp. was sued for alleged sex
discrimination in 1988 by several female construction workers
and by a group that trains women for blue-collar jobs. To
settle the suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, Tishman
recently agreed to begin hiring women for one out of every
three available laborer jobs.</p>
<p>Tishman, a construction-site manager, said that under the
settlement its goal will be for women to make up 10% of its
laborer work force. Currently, about 5% of Tishman's 197
laborers are women. According to Nontraditional Employment
for Women, or NEW, the group that helped bring the lawsuit,
women hold only 3% of all laborer jobs on construction site
in New York City.</p>
<p>NEW said it has a waiting list of 80 women looking for
construction jobs. A spokeswoman said the group hopes the 10%
goal will be reached within six months, although the
settlement doesn't provide a deadline for reaching that
level. The settlement is in effect for three years.</p>
<p>Henry Estrada, a Tishman vice president, said in a
statement: "While Tishman doesn't believe there has been
discrimination on its part in hiring women for laborer jobs,
we are pleased to join with NEW in additional efforts that
will result in more women entering the construction industry
labor force."</p>
<p>NEW said it isn't seeking special treatment for women but
wants to ensure that female job applicants are evaluated
fairly.</p>

<p>FORMER WEST VIRGINIA governor fails in motion to withdraw
guilty plea.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Walter E. Hoffman denied former Gov.
Arch A. Moore Jr.'s request to withdraw his guilty plea on
five felonies related to a scheme to extort money and to buy
votes. Sentencing is set for today.</p>
<p>In April, a Charleston grand jury accused Mr. Moore, a
three-time Republican governor of the predominantly
Democratic state of illegal activities while campaigning and
serving as governor.</p>
<p>Attorneys for the former governor maintained that his
guilty plea was "the result of a hasty decision forced by a
deadline imposed by the government."</p>

<p>McMARTIN child-abuse case goes to jury in retrial.</p>
<p>After hearing two months of testimony, jurors in Los
Angeles Superior Court yesterday began their task of deciding
whether Raymond Buckey is guilty of eight counts of child
molestation. The charges involve three girls who were once
pupils at the now-defunct Virginia McMartin Preschool in
Manhattan Beach, Calif., where Mr. Buckey was a teacher.</p>
<p>In January, after almost three months of deliberations and
28 months of testimony, another jury acquitted Mr. Buckey and
his mother Peggy McMartin Buckey on 52 of 65 counts of child
molestation. The jury was deadlocked on the remaining 13
counts. The prosecution later decided to retry Mr. Buckey on
eight of the unresolved counts.</p>
<p>Throughout both trials, Mr. Buckey, who was indicted in
March 1984 and has already served over four years in prison,
has proclaimed his innocence.</p>

<p>MULHEREN DELIBERATIONS CONTINUE: A federal court jury
began its second week of deliberations in the trial of John
A. Mulheren Jr. The jury is considering whether Mr. Mulheren,
the former chief of Jamie Securities Co., is guilty of
conspiracy, securities and mail fraud and keeping false
records. The government has alleged that Mr. Mulheren
conducted numerous illegal securities trades with Ivan F.
Boesky, the convicted former stock speculator. Leonard
DeStefano, a former assistant to Mr. Mulheren, was also
charged in the 30-count indictment. Jurors have asked
numerous times over the last week to have testimony from the
seven-week trial read to them and for definitions of various
trading terms. Deliberations are set to resume today.</p>
