	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Hanson PLC, a British industrial conglomerate,
said it sold its Baltimore Spice business to an affiliate of
Fuchs Gewuerze G.m.b.H., a West German seasonings and spice
maker, for $23.9 million.
   The sale includes the manufacturing operations of the Old
Bay Seasonings business, which Hanson bought in 1986 as part
of its $930 million acquisition of SCM, a U.S. conglomerate,
but Hanson will retain the retailing operations of the unit,
the company said.</p>
