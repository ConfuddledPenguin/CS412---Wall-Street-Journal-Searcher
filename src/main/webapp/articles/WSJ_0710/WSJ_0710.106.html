	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- Bernard Tapie, who has agreed to buy 80% of the
West German sporting goods empire Adidas AG, is one of the
most aggressive, controversial and politically ambitious
financiers in France.
   A lover of big yachts, big deals and splashy publicity,
Mr. Tapie now needs his bankers' help. Bankers close to him
say that because the Adidas purchase was handled in secrecy,
Mr. Tapie hasn't yet been able to put together the financing.
Although the price hasn't been disclosed, analysts estimate
that it is well in excess of the Tapie empire's total assets,
perhaps as much as three times the value of his main company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Tapie, one friend said, was sailing yesterday on a
90-foot yacht off the Spanish Mediterranean island of Ibiza.
Before he left World Cup soccer festivities in Rome, however,
the self-made son of a Paris working class family summed up
the purchase with typical gusto:</p>
<p>"For the first time, I have the probably unique chance to
realize my three biggest passions with one project: sports,
business and politics."</p>
<p>West Germans reacted with shock. Adidas employees said
they fear Mr. Tapie will do away with high-cost German jobs.
And the German establishment mourned the loss of a national
institution.</p>
<p>For the 47-year-old Mr. Tapie, the purchase would be the
latest in a series of high-profile victories. Mr. Tapie was
elected to parliament in 1988. Through repeated television
appearances, some as the host of a show seeking funds for
aspiring entrepreneurs, Mr. Tapie has become a symbol of
individual success.</p>
<p>"Tapie was the first to tell people, especially young
people, that he actively sought profit, that profit is good,"
said Pierre Despessailles, managing director of a Credit
Lyonnais affiliate called Societe de Banque Occidentale who
was one of the first bankers to back Mr. Tapie. "He has told
them, `I have made money, I live well, I manage to build
companies, and you can do the same.'"</p>
<p>French unions castigate Mr. Tapie as a profit-hungry
speculator who lays off workers, but he is received at the
presidential palace by Socialist President Francois
Mitterrand.</p>
<p>Mr. Tapie is an ardent opponent of far-right leader
Jean-Marie Le Pen. After he was widely judged the victor in a
television debate with Mr. Le Pen, French politicians began
whispering that he had begun aiming at high political office.
Asked by an interviewer recently whether he might like to
become prime minister, Mr. Tapie angrily rejected the notion,
but then added, "I never exclude anything."</p>
<p>Mr. Tapie told reporters in Rome that in his quest for
Adidas he had won over the four Dassler sisters, daughters of
Adidas founder Adi Dassler, one by one, in a secret
nine-month campaign. The sisters agreed to sell last
Wednesday. Adidas officials said Mr. Tapie now is talking to
the two children of their late brother, who control the
remaining 20%.</p>
<p>He will get one of the world's largest sporting goods
companies and much more. Selling its clothing, shoes and
equipment in 160 countries, Adidas has a brand recognition
almost as high as Mercedes-Benz. Some 80% of the participants
in the 1988 Olympic games were equipped by Adidas, as were 15
of the 24 teams in this year's soccer World Cup.</p>
<p>Sources close to Mr. Tapie say he now will be aiming for
one of the Dasslers' most influential holdings, which he
won't get as part of the Adidas purchase. That is their 51%
of ISL Marketing AG of Luzern, Switzerland. ISL, which is
49%-controlled by Japan's Dentsu advertising group, arranges
sponsors and financing for the Olympics and other
international sports events.</p>
<p>That, together with Adidas's dominance as a team
outfitter, gave former Chairman Horst Dassler huge influence,
extending to the choice of sites for games.</p>
<p>Mr. Dassler's 1987 death from cancer at the age of 51 is
widely viewed as a source of the company's current problems.
Adidas last year reportedly posted a 120 million mark loss
($72.6 million) on 4.6 billion marks in sales, although
management has projected a return to profitability this year.</p>
<p>The Adidas clout isn't lost on Mr. Tapie, who told
reporters that he hopes to use Adidas's political power to
ensure that France is chosen as the site for the 1998 World
Cup.</p>
<p>To win over the Dassler sisters, Mr. Tapie said, he
promised that he would end his old ways of firing managers,
improving financial performance and then reselling companies
for a quick gain. And he promised to continue the company
policy of creating and supporting sports training centers,
providing low-cost equipment to teams in the developing world
and sponsoring sports activities.</p>
<p>Mr. Tapie told the French newspaper Liberation that
promises of this kind helped him get a special price and that
he couldn't have afforded to outbid Japanese competitors in
an open auction.</p>
<p>"For them {the Dasslers}, it was out of the question that
a Japanese take control because they think in terms of
European culture and refuse to be eaten up by the two big
powers {the U.S. and Japan}," he told Liberation.</p>
<p>In a message sent to Adidas staff yesterday, he said the
current chairman, Rene Jaeggi, will remain in place.</p>
<p>Mr. Tapie's bankers said that despite any promises,
further layoffs are likely. Over the past four years, the
company has trimmed 5,000 jobs, and employs 9,500 currently.
Only 2,500 of those jobs are in high-cost West Germany.
Moreover, to help save money, Adidas produces only 14% of its
products itself. The rest are made under license in 19
countries outside West Germany.</p>
