	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stock prices moved higher as a late burst of
futures-related buying set the course for an otherwise
directionless market.
   Trading activity, which dropped to the lowest levels of
the year last week amid the observance of Independence Day,
remained light.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average, boosted by strong
performances from General Motors and International Business
Machines, gained 9.16 points to 2914.11 -- its seventh
advance in the past eight sessions.</p>
<p>Broader market measures also moved higher. Standard &
Poor's 500-Stock Index rose 1.10 to 359.52 and the New York
Stock Exchange Composite Index added 0.45 to 196.23.</p>
<p>Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by 764 to 673 on
the New York Stock Exchange, where 119,390,000 shares were
traded. By comparison, the Big Board's average daily volume
last week was 125.8 million shares, including just 111.7
million on Friday; both totals were 1990 lows.</p>
<p>Second-quarter earnings reports will begin flooding the
market late this week, and traders said nervousness about the
possibility that the data may produce some unpleasant
surprises kept investors on the sidelines.</p>
<p>"Everyone's in a holding pattern here; it's pretty
self-evident," said Christopher Pedersen, head of trading at
Twenty-First Securities. "A lot of people are leery about
those numbers coming out."</p>
<p>Last month, analysts' consensus earnings projections for
1990 were revised downward on 44.9% of the more than 3,000
companies that are followed by Nelson's Earnings Outlook, a
Port Chester, N.Y.based service.</p>
<p>Earnings forecasts for this year were revised upward on
only 27.6% of the companies, Nelson's reported, while the
other 27.5% were left unchanged.</p>
<p>Amid the earnings jitters, program buying linked to
stock-index arbitrage-buying baskets of stocks and selling
index-futures contracts to profit from price differences
between the two -- surfaced in early trading to help the
market rally to session highs. The industrial average peaked
with a gain of more than 15 points.</p>
<p>But the rally faded once the buy programs subsided, and
the market stood little changed from midday until two more
rounds of arbitrage buying lifted share prices in the last
hour of trading.</p>
<p>The programs hit the market amid the release of results
from the Treasury's weekly auction of three-month and
six-month bills, at which a record $18.04 billion of
securities were sold. Treasury notes and bonds bounced off
their lows following release of the auction results.</p>
<p>GM, whose Hughes Aircraft and Delco Electronics units
unveiled a new electronics joint venture, rallied 1 1/8 to
49. IBM rose 1 to 119, reflecting strength among major
technology issues; Compaq Computer rose 3 1/4 to 64 3/4,
Digital Equipment advanced 1 1/2 to 84 7/8 and Cray Research
gained 1 to 46.</p>
<p>Philip Morris dropped 3/8 to 48 7/8 in Big Board composite
trading of 2.7 million shares after a story in Barron's
magazine highlighted the problems facing the tobacco
industry, including anti-smoking sentiment world-wide and
cigarette-tax increases. Loews, the owner of Lorillard, eased
1 3/4 to 111 1/8 and Liggett Group fell 1/4 to 12 1/8, but
American Brands added 5/8 to 67 1/4 after trading as low as
65 7/8.</p>
<p>UAL climbed 4 3/8 to 157 1/8 after the company's unions
disclosed that Citicorp, Chase Manhattan, Bankers Trust New
York, Manufacturers Hanover and Chemical Banking have agreed
to lead the labor group's effort to obtain financing for
their proposed $4.38 billion buy-out of United Airlines,
UAL's major unit.</p>
<p>Wal-Mart Stores gained 1 1/2 to 32 3/4 on 2.7 million
shares on anticipation of a strong June sales report,
expected Thursday. Analysts estimate that last month's sales
at stores open at least a year were 10% to 14% higher than a
year ago, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor
Report. Separately, Wal-Mart agreed to acquire the book and
record distribution and warehousing units of Western
Merchandisers for stock valued at $28 million.</p>
<p>Wal-Mart Stores and Compaq Computer both advanced
yesterday after 2-for-1 stock splits. The post-split gains
may be a sign of avid buying by small investors, said Bernard
Schaeffer, executive director of the Investment Research
Institute in Cincinnati. "Stock splits are starting to
attract a wider spectrum of investor interest," he said.
Splits in Philip Morris, Federal National Mortgage
Association and Du Pont in the past year didn't result in a
surge of new buying interest, he added.</p>
<p>TCBY Enterprises dropped 1 5/8 to 15 1/2 on 1.9 million
shares after Shearson Lehman Hutton reduced its investment
rating on the stock for the second time since the July Fourth
holiday. In addition, analyst Caroline Levy lowered her
projections of the company's earnings for 1990 and 1991 to
last year's level of $1.10 a share.</p>
<p>She told the investor report her revised forecasts reflect
expectations that because of growing competition in the
frozen-yogurt market, the company will cut the price of
yogurt to its franchisees in the third quarter and
development of new stores will slow next year. A company
spokeswoman told the investor report that TCBY "strongly
disagrees" with Shearson's revised estimates and expects to
meet its target of about 400 new stores next year.</p>
<p>General Instrument went up 5/8 to 46 1/4. The company,
which has accepted a buyout offer of $44.50 a share from
Forstmann Little, disclosed that another party requested
certain financial information from it last week.</p>
<p>Quantum Chemical, which fell 1 1/4 Friday, dropped another
1 to 14 3/8 as Salomon Brothers and Mabon Nugent lowered
their estimates of the company's 1990 and 1991 earnings,
based on lower polyethelene prices. Goldman Sachs had reduced
its estimates Friday.</p>
<p>Crown Cork & Seal gained 2 1/4 to 63 1/8 following news
that Chairman John F. Connelly, 85 years old, died Sunday
night. Mr. Connelly had controlled a stake of about 17.6% in
the company, which hasn't paid a common-stock dividend since
1956, the year before he became chief executive.</p>
<p>Maytag gained 1/2 to 17 3/8. USA Today reported, without
elaborating, that Hanson PLC of Britain is rumored to be
eyeing the company as a possible takeover target.</p>
<p>Long Island Lighting went up 1/4 to 20 5/8. Standard &
Poor's raised its ratings on some of the company's debt
issues to investment grade, based on expectations that the
company will be able to end its involvement with the Shoreham
nuclear plant and on other factors.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 0.22
to 358.65. Volume totaled 11,520,000 shares.</p>
<p>B&H Ocean Carriers rose 7/8 to 12 7/8. An investor group
including the company's chairman, Arvid Bervall, disclosed
that it owns 8.28% of B&H's common shares.</p>
<p>Environmental stocks traded on the Amex also moved higher,
including Sanifill, which advanced 1 3/4 to 24 3/4. Alex.
Brown & Sons raised its rating on the stock to "aggressive
buy" from "buy" and boosted its 1990 and 1991 earnings
forecasts. Additionally, Air & Water Technologies climbed 2
to 30 and Chambers Development Class A gained 1 to 24 1/4.</p>
