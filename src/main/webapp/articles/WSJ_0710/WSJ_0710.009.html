	<p class="article-leader">PHILADELPHIA -- The Philadelphia Stock Exchange said it
plans to extend its trading day in foreign-currency options,
beginning Sept. 16.
   The exchange said its current 14-hour trading day will be
stretched to 19.5 hours during months of daylight-saving
time, to coincide with afternoon trading in the Far East and
in Pacific Rim countries. In fall and winter months, the
trading day will become 20.5 hours.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>New hours will run from 7 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. EDT the
following day. Current hours run from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. EDT
and from 4:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. EDT. During fall and winter,
trading will begin at 6 p.m. EST.</p>
<p>In September 1987, the exchange introduced an evening
trading session for foreign-currency options to accommodate
increased demand in the Far East. In January 1989, the
exchange added an early-morning session to accommodate the
European market.</p>
<p>Total daily volume in currency-option contracts traded on
the exchange has grown to represent about $2 billion in
underlying value.</p>
