	<p class="article-leader">MOSCOW -- Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev won a battle
over membership of the Politburo, advancing his campaign to
maintain control of the Communist Party while redesigning the
leadership.
   The Politburo now must include the general secretary, his
deputy, and the first secretaries of the Communist Parties of
each of the 15 republics. This lineup will bring more
reform-minded members onto the crucial policy-making body
while adding to the growing powers of the restive republics.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The new membership rules erode the traditional domination
of the Politburo by Russian hard-liners. Many of the
potential new members -- the regional first secretaries --
have a strong interest in fighting the power of the central
party in favor of their own region's independence. Many also
were put in place by Mr. Gorbachev over the past two years,
and therefore owe him allegiance.</p>
<p>However, one of the most powerful members of the new
Politburo will be a rising opponent of Mr. Gorbachev, Ivan
Polozkov, newly elected head of the Russian Communist Party.
Mr. Polozkov has been ambivalent about Mr. Gorbachev's
reforms.</p>
<p>"We are recognizing reality by strengthening the weight of
republican parties," said Mr. Gorbachev. "We are giving our
comrades working in the republics influence in the highest
leadership."</p>
<p>The new Politburo will also include some additional
members from the broader leadership body, the Central
Committee, which in turn would be elected by the party
congress. Mr. Gorbachev hinted that the size of the Politburo
might be expanded to 21 to 23 members. The present Politburo
has 12 voting members.</p>
<p>The plan passed overwhelmingly in the general vote, but
not until five hours had been spent debating its various
elements. The plan essentially revived an idea of Mr.
Gorbachev's that first won Central Committee approval in
February. Since then, however, the proposal has met
increasing resistance. Just last week, it seemed to be
derailed after a meeting of heads of party delegations --
largely conservative -- rejected the idea of an expanded
Politburo.</p>
<p>Conservatives feared the idea because it would sap their
strength in the party. Radicals were concerned that any
deputy positions might be held by conservatives who could
overpower a more moderate general secretary.</p>
<p>But delegates yesterday said that the general secretary
would probably propose several candidates of his own for the
deputy position. And most delegates say that Mr. Gorbachev is
almost sure to win any race for the top post.</p>
<p>The victory was a sample of Mr. Gorbachev's skillful
handling of the congress so far.</p>
<p>First, he took over the chairmanship of the rules
commission from Georgy Razumovsky, who had drafted an opening
set of new rules that were relatively hard-line. Today, Mr.
Gorbachev abruptly left the hall 20 minutes into the morning
session to return only minutes before the afternoon lunch
break, smiling broadly.</p>
<p>After the lunch break, Mr. Gorbachev explained that the
commission had yet to finish its full rules proposals, but
urged that the leadership question be settled first.</p>
<p>From the start of the congress, the question of the
Politburo structure was seen as key in the battle between
conservatives and reformers for control of the party.
Conservatives had wanted to maintain the status quo while
reformers wanted to broaden the Politburo, change its name to
"presidium" and call its chief "chairman" instead of "general
secretary." Yesterday's decision was a classic Gorbachev
compromise in which his opponents won on the language, but
reformers won on content.</p>
<p>Not all delegates were admiring of Mr. Gorbachev's
tactics. "If the whole congress votes for one chairman, he'll
stand to rule the whole Central Committee, like a king," said
Alexander Buzgalin, a leader of the Marxist Platform, a
subgroup within the party that wants certain democratic
reforms but believes in collective leadership. "In Mr.
Gorbachev we see some very clever stifling of delegates."</p>
<p>Some delegates insisted that the Politburo should include
representatives from each republic, but that candidates for
those posts should be elected separately, rather than
automatically being filled by party first secretaries. Others
feel that if republics are to be represented, then different
sectors of society such as workers and peasants should also
have their own representation in the leadership. These issues
are likely to prolong debate over the draft rules, said
Alexei Ilin, head of the congress secretariat.</p>
<p>All the wrangling has delayed the party agenda to such an
extent that few delegates expect the congress to conclude on
Thursday, as originally planned. "The congress is an
organism, not a machine," said delegate Nikolai Sakirko.
"There are almost 5,000 delegates and we keep encountering
different problems as we move on."</p>
