	<p class="article-leader">National Intergroup Inc., Pittsburgh, said it agreed to
raise to $3.85 the price it will pay for each cumulative
convertible preference unit of Permian Partners L.P.
   The increased purchase price, up from the original $3.75
offer, is part of its settlement of litigation related to its
tender offer for Permian.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>National Intergroup began a tender offer in May, but the
purchase price was subject to reduction on a per-unit basis
to reflect any distributions on the preference units.</p>
<p>Under the settlement, National Intergroup said it won't
reduce the price to reflect the regular quarterly
distribution for the quarter ended June 30.</p>
<p>The settlement is subject to approval by the Delaware
Court of Chancery.</p>
<p>National Intergroup is an oil transportation and aluminum
and steel fabrication company. Permian Partners is a limited
partnership involved in oil and gas gathering and marketing.</p>
