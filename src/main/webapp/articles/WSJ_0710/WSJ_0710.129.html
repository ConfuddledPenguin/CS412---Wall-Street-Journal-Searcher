	<p class="article-leader">International Business Machines Corp. is considering
licensing some cutting-edge chip technology to Motorola Inc.,
industry executives said.
   The move would help Motorola hedge a huge bet it has made
in the memory-chip area. It also would give IBM another
domestic supplier of memory chips, and it would help
strengthen the beleaguered U.S. semiconductor industry.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The pairing would be a natural one, because IBM and
Motorola already have a research agreement covering some
advanced semiconductor technology. Any agreement also would
continue a trend in which IBM has shared its semiconductor
technology with U.S. and European companies to strengthen
them against Japanese competitors that IBM fears may become
too powerful.</p>
<p>For instance, the technology that would be licensed to
Motorola -- for four-megabit dynamic random access memory
chips, or DRAMS, the densest now in commercial use -- is
already licensed to Micron Technology Inc. IBM also had
planned to license the technology to U.S. Memories, the
ill-fated consortium of U.S. chip makers and consumers.</p>
<p>Both Motorola and IBM declined to confirm or otherwise
comment on their licensing negotiations, which were first
reported yesterday in the New York Times.</p>
<p>Some consultants and securities analysts speculated that
Motorola is attempting to reduce its dependence on Toshiba
Corp., with which it already has an agreement covering chip
technology. They said that Motorola may be trying to protect
the huge investments it has made in DRAM factories in the
event that there are problems with implementing Toshiba's
design. By licensing the IBM design, Motorola would be simply
lining up a backup technology to ensure that those factories
get up and running, they said.</p>
<p>"Motorola is making way too big a bet to depend on a
single technology, especially one from a partner that's 6,000
miles away," said Drew Peck of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette
Securities Corp. "This way, either Toshiba's or IBM's
technology will come through, and they'll be okay."</p>
<p>Analysts also speculated that the Motorola move may put a
damper on the recent rush by U.S. companies to find Japanese
partners. Five major U.S.-Japanese joint ventures in
semiconductors have been announced since January.</p>
<p>"This certainly is going to cause some people to think
twice about the commitments they're making," said Will
Strauss of Forward Concepts Co., a Tempe, Ariz.,
market-research firm.</p>
<p>Like some other analysts, Mr. Strauss pointed to a growing
perception that Japanese companies may be getting the better
deal in such technology-sharing partnerships. "If it turns
out that Motorola isn't happy with a relationship that's a
few years old, people will be more cautious about getting
into these deals," he said.</p>
<p>Officials from both Motorola and Toshiba denied any
discord between their companies. "Toshiba has been a very
honorable, very equitable partner," a Motorola spokesman
said.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Motorola shares closed at $85.50, up 37.5 cents.</p>
