	<p class="article-leader">Regulators in the District of Columbia granted Potomac
Electric Power Co. a rate increase of $9.5 million, about
one-fourth of the $38.5 million increase the utility
requested last September.
   The Public Service Commission also cut the Washington
utility's rate of return on equity to 12.35% from 13%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The commission said it denied most of Potomac Electric's
requested increase because the company has not been
aggressive enough in encouraging customers to conserve
electricity. The company recently began a five-year program
to encourage conservation through $90 million in customer
rebates and incentives.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the utility said the 1.6% increase is
"totally inadequate to meet the company's needs." The
spokeswoman noted that the commission has ordered rate
decreases of about $50 million since 1984 for tax and other
reasons.</p>
<p>The rate increase, the company's first since 1984, was
intended to cover "all those costs that have gone up" because
of inflation, the spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>The company said it will consider its options, including
an appeal, while waiting for the commission's final order,
expected in about two weeks.</p>
