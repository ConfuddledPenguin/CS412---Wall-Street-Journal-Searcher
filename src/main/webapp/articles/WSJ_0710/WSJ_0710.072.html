	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Courtney F. Jones, Merrill Lynch & Co.'s chief
financial officer until last year, said he is leaving the big
securities firm by year-end.
   Mr. Jones, 50 years old, is now a senior investment banker
and a Merrill director. He gave up the chief financial
officer's position a year ago after four years on the job.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Looking back, Mr. Jones said that when he resigned as
chief financial officer, he thought Merrill Lynch was "in
pretty good shape." But instead, he said, "The world really
died." Mr. Jones's successor, Thomas H. Patrick, has gone on
to spearhead Merrill's huge retrenchment efforts that gave it
a net loss of $213.4 million last year and has included
thousands of layoffs.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch Chairman William Schreyer and President
Daniel Tully said in a statement that they were sorry to see
Mr. Jones go, but that they understood his desire to "seek
new professional challenges."</p>
<p>Mr. Jones said he's looking for a chief operating officer
position, or something similar, on or off Wall Street. He
said he enjoys working at big, public firms like Merrill or
his previous employer for 23 years, General Motors Corp. But
Mr. Jones said he is through being a chief financial officer.
"It's fundamentally an advisory role," he said, rather than
an "operating officer role, where the job is more directing
strategy of the firm."</p>
<p>As for Merrill and its recent troubles, Mr. Jones said he
is optimistic about the firm's future despite the overall
slowdown in investment banking and brokerage.</p>
<p>"Some parts of our business are very much under fire," Mr.
Jones said. "But all in all, I think Merrill Lynch is very
well positioned for the future; it just appears we've got a
ways to go to get through this period of softness."</p>
