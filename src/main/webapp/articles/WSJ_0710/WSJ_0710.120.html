	<p class="article-leader">Britain's S.G. Warburg Group PLC named Nicholas Verey, an
international stocks and corporate-finance specialist,
chairman of its U.S. operations. He succeeds David Brooke,
who is retiring from the firm.
   The appointment, said executives at the British investment
and money-management firm, makes the 47-year-old Mr. Verey
one of five people who have a clear shot at succeeding Sir
David Scholey as chairman of the parent company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As head of the U.S. unit, Mr. Verey inherits the
leadership of what many consider one of the best
foreign-owned securities firms on Wall Street. And unlike
many of its American competitors, S.G. Warburg & Co. is
hiring. "We can always do with a few more good people," said
Mr. Verey, who plans to strengthen the U.S. operation's
ability to market investment-banking services and its
international equity capabilities.</p>
<p>Mr. Brooke's departure was unexpected, some employees
said. They said he has expressed a desire to join a smaller
firm, similar to Rowe & Pittman Ltd., the brokerage firm he
had joined before it was bought by Warburg in 1986. Mr.
Brooke couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Under his leadership, the U.S. unit grew to just under 300
people from about 250 a year ago. The firm also lured an
international leasing team away from Chase Manhattan Bank and
hired a group of private placement specialists from
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. Two years ago, it became a
primary dealer, joining an elite group of 43 firms that trade
with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York when it buys and
sells U.S. government securities as part of its activities to
influence U.S. monetary policy.</p>
<p>Mr. Verey said he plans to capitalize on what he believes
is a growing distaste for hostile acquisitions in the U.S.
and American investors' expanding appetite for foreign
securities. "There's going to be a great deal of money
flowing into Europe over the next 10 years, and one of the
biggest pools of available money is right here."</p>
<p>That wasn't always the case. In 1974, Mr. Verey was a key
part of the firm's efforts to sell U.S. institutions on the
merits of investing in foreign stocks. With few exceptions,
he says: "The reaction was interesting and amusing, but they
didn't take us seriously."</p>
<p>At the time, the capitalization of the U.S. stock market
was about 65% of the world's total. But now it's only 34%,
according to Morgan Stanley Capital International. Meanwhile,
U.S. institutions have discovered foreign stock markets in a
big way, especially with the planned 1992 abolition of trade
and investment barriers between the 12 countries of the
European Community and the opening of Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Warburg also has a growing mergers and acquisitions
capability -- it advised Ford Motor Co. on its $2.55 billion
acquisition of Jaguar PLC in November 1989 -- that Mr. Verey
believes he can capitalize on in light of what he said is the
changing attitude of Americans toward hostile takeovers.</p>
<p>"There's going to be a barbarians' backlash," he said.
U.S. takeover style will become more like that in Britain,
where a takeover target and its institutional investors
discuss the company's long-range prospects, he predicted. And
if that does happen, Mr. Verey said Warburg should benefit.
"We are used to being involved in takeovers that are fought
over in discussion; some of the skills we have in the U.K.
and Europe will be applicable here," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Verey joined Rowe & Pittman at age 18 after graduating
from Eton College, rising through the ranks at Rowe & Pittman
until the firm was acquired by Warburg. In 1987 he became a
member of the parent company's board and most recently was in
charge of strategic planning, a responsibility he retains.</p>
<p>Last spring, Mr. Verey spent three months at an executive
education program at Harvard University's Business School.
"David Scholey wouldn't let me loose in the U.S. without a
proper education," he said.</p>
