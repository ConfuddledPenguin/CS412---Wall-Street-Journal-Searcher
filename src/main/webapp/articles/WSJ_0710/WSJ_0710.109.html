	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a
civil lawsuit in federal court in Manhattan alleging that
Peter E. Butler, currently a securities analyst at First
Boston Corp., violated securities laws in recommending the
stock of Memory Metals Inc. in 1985 and 1986.
   Mr. Butler, a vice president at First Boston, a unit of CS
First Boston Inc., was a vice president in the research
department of PaineWebber Inc. until about January 1987. A
First Boston spokesman said the suit pertains to Mr. Butler's
actions while at PaineWebber and that First Boston isn't a
party to it.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Warren Colodner, an attorney for Mr. Butler, said, "Mr.
Butler cooperated fully in the SEC investigation and he
believes he did nothing wrong." Mr. Colodner said the SEC
began its investigation in 1986.</p>
<p>PaineWebber declined comment.</p>
<p>In the lawsuit, the SEC seeks a court order barring Mr.
Butler from violating securities laws. It also asks the court
to order him to turn over all the profits from the alleged
wrongdoing involving the stock of Memory Metals, which later
changed its name to Memry Corp.</p>
<p>The SEC said Memory Metals had only nominal sales and
sustained losses during the period of alleged wrongdoing. The
agency alleges that Mr. Butler misled investors and committed
fraud to encourage the sale of Memory Metals securities. The
SEC also alleged that Mr. Butler had bought Memory Metals
stock for his own account and was selling his shares while
recommending that others buy.</p>
<p>The SEC said that Mr. Butler made predictions as to
specific price increases and other business developments
"without a reasonable basis and while knowing, or reckless
and not knowing, that such statements were materially false
or misleading."</p>
<p>The SEC also said that Mr. Butler failed to disclose
information about the risk of investing in Memory Metals and
problems at the company.</p>
<p>The First Boston spokesman said the firm has been aware of
the SEC investigation for several years. "Peter Butler is an
employee in good standing," the spokesman said. "We have
reviewed the allegations in depth with both Mr. Butler and
his outside counsel. Mr. Butler denies the allegations and we
support his decision to defend himself."</p>
