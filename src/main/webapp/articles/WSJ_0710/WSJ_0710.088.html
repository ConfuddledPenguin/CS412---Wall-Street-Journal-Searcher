	<p class="article-leader">Sugar prices dropped precipitously yesterday in the face
of reports predicting higher production levels than
previously expected.
   The October contract settled at 11.90 cents a pound, off
0.69 cent. It had opened trading about 0.17 cents a pound
below Friday's close. The opening price was also the high for
the day, but the contract quickly dropped under pressure from
commodity funds liquidating long positions.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Before the market opened, a report from the European
Community estimated that the Western Europe beet crop would
increase by less than 1%, or 106,000 metric tons, from an
earlier estimate. Also yesterday,the Brazilian government
authorized a sugar output for the 1990-91 crop year of 6.85
million metric tons, up from its previous authorization of
6.44 million metric tons.</p>
<p>"Those two bits of news were very poor excuses to sell the
market off 0.69 cent," said Judith Ganes, sugar analyst at
Merrill Lynch Futures in New York. Rather, she said, "I think
the whole move down has been because of speculative selling
and fund liquidation."</p>
<p>Ms. Ganes said she thought that the market wasn't aware
yet of more, potentially bearish news contained in yet
another production report dated yesterday by F.O. Licht, a
German firm that prepares world-wide crop estimates for
sugar.</p>
<p>The new Licht report estimates that West European beet
production for the 1990-91 crop year could increase by as
much as one million metric tons over the 1989-90 harvest,
Barring any unforeseen weather disasters,. The new report
also predicts that the crop in Eastern Europe could increase,
but there is more uncertainty concerning that forecast.</p>
<p>Ms. Ganes said the Brazilian announcement should have had
little or no effect on prices since the U.S. Agriculture
Department had pegged the Brazilian crop at 7.5 million
metric tons, while Licht had estimated it at 8.2 million
tons.</p>
<p>Harry Schwartz, commodity analyst at Cargill Investors
Services in New York, said he was surprised by the Brazilian
authorization news. "I thought they would make a bearish
announcement like that only in a rising market, never in a
market that had sold off more than 0.70 cent on Thursday and
Friday," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Schwartz also pointed out that sugar's price decline
gained momentum by stop-loss orders that were triggered as
the selling ensued. "If we have a couple of more closes under
12 cents, I think that will generate some additional
computer-generated selling by funds," he said.</p>
<p>Arthur Stevenson, sugar analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities, attributed the market decline to waves of
technical selling that took out the low prices set four weeks
ago. He said he would not be surprised to see the market drop
to the area of 11.50 cents to 11.25 cents a pound.</p>
<p>Ms. Ganes said that though the crop outlook has improved
and the supply-demand balance is certainly not going to be as
tight as previously feared, it doesn't mean the market is
approaching a condition of great surplus. "Any problems with
production and this market could rebound in a hurry," she
added.</p>
<p>The new Licht report pointed out that consumption this
year was kept artificially low in certain countries because
of tight supplies. It concluded that an increase in output in
those countries does not necessarily mean a sharp addition to
stocks, but is likely to go directly into consumption.</p>
<p>In other commodity markets yesterday:</p>
<p>GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Mixed weather forecasts calling for
possible resurgence of cool, moist conditions in some Midwest
growing regions halted last week's slide in the price of corn
futures contracts. Concern that the weather might hinder
pollination of the young crop helped corn futures prices to
bounce back. After declining sharply Thursday and Friday, the
price of the December corn contract was up slightly
yesterday. For soybean futures, weather forecasts had less
impact, as the price of the November contract declined 3.25
cents a bushel. That's because the soybean crop has longer to
develop, and any short-term wet weather is less likely to
damage it, said Richard Loewy, president of AgResource Co.,
Chicago. An additional drain on the price of soybeans is
competition from growers in South America, he said.</p>
<p>LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Prices of pork belly futures
contracts fell the daily limit of two cents a pound yesterday
on higher-than-expected slaughtering of hogs. Traders expect
a cold storage report due out today to show lower-than-normal
movement of frozen bellies, which are used to make bacon, out
of cold storage, because of the over-supply of fresh bellies
from slaughter, said Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling
Research, Arlington Heights, Ill. "We think that pork prices
overall made their highs earlier than normal this year," Mr.
Morgan said. "Normally they peak in July or August, and this
year we think they peaked in May and June." Pork prices
became so high in those months, he said, that consumers
turned away from pork in favor of beef and chicken.</p>
<p>COTTON: Prices continued the sell-off that began last
week. Yesterday was the last trading day for the expiring
July contract, which, after setting a high of 92.20 cents a
pound, closed at 90 cents. Some traders had expected price
fireworks in the expiring contract, but one analyst
characterized the expiration as a non-event. The October
contract, which has characteristics of both the old crop and
the new crop, set a high of 79.16 cents for the day and then
reversed direction. It spent most of the day at 76.74 cents,
down two cents, the daily limit that cotton prices are
permitted to rise or fall. At the close, it was estimated
that there were 200 contracts offered at the limit price. The
new-crop December contract opened in a price range just above
Friday's close, and then rallied to 74.35 cents before
commission houses and independent traders forced it down the
limit. It managed to rebound slightly and settle at 71.95
cents, down 1.67 cents. Thomas Mueller, cotton specialist at
Merrill Lynch Futures in New York, says the market is
probably reacting to forecasts for rain for later in the week
in West Texas, the Delta and the Southeast. He also said that
many in the market had written off the West Texas crop, but
that he thought it was far too early to take such a stance.
"I expect a great Delta crop," he added.</p>
