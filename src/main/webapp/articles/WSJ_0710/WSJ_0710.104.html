	<p class="article-leader">VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Fast-growing WIC Western
International Communications Ltd. said it agreed to acquire
the media holdings of Alberta entrepreneur Dr. Charles Allard
in a cash and stock transaction valued at about 157.4 million
Canadian dollars (US$135.5 million).
   The proposed purchase would add two Alberta television
stations, as well as western Canada's Superchannel
pay-television service, and various production assets to
WIC's existing stable of radio, television, and satellite
communications operations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It is a major acquisition. It would make WIC one of the
largest, if not the largest, private broadcasting concern in
Canada," said Barry Gruman, a Montreal-based communications
analyst with First Marathon Securities Ltd.</p>
<p>The purchase, which requires regulatory approval, would
also bolster WIC's position as western Canada's dominant
broadcaster, which it secured last year with its C$200
million purchase of broadcasting assets from Toronto's
Maclean Hunter Ltd.</p>
<p>WIC agreed to acquire Edmonton, Alberta, television
station CITV, and Red Deer, Alberta, television station CKRD,
for C$90.8 million, as well as various related production and
other assets for C$19.1 million.</p>
<p>WIC also agreed to acquire, for about 3.7 million new WIC
Class B nonvoting common shares, all of the shares of
Superchannel's parent, closely held Allarcom Pay Television
Ltd., that WIC didn't previously own. Under prior agreements,
WIC had acquired 21% of Allarcom's common shares.</p>
<p>Mr. Allard, an Edmonton financier who built his
communications holdings after successes in real estate, holds
with his family a controlling stake in Superchannel and the
Alberta television stations.</p>
<p>In Toronto Stock Exchange trading yesterday, WIC's Class B
shares closed at C$13, up 12.5 Canadian cents, giving the
stock component of the transaction an indicated value of
C$47.5 million. Mr. Allard will hold an equity stake of about
22% in WIC once the transaction closes, a WIC executive said.
Mr. Allard and his son will also become WIC directors.</p>
<p>The transaction, which isn't expected to close until at
least the end of the year, would reunite WIC's
expansion-minded president and chief executive, Douglas
Holtby, with his former boss, Mr. Allard. Mr. Holtby joined
WIC about a year ago after serving as president of Mr.
Allard's broadcast operations.</p>
<p>During his tenure at Allarcom, Mr. Holtby helped it score
some successes on the production side, most notably with
SCTV, a comedy program produced by Edmonton station CITV that
was subsequently picked up in the U.S. by the NBC network.</p>
