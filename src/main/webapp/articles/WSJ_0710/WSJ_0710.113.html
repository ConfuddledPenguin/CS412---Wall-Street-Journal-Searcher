	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Over the protest of the American Postal
Workers Union, Postmaster General Anthony Frank will announce
today plans to hire contractors outside the Post Office to
encode a big chunk of the mail for automation.
   While the Postal Service refers to the plan as
"preliminary," Moe Biller, the union president, contended the
plan isn't preliminary, but final. He said the announcement
was sparked by a grievance the union filed against the idea
June 28.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A Postal Service spokesman said there is no connection
between the grievance and the agency's announcement, however.</p>
<p>Hardware for the remote bar coding system will be supplied
by the winning bidder among three potential suppliers, Postal
Service officials said at a news conference. The companies
are Bell & Howell Co., Skokie, Ill.; TRW Inc., Cleveland; and
AEG Electrocom, Konstanz, West Germany. The service wouldn't
estimate how much the equipment might cost.</p>
<p>Awards to furnish the equipment will probably be made near
the end of this year, the officials said. Plans are to
install 295 systems at 220 post offices by the end of 1995,
said Peter Jacobson, an assistant postmaster general. The
contractor will do the coding at another location, using an
electronic hookup to the post office. Bids to run the remote
coding operation will probably be solicited in September,
with contract awards in February or March, he said.</p>
<p>Officials said the contracting out will save the Postal
Service $10 to $12 per work hour, or $4.3 billion over the 10
years the new equipment is expected to function. But Mr.
Frank has insisted that no regular postal worker will lose
his or her job because of the move to contract out the work;
instead, those who sort mail manually or on mechanical
equipment now will be retrained for other jobs, officials
said.</p>
<p>To which Mr. Biller said, "They're not doing anybody a
favor." Those employees will become surplus, and costly to
retain, while outside contractors take over some of the work,
he argued.</p>
<p>The Postal Service hopes remote encoding will help the
service fully automate mail processing by 1995. It will be
needed for about 20% of the letters going through the postal
system -- those that lack full, clear addresses that can be
read by the service's optical scanning machines.</p>
<p>About 80% of the mail will have bar codes, representing
nine-digit address numbers, imprinted by mailing customers or
by bar-code machines at the post office, the Postal Service
hopes. Letters with the codes can be sorted rapidly by
machine.</p>
<p>Under the new system, letters without customer-printed bar
codes or which optical character readers cannot read and
imprint with bar codes will be shunted aside. Images of the
envelopes will be transmitted to another site, where
operators will read them and put address data into a
computer, which will also provide coding information for the
letter.</p>
<p>Using that data, machines back at the post office will
print the bar codes on the envelope. Pilot remote coding
operations are planned for post offices in Garden City, N.Y.,
by Bell & Howell, and Louisville, Ky., by TRW, in the next
two months, officials said. The New York coding site is about
a mile from the Garden City post office, and the Louisville
location is about 10 miles away.</p>
