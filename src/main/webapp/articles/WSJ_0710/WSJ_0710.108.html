	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Less than a week before the July 15
deadline set by Pic `N' Save Corp. to receive acquisition
bids for the company, a partnership controlled by investor
David H. Batchelder appeared to back away from earlier
indications that it would submit a bid.
   Girard Partners Limited Partnership said in a filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission that such an
acquisition would require additional equity beyond what its
partners have committed, as well as debt financing. Girard
said there can be no assurance that it will make an offer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Girard also said that it will renew its proxy solicitation
to gain control of Pic 'N' Save's board if the Dominguez,
Calif.-based discount retailer hasn't entered into an
agreement to sell itself by July 15. Pic 'N' Save and Girard
declared a truce last month while management conducts its
sale auction.</p>
<p>In the filing, Girard said that if its nominees are
elected to Pic 'N' Save's board, they wouldn't expect to seek
an immediate sale of the company, but would attempt to
increase stockholder value through the management and
operation of the company as an ongoing business.</p>
<p>Girard said it may decide to sell its stock and drop its
pursuit of Pic 'N' Save if its proxy fight fails. However,
Girard didn't rule out taking other steps, either alone or
with other shareholders, to obtain control of the company.
Girard holds a 6.7% stake in Pic 'N' Save, and Bill M.
Thomas, a Girard nominee, holds an additional 4%.</p>
<p>A Pic 'N' Save spokesman declined to comment on the
filing. In La Jolla, Calif., Mr. Batchelder didn't return
telephone calls for elaboration on the partnership's
intentions.</p>
<p>Pic 'N' Save shares closed yesterday at $11.75, off 25
cents.</p>
