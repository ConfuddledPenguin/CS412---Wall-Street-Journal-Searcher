	<p class="article-leader">As I write this comment on Arthur Schlesinger Jr.'s June
21 editorial-page piece, "FDR Vindicated," my reaction has
progressed from astonished to stunned. That anyone, Pulitzer
Prize winner or casual observer, would be so devoid of
objective thinking as to attempt to assign credit for what is
happening in the world today to FDR's vision is absurd. In my
view, it is on the same intellectual plane as giving credit
to Hitler for the great economic surge that occurred after
World War II because he was the one who started the war.
   Mr. Schlesinger's statements that FDR was not naive rely
heavily for support on FDR's credentials as a politician. I
submit that a person can be politically astute and at the
same time extremely naive when it comes to foreign policy. A
number of examples, even in our recent history, can be cited
to support this contention.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Schlesinger fails to give any recognition to the
succession of dedicated leaders from Harry Truman to Ronald
Reagan who believed in and pursued a foreign policy of
"containment" regarding the communist world. This constant
pressure through more than 40 years imposed an economic
burden, crowned by the Reagan administration's rejection of
detente in favor of renewed military preparedness, which
ultimately led to the unraveling of the communist-bloc
economies. To imply that all of this movement toward market
economies, democracy and free enterprise can be explained by
"the Soviet Union is at last honoring the Yalta agreements"
and is the result of some grand vision by FDR is at least
fallacious and perhaps outright dishonest.</p>
<p>It might be interesting to seek opinions of FDR's grand
vision from the people of Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia and
East Germany now emerging from the suffering imposed through
strategies developed by FDR during World War II and at Yalta.
They might get a little testy over Mr. Schlesinger's view
that statesmanship is tested by the long run, as they, unlike
Mr. Schlesinger, participated in the test.</p>
<p>I recently returned from a trip through western Siberia,
where I talked with a number of well-educated Soviet
citizens. In general, they see their political and economic
system as one large failure. Many of them referred to
communism as 70 years of failure. Without FDR's grand vision
and with a more well-reasoned strategy for achievement of
both our military and political objectives in World War II,
plus the recognition that we were clearly in a dominating
position at the close of the war through our industrial power
and military atomic capability, communism might have been
limited to perhaps as little as 30 years of failure.</p>

<p>I found Mr. Schlesinger's article about FDR especially
insightful. It is unfortunate there is such scant
appreciation of this great man today. Rarely in history has
there been an individual who has shaped so many lives.</p>
<p>Almost all of the things we take for granted today had
their genesis under FDR's tutelage. The Yalta agreements had
absolutely nothing to do with the actual fact of the Cold
War. Unable to directly challenge Social Security, the
minimum wage and so on, the right wing in this country has
sought consistently to discredit FDR -- and by implication
the New Deal -- by charging that he gave away Eastern Europe
to Stalin. This is ridiculous. The fact that Stalin had an
army of nearly 20 million occupying these East European
countries was not about to change, short of a full-scale war
between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Roosevelt was one of a kind. The world lost its brightest
light when he died.</p>

<p>Mr. Schlesinger's defense of FDR has a dreamlike quality
to it. Had we listened to Churchill, Stalin would have not
been in Eastern Europe in the first place.</p>
<p>As for Stalin's "short-run gain," fortunately for Mr.
Schlesinger and me, we did not have to survive in Eastern
Europe for some 45 years while waiting for the outcome of the
60/40 convergence to happen and for President Reagan to come
along to make the vision a reality.</p>

<p>What a marvelous tribute to the American political icon of
the 20th century. Mr. Schlesinger's astute commentary does
vindicate FDR at long last.</p>

<p>Mr. Schlesinger's fantasy is belied by Roosevelt's own
embittered realization, as the Iron Curtain quickly
descended, that "We can't do business with Stalin. He has
broken every one of the promises he made at Yalta."</p>
<p>Roosevelt, Churchill and the nations they led through
World War II made sacrifices and accomplished things for
which those of us born later must stand in gratitude and awe.
Still, we owe it to future generations to see the past
clearly. At Yalta, as at Munich, the Western democracies
permitted massive human misery by accepting promises (quickly
broken) from tyrants instead of mustering the will to force
the tyrants to back down.</p>
<p>Freedom is emerging in Eastern Europe today because the
people there have had the courage to seek it, and because the
West has had the political will to show the Soviets that
empire and tyranny have a price. To credit today's freedom to
the "accords" Roosevelt got from Stalin at Yalta is as wrong
as to credit such peace as Europe has had to the accords
Chamberlain got from Hitler at Munich.</p>

<p>Mr. Schlesinger's thoughtful assessment contains one
revisionist clinker: "FDR hoped, but failed, to prevent the
French from returning to Indochina. Had he succeeded, America
would have been spared much agony, and many brave Americans
who died in Vietnam would be alive today."</p>
<p>To ascribe the deaths of more than 50,000 Americans in
Vietnam to the pigheadedness of French colonialists is a bit
much. Let's place credit -- or lack thereof -- for the Second
Indochina War (1964-73) where it belongs. The French didn't
dispatch 500,000 Americans to Vietnam -- American policy
makers, many of them Mr. Schlesinger's colleagues, made those
fateful decisions. The American experience in Vietnam was
brought to us by deep thinkers along the banks of the Charles
River (and the Pedernales), not the Seine.</p>

<p>One must admire Mr. Schlesinger's chutzpah. Roosevelt had
within his command the power to alter the course of history
had he chosen a course less daring. Whether his decision was
because of hubris, naivete or physical infirmity matters not.
I wonder how the millions who died at the hands of Stalin and
his minions would feel about Mr. Schlesinger's emendation of
history.</p>

<p>I agree with Mr. Schlesinger that FDR did not throw
Central Europe to Uncle Joe at Yalta through ignorance,
stupidity or foolish pride. He did it earlier (most clearly
at Tehran) for what many might view as good reasons. First,
FDR was sensibly desperate to keep Stalin's armies in the
field against the Axis powers. Second, he seems to have
recognized that neither of the democratic Allied victors
would have the stomach to reverse what started World War II
in 1939 -- the armed enslavement of Poland. If Poland, of all
places, was fair game for Stalin, what in Central Europe
wasn't?</p>
<p>Before the U.S. entry into the war, it can be argued, FDR
led public awareness of the threat of fascism. As Hitler's
and Tojo's prospects faded, he appears as a merely competent
politician. FDR's embrace of Stalin as an ally, rather than
as a self-interested co-belligerant, set in motion the
domestic propaganda machine that may have sealed the fate of
Central Europe for nearly a half-century. Whatever the
participants at Yalta signed, the people of Poland, East
Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria (not
to mention the Baltic States) will have endured at least 45
years of communist gangsterism.</p>
<p>The legal and technical niceties of the Yalta accords (Mr.
Schlesinger admits that they were inherently unenforceable)
provided a basis for denying responsibility for what happened
behind the Iron Curtain. Now they are being used to claim
credit for what the brave people of Central Europe are trying
do on their own.</p>
