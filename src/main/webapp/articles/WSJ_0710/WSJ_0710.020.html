	<p class="article-leader">DONETSK, U.S.S.R. -- Yefim Zvyagilsky stands sweating in a
sports stadium near the center of this Ukrainian coal-mining
town, trying to persuade a huge crowd of miners not to go
ahead with a planned strike this week.
   For a while, the crowd listens patiently, if skeptically,
to his arguments. Then Mr. Zvyagilsky, a portly mine director
and member of the Ukrainian parliament, pushes his luck.
"Your political slogans are an insult to the honor of the
Communist Party," he gripes. The assembled miners erupt in a
chorus of jeers, hoots and whistles that forces Mr.
Zvyagilsky off the rostrum and out of the stadium.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As he leaves, cursing under his breath, one miner runs up
to him waving his fist. "You are all terrible people," he
shouts.</p>
<p>At its Congress in Moscow, the Soviet Communist Party is
agonizing over how to regain the confidence of the working
class. Here in the Soviet industrial heartland, the workers
don't want to hear the answer. On Wednesday, the miners of
Donetsk are planning to join their colleagues around the
nation in a one-day strike. Unlike their work stoppage last
summer, they aren't calling for more soap and sausage. This
time, it's the Communist Party that they're after.</p>
<p>"This is a normal political strike," says Valery Chaly, a
miners' leader from the town of Stakhanov, which is named
after the legendary Soviet miner Alexei Stakhanov, who mined
more than 100 tons of coal in one shift in 1935, at the
height of Stalin's industrialization campaign. "We need to
destabilize the socialist model that is leading us to ruin."</p>
<p>Political strikes, of course, are anything but normal in
the Soviet Union. But miners, like many workers, have grown
increasingly bold and restive in the past year. Alarmed about
an apparent conservative backlash in the party against
Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms, they are joining hands with
radical democrats to demand the end of party power
altogether.</p>
<p>Their strike demands include the resignation of the
government and decisive moves to remove party influence from
factories, the army, the KGB, the courts and the national
education system. They also want all party property to be
handed over to local government.</p>
<p>"We can see at the Congress that reactionary forces have
consolidated themselves," says Viktor Makarenko, a miners'
union official. "The party says it's a party of the people,
but it's the party of apparatchiks. They defend their
interests, not ours."</p>
<p>Such widespread sentiments are a mixed blessing for Mr.
Gorbachev. On the one hand, the miners' demands for a
transfer of power from the party to elected government are in
line with the Soviet president's own political agenda.
Although Mr. Gorbachev has urged them not to strike, miners'
leaders believe he isn't completely averse to some protest
action. They say it will help him in his battle with the
military and other party conservatives who are trying to slow
the pace of reform, if not reverse it altogether.</p>
<p>But with the Soviet economy in a deep recession, strikes
are the last thing that Mr. Gorbachev needs. Although the
miners haven't won the support of others for their one-day
protest this week, they are lobbying hard to persuade railway
and steel workers to unite with them in future actions. With
the national mood already restless, the situation could
easily spiral out of control.</p>
<p>"What we need more than ever before is the highest
possible degree of harmony in society," Mr. Gorbachev told
the Congress last week. "This is no time for ultimatums and
conflicts, or for ill-considered actions that divide people
and aggravate the situation."</p>
<p>Some miners agree. "It's no good going on strike," says
Ilya Matvienko, who has been in a wheelchair since his back
was injured in an accident at the coal face in 1978. "They
complain that there is little in the shops. But if people
don't work, there will be nothing at all in the shops."</p>
<p>Such moderation is getting harder to find these days in
Donetsk, where miners are cooler headed than their
counterparts in other mining communities, such as Vorkuta in
Northern Russia or the Kuznetsk region of Siberia, where
living conditions are worse. While a few work collectives
here have decided against joining the strike, and others say
they may not take the whole day off, but just join a protest
rally in town for a few hours, public indignation is growing
louder here.</p>
<p>Most miners in the region, which has some of the oldest
and deepest coal pits in the nation, are angry that the
government has failed to fulfill the pledges it made to end
last year's national strike. They included giving miners a
greater say in running their affairs, as well as promising to
ship in more consumer goods. One year later, people here
fume, little has really changed.</p>
<p>"It was a mistake to sign that document; perhaps it was
just political inexperience," says Sergei Formanyuk, a member
of the Donetsk town council. He contends that Soviet Prime
Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov agreed to go along with the
settlement, "not because he believed in fulfilling {the
conditions}, but because he wanted to end the strike."</p>
<p>Such feelings of betrayal are widespread, and have already
led to big upheavals in Donetsk politics. The town's
Communist Party leader resigned earlier this year after
miners and others staged mass demonstrations to press for his
removal. In local elections soon afterwards, radicals won a
two-thirds majority of seats on the town council, making
Donetsk one of only a handful of places in the Ukraine where
conservative party officials lost control. The town council
is actively supporting this week's planned strike.</p>
<p>Moreover, workers at the Kalinin mine in Donetsk moved to
fulfil one of their key political demands by voting to close
the offices of the Communist Party committee on the mine's
premises.</p>
<p>Despite these successes, the miners' leaders are unclear
about what to do next. Although they express disdain for the
party Congress now taking place in Moscow, 600 miles away,
they admit that its outcome could play an important role in
their future tactics. Many would like to channel the
anti-party radicalism of the miners into more constructive
efforts to strengthen the emerging system of elected local
government.</p>
<p>Their hope is that radicals will walk out of the Congress
and formally set up an alternative party headed by a
nationwide figure such as Kremlin maverick Boris Yeltsin or
Alexander Yakovlev, a liberal Gorbachev confidant currently
on the Politburo. Such a split would deal a severe blow to
party authority, they say.</p>
<p>But a schism along these lines seems increasingly
unlikely. Messrs. Yeltsin and Yakovlev are both cool about
leading a split, and Mr. Gorbachev has been doing his best at
the Congress to hold the middle ground. As a result, most
predict the party will be weakened by an exodus of members
after the Congress, but not challenged head-on by a breakaway
alternative.</p>
<p>"The reality is that, so far, there are no other viable
political parties, and there won't be for a long time," says
Yuri Boldyrev, a 39-year-old engineer who is one of the
Donetsk strike leaders. "There are only small organizations
formed by intellectuals without a broad base." He recounts
how one radical who has formed his own party, Nikolai
Travkin, met with miners last month. His fierce criticism of
the Communist Party was warmly applauded. But when he started
talking about his own new group, the Russian Democrats,
"people just lost interest," Mr. Boldyrev says.</p>
<p>Thus for the moment, the passion and political energy of
miners such as Yuri Dubinsky is aimed against the Communists.
Mr. Dubinsky sits in the Donetsk stadium surrounded by
colleagues wearing hats made out of newspaper to ward off the
stinging midday sun. Roaring his approval as representatives
from one group after another promise to join this week's
strike, he holds up a satirical placard.</p>
<p>"We have nothing to lose but our chains," it declares,
quoting Karl Marx, and depicting a worker with a ball and
chain wrapped around his neck and arms. But the ball has the
initials KPSS written on it -- Russian for the Communist
Party of the Soviet Union.</p>
