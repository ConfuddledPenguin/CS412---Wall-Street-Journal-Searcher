	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The number of corporate name changes dropped
14% in 1989 from 1988, to 1,600 from a record 1,864, with
half the latest total reflecting mergers and acquisitions,
said Anspach Grossman Portugal Inc., a consulting firm.
   For example, a pair of combinations -- Time Inc. with
Warner Communications Inc., and Bristol-Myers Co. with Squibb
Corp. -- produced Time Warner Inc. and Bristol-Myers Squibb
Co.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Elective name changes -- those made for reasons other than
merger, downsizing or reorganization -- represented 16% of
the total, the consultants said. Among them in 1989 were Gulf
& Western Inc. becoming Paramount Communications Inc. and
Home Group Inc. taking on the name AmBase Corp., the firm
said.</p>
<p>Companies also change their names to reflect their entry
into or withdrawal from markets and to take advantage of a
particularly prominent product. One-quarter of the changes in
1989 were spurred by divestitures, asset sales, spinoffs and
leveraged buy-outs, the firm said. F.W. Woolworth Co.
switched to Woolworth Corp. when it became a holding company.</p>
<p>Acquisitions of U.S. firms by foreign firms led to
Stauffer Chemical Corp. becoming Rhone-Poulenc Basic
Chemicals Inc. and Pennwalt Corp. becoming Atochem.</p>
