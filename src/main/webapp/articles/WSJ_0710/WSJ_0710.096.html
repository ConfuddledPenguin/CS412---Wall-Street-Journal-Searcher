	<p class="article-leader">Let's see if we understand the dynamics of a
stock-transfer tax, which it's rumored President Bush might
support. On the one hand, he says he's still pushing for a
cut in the capital-gains rate. On the other hand, there's now
talk of up to a 0.5% tax on transfers of stocks, bonds and
futures. This would obviously burden the growth effects of a
cut in the gains rate. We are tempted to dismiss this
proposal as patently absurd, except that with lip reading out
of style we can take nothing for granted.
   Loose lips sink shares. For starters, how about a fall in
share prices of between 9.3% and 14.6% and a drop in volume
of 12.7%? These are some of the unhappy estimates of the
impact of a 0.5% transfer tax made by the Congressional
Research Service. The group studied the issue in March 1987,
the last time anyone -- then-Speaker Jim Wright -- floated
this possible tax.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A transfer tax would be the worst kind of betrayal of tax
reform. By its very nature, this tax would discourage
economically sensible deals. Every possible trade would be
affected by the tax, which would raise the cost of capital by
making it more expensive to move capital from one investment
to another.</p>
<p>"The higher transaction costs and lower trading volume
would reduce the efficiency of the stock market in the sense
that some transactions which are justified on the basis of
the underlying economics would no longer occur," the
congressional report said. "The tax would make the cost of
some investments prohibitive. For other investments it would
create a `lock-in' effect; selling an existing investment and
buying another might increase the expected return, but the
transaction costs associated with the trade would exceed the
potential gain."</p>
<p>It is passing strange that the proposal should waft out of
the Treasury, where Secretary Nicholas Brady has complained
about volatility in the markets. The congressional report,
which came before the 1987 crash, noted that "reduced trading
volume would also decrease the liquidity of the stock market
somewhat and could possibly increase volatility, since larger
price changes may be required to match demand and supply in a
market with less volume."</p>
<p>The effects could be even more dramatic in the futures
markets. The Chicago Board of Trade estimates a soybean
futures contract for $65,000 worth of soybeans that now costs
about $75 to transact would cost about $400. A 0.5% tax on
this contract explains the $325 difference. Farmers should
ask why the federal government would want them to choose
between paying extortionate amounts in transaction taxes or
forgetting about hedging their risks.</p>
<p>Even the estimated revenues of between $8 billion and $10
billion a year are highly suspect products of 1970s-style
static analysis. If fewer trades are done, less revenue will
come in.</p>
<p>International competition would guarantee fewer
U.S.-taxable trades. Any effort to tax Americans on foreign
exchanges is doomed to fail. Modems, faxes and satellites
make markets highly portable. Many trades will migrate to
lowest-cost markets. Several countries have no taxes on
securities transactions. Indeed, the major countries that do
have transfer taxes, including Japan, Britain and Canada, are
moving to abolish or lower them. Even the socialist mayor of
Frankfurt, accompanied by a representative of his Green Party
government coalition, not long ago told a group of Journal
editors that they hoped Bonn would abolish the German
stock-transfer tax so that Frankfurt could compete with the
City of London.</p>
<p>Since there is no economic justification for this tax, and
with the administration seemingly content to let these
proposals wander around in public, we're left to speculate
that they must lie in someone's political constellation. Dick
Darman may figure this would be good soak-the-rich politics,
perhaps to ease a capital-gains cut. Or maybe Secretary Brady
figures he can punish his pet peeve of short-term investing
by making it more expensive to trade as often as the market
demands. The weak distinction between long- and short-term
investing aside, someone should remind the White House that
pension plans and mutual funds do much of the risk-hedging
and other high-volume trading. Union officials worried about
returns on pensions are already lobbying against this tax.</p>
<p>As we say, it's hard to treat this as a serious proposal.
Maybe the White House is tossing up trial tax balloons to see
them shot down. This kind of political game, though, works
best only when there is clear, reliable leadership that will
just say no to bad ideas.</p>
<p>It is now clear that the price President Bush's opponents,
and perhaps even some friends, will make him pay for dropping
his no-tax pledge will come in the dear coin of credibility.
No one can know which of today's wacko tax proposals will
become tomorrow's tax policies. There is a caldron brewing of
great uncertainty and risk. The last time a national leader
lost control of economic policy we suffered a malaise not
suffered in this country for more than a decade.</p>
