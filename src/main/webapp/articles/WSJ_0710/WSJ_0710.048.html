	<p class="article-leader">Tons of french fries and breakfast potato patties destined
for McDonald's and other fast-food chains have been impounded
by a food processor after pieces of rusted wire, some more
than an inch long, were detected in the food at the
production plant.
   Several million pounds of potentially contaminated potato
items left a Lamb-Weston Inc. plant in Oregon, but company
officials told government health authorities that they
believe the items were recovered before reaching the public.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The products, now stored in warehouses on the West Coast,
will be scanned by metal detectors. If found to be safe, the
food may be repackaged for eventual sale, although apparently
not to the company's fast-food restaurant customers,
including McDonald's Corp., Wendy's International Inc. and
Kentucky Fried Chicken, a unit of PepsiCo Inc. The products
could be sold under the company's house labels, state health
officials said.</p>
<p>The contamination hasn't been announced publicly by the
company. It apparently began in early June, and went
unreported to plant management for nearly two weeks, although
machines were rejecting packages with wire fragments and
assembly-line employees were dutifully noting the rejections
in logs.</p>
<p>When management did learn of the problem, the plant was
shut down for cleaning -- but more pieces of wire appeared
after production resumed, former employees say. The plant,
which employs about 500, started up again yesterday after a
lengthy shutdown and decontamination.</p>
<p>Former employees, seven of whom were fired over the
incident, say the source of the wire fragments remains a
mystery despite repeated intensive searches, including
crawling through chutes with magnets. "We never could
pinpoint a source," says Steven Johnson, who was fired from
his job as quality assurance manager at the Hermiston, Ore.,
plant. Lamb-Weston is a joint venture of ConAgra Inc. and
Golden Valley Microwave Foods Inc.</p>
<p>The plant can produce up to one million pounds a day of
fries, hash brown patties, puffed potato balls and other
potato products. Most of the production during the time of
the contamination was for McDonald's restaurants, according
to the former employees. Some of the fries were being
produced for shipment to McDonald's in Japan, the first time
Japanese franchises would get fries from that plant.</p>
<p>Officials of Lamb-Weston didn't return phone calls.</p>
<p>Wire fragments first began appearing in batches early in
June, dismissed employees said yesterday. Mr. Johnson said he
first learned of the problem June 15. "I went into the lab,
just routine, and one of the technicians had gone through a
bag of french fries that had been kicked off by the metal
detector and she showed me this piece of wire sticking
through this fry."</p>
<p>He said he asked where it had come from. "She showed me.
Then she showed me the log. It was full of all these
incidents of detected metal." Mr. Johnson said he immediately
went to the plant manager's office to report his discovery.</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson and others described the wire bits as being
similar to bristles on a wire brush. The fragments, found
when employees broke open rejected bags of product, were
between one-fourth of an inch and two inches long, they said.
Mr. Johnson said some were rusted.</p>
<p>According to a former employee, the plant logbook showed
increasing frequencies of metal-detector rejections. Three
occurred on June 4. There were no incidents the next day, but
gradually the frequency increased, until on June 13 seven
cases were recorded, the former employee said. A company
letter to Oregon state officials calls the period of June
4-15 as the "core dates" for the problem.</p>
<p>Although four of the plant's five lines recorded metal
fragments, one former employee said most of the incidents
seemed to occur on the french-fry line.</p>
<p>There was no immediate explanation as to why the incidents
went unreported to plant managers. James Black, administrator
of Oregon's Agriculture department's food and dairy division,
said the department dispatched an inspector to the plant
after his department received an anonymous tip.</p>
