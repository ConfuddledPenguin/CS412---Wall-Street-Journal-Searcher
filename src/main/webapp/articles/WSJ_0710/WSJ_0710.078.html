	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Saul S. Cohen, Drexel Burnham Lambert Group
Inc.'s former top internal cop and one of Wall Street's
best-paid lawyers, bolted the securities business to rejoin
his former law firm.
   But don't expect Mr. Cohen to apologize for the $2
million-a-year salary package he worked out at Drexel in
April 1989 -- a deal that spun heads even on Wall Street. He
now bills clients a fat $450 an hour at Rosenman & Colin, a
New York law firm he rejoined after a one-year hiatus.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"You're not taken seriously {among investment bankers}
unless you make lots of money," says Mr. Cohen. "I was the
most expensive . . . general counsel in the universe, and
they knew it," he adds. "It conveyed authority."</p>
<p>Mr. Cohen was brought in as Drexel's general counsel last
year to help the firm comply with its settlement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Drexel pleaded guilty to
six felonies and agreed last year to pay $650 million in
fines and penalties.</p>
<p>Much of Mr. Cohen's Drexel stash, however, is tied up in
court: Drexel, which filed for bankruptcy-law protection in
February, still owes him $5.25 million of a four-year, $8
million package, Mr. Cohen says.</p>
<p>At Drexel, the brash Mr. Cohen was known as a hard
bargainer in Drexel's settlements with state regulators to
keep the firm open for business. Before Drexel's collapse,
Mr. Cohen negotiated settlements with 43 states totaling
about $8 million. His duties at Drexel included compliance
control and reorganizing the firm's legal department.</p>
<p>His biggest challenge: Addressing the lax compliance tone
at Drexel. "If there's one place where they failed, that's
it," he says.</p>
<p>Drexel wasn't his first big challenge. For several years,
Mr. Cohen has been the court-appointed trustee for Bevill,
Bresler & Schulman Inc., a broker-dealer that filed for
bankruptcy-law proceedings.</p>
<p>The 53-year-old Mr. Cohen originally joined Rosenman &
Colin from Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb Inc., where he had been
general counsel. He also had been general counsel at A.G.
Edwards & Sons and is former president of the Securities
Industry Association's legal and compliance division.</p>
<p>Back at Rosenman & Colin, Mr. Cohen will focus on
securities litigation and compliance. The firm's brokerage
clients include, among others, Bear Stearns Cos., Donaldson
Lufkin & Jenrette Inc., Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.,
First Boston Corp. and Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.</p>
