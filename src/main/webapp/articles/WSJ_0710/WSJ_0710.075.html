	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The National Association of Securities Dealers
fined J.W. Gant & Associates Inc., an Englewood, Colo.,
brokerage firm, $30,000 and ordered it and two employees to
return nearly $196,000 to customers because of alleged
overcharges for securities.
   Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, the firm;
Salvatore A. Venezia, a principal and vice president at Gant;
and James S. Gad, a representative and trader at the firm,
consented to the sanctions.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The NASD, the self-regulatory agency for the
over-the-counter market, charged that Gant charged excessive
markups for the initial public penny-stock offering of what
the agency identified only as a Colorado producer of a
soy-based, non-dairy, frozen dessert.</p>
<p>The initial offering consisted of units priced at 10 cents
a piece; each unit included a common share plus a warrant.</p>
<p>The firm "dominated and controlled the market" for the
securities and used that position to sell the securities "at
markups ranging from 11% to 184% over the prevailing market
price," the NASD said.</p>
<p>Mr. Gad declined to comment; Mr. Venezia couldn't be
reached. The NASD also suspended both Messrs. Gad and Venezia
for 15 days.</p>
<p>The firm was suspended for six months from making markets
in and executing transactions as a principal in securities
that aren't traded on the NASD's Automated Quotation System,
unless some part of the securities is traded on Nasdaq.</p>
<p>Gant previously was the subject of a disciplinary
proceeding; the NASD fined the firm $2,500 for failing to
maintain minimum net capital.</p>
