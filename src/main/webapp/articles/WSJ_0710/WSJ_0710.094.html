	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON (AP) -- The timber industry urged the
government yesterday to reject a spotted-owl protection
strategy proposed by government scientists, saying it would
cost 102,000 jobs and turn some towns into rural ghettos.
   Researchers commissioned by the American Forest Resource
Alliance said logging communities in Washington, Oregon and
Northern California accept the need to reduce timber harvests
to protect the environment. But they said the government
should consider human as well as environmental needs in
developing a plan for the endangered owl.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Yeah, we're going to lose jobs," said John Beuter, a
forest economics consultant from Portland, Ore. He said the
question is, "How much of this is really necessary and how
will it be implemented over time?"</p>
<p>The Forest Service has estimated that 8,000 timber jobs
would be lost by the end of the decade under owl-protection
policies recommended in an April report by government
scientists.</p>
<p>Mr. Beuter said his research shows the figure would be
twice that, plus thousands more jobs lost outside the timber
industry. The direct and indirect job loss would come to
102,000 by the end of the decade if the report's strategy is
applied to public and private lands, he said.</p>
<p>A federal timber task force is scheduled to come up with
an extensive owl-protection plan by Sept. 1.</p>
<p>Estimates of the remaining spotted owl population range
from 3,000 to 5,000 pairs. Each nesting pair needs a large
tract of undisturbed old-growth forest, biologists say.</p>
