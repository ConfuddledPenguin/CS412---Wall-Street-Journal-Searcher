	<p class="article-leader">In an effort to stem erosion of its market share in laser
printers, Apple Computer Inc., Cupertino, Calif., unveiled a
new low-priced line of printers for its Macintosh computer.
   Apple's new low-end machine, the Personal LaserWriter SC,
is slower than older models but is priced at $1,999, 29% less
than Apple's previous lowest-priced model. Apple's new line
also includes the full-featured NT model, which lists for
$3,299, compared with $4,599 for Apple's previous
full-featured model.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The SC machine is designed to plug into a single
Macintosh, while the NT model can be connected to several
machines, including non-Apple computers, at once. Both
machines print about four pages a minute, compared with eight
pages per minute on the older machines.</p>
<p>Apple has been losing market share in the laser-printer
business to Hewlett-Packard Co., which has targeted Apple's
customers by undercutting Apple's printer prices. Apple
figures that its lower prices will attract new users who
don't need to print in high volumes.</p>
