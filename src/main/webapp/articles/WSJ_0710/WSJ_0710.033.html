	<p class="article-leader">The Price of Freedom
   For East Bloc Travelers</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>IT'S EASIER to fly to Eastern Europe these days, but it
also may be less safe.</p>
<p>Before the political upheaval, most Eastern European and
Soviet Union airports were considered almost terrorist-proof,
because the police there had such tight control over
citizens. But U.S. safety specialists say that with people in
the East bloc having new freedoms and traveling more, it may
be easier for hijackers and terrorists to target flights from
such cities as Moscow, Prague and Warsaw.</p>
<p>In fact, five hijackings have been reported on Soviet
airliners in the past year, according to the Federal Aviation
Administration. Because the Soviets didn't previously report
hijackings, FAA officials say they don't know if such
incidents are on the rise. "But it's definitely a significant
number," says Quinten T. Johnson, the FAA's manager of civil
aviation security division.</p>
<p>The FAA is reviewing its requirements for U.S. carriers
flying to and from Eastern Europe. U.S. airlines currently
don't have to check baggage as carefully in Eastern Europe as
in Western Europe and the Middle East. "There's no question
that as society controls decrease, opportunity increases,"
says Mr. Johnson. "I guess it's the price of freedom."</p>
<p>Safety specialists maintain, however, that Eastern Europe
still has a big safety advantage: Gun controls are tight,
limiting hijackers' ability to arm themselves.</p>
<p>Airlines Take Closer Look</p>
<p>To Stop Bogus Refunds</p>
<p>FOR TRAVELERS trying to sneak out of nonrefundable airline
tickets, the jig may be up.</p>
<p>Airlines normally refund nonrefundable tickets only to
travelers who are too sick to fly or who have a sudden
illness or death in the family. So, some people unable to use
their nonrefundable tickets have been feigning illness to get
a doctor's note or persuading doctors to give them phony
notes.</p>
<p>Now, some airline officials say they're checking these
excuses more carefully, by calling up doctors or
investigating the notes other ways. One New York travel agent
was found with a doctor's note pad, forging the physician's
name, according to industry officials. Some carriers that
aren't entirely satisfied with someone's excuse ask or force
the traveler to take a voucher for future travel, instead of
a refund.</p>
<p>"There have just been too many abuses," says a spokeswoman
for America West. "It's a shame, because we still want to
help people who really have a legitimate excuse."</p>
<p>Airlines have also gotten wise to another ploy: Many
travelers go to airports and tell sob stories to different
counter agents until they find one willing to give a refund.
Now, some airlines require counter agents to make notes on
their computer system when travelers begin "shopping around"
so that other agents won't be fooled.</p>
<p>But even airlines concede they can't catch everybody, and
a few say they're not cracking down at all. Midway Airlines,
for example, says it doesn't always require a doctor's note,
although each case is handled individually. "We have a
philosophy of being pretty lenient," concedes David Henry,
customer-service director for the Chicago-based carrier.</p>
<p>Vacation of Vexation:</p>
<p>A Rental-Car Odyssey</p>
<p>HERE'S a car-rental horror story that's pretty hard to
beat.</p>
<p>Gabriel Crognale, a civil engineer from Newton, Mass.,
wanted to spend seven days driving leisurely through
Venezuela last April. But when he arrived in Caracas, Dollar
Rent a Car gave him a "beaten up" Chevette that was dented,
had no radio and wouldn't go faster than 30 miles per hour.
"I had my foot on the floor," he recalls. "People were
laughing."</p>
<p>Miffed, he returned the Dollar car the next day and
decided to rent from Hertz. But the first Hertz car he got,
he says, "died" at a downtown garage, and he had to wait two
hours for a replacement. Then he lost the keys on the
replacement and spent six hours in a parking garage, waiting
for Hertz to bring another car. "They kept saying they'd be
there in a few minutes," he says.</p>
<p>Car No. 3 from Hertz wouldn't go faster than 40 mph
without shaking madly, so Mr. Crognale returned it for
another one. By now, five days into his trip, his vacation
was pretty much ruined, he says.</p>
<p>But the worst was yet to come. On his way to the airport
on the last day of his vacation, he stopped at a gas station,
and the car wouldn't start again. Frantically, he grabbed a
taxi -- but missed his flight and had to stay another day.
For his troubles, Hertz gave him a free car for the night (it
ran the best of all five vehicles, he says). But the company
still charged him $110 for the week's rental.</p>
<p>Mr. Crognale has since fired off letters to Dollar and
Hertz. Dollar says it hasn't received it yet, but a Hertz
spokeswoman says the company will withdraw the $110 charge
and give him a $200 gift certificate toward a future Hertz
rental. "He obviously had a very unfortunate experience, and
it was our fault," the Hertz spokeswoman says.</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>MEN ON A long trip are more likely than women to miss home
(33% vs. 22%) and friends and family (24% vs. 10%), according
to survey by Marriott Corp.'s Residence Inn. . . . A new name
seems to make a difference to hotel guests. Occupancy rates
jumped 5% to 7% at hotels that the previous year had left one
chain for another, gone independent or joined a chain for the
first time, a Laventhol & Horwath study shows.</p>
