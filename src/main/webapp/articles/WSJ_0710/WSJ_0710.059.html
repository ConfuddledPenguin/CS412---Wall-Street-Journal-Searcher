	<p class="article-leader">Legal & General Group PLC of Britain, an insurer, said it
agreed to sell its Victory Reinsurance Ltd. unit to
Netherlands Reinsurance Group, 51%-owned by Nationale
Nederlanden N.V., one of the world's largest insurance
companies, in a deal valued at #140 million ($249.9 million).
   Legal & General will receive #122 million on completion of
the sale and will keep an additional #18 million related to
four Victory subsidiaries that it will retain, the company
said. It said the sale is part of its strategy to concentrate
on its core businesses of life insurance and pensions,
British general insurance and investments.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Victory businesses, excluding the ones being retained by
Legal & General, accounted for #15.9 million of Legal &
General's #142.3 million in pretax profit last year.
Victory's principal operations are in Britain, Australia and
Canada.</p>
<p>Legal & General concluded that Victory needed to be
"considerably larger if it were to compete effectively over
the longer term with the major international reinsurers," the
official said, noting that reinsurance is capital-intensive.</p>
