	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- The Tokyo office of CS First Boston Inc. was hit
by its second high-level resignation in a month, as the
brokerage firm's top Japanese executive resigned to join a
rival Swiss firm.
   Allen D. Wheat, the new head of CS First Boston in Asia,
said in a statement to employees that Keisuke Inaba,
president and branch manager of CS First Boston (Japan) Ltd.,
resigned because he said he wanted to work in a smaller
office and had "a belief that he's contributed all he can
toward expanding our effort in Japan."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>He said Mr. Inaba will join UBS Phillips & Drew
International Ltd., the securities subsidiary of Union Bank
of Switzerland. The controlling shareholder of CS First
Boston is Credit Suisse, another major Swiss bank.</p>
<p>Mr. Inaba, a former executive at Merrill Lynch & Co. and
Kidder Peabody International Corp., was out of the country
and couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>His resignation came just three weeks after James M.
Walsh, chairman of CS First Boston in Japan, quit. Mr. Walsh
said he resigned after the firm asked him to move to London.</p>
<p>But employees at CS First Boston have speculated that the
arrival in February of Mr. Wheat, former chairman of Bankers
Trust Co.'s international arm, created friction at the firm
that prompted Messrs. Walsh and Inaba to leave.</p>
<p>Mr. Wheat said CS First Boston will continue its expansion
in Asia, despite the departures. "Moving forward in a
changing environment is never easy," he said in the
annoucement to employees.</p>
<p>With a staff of more than 400, memberships on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange and the Tokyo International Financial Futures
Exchange, and a representative office in Osaka, CS First
Boston is among the largest foreign brokerage houses in
Japan.</p>
