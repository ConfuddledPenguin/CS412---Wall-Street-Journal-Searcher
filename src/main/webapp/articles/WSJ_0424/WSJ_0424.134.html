	<p class="article-leader">BONN PROPOSED a generous plan for monetary union with East
Germany.
   In a bid to calm East German fears, the West German
government unveiled the outlines of a plan for merging the
two nations' currencies. Under the proposal, individual East
German wages and savings of as much as $2,373 would be
changed into West German marks at a favorable one-to-one
rate. The offer is considered a major concession to East
Berlin, which argued that workers need to be cushioned during
a transition to a market economy.</p>

aid survivors of the World War II Holocaust, in which the
Nazis killed six million Jews.</p>

<p>THE U.S. IS PRESSING its efforts to win freedom for all
hostages in the Mideast.</p>
<p>While reiterating its refusal to make any deals, the White
House said it was continuing "to probe all sources of
information" about seven missing Americans, and Bush renewed
his call for their "unconditional" release. In West Germany,
Polhill, who was freed Sunday by pro-Iranian extremists,
underwent a physical examinaton and doctors said he was
malnourished and mildly dehydrated. The 55-year-old New
Yorker had been held for more than three years.</p>
<p>The foreign minister of Iran, which joined Syria in
helping arrange Polhill's release, reportedly called for
Israel to free a Shiite cleric abducted in July.</p>

<p>NEPAL'S POLICE BATTLED mobs, threatening a transition to
democracy.</p>
<p>In the first major violence since the Himalayan kingdom
lifted a ban on political parties two weeks ago, police
opened fire on demonstrators after crowds rampaged in
Katmandu. At least 11 people were reported killed, including
six police officers beaten to death by protesters. The mobs
accused security forces of condoning a monarchist group
blamed for a wave of crime aimed at undermining Nepal's
four-day-old government. A curfew was imposed on the capital.</p>
<p>Prime Minister K.P. Bhattarai, who has said Nepal may be
headed for a constitutional monarchy, met with King Birendra
to review the situation.</p>

<p>Lithuania closed the Baltic republic's only oil refinery
because of the Kremlin's cutoff of energy supplies. The prime
minister said the republic, which last month declared its
independence from Moscow, may try to sell gold to import
fuel, and the president said Gorbachev should renounce the
use of Soviet troops in Lithuania.</p>
<p>Bush plans to meet today with congressional leaders to
discuss a U.S. response to the Soviet Union's standoff with
Lithuania. The White House also welcomed what it called signs
of flexibility from Moscow, which said Soviet leaders were
willing to open talks with the republic if it froze for two
years its move toward secession.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court rejected an appeal by an Oregon woman
who doesn't want to share parental rights with a California
man who donated his sperm for artificial insemination. The

to prove he acted only after the woman said she would let him
help raise the child, a girl born in 1986.</p>

<p>NASA prepared for today's scheduled liftoff of the space

forecasters predicted favorable weather.</p>

<p>China's Premier Li arrived in the Soviet Union and met

tensions.</p>
