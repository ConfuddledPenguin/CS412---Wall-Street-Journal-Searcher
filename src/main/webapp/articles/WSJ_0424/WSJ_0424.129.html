	<p class="article-leader">JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- In a move toward further
consolidation in the trucking industry, P-I-E Nationwide Inc.
said it was authorized by federal regulators to take control
of Transcon Lines Inc.
   Both trucking companies are part of the $14 billion
"less-than-truckload" industry. Such companies carry several
small shipments in a single trailer. The industry has been
battered of late by pricing wars that have cut into profits.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Transcon, formerly a unit of Transcon Inc. in Beverly
Hills, Calif, was sold earlier this month to closely held
Growth Finance Corp. in Miami. The price wasn't disclosed. In
1989, Transcon Lines had revenue of $226.5 million and
operating losses of $31.6 million.</p>
<p>P-I-E said Transcon had requested that P-I-E take control
of all freight in its system and deliver it to customers.
Last Friday, the Interstate Commerce Commission in Washington
cleared the transaction.</p>
<p>Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.</p>
<p>P-I-E said the move wasn't a merger but rather an
"absorption" of one company's business into another. P-I-E
said that the transition has gone smoothly and that all
Transcon freight will be delivered this week.</p>
<p>P-I-E is also closely held. Olympia Holding Corp., based
in Miami, acquired a majority interest in P-I-E earlier this
month. Terms weren't disclosed. In 1989, P-I-E had revenue of
about $500 million.</p>
<p>Officials at Transcon couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
