	<p class="article-leader">LISLE, Ill. -- Pansophic Systems Inc. disclosed it plans
special charges that it expects will effectively erase its
earnings for the year ending Monday. The news sent the
software concern's stock price plunging 33%.
   While Pansophic didn't break out the size of the charges,
its statement that it now expects break-even results for the
full year indicates the charges will about wipe out the $15.7
million, or 84 cents a share, in earnings in the first nine
months.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Pansophic said it will write down certain assets of its
graphics operation and incur other one-time costs as part of
a plan to "refocus" the operation on its core
presentation-graphics business.</p>
<p>In addition, the company said it is closing its Brazilian
subsidiary, because recent economic austerity measures
announced by that nation have created an "untenable
environment" for direct sales there. Pansophic will continue
to sell in Brazil through a distributor.</p>
<p>In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Pansophic shares plunged $5.125, closing at $10.50.</p>
<p>A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. analyst David Soetebier said he
thinks the "sell-off was overdone," adding that the "core of
the company is still quite strong." The disclosure of the
Brazilian unit's shutdown came as a surprise, he noted. "Part
of the problem with Pansophic in the last couple of years,"
he said, is that management hasn't moved to resolve problems
"as quickly as they should have."</p>
<p>Pansophic also announced that its chairman and chief
executive officer, David J. Eskra, had assumed the additional
title of president, succeeding in that role William G.
Nelson, who resigned in January.</p>
