	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- Bank of New England Corp. named R.T. McNamar, a
former U.S. deputy Treasury secretary, as vice chairman.
   Mr. McNamar, 51 years old, will be responsible for
regulatory compliance, investor relations and corporate
communications at the financially troubled bank holding
company. The vice chairman's post had been vacant since the
end of January, when Richard Driscoll was forced to retire.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. McNamar will play a sensitive role. Bank of New
England is under strict orders from federal regulators to
improve its financial condition and its operations. And the
company's securities holders are watching anxiously to see
whether it can work its way out from under its massive loan
problems without government assistance. Any financial aid
from the government would probably wipe out any remaining
value in the company's shares and could mean big losses for
debt holders, as well.</p>
<p>Mr. McNamar said in an interview that he sees "a
reasonable possibility that we can avoid" government
assistance. But he said it "will take another quarter or two"
of monitoring the Bank of New England loan portfolio before
the question of the company's viability can be answered with
greater assurance. Mr. McNamar said that he is "very
impressed" with the new loan-review process at Bank of New
England, but that the system will have to be checked against
factors such as rates of recovery on foreclosed real estate.</p>
<p>First-quarter results are to be posted in the next couple
of weeks, and Lawrence Fish, the company's new chairman, has
warned that nonperforming assets will rise from the $2.3
billion reported as of Dec. 31, partly resulting from
deterioration in the New England real estate market and
partly reflecting the revised loan-review process.
Nonperforming assets include foreclosed loans and loans for
which payments are past due or considered to become
delinquent. Mr. Fish last week outlined a strategy to return
the company to profitability, and said the bank will seek to
place some of its problem assets in a separate entity --
often known as a "bad bank."</p>
<p>Mr. McNamar and Mr. Fish became acquainted after Mr. Fish
left Bank of Boston Corp. in 1988 to become president and
chief operating officer of Columbia Savings & Loan
Association in Beverly Hills, Calif. The two men met at the
suggestion of an executive recruiter they both knew in San
Francisco, and have kept in touch since, Mr. McNamar said.</p>
<p>Mr. McNamar held the No. 2 job at the Treasury Department
from 1981 to 1985, and was responsible for domestic and
international capital markets, banking and tax policy. He was
in charge of the department's handling of the Third World
debt problem and served as principal negotiator for some
assistance packages from 1982 to 1984.</p>
<p>Since leaving the government, he has run Conover &
McNamar, a Los Angeles-based consulting and merchant banking
firm that did work for the World Bank and several private
banking companies. Co-founder C. Todd Conover, formerly U.S.
comptroller of the currency, has since left the firm. Mr.
McNamar, who started work at Bank of New England yesterday,
said Conover & McNamar will be closed.</p>
<p>Mr. McNamar, who joins the boards of Bank of New England
Corp. and its main banking affiliates in Massachusetts and
Connecticut, will have a personal financial stake in the
company's efforts to turn itself around: His compensation
package at Bank of New England, like Mr. Fish's, includes a
heavy weighting of stock options.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Bank of New England shares closed at $3.625, unchanged.</p>
