	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Lomas & Nettleton Mortgage Investors, citing a
rocky real estate climate, said it nearly tripled its
loan-loss reserves to $50.6 million, leading to a net loss of
$35 million, or $2.99 a share, in the fiscal third quarter.
   The real estate investment trust also said that while it
plans to make a third-quarter dividend payment of 21 cents a
share, it will forgo a payment in August and "defer
consideration of further dividend payments until October
1990."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The deterioration of the country's real estate markets
has accelerated in recent months, and liquidity available to
the real estate industry appears to be at its lowest point
since the end of World War II," said Jess Hay, Lomas &
Nettleton's chairman and chief executive.</p>
<p>The third-quarter loss provisions included a special $37.5
million addition to aggregate reserves and a regular $500,000
quarterly provision for possible losses, the trust said.
Reserves currently stand at 6.5% of total investments, the
highest level in the trust's 20-year history.</p>
<p>Revenue for the third quarter ended March 31 fell to $21.9
million from $34.1 million in the year-earlier quarter, when
Lomas & Nettleton reported net income of $6.3 million, or 54
cents a share.</p>
<p>For the first nine months of fiscal 1990, the company
reported a net loss of $26.8 million, or $2.29 a share, on
revenue of $76.8 million. In the comparable period a year
ago, the company reported net income of $20.5 million, or
$1.76 a share, on revenue of $97.1 million.</p>
<p>Separately, the trust said it has reduced the aggregate
principal amount of its notes due April 30, 1990 to $177.3
million from $246 million at Sept. 30, 1989. It said it has
accumulated more than enough cash to make full payment on
April 30, and won't be forced to request an extension from
creditors. By that date its senior debt-to-equity ratio will
have been reduced to 176% from 276% at June 30, 1989, it
added.</p>
<p>Lomas & Nettleton, which is managed by a unit of Lomas
Financial Corp., Dallas, engages in short-term real estate
construction and development lending. In composite trading on
the New York Stock Exchange, Lomas & Nettleton Mortgage
shares closed at $5.625, up 25 cents.</p>
