	<p class="article-leader">"Frankly, I have always found body hair a hassle." "I've
grown to hate my telephone." "Liking myself means liking diet
Jell-O." Where have we heard this before? It's the kind of
talk that's usually accompanied by Streisand on the stereo
and General Foods International Coffees, the kind that makes
a lot of men go, "Uh oh" and head for the Superbowl of
Motocross. It's that universal language called girl talk, and
it's what fills most of the pages of playwright Wendy
Wasserstein's first book of essays, "Bachelor Girls" (Knopf,
209 pages, $16.95).
   If there's one thing girl talk isn't, it's weighty, and
although Ms. Wasserstein throws in a few references to
Stendhal and Schopenhauer, to prove that nail-polish fumes
haven't completely destroyed her Mount Holyoke-educated
brain, most of the essays in Ms. Wasserstein's collection are
frivolous as can be. There are short pieces on manicures
("Nails: The Naked and the Red"), weight loss ("To Live and
Diet") and men's shopping habits ("Reflections on Leather
Rhinos"). There are candid confessions: We learn, for
instance, that Ms. Wasserstein's favorite perfumes include
L'Heure Bleue and Parure ("which, by the way, you can't get
in the States, even at Bergdorf's"), and that her underpants
of choice are Christian Dior lace-top panties.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>We may wonder why we've been elected to share these
intimacies. Wendy Wasserstein is, after all, a celebrity, a
well-known playwright whose hit show "The Heidi Chronicles"
won both a Pulitzer Prize and a Tony Award last year. Why is
she now in my living room, slathered in Nutribel Nourishing
Hydrating Emulsion and giggling about "The World's Worst
Boyfriends"?</p>
<p>The answer has to do with that official organ of girl-talk
dissemination, the woman's magazine. Many of the essays in
"Bachelor Girls" originally appeared in New York Woman's
monthly column called "The Meaning of Life." The inspiration
for each probably emerged from a chat with some
celebrity-savvy editor who called to ask, "Hey Wen, what do
you say to giving us 1,500 words about plaid?" And so the
obliging Ms. Wasserstein produced "The Good, the Plaid, and
the Ugly," in which she makes startling disclosures about her
lifetime infatuation with you-know-what.</p>
<p>To be fair, not all of the material in Ms. Wasserstein's
book is quite this dippy. Anyone who has seen one of her
plays or read an interview with her knows she is earnest,
intelligent and likable -- and these qualities are partly
visible through the hairspray-misted air of "Bachelor Girls."
There even are a few serious meditations on babies vs.
career, AIDS, and women politicians. But most of the articles
are as lightweight as summer pajamas, and, read one after the
other, their cozy confidentiality is numbing. One of the
chief delights of occasional journalism ought to be the fact
that you only have to read it occasionally.</p>
<p>Chances are anyone who caught one of Ms. Wasserstein's
articles in its original form was leafing through magazines
at a beauty parlor. Unlikely as it seems, this venerable
institution now is a breeding ground for fiction writers.
Sarah Gilbert, a graduate of Farah's Beauty School and winner
of its "Most Perms in a Month" award, has written a novel
devoted entirely to the lives of small-town beauticians. As
Ms. Gilbert noted in a press release, "It didn't take a
genius to see that my background was absolutely perfect for
writing fiction. . . . I'm just as proud of my beauty license
as I am of my Master's Degree in English."</p>
<p>Ms. Gilbert's novel, ingeniously entitled "Hairdo"
(Warner, 243 pages, $17.95), is a madcap Southern burlesque,
a cross between "A Confederacy of Dunces" and the play "Steel
Magnolias." It features Miss Ruby McSwain, proprietress of
The Celebrity Styling Shop in Stuckey, S.C., who dreams of
winning first prize at the Southeast Hair Show in Atlanta,
"the Olympics of hair." Her employees range from Yvonne
Tisdale, a bible-thumping beautician in space shoes, to blond
Ronder Jeffcoat, who's been relegated to giving bikini waxes
in the back room.</p>
<p>"Hairdo" is awash in Dippity-Do and Happy Hair, perming
solution and mousse. All kinds of insider knowledge is on
display here, including the intricacies of the finger wave,
the petal curl and something called an updo. There also is an
unkind caricature of a homosexual "hair designer" named
Thurston who wears a pink lab coat and makes declarations
such as, "I can't breathe when I'm around paisley" (Wendy
Wasserstein, take note). Despite this bit of down-home
Southern prejudice, "Hairdo" has a weird, sunny energy and a
lot of style.</p>
<p>One person who undoubtedly would be outraged by Ms.
Gilbert's portrait of the prancing Thurston is Sarah
Schulman, the gay-rights activist whose 1988 offbeat murder
story, "After Delores," had its amusing moments. Ms.
Schulman's latest novel, though, "People in Trouble" (Dutton,
228 pages, $17.95), is a mostly grim piece of propaganda
disguised as a love story between Kate, a married artist in
her 40s, and Molly, a possessive younger woman.</p>
<p>There are some vivid descriptions of squalid summers in
downtown New York, but "People in Trouble" otherwise is just
a litany of pronouncements about the horrors of AIDS, the
homeless, urban development, homophobia and middle-class
apathy. This kind of editorializing, when unconvincingly
dolled up as fiction, is more likely to elicit indifference
than outrage. At the very least it makes you want to call up
Wendy Wasserstein and discuss facials.</p>
