	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- SmithKline Beecham PLC agreed to alter its
partnership agreements with Nova Pharmaceutical Corp., giving
Nova the option to keep nearly all its potential drugs to
itself but canceling a future investment by SmithKline.
   The agreements, first reached in 1988, originally involved
SmithKline Beckman Corp., which at the time was looking for
ways to expand its interest in drugs for disorders of the
central nervous system. Last year, however, SmithKline
Beckman merged with Beecham Group PLC, which already had its
own research program in that field.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the revised agreements, Nova, a biotechnology
company in Baltimore, will reacquire the rights to most of
its central nervous system research projects. SmithKline will
cancel a $24 million investment in the partnership previously
due in 1992.</p>
<p>Nova also has the option to reacquire rights to its
bradykinin antagonists, a drug class the company hopes to
develop into pain killers and cold and allergy remedies.</p>
<p>SmithKline will retain an option to co-develop and
co-market a class of drugs for treating anxiety and
depression, unless Nova fulfills certain conditions while
buying back as many as 2.7 million Nova shares owned by
SmithKline. SmithKline will also put its psychiatric product
line into the revised partnership involving central nervous
system drugs. Nova's stake in the partnership will rise to
60% from 40%.</p>
