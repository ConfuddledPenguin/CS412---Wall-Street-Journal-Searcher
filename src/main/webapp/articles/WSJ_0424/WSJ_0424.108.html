	<p class="article-leader">BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- American Medical International
Inc. said it sold its four Swiss hospitals for about 250
million Swiss francs (US$168.4 million) to Klinik Hirslanden
AG of Zurich.
   The U.S. hospital concern has been selling assets to
reduce debt it assumed in connection with its recently
completed acquisition by IMA Holdings Corp., an investor
group. The sale is subject to the receipt of certain waivers
from Swiss authorities, American Medical said.</p>
