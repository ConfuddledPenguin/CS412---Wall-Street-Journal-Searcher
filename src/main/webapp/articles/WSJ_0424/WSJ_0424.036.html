	<p class="article-leader">SCHAUMBURG, Ill. -- Cautious buyers and a troubled
junk-bond market continued to depress merger activity in the
first quarter.
   Mergers and acquisitions announced in the first quarter
were down 13% to 597 from 685 a year earlier, according to
W.T. Grimm & Co., a unit of New York-based Merrill Lynch &
Co.'s Merrill Lynch Business Brokerage & Valuation
subsidiary. The total value of transactions plummeted 38% to
$34.3 billion from $55 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The absence of megadeals greatly contributed to the sharp
drop in value, said Beth Rosencrans, research director of the
Merrill Lynch unit. The total value of the 10 largest deals
announced in the latest first quarter was $15.7 billion --
less than the $16.1 billion acquisition, announced last
April, of SmithKline Beckman Corp. by Beecham Group PLC. The
largest transaction announced in the 1990 first quarter was
the $4.4 billion bid for UAL Corp.</p>
<p>The drop continued a downward trend that began late last
year, Ms. Rosencrans added. In the 1989 fourth quarter, the
number of deals fell 13% while the total value fell 11% from
a year earlier.</p>
<p>The number of foreign concerns bidding for U.S. companies
rose 31% to 93 from 71 last year. Simultaneously, the dollar
value of those transactions climbed 65% to $12.9 billion from
$7.8 billion.</p>
