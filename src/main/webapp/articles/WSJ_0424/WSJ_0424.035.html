	<p class="article-leader">FRANKFURT -- Lufthansa German Airlines said that it and
three other major international airline companies have signed
a letter of intent to form a world-wide computer information
network for cargo handling and logistics support services.
   A new joint venture company is to be established in
Frankfurt to develop the information system and provide the
data, which initially will be limited to the cargo and
logistics support services offered by the individual airlines
involved in the venture, Lufthansa said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It will start by offering freight forwarders and trade
and industry direct access to in-house airline cargo computer
systems and will provide schedule information, cargo
reservation, tracking and {other} value-added services," the
airline said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the 51% state-owned West German airline
stressed that the new venture won't engage in cargo haulage
or logistics management-services itself, but rather serve as
a clearing house for data concerning the freight-handling
activities and services of the airlines involved.</p>
<p>Initial Lufthansa partners will be Air France, Hong Kong's
Cathay Pacific Airways and Japan Air Lines. Financial details
of the accord weren't disclosed, but Lufthansa said other air
carriers will be invited to join the venture.</p>
<p>The agreement falls short of rumors last October of a
far-reaching linkup of air-freight operations by the
companies. At that time Japanese newspapers suggested
Lufthansa, Air France and JAL planned to combine not only
their cargo computers, but also their ground and air-cargo
systems.</p>
