	<p class="article-leader">Portland, Ore. -- It is no slam on the NBA dunkers to note
that, in recent years, the loop's playoffs have been as
predictable as the tides. All through the 1980s, one could
(and some did) make book that the Los Angeles Lakers would be
alive in June to play the team-of-the-moment from the East
for what is grandiosely -- but not inaccurately -- called the
World's Championship.
   Yes, the Lakers had to deal first with the other outfits
in the Western Conference, but they did so briskly. In making
the finals in five of the past six seasons, L.A.'s playoff
record in the West was 55 wins and 12 losses. Last year it
swept its confreres 11-0 before injuries to starting guards
Magic Johnson and Byron Scott spoiled its chances against the
Detroit Pistons in the crown round.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It's possible that this pattern might be repeated this
term. The Lakers may be Kareemless but their offense still
looks seamless, and their 63-19 mark was the league's best in
the regular campaign that ended Sunday. But it just could be
that the rest of the West could offer a stiffer test when the
playoffs commence this week.</p>
<p>Competition could come from a number of sectors. With
David Robinson, the world's tallest sailor, on board, the San
Antonio Spurs added 35 wins to their 1988-89 total of 21 and
became the league's most improved team ever. Karl Malone,
Mark Eaton and Thurl Bailey give the Utah Jazz the West's
most imposing silhouette except for the Rockies.</p>
<p>But the toughest intra-conference challenge to the Lakers
could come from the Portland Trailblazers. Tucked away in the
nation's upper left-hand corner, and usually playing too late
for the late news just about everywhere save home, the
Blazers quietly posted a 59-23 log this season, tying the
defending-champ Pistons for second best. Perhaps more
impressive, they beat the Lakers three times in five tries,
including a gargantuan, 130-88, whomping here Sunday night.</p>
<p>It would be unwise to make too much of Sunday's outcome,
because the real Lakers didn't show. Having already clinched
everything clinchable, Coach Pat Riley declared the contest
insignificant for his team. He let Scott stay home to nurse a
sprained ankle and gave three other starters -- Johnson,
James Worthy and Mychal Thompson -- a full game of bench
rest.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the Blazers claimed the "W" happily because
it allowed them to set a franchise record for most wins in a
season, and it marked the first time a Portland team ever
posted a .500 or better record against every NBA foe.</p>
<p>Those things were important, averred Rick Adelman, the
43-year-old Portland coach. "They're measuring sticks that
mark our progress," he said. "With a history like ours, we
need all the evidence of success we can get."</p>
<p>Adelman's hearkening to Blazer history is appropriate,
because he has played a unique part in it. Twenty years ago,
his sideburns down to his chops, he filled a guard post on
the franchise's first starting five, and, later, was brought
back as an assistant to Jack Ramsay, the coach who guided the
club in its sole glory year, its memorable 1977 league title.
Despite having head-coaching experience only at Chemeteka
Community College, in Salem, Ore., Adelman replaced Mike
Schuler in the Blazers' top job in the middle of last season,
which ended with a 39-43 won-lost record, and was rehired for
this one.</p>
<p>Schuler was a hard-driving type, while Adelman's is a
looser hand on the tiller, something for which many Blazers
have publicly expressed appreciation.</p>
<p>The other major change in the team came through an
off-season trade that liberated forward Buck Williams from
the New Jersey Nets for center Sam Bowie and a No. 1 draft
choice. Williams, a demon rebounder and selfless sort,
brought along a work ethic that was an improvement over what
was here.</p>
<p>"We've liked each other better, and worked harder, since
Rick and Buck came," said Clyde "The Glide" Drexler, the
dunk-master Portland guard, in the winner's locker room
Sunday. "Different people, different chemistry. Better
chemistry," affirmed Terry Porter, Drexler's guard mate.</p>
<p>With Williams joining 7-foot-tall, 270-pound center Kevin
Duckworth, and bouncy forward Jerome Kersey, the Blazers were
the NBA's best rebounding team this season. More to the
point, the always-high-scoring Portlanders gave up fewer --
points that is -- producing one of the league's best scoring
ratios.</p>
<p>"We began the season with the goals of rebounding better
and improving our defense, and we followed through," said
Adelman. "It didn't take much of a selling job. The guys
who'd been here before didn't want to keep doing what they'd
done."</p>
<p>Adelman says the final proof of the pudding was not only
in winning, but in winning on the road; Portland ended up as
one of only six NBA teams with more victories than defeats in
unfriendly confines. That their road kills included such
worthies as Boston, Philadelphia and the Lakers gives them
special hope that they'll break their dismal string of four
straight first-round playoff defeats.</p>
<p>Further proof of the Blazers' improved estate could be
found in Sunday's action. While the game was one-sided, it
was not pacific: Five technical fouls were called, including
a couple in a second-period shoving match. "Maybe they wanted
to establish something with us even with their subs in," said
Williams.</p>
<p>The unpassable Buck, eyes agleam with the pleasure of a
winning campaign after eight years in the New Jersey swamps,
also saw favorable portents in the Lakers' concession: "Maybe
Pat (Riley) figured that a `real' loss to us tonight would
give us a psychological advantage going into the playoffs, so
he sat his regulars. That would mean they're thinking about
us, wouldn't it? Well, maybe they should."</p>
