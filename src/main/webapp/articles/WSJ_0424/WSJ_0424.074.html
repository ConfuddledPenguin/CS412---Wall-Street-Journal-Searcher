	<p class="article-leader">The closest thing this country has to a national
referendum is a box on everyone's 1040 IRS form. Since 1973
filers have been asked if they wanted $1 of their taxes to go
to a presidential-election fund. Though they are explicitly
told that checking "yes" won't raise their taxes, the number
of people who want to subsidize White House aspirants is
obviously diminishing. It fell from 29% in 1980 to 20% last
year. Despite this overwhelming rejection, Washington is
overflowing with proposals at the moment to extend public
financing to Congress. Not surprisingly, no one is even
suggesting that the money be raised by giving taxpayers a
"vote" on the matter with a checkoff system for congressional
elections. The results would likely be embarrassing.</p>
