	<p class="article-leader">Michael Lesser, who joined Ogilvy & Mather barely a year
ago to turn around its troubled New York office, resigned as
the office's president after his yearlong turnaround effort
failed.
   Mr. Lesser will be replaced by Julian Clopet, 49 years
old, the highly regarded president and chief executive
officer of Ogilvy's Canadian operations. Mr. Clopet will take
on the larger title of president of North American
operations, but will concentrate at first on fixing the New
York office. He is a close associate of Ogilvy's world-wide
chairman and chief executive, Graham Phillips, who himself
had previously headed North American operations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Lesser's resignation, which was widely expected and
will take effect June 30, followed a disappointing year. When
he joined Ogilvy from Lowe Marschalk, where he had been chief
executive, Ogilvy's New York office was in poor shape. It
hadn't won any sizable accounts in many months, and morale
was sagging. One of its largest accounts, Kraft General
Foods' $50 million Maxwell House account, was up for review.</p>
<p>In the year since Mr. Lesser joined, the office hasn't
improved. Ogilvy, which was subsequently acquired by WPP
Group PLC, went on to lose the Maxwell House business. Last
month, the New York office lost the Seagram Wine Cooler
business, which had billed $15 million in 1989. It hasn't had
any significant account gains.</p>
<p>Lesser, 47, made several management changes which weren't
uniformly popular. For example, he brought in creative
heavyweight Bill Hamilton from Chiat/Day/Mojo. Mr. Hamilton,
a strong-willed executive who has been attempting to spruce
up Ogilvy's creative product, was seen by some staffers as
arrogant. Mr. Hamilton declined comment, while Mr. Lesser
couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>"The biggest challenge Ogilvy faces is to turn around the
New York office, and to date there's no visible evidence of a
turnaround," notes Emma Hill, an analyst with Wertheim & Co.
Since the New York office accounts for a large majority of
Ogilvy's U.S. business, "it's an important operation to turn
around," she says. Ogilvy's New York office has billings of
$800 million, making it larger than most entire agencies.</p>
<p>Still, analysts and industry executives said Mr. Lesser
may have faced an almost impossible job in his turnaround
attempt. The New York office's slide happened over several
years, and may well take more than a year to reverse, they
said.</p>
<p>"It clearly couldn't be mended in a year," said Alan
Gottesman, an analyst with PaineWebber. "But in less than a
year, you can probably tell if you're heading in the right
direction or not. I haven't seen any sign that they were."</p>
<p>Mr. Clopet, a 23-year Ogilvy veteran, has worked closely
with Ogilvy's chairman, Mr. Phillips, for a number of years.
The two were part of a turnaround team that reversed the
fading fortunes of Ogilvy's Canadian operations in the 1970s.</p>
<p>Mr. Clopet and Mr. Phillips are "a team that's worked
together before, that's had successes before. They have had a
good business as well as personal relationship," said Kenneth
Roman, former chairman and chief executive of Ogilvy, who
currently is a senior executive at Ogilvy client American
Express. Mr. Clopet "is a strong leader who's run a big
operation. I think he's an excellent choice."</p>
<p>In a statement, Mr. Phillips commended Mr. Lesser on his
work at Ogilvy and said he was "sad" to see him leave. He
said Mr. Lesser was leaving because "Mike would, frankly,
prefer to do something more entrepreneurial."</p>
