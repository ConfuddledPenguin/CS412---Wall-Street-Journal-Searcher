	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Southland Corp. said John Antioco, one of its
top operations and marketing executives, is leaving the
company to become chief operating officer of Pearle Inc., a
chain of optical stores.
   Mr. Antioco, 40 years old, who has spent his career at the
convenience-stores concern, became one of four Southland
senior vice presidents in 1989. He was in charge of
Southland's 7-Eleven store operations, overseeing marketing,
operations and gasoline sales at the company's 7,000 outlets.
Prior to that, he was the company's vice president,
marketing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At Dallas-based Pearle, a unit of Grand Metropolitan PLC
of London, he will oversee the operations of 1,250 retail
eyewear stores operating under the names Pearle Vision
Centers and Pearle Vision Express.</p>
<p>Both Southland and Pearle said Mr. Antioco's move isn't
related to Southland's trouble in paying its debt from its
1987 leveraged buy-out or Southland's recent agreement to
sell 75% of its equity to its Japanese partners.</p>
<p>"We've been courting him for some time," said Howard
Stanworth, Pearle chairman and chief executive officer.</p>
