	<p class="article-leader">AMES DEPARTMENT STORES Inc. (Rocky Hill, Conn.) --
Standard & Poor's Corp. said it lowered its rating on $355
million of this discount department store company's
subordinated debt to triple-C-plus from single-B-plus. The
rating concern cited "growing uncertainty" that Ames can
correct violations of its bank credit agreement, as well as
"dimmed" prospects for a turnaround of the company's
operating problems. S&P said Ames's subordinated debt remains
on its CreditWatch list with negative implications.</p>
