	<p class="article-leader">Beckman Instruments Inc. reported first-quarter net income
fell 25% to $8 million, or 28 cents a share, from $10.7
million, or 38 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales dropped
7.1% to $185.5 million from $199 million.
   The company attributed much of the decline to tight market
conditions among firms serving publicly-funded biological
research. Beckman, based in Fullerton, Calif., makes and
sells diagnostic and life-sciences laboratory instruments and
related systems.</p>

operating income before research and development costs
declined 2% to $35.5 million, while research and development
costs jumped 22% to $19.2 million. Mr. Rosso said the company
is trimming operating expenses and continuing product
development.</p>
