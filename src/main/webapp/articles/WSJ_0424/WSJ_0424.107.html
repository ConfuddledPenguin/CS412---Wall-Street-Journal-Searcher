	<p class="article-leader">MCI Communications Corp. has won two contracts: an $18
million, three-year contract from CBS Inc. in New York and a
five-year contract, valued at $2.5 million, from
Detroit-based Comp-U-Check.
   For CBS, MCI will provide its Vnet, or virtual private
network service, to all of the broadcasting company's
facilities in the U.S.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Washington-based MCI will also be providing CBS with 800
service. MCI's Vnet will be used to link CBS's 33 U.S.
locations, including its five television stations, its
corporate headquarters and broadcast center in New York,
television studios in Los Angeles, as well as news bureaus
and sales and administrative offices. MCI's Vnet will also be
used for remote broadcasts, such as sporting events. MCI will
become CBS's primary telecommunications provider.</p>
<p>For Comp-U-Check, MCI will provide its PRISM I and 800
services. Comp-U-Check's business offices were relocated to a
building adjacent to MCI's Southfield, Mich., operations
facilities, in a move that will save Comp-U-Check about
$20,000 a month in service costs.</p>
