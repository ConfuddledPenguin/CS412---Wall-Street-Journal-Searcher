	<p class="article-leader">Over-the-counter stocks slumped, with many investors
watching from the sidelines as others pounded the shares of
companies with poor earnings -- particularly Digital
Microwave and Westmark International.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index slid 5.71 to 420.08, or 1.3%,
to the lowest level since Feb. 23. Declining stocks outpaced
advancers more than two to one, while 226 issues hit new lows
and only 38 reached new highs. Volume was a light 125.9
million shares, down from 150.3 million Friday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"They're crucifying these stocks" with earnings
disappointments, said James Tarantino, head of OTC trading at
San Francisco-based Hambrecht & Quist. He added that many
investors stayed out of the market as they kept their eye on
the falling Dow Jones Industrial Average and as rising bond
yields began to look attractive.</p>
<p>"It was a chicken market," said Stephen Lieber of Lieber &
Co., manager of the $800 million Evergreen Funds in Purchase,
N.Y. Mr. Lieber said his firm was selectively buying shares
across the board, but added that offerings were "very thin"
and it was difficult to fill buy orders.</p>
<p>While earnings disappointments continued to clobber
stocks, Mr. Lieber pointed to the welcome 37% jump in shares
of Concept, a maker of medical equipment based in Largo, Fla.
Late Friday, Bristol-Myers Squibb announced it agreed to buy
Concept in a stock swap valued at $205 million. Concept
closed at 17 5/8, up 4 3/4, and was among the day's most
active issue.</p>
<p>Digital Microwave, on the other hand, lost nearly half its
market value, plunging 13 7/8 to 14 1/8. The company
announced late Friday that fourth-quarter earnings will be
substantially lower than expected. Hambrecht & Quist yanked
its purchase recommendation on shares of the San Jose,
Calif.-based maker of telecommunications equipment, according
to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. More than 2.4
million shares changed hands, better than 20 times average
daily volume.</p>
<p>Westmark International also fell hard on earnings news,
dropping 9 1/2 to 40 1/2 on 1.5 million shares, more than 12
times average volume. The Seattle, Wash.-based maker of
medical electronic equipment said that earnings for the
second quarter ending in June would fall below first-quarter
earnings of 52 cents a share reported yesterday, which
included a credit of four cents a share. The company said it
plans to increase spending for research and development.</p>
<p>In the same vein, Addington Resources dropped 1 3/4 to 16
3/4 amid expectations the Ashland, Ky., coal company will
report disappointing first-quarter earnings, according to
Professional Investor Report.</p>
<p>BayBanks gained 1 3/8 to 15 1/2 on more than three times
average volume after declaring a regular quarterly dividend.
In late March, the Boston bank said it would consider whether
to pay the dividend.</p>
<p>Pacific Bancorp gained 3/4 to 4 1/2 after the Bakersfield,
Calif., bank said late Friday it's exploring the possible
sale or merger of the concern. However, no offers are
pending.</p>
<p>Dyansen gained 9/16 to 1 15/16 amid some speculation that
the value of the company's limited editions of Erte's
sculpture would rise following the death of the artist.
However, the company told PIR that it's premature to
calculate the impact of Erte's death on the value of its
limited editions.</p>
<p>Bucking the day's trend was MCI Communications, which
added 1/8 to 34 5/8. The telecommunications giant said it
received an $18 million, three-year contract from CBS to
provide its VNET, or Virtual Private Network Service, to all
of CBS's facilities in the U.S.</p>
<p>Trading was heavy in Flow International after six senior
executives announced they are resigning from the company
effective May 1. Shares of the company fell 5/16 to 4 7/16 on
244,200 shares, well ahead of average daily volume.</p>
<p>In memoranda sent to institutional investors and the
media, the executives said that Flow, a Kent, Wash.-based
maker of waterjet systems used for industrial cutting, failed
to properly highlight three of the resignations when it
announced Friday that it may hire an investment banker to
find ways to boost shareholders' value.</p>
<p>The company's news release mentioned that the three
resignations of the controller, corporate secretary and a
vice president had been accepted. The other three were
director of international sales, director of operations and
director of engineering.</p>
<p>The company's chairman and chief executive, Michael Pao,
said in an interview the managers disagreed with him about
whether to seek a buyer for the company and whether to
abruptly or gradually close down the company's Taiwan
operation. Mr. Pao said he favors finding a buyer for the
company while its profits are expected to grow at about 30% a
year for the next two years.</p>
<p>The six managers claimed in the memoranda that the company
has failed to disclose the ongoing turmoil at the company.</p>

<p>TWELVE-HOUR TRADING:</p>
<p>In the next few weeks, the National Association of
Securities Dealers will take the first regulatory step toward
expanding the Nasdaq trading day to 12 hours for some stocks
and extending its trading system overseas.</p>
<p>The new Nasdaq system will allow market makers in London
to trade in certain Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange listed
securities as if they were in the U.S., while U.S. market
makers will be able to actively participate in the U.K.
trading day.</p>
<p>NASD attorneys are expected to file with the Securities
and Exchange Commission for the necessary rule changes within
the next month. The NASD hopes to have the system up and
running by Sept. 1.</p>
<p>However, the plans have elicited little excitement on Wall
Street, where traders would have to be up and awake between
3:30 a.m. and 9 a.m. EST, while traders in London will have
to stay at work into the dark hours.</p>
<p>"You need a lot of people doing it, otherwise it will be a
very illiquid market before hours," says Robert Rolland,
executive vice president of international equities trading at
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</p>
<p>"We think it's going to start lightly," says Joseph
Hardiman, president of the NASD. "Over time, as people become
accustomed to a new environment, we think it will grow."</p>
