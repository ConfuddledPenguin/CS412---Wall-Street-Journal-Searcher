deficits are both expected to be #1.3 billion ($2.13 billion)
in March, according to the average of expectations in a
survey of 12 economists. The data are due to be disclosed
tomorrow.
   In February, both the trade and current account deficits
totaled #1.4 billion. For all of 1989, the current account
deficit was #20.9 billion and the government has forecast a
1990 deficit of #15 billion.</p>
