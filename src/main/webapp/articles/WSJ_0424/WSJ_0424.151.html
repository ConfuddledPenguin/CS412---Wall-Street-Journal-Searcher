	<p class="article-leader">Advanced Polymer Systems Inc. said it reached a broad
development and marketing agreement with Pfizer Inc. that
could result in products that add "millions of dollars" to
Advanced Polymer's revenue stream over the next several
years.
   Advanced Polymer, Redwood City, Calif., is a five-year-old
biotechnology concern that has developed and patented a
"microsponge." The porous, polymer-based, microscopic sponge
can be programmed, through manufacturing techniques, to
control the release of a variety of substances -- from
cosmetics to flavor additives.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>John H. Williford, Advanced Polymer's chairman and chief
executive officer, said the two companies will carry on joint
efforts to research microsponge applications for various
products. These may include anti-fouling agents for marine
paints, sustained-release fragrances for air fresheners and
long-lasting, time-release adhesives.</p>
<p>He said that during the 18-month agreement New York-based
Pfizer has agreed to pay all research and development costs
on a per-product basis, in exchange for exclusive marketing
rights for any products stemming from such research. Advanced
Polymer would also receive licensing fees and royalties from
the sale of any products, Mr. Williford said.</p>
<p>The arrangement provides a generous amount of development
capital to Advanced Polymer, which had 1989 revenue of only
$2.8 million. Mr. Williford declined to estimate Pfizer's
total potential investment in R&D efforts but said it would
amount to "several hundred thousand dollars" on each product
developed.</p>
<p>Pfizer has also agreed to fund the cost of any additional
manufacturing capacity for production of products flowing
from the collaboration, Mr. Williford said.</p>
