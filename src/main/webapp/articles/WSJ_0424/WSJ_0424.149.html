	<p class="article-leader">The Democrats have few peers when it comes to
rationalizing their inability to win the presidency: one time
it's their clinker candidate, another it's the superficial
television appeal of Ronald Reagan or the "unfair" hardball
tactics of GOP strategist Lee Atwater.
   These are exercises in self-delusion. The Democrats lost
five of the past six presidential races because most
Americans have more confidence in the Republicans on the
broad issues of the economy and peace and war.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yet, during those same two decades, the Republicans'
strength actually declined at every other political level,
including Congress. Today the Democrats enjoy the same
55-to-45 advantage in the Senate that they had 20 years ago.
They have 15 more House members. The GOP, like the Democrats
on the presidential level, offer all manner of
rationalizations: redistricting, the campaign financing
system and the generous perquisites of incumbency.</p>
<p>Now there's a new GOP-inspired initiative to do something
about it: constitutionally limiting congressional terms to 12
years. Former Republican office holders and some GOP
political consultants, together with a sprinkling of
disgruntled or "populist" Democrats, have banded together to
form Americans to Limit Congressional terms. The idea
commands majority support among the public.</p>
<p>The objective, they claim, is to return to the "citizen
legislators" that the Founding Fathers envisioned. The real
goal, however, is to break the decades-old Democratic lock on
Congress.</p>
<p>There's nothing wrong with posturing for political
advantage, but the term-limitation proposal is a bad idea
that likely would have unintended consequences. It's another
of those schemes to take politics out of politics. We don't
want to take businessmen out of business or athletes out of
sports or doctors out of medicine. Nor should we try to limit
the role of politicians in politics.</p>
<p>Term limitation, by removing years of expertise from
Capitol Hill, would increase the power of the permanent
bureaucracy. "Power would flow from elected to unelected
officials," says Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institution.</p>
<p>It would enhance too the power of special interests.
Instead of fresh-faced citizen legislators we'd end up with
men and women who knew that after 12 years they had to seek a
new line of work, most probably with the very interests that
are lobbying them. "Most members today don't think about what
they're going to do next until their last term," notes Rep.
Vin Weber, a conservative Minnesota Republican. "But with a
term limitation, the clock would start ticking right away
with members thinking, `What am I going to do when I get out
of here in 12 years?' For many, the obvious answer would be
to cultivate a relationship with those who can help you
later."</p>
<p>Moreover, the premise that this would enhance GOP
prospects is dubious. In the 1980s, while Ronald Reagan was
riding high, there were 147 wide-open contests for House
seats -- elections in which there was no incumbent because of
either retirement or death; there was a net Democratic gain
in those contests of 1.</p>
<p>For years Republicans have been insisting they would
dominate politics in the South as soon as the old-time
Democrats retired. In 1981, at the dawn of the Reagan era,
Virginia seemed the model, with Republicans controlling nine
of the 10 House seats; eight years later the Democrats had
won back half of the House seats.</p>
<p>But this isn't simply a Southern phenomenon. Going back to
1972, Republicans eyed the third congressional district on
the New Jersey shore with its relatively affluent retirees.
When incumbent Democrat Jim Howard died in 1988 the GOP saw a
golden opportunity, particularly in a year in which George
Bush would carry the district by more than 60,000 votes. The
result: Frank Pallone Jr., a Democrat, won by 10,000 votes.</p>
<p>The notion of a permanently embedded Congress is an
exaggeration; two-thirds of the current members have been
there for less than 12 years. To be sure, there are some
extraordinary advantages of incumbency: campaign finance laws
and mailing privileges, are major assets. And since the
Democrats control most state legislatures, gerrymandering of
congressional districts probably adds between a half dozen
and a dozen seats to the Democratic majority in the House.</p>
<p>But far more importantly, Democrats dominate congressional
elections for the same reasons that Republicans dominate
presidential elections: The voters think they're better
suited.</p>
<p>That was dramatically evident in a Wall Street Journal-NBC
News survey in November. On the broad national challenges
pertaining to presidential leadership, the Republicans win in
a walk: a 43%-to-13% edge on dealing with the Russians, 40%
to 26% on dealing with the economy and 31% to 17% on keeping
world peace. But when it came to the day-to-day
quality-of-life issues, voters are just as decidedly
pro-Democratic: 36% to 15% on protecting the environment, 30%
to 15% on education and 44% to 21% on helping the middle
class.</p>
<p>"Just as Democrats have not gotten their act together in
speaking coherently about broad national interests neither
have the Republicans gotten our act together about how
government responds to personal and local needs," says Rep.
Vin Weber. "That is much more our problem than incumbency."
Republicans like Rep. Weber -- and Jack Kemp and Newt
Gingrich -- have been trying to fashion responsive Republican
alternatives, but they still have a ways to go.</p>
<p>Republicans also would do well to remember 40 years ago
when they used term limitations to do what they never could
do to the late Franklin Roosevelt in life: enact the 22nd
Amendment limiting presidents to two terms. Since then it has
affected two presidents: Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan.</p>
