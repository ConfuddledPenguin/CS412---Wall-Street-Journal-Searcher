	<p class="article-leader">DEERFIELD, Ill. -- Premark International Inc. said it
agreed to acquire Sikes Corp. for $16.40 a share, or about
$201 million.
   The consumer and restaurant products concern also reported
a 41% drop in its first-quarter earnings due to declining
performance at its Tupperware unit and Food Equipment Group.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under its agreement with Sikes, Premark said it will soon
launch a tender offer for all of the Lakeland, Fla.,
concern's roughly 11 million Class A common shares
outstanding at $16.40 a share; Premark also will purchase
861,136 Class B Sikes common shares for $26.78 apiece.</p>
<p>Acquisition of Sikes, a maker of ceramic tile, will mark a
"major step forward" in the company's bid to increase its
presence in the decorative building products industry,
Premark said. Sikes had sales of $137 million for its fiscal
year ended Feb. 28.</p>
<p>The transaction, to be financed with cash on hand and
short-term borrowing, is subject, among other things, to
antitrust clearance and the tender of a majority of Sikes's
Class A shares on a fully diluted basis.</p>
<p>In the latest period, Premark had net income of $13.2
million, or 39 cents a share, compared with $22.4 million, or
64 cents a share in the first quarter of 1989. Sales rose
2.8% to $620.1 million from $603 million.</p>
<p>Profit at Tupperware was hurt by lower sales in Latin
America, the U.S. and Japan, and higher expenses in Europe.
Premark said that although the Food Equipment Group reported
higher sales, profit fell primarily because of lower domestic
production volume and reduced margins.</p>
<p>Premark also said it expects lower profit for the second
quarter as "declining dealer activity remains a challenge for
Tupperware's U.S. business and difficult industry conditions
hamper its food equipment group's domestic operations," as
well as certain other businesses.</p>
<p>In the second quarter of 1989, Premark earned $23.7
million, or 68 cents a share, on sales of $657.9 million.</p>
<p>The company added that results for the full year remain
"uncertain at this time;" it continues to be "optimistic
long-term."</p>
<p>News of the tender offer sparked a jump in Sikes shares,
which closed at $16.125, up $3.875, in composite American
Stock Exchange trading. In composite New York Stock Exchange
trading, Premark shares slipped 12.5 cents to close at
$22.625.</p>
<p>Late yesterday, Moody's Investors Service placed Premark's
approximately $230 million in long-term debt under review for
a possible downgrade. The rating company said its review will
focus on the increased leverage and "lower coverage
measurements" that would result from the acquisition, "as
well as {Premark's} continuing weaker profitability." Moody's
also said it will examine the "potential synergies"
management expects to obtain from the deal.</p>
