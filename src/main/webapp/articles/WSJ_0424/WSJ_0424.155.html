	<p class="article-leader">SANTA ANA, Calif. -- EECO Inc. said it might seek
bankruptcy-law protection from creditors if Sanwa Bank of
California declares the high-technology electronics products
maker's $10 million credit agreement in default.
   The accord expired March 31.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>EECO's stock didn't open for trading yesterday on the
American Stock Exchange because of the news. Friday, the
shares closed at $1.75, unchanged.</p>
<p>Late yesterday, EECO said it had recommended that the
exchange suspend trading in its stock until "its financial
condition is clarified." The company said it didn't know when
that might be.</p>
<p>EECO said that if Sanwa calls the loan, the company could
have trouble getting other funding because of its poor
financial condition. The company then would have to consider
other options, it said, "including a restructuring under the
protection of Chapter 11" of the federal Bankruptcy Code.</p>
<p>Robert Bonney, EECO chairman and chief executive officer,
said in an interview that Sanwa has held off declaring the
agreement in default while the company pursued the sale of
some or all of its businesses. But he added that Sanwa "could
call the loan at any time."</p>
<p>Sanwa declined to comment.</p>
<p>EECO has said it expects to report a $10.3 million net
loss for 1989. Posting of its financial results had been
delayed by a proposed sale of its Maxi-Switch computer
keyboard unit. In 1988, EECO had a loss of $13.2 million, on
sales of $13.9 million.</p>
<p>The company also said that negotiations with a potential
purchaser of Maxi-Switch had broken off. Terms of the
proposed sale, EECO said, weren't satisfactory to Sanwa,
which holds liens on the unit's assets. The company said it
is in preliminary discussions with two new possible buyers of
the unit.</p>
