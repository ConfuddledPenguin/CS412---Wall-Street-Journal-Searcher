	<p class="article-leader">Interest rate fears continued to batter stock prices,
though bond prices declined only modestly.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 29.28 points to
2666.67 in light trading. Long-term bond prices lost about a
quarter of a point, or about $2.50 for each $1,000 of face
amount. Though small, the decline was the seventh consecutive
drop. The dollar rose sharply against the West German mark,
but much less markedly against the Japanese yen.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts said the decline in stocks was a continuation of
the inflation and interest rate worries that pushed the Dow
Jones Industrial Average down nearly 56 points last week to
its lowest level in more than a month.</p>
<p>Last week's market activity was led by the bond market,
where investors bid prices down sharply. As bond prices fell,
the interest rates on those securities rose, posing a threat
to already sluggish economic growth and giving investors an
attractive alternative to stocks. Although the bond price
decline moderated considerably yesterday, analysts said the
likelihood of further rate increases, including the
possibility that the Federal Reserve might soon push
short-term rates higher, continued to frighten investors away
from stocks.</p>
<p>There also are worries that Japanese investors will be
assuming a much lower profile in the U.S. bond market in
coming months, a development that also could drive interest
rates higher. James Solloway, chief economist at Argus
Research in New York, noted that while Japanese investors
aren't the largest block of bondholders in the market, they
are influential. And with interest rates in Japan approaching
7.25%, the real returns available to them in Japan are about
as good as they are here without the currency risk of
investing in dollar-denominated securities.</p>
<p>Mr. Solloway, contending stocks already are overvalued at
current interest rates, said there is likely to be a
psychological reaction among investors if the yield on the
Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rises to 9%. The yield is
at 8.96%.</p>
<p>"It's very difficult for stocks to beat a 9% yield on a
long-term basis," said Mr. Solloway. He suggests that stock
prices could tumble 10% to 15% if interest rates rise much
further.</p>
<p>The dollar's rise against the West German mark followed
published reports that German monetary union will include a
one-to-one exchange rate for the bulk of East German savings
as well as wages and pensions. Currency traders said a broad
one-to-one exchange rate between the two Germanies'
currencies would be inflationary. The West German Bundesbank
has said it opposes a one-to-one exchange rate and central
bank officials have threatened to drive interest rates higher
if such an exchange rate is approved.</p>
<p>In major market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices sank in light trading. Volume on the New York
Stock Exchange totaled 136.2 million shares. Declining issues
on the Big Board were ahead of gainers 1229 to 328.</p>
<p>Bond prices eased. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
issue rose to 8.96%.</p>
<p>The dollar strengthened against most major currencies. In
late New York trading the dollar was quoted at 1.6996 marks
and 157.60 yen compared with 1.6995 marks and 157.45 yen
Friday.</p>
