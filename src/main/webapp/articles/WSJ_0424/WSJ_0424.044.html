	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court, in a Virginia bank merger
case, agreed to decide when a proxy statement may serve as
the basis for seeking damages under federal securities law.
   The justices must decide whether shareholders may sue a
company and its directors over an allegedly misleading proxy
statement, when the alleged misstatements couldn't have
affected the outcome of the proxy fight. The justices must
also decide whether a proxy statement must disclose all the
motives of directors who recommend a merger.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>These two issues, although technical, have substantial
practical importance. The American Corporate Counsel
Association, a trade group for corporate general counsels,
said in a friend-of-the-court brief that many proxy disputes
are matters of state law and don't involve federal securities
law. As state-law issues, proxy disputes are subject to caps
on damages that many states have set for the liability of
individual directors. But when these cases are transformed
into federal-law disputes, the limits don't apply and
directors face greater potential liability.</p>
<p>The high court agreed to hear an appeal by First American
Bankshares Inc., First American Bank of Virginia and its
directors in a dispute over a complicated merger. A First
American Bankshares unit, Virginia Bankshares Inc., which
already had an 85% interest in First American Bank of
Virginia, acquired the remaining 15% in 1987.</p>
<p>According to Virginia law, the bank was required to
consult the holders of the remaining 15% before the merger
could be completed. The minority shareholders were informed
in a proxy statement of the merger at a $42-a-share price.</p>
<p>The proxy statement said the $42 price was approved
because it was fair and in the best interests of
shareholders. The price was based on a review by an
investment adviser hired by First American Bankshares, the
proxy statement said.</p>
<p>A minority shareholder, Doris Sandberg, sued for
violations of federal securities law and state law; she also
asked that the case be treated as a class action on behalf of
all minority shareholders.</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleged that the proxy statement was
misleading because it failed to disclose that First American
Bank of Virginia's directors recommended approval of the
merger because they wanted to keep their positions and avoid
being replaced at the behest of First American Bankshares.
The holding concern is led by Chairman Clark Clifford, a
prominent Washington lawyer.</p>
<p>The state-law claim was that the bank should have hired an
outside firm, and not have relied on First American
Bankshares' adviser.</p>
<p>A federal court jury awarded Ms. Sandberg an additional
$18 a share, or $43,956, for the misleading proxy statement
under federal securities law, and for breach of fiduciary
duty under state law. But the judge refused to treat the case
as a class action. After the verdict, 69 other minority
holders filed an identical lawsuit and were awarded $18 a
share, or $3.3 million.</p>
<p>Last December, a federal appeals court in Richmond, Va.,
upheld the two verdicts and ordered that the first lawsuit be
reopened as a class action, allowing other minority
shareholders to file claims. The appeals court rejected the
bank's argument that proxy lawsuits under federal law must
allege that the result of the merger fight would have been
different if there hadn't been misleading statements.</p>
<p>The liability for the federal securities violations, the
federal court said, is shared by the companies and the bank's
directors, while the liability on the state-law claims is
only against the directors. On paper, the verdicts for the
federal-law and state-law claims are the same, with the
shareholders entitled to only one award or the other, but not
both.</p>
<p>However, because Virginia, like many states, has placed a
$100,000 limit on a corporate director's individual
liability, sizable verdicts based on state law will almost
always be reduced. In the second of the two lawsuits, for
example, the 69 shareholders would select the federal-law
verdict of $3.3 million, because the damages would be limited
by the cap under the state-law claims to $2.3 million.</p>
<p>If after hearing arguments in the fall, the high court
upholds the verdicts, the companies and the bank's directors
may face an additional $13 million in liability under federal
law from the class action.</p>
<p>In their Supreme Court appeal, the companies and directors
argued that the appeals court decision "expands the scope of
federal proxy regulation" and turns "federal proxy law into
an insurance scheme for investors. . . ." (Virginia
Bankshares Inc. vs. Sandberg)</p>
