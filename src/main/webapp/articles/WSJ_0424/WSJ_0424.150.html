	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- Ray Howell, a key witness in a federal probe of
political contributions by a Southern Co. unit, pleaded
guilty to contempt and tax charges. And he agreed to
cooperate in a continuing investigation related to the giant
electric utility.
   Mr. Howell, who was a vendor for Southern's Pensacola,
Fla., Gulf Power Co. unit, vanished from an Atlanta hotel
room in December 1988 on the eve of his scheduled appearance
before a federal grand jury. He went into hiding for a year
but surrendered to authorities in December, saying he had run
out of money.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Federal investigators were expected to question Mr. Howell
yesterday and today, his attorney said. Individuals familiar
with the investigation say he can give details of the roles
played by others in the political-contributions scheme.</p>
<p>In October, Gulf Power pleaded guilty to two felony
charges of conspiracy to make illegal political contributions
and tax evasion and paid a $500,000 fine. Papers filed in a
federal court in Atlanta in that case alleged that Gulf Power
used Mr. Howell's Design Associates Inc. to channel money to
the 1988 campaign of Florida state Sen. W.D. Childers.
Federal law prohibits utility holding companies from making
political contributions.</p>
<p>Gulf Power's plea ended the case against it, but it
doesn't bar prosecutors from pursuing charges against
individuals, such as employees or politicians. Neither Sen.
Childers nor any other elected official or employee has been
charged with any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>In an interview, Sen. Childers said: "I don't have any
knowledge, and I haven't seen any proof that Gulf Power
funneled any money to my campaign."</p>
<p>John Hutchinson, a spokesman for Gulf Power, said Mr.
Howell's plea "closes another chapter."</p>
<p>Mr. Howell's contempt charge relates to his failure to
appear before the grand jury; the tax charge involves filing
a false corporate tax return in 1987. He faces as long as
five years in prison on the tax charge; his sentence for the
contempt count is largely up to the court's discretion. He is
scheduled to be sentenced June 27.</p>
<p>Suzanne Hashimi, Mr. Howell's public defender, declined to
discuss what Mr. Howell might tell investigators.</p>
<p>Mr. Howell wants to go into the federal witness protection
program, his attorney said. As part of the plea bargain
agreement, federal prosecutors said they will help him apply
for the program "should the circumstances warrant."</p>
<p>Ms. Hashimi declined to say whether Mr. Howell, who is
jailed in the federal prison in Atlanta, has been threatened,
but she said she is worried about his safety. "Only a fool
wouldn't be, with Jake Horton dead," Ms. Hashimi said. "Part
of the reason he is not on bond is for his own protection."</p>
<p>Jacob F. "Jake" Horton, a Gulf Power executive who oversaw
the contributions scheme, was killed in a fiery crash of a
corporate plane last April. The National Transportation
Safety Board is expected to release a final report on the
crash soon.</p>
<p>In a counterclaim to a civil suit filed in a federal court
in Pensacola by Mr. Horton's estate, Southern Co. Services
Inc. asserts that Mr. Horton deliberately caused the crash
himself. Just before the crash, Mr. Horton had been advised
that a Gulf Power audit committee had recommended his ouster
because of invoice irregularities related to the political
contributions scheme.</p>
<p>A federal grand jury is continuing other aspects of its
Southern Co. investigation, including an examination of
whether a method of accounting for spare parts resulted in a
deliberate underpayment of federal income taxes and a probe
into certain pension-fund transactions.</p>
