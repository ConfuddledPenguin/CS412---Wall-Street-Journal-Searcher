	<p class="article-leader">BONN -- In a bid to reassure East Germans worried about
losing their life savings in a monetary union, the West
German government unveiled the outlines of a generous plan
for merging the two nations' currencies.
   Under the proposal, individual East German wages and
savings of as much as 4,000 marks ($2,373) would be changed
into West German marks at a favorable one-to-one rate.
Pensions also would be swapped on that basis, giving retirees
more spending power than they now have.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The offer -- still only an opening position for the coming
negotiations -- is a major concession to the East German
government, which argued that East German workers need to be
cushioned during their bumpy transition to a market economy.</p>
<p>As the two nations hurtle toward economic and monetary
union, now set for as early as this July, Bonn is under
pressure to offer a favorable package to the East. East
Germany heavily subsidizes everything from housing to
groceries, and many East Germans fear they would become the
permanent underclass in a united Germany unless something is
done to put more money in their pockets.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, West Germans have begun to balk at shouldering
the bulk of the costs of unity. Many in the West, including
officials of the powerful Bundesbank, or central bank, say a
generous exchange rate would fuel inflation and raise
interest rates.</p>
<p>As a compromise, the West Germans are proposing exchanging
savings above 4,000 marks at a less-favorable two-to-one
rate. Debts held by individual East Germans and businesses
also would be exchanged at the lower rate.</p>
<p>Beyond this, the plan leaves plenty of room for
negotiation. For example, while calling for one-to-one parity
in wages, the plan says nothing about how wage rates would
actually be set. Many workers could still see their relative
wages fall as managers introduce free-market mechanisms and
negotiate new union contracts.</p>
<p>As if to underscore such uncertainties, East German
Finance Minister Walter Romberg yesterday predicted that at
least 20% of the East's crumbling factories could go out of
business once the two economies integrated. An additional 50%
would need financial help to survive, he said, while only 30%
would be fit to compete on their own. Against this
background, West German officials say they had little choice
but to offer generous terms.</p>
<p>East Germans continue to flow into the West, albeit more
slowly than earlier this year. Unless West Germany can offer
a package that reassures East Germans that they aren't better
off moving to the West, this exodus could continue.</p>
<p>"We feel this proposal is a good offer for the beginning,"
says one top aide to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The
aide adds that the West German leader has stayed in close
contact with his East German counterpart, Prime Minister
Lothar de Maiziere, and that Bonn "got signals" that East
Berlin was ready to strike a compromise on these sensitive
issues. Only after such basic questions are clarified can the
two countries grapple with the complex details involved in
full monetary union.</p>
<p>The East Germans wasted no time in responding to the
offer. Mr. de Maiziere will be in Bonn today to discuss the
plan with Mr. Kohl and expert-level negotiations might begin
within a week. An East German government spokesman dubbed the
plan "an acceptable basis for negotiations." But Wolfgang
Ullman, vice president of the East German parliament,
criticized the one-to-one limit on exchanging savings.</p>
<p>"If this is the final decision," he said, "there should be
sharp protest, because a large part of savings won't be
considered here."</p>
<p>The West German plan is supposed to do two things, calm
the fears of East Germans and remain manageable for the
powerful West German economy. West German Finance Minister
Theo Waigel, speaking to his European Community counterparts
in Luxembourg yesterday, said the proposal wouldn't boost
West German inflation. He said increased East German savings,
prompted by introduction of market interest rates, would
offset inflationary pressure created by the injection of West
German marks into the East.</p>
<p>Sources at the Bundesbank, however, made it clear that
they remain dubious supporters of the plan. "It's a
government decision, and it is they who in the end must carry
the responsibility," said a Bundesbank official. "Anyway, it
is our impression that this is merely a proposal that must
first be negotiated with the DDR {East Germany}."</p>
<p>Most East Germans have less than 4,000 marks in their bank
accounts, one reason this figure was chosen as a cutoff
point. But the people with huge savings accounts are often
former entrepreneurs who were forced to sell their businesses
to the state during the years of communist dictatorship.
These are the same people who now would be most likely to
invest in new businesses.</p>
<p>Groups representing East German entrepreneurs already have
called for exemptions from the exchange limits to allow
people to use their savings to build up new ventures. But
working out such exemptions will be difficult, considering
the pressure to move quickly.</p>
<p>The West German plan leaves many of the most complex
problems untouched. It says nothing, for instance, about the
introduction of a West German-style taxation system or other
details on economic and monetary union.</p>
<p>The most generous aspect of the proposal is its treatment
of pensions. Retirees in East Germany get about 450 marks a
month, about one-third of their West German counterparts. A
one-to-one exchange would doom East German retirees to
poverty.</p>
<p>So the West Germans recommended that the East adopt a
pension system styled on their own, with pensions pegged to
70% of the average net income over 45 years of employment.
The result, in many cases, will be hefty pension increases.</p>
