	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Peter Monroe, an official with the
Department of Housing and Urban Development, is expected to
be named to a top position in the savings and loan bailout
operation, industry and administration sources said.
   Mr. Monroe, a deputy assistant HUD secretary for housing,
would serve as the president and chief executive officer of
the Oversight Board of the Resolution Trust Corp., a role
that was initially the subject of some dispute. The Oversight
Board sets policy for the RTC, which sells or liquidates
insolvent thrifts and their assets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Monroe would succeed William Taylor, a Federal Reserve
Board official who has served in the post on a temporary
basis since February. Mr. Taylor followed Daniel Kearney, a
former Salomon Brothers Inc. executive, who resigned in
February after just four months on the job. In resigning, Mr.
Kearney said unanticipated limitations had been placed on his
authority.</p>
<p>Some in Congress have called for abolishing the Oversight
Board or streamlining the bailout operation in some way. The
board is perched at the top of the multilayered S&L bailout
bureaucracy. It is made up of Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and HUD Secretary Jack
Kemp.</p>
<p>Mr. Monroe would head the board's staff of several dozen
people. After the earlier confusion, it seems certain that
the responsibilities of the post will be clarified before it
is filled.</p>
<p>The RTC, which has a board that's separate from the
Oversight Board, carries out the sales of the thrifts, using
mostly personnel from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</p>
<p>Mr. Monroe didn't return telephone calls yesterday, and a
HUD spokesman declined to comment. Mr. Monroe has met with
several administration officials who have a role in making
the selection. The Oversight Board held a closed-door meeting
yesterday on the post.</p>
<p>Mr. Taylor, who is director of the Fed's division of
banking supervision and regulation, wasn't a candidate for
the post. Under his direction, however, the Oversight Board
made headway on setting sales policies, including sweetening
some terms to attract more bidders.</p>
