	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Ingersoll Newspapers Inc. has extended its
cash tender offer to holders of an affiliate's junk bonds,
but it probably will have to sweeten the offer because it
hasn't attracted a single bondholder.
   The financially strapped newspaper holding company, which
is controlled by Ralph Ingersoll, made an offer last month to
buy back about $240 million of junk bonds at a deep discount
to their face value. The newspaper company is struggling to
avoid default on its heavy debt load at a time of slumping
newspaper advertising sales. Community Newspapers Inc., the
issuer of the bonds, publishes daily and weekly newspapers in
Ohio and New York.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But bondholders who objected both to the price and the
structure of the deal organized an unusual, total boycott of
the offer. Since no bondholder accepted the offer for 13%
"reset" bonds and discount debentures by midnight EDT last
Friday, Ingersoll said it will extend the offer until
midnight May 4.</p>
<p>James Rubin of Sass Lamle Rubin & Co., which is a holder
of the bonds and helped organize the group of disgruntled
bondholders, said the holders won't tender their bonds until
the offer is improved, but he expects that to happen. "They
have solicited our assistance in formulating a more
acceptable recapitalization," Mr. Rubin said. "We're
optimistic that a successful solution can be achieved.</p>
<p>Ingersoll executives couldn't be reached for comment, but
the company is under serious time pressure to resolve the
matter. That's because of a provision covering about $125
million of the bonds, whose interest payments must be reset
by July 7 to make up for a drop in the bonds' price, an event
Ingersoll can't afford to let happen considering its
financially weakened state.</p>
<p>Mr. Rubin said the bondholders' biggest objection is to
the structure of the offer. Only a portion of the holders'
bonds are to be tendered and the outstanding ones "are going
to have severely reduced protective covenants that could
render them worthless or near-worthless in certain
scenarios," said Mr. Rubin.</p>
<p>Then there's the question of price. Analysts have said the
junk bonds are worth about 80% of their value, though they've
traded recently at 40%. Ingersoll offered 55% for the senior
bonds and 25% for the junior bonds, said Mr. Rubin. "We think
. . . bondholders are probably willing to accept somewhere
around 80% and 40%, respectively, if it's resolved quickly,"
he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Rubin said that if Ingersoll doesn't reset its bonds,
"it's a monetary default and we could accelerate the
indebtedness, and I sincerely doubt they could pay off the
entire principal amount in response." Such a crisis could tip
Ingersoll into bankruptcy proceedings, said Mr. Rubin. But
people close to Ingersoll say bondholders would also be hurt
by losses and delays in payment that would result from a
bankrupcty filing.</p>
