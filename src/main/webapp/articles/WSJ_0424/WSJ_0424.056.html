	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it
upgraded its rating on American Telephone & Telegraph Co.'s
$9.2 billion in senior debt, the first such boost for the
company since the 1984 breakup of the Bell System.
   The rating concern said it based the upgrade, to
double-A-3 from single-A-1, on AT&T's recent reorganization
into a "much more efficient and competitive business entity .
. . {and its} ongoing cost reduction programs." Moody's said
the steps would improve profit and cash flow, noting that
AT&T has put most of its large restructuring costs behind it.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>An AT&T spokesman said of the action by Moody's, "They
reflect the same optimism we have."</p>
<p>The new rating isn't the highest ever at AT&T. In 1982,
when the company still owned and ran the Bell System, its
senior debt was rated triple-A-3.</p>
<p>Moody's said on March 12 that it was considering the
upgrade, which includes AT&T Euronotes and Eurobonds and
senior debts of AT&T Credit Corp. and AT&T Technologies Inc.,
which are guaranteed by the parent.</p>
<p>Moody's on Feb. 1 confirmed its single-A-1 rating for the
telecommunications company.</p>
<p>The latest announcement said AT&T's reorganization,
together with cost-cutting, will result in "enhanced
profitability and more predictable cash flow protection for
debt." Cash flow is net income plus depreciation. Moody's
said it assumes that new pricing flexibility being allowed by
the Federal Communications Commission for long-distance
services will continue.</p>
<p>Moody's said it expects that AT&T's debt will remain
relatively high during the intermediate term, as the company
continues to spend heavily for global competition through
internal growth and acquisitions in both its manufacturing
businesses and financial services.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
AT&T shares closed at $40.375, down 50 cents.</p>
