	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- Browning-Ferris Industries Inc. reported a loss
of $226.3 million, or $1.48 a share, for its second quarter
ended March 31, reflecting a previously announced charge to
exit the hazardous-waste business.
   Earlier this month, the waste management concern disclosed
the $295 million charge. The firm has been buffeted by low
margins and regulatory problems in its hazardous-waste
business and plans to focus on solid waste, recycling and
medical-waste disposal.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Revenue was $708.5 million. In the year-ago second
quarter, Browning had net income of $58.8 million, or 39
cents a share, on restated revenue of $582.3 million.</p>
<p>Results for the year-ago period were restated to reflect
the discontinued hazardous-waste operation.</p>
<p>In the six months, Browning-Ferris had a loss of $159.8
million, or $1.05 a share, compared with net of $118.4
million, or 79 cents a share. Revenue increased to $1.41
billion from a restated $1.15 billion.</p>
