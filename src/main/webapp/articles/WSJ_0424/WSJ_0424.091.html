	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- Next time you attend a meeting of the
Sierra Club, look for the big guy with the green scales.
   Godzilla has joined the environmental movement.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The fabled Japanese low-budget-movie monster has been
adopted as the mascot of two San Francisco-based
environmental groups that are trying to pressure Japan into
halting lumber imports from endangered tropical rain forests.</p>
<p>The groups, the Rainforest Action Network and the
International Rivers Network, point out that Godzilla
historically has been "Japan's leading environmentalist." He
merits this title because, in all of the old Godzilla movies,
he is motivated to attack and destroy cities only after
humans have messed with his habitat. He was also created by
an environmental disaster -- a nuclear explosion -- and has
to go around gobbling up nuclear power plants just to
maintain a well-balanced diet.</p>
<p>This, according to Rainforest Action's Pamela Wellner,
makes him an appropriate spokesthing for conservationists
worried about what they contend is Japanese corporate
despoliation of Third World environments through logging of
tropical hardwood forests.</p>
<p>"Japan's monstrous destructive capacity requires monstrous
solutions," adds Juliette Majot of the International Rivers
group. Ms. Majot and Ms. Wellner not long ago joined Godzilla
-- who looked trim and petite at a mere nine-feet tall -- in
a picket of the U.S. headquarters of Mitsubishi Corp. here. A
half-dozen large, helium-filled Godzilla look-alikes floated
menacingly above the picket lines.</p>
<p>Godzilla and the human pickets accuse Mitsubishi of
conducting, through subsidiaries, 24-hour logging operations
that are destroying forests, and uprooting indigenous people,
in remote areas of Borneo.</p>
<p>A Mitsubishi spokesman confirms that Godzilla made a brief
"20-minute appearance" outside the company's San Francisco
office. He declines to comment further on the monster, except
to say the issues raised by Godzilla were being addressed by
the company's environmental-affairs division in Tokyo.</p>
<p>To some people, the whole affair might look like monstrous
Japan bashing. But Godzilla, in a news release, spurns such
criticism; he notes that he is Japanese himself, and in
solidarity with Japanese environmental groups, adding: "We're
not just a bunch of whining creeps out to bash Japan. It's
time to take them on."</p>
