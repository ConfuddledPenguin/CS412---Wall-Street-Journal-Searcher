	<p class="article-leader">Your Friday, April 20, article presents an inaccurate
picture of Sotheby's views of the art market, and does not
reflect the substance of the conversation I had with the
reporter.
   The discussion of reserves with consignors is a perfectly
normal aspect of the art-auction business that has been
completely misrepresented to indicate a concern about the
market that simply does not exist. The confidence that we do
feel going forward into May was omitted from her report. For
the record, the quality of paintings in our May sales is
unparalleled, with excellent works that have not been on the
market for a long time. We are seeing world-wide interest in
these paintings, and have every expectation that the May
sales will be successful and that the art market will
continue its strong performance.</p>
