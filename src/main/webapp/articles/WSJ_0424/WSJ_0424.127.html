	<p class="article-leader">MANILA, the Philippines -- Powerless Mondays arrived in
Manila, causing thousands of companies to begin a series of
once-a-week closings.
   The daylong power cut, which didn't affect factories,
marked the most severe step yet to ease the country's serious
power shortage. Together with water shortages, traffic jams
and continuing concerns about political instability, the cut
added to the frayed nerves in the capital that have
accompanied the heat.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It's really ridiculous," said an American chemicals
manufacturer who spent much of Monday operating from his
apartment terrace dressed in shorts and a T-shirt. "Something
should have been done a long time ago."</p>
<p>Foreign business executives have said for months that the
power crisis will further hinder the efforts by the
Philippines to attract new investment. Those efforts already
have been hurt by December's coup attempt and perceptions of
continued political instability.</p>
<p>The program of Monday power cuts, which was announced last
month and affects all of Luzon island, is aimed at minimizing
the impact of the electricity shortage during the rest of the
week. Under the plan, offices agree to institute four-day
workweeks in return for government assurances that power cuts
on other days will be minimal. During the past month,
businesses, factories and residences have endured four to six
hours a day without electricity.</p>
<p>Although factories aren't participating in the plan, the
government has asked them to voluntarily shut down or use
emergency generators for as long as 12 hours a day once a
week.</p>
<p>The government has said the Monday cuts will continue at
least through May.</p>
