	<p class="article-leader">Varian Associates Inc., Palo Alto, Calif., said net income
declined 35% in the fiscal second quarter to $7.8 million, or
40 cents a share, from $12 million, or 58 cents a share, a
year earlier.
   The high-technology concern said revenue in the period
ended March 30 dropped 7.6% to $331.5 million from $358.6
million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company said the earnings decline primarily reflects
lower results from semiconductor equipment operations, where
weakened demand and lower profit margins on key new products
combined to hurt profit. The company said it is attempting to
reposition a number of its strategies and business, but said
the efforts are too premature to discuss in detail.</p>
<p>In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Varian closed at $23.375, down 50 cents.</p>
<p>In the first half, net fell 28% to $15.4 million, or 79
cents a share, from $21.4 million, or $1.02 a share, a year
earlier. Revenue rose to $649.2 million from $646 million.</p>
