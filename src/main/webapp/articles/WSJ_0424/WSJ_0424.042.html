	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- The Finance Ministry has decided to require
domestic securities companies to file a report whenever there
is a change in major shareholders.
   Ministry officials said the securities houses, numbering
some 220, will be notified of the decision this week.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The step will be taken, one official said, in an effort to
"ensure the independence of securities companies," indicating
that the ministry is anxious to prevent unfriendly takeovers
just when the financial conditions of securities houses,
especially smaller ones, have been deteriorating as a result
of recent sharp declines in the Tokyo stock market.</p>
<p>Specifically, officials said, the securities companies are
to report when someone acquires more than 5% of the
outstanding shares or when a shareholder who already owns
more than 5% buys or sells more than 1% of his shares.</p>
<p>A report is to be filed when talks start in the case of
friendly share acquisitions or when a securities company
finds out about major shareholder changes in the case of
hostile purchases, according to officials.</p>
