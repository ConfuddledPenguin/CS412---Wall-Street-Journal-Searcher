	<p class="article-leader">SANTA BARBARA, Calif. -- Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara,
aided by a debt swap, said first-quarter net income surged
sevenfold to $37.7 million, or $1.71 a share, from a restated
$5.3 million, or 86 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Financial Corp. said the increase was the result of
restructuring efforts that included an equity-for-debt swap.
The swap lifted Santa Barbara Savings & Loan Association, the
principle subsidiary of Financial Corp., out of insolvency,
although the S&L remains significantly undercapitalized with
tangible capital of 0.6%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under last summer's thrift-rescue bill, thrifts are
required to maintain a tangible capital ratio of 1.5%
currently and of 3% by the end of 1994. Tangible capital is
the excess of real assets, excluding intangible assets such
as good will, over liabilities.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Financial Corp. stock closed at 15.625 cents, unchanged.</p>
<p>In a statement, Philip R. Brinkerhoff, Financial Corp.'s
chairman, president and chief executive officer, said the
company will continue to "aggressively pursue opportunities
to increase capital, including capital infusion or sale."</p>
<p>The company's restructuring efforts included a debt swap
in January that resulted in an extraordinary gain of $36.5
million and a $50 million addition to tangible capital. The
exchange offer provided for the company to issue 17 million
new common shares for preferred stock, subordinated
debentures and notes.</p>
<p>The year-earlier quarter was restated to recognize a
one-time $3.2 million gain from a change in accounting
methods, Financial Corp. said. The financial-services concern
has assets of $4.3 billion.</p>
