	<p class="article-leader">SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Pacific West Cable Co. and an
affiliate filed a lawsuit in state superior court here
against Turner Broadcasting System Inc. in a dispute over
Turner's cable programming.
   At issue, according to Pacific West, is a new cable
technology that allows companies to beam cable programming
into homes without the use of cables. But Pacific West
alleges that Turner Broadcasting wants to do business only
with operators that use cable because wiring a neighborhood
for cable television limits availability and thus enhances
the value of Turner's programming.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the suit, which seeks $25 million in punitive damages,
Pacific West said Turner maintains that use of the wireless
technology violates the programming agreement between Turner
and Pacific West, although Pacific West said there is no such
ban in its agreement. In Atlanta, Turner said it doesn't
comment on pending litigation.</p>
<p>In its suit, Pacific West said it has attempted to resolve
its differences with Turner but said its overtures have been
rebuffed.</p>
