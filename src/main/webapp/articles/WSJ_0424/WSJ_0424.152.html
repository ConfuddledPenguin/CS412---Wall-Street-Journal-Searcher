	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Most Americans are used to seeing Japan's big
auto makers roll all over Detroit. But here's a surprise:
They're also running some of their smaller Japanese rivals
right off the road.
   "It's clear that Japan simply has too many auto
companies," says Paul Fraker, an analyst who tracks Japan's
11 car and truck companies for London-based Baring
Securities. "By the end of the decade, competition will thin
the ranks of Japanese auto makers to four or five groups."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The first strong signal of this impending consolidation
comes from Fuji Heavy Industries Inc., best known for its
Subaru cars. Fuji recently forecast an operating loss of
nearly 23 billion yen ($145.6 million) for the fiscal year
ended March 31. That's seven times the loss it was predicting
last fall. And earlier this month, the other shoe fell: Fuji
President Toshijiro Tajima said he will yield the reins to a
former high executive of Nissan Motor Co.</p>
<p>Officially, Fuji remains independent. In reality, Nissan,
Fuji's largest holder with a 4.3% stake, will step in to
ensure Fuji's survival and call the shots at its ailing
cousin. It's a Chrysler-type bailout, Japanese-style, without
legislative hearings or public controversy.</p>
<p>As a group, the Japanese auto makers are still clearly
winners. They took an unprecedented 27.7% of U.S. car sales
in the first quarter, and last year auto sales in Japan
itself rose 8% to a record. But Japan's car makers aren't all
alike. Consider what the big ones -- Nissan, Toyota Motor
Corp. and Honda Motor Co. -- are doing to their smaller
Japanese rivals:</p>
<p>-- Fuji's vehicle sales in Japan dropped 5% last year, but
that was the good news. Sales of its Subaru of America
affiliate tumbled 13% and then another 35% in the 1990 first
quarter, just as Fuji was gearing up its first U.S. factory.
Fuji's projected operating loss will be the company's first
since its shares were listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in
1960.</p>
<p>-- Daihatsu Motor Co.'s domestic auto operations sustained
an 18% drop in earnings in the fiscal year ended March 31,
analysts estimate. The culprits: A decline in sales of
minicars, the company's main product, and an embarrassing
recall of the company's first family-sized compact, the
Applause. Daihatsu, already 14%-owned by Toyota, wants Toyota
to raise its stake to 20% and assist in product development.</p>
<p>-- Suzuki Motor Co.'s vehicle sales in Japan dipped a
modest 2% last year, but the company hit a buzzsaw in the
U.S. Consumer Reports Magazine labeled the Samurai, a tiny,
Jeep-like vehicle, unsafe. Suzuki's U.S. sales plunged 48% in
1989 and were down 36% in the 1990 first quarter. Suzuki is
fighting back with new management, new advertising and new
models, but against heavy odds.</p>
<p>All this makes Japan's smaller car companies ripe for the
sort of consolidation sweeping the rest of the auto industry
world-wide. In recent years, some of the world's best-known
automotive marques have surrendered their independence:
Jaguar to Ford Motor Co. and Saab to General Motors Corp.
Last February, Sweden's AB Volvo and France's Renault S.A.
announced a broad alliance that will be cemented by
cross-shareholdings and cooperation on a range of products.</p>
<p>Only the Japanese companies remained unaffected by this
survival-driven urge to merge. Aided by their prosperity
during much of the 1980s, they were becoming more independent
of each other and of their foreign partners.</p>
<p>Even though Nissan, for example, is Fuji's largest
shareholder, Fuji stopped assembling cars for Nissan in 1986
and declared that in the future it wouldn't rely so heavily
on the larger company. Last year, Mitsubishi Motors Corp.
bought back a big chunk of its stock owned by Chrysler Corp.,
reducing the U.S. company's stake to 12% from about 22%. GM
recently trimmed its stake in Isuzu Motors Ltd.</p>
<p>Now, though, the pendulum may be swinging back toward
consolidation. "It's a return to the beginning," says Atsushi
Muramatsu, Nissan's executive vice president for finance.</p>
<p>The effects on consumers in the U.S. and Japan aren't
clear. Consolidation could take years, and well-known brand
names, such as Subaru, aren't likely to disappear. Fewer
independent competitors could lead to higher prices, but
plenty of competition is still left.</p>
<p>The causes of consolidation are easier to pinpoint. The
Japanese yen nearly doubled in dollar value between 1985 and
1989. Japan's auto makers raised prices sharply to
compensate, Detroit got more competitive, and suddenly the
U.S. stopped being a sure-fire growth market for the
Japanese. The yen has slumped about 30% in recent months, but
no longer is selling Japanese cars in the U.S. a cakewalk.</p>
<p>Back in Japan, meanwhile, the government eased the tax
bite on large cars, and their sales surged at the expense of
minicars. Toyota and Nissan racked up sales gains exceeding
15% last year, while sales of minicars -- the core products
at Fuji and Suzuki as well as Daihatsu -- fell 10%.</p>
<p>Minicar sales may rebound this year because the government
now allows them to have bigger engines. Nonetheless, the
future for minicars isn't bright because the newly rich
Japanese want what Americans have wanted for decades: bigger,
plusher automobiles. The minicar specialists have to change.</p>
<p>"Everyone has to expand their product lines, and they just
can't do it by themselves," says Takeo Fujii, a
research-department executive at Industrial Bank of Japan,
Fuji's lender and second-largest shareholder. "One hit, and
you're safe for a while. But one flop, and you're out."</p>
<p>Fuji prospered for years because it found a niche:
four-wheel drive. Most companies confined four-wheel drive to
pickups or utility vehicles, but Fuji put it on cars and
station wagons, and won fans in snowy New England and Rocky
Mountain states. Americans bought 183,000 Subarus in 1986,
twice the level of a decade earlier.</p>
<p>Then things went awry. Sport utility vehicles surged in
popularity in the U.S., attracting Subaru buyers. More
companies started putting four-wheel drive on cars. Fuji was
slow to respond, especially in the U.S., where it is the only
Japanese auto maker to import and market cars through an
independent distributor. (Fuji owns 49.6% of Subaru of
America, but coordination between them can be cumbersome.)</p>
<p>Last year, Fuji counterattacked by launching the Subaru
Legacy, a mainstream family car. "You could call the Legacy a
make-or-break car," says Stephen Usher, an analyst at
Kleinwort Benson International Inc. in Tokyo. "So far, it
isn't really making it." Although the Legacy gets good marks
from car-enthusiast publications, it's aimed squarely at the
Toyota Camry and Honda Accord.</p>
<p>"We sure wish {Legacy} sales had been higher," concedes
Thomas R. Gibson, the president of Subaru of America. "But
actually, they aren't as disappointing as some people think."
The most typical Legacy buyer, he says, is a prior Subaru
owner, but the second and third largest categories are Camry
and Accord owners. Subaru's problems were somewhat
predictable, Mr. Gibson adds, because "we spent 20 years in
subcompact market, and now we're suddenly moving into a
market that's a little more upscale."</p>
<p>Nonetheless, dealers in both the U.S. and Japan are
moaning. In suburban Los Angeles, for example, Culver City
Subaru is selling only about six cars a month, down from 26 a
month four years ago. "There just isn't a keen interest in
Subaru products," complains Philip Miller, the sales manager.
"There's nothing I can do. Unfortunately, I'm handling a
product that isn't doing well."</p>
<p>In Tokyo's Ark Hills financial center, Tadashi Uematsu has
much the same complaint. "I wish more young people would come
in," says Mr. Uematsu, the general manager of the Chuo Subaru
Motor Co. dealership. "Things are pretty tough." His first
hour on the job one morning last week was interrupted by just
one shopper.</p>
<p>Fuji's bankers at Industrial Bank of Japan saw the
problems deepening last summer. So they sent an IBJ
executive, Motomu Toshiya, to become a senior managing
director of Fuji. But five months later, Mr. Toshiya died
unexpectedly. Since then, Fuji has been involved in corporate
power struggles of the sort that are rare in consensus-minded
Japan.</p>
<p>First, Fuji bid $147 million, or $6 a share, to buy the
rest of Subaru of America. Subaru balked at the price and
hasn't budged. So now, Fuji and Subaru officials must keep at
arms' length in the board room while trying to work hand in
hand in the showroom.</p>
<p>Then, with Fuji angling for control of Subaru, officials
of Nissan and IBJ started haggling over control of Fuji
itself. Both Nissan and IBJ, longtime business partners,
wanted to install their own man at Fuji's helm. Much as it
often happens in Detroit, the "car guys" were fighting the
finance people over control.</p>
<p>At Fuji, the car guys won, partly because Mr. Tajima, the
president who presided over Fuji's decline, himself came from
IBJ. He will remain at Fuji as the chairman, but in Japan the
president is the top executive. Fuji's new president will be
Isamu Kawai, a 68-year-old former high executive of Nissan.
As the current president of Nissan Diesel Co., he is
well-regarded for pulling the Nissan truck-making affiliate
out of a slump.</p>
<p>Already, Fuji has followed Nissan by abolishing dress
codes for home-office employees and permitting flexible work
schedules. More substantive moves will follow: Fuji is likely
to use its idle plant capacity in Japan to assemble cars for
Nissan again, and the two companies will cooperate in
developing and marketing cars. Some analysts expect an
eventual full merger.</p>
<p>How will Japan's other producers fare in the expected
consolidation? Toyota will expand its role at Daihatsu,
experts predict. Japan's truck specialists, Hino Motors Ltd.
and Nissan Diesel, will remain closely tied to Toyota and
Nissan, respectively.</p>
<p>Mitsubishi is pulling away from Chrysler but exploring
closer ties with Daimler-Benz AG of Germany. Honda, as
always, will go it alone. Mazda Motor Co. and Isuzu already
have big brothers; Ford owns 25% of Mazda, GM 38% of Isuzu.</p>
<p>The wild card is Suzuki, 5%-owned by GM but the only small
Japanese car maker to remain truly independent. "Suzuki's
position," a Japanese auto executive says, "might become
delicate." A Suzuki spokesman in Japan says that in the
future the company, like other auto makers, may need to put
more emphasis on cooperation. He adds, however, "We think we
have to continue on our own."</p>
<p>In any case, the events at Fuji show that being Japanese
doesn't guarantee any car company immunity from global
competition. "Will all 11 Japanese vehicle manufacturers
remain independent? I don't think so," says Stephen E.
Marvin, a senior auto analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities
Ltd. in Tokyo. "Fuji is the first sign of things to come."</p>
