	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- Coca-Cola Co., hoping to match its huge success
in West Germany, is starting a push into East Germany with
$140 million in capital investments.
   The soft-drink giant said negotiations are under way with
beverage organizations in East Germany to bottle and
distribute Coca-Cola throughout the country. The $140 million
would be used to upgrade machinery, trucks, vending machines
and other sales equipment connected with as many as six
bottling plants.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A Coca-Cola spokesman said negotiations are expected to be
completed before the summer.</p>
<p>East Germany could represent a significant addition to
Coke's highly profitable overseas operations. International
sales today account for 80% of the company's soft-drink
operating profit and 65% of soft-drink revenue. West Germany
alone accounts for about 12% of Coke's earnings, said Emanuel
Goldman, an analyst with PaineWebber Research in San
Francisco.</p>
<p>By contrast, Coke's domestic sales have been lackluster.
While the company's international volume grew by 9% in the
first quarter, retail case sales in the U.S. increased 3%,
with fountain volume rising a slim 1%.</p>
<p>Coke first moved to take advantage of the East German
market last fall when the Berlin Wall began to crumble,
offering free soft drinks to people crossing the border.
Since mid-February, Coke has sold more than two million cases
of soft drinks in East Germany, shipped into the country from
bottling plants in West Germany and France. By comparison,
the company sold about four million cases in Poland in all of
1989.</p>
<p>The fact that Coke is already a known commodity in East
Germany -- its West German television ads have been seen by
East German viewers for 30 years-and the existence of
bottling facilities in the country mean that Coke should be
able to break into the market more easily and more quickly
than it would normally in a foreign country.</p>
<p>"The demand is there, and the awareness is there," said a
Coke spokesman. "But up until now, there's just been an
inability to buy the product."</p>
<p>Added Mr. Goldman at PaineWebber: "The key is
availability. If there's one thing Coca-Cola has shown it can
do, it's making the product available and affordable. If they
can meld the two operations (in East and West Germany),
there's a potential for substantial profits."</p>
<p>The company's move into East Germany comes on the heels of
PepsiCo Inc.'s new trade agreement with the Soviet Union. The
Purchase, N.Y., company plans to spend more than $1 billion
to upgrade and expand bottling plants and to provide
concentrate, among other things. The accord could double
Pepsi's sales in the Soviet Union during the next 10 years.
The company sold about 40 million cases there in 1989. Coke
sold about 20 million cases of all its products, including
Fanta orange drink, in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>While Pepsi claims to have a substantial lead over Coke in
most of Eastern Europe, Pepsi acknowledges that East Germany
is the one country in the bloc where Coke is dominant. A
Pepsi spokesman said yesterday, however, that the company is
"aggressively pursuing" franchise operations in East Germany
and expects to reach agreements with some East German
bottlers in the "next few weeks." The spokesman declined to
elaborate.</p>
