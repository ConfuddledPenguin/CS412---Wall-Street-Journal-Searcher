	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Former network correspondents are
discovering that the exploding world of electronic journalism
holds entrepreneurial opportunities for broadcast-industry
dropouts.
   Veteran correspondents Ike Pappas of CBS and Jack Reynolds
and Peter Hackes of NBC left highly visible, well-paying
network jobs, but are bouncing back with their own small
businesses. And they're prospering, in part, by responding to
the very conditions that are making life miserable for the
three major networks: intense competition from independent
stations and the Fox quasi-network, the proliferation of
cable channels, and the increased use of home videocassette
players.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the mid-1980s, Mr. Pappas, a hustling, cherubic
reporter who specialized in defense issues, found himself
increasingly elbowed aside by younger, more telegenic
reporters. In March 1987, CBS Inc. pulled the plug on Mr.
Pappas's 23-year network career. At age 52 he was laid off,
one of 12 correspondents and 200 other CBS employees given
pink slips in a cost-cutting move. Mr. Pappas departed with a
pocketful of severance pay, wondering if his narrow
professional skills were salable.</p>
<p>For 23 years at CBS, Mr. Pappas says, "the only thing I
thought about was getting on Walter Cronkite and Dan Rather."
Now his thoughts are focused on propelling his own media
enterprise here, a video and film-production company named
Ike Pappas Network Productions Inc. that makes industrials
(corporate-client work) and TV documentaries.</p>
<p>Broadcast veterans such as Mr. Pappas understand the world
of sound bites, says Tom Angell, the president of Interface
Video Systems Inc., a video-production company here. "People
who can tell stories the way Americans are comfortable with
are going to find themselves a place in this industry," he
says.</p>
<p>Mr. Reynolds, who says he spent "32 mostly happy years at
NBC," has found a niche producing video news releases. The
videos are available free, by satellite, to roughly 600 local
TV stations, which use such pieces on their news programs.
Mr. Reynolds last week produced a piece dealing with
confusion over the taxation of pension benefits. He
interviewed an Internal Revenue Service assistant
commissioner, a member of Congress, an irate contractor and a
financial adviser.</p>
<p>The 2 1/2-minute piece, paid for by the American Society
of Pension Actuaries, laid out multiple sides of the issue.
"I was as objective as I could be," Mr. Reynolds says.</p>
<p>His two-year-old company, Jack Reynolds Communications,
also coaches camera-shy people to communicate effectively on
television. (A second Reynolds company is exploring
international teleconferencing, concentrating on Asia and the
European Community.) Mr. Reynolds, 56, also spent two years
as co-host of a bilingual Japanese program that explored
cultural differences between Americans and Japanese.</p>
<p>Peter Hackes worked 31 years as an NBC radio and TV
reporter, but jumped in 1987 when the network suggested early
retirement. His on-air time was slipping and other reporters
were getting the plum assignments. "I realized I was on the B
list," he says.</p>
<p>Now 65, Mr. Hackes juggles a variety of media projects
(and says his earnings in 1989 topped his former NBC salary).
He consults for the American Association of Retired Persons,
which sponsors his 90-second daily radio spot on issues for
the elderly. He has moderated satellite teleconferences on
tax reform and a drug-free workplace.</p>
<p>And with sweet irony, he was cast in the role of a
TV-network news director in the hit movie "Broadcast News."
"I was the heavy," he says of his movie role. "I fired 27
people."</p>
<p>The most visible of the ex-network enterprisers is Mr.
Pappas. The videos produced by his two-year-old company,
which he calls Ike Inc. for short, usually feature Mr. Pappas
himself.</p>
<p>Mr. Pappas, now 55, took the entrepreneurial plunge by
renting a one-room office in the building next door to the
CBS news bureau here. He says, "I turned on the lights and it
was completely bare. I thought, `Well, the rent is running, I
better do something.'" To save money, he bought used
furniture from the defunct public-relations firm of President
Reagan's former confidant, Michael Deaver. "I have Michael
Deaver's stapler on my desk," Mr. Pappas says with a chuckle.</p>
<p>The start-up gave Mr. Pappas, who admits he seldom thought
about the forces behind his weekly CBS paycheck, a lesson in
business humility. "Cash flow has been a great revelation,"
Mr. Pappas says. "What comes in, goes out. I can see how
people fail very easily."</p>
<p>Mr. Pappas's company has made fund-raising videos for the
Greek Orthodox Church, the Leukemia Society of America and a
group trying to build a monument here to slain
law-enforcement officers.</p>
<p>His company turned a profit in its second year, Mr. Pappas
says. The non-network TV and video distributors "all want
programming," he says. "It's a very hungry market out there."</p>
<p>Mr. Pappas also narrated the TV series "Crimewatch
Tonight," a nightly half-hour chronicle of murders and drug
busts around the nation. The syndicated show ran for 26 weeks
in 90 cities, but wasn't renewed by its producer. Mr. Pappas
says it suffered from poor scheduling, including competition
from Mets baseball games in New York.</p>
<p>Mr. Pappas sees his image with television viewers as an
asset, and he isn't bashful about promoting himself in
company projects. "We're attempting to do things to keep me
on the air," he says.</p>
<p>Running a small business is "the most fun I've had in my
life," Mr. Pappas says. But he admits that the switch to
small-business owner hasn't been easy. In his network days,
he stood before the cameras in his trench coat and talked
about such weighty topics as guided missiles and the
strategic arms-limitation talks. "Now I stand in front of a
shopping mall and say, `This is the biggest shopping mall in
the world.' It's a hell of an adjustment."</p>
