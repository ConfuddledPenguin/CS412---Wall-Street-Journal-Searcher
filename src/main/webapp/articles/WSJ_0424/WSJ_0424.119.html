	<p class="article-leader">TOLEDO, Ohio -- Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. said its
board elected Max O. Weber chief executive officer to succeed
William W. Boeschenstein, 64 years old, who will retire in
September. Mr. Boeschenstein will remain a director.
   Mr. Weber, 60, joined Owens-Corning in 1955. He was named
president and chief operating officer in 1988 and will
continue to serve in that capacity after succeeding Mr.
Boeschenstein Oct. 1.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Weber takes over a company that went through a major
recapitalization four years ago. The maker of home insulation
and construction products reported net income of $32 million,
or 76 cents a share, for the first quarter, 5.9% lower than a
year earlier. Last year's net income dropped 9%, which the
company attributed to an economic slowdown in the U.S. that
affected its construction, automotive and pleasure-boat
markets.</p>
