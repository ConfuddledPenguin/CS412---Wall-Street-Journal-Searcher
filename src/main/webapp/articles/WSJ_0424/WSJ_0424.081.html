	<p class="article-leader">After all the buildup, the government's case against
Michael R. Milken is scheduled to end today with a plea
bargain.
   But as the government prepares to drop most of its 98
charges against the former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
junk-bond chief and to scrap a broader new indictment, a
question looms large: Do plea bargains serve the public's
interest in learning the full scope of alleged crimes and
seeing justice done?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The plea bargain in this case will make the extraordinary
Mr. Milken quite ordinary by courtroom standards: More than
90% of all criminal defendants plead guilty to lesser charges
to avoid facing trial.</p>
<p>And regular participants in the justice system seem to
like things that way. For prosecutors, says Benito Romano, a
former U.S. attorney in New York, plea bargaining "is an
effort to spare the expenditure of precious resources --
courtrooms, prosecutors and judges -- and still achieve a
disposition that does justice."</p>
<p>For defendants, pleas eliminate the risks of trials,
narrow the charges and generally result in shorter prison
terms than a judge would mete out after a conviction at
trial. "Plea bargaining is really a way to resolve conflict
in a way where you can contain and better control the
consequences of a conviction," says New York defense lawyer
Stanley Arkin.</p>
<p>Although criminal cases are typically described as "The
People" vs. such-and-such defendant, many prosecutors and
defense lawyers minimize the significance of the public's
interest and say that general curiosity about the details of
an investigation shouldn't bear on whether a plea bargain is
struck.</p>
<p>"The public clearly has an interest in what the facts are
of investigations and the right to know whether prosecutors
are doing their job," says Aaron Marcu, a former prosecutor
in the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office who is now a defense
lawyer. But Mr. Marcu says the public shouldn't have a voice
in deciding whether a particular case ought to end in a plea
bargain because "the public doesn't usually know all the
facts, and it has entrusted these decisions to prosecutors."</p>
<p>Adds Mr. Romano, "The rights of the individual defendant
are more important" than the interest of the public.</p>
<p>That's not a view that sits easily with some critics.
"What is the point of the taxpayers having spent millions of
dollars investigating cases if the material the government
uncovers is then to be swept under the rug?" asks Benjamin J.
Stein, a Los Angeles attorney and economist who is a longtime
critic of the government's handling of insider-trading
issues. "It's in the constitution that trials should be
open." A regular contributor to Dow Jones & Co.'s Barron's,
Mr. Stein's open letter opposing a plea bargain in the Milken
case appeared in the magazine this week.</p>
<p>"If I had my way, I'd have everyone go to trial," says New
York defense lawyer Bruce Cutler, who represents John Gotti
and others whom the government has called alleged mobsters.
"Pleas help the system along, and I'm not in favor of doing
that. I believe the government ought to try its cases, so I'm
in favor of fighting."</p>
<p>Critics argue that plea bargains often create the false
impression that a defendant committed only the crimes to
which he agreed to plead guilty. In fact, plea bargains are
negotiated compromises and defendants usually plead guilty to
fewer crimes than the government believes they committed or
to lesser charges.</p>
<p>Often, the government attempts to combat the impression
that the defendant committed only a few minor offenses by
unveiling details of additional allegations in sentencing
memos that are presented to the judge. The thinking is that
the judge -- and the public -- should be aware that the
government was prepared to bring broader charges against the
defendant if he had refused the plea agreement.</p>
<p>This effort to shape the public perception of a
prosecution spawned a heated dispute in the government's
recent case against Robert Freeman. The former head of
arbitrage at Goldman, Sachs & Co. had been arrested in a
highly publicized incident, amid indications from the
government that he had been involved in a huge
insider-trading scandal. But Mr. Freeman ultimately pleaded
guilty last year to one felony count of using inside
information under circumstances that made his crime appear to
some to be of little significance.</p>
<p>In an effort to dispel that impression and give the judge
an idea of the potentially broader charges that might have
been brought, the government alleged in a sentencing memo
that Mr. Freeman committed some 20 other similar crimes. But
the judge ruled in that case -- at the request of Mr.
Freeman's lawyers -- that he wouldn't consider or release the
additional allegations in sentencing Mr. Freeman. The judge
said he wanted to avoid a lengthy hearing in which each
charge would have to be debated.</p>
<p>Prosecutors in the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan
decline to comment on why they were willing to strike a plea
bargain with Mr. Milken, who was charged last year with 98
counts of racketeering and securities and tax fraud. (His
deal requires him to plead guilty to six felony counts, none
of them involving racketeering or insider trading.)</p>
<p>But prosecutors and defense lawyers not involved in the
case say that while the government won't be able to show a
somewhat skeptical public that it had a broad and
well-documented case against Mr. Milken, the benefits of
accepting his plea outweigh the risks of public criticism.</p>
<p>"Here's a man who's been saying for four years he was
innocent and now he's agreeing to plead to six felony
counts," says Washington, D.C., defense lawyer Harvey Pitt,
who represented stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky in his
insider trading-related plea bargain in 1986.</p>
<p>Mr. Pitt says Mr. Milken's plea "is an admission of guilt
that vindicates the whole prosecutorial effort here." He adds
that the plea sends out a sign to future defendants that the
Manhattan U.S. attorney's office "is an office to be reckoned
with."</p>
<p>Additionally, prosecutors benefit from the Milken plea
bargain by avoiding the expense and inherent risk of going to
trial against a defendant with nearly unlimited resources and
a powerful legal team. A trial could have dragged on for
years, and even if Mr. Milken had been convicted, he probably
would have appealed.</p>
<p>It might have taken the government many years to get the
hundreds of millions of dollars of fines and restitution it
sought. The plea agreement ensures instead that the
government will quickly get the $600 million Mr. Milken
promised to deliver.</p>
<p>On a more personal level, prosecutors who have been
working on the case for nearly four years have made it clear
that they would like to leave their relatively low-paying
public jobs for lucrative partnerships at private law firms.
While such considerations may not have been paramount, they
were no doubt a factor, many current and former prosecutors
agree.</p>
<p>Few plea bargains in cases of this magnitude get made,
however, unless the defendant agrees to cooperate with the
government in taking its investigation further. Often, the
government will use plea bargains to turn defendants into
witnesses in cases it is trying to build against more
prominent targets.</p>
<p>The Milken plea bargain, too, requires him to cooperate.
But for several years it has appeared that Mr. Milken was the
government's prime target in its insider-trading
investigation. So the question will be raised whether the big
case -- the one against the master of the junk-bond market --
should have gone to trial.</p>
<p>Indeed, Mr. Milken himself had always made clear that he
wanted the government to have to prove its charges publicly
in a trial by jury. But even he succumbed to the lure of a
compromise.</p>
<p>By pleading guilty, Mr. Milken avoids a drawn-out legal
battle and the risk of a conviction on racketeering charges,
which carry maximum prison terms of up to 20 years. He also
gets to serve his time immediately and get on with his life
more quickly than if he first had to face a trial and an
appeal.</p>
<p>Moreover, by accepting a deal, Mr. Milken avoids the
further barrage of media attention that a trial would surely
bring. And his plea bargain makes it less likely that the
public will ever know precisely what he did wrong -- and why
he became the target of the largest securities fraud
investigation ever.</p>
