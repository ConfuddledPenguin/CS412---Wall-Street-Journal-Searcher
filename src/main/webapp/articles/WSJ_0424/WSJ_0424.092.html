	<p class="article-leader">BAYBANKS Inc., which earlier said it would consider the
declaration of its quarterly dividend at the company's annual
meeting on Thursday, declared a quarterly dividend of 45
cents a share, payable June 1 to stock of record May 14. The
Boston bank holding company said its decision "was reached
after careful analysis and is based on our current
expectations for the future. Decisions on future dividends
will be made based on the circumstances prevailing at the
time." A spokesman said the company said it is still
expecting a final report from a regulatory examination "in
due course." He said the on-site review of the company was
concluded in March. Federal and state bank examiners have
been studying the company's loan portfolio.</p>
