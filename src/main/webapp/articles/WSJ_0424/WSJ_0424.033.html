	<p class="article-leader">Investors hunting for bargains are helping to boost prices
of some limited partnerships in the informal resale, or
"secondary" market.
   While prices of partnerships sponsored by troubled
syndicators continued to fall during the first quarter,
investors selling interests in some other partnerships got
prices that were a bit higher than in the last three months
of 1989.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>These are some of the findings of the latest Wall Street
Journal survey of trading at a number of small investment
firms that buy partnership interests from investors, either
for their own accounts or for resale to new investors. The
survey covers resale-market trading in 20 widely held
partnerships.</p>
<p>The survey found that the best prices investors got when
selling real estate partnership units in 1990's first quarter
averaged about 35% below their original prices. The average
discount was about 41% in the previous quarter.
Secondary-market firms reported that investors in 10 of the
11 real estate partnerships in the survey sold partnership
units during the quarter; sales were reported in all 11 in
the last three months of 1989.</p>
<p>All together, sales by investors were reported for 17 of
the 20 partnerships in the survey, compared with 15 in the
previous quarter. The best prices sellers got averaged 34%
below the original offering prices, about the same as in the
previous quarter.</p>
<p>The partnerships in the survey are a small sample of the
nearly $90 billion of such investments sold publicly by major
Wall Street brokerage firms and other syndicators since the
late 1970s. About half invested in real estate or mortgages,
while the rest undertook everything from leasing jetliners
and computers to buying oil wells and cable-television
systems.</p>
<p>Designed as long-term investments, partnerships typically
have lives of about 10 years before their assets are sold and
investors are paid off. But at least 20% of older
partnerships are foundering, according to brokerage-industry
estimates. The informal resale market is about the only
outlet for investors who want to get out before a partnership
runs its normal course.</p>
<p>Disappointment over performance isn't the only reason some
investors sell. Some investors who got out in the first
quarter, just prior to the annual tax-filing deadline, did so
to make this the last year they had to face the chore of
reporting on their partnership investments to the Internal
Revenue Service, secondary-market brokers say.</p>
<p>Every year, they must decipher a sponsor-supplied
"Schedule K-1 Partners' Share of Income, Credits, Deductions,
Etc." for their partnership. Deciding where and how to report
that information on their tax returns is often a
time-consuming process. Hiring a professional to do it can
easily add $400 a partnership to an investor's
tax-preparation expenses.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the Treasury Department and the IRS
asked Congress to simplify the chore by replacing the complex
K-1 with a streamlined Form 1099-K, similar to the form banks
and others use to report investors' dividends and interest.
The Investment Partnership Association, a Washington, D.C.,
trade group, helped develop the proposed form, which could be
used by partnerships with more than 100 partners.</p>
<p>The secondary market also presents opportunities for
investors to get into many partnerships for substantially
less than the original offering price. Buying in the resale
market can be treacherous, however, especially for investors
looking for high current income.</p>
<p>While many partnerships make periodic cash distributions
to investors, those payments typically aren't guaranteed.
Thus, yield estimates, which like those in the Journal survey
usually compare recent distributions and current resale
prices, can be illusory. There isn't any certainty that those
payouts will continue at the same rate. They could even stop
altogether.</p>
<p>Sponsors of two partnerships in the Journal survey are
among several troubled syndicators considering possible
"roll-ups." In a roll-up, several limited partnerships are
combined into a new, publicly traded investment. The survey
partnerships that would be affected are Equitec Real Estate
Investors Fund XV and Prudential-Bache Energy Income Series
III 14.</p>
