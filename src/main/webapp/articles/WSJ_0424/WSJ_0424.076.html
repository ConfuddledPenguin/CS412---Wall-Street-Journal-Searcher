	<p class="article-leader">The weekend release of hostage Robert Polhill may signal
that the Western allies can begin discussing in public again
their long-term strategic no longer of much benefit to the
Syrians and Iranians, and may in fact be a liability. With
diminishing Soviet support, and with the pullback of the East
Germans and the Romanians, Syria is now more vulnerable than
it was.
   Within the context of a post-Khomeini Iran, moderates do
exist. The Ayatollah took hostages in part to empty the Arab
world of Westerners. He was uninterested in economics, or in
economic benefits that come with Western activity. But his
successor, President Hashemi Rafsanjani, knows that domestic
turmoil is probable if he can't reverse Iran's economic
slide.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>With inflation about 60% and a 25% unemployment level,
Iran is engaged in a process of economic reform. Mr.
Rafsanjani has imposed domestic austerity, trying to restore
monetary discipline that was lost during the Iran-Iraq war.
Last October, Mr. Rafsanjani announced that Iran would
encourage foreign trade, and would embark on at least a
limited privatization campaign. Efforts to sell state-owned
mines have faltered, mostly because buyers can't be sure of
reliable electricity supplies. But private Iranian firms now
have permission to strike deals with Western counterparts.</p>
<p>Iran's interest is foreign exchange, without which a
nation today simply disintegrates. Mr. Rafsanjani has said
that the country will likely borrow $27 billion as part of an
effort to boost non-oil sectors. The success of that effort
depends on Western predilections. Western nations need not
betray the bedrock no-deal-with-terrorists policy to advance
whatever inclinations exist inside Iran to establish a modus
vivendi with the West. If Iran's moderation is genuine, the
hostages will be released, though it could take time.</p>
<p>Any progress with Iran also might have a bracing effect on
Iraq, which has emerged as one of the world's more dangerous
nations. This is a country willing to use poison gas on its
opponents, and as reports in recent days indicate, Iraq has
been trying to develop a "super gun" capable of throwing
chemical or nuclear warheads at its neighbors.</p>
<p>These seem to be days when decades of steadfastness are
paying off. Western anti-communism has paid dividends in
Eastern Europe, but also in the Middle East, where the
collapse of bankrolling Communist governments may force the
Syrians to moderate. A steadfast unwillingness to do business
with terrorists means that nations that practice hostage
taking will have to change if they expect Western economic
cooperation.</p>
<p>As always, politics are treacherous in the Middle East,
and progress may be quickly reversed. But Mr. Polhill's
release is reason to hope that the politics of Iran may yet
be headed in the right direction.</p>
