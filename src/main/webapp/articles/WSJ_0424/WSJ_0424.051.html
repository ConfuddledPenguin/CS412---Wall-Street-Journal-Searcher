	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Eurotunnel PLC once again raised the cost
estimates for the cross-channel link and unveiled the
outlines of a new financing plan.
   But in raising the estimated cost of the project to as
much as #7.6 billion ($12.46 billion), Eurotunnel's chief
executive officer, Alastair Morton, promised that the bad
news should be coming to an end. "We don't intend to go
through this process again," he said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Investors will likely remain skeptical, because of the
tunnel's history of revised cost estimates and funding
arrangements. In 1987, managers of the Anglo-French project
set the total cost at about #4.9 billion. More recently,
Transmanche-Link, or TML, a consortium of 10 contractors,
came in with hefty cost overruns that pushed the estimated
cost to #7.2 billion.</p>
<p>The current plan for shoring up the financing involves an
equity rights offering of as much as #500 million. Before
that, however, Eurotunnel will have to arrange new loans of
as much as #2 billion with a consortium of 208 banks.</p>
<p>Eurotunnel officials said that under the new plan, funds
available for the project, including lines of credit, should
amount to #8 billion to #8.5 billion. Mr. Morton stressed
that this funding should provide an adequate cushion against
future cost overruns.</p>
<p>Analysts said they believe the project is firming up its
finances, but they also think uncertainties will plague the
tunnel, and its shareholders, through the summer. "What are
the banks going to demand in the talks in June?" asked one
analyst in the City. "It's not a done deal."</p>
<p>Another uncertainty, noted William Beazington, an analyst
with Shearson Lehman Hutton Securities in London, is whether
the Thatcher government will resolve questions over the rail
links between London and Folkestone, the English terminus for
the channel tunnel. "Unfortunately, it's seen as a blot on
the landscape," he said. These concerns have created snarls
in deciding on how the connecting rail lines would be routed.</p>
<p>The success of the bank agreement, along with the Thatcher
government's plans for the connecting rail links, will have a
major impact on the success of the equity rights offering.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, actual construction of the tunnel is apparently
proceeding more smoothly than the financing. The tunnel is
half completed, having started the year only one-third
complete.</p>
