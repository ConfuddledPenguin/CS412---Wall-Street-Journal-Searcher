	<p class="article-leader">The intellectual foundation of socialism disintegrated
years ago; the system's political base collapsed last year.
But until now collectivism has retained an important pillar
of support: theology.
   Although Christian socialism is not new, during the 1970s
and 1980s influential groups within established churches
increasingly turned toward collectivism. A vigorous left wing
arose even among evangelicals. In an attempt to bring greater
coherence to the evangelical community's widely divergent
views on economics, a meeting was held in Oxford, Britain, in
January, attended by more than 100 theologians, economists
and others.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The initial odds of achieving the meeting's goal of
drafting a sensible consensus declaration didn't look good.</p>
<p>When such a conference was first held in Oxford, in 1987,
most conferees, though not doctrinaire socialists, were
highly skeptical of the market for the most part. For
instance, one paper at that meeting discussed "an impressive
list" of central planning's benefits. In attendance in 1990
was Andrew Kirk, a leading British theologian and author of a
book contending that "Marxism has exalted collective freedom
-- the freedom of everyone to enjoy a basically dignified
life." The preliminary conference documents, while
recognizing the importance of market forces, also included
many collectivist nostrums.</p>
<p>Yet just as the world has been changing, so has
evangelicals' economic thinking. Avowed free-market
supporters were in a minority, but their ideas framed the
discussion. And support for less intrusive government came
not only from Americans, but also from "two-thirds world"
participants, in conference parlance.</p>
<p>In this atmosphere the conferees developed their
statement, "The Oxford Declaration on Christian Faith and
Economics," for public release. If it would not totally
satisfy an economist from the Chicago or Austrian school, it
describes a less regulated nation than the U.S.</p>
<p>On poverty and justice, the attendees achieved a
surprising degree of agreement. "The causes of poverty are
many and complex," stated the declaration, including "the
cultural attitudes and actions taken by social, economic,
political and religious institutions" that "erect barriers to
economic production."</p>
<p>The conferees denounced protectionism, inflationary
policies, and "economic systems based on policies, laws and
regulations whose effect is to favor privileged minorities
and to exclude the poor from fully legitimate activities."
Indeed, in a line that could have come from the Libertarian
Party platform, the document went on to declare that "such
systems are not only inefficient, but are immoral as well."</p>
<p>What did the conferees believe the proper role of
government to be? Bigger than would be accepted by Milton
Friedman, but smaller than that envisioned by the liberation
theologians or perhaps even some Bush administration
officials.</p>
<p>The conferees emphasized that "a dispersion of the means
of production is a significant component of democracy" and
that "widespread ownership" of property "tends to
decentralize power and prevent totalitarianism." Avoiding the
penchant of many people to blame markets for problems caused
by government intervention, the declaration warned not only
of the danger of concentrated economic power in centrally
planned systems, but also that "heavy state involvement and
regulation within market economies can also result in
concentrations of power that effectively marginalize poorer
members of society."</p>
<p>The document did endorse "sustenance rights," but went on
to acknowledge that "such rights must be carefully defined so
that government's involvement will not encourage
irresponsible behavior and the breakdown of families and
communities" and that the state's role should be one "of last
resort." The conferees extolled the role of mediating
institutions and warned that "government must also have
regard for economic efficiency and appropriately limit its
own scope and action."</p>
<p>Although not perfect, the Oxford document is far better
than anything that would have come from most any other recent
international religious gathering. From what stems this
shift? Reality obviously played a major role. One conference
leader noted that history appeared to have rendered its
judgment on socialism. Another factor was the growing
recognition within the Third World of the problems of state
intervention. Latin American delegates, for instance, paid
special attention to Hernando de Soto's path-breaking work in
Peru. Perhaps most important was the fact that even those who
leaned to the left were open to argument and willing to
change their minds.</p>
<p>If left-leaning evangelicals can come to believe in the
superiority of an open economy, so too can Catholic
liberation theologians and Protestant adherents to the social
gospel. After that, socialism would truly be dead.</p>
