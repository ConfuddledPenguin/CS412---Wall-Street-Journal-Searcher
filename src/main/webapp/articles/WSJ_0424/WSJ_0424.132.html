	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Sir James Goldsmith threw in the towel in his
quest for B.A.T Industries PLC, in what would have been the
second-largest takeover in history.
   Sir James's Hoylake Investments Ltd. said it wouldn't
renew its bid for the London-based tobacco, financial
services, retailing and paper company. Hoylake's original #13
billion ($21.31 billion) bid, launched last July, lapsed last
September under British takeover law. Hoylake gave no reason
for its decision.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But it is clear that the Anglo-French Sir James, one of
the most flamboyant corporate raiders of the past decade,
again has fallen victim to a shift in official and public
attitudes toward hostile bids, particularly highly leveraged
proposals. And, as part of the change, individual U.S. states
are increasingly flexing their muscles as anti-takeover
champions.</p>
<p>Many in the international investment community said the
fatal blow against Hoylake was struck in California on April
10 when the state insurance commissioner barred a change in
control of B.A.T's Farmers Group Inc. insurance unit. Hoylake
would have sold Farmers to a French insurance concern,
Axa-Midi Assurances, for $4.5 billion if it had won control
of B.A.T. But California insurance commissioner Roxani
Gillespie said that the leverage of the deal would have
endangered Farmers.</p>
<p>Taking stock of the changing mood toward hostile
takeovers, Ron Freeman, head of international investment
banking at Salomon Brothers Inc., said: "In the 1980s, all
mergers and acquisitions were good. Now, in some people's
minds, no M&A is good. Neither position is correct."</p>
<p>Mr. Freeman, whose firm wasn't involved in the bitter
10-month Hoylake-B.A.T fight, added: "The federal court
system in the U.S. went too far in one direction, when it
said that the only relevant constituency was the
shareholders. But now states are becoming much more dominant,
and are moving in the other direction," toward protecting
corporate boards and employees.</p>
<p>Moreover, for foreign companies, a hurdle encountered more
often is the flag-waving sometimes associated with such a
takeover attempt. For example, in the $1.64 billion hostile
bid by London-based BTR PLC for Worcester, Mass.-based Norton
Co., the Union Jack was burned on the steps of Worcester's
city hall last month by Norton workers fearing they would
lose their jobs if the takeover goes through.</p>
<p>Ironically, it was to escape this wave that Sir James
cashed in his U.S. chips in 1987 and moved back across the
Atlantic to concentrate on European targets. He had been
doused by the first groundswell in 1986 when he abandoned a
bid for Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. after workers of the
Akron, Ohio, company demonstrated on the U.S. Capitol steps
against foreign takeovers.</p>
<p>But the Atlantic has proven no shield for Sir James.
Axa-Midi said it would withdraw its change-of-control
applications in all nine states where Farmers operates. "We
are naturally disappointed," said Claude Bebear, Axa
chairman, who added that the French company remains
"steadfastly committed to gaining a position in the U.S.
insurance market."</p>
<p>Sir James couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>However, in a conversation last September, he said that
his strategy had gone awry early. The strategy was to launch
an all-paper bid, thereby initially avoiding finance fees;
get regulatory clearance in the U.S.; and then inject cash
into the bid.</p>
<p>But he said he was surprised at the resistance of state
insurance regulators. Sir James believed that the insurance
commissioners would be glad to see Farmers divested from a
tobacco company, and thought that B.A.T would be persona non
grata because of the long fight it had with regulators when
it took over Farmers in 1988.</p>
<p>Sir James conceded that a loss would damage his prestige.
"If I lose," he said, "obviously it's because I made a
mistake. If you get caught between two cars, it's your
fault."</p>
<p>At 850 pence a share, the Hoylake bid would have made a
B.A.T takeover second in size only to the $25 billion
acquisition of RJR Nabisco Inc. by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &
Co. in 1988. Made last July 11 when B.A.T shares were at 694
pence, the bid caused the stock to soar as high as 936 pence
last year.</p>
<p>But lately the stock has been receding as Hoylake's hopes
grew dimmer. B.A.T shares closed in London yesterday at 724
pence, down 4 pence. The Hoylake announcement was made after
the market closed.</p>
<p>With 1% of B.A.T, Hoylake has made enough to more than
offset about #30 million in legal and other costs. But its
paper profit apparently won't approach the $93 million Sir
James made when he sold his Goodyear shares back to the
company in 1986.</p>
<p>The Hoylake bid galvanized B.A.T into making major changes
that the company said it was planning anyway. Reducing itself
to a tobacco/financial-services company, B.A.T among other
things last Friday sold Marshall Field's, the major Chicago
retailer, to Dayton Hudson Corp. for $1.04 billion, and soon
will sell its Saks Fifth Avenue retail chain.</p>
<p>In typical Sir James style, Hoylake's brief statement
concluded: "The directors of Hoylake wish B.A.T and its
unbundled offspring great success within their new
structures."</p>
<p>But the changes, a B.A.T spokesman claimed, were "the
turning point" in the company's battle against Hoylake.</p>
<p>"I am pleased that Hoylake and Axa-Midi have finally
abandoned their bid," Patrick Sheehy, B.A.T chairman, said
yesterday. "We can now devote our full attention to running
the continuing group based on our financial-services and
tobacco businesses."</p>
