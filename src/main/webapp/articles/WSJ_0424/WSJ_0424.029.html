	<p class="article-leader">ASHLAND, Ky. -- Addington Resources Inc. said it expects
first-quarter profit from continuing operations to be between
15 cents and 20 cents a share, which it said is below
analysts' expectations. In the year-ago period, per-share net
was 15 cents.
   Addington, a coal mining, water transportation and
construction company, attributed the disappointing
first-quarter results to difficult mining conditions in West
Virginia and Eastern Kentucky, higher fuel costs and
unusually heavy rain in Western Kentucky.</p>
