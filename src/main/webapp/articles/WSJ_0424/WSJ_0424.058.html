	<p class="article-leader">As an April 30 deadline looms, the tom-toms of trade war
are once again beating at George Bush to take a "Super 301"
swipe at Japan, and maybe South Korea too. It's time to
repeat that the conventional wisdom on trade deficits has it
all exactly backward.
   The U.S. does not have a trade deficit with Japan because
this country consumes too much and must therefore borrow to
pay the bill. The trade deficit exists because Japan has to
find somewhere to invest its huge pool of savings. The United
States, which happens to be a very good place to invest, then
buys Toyotas to recycle those savings back to Japan through
the trade account. In other words, the trade deficit is a
sign of American economic vigor, not weakness.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>We know this may sound startling, because the conventional
wisdom has deemed that somehow there is a perfect trade
"balance," presumably at or close to zero. This logic ignores
the central truth of foreign trade flows: There can't be a
trade deficit without offsetting capital inflows. The trade
deficit or surplus is merely an accounting identity.</p>
<p>To refresh some memories on this point, it's worth
reprinting the 1976 conclusions of the U.S. Advisory
Committee on the Presentation of Balance of Payments
Statistics. This was not a group of economic yahoos, but
included Morgan Guaranty's Rimmer de Vries, Brookings's
Walter Salant and Charles Schwartz of the International
Monetary Fund. The committee said:</p>
<p>"The words `surplus' and `deficit' should be avoided
insofar as possible. . . . These words are frequently taken
to mean that the developments are `good' or `bad'
respectively. Since that interpretation is often incorrect,
the terms may be widely misunderstood and used in lieu of
analysis."</p>
<p>So long as foreign investment here is voluntary and
private, a trade deficit is a motor of growth and prosperity.
If it's a trade surplus we want, there's one quick way to get
it: recession. To put it another way, in today's global
economy, investment or capital flows drive trade flows,
rather than vice versa. A mere two weeks of capital flows add
up to more than a year's worth of trade flows. Trade is the
result not the cause.</p>
<p>With that in mind, it's hard to understand why the U.S. as
the world's leading economic power should pick trade fights
with Japan or anyone else. With Japan's trade surplus, its
high (and for years subsidized) savings rate and anemic
consumption, where else but the U.S. can Japan's money go? If
Japan's dollars weren't somehow recycled, we'd all be in a
fix that would take the "trade deficit" right out of the
economic news.</p>
<p>So what's driving U.S. trade policy? Clear as day:
politics, especially lobbying by U.S. producer interests. The
201 and Super 301 trade-retaliation sections of the 1988
trade bill are engraved invitations for special corporate
pleading. Indeed, they were expressly designed by Congress to
make Congress and the interests it represents bigger players
in trade policy.</p>
<p>One year into the law, industry has already formed a
protectionist queue at the 301 table. Last year it was wood
products, satellites and supercomputers. This year, the
foremost agitators are auto parts and computer chips. The
Semiconductor Industry Association, in effect a lobby for
only two companies, has sent a letter urging a 301 case to
virtually the entire Bush Cabinet.</p>
<p>We have no problem with diplomacy to open markets or
remove Japan's ridiculous trade barriers. Japanese consumers
are themselves agitating for lower prices and better goods,
and the American voice is a useful echo. But in modern trade
politics, no Tokyo concession ever seems to be enough.
Despite recent Japanese concessions in satellites and
computers, Senators John Danforth (R., Mo.) and Max Baucus
(D., Mont.) want George Bush to hit 'em again. Presumably,
the Senators' logic is that one good turn deserves only
another rebuke.</p>
<p>It may be, of course, that America's trade warriors really
don't understand what they're asking Japan to do. The reforms
they're seeking would actually make Japan's economy more
efficient, and more competitive too. If Japan changes its
retail-store law to allow American-style supermarkets, for
example, Japanese will pay less of their income for food.
Their savings will then increase, creating an even larger
capital outflow and thus a larger U.S. trade deficit.</p>
<p>This is fine with those of us who think the trade deficit
is really nothing to worry about. In fact, if our trade
warriors are now admitting they agree, we're happy to welcome
them aboard.</p>
