	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- General Motors Class E shares, which give
investors a secondhand interest in GM's huge Electronic Data
Systems subsidiary, have been roughed up a bit in the past
week and a half.
   Just 12 days ago, the Class E shares hit a record high of
31 1/4. They since have dropped 8%, closing yesterday at 28
3/4, down 1/4. Besides general stock-market weakness, the
decline reflects new uncertainty about a big Texas Air
contract that investors had previously thought was in the
bag.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But money managers who like EDS's long-term prospects say
the dip may be a buying opportunity. They point out that EDS
is the largest company in the fast-growing business of
running other companies' computer operations.</p>
<p>"There's a tremendous move on the part of corporations in
the past year and a half to outsource their MIS {management
information systems} departments," says James Craig,
portfolio manager of Janus Fund. "You turn over a nightmare
to somebody who does it for you. It's such a huge fixed
capital investment, and these guys can do it so well."</p>
<p>The outsourcing ball really got rolling when Eastman Kodak
decided to do it, says Stephen T. McClellan, analyst with
Merrill Lynch. "There used to be a real stigma to farming out
your data processing," he says. "Since Eastman Kodak did it
last fall, there's no longer a stigma. It's a snowball
rolling downhill."</p>
<p>Accordingly, Mr. McClellan rates EDS a strong buy, both
for the short term and long term. He expects EDS to earn
$2.07 a share this year, up from $1.81 last year. For 1991 he
predicts earnings of $2.37 a share.</p>
<p>EDS is also popular with other Wall Street analysts. Of 13
who have a formal opinion, 11 rate it a buy, according to
Zacks Investment Research, Chicago. That's a mixed blessing
since stocks rated as buys by the largest number of analysts
tend to underperform the market, some research shows.</p>
<p>EDS, however, looks as if it's going from strength to
strength. The percentage of its revenue derived from work for
General Motors should fall below 50% this year for the first
time since GM acquired EDS in 1984. EDS is the biggest factor
in the corporate data processing market, ahead of such
competitors as International Business Machines and the
consulting arm of the accounting firm Arthur Andersen.</p>
<p>It has signed big long-term contracts -- ranging from $232
million to $600 million -- with such customers as Enron,
First City Bancorp. of Texas, Great Western Bank and
Freeport-McMoRan. The Texas Air contract, however, would
dwarf those. As envisioned in an EDS announcement in
February, EDS would run the computers for Texas Air's System
One reservation system. The contract would run 10 years and
bring in $4 billion.</p>
<p>Investors are worried about whether the woes of Texas Air
subsidiary Eastern Airlines -- it's in bankruptcy-court
proceedings and a trustee has been appointed to run it --
will derail that fat contract or at least force a reduction
in its amount.</p>
<p>Yesterday an EDS spokesman said that the negotiations with
Texas Air are still on track and that "nothing's really
changed in light of recent revelations about Eastern."</p>
<p>Asked whether the $4 billion figure might have to be
modified, the spokesman declined to comment specifically.
"That gets into the realm of speculation," he said. The draft
contract "doesn't lend itself to easy breakouts."</p>
<p>Eastern has "real problems. That's caused {EDS} stock to
get hit," says Mr. Craig of Janus Fund. "But that's just one
of multitudes of opportunities for them." Mr. Craig has
bought 730,000 shares of the stock since the beginning of
December.</p>
<p>Two drawbacks of the Class E shares are that they aren't
cheap (selling for about 15 times the past 12 months'
earnings) and that they aren't a true common stock. General
Motors owns EDS. What Class E shareholders get is an
earmarked flow of dividends, based on a specified percentage
(currently 30%) of EDS's profits. The dividend yield is 2%.</p>
<p>After 1994, General Motors has the right to exchange its
regular common shares for the special Class E shares. But to
do so, it must pay 20% above the average market price for the
previous 15 trading days.</p>
<p>Still, several big money managers are betting that the
shares' virtues outweigh the drawbacks. Large money managers
added 1.3 million shares to their holdings in the fourth
quarter, according to CDA Investment Technologies. Among the
buyers were RCM Capital Management (which has a crackerjack
stock-picking record but won't comment on individual stocks
it buys), Sit Investment Associates and Waddell & Reed.</p>
<p>Eugene Sit, president of Sit Investment Associates, says
his holding now is over a million shares. He expects EDS
earnings to grow 15% a year, beating out most other companies
in a "slow-growth environment." As a result, he predicts the
shares will provide an investment return of 15% to 20% a
year, "not a home run, but a two-base hit."</p>
