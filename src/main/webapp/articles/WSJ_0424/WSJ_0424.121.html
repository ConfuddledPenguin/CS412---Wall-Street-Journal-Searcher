	<p class="article-leader">Digital Equipment Corp., continuing its stock buy-back
program, said its board authorized the purchase of as many as
five million, or 4.1%, of its common shares on the open
market.
   Digital's stock, which rose last week after it reported
mildly positive third-quarter results, closed yesterday at
$83.25, up 25 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Maynard, Mass., computer maker has purchased 18
million shares of its common for $2.1 billion over the past
several years. In announcing the latest buy-back
authorization, Digital asserted that the current market price
of its stock "does not reflect the underlying strengths of
the company."</p>
<p>Marc Schulman, an analyst with UBS Securities Inc., said
Digital's buy-back announcement didn't affect its stock much
partly because investors didn't interpret it as "a signal
that Digital's business is starting to get stronger." He
added that the indicated $415 million share repurchase "isn't
a very large buy-back, given that Digital has $2.2 billion of
cash."</p>
