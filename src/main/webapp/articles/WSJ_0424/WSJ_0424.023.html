	<p class="article-leader">In regard to David Asman's interview with Mexican
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, on your April 4
editorial page: The Mexico-United States Institute is happy
that Mr. Salinas now seems to favor a closer trade
relationship with the U.S., and perhaps even a North American
Common Market. We have advocated both all along.
   Of course, Mr. Salinas is right when he complains that he
has opened Mexico's economy wide to foreign products, and
that the U.S. and other foreign countries have not
reciprocated. But when he claims that the opening "has meant
lower prices for Mexicans" and has reduced inflation, he is
on uncertain ground.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>If Mexicans are paying less for some items, and inflation
is under 20% -- still a lot higher than the U.S. rate -- that
is because of the economic pact he and his predecessor have
imposed on labor and management that freezes wages and
manufacturing prices. Only when prices are permitted to find
their own level in the marketplace will we learn how low, or
high, they really are, and consequently the true rate of
inflation. But after more than two years, there is no sign
that the Mexican government is ready to trust the open market
-- a different animal from Mr. Salinas's "open economy."</p>
<p>Further, he boasts that he has "forced domestic producers"
to cut their prices to international levels but does not
mention that move has, in turn, forced them to cut back on
production, as their profit margins have correspondingly
fallen. In the end the fall guy is the worker, whose services
no shrunken enterprise needs or can afford.</p>
<p>Though one can only praise Mr. Salinas's advocacy of
privatization, publicity has outstripped performance. The
privatizations he has effectuated still leave intact the
state-owned "strategic" enterprise -- soil, petrochemicals,
banking, electric power, satellite communications, railroads,
and so on -- that represent an estimated 75% to 80% of the
state's assets in the economy and constitute the industrial
infrastructure. Until most of them, at least, are privatized,
Mexico's economy will not be free.</p>
<p>We wonder why Mr. Asman's interview was confined to
economic affairs. After all, without political freedom and
democracy, economic freedom will be found wanting. As the
democratic revolutions in Eastern Europe and Nicaragua
dramatically underscore, unless a government is accountable
to the people it will commit excesses that inevitably drive
national economies into the ground. Mr. Salinas's
predecessors did just that in Mexico.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as the heir to the world's second-oldest
one-party state, after the Soviet Union, Mr. Salinas also is
not accountable; hence he takes only half-measures in trying
to modernize Mexico. There is still time, but not much, for
him to do what the Poles and Hungarians are doing, and
presumably the new Nicaraguan government will do: Go all-out
for a free economy and free political system.</p>
