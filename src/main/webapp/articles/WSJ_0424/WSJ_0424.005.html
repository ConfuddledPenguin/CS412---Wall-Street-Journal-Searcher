	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The International Monetary Fund approved a
$111 million loan to Trinidad and Tobago to support its

   The IMF said an additional $55 million loan may be
available later to meet unexpected developments, such as a
decline in the county's oil-export earnings or higher
