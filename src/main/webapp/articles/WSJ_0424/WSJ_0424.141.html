	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo stocks finished lower in lackluster trading Monday
as the Nikkei index fluctuated in a fairly narrow range,
pushed lower in the afternoon by some profit-taking on
domestic-demand-related issues, traders said.
   London stocks were notably lower and at Frankfurt share
prices plunged 2.5% in moderate but nervous trading in the
market's steepest one-day drop since a 2.9% decline January.
The Frankfurt market declined on worries about growing
militancy on the part of the country's largest union, IG
Metall, and concerns about a new proposal by the West German
government to convert more East German marks into Deutsche
marks at a one-to-one exchange rate. Traders also cited a
fall in bond market prices and prospects for higher interest
rates in West Germany and abroad as contributing factors to
the market's steep descent.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Most other major world markets also finished with losses.</p>
<p>At Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 selected issues
retreated 156.37 points to close at 29679.07. The index lost
109.97 points Friday.</p>
<p>In Tokyo Tuesday, the Nikkei index was down 333.66 points
to 29345.41 at the end of the morning session.</p>
<p>Monday's volume on the First Section was estimated at only
330 million shares, down sharply from 687 million Friday.</p>
<p>Losing issues outnumbered winners, 583 to 357, while 169
remained unchanged.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index (Topix) of all issues listed
in the First Section, which rose 0.67 point Friday, lost
12.96 points, or 0.59%, to 2201.20.</p>
<p>The Second Section index, which added 10.77 points Friday,
lost 12.35 points, or 0.35%, to close at 3549.85.</p>
<p>Volume in the Second Section was estimated at 15 million
shares, up from 10 million Friday.</p>
<p>Observers said there's strong resistance for the Tokyo
Stock Price Index at around 2250 points, at which level heavy
broad-based selling can be expected.</p>
<p>But "the resistance in the short term is less severe on
the Nikkei," whose near-term ceiling is seen at 30000 points,
because arbitrage activity is likely to bid blue-chip issues
higher and keep the index afloat, one trader at a foreign
securities firm said.</p>
<p>Traders said that there was little incentive to buy or to
sell Monday, despite the relative stability of macroeconomic
factors such as the yen and bond prices. The market's
lackluster and somewhat wary sentiment was reflected in the
day's scant activity.</p>
<p>"I was expecting more volume today," said Yusuke Fujiwara,
head of trading at Baring Securities Ltd. Although the
dollar-yen rate "wasn't moving much, I guess people are kind
of cautious," he said.</p>
<p>But some investors were taking the opportunity to take
profits whenever there were small price gains in selected
sectors, traders said. Because the market will be closed
Monday, Thursday and Friday next week for Golden Week,
investors are likely to want to close long positions ahead of
this weekend, they said.</p>
<p>Moreover, "futures slid down consistently most of the day,
indicating that the market is probably in a profit-taking
mode for the time being" rather than being manipulated by
index-related trading, said one trader at Nomura Securities
Co.</p>
<p>Activity should remain limited to such small-lot
profit-taking in the short term, traders said.</p>
<p>"No one's going to do any real aggressive buying" ahead of
Golden Week, the trader at Nomura added.</p>
<p>Large, domestic-demand-related stocks, such as steel,
electric power and trading companies, were softer on
profit-taking Monday.</p>
<p>Traders said that the "Big Four" Japanese securities firms
were supporting high-tech electricals from falling too low
Monday. Hitachi slipped 20 yen (13 cents) to 1,560 yen
($9.91), Kyocera lost 50 to 7,220, Pioneer was down 80 to
5,970, Sony fell 30 to 8,230 and TDK fell 90 to 6,810.</p>
<p>Kawasaki Steel slipped 2 to 600, Kobe Steel fell 8 to 593,
Nippon Steel retrenched 8 to 590 and Daido Steel fell 18 to
799.</p>
<p>Tokyo Electric Power lost 80 to 4,110, while Kansai
Electric fell 50 to 3,380.</p>
<p>Chubu Electric was down 30 to 3,180.</p>
<p>London share prices were lower, led down on bearish
sentiment, a weak start on Wall Street and a handful of
special situations.</p>
<p>Stocks were depressed from the outset in the wake of a
savage attack on the banking sector in local press reports,
dealers said.</p>
<p>Additionally, late-morning money supply figures added to
the market's misfortunes; the figures showed a #9.2 billion
($15.09 billion) rise in bank lending for the latest month,
much higher than the #7.5 billion expected.</p>
<p>These new money supply data for March showed that while
domestic demand remains relatively buoyant, the country's
corporate sector is coming under increasing pressure from the
high level of base rates. The figures "took the market from
being just slightly down to being really down," said one
director of equities.</p>
<p>And although weak from the start, London shares descended
more energetically on a disappointing start to Wall Street,
where the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 33.34 points
at the close of the European day.</p>
<p>At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index was down 27.9 points at 2159.2, just above the intraday
minimum of 2159.1 and well below the opening best of 2185.1.</p>
<p>At its final tally, the narrower FT 30 share index was
down 19.9 points at 1692.7. Volume amounted to a sparse 382.6
million shares, down from 410.7 million Friday.</p>
<p>Traders also suggested that activity remained thin as the
market awaited Wednesday's release of U.K. balance of
payments data for March.</p>
<p>In corporate developments, Hammerson shares were down on
news of its results showing a 0.3% increase in pretax profit.
The shares shed 23 pence (38 cents) to 720 pence ($11.80).</p>
<p>Clearing banks were among the hardest hit, as some
suggested that the money supply data combined with poor
results from banks in the U.S. and negative local press
comment to knock banks' share prices.</p>
<p>Barclays dropped 18 pence to 519 in heavy dealing of six
million shares. National Westminster shed 16 to 311, Midland
Bank was off 6 to 310 and Lloyds lost 9 to 255. Dealers said
program trades contributed to the weakness in the sector's
prices.</p>
<p>Eurotunnel, which reported a long-expected increase in
cost estimates for the channel tunnel project that will force
a rights issue and additional bank lending, saw its shares
drop as much as 10 pence before finishing 5 higher at 578.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, stock prices closed lower in Paris, Brussels,
Amsterdam and Milan and mixed in Stockholm. Zurich was closed
for a local holiday. South African gold stocks closed lower.</p>
<p>Share prices closed lower in Hong Kong, Seoul, Sydney,
Singapore and Manila, were mixed in Wellington and higher in
Taipei.</p>
