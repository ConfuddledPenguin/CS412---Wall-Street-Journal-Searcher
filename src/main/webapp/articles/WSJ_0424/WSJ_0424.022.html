	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Commerce Department ruled that more than
$1 billion in annual imports of synthetic-fiber sweaters from
three Asian countries is being sold in the U.S. at unfairly
low prices.
   The preliminary finding, if upheld by the department,
could lead to the imposition of anti-dumping duties on the
imports. For that to happen, the U.S. International Trade
Commission would have to find, in a separate inquiry, that
the imports are injuring a domestic industry.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In its ruling, the Commerce Department provisionally
recommended duties as high as 37% on the Taiwanese sweaters,
but much lower ones on those from South Korea and Hong Kong.
Dumping is defined as selling in another country at below the
home-market price or the cost of production. Anti-dumping
duties are intended to offset the unfair price advantages.</p>
<p>U.S. merchants were somewhat relieved that the department
didn't set the possible penalty duties as high as recommended
by the National Knitwear & Sportswear Association, which
petitioned for the anti-dumping investigation.</p>
<p>But the merchants were concerned about the ruling's
potential impact on rules governing the international textile
trade. The U.S. has negotiated import limits with most of its
major foreign textile suppliers since the mid-1970s. During
that period, it rarely has initiated anti-dumping actions
against them.</p>
<p>"We are raising the question of double jeopardy," said
Martin Lewin, an attorney for the U.S. Association of
Importers of Textiles and Apparel, which represents many of
the major department-store chains and retail outlets. "Those
countries already are under import quotas. It wouldn't be
fair to impose anti-dumping duties on them as well."</p>
<p>The Commerce Department insists that it's acting in accord
with the Multifiber Arrangement, the umbrella pact covering
the textile trade. "There's nothing in the MFA that would
prevent the U.S. government from conducting this
investigation," a department spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong government said it will question the U.S.
action in the current round of trade talks conducted under
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. "In the free
economy of Hong Kong, we don't dump," asserted P. C. Leung,
Hong Kong's Washington-based trade counselor. "There's no
reason for us to sell at a loss; it would be easier for us to
put money in a bank and earn interest."</p>
<p>Taiwan, the largest of the three suppliers, could suffer
serious losses in the U.S. market if the duties are imposed.
The ruling set a margin of 36.89% on shipments from four
Taiwanese firms and a margin of 25.2% on products of several
others. The value of Taiwan's shipments of sweaters to the
U.S. last year was $485.5 million.</p>
<p>The margins found for sweaters from Hong Kong range from
0.01% to 12.02%, and those for the South Korean shipments,
with a few exceptions, were slight. But the mere fact that
these products are under investigation creates some
"uncertainty in the market," Mr. Lewin said. Last year,
sweater shipments from South Korea and Hong Kong totaled an
estimated $476.1 million and $208.8 million, respectively.</p>
<p>A final determination on the knitwear association's
complaint is due July 5.</p>
