	<p class="article-leader">MOSCOW -- It's a typical Sunday afternoon at the Pyongyang
Restaurant in downtown Moscow.
   North Korean diplomats and South Korean businessmen rub
elbows and exchange pleasantries. The founder of the martial
art tae kwon do, Choi Hong Hi, a former South Korean army
general accused by Seoul of defecting to the North 14 years
ago, trades friendly chatter with both sides. Russian waiters
in tuxedos serve students from the communist North and
visiting tycoons from the anticommunist South.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While official negotiations aimed at ending four decades
of hostility between the two countries routinely explode in
accusations and threats, Koreans from both sides manage to
meet and eat together civilly in the land of glasnost. For
both northerners and southerners, who haven't been allowed
since the early 1950s to so much as exchange letters across
the demilitarized zone that divides the Korean peninsula, the
attractions are kimchi (pickled cabbage), noodles and rice
wine.</p>
<p>The restaurant is the brainchild of the state-run Moscow
Restaurant Service, which also has brought Baskin-Robbins and
McDonald's to the Soviet capital. "Our customers are foreign
tourists, Russians, South Korean businessmen and North Korean
Embassy people," says Gyenadi Krasnikov, who co-manages the
Pyongyang with a North Korean official. "There is no problem
with the Koreans. Here they are like friends."</p>
<p>The restaurant opened in September as an equally owned
joint venture between the Soviet company and a North Korean
concern called Rina. Mr. Krasinov says the initial investment
figure is a "business secret." But Ri Chae Ho, one of 10
Koreans sent from the North to staff the restaurant, says
Pyongyang invested about 400,000 rubles ($659,000) in the
operation.</p>
<p>The drab exterior, typical of shops and restaurants in the
Soviet Union, hides a nicely appointed interior with
carved-wood furniture in one room and long communal tables in
another. To the jarring mix of Russian rock music and
revolutionary North Korean songs, diners wash down a typical
feast of beef ribs, tofu, chicken and nuts, bean sprouts and
the essential varieties of kimchi with Pepsi-Cola and North
Korean vodka for 70 rubles a head.</p>
<p>Gong Ro Myung, head of the South Korean consular office in
Moscow and the highest-ranking Seoul official in the Soviet
Union, doesn't eat at the Pyongyang, "because the food isn't
very good," he says. "It's very crude."</p>
<p>There is "no diplomatic reason" for staying away, he
insists. "I'm telling many people that the fact that
South-North relations {are} taking place like this in Moscow
is very positive," he says. "If Mr. Soh {Soh Song Pil, the
new North Korean ambassador to the Soviet Union} invites me,
I'd be glad to go there myself."</p>
<p>Sung Jung Hyun, director-general of the Moscow office of
the South's Korea Trade Promotion Corp., says he eats at the
Pyongyang regularly but reluctantly. "The quality of the food
and service is very bad," he says. "But if I want Korean food
-- and all Koreans want Korean food -- I have no choice."</p>
<p>South Korean businessmen apparently are less fussy. "In
the seven months since we opened, around 1,200 South Korean
businessmen have visited," says Mr. Ri.</p>
<p>This past Sunday found Hyundai business group founder
Chung Ju Yung as the host to a luncheon for company
executives in a private room. The tycoon flew in earlier this
month to seal a $6 billion petrochemical deal and a Siberian
lumber project.</p>
<p>In an adjacent room, a group of North Korean Embassy
officials, all sporting lapel badges of their country's
"Great Leader" Kim Il Sung, lunched with their families. At a
nearby table, Mr. Choi, president of the World Tae Kwon Do
Federation, entertained Russian and Korean martial-arts
officials. A founding general of the South Korean army and
former ambassador to Malaysia, Mr. Choi fell afoul of
President Park Chung Hee in the 1970s, fled to Canada and was
branded a defector by successive Seoul governments.</p>
<p>"I did not defect. I am a nationalist. We Koreans want
unification, and here in the restaurant," he said, surveying
the room, "you can see unification."</p>
<p>On his way out, Hyundai's Mr. Chung stopped to chat
briefly with Mr. Choi. Their conversation immediately turned
to hopes for unification. Mr. Choi praised the Hyundai
executive's unprecedented visit to North Korea last year to
try to engineer a business breakthrough.</p>
<p>"I'm glad you're working for the benefit of unification,"
Mr. Choi said. "Our generation should accomplish
unification."</p>
<p>Mr. Chung agreed, but the North Korean-born self-made man,
whose conglomerate has annual sales rivaling the North's
gross national product, parted with a more down-to-earth
request of the Toronto-based Mr. Choi: "Please help us sell
more Hyundai cars in Canada."</p>
