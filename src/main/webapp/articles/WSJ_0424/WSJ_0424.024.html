	<p class="article-leader">HARTFORD, Conn. -- In the wake of the company's report
that first-quarter profit rose nearly 9%, United Technologies
Corp. Chairman Robert F. Daniell said he's confident the
earnings growth will continue.
   Addressing the company's annual meeting, Mr. Daniell
attributed the growth to corporatewide, cost-cutting efforts
that "will bear fruit for years to come." He cited the Pratt
& Whitney jet engine division's plan to trim costs as much as
30% by 1992 as "emblematic of these efforts."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Earnings climbed to $134.5 million, or $1.05 a share, from
$123.7 million, or 95 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue
increased to $4.8 billion from $4.46 billion.</p>
<p>Mr. Daniell said a three-year working capital reduction
program, which is in place, is expected to save $1 billion by
1991. "In 1989, the first year of the program, we reduced the
absolute level of working capital tied up in our businesses
by about $350 million, even as revenue rose 7%," he said.
"New opportunities for us on the commercial side in Eastern
Europe and the Soviet Union can more than make up for any
slack caused by reductions in the defense budget."</p>
<p>He said the company will continue to invest in research
and development. It has done a better job of transferring and
applying aerospace and defense technology to its commercial
and industrial businesses, Mr. Daniell said. The company's
businesses include building systems, automotive products and
aerospace.</p>
