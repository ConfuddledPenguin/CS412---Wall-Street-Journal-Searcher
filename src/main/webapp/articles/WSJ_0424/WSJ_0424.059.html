	<p class="article-leader">"If I knew for a certainty that a man was coming to my
house with the conscious design of doing me good, I should
run for my life. . . . I never heard of a philanthropic
meeting in which it was sincerely proposed to do any good to
me, or the like of me."
   -- from "Walden"</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>CONCORD, Mass. -- Henry David Thoreau, brace yourself. The
philanthropists are coming.</p>
<p>Rock star Don Henley is leading the charge, bringing with
him actors Don Johnson and Carrie Fisher and singers Bonnie
Raitt, Arlo Guthrie and Bob Seger. Their mission is to save
Walden Pond from developers, to keep it free from the blot of
civilization.</p>
<p>They will do this in the way they know best, by charging
locals $22 a ticket to hear them talk about the Pond and sing
some classic rock 'n' roll. Two concerts are planned --
tonight and tomorrow night -- and it's all for a good cause.</p>
<p>Or is it?</p>
<p>Mr. Henley -- formerly of the Eagles (hit song: "Hotel
California") and the host of the party where Gary Hart met
Donna Rice -- thought he was going to save Walden Pond from
an office building and condominiums. But it turns out that
the condo project includes some affordable housing -- of
which there is precious little in this exclusive community.</p>
<p>Suddenly, solid liberal ground became a little shaky. One
state official, implying that Mr. Henley had been hoodwinked,
wrote him a letter cautioning that "the environmental
objections being raised . . . are a thinly veiled attempt" by
hoity-toity Concordians to keep out hoi polloi.</p>
<p>Besides, others chime in, Walden isn't exactly the
pristine retreat it was when Henry David (as the
philosopher/naturalist is called here) was trekking around
the woods in the 19th century. The office building, proposed
by developer and magazine publisher Mortimer Zuckerman,
wouldn't really mar the scenic shores of Walden. The site is
separated from the pond by a heavily traveled four-lane
highway, the town dump and a trailer park.</p>
<p>More than a few locals think it's a bit ironic that
jet-setting stars are claiming kinship with the frugal Mr.
Thoreau. But, Mr. Henley told a Boston newspaper, "Thoreau
and Emerson had a great deal of influence in my life. They
made me more aware of nature and the environment." He noted
that he read "Walden" while studying English at North Texas
State University about 20 years ago.</p>
<p>In a letter to the state, he wrote: "Pieces of our
heritage disappear one by one without people even noticing.
It always comes down to Nature vs. Economics. Nature vs.
Jobs. Nature vs. Profit. Nature vs. this thing we call
`progress' -- and Nature always loses."</p>
<p>When Mr. Henley found out about the proposed developments,
he offered help to Thomas Blanding, a Thoreau scholar and
president of the Thoreau Country Conservation Alliance.</p>
<p>No one really doubts the rock star's sincerity. He just
happens to have stepped into a battle that's been going on
for several years, with Mr. Blanding's forces on one side and
the development and housing forces on the other.</p>
<p>The debate in part reflects Concord's own schizophrenia.
It is trying to maintain its rich past: It was at the Old
North Bridge in Concord on April 19, 1775, that the British
were turned back by the Minutemen. Ralph Waldo Emerson, Mr.
Thoreau's mentor, lived here. So did Nathaniel Hawthorne and
Louisa May Alcott.</p>
<p>But it is also trying to maintain its rich present: In
recent years Concord has become an expensive suburb, a home
for wealthy Boston commuters. Mr. Thoreau built his humble
one-room home on Walden Pond for $28.12 1/2 cents. Today,
Concord homes cost an average of $300,000; some fetch more
than $1 million.</p>
<p>Streets are lined with fashionable shops and real-estate
agencies. The entrees at Walden Station Restaurant include
Chicken Thoreau -- "excellent mesquite flavored boneless
breast, with shiitake mushrooms and a boursin cream sauce" --
a dish Mr. Thoreau never mentions cooking on his wood stove
at Walden Pond.</p>
<p>The pond -- actually more the size of a lake -- lies a
mile-and-a-half south of the town center. Here, Mr. Thoreau
lived a life of contemplation from July 1845 to September
1847. It was an almost idyllic spot, judging by but one
description in his book: "This small lake was of most value
as a neighbor in the intervals of a gentle rainstorm in
August, when, both air and water being perfectly still, but
the sky overcast, mid-afternoon had all the serenity of
evening, and the wood thrush sang around, and was heard from
shore to shore."</p>
<p>The pond is still beautiful, its water clear and smooth as
glass on a windless day. And, with 411 acres surrounding the
pond given to the state by the Emerson family and others in
1922, the immediate area hasn't been developed.</p>
<p>But if a wood thrush sings nowadays, you can't hear it,
much less from the other shore.</p>
<p>At one end of the pond is a man-made beach that draws
thousands of swimmers on hot summer weekends. Anglers line
the shore hoping to catch the trout that's stocked in the
pond by the state. A concrete boat launch sits at one corner
(though only canoes and rowboats are allowed). Constant
traffic on nearby roads creates incessant noise.</p>
<p>The undulating hills in the surrounding area, where Mr.
Thoreau walked and meditated, are still wooded and, in
places, relatively tranquil. Here -- well out of sight of the
pond -- the new condominiums are planned.</p>
<p>While Thoreauvians concede that the woods are already
dotted with high-priced homes, they argue that the condos and
office building, though at two separate sites, take
development one step too far. "It's a domino effect. They
talk about the dump across the road," says Ann Chapman, a
Thoreauvian. "If you put this {office building} in, it would
justify another development. What's enough?"</p>
<p>Planning officials defend the projects. The condos would
be about three-fourths of a mile away from Walden Pond, not
on its shores, notes Judith Chanoux Cutler, Concord's town
planner. Also, the 139-unit condo project, a venture between
two Boston developers, would include 42 units of low- or
moderate-income housing subsidized by the state. The state
approved it because less than 3% of Concord's housing is
classed as affordable.</p>
<p>Concord policeman D.A. Goranson, who grew up in town,
favors the projects. "I know Walden Pond, and this isn't the
Walden Pond I knew as a child," he says. Anyway, he adds, the
area needs affordable housing. "Many town employees can't
live here because they can't afford it," he notes.</p>
<p>Had it not been for Mr. Henley, the matter probably would
have been merely debated over coffee, talked about after
church. But then he stepped in. Radio stations began
promoting the concerts and the issue became more public.</p>
<p>Mr. Henley and the Thoreauvians now promise to help find
another spot in Concord for affordable housing -- and pitch
in money to buy the land. But that will be easier said than
done. Notes Ms. Cutler, "Nobody supports affordable housing
unless it's someplace else. It's not easy to find another
site."</p>
<p>If no other site can be found, Mr. Henley wrote that he
would "explore the possibility" of building the affordable
units at the existing site, but not the higher-priced condos.
Mr. Henley is no longer giving interviews.</p>
<p>But first his group will have to raise the money to buy
that site and the office site, a total that could exceed $10
million. The two concerts this week might net $500,000,
supporters estimate, so more celebrity bashes may be
necessary.</p>
<p>The Thoreauvians do have one well-heeled convert already:
Mr. Zuckerman. While insisting there is nothing wrong with
his proposed office building, he says he would happily sell
it for no profit -- and will even contribute $100,000 to
their cause.</p>
