	<p class="article-leader">Cetus Corp., Emeryville, Calif., and F. Hoffmann-La Roche
Ltd. said they reached an agreement to market interleukin-2
products in Europe.
   The Roche Holding Inc. unit and EuroCetus B.V., Cetus's
European subsidiary, will each market both Proleukin and
Roferon-A in Switzerland and in all European Community member
countries except Denmark and Greece.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Each company will pay a commission to the other on sales
of its proprietary product. Proleukin is approved for
marketing in most of Europe for the treatment of advanced
kidney cancer. Roferon-A is approved for the treatment of
various cancer and viral diseases. The western European
anti-cancer market is estimated to be $700 million, the
companies said.</p>
<p>The companies agreed to collaborate on the clinical
development of interleukin-2 products for other potential
cancer and non-cancer uses. Roche will make an initial
payment to Cetus and share in expenses for the development of
these additional therapeutic indications.</p>
<p>In addition, the companies said they agreed to collaborate
on the development of Proleukin and Roferon-A as a combined
treatment for cancer and other diseases, with Roche bearing
the costs.</p>
