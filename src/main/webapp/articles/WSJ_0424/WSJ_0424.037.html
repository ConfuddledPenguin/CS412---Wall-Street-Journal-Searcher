"Where the Buffalo Don't Roam": Permitting the shooting of
bison that wander outside the boundaries of Yellowstone Park
makes no more sense than declaring open season on animals
that escape from their cages at the zoo. Park officials'
claim of "keeping animals wild by allowing them natural
movement through their natural habitat" is ludicrous. Are
bears that live off garbage and wander up to tourists' cars
begging handouts natural? Yes, "population control has to
happen," but surely it can be accomplished more humanely.
   I saw scenes of the "hunt" on TV -- animal-rights
activists pleading to have a bleeding, struggling animal put
out of its misery while "hunters" stood about laughing,
prolonging the creature's terrible suffering because they got
a kick out of the effect it had on the activists. Even the
park rangers, condoning this behavior and chasing away those
who attempt to keep the animals within park boundaries, don't
behave like real rangers in Yellowstone.</p>

<p>While Ms. Rudner's article did a fairly accurate job of
portraying a complex situation, attention should be brought
to a coloring of an important fact. Ms. Rudner states,
"Because {bison} can carry brucellosis, which causes cattle
to abort if they come into contact with the fresh afterbirth
of an aborted bison fetus, ranchers are understandably
concerned if bison cross the boundary."</p>
<p>That sounds like reasonable justification for the hunt --
but the Humane Society says there isn't a case on record of
brucellosis being passed from wild bison to domestic cows.
The ranchers' stated reason for protection is actually
nothing more than a smoke screen to masquerade their true
motives -- to eliminate competition from increasingly scarce
grazing lands.</p>
<p>It's time the public took notice of this travesty, and let
Congress know that it won't put up with the senseless
slaughter of an American treasure.</p>
