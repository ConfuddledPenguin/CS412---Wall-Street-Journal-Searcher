	<p class="article-leader">OAKLAND, Calif. -- A deal to bring the Los Angeles Raiders
football team back to Oakland is in serious trouble due to
mounting public opposition.
   Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson said he planned to ask the
Oakland city council late yesterday to rescind its approval
of the proposal.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The mayor's action followed the delivery late last week of
anti-Raiders petitions bearing 33,000 signatures, about
13,000 more than necessary to place the issue before
Oakland's voters. Opponents had argued that the offer, which
guaranteed the football franchise $428 million in payments
over 15 years, would place an unwarranted burden on Oakland's
treasury.</p>
<p>Only five weeks ago, Mayor Wilson had euphorically
proclaimed the return of the team. But at a press conference
this week, the mayor -- facing re-election this year -- said
that if the Raiders deal "isn't dead, it's dying." Raiders
officials themselves had said that they would kill the deal
rather than face a ballot initiative.</p>
<p>However, Mayor Wilson didn't rule out renewed talks with
the Raiders, and some Raiders boosters said there was a slim
chance that a new accord could be struck to eliminate a major
sticking point, that of guarantees by taxpayers. Opponents
have charged that taxpayers would be forced to make up a $200
million deficit even if Raiders games sold out over the next
15 years.</p>
