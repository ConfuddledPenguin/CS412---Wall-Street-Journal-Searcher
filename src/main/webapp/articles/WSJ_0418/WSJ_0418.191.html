	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Charles P. Young Co. and Sorg Inc., both
financial printers that are operating under bankruptcy-court
protection, separately agreed to sell parts of their
operations.
   Young will sell certain operations in New York, Atlanta,
Boston and Washington, D.C., to Devon Group Inc., a graphic
arts company based in Stamford, Conn., for $4.6 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Young will continue to operate its Fidelity Printing Co.
unit in Houston, and will liquidate its printing equipment,
an attorney for the company said. Young was created in
January 1989, when the printing company was bought by CPY
Acquisition Co. from Service Resources Corp.</p>
<p>Devon Group plans to combine its Aztech Financial Printers
subsidiary with the Young operations, and to call the new
subsidiary Aztech-Chas. P. Young Group. An official of Devon,
which had 1989 revenue of more than $170 million, said adding
the Young operations would make Aztech the fifth-largest
financial printer in the U.S. in terms of revenue, from the
10th largest. Aztech's chairman and chief executive officer,
Andrew I. Cramer, will assume those duties at the merged
operation; Michael F. Weinberg, president of Chas. P. Young
New York, will be president.</p>
<p>Separately, Sorg, another financial printer operating with
protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal
Bankruptcy Code, accepted in principle an offer from New
York-based Bowne & Co., one of the largest financial
printers, to purchase the Sorg name and other assets for $6
million, plus amounts to be determined depending on the
assets sold.</p>
<p>Sorg, which listed assets of $31 million and liabilities
of $25 million when it filed under Chapter 11 last August,
said the agreement doesn't include its real estate, Chicago
office and various other assets.</p>
