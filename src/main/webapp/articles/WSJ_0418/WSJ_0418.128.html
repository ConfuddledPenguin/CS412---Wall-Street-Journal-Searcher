	<p class="article-leader">Kirk Kerkorian, who holds an 82% stake in MGM/UA
Communications Co. through Tracinda Corp., said in a filing
that he hasn't decided whether to retain an equity interest
in MGM/UA if it is acquired by Pathe Communications Corp.
   The filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission
followed published reports that Mr. Kerkorian intends to
retain a 15% interest in MGM/UA.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"That's not true, but it's an option he has," said a
spokesman for Mr. Kerkorian. MGM/UA is a Beverly Hills,
Calif.-based entertainment concern.</p>
<p>Pathe Communications, a Los Angeles-based entertainment
concern controlled by Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti,
began a $20-a-share tender offer for MGM/UA last month. Pathe
has said it expects the $1.25 billion offer to be completed
by April 30.</p>
