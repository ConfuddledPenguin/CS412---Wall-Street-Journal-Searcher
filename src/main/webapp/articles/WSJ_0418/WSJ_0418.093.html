	<p class="article-leader">One year ago this month, T. Boone Pickens issued a
statement declaring that he had acquired 20% of my company's
stock. At first, we at Koito Manufacturing Ltd. were
perplexed. Why would Mr. Pickens be interested in Koito's
stock at a time when it was selling at a price-earnings
multiple of about 170 to 1, as a result of a stock-cornering
scheme by an infamous Japanese greenmailer? Where did he get
this block of shares? What was Mr. Pickens's objective? How
was this related to the greenmail ploy we had been battling
at Koito for months?
   Red flags went up at Koito as soon as we discovered that
Mr. Pickens had obtained his stock from Kitaro Watanabe, the
very man Koito had been battling. Mr. Watanabe, one of
Japan's wealthiest men, has a history of speculation in
stocks and real estate and is renowned for his attempts at
greenmail, in which a company pays a shareholder a premium
price for his stake in an effort to fend off his hostile
offer. He had accumulated his block of Koito stock during an
18-month buying spree that had driven Koito's share price
from about 700 yen to more than 5,000 yen. Mr. Watanabe twice
approached Koito, looking for us to arrange a greenmail
payoff. We refused. And we were aware that Mr. Watanabe was
shopping his shares in an effort to unload his investment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Pickens said it took 10 meetings over four months to
cut the deal to assume Mr. Watanabe's stock. That told us
that the deal between Messrs. Pickens and Watanabe was
probably no simple purchase agreement. It told us nothing,
however, about the nature or terms of the arrangement with
the man who had twice tried to greenmail Koito with the very
shares Mr. Pickens had registered in his name.</p>
<p>We at Koito knew plenty about Mr. Watanabe, but not too
much about Mr. Pickens. We expected that he would ask for a
seat on our board, so we began to look closely at Mr. Pickens
and his business record in America. What we discovered
alarmed us and made us skeptical of his claims to be a
"long-term shareholder" in our company.</p>
<p>In 1985 our new "investor" had been labeled by the Supreme
Court of Delaware as "a corporate raider with a national
reputation as a greenmailer." In the same year, the federal
court in Los Angeles had found that he and his colleagues had
engaged in a "studied effort to conceal their true intent" to
put companies "in play" and to obtain greenmail, using
systematic destruction of documents and feigned inability to
recall discussions about their objectives in launching raids.</p>
<p>We also found out that Mr. Pickens faced jury trials in
cases arising from raids on Unocal and Phillips Petroleum.
Unocal shareholders charged that Mr. Pickens's company, Mesa
Petroleum, had engaged in a stock-parking scheme to enable
Mesa to avoid the rules against short-swing profits under
U.S. securities laws. In the Phillips case, a federal appeals
court found evidence last year that Mr. Pickens "had no
intention from the outset" to honor his repeated statement
that he was not interested in and would not accept greenmail.</p>
<p>The more we found out about Mr. Pickens, the more it
became clear to us that putting a stockholder whom the
American courts had labeled a greenmailer on our board would
be highly irresponsible. Greenmailers -- Japanese or American
-- are not welcome on Koito's board.</p>
<p>In this, Koito is no different from the American companies
Mr. Pickens bought into. Not one of Mr. Pickens's American
targets had given him or his representatives a seat on its
board. Gulf reorganized its corporation in order to keep Mr.
Pickens off its board. And KN Energy waged a bitter proxy
fight against his slate of directors. I chuckle now when I
read Mr. Pickens's statements that his other targets would
have put him on their boards if only he had asked. And I
understand now why Gulf and KN Energy went to such lengths to
keep him off their boards.</p>
<p>Then, there is the question of the value of Mr. Pickens's
investment. As a businessman, I am trained to look first at
the numbers, and the numbers do not look good. Simply put, at
the price Mr. Pickens says he paid for his initial block of
Koito stock, his initial acquisition cost would have been
about $840 million (calculated at the exchange rate then).
That means his interest costs over the past year, if he
actually paid for this stock, would be in excess of $90
million. The annual aggregate dividends on this stock in
prior years were less than $2 million. Even if the company
did the unthinkable and paid out its entire net profits for
the year in dividends, Mr. Pickens would receive an amount
equal only to 0.63% of his supposed acquisition price.</p>
<p>And, at current price levels, there seems little chance of
stock appreciation. (Koito's stock closed Tuesday at 3,050
yen a share, compared with the 3,395 yen price Mr. Pickens
told the Japanese government he paid for his initial block of
stock.) This "investment" makes no financial sense -- unless
there is a speculative gain to be made by selling the stock
off in a block or unless there was never a real "investment"
at all. (Mr. Pickens subsequently increased his stake in
Koito to 26.4%.)</p>
<p>A year ago when we asked Mr. Pickens to explain whether he
had some undisclosed arrangement concerning these shares with
Mr. Watanabe, he refused to respond. We have since asked him
several times to disclose the nature of his relationship with
Mr. Watanabe. The American press has asked him as well. He
refuses each time, saying that he is not required by Japanese
law to disclose such arrangements. Under American securities
laws, Mr. Pickens would be compelled to disclose -- as all 5%
shareholders are -- the sources of the funds used to buy the
stock and any arrangements with others to divide profits,
cover losses, or call or put the stock back.</p>
<p>At the same time, we are looking carefully at proposals
that would eliminate greenmailing schemes against Koito.
Among those proposals is one by Mr. Pickens that, I should
point out, avoids requiring him to make the disclosures we
repeatedly have asked for.</p>
<p>As Mr. Pickens has escalated his media attack in the past
year, I have heard him tell Koito to "put up or shut up."
This is exactly what I would like to say to Mr. Pickens:
"Either put up or shut up about your financial relationship
with the greenmailer from whom you acquired your shares."</p>
<p>After reviewing Mr. Pickens's record in the U.S., we at
Koito fully expected to be treated just like any American
company forced to weather a Pickens raid. We were prepared
for attacks on Koito's management, for litigation against us
at every opportunity, for criticisms of the company's
performance, and for the usual Pickens rhetoric of
"shareholders' rights" masking his own personal agenda.</p>
<p>We were even ready for his persistent misrepresentation of
the facts. In our case he claims that Toyota, which owns 19%
of Koito's stock, has three directors on our board. Toyota
has no representatives on Koito's board, yet Mr. Pickens
refers to me as a "Toyota director" simply because I began my
career as a young employee with that company. I have been
with Koito for 20 years, and the other Koito directors
referred to similarly by Mr. Pickens also have been with our
company for many years.</p>
<p>We were not, however, prepared for his cynical efforts to
try to depict his raid on Koito as an example of
U.S.-Japanese trade friction. Perhaps Mr. Pickens's legendary
political fund-raising ability opens more doors in Washington
than he otherwise might deserve, but his efforts to use
congressional and public concern over foreign investment to
pursue the personal and private aims of the Watanabe-Pickens
alliance can only impede progress the U.S. and Japan are
making on trade issues.</p>
<p>A year ago, we at Koito knew next to nothing about Mr.
Pickens. Today I understand what so many American CEOs went
through in the 1980s as their companies struggled to fight
off his greenmail assaults. Someday, perhaps, I will have the
opportunity to compare notes with such American executives as
W.H. Bricker of Diamond Shamrock, Fred Hartley of Unocal, and
James Lee of Gulf Oil on our unpleasant experiences with
their country's most famous corporate raider.</p>
