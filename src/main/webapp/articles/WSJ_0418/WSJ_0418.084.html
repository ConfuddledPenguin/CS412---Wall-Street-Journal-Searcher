	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Two plastics manufacturers will sponsor the
first comprehensive recycling program in four national parks
this year in hopes of preventing bans on plastic by showing
that it is recyclable.
   Dow Chemical Co. has agreed to pay for collecting and
recycling various plastics, glass and aluminum in Acadia
National Park in Maine, Great Smoky Mountain in Tennessee and
North Carolina, Grand Canyon's south rim in Arizona, and
Yosemite in California, said Joseph Gorrell, a National Park
Service official.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A Dow spokesman said Salt Lake City-based Huntsman
Holdings Corp., the nation's largest producer of polystyrene
plastic, has agreed to share the program's cost. The
five-year program is to be announced tomorrow in Washington.</p>
<p>Dow, a major plastics producer based in Midland, Mich.,
proposed the program because many states and local
governments have adopted or are considering laws that would
ban or restrict plastic packaging and products in an effort
to reduce solid waste.</p>
<p>"We know we have to get the plastic recycling rate at
least as high as aluminum and glass if we are going to
compete with those materials," said the Dow spokesman. Only
about 1% of plastic is currently recycled, compared with
about 55% of aluminum and about 11% of glass.</p>
