	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A federal appeals court here granted a
request by Amgen Inc. that stays a lower-court injunction
against Amgen in its battle with Genetics Institute Inc. over
the anti-anemia drug erythropoietin, or EPO.
   "This is a meaningful victory for Amgen," said Peter
Drake, a biotechnology analyst at Vector Securities
International Inc. in Chicago. It is one of a series of
"delay tactics" that has helped Amgen keep Genetic
Institute's version of EPO off the market, he said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While a victory for Amgen, the appeals-court action
doesn't affect the central issues in the patent dispute. One
of those issues is whether a federal magistrate's ruling last
year on the dispute is valid. The magistrate ruled that both
Amgen and Genetics Institute are infringing on certain parts
of each other's EPO patents. Both sides appealed the ruling.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a U.S. District Court in Boston last month
issued an order requiring Genetics Institute, based in
Cambridge, Mass., and Amgen, based in Thousand Oaks, Calif.,
temporarily to cross-license their respective versions of EPO
while the two sides pressed their appeals of the magistrate's
ruling. The order also would have required Amgen to take
certain actions that might have quickened Food and Drug
Administration approval of Genetics Institute's version of
EPO. Amgen's version of EPO was approved by the FDA last year
for marketing in the U.S.</p>
<p>Amgen, however, appealed the district-court order, which
would have enjoined it from selling EPO in the U.S. unless it
met terms of the order. Yesterday, the Washington appeals
court granted Amgen's request to stay the lower court's
injunction, pending the higher court's review of the
lower-court order, said Eugene Moroz, an attorney for Chugai
Pharmaceutical Co., Japan, which has licensed rights to
Genetics Institute's version of EPO.</p>
<p>Mr. Moroz added that the higher court also agreed to hold
an "expedited review" of the two sides' appeal of the
magistrate's patent ruling, possibly within 60 days. That
might help speed the dispute's overall resolution; earlier,
the review of conflicting patents held by the two sides
wasn't expected until late this year.</p>
<p>In Thousand Oaks, Calif., an Amgen spokesman said the
company hasn't seen the appeals-court order.</p>
