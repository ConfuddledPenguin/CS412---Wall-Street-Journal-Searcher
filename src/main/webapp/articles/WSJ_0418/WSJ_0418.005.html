	<p class="article-leader">THE IDEAL SECOND JOB?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>When you're a company chairman, it pays to moonlight.</p>
<p>Consider James D. Robinson III. His compensation from
American Express Co. totaled $2.6 million last year. But he
earned up to $139,000 more by serving as a director of
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Coca-Cola Co. and Union Pacific
Corp.</p>
<p>Lawrence G. Rawl did pretty well, too. On top of the $1.4
million he received from Exxon Corp., his director fees from
Champion International Corp., Chemical Banking Corp., and
Warner-Lambert Co. totaled as much as $118,000 last year.</p>
<p>Takeover threats and time pressures have prompted many top
executives to trim outside board obligations over the last
decade, from an average of about six to about three, says
Abraham Nad, who runs Directorship DataBank of Westport,
Conn. His data, based on proxies issued last year, show that
214 chairmen of Fortune 1,000 companies sit on four or more
major company boards outside their own. Several prominent
CEOs, including Walt Disney Co.'s Michael Eisner and Chrysler
Corp.'s Lee A. Iacocca, don't serve on any.</p>
<p>Companies typically don't disclose attendance or fees for
committee meetings, so it's tough to know precisely how much
individual directors earn. Roger Smith of General Motors
Corp., for one, got $30,000 in retainers for serving on the
board of Citicorp and its consulting committee. But he might
have earned as much as $30,400 more with perfect attendance
on those panels and two other board committees, which met a
total of 32 times at $950 a pop.</p>
<p>In all, Mr. Smith's board fees -- he's also a director of
Johnson & Johnson, PepsiCo Inc., and International Paper --
totaled as much as $158,000, nice pocket change for a man who
earned $2.5 million last year from his day job.</p>
<p>THE LITTLE THINGS</p>
<p>Sure, Michael Eisner makes millions. But in the wonderful
world of Walt Disney Co., little things count, too. Like the
$3,813 the company put out last year to match Mr. Eisner's
savings and investment plan contribution. And the $1,800 in
premiums it paid toward his supplemental medical insurance.
Not to mention -- but the proxy does -- the $197 in premiums
to keep active Mr. Eisner's $1 million excess-liability
insurance plan. The proxy notes that Mr. Eisner has a $3
million life-insurance policy, but doesn't specify what the
premiums were last year.</p>
<p>GOLDEN AGE</p>
<p>Earning your age. There was a time when that was the
standard of measurement for executives. Making $45,000 at 45
years old? You're doing just fine. Then came the inflation of
the '70s, coupled with the huge run-up in executive salaries
in recent years. Suddenly, it seems more appropriate to earn
your great-great-grandfather's age -- at the least. Consider
the calculations if today's CEOs were to be judged by the old
standard: They'd have to be older than Methuselah to merit
their pay. Based on last year's compensation, Paul Fireman of
Reebok International would be 14,600 years old, Coca-Cola
Co.'s Roberto C. Goizueta would be 2,500 years old, and John
F. Akers of International Business Machines Corp., 1,400
years old. No wonder they get all those health and retirement
benefits.</p>
<p>CULTURE SHOCK</p>
<p>Looking for hefty bonuses and nice annual raises? If
you're an American working for a Japanese company, you may be
looking in the wrong place.</p>
<p>"The Japanese don't reward on individual performance,"
says Christine R. Houston, a consultant with Tasa Inc. who
has conducted executive searches for the American offices of
many Japanese concerns. "It's against their ethic."</p>
<p>That ethic has its costs. Japanese banks in New York, for
instance, often have problems recruiting and keeping
first-rate American managers, Ms. Houston says. That's
largely because the banks' pay packages average about 20%
below what a top U.S. competitor might offer, she says.</p>
<p>One vice president now at a major U.S. bank left Tokai
Bank's New York office last fall after a year and a half on
the job, in part because his first annual raise trailed
inflation and his bonus was just 10%, not the 25% he says the
bank told him to expect.</p>
<p>"Our system says you have to do certain things for
employees or they will leave," he says. "Japanese employees
don't leave."</p>
<p>Several major Japanese banks in this country, including
Tokai, recently hired Americans to help them grapple with
U.S. ways of paying. Fuji Bank Ltd., among other changes, has
introduced 401K plans for the 170 employees in its New York
office and has doubled some potential bonus levels. "We
weren't getting the quality of person we needed," admits
Brian T. Thompson, who joined Fuji last year as senior vice
president for human resources. Now, he says, "we want to deal
with Americans the way they would expect to be dealt with in
an American company."</p>
<p>NO DEPOSIT</p>
<p>Computers may promise a paperless society, but there's one
bit of paper that's unlikely to disappear from the American
workplace any time soon: the paycheck.</p>
<p>Just 14% of private-sector employees have their checks
deposited in their bank accounts electronically. That
compares with 70% of federal workers and more than 95% of all
employees in Japan and some European countries, according to
the National Automated Clearinghouse Association, a trade
group that promotes direct deposit.</p>
<p>Many employees clearly don't want direct deposit.
According to the clearinghouse association, more than half
the major U.S. companies offer it, though some restrict the
option to managers and senior executives. Dallas-based AMR
Corp., parent of American Airlines, recently rejected direct
deposit as an option for its 77,000 employees, after a poll
of workers showed insufficient interest.</p>
<p>Other companies prefer not to offer direct deposit because
of the cost-both of adopting a new payroll system and of
giving up a day or two of bank float on every paycheck. And
some firms may not want to lose the opportunity that
disbursing checks can provide. "It's a weekly reminder of
who's boss," says Larry Hirschhorn, a specialist in
organizational behavior at the Wharton Center for Applied
Research.</p>
<p>ALL YOUR EGGS</p>
<p>More companies are tying compensation to performance by
increasing the role of stock in the pay of top executives.
But it's causing a problem for many executives: Can they hold
big chunks of company stock and also maintain balanced
personal portfolios?</p>
<p>"It's a struggle," says Carol R. Caruthers, a Price
Waterhouse consultant who advises senior managers on personal
finance. At some companies, "it would not appear you're part
of the team or the leadership if you didn't hold large
amounts of company stock."</p>
<p>Younger executives with growing families feel the pain
most, she says. After covering expenses, they often find
company stock their only remaining asset. One told her his
cash flow was better when he was working a paper route as a
14-year-old.</p>
<p>To relieve the pressure, Ms. Caruthers says, some
companies are becoming more flexible about letting employees
sell their stock in order to raise cash to exercise new stock
options. And they're giving more bonuses and special rewards
in cash, not stock. "That gives people a chance to
diversify," she says.</p>
