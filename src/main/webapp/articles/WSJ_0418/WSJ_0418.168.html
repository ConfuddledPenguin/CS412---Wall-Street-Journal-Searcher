	<p class="article-leader">Baroid Corp. said a New Orleans jury found it, a retired
vice president and other defendants innocent of trying to fix
prices for oil-well completion fluids in 1986 and 1987.
   The Houston oil-field services concern -- controlled by
Dallas investor Harold C. Simmons -- and retired executive
Kenneth D. Tanner were indicted along with two other
companies and an executive of one of those concerns in
August.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The indictment charged that Baroid, then a unit of NL
Industries Inc., and the two other companies conspired to
increase their prices for completion fluids by decreasing the
amount they paid customers for fluids that weren't used.</p>
<p>The company said it was "gratified" that the jury agreed
with its position that it wasn't guilty of any offense.</p>
