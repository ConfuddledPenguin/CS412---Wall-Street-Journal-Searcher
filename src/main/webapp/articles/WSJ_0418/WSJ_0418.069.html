	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Pierre Nadeau complains that Joseph Rana's nose
"is an ugly thing, big, very offensive." Like some of Mr.
Rana's other neighbors, Mr. Nadeau wants the nose removed.
Toronto's city government emphatically agrees.
   The Rana nose is indeed big. It's four feet high and three
feet wide, built for Mr. Rana by an artist friend out of
plaster and canvas. The giant schnoz is mounted on the
building where Mr. Rana lives and operates a restaurant, and
appears to be bursting through the second-story wall.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It's creative, it's art, it was intended to poke fun at
my own big nose," Mr. Rana says.</p>
<p>"It's nothing to sneeze at," counters Peter Gordon, city
solicitor, who contends the protuberance is illegal, for one
because it juts out above a restaurant door on a quiet street
where business signs are banned. "We're trying to minimize
commercial use of what is already a very commercial area," he
sniffs.</p>
<p>But in fighting the first complaint filed by the city, the
restaurateur's lawyer, Michael Caroline, successfully argued
that the nose wasn't designed to have commercial value. The
artist, Jan Walsh, said in an affidavit that to suggest the
sculpture has any commercial intent is "absurd" because it is
inspired by Mr. Rana's nose, "the subject of much amusement."</p>
<p>So the city then charged Mr. Rana with infringing a bylaw,
allowing a structure to "remain in a city boulevard," because
the nose overhangs city property.</p>
<p>But before you could say Cyrano de Bergerac, the city
withdrew that charge in favor of a more pointed one: That the
nose violates city bylaw 12519, section 35, by placing "a
structure, to whit replica of a nose structure, which
encroaches upon the street allowance . . . without first
having obtained leave from the Committee on Works and
Council." Mr. Rana, who has spent about 20,000 Canadian
dollars ($17,153) defending his snout, must appear in Ontario
provincial court Friday.</p>
<p>His attorney concedes that the nose may protrude into city
airspace a foot or so, but says the property in question is
only a parking space.</p>
<p>"This smacks of a vendetta," Mr. Caroline snorts, adding:
"You can't legislate good taste. It wouldn't be illegal for
Mr. Rana or anyone else to paint their house purple with
orange polka dots, if that's what they want. . . . Surely
there's a better use for taxpayers' money than fighting this
nose."</p>
