	<p class="article-leader">AM International Inc. said a "significant charge" in its
fiscal third quarter ending April 30 -- related to a
reorganization of the company -- will result in a loss for
the quarter. The company wouldn't specify the amount of the
charge or projected loss.
   In the year-earlier third quarter, AM earned $8.1 million,
or 12 cents a share, on revenue of $223 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Chicago-based graphics equipment concern said the
charge is the result of its strategic plan to focus on its
core business -- which prints business forms -- by disposing
of non-core business units.</p>
<p>AM said it has agreed to sell its Digi Electronic Products
unit to Barco N.V., a Belgian-based company, for $8 million.
Last month, AM agreed to sell two other non-core business
units, AM Technologies and its machine tool business of AM
Wohlenberg.</p>
<p>The company said the revamping also includes the
previously announced consolidation of its Multigraphics and
International divisions; the segmenting of the company's AM
Graphics business into separate units; and further
consolidations of its European operations. AM will also write
down the assets of its computer graphics business.</p>
<p>The graphics equipment concern also said that while it
expects to post a profit in the fourth quarter, the
"magnitude of the restructuring charge will eliminate that
profit," resulting in a loss for the year. For the year ended
July 31, 1989, AM earned $31 million, or 46 cents a share, on
revenue of $850.6 million.</p>
