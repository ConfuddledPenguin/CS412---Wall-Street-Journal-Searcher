	<p class="article-leader">Your March 1 article "FDA Asks Firms to Change Epilepsy
Drug's Packaging" cited Tegretol, the brand name of
Ciba-Geigy, and carbamazepine, sold as the generic, as losing
one-third of their effectiveness if stored in humid
conditions. We at the Epilepsy Institute in New York received
hundreds of phone calls after the article appeared.
   In order to advise people with epilepsy correctly on this
issue, we contacted the FDA, only to learn that the degree of
humidity and length of time were not available. Thank you for
making this information available to your readership.</p>
