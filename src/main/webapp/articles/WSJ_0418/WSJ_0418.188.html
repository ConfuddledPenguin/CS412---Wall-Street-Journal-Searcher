	<p class="article-leader">United Telecommunications Inc. said it plans to acquire
GTE Corp.'s remaining 19.9% stake in US Sprint Communications
Co. for $500 million.
   William T. Esrey, United Telecom's chairman, president and
chief executive officer, told shareholders that the Kansas
City, Mo., company will pay book value for the interest, in a
transaction expected to be completed by early July.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The purchase was expected, under terms of a 1988 agreement
in which United Telecom and GTE ended their 50-50 partnership
in the long-distance telephone service venture, and United
Telecom boosted its holding to 79.1%. US Sprint is the
third-largest long-distance telephone service, with $1.2
billion of revenue in the first quarter, up 24%.</p>
<p>Separately, United and GTE, based in Stamford, Conn.,
posted first-quarter profit gains of 41% and 8%,
respectively. United's revenue grew by 24% and GTE's 9%. Both
gains were in line with the expectations of financial
analysts.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, United Telecom closed at $39.875 a share, down 25
cents a share. GTE closed at $66, off 37.5 cents a share.</p>
<p>At United's annual meeting, as expected, shareholders
approved a measure to rename the company Sprint Corp. after
purchase of the 19.9% stake from GTE. And Mr. Esrey, 50 years
old, assumed the title of chairman, succeeding Paul H.
Henson, 64, who retired but who will continue as a director.</p>
<p>In an interview, Mr. Esrey said United plans to finance
the transaction with loans and that the acquisition won't
dilute earnings. "We always said we would exercise the
{purchase} option when financial results of Sprint justified
the cost of the buyout," he said.</p>
<p>Analysts concurred in his optimism about the long-term
outlook. Sprint's "momentum is very strong," said Jack
Grubman of Paine Webber.</p>
<p>For the first quarter, United had net income of $106.9
million, or 51 cents a share, up from $75.6 million, or 36
cents a share, the year earlier. Revenue jumped to $2.02
billion from $1.77 billion.</p>
<p>At Sprint, operating profit climbed sharply -- to $85
million from $31 million as revenue jumped 24% to $1.2
billion. Even so, the revenue growth didn't meet internal
expectations largely because, analysts said, one or two
contracts weren't booked in the period by Sprint's Telenet
communications network operation.</p>
<p>United's local telephone company operations posted
operating earnings of $169 million, up $12 million, or 7.6%,
from a year ago. Revenue rose more than 3% to $662 million
from $641 million the year before.</p>
<p>At GTE, net totaled $355.2 million, or $1.05 a share, up
from $329.2 million, or 97 cents a share, the year before.
Revenue increased to $4.5 billion from $4.12 billion.</p>
<p>Despite a $101 million rate reduction, GTE's local
telephone operations posted a 4% rise in operating profit to
$720 million on a 5% revenue increase to $3.2 billion. Among
other things, the results reflect higher foreign revenue, a
4% increase in lines in service and an 11% jump in
minute-of-use of local long-distance calling.</p>
<p>Telecommunications products and services showed a sharp
increase to $37 million from the year-ago $10 million, which
included a provision for a one-time loss on a government
contract. Revenue swelled 37% to $798 million from $580
million.</p>
<p>Operating profit in electrical-products operations fell
8.2% to $67 million, reflecting stiff competition, lower
foreign results and the impact of the softening automobile
industry. Sales increased 3% to $567 million from $548
million.</p>
<p>The mobile communication business, which provides cellular
service, attracted 56,000 new customers for a total of
319,000, the company said.</p>
