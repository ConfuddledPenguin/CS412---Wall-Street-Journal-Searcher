	<p class="article-leader">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Polaroid Corp. reported a
disappointing 23% rise in first-quarter earnings on a sales
decline of 1.4% and again scaled back its own projections for
earnings growth in 1990.
   Citing a "slower than expected" world-wide business
environment, the company said it now expects only "moderate
growth" in 1990, instead of the "substantially higher"
earnings it had projected in November.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A Polaroid spokesman declined to be more specific about
the company's outlook for 1990.</p>
<p>For the first quarter, Polaroid posted earnings of $31.8
million, or 43 cents a share, compared with $25.9 million, or
29 cents a share, in the like 1989 quarter. The year-earlier
figure was after $38.5 million pretax charge representing the
cost of fighting off a hostile takeover bid by Shamrock
Holdings Inc. Sales slipped to $436.2 million from $442.3
million.</p>
<p>The company's results, which were released shortly before
the stock market closed, were below Wall Street estimates of
about 48 cents a share, according to Prudential-Bache analyst
Alex Henderson. Mr. Henderson had been expecting 52 cents a
share. Polaroid closed at $45.50, down 25 cents, in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
<p>Mr. Henderson expressed concern about the timing of
Polaroid's introduction of a new line of film and said he
plans to lower his earnings estimates for 1990 to about $2.50
to $2.55 a share from $2.75 and for 1991 to $3.10 to $3.15 a
share from $3.25.</p>
<p>"My basic concern is, in order for them to make their
second-half numbers, they need to introduce the new Hybrid IV
instant film early enough to start ramping it up in the third
quarter to be able to fill the shelves at Christmas," Mr.
Henderson said. Instead, he said, the company is suggesting
that the product won't be available in the third quarter and
will only be available in limited volume in the fourth
quarter.</p>
<p>I. MacAllister Booth, Polaroid's chairman and chief
executive, said the company decided to lower its own
expectations after reviewing general world-wide economic
conditions. "In light of this changing climate, we have
lowered our expectations for the year." He added, however,
that the company expects moderate growth in both sales and
operating profit in 1990.</p>
