	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO (AP) -- Yamaichi Securities Co. of Japan said it
faces a $24 million loss in connection with a bankruptcy
filing last month by one customer, an institutional investor.
   Yamaichi, on orders in February from the customer, a
company that operates coffee shops, bought three million, or
one-seventh, of the shares outstanding of Nippon Seisen, an
Osaka wire maker, for about $44 million for delivery in four
days. Yamaichi was to get a $70,520 commission, but the
customer "failed to settle the transaction and went bankrupt
on March 30," Yamaichi said. Meanwhile, Nippon Seisen shares
dived to $6.54 Tuesday from $14.65 in February, amid the
Tokyo market's plunge.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>If negotiations for remedy fail, Yamaichi said, it may go
to court, citing possible manipulation, the illegal
depressing or raising of prices artificially so they don't
represent true value, accomplished by creating an appearance
of active buying or selling, either alone or with others.</p>
