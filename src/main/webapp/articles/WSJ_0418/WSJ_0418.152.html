	<p class="article-leader">BCE Inc., a Montreal-based telecommunications,
manufacturing, financial services and energy concern, said it
seized control of about 13.5% of the common shares of SHL
Systemhouse Inc., an Ottawa comuter systems-integration
concern, from Kinburn Technology Corp.
   Kinburn still owns the 5.1 million SHL shares, a BCE
official said, but BCE now holds the right to vote them. BCE
owns an additional 12.4% of SHL common. BCE took control of
the shares after Kinburn's parent, Kinburn Corp., an
Ottawa-based holding company, failed to pay back loans of
about 400 million Canadian dollars (US$342.4 million) made by
BCE to Kinburn. The shares were pledged as collateral against
the loans, which fell due April 9. BCE said it took control
to position itself for maximum value from the loans.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>BCE said shares held by Kinburn in a number of companies,
including an additional 30% of SHL, also are pledged against
the loans. BCE said its rights over this additional
collateral are junior to those of a banking syndicate led by
Royal Bank of Canada, which has about C$350 million in
past-due loans to Kinburn.</p>
