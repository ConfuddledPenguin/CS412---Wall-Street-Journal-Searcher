	<p class="article-leader">The art community, busy denouncing Cincinnati for trying
to shut down an exhibit of Robert Mapplethorpe's photographs,
should be alerted to a bill soon to be introduced in
Congress. If the measure becomes law the federal government
will have the power to seize and destroy artworks that are
not within the act's definition of art. Yet it is unlikely
that many artists will complain about the bill, let alone
scream "Gestapo]" as they have in Ohio. After all, the
legislation is the oeuvre of a group of artists.
   The Plagiarized Art Prohibition Act, which Massachusetts
Democrat Nicholas Mavroules plans to introduce in the House
of Representatives this month, would make it illegal to
import or sell paintings or sculptures that are
"substantially similar to or imitations of another original
painting or sculpture." The bill calls not only for criminal
penalties for merchants of insufficiently original works but
also for the "forfeiture and destruction or other disposition
of all copies that work, and all implements, devices, or
equipment used in the manufacture of such copies." Vessels
and vehicles used to transport the works would be seized as
well and sold to pay, among other things, "the award of
compensation to informers."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The legislation was drawn up by the Rockport Fine Arts
Council, a group of artists who live in that village, a
resort on the north coast of Massachusetts. Cut-rate
galleries in Rockport had been selling slapdash seascapes
painted in Hong Kong for about a tenth of the price local
artists asked for their own work. That put Rockport's artists
at a competitive disadvantage: Most tourists, the artists
say, can't seem to tell the difference between their
paintings and the so-called schlock art.</p>
<p>The artists say that the Asian paintings are cranked out
on assembly lines, with one person painting the sky over and
over, another repeating the ocean and a third doing the
shore. The last person on the line signs each piece with a
generic American-sounding name. Local artists complain that
the anglicized signature give the fraudulent impression that
the paintings are made in America.</p>
<p>Members of the arts council also argue that the low-cost
galleries mislead their customers by calling the works
originals. Many of the canvasses look alike, and some
resemble well-known English and American paintings. "Original
should mean more than a trivial variation. Original shouldn't
be something that's copied over and over," says Rockport
artist Dorothy Ramsey. "We call them hand-made copies --
that's what we'd like to have them classified as."</p>
<p>Rockport passed an ordinance in 1988 requiring "original"
paintings to be "one of a kind," and prohibiting the sale of
works with fictitious signatures. The next year the arts
council lobbied the state capital, and Gov. Michael Dukakis
signed a law requiring a label reading "not an original" on
any painting not "independently created and executed and
signed by the individual artist." Now the arts council wants
to go national.</p>
<p>The draft legislation they and their lobbyists have
written for Rep. Mavroules is modeled after copyright law.
The measure would extend a kind of copyright protection to
all American works whether or not they have ever been
copyrighted. Under the legislation only original works would
be protected, and so the federal government would have to
define what is and is not an original work of art. And though
this definition is the crux of the bill, the one section left
unfinished in the draft is the article that reads "a work is
`original' if it {----}." Grace Waters, a legislative
assistant to Mr. Mavroules, says the congressman will
probably fill in the blank with the definition used in the
Massachusetts law.</p>
<p>But that definition is being challenged by owners of
import galleries in Massachusetts court as an
unconstitutional infringement on expression. The Rockport
artists respond that there is no right to copycat expression.</p>
<p>The Mavroules bill would allow galleries to sell the Asian
paintings only if customers were told of the "identity of the
creator or creators of the work," and "the existence of all
editions of the work." Yet this is information the galleries
don't have, and which would be costly -- maybe impossible --
to get.</p>
<p>The purpose of the bill, as with that of the Massachusetts
law and the Rockport ordinance, is not to promote art or even
to protect consumers (who haven't been complaining). Rather,
it is to put the cut-rate galleries out of business. But
shutting down galleries that sell schlocky art is no less
offensive than shutting down galleries that display obscene
art. And what makes the Rockport artists' ongoing attempts at
censorship all the less defensible is that they are not even
based on principle. The artists have designed law after law
simply out of their economic self-interest.</p>
<p>Jack Abady, who owns the Sea Breeze Gallery in Rockport,
thinks the artists would be better off pursuing their
economic interests in another way: "I think if they put more
energy into trying to market their own paintings, they'd be a
hell of a lot more successful businesspeople."</p>
