	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court, in a blow to employers,
upheld a National Labor Relations Board policy that a company
can't oust a striking union by hiring new workers and
asserting that the new employees don't support the union.
   The decision will make it much more difficult for a
company to refuse to bargain with a striking union by
replacing a majority of the strikers with new workers and
claiming that they oppose the union. This has been an
effective weapon for management because a company isn't
required to recognize a union that isn't supported by a
majority of its employees.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The high court, by a 5-4 vote, said the NLRB acted within
its legal authority when it decided that employers aren't
legally entitled to presume that workers hired during a
strike are opposed to being represented by the striking
union.</p>
<p>"This is a major victory for organized labor," said Marvin
Dicker, a New York lawyer who represents management in labor
cases. "This gives the union a very strong hand," he said.
"It doesn't allow the employer to eliminate the union by
replacing the workers."</p>
<p>This federal labor law issue has been hotly contested. In
the 1960s, the NLRB allowed companies to presume that
replacement workers opposed the union. In 1975, the NLRB
changed course and ruled that replacements should be presumed
to support the union.</p>
<p>In 1987, the NLRB again changed the policy after three
federal appeals courts ruled that replacement workers must be
presumed to be anti-union. Instead, the NLRB adopted a
neutral approach that the views of workers hired during a
strike can't be presumed to be either anti-union or
supportive of the union and must be determined in each
individual labor dispute.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in an opinion written by Justice Thurgood
Marshall, the high court said it will defer to the expertise
in labor policy of the NLRB. The court said the NLRB isn't
required to let employers presume that strike replacement
workers oppose the union. The NLRB could change its policy
again, but that doesn't seem imminent.</p>
<p>The ruling means employers will have to find a way to
prove that newly hired replacement workers oppose union
representation. But that won't be easy for employers to do.
Another NLRB rule bars an employer from polling its employees
about union support until the employer has evidence that the
union has lost majority support.</p>
<p>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist joined the majority
yesterday. But he wrote a separate opinion to express
"considerable doubt" about whether the NLRB can require
employers to prove the views of strike replacement workers
yet deny the employers the right to poll those workers.</p>
<p>That issue is likely to arise in a future case.
"Employers' next recourse is to challenge the no-polling
rule," said Mona Zeiberg of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce
National Litigation Center.</p>
<p>Justices William J. Brennan Jr., Byron R. White and John
Paul Stevens voted in the majority. Justices Harry A.
Blackmun, Antonin Scalia, Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M.
Kennedy dissented yesterday.</p>
<p>The high court ruling was a defeat for Curtin Matheson
Scientific Inc., a Fisons PLC unit. The company, which sells
laboratory instruments in Houston, was struck by its union in
1979. The company hired new workers and refused to negotiate
with the union. The NLRB ruled that the company had acted
improperly; but a federal appeals court in New Orleans ruled
in 1988 that the company acted legally in NLRB vs. Curtin
Matheson Scientific Inc.</p>
