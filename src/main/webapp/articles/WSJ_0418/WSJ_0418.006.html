	<p class="article-leader">WARREN, N.J. -- Immunomedics Inc. and Johnson & Johnson
agreed to terminate their research relationship, and
Immunomedics said it is negotiating to arrange financial
support for clinical trials of its monoclonal antibody-based
products.
   Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, N.J., which had been
funding research in return for certain product rights, will
pay $2.7 million to Immunomedics for research under their
previous arrangements.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Immunomedics makes antibody-based products for detecting
and treating cancer. Johnson & Johnson, an investor in the
company in the early 1980s, sold most of its holdings in 1988
and has been cutting back on its research commitment with
Immunomedics.</p>
<p>Russell McLauchlan, president of Immunomedics, said the
company is "now free to implement our strategic plan" to
become a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company.</p>
<p>Mr. McLauchlan said the company is spending about $1.4
million a quarter, a figure it expects to continue over the
next two years.</p>
<p>The company is conducting clinical trials of a colo-rectal
cancer imaging agent and expects to begin European and Asian
clinical trials for the product soon.</p>
<p>Sales of products in its in-vitro diagnostic business rose
to $870,000 for the nine months ended March 31 from $330,000
a year earlier.</p>
