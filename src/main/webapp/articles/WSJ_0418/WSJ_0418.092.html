	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. said first-quarter
net income fell 40% to $8 million, or three cents a share,
from the year-earlier quarter when a big extraordinary gain
and other items skewed the bottling giant's results.
   The results matched estimates of many Wall Street analysts
who see slow but steady improvement at the company. Coca-Cola
Enterprises, which is 49%-owned by Coca-Cola Co., has had a
dismal earnings record in the 3 1/2 years since it was
created.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Coca-Cola Enterprises climbed 25 cents to $15.625.</p>
<p>Operating profit climbed 19% to $65 million as operating
cash flow grew 11% to $123.6 million. The latest quarter's
results included a gain of $3.7 million on the sale of the
company's food service vending operations in Memphis, Tenn.,
while the year-ago period included a gain of $11 million from
the sale of Canadian bottling operations. In the 1989 period,
the company had net of $13.5 million, or seven cents a share.</p>
<p>Volume growth, measured in case sales, was particularly
strong at 5%. Roy Burry, a senior vice president and beverage
analyst at Kidder, Peabody & Co., said the figure is probably
twice the total market growth rate in the quarter. A
Coca-Cola spokesman attributed the increase to strong
promotions and a centralization of marketing functions at
company headquarters here.</p>
<p>That growth, coupled with a moderate pricing increase of
2%, is a good sign that the bottler, which accounts for about
44% of U.S. sales of Coke products in bottles and cans, had
both engines running in the first quarter, beverage analysts
said.</p>
<p>"The ability to maintain volume increases and pricing
increases at the same time is key," said George Thompson, an
analyst with Prudential-Bache Research. "They are certainly
on the right track. People will want to see the second and
third quarters," which are historically the biggest for the
soft-drink industry.</p>
<p>The company spokesman noted that "the seven cents a share
last year was entirely from things other than operations,
whereas this year at least two cents was from operations."</p>
<p>Mr. Burry at Kidder Peabody, who had expected per-share
profit of three cents, without the one-cent gain from the
sale of operations, believes the company can still achieve
his earlier estimate of per-share profit of 45 cents in the
full year.</p>
<p>The company said the 2% unit pricing increase was nearly
enough to offset the 2.5% increase in related cost of sales
for each unit -- a continuing sanguine sign for an industry
that was pummeled by price wars in the 1980s.</p>
<p>"Things are gradually getting better," said Emanuel
Goldman, a beverage analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in San
Francisco. "It's just a slow process."</p>
<p>Revenue grew 5% to $906.4 million from $859.6 million. The
company capped the increase in selling, administrative and
general expenses at 2.2%.</p>
<p>Several analysts remarked that the latest quarter's tax
rate of 51% was surprisingly high, a result largely of the
tax attributes of selling the vending operations.</p>
