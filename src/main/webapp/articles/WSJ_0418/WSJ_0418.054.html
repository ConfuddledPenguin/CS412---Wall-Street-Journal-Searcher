	<p class="article-leader">JERUSALEM -- Vladimir Shiliar stares at the boiled egg,
horseradish and shankbone on the plate in front of him. It is
the first time the 32-year-old has seen the symbolic foods by
which Jews everywhere celebrate Passover, the festival of
their liberation from the Pharoah's Egypt. In a thick Russian
accent, Mr. Shiliar struggles with the Hebrew recited at the
feast. "Last year we were slaves," he reads. "This year we
are free."
   Last year, Mr. Shiliar was in Leningrad, where his only
contact with his Jewish heritage was the designation "Jew"
inscribed on his identity papers. In February, he arrived in
Israel on one of the crowded night flights that are
disgorging fatigued and disoriented immigrants at a rate of
more than 200 a day.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Israeli planners say that by summer, a million Soviet Jews
will have requested exit visas. Now that the U.S. no longer
views all Soviet Jews as political refugees, and has limited
the number it accepts, the vast majority are destined for
Israel. The numbers are stunning: Between 1980 and 1988, only
15,752 Jews arrived in Israel from the Soviet Union. But when
emigration rules were relaxed, the flood began. In the first
three months of this year more than 17,000 arrived. In a
single 24-hour period last week, 1,000 landed.</p>
<p>Such a huge migration -- Israel's total population is just
4.4 million -- could change the face of the Jewish state.
"The future of Israel, perhaps all the future of the Zionist
ideal, depends on this," says Natan Sharansky, the former
Soviet dissident who now heads a lobby group for new
immigrants in Israel.</p>
<p>A look at the Russians who have arrived so far suggests a
future Israel enriched by talent and technical skill,
confronted by economic challenges -- and moving dramatically
to the political right.</p>
<p>The newcomers are suspicious of socialism and fearful of
the echoes of anti-Semitism they hear from Arabs opposed to
their immigration. Since they are immediately eligible to
vote, their ballots at the next election could well give
right-wing parties the edge they need to end Israel's
political equipoise.</p>
<p>Their presence is already being felt. On most Fridays for
the past two years, Ruth Barkai, a kibbutz-born Israeli, has
donned black clothing as a symbol of mourning and stood in a
vigil protesting the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. Her group, Women in Black, is accustomed to abuse from
Israelis opposed to their dovish stance. But she says she has
been disturbed lately by the number of Russians heckling her.
"Some of them can't even speak Hebrew yet," she says. "It
really bothers me that these people, who care so much about
human rights in the Soviet Union, seem to forget what a human
right is the minute they set foot in Israel."</p>
<p>Leonid Kelbert explains why that might seem so. The
45-year-old has already voted once, in the December 1988
election soon after his arrival from Leningrad. He chose
Moledet, one of the small right-wing parties that advocates
expelling Arabs from Israeli-occupied lands. "I wanted this
option to be part of the political reality, to put pressure
on the Arabs as they apply pressure to us," Mr. Kelbert says.
He was an award-winning documentary maker in the Soviet
Union, but he once was jailed there for 15 days on an assault
charge that he says was trumped up because he was staging
plays on Jewish themes. He contends "Arab petrodollars"
subsidize anti-Semitic groups in the U.S.S.R.</p>
<p>Among Russian immigrants to Israel, the Israeli Labor
Party leader, Shimon Peres, "is absolutely unpopular," Mr.
Kelbert says. "Russians have experience of real socialism.
They know its dishonest games. For someone from the West, my
approach seems a little bit hard and quite unattractive, but
someone from my background has no illusions about the world,
about Arabs. That's why we don't support Peres, who would
sell this country for two extra American smiles."</p>
<p>Labor supporters aren't particularly worried about such
comments, saying most of the new immigrants aren't
ideologues. "They're urban, middle-class people, many of whom
would probably have gone to America," says Shlomo Avineri, a
political scientist at Hebrew University. A study a few years
ago showed that Soviet Jews who arrived with distinctly
rightist views had changed within two or three years to
mirror the voting pattern of Israel as a whole. "There's a
process of socialization," Mr. Avineri says.</p>
<p>For now, however, many newcomers are expressing opinions
that echo Mr. Kelbert's. "This land wasn't a gift from anyone
-- we've been through war to get it," says Alex Rabin, a
24-year-old engineering student in Haifa who arrived a year
ago. "There are Arabs living in Haifa, so why can't I settle
on the West Bank?"</p>
<p>Kira Netdov, 36, and her brother Misha, 29, already have.
The two decided to leave the Soviet Union about a year ago,
and they arrived last month. "We had no good information
about Israel, not a single word," says Ms. Netdov. "All we
ever saw on television was shootings, killings, West Bank,
Gaza, Gaza, West Bank." Inclined to distrust the Soviet
media, and hearing positive reports from returning tourists,
the Netdovs came anyway.</p>
<p>Now, stirring cabbage in his bare apartment in the West
Bank town of Ariel, where he and his sister joined some 60
families newly arrived from the Soviet Union, Misha Netdov
stumbles over an unfamiliar English word. "Obstacles," chimes
in Kira, whose English is better. "We have learned from the
media that we are `obstacles to peace,'" she says, quoting
the official U.S. view of Israeli settlements in the occupied
lands. "But why?" She gestures out the window to the stony
hillsides. "There are empty mountains all around us here, and
this mountain was empty before the Jews came. Where are the
Arab houses, the villages that we are crowding out? Where is
the problem?"</p>
<p>To Samir Qumsieh, a Palestinian deportee, the problem is
all too clear. Mr. Qumsieh was 23 years old when he was
expelled from the West Bank and forced to walk nine hours
across the desert into Jordan. Now a successful businessman
in Kuwait, he hasn't seen his home in 18 years. In February,
Mr. Qumsieh picked up a newspaper and found a picture of a
smiling Soviet family, happily moving into their new West
Bank apartment. "Believe me, I felt real pain about it," says
Mr. Qumsieh, who says he was deported after refusing to
provide information to Israeli security police. (Israel
declines to comment on individual security cases.) "Why
should they be able to settle there when I am banned from
even visiting the land of my birth?"</p>
<p>Like most Palestinians, Mr. Qumsieh isn't much comforted
by the fact that, with the exception of suburbs built by
Israelis on annexed land in Arab East Jerusalem, few Soviet
Jews are choosing to settle in the occupied territories.
Although exact numbers aren't available, immigration
officials estimate that only about 1% of the newcomers have
so far moved to the outlying settlements. Most have
aspirations for professional employment that can only be
satisfied in large cities such as Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and
Haifa.</p>
<p>Though the immigrants bring a wealth of talent -- almost a
quarter hold qualifications as engineers, scientists or
professionals -- many have skills too highly specialized to
fit easily into Israel's much smaller labor market. One new
arrival, Simon Jakubovitch, has two qualifications: as a
mining engineer and an ice-hockey teacher. Neither skill is
likely to be much use in Israel, which doesn't play ice
hockey and hasn't done much mining since King Solomon's day.</p>
<p>Jews are permitted to leave the Soviet Union with little
cash and few belongings. Israeli government subsidies and
Jewish-community donations pay allowances for food and
housing, and the government also provides mortgages. But
finding the capital to start a business in Israel remains
extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Mr. Shiliar, the Leningrad immigrant learning the words of
his first Passover, faces this problem. In the Soviet Union,
he worked as a fencing instructor. He would like to give
Israeli youngsters lessons in the foil and epee, "but it
costs much money to start such a school," he says with a
sigh.</p>
<p>Leonid Kelbert's wife, Masha, a forensic biologist with 15
years' experience, soon realized she wouldn't find work in
her specialty -- analyzing traces of blood and tissue at
crime scenes. "We had 24 forensic biologists just for the
city of Leningrad," she says. "Here, there are only six for
all of Israel." Finally, she found a job doing lab work in
endocrinology. "On March 15, they fired me," she said. "It is
a typical new-immigrant problem: Because I was the last
hired, when cutbacks came I was the first fired."</p>
<p>The Kelberts are determined to remain in Israel, whatever
the hardships, but many of their friends don't have the same
commitment. One, an academic and poet, is leaving with his
family for London to take up a position with the British
Broadcasting Corp. In Israel he had to eke out his income as
a building guard. Another friend, Yuri Vitenson, visiting the
Kelberts on the Jewish sabbath, is quick to ask an overseas
guest about opportunities for musicians abroad. The
51-year-old violinist was a professor at Tashkent
Conservatory of Music. In Israel four months, he is
discouraged about his prospects. Living at a center for new
immigrants some 30 miles out of Jerusalem, he also is
battling cultural isolation.</p>
<p>Housing the new immigrants is a challenge the Israeli
government hasn't yet faced. Even though large numbers of
Soviet Jews began arriving a full year ago, by March the
government had yet to break ground on even one of its planned
new housing units. As a result, rents are soaring, with some
landlords asking tenants for increases of as much as 40%.</p>
<p>Such rises are an intolerable burden to many Israelis
already struggling on low incomes. And, not surprisingly,
there is some discontent.</p>
<p>Raanana, a coastal town near Tel Aviv, has housed 200
Soviet families, greeting newcomers at the airport, finding
them apartments and even providing a cake as a welcome to
their new home. But the mayor, Zeev Bielski, says some of the
poorer residents of the town complained, "saying you give
them cake, you give them a fridge, what about us?" So he has
started a program to channel funds to poorer residents as
well as to newcomers.</p>
<p>At the Technion in Haifa, Gad Eilam, the dean of students,
wrestles with a similar quandary. As Israel's foremost
science and engineering school, the Technion expects to play
a key role in fitting the huge numbers of technically skilled
Soviets into the Israeli economy. But the institution needs
funds to build dormitories, add teaching positions and hire
the influx of gifted researchers. At the same time, the needs
of native-born Israelis can't be neglected. "When my son gets
out of the army in three years I don't want to have to look
him in the eye and say `Sorry, there's no place for you
because we gave it to a Soviet immigrant,'" says Mr. Eilam.</p>
<p>Despite all the difficulties, many Soviets are finding
great pleasures in their new home. While an Israeli
department store isn't Bloomingdale's, it is a far cry from
the ill-stocked drabness of Soviet shopping. Anna Gurevich, a
23-year-old student, is both delighted and baffled by all the
consumer choices. "All these banks," she says, bemusedly
listing them: "Bank Hapoalim, Discount Bank, Bank Leumi --
how does anyone ever decide on one?"</p>
<p>Many newcomers also are finding pleasure in exploring
their religious heritage. "The word `Jew' is like `pig' to
Russian ears -- they try not to pronounce it," says Mikail
Tuvin, a 33-year-old organic chemist. He grew up in Moscow
knowing nothing about his faith except that Jews "cut the
penises of their boys and in spring they bake matzoh" --
unleavened bread. Since coming to Israel, Mr. Tuvin has
studied in a yeshiva, or religious seminary.</p>
<p>Like most Russian Jews, Mr. Tuvin wasn't circumcised as an
infant, as Jewish tradition demands. He had the operation
before he left Moscow, performed in the kitchen of a friend's
apartment by a heart surgeon who wore both a surgical gown
and a Jewish prayer garment.</p>
<p>So many adult Soviets are asking to be circumcised that
one Jerusalem hospital performed 13 circumcisions on adults
and young boys on a recent day, as surgeons from all over
Israel gathered to learn the procedure. Religious specialists
circumcise infants, but the operation for adults is more
complicated, requiring a local anesthetic and stitches.</p>
<p>For the newest arrivals, though, realities of adjusting to
the new life are lost in the joys of first setting foot on
Israeli soil. At Lod airport, in the pre-dawn gloom, another
load of immigrants is arriving. Fifty-three-year-old Ethel
Arakian steps from the plane and, weighed down by several
bags of belongings, makes her way through the crowd. "I
wanted to come here to be with all the Jews -- I feel like
kissing the ground," she says, her broad smile revealing a
row of gold-capped teeth. Two sons and a daughter already are
in Israel; two more hope to make the trip. "Russia," she
says, "will soon be empty."</p>
