	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Del Monte Corp. agreed to sell its European
processed foods division to an investor group consisting of
the unit's management and affiliates of Charterhouse PLC, a
British merchant bank, for $375 million in cash and assumed
debt.
   The unit is part of the Del Monte foods business acquired
last Jan. 9 for $1.48 billion by Del Monte management and an
investor group led by Merrill Lynch & Co.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In recent months, the investor group has been selling off
parts of Del Monte, partly to pay down the debt incurred in
the acquisition. Hawaiian Punch was sold to Procter & Gamble
Co. for $150 million, and Del Monte's Far East business,
excluding the Philippines, was sold to Kikkoman Corp. for
$110 million.</p>
<p>In the fiscal year ended last Nov. 30, the European unit
earned $48 million on sales of $351 million.</p>
