	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court ruled unanimously that
lawsuits alleging employment discrimination in violation of
federal law may be filed in state, as well as federal,
courts.
   The decision, by a 9-0 vote, isn't likely to cause a major
change in the handling of lawsuits under Title VII of the
1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits job bias. But it may
prompt plaintiffs to move some Title VII cases to state
courts.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Last year, according to a recent federal courts study,
more than 7,500 Title VII cases were filed in federal courts.
Because the federal courts are devoting a growing percentage
of their time to drug prosecutions, many Title VII cases face
long delays and mounting legal fees. Some state court systems
also experience significant backlogs, but many states are
able to handle civil lawsuits faster than the federal courts.
In those states, filing Title VII complaints in state court
may be an attractive option.</p>
<p>The decision, written by Justice John Paul Stevens,
resolves conflicting views among five federal appeals courts.
Those in Philadelphia, San Francisco, Denver and Atlanta said
that Title VII cases must be filed in federal court.</p>
<p>The fifth case was a ruling by the federal appeals court
in Chicago upholding an award of back pay and benefits of
about $27,000 to a Chicago woman who sued Yellow Freight
System Inc. alleging sex discrimination. The lawsuit was
filed in state court; Yellow Freight moved it to federal
court and asked that it be dismissed. The company argued that
while the case was pending improperly in state court, the
legal deadline for filing in federal court had passed.</p>
<p>But a federal judge, and the appeals court, refused to
dismiss the case, ruling that the filing in state court was
proper and within the deadline. Yesterday, the Supreme Court
affirmed that ruling in Yellow Freight System Inc. vs.
Donnelly.</p>
<p>The high court ruled that a state may make the drug peyote
illegal in all circumstances, including its use as a
religious sacrament by members of the Native American Church.</p>
<p>In a 6-3 decision, the high court upheld an Oregon law
that makes peyote, an hallucinogenic drug, illegal. The
court, in an opinion written by Justice Antonin Scalia, said
the First Amendment guarantee of religious freedom doesn't
excuse an individual from complying with a state's valid
criminal laws. The high court noted that some states -- 11 by
one estimate -- have made an exception to their drug laws for
religious use of peyote; but the court said the First
Amendment doesn't require such an exception.</p>
<p>The Oregon Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment
rights of two workers at a private drug rehabilitation clinic
were violated. They were fired for religious use of peyote,
and were denied unemployment benefits due to their
misconduct. But the high court yesterday reversed the state
court ruling and said the workers' rights weren't violated in
Employment Division vs. Smith. Justice Harry A. Blackmun
dissented, joined by Justices Thurgood Marshall and William
J. Brennan Jr.</p>
