	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Researchers say that for the first time
they've pinpointed a specific gene that appears to greatly
increase the risk of alcoholism, a condition that afflicts 18
million Americans.
   The researchers at the University of California, Los
Angeles, and University of Texas, San Antonio, caution that
other genes probably predispose people to alcoholism and that
their findings must be repeated in a larger study before
being put to practical use to combat alcoholism.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the findings could lead within five years to the
availability of a blood test to detect the presence of genes
associated with the condition. Such tests, the scientists
say, could help divert children predisposed to alcoholism
from situations that increase the chances of becoming an
alcoholic.</p>
<p>Within the decade, the research could aid the
administration of drugs, some already available, that would
treat genetically based alcoholism by blocking the gene.
Similar drug therapies have resulted in improvements among
those suffering from schizophrenia. And in 30 to 40 years,
this type of research may help scientists who are now
conducting tests with animals to genetically rework humans,
replacing such degenerative or "bad" genes with healthy, or
"good" ones.</p>
<p>"Ultimately, the implications of using this information in
treatment are amazing," says Enoch Gordis, director of the
National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. Studies
show that alcoholism accounts for about 105,000 deaths each
year, and this year will cost the nation an estimated $136.5
billion in lost employment, reduced productivity and
health-care costs.</p>
<p>"The chances are very good that other genes and
environmental factors are involved in alcoholism," says
Ernest P. Noble, co-author of the study and director of
UCLA's Alcohol Research Center. "But this gene is obviously
very important."</p>
<p>In the study, published today in the Journal of the
American Medical Association, researchers report finding a
link between the presence of the receptor gene for dopamine
(a neurotransmitter in the brain associated with
pleasure-seeking behaviors) and alcoholism. In the
constellation of some 100,000 genes in the human body, the
researchers say that of individuals with this gene, 77% were
alcoholics. Only 28% of those without the gene were
alcoholics. The researchers estimate that a quarter of
Americans have the particular receptor gene they linked to
alcoholism.</p>
<p>Dr. Noble says the research more firmly establishes
alcoholism as a disease, and adds to evidence that genetic
factors are as important as environmental factors in
predisposing people to the disease.</p>
<p>Dr. Gordis says the federal government's own $25 million
five-year continuing effort to find genes linked to
alcoholism may well buttress the study's findings. The
UCLA-Texas study will also add to the broader genetic
knowledge that is accumulating in the rush to identify genes
that predispose one to cancer, depression, even criminal
activity.</p>
<p>"We are finding the genetic determinants for many
diseases. With this knowledge, we can prevent the propagation
of disease," says Daniel Flavin, the medical and scientific
director for the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug
Dependence, a nonprofit educational and advocacy group.</p>
<p>Alcoholism's hereditary ties have long been suspected,
because alcoholism often runs in families. For much of this
century, however, environmental factors have been considered
at least as important in determining the disease, says Donald
W. Goodwin, chair of psychiatry at the University of Kansas
School of Medicine. "Hitler made heredity a tainted word," he
says, citing public revulsion over the genetic research done
on humans in Germany.</p>
<p>Such environmental factors as the stress of financial or
other personal problems are thought to play a significant
role in the disease, and researchers note that those without
any genetic disposition can become alcoholics. The
environmental argument is bolstered by the few alcohol-abuse
problems experienced among groups, including the Amish and
Mormons, whose upbringing discourages alcohol use. Others
note that alcoholism is five to six times more common in men
than women, which suggests environment-related factors in a
society that has been more tolerant of men drinking.</p>
<p>In the past 20 years, however, the evidence of heavy
genetic influence in alcoholism has mounted. A Swedish study
of 1,775 adoptees found that children born of alcoholics, but
adopted by nonalcoholics, nonetheless were six times more
likely than the general population to develop the disease.
Similar Danish and U.S. studies using twins and adoptees have
found that children of alcoholics have four times the risk of
developing the disease compared with children of
nonalcoholics.</p>
<p>Researchers have also shown that members of
alcoholism-prone families exhibit different brain waves. They
have even categorized types of alcoholics -- some in which
genetics, rather than environment, plays a preponderant role
and results in the early onset of the disease and more
anti-social behavior.</p>
<p>But researchers have had a tougher time demonstrating
specific molecular genetic causes for alcoholism.</p>
<p>The UCLA-Texas researchers say they focused on one gene
because it has been suspected of playing a role in
schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, drug abuse and cocaine
addiction. Studies culminating in 1988 showed that more rats
with the receptor gene tended to drink heavily. The new study
looked at eight other genes thought to be associated with
alcoholism, but found no significant correlation. The 77%
correlation with the one gene was striking because
alcoholism, like cancer, comes in multiple forms.</p>
<p>Some genetic experts, nonetheless, greet the findings with
skepticism, cautioning that it's difficult to replicate
studies associating genes with disorders, such as manic
depression and schizophrenia. The UCLA-Texas study, they
note, used only 70 human cadavers.</p>
<p>David Comings, director of the Department of Medical
Genetics at City of Hope Medical Center in Duarte, Calif.,
says that after a specific type of genetic mutation linked to
cystic fibrosis was found in 70% of subjects, the American
Society of Human Genetics deemed that percentage too low to
establish the mutation as a predictor of that disease. "After
all, a 50-50 chance is random," he says. "There might be
another gene that is much more important than this one." He
notes that researchers trying to block this particular
receptor gene with drugs have seen little effect in treating
alcoholics.</p>
<p>And scientists say that unlike genetic diseases such as
Huntington's chorea or cystic fibrosis, for which one gene is
thought to be the cause, alcoholism is considered to be tied
to several genes. That means no one genetic marker can tag
all individuals at risk and other genes must still be
identified and studied.</p>
<p>Still, says Dr. Goodwin of the University of Kansas, "If
this is confirmed, then you have something very important. .
. . You could have a high degree of predictability of who
will become an alcoholic."</p>
<p>More immediately, the estimated $4 billion-a-year alcohol
treatment industry hopes the study will help convince more
alcoholics that theirs is a disease requiring medical care.
"Most families still don't really believe this is a disease.
They feel ashamed and embarrassed by it," says Frank Picard,
who counsels Portland, Ore., alcoholics on getting treatment.
"This will help them see alcoholism as a health problem. It
will help them get help."</p>
