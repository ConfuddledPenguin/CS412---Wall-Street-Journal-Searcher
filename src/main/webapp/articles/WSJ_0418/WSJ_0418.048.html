	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- California leads a list of potentially risky
real estate markets identified by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. as part of its effort to help lenders and
regulators sidestep future trouble spots.
   The ranking of 40 real estate markets represents the
FDIC's first attempt to identify areas where office vacancy
rates and construction rates are rising, while office
employment is declining.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Six California cities fell within the top 25 markets with
higher-than-average vacancy and construction rates and
lower-than-average employment rates. Anaheim was ranked third
overall, and Sacramento was 24th on the list. In between were
San Jose, Los Angeles, Riverside and San Diego.</p>
<p>At the top of the FDIC's list were Phoenix, Ariz., and
Nashville, Tenn. Houston is ranked at the bottom of the list,
indicating few office construction starts, a declining
vacancy rate and growth in office employment.</p>
<p>FDIC Chairman William Seidman, who released the study here
yesterday, cautioned that a market's ranking doesn't signify
it is headed for a real estate crash.</p>
