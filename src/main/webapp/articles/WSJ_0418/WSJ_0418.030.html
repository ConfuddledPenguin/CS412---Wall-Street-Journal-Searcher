	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- French consumer prices in March rose a
provisional 0.3% from February and 3.4% from a year earlier,
the National Statistics Institute said.
   The result is at the high end of Paris market economists'
forecasts of a 0.2% to 0.3% rise, and represents a moderate
acceleration of France's monthly price growth, which was 0.2%
in February. The March figure, though, leaves year-to-year
price growth unchanged since the beginning of the year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>If the provisional March result is confirmed when the
institute publishes its definitive data on April 27, this
would put the index -- the year 1980 equals 100 -- at 181.6
or 181.7, up from 181.1 in February and 175.7 in March 1989.</p>
