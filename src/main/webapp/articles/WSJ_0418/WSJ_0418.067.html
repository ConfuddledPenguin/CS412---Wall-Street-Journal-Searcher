	<p class="article-leader">In what was, in effect, a public letter of resignation
published on your March 30 editorial page, Dr. Michael Irwin,
former director of the World Bank's Health Services
Department, levels numerous charges against the bank,
depicting it as a bloated, wasteful and poorly managed
bureaucracy.
   Like Dr. Irwin, who came to the bank only a year ago from
the U.N. system, I too am a newcomer to the institution. I
joined in 1988 after 20 years in investment banking. The bank
that I have come to know, however, is a very different place
from the one that Dr. Irwin describes.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>I've found it to be a remarkably efficient institution.
Despite the complexity of its work -- promoting development
and fighting poverty in nearly 100 countries -- the bank's
administrative costs are only 0.5% of its total assets. This
is an enviably low figure -- one that any private financial
institution would be happy to have.</p>
<p>I have also found bank staff -- whether in the finance
complex, where I work, or in other units -- to be highly
qualified, experienced and dedicated. Like me, most of them
joined the bank after years in other fields of endeavor. This
applies, by the way, to the bank's corps of senior managers,
most of whom were not "cloned" within the institution (as Dr.
Irwin implies), but joined after distinguished careers
elsewhere. A vivid example of this fact is that of the bank
group's top seven officers, six have extensive non-bank
experience. These include its president, Barber Conable, the
senior officers in lending, finance and legal affairs as well
as the executive vice presidents of IFC and MIGA.</p>
<p>In his piece, Dr. Irwin touches upon salaries. The bank
must be able to attract high-caliber staff members in order
to discharge its mission. But these salaries are hardly
exorbitant, and many staff members, myself included, have had
to take pay cuts when they joined the institution. Moreover,
salaries are reviewed constantly and compared periodically
with remuneration levels at public- and private-sector
institutions in North America and Europe and are adjusted in
line with such salaries.</p>
<p>Is the bank perfect? Of course not. It has shortcomings
like any other institution. But in my two years here I have
been struck by its efficiency, by the professionalism and
motivation of its staff and by its willingness to examine and
renew itself periodically from within. In these important
regards, I have not found it wanting in comparison with the
private sector.</p>
<p>Dr. Irwin has a different perception of the bank. He is
certainly entitled to it. I cannot help but believe, however,
that his views would have been more positive if he had worked
at the institution longer and if he had been in closer
contact with those at the bank who are engaged in its
day-to-day work.</p>

<p>---</p>
<p>While Dr. Irwin criticized the World Bank's bureaucracy, I
found refreshing the commitment by its officers and managers
to their work and the alacrity with which they performed it,
especially when compared with the "modus operandi" of the
private sector. And this despite the reorganization in
progress as mentioned by Dr. Irwin. In fact, nowhere in
Washington did I find as much receptivity to ideas as at the
World Bank. My encounter with the bank brought me in contact
with new financial instruments and programs designed to
anticipate changing global economic and political
relationships such as in Eastern Europe and Asia; many of
these efforts were at the cutting edge of environmental,
health, nutrition and human-rights concerns.</p>
<p>Because the bank's effectiveness rests largely on the
vitality and cooperation of its employees, it is in part a
living testimony to its own purposes: Few institutions whose
makeup comprises as much cultural diversity and intellectual
capacity can boast of as many accomplishments (including the
United Nations, which Dr. Irwin draws upon for comparison).</p>
<p>Some of Dr. Irwin's points may be well taken, yet they are
devoid of appreciation for the ideals that must have inspired
him to join the bank in the first place. It is unfortunate
his criticism seemed to be sour grapes. One must wonder how
much he tried to overcome frustrations during his tenure. As
W.B. Yeats said: "Joy is the will which labours, Which
overcomes obstacles, Which knows triumph."</p>
