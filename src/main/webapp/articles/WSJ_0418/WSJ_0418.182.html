	<p class="article-leader">We all get a kick out of talking about the CEO's pay. Is
he worth it? How did the board arrive at that figure? And how
about that bonus?
   It's all fascinating -- and great fun. Unless, that is,
you're a CEO. Then you refuse to talk about your pay. It's
too personal. It's outside your control. No matter what you
say, employees will resent you.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>To get a chief executive's perspective, The Wall Street
Journal asked dozens of current and former chief executives
to discuss the issue. Three agreed: Ward Smith, current chief
executive of Nacco Industries Inc., Donald Frey, former chief
executive of Bell & Howell Co., and Donald Burr, founder and
former chief executive of People Express. What follow are
excerpts from their discussion.</p>
<p>Excesses of the '80s</p>
<p>DONALD BURR: In the 1980s, you had to make $10 million,
and if you didn't make $10 million, you were a sap. Greed
became OK. Look at Malcolm Forbes: Live it to the fullest. It
began to get infectious. You could see it happening year by
year. It became an ethic that if John got it, I'm sort of a
wimp if I didn't get it.</p>
<p>In the country-club kind of culture of the early '80s, the
rate of compensation for the CEO was one of the things that
people measured themselves by. You've heard money's not
important, but it's the bottom-line comparison. It's how good
am I against the other guy. And you get to be a CEO and you
look around and say, hell, I'm worth it.</p>
<p>WARD SMITH: The numbers got so big in the 1980s that they
became attention-getting events.</p>
<p>Then there was proxy-statement competition. You are
comparing yourself to others all the time. That's human
nature. What {the CEO says} is that if a marketplace values a
person's contribution to an organization of similar
characteristics at dollars X, why shouldn't I be valued in
pretty much the same way? It may not be a valid way to look
at it, but it is the way people look at it.</p>
<p>How Pay Is Set</p>
<p>DONALD FREY: There's a ratchet effect. The compensation
committee calls in a compensation company to do a study {on
what to pay the chief executive}. It's usually by the size of
the company, and they tell you the range for the competitive
salary. If the range is $450,000 to $650,000, you don't start
the CEO at the junior level and have him work up. It doesn't
work that way. So that tends to set a floor and you ratchet
up from there. Immediately you've biased the sample upwards.</p>
<p>You don't sit in a board meeting and say to the CEO, "I
don't like what you are doing with this company,"
particularly if he's in the room. That's why you can't find a
correlation with CEO pay and performance.</p>
<p>It's the dynamic within the meeting. If you are a CEO, you
can co-opt the issues. There are, let's say, 5,000 names of
people in the Fortune 500 boards. It's a club. They either
know each other, or they know of each other, or they are
there because of a friendship or somebody else recommended
them. And you rarely tell the CEO that he is full of it. You
don't rock the boat.</p>
<p>It's like that on board after board.</p>
<p>BURR: He's describing what I would say is more historical
than what's happening today. I think it's something I saw 20
years ago.</p>
<p>SMITH: There was an ethic that made that the norm. And
believe me, the potential for mischief is still enormous
today, including for compensation committees to behave as if
they are the handmaidens of the CEOS. {When earnings go down}
you can still stick yourself into board meetings and hear the
argument that it was exogenous factors that caused the
decline. The job was harder. The CEO comes in and says, "It
wasn't something I did."</p>
<p>And the boards are sympathetic. Or some boards. I work for
a family-dominated company, and compensation-committee
meetings aren't rubber stamps. They know it's their money
being delivered.</p>
<p>BURR: How the hell can you ask an engineer to really get
down and save that last penny when he knows you flew in a $20
million corporate jet? It's up to management to set an
example.</p>
<p>SMITH: There was a story of a guy who flew his dog in a G4
corporate jet. That's criminal. It breeds contempt not only
for the company but for the system, up and down the line.
People aren't of strong moral fiber. They can't resist the
pressure. If you create an atmosphere in which the G4 is an
exemplar, you are creating an atmosphere that encourages the
same sort of behavior by others on a different scale. The
point is that the atmosphere at the top will dictate the
atmosphere throughout the institution.</p>
<p>BURR: The exciting thing is that leaders are really
beginning to understand at all levels how tremendously
motivational compensation is. And how it ties into the fiber
of people's lives and how important it is to their sense of
self-esteem. Not in the bad sense, not in the sense of greed.</p>
<p>When you see a really committed team work, there's just
nothing they can't do. But you can't have, "Oh, yes, I
believe in motherhood, but you have to work for nothing."</p>
<p>Because work is where they want to be. They don't want to
go home at 3:15. They want to be there until midnight. That's
what they really want. But if you take it out of them, if you
take away their freedom and screw them around, they'll leave
at 3:15.</p>
<p>FREY: There's fear and terror out there. A watershed event
was the two public pension-fund managers who wrote letters to
the GM board {complaining about management performance.} Now
if there's one thing a director hates, it's fear of getting
sued.</p>
<p>The excesses of the 1980s are passing. I think the norm is
shifting because of the excesses of the LBOS, the spread
sheets and the red suspenders. That's history. What will
replace it is the proxy fight. That's the cutting edge. That
is the retribution. It's the old-fashioned structural
approach: Throw the bastards out.</p>
<p>SMITH: Increasingly the people care. My tummy tells me
that we are sending out three times as many proxies as ever.</p>
<p>There's been an enormous amount of recent publicity given
to outrageous compensation. One of the components of the
valuation of the company is what are the managers like and
are they being paid reasonably. The Drexel "bye-bye" packages
are staggering -- that someone will get a bonus for helping a
company down the chute. That's outrageous] That will cause a
structural change.</p>
<p>BURR: I think the real constituency is middle management.
They are demanding of their CEOs and their boards of
directors that they put in place performance systems. Under
the Reagan era, the greed culture was OK. But the culture
shut down just that fast. And the underlying culture is the
pay-for-performance culture, the one where very bright people
migrate to companies where they are going to get fair
treatment and where they are going to get ownership. And
we're going to see the CEO being paid exactly what he should
be paid.</p>
<p>In a democracy the individual people watch the leader like
a hawk. The work force will restrain the natural greed of
CEOs and others. That natural force is more powerful than
ever because in order to compete, we have to attract the very
finest people, and the very finest people won't work for
those kinds of boards.</p>
<p>There has to be a certain legitimacy to the leader, or
sooner or later he loses credibility, gets cut off, gets
hurt, or cut down.</p>
