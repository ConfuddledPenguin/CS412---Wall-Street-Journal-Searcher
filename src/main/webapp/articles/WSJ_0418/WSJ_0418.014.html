	<p class="article-leader">HELSINKI -- Finland's inflation rate fell to 6.5% in March
from 7.4% in February and was down from 6.6% a year earlier,
the Central Statistical Office said.
   The principal reason for the easing in the consumer price
index was a slower rise in home prices, the statistical
office said.</p>

earlier this year and in 1989, the office said.</p>
