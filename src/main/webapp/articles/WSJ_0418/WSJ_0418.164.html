	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- American Express Publishing Corp., continuing
to expand its magazine properties, agreed to acquire
Southwest Media Corp., publisher of D Magazine, the city
magazine of Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas.
   American Express Publishing purchased the 15-year-old
magazine, an upscale monthly, from Southwest Media, a closely
held company whose majority owner is Ray L. Hunt. Terms
weren't disclosed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The acquisition adds another title to what has become the
country's largest owner of city-regional magazines. American
Express Publishing, a unit of American Express Co., last year
acquired Atlanta magazine, and in recent years added L.A.
Style and New York Woman magazines. The company also
publishes Travel & Leisure, Food & Wine, and Departures
magazines. D Magazine has a paid circulation of more than
100,000.</p>
<p>In the last decade, a faltering economy has led to the
closing of at least eight upscale magazines across Texas.
Thomas O. Ryder, president of American Express Publishing,
says, however, that the economy of the state has turned a
corner and is improving.</p>
<p>"The Dallas-Fort Worth area has been seriously depressed
for some years, but there are clear signs the market is on
its way back solidly," said Mr. Ryder. "We want to rebuild
with it." He pointed to a rebound in new-home sales as one
positive economic sign.</p>
<p>Mr. Hunt said he considered keeping D Magazine "as a
profitable investment." But added, "in order for it to grow,
I felt it needed to become part of a larger publishing
operation."</p>
