	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stocks recovered from an early sell-off to
finish mixed on the lightest volume in about a week.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.71 to 2765.77.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers 844 to 662 on the New
York Stock Exchange. Volume on the Big Board totaled
127,990,000 shares, the lightest since April 9 when 114.9
million shares traded.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Broader averages finished lower: Standard & Poor's
500-stock index fell 0.06 to 344.68, and the New York Stock
Exchange composite index slid 0.03 to 188.91. The American
Stock Exchange Market Value index dropped 2.26 to 354.72.</p>
<p>Prices initially tumbled with the bond market on the news
that consumer prices increased more sharply than anticipated
last month. The price index rose 0.5% overall and 0.7%,
excluding food and energy prices, the most volatile
components.</p>
<p>But late stock-index arbitrage buy programs helped boost
blue-chip issues to higher levels in the final hour. (In
stock-index arbitrage, traders buy or sell stock and offset
the trade with futures or options to lock in fleeting price
differences.) Also, traders said a few institutional accounts
began shopping for stocks late in the session.</p>
<p>"There's not enough selling to kill the market, pure and
simple," said Dudley A. Eppel, head of trading at Donaldson,
Lufkin & Jenrette, who noted that would-be sellers "have had
every excuse" to dump stocks recently.</p>
<p>Today's report on the U.S. trade balance for February will
be scrutinized for signs of stronger U.S. export growth,
especially in capital goods. Many strategists believe the
strong exports will help boost stocks whose fortunes are tied
to economic growth this year.</p>
<p>NCR plummeted 5 3/8 to 65 3/8 and led the list of most
active NYSE issues, as more than 2.1 million shares changed
hands in composite trading, after the company reported a 15%
decline in first-quarter earnings from a year ago. Its net
income of 73 cents a share fell short of both analysts'
expectations and the year-earlier level.</p>
<p>Paper and forest-products stocks moved lower after
Louisiana-Pacific and Scott Paper reported first-quarter
earnings that were down from a year earlier and below market
forecasts. Louisiana-Pacific dropped 3/4 to 42 7/8, while
Scott Paper slid 1/4 to 44; Boise Cascade slid 3/4 to 38 1/8,
Champion International declined 7/8 to 27 7/8, Kimberly-Clark
fell 5/8 to 67 3/4 and Weyerhaeuser dropped 3/4 to 25 1/8.</p>
<p>"People don't want to buy them {paper and forest-products
shares} because they don't know how far the earnings are
going to go down," said George B. Adler, an analyst at Smith
Barney, Harris Upham & Co., who added that most sectors of
the industry are likely to come under continued earnings
pressure through next year because of increases in production
capacity.</p>
<p>General Electric gained 1/8 to 66 7/8 on 1.5 million
shares. The company reported a 12% increase in first-quarter
earnings, which was in line with expectations.</p>
<p>Citicorp, which reported that first-quarter earnings fell
56% from a year earlier, rose 1/4 to 24 1/2 as 1.5 million
shares were traded. Separately, the company increased its
quarterly dividend by 9.9%, to 44.5 cents a share.</p>
<p>United Telecommunications dipped 1/4 to 39 7/8 on 1.6
million shares after posting a 40.8% increase in
first-quarter net. Also, the company said it anticipates
completing the planned purchase of the 19.9% of US Sprint it
doesn't already own from GTE by early July, at a price of
about $500 million.</p>
<p>American Express climbed 5/8 to 29 1/4, extending its
recent gains. This newspaper's "Heard on the Street" column
Tuesday noted that some analysts are hoping the company has
positioned itself for a strong performance next year by
agreeing to bolster Shearson Lehman Hutton's capital.</p>
<p>L.A. Gear jumped 2 5/8 to 39 5/8. Kidder Peabody repeated
its buy recommendation on the stock, citing evidence of
strong demand for the company's products; its price target
for the next nine to 12 months is $5 a share.</p>
<p>Columbia Gas System rose 2 7/8 to 48 7/8. Renewed
speculation that Coastal may seek to acquire the company
fueled the rally, traders said. Columbia Gas and Coastal both
declined comment on the rumors.</p>
<p>Norton fell 1/2 to 76 as a bill mandating staggered terms
for directors, which was drafted in response to the hostile
takeover offer and proxy fight for the company by BTR of
Britain, made its way through the Massachusetts Legislature.
Lawmakers predicted the measure could become law by Thursday.</p>
<p>Pep Boys-Manny, Moe & Jack advanced 1 1/4 to 13 after
outlining its operating plan for the 1991-1995 period at a
conference in Atlanta for institutional investors. President
Michael G. Leibowitz told Dow Jones Professional Investor
Report the five-year plan calls for Pep Boys "to grow at a
pretty aggressive clip with internally generated funds."</p>
<p>Vista Chemical gained 1 1/4 to 37. Bear Stearns, which had
forecast earnings of $1.15 a share for the company's fiscal
second quarter ended last month, said it now believes the
results will exceed its forecast.</p>
<p>Interlake, which had soared 84% between April 5 and
Monday, dropped 1 to 12 5/8. The earlier rise followed a
favorable article on the company in the latest issue of
Personal Finance, a biweekly market newsletter.</p>
<p>AM International slid 3/8 to 2 1/2. The company said it
expects to post a loss for its fiscal third quarter, ending
this month, and the year because of a charge to be taken as
part of a planned restructuring.</p>
<p>American Stock Exchange volume totaled 13,510,000 shares.
There were 238 issues advancing and 329 declining.</p>
<p>Turner Corp. gained 3/8 to 14 7/8. The company said it
expects to report first-quarter earnings of 35 cents a share
and that it had received a construction contract for a $95
million office building in Boston.</p>
