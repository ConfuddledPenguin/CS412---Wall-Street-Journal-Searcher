	<p class="article-leader">NEWS OF THE $260 MILLION in bonuses paid out by Drexel
Burnham as it was spiraling into insolvency has cast the
question of executive compensation in a new and refreshing
light. In a year when the firm lost $40 million, senior
executives carted off envelopes engorged with seven- and
eight-figure sums -- all for doing what even dispassionate
observers might call a dramatically terrible job.
   That sounds like a pretty good deal to me.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Payment for performance is a noble concept. But to be
grossly overpaid regardless of the result? That, my friends,
is the American dream]</p>
<p>If you, too, are inspired by this tale, you're probably in
the process of evaluating your compensation package and
asking yourself: "How much am I worth? And in spite of that,
how can I do better?"</p>
<p>To get a handle on your market value, please fill in the
following information as truthfully as possible. Remember --
your career path is at stake]</p>
<p>1) It's 7:30 am. You're at your desk, eating a dry muffin.
The phone rings. "Can you have the financial impact of the
Kotzwinkle deal in shape by 11?" asks the controller. You:</p>
<p>a) Say, "Of course, sir" and proceed creatively to crunch
numbers until they appear credible. You format them
attractively, take them to the production shop, print and
bind them by hand, and deliver them to your boss, who is kind
enough to take them to the executive suite.</p>
<p>b) Call in three subordinates, complete the task quickly,
and take the completed document over to the controller. You
schmooze for a couple of hours, accepting his thanks and
kudos with aplomb.</p>
<p>c) Say, "Sorry, Irv, I've got a full plate through the
close of business." You then accept his apologies for having
troubled you on such a busy day, and go to lunch.</p>
<p>2) How many people do you manage?</p>
<p>a) None. I listen to a lot of people and do whatever the
greatest number seem to think is advisable. Why do you ask?</p>
<p>b) I can tell just about anybody around here to do
something, with the exception of my secretary.</p>
<p>c) I don't know.</p>
<p>3) When discussing your pay, which term do you use?</p>
<p>a) Thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>b) Hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>c) Lots and lots of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>4) Which of the graphs below represents the way you spend
your average day?</p>
<p>a) Apple</p>
<p>Work                 43%</p>
<p>Friends & Family     23</p>
<p>Sleep                22</p>
<p>Commuting             7</p>
<p>Recreation            4</p>
<p>b) Meringue</p>
<p>Work                 85%</p>
<p>Sleep                15</p>
<p>c) Gourmet</p>
<p>Sleep                42%</p>
<p>Work                 17%</p>
<p>Charming Associates   8</p>
<p>Being Conveyed        8</p>
<p>5) How do you feel about your pay?</p>
<p>a) I feel like Babe Ruth -- being paid to play a game I
love].</p>
<p>b) Through my managerial excellence, this firm is
producing significantly higher revenues and increased
margins. I work hard, and there isn't a company in America
that wouldn't be lucky to have me. As for this one, they
better bump me or trade me.</p>
<p>c) I need a new boat.</p>
<p>6) Complete the following sentence: I'd like my next raise
to:</p>
<p>a) Pay for the rent increase on my apartment and enough
food to keep my wife and children happy, with perhaps a
little left over for a magazine.</p>
<p>b) Give me enough to equip my office at home with all the
latest technological miracles so I can keep in touch with my
data base while I sleep.</p>
<p>c) Buy the new boat, and probably a crew for it, too,
since I hate to sail. Oh, and one of those neat little
yachtsman's caps. I love those.</p>
<p>7) I believe that as a business person I should be
driving:</p>
<p>a) The same Volkswagen Beetle that I first drove to
college back in the 1970s. The mileage those things get is
unbelievable].</p>
<p>b) A company car with my name embossed on the transmission
and radiator fluid so pristine you could drink it with an
olive.</p>
<p>c) I'll sit in the back seat of anything with a stereo and
a footrest.</p>
<p>8) Last year, how many vacations did you take, and where
did you take them?</p>
<p>a) I took one very nice week at home, playing with my
children in the parking lot of our condo.</p>
<p>b) I never get a vacation, thank you, although I was able
to snatch a few long weekends at the company apartment six
blocks from my office.</p>
<p>c) I take five weeks, although I'm entitled to eight. But
it's so much fun sitting in my office with the door closed.
I'm looking forward to seeing how that hand-made Persian rug
will look on my newly burnished hardwood floors.</p>
<p>9) Which statement is true?</p>
<p>a) I could go on like this forever.</p>
<p>b) I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore.</p>
<p>c) I could go on like this forever.</p>
<p>The Scoring</p>
<p>OK, now we're ready to score. Give yourself one point for
every (a); two points for every (b); and three points for
every (c).</p>
<p>If you scored between nine and 12, congratulations, you
are earning exactly what you deserve. You can look forward to
your next 3% increase and all the good things it will add to
your quite satisfactory life. You possess the one thing that
money can't buy.</p>
<p>If you scored between 12 and 23, you'd better get busy. No
matter what you're hauling down, you're underpaid and you
know it. You are donating your entire life to the enterprise,
and given your justifiably high opinion of yourself and the
value of your time and talents, any remuneration is barely
worth it.</p>
<p>If your score tops 23, eat this column. A lot of people
aren't worth what they earn, but you're a master at it]</p>
<p>We who are about to work salute you]</p>
