	<p class="article-leader">It's almost Earth Day, but is this any reason to give
trees standing to sue in court?
   Environmentalists are pushing the Supreme Court toward
this choice: (1) Get ready for animal, vegetable and mineral
plaintiffs, or (2) make sure only real people with real cases
can get into court. This is no joke, at least not to legions
of "public-interest" lawyers who, with any luck, could be out
of work.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The case of Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation, which
the justices heard on Monday, began in 1985 when the
environmental group filed a brief from its Obstructionist
Lawsuit file. It sued the Interior Department for failing to
dot i's and cross t's in its plan to allow development in
parts of 180 million acres throughout 11 Western states, an
area comprising more than 7% of the country's land mass. The
environmentalists claimed the usual alleged procedural
shortcomings in environmental-impact statements, land-use
planning papers, public hearings, etc.</p>
<p>Aside from the amount of federal land at stake, what makes
this case unusual is the reason the group gave for being
entitled to sue. It relied chiefly on the complaint by one of
its members, a Peggy Peterson. She said in an affidavit that
Interior's decision to allow development on some of the 180
million acres threatened her use of land "in the vicinity of"
a two-million-acre parcel in Wyoming where 4,455 acres would
be open to mining. Her "recreational use and aesthetic
enjoyment of federal lands" was threatened.</p>
<p>So the legal issue is whether Peggy Peterson and by
extension the National Wildlife Federation had "standing" to
sue in court. The federal appeals court in Washington said
the suit could go forward even though she referred only to
use of federal land near a huge tract somewhere within which
mining might occur someday. Meanwhile, for several years of
litigation courts had an injunction against Interior plans to
deregulate the 180 million acres.</p>
<p>At Monday's hearing, at least some of the justices seemed
skeptical that the Peterson affidavit, with its reference to
"in the vicinity of" language, was enough to establish
standing. Justice Antonin Scalia asked the lawyer for the
National Wildlife Federation if the group could sue if the
affidavit complained about "allowing mining in the United
States." After all, this could conceivably interfere with
someone's enjoyment of a federal park somewhere.</p>
<p>The justices could rule on the narrow question of the
Peterson affidavit. Or they could take on the tough task of
reviewing 20 years' worth of cases on standing. There may be
several justices who agree that the key breach making
possible the activist era in the courts was this lowering of
the test for who can sue whom for what.</p>
<p>After all, judges eager to decide issues previously left
to the political branches of government first must get the
policy questions before them in a courtroom. By now, it's no
secret that federal courts have become the forum of choice
for many lobbyists, mostly liberals, who haven't found the
give and take of the political system very rewarding.</p>
<p>Indeed, the justices have so lowered the drawbridge into
court that they may have forgotten how to fill up the moat.
One sign of how hard it will be to re-establish standing as a
barrier to what has become highly political litigation is the
1973 case with the says-it-all title of U.S. v. Students
Challenging Regulatory Agency Procedures (SCRAP).</p>
<p>The justices gave standing to what essentially was a
law-school project. Five law students in Washington, D.C.,
sued against an Interstate Commerce Commission freight rate
change they said would reduce the incentive to recycle. The
justices said the students had standing because each of
SCRAP's members "breathes the air within the Washington
metropolitan area."</p>
<p>If this sounds like a trivial requirement to get into
court, at least it required that the plaintiffs have lungs.
The law reviews are full of articles these days criticizing
the "atomistic" idea that only individual human beings with
real problems should be allowed to sue in court. In 1972, the
Southern California Law Review published the classic article
along these lines, entitled "Should Trees Have Standing?
Toward Legal Rights for Natural Objects." It proposed "the
wilderness area itself as the plaintiff."</p>
<p>Absurd? Not to Justice William Douglas, who in a
dissenting opinion agreed that standing "would be simplified
and also put neatly in focus if we . . . allowed
environmental issues to be litigated . . . in the name of the
inanimate object about to be despoiled, defaced or invaded."
Other courts -- see box -- think the idea of giving trees
standing is all very amusing.</p>
<p>The big problem with the trees-have-standing approach is
the Constitution. Article III gives courts jurisdiction only
over "Cases" and "Controversies." Until recently, everyone
understood this to mean that only people with direct and
particular harm can sue. One of the best statements of this
view was in a law review article entitled "The Doctrine of
Standing as an Essential Element of the Separation of
Powers." This article criticized the result of the lowered
standing requirement as the "over-judicialization of the
process of self-governance." The author was Antonin Scalia,
then a law professor.</p>
<p>In its brief, the conservative Mountain States Legal
Foundation raised this larger separation-of-powers problem
with the case. If the National Wildlife Federation has
standing to sue and wins, "A court would have to order the
executive branch to exercise its discretion to prevent mining
in that small area of Wyoming."</p>
<p>Environmentalists have good reason to worry about
toughened standing requirements. Congress now writes vague
laws, including the new Clean Air bill, demanding "clean air"
and "clean water." Then Congress leaves it to
environmentalists to bring cases before federal judges so
that they can decide what clean means. Judges should no
longer let Congress pass the buck.</p>
<p>Put another way, who elected Peggy Peterson, the National
Wildlife Federation or for that matter the federal courts?
The Interior Department is the only politically accountable
group in this litigation. Yet hundreds of its decisions about
which land should be used for which purposes may hang in the
balance between questionably interested litigants and
activist judges.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Despite a law review article urging that trees should have
standing to sue, a Michigan court once upheld a decision
rejecting a suit for damage to a tree with this poem as the
entire opinion:</p>
<p>We thought that we would never see</p>
<p>A suit to compensate a tree.</p>
<p>A suit whose claim in tort is prest</p>
<p>Upon a mangled tree's behest;</p>
<p>A tree whose battered trunk was prest</p>
<p>Against a Chevy's crumpled crest,</p>
<p>A tree that faces each new day</p>
<p>With bark and limb in disarray;</p>
<p>A tree that may forever bear</p>
<p>A lasting need for tender care.</p>
<p>Flora lovers though we three</p>
<p>We must uphold the court's decree.</p>
