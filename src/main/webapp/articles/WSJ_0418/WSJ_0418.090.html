	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- The Chicago Mercantile Exchange said its
members approved a one-year-old proposal to broaden the
number of contracts in which brokers can't trade for their
own and customer accounts.
   The proposal to crack down on the practice known as dual
trading was proposed in April 1989 by an exchange panel after
an undercover investigation of futures trading at the Chicago
Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade surfaced in January 1989.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The practice has been widely scorned for making abuse
harder to detect. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission
wants the exchanges to experiment with prohibiting dual
trading in a few pits entirely.</p>
<p>The Chicago Merc, which opposes that measure, said
yesterday that it will ask the regulatory agency to instead
approve its member-adopted proposal.</p>
<p>The way the Chicago Merc proposal differs is that more
pits would be involved, but not all the contracts in those
pits.</p>
<p>In each pit, traders swap contracts that expire at
different months throughout the year. In the hog pit, for
example, members are currently trading contracts that expire
in eight different months.</p>
<p>Under the Chicago Merc proposal, dual trading would be
banned in contract months in which at least 10,000 contracts
on average are traded daily over a six-month period.</p>
<p>Based on that volume, the dual trading prohibition would
probably apply to the contracts that are nearing expiration
in the pits that trade futures contracts for financial and
currency instruments such as the yen and the Swiss franc.</p>
<p>But the rule probably would mean that dual trading could
continue in some lower-volume futures contracts for
commodities such as livestock.</p>
<p>The Chicago Merc said 76% of its members who voted
approved the proposal, which was also approved by its Board
of Governors in March.</p>
<p>In 1987, the Chicago Merc banned dual trading for its
most-active stock-index futures brokers.</p>
