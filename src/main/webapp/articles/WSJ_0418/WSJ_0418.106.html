	<p class="article-leader">Towns Come Around
   To Plastic Recycling</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>AFTER YEARS of slow growth, plastics recycling is becoming
a reality.</p>
<p>In 1988, only about 1% of plastics manufactured in the
U.S. were recycled, compared with 35% of newspapers and 12%
of glass containers. But in five to seven years, 25% of
plastics are expected to be recycled, says Darrell Morrow, a
researcher at Rutgers University's Center for Plastics
Recycling Research. That's important because plastics, which
now make up 7% of U.S. trash by weight, are expected to
account for 14% of America's solid waste by 2000, according
to the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
<p>The increase in plastics recycling stems largely from
consumers' growing realization that the stuff can be
recycled, Mr. Morrow says. In 1988, only three New Jersey
towns recycled plastics; now, 300 do.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the plastics industry is expanding its
recycling capacity. Wellman Inc., Shrewsbury, N.J., says it
expects within a few months to start up a pilot system to
automatically sort containers by type of plastic. Sorting,
now done by hand, is a major headache for recyclers.</p>
<p>New uses are emerging for recycled plastic as well.
Recently, Dolco Packaging Corp. of Sherman Oaks, Calif.,
received government approval to use recycled polystyrene in
egg cartons -- the first such go-ahead on recycled plastic in
food packaging.</p>
<p>Much of the progress, however, is driven by industry
investments in response to concerns about throwaway plastics.
"Ultimately, plastics recycling won't succeed unless it is
economical" without such subsidies, cautions Leslie Legg, a
spokeswoman with the National Solid Wastes Management
Association, a nonprofit group in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Studying the Climate,</p>
<p>Without Sky-High Costs</p>
<p>PILOTLESS PLANES promise to serve as "poor man's
satellites" for studying the climate.</p>
<p>The glider-like, computer-controlled planes are expected
to cruise at up to 85,000 feet and will have unprecedented
ability to collect data on atmospheric chemistry and
movement, says James Anderson, a Harvard University climate
researcher. Mr. Anderson, a co-developer in the project,
dubbed Perseus, says the aircraft will be able to stay up
longer, go higher and move over larger spaces than any
alternative, such as high-flying balloons.</p>
<p>One version may be able to go 12,000 miles on a single
jaunt, says the other partner, John Langford, co-founder of
Aurora Flight Sciences Corp. in Alexandria, Va. The planes
will employ wing, propeller and weight-reducing designs from
Daedalus, a human-powered aircraft that shattered distance
records in 1988, says Mr. Langford, who led the Daedalus
project.</p>
<p>The Perseus aircraft will be towed into the air by a
conventional airplane. Then, a battery-powered, 14-foot
propeller, which would hit the ground if spun before takeoff,
takes over.</p>
<p>Messrs. Anderson and Langford believe the planes may
provide the fastest, cheapest way to answer urgent questions
about the thinning ozone layer and the greenhouse effect. A
prototype, funded by private and federal grants, will cost
about $500,000 and lift off this year, Mr. Langford projects.
In contrast, the Bush administration has proposed spending
about $50 billion over 25 years for satellites to study the
Earth's climate.</p>
<p>It Sounds Like Rubbish,</p>
<p>But They Need Trash</p>
<p>IT'S AN ANOMALY in the annals of garbage, but a possible
trash shortage looms in Maine, causing some towns there to
put recycling plans on hold.</p>
<p>The situation stems from a decision in the early 1980s by
Portland and surrounding towns to jointly build a plant that
would burn trash to generate electricity.</p>
<p>The plant started up two years ago, but a hitch soon
appeared: When Maine's tourists go south for the winter, the
amount of trash declines more than planners had figured. So
far, that hasn't hurt the plant, which is obligated to
generate a certain amount of power under its financing terms.
But Maine towns are expanding recycling programs under a new
state law, and that could starve the incinerator for fuel.</p>
<p>So, when Portland and other towns in the Regional Waste
Systems cooperative recently were granted state money to
increase recycling, they decided not to use it, at least for
the time being. "We're not anti-recycling," says Charles
Foshay, Regional Waste's director. "But we put the expansion
{of recycling} on hold until we have a better understanding
of its impact."</p>
<p>Regional Waste, he adds, probably will ask other Maine
towns to send trash when its garbage runs low. "But," he
adds, "I don't want {garbage} barges from New York."</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>SOME conservative think tanks, brought together by the
Competitive Enterprise Institute, Washington, D.C., are
planning Earth Day events to promote "free market" solutions
to environmental problems. One idea: Increase private
ownership of elephants to help fend off poachers. . . . A
different idea comes from Earth Day Wall Street Action, a
left-leaning group that says it plans to block entrances to
the New York Stock Exchange and shut it down on Monday, April
23. The group, whose literature asserts that "Wall Street is
the center of the system responsible for the ecological
crisis," claims that hundreds are planning to participate in
the demonstration. "If they break the law, they'll be
arrested," says a New York Police Department spokesman.</p>
