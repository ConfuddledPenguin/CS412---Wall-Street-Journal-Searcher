	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Wertheim Schroder & Co. hired Alan
Hirschfield, former head of two Hollywood movie studios, as a
managing director of its Los Angeles office, in a move to
bolster its entertainment-related business.
   "The fact that they've not had a major presence on the
West Coast really opens up an opportunity for me," says Mr.
Hirschfield, 53 years old, who is seen as something of a
rainmaker for the firm's West Coast office. Mr. Hirschfield
formerly headed Columbia Pictures and later Twentieth Century
Fox Film Corp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Los Angeles office of this midsized New York
securities firm has focused on its brokerage and
institutional financial business, but now it will have a team
of three or four investment bankers to do mergers and
acquisitions and corporate-finance transactions for
entertainment companies and other concerns, Mr. Hirschfield
said.</p>
<p>The firm's media and entertainment group is headed by
Errol Cook, formerly a senior partner of the accounting firm
Arthur Young (now Ernst & Young), and includes David
Londoner, a media and entertainment analyst often quoted in
the financial press, and Herbert S. Schlosser, formerly
president and chief executive officer of General Electric
Co.'s National Broadcasting Co. Mr. Hirschfield has had a
long association with Mr. Londoner and with James A. Harmon,
Wertheim Schroder's chairman and chief executive officer.</p>
<p>Wertheim Schroder's recent entertainment work includes its
role as an adviser to the board on composer Andrew Lloyd
Webber's offer to take Really Useful Group PLC private; and
as an adviser to TVS Entertainment PLC in its attempt to sell
as much as 49% of MTM Entertainment Inc., the U.S. television
producer it acquired in 1988.</p>
<p>"Given my background first as an investment banker and
then in the last 15 to 16 years as an entertainment
executive, and many years as a financier and consultant, I
think it's a very good marriage, particularly given the kind
of commitment they've made to this West Coast office," Mr.
Hirschfield said of his joining Wertheim Schroder.</p>
<p>Mr. Hirschfield began his career at Allen & Co. in New
York, where he was an investment banker. He later became
president of what was then Columbia Pictures Industries Inc.,
now called Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc., but was
ousted in 1978 amid a bitter power struggle that centered on
the embezzlement of funds by David Begelman, a Columbia
executive.</p>
<p>In 1979, Mr. Hirschfield joined Twentieth Century Fox as
chief operating officer and vice chairman. He became chairman
in 1981, after Marvin Davis bought the studio in partnership
with commodities trader Marc Rich. Twentieth Century Fox was
later sold to Rupert Murdoch's Australia-based News Corp.</p>
<p>Mr. Hirschfield resigned from the top posts at Fox in 1984
to form an investment partnership with Mr. Davis, although
that never came to fruition. At the time, he was considered
one of the top candidates for the chairmanship of Walt Disney
Co., which was hunting for new top executives after
management was ousted in the wake of takeover threats. The
post of chairman and chief executive of Disney went to
Michael Eisner, former Paramount Pictures Corp. president.</p>
<p>In the years since his resignation from Fox, Mr.
Hirschfield has pursued various business ventures, including
an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to lead a group of investors
in buying a majority stake in Polygram Records Inc. Mr.
Hirschfield is a director of Motown Records, CPP/Belwin
Music, Wolfgang Puck Foods and Live Entertainment Inc.</p>
<p>Other high-profile additions to the Wertheim Schroder
staff in recent months include former House Democratic Whip
Tony Coelho, who became a managing director last fall. Mr.
Coelho resigned from Congress in July amid questions about a
loan for a junk-bond purchase.</p>
