	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- Sony Corp. said its decision to produce
television picture tubes in New Stanton, Pa., is the first
step in plans to invest between $500 million and $1 billion
in the U.S. in the next few years.
   The Japanese electronics concern plans to spend $300
million retooling an idled Volkswagen AG plant to produce one
million television tubes annually for its large-screen
Trinitron sets sold in the U.S. and in export markets. The
plant will have 1,000 employees within three years after
production begins in 1992.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sony said part of the additional investment will be
targeted for its television manufacturing plant in San Diego.
That plant will use more computerized manufacturing, moving
more of the labor-intensive work to facilities in Mexico,
Sony officials said.</p>
<p>Though Sony also was expected to announce plans to
assemble television sets in New Stanton, company officials
said yesterday that a decision hasn't been made on that
issue. They said the company is still considering several
locations, including the former Volkswagen plant. Sony
officials met this week with Kentucky officials to assure
them that that state was still being considered for the
television assembly plant.</p>
<p>Eventually, the site chosen for television assembly could
be home to Sony's first U.S. production of high-definition
television sets. Neil Vander Dussen, president of Sony Corp.
of America, said Sony is awaiting federal government
guidelines on the new technology, expected to be released in
1991, before deciding where to locate U.S. production.</p>
<p>In winning over Sony for its television picture-tube
plant, Pennsylvania competed with several other states,
including Kentucky and Ohio. The Pennsylvania incentive
package promises about $23.5 million in low-interest loans
for renovations and job training grants, among other things.
Kentucky apparently offered a hefty package valued at between
$30 million and $40 million, including free land and funds
for infrastructure improvements and training workers.</p>
<p>But Sony officials said they favored the New Stanton site
over others because of its proximity to interstate highways
and the availability of skilled workers.</p>
<p>Moreover, Pennsylvania agreed to waive a $40 million
mortgage owed by Volkswagen in exchange for ownership of the
West German auto maker's plant and 1,200-acre site. Sony will
pay about $21 million in lease payments for about 800 acres
of the property.</p>
