	<p class="article-leader">FLINT, Mich. -- Citizens Banking Corp. said it approved a
stock-repurchase program that permits management to acquire
as many as 200,000 shares of the company's common stock on
the open market. The company said it has 6.7 million shares
outstanding.
   This program is similar to one approved in November 1987,
under which Citizens purchased 191,700 shares at an average
price of $19 a share.</p>
