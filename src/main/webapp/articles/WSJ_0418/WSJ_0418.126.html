	<p class="article-leader">Two regional Bell operating companies reported modest
first-quarter earnings growth. Southwestern Bell Corp. said
net income increased 3.8%, reflecting strong growth in access
lines and cellular telephone customers. Ameritech Corp. said
its earnings rose less than 1% because of one-time expenses
related to work force reductions.
   St. Louis-based Southwestern Bell posted net income of
$247.8 million, or 82 cents a share, up from $238.8 million,
or 79 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue
increased 3.5% to $2.13 billion from $2.06 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Edward E. Whitacre Jr., Southwestern Bell chairman, said
cellular customers increased by 59,000, or 15.4%, and access
lines increased by 114,600, or 1%, during the first quarter.
Operating expenses rose 4.1% to $1.67 billion. Positive rate
adjustments also contributed to higher earnings, Mr. Whitacre
said.</p>
<p>Ameritech's net income grew 0.9% to $303.5 million, or
$1.13 a share, from $300.8 million, or $1.12 a share, in the
year-ago first quarter. Revenue rose 4.7% to $2.62 billion
from $2.50 billion. Expenses increased 5.6% to $2.18 billion
from $2.06 billion.</p>
<p>William L. Weiss, Ameritech chairman, said results were
affected by one-time expenses of $54 million related to work
force reductions totalling 1,265 at Illinois Bell and
Michigan Bell. Excluding one-time charges, expenses rose
3.2%. Customer access lines increased by 142,000, or 0.9%,
and cellular customers increased by 15,000, or 6.2% during
the first quarter.</p>
