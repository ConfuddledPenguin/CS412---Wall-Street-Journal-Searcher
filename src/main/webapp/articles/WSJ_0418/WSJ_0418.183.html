	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Canadian Pacific Forest Products Ltd. cut its
quarterly dividend 69% to 20 Canadian cents (17.2 U.S. cents)
from 65 Canadian cents and reported substantially lower
first-quarter earnings.
   Canadian Pacific reported a first-quarter profit of $4.8
million Canadian dollars (US$4.1 million) or 11 Canadian
cents a share, down from net income of C$65.1 million, or
C$1.48 a share, a year earlier. Sales declined 9.7% to
C$642.1 million from C$711 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While the dividend reduction was expected, analysts who
had been forecasting a 1990 net income of as much as C$3 a
share are revising their earlier estimates.</p>
<p>"Everyone is a little shell-shocked that we could be off
the mark so much," said one analyst, who added that he
expects that the company will earn more than C$1 a share this
year.</p>
<p>Canadian Pacific attributed the big earnings drop to lower
net selling prices for newsprint and lower shipment volumes
for market kraft woodpulp. Cecil Flenniken, chairman and
chief executive officer, said after the company's annual
meeting that it cut the dividend because of the poor
first-quarter results.</p>
<p>"We see how {the dividend} compares with other forest
products companies, and we seem to be completely out of line
with {them}. But because of the earnings drop, we believe we
should be a little bit more conservative with the dividend,"
Mr. Flenniken said.</p>
<p>Canadian Pacific Forest is 79.7%-owned by Canadian Pacific
Ltd., a transportation, telecommunications and real estate
conglomerate based in Montreal.</p>
<p>In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday,
Canadian Pacific closed at C$29, down C$3.50. On the New York
Stock Exchange, Canadian Pacific Ltd. closed at US$20, down
12.5 US cents from Monday.</p>
<p>Despite the company's weak earnings in the first quarter,
Mr. Flenniken, who declined to make a specific profit
forecast, said he expects that the newsprint and market pulp
markets aren't going to get worse. He said the current list
price for northern bleached softwood kraft pulp is likely to
remain at US$830 a metric ton in North America and US$840 a
metric ton in Europe despite the lower volume of shipments in
the industry. About 90% of Canadian Pacific Forest's market
pulp production consists of that premium fiber, which will
continue to be in high demand, he said. Market pulp is
woodpulp sold on the open market to producers of paper,
sanitary and other products. A metric ton equals 2,204.62
pounds.</p>
<p>On the newsprint side, Mr. Flenniken said producers don't
appear to be backing down from their previously announced
intention to raise the list price for newsprint on June 1 to
US$685 a metric ton from US$650 a metric ton. Analysts aren't
as optimistic. They don't think the newsprint price increase
will stick, and they're forecasting a drop in market pulp
prices this year.</p>
