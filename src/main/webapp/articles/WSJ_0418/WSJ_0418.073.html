	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- Charles M. Thorp III, an attorney and
grandson of the founder of one of this city's most
prestigious law firms, lived a life of moderation.
   He never drank, even at parties. His lunch was crackers
and orange juice. He seemed the soul of probity, never
billing clients for more hours than he actually worked. "If
you wanted to know an old-fashioned gentleman of the old
school," says a former associate, "that was Charlie."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But Mr. Thorp, 49 years old, had a destructive flaw. He
was addicted, his lawyer says, to speculation in put and call
options.</p>
<p>For a while he did spectacularly well. In his best year,
1985, he made $10 million. An ordinary trader might have
cashed in and retired. But Mr. Thorp, whose muted life style
never hinted at such wealth, couldn't stop trading. His luck
apparently turned against him. His total losses, according to
his attorney: $15 million to $20 million of his money, not
including $3.6 million that he misappropriated from clients'
estates and trusts. Among the victims were two nursing home
residents and a disabled man who depended on Mr. Thorp to
disburse trust payments for their care.</p>
<p>The story has stunned Pittsburgh's bluebloods and
barristers. Mr. Thorp, who is wiry and soft-spoken, grew a
beard to hide his identity at one point after the disclosures
last year. He has been disbarred. To earn money, friends say,
he has worked as a clerk at a state liquor store and has
distributed newspapers from a 1961 Chevrolet station wagon --
one of his few remaining assets. He and his wife separated
last July, and she is divorcing him. One of their four
children was forced to seek financial aid to continue at
Brown University.</p>
<p>"This thing is a total horror story," says Mr. Thorp's
lawyer, Lawrence J. O'Toole.</p>
<p>Similar tales of compulsive trading are surfacing
elsewhere in the country, says Steven Berman, a Seattle
lawyer. Commodities and options trading "are so fast that
they can be addictive, even for people who've only invested a
little," he says. In 1988, Mr. Berman won a civil suit in
federal court in Seattle on behalf of a compulsive and
heavy-losing commodities trader against Refco Inc., a large
Chicago commodities broker. The judge in the case, William L.
Dwyer, ruled that brokers bear a responsibility to stop
compulsive gamblers from trading.</p>
<p>But the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco
recently reversed the lower court's ruling. "I believe
brokers have a duty to stop people who are out of control,
but with this decision they won't have to warn these people,"
says Mr. Berman. "They can bleed people to death."</p>
<p>Mr. Thorp's attorney and officials at the Federal Bureau
of Investigation confirm that they are continuing to
investigate Mr. Thorp's activities. Some of his victims have
filed civil suits in county court here in attempts to recover
losses.</p>
<p>In depositions taken by plaintiffs' attorneys, Mr. Thorp
so far has refused to answer questions dealing with the
misappropriations, citing his Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination. Despite repeated requests, Mr. Thorp
declined to be interviewed by a reporter. But in an
extraordinary letter to the Pennsylvania Disciplinary
Counsel, the disciplinary body of the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court, which conducts disbarrment proceedings, Mr. Thorp's
attorney acknowledged his client's wrongdoing and provided
some details about the crimes. "My client in the past several
years has been involved in deceptive practices as a result of
his psychological addiction to gambling," Mr. O'Toole wrote.</p>
<p>Mr. O'Toole has hoped the admission would spare Mr. Thorp
from criminal prosecution. "Charlie could have hid in the
darkness and waited to be dragged kicking and screaming," Mr.
O'Toole says, "but he chose not to."</p>
<p>In a sense, Mr. Thorp gagged on a silver spoon. He grew up
among Pittsburgh's well-to-do, descendants of
turn-of-the-century industrial tycoons. His grandfather, in
the 1890s, helped found the law firm now known as Thorp, Reed
& Armstrong and became a millionaire through holdings in
National Steel Corp. here.</p>
<p>His lawyer father, the late Charles Monroe Thorp II,
worked for half a century at Thorp Reed. A Harvard Law
graduate, editor of the Law Review and an accomplished
pianist and composer, his father was a tough act to follow.</p>
<p>Mr. Thorp graduated from Cornell University, as did his
father, a former chairman of the school's development
committee. But the younger Mr. Thorp earned his law degree at
Duquesne University Law School here rather than at Harvard.</p>
<p>There was tragedy, too, in Mr. Thorp's life. His mother, a
heavy drinker, was kept in separate quarters from the rest of
the family and died when he was young. Both his sisters also
died young.</p>
<p>During summer breaks from college, Mr. Thorp worked as a
clerk or in the mail room at Thorp Reed. In 1964, he married
Claire Zaravich. After earning his degree at Duquesne in
1965, he joined Thorp Reed, which then had fewer than 35
lawyers.</p>
<p>Like the furniture and Oriental rugs that are passed down
from generation to generation at some law firms, Mr. Thorp
inherited some of firm's wealthiest clients -- largely at his
father's behest. He made few friends among his associates. "I
had no idea what he did," says lawyer Richard Zomnir,
formerly of Thorp Reed.</p>
<p>Mostly, he wrote wills and kept to himself. Whatever zest
he had in his life seemed to come from outside pursuits. A
nature lover, he vacationed on a 5.5-acre island on the
French River in Canada that his father gave him in 1974. With
two cabins and a boathouse, the island is accessible only by
traveling through an Indian reservation.</p>
<p>Mr. Thorp is mostly a loner, although he is known as a
fine badminton player. He was captain of the tennis team as a
student in his elite prep school, Shadyside Academy here.</p>
<p>He also is an avid jogger. On week days, he has been known
to run a six-mile course around Three Rivers Stadium, where
the Pirates and Steelers play, or up Mount Washington, the
big hill that overlooks the city.</p>
<p>But in the early 1980s he developed his greatest passion
-- riding the stock options roller coaster. "He loved to play
the options, and he tried to teach other people about the
market," says Thelma Morris, a former secretary at Thorp
Reed. He spent hours on the phone buying puts and calls and
often rushed to a broker's office to check prices.</p>
<p>For some years, he made far more in options than he ever
could have earned at Thorp Reed. There were days in which he
racked up as much as $4 million, his attorney says. In a
deposition filed in county court here, Mr. Thorp said his
specialty was gambling on the OEX 100, a Standard & Poor's
Corp. composite of prices on shares of 100 companies.</p>
<p>Hardly anyone suspected that Mr. Thorp was making so much
money. Although his family lived in a house now worth around
$1.1 million, there was nothing else ostentatious in his way
of life. "If his name hadn't been Thorp, you'd think he was a
person who didn't have a dime," says Jean McKee, another
former Thorp Reed secretary.</p>
<p>In January 1986, Mr. Thorp made a bold move, resigning
from Thorp Reed to practice law on his own. Many of his
clients followed him. Some of his friends say he left because
of a dispute over compensation. His lawyer says Thorp Reed
"can't take the position that they forced him out" -- which
might imply that the firm knew of his wrongdoing. A lawyer
representing Thorp Reed said the firm would have no comment
about Mr. Thorp.</p>
<p>Lawyers involved in suits against Mr. Thorp say they don't
expect to learn exactly how he lost his clients' money unless
criminal charges are filed.</p>
<p>In a deposition filed in county court here, Mr. Thorp said
he had accounts at Oppenheimer & Co. in New York and at the
Boston office of Bear Stearns & Co. Whitney George, the
former Oppenheimer broker with whom Mr. Thorp did business,
says Mr. Thorp opened his account there in 1981, initially to
invest in technology stocks and later shifting into options
trading. The account was never worth more than $100,000, Mr.
George says, and Mr. Thorp said in his deposition that it was
closed in 1986 or 1987.</p>
<p>Mr. Thorp's broker at Bear Stearns didn't return a
reporter's telephone calls. The broker's secretary says he is
prevented by company policy from speaking to the press.</p>
<p>In his deposition, Mr. Thorp also told how he sold or
borrowed against practically every available asset to raise
money for options speculation. For instance, he sold a
$50,000 coin collection, surrendered life insurance policies
for $10,000 in cash, and even cashed in his individual
retirement account.</p>
<p>In one suit filed here his wife asserts that she opened a
$500,000 bank account solely in her name and that six months
later her husband closed it out. Mrs. Thorp, through her
lawyer, declined to be interviewed.</p>
<p>According to suits filed against him, Mr. Thorp borrowed
heavily from Pittsburgh National Bank, a subsidiary of PNC
Financial Corp here. In 1987 and 1988 he borrowed about
$500,000 from the bank, including $200,000 ostensibly to pay
college tuition for his children. (Three of the children live
in Providence, R.I., and the youngest, 13, lives with Mrs.
Thorp.)</p>
<p>He also began dipping into nine estates and trusts he was
handling, according to his lawyer's letter, which was filed
in county court here so a trustee could be appointed to close
out Mr. Thorp's law office.</p>
<p>According to the letter, Mr. Thorp took about $1.5 million
from the estate of Elizabeth R. Solomon, who died in 1988. He
forged the executor's name on checks to divert $585,000 to
himself from a trust account, and personally cashed an estate
check for $884,000 that was intended for tax obligations.
"All of this money has been lost, and the federal estate
taxes have not been paid," the letter says.</p>
<p>"How could an old trusted friend do this? It's like being
a rape victim," says H. Alfred Solomon, executor of the
Solomon estate and a friend of Mr. Thorp since their school
days at Shadyside. Embittered, Mr. Solomon says he doesn't
believe that Mr. Thorp was a gambling addict. "No, I don't
believe that the devil made him do it," Mr. Solomon says. He
has filed suit against Mr. Thorp.</p>
<p>Mr. Thorp also obtained $400,000 in credit from Pittsburgh
National in 1987 by pledging as collateral $600,000 in
securities owned by James K. Hess, a 75-year-old retired
architect who suffered from Parkinson's disease. According to
the letter, Mr. Thorp forged Mr. Hess's name on the loan
documents. Mr. Hess filed suit against the bank, asserting
that it should have verified his signature before authorizing
the loan. The bank, however, claims that the signature wasn't
forged and that Mr. Hess owes the money plus interest.</p>
<p>According to the letter, Mr. Thorp sold other shares of
Mr. Hess's for $300,000 that he lost in the options market.
Mr. Hess has since died. His heirs, involved in the
litigation, decline to comment.</p>
<p>Richard D. Barnes, another Shadyside classmate and a
jogging partner of Mr. Thorp's, was another victim. Mr.
Barnes, according to the letter, gave Mr. Thorp a check for
$256,000 in 1989 to cover inheritance taxes. In the letter
Mr. Thorp's lawyer says this money, too, was lost in options.
Mr. Barnes declines to comment.</p>
<p>W. Howard Swogger, an old Thorp family friend and
well-known figure around Pittsburgh because of his dashing
handlebar mustache, was one of the clients who continued with
Mr. Thorp when he opened his own practice.</p>
<p>When Mr. Swogger paid a visit to his safe-deposit box at
Mellon Bank here in April 1989, Mr. Thorp's life began to
unravel.</p>
<p>Mr. Swogger discovered that $334,000 in American Telephone
and Telegraph Co. shares and other securities were missing
from his box at Mellon, a subsidiary of Mellon Bank Corp.</p>
<p>Mr. Thorp, as it turned out, had purloined the securities
to open a margin account at Dean Witter & Co. here, forged
Mr. Swogger's name on checks, and deposited the proceeds into
one of his own accounts, according to Mr. O'Toole's letter.</p>
<p>Some friends contend that Mr. Swogger confronted Mr. Thorp
about the missing securities and that as a result Mr. Thorp
began repaying some funds. Mr. Swogger has since died, and
Mr. Thorp still owes his estate $61,000, according to the
letter.</p>
<p>If any of Mr. Thorp's victims collect any money, it won't
be from him, his lawyer maintains. Some don't even want back
any cash. Bernard Gibson, of Somerset, Pa., who won a $40,000
county court judgment in connection with a loan to Mr. Thorp
that wasn't repaid, says, "I don't like the deed, but I like
the person."</p>
<p>But not everyone is so forgiving. Pittsburgh National,
hoping to recover the money it lent Mr. Thorp., is attempting
to become a party to Mrs. Thorp's divorce suit. The bank
asserts that Mr. Thorp's Canadian island, now held by Mrs.
Thorp, was fraudulently deeded to her. The island is valued
at $120,000 (Canadian).</p>
<p>Mr. O'Toole says some people also have threatened to shoot
Mr. Thorp. He says one woman who lost money to Mr. Thorp
asked to search his office drawers for any cash. "What did
she think she'd find?" he asks. "A couple of quarters?"</p>
