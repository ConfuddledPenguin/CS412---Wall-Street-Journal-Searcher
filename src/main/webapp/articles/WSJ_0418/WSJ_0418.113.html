	<p class="article-leader">REDMOND, Wash. -- Microsoft Corp.'s net income soared 83%
in the fiscal third quarter as the biggest maker of software
for personal computers continued to outperform competitors in
its industry.
   For the quarter ended March 31, Microsoft posted net of
$75.2 million, or 62 cents a share, up from $41.1 million, or
36 cents a share, a year earlier. Year-earlier per-share
earnings have been restated to reflect a 2-for-1 stock split
effective April 13, 1990. Revenue rose 58% to $310.9 million
from $197 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Net income was 24.2% of revenue and gross margins were
78.7%.</p>
<p>Microsoft's performance was slightly better than
expectations, "but it wasn't a blowout quarter," said Rick
Sherlund, an analyst at Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p>Microsoft's revenue was up only $10 million from the
quarter ended in December. Mr. Sherlund noted that Microsoft
introduced no new products in its March quarter but said he
expects the company to release four new products in the
current quarter ending in June, including a long-awaited new
version of its Windows software package. Windows, which Mr.
Sherlund said will be released on May 22, makes Microsoft's
MS-DOS, the standard software used in most personal
computers, easier to learn and more functional.</p>
<p>Microsoft cited as factors for its strong quarterly
results continued high demand for its products overseas.
Foreign sales accounted for 58% of total revenue.</p>
<p>The company also said it was helped by the growing
popularity of its word-processing applications. WordPerfect
Inc., a closely held firm in Orem, Utah, is the leader in
this software category, but "we're gaining market share,"
said a Microsoft spokesman. He declined to endorse
speculation that the company's gains come at WordPerfect's
expense.</p>
<p>Despite its rosey financial picture, Microsoft continues
to struggle with the dismal showing of a new operating system
designed to replace MS-DOS. Sales of OS/2 are poor, so
Microsoft "is now pushing Windows as the primary software for
the desktop" and not OS/2, said Timothy McCollum, an analyst
at Dean Witter Reynolds.</p>
