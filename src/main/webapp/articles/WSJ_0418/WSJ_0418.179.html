	<p class="article-leader">Maxus Energy Corp. will pay a $2.5 million fine and about
$51.5 million to clean up 26 chromium waste sites in the New
Jersey cities of Kearny and Secaucus, a spokeswoman said.
   The chemical waste resulted from operations by Diamond
Shamrock Chemical Co. many years ago.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The fine -- the largest ever paid to the state of New
Jersey for environmental violations -- is far less than the
$25 million the state once said it would seek.</p>
<p>However, the $51.5 million cleanup commitment by Maxus is
substantially larger than previous disclosures by the
company, although the outlays won't affect the company's
public projections of environmental cleanup costs for this
year and next, because most of the money will be provided in
1992 and 1993.</p>
<p>Diamond Shamrock Chemical was sold to Occidental Petroleum
Corp. in 1986 for about $910 million. Maxus, now an
independent Dallas petroleum producer, indemnified Occidental
at the time of the sale against the costs of environmental
cleanup.</p>
<p>According to a statement by New Jersey Gov. Jim Florio,
the fine and remedial work were agreed to in a pact between
Occidental's chemicals unit and the state's Department of
Environmental Protection. However, the negotiations were
undertaken by Maxus, which also will fund and oversee the
cleanup. Chromium operations in New Jersey were shuttered by
Diamond Shamrock in 1972 -- long before the sale to
Occidental.</p>
<p>The cleanup work will be financed by Maxus through a $20
million letter of credit and a $31.5 million working fund
that is to be filled over a four-year period, the company's
spokeswoman said. Payment to the fund will total $4 million
this year, $7.5 million next year, and $10 million in each of
1992 and 1993.</p>
<p>The outlays for this year and next are already accounted
for in projections by Maxus that it will spend $18.7 million
this year on environmental compliance and $23.1 million next
year.</p>
<p>However, the total cost of the plan is substantially
higher than Maxus's disclosure in its year-end financial
report that interim remedial measures at sites in Kearny and
Secaucus would cost about $6 million and that certain further
cleanup in Kearny would cost about $8 million.</p>
