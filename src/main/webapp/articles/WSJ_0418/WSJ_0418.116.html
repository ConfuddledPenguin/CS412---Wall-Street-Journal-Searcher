	<p class="article-leader">Nova Corp. of Alberta said it is weighing a possible
public offering of shares of its affiliate, Husky Oil Ltd., a
large oil and gas producer that analysts value at 1.5 billion
Canadian dollars (US$1.28 billion) or more.
   "That's a matter we're considering," said Robert Blair,
chairman and chief executive officer of Calgary-based Nova,
which owns 43% of Husky. "We've been working on it for
several months, and we'll work on it several more" months
before making a decision.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Husky, one of Canada's largest oil and gas producers, had
1989 earnings of C$24 million, on revenue of C$801 million.
Based on its cash flow-earnings plus depreciation allowances
-- last year of C$285 million and conventional industry
multiples, analysts estimated Husky's current value at
between C$1.5 billion and C$2 billion.</p>
<p>Nova's earnings have been hurt in the past year by
faltering petrochemical prices and heavy interest costs
associated with its 1988 acquisition of Polysar Energy &
Chemical Corp. Mr. Blair said Nova doesn't believe its
depressed share price reflects the value of its stake in
Husky.</p>
<p>In Toronto Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Nova shares
closed at C$7.875, about C$1 above its 52-week low and well
off its 52-week high of C$12.125.</p>
<p>Calgary-based Husky, which had 1989 reserves of about 256
million barrels of crude oil or gas liquids, and 1.6 trillion
cubic feet of natural gas, was taken private in 1986, under a
complex transaction that also left the Hong Kong investor Li
Ka Shing with a 43% stake. The purchase was one of the
largest direct investments in Canada by a Hong Kong investor.</p>
<p>The balance of Husky is owned by Toronto-based Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce, in which Mr. Li has a small
interest, and Mr. Li's son, Victor, a Canadian citizen who
spends much of his time overseeing a big family-owned real
estate project in Vancouver, British Columbia.</p>
<p>Victor Li declined to comment on whether his family would
go along with a public offering of Husky shares, or whether
it is interested in selling all or part of its stake in
Husky. He also declined to comment on reports that his father
is shifting his focus to U.S. investments.</p>
<p>Mr. Blair didn't provide details of any possible offering,
including its timing or size, and didn't say when Nova and
its partners expect to make a final decision on whether to
proceed.</p>
<p>Nova's announcement about Husky follows by less than a
month a decision by Nova to put its rubber division up for
sale. The division has assets of C$1.4 billion, and generated
operating earnings last year of C$61 million on revenue of
C$812 million. Nova said yesterday that purchase and
joint-venture agreements have been proposed so far for its
rubber business, though it didn't offer additional details.</p>
<p>Nova's willingness to consider taking Husky public didn't
come as a surprise to analysts, who for months have predicted
such a move. Richard Wyman, an analyst at Calgary-based
Peters & Co., said Husky's share price might not command the
multiple accorded other integrated oil and gas producers,
however, in view of the company's C$1.2 billion in debt. "It
would take four or five years' cash flow to retire that debt,
which, in relative terms, would make Husky a relatively
leveraged company," he said.</p>
<p>Though the Canadian government recently announced plans to
proceed later this year with an initial public offering of
Petro-Canada Inc., the country's biggest domestically owned
oil and gas producer, Mr. Wyman said he believes there would
also be strong investor interest in Husky.</p>
