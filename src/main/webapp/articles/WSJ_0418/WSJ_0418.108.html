	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Charles Keating's real clout with Congress
will be put to the test later this month as lawmakers try to
overhaul the scandal-plagued system of financing
congressional campaigns.
   The name of the disgraced Arizona savings-and-loan
executive will be especially resonant in the Senate, where
Mr. Keating's large campaign contributions and self-described
efforts to influence federal regulatory decisions sparked a
pending ethics inquiry of five senators.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The moment of truth has arrived," says Fred Wertheimer,
president of Common Cause, a citizens' lobby. "Is the Senate
going to change this money chase system, or is it going to
continue under another name?"</p>
<p>Common Cause has deluged lawmakers with postcards urging
them to "Take the Keating Test" by completely rewriting
federal campaign-finance laws to cleanse the electoral
process of special-interest money. Public Citizen, another
group active in the campaign-finance overhaul drive, is
spending $1 million on television advertising and other
programs in which the Keating scandal also will figure
prominently.</p>
<p>In addition to the seeming political windfall that Mr.
Keating has supplied campaign-finance reformers, a barrage of
other congressional ethics flaps, including the imbroglio
over ex-Speaker Jim Wright, also are fresh in the public's
mind. Yet, it's still unclear whether the accumulated weight
of these scandals is enough to force lawmakers to make
changes that are much more than cosmetic in a system that
overwhelmingly returns them to office, election after
election.</p>
<p>Almost everyone agrees that Congress will pass some form
of campaign-finance legislation this year. But the rising
costs of running political campaigns make lawmakers skittish
about turning off the spigot of special-interest money from
executives such as Mr. Keating and corporate and labor
union-sponsored political-action committees. The debate over
campaign-finance legislation comes as the cost of Senate
races has ballooned to an average of $3.6 million each and
the average cost of a House race is approaching $400,000.</p>
<p>Moreover, Democrats and Republicans are deeply divided
over core issues such as overall campaign-spending
limitations, restricting the role of political-action
committees, curbing huge "soft money" contributions that are
exempt from current federal election laws, and whether to use
public funds to help subsidize such big-ticket campaign items
as broadcast time.</p>
<p>Historically, Democrats have demanded that spending caps
be the centerpiece of any campaign-finance overhaul.
Republicans oppose spending limits, arguing that as the
minority party in Congress they must outraise and outspend
Democrats to offset the advantages of incumbency. This
partisan logjam has stalled all previous efforts to change
the campaign-finance system since Congress passed new laws in
1974 following Watergate.</p>
<p>In 1988, an impasse over spending limits provoked a
record-long filibuster led by Kentucky Republican Mitch
McConnell that killed campaign-finance legislation in the
Senate. The House, where incumbents enjoy a 99% re-election
rate under the current system, has been even more
recalcitrant about making changes.</p>
<p>This year, leaders in both chambers seem serious about
trying again for a bipartisan breakthrough. One seemed to
come in a report issued last month by an outside panel of
experts appointed by Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell
(D., Maine) and Minority Leader Robert Dole (R., Kan.). The
panel suggested a creative compromise -- an overall
campaign-spending limit based on each state's voting-age
population, with an exemption for small contributions raised
inside a senator's home state. But Democrats and Republicans
are still far apart on how small those exempted contributions
should be.</p>
<p>Stricter PAC limits are another potential minefield.
Republicans want drastic reductions in the role played by
PACs, while Democrats, many of whom receive a majority of
their contributions from PACs, want more modest changes. How
to deal with restrictions on soft money and what, if any,
level of public funding to propose for congressional
campaigns are issues that have senators on both sides of the
aisle nervous.</p>
<p>In the House, Speaker Tom Foley (D., Wash.) and Minority
Leader Robert Michel (R., Ill.) are negotiating over the same
issues, but they are reported to be even further apart and
working on a slower track than their Senate counterparts.</p>
<p>But as Congress returns from its Easter break, the heat is
intensifying. "If they vote against reform, they are going to
be in trouble in their re-election campaigns," vows Joan
Claybrook, the chief lobbyist for Public Citizen, founded by
consumer activist Ralph Nader. Public Citizen retained
Democratic media consultant Frank Greer to create an
advertising campaign to build support for public financing of
congressional campaigns.</p>
<p>Ms. Claybrook and others say the campaign-finance issue is
a ticking time bomb with voters. Several recent
public-opinion polls disclose a deeply rooted public cynicism
about the political process. One poll, released last month by
Public Citizen, showed that public esteem for members of
Congress dropped to 51% from 61% between April 1989 and
February 1990. Almost a third of voters surveyed said they
believed their own representative is "caught up and corrupted
by the system of money and politics."</p>
<p>This year the National Republican Congressional Campaign
Committee is counseling GOP challengers to use "the sleaze
issue" in Congress to galvanize anti-incumbent sentiments.
"We're telling our candidates they can run against Congress
if they can point out that their member is part of the
problem," says Gary Koops, a spokesman for the committee.</p>
<p>GOP candidates in New Jersey, Nebraska and Pennsylvania
already have challenged Democratic incumbents to institute
voluntary spending and PAC limits in their 1990 campaigns.
Republican Audrie Zettick Schaller, a former Reagan
administration official, has challenged her opponent,
Democratic Rep. Peter Kostmayer, to adhere to overall
spending and tight PAC limits in their race in Pennsylvania's
Eighth District. Most of her proposals come right out of
legislation that Rep. Kostmayer himself has co-sponsored.</p>
<p>But Mr. Kostmayer, who already enjoys a $100,000
fund-raising edge over his lesser-known GOP opponent and who
spent more than $1 million on his re-election campaign in
1988, demurred. Mike Burke, the congressman's campaign
manager, says his boss isn't being a hypocrite on campaign
finance. He claims Ms. Schaller's campaign-spending proposals
contained loopholes that would unfairly benefit the
Republican. He calls an editorial in The Philadelphia
Inquirer that denounced Rep. Kostmayer for refusing to
practice what he preaches "grossly unfair."</p>
<p>Despite the well-publicized abuses of the current
campaign-finance system, incumbents in the House and Senate
know it still gives them a huge edge at the polls. "That's
why none of these changes are going to come easily," concedes
Ms. Claybrook.</p>
