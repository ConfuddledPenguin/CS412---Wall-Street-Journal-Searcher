	<p class="article-leader">FRAMINGHAM, Mass. -- Conventional wisdom may deem Soviet
management technique an oxymoron. Nevertheless, a U.S.
concern plans a Soviet magazine celebrating Soviet managers'
methods.
   International Data Group, a closely held company that
publishes Computerworld and 135 other magazines and
newspapers around the world, plans to publish 50,000 copies
of the new magazine, Manager, starting next month.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The magazine will be produced by Information Computer
Enterprise, a joint venture between International Data and
its Soviet partners that started publishing PC World USSR in
1988. It won't be distributed outside the Soviet Union.
There, circulation will be controlled but those selected will
still have to pay for it.</p>
<p>Patrick J. McGovern, chairman of International Data, said
"this is the first business magazine published in the
U.S.S.R. to offer case studies and practical advice on
operating a profitable venture in the new competitive
environment." Articles will be written by Soviet managers.</p>
