	<p class="article-leader">Great American Bank said it will have to raise $350
million in new capital by year's end after its auditor forced
fourth-quarter loan-loss reserves that gutted much of the big
thrift's remaining tangible capital.
   The capital infusion, required as part of a survival plan
that Great American said yesterday had been endorsed by
federal thrift regulators, raises substantial questions about
the future of the nation's eighth largest thrift, based in
San Diego, Calif.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At best, officials indicated they would have to sell or
merge the company or undertake a dismantling of its prized
Southern California branch network. But even those routes
could be difficult or painful. Outside investors have been
generally loath to buy into the sick industry, and Great
American itself said yesterday that a sale would cause
"substantial dilution" of current shareholder interests. The
company conceded that if its capital-raising efforts don't
bear fruit, it could face further operating restrictions and
possibly even government conservatorship or receivership.</p>
<p>"Great American has a very slim chance of raising $350
million," said Joe Jolson, a thrift industry analyst with
Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. "What they might be
able to do is sell every asset in all their markets except
San Diego, shrink and raise capital. They have about a 50-50
chance of pulling that off."</p>
<p>But Mr. Jolson said even such efforts wouldn't ensure the
company's compliance with capital regulations in the long
term, and that they would seriously impair the company's
earnings.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the fact that the Office of Thrift
Supervision backed the idea seemed a breath of fresh air for
Great American investors. Like many other capital-shy
thrifts, Great American earlier this year was required to
seek regulatory approval of a business plan to meet a new
series of tough federal capital standards. Great American is
among a distinct minority of undercapitalized thrifts that
have been able to win approval of their plans from the
government. Analysts said that development may have accounted
for Great American stock getting a lift yesterday. Its shares
closed at $4.625, up 87.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading.</p>
<p>Great American has been hurt by real estate woes in the
Southwest -- and by the insistence of its auditor, Deloitte &
Touche, that it provide greater reserves against that real
estate.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the company reported a revised loss of $198.9
million, or $8.30 a share, for the fourth quarter ended Dec.
31, reflecting provisions for losses on loans and foreclosed
real estate totaling $271.2 million.</p>
<p>Previously, Great American reported a loss for the period
of $59.3 million, or $2.48 a share, including an $87 million
loan-loss provision, but subsequently said the figures would
be revised at Deloitte's request.</p>
<p>Great American reported profit of $19.8 million, or 80
cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter.</p>
<p>For 1989, the company reported a loss of $263.4 million,
or $11 a share, reflecting $405 million in loss provisions,
compared with 1988 net income of $49.3 million, or $1.99 a
share.</p>
<p>The company declined to immediately provide 1989 year-end
data for loss reserves or troubled loans. At Sept. 30, it
reported nonperforming loans of $584.7 million and reserves
of about $208 million, and some analysts expect the year-end
numbers to jump. It has about $15.9 billion in assets.</p>
<p>As a result of the losses, Great American said it met none
of three federal capital standards pertinent to thrifts at
year's end. It added that, in the auditors opinion for the
1989 financial statement, Deloitte will express concern over
the possibility of Great American being able to survive as a
going concern because of looming regulatory sanctions if the
company falls short of its capital goals this year.</p>
<p>A spokesman said the company's investment banker, Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc., had been in contact with "a number of
interested investors," but declined to name them. Analysts
said possible suitors include Wells Fargo & Co., which has
been scouting potential acquisitions in the lucrative
Southern California retail market for years, and the Pritzker
family of Chicago, which recently pulled out of a deal to buy
control of New York-based CrossLand Savings FSB, the largest
thrift outside Califronia.</p>
<p>Also apparently interested is Wedbush Corp., a Los Angeles
financial services firm, which recently announced plans to
seek permission from federal regulators to boost its 17%
stake in Great American. Wedbush couldn't immediately be
reached for comment.</p>
