	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Peter Munk, chairman of Horsham Corp. was named
chief executive officer, succeeding Ian Delaney who will
resign as president and chief executive, the investment and
oil and gas concern said.
   Jeremy Garbutt, 40-year-old chief financial officer of
American Barrick Resources Corp., was named president and
chief operating officer of Horsham. American Barrick, a big
gold mining firm, is 22.4% owned by Horsham.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Delaney, 46 years old, said he resigned to set up his
own corporate finance business. He said he will retain his
4.5% stake in Horsham's stock and remain a director of the
company. "I'm not going too far away," he said. Mr. Delaney
said he left his job as a merchant banker to create Horsham
three years ago. "We've been successful beyond our wildest
expectations . . . but {Horsham} doesn't need to be run by a
merchant banker."</p>
<p>Mr. Munk, 62, is founder of both Horsham and American
Barrick and controlling shareholder of Horsham. Horsham said
he will take "an active role in the management" of the
company.</p>

financial officer, succeeding Mr. Garbutt.</p>
