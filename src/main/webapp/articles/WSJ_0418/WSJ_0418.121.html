	<p class="article-leader">This week's award of the Pulitzer Prize to the Washington,
N.C., Daily News brings honor to a tradition rarely honored
in the newspaper business: family succession. For years,
Ashely Futrell Sr. ran the small-town daily. Then his son
became Daily News publisher, keeping the business in the
family and out of the hands of a media corporation. The
10,000-reader Daily News took a gold medal this year for
public service. "Chain newspapers aren't as dedicated to the
community," Mr. Futrell Sr. will tell you. "They're no
substitute for the real thing."
   That should be news to my generation of journalists, a
generation that has cheered the disappearance of the
owner-publisher from this nation's newsrooms. We saw the
trend only in terms of freedom from what was considered to be
the meddlesome authority of an in-house publisher. It may be
true that the withdrawal of the proprietor-publisher has
sometimes freed up reporters and editors who work on the news
pages at the front of the paper. But the same
proprietor-publisher's absence has also weakened the
newspaper's voice -- the individual identity that finds
expression on the editorial page. Citizen journalists are
becoming mere units in a chain of financial transactions --
McJournalism, if you please.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>When old-style owners began selling their papers to big
corporations, a power gap emerged. The old owners liked to
fashion the identity of their papers on their editorial
pages; the new owners were more interested in the bottom line
on the balance sheet. Editors and reporters filled that power
gap. With this new role came new privilege. We became the
founding members of the most special of the special
interests, armed with political clout but often shielded from
individual accountability.</p>
<p>We have used this good fortune to commit a crime against
the editorial pages of our newspapers. While corporate owners
had nothing against the muckraking of page one, they worried
about the controversial, partisan, content of the opinion
side. The result was what a friend calls the "Gannettization"
of America. By that he means the management formula designed
to make certain the product is utterly inoffensive. If
editorials must be written at all, this formula reads, they
should be confined to spelling out options open to a council
or a legislature. In all cases, though, it should be "left up
to the reader" to decide which option is preferable. Thus the
"reader outreach" hysteria on many corporate editorial pages,
the desperate polling of reader views and the even more
desperate appeals for reader contributions, however crackpot.
The same editors who made news on page one stood by and
allowed this destruction of the editorial page to proceed.</p>
<p>This isn't journalism, it's market research -- the daily
packaging of one value-neutral position after another. But no
corporate manager dares ask why anyone would want to
subscribe to a paper run by editors who tell readers only
that they must sort things out for themselves. How far we are
from the ideal of William Allen White, the founder of my
hometown paper, the Emporia Gazette, in Emporia, Kan.</p>
<p>"Chiefly and on the face of it, the editor's business is
to print the news, just as a minister's business is to preach
the gospel," White wrote at the turn of the century. "But
what gospel and what news shall be preached and published --
these are individual questions. The editor must be the judge
of his news, of how it is told, what is recited and what
omitted. He must interpret it. He must take a `side' in
everything."</p>
<p>There is nothing inherently sinister in corporate
ownership of the modern newspaper. But when the owner is a
corporate entity, not flesh and blood, that corporate owner
almost never has close ties to the local community. Instead,
it must meet a detached set of corporate employment
standards.</p>
<p>Employment on your community newspaper once reflected, for
better or worse, the very human preferences and political
identities of individual publishers, persons at least
nominally accountable to the community. Now, even on the
smallest chain papers, it involves the application of
detailed templates cut in personnel offices. There they
factor in the "proper" education and the most up-to-date
clerical skills, plus the "correct" mix of race and sexual
preference -- almost anything but representation of those
long-suffering souls who make up the circulation base. It is
this -- not any corporate incompetence or bias -- that leaves
you with the feeling that the headlines in your hometown
paper are being written for somebody else in some other home
town.</p>
<p>This was the general situation in Atlanta, when the
Atlanta Constitution put in place a crew shipped in from
Washington, D.C., and New York City to show Georgians how to
put out a big-city paper. What made the Atlanta experiment
noteworthy was that it did not succeed. Had the editor been
in the employ of a large chain with owners 1,000 miles away,
he would be sitting in the editor's chair today. As it was,
the owners were local. It was possible for them to sense the
anguish of their community over an invasion of journalists,
one that threatened fragile institutions and traditions. The
editor was sent packing.</p>
<p>The best managers of chain newspapers know things aren't
working out the way they should be -- or even the way Mr.
Gannett and Mr. Knight and Mr. Copley envisioned. And they
are coming to understand that this problem is systemic, that
there is little they can do about it.</p>
<p>Readers, though, have made it quite clear to media
researchers that they need papers to have a personal identity
-- that a newspaper is like a guest they invite into their
homes every day. And even though corporate managers have done
their best to give them that identity through "reader
sensitivity" campaigns, signed editorials and celebrity
columnists, the readership surveys continue to show something
critical is missing.</p>
<p>My guess is "it" is a man or woman on the premises with
controlling interest in the press. It is a person who has an
overwhelming interest in how the newspaper is viewed in the
community. It is a person, however bothersome to the various
political factions about town, who can be counted on to avoid
posture and seek conviction when sorting the issues of the
day.</p>
<p>In other words, it is the "real thing" -- an Ashely
Futrell, Sr. or Jr., an American publisher. The species is
becoming so rare you have to wonder how the Pulitzer
committee ever managed to find one.</p>
