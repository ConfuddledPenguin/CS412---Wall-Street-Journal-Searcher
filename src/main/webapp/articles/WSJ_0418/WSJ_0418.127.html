	<p class="article-leader">TRW Inc. reported a 17% decline in first-quarter profit
mainly because of higher interest expense.
   The automotive parts, defense and space contracting and
information services concern earned $57 million, or 92 cents
a share, down from $69 million, or $1.12 a share, a year
earlier. The Cleveland-based company reports share earnings
on a fully diluted basis.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales rose 12% to $1.99 billion from $1.79 billion.</p>
<p>Operating profit from the three major business groups rose
to $159 million, from $150 million a year earlier, TRW said,
but interest expense climbed to $52 million, from $29 million
in the 1989 quarter. Borrowing for two major acquisitions in
1989, combined with soaring interest rates in Brazil to raise
interest costs.</p>
<p>Auto and truck-parts operations showed a 7% rise in
operating profit on a 15% sales gain, TRW said. Higher sales
of occupant-restraint systems, in addition to a strong
European market, more than offset the soft North American
market and problems in Brazil.</p>
<p>Operating profit from space and defense contracting rose
12% on a 4% sales rise. And the information systems and
services business had a 40% operating profit rise.</p>
