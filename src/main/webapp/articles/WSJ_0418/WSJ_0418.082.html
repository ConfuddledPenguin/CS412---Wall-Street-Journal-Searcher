	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission
charged Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. with
illegally using customers' stock that was left in the care of
the firm's back-office operations.
   The firm, one of Wall Street's most respected midsized
houses, agreed to an SEC censure and will pay out $5.6
million, plus interest. "We think this is the largest
disgorgement of any back-office case," said Kathryn Ashbaugh,
an SEC branch chief in New York.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The agency said that Donaldson booked $1.9 million as
profit from the transactions and has about $4 million in
reserve for the disgorgement. The firm had already paid out
$300,000 before the settlement.</p>
<p>Donaldson's Pershing division, its back-office operation,
is the nation's largest "clearing" firm, handling execution
and settlement for more than 500 other brokerage firms and a
million customers.</p>
<p>Regulatory and Wall Street sources said the problems at
Pershing aren't widespread. However, Charles Schwab & Co. two
years ago repaid $3 million to investors after company
officials discovered a similar situation.</p>
<p>Donaldson said it already has begun to dispense the funds
to more than 5,000 customers of about 100 other Wall Street
and regional firms that used Pershing's back-office
operations. More than 90% of the recipients will be retail
investors, said Joseph Donnelly, general counsel at Pershing.
Donaldson is owned by Equitable Life Assurance Society of the
U.S.</p>
<p>In addition, the head of Pershing's equities division,
Michael Dreitlein, agreed to be suspended for 45 days on
charges he "willfully aided and abetted" the firm in the
alleged scheme, the SEC said. He settled the charges without
admitting or denying guilt. Donaldson said he would return to
the firm after the suspension to resume most of his
supervisory duties.</p>
<p>The SEC said that between 1982 and 1988, Pershing tendered
stock without authorization by customers in partial tender
offers. In those offers, companies seek to buy a percentage
of their shares, but not all the stock. Many such deals took
place in the mid-1980s, when such companies as Unocal Corp.,
trying to fend off corporate raiders such as T. Boone
Pickens, set up partial tender offers as defensive measures.</p>
<p>Pershing tendered the unauthorized shares, then waited for
the stock price to drop, as it usually does after a partial
tender is completed, the SEC said. Then the firm bought back
the shares and replaced them in the customers' accounts, the
agency said, adding that Pershing generated gains of about
$4.3 million through this practice.</p>
<p>"This is a statement that firms cannot use customer
securities for the firms' benefit," said Lawrence Iason, who
heads the agency's New York regional office, which brought
the case.</p>
<p>In other cases, Pershing would conduct similar activities
in cases in which convertible securities were being redeemed
by the issuing company but in which Pershing hadn't heard
from customers, the SEC said. Other similar situations
occurred with stock rights or warrants that were expiring and
the firm hadn't received word on whether to exercise
customers' rights or warrants, the agency said. Pershing
gained about $1.5 million from the two practices, the SEC
said.</p>
<p>Pershing and Donaldson lawyers said there wasn't any
malice in the firm's actions. "This was not a profit
motivated activity," Mr. Donnelly said. "It was a customer
protection motivated activity."</p>
<p>Mr. Donnelly explained that Pershing ran a mostly manual
operation in its reorganization department, which handles the
types of transactions cited in the SEC's charges.
Instructions on how to handle partial tenders or other
transactions from Pershing customers at other brokerage firms
"were not always properly directed to the reorganization
department" even though they had been received by the firm,
he said. "The case could be made that {Pershing} was in
receipt of the instructions even though they weren't in a
place they could be acted on." Pershing would then owe the
customers money.</p>
<p>So, "what evolved was a practice of submitting for tender
more shares than you had instructions for," Mr. Donnelly
said. Extra funds were placed in a reserve fund, he said, and
customers would be paid when they made "valid claims."</p>
<p>Still, the settlement with the SEC shows that Pershing
paid out only $300,000 in those "valid claims," and kept the
rest of the $5.9 million either in the reserve fund or to pay
the firm's expenses.</p>
<p>Mr. Donnelly said "the practices discussed in the order
were discontinued even before the SEC inquiry began. We now
have the 100% accuracy of knowing where we stand and who's
giving instructions."</p>
<p>Theodore Levine, a Washington securities lawyer who
represented Donaldson, said the firm offered the distribution
of proceeds in negotiations with the SEC. "It's a
distribution of funds, not really disgorgement," he said.
"The firm has been standing ready for a long time to
distribute the funds."</p>
