	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The U.S. currency surged above 160 yen briefly
yesterday before settling to a more modest advance against
the Japanese unit, with dealers going long dollars in
expectation of today's release of a strong U.S. trade number
for February.
   The mark, moving almost in lock step with the dollar, also
marched higher against its Japanese counterpart, advancing to
well above the important 95-yen level.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The dollar was little changed against continental European
currencies in trading lightened by participants' anticipation
of the U.S. merchandise trade data.</p>
<p>The mark and the dollar are running neck-and-neck and the
winner will be determined by the February trade report, said
Albert Soria, first vice president and foreign exchange
manager at Kansallis Osake Pankki in New York.</p>
<p>If the trade deficit narrows to between $4 billion and $6
billion, the U.S. currency could rally to between 1.6850 and
1.6950 marks, said Mr. Soria, adding that there's little
likelihood that the dollar will move far above 1.70 marks on
strong data.</p>
<p>But if the trade gap comes in between $7.5 billion and $8
billion, the dollar will slip, possibly testing 1.6650 marks,
he said. Mr. Soria also said that the yen will probably
continue to weaken.</p>
<p>The U.S. merchandise trade deficit is seen narrowing to a
seasonally adjusted $7.6 billion from January's $9.25 billion
shortfall, according to the average estimates of 15
economists.</p>
<p>But there is talk in the currency markets, particularly in
Japan, that the figure could be as low as $4.5 billion to $5
billion.</p>
<p>Susan Babcock, vice president of corporate foreign
exchange at Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp., said such low
estimates represent a Japanese tactic to build expectations
of a very good trade figure and push the U.S. unit higher on
dollar-buying ahead of the report. She noted that Japanese
institutions provided strong interest in buying the dollar
during morning trading in New York.</p>
<p>When the exaggerated optimism is disappointed by a more
modest improvement in trade, the dollar will slide in a
sell-off, she said.</p>
<p>The dollar hit an intraday high of 160.15 before drifting
lower. The dollar had previously climbed over 160 yen April 2
in Tokyo, also settling lower that day.</p>
<p>Ms. Babcock also said the yen is suffering from an
"increasing realization that there is no (Group of Seven
industrial nations) defense for the yen." Before the G-7
meeting April 7, traders had worried about an agreement to
cooperate with intervention to defend the Japanese currency.</p>
<p>Moreover, Kansallis Osake's Mr. Soria said, a strong U.S.
trade performance in February would show that the dollar is
already competitively valued and would weaken whatever reason
the U.S. might have for joining intervention.</p>
<p>In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 1.6768 marks, down from 1.6775 marks late Monday, and at
159.68 yen, up from 159.30 yen late Monday. Sterling was
quoted at $1.6385, up from $1.6300 late Monday.</p>
<p>The mark ended at 95.23 yen in late trading in New York,
up from 94.95 yen late Monday. Sterling rose to 2.7474 marks
from 2.7355 marks late Monday in New York.</p>
<p>In Tokyo Wednesday, the U.S. currency opened for trading
at 160.13 yen, up from Tuesday's Tokyo close of 159.83 yen.
Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at about 1.6796 marks.</p>
<p>The West German currency performed well despite the
announcement by the Soviet Union yesterday that it is
starting to restrict the supply of natural gas to Lithuania
as part of economic sanctions that Moscow had threatened to
enact against the rebellious republic. Such political turmoil
frequently prompts safe-haven dollar buying that buoys the
U.S. unit.</p>
<p>But Kansallis Osake's Mr. Soria said there isn't any
reluctance to buy the mark.</p>
<p>The dollar was neither harmed nor helped by a batch of
data that showed conflicting measures of the strength of the
U.S. economy.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $375.20 an ounce, unchanged. Estimated
volume was a light 2.4 million ounces.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong Wednesday, gold opened for trading at $374.25
an ounce.</p>
