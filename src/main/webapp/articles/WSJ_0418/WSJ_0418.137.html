	<p class="article-leader">The legal saga that began with his controversial 1987
arrest on insider-trading charges concluded yesterday when a
federal judge ordered Robert M. Freeman to serve four months
in jail and pay $1 million in fines.
   U.S. District Judge Pierre N. Leval told the former head
of arbitrage at Goldman, Sachs & Co. that while he believes
Mr. Freeman is "a very much chastened person," jail time was
necessary because of the "need for deterrence in the
marketplace."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Looking tanned and fit in a navy blue suit, Mr. Freeman
sat emotionless between his two attorneys as the judge
sentenced him to one year in prison, with the last eight
months suspended. Mr. Freeman was also sentenced to two years
probation after his prison term and to a total of 300 hours
of community service.</p>
<p>Once one of the country's most powerful arbitragers, Mr.
Freeman agreed in August to plead guilty to a felony count
and resigned from Goldman Sachs, the firm he had worked at
for 19 years. Mr. Freeman admitted to using inside
information received from Kidder, Peabody & Co. takeover
strategist Martin Siegel in connection with the proposed
takeover of Beatrice Cos. by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.</p>
<p>Mr. Freeman faced a possible sentence of as much as five
years in prison, and the government put his maximum fine at
$1,860,000. He and his lawyers declined to comment on the
sentence issued.</p>
<p>Many of Mr. Freeman's friends and the lawyers who crowded
the packed courtroom to watch the proceeding said they
believed Mr. Freeman's sentence to be stiff; some said they
believed he wouldn't have to serve any time in prison.</p>
<p>Indeed, Robert Fiske and Paul Curran, Mr. Freeman's
lawyers, argued that his crime wasn't one that warrants jail
time. They said in a sentencing memo last month, and again
yesterday, that he should be treated with leniency because of
the "suffering that Mr. Freeman has undergone for three years
as a direct consequence of the government's precipitous and
highly publicized arrest of him in February 1987."</p>
<p>But Assistant U.S. Attorney John McEnany, lead prosecutor
in the case, recommended a prison sentence that "reflects the
magnitude of the crime and the absence of any excuse" for
committing it. Prison, he said, is the "only sanction with
any meaning to wealthy and powerful individuals and which
will provide a deterrent." Judge Leval seemed to agree.</p>
<p>"The trading of inside information has become a watchword
or standard practice of arbitrage," the judge told Mr.
Freeman. "Arbitragers think themselves authorized to
disregard the law, and these practices seriously undermine
the integrity of the marketplace. It is precisely because of
those facts that the court cannot treat the matter as one of
small importance."</p>
<p>The government's case against the 48-year-old Mr. Freeman
began with his February 1987 arrest on insider-trading
charges. The subsequent indictment of Mr. Freeman and two
others was dropped in May 1987, and prosecutors promised
another, broader one. But the new indictment never came and
prosecutors last year said they wouldn't charge the two
others charged along with Mr. Freeman.</p>
<p>Both Mr. Freeman and Goldman had vigorously asserted that
Mr. Freeman was innocent of any wrongdoing until his decision
to plead guilty in August. But Mr. Freeman is understood to
have agreed to plead after prosecutors confronted his lawyers
with the fact that another Goldman Sachs official was
prepared to testify against him.</p>
<p>Mr. Freeman's sentencing was delayed for months because
his lawyers sought to block prosecutors from presenting to
the court allegations that he committed some 20 other crimes
in addition to the one he pleaded to. Those other crimes, the
government said, should be considered in meting out his
sentence. But Judge Leval said he wouldn't consider any other
allegations of wrongdoing in considering a sentence.</p>
<p>Mr. Freeman must still settle civil charges brought
against him by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Now
that Mr. Freeman has been sentenced, a date will soon be set
for the sentencing of his accuser, Mr. Siegel.</p>
<p>Mr. Freeman's lawyers recommended that he serve his time
in a minimum security prison on Pensacola, Fla. Mr. Freeman,
whose primary residence is in Rye, N.Y., has a second home
near Pensacola, according to lawyers in the case.</p>

<p>FIDELITY INVESTMENTS, in a reversal, supports Pennsylvania
takeover bill.</p>
<p>With the Pennsylvania Legislature poised to pass the
nation's toughest anti-takeover legislation this week, one of
the measure's most vocal critics has switched sides -- and
raised a lot of eyebrows.</p>
<p>Fidelity, a Boston mutual-fund group, had condemned the
bill as harmful to shareholders because of provisions
controlling rights of investors to mount proxy contests. But
the bill is being strongly pushed by Armstrong World
Industries Inc., which is the target of a proxy contest and a
possible takeover attempt by the Belzberg family of Canada.</p>
<p>A possible reason for the switch, opponents of the bill
say, is that Fidelity is on a short list of applicants being
considered by Armstrong to manage its $180 million
employee-thrift plan.</p>
<p>"Obviously, the timing of these two developments concerns
me," John C. Bogle, chairman of Vanguard Group, an investment
company, wrote Pennsylvania Gov. Robert P. Casey. Vanguard,
which strongly opposes the anti-takeover measure, was
recently dropped from consideration for Armstrong's account.</p>
<p>"I trust that your office . . . will carefully review this
matter, to assure there were no improprieties in this
situation," Mr. Bogle wrote.</p>
<p>Armstrong, of Lancaster, Pa., issued a vigorous denial.
"In the strongest terms it is both preposterous and patently
false for anyone to assert that either Armstrong or Fidelity
Investments has offered or received a `deal,'" John N.
Jordin, Armstrong's vice-president for governmental affairs,
wrote Pennsylvania State Sen. Noah H. Wenger, the original
sponsor of the bill whose district includes Armstrong's
headquarters.</p>
<p>If the bill passes and is signed into law, as expected, it
will become the first in the nation to garnish profits of
short-term shareholders who sell within 18 months after a
failed attempt to control the company. Among other
controversial provisions, the law would also restrict voting
rights of large shareholders in proxy contests. Fidelity
loudly opposed the bill but changed its mind after amendments
were added stipulating that the restrictions wouldn't apply
to shareholders who mount proxy fights with no intention of
taking over the company.</p>
<p>The bill has passed overwhelmingly in both chambers of
Pennsylvania's General Assembly and Gov. Casey has indicated
he plans to sign it into law once compromise measures are
ironed out.</p>
<p>"We fought this very hard," said Robert C. Pozen,
Fidelity's general counsel. "And we also knew how to count
votes." Another provision in the bill would allow company
directors to consider interests other than those of
shareholders when assessing takeover offers. That provision
remains the most objectionable to institutional investors.</p>
<p>"We believe that given the political reality, we did as
well as we could," said Mr. Pozen. As for Vanguard's
insinuations of a sellout? "We believe that the letter is
slanderous and libelous," said Mr. Pozen, "and we are
consulting our lawyers."</p>

<p>BANK ACCOUNTS ARE FROZEN in money-laundering
investigation.</p>
<p>A federal judge in Atlanta froze 684 U.S. bank accounts
that allegedly once contained hundreds of millions of dollars
in illegal Colombian drug profits.</p>
<p>The unusual order by Judge William O'Kelley came at the
request of the Justice Department, which said it would take
legal actions to seize whatever money is left the accounts
once it confirms they have been controlled by drug
traffickers. Judge O'Kelley issued the order Monday, and the
Justice Department announced the action yesterday in
Washington.</p>
<p>The judge ordered banks holding the frozen accounts to
give the government all relevant records so that
investigators can continue to trace illicit drug profits. He
ordered that records on about 70 additional accounts be
turned over as well. The Justice Department said the total of
754 suspect accounts may have received illegal deposits of
nearly $400 million as of early 1989. The accounts are held
in 173 banks in 22 states and the District of Columbia, with
the biggest concentrations in New York and Miami, the
department added.</p>
<p>The department's actions are the latest phase in the
government's largest-ever money-laundering inquiry, known as
Operation Polar Cap. Prosecutors didn't charge any of the
banks affected by the court order with wrongdoing. But when
pressed on the issue, Peter Djinis, a lead prosecutor on the
case, declined to rule out actions against U.S. banks and
said the investigation would continue.</p>
<p>The suspect accounts allegedly received illegal proceeds
from the operations of the world's biggest cocaine
traffickers, including Colombians Pablo Escobar-Gaviria and
Jorge Ochoa-Vasquez, leading members of the so-called
Medellin cartel.</p>
<p>A "certain small percentage" of the targeted accounts may
turn out to be controlled by legitimate businesses and
individuals, and therefore won't be seized, said Wilmer
Parker, another lead prosecutor on the case.</p>
<p>As a result of Operation Polar Cap, 127 people have been
criminally charged, the Justice Department said. More arrests
are expected.</p>
