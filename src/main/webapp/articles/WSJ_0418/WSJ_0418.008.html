	<p class="article-leader">WANT TO KNOW how much a top executive makes? That's easy.
Just peek at the company's proxy statement and you'll find
the dollar amount of his salary plus bonus.
   Want to know how that compensation was computed? That's
another story -- and a complicated one.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But why should you care anyway? Because that's one way
that you as a shareholder can find out whether the company is
too generous with its top brass.</p>
<p>To figure out the computation, you first have to find the
formula the company uses for incentive pay. Only a few
companies give enough details to do that. These include Walt
Disney Co., with a formula of 2% of the amount by which net
income exceeds 9% of stockholders' equity; Toys "R" Us Inc.,
1% of pretax profit above $18 million; and Reebok
International Ltd., 5% of pretax profit above $20 million.
Each of these formulas is for the company's chief executive
officer.</p>
<p>But most companies don't give enough specifics to make the
calculation. Typical is Limited Inc., which in its 1988 proxy
says the executive-compensation plan "awards bonuses to
designated executives and employees of the company if their
performance or that of the company meets specified goals."
The big retailer, based in Columbus, Ohio, doesn't give its
stockholders the faintest clue as to how it computed the
$1,030,753 cash compensation of chairman and president Leslie
H. Wexner in 1988. Asked why Limited doesn't disclose an
executive-compensation formula in its annual proxy, Alfred
Dietzel, vice president-financial, declined comment.</p>
<p>A company doesn't have to disclose the compensation
formula under Securities and Exchange Commission rules. "A
public company only has to report the dollar compensation of
the five highest-paid executives," says an SEC spokesman.</p>
<p>But many experts think that holders have a right to know
the formula. "It should be an open compact between the
company and the shareholders dividing the spoils," says Graef
Crystal, a compensation specialist and adjunct professor of
business administration at the Haas School of Business,
University of California at Berkeley. "The fact that many
chief executives are loath to disclose their outdated
incentive formulas shows they have sound survival instincts."
Adds Peter Chingos, national director of
executive-compensation consulting for Peat Marwick, a major
accounting firm: "The formula shows whether top management's
compensation properly reflects profits and measures up
against a reasonable return for shareholders."</p>
<p>Compensation specialists say the formulas help directors
measure executives' performance against the passive
investment of equity at current market yields. Under many
formulas, executives are paid from profits after deducting
that yield. Thus, to get a bonus, top executives must show
they outperformed simply investing stockholders' equity in
fixed-income securities. (In simplest terms, stockholders'
equity is total assets minus total liabilities.)</p>
<p>Here's how a typical formula works: Company A pays its
executives from an incentive pool, which represents 5% of net
income that tops an 8% return on equity. This is known as a
five-over-eight formula.</p>
<p>Say the company reported $500 million in annual profit,
which met targeted goals of the board. Shareholders' equity
amounted to $2 billion. So Company A's total incentive pool
for top executives amounts to $17 million -- 5% of $340
million ($500 million of profits minus $160 million, or 8% of
$2 billion in equity).</p>
<p>In Company A, executives are paid a bonus geared to a
percentage of their annual salary. The higher an executive's
rank, the higher the percentage. The chief executive officer
may get 50% to 100% of his salary as a bonus from the pool,
depending on his performance. The chief operating officer may
receive from 45% to 90% of his salary; the chief financial
officer, 40% to 80%; and lower-level executives, 30% to 60%.</p>
<p>Thus, the chief executive, who gets a salary of $1
million, could get $500,000 to $1 million as a bonus. The
chief operating officer, who earns $750,000, could get a
bonus of $337,500 to $675,000; the chief financial officer,
who earns $500,000, a bonus of $200,000 to $400,000. These
percentages aren't disclosed in corporate proxies beyond an
occasional reference that bonuses can't exceed a certain
percentage of salary.</p>
<p>Let's look at companies that provide full disclosure in
their latest proxies. At Walt Disney, Toys "R" Us and Reebok,
the chief executives alone are compensated based on a single
formula. Disney Chairman Michael Eisner, who is paid a bonus
based on a two-over-nine formula (changing to two over 11
after 1990), received a bonus of $8.8 million for the fiscal
year ended last Sept. 30, up from $6.7 million the previous
year. His annual base salary is $750,000.</p>
<p>Charles Lazarus, chairman of Toys "R" Us, got an annual
base salary of $315,000 with a bonus of $4.1 million for the
year ended Jan. 31, 1989. The bonus is 1% of annual pretax
profit that exceeds $18 million. And Reebok Chairman Paul
Fireman, who receives an annual salary of $350,000, got a
bonus of $11 million for 1988; his bonus is 5% of annual
pretax profit above $20 million.</p>
<p>But at Paramount Communications Inc., no formula is
specified. Chairman Martin Davis, who got a 1988 salary and
bonus of $3.67 million, is paid his bonus based on the
"extent to which performance targets set by committee are
achieved," according to the company's proxy. P. Roy Vagelos,
chairman of Merck & Co., got a salary and bonus of $1.6
million in 1988. His bonus was awarded "in such amounts as {a
compensation} committee determines but it cannot exceed 12%
of `incentive earnings' as defined in Merck's compensation
plan." There's no way to compute the formula.</p>
<p>That, however, may not matter too much longer because
compensation consultants say that the formula may one day
become passe. That's probably either because it reveals too
much or because companies ignore it anyway if it proves to be
a bar to bonuses. Many boards are deciding to drop it and
substitute more subjective criteria.</p>
<p>For example, J.P. Morgan & Co., the big bank holding
company that operates Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. of New York,
has been paying its top executives from a pool consisting of
net income that exceeds 8% of stockholders' equity. During
1987, Morgan added $875 million to its allowance for credit
losses, mainly to reserves for questionable loans overseas.
This wiped out executive bonuses under the formula. So the
board ignored the formula and gave Morgan executives bonuses
anyway.</p>
<p>Lewis T. Preston, who stepped down as Morgan chairman in
January, got $641,667 in salary and a discretionary $600,000
bonus for 1987. For 1988, Mr. Preston received a total of
$1.8 million in cash compensation under the formula. The
salary and the bonus weren't disclosed separately.</p>
<p>Edmund Rogers, Morgan's senior vice president and resident
counsel, declines to give the formula that shows how the pool
is distributed to senior executives. "We don't disclose it
because we don't think it's meaningful," he says. "We're
required to provide the total dollar compensation for each
top executive, but we've decided not to disclose the bonus
alone because we feel it's competitive information."</p>
<p>When Morgan issued its proxy last month, shareholders saw
Mr. Preston's total cash compensation, which included a bonus
for 1989 despite a $2 billion increase in the bank's
foreign-loan reserves during the year. "We'll be
discontinuing the formula for senior officers," Mr. Rogers
says, "and the bonus will henceforth be included in the
general incentive compensation plan, based on performance and
at the discretion of the board."</p>
<p>"The trend is away from fixed formulas to goal-attainment
incentives," says Mr. Chingos, the Peat Marwick consultant.
"Under these incentives, executives are paid bonuses based on
their meeting certain performance goals, such as return on
investment or cash flow." The SEC doesn't require these goals
to be disclosed, he notes, so the shareholder will see only
the total cash compensation in the proxy.</p>
