	<p class="article-leader">STOCKHOLM -- The Swedish government said domestic
households' disposable income would increase 2% next year,
under the final version of the tax overhaul proposal it
unveiled Tuesday.
   The Social Democratic minority government also proposed in
the document to allow companies to deduct 65% of the value of
their stock in foreign units. The revisions, which aim to cut
and simplify taxes while broadening the tax base over a
two-year period, reduce the top marginal tax to 50% from
80.2%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>State tax will be canceled on wages of up to 180,000
kronor ($29,502), and those wage earners will pay only city
or local council tax of about 30%. About 85% of all taxpayers
will pay only the local tax.</p>
<p>The 76 billion-krona ($12.46 billion) overhaul is
guaranteed passage by the Riksdag, Sweden's parliament,
despite the goverment's lack of majority after its deal with
the opposition Liberal Party last week.</p>
