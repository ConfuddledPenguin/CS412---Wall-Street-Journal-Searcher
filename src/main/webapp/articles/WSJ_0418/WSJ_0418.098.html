	<p class="article-leader">YOUR MONEY MATTERS COLUMN of April 10 contained incorrect
figures for payments from some immediate annuities purchased
with a $100,000 investment. The figures in the article and
accompanying table were calculated by multiplying payouts on
a $10,000 investment by 10. That was incorrect because the
payouts from some companies were net amounts that had been
reduced by policy fees. Those fees would be the same, not 10
times higher, for policies bought with a $100,000 investment.
Insurance companies listed in the table were correctly ranked
on the basis of payments for a $10,000 investment.
