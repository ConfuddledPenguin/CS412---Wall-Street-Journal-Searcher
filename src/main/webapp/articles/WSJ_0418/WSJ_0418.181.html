	<p class="article-leader">WHEN IT COMES TO compensation, what makes middle managers
see red?
   It isn't that some chief executive salaries rival those of
ballplayers or rock stars, or that golden parachutes
proliferate. It isn't that stock options can deliver more pay
than a middle manager will earn in a lifetime. And it isn't
simply that their own pay raises seem paltry.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>What really makes middle managers mad is unfairness.</p>
<p>Listen to this vice president and financial analyst at a
major bank: "It disturbs me when someone on high dictates
that no matter how hard you work or what you do, you're only
going to get a 6% increase, and if you don't like it, you can
take a hike. Yet whatever they've negotiated for themselves
-- 10% or 20% or 30% -- is a different issue from the rest of
the staff." Adds Joe, a manager at Sterling Drugs Inc.: "It's
creating a gap between those who do and those who have."</p>
<p>That same bitterness surfaces repeatedly here in a panel
discussion with a group of middle managers. Ask them about
what their CEO makes, and most profess not to even know -- or
care. Ask them about their own pay, and they don't seem
particular bothered by the level. But ask them about how
their pay raises are set or how they compare to the raises of
their bosses, and they start talking about inequities,
sinking morale and the decline of worker loyalty.</p>
<p>Arranged for The Wall Street Journal by Decision Research
Corp., a marketing-research company, the group consisted of
eight middle managers. Each manager works at a large publicly
traded industrial or service company and has between three
and 40 subordinates. The managers' average tenure is seven
years. Their own compensation ranges from $50,000 to $100,000
a year. And -- not surprisingly -- they agreed to speak on
condition that only their first names or titles be used.</p>
<p>Their responses are not meant to be scientifically valid.
But the uniformity of their responses is striking. And their
complaints are those that are echoed repeatedly throughout
the ranks of middle management.</p>
<p>In principle, most don't find chief executive pay
upsetting. "Our CEO is active and involved," says an
information-systems manager at American Cyanamid Co. "I don't
think {millions} is too much. I wouldn't take that job with
all its pressure and stress."</p>
<p>Indeed, many feel their leaders even deserve to earn a
great deal more than do middle managers: "There's more of me
than there are of them," says a manager at Liz Claiborne Inc.
The senior managers at Claiborne, she says, "work harder than
everybody else, and they're making this company what it is."
Do they really need all that money? "I don't think they need
it," she says. "I think they earned it."</p>
<p>These middle managers had no problems with CEO pay hitting
even stratospheric levels. Should there be a ceiling put on
top executive pay? they are asked. "Is there a ceiling on
performance?" responds a media supervisor at a Saatchi &
Saatchi advertising agency.</p>
<p>But for all the talk about pay for performance these days,
most of the group feel they see the opposite only too often.
Many suspect, for instance, that their superiors aren't above
tampering with pay-for-performance formulas when it suits
them -- "bingo bookkeeping," says Joe, the Sterling Drug
manager. "When they don't get the 10% earnings increase, they
say, `OK, it's not my fault we didn't make money, it's
somebody else's fault. Next year maybe we'll do better, but
if we don't, that won't be my fault, either. But if we make
money, I'm the guy that did it.'"</p>
<p>Indeed, they object even when it benefits them. A
marketing manager at Avon Products Inc., thinks that one
recent year's bonus pool for managers was inflated by special
items "that shouldn't have been included in the profits, so
they're paying for non-performance and they shouldn't do
that. I don't think they are spending their money well."
However, she adds: "Nobody turned their checks back."</p>
<p>As managers, they also worry about those who report to
them. Caps on raises don't allow for rewarding extraordinary
performance. But somehow these managers have to explain to
their subordinates why the pay of lower-level workers is
allowed only to inch up, while the pay of the boss can
skyrocket.</p>
<p>"One of the things that really frustrates me and a number
of my peers is that I work for a company that prides itself
in paying and compensating people on an {industry average},"
says the American Cyanamid manager. "That's not something I
necessarily think is great to strive for. But we also had a
chairman and CEO who was {among the highest paid in the
industry} in 1988. So I have people killing themselves --
actually making a difference on the corporate bottom line --
and the best I can do for them is 8%."</p>
<p>The manager of the Saatchi unit expresses similar
frustration with raising subordinates' pay. "I have
23-year-olds making multimillion-dollar decisions who are
making $17,000 a year," he says. "We have exit interviews
{that show} our company drives people out because they won't
give them decent salaries."</p>
<p>It's a common problem. A survey by the Hay Group showed
that on the average, satisfactory performers received 4.7%
increases while outstanding performers received 7.7%
increases. For a $40,000-a-year worker, that would work out
to about a $17-a-week after-tax difference. "Hardly enough to
push someone to excel," says Ira Kay, senior vice president
and managing director of compensation consulting at Hay.</p>
<p>For some middle managers, though, such a compensation
strategy reflects a deeper, more troubling attitude on the
part of companies. That is, that compensation isn't seen as a
motivational tool but rather as just another business
expense.</p>
<p>"They're looking at it this way," says Sterling Drug's
Joe. "We get a body, put it in this spot, give it some money,
and then when it gets too expensive, get rid of it and get
another body {at a lower cost} and put him in the spot."
Agrees the Saatchi unit manager: "Most of them are treating
people like just a cost of operations."</p>
<p>The solution these middle managers would prefer: a system
of rewards based on team and individual performance that
allows for extraordinary bonuses. They want to be paid more
directly for their performance in meeting goals -- paid out,
though, over a longer term so that workers don't have an
incentive to inflate short-term results. And they want their
bosses to be paid similarly.</p>
<p>"I feel pretty good about it," says a customer-service
manager for a large public utility, which has such a system.
"You all have shared goals. There's a different amount at
risk in each package, so you really incent people to do
exceptional work, and not reward people for just hanging on."</p>
<p>Such a shared system, they believe, would help them work
more effectively. "After working in a company where people do
share the same goals and it is a total team effort, I don't
want to go to work for just anybody else because of a better
package or anything they are going to offer to try to lure
me," says the Claiborne manager. "It has to be the kind of
company I want to work for." Agrees the Avon manager: "I'm
getting back to more traditional values. If you are working
with people that have similar values, it's more likely that
you will be able to work effectively with them."</p>
<p>It would also assuage another one of their concerns: peers
and immediate supervisors who don't earn their keep. "I see
my boss -- I think I work harder than he does," says a vice
president of Chemical Banking Corp. "He's a regional manager
and all he does is review my work. And I think he works
harder than his boss. I honestly think that compensation
isn't tied to your performance or your effort at all. Really,
it's the rank and file that does all the work, and they're
not compensated accordingly. It stinks."</p>
<p>That's been particularly true, these managers say, in
recent years, as companies have thinned the ranks of middle
management -- and yet haven't reduced the burden. As the
manager of the Saatchi unit says: "I've noticed that my
workload and responsibilities have increased more than my
salary."</p>
<p>But most aren't sanguine about solving the problem any
time soon. The bank financial analyst notes that her company
has recently canceled its profit-sharing plan and that only
"deal doers" get bonuses nowadays.</p>
<p>Many of them, however, report having used a time-honored
method of increasing their own pay. "Three years ago, I was
grossly underpaid, so I quit. A year later I came back with a
50% increase in salary," says the Chemical Bank vice
president. Simply threatening to quit worked for the Liz
Claiborne manager. Adds the manager of the Saatchi unit:
"It's a standard technique." The problem is, he reckons: "You
have to be ready to go."</p>
