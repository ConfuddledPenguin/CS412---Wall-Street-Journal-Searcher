	<p class="article-leader">Neutrogena Corp., a maker of specialty skin and hair care
products, said it expects net income in the second quarter
ending April 30 to be "in the range of 50% lower" than a year
ago on lower sales.
   In the year-ago quarter, the Los Angeles-based company
earned$6.3 million, or 23 cents a share, on sales of $50.4
million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>March sales were "sharply below March 1989," leading to
revised management expectations for the quarter, said Lloyd
E. Cotsen, president and chief executive officer. He said it
is "unlikely that 1990 growth rates will exceed" the 14%
sales growth rate achieved in fiscal 1989 over fiscal 1988.</p>
<p>Mr. Cotsen attributed the anticipated second-quarter sales
decline to "general softness at the retail level, where tight
inventory controls have had a compounding negative effect."
In fiscal 1990, Mr. Cotsen said he expects sales to top the
$203.2 million achieved a year earlier. "We want shareholders
to recognize that record earnings will be tougher, but still
achievable, he said.</p>
