	<p class="article-leader">Boosted by a sharp profit rise from nonferrous metals and
mining, Societe Generale de Belgique S.A. posted consolidated
1989 earnings of 20.1 billion Belgian francs ($578.9
million), compared with a revised year-earlier loss of 872
million francs.
   Operating profit rose to 16.8 billion francs from a
revised 9.1 billion francs. Data for both consolidated and
operating profit exclude earnings from companies in which
Generale holds a noncontrolling minority interest.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Most of the gain in operating earnings came from the
nonferrous metals and mining unit, ACEC-Union Miniere S.A.,
which benefited from high prices for zinc, nickel, and other
nonferrous metals on world markets in 1989. ACEC's
contribution to profit more than tripled to 9.6 billion
francs.</p>
<p>The healthy performance also reflected Generale's
emergence from a yearlong restructuring program, which
involved heavy one-time losses. Extraordinary items
contributed 3.3 billion francs to 1989 results, compared with
a revised one-time extraordinary loss of 10 billion francs in
1988, mostly related to restructuring.</p>
