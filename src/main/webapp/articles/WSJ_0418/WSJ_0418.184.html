	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Charles Keating asked that Lincoln Savings &
Loan Association, which the government seized last year, be
returned to him under judicial supervision.
   Testifying in his court challenge to the government's
takeover, Mr. Keating said "giving Lincoln back to the people
who can run it properly will save the taxpayers from any
losses."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Federal regulators say Mr. Keating and his managers ran
Lincoln fraudulently and estimate that the cost of bailing
out the Irvine, Calif., thrift will top $2 billion, making it
one of the most expensive thrift failures ever. Mr. Keating
is the chairman of Lincoln's former parent company, American
Continental Corp. of Phoenix, Ariz.</p>
<p>Mr. Keating said that over several years he could manage
Lincoln's assets so that taxpayers wouldn't be called in to
cover the government-insured deposits at the thrift. But
Judge Stanley Sporkin responded with some skepticism to Mr.
Keating's request, saying regulators, not court-appointed
managers, "have the congressional mandate" to manage thrifts
under the massive S&L bailout enacted this past year.</p>
<p>Mr. Keating made his plea as he wound up several days of
questioning by his own lawyers in the trial being held in
federal district court here. Earlier yesterday, lawyers for
Mr. Keating continued their assertions that regulators were
incompetent and had a vendetta against Mr. Keating. Mr.
Keating's lawyers disclosed a memo suggesting regulators knew
they had made mistakes in calculating Lincoln's capital
strength but refused to admit them. At the time, regulators
were contending Lincoln was $114 million short of its capital
requirements.</p>
<p>In the memo, dated Feb. 17, 1989, Federal Home Loan Bank
Board official Alvin Smuzynski wrote to a superior that "it
now appears that the examiners did make a significant -- $60
million -- error in their calculation." But Kevin O'Connell,
another senior regulator, told reporters at the courthouse
that regulators later determined they hadn't made a mistake.</p>
<p>Mr. Keating charged that other documents show regulators
were intent on denying various proposals he made to sell
Lincoln in the spring of 1989, before the government took it
over in April. Regulators attached 21 conditions to a sale
Mr. Keating proposed, but still refused to approve it even
after Mr. Keating accepted the conditions, he asserted. In a
Bank Board memo dated March 30, 1989, Mr. Smuzynski wrote,
"We sometimes play a game with recommendations-you can deny a
recommendation by conditioning it to death."</p>
<p>But as cross-examination by lawyers for the government
began yesterday afternoon, other documents pointed to serious
reservations the government had about some aspects of the
sales Mr. Keating had arranged. The government was concerned
that Mr. Keating was financing the sale himself and that
American Continental executives were involved in the buy-out
groups.</p>
<p>As part of one proposed transaction, government lawyers
said, Mr. Keating's American Continental was to pay $40
million for a subsidiary of Trump Group Inc., a concern
controlled by New York businessmen Jules and Eddie Trump. At
the same time, the Trump brothers, who aren't related to
Donald Trump, would provide about $35 million to finance the
purchase of Lincoln.</p>
<p>In a letter introduced by lawyers for the government,
Lincoln's own auditor, Touche Ross & Co., suggested that
American Continental was paying $35 million more for the
Trump Group subsidiary than it was worth. Mr. Keating
disputed that Touche Ross had reached that conclusion.</p>
<p>James Murphy, a lawyer for the government, also said the
proposed sales didn't meet the government's demand that
American Continental agree to pay back to Lincoln $94 million
in controversial tax-sharing payments that Lincoln had paid
to American Continental.</p>
