	<p class="article-leader">BASKING RIDGE, N.J. -- American Telephone & Telegraph Co.
and its unions tentatively agreed on a nonmanagement
retirement plan that would nearly double the number of
eligible workers to 34,000.
   The early retirement plan, agreed to by the Communications
Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers, would add three years of age and three
years of service to the records of all nonmanagement
employees May 1. Unlike under the previous AT&T proposal, the
added years count toward the calculation of the pension as
well as toward eligibility.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As a rule of thumb, an AT&T employee's age and length of
service must add up to 75 for pension eligibility. Currently,
18,000 nonmanagers are entitled to a pension. AT&T has
165,400 nonmanagers world-wide. The company now estimates it
will trim 13,000 jobs this year, up from 12,000 before this
agreement was reached.</p>
<p>The voluntary plan also allows individual AT&T units to
offer special incentives to nonmanagement employees where
there are more people than the workload requires -- including
tacking on five years of age and five of service and offering
a 15% "sweetener" that would boost monthly pension payments.</p>
<p>Last year, a special pension was offered to AT&T managers
that added five years of age and service, plus 15% to pension
checks for up to five years; it was almost identical to the
offer that can be made to nonmanagers in overstaffed AT&T
organizations. Out of 32,121 supervisors eligible last year,
12,535 took it. The program cost AT&T $163 million and
yielded estimated annual savings of $450 million, the company
said. Currently, AT&T has 116,000 managers.</p>
<p>The company employs 280,400 people world-wide -- about
29,000 fewer than in January 1989.</p>
<p>The move is part of AT&T's continuing effort to cut costs,
largely through voluntary plans, to meet the competition. The
company said it couldn't assess the financial impact, because
it doesn't know how many workers will take advantage of the
plan.</p>
<p>CWA President Morton Bahr called the tentative pact "a
very mixed blessing." He said, "It is a sad statement that
workers in their late 40s and early 50s can only look forward
to pension enhancements, when they should have so many years
of productive work ahead of them."</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
AT&T closed at $42 a share, up 12.5 cents.</p>
