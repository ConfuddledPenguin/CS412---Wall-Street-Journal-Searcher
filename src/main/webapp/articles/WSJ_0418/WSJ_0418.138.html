	<p class="article-leader">Saztec International said it will post a third-quarter
loss of about $450,000 because of a delay in revenue
resulting from a work stoppage by one of the company's major
clients.
   The Kansas City, Mo., information conversion concern also
cited the continued investment in its information conversion
express network and the elimination of its hardware division,
which includes a write-off of inventory of $100,000 and a
write-off of receivables of $70,000.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the year-earlier quarter, ended March 31, Saztec earned
$201,657, or six cents a share, on revenue of $5 million.</p>
<p>Despite the third-quarter loss, Saztec said it expects to
show a profit for the fourth quarter. The company said it
expects multiple new contracts to provide more than $10
million in revenue over the next 18 to 24 months and strong
revenue from its utility division.</p>
