	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- McGraw-Hill Inc. said first-quarter net income
fell 47%, although the publishing and business information
company forecast improvement "throughout the year."
   Net income fell to $16.5 million, or 34 cents a share,
from $31.2 million, or 64 cents a share; the year-earlier
figure includes a gain of $8 million, or 16 cents a share,
from a change in accounting for income taxes. Without the
gain, net would have fallen 29%. Revenue rose 7.6% to $420
million from $390.3 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Joseph L. Dionne, chairman and chief executive officer,
said the results were in line with expectations of a soft
first quarter. He noted that the joint-venture school
publishing company with Macmillan Inc. has increased the
seasonality of the business; McGraw-Hill's share of the
venture's first-quarter loss was $12.8 million, "actually
less than anticipated. We expect fine results from the
joint-venture company for the full year."</p>
<p>Borrowing for acquisitions increased interest expense to
$12.5 million from $4.7 million; the company's tax rate,
because of divestitures, was 43% in the latest period, up
from 30% a year ago.</p>
<p>Mr. Dionne said the company expects to achieve its target
for 1990 earnings of $3.50 to $4 a share (which, based on
about 48.8 million average shares outstanding, would indicate
net income in a range of $170 million to $195 million).</p>
<p>Operating profit for the largest unit, information and
publication services, fell 29% to $19 million from $26.7
million, reflecting continuing investments in the
construction information business, a shortage in certain
operations of the computer and communications business unit,
and decreased advertising at Business Week magazine.</p>
<p>Broadcasting operating profit fell because of increased
programming costs and softness in some markets. Operating
profit from financial services rose 22% to $32.1 million from
$26.4 million.</p>
