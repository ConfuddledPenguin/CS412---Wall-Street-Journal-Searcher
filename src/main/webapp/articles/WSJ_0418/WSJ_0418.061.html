	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Gerald Tsai Jr., one of the first of the breed
of "star" money managers, has sold 85% of his stake in
Primerica Inc., parent of Smith Barney, Harris Upham Inc.,
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show.
   All together, he sold one million shares for $26.4 million
in several sales on March 6 and 7, the filings show.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Tsai, 61-year-old chairman of Primerica's executive
committee, rose to fame in the 1960s. He was one of the
decades's new breed of "go-go" fund managers who specialized
in picking speculative glamour stocks and trading in and out
of them at breakneck speed.</p>
<p>But although Mr. Tsai built his reputation on stock market
timing, he didn't have the knack at this recent sale. The
stock has risen sharply from the average share price he
received of $26.43, closing yesterday at $31, up 75 cents, in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
<p>A portion of the stock's rise, $1.50 of it to be exact,
has come since Monday, when Primerica announced its
first-quarter results. Net rose to 73 cents a share from 53
cents a year earlier. Its Smith Barney unit earned $13.1
million, up about 15%. Smith Barney's results reflected the
acquisition of 16 former offices of Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc.</p>
<p>Mr. Tsai was unavailable for comment, and Sanford Weill,
the company's chairman, declined to comment.</p>
<p>Gloria Vogel, analyst at Bear, Stearns Cos., said "the
earnings were very good, and the company has long-term
merits," chief among them Mr. Weill's stewardship and the
diverse businesses that Primerica has put together. Still,
Ms. Vogel said, Primerica isn't on her "buy list." She might
recommend it, she said, "if it got cheaper."</p>
<p>Mr. Tsai started his career as a mutual-fund manager at
Fidelity Investments, moved on to launch his own Manhattan
Fund and later became chairman of American Can, now
Primerica. In December 1988, he stepped down as chairman in
favor of Mr. Weill.</p>

<p>THE POWER OF SUGGESTION: When Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee
A. Iacocca talks, some people listen.</p>
<p>Mr. Iacocca has recently been encouraging the No. 3 U.S.
auto maker's 100 top executives to own stock equal to a
certain percentage of their salaries. Now filings with the
SEC show that three executives and two directors bought
Chrysler stock since Feb. 16.</p>
<p>While their purchases weren't large, each of these
corporate insiders at least doubled his existing holdings,
the SEC filings show. All together, the five bought 21,600
shares, more than Chrysler insiders bought on the open market
in the past five years combined, according to the filings.</p>
<p>The largest purchase was by Robert A. Lutz, president of
the Chrysler Motors division, who bought 10,000 shares,
bringing his total holdings to 17,128 shares, according to
the filings. Joseph Cappy, vice president of brand
development, bought 4,900 shares, almost tripling his
holdings. Mr. Lutz and Mr. Cappy declined to comment.</p>
<p>The other purchases, made by two directors and the vice
president of vehicle development, ranged from 600 shares to
4,600 shares. Prices paid by the five insiders averaged
$17.48 a share, slightly above the stock's close yesterday on
the Big Board of $16.875, up 12.5 cents.</p>
<p>Thomas Houston, a spokesman for Chrysler, said additional
purchases may have been made by Chrysler employees that the
company isn't required to report to the SEC, based on that
agency's definition of who is an "insider."</p>
<p>Jay Leopold, auto industry analyst at Legg Mason, Wood
Walker in Baltimore, said he still has a "hold" on the stock,
but has recently raised his earnings-per-share estimates for
1990 because a Chrysler cost-cutting program is running ahead
of schedule.</p>

<p>FORTUNATE MEN: Three executives at King World Productions
Inc. sold the majority of their company stock in March,
reports filed with the SEC show. The Short Hills, N.J.,
company is the syndicator behind such television game shows
as "Jeopardy and "Wheel of Fortune."</p>
<p>Sidney Cohen, president of the domestic TV sales division,
sold all of his 40,778 shares for about $1.6 million,
according to the SEC filings. Leonard Spilka, treasurer, sold
8,424 shares, 97% of his holdings, for $362,232, the filings
show. Stephen Palley, general counsel, sold 20,000 shares, or
59% of his stake, for $800,390.</p>
<p>Mr. Cohen and Mr. Palley couldn't be reached for comment.
Mr. Spilka said he had held his shares since January 1986,
that they had appreciated substantially over the period, and
that he sold them to pay for improvements on his home. He
retains 300 shares, but said he intends to purchase more by
exercising options.</p>
<p>The three sold at share prices ranging from $39.81 to $43,
according to SEC files. The stock closed yesterday at $41.25,
down 12.5 cents, in Big Board composite trading.</p>
