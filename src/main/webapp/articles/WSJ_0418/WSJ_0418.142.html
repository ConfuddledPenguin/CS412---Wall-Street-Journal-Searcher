	<p class="article-leader">Rax Restaurants Inc., a Columbus, Ohio-based chain of 500
restaurants, said it will switch to an all-vegetable oil for
its fried foods next month.
   Rax will will replace its blend of animal and vegetable
fats for Procter & Gamble Co.'s Crisco oil and promote its
use of cholesterol-free Crisco in its menus and ads. This
marks the first time Cincinnati-based P&G has sold Crisco oil
to a restaurant chain; it was sold only in supermarkets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Rax's switch comes amid growing concerns about the types
of fats used in fast-food restaurants. McDonald's Corp. said
this month it will test an all-vegetable oil to replace its
beef tallow and vegetable blend used for french fries.
Pillsbury Co.'s Burger King said it plans within two months
to test french fries made in an all-vegetable oil. Hardees
Food Systems Inc., a unit of Imasco Ltd., has used
all-vegetable oil in its restaurants since 1987.</p>
<p>Rax said its switch will cost the chain between 30% and
40% more for its oil, but this can be reused more often than
the animal-fat blend. P&G said it will give merchandising
allowances and marketing help to Rax to introduce Crisco oil
use.</p>
