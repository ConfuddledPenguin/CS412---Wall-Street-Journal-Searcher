	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The National Association of Securities
Dealers, in a long-awaited move, proposed a rule to tighten
the limits on the fees charged by mutual funds.
   The rule would set those stingier caps by classifying as
sales charges the socalled 12b-1 fees, which allow mutual
funds to pass on to customers sales-related expenses such as
commissions to brokerage firms that maintain a customer
account.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It seems to us that to have a sales charge rule that
applies only to one kind of sales charge doesn't make much
sense," said A. John Taylor, vice president, investment
companies, at the NASD. The NASD has the authority under
congressional mandate to prohibit excessive sales charges on
mutual funds sold through its members.</p>
<p>Most mutual funds are sold through firms that are members
of the NASD, although some funds are marketed directly to
investors. Mr. Taylor estimated that there are about 1,650
mutual funds that charge 12b-1 fees, although he couldn't
estimate how many of the funds would be bumped into the
excessive category.</p>
<p>The proposal, if passed, wouldn't drastically change the
way most mutual funds charge investors, said Carl Frischling,
a New York lawyer specializing in mutual funds. The rule
"would leave most 12b-1 plans intact," he said. "It would
only affect the excessive ones." Most of those would be
equity funds, he added.</p>
<p>Some mutual funds, especially those that charge a fee when
an investor cashes out, levy 12b-1 fees as high as 1.25% a
year. That can eat into an investor's gains under current
rules because there isn't a cap.</p>
<p>Under the proposal, most mutual funds would have a current
maximum sales charge of 8.5%. But that cap would include the
12b-1 fees. For example, if a fund had a 6% front-end sales
charge, or load, and annual sales expense of 0.5%, the fund
could assess an investor for that expense amount for five
years, until the total reached 8.5%. It would then no longer
be able to charge an investor for 12b-1 expenses.</p>
<p>Mr. Frischling said he thought the proposal was "very
positive for the industry" because it would cap sales charges
at 8.5%, a rate higher than the level at which most funds are
currently introduced. Most funds unveiled during the past few
years charge fees of 4.5% or less, giving them plenty of
leeway before they would have to stop assessing a typical
annual 12b-1 charge of 0.25%.</p>
<p>But the new set-up could create accounting headaches for
the funds, as they try to determine how much of a fee they
can still charge each investor as years go by. Mr. Frischling
suggested that could raise the funds' accounting expenses.</p>
<p>The NASD decided to rethink its salescharge rules in 1988,
after the Securities and Exchange Commission suggested its
own set of 12b-1 rules.</p>
<p>The SEC agreed to hold off on its rules until the NASD
completed its review. The NASD proposal will be open for
memberfirm comment until May 31, after which it will reviewed
by the NASD board. Then it would be sent to the member firms
for a vote. If they approve the proposal, it will then be
sent to the SEC and for public comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Taylor said he doesn't think the proposal could be
approved before the end of the year. "This is a very major
change involving the mutual-fund industry and the NASD," he
said. "These kind of things aren't settled overnight."</p>

<p>Corrections & Amplifications</p>
<p>MUTUAL FUNDS with sales-related charges called 12b-1 fees
generally couldn't charge investors more than 7.25% of sales,
under a proposal by the National Association of Securities
Dealers. However, investors who hold their shares for a long
time may be forced to pay more than the 7.25% level.
