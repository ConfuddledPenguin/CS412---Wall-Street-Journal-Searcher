	<p class="article-leader">THE SOVIET UNION ORDERED cuts in natural-gas supplies to
Lithuania.
   Moving to enforce a threatened economic embargo to break
the Baltic republic's independence bid, the Soviet government
said that gas supplies would be "sharply reduced," and that
oil and petroleum shipments may also be cut because of
Lithuania's refusal to rescind secession-related laws.
Lawmakers met in Vilnius to discuss the situation, but there
wasn't any indication that the order had been implemented. In
Washington, the U.S. was preparing to delay some dealings
with Moscow, including economic talks, if Lithuania's energy
supplies were reduced.</p>

<p>Researchers have pinpointed a gene that appears to
increase the risk of alcoholism, a condition that afflicts 18

repeated in a larger study.</p>

<p>Bush called for additional research "to sort out the

biggest concentrations in New York and Miami.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court ruled that a state may make the
hallucinogenic drug peyote illegal in all circumstances,

an individual from complying with criminal laws.</p>

<p>South Africa's de Klerk rejected black majority rule, but

area in an attempt to calm rising tensions.</p>

surrender their arms by the time Ortega steps down April 25.</p>

doctrine of spiritual healing is under attack.</p>
