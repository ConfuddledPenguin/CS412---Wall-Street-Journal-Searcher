	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- A drop in energy prices and slower growth in food
costs contributed to a decline in the monthly pace of
consumer price growth in February for the 24 member nations
of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
   The organization said consumer prices rose 0.6% in
February, compared with a rise of 0.8% in January. But for
the 12 months through February, OECD consumer prices rose
6.4%, higher than the 6.2% annual rate recorded in January.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The OECD said a 0.2% decline in energy prices contributed
to the slower February rise, after energy prices grew 1.9% on
average in January. Food prices in February rose 0.9% from
January, about half the rise reported in the previous month.
Excluding food and energy prices, the underlying rate of
inflation in the OECD rose 0.5% in February from January,
compared with 0.3% in January from December.</p>
