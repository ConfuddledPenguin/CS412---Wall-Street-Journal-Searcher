	<p class="article-leader">MAGHREB MIGRATION</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The creation of a special fund to curb massive North
African emigration to Europe seems to be gaining momentum.</p>
<p>The idea was raised last month by Tunisia, current
chairman of the Arab Maghreb Union, an economic association
linking Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia. A
European Community commissioner, now in Tunis, has agreed to
discuss the plan with Maghreb representatives.</p>
<p>The fund, as conceived by the Tunisians, would be financed
in part by debts owed by North African countries to the EC,
and used to promote job creation projects that would keep
more Maghreb workers at home.</p>
<p>EC sources say there were 1,804,000 emigrant workers from
Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia in Western Europe in 1988. It is
estimated there are also upwards of 600,000 illegal
emigrants.</p>
<p>JAPANESE AUTOS</p>
<p>Riding their nation's wave of personal consumption, the
two largest Japanese automobile makers, Toyota Motor Corp.
and Nissan Motor Co., reported record domestic sales in the
fiscal year ended March 31. Toyota's domestic sales rose
16.2% from fiscal 1988 to 2,436,000 vehicles, while Nissan
sold 1,385,000 units in Japan, up 18% from the previous year.</p>
<p>KOREAN HANGINGS</p>
<p>Nine prisoners convicted of murder were hanged in South
Korea yesterday as part of an official campaign to stem
rising crime, Justice Ministry officials announced. They said
the action was intended to show the public that the
government is determined to maintain law and order. The
Justice Ministry listed the number of felonies as 7,590 in
1989, up 13.4% from 1988. The last execution was in August
1989, when seven criminals were hanged.</p>
<p>BERLIN MARKET</p>
<p>Since the Polish zloty became convertible in January, more
than a million Poles have journeyed to West Berlin, one of
the few Western European destinations they can visit without
visas. Many head for the so-called "Polish market," a ragtag
bazaar near central Potsdamer Platz where Poles sell whatever
they can bring from home. They cart to West Berlin everything
from caviar smuggled out of the Soviet Union to fresh eggs
and bacon, untaxed cigarettes and Polish vodka. Sales at this
market have become a crucial source of income for Poles, who
have been hard hit by their own country's attempts to scuttle
a centrally planned economy.</p>
<p>STOLEN ANTIQUITIES</p>
<p>Jordanian police posing as art dealers have recovered a
1,200-year-old mosaic floor ripped from one of Jordan's
desert castles. Thieves stole the 315-square-foot Islamic
mosaic from Qasr al-Hallabat on April 1. The spectacular
robbery has focused attention on the vulnerability of some
5,000 ancient sites scattered over Jordan's 38,000 square
miles. "Jordan is an open-air museum," says Tourism Minister
Abdul-Karim Kabariti. "There is a flourishing demand for
antiquities and in our present economic situation people are
tempted to make money by selling them."</p>
<p>INDONESIAN MAIL</p>
<p>France will provide consultants for a planned postal
service mechanization and automation project at the Jakarta
central post office in Indonesia. Paris will also provide a
soft loan to finance the project, but the amount is still
being negotiated, say Indonesian postal officials.</p>
<p>EAST GERMAN PLAN</p>
<p>As more and more West German companies take up strategic
positions in East Germany, the new East Berlin government is
establishing a cartel office to guard against the threat of
monopolies.</p>
<p>The agency, which is likely to start work today, plans to
spend the next month drafting legislation that will screen
future mergers and joint ventures to ensure they don't stifle
competition in East Germany. The cartel office may also
investigate alliances that have already been formed in recent
months.</p>
<p>The plan underlines growing concern in East Germany that
newly opened markets in key industrial products and financial
services will be usurped by powerful West German
conglomerates before the country's entrepreneurs have a
chance to set up for business independently.</p>
<p>"We will do everything not to let the budding market
economy get trampled upon," an East German official told the
ADN news agency.

<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>A Norwegian porcelain manufacturer is assembling ramps for
ski jumps made of "snow china" -- polished white tiles dotted
with small studs to reduce friction. This means ski-jumping
competitions will be possible even in tropical climes. "I
think the track is very good. The speed is about the same as
snow," says Per Ove Pedersen, jumping manager of the
Norwegian Ski Federation. . . . Five years ago
Czechoslovakia's Communist leaders refused to allow Pope John
Paul II to visit the village that has inspired the country's
Roman Catholics for eight centuries. Now the tiny religious
center of Velehrad, which sits amid the rolling hills of
southern Moravia, is preparing for an influx of up to one
million pilgrims when the Pope finally arrives April 22.</p>
