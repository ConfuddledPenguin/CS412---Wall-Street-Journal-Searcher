	<p class="article-leader">Brisk sales and improved profit margins helped AST
Research Inc. to fiscal third-quarter profit of $9.6 million,
or 78 cents a share. It was a record high for any quarter.
   The Irvine, Calif., personal computer maker posted a loss
of $1.3 million, or 11 cents a share, in the year-earlier
period.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales for the quarter ended March 30 surged 21% to a
record $137.2 million from $113.8 million.</p>
<p>For the nine-month period, AST reported profit of $19.9
million, or $1.65 a share, compared with a loss of $9.9
million, or 86 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales grew 15%
to $382 million from $333.1 million.</p>
<p>AST said its results were aided by gross profit margins
that surged to 33% in the quarter. The company said the
improved margins were the result of brisk sales of its
high-end computers powered by Intel Corp.'s 386
microprocessor, and by a continued drop in the cost of parts
for those systems.</p>
