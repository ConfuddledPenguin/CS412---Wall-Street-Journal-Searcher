	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A ruling prepared by the U.S. Customs
Service denies Nike Inc.'s bid to lower customs fees totaling
millions of dollars a year on its highflying Air Jordan shoe
and related synthetic-leather athletic footwear.
   The fight has been closely watched by major competitors as
well as senators aligned with what remains of the domestic
footwear industry.</p>

Michael Jordan, the high-priced Nike shoe, imported mostly
from Taiwan and South Korea, is one of the company's most
popular models.</p>
<p>A Customs spokesman insisted yesterday that the case is
"pre-decisional." But soon afterward, Sen. Bob Packwood's
office released a copy of the ruling, which had been
forwarded by Commissioner Carol Hallett in a personal letter
to the Oregon lawmaker. The unusual process underscored the
senator's already high profile in the case. Mr. Packwood, the
ranking Republican on the Finance Committee, had lobbied
intensely on behalf of Nike, an Oregon-based company, in a
meeting last month with Customs lawyers and Commissioner
Hallett, and in a letter to Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady.</p>
<p>Nike, which learned of the ruling through Sen. Packwood's
office, has yet to be given the final ruling, according to
Customs, but the company is expected to file an appeal with
the U.S. Court of International Trade. The decision could
require Nike to pay back duties of about $4.5 million on
shoes imported at lower rates, according to company
officials. Nike's Washington counsel estimated the total fees
at stake at $8 million to $9 million.</p>
<p>In designing the new synthetic-leather version of Air
Jordan, Nike had assumed it could lower its customs fees to
6%, but the ruling imposes a zone defense and 20% duty -- or
more than double the cost charged on earlier leather models.
The added expense for Nike amounts to $2.50 to $3 per pair of
shoes, but when multiplied by wholesale and retail markups,
the added cost of the consumer could be $10 on a pair of $125
Air Jordan shoes.</p>
<p>Avia, another Oregon-based importer, has a stake in the
case because of its investments in the same synthetic-leather
material, and the dispute illustrates the mix of new
technologies and old customs laws that influence the fierce
competition between athletic footwear companies. Opposition
to Nike came largely from the Rubber and Plastic Footwear
Manufacturers Association, headed by former Converse Inc.
Vice Chairman John O'Neill. Both Converse and New Balance
provided technical advice in preparing the associations'
arguments to Customs Service officials.</p>
<p>The law at issue dates back to 1963, when Congress sought
to protect domestic manufacturers by imposing a higher 20%
tariff on shoes with a so-called foxing-like band. This is
essentially the strip of rubber that molds a sole to the
shoe's upper, but Nike argued that its new technology is
fundamentally different and not covered by the law.</p>
