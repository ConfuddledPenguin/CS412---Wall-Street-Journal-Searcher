	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Interest rates jumped on news of an unexpected
burst of inflation last month.
   U.S. government bond yields surged to their highest levels
in nearly a year. Long-term Treasury bonds now yield about 8
3/4%, up from 8% at the start of the year. Short-term
interest rates also rose, and several analysts fear further
increases soon.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I think we're headed toward 9% within the next couple of
months," said Roger A. Froehlich, president of Technical
Dimensions Inc., a Mt. Kisco, N.Y.-based bond market
forecasting company. "There's a bias in the market to shrug
off any favorable news and accentuate all the unfavorable
news. Witness what happened today."</p>
<p>Traders were especially startled by a government report
yesterday showing a 0.5% surge in March consumer prices. That
was far above the 0.2% increase that most economists had
expected. Investors also were surprised by a 0.7% increase in
industrial production. That was more than three times as big
an increase as had been generally expected, thus fanning
inflation fears even further. Housing starts fell sharply,
but traders ignored it.</p>
<p>These reports greatly strengthen the case for the Federal
Reserve to begin driving rates slightly higher, especially if
further signs of economic strength emerge, investment
managers said. Some Fed officials already are leaning toward
tighter credit to fight inflation. Others fear the economy
isn't strong enough to withstand significantly higher rates
and thus they have argued for leaving rates where they are
until more economic news is available. But yesterday's
reports, at the very least, dashed what few hopes remained
that the Fed might ease credit soon.</p>
<p>Reaction was swift. Bond prices, which move in the
opposite direction from interest rates, began tumbling as
soon as headlines of the inflation and economic news appeared
on news wires early in the morning. Treasury bonds took the
biggest hit, falling about a point, or $10 for each $1,000
face amount.</p>
<p>"This could be a summer of discontent in the bond market,"
said George R. Mateyo, president and chief executive officer
of Carnegie Capital Management Co., Cleveland.</p>
<p>Many New Yorkers are so caught up in Wall Street's turmoil
and massive layoffs that they are missing the U.S. economy's
overall resilience, Mr. Mateyo said. "I don't know where the
economy is weak," he said. "You go to Boeing in Seattle, or a
grain company in Minneapolis, and they say they're going
great guns."</p>
<p>Thus, he said, this isn't a good time to rush out and buy
long-term bonds. "We've got a lot of cash," he said, "and are
in a defensive posture."</p>
<p>Once again, the bond market's sinking spell caught many
bond investors off guard. Just last week, a survey of 52
fixed-income managers by C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc.
showed more than half were bullish on bonds.</p>
<p>That was the highest bullish reading since the beginning
of this year-providing further evidence of how valuable such
surveys are as contrarian indicators of where bond prices are
heading.</p>
<p>But inflation fears often have proven to be greatly
exaggerated in recent years, and some people think
yesterday's kneejerk reaction was just another overreaction.</p>
<p>"I think it's a great time to buy bonds," said William H.
Gross, managing director at Pacific Investment Management
Co., Newport Beach, Calif. "I think the bad news is over.
It's uphill from here on in for bond prices." He predicted
that the inflation news "is bound to get better," while the
economy "is bound to be slower. So we're basically at the end
of the road for this minibear market that we've experienced"
for the past few months.</p>
<p>"We think the pickup in inflation in the first quarter is
temporary," said Nancy R. Lazar, a senior vice president at
C.J. Lawrence. "There is plenty of anecdotal evidence" that
companies are encountering great difficulties raising prices,
she said. She added: "By year end inflation should be back
down to about 3%."</p>
<p>Ms. Lazar and others argued that the economy isn't nearly
as strong as the latest figures might indicate. Some also
point to the sinking price of gold, which often is viewed as
a barometer of inflation pressures.</p>
<p>The March consumer price increase "overstates the
inflation threat," said Philip Braverman, a senior vice
president at DKB Securities Corp. Nevertheless, he expects
higher interest rates soon.</p>
<p>Besides inflation fears, investors also are worried about
a big wave of Treasury borrowing coming next month. They are
especially concerned because of speculation that Japanese
investors, hurt by Japan's stock-market plunge, won't buy
large amounts of new Treasury debt. Thus, Mr. Braverman
predicted in a report yesterday that Treasury bond yields
"seem likely to reach or slightly exceed 9% before yields top
out and a sustainable rally begins."</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>Unexpectedly bad news on inflation drove Treasury bond
yields to their highest levels since May of last year.</p>
<p>The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bonds were quoted
yesterday afternoon at a yield of 8.72%, up from 8.63%
Monday. The price fell one point to 97 18/32.</p>
<p>The previous high closing yield this year for a bellwether
30-year Treasury bond was 8.71%, reached March 13.</p>
<p>The government's 10-year notes yielded 8.73% yesterday
afternoon, up from 8.66% Monday. Their price fell to 98 3/8
from 98 27/32 Monday.</p>
<p>Rates rose slightly on short-term Treasury bills. For
example, the latest three-month T-bills were quoted late
yesterday at a discount rate of 7.76% to yield 8%. That
compared with an average discount rate of 7.71% set at
Monday's auction, which translated into a bond-equivalent
yield of 7.97%.</p>
<p>Corporate, Junk Issues</p>
<p>The Treasury bond market's woes spilled over into the
corporate market, driving both junk bond and investment-grade
issues lower.</p>
<p>Overall, high-yield, high-risk bonds -- securities with
low credit ratings or no ratings at all -- fell by about 1/4
point. But the notable exceptions to the general market
decline were junk bonds of Resorts International Inc. They
climbed on news that the Atlantic City casino company has
filed a new reorganization plan that is likely to get
bond-holder approval.</p>
<p>Among the high-flyers were Resorts International's 11 3/8%
subordinated sinking fund debentures, due in 2013, which
closed up three points at 20 on light volume on the New York
Stock Exchange. The company's 10% subordinated sinking fund
debentures, due in 1998, also advanced, gaining 1 1/4 to end
at 18, again on light trading.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the junk bond market, Kroger Co. bonds fell
1/2 point after the company reported that its losses narrowed
in the first quarter. Analysts said they had expected more
improvement.</p>
<p>In the investment-grade corporate debt market, long-term
corporate issues fell between 3/4 point and a point.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>For a change, Japanese government bond prices rose
slightly even though the yen continued to slump against the
dollar.</p>
<p>Tokyo traders said the bond market there was strengthened
by speculation that Japan's Finance Ministry will buy
Japanese government bonds to help strengthen the yen. Traders
also pointed to a slowdown in the growth of Japan's money
supply.</p>
<p>Japan's benchmark bonds due 1999 rose to 85.83 as of the
close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange Tuesday, up from 85.79
Monday. The yield fell to 7.39% from 7.405%.</p>
<p>In other major markets, Canadian bond prices tumbled to
their lowest levels of the year.</p>
<p>Canada's bellwether 20-year bond dropped 1 1/4 points to
85.75 to yield 11.27%. That is about 1.80 percentage points
above its level at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>Analysts said inflation fears as well as the high levels
of Canadian short-term interest rates were contributing to
bearish sentiment. Canadian 91-day Treasury bills yield about
13 3/8%, more than two percentage points higher than 20-year
bonds. This is known in bond market jargon as an "inverted
yield curve."</p>
<p>"There is no reason to expect the {Canadian} bond market
to improve any time soon," said Ted Carmichael, senior
economist at Burns Fry Ltd. He said Canadian March consumer
price data, to be reported Friday, is likely to send another
bearish signal to the market. He said Burns Fry is expecting
a rise in the consumer price index of about 0.5% compared
with a 0.6% rise in February.</p>
<p>Municipals</p>
<p>Prospective buyers of municipal securities found the
pickings slim as for the most part investors held onto bonds,
shrugging off the huge downward moves of the U.S. Treasury
market.</p>
<p>Issues were flat to 3/8 point lower in thin dealings.</p>
<p>In one of the largest deals of the day, $274.9 million of
Santa Clara County (Calif.) Traffic Authority sales tax
revenue bonds were tentatively priced by a Morgan Stanley
Inc. group to yield from 6.20% in 1992 to 6.50% in 1995.</p>
<p>Among seasoned dollar bonds, New Jersey Turnpike Authority
7.20% issue of 2018 was off 1/8 at 97 3/8 to 97 1/2 to yield
7.41%.</p>
<p>Mortgage-, Asset-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Mortgage-backed securities ended 5/32 to 10/32 lower but
fared better than did the Treasury market.</p>
<p>Traders said there was moderate buying of mortgage issues
from underwriters seeking collateral for new issues of
derivative mortgage securities, and purchases by
institutional investors seeking the 10% yields on some
pass-through issues.</p>
<p>Government National Mortgage Association 9% securities for
May delivery finished at 95 3/8, down 12/32, after changing
hands between 95 3/32 and 95 26/32.</p>
<p>In the asset-backed market, Chrysler Financial Corp. sold
$609.28 million of securities backed by automobile loans at a
yield of 9.501%, .80 percentage point above the Treasury
two-year note, through First Boston Corp.</p>
<p>The issue was made through Asset-Backed Securities Corp.
7, which purchased the auto loans from Chrysler Financial and
repackaged them as securities for sale to investors.</p>
