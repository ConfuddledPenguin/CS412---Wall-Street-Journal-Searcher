	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Department of Health and Human Services
recommended a 9.9% increase in payments to doctors under the
Medicare program in fiscal 1991.
   Pointing out that Medicare physician payments have risen
12% annually in recent years, HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan
called a target increase of 9.9% in the fiscal year starting
Oct. 1, "a realistic goal for physicians, one consistent with
both the prudent practice of medicine and the necessary
restraint on cost increases."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Last year, Congress passed a law that will overhaul how
doctors are paid under Medicare and, health policy makers
hope, slow the rise in payments. The recommended 9.9%
increase, called a "volume performance standard," is the
administration's calculation of how much the payments to
physicians under Part B of Medicare should rise after taking
account of price increases, the growing number of Medicare
beneficiaries, traditional service volume per beneficiary,
and new technology.</p>
<p>The recommendation, which must be considered by a
commission and by Congress, wouldn't necessarily hold the
rise in payments to doctors to 9.9% next fiscal year. The
restraint could work with a lag, either by slowing the rise
in fees doctors charge or by reducing the volume of service
they provide.</p>
<p>In fiscal 1991, the department estimates that 33.4 million
beneficiaries will receive $44.75 billion in Medicare Part B
payments.</p>
