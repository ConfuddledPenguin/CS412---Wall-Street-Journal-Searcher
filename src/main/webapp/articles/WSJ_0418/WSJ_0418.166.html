	<p class="article-leader">NEW CANAAN, Conn. -- Smith Corona Corp. reported that
fiscal third-quarter net income fell 51%, as sales of its
pricier typewriters and word processors eased.
   Strong demand for lower-priced portable electronic
typewriters continues, but it's not enough to offset slow
high-end sales, said G. Lee Thompson, chairman and chief
executive officer. He cited a sluggish U.S. economy plus
price competition from Asian manufacturers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the third period ended March 31, net fell to $6.1
million, or 20 cents a share, from pro forma net of $12.4
million, or 41 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
Smith Corona went public in August 1989. The year-ago figures
also reflect a charge of five cents a share, stemming from
the company's termination of a performance incentive plan.</p>
<p>Sales dropped 9.1% to $110.6 million from $121.8 million.</p>
<p>Smith Corona's "U.S. market position continues strong, and
we will remain as price competitive as necessary to retain
our leadership position, even at the expense of short-term
earnings," Mr. Thompson said.</p>
<p>He said that Smith-Corona's international business,
especially in Europe, "is very promising." He added that the
company has been able to pare costs and inventories.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Smith Corona fell 50 cents to close at $9.125.</p>
