	<p class="article-leader">STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A New York woman's surprise
decision not to contest attempted murder charges abruptly
ended a trial that promised to shed light on the increasingly
bitter and sometimes violent battle between animal-rights
activists and corporations that experiment on animals.
   Fran Trutt, of Queens, N.Y., pleaded no contest in
Superior Court in Stamford Monday to charges of attempted
murder, possession of explosives and bomb manufacturing in
exchange for a one-year prison sentence.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ms. Trutt had been accused of trying to kill Leon C.
Hirsch, chairman and chief executive officer of U.S. Surgical
Corp., by planting a sophisticated pipe bomb near his company
parking space in November 1988. Her arrest threw a spotlight
on the animal-rights movement and the extent to which some
activists would go to protect animals from the corporate lab.
