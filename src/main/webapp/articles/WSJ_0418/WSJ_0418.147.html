	<p class="article-leader">NCR Corp. surprised investors in posting a 15% decline in
net income for the first quarter on flat sales, driving the
stock down sharply in heavy trading.
   The big computer maker, based in Dayton, Ohio, said profit
slumped to $52 million, or 73 cents a share, from the
year-earlier $61 million, or 77 cents a share, on a much
higher base of shares outstanding.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Revenue edged up just 1.2% to $1.27 billion from $1.25
billion.</p>
<p>Analysts attributed the poor results to stiff price
competition and a broad shift toward smaller computers, with
razor-thin profit margins. This shift "is a consistent theme
across the industry," Patricia Laupheimer, an analyst at
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said. She noted that even
International Business Machines Corp., which reported
better-than-expected results Monday, has seen its margins
shrink in the shift toward smaller, more powerful computers.</p>
<p>The NCR earnings news ignited strong selling of the
company's shares, which had been one of the best-performing
computer stocks during the first quarter. In New York Stock
Exchange composite trading yesterday, NCR shares plunged
$5.375, to close at $65.375, slashing the company's market
value by 7.6%. With volume of more than 2.1 million shares,
NCR was the most active issue on the Big Board.</p>
<p>"People were looking for a lot more than they got. No one
was ready for a down quarter," Jay P. Stevens, an analyst at
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said. "It was a real jolt."</p>
<p>Investors ignored the good news: NCR said it had record
orders during the quarter. Wall Street focused instead on the
falling margins and the company's cautious outlook for the
second quarter.</p>
<p>NCR said first-quarter orders "showed a substantial gain"
from a year earlier, including higher U.S. orders and sharply
higher international orders, led by Pacific Rim nations.</p>
<p>NCR's chairman and chief executive officer, Charles E.
Exley, said he was pleased with the strong order performance,
but added, "We continue to be concerned about the competitive
pressure on gross margins."</p>
<p>"With continuing good order performance, and emphasis on
cost control, we still see the opportunity to achieve
single-digit revenue and earnings growth for the full year,"
Mr. Exley said.</p>
<p>Also contributing to the lower earnings for the first
quarter was NCR's aggressive stock buy-back program, which
had a positive effect on per-share earnings but hurt net
income because of lower interest income. NCR said it bought
back 1.6 million shares, at an average price of $67.50, in
the first quarter. The company had an average of 70.9 million
shares outstanding in the latest period, compared with 79.7
million a year earlier.</p>
<p>The poor results prompted many analysts to cut their
earnings estimates for the current quarter and the year. Mr.
Stevens of Dean Witter reduced his 1990 estimate to $5.75 a
share from $6.05, and forecast flat second-quarter net of
$1.42 a share. Steve Milunovich of First Boston Corp. cut his
second-quarter estimate to $1.35 a share from $1.55.</p>
<p>In the 1989 second quarter, NCR earned $110 million, or
$1.42 a share, and had 1989 profit of $412 million, or $5.38
a share.</p>
<p>Some analysts suggested that investors were overreacting.
"This is a well-run company with marvelous long-term
prospects," Peter Labe of Labe, Simpson & Co. said. He called
NCR's latest earnings results "a short-term ripple -- buy
into it, and be patient for a few months."</p>
