	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Japan plans to issue new 100,000-yen (US$627)
gold coins in November to commemorate Emperor Akihito's
coronation, taking special measures to prevent
counterfeiting, the Finance Ministry said.
   Japan issued 11 million gold coins four years ago to
commemorate then Emperor Hirohito's 60th year of reign.
Hirohito died in January 1989 after a reign of 62 years.
Authorities have since found 100,000 fake coins based on that
commemorative issue.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A ministry official said the content of pure gold in the
new coins would be increased and a special process employed
to put a luster with a complicated design on the surface of
the coins to prevent forgeries.</p>
<p>The amount of pure gold in the coins would be 30 grams,
compared with 20 grams for coins issued in 1986 and 1987. The
smaller gold content in the earlier coins was one of the
factors behind the counterfeit coins, said the official, who
asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>The 30 grams of pure gold is valued at about 60,000 yen,
the official said.</p>
