	<p class="article-leader">CIRCLE K Corp. (Phoenix, Ariz.) -- Moody's Investors
Service Inc. said it downgraded to Ca from Caa its rating on
about $449 million of subordinated debt issued by this
convenience-store chain. The rating concern said it took the
action after Circle K missed an interest payment earlier this
week on $125 million of senior subordinated debt. Moody's
also said it expects that Circle K interest payments due in
May and June on other subordinated debt issues won't be paid.
In addition, Circle K's pending offer to exchange all of its
subordinated debt for securities that will be significantly
below the par value of the issues outstanding would result in
a permanent impairment of the bonds' value, Moody's said.</p>
