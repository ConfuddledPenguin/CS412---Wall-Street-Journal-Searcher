	<p class="article-leader">Warner Bros. said it will prohibit movie theaters from
running commercials when they are showing Warner Bros.
releases.
   The ban makes Warner the second major studio to go on the
offensive against commercials in theaters, a growing but
controversial form of advertising. In February, Walt Disney
Co. introduced a similar ban, citing moviegoers' resentment
of "commercial intrusions" in theaters.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Warner, a unit of Time Warner, said the ban will take
effect with its film, "Gremlins 2: The New Batch," which is
to open May 18 on 2,000 screens nationwide.</p>
<p>"We feel it's an imposition on the film patron," said
Barry Reardon, president of domestic distribution at Warner.
"In justice to our creative people and the people who make
our movies, the movies should be shown" without ads.</p>
<p>Warner last weekend had its movies -- "Driving Miss
Daisy," "Joe Versus the Volcano" and "Impulse," among others
-- on about 2,500 screens.</p>
<p>Mr. Reardon said Warner will continue to run some public
service advertisements before its films, but "once the lights
go down, we don't want any commercial advertising."</p>
<p>Executives at firms that sell and distribute commercials
for movie theaters reacted angrily. "I'm quite dismayed that
Warner would follow this ill-conceived policy of Disney's,"
said Terry Laughren, chairman of Screenvision Cinema Network,
which is based in New York.</p>
<p>"I don't understand why they're taking an action that will
adversely affect" theater owners, Mr. Laughren said. He added
that Screenvision, which distributes ads for Kodak and
General Motors, among others, sends out checks totaling
"millions of dollars" to theater owners every year for
showing its ads.</p>
<p>About half of the nation's 23,000 first-run theaters show
advertising.</p>
<p>Mr. Laughren also discounted a study released by Disney
last week that showed that the vast majority of surveyed
moviegoers don't want commercials to be shown in theaters.
Mr. Laughren disputed that, citing his company's research
that shows almost all moviegoers approving of Screenvision's
ads.</p>
<p>With two of Hollywood's major studios now banning theater
commercials, some observers believe a trend may be in the
works. "The audience feedback is there -- audiences are
booing and hissing," says A.D. Murphy, who track box-office
results for Variety.</p>
<p>Officials at other major film studios, including MCA's
Universal and Columbia Pictures, declined to comment.</p>
<p>Unlike Disney, most of the major studios also have
interests in movie theaters. Warner is a major theater owner
through a joint venture with Paramount, and MCA is the
biggest shareholder in Cineplex Odeon, one of the largest
movie chains, which shows commercials on almost all its 1,300
U.S. screens.</p>
<p>The largest U.S. theater owner, United Artists
Entertainment Co., shows some onscreen commercials for
Coca-Cola Co., but has increasingly been advertising on video
monitors in the lobbies of its theaters. Of the Warner
restrictions, a spokesman says, "to the extent that it's
required, we'll comply."</p>
<p>Some movie theater chains already prohibit commercials,
including General Cinema, Loews and National Amusements, a
unit of Viacom. But those theaters are the exception. Other
theater owners have been increasingly willing to accept ads,
following the lead of European theaters, where commercials
have been shown without controversy for years.</p>

<p>Saatchi Considers Shift</p>
<p>Saatchi & Saatchi is considering a management shakeup that
would streamline the holding company's staff and move three
executive directors to operating posts, industry executives
said.</p>
<p>Within the next few months, Saatchi is likely to shift
Jeremy Sinclair, Terry Bannister and Roy Warman into
operating roles within the company's communications business,
an individual familiar with the company said. Mr. Sinclair
currently is Saatchi's deputy chairman, while Messrs.
Bannister and Warman are co-chief executives of Saatchi's ad
business.</p>
<p>The anticipated changes stem from Saatchi's effort to sell
its troubled consulting businesses, and from the company's
appointment last year of Robert LouisDreyfus as chief
executive and Charles Scott as finance director. As a result,
the need for other senior executives to work on corporate
matters has diminished. Saatchi officials declined to
comment.</p>

<p>Ad Note. . . .</p>
<p>NEW ACCOUNT: MGM Grand Air, El Segundo, Calif., awarded
its ad account to Lintas:Campbell-Ewald, Warren, Mich., which
is part of Interpublic Group. Billings weren't disclosed. The
account was previously handled at Shalek Agency, Santa
Monica, Calif.</p>

<p>VIACOM Inc. is approximately 84% owned by National
Amusements Inc. Yesterday's advertising column misstated the
relationship between the two companies.</p>
