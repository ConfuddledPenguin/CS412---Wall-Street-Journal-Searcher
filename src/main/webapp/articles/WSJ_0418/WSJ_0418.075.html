	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- Canada and the U.S. are negotiating an agreement
to end a string of dangerous clashes between Canadian patrol
boats and U.S. fishermen.
   The clashes have occurred mainly in the Georges Bank area,
a big fishing ground in the Gulf of Maine.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The proposed agreement would make it illegal under U.S.
law for U.S. fishermen to fish in Canadian waters. It also
would make it illegal under Canadian law for Canadians to
fish in U.S. waters.</p>
<p>The poaching problem has become more acute since a 1984
World Court boundary ruling gave Canada some rich fishing
grounds in the Georges Bank region that had been traditional
fishing areas for U.S. vessels.</p>
<p>Some U.S. fishermen who have been caught in Canadian
waters have tried to outrun Canadian patrol boats. The
severest penalty they currently face in the U.S. is a $10,000
fine for importing illegal goods, which often is less than
the proceeds they obtain from the catch. If Canadian patrol
boats catch them, they can face fines of up to 750,000
Canadian dollars (US$641,700) and a possible jail term.</p>
<p>U.S. fishermen claim Canadian patrol boats have tried to
cripple their vessels by fouling their propellers with cables
and by shooting water down their smoke stacks. Canadian
patrol boats also have allegedly rammed some fishing boats.</p>
<p>No one has been seriously injured in a chase yet but the
clashes have been a concern particularly since Canadian
patrol boats were fitted with guns three years ago. Canadians
have fired warning shots near fleeing U.S. fishing boats
twice. On another occasion permission to fire was requested
from Ottawa but denied.</p>
<p>Last December, a Canadian destroyer fired shots across the
bow of a U.S. scallop dragger. The destroyer chased the
scalloper for eight hours and collided with it three times
before the scalloper managed to escape to a U.S. port.</p>
<p>"There definitely is the potential for catastrophe," in
Georges Bank said Jeffrey Pike, a spokesman for Rep. Gerry
Studds, the head of the U.S. House of Representatives
subcommittee on fisheries. Mr. Studds believes a reciprocal
enforcement of fisheries laws would enable U.S. fishermen to
"fish without fear of being shot at or rammed or spied on."</p>
<p>Under the proposed new agreement, U.S. fishermen would
face fines of up to $100,000 and could have their fishing
licences revoked.</p>
<p>Some Canadians oppose the proposed agreement. The U.S. "is
the enemy," said William Rompkey, a Canadian Member of
Parliament. It isn't "reasonable" to "depend on them to
prosecute their own people," he said.</p>
<p>Canadian and U.S. officials predict they will reach an
enforcement accord by autumn.</p>
