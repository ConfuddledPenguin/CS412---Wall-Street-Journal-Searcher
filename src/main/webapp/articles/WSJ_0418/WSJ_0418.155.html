	<p class="article-leader">Citizens & Southern Corp. indicated that results of a
federal bank examination may cause it to take a charge
against first-quarter earnings to offset possible loan
losses.
   The Atlanta-based banking concern wouldn't specify the
potential increase in its loan-loss reserve or the actual
loan losses for the period. But it said that "because of
weakened conditions within commercial real estate markets
since year-end and comparable actions taken following the
{Office of the Comptroller of the Currency} exam at other
banks, increases in nonperforming loans are expected."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>John J. Mason, an analyst at Interstate/Johnson Lane Inc.,
estimated recently that Citizens' problem loans may rise by
about $70 million. The report didn't rule out, however, a
$100 million increase. This would prompt an rise in the
company's loan-loss reserve and subsequently reduce
first-quarter earnings to about 44 cents a share, Mr. Mason
said. In the 1989 first quarter, Citizens had a profit of
$57.8 million, or 90 cents a share.</p>
<p>Citizens said it will delay release of its first-quarter
earnings results until the special examination of its
commercial real estate portfolio is completed.</p>
