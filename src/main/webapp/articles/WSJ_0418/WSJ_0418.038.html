	<p class="article-leader">BRUSSELS -- Output of crude steel by companies in 35
nations, including the U.S., Japan and West European
countries, fell 1.5% in March to 41.8 million metric tons
from 42.4 million tons a year earlier, the International Iron
and Steel Institute said.
   A metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds. The U.S.
led the decline in production, with output falling 4% to 7.8
million metric tons. This decline and a 5.9% drop in steel
production in 21 other countries offset a rise in European
Community nations and Japan; EC output rose 2.4% to 12.6
million metric tons, and Japanese production increased 2% to
9.2 million tons.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the first quarter, steel output of the 35 nations
eased 2.5% to 119.7 million metric tons from 122.9 million
tons a year earlier. The countries included in the steel
institute's monthly survey accounted for 61.6% of world steel
production in 1989 and for 97.2% of world output, excluding
the Soviet Union and other East European countries, China and
North Korea.</p>
