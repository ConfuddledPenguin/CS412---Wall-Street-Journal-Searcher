	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Unicorp American Corp., reporting sharply
wider losses of $53 million and $96 million for the 1989
fourth quarter and full year, respectively, said it was
trying to restructure a loan agreement that is already in
default.
   Even if those talks succeed, the troubled real-estate and
financial-services concern said, it can't continue operations
for the next 12 months without an infusion of $15 million in
new funds.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The mounting problems will force Price Waterhouse to
express on Unicorp American's year-end financial statements
"substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as
a going concern," Unicorp said.</p>
<p>The per-share loss in the fourth quarter was $3.06. A year
earlier, the company had a net loss of $1.7 million, or 10
cents a share. Revenue rose 3% to $64.9 million from $63
million. The 1988 figures were restated, although it was
unclear why. The number on the company's news release has
been disconnected, according to a phone company recording.</p>
<p>For all of 1989, the loss per share totaled $5.61. A year
earlier, Unicorp had a net loss of $8.7 million, or 57 cents
a share. Revenue increased 9.4% to $263.1 million from $240.5
million.</p>
<p>In the negotiations with its bank lenders, which Unicorp
didn't name, the company is seeking a waiver of certain
covenants in the loan agreement, it said. It also is trying
to get an extension of the loan's expiration date beyond
August.</p>
<p>Assuming that the banks extend the loan agreement, Unicorp
said, "the company believes that it will need at least $15
million in additional funds to continue its operations . . .
for the next 12 months." It said it is talking with the
lenders and its Canadian parent about the additional
financial needs.</p>
