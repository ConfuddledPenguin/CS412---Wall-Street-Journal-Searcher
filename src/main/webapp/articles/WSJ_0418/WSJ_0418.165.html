	<p class="article-leader">Safeway Stores Inc. said first-quarter net income surged
71% as a result of improved gross margins and a decline in
interest expense.
   The Oakland, Calif., supermarket chain posted profit of
$15.5 million, or 17 cents a share, up from $8.8 million, or
12 cents a share, a year earlier. Safeway had 88.2 million
shares outstanding in the 1990 quarter ended March 24,
compared with 79.7 million a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Safeway said revenue for the quarter grew about 3% to
$3.34 billion from $3.23 billion. The company said the
increase came despite the fact that the important Easter
shopping period occurred this year after the close of the
quarter.</p>
<p>Safeway attributed its improved margins to the addition of
profitable speciality departments in numerous stores, an
aggressive merchandising campaign and a streamlining of its
companywide buying practices. Safeway also said its interest
expense fell 6% in the quarter to $83.8 million from $89.2
million a year earlier.</p>
<p>Safeway has been closely held since 1986, when it was
taken private in a $4.3 billion leveraged buy-out by Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts & Co. The company recently announced plans to
go public again by offering 10 million, or 10%, of its shares
later this month.</p>
