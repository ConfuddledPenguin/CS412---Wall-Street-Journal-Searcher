	<p class="article-leader">Pirelli Tyre Holding N.V., a Dutch tire maker, said its
1989 profit rose 7.8% to 206 million guilders ($108.9
million) from 191 million guilders a year earlier.
   Sales rose 14% to 6.7 billion guilders from 5.9 billion
guilders.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Pirelli said it expects a more modest growth rate in sales
this year, foreseeing "marginal growth of the global tire
market and sustained growth in the premium car and all-steel
truck tire segments. Given {Pirelli's} strong and increasing
presence in those segments, the company is confident that a
sales growth of well over 5% can be achieved."</p>
<p>Pirelli said that because of increased price competition,
it expects its 1990 profit to be about the same as that for
1989.</p>
<p>The company will propose a cash dividend of two guilders a
share, or a total payout of 93 million guilders, leaving
Pirelli with 113.4 million guilders in profit to be retained.</p>
