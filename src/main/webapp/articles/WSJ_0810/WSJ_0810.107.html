	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. ended
its three-year run as a public company by proceeding with a
merger into American Express Co., but not before shareholders
got in their last licks at a final annual meeting.
   At the meeting, held in the American Express Tower here,
about 92% of shares voting approved the previously announced
merger into American Express, which had sold a minority stake
in Shearson to the public in 1987. The outcome wasn't in
question; American Express already owned about 60% of
Shearson's common shares outstanding.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Though it had long wanted to reduce its Shearson holding
rather than expand it, American Express is absorbing Shearson
as part of a major effort -- including a cash infusion of
more than $1 billion -- to revive the big securities firm's
sagging fortunes. Shearson holders will get 0.48 of an
American Express share for each Shearson share.</p>
<p>Shearson's new chairman and chief executive officer,
Howard L. Clark Jr., said he is "optimistic" about his firm's
prospects now that it is a wholly owned subsidiary of
American Express. Despite enormous challenges, "the longtime
Shearson spirit is very much alive," Mr. Clark said.</p>
<p>Some individual investors didn't let Mr. Clark get off
that easy, however.</p>
<p>One investor groused about the plunge of Shearson's stock
price from its initial offering at $34 a share three years
ago to $12.75 currently. "Something certainly is wrong,"
either with the initial-offering price or the present one,
the investor complained.</p>
<p>Mr. Clark responded: "There certainly is something wrong
with the current situation. We lost $915 million in the first
quarter of this year." But he said Shearson is working to
correct its profit problems.</p>
<p>In response to a question, Mr. Clark also said the firm's
legal costs are too high, and said he wanted to cut down the
number of lawsuits and arbitration cases the firm faces.</p>
<p>There were also gripes about inaccurate account statements
(a problem Mr. Clark says is being worked on), and about
untimely responses to investors' complaints (also being
worked on, said Mr. Clark). One investor said it would be a
good idea if Shearson directors, which include former
President Gerald Ford and actress Dina Merrill, traveled more
to branch offices to get to know the company. "Now that
Shearson will be 100%-owned by a travel company, I think
we'll get around," Mr. Clark said, drawing guffaws.</p>
<p>The chairman said Shearson has attained a 12.5% share of
the individual-investor market this year, up 1%.</p>
<p>As part of Shearson's huge retrenchment program, he said,
the firm is still in the process of selling off the
properties and paying off the loans of its Balcor Co.
real-estate unit based in Skokie, Ill., a wind-down that Mr.
Clark said should take "three to four" years.</p>
