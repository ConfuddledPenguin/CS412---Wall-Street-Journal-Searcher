	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- Bechtel Group Inc. said it is continuing
operations and keeping business offices open, while providing
charter flights from Saudi Arabia to London for any employees
or family members who wish to leave.
   In Saudi Arabia, Bechtel, a privately held
engineering-construction concern, has an $80 billion
petrochemical complex under construction in the industrial
city of Jubail, 150 miles from the Kuwaiti border, and is
working on the King Fahd International Airport construction
project. Some 1,200 employees are employed on the two
projects.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A company spokesman said that one chartered airliner with
about 100 people left Saudi Arabia late Wednesday night and
arrived in London early yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Two planeloads of Bechtel employees or their family
members -- about 200 people -- have left since the company
began providing transport. Others have left on commercial
flights booked by the company.</p>
<p>The company, which has worked on projects in the Middle
East for nearly 50 years, said it is monitoring the situation
on a 24-hour basis and receiving information and advice from
the U.S. State Department and the British Foreign Service.</p>
