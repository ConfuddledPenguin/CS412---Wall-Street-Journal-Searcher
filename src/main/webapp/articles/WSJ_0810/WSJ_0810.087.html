	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Lever Brothers Co. said it has agreed to use
10 million pounds of recycled plastic annually in its bottles
for such liquid household products as Wisk laundry detergent
and Snuggle fabric softener.
   Lever Brothers has agreed to purchase 50% of the output of
a new plastics recycling facility owned by Sonoco Graham Co.,
one of the nation's largest producers of the type of
high-density plastics used in the bottles. The Sonoco Graham
recycling facility, in York, Pa., is scheduled to start
producing the resins in September.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Lever, a unit of Unilever Group, an Anglo-Dutch consumer
products company, in June began filling bottles that contain
some recycled resins. The new agreement with Sonoco Graham
will accelerate those efforts. By mid-1991, the company
predicts 50% of all its bottles will contain between 25% and
35% recycled plastic.</p>
<p>Environmentalists have applauded these efforts. Said Sam
Hartwell, a research associate at the Natural Resources
Defense Council, "Creating demand for recovered materials is
an important step in encouraging consumers and municipalities
to recycle."</p>
<p>But with consumers' interest in environmental protection
soaring, competitive pressures also play a big role. Procter
& Gamble Co. already has announced plans to package liquid
laundry detergents in bottles made partly from recycled
plastic. Colgate-Palmolive Co. also plans to use recycled
plastics in bottles of dishwashing liquids.</p>
