	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Western Union Corp. reported a widened
second-quarter loss amid mounting debt problems and contract
negotiations with its biggest union.
   The company, which has been struggling to recapitalize its
huge debt load and avoid bankruptcy proceedings, posted a
loss of $27.6 million, or 44 cents a share, compared with a
loss of $4.9 million, or 40 cents a share, a year earlier.
Furthermore, the company missed a $11.6 million preferred
dividend payment. But a proposal to reclassify its preferred
shares into common would eliminate its unpaid preferred
dividends, currently totaling $69.8 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Second-quarter revenue eased to $146 million from $159
million.</p>
<p>For the six months, Western Union had a loss of $45.7
million, or 81 cents a share, compared with $5.1 million, or
72 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue slipped to $291
million from $317 million.</p>
<p>The 1989 revenue figures included $4 million for the
second quarter and $8 million for the six months from
services which are no longer provided by Western Union.</p>
<p>The second-quarter loss was based on a weighted average of
89.1 million shares outstanding versus 44.4 million last
year. The six-month loss was based on a weighted average of
84.9 million shares outstanding versus 43.5 million. The
increase came mainly from conversions of Western Union Class
B convertible preferred shares into common shares during the
past 12 months.</p>
<p>The company attributed its losses to some $29 million in
quarterly interest payments on $640 million in debt. The
second-quarter loss also included $5.4 million of costs
associated with Western Union's proposed recapitalization
plan. These included legal and printing fees and payments to
its investment advisers, Merrill Lynch & Co. and Donaldson,
Lufkin & Jenrette.</p>
<p>Moreover, the results included $5.6 million from
settlement of claims relating to the purchase in 1987 of ITT
World Communications Inc., $5 million from termination of a
pension plan, and $6 million of restructuring charges.</p>
<p>A spokesman said that if the costs and restructuring
charges were eliminated, Western Union would have shown a
$22.2 million profit in the 1990 second quarter compared with
a $9.5 million profit in the like 1989 period.</p>
<p>"Both of our businesses (business services and financial
services) are operating profitably," the spokesman said. "But
the corporate interest expense is so high that it's
offsetting those profits."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Western Union continues to negotiate a new
three-year contract with the Communications Workers of
America, covering about 2,500 workers. The previous contract
expired last Monday.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Western
Union closed at 42 cents a share, up three cents.</p>
