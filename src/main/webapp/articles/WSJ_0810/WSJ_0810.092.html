	<p class="article-leader">George Gillett, whose broadcast and resort properties are
burdened with $983 million of debt, has missed a
bond-interest payment and is trying to restructure his debts.
   Mr. Gillett's financial travails are described in a
confidential memo to Gillett Holdings Inc. bondholders,
seeking their approval for a proposed series of exchanges of
Gillett bonds for cash and new securities.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the memo, Denver-based Gillett Holdings said it
defaulted Aug. 1 on an interest payment due on its 12 5/8%
senior subordinated debentures. The company also said it
"doesn't believe it can find necessary financing to sustain
its operations and to refinance its maturing indebtedness."</p>
<p>Mr. Gillett didn't return telephone calls yesterday. A
Gillett Holdings spokesman said: "The company isn't at
liberty to comment because of confidentiality agreements with
various parties."</p>
<p>This isn't Mr. Gillett's first brush with default. Last
fall, SCI Television Inc., a broadcasting company that he
controlled along with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., was
unable to pay certain bond obligations. After months of talks
and threats by bondholders to put the company under
bankruptcy-law protection, SCI Television restructured its
debt. As part of the settlement, Mr. Gillett agreed to slash
his share of SCI Television's equity to 40% from 55%.</p>
<p>In its memo to bondholders, closely held Gillett Holdings
painted a bleak financial picture. It said it had a $37
million loss for 1989 and a $34 million loss in 1990's first
quarter. The company operates ski resorts in Vail, Colo.,
owns television stations in Baltimore; Tampa, Fla., and two
California towns, and runs a meatpacking plant.</p>
<p>"This is a credit that needs to be restructured," said Ben
Bendre, a junk-bond analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. "The
company's debt in relation to its cash flow is too high."</p>
<p>Bondholders, however, complained that little of the brunt
of the proposed restructuring would fall on Mr. Gillett. In
the memo to bondholders, Mr. Gillett didn't propose any
reduction in his 100% ownership of Gillett Holdings. Instead,
he asked various bondholders to accept cash and new
securities valued at anywhere from 27 cents to 78 cents for
each dollar of the bond's current stated value.</p>
<p>Stan Phelps, a bondholder activist who was active in the
fight over SCI Television's restructuring, said it was
"absurd" for Mr. Gillett to seek to keep all his equity while
proposing that bondholders accept losses. Mr. Phelps,
president of S.N. Phelps & Co., said he doesn't currently own
any Gillett Holdings bonds.</p>
<p>Other bondholders, though, said the proposed terms of the
Gillett Holdings swap may be about as good as they can hope
for. Yesterday, traders were quoting the company's 13 7/8%
subordinated debentures at just 17 cents to 19 cents on the
dollar. Gillett Holdings, meanwhile, is offering some holders
27 cents on the dollar for those bonds.</p>
<p>Similarly, the company's 12 5/8% bonds, on which Gillett
Holdings failed to make a $15.8 million interest payment on
Aug. 1, were quoted yesterday at about 25 cents on the
dollar. The company has a 10day grace period in which to make
the interest payment, but referred to the bonds as
"defaulted" in its memo to the bondholders.</p>
<p>Gillett Holdings is offering some holders of the 12 5/8%
bonds 37 cents on the dollar for those bonds. "Most
bondholders are hoping this deal goes through," said one
bondholder who declined to be identified.</p>
<p>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., which underwrote Gillett
Holdings' bonds, collapsed early this year. In its proposed
restructuring, Gillett Holdings is being advised by Smith
Barney, Harris Upham & Co., which hired much of Drexel's
restructuring team.</p>
<p>Investors familiar with Gillett Holdings' proposed swap
offer said they believed it was being offered "selectively"
to some of Gillett Holdings' larger bondholders.</p>
<p>Because it has fewer than 300 bondholders, Gillett
Holdings isn't subject to Securities and Exchange Commission
rules requiring that tender offers be made to all holders. In
its memo to bondholders, Gillett Holdings indicates that it
wants to swap 30% to 90% of various classes of bonds, while
leaving the rest outstanding.</p>
<p>Gillett Holdings said it has an agreement to sell its
Baltimore television station to Scripps-Howard Broadcasting
Co. for $154.7 million, generating cash that will help pay
down its debt.</p>
<p>Otherwise, though, it's unclear how much progress Gillett
Holdings has made in dealing with its debt burden. Several
bondholders said they were told recently by the company's
advisers that "two-thirds" of bondholders had agreed to the
swap. On Wednesday, however, Gillett Holdings extended its
deadline for the swap through the close of business today,
suggesting that it doesn't yet have all the approvals needed.</p>
