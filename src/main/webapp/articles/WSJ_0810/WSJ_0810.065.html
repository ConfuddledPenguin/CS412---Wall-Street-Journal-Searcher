	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it is
reviewing for possible downgrade about $4.5 billion of
triple-A rated mortgage-backed securities issued by 19
thrifts.
   The review affects only those securities sold at a slight
market discount from par and issued by thrifts that aren't
rated investment grade by Moody's. A total of 33
interest-bearing mortgage-backed bonds and medium-term notes
are affected. Blanton Neill, an assistant vice president in
Moody's structured finance group, said the securities are
mostly held by institutional investors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Some of the issuing thrifts are insolvent, Ms. Neill said.
She said the ratings service believes there is a possibility
that others may become insolvent. Among the insolvent issuers
are Columbia Savings & Loan Association, CenTrust Federal
Savings Bank, Imperial Savings Association and Anchor Savings
Bank FSB, Ms. Neill said.</p>
<p>Moody's said it is concerned that the federal Resolution
Trust Corp. might change the terms of the securities. In
June, the RTC repudiated the indentures and took early
redemption of $3.8 billion of interest-bearing
mortgage-backed bonds issued by Franklin Savings Association
in Kansas. In that case, Moody's said, investors received the
original discounted price, plus accrued interest through the
payment date, plus a calculated amortization of the discount
from par. Moody's said it's concerned the same thing may
happen to the 33 issues under review.</p>
<p>Thus the actual payments to Franklin investors were
slightly less than if the RTC, the government's
thrift-bailout agency, had paid the full principal at par,
plus accrued interest, as provided for in the indentures if
the bonds were redeemed early or payments accelerated. Ms.
Neill said the RTC has the authority to repudiate the
indentures, the agreements between issuer and buyer.</p>
<p>"The question we're focusing on is if the RTC redeems a
bond early, does it pay the same redemption price that the
indenture indicated would be paid in the event of an
aceleration." She added that "nothing in the documents on
which we based the rating indicated the redemptions would be
less than par." Although she said the RTC policy is evolving,
the agency hasn't made an official statement on how it plans
to redeem the securities. But she said its action on the
Franklin Savings securities and other indications "leads us
to believe" that if the RTC redeems other such securities
they will so at a discount to par.</p>
