	<p class="article-leader">Despite better-than-expected sales of television sets,
N.V. Philips posted a sharp drop in second-quarter earnings,
and the Dutch electronics company reaffirmed that it expects
a huge loss for the full year.
   Net profit plunged 84% to 37 million guilders ($21
million), or 13 Dutch cents a share, from 235 million
guilders ($131 million), or 91 Dutch cents a share, a year
earlier. The drop reflects red ink from the computer and
semiconductor operations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts, however, had forecast a small loss for the
quarter.</p>
<p>Sales in the latest quarter edged down to 13.54 billion
guilders from 13.55 billion guilders. Net in the year-earlier
quarter included an extraordinary gain of 38 million
guilders.</p>
<p>In early July, Philips's new chairman, Jan Timmer,
announced plans to cut 10,000 jobs, or about 3.5% of the
company's world-wide total, and to make provisions for 2.7
billion guilders of restructuring costs, to be recorded in
the second half. Those provisions will leave the company with
a loss of about two billion guilders for all of 1990, Philips
forecast.</p>
<p>Some analysts have predicted that Philips won't pay a
dividend this year, but a spokesman said no decision has been
made on that question. He said it would depend on progress of
the company's cost-cutting moves and the general course of
business.</p>
<p>Eleanor Buss, an analyst at Robert Fleming Securities,
predicted yesterday that Philips would pay a dividend,
particularly because many of its shareholders are retired
people who rely on the income. Dorian Foyil of UBS Phillips &
Drew Securities said he expects Philips to reduce its
dividend by about 50% from last year's two guilders per share
and to pay it in the form of shares rather than cash.</p>
<p>For the first half, net profit slipped 19% to 373 million
guilders, or 1.34 guilders a share, from 458 million
guilders, or 1.77 guilders a share. The latest period's net
included 330 million guilders of extraordinary gains, mostly
from the sale of defense units, compared with 38 million
guilders of gains a year before. Before extraordinary items,
profit plunged 90% to 43 million guilders from 420 million
guilders, partly because of higher financing costs.</p>
<p>Sales in the half rose 1% to 26.36 billion guilders from
26.2 billion guilders. After stripping out the effects of
currency changes and asset sales, sales were up 8%, the
company said.</p>
<p>Operating profit at the consumer products division in the
first half surged 73% to 825 million guilders, and sales rose
11% to 11.48 billion guilders. The company said June's World
Cup soccer championship spurred sales of television sets and
video recorders.</p>
<p>In the lighting division, long regarded as Philips's
strong point, operating profit dropped 19% to 327 million
guilders on a 6% decline in sales to 3.54 billion guilders.
The company said prices were pushed down by "fierce
competition" in Europe and the U.S. but "remained at an
acceptable level." A spokesman said the division also was
hurt by a slowdown in the construction industry.</p>
<p>The professional products and systems division showed an
operating loss of 126 million, compared with profit of 85
million guilders a year earlier. Sales declined 13% to 6.13
billion guilders.</p>
<p>The division includes telecommunications,
medical-electronics and computer equipment and other items.
Philips said all lines in the division showed improvement,
except for computers, which produced a major loss. Analysts
estimated the loss at more than 250 million guilders. Philips
has announced plans to scale back computer operations,
focusing on assembling systems from standardized products and
on serving certain segments of the market, such as financial
companies.</p>
<p>Philips's other major problem area, components, showed an
operating loss of 59 million guilders, compared with a profit
of 4 million guilders. Sales were flat at 4.2 billion
guilders. The company said its loss on integrated circuits
was slightly smaller than a year earlier but that results
from color-television picture tubes and other electronic
components deteriorated, mainly because of adverse
exchange-rate movements.</p>
<p>The company said its results also were hurt by Brazil's
economic austerity program. Latin America accounted for 18%
of Philips's operating profit last year, and Brazil is by far
the company's biggest market in the region.</p>
