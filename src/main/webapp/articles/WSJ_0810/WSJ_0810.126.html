	<p class="article-leader">Hollis L. Harris, who succeeded Frank Lorenzo as head of
Continental Airlines, said the carrier will achieve the
consistent profitability that has eluded it, but he wouldn't
predict when.
   "You look at a carrier that has $5.5 billion in revenue,"
said Mr. Harris about Continental, "its service is a good
product and it has among the lowest relative seat-mile costs.
That airline, if we operate efficiently, ought to be able to
make a profit."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The 58-year-old Mr. Harris resigned the presidency of
Delta Air Lines earlier this week to become president and
chief executive officer of Continental Airlines Holdings Inc.
and head of its airline unit.</p>
<p>"My goal is to aggressively move forward on a more
streamlined and simplified basis," said Mr. Harris, who
wouldn't be more specific. Asked when the carrier will see
consistent quarterly profit, he simply smiled. "In the
future," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Lorenzo, an airline executive who spent much of the
past decade embroiled in high-profile, bitter disputes with
labor, agreed to sell most of his stake in Continental
Holdings to Scandinavian Airlines System and to step down as
chairman and chief executive officer of the Houston-based
airline holding company and as head of Continental.</p>
<p>"I personally have become a lightning rod for many steps
that were required to build this company to what it is
today," Mr. Lorenzo said at a New York news conference.</p>
<p>Word that Mr. Lorenzo had vacated his Continental Holdings
posts boosted the company's stock price to $6.25, up $1.75,
on volume of 2.4 million shares in trading on the American
Stock Exchange. The stock has suffered tremendously as the
holding company sustained massive losses, even during some of
the industry's most profitable quarters ever.</p>
<p>Mr. Lorenzo and Jan Carlzon, president and chief executive
of SAS, said the transaction would take this form: SAS would
acquire, for $21 million -- $10.8 million to Mr. Lorenzo --
all the stock outstanding in Jet Capital, a closely-held
investment vehicle that controls Continental Holdings through
a special class of stock. SAS also will pay Mr. Lorenzo $17
million for various other holdings and options, as well as
three years' salary, or another $2.7 million. SAS also will
pay $31.4 million to buy 2,250,000 Continental Holdings
shares.</p>
<p>All told, SAS will increase its equity stake in
Continental Holdings to 16.8% from the current 9.9%. Its
voting control will be 18.4%. Federal law bars foreign
ownership of a U.S. airline of more than 25%.</p>
<p>SAS would increase its representation on the 15-member
Continental Holdings board to three from one. Mr. Carlzon
would remain on the Continental board, and said he is
considering a post as its chairman, but with no operational
duties.</p>
<p>The U.S. Transportation Department, which must approve the
transaction, has already requested additional financial
information. Securities analysts, however, expressed optimism
that the transaction will be cleared. They suggested that
Continental's case is helped by Mr. Lorenzo's unpopularity in
Washington, where he has been denounced by a number of
congressmen for his acriminous relations with labor unions.</p>
<p>Richard Hillman, vice president, flight operations, at
Continental, confirmed for the carrier's pilots early
yesterday a story in The Wall Street Journal that said Mr.
Lorenzo was leaving. He added that Mr. Lorenzo "decided the
future of the company would be better served if he got his
name out of it."</p>
<p>In the recorded message for the carrier's pilots, Mr.
Hillman suggested Mr. Lorenzo's absence might mean a "better
shot" at financing for Continental's multi-billion dollar
plane orders. "We've been having a little trouble getting
some financing for our airplanes," he added.</p>
<p>A Continental spokesman wouldn't comment specifically on
what Mr. Hillman told the pilots.</p>
<p>Mr. Harris's defection from Delta surprised many. That
carrier prides itself on a family-like atmosphere that keeps
employees from jumping ship as they often do at other
airlines. All but one of Delta's senior executives have spent
more than 20 years at the company. Under Mr. Lorenzo,
Continental Airlines had seven presidents in as many years.</p>
<p>Mr. Harris spent 36 years at Delta, rising from gate agent
to president, with stops along the way in engineering,
facilities and flight operations.</p>
<p>Neither, however, has he been so publicly vilified by
organized labor as was Mr. Lorenzo. Labor difficulties pushed
Eastern Airlines, then a unit of Continental Holdings'
predecessor, Texas Air Corp., into a crippling strike that
put the carrier into Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. A
bankruptcy court judge subsequently took control of Eastern
from Mr. Lorenzo and his management team, appointing a
trustee.</p>
<p>Union leaders who watched as Mr. Lorenzo successfully
vaporized thousands of jobs and slashed wages and benefits to
the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars were celebratory
yesterday. The International Machinists Union, taking note of
a non-compete clause with SAS that keeps Mr. Lorenzo out of
the airlines business for seven years, offered "our
condolences to whatever industry he stalks next."</p>
