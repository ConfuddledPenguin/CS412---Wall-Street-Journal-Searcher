	<p class="article-leader">Behind the facade of confidence, Saddam Hussein's invasion
of Kuwait was the act of a desperate man. After all, even if
Saddam underestimated the international response to his
seizure of Kuwait, the act could not have been risk-free. Why
take that risk?
   Saddam has big problems at home. The Iraqi population did
not feel victorious in its war with Iran, which concluded two
years ago. To be sure, people were giddy and elated with the
war's end. But as time passed and they looked to their peace
dividend, they didn't find much.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>There was no prosperity. Even the limited demobilization
of Iraq's million-man army brought significant unemployment.
Egyptians working in Iraq were murdered for their jobs.
Iraq's immense foreign debt continued to rise after the
cease-fire, by $10 billion to its current $80 billion or so.
In the same period, the Iraqi dinar fell 25% and is now worth
one-twelfth its official value ($3). Inflation runs more than
40% annually. Last year public-sector employees, the bulk of
the labor force, received their first pay hike since the war
began -- 20%. The rank-and-file of the ruling Baath Party
grumbled along with everyone else.</p>
<p>The war also created pressures for popular participation
in government, and the regime knew it. One month after the
cease-fire, when the population was still elated by the war's
end, Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz told a visiting delegation
of Arab professors that there would have to be political
change in Iraq or else there would be political turmoil.
Indeed, Saddam was quick to promise the country "more
democracy." He even stuck his toe in the waters of political
reform with fairly honest balloting for Iraq's National
Assembly, although among carefully screened candidates. In
the March 1989 elections the Baath Party won only 40% of the
seats.</p>
<p>But nothing else happened. As one Iraqi explained to me in
Baghdad last July, "You Westerners think everything is under
control. But you don't see beneath the surface. People are
fed up. The regime fears an explosion."</p>
<p>The explosion came at year's end -- in Eastern Europe. The
overthrow of one-party regimes there seems to have convinced
Saddam that his position was untenable. In late January the
Iraqi regime made its only significant gesture to popular
expectations by lifting a wartime travel ban -- adding,
incidentally, to the hard currency crunch.</p>
<p>Saddam apparently came to realize that he needed cash in a
big way -- as an end in itself and for the support it buys.
In February, he struck out on a new course. Publicly he began
raising the old demons, "Zionism" and "imperialism."
Privately, he made exorbitant demands for money. When the
leaders of Iraq, Egypt, Jordan and Yemen met for an Arab
Cooperation Council summit, Saddam called for the liberation
of Jerusalem (about which he had previously been silent) and
for U.S. ships to leave the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>But his real agenda emerged behind closed doors, where he
dismissed as insufficient the notion that the Gulf states
might forgive their wartime loans to Iraq. He warned Jordan's
King Hussein and Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak "Go and tell
those people in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf, I need $30 billion
in fresh money. If they don't give it to me, I will know how
to get it." Last month, as an Iraqi envoy toured the Gulf
ostensibly to press adherence to OPEC quotas, he demanded $10
billion from each state he visited. Kuwait offered several
billion.</p>
<p>In retrospect, many of the dramatic events surrounding
Iraq since February, including Saddam's execution of the
London-based journalist Farzad Bazoft and the threat to burn
half of Israel, can be seen as an effort to raise tensions
with the West in order to create the environment in which to
intimidate the Gulf states into paying up. And when that
failed, to take what was not given.</p>
<p>The first flush of victory in Kuwait may have alleviated
temporarily many of Saddam's problems. An idle army is busy
again and unemployment has disappeared. Above all, there is
now an answer to the question -- what did we get out of the
war with Iran? Kuwait. The conquest of Kuwait represents the
realization of longstanding and widely held irredentist
ambitions among the Iraqi population. And there is private
profit as well. The army has engaged in widespread looting --
of banks, the money exchanges, the gold market, the car
dealers.</p>
<p>But sobriety is likely to set in quickly. The United
Nations sanctions essentially prohibit all international
trade with Iraq, including foodstuffs. Iraq spends $4 billion
a year on food imports, relying heavily on them for meat and
its two staple foods, wheat and rice. Supplies were already
spotty before sanctions existed.</p>
<p>Iraq's generals cannot view lightly the prospect of war
with the U.S. Tension has always existed between them and
Saddam. The cease-fire increased the opportunities for idle
and dissatisfied officers to move against him. Between
December 1988 and March 1989, hundreds of officers were
arrested and many executed. (There have been reports that 100
officers were executed last week after refusing to
participate in the Kuwaiti invasion.) Iraq's most celebrated
war hero, Lt. Gen. Maher Abdul Rashid, disappeared from
public view. Saddam's failure to hold the January 1989 Army
Day parade, remarkable in light of his claim to have achieved
a military victory over Iran, gave credence to reports of
widespread plotting against him. Since the beginning of this
year, there have been no less than four credible reports of
coup and assassination attempts. Last month Saddam closed
down the officers' clubs.</p>
<p>Iraq's government is essentially a family affair and army
politics became bizarrely entwined with family politics with
the death last year of longtime Defense Minister Adnan
Khayrallah. Saddam's cousin, and the brother of his wife,
Khayrallah was killed in a May 1989 helicopter crash. Reports
emerged of strains between Saddam and his wife's relatives,
including Khayrallah, after Saddam took a second wife.
Saddam's eldest son by his first wife bludgeoned to death a
bodyguard deemed responsible for introducing Saddam to his
new bride. Significant segments of the army blame Saddam for
the death of Khayrallah and resent the executions of the
officers.</p>
<p>Problems exist elsewhere in the repressive apparatus that
keeps the regime in power. At the end of last year --
coincident with the overthrow of the East European
governments -- Saddam brought two of his half-brothers back
into key security positions. One brother, Sabawi Ibrahim, was
made head of the Mukhabarat, the General Intelligence
Directorate, and another, Wathban Ibrahim, was put in charge
of internal security.</p>
<p>All this reflects the precariousness of Saddam's position.
His vulnerability to international sanctions, vigorously
monitored, should not be underestimated. But what happens
when those sanctions begin to bite? The very effectiveness of
the sanctions may lead to conflict.</p>
<p>Saddam is unlikely to go quietly. If he withdraws from
Kuwait, he will be even more vulnerable domestically than
before the invasion; he would be unlikely to survive. As he
comes to realize the dangers sanctions pose for him, he may
respond by taking action aimed at reversing them. He will
probably be calculating and rational, but unrestrained by any
moral scruple.</p>
<p>Hints have already emerged. Besides those foreigners that
Iraqi forces have taken from Kuwait to Baghdad, the entire
non-Iraqi population of Kuwait and Iraq are potential
hostages. Not only are they subject to the same abuses we
have witnessed in other hostage situations, those in Kuwait
are vulnerable en masse. For example, as Iraqi supplies
become tight, Kuwait may be denied food and water. Will
sanctions survive if the lives of hundreds of thousands of
people in Kuwait, mostly non-Americans, are at risk? Is the
U.S. prepared to fight on their account?</p>
<p>Or Saddam may look further afield. He probably does not
want a real war with Israel. But what about a phony war?
Israel has repeatedly warned that the entry of Iraqi troops
into Jordan is a "casus belli." The Iraqi army has 50
divisions. Suppose Saddam took 10 divisions and marched them
westward, calculating that Jordan would be unable to stop
him. Israel would have to attack the Iraqi forces. Saddam
wouldn't mind the loss of his 10 divisions if he succeeded in
securing the war that would rally Arab support to his side.
Is there sufficient coordination between Israel and the U.S.
to ensure that Saddam will not profit from such an action?</p>
<p>Saddam faces real dangers if he withdraws from Kuwait and
the temptation for schemes like these are great. Perhaps it
would be best to let him know now that any brutalities he may
contemplate aimed at undoing the sanctions will bring a
full-scale war. Only such a perception may cause him to
consider that it is better to go back home and take his
chances with the byzantine world of Iraqi politics than to
run the risk of war with the U.S.</p>
