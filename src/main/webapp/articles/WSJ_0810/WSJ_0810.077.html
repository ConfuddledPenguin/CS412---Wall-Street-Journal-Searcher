	<p class="article-leader">Procter & Gamble Co. reported fiscal fourth-quarter net
income soared 66%, reflecting strength in the company's core
detergent and diaper products.
   In the quarter ended June 30, the Cincinnati-based
consumer-products giant earned $284 million, or 78 cents a
share, compared with $171 million, or 50 cents a share, a
year earlier. Sales in the quarter climbed 14% to $6.22
billion from $5.43 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Much of P&G's earnings growth stems from U.S. and
international sales of traditional products, such as
detergents, diapers and shampoos. "The company has invested a
lot in new product development for those products in recent
years and it's paying off handsomely," said Deepak Raj, an
analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.</p>
<p>For instance, Pert Plus, a combination shampoo and
conditioner, was introduced in 22 countries during fiscal
1990, building on its base as the leading U.S. shampoo brand.</p>
<p>The company's latest results also reflect continued
improvements in operating profit margins from the company's
continuing program to trim excess manufacturing and
distribution costs. Chairman and Chief Executive Edwin L.
Artzt has pledged to cut $1 billion in costs during the next
two years. "It's really starting to kick in," said Bonita
Austin, an analyst with Wertheim Schroder & Co.</p>
<p>One area where costs are rising is international marketing
as the company expands product lines abroad. P&G introduced
super-concentrated detergents -- preferred by many consumers
because smaller amounts are needed per washload and packaging
is more compact -- in Europe, Japan and parts of Latin
America. In Japan, those products account for about 80% of
the detergent market. In the U.S., the detergents are sold as
the "Ultra" versions of the Cheer, Tide, Gain and Oxydol
brand names.</p>
<p>For the 1990 fiscal year, P&G reported net income of $1.60
billion, or $4.49 a share, up 32% from $1.21 billion, or
$3.56 a share in 1989. All year-ago per-share figures have
been adjusted to reflect the 2-for-1 stock split paid in
November 1989. Year-earlier results also included a $78
million charge related to closing some plants and
consolidating certain operations.</p>
<p>Analysts said they expect strong results to continue into
1991, regardless of any weakening in the economy, because
consumers continue to buy the company's products in
recessions. Moreover, P&G is introducing more of its U.S.
product lines around the world. For the year, P&G posted
international earnings of $467 million, up 12% from $417
million last year.</p>
<p>Ms. Austin of Wertheim expects fiscal 1991 earnings of
$5.20 a share, while Mr. Raj of Merrill Lynch estimates $5.25
a share.</p>
