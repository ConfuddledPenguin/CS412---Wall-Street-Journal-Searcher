	<p class="article-leader">Safer Inc., Newton, Mass., said it agreed to settle a
dispute with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
concerning promotional safety claims the closely held concern
has made about its biodegradable pesticides.
   In July 1989 the EPA filed an administrative complaint
against the company, charging that its literature violated
federal laws prohibiting safety claims in pesticide
advertising. Safer argues that the laws were drafted before
relatively benign pesticides such as its "insecticidal soaps"
were available, and so are "outdated" and shouldn't apply to
its products, which it has advertised as nontoxic.
Furthermore, Safer noted, the EPA hasn't questioned the
safety of its products -- only the language used to promote
them.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company said that under its consent decree with the
EPA, it will pay a $10,000 civil penalty and undertake a
program of "environmentally beneficial expenditures promoting
the safe use of pesticides." Safer added that it agreed to
the settlement to avoid "costly and protracted" litigation.</p>
