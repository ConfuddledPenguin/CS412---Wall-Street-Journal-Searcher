	<p class="article-leader">Europe is rediscovering the world. That appears to be one
of the lessons of the current blowup in the Persian Gulf.
Yes, Europe is dependent on Gulf oil, but it's worth noting
that the solid support for the Bush initiative against Saddam
Hussein comes just as Western Europe is attempting to unify
its continental market. Its NATO members, for instance, seem
to believe now that the Gulf region is not quite as "out of
area" as they have suggested during past crises.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was in Aspen,
Colorado, in recent days to deliver a long-scheduled speech
about the European future, and what struck us as most
interesting about her thoughts was how appropriate and
relevant they were for the current moment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mrs. Thatcher again laid out her vision for the European
future, but this time without the nationalistic spin of her
famous 1988 speech in Bruges, Belgium. In Bruges, she
emphasized Britain and the importance of national
sovereignty. In Aspen she spoke more about universal
political values.</p>
<p>Rather than a tightly bound European union, Mrs. Thatcher
would like to see a broad, flexible community of sovereign
nations. The events of the 22 months between Mrs. Thatcher's
major addresses on this subject have strengthened the
plausibility of that vision. Up to now, hyper-Europeanists
have been unable to respond fully to the political changes
occurring on the EC's periphery.</p>
<p>Norway, Finland and Austria want to join the EC and are
highly qualified candidates. Turkey and Malta want in as
well. Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary are striving to
shuck off the sackcloth of communism and develop market
economies. EC membership would help. To be sure, the original
concept of European unity envisioned developed economies. The
emerging Middle European democracies are less developed, but
that does not make them less European.</p>
<p>As the EC bureaucracy has moved toward removal of barriers
to trade and capital flows it has focused on a more ambitious
goal, an ill-defined "political union." This concept has made
it less hospitable toward new entries. The political
unionists argue that they can't allow new memberships to
disrupt the delicate federal architecture designed in
Brussels. But Free Europe is becoming bigger and more diverse
than it was two years ago, and in Aspen, Mrs. Thatcher
worried about what happens to the democratic and economic
stability of nations that are excluded from the single
market.</p>
<p>If the EC somehow emerges as a true federation, with a
welfare state and extensive social regulations tacked on to
the original single-market framework, then members will
become more reluctant than ever to admit less-developed
nations. Greece and Italy already strain EC redistributionist
coffers. It will be argued that it is too expensive to admit
a Turkey, a Hungary or a Poland. That exclusion could have
severe consequences for political and economic development,
and in the long term, for the security of Europe.</p>
<p>Most important, Mrs. Thatcher reminded her listeners that
the difficulties of sustaining democracy are too often
underestimated. Democratic and free-market institutions were
exported to Africa in the 1960s, but lie unused. The way to
fortify market structures in the newly free nations of
Eastern Europe is to integrate them with the established
market structures in the West. (That's equally true for the
other developing nations attempting to participate in the
world trading system.) A looser EC that remains primarily a
vehicle for free trade and economic competition wouldn't be
the elite First World club it threatens to become. The bigger
the free-trade zone, the more wealth it creates.</p>
<p>That Mrs. Thatcher is no longer trying to confront EC
"dirigisme" head-on is testimony to the momentum of European
unification. She has been called a hesitant European. But
perhaps it is now fair to ask: Who is the true European?</p>
<p>Is it the advocate of political unity who thereby makes it
difficult for the excluded Europeans, such as Turkey, to join
the club? Or is it the espouser of a broader European
Economic Community, who insists on a structure that all
European nations can join?</p>
<p>It is conventionally said that by standing off to the
side, Mrs. Thatcher has marginalized British influence on EC
affairs. But the activity of the world's nations this week,
as they seek to protect the global economy from an aggressive
marauder, suggests that Mrs. Thatcher is asking the right
questions about the nature of political and economic
structures in an interdependent world.</p>
