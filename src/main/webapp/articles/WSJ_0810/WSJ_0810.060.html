	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and countermoves
by U.S. forces have sparked sharply higher ratings for the
three major networks' nightly newscasts -- so much so that
the news ratings may surpass the networks' prime-time
entertainment fare.
   Since the conflict in the Middle East intensified earlier
this week with the deployment of U.S. troops, the combined
ratings -- provided by A.C. Nielsen Co., a unit of Dun &
Bradstreet Corp. -- for the evening newscasts on ABC, CBS and
NBC are up 15% from the previous two weeks, according to
David F. Poltrack, a CBS Inc. senior vice president.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>If the trend -- and the conflict -- continues, next week's
combined ratings for the three newscasts may exceed the
ratings of prime-time shows. "If it happens, it would be the
first time," Mr. Poltrack said.</p>
<p>Individually, the "CBS Evening News with Dan Rather" was
up 22% in ratings, "ABC World News Tonight with Peter
Jennings" increased its audience by 16% in ratings, and
ratings for "NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw" rose by 8%
from two weeks ago, Mr. Poltrack says.</p>
<p>The Iraq story also has boosted the ratings of the 24-hour
news channel Cable News Network, owned by Turner Broadcasting
System Inc. CNN nearly doubled its ratings, attracting 1.5%
of all cable homes on Wednesday, the cable channel's highest
24-hour average this year. CNN typically gets a rating of
0.6% of cable homes.</p>
<p>For the broadcast networks, ratings for the nightly news
aired at 6:30 p.m. or 7 p.m. EDT usually dip in the summer as
viewers go on vacation or stay out later to enjoy the extra
hours of daylight. The three broadcast-network newscasts had
a combined rating of 30.8% of all television homes for the
1988-89 season. But that number dropped 20% in July to a
combined 24.7 rating. A ratings point represents 1% of all
television households or 921,000 homes.</p>
<p>While the Iraq invasion has been good news for network
news, it could deflate the networks' aggressive programming
strategy used in prime time this summer. Instead of airing
the typical parade of series reruns because of low summer
viewing, the networks have been running more original
episodes in a bid for higher ratings -- yet now their nightly
newscasts could draw even bigger audiences.</p>
<p>To date, the networks are stymied in efforts to cover the
Middle East story with correspondents and camera crews. CBS
News anchor Dan Rather continues to report from Jordan,
cutting short a vacation in the south of France last week
with "CBS Evening News" executive producer Tom Bettag. Both
men flew to London when Iraq first invaded Kuwait.</p>
<p>ABC's "Nightline" anchor Ted Koppel flew to Cairo, as did
NBC's "Meet the Press" anchor Garrick Utley. Both networks
decided against sending their lead anchors to the Middle East
because officials believed the newsmen were better equipped
to monitor events from New York.</p>
