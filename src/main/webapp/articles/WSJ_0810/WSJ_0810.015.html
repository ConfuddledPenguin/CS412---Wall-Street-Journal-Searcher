	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Ameritech's Michigan Bell Co. unit proposed a
new pricing structure in reaction to increased competition
for interstate long-distance service, but said the move
wouldn't boost revenue.
   In a filing with the Michigan Public Service Commission,
the company said it would cut interstate long-distance rates
15% and would discount calls between cities and suburbs. The
cuts, amounting to about $140 million, would be offset by
raising pay-phone charges to 25 cents from 20 cents and by
increasing charges for operator-assisted calls and
information services.</p>
