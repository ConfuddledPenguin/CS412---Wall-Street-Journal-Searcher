	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Bargain hunters bought stocks and bonds,
sparking a rally in both markets. The dollar was little
changed against key currencies as traders awaited
developments in the Middle East.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 24.01 to 2758.91,
the first back-to-back gains in two weeks. Bond prices rose
about 3/4 point, or $7.50 for each $1,000 face amount.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Stock investors continued to favor companies that might be
less affected by a recession. Food stocks, a classic
recession-resistant sector, advanced sharply. CPC
International gained 2 3/8 to 78 5/8; General Mills rose 2
3/8 to 88.</p>
<p>But many big investors suspect that stocks' recovery won't
last. "The rally is not sustainable," said Joseph DeMarco,
managing director in charge of equity trading at Marinvest.
He thinks the weak U.S. economy will re-emerge as the central
focus once the Mideast crisis is resolved.</p>
<p>But continuing evidence of weak growth prompted some
investors to step up and buy long-term Treasury bonds.
Roberta Olsen, bond portfolio manager at Banc One Asset
Management, bought in yesterday's sale of $10.26 billion in
30-year bonds.</p>
<p>"I definitely did buy, I am happy to say," said Ms. Olsen.
At about 1:30 p.m. EDT, talk of a strong auction circulated
through the markets and bonds and stocks rallied. Yields on
the new bond dropped from the average auction level of 8.87%
to 8.75% by the market's close.</p>
<p>Crude oil prices weakened yesterday -- another support for
both stocks and bonds. Oil contracts for September delivery
fell 29 cents a barrel to $25.67.</p>
<p>Stock trading volume was light, however, and the currency
markets were quiet, too. Many investors continue to stand
aside, waiting for some clear resolution to tensions in the
Middle East.</p>
<p>One of the biggest players in the Treasury market, the
World Bank, sat out yesterday's auction because of the
uncertainty. Said Althea Duersten, senior manager of the
World Bank's $9 billion bond portfolio: "The markets are
better at quantifying economic risk than political risk.
We're not making a major stand when political affairs could
blow up when the market's closed."</p>
<p>In major market activity:</p>
<p>Stocks finished higher. New York Stock Exchange volume
totaled 155.8 million shares, the least activity since July
30.</p>
<p>Bond prices rallied. The new 10-year note, auctioned
Wednesday, gained 1/2 point, or $5 for each $1,000 face
amount. Yields dropped to 8.64% from the average auction
level of 8.77%.</p>
<p>The dollar finished little changed against most
currencies. In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted
at 1.5965 marks, up from 1.5925 marks late Wednesday, and
unchanged at 149.80 yen.</p>
