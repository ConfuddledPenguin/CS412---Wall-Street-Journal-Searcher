	<p class="article-leader">A week ago you surely could have produced quizzical looks
by asking an American, German or Briton whether a NATO
country borders on Iraq. But yesterday Secretary of State
Baker was in Ankara to thank Turkey for its cooperation in
the Iraqi crisis, and no doubt to seek further help from this
strategic partner.
   "There is no question in the minds of anybody, certainly
not the U.S. and Turkey, with respect to the obligations"
under the NATO Treaty, Secretary Baker said. The question is,
would any other NATO country need reassurances from the
Secretary of State that others would respond if it were
attacked with poison gas? But then, Turkey is used to being
treated as neither fish nor fowl.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Turkey is of course the only Islamic nation in NATO. It
is, however, totally secular; it grows wine, sells Stars of
David in the grand bazaar, and has the best record of
democracy of any Islamic nation. It's currently led by Prime
Minister Turgut Ozal -- the kind of leader who, when wounded
by a gunman during an appearance, gets bandaged up and
completes his speech. Sitting south of the Soviet Union and
north of the Persian Gulf, it has a unique geopolitical
location and the second-largest army in NATO.</p>
<p>Yet Turkey has found its military equipment restricted by
an informal congressional rule that little Greece must get $7
in military aid for every $10 going to strategic Turkey. The
Senate passes resolutions wallowing in the Armenian tragedies
of the old Ottoman Empire that collapsed in World War I,
though in our time the problem has been the murder of Turkish
diplomats by Armenian terrorists. And the European Community
tosses the Turkish application for membership into a dark
file, saying it's "impossible" to consider before, say, 1993.</p>
<p>Much of the trouble of course revolves around the Turkish
troops on the part of Cyprus where its Islamic communities
gathered after the 1974 fighting. But Turkey did not start
the fighting on Cyprus; the Greek colonels did, trying to
annex the island to Greece in defiance of its 1960
independence agreement. Turkey invaded as a guarantor of that
agreement.</p>
<p>This was also a turning point in NATO, for the U.S. sent a
letter calling into question the pledges Secretary Baker felt
it necessary to reinstate yesterday. Various Greek
politicians, Andreas Papandreou in particular, have since
used Cyprus to demagog in Greece. With American attention
focused on Turkey's strategic importance, and with a new
conservative government in Greece, perhaps a new arrangement
can finally be reached for the withdrawal of Turkish troops
and safety for the Islamic minority on the island.</p>
<p>As for human rights, far from producing refugees, Turkey
provides a haven for them. Naturally it took in the more than
300,000 ethnic Turks deported from Bulgaria. But though it
has its own Kurdish tensions, it also took in perhaps 100,000
Kurds fleeing from poison-gas attacks on their homelands in
northern Iraq. Compared with the regimes in either Iraq or
Iran, Turkey uses its authority to offer haven for the
unfortunate Kurds.</p>
<p>In truth, the main reason so many in the West look down
their noses at Turkey has been the prejudice from the fact
that it is a Moslem country. It is now clearer than ever that
this is a virtue. Turkey is the model modern Moslem country
-- democratic, secular and free market.</p>
<p>Turkey had already been of great help with Iraq by bravely
-- and expensively -- cutting oil shipments and by providing
a base for U.S. planes. With better treatment from the West,
it will play a key role in leading the Middle East into the
modern world.</p>
