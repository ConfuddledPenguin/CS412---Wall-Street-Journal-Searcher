	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- The Department of Trade and Industry said it
won't refer Cadbury Schweppes PLC's #125 million ($233.7
million) acquisition of Source Perrier's non-cola soft drinks
business to the government's Mergers and Monopolies
Commission for review.
   The decision effectively clears the way for the food and
drinks concern's agreed bid for those operations of France's
Perrier, announced in late May. The purchase includes two
plants in the Paris area and one in Marseilles for various
brands of the bottled water and beverage concern's subsidiary
Compagnie d'Exploitation de Boissons Refraichissantes.</p>
