	<p class="article-leader">MOSCOW -- The Soviet government ended a taboo that has
barred private property here for generations and now will
allow individual citizens and groups to set up small
businesses.
   The decree is the latest move by the government to deliver
on its promises of economic change. The Soviet Parliament
gave the government until September to produce specific laws
to back up the economic changes approved in June.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We are now approaching free enterprise," said Stanislav
Assekritov, a deputy chairman of the State Commission for
Economic Reforms. "We are now actually giving every citizen
the ability to exercise his right to work."</p>
<p>The central government is hurriedly implementing changes
by decree partly because it is struggling to keep control as
one republic after another declares economic and political
sovereignty. This race between the center and republics makes
unclear the ultimate meaning of any specific development.</p>
<p>For example, the Russian Federation asserted its
independence with a declaration that could have significant
repercussions for foreigners doing business in the Soviet
Union, according to the government news agency Tass. The
Russian parliament presidium declared invalid economic
agreements with foreigners and deals for the sale of some
strategic resources from Russian territory that were made
with the central government after Russia decreed sovereignty
in June. All deals will be reviewed, and from now on, only
those concluded with the republic itself will be honored.</p>
<p>The declaration specifically mentions diamonds, precious
metals, oil and uranium. By far the biggest Soviet deal
concluded since the Russian Federation declared sovereignty
was an agreement by the Glavalmazzolato -- the Soviet
administration for diamonds and precious metals -- to borrow
$1 billion from the Swiss arm of De Beers Consolidated Mines
Ltd. and to sell it $5 billion of diamonds over five years.</p>
<p>The declaration challenges central control by claiming the
right to review, and theoretically overturn, central
government contracts. But Russia made the declaration
primarily to bolster its political authority, and might
therefore reinstate existing foreign contracts as long as
they are coordinated with the republic.</p>
<p>The central government hopes to forestall such economic
fragmentation by establishing changes to serve as the basis
for a nationwide market and a new union treaty among the
republics. The decree on small businesses is part of that
plan.</p>
<p>The decree allows individuals and groups to invest, hire
employees and buy facilities. Foreigners can participate as
partners, although wholly owned foreign businesses aren't
covered. A law on freedom of enterprise will follow, but the
decree itself gives people the right to act.</p>
<p>The new decree isn't, however, a full freeing of the
small-business market. Such businesses will be allowed to
generate as much income as they can, but the hiring of
employees will be regulated. For example, construction
concerns will be allowed to hire as many as 200 people, and
scientific companies as many as 100, but other industrial
businesses can hire only 25 people and retail sales
operations only 15. Existing cooperative or state businesses
that fit these guidelines can be reclassified so as to take
advantage of incentives the government will give small
businesses.</p>
<p>The government hopes small businesses will recapture the
enthusiasm that once existed for cooperatives but has
evaporated in the past year. Cooperatives were created as a
way of encouraging entrepreneurial drive without actually
permitting private property. In cooperatives, ostensibly all
company property is collectively owned. The new enterprises
will differ from cooperatives in that a single individual can
invest, own and be responsible for the whole business.</p>
<p>In the early period of perestroika, people rushed to open
cooperatives. But no mechanisms were set up to enable
cooperatives to get the materials and services they needed
from the labyrinth of central control. Many cooperatives took
to offering exorbitant prices to state suppliers, and
middlemen sprung up to take advantage of the gap in pricing.
The reputation of cooperatives plummeted, and today they are
widely criticized as speculators out to make a fast buck at
the expense of the nation.</p>
<p>"Many scientists won't join cooperatives because they say
it will discredit them," says Nikolai Lavrov, a deputy
chairman of the Council of Ministers. "But they will be quite
willing to join small enterprises."</p>
<p>Economic reformers hope that new small businesses will, in
particular, help develop Soviet science and technology.
Experts in the field frequently note that the Soviet Union
has competitive basic research in such areas as new materials
and medicine, but hasn't developed its ideas into products.</p>
<p>The government will offer incentives for small businesses
that may help prevent them from going the way of
cooperatives. Several of these are designed to help assure
that would-be businessmen aren't stonewalled by bureaucrats
resistant to change. Regional parliaments will be required to
approve or disapprove a new business within two weeks of
application. Reasons for rejection must be explained; the
only acceptable reason is that the business is involved in
illegal trade, such as weapons or drugs.</p>
<p>The decree also orders regional parliaments to sell or
lease industrial equipment that is lying fallow and to help
small enterprises find and buy or lease facilities. Even
Gosnab, the central state structure that distributes
materials and facilities, is directed to sell equipment and
facilities under its control and provide leasing firms with
equipment to rent out.</p>
<p>Small businesses will also get tax breaks under the new
tax law starting Jan. 1. Profits reinvested in the business
won't be taxed, and asset amortization will be accelerated.
In the first year of operations, businesses will have to pay
only 50% of the tax they would owe, and in the second year,
75%.</p>
<p>"We want to create a flexible structure that can respond
quickly to demand and supply," says Mr. Assekritov.
"Everybody will now be free to do the things he likes."</p>
