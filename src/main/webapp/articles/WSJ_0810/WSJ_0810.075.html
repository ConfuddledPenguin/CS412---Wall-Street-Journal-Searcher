	<p class="article-leader">Travelers may face not only higher prices but a host of
other inconveniences if energy prices stay up.
   Already, many travel companies are quietly considering
ways to conserve fuel. These range from dropping some airline
flights, to installing harsher lights in hotel rooms, to
using motion detectors to turn off guest-room air
conditioners. Obviously, not all the changes would be a major
hindrance, but travel experts say they could confuse and
annoy people.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The problem is travel companies always try to sneak these
things past people without telling them what they're doing,"
says Chekitan Dev, assistant professor at Cornell Hotel
School. "So you may not know the reason it's happening, but
you'll definitely notice" a less air-conditioned room.</p>
<p>Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has quickly affected travel
prices, with several airlines announcing fare boosts this
week. So far, though, airlines, hotels and car-rental
companies say they haven't seriously stepped up fuel
conservation efforts, because they had already become more
energy-conscious after the oil crisis of the 1970s.</p>
<p>Energy costs account for 15% of airlines' expenses and 8%
of hotels'. "We kind of figured out most of the big ways to
save fuel years ago," says Robert Baker, executive vice
president of operations for American Airlines.</p>
<p>But industry officials concede that unless oil prices
quickly return to midsummer levels, they will be forced to
start cutting more corners. A few of the changes might be
major and easy to spot; if oil stays at $25 a barrel for the
next few weeks, for example, Mr. Baker says his and other
airlines may start dropping some less fuel-efficient flights.
Those might be chronically undersold flights to smaller
cities.</p>
<p>But most of the changes probably won't seem energy-related
to a casual traveler. Airlines, for example, could tamper
more with air conditioning, recycling more cabin air instead
of using fresh air. Union officials have long contended that
the practice poses a health risk, trapping pollutants and
bacteria in the cabin. "It's a quick and dirty way to cut
fuel costs, and I'm sure some airlines will start doing it,"
says Matthew Finucane, safety director for the Association of
Flight Attendants. Airlines insist they wouldn't recycle more
cabin air unless an acute national energy crisis existed.</p>
<p>Hotels, which industrywide spend $2.1 billion a year on
heat and electricity, will probably spring some surprises on
guests in the next few weeks. Although declining to say so
publicly, some hotel officials say they're considering using
motion detectors to turn off air conditioners and lights when
guests leave rooms.</p>
<p>Several major chains already have installed the devices,
but haven't widely used them because they can annoy guests --
by mistakenly turning off power when they are sleeping or
letting rooms get too hot or cold when they're away.</p>
<p>Some hotels may also shut off bathroom exhaust fans during
the day, install more fluorescent room lights and use more
shower heads limiting water flow, according to hotel
officials and consultants. Undoubtedly, guests would
complain. Many of the new lights save energy, but "are still
really too harsh," says Larry Chervenak, president of
Chervenak, Keane & Co., a hotel consulting firm in New York.</p>
<p>What's more, hotels in past oil scares have upset guests
by shutting off corridor lights at night, creating obvious
security hazards. Other chains put hidden controls on room
air conditioners that prevented guests from adjusting
temperatures to desired levels. Like airlines, however,
hotels insist they wouldn't take such measures now unless
there was a national emergency.</p>
<p>"People would have to perceive a real crisis before you
could go that far and not lose business," says John Nicolls,
a senior vice president for Hyatt Hotels Corp.</p>
<p>Car-rental companies are the least likely to make any
operational changes in the near future; they have very tiny
fuel expenses, since renters generally must buy or pay for
the gas they use. But during the gas shortages in the mid and
late-'70s, several car-rental firms gave customers only a
quarter tank of gas and quietly raised mileage fees.</p>
<p>"There was a lot of game playing," says Robert Coffey, a
vice president of market planning at Alamo Rent A Car Inc.,
refering to his experiences at past car-rental companies.</p>
<p>If travel companies go ahead with the less drastic
measures, they aren't likely to publicize them, for fear of
losing guests to less energy-conscious competitors. But Mr.
Dev at Cornell's hotel school thinks the industry could score
some marketing points by letting travelers know about
energy-saving steps. "It's in to care about the environment
these days," says Mr. Dev. "The industry could make itself
look good."</p>
