	<p class="article-leader">EL PASO, Texas -- In the old days, William F. Farah's
birthday was a happy time at Farah Inc. Employees would take
up a collection to buy a cake -- in the shape of a pair of
Farah pants, of course -- and hire a mariachi band.
Inevitably, Mr. Farah would request his favorite song, "El
Rey," which proclaims that, through persistence, the king
always prevails.
   In a tumultuous quarter-century as chief executive of
Farah, the king, indeed, always prevailed -- over several
possible successors, over his own sons and over lenders who
sought to keep him away from the company his parents created.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But now, Willie, as everyone calls Mr. Farah, may be
fighting his last battle.</p>
<p>A year ago, the Farah board forced Mr. Farah out as chief
executive. In March, the board ousted him as chairman. The
company is wallowing in debt and red ink. Its sales, which
peaked at $366.1 million in 1986, fell to $239 million in
1989. Mr. Farah finds himself in a whirl of suits,
countersuits and a bitter proxy battle for control of the
family company he served for 53 years.</p>
<p>His three sons, who grew up with a vision of carrying on
the family business, have been driven out after clashes with
the family patriarch. His daughter, the only family member
still on the board, voted to oust her father as chairman.</p>
<p>And even though Mr. Farah's 16% stake in the company is
still worth about $4 million, this week he and his wife,
Betty, filed for bankruptcy protection. The petition, filed
in federal bankruptcy court in El Paso, contains few details
of the Farahs' finances, but Mr. Farah's lawyer said a
decline in the price of Farah stock had led to the filing.
Listed among the creditors are the Farahs' four children, to
whom they owe an estimated $2.3 million.</p>
<p>Today, shareholders at a special meeting will vote on Mr.
Farah's demand to dump seven of the nine directors. He says
he would replace them with his own slate. This much is
certain: Willie Farah's dream of a family dynasty reigning
over a billion-dollar apparel company is dead.</p>
<p>Mr. Farah recently celebrated his 71st birthday -- not at
his company, surrounded by loyal employees, a mariachi band
and loving offspring, but at a Mexican restaurant,
accompanied only by his wife. "It's really a tragedy," says
Kenneth Farah, one of the sons. "In the end, Willie has no
company and no love from his family. He sacrificed his
relationship with his kids for the love of his company.
That's a pretty tragic figure."</p>
<p>Responds Willie: "Our kids have turned out to be decent
and great human beings. So it's hard to understand why they
are so vindictive with their parents."</p>
<p>Farah Inc. was founded here in 1919 by Mansour and Hana
Farah, a Lebanese immigrant couple. It was a small but
thriving business when Mansour died in 1937 and his two sons
took over.</p>
<p>Jimmy Farah, the financial whiz, neatly complemented
Willie, an engineer whose newly designed production lines
established Farah as an early leader in automation. That
partnership lasted until Jimmy's sudden death in 1964. To
this day, his desk and chair remain as they were.</p>
<p>Jimmy, considered the more flexible and compassionate of
the brothers, was much beloved by employees. He often joined
workers for a beer and a game of horseshoes, and he listened
to their suggestions.</p>
<p>Willie, on the other hand, was perceived as opinionated
and unbending. A super-patriot, he insisted on using only
U.S.-made sewing machines and home-grown needles and thread.
For a long time, he would hire only U.S. citizens -- not an
easy task in a town teeming with both legal and illegal
immigrants -- and he refused to build foreign plants, where
wages were lower. Once, he even insisted that a contractor
pull out every Japanese-made nail used in the building of his
house.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Willie Farah presided over a period of
unprecedented growth at the firm. He shifted its emphasis
from making private-label slacks for retailers to selling its
own, higher-priced Farah-brand casual slacks to specialty and
department stores. He took the company public in 1967. And by
1970, sales had skyrocketed to $136 million from just $19
million a decade earlier. The work force swelled to 8,000,
making Farah El Paso's largest non-government employer.</p>
<p>Mr. Farah's children, who grew up cleaning floors and
manning the switchboard at the company, began taking
positions of responsibility. In 1970, oldest son Jimmy, fresh
out of Stanford University and the Wharton business school,
started in the manufacturing department. Kenneth had earlier
dropped out of the University of Texas at El Paso to work in
the customer-service department.</p>
<p>Just about then, things began to go bad for the company.
In 1971, workers seeking to unionize launched a strike that
lasted two years and led to a crippling nationwide boycott of
Farah products before Mr. Farah relented.</p>
<p>Willie plowed $10 million into a new textile mill to make
denim, but in an industry plagued by excess
denim-manufacturing capacity, the new plant turned into an
expensive albatross. Mr. Farah also resisted making
double-knit slacks when they were all the rage, then
overproduced them after the fad had peaked.</p>
<p>Mr. Farah won't talk about such specific issues. His sons
say the missteps all stemmed from Mr. Farah's inflexibility,
and that he ignored them when they tried to warn him about
the problems.</p>
<p>As a result, relations grew increasingly tense. When sons
passed father in the hallway, employees say, few words were
exchanged. Kenneth soon resigned, convinced he could never
work for his father. "Willie does not tolerate these words:
`I don't agree with you,' " he says.</p>
<p>In 1976, Willie bypassed Jimmy and named William Leone, a
Farah director, as president. Mr. Farah grew unhappy with his
choice in a matter of weeks and forced him to resign,
complaining that Mr. Leone couldn't divine men's fashion
trends. (Mr. Leone couldn't be reached for comment.)</p>
<p>Fed up with Mr. Farah's quirky reign, directors --
including son Jimmy -- voted to strip him of the title of
chief executive in 1977. But the act tormented Jimmy,
eventually driving him to resign from the board and leave the
company. "I didn't want to oppose him," Jimmy says, "but I
also couldn't support him."</p>
<p>Willie Farah began to plot a comeback. But he was blocked
by a consortium of creditors who threatened to declare a $22
million loan in default and padlock the company if he
regained control. He grudgingly yielded. But two successive
replacements, including noted turnaround consultant Andrew
Galef, failed to revive the company. The new board, Mr. Farah
complained, consisted of intellectuals who "didn't know a
damn thing about the garment industry."</p>
<p>In 1978, he regained control after a proxy contest and
initiated a purge. Armed security guards escorted Mr. Galef
and his aides to their cars, and dozens of employees branded
as disloyal were dismissed.</p>
<p>Mr. Farah also sued the lenders who had sought to prevent
his return -- and won a $14 million judgment, one of the
first to punish lenders for interfering in their borrowers'
businesses. Willie Farah was back.</p>
<p>But his empire was in disarray. When he and his latest
heir-apparent, Ray Williams, a tough former executive vice
president of V.F. Corp.'s jeans-making H.D. Lee division,
took command, the company needed $350,000 daily to operate
and had just $250,000 in the bank.</p>
<p>The two men cut expenses drastically, introduced some hot
new product lines and even went shopping themselves,
acquiring trendy Generra Sportswear Co. for $35 million to
beef up apparel offerings.</p>
<p>Mr. Williams convinced Mr. Farah that the company had to
move jobs to other countries to stay competitive. Plants soon
blossomed in Costa Rica and Mexico.</p>
<p>But relations between the two men eventually soured. One
issue: Mr. Farah reneged, former executives say, on a promise
to Mr. Williams to keep the Farah children out of management.
In 1979, Jimmy returned as sales manager, and son Robert was
eventually named to head international operations. Kenneth
returned later as an accountant.</p>
<p>A miffed Mr. Williams resigned in 1984.</p>
<p>For Mr. Farah's sons, the second time around didn't prove
much better than the first. "Willie expected blind
obedience," Kenneth says. The senior Mr. Farah bypassed both
Kenneth and Jimmy and offered the presidency to youngest son
Robert. Robert declined, saying the job should be offered to
the oldest brother. Finally, Jimmy got the job. Neither he
nor his brothers will comment on the episode.</p>
<p>The squabbling continued. The senior Mr. Farah pushed for
added plant capacity that he felt would increase efficiency.
Jimmy argued that the company already had high inventory
levels and too much production capacity. The father ended the
debate with a curt, "I know what I'm doing," Jimmy recalls.</p>
<p>"People say I was my father's whipping boy," he says.
"They were right."</p>
<p>The sorest point for the family was the patriarch's
refusal to discuss a plan of succession. The issue led to
much screaming behind closed doors, company officials say.
Family-business consultants were flown in for group therapy
sessions; family members urged Willie -- unsuccessfully -- to
attend seminars on coping with family businesses.</p>
<p>Jimmy and Robert finally offered to sell their stock in
1986, which their father interpreted as an act of disloyalty,
says Jimmy. Kenneth, meantime, secretly began lining up
creditor support for a takeover bid. But word leaked to his
father, who summoned him to his office.</p>
<p>In a tense meeting also attended by Jimmy and Robert,
Kenneth Farah recalls, Mr. Farah searched his son's briefcase
for company documents and asked what the offer was going to
be. He was told $21.50 a share -- the stock was trading at
about $18 -- which he brusquely dismissed as too low.</p>
<p>Then he summoned security guards to escort the banished
scion to his car. "I spent Thanksgiving and Christmas with my
in-laws," Kenneth says. "Holidays haven't been the same
since."</p>
<p>Soon thereafter, Robert and Jimmy were forced out as well.
Mr. Farah was firmly in command again, but sales were
declining and inventories growing to dangerous levels. Still,
he inexplicably pressed for more production capacity.
Eventually, he put the money-losing company on the auction
block, but the only bid was quickly withdrawn. To avoid a
bankruptcy-court filing, the company sold its profitable
Generra unit to a managementled group for $27 million.</p>
<p>With troubles mounting, Mr. Farah agreed, in the summer of
1989, to step down as chief executive in exchange for a $1.2
million payment and $365,000 a year for three years of
consulting. But senior company officials and board members
say they warned the new CEO, Richard Allender, to expect
constant meddling from Mr. Farah, who remained chairman. "I
knew what I was getting into," Mr. Allender concedes.</p>
<p>Indeed, within months, the two men were engaging in
spirited -- and highly public -- debates about everything
from company strategy to painting the walls (Mr. Farah
objected to Mr. Allender's plan to change the wall color from
red to gray). Mr. Allender wanted to improve quality by
abandoning automated production in favor of hand-stitched
garments, an idea that enraged Mr. Farah, the father of the
company's automated process.</p>
<p>Frustrated, Mr. Farah wrote angry letters to board members
in March, insisting that they either oust the new management
or step down themselves. The move backfired badly. His fellow
directors booted him off the board and named private investor
Thomas G. Wyman chairman.</p>
<p>The motion was supported by Mr. Farah's then-pregnant
daughter Haleen, who had privately told other board members
that she had "no confidence" in her father. She declines to
comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Farah filed suit in El Paso county court, seeking to
have the company restrained from limiting his role. He
contended the Farah board was filled with "spiteful
conspirators" out to ruin him financially. The company
countersued, contending Mr. Farah's fight was just a scheme
to postpone payment on a $750,000 company loan. Both suits
are pending.</p>
<p>Mr. Wyman, the new chairman, complains that Mr. Farah
"walks around the building telling employees and executives
that he will fire them if he regains control for supporting
top management. That doesn't do much for morale."</p>
<p>Mr. Farah, who still has an office in the building because
of his consulting contract, won't comment on such specifics.
But he says he has done nothing wrong. He says the company is
breaking under the weight of an inexperienced board and a
management team that he derides as "dummies." He blames the
company's problems on poor quality, a bad delivery record and
misguided strategy.</p>
<p>At the center of the storm, Mr. Allender talks bravely
about the new Farah, with its new lighting system, new
computers and new training program in Mexico and Costa Rica.
He boasts of new, higher-quality products for respected
retailers such as Macy's and Dillards that will forever shuck
the company's image as the king of polyester. By spring, he
predicts, Farah will be profitable.</p>
<p>That would be a significant turnaround. For 1989, the
company had a net loss of $11.6 million. It is carrying about
$68 million in debt. And after a $1.4 million second-quarter
loss this year, its stock has skidded to less than $3 a share
from its 1990 peak of $8.</p>
<p>A tense Mr. Farah complains that his office phone is
tapped and that Farah officials changed the locks on several
sections of the building to keep him from mingling with key
employees. He also claims the company is spying on him. Over
barbecued chicken and black coffee at a Dallas restaurant, he
warily eyes a customer reading a newspaper nearby. "He's been
listening to every word I'm saying," he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Farah says he has "no relationship" with Jimmy or with
his daughter, who, he adds, hasn't let him and his wife visit
his daughter's new son. "Haleen has been mad at me since the
day I fired Jimmy," he says. "But if Jimmy knew what he was
doing, he'd still be running the company." He pauses, then
adds: "We worked like dogs all of our lives for ourselves and
for our kids. We gave them one million shares {250,000 shares
each}. Maybe we gave them too much. In retrospect, I would
have given them the shares, but no voting power."</p>
<p>The sons, who once dreamed of inheriting the company, now
have scattered. Kenneth sells baby furniture and Robert sells
photographic equipment; Jimmy, who serves as a consultant to
apparel manufacturers, recently completed his first
venture-capital transaction. Distance hasn't eased the
tension. Last Christmas, when Jimmy showed up at a dinner
given by Kenneth and his wife, Lysa, his father abruptly rose
from the table and walked out of the house.</p>
<p>While his family celebrated the season inside, Willie
Farah, the once and perhaps future garment king, stewed in
his car for three hours.</p>
<p>Jimmy talks haltingly about his father. "If there's
something I really want to be quoted in this article as
saying, it's that I really love my pop, I miss my pop," he
says. Why can't he say that in person? "It's too difficult,"
he says. "Believe me, I've tried."</p>
