	<p class="article-leader">Shortly before Christmas 1985, Raymond Belknap shot
himself in the head with a 12-gauge shotgun after drinking
beer and listening to heavy metal music. Now, a Nevada court
is trying to determine just who is to blame for Mr. Belknap's
death.
   Judges and juries have become increasingly willing to
allow plaintiffs to spread -- and in some cases shift
entirely -- the responsibility for tragic events caused by
their own behavior.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Some legal specialists say the courts are sending a
message to consumers that their own role in accidents is no
longer important. And they say the Belknap case is one of
several pending around the country that may change the legal
meaning of personal responsibility.</p>
<p>Defense lawyers see that as an ominous prospect. They say
consumers are forced to pay for the misbehavior of others in
higher prices and the unavailability of new products. The
American Ladder Institute, a trade group, says 15% to 25% of
a ladder's price goes to legal and liability costs. Most
suits, the group says, are brought by plaintiffs harmed in
accidents while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.</p>
<p>Twenty-five years ago, most juries couldn't have returned
a verdict in favor of a plaintiff if he was in any way
responsible for his injuries. Now most states let juries and
courts weigh the fault of each party. In some states, a
company found to be as little as 1% responsible for an
accident may be held liable for some of the damages.</p>
<p>The new rules developed partly out of a belief by many
judges that corporations are better equipped than individuals
both to prevent accidents and to absorb their cost. "People
do stupid things because they don't expect the consequences
to occur," says John F. Banzhaf III, a product liability
specialist with the George Washington University National Law
Center. "Corporate behavior is readily affected by changes in
the legal rules. Individual behavior is not."</p>
<p>Worries over these liability issues have attracted the
attention of Congress. Robert W. Kasten Jr. (R., Wis.) and 30
other senators have sponsored a bill that would bar
plaintiffs who were under the influence of alcohol or drugs
from collecting damages if their condition was more than 50%
responsible for their injuries. The bill's sponsors have
reasoned that society shouldn't bear the costs of such
accidents and that the measure "will encourage persons to
take responsibility for their own safety and the safety of
others."</p>
<p>The Belknap case, in state court in Reno, is being closely
watched because the makers of albums -- unlike makers of
power lawn mowers or swimming pools -- have generally been
shielded from such suits by the First Amendment. Two similar
cases, involving the rock singer Ozzy Osbourne, are pending
in Georgia.</p>
<p>Mr. Belknap's parents say subliminal messages in the music
of heavy metal band Judas Priest induced their son to kill
himself. And they say the band, CBS Records, which
distributed the album, and CBS Inc. bear responsibility. (As
part of its purchase of CBS Records in 1988, Sony Corp.
agreed that the record unit would pay any judgment against
CBS Inc.) The judge in the case ruled that subliminal
messages aren't protected by the First Amendment.</p>
<p>Kenneth McKenna, a lawyer for the Belknaps, says CBS is
liable because the company should have foreseen that someone
such as Mr. Belknap might respond violently to the music.
"Drinking beer, smoking pot, being a dropout from school, and
having depression is normal for a Judas Priest purchaser,"
says Mr. McKenna, a Reno lawyer. "CBS and Judas Priest failed
to protect for that lowest-common-denominator consumer." The
parents of James Vance, who shot himself in the same incident
but survived, are also plaintiffs in the suit.</p>
<p>CBS argues that Mr. Belknap and Mr. Vance were troubled
youths who abused drugs and alcohol and whose behavior wasn't
connected to the music.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs' lawyers contend that people shouldn't bear
sole blame for behavior encouraged at least partly by others.
In 1985, Eric Abreu, then seven years old, fell off a
15-foot-high sculpture in a Manhattan playground accident
that left him a quadriplegic. Lawyers for the city argued
that, while tragic, the accident could have been avoided
because Eric's mother had warned him not to climb the
sculpture.</p>
<p>A jury verdict in the city's favor was thrown out by the
judge, and a state appeals court ordered a new trial. Harvey
Weitz, who represented Eric at the second trial, says the
city knew children were climbing to the top of the sculpture
and should have had safeguards. In the new trial, a jury
found Eric bore a small part of the blame but awarded him
$33.3 million in damages. The award, later cut by the judge
to $11.5 million, is on appeal.</p>
<p>D. Daniel Engstrand Jr., a partner in the New York law
firm Doniger, Garland & Engstrand, who represented the city
at the second trial, says he personally feels Eric is
entitled to some compensation, but calls the enormous verdict
"a miscarriage since Eric's {behavior} played a great deal in
the injury he sustained, and he knew he should not climb up
there."</p>
<p>In some recent cases, juries and judges have been
receptive to plaintiffs' claims that they can't be blamed for
their behavior if the harmful consequences of their actions
aren't commonly known. The rulings have opened up new
liability for alcohol distillers, who had been protected from
product-liability suits on the grounds that the risks of
drinking are well-known.</p>
<p>In November 1983, college freshman Marie Brinkmeyer died
after an evening of drinking shots of tequila with some
friends in Kingsville, Texas. Her mother sued Brown-Forman
Inc., the distiller that made the tequila, alleging the
company should have warned consumers about possible dangers.</p>
<p>In 1988, a state appeals court in Corpus Christi, Texas,
reversed a lower court's dismissal of the suit. The appeals
panel wasn't convinced that the public understood that
consuming excessive quantities of alcohol can result in death
and that a trial should be held on the issue of whether
Brown-Forman had a duty to warn consumers of that hazard. A
trial is set for next year in Corpus Christi.</p>
<p>James B. Ragan, a lawyer for the plaintiff, says it isn't
fair to blame Ms. Brinkmeyer for her death. Advertising
portrays drinking as glamorous and plays down possible
dangers, he says. "She's a victim of the misperception of
alcohol as something worthwhile and enjoyable," says Mr.
Ragan, a Corpus Christi lawyer. Lawyers for Brown-Forman say
they can't comment because the case is pending.</p>
<p>A federal appeals court in Philadelphia in 1988 reversed a
lower court's dismissal and ordered a trial in the case of
William Hon, who died of pancreatitis at the age of 26. The
suit, brought by his wife, alleged that Mr. Hon consumed two
to three cans of Stroh Brewery Co.'s beer four nights a week
for six years. The court wrote that the public was unaware of
the risk of pancreatitis from moderate, though long-term,
consumption of beer, and that Stroh could be held liable for
failing to warn of the risk. A trial is scheduled for October
in federal district court in Scranton, Pa. A lawyer for Stroh
says he can't comment because the case is pending.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs' lawyers say they are unsure what effect a new
federal law requiring alcoholic-beverage containers to carry
health warnings will have on such suits. But these lawyers
say a recent decision by the New Jersey Supreme Court in a
suit involving cigarette smoking could be harmful to the
alcoholic beverage industry.</p>
<p>In 1982, Claire Dewey filed suit in Hackensack, N.J.,
against Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., American Brands
Inc. and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., alleging that they are
liable for the death of her husband, Wilfred Dewey, from lung
cancer at age 49. Mr. Dewey smoked Camels, Tareytons and
Viceroys for 40 years.</p>
<p>In the decision, reached in July, the New Jersey high
court ruled that Mrs. Dewey can proceed with her lawsuit
because Congress didn't intend to immunize cigarette makers
against such suits when they ordered warnings on cigarette
packages in 1966. Courts previously had found that the
federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act protected
tobacco companies from liability.</p>
<p>The notion that a consumer can sue a tobacco company after
years of smoking and despite warning labels is "a sign our
legal system has gone awry," says Martin London, a partner in
the New York firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, a
lawyer for Brown & Williamson. "It is a kind of thinking that
is totally at odds with the history and spirit of American
jurisprudence and social mores." Brown & Williamson, a unit
of B.A.T Industries PLC, and R.J. Reynolds, a unit of RJR
Nabisco Inc., haven't yet decided whether to appeal; American
Brands didn't participate in the appeal before the state high
court.</p>
<p>Marc Z. Edell, a partner in the Short Hills, N.J., law
firm of Budd, Larner, Gross, Rosenbaum, Greenberg & Sade, a
lawyer for Mrs. Dewey, says companies bear responsibility
because they deliberately attempt to undermine warning labels
through ads and other means.</p>
