	<p class="article-leader">Less than a month after reporting discovery of the gene
for neurofibromatosis, often but mistakenly called the
Elephant Man's disease, scientists uncovered their first
clues on how the gene may cause the mysterious malady.
   The neurofibromatosis gene is closely related to genes
involved in cancer, reported scientists with the Howard
Hughes Medical Institute at the University of Utah in Salt
Lake City.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The new finding bolsters hopes for a treatment for the
disease as well as for new insight into the genetic bases of
cancer, researchers said.</p>
<p>The sudden and rapid advances in understanding
neurofibromatosis, a genetic disease that has baffled medical
scientists for a century, illustrates the power of
biologists' new ability to find or "map" genes. The discovery
of the NF-1 gene, as it's now being called, was announced
July 13, the climax of a search that had begun less than five
years earlier. Now, only four weeks later, the scientists
report they've found the first indications of what the
mysterious gene does.</p>
<p>"We didn't expect this {discovery} for at least five
years," said Allan Rubenstein, a neurologist at Mount Sinai
School of Medicine in New York and medical director of the
National Neurofibromatosis Foundation which, along with the
Hughes institute, funded the research.</p>
<p>The rapid progress against neurofibromatosis is likely to
be cited by backers of the new federally funded Human Genome
Project as evidence of the payoffs that can come from
locating or "mapping" human genes. The project, predicted to
cost $200 million a year, is aimed at mapping all 50,000 to
100,000 genes, collectively called the human genome, that are
the biological blueprints for human life.</p>
<p>Neurofibromatosis, which afflicts about 100,000 Americans,
is so named because its most notable features are fibrous
lumps that grow from the nerves in the skin. In rare cases,
nodules proliferate in the skin and over the bones to produce
grotesque features. John Merrick, the "Elephant Man" who
became a celebrity in England in the 1890s and was the
subject of a 1980 movie, originally was thought to have had
neurofibromatosis but is now believed to have had a different
and far rarer disorder known as Proteus syndrome.</p>
<p>Most people with neurofibromatosis are of normal or
near-normal appearance but many suffer non-malignant brain
and nerve tumors and/or neurological problems that can lead
to learning disabilities, blindness or deafness. The disorder
also is known as von Recklinghausen's disease, after the
German physician who first described it in 1882.</p>
<p>The Utah scientists, headed by molecular geneticist Ray
White, reported in the biology journal, Cell, that they had
taken the next step following discovery of the NF-1 gene. The
gene, like all genes, is the molecular blueprint for a
protein. With the gene in hand the scientists said they've
now been able to "read" part of this molecular blueprint. It
produces a protein that is remarkably similar to the GAP
protein, which is known to be involved in the cancer process,
they reported.</p>
<p>The discovery led the scientists to speculate that the
NF-1 protein, like the GAP protein, normally may serve as a
brake on cell proliferation, preventing a cell from
multiplying into a tumor. If the NF-1 gene is damaged, as it
appears to be in neurofibromatosis, it either cannot make the
protein or produces a non-functioning form of it and the cell
is no longer held in check. Instead it proliferates
uncontrolled and grows into a tumor. Whether the tumor is
malignant may depend on other genes in the chain of genetic
events that lead to cancer.</p>
<p>Mr. White cautioned that speculation that the NF-1 gene is
a "tumor suppressor" gene is based solely on its molecular
similarities with the GAP protein and its gene and with two
cancer-related genes found in yeasts. But he and other
scientists said that if the speculation is proved correct, it
raises hopes that a treatment for neurofibromatosis can be
found. If true, "we would know from which direction a therapy
might come," said Peter Bellermann, president of the
neurofibromatosis foundation. If the disorder is the result
of the lack of the NF-1 protein, then the disease might be
treated by supplying the protein as a medication, for
example.</p>
<p>The Utah scientists' chief competitors, a scientific team
at the University of Michigan, agreed. "This is a very nice,
happy outcome" resulting from the discovery of the NF-1 gene,
said Michigan molecular geneticist Francis Collins. "It
allows us to leap-frog over two to three years of research;
it puts us in a position of having a path to follow" to gain
a treatment for the disease.</p>
<p>Mr. Collins, whose team tied the Utah group last month in
the race to discover the NF-1 gene, said that his Michigan
team has made the same discovery as Mr. White's group and
will publish a paper soon confirming the Utah findings.</p>
