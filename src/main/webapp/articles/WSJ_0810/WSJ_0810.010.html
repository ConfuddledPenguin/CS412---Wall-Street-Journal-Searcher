	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The landmark savings-and-loan cleanup bill
was signed into law one year ago this week, but don't expect
any celebrations with cake and confetti.
   A year after President Bush proclaimed the S&L debacle to
be on the road to solution, the administration and Congress
are mired more deeply than ever in what has become the
nation's biggest financial crisis since the Depression.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Indeed, the S&L anniversary serves as a reminder that the
underlying causes of the mess -- government by delay and
diffused responsibility -- haven't changed a bit one year
later. "There has been an absolute breakdown in political
accountability," says Thomas "Lud" Ashley, a former
Democratic congressman from Ohio and a close friend of Mr.
Bush.</p>
<p>Adds Scott Hodge, a budget analyst for the conservative
Heritage Foundation: "I don't blame voters for not knowing
where to turn. To throw this bum out might just mean you get
another bum."</p>
<p>The administration defends both the bailout law and its
own record in handling the crisis. The anniversary "is not an
occasion for celebration, nor is it an occasion for despair,"
says John Robson, undersecretary of the Treasury. First and
foremost, officials say, they have succeeded in keeping the
federal government's time-honored promise to protect
depositors.</p>
<p>But administration officials also acknowledge that the
efforts of the past year have resulted in a host of
consequences they never intended. Faced with initial
complaints that few sick S&Ls were being sold, the new
bailout agency created by the law went into high gear in this
year's April-June quarter and blew a hole in the federal
budget, prompting President Bush's admission that a tax
increase is possible. Some economists blame the real-estate
slump on S&L overbuilding, and see the current credit crunch
as a reaction to freewheeling S&L lending.</p>
<p>Further, the news from the thrift front will take an
especially ugly turn if the U.S. moves into a recession,
causing more S&Ls to fail and driving bailout costs even
higher. Banks, saddled with huge debts to the Third World and
their own extensive real-estate lending, could suffer big
losses, too.</p>
<p>To be sure, if energy prices soar due to a sudden shortage
of Mideast oil supplies, the Texas economy might rebound. But
prices would have to be high and sustained before improved
prices in Texas real estate would take some of the sting out
of the bailout costs.</p>
<p>Right now, at least, the main response to the looming S&L
crisis is an orgy of political recrimination that shows no
signs of abating. Next month, House Banking Committee
Chairman Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas) plans high-profile
hearings that will haul former Reagan administration
officials such as ex-Treasury Secretary Donald Regan before
the committee to account for their actions, or inactions.
Also capturing public attention next month will be hearings
on the role of Neil Bush, the president's son, in the $1
billion failure of Colorado's Silverado Savings & Loan.</p>
<p>Support is also building in Congress and elsewhere for a
presidential commission to investigate the causes of the S&L
crisis -- which will almost certainly provide more grist for
the blame game.</p>
<p>Congress has also made a major show of going after
so-called "S&L kingpins," most recently with its swiftly
passed thrift-fraud bill. But even some proponents of the law
acknowledge it will likely have little practical impact,
since it isn't retroactive and many of the offenses were
committed years ago. Moreover, despite voter fury at S&L
executives, most observers believe bad business decisions by
an undersupervised industry were far more to blame than
out-and-out fraud. "The incidence of fraud is clearly being
exaggerated," says Stanford University economist Daniel
Brumbaugh. "It's all window dressing."</p>
<p>Officials involved in the bailout say the swirling
politics surrounding the effort are complicating their job
just as they move into what may be the most sensitive phase:
the attempt to sell off the billions of dollars of
real-estate assets that have been salvaged from the dead
institutions.</p>
<p>Already, a bevy of congressional committees have hauled
current and former regulators to Capitol Hill to grill them
on sales of institutions, salaries paid, and why they are
moving slowly and costing money, or quickly and imprudently.
The accusatory atmosphere has regulators looking nervously
over their shoulders before they commit to a sale and,
officials say, may also drive away some potential buyers.</p>
<p>"They haul these guys up and hang them in the middle of
the village square," says Treasury's Mr. Robson. "There are
people who will say, `I don't need that.'"</p>
<p>Yet many in Congress say the administration must accept
part of the blame for the supercharged atmosphere through
their own behavior. "They set themselves up for accusations
that sound political," says Sen. Bob Kerrey (D., Neb.) "We
have almost no accountability for the expenditures they are
making. They control all the information in this."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, neither Congress nor the administration has yet
managed to do much about the major pending issues that both
admit have to be addressed. One big problem is the cleanup
law itself. There so far has been little political appetite
for reopening and rewriting the controversial measure, even
though some of its contradictory provisions have regulators
throwing up their hands in frustration.</p>
<p>Among other things, the regulators are having a hard time
reconciling the bill's requirements that they sell seized
property as quickly as possible, and that they not affect
real-estate markets. The law also was intended to make
thrifts invest more prudently, yet it forces them to put
their money almost entirely into one area, home mortgages.</p>
<p>Already, several federal courts have challenged parts of
the bailout law, and some observers say major parts of it
could be in serious legal jeopardy unless Congress and the
administration fix it. "There was a lot of mindless vengeance
in the law," warns Dallas thrift attorney Richard Kneipper.
"We're going to see a lot more of these suits."</p>
<p>Both Congress and the administration have been reluctant
to press the politically sensitive issue of federal deposit
insurance, despite the fact that many officials admit that
the increase in deposit insurance to $100,000 was a major
contributing factor in the debacle. Any serious discussion of
the issue has been shoved back at least until the Treasury
Department completes a study on the subject at the end of the
year -- safely after the November elections.</p>
<p>Another major contributing factor also remains
unaddressed: the campaign-finance laws. The Senate passed a
spending-limit bill last week before it recessed, but
President Bush believes it is skewed toward favoring
Democrats, and it is certain veto bait. Meanwhile, candidates
of both parties are engaged in a game of
return-the-thrift-industry-contributions, trumpeting their
virtue after accepting, in some cases, tens of thousands of
dollars from thrifts for years.</p>
<p>"It doesn't make any difference if you've blown the
country to hell financially," says former Rep. Ashley. "You
still get elected."</p>
