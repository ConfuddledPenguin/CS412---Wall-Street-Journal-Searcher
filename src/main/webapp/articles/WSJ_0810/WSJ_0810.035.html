	<p class="article-leader">CENCOR Inc., a Kansas City, Mo.-based consumer finance and
temporary services concern, said it plans a reverse 1-for-5
stock split in hopes of making its shares more attractive to
investors. The company said it has about 5.7 million
pre-reverse-split shares outstanding and said that the move
will be effective Aug. 31. CenCor closed yesterday at $1.43,
a level that deters many investors, the company said.</p>
