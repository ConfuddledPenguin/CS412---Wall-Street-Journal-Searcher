	<p class="article-leader">Although few people study classical Greek anymore, the
language continues to influence modern life in unexpected
ways. Traditional introductory texts used to try to sugarcoat
the student's task of memorizing the Greek verb down to and
including the middle aorist tense by dangling in front of him
English cognates of Greek words. This gambit tended to defeat
the purpose of bringing the tongue of Aristotle down home,
because the cognates often were words the student didn't know
in English (noetic). But, as Heraclitus said, what goes
around comes around.
   These days, the Greek genius is again at work in our
speech, right at the cutting edge of new scientific jargon.
Just the other day, this page was asked to print the word
"biome." This is not a word you will find in Plato, but it is
built on a Greek suffix, -ome, indicating a group (unlike
Astrodome, which is Latin and attracts groups). Biome is even
in the American Heritage Dictionary, which defines it as "a
community of living organisms of a single major ecological
region." Biomedically speaking, the person who coined this
term needs his cephalosome examined and should be exiled to
some other biosphere.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A trend, however, is a trend. Come biome, come genome. And
you don't have to be some chrome-domed gnome to have guessed
that genome means a group of genes. In actual fact,
biologists now use genome to refer collectively to all the
genes in the human body.</p>
<p>Enthusiasm for this term in the biochemical community, a
subset of the grant-hungry Ph.d-ome, is running high now
because of a scientific cash cow called the genome project,
whose goal is to map every one of the 50,000 to 100,000 genes
evolution has given us. Maybe this is a good thing, and maybe
it will sap funding from more focused gene mapping.</p>
<p>Why should we care? Because the often hit-or-miss mapping
of our chemical heredity has already solved major medical
mysteries and should solve others. That's the story two
Journal medical reporters, Jerry E. Bishop and Michael
Waldholz, tell in "Genome," (Simon & Schuster, $21.95, 352
pages).</p>
<p>Their method is an extension of what they do regularly for
this newspaper, mixing solid research, lucid exposition and
illustrative anecdotes in order to bring the news of medical
science to the general public. In "Genome," they combine a
mass of complicated material, which they shape into an always
graceful flow of narrative. But this story was especially
hard to structure, since it is really two stories. One is a
grand sweeping epic of discovery that will continue until the
entire genome is mapped.</p>
<p>This story begins with the discovery of the laws of
heredity by the Austrian monk Gregor Mendel in 1866 and goes
on to the even higher drama of the discovery of the structure
of the genetic material DNA in 1953. Messrs. Bishop and
Waldholz (hereinafter known as B-W) provide a quick refresher
course in all these basics and then slow down to give a
richly human account of the central inspiration that turned
gene mapping into a practical business.</p>
<p>This bolt from the blue was actually the unexpected
culmination of years of humdrum genealogical record-keeping
by the Mormon Church in Salt Lake City. By the spring of
1979, when various local graduate students in biology and
genetics gathered to discuss their research at the nearby ski
resort of Alta, the church had been permitting geneticists to
use its archives as a data bank for the study of hereditary
diseases. At the Alta meeting, a graduate student spoke about
attempts to map the gene causing hematochromatosis to
chromosome 6. The hunt for that gene had progressed because
researchers had found a "marker" in the chromosome and linked
it with the gene. If only there were other such markers,
another graduate student remarked, other diseases could be
pinned down to specific genes.</p>
<p>In the audience was a visiting luminary named David
Botstein. "The MIT biologist," B-W write, "was gaining a
reputation somewhat akin to that of a rock star among the
young scientists. A large, barrel-chested man with jet-black
curly hair and a gap-toothed smile, Botstein had a
combination of self-confidence and garrulousness that
graduate students rarely saw in their mentors. He loved to
talk and relished long, often detailed accounts of his
theories and concepts, of his scientific conquests, and of
other scientists' flaws."</p>
<p>To anyone who knew Mr. Botstein as an earnest
undergraduate dropping unhappily out of a music major into
science, because he didn't think he had what it took
musically, this description will seem especially piquant. But
the real interest of the story is Mr. Botstein's astounding
theoretical improvisation at the Alta meeting, when he
started talking and didn't stop until he had worked out how
the markers the student wanted might be found. He saw that
the state of his science had progressed to the point where
previously unconnected bits of technique could be manipulated
to uncover just those markers the student had wished for.</p>
<p>"Genome's" second story is a series of episodes in which
scientists pursue those markers and, by luck and toil, find
them. It is an exciting story with profound implications for
the human future.</p>
