	<p class="article-leader">The Justice Department, in an action civil-rights
advocates hailed as a landmark lawsuit, asked a federal court
to end Georgia's runoff election system, which requires a
candidate to receive over 50% of the vote to be elected.
   The majority-vote requirement, which is similar to that of
eight other southern states, was adopted in 1964 and
maintained as a means of preventing blacks from being
elected, the Justice Department charged in a suit filed in
Atlanta.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The suit is the department's first across-the-board
challenge to a state's elections for federal, state and
county positions. The Georgia system, the federal suit
charged, violates the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the 14th
and 15th Amendments to the Constitution. In a separate
pending legal proceeding, the department claims that Georgia
discriminates on racial grounds in the way it elects many of
its judges.</p>
<p>Perry Michael, Georgia's executive assistant attorney
general, declined to comment on the suit. But he said state
officials were "very surprised" by the action, because a
group of Georgia citizens already had challenged the majority
requirement in a similar suit filed in May.</p>
<p>The federal suit "is very significant because it shows
that the Justice Department will be much more active than it
had been (under former President Reagan) in trying to stop
discriminatory voting practices," said Robert McDuff, an
attorney with the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under
Law, a Washington advocacy group.</p>
<p>The majority-vote requirement has its most obvious impact
in primaries in which black candidates win the most votes but
don't achieve an outright majority. In subsequent runoff
elections, whites in Georgia typically have voted along
racial lines to defeat black candidates, the Justice
Department charged.</p>
<p>The Georgia system, said the department's civil-rights
chief, John Dunne, "has denied the state's black citizens an
equal opportunity to participate in the political process."
He said that 26.5% of Georgia's voters are black, according
to 1980 census figures, but only 10% of the state's elected
officials are black.</p>
<p>Mr. Dunne said news reports at the time the Georgia system
was created had described state legislators' desire to
prevent "Negro bloc voting." That purpose provides "the
smoking gun" in demonstrating the illegal discriminatory
intent behind the majority-vote requirement, Mr. Dunne said.</p>
<p>The other states with runoff systems similar to Georgia's
are: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, Oklahoma,
Mississippi, South Carolina and Texas. Mr. Dunne said that
the Justice Department isn't aware of discriminatory results
related to the majority-vote requirements in any of these
other states and that it isn't investigating them.</p>
<p>He added that the department's suit wouldn't affect this
year's gubernatorial election in Georgia. In a Democratic
primary runoff this week, Lt. Gov. Zell Miller beat former
Atlanta mayor and congressman Andrew Young, who had sought to
be the state's first black governor.</p>

<p>APPEALS COURT RULES Alabama hazardous-waste curbs
unconstitutional.</p>
<p>The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta ruled
that an Alabama law prohibiting disposal of out-of-state
hazardous waste in Alabama -- unless the state where the
waste was generated has similar facilities -- violates the
commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>Under the law, Alabama issued a "blacklist" barring the
acceptance of hazardous waste from 22 states and the District
of Columbia. The law, passed last fall, forced many companies
to ship their hazardous waste to other disposal facilities,
adding significantly to the companies' costs.</p>
<p>The appeals panel's decision had been closely watched by
the hazardous-waste industry, as well as legislators in other
states considering adopting similar laws. The panel
overturned a ruling by a lower court in January upholding the
constitutionality of the law.</p>
<p>The case arose from a lawsuit filed by Chemical Waste
Management Inc., which runs the nation's largest and
Alabama's only commercial hazardous-waste management
facility, located in Emelle. The National Solid Wastes
Management Association, a trade association for the
waste-management industry, is also a plaintiff in the case.</p>
<p>The appeals panel acknowledged that many states are
concerned about minimizing the dangers to public health and
to the environment created by hazardous wastes. But the panel
found that Alabama's law barred the wastes only of certain
states, placing an unfair burden on interstate commerce and
violating the Constitution. In addition, the panel ruled that
Alabama's regulation of hazardous-waste land disposal was
pre-empted by Congress's intention that those decisions be
regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency on a
nationwide basis, in order to insure that certain states do
not become dumping grounds.</p>
<p>In a prepared statement, Alabama Gov. Guy Hunt said the
state was still looking at the decision but intended to seek
a rehearing or review by the U.S. Supreme Court. He said that
the Alabama law had received "broad support in this country
among the states" and that he felt each state should create
their own hazardous-waste management program.</p>
<p>But Allen Moore, president of the National Solid Wastes
Management Association, said in a statement that the decision
means that states cannot act on their own to create such
programs.</p>
<p>"This is not to say that only a few states should satisfy
the nation's hazardous-waste disposal needs. There is a role
for every state, and the federal government must assure that
all states do their part," Mr. Moore said.</p>

<p>SEC ACCUSES BROKERS and company of teaming up to
manipulate IPO.</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission accused Beres
Industries Inc., two of its officers, the president of a
now-defunct brokerage firm and four other individuals of
fraud and stock manipulation.</p>
<p>In the civil suit, filed in federal court in Newark, N.J.,
the SEC said the scheme began with the over-the-counter
company's initial public offering in June 1986 and ended in
March 1989 when the brokerage firm, Monmouth Investments
Inc., went out of business. Beres' stock, which had traded
between $1 and $4 during the alleged scheme, immediately
collapsed with the closing of Monmouth, the SEC said, and
recently traded as low as six cents a share.</p>
<p>The individual defendants include Charles Beres Sr., the
founder and chairman of Beres; Charles Beres Jr., chief
executive officer; and Arden Brown, formerly president of
Monmouth, which was based in Englishtown, N.J., before it
closed. Monmouth wasn't named in the lawsuit. Beres, which
makes plastic molds, is based in Lakewood, N.J.</p>
<p>The SEC charged that Mr. Brown told Beres that Monmouth
would underwrite the initial public offering only if Mr.
Brown was given 10% of the company's stock in addition to its
usual underwriting fees. The SEC charged that this
arrangement was never disclosed to investors.</p>
<p>Before the initial public offering, there were nine
million restricted Beres shares, mainly held by Beres
insiders, the SEC said. About a third of those shares were
eventually sold to Monmouth for far less than the prevailing
market price, the SEC alleged. Monmouth turned around and
sold the stock at higher prices through misleading
boiler-room techniques, the lawsuit said.</p>
<p>The SEC said that during the initial stock offering,
Monmouth solicited customers and arranged for later purchases
at preset, arbitrary prices. These arranged sales made it
appear that the stock was in demand after the initial public
offering, the SEC said. The defendants' lawyers couldn't be
reached for comment.</p>
<p>The SEC is seeking a court order banning the defendants
from securities law violations. It also asked the court to
order them to turn over their allegedly illegal profits,
estimated to total $4.5 million.</p>

<p>STATE JUDGES begin effort to resolve asbestos litigation.</p>
<p>Although recent actions by federal judges have put
asbestos personal-injury litigation in the news, the bulk of
the cases are before state courts. Working in conjunction
with some of the federal judges, three state judges from New
York, Baltimore and Philadelphia have begun planning a
conference for this fall at which about a dozen judges from
across the country will meet to discuss the issue.</p>
<p>Several federal judges are meeting today in Washington to
discuss a possible asbestos personal-injury class action and
other nationwide approaches to resolving the cases. New York
state Justice Helen Freedman of Manhattan said the state
judges plan to focus on alternative ways to encourage the
parties to settle the suits and avoid going to trial.</p>
<p>Many judges have become frustrated with the growing
backlog of asbestos cases, and some fear that the defendants
may run out of funds before all the claims are paid.
Asbestos, once widely used in shipbuilding and construction,
causes cancer and respiratory ailments.</p>
<p>Justice Freedman, with 2,000 asbestos cases pending, said
a claims-resolution system needs to be set up to ensure that
the more seriously ill claimants are paid first and to speed
up the compensation process.</p>

<p>A FEMALE MINISTER charges that she was sexually harassed
by a male pastor.</p>
<p>In a lawsuit believed to be the first of its kind, the
Rev. Susan E. Black alleges that the Rev. William R. Snyder,
pastor of St. John's Lutheran Church in Minneapolis, made
unwelcome sexual advances toward her during the 15 months she
served as the church's associate minister. She claims Mr.
Snyder described the two of them as being "in love."</p>
<p>In her suit, filed in Hennepin County District Court, Ms.
Black is also charging Mr. Snyder, the church and its
denomination, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America,
with violating Minnesota's "whistleblower statute," which
bars organizations from firing employees engaged in a legal
action against those organizations.</p>
<p>St. John's congregation dismissed Ms. Black in June, two
months after she filed a complaint against Mr. Snyder with
the Minnesota Department of Human Rights.</p>
<p>In a statement, Bishop David W. Olsen of the
denomination's Minnesota Area Synod denied that church
officials had retaliated against her for filing the
complaint. He said a church committee, which investigated Ms.
Black's charges earlier this year, concluded that Mr.
Snyder's behavior was "extremely inappropriate for
professional relationships," but found no grounds for taking
disciplinary measures against the pastor.</p>
<p>Karl Cambronne, a lawyer for Mr. Snyder and St. John's,
said he will file a motion to dismiss the suit on First
Amendment grounds. He added, "Factually, (Ms. Black's) claim
is lacking."</p>
