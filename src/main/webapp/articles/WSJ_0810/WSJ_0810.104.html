	<p class="article-leader">BUILD FIRST, cried the developers, and ask questions
later. So they rushed out to build and build and build -- and
now, sifting the rubble of the ensuing bust in commercial
real estate, they and their lenders are facing the questions
at last. Questions like these:
   -- How could so many people have been so mistaken? (A very
good question. The blinding attraction of money has something
to do with it. So does the psychology of builders.)</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>-- How bad are things, anyway? (Very bad. See below.)</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>What a difference a couple of years make. In most parts of
the country, it seemed hard not to make money building office
and other commercial space in the 1980s. Real-estate values
were rising faster than developers could get their buildings
up. Eager to cut a piece of the pie for themselves, an army
of lenders -- syndicators, thrifts, insurance companies,
overseas banks, pension funds -- showered developers with
capital. They took it and built still more, because building
is what they do.</p>
<p>The result was almost foreordained. Today many cities are
full of see-through office buildings -- few tenants are there
to clutter up the line of sight -- and the gush of capital
has been cut to a trickle. New office space is the last thing
most places need. Among big-city downtown markets, commercial
vacancy rates are 23% in Denver, 24% in Miami and 29% in
Phoenix, according to Cushman & Wakefield, a New York-based
real-estate brokerage and consulting firm.</p>
<p>Suburbia has not been spared, either. In most places
commercial vacancy rates are higher there than downtown;
Philadelphia's suburban rate, to cite just one, is 21%,
compared with 11% in the city proper.</p>
<p>Given their psychology, it's hard to blame developers for
the bust. "The nature of a developer is to be optimistic and
aggressive as long as the banks and insurance companies and
pension funds will lend him money," says Jack Sonnenblick, a
New York mortgage broker. Others say that it's hard to find a
developer who isn't absolutely convinced that his project
will be a smash. The other guy's may well fail, he might
concede -- but never his. This kind of thinking is one reason
Donald Trump has been put on an allowance by his creditors.</p>
<p>A lot of his colleagues aren't in much better shape. To
fill the empty spaces they've built, many are making big
concessions to tenants. In Chicago, 30% discounts on quoted
rental rates are common. Several Boston developers have
offered "signing bonuses" of more than $1 million to lure
tenants.</p>
<p>The cost of such concessions and continuing low occupancy
rates are making it difficult for developers to cover their
day-to-day expenses, much less their mortgage payments.
Facing major potential losses on loans, some of their lenders
are reluctantly carrying them for a while rather than winding
up as unwilling owners of various white elephants.</p>
<p>And those white elephants won't change color any time soon
if demographic trends are to be believed. The expansion of
the work force is slowing greatly, indicating only tepid new
demand in the future. "It's not a growth industry anymore,"
says Ronald Rayevich, president of Prudential Insurance Co.
of America's real-estate unit.</p>
<p>One thing everyone agrees on is that any recovery will be
slow and painful. Salomon Brothers forecasts that up to 14
years may pass until the national commercial vacancy rate
drops to 5%, long considered a "natural" level by the
industry.</p>
<p>One reason: Total demand for office space is falling at
about the same rate as the decline in new construction. "The
nearly parallel descending paths of supply and demand make it
clear that market equilibrium is several years away and that
a painful process of adjustment continues to lie ahead," says
Salomon Brothers.</p>
<p>Some major commercial projects undertaken when prospects
were bright are still coming on line and adding to the
surplus. Although new construction essentially has stopped in
cities like Houston and Denver, downtown Chicago and midtown
New York each added about two million square feet in the
second quarter of 1990.</p>
<p>But real estate is essentially a local business, and
generalizations about the national picture frequently don't
apply to specific cities, states and regions. For example,
one of the hardest-hit regions in the early stages of the
slump -- the Southwest -- now appears on the road to at least
a modest recovery.</p>
<p>Market conditions are improving in Houston and Dallas, the
first cities beset by what Jack Barthell of Kenneth Leventhal
& Co. calls a "revolving recession" in the nation's office
market -- a recession that has moved from city to city and
region to region over time. Although vacancy rates in Houston
and Dallas remain among the highest in the country,
developers there are benefiting from a Texas economy that is
diversifying beyond oil, from a moratorium on new
construction, and from corporate relocations to the area,
particularly in the Dallas market.</p>
<p>Denver and New Orleans, two other energy-dependent cities,
have a bleaker outlook. They haven't diversified enough to
offset the impact of falling oil prices, which stifled
industry development and left them with a lot of empty space.
"It's hard to see where the demographics, the economics are
going to come from to turn Denver around," says Mr. Barthell.</p>
<p>Analysts believe that major cities in the Northeast, hit
much later by the rolling recession, have fundamental
advantages that may help them ride it out. Overbuilding has
not been too severe, and their economies are diverse. "They
are not going to enter the prolonged downturn that we've seen
in the energy patch," says Lloyd Linford, publisher of REIS
Reports, a New York real-estate newsletter.</p>
<p>Some areas -- Seattle, San Francisco, Sacramento and parts
of the Los Angeles-area market -- have prospered while the
rest of the country has suffered. In several of these cities,
restrictions on growth have worked to sustain the office
market by curbing oversupply. In Seattle, for example,
city-imposed controls on new construction prevented
developers from saturating the market in response to office
demand spurred by the growth of Boeing, the city's largest
employer.</p>
<p>But some experts think the West Coast's glory days are
about over. In Los Angeles, cutbacks in aerospace defense
work may weaken the office market, and this, together with
new construction on line, could jack up the city's vacancy
rate to as much as 24% from the current 16%.</p>
<p>Washington, D.C., which has avoided most effects of the
national slump, could also suffer in the future. Because
federal law forbids construction of any building in
Washington taller than the U.S. Capitol, high-rise
overexpansion has been curbed. But low-rise projects have
not, and their completion, together with reductions in the
rate of federal spending, may greatly soften the market
there. "Its day of reckoning has just been delayed," Mr.
Linford warns.</p>
<p>As for the nation as a whole, adoption of proper
regulatory and tax policy can at least help to discourage
overbuilding in the future, says Prof. Kerry Vandell,
chairman of the real-estate department at the University of
Wisconsin.</p>
<p>The free market is already imposing a discipline of its
own; fewer developers will be around to overbuild. Indeed,
some analysts see contractions of up to 30% in
construction-related industries. Without the cash to take on
new projects and with so much leverage in existing projects,
says Prof. Vandell, "a lot of the more marginal folks are
just out of the business."</p>
