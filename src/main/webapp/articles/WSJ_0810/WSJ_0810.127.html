	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Bertelsmann AG replaced the president of its
RCA Records label, Robert Buziak, with the head of RCA's
country music division, Joseph Galante. Industry executives
said the move signals a change in strategy at RCA and they
applauded Mr. Galante's business acumen, despite reservations
about his lack of experience in pop music.
   Mr. Galante, 40 years old, has been with RCA since 1971,
and though his background is in finance, he is credited with
signing some of RCA's biggest country stars and turning its
Nashville-based country music division into the most
profitable segment by far. Among other acts, Mr. Galante
signed during the '80s the country band "Alabama," which has
sold more than 40 million albums.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Buziak, who couldn't be reached for comment, is said
to be discussing a joint venture with Bertelsmann under which
he would continue to sign up and work with musicians. During
his four years as president, Mr. Buziak almost completely
rebuilt the RCA artist roster, buying out contracts from a
number of stars past their prime and steering RCA into what
he called "cutting-edge music." Some of the groups he signed
such as "Cowboy Junkies" built up loyal followings and sold
well, but none have become household names.</p>
<p>RCA insiders said that German media giant Bertelsmann,
which bought RCA in 1986, hasn't been satisfied with Mr.
Buziak's progress in turning the company around.</p>
<p>"We've made progress in the right direction, but I believe
we need a push to get to the next level," said Michael
Dornemann, chairman and chief executive officer of
Bertelsmann Music Group (BMG), which includes RCA, Arista and
Ariola and operations in 30 countries. He said Mr. Buziak's
departure is "a friendly move. We want to keep his creative
talent but develop a different kind of relationship."</p>
<p>Mr. Dornemann said that since Bertelsmann acquired RCA,
its market share has risen to about 5.5% of U.S. record
sales, from about 4.5% when it was bought. (RCA's market
share soared even higher several years ago from the movie
soundtrack album, "Dirty Dancing," but that was a temporary
phenomenon.)</p>
<p>Industry executives say, Mr. Buziak gave RCA a much hipper
image and helped it build a base in the important black music
market by hiring Skip Miller, former president of Motown, in
1988. Mr. Buziak also arranged for RCA to distribute records
for the British label, Jive, which has a number of popular
black artists.</p>
<p>Executives who reported to Mr. Buziak said he was a very
hands-on manager who didn't delegate decisions about which
acts to hire and how to handle them. Mr. Galante, described
as a capable manager with a down-to-earth manner, doesn't
have any contacts so far in the rock and pop world and says
his style will be different.</p>
<p>"My strategy is to broaden the base: we have to be deeper
in other segments of the business," said Mr. Galante. "I will
have people under me signing artists. It is my responsibility
to run the business. I'm not professing to be the A&R
{artists and repertoire} guru of the '90s for RCA."</p>
