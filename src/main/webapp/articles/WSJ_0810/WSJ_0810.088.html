	<p class="article-leader">California's largest hospital association sued the state's
health department director, alleging that "woefully
inadequate" state Medi-Cal outpatient reimbursements violate
federal laws and cripple health care to the poor.
   Medi-Cal funds are matched by federal Medicaid dollars to
provide health care to 3.4 million eligible Californians.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The California Association of Hospitals and Health Systems
and the Orthopaedic Hospital in Los Angeles filed a lawsuit
against Ken Kizer, director of the State Department of Health
Service, in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. The
association says that outpatient service payments average 55
cents for every dollar hospitals spend to provide the care.
"Hospitals are getting clobbered with these rates," said C.
Duane Dauner, president of the association.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the state health department declined to
immediately comment on the lawsuit.</p>
<p>Mr. Dauner said California hospitals lose more than
$575,000 a day providing outpatient services to Medi-Cal
patients. He also said that since 1982, the state has
increased payment rates to hospitals for Medi-Cal outpatients
by 2%, while hospital costs have risen 50%. Similar lawsuits
in four states have resulted in higher payment rates to
hospitals, he said.</p>
