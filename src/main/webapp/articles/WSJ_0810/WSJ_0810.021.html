	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and a strike by
workers in Flint, Mich., are forcing General Motors Corp. to
halt production at two of its U.S. assembly plants.
   GM said it will have to idle its car plant in Ypsilanti,
Mich., and lay off 4,200 workers for two weeks beginning Aug.
13 because the Gulf conflict has derailed an order for
Chevrolet Caprices and Buick Estate Wagons.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Kuwait is one of the best overseas markets for North
American-made GM cars. Kuwaitis particularly liked big,
full-sized GM sedans such as the Caprice. The auto maker had
two dealerships in Kuwait that sold about 10,000 GM vehicles
in 1989, most of them built in North America. GM sold a total
of about 40,000 vehicles in the entire Mideast region last
year.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, GM said it was suspending work on
contracts with Iraq's State Enterprise for Automotive
Industry under which the auto maker was to have helped the
Iraqis build a plant that would assemble North American
designed GM cars and trucks.</p>
<p>Separately, GM began to feel the effects of a strike at a
key parts-making facility in Flint. The auto maker yesterday
idled its truck plant in Moraine, Ohio, that builds sport
utility vehicles, putting 2,500 workers on lay-off.</p>
<p>GM may have to idle as many as two more plants today
because they've run out of parts supplied by the Flint
operation, a company spokesman said. He declined to identify
which plants could be affected. GM has said as many as eight
of its North American assembly factories could be idled
within the next few days if the Flint walkout isn't resolved.</p>
<p>Negotiations to settle the strike continued yesterday, but
without any apparent movement. "There hasn't been anything
serious to discuss," a top UAW official said yesterday. Talks
are scheduled to continue today.</p>
