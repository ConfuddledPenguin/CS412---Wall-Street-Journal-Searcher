	<p class="article-leader">RACINE, Wis. -- In this city of 82,000 on Lake Michigan's
shore, memories still linger of the 22% unemployment that
struck here less than a decade ago.
   That's why residents voice growing concern over effects of
sharply higher oil prices, rising interest rates and a
softening economy. "Here we go again," says Joe Mrazek, a
local developer who has been instrumental in rejuvenating
this city's downtown, where big blue "Re-discover Downtown"
banners wave.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In cities across the U.S., residents are beginning to
wonder just how much their economic lives will be affected by
the events in the Mideast and an already fragile economy.
Here and elsewhere, residents, business owners and city
officials haven't taken any bold steps yet to counter what
could be difficult times ahead.</p>
<p>But they're worried. Mayor Owen Davies, for instance, says
a lot hinges on the continued prosperity of the city's
biggest employer, J.I. Case International. The farm-equipment
maker, a unit of Tenneco Co., employs 3,000 workers locally
and is building its new $100 million headquarters complex
along the bending shores of the Root River here.</p>
<p>Tax receipts from the company's big project are earmarked
to help restore an economically depressed area of western
Racine. Should Case be unable to complete its five-year
phased project, as planned, "then our growth will be
stymied," says Mr. Davies. He adds: "We've been on a good
roll lately, so we don't think that's going to happen."</p>
<p>Still, a spokesman for Case, which is enjoying its own
resurgence, acknowledges that "this company, like any other,
is susceptible to the ebb and flow of the economy."</p>
<p>Racine residents think they're in better shape to weather
a business downturn now than they were a decade ago. A new
$20 million marina and festival hall downtown is bringing in
more tourist dollars. In addition, low housing costs here
have been drawing young families here from Milwaukee, just 25
miles north, and Chicago, 65 miles south.</p>
<p>The city's strategic location and decreased dependence on
industry "will keep us from going back to where we were,"
contends Jess Levin, president of the Bank of Elmwood. "I'm
not expecting anything like the '80s."</p>
<p>The real estate market, though, already is slowing. Mr.
Mrazek, who has built two new office buildings, says he is
"very concerned." And the softening market comes as two big
projects near completion: a 72-unit lakefront condominium
project and a separate development of 20 townhomes and 104
condominium units with private boat slips.</p>
<p>At the showpiece Frank Lloyd Wright-designed headquarters
of S.C. Johnson & Son, fresh recession worries haven't hit
yet. But veteran employees of the privately held
consumer-products giant recall what happened when troubles
hit in the early 1980s. The company froze wages for one year
and trimmed its payroll by about 300 through an
early-retirement program.</p>
