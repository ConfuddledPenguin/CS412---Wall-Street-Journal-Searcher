	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The dollar rose marginally against most
currencies as world financial markets remained fixated on the
Persian Gulf.
   Five previous sessions of tough trading had clearly taken
a toll on currency dealers. Between bursts of activity,
trading practically dried up. Those who stayed involved kept
their heads down.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Between its high and low for the day, the dollar strayed
less than a pfennig and little more than half a yen.</p>
<p>In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.5965
marks, up from 1.5925 marks late Wednesday in New York. The
U.S. currency was changing hands at 1.3433 Swiss francs,
above 1.3385 francs late Wednesday.</p>
<p>Against the yen, the dollar was unchanged at 149.80 yen.</p>
<p>In Tokyo Friday, the dollar was trading soon after the
opening at 149.55 yen, down from Thursday's Tokyo close of
149.68 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about
1.5930 marks; in Tokyo Thursday, it closed at 1.5913 marks.</p>
<p>Thursday provided some unsettling Mideast developments.
Iraq closed its border in both directions to foreigners,
trapping many inside. U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia swelled as
the Defense Department reported threatening Iraqi troop
movements in Kuwait.</p>
<p>None of this swayed the dollar much. "So many one-liners
are coming across our screens that the market is a bit
desensitized to news," said Thomas Benfer, a senior currency
marketing representative in New York with Bank of Montreal.
He was refering to the newswire headlines that traders
receive electronically.</p>
<p>Also keeping rates stable yesterday was the absence of
speculators, many of whom were counting their losses from
previous sessions rather than actively trading, Mr. Benfer
said.</p>
<p>But unlike previous days, when the dollar sank every time
the Mideast situation seemed to calm down, the U.S. currency
remained well bid up throughout New York trading. A
successful auction of 30-year bonds in the third leg of the
U.S. Treasury's quarterly refunding helped to buoy the
dollar.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the yen reclaimed ground against European
currencies. The mark fell to 93.83 yen in late New York
trading yesterday from 94.066 yen late Wednesday. The British
pound eased to 279.83 yen from 280.07 yen.</p>
<p>Pent-up demand for the yen was released by declining
crude-oil prices. The September futures contract on the New
York Mercantile Exchange fell 29 cents a barrel to $25.67 a
barrel.</p>
<p>Interest in the Japanese currency was somewhat restrained,
however, by another reversal on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
After having recovered Wednesday, the Nikkei stock index fell
893.41 points to 27615.73, its lowest level in nearly two
years.</p>
<p>Among other currencies, investors sought out those of
nations with high domestic interest rates. The Canadian,
Australian and New Zealand dollars and the British pound all
saw buying interest.</p>
<p>"People are waiting for all this to blow over. A lot of
people are going for the high yields, because they don't want
to take a risk on the dollar," said Robin Cheung, a New York
vice president for Unibank. "They know these currencies won't
be hurt too much by the situation in the Middle East."</p>
<p>However, the pound was trading slightly lower against the
dollar late in the day, declining to $1.8680 from $1.8696
late Wednesday.</p>
<p>The dollar ended European dealings mostly weaker, although
it cut little fresh ground and moved within relatively narrow
ranges throughout the day.</p>
<p>In Tokyo, the dollar finished lower in sluggish dealings
Thursday, with the market's ranks thinned by vacationers.
Those who remained were apparently exhausted by a week of
tension in the Middle East.</p>
<p>The dollar finished in Tokyo at 149.68 yen, below
Wednesday's close of 150 yen.</p>
<p>Tokyo foreign-exchange traders said position adjustment
before the peak of the Japanese vacation season next week
could carry the yen higher against European currencies in
coming days.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $385.80, up $2.60. Estimated volume was a
moderate 3.5 million ounces.</p>
<p>In early trading in Hong Kong Friday, gold was quoted at
$387.05 an ounce.</p>
