	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- World Bank executive directors cleared the
way for Argentina to receive the second $150 million
installment of a $300 million loan approved in late 1988 to
support trade-policy adjustments in the South American
country.
   In other actions, the World Bank cleared a $130 million
loan to Pakistan to help expand natural-gas distribution
facilities and reduce the country's dependence on imported
oil.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Also, the International Development Association, a World
Bank affiliate, approved a $64 million credit to China for
agricultural development projects along the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>The World Bank decided this year to delay the Argentine
loan because the government had failed to carry out broader
economic policy actions required under the original loan
agreement. It was reported last week that the Argentine
government expected to get the money later this month. The
loans would help finance the country's efforts to ease its
import and export restrictions.</p>
<p>The loan to Pakistan will help finance the construction of
a gas-purification plant at Sui, in the southwestern part of
the country. As part of the same project, Sui Northern Gas
Pipelines Ltd. will increase its gas-distribution network
serving the Northern and Central parts of the country by 300
million cubic feet a day.</p>
