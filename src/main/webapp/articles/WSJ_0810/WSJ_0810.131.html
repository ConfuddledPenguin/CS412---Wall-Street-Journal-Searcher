	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo stocks plummeted on selling by arbitragers and major
brokerage houses, mainly related to the expiration of August
options Thursday, traders said.
   Meanwhile, London shares finished modestly firmer in quiet
trading in what traders termed a session of consolidation
after several days in volatile waters.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Tokyo's Nikkei Index, thrust down by large sell orders at
the close from Japan's Nomura Securities and Belgium's
Societe Generale, traders said, finished at the lowest level
in nearly two years. The index of 225 issues was down 893.41
points at 27615.73.</p>
<p>In Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei index rose 10.57 points to
close the morning session at 27626.30.</p>
<p>Thursday's volume on the first section was estimated at
380 million shares, down from 577 million shares Wednesday.
Decliners outnumbered gainers 623 to 318, while 155 issues
were unchanged.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section retreated 31.61 points, or 1.51%, to 2068.41.</p>
<p>The second section index rose 22.25 points, or 0.54%, to
4122.94. Volume in the section was estimated at 15 million
shares, up slightly from 14.1 million shares Wednesday.</p>
<p>Investors remain uncertain on how to participate amid the
crisis in the Middle East, traders said, although some
institutions have been buying sporadically because prices
have fallen substantially since Iraq invaded Kuwait.</p>
<p>Small-capital shares were attracting some buying interest
Thursday, seen as an optimistic move by a market in the face
of the Persian Gulf crisis, though several traders said they
think prices on these shares had room to fall even further.</p>
<p>Although the market isn't yet sure of a bottom for the
indexes, investors have at least accepted that a higher level
for oil prices will remain for some time, likely to put heavy
pressure on consumer prices in Japan and the U.S., one trader
at a U.K. firm said.</p>
<p>Reflecting broader market uncertainty on developments in
the Middle East and fears of looming inflation, short sellers
were active in the morning, traders said. Some of these short
sellers later bought to cover the borrowed positions.</p>
<p>But prices didn't recover as the short sellers had
expected, traders said. With futures indexes closing at a
discount to spot indexes Wednesday, arbitrage selling
pressure weighed heavily on cash prices throughout the day.</p>
<p>Although the arbitrage selling boosted the futures
indexes, on which price movements inspired some straight
buying on both futures and cash indexes, gains couldn't
withstand options expiration-linked brokerage selling,
traders said.</p>
<p>Because Thursday was August index-options expiration day,
investors holding open positions on put options, particularly
at 28000 points for the Nikkei, would seek to pressure the
index as low as possible in order to gain the widest premium,
traders said.</p>
<p>At the close, program sell orders on the Nikkei 225 issues
forced prices about an additional 200 points lower, as a lack
of buying to meet the orders flooded the market.</p>
<p>Other participants could foresee the impact of the sell
orders, placed well in advance of the close, resulting in a
last-minute sell-off by the broader market, one domestic
broker said.</p>
<p>On the other hand, during the last minutes of futures
trading, which ends 15 minutes after spot trading, futures
were bought higher, shrinking the discount for Topix futures
to cash, and pushing Nikkei futures back to a large premium.</p>
<p>One futures and options trader at a foreign securities
firm said the premium is just wide enough that there's a
possibility that arbitrage buying on the Nikkei cash index
will occur early Friday.</p>
<p>Lower Thursday as a result of stabler oil prices were oil
shares such as Teikoku Oil, down 100 yen to 1720 yen (67
cents to $11.48). Nippon Oil fell 30 yen to 1420 yen, while
Mitsubishi Oil fell 50 yen to 1270 yen.</p>
<p>Steel shares lost gains from Wednesday. Daido Steel fell
39 yen to 790 yen,  Kobe Steel fell 30 yen to 500 yen,
Kawasaki Steel dropped 15 yen to 499 yen, and NKK dropped 26
yen to 500 yen.</p>
<p>Advantest rose 390 yen to 5800 yen, while Anritsu gained
50 yen to 2270 yen.</p>
<p>Construction, financial, metal and mining shares were
lower.</p>
<p>In London, despite a flood of corporate earnings news,
which wasn't particularly optimistic about the state of
corporate profitability for blue chips, dealers said the
market largely overlooked the figures in favor of watching
the Middle East.</p>
<p>Dealers added that investors headed for the sidelines
until the market's near-term direction could be seen clearer.
And Wall Street's early uninspiring initial performance kept
dealings at a minimum, traders said.</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index was up
7.4 points to 2244.9. The Financial Times 30 Share Index
gained 4.3 points to 1752.8. Volume was 329.4 million shares,
compared with 429.2 million shares Wednesday.</p>
<p>Among corporate features, Shell Transport & Trading fell 9
pence to 482 pence (17 cents to $9.01). The U.K. oil giant
said second-quarter profit fell 44% to #563 million, in the
midrange of market forecasts.</p>
<p>British Petroleum fell 6 pence to 358 pence. The company
said net profit in the second quarter slid 89% on a historic
basis to #53 million, just short of market expectations of
#60 million to #153 million.</p>
<p>British Telecom advanced 5 pence to 292 pence. Britain's
largest telecommunications concern reported a 17% rise in
first-quarter pretax profit, helped by improved cost controls
and growth in most of its markets.</p>
<p>Cadbury Schweppes firmed 3 pence to 333 pence. The U.K.
Department of Trade and Industry said it won't refer to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission the company's #125 million
acquisition of  Source Perrier's non-cola soft-drinks
business.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, share prices closed higher in Paris, Frankfurt,
Zurich, Madrid and Stockholm, lower in Milan, and mixed in
Amsterdam and Brussels. South African gold stocks closed
narrowly mixed.</p>
<p>Also, stocks closed lower in Taipei, Hong Kong and
Wellington, were mixed in Sydney, higher in Seoul, and little
changed in Manila. Singapore was closed.</p>
<p>Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.</p>
