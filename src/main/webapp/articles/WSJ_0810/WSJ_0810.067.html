	<p class="article-leader">When George Bush became president, he replaced portraits
of Calvin Coolidge and William Howard Taft in the White House
Cabinet Room with one of Theodore Roosevelt. Sometime later
he ad-libbed, in his typically goofy way, "Maybe I'll turn
out to be a Teddy Roosevelt."
   This week that doesn't sound so goofy. Toward Iraq, Mr.
Bush has literally spoken softly but wielded a big stick. The
"pastel president" (in one writer's cutting phrase) has acted
in primary colors. The man who only a week ago seemed a patsy
for Congress this week successfully orchestrates the biggest
military-diplomatic operation since Vietnam. It's clear
Washington still hasn't taken the measure of George Bush.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It's easy to underestimate George Bush," says Thomas
Ashley, a Democrat who's known him since Yale. "Because he's
so damn genteel and nice."</p>
<p>Saddam Hussein has exposed both the genteel and the
competitive Bush, the establishment Connecticut and the
oil-rig Texas Bush. He trusted the word of two Arab
presidents that Iraq wouldn't invade Kuwait, and later
Saddam's word that he was pulling out. When neither turned
out to be true, a fed-up president blurted out on the White
House lawn, "He lied." The reaction wasn't staged, aides
insist.</p>
<p>Newt Gingrich, the House minority whip and historian,
likes to compare Mr. Bush to Eisenhower. But he's had a hard
time deciding which Ike. The general slowly but methodically
drove Hitler across Europe. The president governed slyly but
gave up the domestic political offensive to Democrats. The
Bush presidency contains elements of both Ikes. Mr. Bush may
lack Ronald Reagan's convictions (low taxes, etc.), says Mr.
Gingrich, but he has as much if not more courage when he can
find the convictions.</p>
<p>Nor is Mr. Bush one to agonize over decisions. In the
Iraqi case, one senior aide became convinced at the first
National Security Council meeting on the crisis that Mr. Bush
would act to reverse the invasion of Kuwait. "That's when he
really laid it on the table," says the aide. When one adviser
talked about having to adjust to a post-invasion world, Mr.
Bush shot back, what do you mean a post-invasion world?</p>
<p>"He was snapping off the things to be done," says an
official who was there. "Get `Chapter 7' sanctions going at
the U.N. Call King Fahd. Call Ozal. He had most of it in his
head."</p>
<p>Much is made of the many heads of state Mr. Bush knows,
but perhaps more should be made of his era. He's probably the
last American president who will have fought in World War II;
the metaphor of Munich is personal. He's also a product of
the era of postwar U.S. global leadership. He may therefore
be the right president for the post-Cold War era -- he knows
the necessity of U.S. leadership but he also has the
personality to persuade more independent allies.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush also understands executive power, which may be
one reason he's bolder overseas than at home. He knows a
president has more freedom in foreign policy. Mr. Bush likes
to say he did more work in one year as CIA director than in
four years as a Congressman. At this week's cabinet meeting,
he cracked that at least this crisis occurred with Congress
out of session.</p>
<p>He doesn't mind consulting with Congress, but detests its
micromanagement. As part of the effort to persuade Saudi's
King Fahd to invite U.S. forces, he quickly waived the
Metzenbaum amendment -- a restriction on the sale of the U.S.
jets to the kingdom. He didn't call Sen. Metzenbaum first.</p>
<p>The paradox is that, with Panama and now Iraq, Mr. Bush
may yet achieve what Ronald Reagan could not -- the
restoration of U.S. consensus on the use of military force.
Support for him this week was nearly unanimous. Even Jesse
Jackson said Saddam had to go. While Saddam's ruthlessness
and the lack of Soviet opposition explain part of that
unanimity, Mr. Bush's personal method may as well.</p>
<p>Some Democrats had felt Mr. Bush's "consultation" was too
perfunctory before the Panama action. This time Mr. Bush had
lunch with House Speaker Thomas Foley on Monday, and called
him again Tuesday morning. Mr. Foley was among the most
supportive Democrats once Mr. Bush dispatched troops.</p>
<p>The conventional political wisdom now is that Mr. Bush
will have a "rally-round-the-flag" fillip, followed by
trouble if the crisis drags on. Perhaps. But this is wisdom
culled from history (Vietnam) that rarely repeats itself. Mr.
Bush is laying out a doctrine for deterring aggression in a
changed world. In a sense, he's reversing the West's
humiliation in the Mideast with the Suez failure of 1956,
when Eisenhower vetoed the British and French overthrow of
Nasser. Having risked his presidency on Saddam's withdrawal
from Kuwait -- "this will not stand" -- it seems unlikely
he'll settle for stalemate.</p>
<p>Even in the post-Cold War era, the rest of the world is
still looking for U.S. leadership. (Anybody see Japan or
Germany leading this week?) Whatever the troubles ahead,
George Bush deserves credit for providing it.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Clarification: Florida Democrat Charles Bennett says I
misjudged him in last week's column. He says he was
describing the House Armed Services Committee's big defense
cuts in the context of deploring them.</p>
