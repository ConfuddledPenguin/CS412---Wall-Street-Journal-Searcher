	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Honda Motor Co. established a wholly owned
automobile importing and sales subsidiary in Verona, Italy,
scheduled to begin operations in October.
   To be called Honda Automobili Italia S.p.A., the unit was
capitalized at 43 billion lire ($36.9 million). The new
subsidiary will handle and reinforce automobile operations
previously managed by Honda Italia Industriale S.p.A., which
also manages motorcycle manufacturing and sales, as well as
power-product importing and sales.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Honda said that Italy's automobile market, with 2.362
million passenger vehicles sold in 1989, is the
second-largest in Europe next to West Germany. Not including
off-road, four-wheel drive vehicles, Japanese passenger
vehicles account for 8,579 units of this total, Honda said.</p>
<p>Italy's market has grown at a 45% pace over the past five
years, the Japanese auto maker said.</p>
<p>Honda Automobili Italia is expected to sell 4,500 units in
1990, including projected sales of 2,900 units through
September by the former sales office, the parent company
said. Sales are seen at 7,500 units in 1991.</p>
<p>There is an import restriction for Japanese vehicles in
Italy, so Honda has been selling its automobiles through
licensed import. Italian sales of its Concerto model began in
April. The Concerto is produced by U.K. auto maker Rover
Group, a unit of British Aerospace PLC.</p>
