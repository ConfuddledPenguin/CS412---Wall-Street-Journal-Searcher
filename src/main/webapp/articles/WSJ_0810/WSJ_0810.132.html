	<p class="article-leader">Open-Ended HMOs Lure
   Wary to Try Out Plans</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>ENROLLMENT IN open ended HMOs is surging, but the programs
could have a short life span.</p>
<p>This hybrid type of health maintenance organization first
became popular in the late 1980s as a way of luring more
employees away from traditional, and more expensive,
indemnity insurance plans. As with most HMOs, individuals who
join an open-ended plan are directed to specific doctors and
hospitals. But patients are also allowed -- if they're
willing to pay higher deductibles -- to see doctors outside
the network.</p>
<p>"It gives them a full-time safety valve," says Martin
Rosen, a vice president at Sanus, a managed-health-care
company based in Fort Lee, N.J. Individuals who join
open-ended plans, he says, are willing to try HMO doctors --
if for no other reason than to save a few dollars.
"Invariably, they find that they like those doctors, that
managed care is OK," he says.</p>
<p>Sanus has been offering the option for almost two years.
Today, one-quarter of the 600,000 members in its HMO, as well
as the bulk of new members, are enrolled in an open-ended
plan.</p>
<p>Indeed, says InterStudy, a research firm in Excelsior,
Minn., enrollment in such plans jumped 39% in 1989, compared
with a 3.6% rise at traditional HMOs.</p>
<p>Some health-care experts, however, predict the programs
could soon become victims of their own success. As more
people accept the idea of HMOs, the open-ended part of
open-ended plans may become superfluous. "Within seven years,
75% to 80% of people will be in a managedcare product," says
Leonard Abramson, president of U.S. Healthcare, Blue Bell,
Pa.</p>
<p>Retiree Health Plans</p>
<p>Face Big Overhauls</p>
<p>MORE COMPANIES are taking some strong medicine to control
retiree health-care costs.</p>
<p>About 80% of surveyed companies say they intend to change
their medical plans for retirees in the next two years, says
Hewitt Associates, a benefits consultant in Lincolnshire,
Ill. Many employers, says Hewitt's Gary Laugharn, are being
squeezed by the unrelenting growth in healthcare bills, as
well as by proposed accounting changes requiring companies to
set up huge reserves to fund retiree benefits.</p>
<p>Vons Cos., for example, offered a generous health plan to
its retirees until recently, providing coverage with
virtually no deductible or premiums. "It was a richer benefit
than what our active employees have," says Dick Gonzales,
director of compensation management at the Los Angeles-based
grocery retailer.</p>
<p>But on July 1, Vons moved to a system in which retiring
non-union employees will receive a onetime allocation of
credits based on length of service. A person who retires
after 20 years would receive $41,320 in credits; an employee
with 10 years would get $20,660. Those credits will be used
to pay annual premiums -- ranging from $1,400 to $4,000 --
for one of two insurance plans Vons offers.</p>
<p>Vons's plan now resembles a conventional pension plan,
says Mr. Laugharn, a change more firms are considering. For
Vons's part, Mr. Gonzales estimates the plan could cut
expenses in half under the accounting changes.</p>
<p>Fewer Blank Checks</p>
<p>To Cover Job Injuries</p>
<p>WORKERS' compensation costs are an increasingly popular
target among companies seeking to hold down medical bills.</p>
<p>In 1989, employers plowed about $45 billion into workers'
compensation insurance, which provides cash and medical
benefits to workers with job-related injuries or diseases.
That's almost double the figure of a decade earlier. Medical
costs, in particular, have contributed to that growth:
Between 1980 and 1989, the average claim jumped to $3,420
from $1,724, says the National Council on Compensation
Insurance.</p>
<p>Employers, however, while moving aggressively in the past
decade to hold down costs in conventional health plans,
typically have taken a hands-off attitude toward medical
claims filed under workers' compensation. Because such
programs are governed by state regulations, says Larry L.
Madlem, president and chief executive officer of SouthCare
Medical Alliance, an Atlanta-based managed-care company, many
employers have believed mistakenly that they had little or no
control over medical charges. Some companies, Mr. Madlem
says, don't even bother to review claims under $10,000 -- an
invitation for significant abuse.</p>
<p>Now, however, companies are starting to apply some tried
and true techniques to hold down costs. Mr. Madlem cites the
example of an Atlanta manufacturer that had lost track of the
physicians used by injured employees. The company simply paid
the bills. Early this year, it adopted a preferred-provider
plan that delivers, among other services, fee schedules and
discounted rates at selected hospitals -- all of which could
cut bills as much as 30%.</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>ABOUT 10% of U.S. hospitals are in serious financial
trouble, according to a study by Health Care Investment
Analysts in Baltimore. Of those hospitals, about 200 could
end up closing their doors within three years. The study used
12 guidelines to identify the weakest facilities, including
cash flow and occupancy rates. Illinois, Massachusetts,
Oklahoma and Pennsylvania had large numbers of troubled
hospitals. . . . More than 900,000 cardiac catheterizations
-- the process of examining the heart by passing a tube into
it -- are performed in the U.S. every year. But costs vary
widely, according to Metropolitan Life Insurance. The average
charge is $4,820, but costs range from $3,210 in Wisconsin to
almost $8,000 in California.</p>
