	<p class="article-leader">Asian nations face slower economic growth and faster
inflation if Mideast tensions keep world oil prices high and
push the already-sluggish U.S. economy into recession. But
economists say the region, the world's fastest-growing, would
avoid a recession itself because of the momentum of its
expansion and increasing intraregional investment and trade.
   "I don't think we can talk about a recession in Asia,
where the average GDP is growing 4% to 6%," says Nicholas
Kwan, an economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in
Singapore. GDP, or gross domestic product, measures output of
goods and services, minus foreign income.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Most economies in the region already were expected to slow
this year, partly because of sluggishness in the U.S., the
biggest buyer of Asian products, and partly because of
capacity constraints after five years of rapid expansion. Mr.
Kwan says rising oil prices could reduce growth rates by half
a percentage point in 1990.</p>
<p>But economists say the region is less vulnerable to an
oil-price shock now than in the 1970s. For most Asian
countries, oil makes up a smaller component of total imports
and supplies a smaller share of total energy needs.</p>
<p>The region also is less reliant on the American economy
than a decade ago because exporters have diversified markets
and domestic demand has risen sharply. In addition, Japan has
become an important market and source of investment capital
for the rest of the region.</p>
<p>"With the outflow of direct foreign investment from Japan
into Southeast Asia over the past five years, intraregional
trade will keep the region going for some time," says C. Suan
Tan, chief resident economist for the Pacific Rim Institute
of Comparative Economic Studies at the University of Hong
Kong.</p>
<p>Despite its dependence on imported oil, many economists
expect the Japanese economy to fare relatively better than
the U.S. during the next year. Even if an economic slowdown
in Japan leads to reductions in overseas investment,
economists believe that Japanese investments in the region
would be affected less than investments in U.S. and Europe.</p>
<p>Also, in the oil shocks of the 1970s, Japan and the "Four
Tigers" -- Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan --
showed remarkable agility in shifting gears to meet new
demands. William Overholt, regional strategist for Bankers
Trust Securities (Pacific) Ltd. in Hong Kong, says the
fast-adjusting Asian economies are likely to emerge from
another oil shock with increased market share for their
exports.</p>
<p>Except for Indonesia, Malaysia, China and Brunei,
Asian-Pacific nations are net oil importers, so higher oil
prices generally mean higher inflation. Central banks are
likely to keep interest rates high to damp inflation.</p>
<p>As the region's biggest oil exporter, Indonesia could
benefit most from the price increase, unless higher prices
force a recession in the U.S. and hurt Indonesia's exports of
manufactured goods and basic commodities such as rubber.
Before the Mideast crisis, according to Merrill Lynch in
Singapore, Indonesia's 1990 GDP was expected to grow by about
7.2%, the same as in 1989.</p>
<p>"We like to see the price {of oil} rise, but not in this
manner," says a Trade Ministry official in Jakarta. "It can
cause a recession in the developed countries that will
depress our non-oil exports."</p>
<p>Hardest-hit by higher oil prices will be the Philippines,
which depends on imported oil for the bulk of its energy
needs. The Philippines also has about 50,000 laborers in Iraq
and Kuwait.</p>
<p>The Philippine trade gap already is worrisome, reaching
$1.59 billion in May. Inflation is about 13%. Moreover, the
economy was hit hard by a coup attempt in December and a
severe earthquake last month. Before the Mideast crisis, says
Merrill Lynch, the Philippines' 1990 GDP was expected to rise
about 4%, down from 5.6% in 1989. With an oil-price increase
looming, a Manila banker asks, "What more can go wrong?"</p>
<p>South Korea's trade performance already is deteriorating.
Sluggish export growth and rising imports in the first seven
months pushed the current account into deficit of $1.1
billion, the first deficit since 1985. The current account
measures trade in goods and services, plus certain financial
transfers.</p>
<p>Korea also stands to lose billions of dollars of overseas
construction income. Korean companies have 13 construction
jobs under way in Iraq and four in Kuwait, with a total value
of $2.51 billion.</p>
<p>Taiwan's export performance was weak before the Mideast
crisis, and the U.S. is its biggest market. In the first
seven months, total exports fell 0.9% from a year earlier.
"The export outlook of this country isn't very promising this
year," says David Yang, an economist with Taipei's
International Commercial Bank of China.</p>
<p>Although Hong Kong has diversified its markets during the
past few years, it still sends about 30% of its domestic
exports to the U.S. The slowdown in the U.S. and continuing
economic woes in China -- where much of Hong Kong's
manufacturing base is now located -- already have caused Hong
Kong's exports and growth to slow this year.</p>
<p>Although an oil exporter, China isn't expected to gain
much from an oil-price increase. Premier Li Peng said this
week that the amount of oil available for export "will
probably fall due to growing domestic demand."</p>
