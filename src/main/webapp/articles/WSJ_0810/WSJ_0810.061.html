	<h3>Politics & Policy: RTC Discloses Insolvent S&Ls' Losses in Period</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The 247 insolvent savings and loan
associations in line to be sold or liquidated by the
government posted losses totaling $2.3 billion for the second
quarter.
   The financial results of the insolvent S&Ls are the first
to be disclosed by the Resolution Trust Corp., the savings
and loan bailout agency created a year ago. Previously the
results of the entire thrift industry, with no separate
earnings figures for the insolvent ones, were announced by
the Office of Thrift Supervision.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The second-quarter results compare with first-quarter
losses of $3.1 billion for 350 sick S&Ls under government
control, the RTC said yesterday. In the last quarter of 1989,
roughly the same number of institutions reported losses of
$6.4 billion.</p>
<p>Federal regulators now have divided the financial
reporting process between the RTC and the Office of Thrift
Supervision, contending that the financial results of sick
thrifts drag down the figures for the rest of the industry.
The 2,500 S&Ls not under government control posted
first-quarter losses of $271 million. They have yet to report
second-quarter results.</p>
<p>The bifurcation is another sign that the thrift cleanup is
a bigger undertaking than Congress or the administration
conceived of a year ago. The RTC was originally envisioned as
a brief stop for thrifts before they were quickly sold. But
some thrifts have been held and managed by the agency for the
entire year.</p>
<p>A substantial portion of the losses, regulators said,
consisted of recognizing prior losses not previously
reflected on the S&Ls' books. Second-quarter losses included
$1.3 billion in asset write-downs, compared with $1.8 billion
in the first quarter.</p>
<p>"To a large degree, these charges result from the RTC's
ongoing efforts to reflect more accurately asset values of
conservatorship institutions," said William Seidman, chairman
of the RTC.</p>
<p>But it is misleading to discuss improvements in the
results of seized thrifts, industry analysts say, as
institutions file in and out of the agency. "These are just
part of the cost of warehousing these institutions until they
can finally be sold off," says Bert Ely, an S&L consultant in
Alexandria, Va. "We won't know the final losses until they
are sold."</p>
