	<p class="article-leader">Argonaut Group Inc. offered to purchase shares of its
common stock from holders with 50 or fewer Argonaut shares as
of yesterday.
   The Los Angeles insurance holding company said that under
terms of the offer, participating shareholders must sell all
their eligible shares. Argonaut said that for each share
owned it will pay holders the highest closing price of
Argonaut common between Aug. 21 and Sept. 25.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Argonaut said it is making the offer mainly to allow
smaller shareholders to sell their shares without being
charged any brokerage commission. A reduction in the number
of small shareholder accounts also would reduce the company's
administrative costs.</p>
<p>Many shareholders received their shares in 1986 when
Teledyne Inc. spun off Argonaut to Teledyne shareholders.
Argonaut said that Shareholder Communications Corp. will
manage the offer, which is set to expire Sept. 25.</p>
