	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Ratings on some $4 billion of debt of
Primerica Corp.'s Commercial Credit Co. subsidiary were
boosted by Standard & Poor's Corp.
   The March acquisition of the consumer-finance receivables
and branch offices of BarclaysAmerican/Financial, a unit of
Barclays Group, "has brought significant opportunities for
cost savings" and improved Commercial Credit's geographic
diversity, the credit-rating company said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Commercial Credit's senior debt rises to single-A from
single-A-minus; the subordinated debt to single-A-minus from
triple-B-plus; and the commercial paper to single-A-1 from
single-A-2.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, S&P boosted ratings on Primerica
Corp.'s Primerica Holdings subsidiary, and in June, Moody's
Investors Service Inc. upgraded about $3 billion of debt of
the two subsidiaries as well as Primerica Holdings' A.L.
Williams unit.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Primerica's shares rose $1.125 to $31.125.</p>
