	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The government forecast robust corn and
wheat production but lagging soybean output, according to the
Agriculture Department's first full-scale crop estimates for
the year.
   The department forecast a 1990 corn harvest of 7.85
billion bushels, up 4% from last year's output and unchanged
from its July estimate. The department said that "excellent
growing conditions" last month offset late Corn Belt
plantings and dry weather in the Southwest.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Soybean production for this year was estimated at 1.84
billion bushels, down 5% from 1989 and 1% below the July
estimate, with soybean plantings off to a late start and
plant development continuing "behind normal," the department
said.</p>
<p>These were the first field-survey forecasts for 1990 corn
and soybean production; previous estimates were based on
incomplete information, according to the department.</p>
<p>The crop estimates, released after the close of futures
trading yesterday, were below those projected by many futures
analysts in recent weeks. With tighter-than-expected supplies
in the offing, soybean futures prices are expected to rise to
10 cents a bushel from five cents in early trading today on
the Chicago Board of Trade, analysts said.</p>
<p>Corn futures prices may jump two to four cents a bushel
today in reaction to the government crop estimates, analysts
said.</p>
<p>The figures released for the country's wheat crop aren't
expected to have as much of a market impact, analysts said.</p>
<p>The corn estimate reflects good growing conditions, which
overcame wet weather earlier this year. Corn yields are
expected to average 117.7 bushels per acre, up 1.5 bushels
from last year but still below the record high of 119.4
bushels an acre in 1987. The department estimated that 1990
production of corn and other feed grains would be the highest
since 1986.</p>
<p>It also forecast a sharp rise in wheat output to 2.71
billion bushels, up 33% from the drought-affected 1989 wheat
crop and slightly above the July estimate. Average yield was
estimated at 38.7 bushels an acre, 5.9 bushels more than in
1989, with output of wheat and other food grains expected to
be the largest since 1982. Winter wheat, the bulk of the
wheat crop, is nearly all harvested.</p>
<p>With wheat stockpiles climbing, the department last week
said it would order a 10% to 20% cutback in 1991 wheat
acreage under the government-subsidized program. Wheat
surpluses fell sharply in recent years because the government
subsidized exports; the stockpiles this year are projected to
rise to 846 million bushels by June 1, 1991, from 535 million
bushels on June 1, 1989.</p>
<p>The National Association of Wheat Growers blamed the
rising stockpiles on a recent decline in exports and the
department's cutback in spending on export subsidies
programs.</p>
<p>Grain growers are expected to get less help from exports
than previously thought, according to a separate Agriculture
Department report released yesterday. The department's
forecast of Soviet Union grain imports for the marketing year
that began July 1 was reduced by six million tons to 30
million tons, the lowest level in four years. The latest
estimate would be down from 38 million tons in the previous
year.</p>
<p>The department's forecast of 1990 Soviet grain production
was boosted by 15 million tons to 230 million tons, with
"bumper yields" cited. Both total Soviet grain production and
the wheat harvest were estimated at the highest levels since
1978, and the coarse-grain harvest was forecast at only
slightly below the 1987 level and two million tons under the
record high 1976 total.</p>
<p>"World and U.S. wheat trade prospects have weakened,
mainly because of improved crops and reduced imports likely
for the Soviet Union and China," the department said.</p>
