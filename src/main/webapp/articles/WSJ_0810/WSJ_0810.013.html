	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Bell Industries Inc. said net income jumped
96% in the fourth quarter ended June 30 on the strength of
higher-margin sales and reduced overhead.
   The industrial products company's net totaled $2.9
million, or 49 cents a share, up from $1.5 million, or 25
cents a share, a year earlier. Sales slipped 2.6% to $102.9
million from $105.7 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Theodore Williams, chairman and president, said the Los
Angeles-based company is "confident that the pattern of
earnings improvement will extend into the new fiscal year."</p>
<p>Bell said operating profit rose sharply in its two largest
business groups, electronics products and business products,
despite lower sales.</p>
<p>However, operating profit declined in Bell's remaining
businesses, graphic arts and motor vehicle parts and
accessories, reflecting costs of restructuring the operations
and a change of facilities.</p>
<p>For the fiscal year, net rose 80% to $8.2 million, or
$1.40 a share, from $4.6 million, or 75 cents a share, in
fiscal 1989. Sales fell 5.4% to $395.8 million from $418.2
million.</p>
