	<p class="article-leader">Merrill Lynch & Co., which has been working on a
restructuring of $1.3 billion of Donald J. Trump's casino
bond debt, is no longer working for the developer, according
to several people close to Mr. Trump.
   Mr. Trump is interviewing other investment houses to work
on the deal, these people said. They said that among the
firms being considered are Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette, Smith
Barney & Co. and First Boston Corp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Meanwhile, people close to the situation said Mr. Trump
has offered the critical position of chief financial officer
of Trump Organization to Stephen F. Bollenbach, who currently
holds that position for Promus Cos. As part of a
restructuring agreement with his banks, Mr. Trump had agreed
to appoint a "senior executive officer" no later than Sept.
30.</p>
<p>Mr. Bollenbach, a highly regarded executive who helped
fend off Mr. Trump's takeover overtures to his company in
1986, declined to comment. Mr. Trump didn't return phone
calls.</p>
<p>It couldn't be learned why Merrill is no longer working on
the bond restructuring. One possible reason suggested by
people close to Mr. Trump was that Merrill was in an awkward
position because it still holds a substantial portion of Mr.
Trump's Taj Mahal casino bonds, and was the underwriter for
that issue in 1988. The Taj Mahal is one of Mr. Trump's
casinos in Atlantic City, N.J.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump is believed to be preparing a restructuring plan
calling for holders of at least some of his bonds to convert
their debt into equity in Mr. Trump's three Atlantic City
casinos. Trump officials believe the casinos aren't making
nearly enough to meet about $200 million in interest and
principal payments due in the next 12 months.</p>
<p>Although Merrill hadn't formally signed a commitment
letter with Mr. Trump, people close to the deal said, the
firm was working under a tentative agreement for about the
past month. About three weeks ago, the Taj bonds were put on
Merrill's "restricted" list of securities that the firm
couldn't trade. That signaled to investors that the firm was
working on a restructuring.</p>
<p>A Merrill spokesman declined to comment.</p>
<p>With Merrill out of the picture, Mr. Trump will have to
act fast. On Nov. 15, he must make a $47 million interest
payment on $675 million in junk bonds issued to buy the Taj
Mahal casino. Informal groups representing holders of Taj
Mahal and Trump Castle bonds have already formed, and have
indicated that they intend to extract heavy concessions from
the developer.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Trump is still working on closing the bank
agreement that would include a $65 million loan and a
suspension of interest payments on more than $800 million in
debt.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the banks and Trump officials continue to work
around the clock, trying to complete the accord. By now,
people close to the agreement said, legal fees have reached
close to $10 million. Mr. Trump will be responsible for
paying those fees, once the bank deal closes.</p>
