	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here
granted a one-week stay of a federal judge's ruling that
would create a Hispanic majority supervisorial district in
Los Angeles, potentially changing the balance of power in the
nation's most populous county.
   Judge David V. Kenyon ruled in June that the county
discriminated against Hispanics when redrawing district
boundaries after the 1980 Census. He ordered the governing
board of supervisors to submit a new plan that would help a
Hispanic win a seat.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Last week, the judge rejected the board's plan and ordered
it to accept a new supervisorial district map devised by
civil-rights groups.</p>
<p>The board, which filed the appeal, applauded the stay. "It
is the first step towards restoring common sense" to the
reapportionment process, said Michael Antonovich, one of
three conservative supervisors on the five-member board who
opposed Judge Kenyon's plan.</p>
<p>The case was originally brought by the Mexican American
Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the U.S. Justice
Department. Although Hispanics represent an estimated 35% of
the county's 8.7 million people, no Hispanic has won a seat
on the board since 1875.</p>
<p>The appeals court agreed to hear oral arguments in the
case on Aug. 16 in San Francisco to decide whether to extend
the stay, which expires the next day. A full hearing was set
for Oct. 1 in Pasadena, Calif.</p>
