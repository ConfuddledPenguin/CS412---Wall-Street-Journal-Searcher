	<p class="article-leader">ROCKFORD, Ill. -- Sundstrand Corp. said insurance
companies agreed to pay $15 million to settle shareholder
litigation against some current and former officers and
directors of the defense contractor, arising out of its 1988
plea of guilty to defense fraud charges.
   The company couldn't immediately say how much of the $15
million it would receive; plaintiffs' lawyers are seeking a
portion, plus expenses, for bringing the so-called
shareholder derivative actions in federal court in Chicago
and state court in Delaware.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sundstrand paid a then record $115 million to settle the
government's procurement fraud charges. Shareholders in turn
sued officers and directors for the damage to the company.</p>
<p>"Sundstrand is extremely pleased that this litigation has
been resolved," Harry C. Stonecipher, president and chief
executive officer, said in a news release. "This development
puts the company's past difficulties squarely behind it."</p>
<p>The settlement, which the officers and directors had to
agree to, didn't call for them to admit any liability, and
they continue to deny having any liability, Sundstrand said.</p>
