	<p class="article-leader">GUATEMALA CITY -- Guatemala has taken center stage over
other Central American stories because of the emergence of
former de facto military dictator Efrain Rios Montt as a
possible candidate in the November presidential elections.
Reporters and analysts seem particularly eager to point to
this phenomenon as proof that Guatemalans have given up on
democracy. Some even assert the racist argument that perhaps
Guatemalans simply aren't capable of handling democracy.
   What these analysts are ignoring is that the policies that
they themselves have advocated (and very often imposed) in
the name of "democracy" have been neither democratic nor
enriching for any except the few local proxies who mouth what
outsiders want to hear. Now that these proxies have been
exposed as inept in all matters save corruption, the people
want to throw them out and turn to the so-called hard-liners
-- not in a military coup, mind you, but in an open election.
And the "civilized" world is aghast.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>When Latin American independence was declared, most of our
territories remained under the influence of the motherland
for several decades. This situation would have been justified
for a short period of time until the right concept of a
republic was found and established in each particular
territory. But it so happened that domination lasted for many
decades with disastrous results.</p>
<p>In these times, foreign hegemony comes from an
unchallenged determination of the First World countries to
impose on Third World nations their own vision of a
democratic system. If we fail to make the passing grade --
that is, if those approved of by the foreign "experts" are
not elected or reelected -- the penalty is applied: media
condemnation followed by isolation.</p>
<p>Local Christian Democrats and Socialists share a statist
vision of governing and are usually the only candidates for
office acceptable to the outsiders. They are financed by
foreign funds sent by political organizations abroad. This
type of financing -- massive by local standards -- has often
overwhelmed other candidates and determined the final result
of elections. The definition of democracy then boils down to
the single act of electing a leader propped up with foreign
funding. Democracy does not become a process by which men
govern, but a license to do whatever the elected want once
they're in office. And in these circumstances, the road to
power is opened to some of the worst elements in our
societies.</p>
<p>Illegal activities -- even including drug trafficking and
related activities -- carried out by those in power have
become an everyday problem here. Unfortunately, most of our
legal institutions do not provide a procedure by which an
elected president can be separated from power through a legal
action, except in the event of mental illness. Officials can
mismanage public funds, act irresponsibly or promote a
chaotic situation for the whole nation, but the citizens are
unable to make them accountable. A "Watergate" is not
possible in a country like Guatemala, though much worse
events have taken place during the administration of
Christian Democrat Vinicio Cerezo.</p>
<p>And all these abuses have taken place at the expense of
the poorest people, in whose interests the "acceptable"
democrats claim to govern. A litany of just some of their
abuses and the consequent results follows:</p>
<p>-- They stress the importance of paying taxes but evade
their own contribution through an additional stipend called
"confidenciales" (confidential expenditures); money that is
granted without having to justify how it was spent. President
Cerezo received last year the amount of 180 million quetzales
from such an account; in 1988 the amount came to 150 million,
though he recently insisted on local television that a
realistic figure was closer to "just" 100 million quetzales
(equal to about $25 million).</p>
<p>-- The foreign minister, aside from his salary,
representation expenses and confidenciales, received $1,000
per diem no matter where he spent his working days.</p>
<p>-- Donations and loans coming from the U.S. government
through the Agency for International Development have been
grossly mishandled. More than $2 million are unacounted for
in funds given by AID, which would have benefited children
severely affected by malnutrition and illnesses.</p>
<p>-- The quetzal has reached a point of devaluation almost
as low as it was before this government took over. It is now
evident that an artificial stabilization had been achieved
through the assistance provided by the U.S. and some European
governments that support the Christian Democrats in Central
America. Even then, all the external aid and financing have
not been enough to cover up this government's excessive
spending habits. One dollar was worth 3.78 quetzales last
October. Now the value has gone down to 4.35 and is still on
its way down, even though the amount of dollars in
circulation is at its peak this time of the year when payment
of our most important export goods takes place.</p>
<p>-- The fiscal deficit increased three times from 1985 to
1988, and by 1990 it became the highest in the history of the
country. Per-capita income has dropped in real terms to its
1969 level. According to statistics supplied by Asazgua, the
private association of sugar planters, the price of basic
products consumed by Guatemalans -- black beans, corn and
rice -- has increased more than 500% from 1985 to 1990. That
means most of the population is far poorer that it was
throughout all the years when the government was controlled
by the authoritarian groups that took power by force.</p>
<p>-- State hospitals, roads and public schools are in ruins
due to the fact that no money has been spent on their
maintenance. Paper is used instead of bandages to wipe away
blood during surgery. People die because they lack the
necessary funds to pay for high-priced medicines, which are
no longer supplied by the government.</p>
<p>Of course we do have a new class of millionaires -- those
part-time socialists and part-time capitalists who are
pampered by foreign countries no matter what they do and no
matter how destructive they are so long as they talk pretty
and uphold the principle of democracy -- that is, an
election.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the voters with their simple rationale think
that the solution will come from an authoritarian president,
who this time might be elected through a democratic process.
They hope that this new president will be given the chance to
work things out with as much international support as the
populist demagogues who have governed the country the past
four and a half years. Can anyone except the most
reality-blind ideologue really blame them?</p>
