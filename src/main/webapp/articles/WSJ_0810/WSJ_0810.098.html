	<p class="article-leader">Environmentalists are hoping for a silver lining in the
cloud over the Middle East -- renewed support for the
alternative -- energy options that fell on hard times in the
1980s.
   But efforts to reduce U.S. reliance on foreign oil in the
1990s will probably involve a different mix of programs than
were instigated after the 1970s oil shock. In particular,
growing concerns about air pollution make some ideas pursued
in the 1970s unattractive, such as making petroleum
"synfuels" from coal or oil-containing shale,
environmentalists said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I'm sure a lot of crazy ideas are going to come out of
the woodwork now" to cut dependence on foreign oil, said
James MacKenzie, an energy expert at the World Resources
Institute, a Washington, D.C., think tank. "Making synfuels
from oil shale, for example, would double the amount of
carbon dioxide produced per mile" of automobile travel,
possibly worsening the greenhouse effect that scientists fear
is causing global warming.</p>
<p>Conservation is the fastest, cheapest way to lower U.S.
dependence on foreign oil, say energy experts. But U.S.
prices for gasoline -- even after recent rises from the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait -- probably remain too low to motivate
much conserving, they add. By comparison, European consumers
typically pay two to three times as much for gasoline as U.S.
consumers do, and, on average, use two to three times less
gasoline per capita than Americans do.</p>
<p>"Much of our national security problem right now is driven
by artificially low fuel prices," said Mr. MacKenzie. "In
constant dollars, they've never been lower" than they were
before the Iraqi invasion. Meanwhile, the average fuel
efficiency of new automobiles sold in the U.S. has fallen 4%
in the past two years, he added.</p>
<p>However, major cuts in imported petroleum probably can't
be achieved simply by making U.S. cars more fuel efficient,
energy researchers said. They noted that growth in vehicle
miles traveled in the U.S. has largely overwhelmed increased
automobile fuel efficiency achieved since the 1970s oil
crisis.</p>
<p>In 1988, there were 51 million more cars in the U.S. being
driven 450 billion more miles than in 1970, according to
Worldwatch Institute, which studies environmental issues in
Washington, D.C. Contributors to the trend include expanding
suburbs, more two- and three-car families and little economic
incentive to conserve fuel.</p>
<p>Thus, energy experts say alternative fuels will be needed
to do much about imported oil. One option is ethanol, derived
from corn, which now comprises about 1% of U.S. automobile
fuel in the form of gasohol. But using grain for ethanol
"hasn't been economically viable without government
subsidies," said Christopher Flaven, a Worldwatch Institute
energy expert. Moreover, the U.S. currently has little unused
ethanol-making capacity to tap, said Mark DeLuchi, an energy
and environmental researcher at the University of California
at Davis. But making ethanol from non-corn raw materials --
various "woody" plants -- might replace significant amounts
of oil in the future, he added.</p>
<p>Another kind of alcohol, methanol, also can be used for
fuel. But U.S. supplies of it are mainly imported and are
derived from natural gas, whose prices are tied to oil
markets. Methanol can be made from coal, noted Mr. DeLuchi,
but the process is expensive and produces more air pollution
than the processes for making other alternative fuels.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best near-term alternative fuel, said Mr.
Flavin, is natural gas. "It would require a substantial
investment, but the technology is available to do it," he
added. Hundreds of thousands of natural-gas vehicles already
are on the road in Europe. Last month, General Motors Corp.
announced plans to produce 1,000 natural-gas powered trucks
as part of a joint project with a group of utilities and the
Texas General Land Office.</p>
<p>In the longer term, electric cars and hydrogen-fueled
automobiles could drastically cut oil use -- and greatly
lessen air pollution, said energy researchers. Practical
electric cars priced in the $20,000 range should be available
within five years or so, said Michael Vail, a spokesman for
Aerovironment Inc., a Monrovia, Calif., concern that designed
a prototype electric car unveiled this spring by General
Motors. "The technology is there, but it will take time to
make it affordable," he added. Still, Los Angeles is planning
to have 10,000 electric vehicles in operation by 1995.</p>
<p>Practical hydrogen-fueled cars are generally considered to
be at least a decade away. But such vehicles could employ
hydrogen derived from water in reactions driven by solar
power, making them perhaps the least-polluting alternative.
West Germany is the world leader in developing the technology
and has developed a prototype system for using it that is
expected to begin operating this fall, said Peter Hoffmann,
editor of The Hydrogen Letter, a Hyattsville, Md., newsletter
about hydrogen-based technology. Moreover, West Germany and
the Soviet Union recently signed an agreement to jointly
study using liquid hydrogen to power airplanes, he added.</p>
