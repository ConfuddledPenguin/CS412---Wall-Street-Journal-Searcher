	<p class="article-leader">Del Webb Corp., a Phoenix, Ariz.-based real estate
development concern, said that it terminated its shareholder
rights plan and that all rights outstanding expired
yesterday.
   A Del Webb spokesman said the move came in response to
shareholder approval at the annual meeting in May of a
nonbinding resolution to drop the anti-takeover plan. The
resolution was proposed by Webcott Holdings, a California
partnership, controlled by James J. Cotter, that holds a
large stake in Del Webb.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In April, Del Webb agreed to several of Mr. Cotter's
demands to avert a proxy fight at the annual meeting. Del
Webb agreed to expand the board by two members and renominate
four of 10 directors, including Mr. Cotter, whose terms were
set to expire. Mr. Cotter is also chairman of Craig Corp., a
Los Angeles supermarket chain and photographic accessories
concern.</p>
