	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- The California department of insurance
said the state's Supreme Court denied an appeal that could
have blocked the department from seeking recovery of $1.5
billion in damages from reinsurers of Mission Insurance Co.
   Los Angeles-based Mission, which, with its units, has been
in liquidation by California regulators since February 1987,
is claiming the money as a principal asset in the vast
insolvency.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The California insurance department will pursue its claim
for the $1.5 billion at a trial scheduled to begin Nov. 1.</p>
<p>Underwriters Reinsurance Co., one of Mission's reinsurers,
has led a challenge to a lower court ruling that regulators
are entitled in litigation to seek not only actual current
claims but also an amount equalling projected future claims.
Reinsurers objected to regulators' demands for the far larger
future claims on the ground that their calculation is too
uncertain. Underwriters, Woodland Hills, Calif., is a unit of
Underwriters ReCorp.</p>
<p>The apparent exhaustion of appeals for reinsurers may
accelerate settlements between the companies -- which insure
insurance companies -- and state regulators in the Mission
case. To date, regulators have recovered more than $300
million through settlements with Mission's reinsurers.</p>
