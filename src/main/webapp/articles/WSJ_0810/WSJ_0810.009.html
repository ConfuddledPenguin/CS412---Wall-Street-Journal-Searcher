	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- A dissident shareholder of Agnico-Eagle Mines
Ltd., who had planned to seek a buyer for the company, said
he has sold his remaining 2% interest in the gold-mining
concern.
   Montreal businessman Jacques Forget said he sold his
Agnico shares because he doesn't expect the company will
reach its targeted level of production this year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But Agnico spokesman Sean Boyd said the company expects to
produce in 1990 between 5,000 and 10,000 ounces more than the
160,000 ounces the company had targeted. Last year, Agnico's
production amounted to 157,000 ounces.</p>
<p>Mr. Forget couldn't be reached for further comment. In a
statement, he didn't disclose the terms of the sale of the
Agnico shares nor did he identify the buyer.</p>
<p>As previously reported, Mr. Forget said earlier that he
intended to seek a change of control at Agnico because of
what he called "numerous errors in management." He gave no
indication in his statement of whether he still plans to
pursue a change in management and control.</p>
<p>On the Toronto Stock Exchange, Agnico shares closed
yesterday at 8.13 Canadian dollars (US$7.09), up 25 Canadian
cents. At last report, Agnico had 27.4 million shares
outstanding.</p>
