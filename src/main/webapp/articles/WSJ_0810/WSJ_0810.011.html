	<p class="article-leader">Royal Dutch/Shell Group and British Petroleum Co. reported
plunging profits for the second quarter, but the recent surge
in oil prices is expected to help the companies rebound in
the rest of the year.
   Both companies were cautious in predicting what Iraq's
aggression in the Persian Gulf would mean for oil prices. At
a news conference, BP's chairman, Robert Horton, said he
expected oil prices to remain "on the north side" of $20 to
$22 a barrel over the next six months.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>North Sea oil prices were quoted yesterday at around $25 a
barrel, up from an average of $16 in the second quarter.</p>
<p>BP said it didn't expect the Persian Gulf situation to
create an immediate oil-supply crisis. The company estimated
that increased output by other countries would make up for
half the four million barrels a day lost from Iraq and
Kuwait.</p>
<p>Shell said the outlook for its results this year "is
obviously extremely uncertain and almost entirely dependent
on how events in the Middle East unfold."</p>
<p>Royal Dutch/Shell's net income fell 43% to $940 million
from $1.64 billion a year earlier. On a current-cost basis,
which strips out inventory gains or losses and is similar to
the accounting system used by U.S. oil companies, net fell
16% to $1.24 billion from $1.49 billion.</p>
<p>Sales grew 6% to $27.86 billion from $26.17 billion.</p>
<p>In the first half, net fell 41% to $2.3 billion from $3.88
billion a year earlier. On a current-cost basis, net fell 23%
to $2.62 billion from $3.42 billion. Sales climbed 11% to
$56.99 billion from $51.2 billion.</p>
<p>BP's net plummeted 94% to $74 million from $1.22 billion.
The quarter included an extraordinary loss of $18 million,
compared with a gain of $451 million a year earlier.
Current-cost net slid to $478 million from $604 million.
Sales rose to $12.2 billion from $12.01 billion.</p>
<p>In the first half, BP's net fell to $706 million from
$2.29 billion. That included extraordinary gains of $43
million in the latest half and $451 million a year before.
Current-cost profit declined to $1.08 billion from $1.27
billion. Sales grew to $25.54 billion from $23.45 billion.</p>
<p>Both companies were hurt by lower oil prices and reduced
profit margins on petrochemicals. Shell's results were
roughly in line with expectations, but BP's figures were well
below forecasts.</p>
<p>Stockbrokers said the market paid little attention to the
figures, focusing instead on action in the Persian Gulf and
its effect on oil prices. "That's really rendered everything
else superfluous," said John Toalster, an analyst at Hoare
Govett in London.</p>
<p>In the second quarter, Shell's production of crude oil
grew 11% to 1.9 million barrels a day, but that was offset by
the drop in prices. The average price of North Sea Brent
crude was down 15% from a year earlier to $16.05 a barrel.</p>
<p>Operating profit from chemicals slumped to $257 million
from $435 million, reflecting a general drop in prices after
a boom in the late 1980s. Shell said that the "downward trend
in margins appears to have stabilized" but that the company
remains cautious on the outlook for chemicals.</p>
<p>BP's operating profit from chemicals dropped to $65
million from $305 million a year before. The company said the
yearearlier results were exceptionally good and that plant
maintenance hurt performance in the latest quarter.</p>
