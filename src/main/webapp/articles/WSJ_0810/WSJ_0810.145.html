	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- After shunning the first two segments of the
Treasury's $32.25 billion quarterly securities auction,
investors were lured to the final segment of the auction by
the highest yields in more than a year.
   The Treasury auctioned $10.26 billion of 30-year bonds
yesterday as it completed its three-part refunding of the
federal debt. The 30-year bonds had an average yield of
8.87%, the highest yield for a benchmark bond since May 1989
when the average yield was 9.11%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In when-issued trading, the yield slipped to 8.75%, a sign
that the 30-year bonds were selling briskly and at hefty
premiums in the secondary market.</p>
<p>Cheered by the successful completion of the quarterly
refunding, the bond market rallied. The old benchmark 30-year
bond ended about 3/4 point higher, a gain of about $7.50 for
a bond with a $1,000 face amount.</p>
<p>William Brachfeld, manager of trading in the New York
office of Japan's Daiwa Securities America Inc., said that
investors pushed aside worries about Mideast turmoil and
rising oil prices and purchased bonds in an apparent bet that
interest rates will soon head lower.</p>
<p>The auction went smoothly despite scant interest on the
part of Japanese investors, who have purchased anywhere from
25% to 50% of the 30-year bonds sold at previous auctions.
Mr. Brachfeld estimates that long-term Japanese investment
accounts may have purchased between 5% and 10% of the 30-year
bond at yesterday's auction.</p>
<p>"The demand from Japan continues to be quite small," said
Mr. Brachfeld. "This was not a Japanese auction, this was a
domestic auction." Japanese investors have been reducing
their purchases of U.S. securities for most of the year,
primarily because they view securities in their own market as
equally or more attractive than U.S. securities.</p>
<p>The auction results were a surprise to some market
participants, many of whom had predicted that the 30-year
bond auction would be by far the weakest of the Treasury's
three auctions. As it turns out, the 30-year was the
strongest.</p>
<p>The quarterly auction kicked off Tuesday with the sale of
$11.5 billion of three-year notes and continued on Wednesday
with the sale of $10.5 billion of ten-year notes. The first
sale was considered lackluster and the second sale was viewed
as a disaster, although demand for the notes picked up in the
secondary market late Wednesday as prices fell and yields
rose to levels considered attractive.</p>
<p>Stephen G. Thieke, manager of the government trading desk
at J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., said that political news
developments and rumors of developments disrupted the two
early auctions and made it difficult for dealers to assess
investor interest. (Any institution or individual can bid on
bonds at a Treasury auction, although most of the bonds are
acquired by Wall Street brokerage firms and large commercial
banks. Individuals usually buy securities through so-called
noncompetitive tenders.)</p>
<p>But after the market fell sharply after Wednesday's
auction, investors suddenly materialized. At that point, "you
saw a greater sense of confidence on the part of the dealer
community about where yields had to be to attract investors
in this climate," said Mr. Thieke.</p>
<p>In addition to the price gain of the old benchmark 30-year
bond, other aspects of the sale also confirmed that the
auction went smoothly. The bid-to-cover ratio -- a measure of
the amount of bids received compared with the amount of
securities sold -- was 2.53, reflecting a healthy interest in
the new bonds.</p>
<p>The Treasury received bids totaling $25.96 billion,
including $505 million of noncompetitive tenders at the
average yield, up from $463 million of noncompetitive bids
accepted at the previous 30-year bond auction on May 10.</p>
<p>Now that the record $32.25 billion quarterly refunding
obstacle has been hurdled, the focus of the Treasury market,
likely will return to economic fundamentals, analysts say.</p>
<p>The crisis in the Mideast and its effects on world-wide
oil prices and inflation will remain at center stage, but
slumping real estate and stock prices, rising unemployment
and tightening credit conditions also will be a focus of
concern, analysts say.</p>
<p>The outlook for Friday is cautious. Analysts say that
while the optimism that swept through the market late
Thursday may carry over through the night, the market will
remain captive to any new events surrounding the conflict
with Iraq.</p>
<p>The producer price index for July is scheduled for release
this morning at 8:30 a.m. EDT. The report is expected to show
a 0.1% rise in producer prices, up 0.2% if the volatile food
and energy components are excluded, according to a Dow Jones
Capital Markets Report survey of economists.

<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>Treasurys rallied after the government completed its
$32.25 billion quarterly refunding of the federal debt.</p>
<p>The old benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price
of 99 26/32, up from 99 3/32 on Wednesday. The issue's yield,
which moves in the opposite direction of its price, eased to
8.75% from 8.82% on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The new ten-year notes ended at a price of 100 26/32 to
yield 8.64%, down from Wednesday's average auction yield of
8.77%. New three-year notes were quoted at a price of 99
22/32 to yield 8.10%, the same as the average yield set at
Tuesday's auction.</p>
<p>In addition to 30-year bonds, the Treasury sold $10
billion of 36-day cash management bills yesterday.</p>
<p>Here are details of yesterday's cash management bill
auction and the 30-year bond auction:</p>

<p>Corporate, Junk Bonds</p>
<p>A strong performance by the stock market helped boost
confidence in the junk-bond market, driving prices of
better-quality speculative-grade issues higher.</p>
<p>Overall, prices of blue chip high-yield names ended the
session about 1/4 point higher. Investment-grade corporate
bonds also advanced with long-term corporate bonds flagging
gains of about 5/8 point.</p>
<p>The junk bonds of Texas Air Corp., now Continental
Airlines Holdings Inc., skyrocketed on news that Frank
Lorenzo, chairman and chief executive, will step down and
will sell most of his direct and indirect investment in
Continental to Scandinavian Airlines System.</p>
<p>Texas Air's 15.75% senior notes, maturing in 1992, shot up
about eight points in over-the-counter trading to end at a
bid price of 89. Eastern Airlines, a unit of the airline
company, saw the fortunes of its preferred stock rise.</p>
<p>Eastern Airlines' Series D preferred stock rose 3 1/8
points, or 31.6%, to close at 13 in over-the-counter
composite volume of 193,500 shares. Average daily volume in
the issue is about 17,900 shares. The issue was as high as 14
1/2 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some recently-depressed junk-bond issues like
R.H. Macy & Co. and Trump Plaza Funding Corp. continued to
show signs of strain, and lost between 1/2 and 1 point.</p>
<p>In the new-issue market for investment-grade corporate
debt, about $450 million in new securities were priced
Thursday, including a $250 million floating-rate note
offering by the Student Loan Marketing Association.</p>
<p>Municipal Bonds</p>
<p>Reacting to the stronger-than-expected demand seen at the
Treasury's 30-year bond auction, municipal issues ended
steady to 1/2 point higher, with some issues posting gains of
3/4 point.</p>
<p>Among actively traded secondary issues, the New Jersey
Turnpike Authority's 7.20% of 2018 were up 1/2 point at 98
1/2 to yield 7.32%.</p>
<p>Despite the market's gains, participants remain cautious
due to the volatile situation in the Middle East.</p>
<p>No large new municipal issues are expected to be priced
today.</p>
<p>Mortgage-, Asset-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Mortgage securities ended as much as 3/4 point higher in a
rally that followed the Treasury's 30-bond auction.</p>
<p>In the primary market, a $300 million Federal National
Mortgage Association real estate mortgage investment conduit
issue backed by 10% Fannie Mae 30-year securities was offered
by Lehman Brothers.</p>
<p>Also, there was a $300 million issue of Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp. Remics backed by Freddie Mac 9.5% 30-year
securities offered through Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette
Securities Corp.</p>
<p>There was also a $500 million Freddie Mac Remic backed by
Freddie Mac 9% 30-year securities offered through Morgan
Stanley & Co.</p>
<p>In the secondary market, Government National Mortgage
Association 9.5% issues were up 5/8 point at 99 1/32, Freddie
Mac 9.5% issues were 15/32 higher at 98 21/32 and Fannie Mae
9.5% issues were 15/32 stronger at 99 6/32.</p>
<p>In the asset-backed sector, there was a two-part Chrysler
Financial Corp. offering totaling around $215 million.</p>
<p>One of those was a $139 million Grantor Trust issue backed
by marine receivables.</p>
<p>The other was a $75 million Grantor Trust issue backed by
recreational-vehicles receivables.</p>
<p>Both issues are offered through Chemical Securities Inc.,
a unit of Chemical Banking Corp. Both issues had a coupon
rate of 8.90% and were priced at 99 41/64 to yield 9.072%.</p>
<p>The originator and servicer of the underlying loans in
both trusts is Chrysler First Inc. Both Chrysler First Inc.
and Chrysler Financial Corp. are units of Chrysler Corp.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>The Japanese government-bond market ended softer yesterday
in its first subdued trading session in a week.</p>
<p>Participants in the financial markets say they have grown
more accustomed to the tension in the Middle East, so that
dealings were less vulnerable to rumors about the stand-off
between Iraq and now the U.S.</p>
<p>At the 3 p.m. JST close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the
price of Japan's benchmark No. 119 10-year bond was 83.44,
down 0.47 point. The yield was 7.99%. (When calculated using
the semi-annual compound method, the closing yield on the No.
119 bond was 7.37%, according to Salomon Brothers Inc.)</p>
<p>Elsewhere:</p>
<p>-- West German bonds ended 0.35 point firmer in light
trading. The bulk of the day's gains came on overnight
short-covering, dealers said.</p>
<p>-- British government bonds, called gilts, ending firmer
as the high yields on the securities have begun to attract
investors. Britain's benchmark 11.75% bond due 2003/2007 was
quoted late at 99 17/32, up 19/32 from late Wednesday to
yield 11.80%.</p>
