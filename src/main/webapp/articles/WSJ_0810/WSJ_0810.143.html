	<p class="article-leader">Immunex Corp. said the Food and Drug Administration
approved an investigational new drug application for
Interleukin-1 (IL-1), which researchers believe may serve as
a treatment for myelosuppression, a blood-cell disease linked
with radiation or chemotherapy for cancer treatments.
   The next phase of tests, scheduled for next month, will
determine the drug's safety and its effect on blood-cell
growth in stubborn refractory cancers that don't respond to
current treatment methods.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Syntex Corp., a Palo Alto, Calif., pharmaceutical concern,
holds the world-wide marketing rights for IL-1, and Immunex
manufactures the product. Immunex of Seattle is involved in
the research, development, marketing and manufacturing of
immunological therapeutic products.</p>
