	<p class="article-leader">Sierra Pacific Resources said market uncertainty has
caused it to cancel the development of the Thousand Springs
electric generation project resulting in a $35 million charge
on the utility's 1990 earnings. The Reno, Nev., utility
holding company posted earnings of $44.9 million, or $2.05 a
share, in 1989.
   Although several purchase proposals were submitted by
potential energy buyers, the company said it was unable to
obtain long-term purchase agreements necessary to sustain the
project, planned for construction in Elko, Nev.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sierra Pacific was the project manager and largest
participant in this independent power project. In the past
few weeks, four companies, Bonneville Pacific Corp.; Foster
Wheeler Energy Corp.; The Pittsburgh & Midway Coal Mining
Co.; and Westinghouse Electric Corp. have withdrawn from the
project, company officials said.</p>
