	<p class="article-leader">RELOCATION. It can be the best deal you'll ever make. Or
the worst. It all depends on where you're coming from -- and
where you're heading.
   Of course, relocation assistance is supposed to make
everything equal. Most packages cover such things as
house-hunting trips, home-sale assistance and closing costs
on a new home. More employers also provide temporary salary
supplements to employees moving to high-cost areas.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But, as the 500,000 employees relocated annually know,
there are good moves and there are bad moves.</p>
<p>Here are some of them. Compiled with the assistance of PHH
Destination Services, a company that assists relocating
families, the moves assume that the relocated executive and
spouse live, with two children, in a four-bedroom home in an
upper-middle-class neighborhood. The goal is to buy a similar
house in a similar neighborhood. The couple have a 30% equity
stake in their current home and plan to put 28.5% down on
their new house.</p>
<p>Dallas to San Francisco</p>
<p>Stay home. The couple, selling their house for $237,500 in
a Dallas suburb, better brace themselves: In San Mateo,
Calif., the same-size house, with one-fourth the land, costs
double the money, $500,000. Since there's little need to run
the air conditioning 24 hours a day, the cost of utilities
decreases about $100 a month. But just about everything else
goes up. Monthly mortgage payments rise 128%, or $2,127;
insurance, 111%; and property taxes, 28%. Overall, total
monthly expenses increase about 80%, or $2,323. The
alternative: squeeze into a two-bedroom condo and pay only
about $289 a month more than in Dallas.</p>
<p>Cleveland to Honolulu</p>
<p>A big loser. The couple sell their traditional two-story
house, with a basement, in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, for
$150,000 -- and buy a one-story Honolulu house for $500,000.
Mortgage payments jump almost $3,000 per month, and insurance
costs increase an additional $100. Good news, though:
Groceries decrease by $31 per month. And again, expenses can
be kept about equal by buying a two-bedroom condominium with
1 1/2 bathrooms.</p>
<p>Oklahoma City to New York City</p>
<p>Another loser. The home being sold in Edmond, Okla., is
valued at $105,000. A comparable home in the New York suburb
of Katonah will cost $315,000. Real-estate taxes escalate
400%, or $3,900, and the monthly grocery bill rises $60.
Commuting time, to downtown New York, doubles to one hour and
costs $150. Overall, monthly expenses rise 170%, or $2,411.
If the couple want to keep to their Oklahoma City budget,
forget it: They couldn't even afford a one-bedroom condo.</p>
<p>Boston to Seattle</p>
<p>Not a bad move. A four-bedroom house in Braintree, 20
minutes outside of Boston, will fetch $245,000. A similar
house in Lake Stevens, Wash., can be had for $192,500.
Monthly expenses drop $850. If they are willing to shell out
that $850, they can get an extra bedroom or buy lake-front
property.</p>
<p>Fairfax, Va., to Atlanta</p>
<p>You can't miss on this one. A house in Lithonia, an
Atlanta suburb, would be priced at about $250,000 less than
the same house in Fairfax, Va. -- $105,500 vs. $365,000. If
the family insists on spending that $365,000 in Lithonia, it
could buy a five-bedroom mansion with a pool and Jacuzzi --
on two acres in a prestigious area.</p>
<p>Los Angeles to Detroit</p>
<p>The selling price in Cypress, Calif., is $412,500 compared
with $400,000 in Bloomfield Hills, Mich. But the prices are
misleading: Bloomfield Hills has more prestige. And the
typical lot is 1 1/2 acres -- about 13 times larger than the
typical Cypress lot. Heating bills double the cost of
utilities in Bloomfield Hills; other expenses are about
equal.</p>
<p>Hartford to Chicago</p>
<p>Don't expect much of a loss or a windfall from a West
Hartford, Conn., to Naperville, Ill., move. Although the home
price is almost 10% lower in Naperville ($237,375 vs.
$262,500), real-estate taxes increase 25% to $3,732. All
other expenses are about equal or slightly lower in
Naperville.</p>
