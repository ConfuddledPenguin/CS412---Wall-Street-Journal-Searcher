	<p class="article-leader">MILAN, Ill. -- Eagle Food Centers Inc. will report
virtually flat sales for its second quarter ended Aug. 4.
Pasquale V. Petitti, the grocery-store company's chairman,
blamed both competition and delays in the concern's plans to
construct new stores.
   He declined to estimate whether earnings were off, saying
the company hasn't yet totaled up expenses. Sales rose less
than 1% to $282.5 million. In comparison, first-quarter
profit rose about 5% to $2.7 million, or 24 cents a share, on
sales growth of 3% to $281.6 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the year ending Feb. 2, 1991, Mr. Petitti said he
hopes the company will post earnings that "equal or exceed"
last year's $10.5 million, or 92 cents a share, on sales of
$1.1 billion.</p>
<p>Eagle's stock price has dropped 50% since the company went
public about a year ago at an initial offering price of $20.
The company's shares are trading over-the-counter. Mr.
Petitti said the price may have fallen because of delays in
construction of Eagle's new stores.</p>
<p>At the time the company went public, it expected that two
stores in Roselle and Normal, Ill., would be operating by
last spring, he said. In addition, it once hoped to have
another four stores open this year. However, unexpected
troubles arose over zoning and construction issues in Roselle
and Normal. The company didn't break ground for those stores
until spring and they won't be open until this fall. The
other four were also delayed, though one should be open next
spring.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company, which runs 106 stores in the
Midwest, has faced competition from new stores put up by its
rivals. Last year, about 20 competing stores opened in its
marketplace. This year another 18 will go up, the company
said.</p>
<p>Still, the company intends to fight back by getting on
schedule with its store expansion plans, Mr. Petitti said. It
plans to open at least four stores next year, relocate six,
and remodel another six.</p>
<p>The company's efforts to boost sales also include plans to
distribute coupon books in 20 of its individual markets. The
coupons will be specially targeted for the demographics of
each store. For instance, in professional, suburban
neighborhoods, frozen items and flavored waters will be
promoted. In rural areas, the basics, such as baking
ingredients and peanut butter, will be emphasized.</p>
