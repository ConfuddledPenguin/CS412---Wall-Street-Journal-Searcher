	<p class="article-leader">Schering-Plough Corp. said it withdrew a new blood
pressure drug from world-wide distribution after 17 patients
using the medication developed liver complications.
   The drug, known generically as dilevalol hydrochloride,
was sold only in Japan and Portugal. In January, an advisory
panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had
recommended approval for marketing in the U.S., but the FDA
itself hadn't yet acted on the recommendation.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Schering previously projected annual sales for dilevalol
at up to $200 million, a company spokesman said. In composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Schering
closed at $47 a share, up 50 cents. The company's
announcement came after the close of trading.</p>
<p>"It certainly isn't positive" for the company, said Marc
Mayer, a drug industry analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &
Co. "But I don't see it as a major hit."</p>
<p>The company said sales of the drug in Portugal and Japan
totaled $20 million since it was introduced in both countries
last winter. Withdrawing the drug won't have a material
impact on 1990 earnings, the company added, which are still
expected to increase by 18% to 20% over 1989 levels.</p>
<p>Schering, based in Madison, N.J., said more than 175,000
patients have used the drug, including 36,000 in clinical
trials. Of the 17 cases of liver damage, 16 patients returned
to normal after they stopped taking the drug. The 17th
patient died, although Schering said the company wasn't
certain that the drug itself caused the death, which occurred
in Japan.</p>
<p>"Although the actual number of hepatotoxicity cases was
quite small in relation to the number of patients using
dilevalol, our decision was taken in the best interest of the
potential patient population for the drug," said Alexander Z.
Lane, president, Schering-Plough Research.</p>
<p>The company said it was aware of only three cases of liver
damage when the FDA advisory panel reviewed Schering's
clinical data. The remaining cases surfaced more recently.</p>
<p>Dilevalol is classified as a beta blocker, which helps
control blood pressure by blocking nerve impulses that
regulate the heart beat.</p>
