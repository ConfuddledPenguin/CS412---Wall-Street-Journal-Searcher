	<p class="article-leader">GOLDEN, Colo. -- Adolph Coors Co.'s non-beer businesses
reported operating profit of about $10 million in the second
quarter, compared with about $2 million in the year earlier
period, marking the first time the non-beer operations
contributed significantly to the company's bottom line, Coors
chief financial officer, Harold Smethills, said.
   "These businesses are coming into their own," Mr.
Smethills said. Coors began its diversification in 1910, when
it bought a small ceramics company here. The brewer started
to develop additional businesses during the past decade,
including the manufacturing of ceramic parts for electronics,
aluminum processing, and packaging and biotechnology
businesses. The company began reporting its non-beer
operating profit by segments in the first quarter of 1990.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the second quarter, the company reported operating
profit of about $4.7 million for its ceramics business
compared with about $2 million in the year-ago second
quarter. The second quarter profit more than made up for a
first-quarter loss in that business, which was due to a $7
million write-down for work force adjustments, resulting in
$200,000 in operating profit for the first half of the year.
Aluminum manufacturing, which includes the production of
aluminum sheets for can lids and tabs for both Coors and
other can users, reported operating profit for the second
quarter of about $5 million compared with less than $1
million a year ago.</p>
<p>The company's other businesses, which include Graphics
Packaging Corp., a biotechnology company, an energy company
and a small business incubator, reported operating profit of
about $200,000 for the quarter, compared with a loss of about
$900,000 in the year-ago quarter. The segment's performance
was led by the packaging business, which had "much stronger
sales, lower costs and more efficient operations" compared
with the year-ago second quarter, Mr. Smethills said.</p>
<p>The company's biotechnology division, which is just
starting to market some commercial nutritional ingredients,
reported a loss, but the losses were substantially smaller
than before, Mr. Smethills said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company's flagship beer business reported
increased beer shipments of 14% and an increase in operating
profit of about 25%. The improvements were due to a
comparison with a poor second quarter in 1989 and due to
increased shipments of Coors Light. In addition, the company
introduced Keystone, its popular-priced beer, in the third
quarter of 1989, significantly boosting beer sales.</p>
<p>"Our diversification strategy that we've been talking
about for about 10 years is starting to provide a return to
our shareholders," said Mr. Smethills. Currently about 38% of
Coors' $1.6 billion in assets is held by its non-beer
businesses. "The overall return on equity isn't where we want
it yet," he said, "but we're making progress." Coors has
stated that it wants to make a 10% return in each of its
businesses.</p>
<p>Earlier, Coors reported second-quarter earnings of $25.1
million on sales of $475.3 million, compared with
year-earlier profit of $16.8 million on sales of $425.5
million.</p>
