	<p class="article-leader">NARCOTICS IN JAPAN</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Japan's affluence has made it a target for international
narcotics cartels, and it must act fast to escape the
drug-inflicted maladies of other wealthy societies, a United
Nations official said.</p>
<p>"Japan needs immediate action, or its economy could be
easily destroyed by drug-trafficking," Giuseppe di Gennaro,
executive director of the U.N. Fund for Drug Abuse Control,
said in Tokyo. The amount of intercepted cocaine smuggled
into Japan in the first six months of 1990 was 137 pounds, up
from only three pounds in the same period in 1989, Japanese
police said.</p>
<p>"The fact that such a large quantity of drugs was seized
in this country is evidence that there are already
well-constructed distribution networks here," Mr. di Gennaro
said.</p>
<p>Illegal drug use is still rare in Japan, and penalties are
severe. Sentences of life imprisonment are possible for
cocaine and heroin trafficking.</p>
<p>BRAZIL'S ANTI-SMOKING CAMPAIGN</p>
<p>Brazil's Health Ministry said smoking would be prohibited
on domestic airline flights of two hours or less. The new
rule will take effect after a public-education campaign by
the airlines and the Department of Civilian Aviation, the
ministry said. It said it also was considering creating
special shuttle flights for smokers. Three months ago, the
government approved a package of anti-smoking measures
including a ban on cigarette sales to minors and prohibition
of cigarette ads on television between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m.</p>
<p>NO INTER-KOREAN TRAVEL
</p>
<p>North Korea effectively rejected a South Korean proposal
to open the Korean border to unrestricted travel for five
days next week. By repeating its longstanding demand for the
repeal of Seoul's anti-communist national security laws, the
North appeared to have squelched any last-minute chance to
set in motion the procedures to allow inter-Korean exchanges.
The North also imposed two other conditions unlikely to be
met by South Korea: that the South allow a North Korean
"consolation" team to visit jailed dissidents in the South
and that it permit South Korean dissidents to attend a
unification rally at the border on Aug. 15.</p>
<p>CORRUPTION IN CHINA</p>
<p>China disciplined 17,000 government officials in the first
half of this year for corruption and other illegal
activities, an official report said. One-third of the 23,645
cases of official wrongdoing filed from January through June
involved bribery and embezzlement. Other cases involved
"violation of economic policies," profiteering, abuse of
power for personal gain and dereliction of duty, the Xinhua
news agency reported. Most of those punished were local
officials, the report said.</p>
<p>MERCEDES-BENZES FOR TOKYO</p>
<p>Nissho Iwai Corp., a Japanese trading house, will set up a
wholly owned subsidiary within a month to sell Mercedes-Benz
automobiles in the Tokyo area, a company spokesman said. The
announcement reflected a move by Mercedes-Benz Japan to
expand the network of dealerships selling its models imported
from the West German parent company, Mercedes-Benz AG. The
new subsidiary will have a showroom and a service shop in
central Tokyo.</p>
<p>VIETNAMESE BAN</p>
<p>Vietnam is banning cigarette imports because they drain
foreign exchange and hurt the local industry, the official
Vietnam News Agency reported. The order bans the import,
circulation and consumption of foreign-made cigarettes
starting Oct. 1, the agency said. The report said diplomats,
foreign businessmen and officials of international
organizations were exempt from the ban but must obtain
permits from the Ministry of Trade. If they sell the
foreign-made cigarettes, that would be considered smuggling,
the report said.</p>
<p>NEW ZEALAND CHAMPAGNE RULING</p>
<p>A New Zealand High Court judge has ruled that only wines
produced in the Champagne region of France can be labeled as
champagne for local sale.</p>
<p>The judgment was the result of a lawsuit brought by the
Comite Interprofessionel du Vin de Champagne, a French
champagne producers' agency, against Wineworths Group Ltd., a
New Zealand liquor concern that distributes Australian wine
labeled as champagne. The producers' agency was joined in the
lawsuit by French companies Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin S.A.,
Champagne Lanson Pere et Fils and Champagne Bollinger S.A.</p>
<p>Wineworths's defense of the lawsuit was funded by Penfolds
Ltd., an Australian wine producer that markets Seaview brand
wine under the champagne label.</p>
<p>The High Court ruled that "champagne" isn't a generic word
and that to sell wine produced other than in the Champagne
region of France under that name contravened New Zealand's
Fair Trading Act.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>Mayor Hitoshi Motoshima of Nagasaki, the second Japanese
city devastated by an atomic bomb, apologized for Japan's
past aggression in a ceremony yesterday marking the 45th
anniversary of the attack. He cited Japan's annexation of
Korea in 1910, the 15 years of war with China and World War
II. . . . Joan Kirner took over as premier of the Australian
state of Victoria yesterday, becoming only the second woman
state premier in Australian history.</p>
