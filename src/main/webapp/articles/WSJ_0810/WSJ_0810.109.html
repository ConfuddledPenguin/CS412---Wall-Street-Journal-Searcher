	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- At a conference of Hispanic activists here,
Sen. Alan Simpson is having a tough go of it as he defends
the use of employer sanctions to discourage illegal
immigration.
   Struggling to be heard above the buzz of a disapproving
crowd, the Wyoming Republican finally snaps, "I didn't have
to show up, you know."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Perhaps not. But for many Republican officials and
candidates, appearances at groups like the National Council
of La Raza, an Hispanic-oriented research and advocacy group
that held its convention here last month, are becoming
virtually compulsory as the Republican Party tries to expand
its base in the post-Cold War, post-Reagan era.</p>
<p>"Republicans are losing the old dynamics -- anti-tax,
defense, anti-communism, anti-abortion to some extent," says
Republican analyst Kevin Phillips. "I think they're looking
around to see whether there's some new dynamics. Clearly
there's more flexibility {among Hispanic voters}, and an
amenability to Republicans."</p>
<p>Leading the GOP charge has been President Bush. During his
1988 presidential campaign he vowed to appoint the first
Hispanic cabinet member -- then beat his own timetable by
helping get Lauro Cavazos named education secretary in the
waning months of the Reagan administration. Once in the Oval
Office himself, Mr. Bush not only reappointed Mr. Cavazos but
named a second Hispanic to the cabinet, Interior Secretary
Manuel Lujan.</p>
<p>The president also has appointed Hispanics to other
important posts such as surgeon general and to the federal
bench, as well as to less visible positions on federal boards
and commissions. Overall, White House figures show, Mr. Bush
has appointed 19 Hispanic men and women to positions
requiring Senate confirmation, and 84 of the 2,304 political
appointees throughout the federal bureaucracy are Hispanic.</p>
<p>While those figures are still a small percentage of all
appointments, many Hispanic leaders give Mr. Bush high marks
for effort, and for something equally important: access. Last
month, for example, he appeared at the National Council of La
Raza's convention, becoming the first sitting president to do
so in the group's 22-year history. He has also made sure that
Hispanic leaders are consulted when issues of special concern
to them arise.</p>
<p>"He's getting credit and he deserves credit," says Raul
Yzaguirre, leader of the National Council of La Raza. "He's
certainly indicated he wants to be accessible to us."</p>
<p>In electoral terms, the GOP's courtship of Hispanic voters
might still seem a foolhardy quest. The national party has
been seriously trying to compete for the Hispanic vote since
California-born President Richard Nixon first began organized
outreach efforts. Yet according to ABC-TV's 1988 exit polls,
Democrat Michael Dukakis won about 66% of the Hispanic vote,
more than either Walter Mondale in 1984 (56%) or Jimmy Carter
in 1980 (55%).</p>
<p>The Southwest Voter Research Institute, a San Antonio,
Texas, research group that focuses on Hispanic issues,
figures that about three out of four Hispanic voters still
identify themselves as Democrats in every state but Florida,
where fervently anti-Communist Cubans have been GOP stalwarts
for decades. Of more than 3,317 Hispanic elected officials
surveyed in 1987, 89% were Democrats and only 9% Republicans.</p>
<p>Moreover, of more than 20 million Hispanics in the U.S. in
1988, about 13 million were old enough to vote, but only
about 4.6 million were registered, according to the Census
Bureau. The low registration rate comes about in part because
nearly 40% of Hispanic adults aren't citizens and thus aren't
eligible to vote.</p>
<p>But several other factors combine to convince GOP
strategists that they can't ignore the Hispanic bloc. For one
thing, Hispanic voters are concentrated in the 10 largest --
and thus most strategically important -- states, including
California, Texas, New York, Florida, and Illinois, as well
as smaller but growing states like Colorado and New Mexico.
Hispanic voters also have increased their political
participation substantially in recent years. Voter
registration and turnout both rose nearly 20% between the
1984 and 1988 elections.</p>
<p>Much of the increase is related to rapid growth in the
Hispanic population. But Andy Hernandez, who heads the
Southwest Voter Research Institute as well as a related
voter-registration project, also sees a substantial increase
in Hispanic voters "getting into the loop" and deciding to
participate in the political process.</p>
<p>What especially attracts Republican strategists is a
belief that Hispanic voters are less firmly tied to one
political party and more willing to switch when the right
candidate or issue presents itself. "There's an elasticity
there that you don't have with the black vote," says
Republican pollster Robert Teeter, a close associate of
President Bush.</p>
<p>Moreover, GOP strategists say, many Hispanic voters can be
lured by longstanding Republican positions on such issues as
economic opportunity, defense and "family values." Also
appealing is the relative youth of the Hispanic population --
the median age is only 26.1 years, compared with 27.7 for
blacks and 33.6 for whites -- giving the GOP a chance to make
inroads with a population whose party loyalties haven't yet
taken root.</p>
<p>The Republicans, says Mr. Hernandez, "don't have to win
all the Hispanic votesthey just have to cut margins. It's
their opportunity to improve their competitiveness,"
especially on less-visible or "downballot" races.</p>
<p>In some cases, though, the Republicans have found the
process of making inroads to be slow going. In Texas, for
instance, the voter institute's numbers show that 60% of the
Hispanics who voted for President Reagan shifted to Mr.
Dukakis in the 1988 election. "In 1988 we were beginning to
understand that Hispanic poverty had increased," and many
voters blamed Mr. Reagan's policies for that, says the
National Council of La Raza's Mr. Yzaguirre.</p>
<p>Adding to the problem was a political misstep that,
observers say, made many Latinos feel unwelcome in the Texas
GOP. In 1986, the Republicans had nominated a Hispanic for
state attorney general who, although narrowly losing the
race, garnered more Hispanic votes than any Republican
candidate ever. The candidate had done well in part by
pointedly campaigning in both Spanish and English. Just days
after the election, though, the state party endorsed a move
to designate English as the official U.S. language. "All the
good work got wiped out with that one act," says Mr.
Hernandez.</p>
<p>"Both parties are serious about Hispanic votes," he adds.
"The question is, are they going to take Hispanic voters
seriously."</p>
