	<p class="article-leader">CINCINNATI -- If it rusts, Roger W. Ach II wants it.
   For seven years, the company Mr. Ach controls, Chicago
West Pullman Corp., has been scooping up some of America's
more woebegone companies at bargain prices. To some, the
whole idea is folly. But Mr. Ach is gambling that it will
work.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>When Mr. Ach had his company buy a largely mothballed
steel operation from USX Corp. for $30 million four years
ago, bankers "thought he was off his rocker," says Drummond
Bell, who represented USX in the negotiations. It took Mr.
Ach seven months to find a lender.</p>
<p>Mr. Ach, 47 years old, admits that asking for loans is
like "talking into the wind." But he has been helped by
rock-bottom acquisition prices, government aid for ailing
industries, and a captive labor force and weakened unions.</p>
<p>Since Mr. Ach quit a Wall Street job to start Chicago West
Pullman seven years ago, the company has bought six little
railroads, a hemorrhaging compressed-air products company, a
freight car company and other rusty treasures. Stuck in
Baltimore one night in 1988, Mr. Ach took a ride back to
Cincinnati on fledgling Enterprise Airlines. He liked the
ride so much, he bought that company, too.</p>
<p>Chicago West Pullman won't disclose its debt level or
earnings, but Mr. Ach says that it is profitable. The company
says it had revenue of $250 million in the year ended June
30, up almost fourfold since 1987.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Noyce, chief financial officer, says Chicago West
Pullman has borrowed heavily, using banks, venture capital
companies and finance companies. But he says the company is
able to handle the debt, even if there is a recession.</p>
<p>One of Mr. Ach's current endeavors is a revived attempt to
acquire the Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad, a transportation
concern that lost $90 million over the last eight years. Mr.
Ach abandoned his attempt to buy P&LE two years ago when
railroad workers went to court to block the sale. Though the
dispute has been resolved, P&LE now says it doesn't want to
sell.</p>
<p>Mr. Ach's interest in the Rust Belt is partly nostalgic.
"It's a wonderful city," he says of his native Cincinnati.
Mr. Ach says he never lost faith in the area or its
manufacturing backbone. His office is littered with models of
trains, planes and barges, and a railroad bell.</p>
<p>Mr. Ach believes there will be a revival of heavy
industry. Citing the area's natural resources and educated
labor supply, he says the Rust Belt will rise above the
slumping coastal economies. His company is getting some help
from the government: Chicago West Pullman received $4.5
million in loans and grants from the state of Ohio for
reopening a plant that had been closed. The company also has
received aid from the state of Illinois.</p>
<p>Chicago West Pullman also relies on cheap labor. In
reopening plants, the company has leverage over its workers,
whose alternative is often unemployment. The company admits
it hires fewer workers and pays them less than previous
owners had paid. "A lot of guys here are having trouble
keeping their heads above water," says one worker at American
Steel & Wire's Cuyahoga Heights, Ohio, facility.</p>
<p>The company incurred the wrath of unions last year when an
organizing effort failed at the Cuyahoga facility. "They put
on a campaign against us like you couldn't believe," says an
organizer for the United Steelworkers.</p>
<p>The company hired a consultant, held meetings and a slide
show for workers, and even held a picnic a few days before
the union vote, at which it distributed profit-sharing
checks. The union complained about the tactics and, in an
agreement with the National Labor Relations Board, the
company said it would refrain from such practices in the
future.</p>
<p>The company says employees will ultimately make more
through a profit-sharing program. At Vortec Corp., a
Cincinnati air-compression products acquired by Chicago West
Pullman in 1988, some workers are optimistic about
profit-sharing -- but not rich. "Profit sharing, ah, it's all
right," says Stanley Coley, a factory worker. "It's not at
its potential yet."</p>
<p>The company also encourages, and in some cases requires,
employee-ownership. At American Steel & Wire, which is
51%-owned by Chicago West Pullman, every employee must buy
$100 worth of the stock. Although many employees say they
like the plan, the stock has slumped. In national
over-the-counter trading yesterday, American Steel & Wire
shares closed at $2.50, down from more than $10 a share in
early 1989. At Vortec, a voluntary stock-purchase plan has
had no takers.</p>
<p>American Steel & Wire posted a net loss of $313,000 for
the nine months ended March 31. AS&W also expects a one-time
charge of $95 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting money
it borrowed to refinance the company and to pay a dividend.</p>
<p>Still, Mr. Ach says he's in the Rust Belt for the long
haul. "High-tech businesses are wonderful," he says. "But
we're in a more basic business, and we like it."</p>
