	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- "It's time to slam-dunk the judge in Cincinnati
for putting Pete Rose in jail," says the Detroit radio talk
show host. "It serves no purpose whatsoever."
   That's the word from a man who has been there -- former
Detroit Tigers pitching ace Denny McLain, who served 2 1/2
years in federal prison before his conviction on charges of
racketeering, extortion and drug-dealing was overturned in
1987. He had been sentenced to 23 years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Rose, the former Cincinnati Reds player and manager,
entered the federal prison at Marion, Ill., this week to
serve five months for filing false income-tax returns. He was
also fined $50,000. As Mr. Rose begins his stint, he has
reason to take heart: If Denny McLain was able to make a
comeback, anybody probably can.</p>
<p>In 1970, Mr. McLain was suspended from baseball three
times: first for investing in a bookmaking ring, then for
throwing water on sportswriters, and finally for carrying a
gun. Off the field, he lurched from one business disaster to
another, twice declaring insolvency.</p>
<p>Life since prison has been kind to Mr. McLain, although at
46 years of age he is many pounds overweight and bears little
resemblance to the stylish athlete who in 1968 won 31 games
-- nobody since has come close -- and pitched the Tigers into
the World Series. But he has kept the crooked grin and
rough-spun sense of humor that amused Detroit baseball fans.
Even his love life has been aired on his show. He recently
told his listeners how "pure, unmitigated PMS" ruined an
anticipated romantic interlude with Mrs. McLain in a
heart-shaped Jacuzzi.</p>
<p>"Of all the athletes I've known he is the most unusual,"
says Joe Falls, a Detroit News sports columnist, who has been
covering Mr. McLain since the early 1960s. "I like him," he
says, adding that he can't defend Mr. McLain's past behavior.</p>
<p>Detroit likes him, too. His morning talk show at WXYT has
nearly doubled its ratings since Mr. McLain took over five
months ago. The show has 165,000 listeners, the station says.
Mr. McLain also appears on a local television sports show.
Outside Detroit, he gets paid for appearing at baseball-card
shows. He won't say how much he earns.</p>
<p>As for Mr. Rose, Mr. McLain tells his radio audience,
"Money is the way to hurt Pete, not jail." He says the judge
should have fined Mr. Rose $500,000 instead of $50,000.
"While he's in jail," he says, "he'll line up a thousand card
shows."</p>
<p>Mr. McLain -- himself a potential candidate for baseball's
Hall of Fame -- says Mr. Rose shouldn't be admitted to the
institution, at least if he did bet on baseball games, as the
late baseball commissioner A. Bartlett Giammatti alleged last
year. Mr. McLain says he himself limited his betting to other
sports.</p>
<p>But even as a baseball player, Mr. McLain played by his
own rules. He once purposely served up a home-run pitch to
the aging Mickey Mantle. Between starts, he flew around the
country to speak, perform on the organ or hobnob with
celebrities. The Tigers' management tolerated his antics
because Mr. McLain kept winning. "He was a cocky s.o.b.,"
says Gates Brown, a Tiger teammate in those days. "Then
again, he had the reason to be."</p>
<p>Mr. McLain's winning ways came to a screeching halt in
1970, the year he was suspended three times. When he did get
to play, his pitches had lost their zip. Mr. McLain's right
shoulder, which had been injected dozens of times with
cortisone shots, was worn out. Two years later, at the age of
28, he pitched his last major league game. By his own
account, Mr. McLain spent the next dozen years wheeling and
dealing.</p>
<p>"It was like he was out there floundering about," says
Sharyn McLain, his wife of 27 years. "He did a lot of
different things, but nothing made him happy."</p>
<p>The McLains spent most of their time in Florida, where Mr.
McLain eventually got into big trouble. By his own admission,
he was involved in gambling. A plane leased to him was used
to transport cocaine, although he denied knowing of any drug
shipment. Neither federal authorities nor a federal court
jury in Tampa believed his denials, and he was convicted.</p>
<p>While Mr. McLain was behind bars, his family was forced to
sell the house, most of the furniture, and a car. His wife
and children took jobs. "One week we had spaghetti five
nights in a row, just getting less and less every night,"
Mrs. McLain recalls.</p>
<p>After his release from prison in 1987, he pleaded guilty
to all the pending charges against him to avoid a retrial.
The judge in the case, however, said he had served enough
time in prison.</p>
<p>Mr. McLain began making paid appearances at card shows and
doing public relations for a minor-league hockey team in Fort
Wayne, Ind. He played the keyboard at a Detroit area night
spot where Leon Spinks, the former heavyweight boxing
champion, tended bar. And, with Mike Nahrstedt of the
Sporting News, he wrote a book about his troubles entitled
"Strikeout: The Story of Denny McLain."</p>
<p>Then he got a big break. WXYT, the Detroit radio station,
offered him a job in April 1989 after he appeared as a guest.
"When I first heard him on the air, I knew he had the gift of
gab," says Joan Cherry Isabella, the station's executive
producer.</p>
<p>Mr. McLain worked afternoons for nearly a year. Then he
got his shot at the key morning rush-hour traffic slot from 6
a.m. to 9 a.m. weekdays.</p>
<p>Mr. McLain lives in a rented house in an executive suburb
of Detroit. He drives his Chevrolet Blazer to the radio
station, showing up before 5 a.m. each day, with a 12-pack of
sodas under his arm, to begin leafing through newspapers. He
has always read newspapers voraciously and professes more
interest in city politics than in sports. "I never grabbed
the sports section first unless there was something negative
about me," he says.</p>
<p>He takes a special interest in criminal justice and
regularly discusses local court decisions on the air. He
calls himself middle-of-the-road. He dislikes abortion, but
he is pro-choice. He is for gun control, the Equal Rights
Amendment and capital punishment. Sometimes he talks of his
own time in prison. Recently he had Arnold Levine, his former
defense attorney, as a guest.</p>
<p>Ted Koppel he isn't. "He doesn't go for the throat," says
Ms. Isabella, "but a lot of people are willing to talk to him
because of that."</p>
<p>In some ways, he is still the old Denny. When he played
baseball, he had a reputation for waving off signals from his
catcher and making the pitch he wanted. Now, he waves off
signals from his producer. "Denny makes the rules up as he
goes along," says the producer, Arthur Regner.</p>
<p>Mr. McLain plays a game in which listeners answer
questions about newsmakers. Winners are supposed to get
symphony tickets. But on this occasion, Mr. McLain decides to
give out pizza coupons instead. The trouble is, the station
has run out of pizza coupons.</p>
<p>"We occasionally have to run behind him with a little
mop," says Michael Packer, the station's vice president. But
the radio station is happy to do that as long as Mr. McLain
keeps pitching his audience-grabbing spiels.</p>
<p>After the show, he attacks his usual breakfast (three
eggs, three sausage patties) at a nearby restaurant that he
calls the "House of Pain." He still walks with a ball
player's swagger, flinging open the door as he enters a room.
But his wife and friends say prison changed him -- for the
better. "Being there can humble a person," says Mr. Brown.
Before becoming a professional baseball player, Mr. Brown
spent two years in state prison in Ohio on charges of
breaking and entering.</p>
<p>Prison will be an eye-opener for Mr. Rose, too, says Mr.
McLain. "When some guy comes up to him and says, `What's your
name?'" Mr. McLain muses, "That's what will shock him."</p>
