	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A full 18 months after the costliest thrift
failure ever, federal savings-and-loan officials are trying
to learn whether the thrift's top executive, Charles Keating
Jr., has $40.9 million he can return to the failed S&L.
   Under administrative proceedings begun yesterday, thrift
regulators are seeking an accounting of Mr. Keating's
finances as well as $40.9 million in restitution -- a
fraction of the $2.5 billion in losses stemming from the
failure of Lincoln Savings & Loan Association.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The regulators also are seeking to remove Mr. Keating as
chairman of American Continental Corp., Lincoln's Phoenix,
Ariz., parent, along with five other officers. In addition,
the regulators also would require Mr. Keating to give them
two days' notice before transferring assets in excess of
$5,000.</p>
<p>"We do not believe his statements to the press or to the
public that he is broke," said Timothy Ryan, the director of
the Office of Thrift Supervision. "There was too much money
that was available to him, and too short a time for it all to
disappear."</p>
<p>The proceedings began on the first anniversary of the
savings-and-loan cleanup law and federal officials have been
putting the best face possible on the deteriorating mess in a
flurry of recent speeches and news briefings.</p>
<p>"This action is literally bolting the barn door after the
horse left," says Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution,
a Washington think tank. "The money is already long gone.
This will join the many other cases in which they {the
regulators} may get successful judgments, but not any money."</p>
<p>Lincoln, of Irvine, Calif., was seized by the government
in April 1989, one day after parent American Continental
filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code.</p>
<p>The amount of restitution is the largest ever sought by
the thrift office, Mr. Ryan said. He added that he didn't
believe that 18 months was a long spell before getting a
grasp of Mr. Keating's finances. "I think it's prompt
action," Mr. Ryan said, but he added: "I've only been here
four months." Previously, Mr. Ryan was an attorney at the
Labor Department.</p>
<p>An American Continental spokesman, Brad Boland, who is Mr.
Keating's son-in-law, said that federal regulators are
explicitly familiar with Mr. Keating's finances through a
separate federal suit filed by the Resolution Trust Corp.</p>
<p>"As usual, when they can't get the results they want in a
court of competent jurisdiction, they resort to
administrative fiat," he said, adding: "They know every
nickel he has." Mr. Boland said that Mr. Keating's extensive
legal bills are being paid through insurance companies.</p>
<p>The administrative case is being pursued alongside a
tangle of several other suits between the government and Mr.
Keating, who has become a symbol of the high-flying thrift
executive investing in wild land schemes.</p>
<p>American Continental is in the midst of bankruptcy court
proceedings in Phoenix. The company has sued the thrift
office in an effort to overturn its seizure of Lincoln.
American Continental bondholders have sued the company
alleging fraud. The Resolution Trust Corp. is in the midst of
a $1.1 billion civil racketeering lawsuit against Lincoln.
And a grand jury in Los Angeles also is investigating Lincoln
for possible criminal violations. Throughout all of these
proceedings Mr. Keating has consistently denied any
wrongdoing.</p>
<p>The administrative case focuses on three transactions
involving Mr. Keating and several associates of American
Continental. Regulators contend that these transactions piled
up the $40.9 million of losses.</p>
