	<p class="article-leader">A former Texas thrift official was placed on paid leave
from his job with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. after
he was indicted earlier this week on charges related to the
thrift's failure.
   Milton R. Perry has been employed by the FDIC since 1987,
about a year after his ouster as executive vice president of
the now-failed Lamar Savings Association of Austin, Texas.
Lamar Savings failed in 1986 with about $2 billion in assets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Perry was placed on administrative leave Tuesday, the
same day he and five other men, including former Lamar
Savings owner Stanley E. Adams, were indicted on federal
criminal charges related to the alleged misapplication of
$121.1 million in thrift assets.</p>
<p>An FDIC spokesman said Mr. Perry worked as an account
officer in the FDIC's Houston office, where he managed a
portfolio of loans and investments for the agency.</p>
<p>The spokesman said Mr. Perry will continue to receive his
government salary while on leave. A specific salary figure
wasn't immediately available, but the spokesman said Mr.
Perry's salary could range from $32,880 to $60,000, depending
on the number of years he worked for the federal government.</p>
<p>Mr. Perry's civil attorney, Henry Novak Jr. of Austin,
said his client indicated that he wouldn't resign from the
FDIC. "He doesn't feel that he's done anything wrong," Mr.
Novak said.</p>
