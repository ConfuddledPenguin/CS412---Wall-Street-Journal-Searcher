	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Sara Lee Corp., a food and consumer products
company, said it will close its hosiery plant in LaGrange,
Ga., and lay off about 425 employees, citing costs in an
"extremely competitive market." The company began moving
production from the plant, which lacks knitting capabilities,
to other facilities last May.
   Separately, Sara Lee said it agreed to buy the Sans Group,
based in Mataro, Spain, a maker and marketer of underwear.
Terms weren't disclosed. Privately held Sans Group markets
underwear with the brand names Abanderado, Princesa, Olimpic
and Ocean. Sara Lee makes and markets the underwear brands
Hanes, Hanes Her Way and Dim.</p>
