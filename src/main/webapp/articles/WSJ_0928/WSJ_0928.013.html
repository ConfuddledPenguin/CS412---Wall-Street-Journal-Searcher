	<p class="article-leader">MADRID -- Iberia Airlines has set its sights on Latin
America for expansion as part of a global strategy aimed at
boosting profits and strengthening cooperation with other
European airlines.
   Chairman Miguel Aguilo said Latin America is "a market
where Iberia is already very strong. We intend to consolidate
that position."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In Europe, Iberia will build its Viva subsidiary into a
second-tier airline to compete with the rapidly restructuring
charter business, he added.</p>
<p>Thanks to lower overheads, Viva, whose full name is Vuelos
Internacionales de Vacaciones, will be able to offer
discounted flights without upsetting Iberia's tariff
structure.</p>
<p>Since his June appointment, the chairman, an engineer, has
mapped out a strategy for Iberia that is based on internal
reorganization and international expansion. For the moment,
his plans appear to meet the approval of outside analysts.</p>
<p>"It's a very good thing to put senior executives closer to
the marketplace and be more flexible on the marketplace,"
said Richard Bond, vice president in charge of aviation
consulting at London-based consultancy Cresap Telesis,
commenting on Iberia's internal restructuring.</p>
<p>As for Viva, Mr. Bond added, "it gives a means of
competing in the transforming charter market that perhaps
Iberia itself couldn't do very well."</p>
<p>Last year, Iberia's net profit plunged 74% to 6.22 billion
pesetas ($65 million) from P24.26 billion ($246 million)
because of a lengthy strike by mechanics, higher operating
costs and a drop in tourist spending.</p>
<p>This year, strikes by cabin staff, combined with the
effects of the peseta's strength against the dollar, higher
fuel prices and an accentuated slump in the Spanish tourist
trade will further chop Iberia's earnings.</p>
<p>Mr. Aguilo makes no effort to hide Iberia's problems. Like
other airlines, he says, "we're going into a cyclical
downturn. This year is going to be worse for us than previous
years. Profit will be reduced."</p>
<p>The prospect of European deregulation, moreover, promises
"a future full of uncertainties and complexities. The only
way to face up to these challenges is through
decentralization and delegation of responsibility," he said.</p>
<p>One of Mr. Aguilo's first acts since his appointment has
been to trim head-office staff and separate operating units
into individual profit centers. The process may take several
more months to complete. The goal is to improve vertical
communications, reduce staffing, and cut costs, at the same
time as giving each sector greater flexibility.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Aguilo has put Iberia on track for
expansion in Latin America, mirroring a general trend by
Spanish companies to seek closer business links with the
continent, building on their common language and close
cultural ties.</p>
<p>One of his first steps, in July, was to make what turned
out to be the only bid for 85% of Argentina's Aerolineas
Argentinas, as leader of a consortium including local
businessmen and a unit of CS First Boston Inc. Under the
plan, Iberia will take 20% of Aerolineas with an option to
raise its stake to 30%.</p>
<p>In a parallel move, he said, Iberia is at an advanced
stage in negotiations with two airlines in the Caribbean for
the purchase of a shareholding in one or the other of them.
One is the Dominican Republic's Cia. Dominicana de Aviacion.
Mr. Aguilo declined to identify the other carrier, but
Spanish press reports have referred to contacts between
Iberia and the national airlines of Venezuela and Colombia.</p>
<p>In Argentina, the Aerolineas acquisition has been slowed
by problems that Mr. Aguilo said appear to be related to
local political opposition to President Carlos Menem's
privatization plans. Though Iberia is ready to make a
scheduled first payment of $130 million, problems have been
raised by banks over how the funds should be channeled in
relation to existing debts.</p>
<p>Mr. Aguilo warned that Iberia can't wait indefinitely for
these problems to be sorted out, but he doesn't consider the
project to be in danger.</p>
<p>Through this link-up and the planned tie-up in the
Caribbean, Iberia's aim is to operate two hub systems to
serve both business and tourist traffic in Latin America.</p>
<p>In both cases, the link-ups would be designed to allow
Iberia and its prospective partner airlines to rationalize
flight schedules both to and from Latin America and within
Latin America and Europe.</p>
<p>In Buenos Aires, Iberia plans to locate small planes for
use on its own flights within Latin America, instead of
continuing on local flight-legs with costly trans-Atlantic
jumbo jets, as at present. In addition to boosting profits,
the project is designed to make Iberia a more attractive
partner for cooperation with other European airlines.</p>
<p>Rather than provoking a series of mergers, Mr. Aguilo
predicts, deregulation will cause European airlines to
cooperate in a series of small ways, gradually building up
closer links.</p>
<p>Iberia already has taken a series of steps in that
direction, for example, through participation in the Amadeus
computer reservations system, which groups several European
airlines.</p>
<p>Earlier this summer, the carrier launched a code-sharing
accord with Alitalia under which Iberia carries the Italian
airline's passengers on its Madrid-Mexico City flights and
Alitalia does the same for Iberia on its Rome-Bangkok route.</p>
<p>Mr. Aguilo said that this agreement is working well and
that cooperation between the two airlines is likely to be
expanded "providing it's in the interests of both partners."</p>
<p>Similarly, he said, Iberia is waiting for the European
Community Commission to give its clearance for a planned
cooperation pact between West Germany's Lufthansa and Air
France to see whether it can join that project. Lufthansa and
Air France have proposed cooperating in such areas as pilot
training, catering and executive exchanges. EC officials are
examining the plan to see whether it conflicts with
competition rules.</p>
<p>Starting next summer, Viva -- originally set up with
Lufthansa as a joint venture for charters -- will serve as
Iberia's second-tier carrier for flights between smaller
cities in Spain and other European countries, mainly Britain
and West Germany.</p>
<p>With younger staff, newer planes and lower operating
overheads, Viva will be able to offer tariffs competing with
the charter market. Ultimately, Mr. Aguilo predicted, the
European charter market will die out and charter companies
will convert to scheduled flights.</p>
<p>"Viva will aim less at business traffic and more at
tourism. It's a question of adjusting products to their
markets."</p>
