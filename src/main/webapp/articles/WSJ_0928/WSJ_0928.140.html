	<p class="article-leader">Chemical group Montedison S.p.A., Milan, Italy, said it
plans a capital increase of up to 2.5 trillion lire ($2.13
billion), in the event it decides to buy the 40% stake in its
Enimont S.p.A. joint venture currently held by Italian state
energy group Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi, or ENI.
   Montedison also reported an 18% drop in consolidated
profit for the first half of this year, reflecting worsening
business conditions in the chemical sector.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The announcements came at a critical time for the group,
as it faces the decision whether to pay out the huge sums
required to achieve the control it has long sought over
Enimont, or whether to cut its losses, sell its stake to ENI
and effectively pull out of the Italian chemical business.</p>
<p>Enimont was formed last year when ENI and Montedison
merged their base chemical businesses. But the joint venture,
in which each holds 40%, has been plagued by fundamental
disagreements over long-term strategy. Now the Italian
government has proposed that the venture should effectively
be auctioned between the partners, with ENI having the right
to name a price and Montedison the right of first refusal.</p>
