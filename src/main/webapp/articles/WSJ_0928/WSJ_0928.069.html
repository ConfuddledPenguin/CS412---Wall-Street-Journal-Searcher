	<p class="article-leader">MIAMI -- Carnival Cruise Lines Inc. said it expects to
report fiscal third-quarter per-share earnings in line with
analysts' estimates of 79 cents to 81 cents, up from the
year-earlier 63 cents, said Micky Arison, president and chief
executive officer.
   Net income will be between $105 million and $110 million,
Mr. Arison estimated, compared with the year-earlier
quarter's $84.4 million. Revenue for the quarter, ended Aug.
31, will approximate $500 million compared with $405.2
million a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Arison attributed the improved results to new business
generated from the Fantasy cruise ship, added to the fleet in
March. Extra capacity also came from the addition of 490
berths to the Westerdam this year. Carnival is the world's
largest cruise line based on passengers carried.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, amid investor concerns about a recession
and rising fuel prices, Carnival's stock has had the wind
blown out of its sails. Recent analyst reports have reflected
some of the caution. Since early August, Carnival's stock
price has fallen about 34%. "Our stock has taken a pretty
good hammering," said Mr. Arinson.</p>
<p>But the president said the concerns are overblown. On
fuel, he said, there was "very little impact" on
third-quarter earnings. And fuel costs are proportionally
much lower for the cruise industry, he said, than for others
in the travel business, such as airlines. When Iraq invaded
Kuwait, said Mr. Arison, fuel represented less than 3% of
Carnival's cost of sales -- a figure that has now only
climbed to about 4%. While conceding some small negative
impact on earnings in the future, he said, "We don't believe
that these fuel rates are sustainable." He added that "some
percentage of our going-forward fuel needs have been hedged."</p>
<p>As to the possibility of a recession, Mr. Arison says
investors need only look at history. In the 1982 recession,
he said, Carnival's bookings didn't decline. "We offer a good
value, all-inclusive vacation," that people who already plan
to go on vacation flock to in penny-pinching times, he said.</p>
<p>In the third quarter, occupancy levels were slightly
higher than the year-earlier quarter's 112.2%. (In the cruise
business, two passengers in a room count as 100% occupancy;
if kids or others stay, too, it rises above 100%.)</p>
<p>For the nine months, net will approximate $184 million to
$189 million, or $1.38 to $1.40 a share, compared with the
year-earlier period's $172.3 million, or $1.28 a share.
Revenue will be about $1 billion, up from the $921.6 million
in the year-earlier period.</p>
