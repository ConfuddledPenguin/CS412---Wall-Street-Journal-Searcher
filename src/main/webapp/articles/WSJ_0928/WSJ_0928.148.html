	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The slide in platinum prices accelerated into
a plunge, as they dropped for the fourth consecutive session.
Silver and gold also declined.
   Platinum for October delivery fell $10.70 an ounce to
$437.30, the lowest level since July 14, 1986, when the July
contract traded at $435.30. Since Aug. 21, when October
traded at $514.00, its price has fallen 15%, or $76.70 an
ounce.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts have pointed out that platinum, like silver and
palladium, is actually more an industrial metal than a
precious one. The price reflects a world-wide economic
slowdown, particularly in the automobile industry, where
platinum is used in catalytic converters to reduce pollution
from auto emissions.</p>
<p>South Africa, which produces about 85% of the world's
platinum, and the Soviet Union, which accounts for about 10%,
have been reported to be selling. Also pressuring prices,
analysts say, is that consumption is easing while production
is increasing.</p>
<p>According to Nina Lipton, research manager for the
Platinum Guild International, an industry group, traders and
analysts have been looking far and wide to account for the
price plunge.</p>
<p>"Yes, there has been a technical breakdown in the charts,"
she said, "but some of the fundamentals people are citing
aren't necessarily valid."</p>
<p>For example, she said, auto production overall is going
up, not down: "Automobile companies around the world are
producing more cars this year than last. U.S. auto makers
recently reported that they expect to turn out 9.6% more cars
in the fourth quarter than last year."</p>
<p>In addition, she said, catalytic converters are becoming
more widespread -- Brazil and Mexico will begin equipping new
cars with them next year -- and regulations both in the U.S.
and elsewhere are becoming more stringent, calling for more
platinum in each converter.</p>
<p>Analysts and traders are on firmer ground when they note
an absence of Japanese demand for platinum, she said.
Japanese investors are a pivotal factor in platinum -- it's
their favorite metal for jewelry -- but they have other
things on their minds now, she said.</p>
<p>"Their stock market is down, their interest rates are
rising, and they're concerned about the cost of oil because
they import 99% of their oil," Ms. Lipton said. "The Japanese
understand and like to invest in platinum, but at the moment
they're neither buying nor selling it."</p>
<p>There have been Japanese offerings of platinum, Ms. Lipton
said, "but there is some question if they are on behalf of
Japanese sellers. It is thought more likely that the business
is being done for the Soviet Union."</p>
<p>Ms. Lipton acknowledged that many analysts and traders
have long expected the price of platinum to boom because of
the world's heavy dependence on South Africa for supplies.
The turbulent political situation in that country has been
expected to affect production.</p>
<p>"First of all, there have been no reports that the tribal
violence has affected mine production," she said. "If that
were to happen, there would be a sound basis for that belief.
Secondly, the world is now focused on the Middle East, and
South African news has been shoved aside, so the current
violence isn't having the psychological impact that it could
have had, say, a couple of months ago."</p>
<p>The sharp price decline is also causing potential buyers
to stand aside, as they wait to see when the market will
bottom out, she said. And there is a widespread desire at
present not to invest in any kind of market -- stocks,
precious metals or any other -- and to hold cash, she said.</p>
<p>"It will become clear soon enough that, when the platinum
price bottoms out, it will be cheap in relation to its
underlying fundamentals," Ms. Lipton said.</p>
<p>Recession fears caused by the rise in oil prices depressed
platinum, said Ian MacDonald, a vice president of Credit
Suisse in New York. "If there is a recession, the auto
industry is the first one that's going to be hit, and that's
on people's minds. The recession won't be good for silver,
either. The spread between that metal and gold is widening."</p>
<p>December delivery gold ended with a $2 loss at $410.80 an
ounce. December silver was down 2.8 cents an ounce to
$4.8450.</p>
<p>In other commodity markets yesterday:</p>
<p>GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Soybean futures prices rose yesterday
and are expected to open still higher this morning as a
result of a crop report showing smaller-than-expected soybean
stockpiles carried over from the 1989-90 crop year. The
Agriculture Department said that as of Sept. 1, soybean
stockpiles from last season's crop totaled 239 million
bushels, which was 11 million to 13 million fewer than many
analysts had expected. Continued uncertainty in the Persian
Gulf and the risk that high oil prices will stoke an
inflationary fire in other commodities, also are supporting
soybean futures, said Steven Freed, a futures analyst with
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. Yesterday, soybean
futures for November delivery gained 3.75 cents a bushel to
close at $6.1925. Prices were supported by rumors that the
Soviet Union had purchased soybean meal from Argentina,
analysts said. Wheat futures may also gain this morning after
the release of a smaller-than-expected stockpile figure. The
government said wheat stockpiles as of Sept. 1 were 2.4
billion bushels, compared with analyst expectations of about
2.47 billion bushels, said Richard Loewy, president of
AgResource Co. in Chicago. The lower figure reflected the
increased use of wheat as livestock feed during the summer,
Mr. Loewy said. December wheat futures gained one cent a
bushel yesterday to close at $2.775. Corn stockpiles totaled
1.34 billion bushels, roughly in line with market
expectations. December corn futures slipped 0.75 cent a
bushel to close at $2.275.</p>
<p>COPPER: Futures prices rose, mostly reflecting tightness
of immediately available supplies, analysts said. The October
contract was up 2.65 cents a pound to $1.2755. The most
active contract, December, advanced 2.25 cents to $1.1985.
But overall, the world's supply and demand are about in
balance, with a tilt to the bearish side, Fred Demler, metals
economist at Paine Webber, said. World-wide consumption is
weaker, and supplies have risen, Mr. Demler said. The drop in
usage has been particularly notable in the U.S., he said,
where it fell 13% in August from July. Global deliveries of
copper as of the end of July were down 12% from a year
earlier, he said. This more than offset a 7% drop in world
output in July from a year earlier, he said.</p>
<p>SUGAR: Futures prices were easier. The October contract,
which ceases trading today, ended with a loss of 0.30 cent a
pound at 10.52 cents. The March contract showed a loss of
only 0.04 cent a pound at 10.54 cents. A private report that
projected a rise in global output of sugar caused selling in
both contracts, but the greater pressure in the October
delivery came from producers who sold contracts to fix prices
for their sugar, according to a dealer. F.O. Licht, the West
German sugar statistical firm, in its first estimate of the
1990-91 world sugar harvest, placed output at 111.5 million
metric tons, or 2.8 million tons more than in the 1989-90
season. A metric ton is 2,204.6 pounds.</p>
