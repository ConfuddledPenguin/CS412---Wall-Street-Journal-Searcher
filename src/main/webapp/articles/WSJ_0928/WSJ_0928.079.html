	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- The Japanese stock market seems to be signaling
the worst fears of people in pricey Osaka suburbs and
downtown Tokyo boardrooms: Japan's sky-high land prices are
poised for a plunge.
   At least, that's what some market analysts are concluding.
If they're right, big troubles lie ahead for banks and
securities companies with exposure to real estate.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Since Jan.1, property-related stocks listed on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange have lost 55% of their value, according to
Credit Lyonnais Securities (Japan) Ltd., compared with a
decline of 44% for the Nikkei average of 225 selected issues.</p>
<p>Banks are down 49% and securities companies -- their
profits already crushed by the stock market's steep reversals
-- are off 59%.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the Nikkei index closed at 21771.91, off
478.71.</p>
<p>In Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei sagged another 548.77 points
to close the morning session at 21223.14.</p>
<p>"From these numbers, one is tempted to think land prices
are likely to come down," says Credit Lyonnais's Benedicte
Ivey. Adds Stuart Matthews, a financial analyst in Tokyo for
Britain's Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities Ltd.: "These
(property and financial companies) are the guys who suffer
the pain earliest, and the market is reflecting their
prospects."</p>
<p>Like the stock market when it closed 1989 at a record
high, Japan's property market has been bloated by years of
easy money -- big trade surpluses, low interest rates and a
high exchange rate. A shift in those fundamentals snapped the
stock market's rise earlier this year. Yet land prices in
Japan remain the highest in the world: The market value of
the land in metropolitan Tokyo already exceeds the value of
all the property in the continental U.S., and land prices in
Japan are still soaring.</p>
<p>Just last week, the National Land Agency reported that
residential land prices rose 13.2% on average during the 12
months ended June 30, the fastest rate in two decades.
Commercial land prices were up 13.4%. The average price of a
square meter (1.2 square yards) in Tokyo was 858,600 yen
($6,237.48).</p>
<p>The only indication in the survey that land prices might
be cooling was that property prices in Osaka and other cities
outside Tokyo had stopped rising. Some real estate firms in
Tokyo also have reported anecdotal evidence of declining
prices.</p>
<p>While many observers, including some senior finance
officials, believe property prices will hold or at worst
decline slowly, some in the stock market now are latching
onto the recent reports as evidence that prices will head
south, and maybe in a hurry.</p>
<p>"I definitely think there will be a fall in land prices,"
says Bernard Siman, a real estate analyst at Jardine Fleming
Securities Co. He predicts that the decline will occur mainly
outside of Tokyo, and will carry land prices nationwide down
about 20%. In the capital, where demand is still high, prices
may fall only around 7%, he adds.</p>
<p>In part, he ascribes the containment of land prices to
moves by both the Bank of Japan and the Finance Ministry to
persuade banks, insurance companies and even some other
finance companies to cut their lending to the property
market.</p>
<p>More significant, he says, is the drop in share prices.
"That hurts capital formation," Mr. Siman says. "It's hard to
raise money."</p>
<p>Mr. Siman says the stock market's warnings of a crash in
property prices really might foreshadow a crisis in the
banking industry that could trigger a drop in property
prices. Japan's banks, anxious to meet international
capital-adequacy ratios coming into effect in March 1993,
recently have flooded the world's capital markets with about
$7 billion in subordinated loans and bonds. If the banks find
they can't raise enough capital, they could start pulling in
loans to the property market.</p>
<p>The consequences for Japan's -- and the world's -- economy
could be devastating. Capital from Japan already is in short
supply; the country's investors pulled $8.9 billion out of
U.S. stocks and bonds in the first half of the year. A major
reason they did so was to cover losses from the stock-market
decline at home: So far this year, the drop in Tokyo share
prices has wiped out close to 300 trillion yen in stock
values, the biggest loss ever in a stock market decline.</p>
<p>Some analysts say the ties between the stock and property
market suggest that property prices should decline now, too.
In the past, Japanese investors often borrowed against rising
property holdings to raise money they then invested in the
stock market. If they can't now repay the borrowings, their
recourse -- or the banks' -- may be to sell property.</p>
<p>But so far foreclosures have been rare. Any indication
that a bank is trying to cash out of the property market
could trigger a collapse in land prices.</p>
<p>Nobuyuki Ueda, an economist for LongTerm Credit Bank of
Japan Ltd., compares the banks' position to the developing
world's debt crisis. "If they try to pull out their money, it
will result in very serious problems to them," he says.</p>
<p>The crux of the problems is the huge exposure of Japanese
banks. At Mitsubishi Bank Ltd., for instance, planners say
that while loans to land or real estate companies comprise
less than a fifth of the bank's $357 billion in assets, as
much as a half of all the bank's assets are in some way land
related. Much of the lending is collateralized -- but only at
about half of current property values, which provides some
security, the bank argues.</p>
<p>"We are not so pessimistic that we are going to lose a lot
of money if the bubble bursts," says Kyota Ohmori, a planning
official. The stock market is less sure; Mitsubishi's share
prices has dropped to 1,550 yen from 3,310 yen at the end of
1989.</p>
<p>Besides, others warn, if banks try to sell property, they
will unleash an avalanche of stock and property selling by
nervous investors, who want to avoid being caught with big
losses. "The Japanese financial institutions are locked in a
trap because of mismanagement, and mismanagement of economic
policy," says LTCB's Mr. Ueda.</p>
<p>Indeed, even officials at the Bank of Japan, who take some
of the blame for the "easy money" environment that fueled the
boom in land prices, fret about the implications for Japan's
financial system. "If there is a too-steep decline (in land
prices), there is . . . a problem" for financial
institutions, one senior central bank official says. But, he
adds, higher interest rates are beginning to bring land
prices under control, though he emphasizes they are not yet
to the point of causing a property-market crash.</p>
<p>In addition, the government is considering proposals to
modify its land-tax policies to discourage land-hoarding and
increase the supply of property on the market. The Bank of
Japan official says there is "considerable pressure" on
politicians to bring land prices under control, before there
is a crash.</p>
<p>Ironically, those very proposals are now being cited by
some in the stock market as the reason land-related stocks
aren't recovering.</p>
<p>Still, says Kermit L. Schoenholtz, an economist at Salomon
Brothers Asia Inc., a real crash of the property market --
and not just property stocks -- is still a ways off.
"People's expectations are getting ahead of reality," he
says.</p>
