	<p class="article-leader">NEW CANAAN, Conn. -- After years of resisting market
pressures to develop personal computers, Smith Corona Corp.
is finally taking the plunge.
   The maker of electronic typewriters and personal word
processors said it formed a joint venture with the U.S. arm
of Taiwan-based Acer Group to develop and market personal
computers, expected to be on the market in early 1991.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We're extending our product line at the right time, just
as the home and small computer market is taking off," said G.
Lee Thompson, chairman and chief executive officer of Smith
Corona.</p>
<p>Indeed, the home and small office segment of the personal
computer market is considered the fastest growing in the
computer industry. According to LINK Resources Corp. a
market-research firm, the number of U.S. households with a
personal computer is growing 10% a year.</p>
<p>Smith Corona is hoping to tap into that potentially
lucrative market with the help of a company that is already a
major player in the personal computer industry. Acer, a maker
of IBM-compatible computers, is Taiwan's largest computer
maker, with more than $700 million in revenue. It also has a
network of 10,000 dealers in more than 70 countries.</p>
<p>But Smith Corona is also leaping into what is becoming an
increasingly crowded business environment. International
Business Machines Corp. and Tandy Corp., both eyeing a
potentially huge growth market, announced this summer new
computers aimed at the home market. IBM's PS/1 lists for
$1,000 to $2,000 while Tandy's 1000RL sells for $750 to
$1,300.</p>
<p>"It's a crowded market, but it's also a market that
unlikely competitors have had success," says G. Barry Nelson,
analyst with Louis Nicoud & Associates. "So I wouldn't write
them off."</p>
<p>In development for about a year, Smith Corona said the
computers will be sold under the Smith Corona/Acer brand
name, taking advantage of Smith Corona's brand awareness in
the U.S. and Acer's recognition overseas.</p>
<p>Initially, the computers will be manufactured in Taiwan by
Acer. The later will be made in Smith Corona's Cortland,
N.Y., plant, where the company currently makes high-end word
processors.</p>
<p>Although Smith Corona said that the computer would be able
to operate MSDOS application software, the most widely used
operating system for personal computers, it provided few
additional details about features and price other than to say
that the product would be "competitive." Smith Corona did not
indicate what type of computer processor, such as Intel's
Corp's 80286 or 80386, the computer would use.</p>
<p>Addressing concerns raised by analysts, the company
maintained that the computer won't eat into its existing word
processor business. "Customers are still looking for
task-specific products," Mr. Thompson said. "The word
processor fills that demand."</p>
<p>The home computer is a "evolutionary" extension of Smith
Corona's electronic typewriters and word processors, Mr.
Thompson added. Indeed, its higher-end models can do
virtually most functions that PCs can do, such as spell
checking and financial spreadsheets, and at a lower cost. Its
most expensive word processor lists for $599.</p>
<p>But growth in that market, which fills a very specific
demand, has been slow and has been basically sustained by a
loyal following of high school students and people who work
at home. The company is hoping the latest venture will boost
its sluggish profit growth.</p>
<p>Since going public last year, the company's stock has
plunged more than $17 a share, buffeted by lower than
expected earnings, foreign competition and sluggish demand
for its traditional products.</p>
<p>Smith Corona went public in mid-1989; it remains 47% owned
by Britain's Hanson PLC.</p>
