	<p class="article-leader">A federal judge in Birmingham, Ala., fined USX Corp. $4.1
million for conspiring to influence unfairly a concessionary
labor contract in 1983.
   The fine was the maximum penalty USX could have received
after its conviction in July on 14 criminal counts in
connection with its talks with the United Steelworkers union
to reopen its idled Fairfield works near Birmingham.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The government said USX influenced two union officials by
arranging for their pensions to be enriched beyond what they
would have received as regular company employees.</p>
<p>The case stemmed from 1983 labor negotiations when USX,
then U.S. Steel Corp., sought substantial concessions from
steelworkers to reopen the idled Fairfield works. A number of
workers allege that they lost income because of the pact.</p>
<p>The convictions have been seen as a strain on tense
negotiations between the union and USX, the nation's largest
steelmaker. They also could hurt the union's credibility
among some rank and file members.</p>
<p>USX was also ordered to pay restitution of $289,995 to two
pension funds that prosecutors claimed were depleted because
of the pension increases.</p>
<p>The two union officials, E.B. Rich, 60, and Thermon
Phillips, 62, who were also convicted in July, were
sentenced, but remain free on bond pending their appeals. Mr.
Rich received three years in jail plus three years probation
and a $6,000 fine. Mr. Phillips received 30 months in jail
plus two years probation and a $6,000 fine.</p>
<p>A USX spokesman said the company plans to appeal. USX has
said there was "clear error in the conduct of the trial which
will lead to a reversal of the verdicts."</p>
<p>Steelworkers president Lynn R. Williams said "we believe
the conviction will be reversed." The union has said the
practice of providing such pensions for union representatives
is widespread in U.S. industry. A Department of Labor survey
has found that 62% of U.S. manufacturers provide such
benefits to labor representatives even though they are
employed by unions.</p>
<p>The union said Mr. Phillips's post as director of
Steelworkers' District 36 will be temporarily filled by
Richard H. Davis, an administrative assistant at the
international union, pending Mr. Phillips's appeal. Mr. Rich,
a subdistrict director in Alabama, is retiring from his post.
No successor was named.</p>

<p>JURORS CHOSEN in Mapplethorpe obscenity case.</p>
<p>Prosecutors and defense attorneys in the obscenity and
child nudity case against Cincinnati's Contemporary Arts
Center and its director settled on a jury of four men and
four women, ending four days of jury selection.</p>
<p>The case is the first ever in the U.S. in which a museum
has been charged with obscenity. The charges center on seven
photographs in an exhibit of 175 works by the late Robert
Mapplethorpe.</p>
<p>None of the eight jurors or the two alternate jurors
selected had heard of the artist before April or seen his
retrospective exhibit. Only two, a sales associate at a
sporting goods outlet and an export coordinator for Procter &
Gamble, live in the city. The rest, including a warehouse
manager, a data processor, an electrical engineer, a
secretary, hospital quality control specialist and a systems
technician for Cincinnnati Bell Telephone Co. live in the
conservative suburbs. At least four have been active church
members.</p>
<p>Hamilton County Municipal Judge David H. Albanese has
asked reporters covering the trial not to publish the names
of the jurors because of possible harassment. Defense lawyers
declined to comment on the jury pool.</p>
<p>Jury selection is considered by many trial lawyers to be
the most important part of a trial, but the makeup of the
jury will have added significance in this case. The law
regarding obscenity hinges on whether the material in
question falls within average and acceptable community
standards or whether it appeals purely to prurient interest
and has no redeeming literary or artistic merit. Jurors in
this case will act as the conscience of their community and
pass judgment on what their community's standards should be.</p>
<p>Throughout the jury selection, Hamilton County's chief
prosecutor, Frank Prouty, systematically weeded out potential
jurors who indicated an interest in art or in visiting art
galleries and museums.</p>
<p>None of the jurors has ever been to the Center for
Contemporary Arts, and one hasn't been to an art gallery or
museum since grade school.</p>
<p>Opening arguments in the case are set to begin this
morning.</p>
<p>The photos in question -- five depicting homoerotic and
sadomasochistic images and two in which children posed with
their genitals exposed -- caused a furor here when the show
opened in April. The center and its director, Dennis Barrie,
are each charged with one misdemeanor count of pandering and
one misdemeanor count of using a minor in material with
nudity.</p>

<p>FORMER S&L EXECUTIVE pleads guilty to federal bank fraud
and tax evasion.</p>
<p>Donald Moskowitz, former president, chief executive
officer and chairman of United Savings Bank in Paterson,
N.J., admitted in federal court in Newark, N.J., that he used
bank funds to pay for personal expenses, took kickbacks from
loan customers and bank suppliers and evaded more than
$40,000 in personal income taxes. Judge Alfred M. Wolin
accepted his plea.</p>
<p>Mr. Moskowitz, who faces a maximum of 30 years in prison,
restitution and $1,350,000 in fines, misappropriated $325,000
in bank funds for personal use. He also estimated that the
fraud cost the bank between $2 million to $2.5 million.</p>
<p>According to Stuart Rabner, an assistant U.S. attorney,
United Savings Bank is one of the nation's top 100
fraud-ridden thrifts. The Resolution Trust Corporation took
over the bank in May.</p>
<p>"Obviously, his misappropriation of bank funds . . .
jeopardized the bank's funds," Mr. Rabner said. Mr.
Moskowitz's attorney, Edward Fitzpatrick, could not be
reached for comment.</p>

<p>JUDGE REFUSES to limit SEC's questioning of German broker.</p>
<p>The broker, Hans-Jurgen Klisch, is a defendant in the
Securities and Exchange Commission's civil suit alleging
insider-trading in connection with GTE Corp.'s merger with
Contel Corp. The $6.2 billion merger was announced July 12.
Mr. Klisch and others are charged with trading Contel
securities based on inside information about the merger.</p>
<p>Mr. Klisch, a broker for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in
Dusseldorf, West Germany, had asked federal Judge Charles
Haight in Manhattan to restrict the scope of the SEC's
questioning. Mr. Klisch said he feared the SEC would ask him
about his brokerage clients, which he said could lead to
violations of German law on disclosing information about bank
customers.</p>
<p>Judge Haight, however, ruled that because Mr. Klisch would
face civil, rather than criminal, penalties for such
disclosures, the SEC couldn't be restricted.</p>
<p>The deposition of Mr. Klisch was scheduled for today in
Dusseldorf.</p>

<p>PRO BONO: Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom appointed a
partner to oversee public interest work. Edwin E. McAmis, a
litigation partner with 31 years of trial experience, will
supervise the New York firm's pro bono civil litigation full
time. Mr. McAmis, who has specialized in corporate and
commercial disputes, said yesterday that pro bono litigation
"helps the firm meet its responsibilities to the community
and helps younger lawyers improve their skills as advocates."</p>
