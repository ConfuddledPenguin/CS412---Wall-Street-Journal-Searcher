	<p class="article-leader">Victor Ostrovsky is an intelligence agency's worst
nightmare: a former agent with a book contract.
   By now, the most sensational revelations contained in his
chronicle of greed, lust and ambition at the Israeli
intelligence service, the Mossad, have been well publicized.
Among the charges: that a top-secret arm of the Mossad with
24 to 27 veteran officers is spying in the U.S. and that the
Mossad failed to give the U.S. a detailed warning about an
impending truck-bomb attack that killed 241 Marines in Beirut
in 1983.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>And yet, even if Mr. Ostrovsky's charges prove true, they
are hardly surprising. After all, it's not unusual even for
friendly nations to spy on one another and refuse to share
information. (In the case of the Marines, the Israelis did
apparently pass on a tip, without many specifics so as not to
endanger their sources.) Instead, Mr. Ostrovsky's burst of
celebrity has largely come as the result of a heavy-handed
attempt by the Israeli government to ban the publication of
his book, "By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a
Mossad Officer" (St. Martin's Press, 336 pages, $22.95).</p>
<p>According to Mr. Ostrovsky, two Mossad agents visited him
at his home in Ottawa in the hopes of persuading him not to
publish. First they appealed to his patriotism; then they
offered to bribe him. Finally, he says, they threatened to
kill him.</p>
<p>As a last resort, the Mossad headed for courtrooms in
Canada and the U.S., winning a temporary order barring St.
Martin's from selling the book. It was a publicist's dream.
The first printing of 50,000 copies sold like Le Carre, after
an appeals court overturned the order. All this seems to be
propelling what is essentially a clumsily written tale,
co-authored by Canadian journalist Claire Hoy, to the
best-seller lists.</p>
<p>It is not that the Mossad didn't have some reason for
concern. Mr. Ostrovsky liberally names Israeli agents and
reveals details about the Mossad's communication codes. But
some of the fuss is probably distress at Mr. Ostrovsky's
timing. Created in the wake of Israel's 1948 War of
Independence, the Mossad was seen as ruthlessly devoted to
the survival of a country surrounded by hostile neighbors. In
recent years that reputation has been tarnished by political
scandal and the spectacle of former Israeli operatives
selling their services to the highest foreign bidder,
including Colombia's Medellin drug cartel and Panama's Manuel
Noriega.</p>
<p>Mr. Ostrovsky's is not an isolated voice in the call for
greater public accountability and openness by the Mossad. But
as a raconteur of the agency's misdeeds his credibility is
open to question. The first scene, in which the Mossad plies
an Iraqi scientist with money and prostitutes in an attempt
to get information about Iraq's nuclear complex, takes place
eight months before the Mossad even attempts to recruit Mr.
Ostrovsky.</p>
<p>It is never satisfactorily explained how Mr. Ostrovsky
came by his intimate knowledge of events with which he had no
direct contact. Apparently, he had access to classified
Mossad computer files. But that doesn't explain how Mr.
Ostrovsky reconstructed entire conversations and the
innermost thoughts of agents luring targets into their traps.</p>
<p>Mr. Ostrovsky inspires more confidence with his fact-heavy
front-line view of agent training. The story lumbers, but you
believe it when he describes how aspiring spies learn
discipline from beatings and other forms of humiliation.
There is practical training, too; the cadets learn how to
write secret messages, develop covers and follow people. They
spend their evenings scattered in apartments around Tel Aviv,
building secret cubbies for their documents and practicing
cover stories.</p>
<p>These earnest Mossad agents are no James Bonds, although
some of their sexual exploits as recounted by Mr. Ostrovsky
suggest a high degree of physical fitness. They don't even
get to play with high-tech gadgets, but are taught how to
exploit human weaknesses, using money, sex or pressure to get
what they want.</p>
<p>What's missing from the account is any sense of how Mr.
Ostrovsky feels as he slowly becomes, in his words, a con
artist for his country. Perhaps spies not inhabiting a Le
Carre novel are not introspective by nature, but Mr.
Ostrovsky claims to have kept a daily journal of his
experiences. Instead, he offers what read like transcripts of
every lecture he heard during the lengthy training.</p>
<p>Mr. Ostrovsky is equally cursory when describing his
ouster from the Mossad. The "unmaking" of Mr. Ostrovsky takes
only a few pages as he describes how he was made a scapegoat
for a failed 1986 attempt by Israel to capture PLO leaders by
forcing down a private jet flying to Libya. That's
unfortunate because Mr. Ostrovsky manages to sidestep the
larger issue of whether he, or any spy, can ever be truly
"unmade." He merely offers a sly admonishment near the end of
the tale: "You can't always take a spy at his word."</p>
