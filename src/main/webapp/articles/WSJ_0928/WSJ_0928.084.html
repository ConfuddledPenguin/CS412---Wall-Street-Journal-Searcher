	<p class="article-leader">STOCKHOLM -- Bo Ramfors says he spent a decade as a senior
executive at Scandinavia's biggest bank "moving very
comfortably in the shadow of big men."
   So much so that the affable 54-year-old banker was an
unknown quantity when management upheaval catapulted him last
year into the chief executive officer's job at Sweden's
Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken. Many analysts viewed Mr.
Ramfors as an interim choice to head the bank. After all, it
was well known among Stockholm's tight-knit financial
fraternity that he had reserved the right to retire from the
bank at age 55.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But Mr. Ramfors has surprised just about everybody, and
right now retirement is the last thing on his mind. Seizing
the reins with obvious relish, he pushed through a sweeping
management shake-up, scrapping SE Banken's unwieldy
collective management and taking over executive power
himself.</p>
<p>With assets of 360 billion Swedish kronor ($62.4 billion),
SE Banken is one of the world's 100 biggest banks. For three
consecutive years, beginning in 1986, it was the world's most
profitable, according to annual rankings prepared by London
rating agency IBCA Banking Analysis Ltd.</p>
<p>However, profitability has slipped during the past 18
months, and Mr. Ramfors frets that times are about to get
even tougher. So he's ordered a cost-cutting drive aimed at
slashing overhead in the bank's domestic operations between
8% and 12% during the next 18 months.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Ramfors is stepping up the pace of SE
Banken's international expansion. Three months ago, the bank
agreed to pay #153 million ($286.1 million) for the 78% it
didn't already own of Scandinavian Bank Group PLC of London.
SE Banken's biggest acquisition in years, it also was an
important step toward broadening the operational base of
Enskilda Securities, SE Banken's London-based merchant
banking unit and the spearhead for Mr. Ramfors's
international ambitions.</p>
<p>For all that activity, Mr. Ramfors has kept quiet about
what some consider his most impressive accomplishment so far
-- healing a longtime breach between SE Banken's dominant
shareholders. Relations have been sour between the bank's
biggest owners -- Sweden's Wallenberg group and the corporate
alliance of automaker AB Volvo and contracting group Skanska
AB -- since a bitter power struggle in the early 1980s.</p>
<p>The big owners have become increasingly worried about the
bank's sluggish profitability -- and appalled by the
plummeting price of SE Banken shares. In a series of secret
meetings this summer, Mr. Ramfors and his major shareholders
huddled to hone the management restructuring plan. That
cooperation smoothed acceptance of the plan from the bank's
full 43-member board, as well as the quartet of managing
directors, who saw much of their previous power usurped.</p>
<p>Staunch support from the big owners promises to be a trump
card as Mr. Ramfors struggles to squeeze better performance
from the bank.</p>
<p>SE Banken's management woes turned acute last autumn.
Jacob Palmstierna, an urbane aristocrat hand-picked to run
the bank, resigned under pressure of allegations of tax
evasion after serving as chief executive officer less than
six months. (A Stockholm appeals court acquitted Mr.
Palmstierna of tax evasion charges earlier this month. Mr.
Palmstierna isn't expected to return to the bank.)</p>
<p>The loss of Mr. Palmstierna was a double blow. He had been
expected to run the bank through the 1990s. More importantly,
his departure upset the balance among the four managing
directors who made up the bank's executive committee.</p>
<p>The committee wielded power collectively. The system, and
veto powers granted each managing director, dated from the
1970 merger that created SE Banken. The system prevented
either merger partner from steamrolling the other.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the consensus system proved virtually
impossible to dismantle. One reason was the bank's ponderous
board structure: 36 directors and deputies elected by
shareholders plus seven more state appointees. The bottleneck
choked decision-making.</p>
<p>The atmosphere of crisis stirred by Mr. Palmstierna's
forced departure helped pave the way for change at the bank,
SE Banken insiders say. "But Mr. Ramfors surprised everyone
by really bulldozing this through. He went to the big owners
with an ultimatum -- make changes or he'd leave," says a
senior SE Banken official.</p>
<p>The owners couldn't afford to lose another chief executive
officer so soon after Mr. Palmstierna's departure. Moreover,
they shared Mr. Ramfors's concern about the bank's prospects.</p>
<p>Operating profit at the parent bank climbed a modest 6%
during this year's first four months after remaining flat
last year at about 3.6 billion Swedish kronor. Reflecting the
problems, SE Banken's Series A shares -- the most traded
class of equity -- have plunged 33% over the past 12 months.</p>
<p>"SE Banken just hasn't been professionally run," says a
senior official at a rival Stockholm bank. "If you look at
their client base, by far the strongest in Sweden, it's
obvious that if they were well managed, annual profit would
be at least 50% higher."</p>
<p>Mr. Ramfors is concerned that the bank's hefty profit in
recent years was swelled by unique, windfall factors.
Sweeping market deregulation enabled Swedish banks to post
huge bond trading profits, he says. In addition, abolition of
longtime quotas on bank lending ushered in a burst of
unprecedented credit expansion, and favorable interest rate
movements swelled margins on banks' lending.</p>
<p>The coming decade, he insists, will be a different story.
SE Banken still earns virtually all its profit from
traditional commercial banking inside Sweden. Yet Mr. Ramfors
expects Sweden's economy to reap only marginal benefits from
the European Community's 1992 single-market plan. Meanwhile,
political constraints and Sweden's huge public sector will
continue to damp economic growth at home.</p>
<p>Credit expansion, he adds, probably will slow to about the
same rate as Swedish inflation from its heady 20% to 30%
annual growth rates in recent years. And the current
segregation of banks and insurers will cease, sharpening
competition for insurance and other consumer-oriented
financial services, which Mr. Ramfors expects to be virtually
the only source of growth for domestic operations.</p>
<p>"That sets the '90s for us," he says. "We won't see growth
in the economy, and we won't see growth in banks."</p>
<p>Operations outside Sweden will have to pick up the slack.
Though wary of fierce competition in many segments of
international banking, Mr. Ramfors says SE Banken "will
follow our customers abroad in the profitable segments where
we have competence." He cites two potential areas in
particular -- fund management and corporate finance,
including cross-border mergers and acquisitions. Enskilda
Securities has gradually carved out profitable international
niches in both fields.</p>
<p>"We know there's a hell of a battle underway in Europe,"
Mr. Ramfors says. And at least for the time being, he rules
out interest in a major acquisition within the EC. "But since
we've got a first-class customer base, which not too many
banks have, we'd be stupid not to try. As long as it doesn't
take too much capital, why can't Swedes do it? That's my
approach."</p>
