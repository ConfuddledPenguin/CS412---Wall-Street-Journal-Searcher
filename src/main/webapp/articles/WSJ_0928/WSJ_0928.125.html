	<p class="article-leader">Chase Manhattan Corp. said it was firing 98 workers in its
foreign-exchange and money-market operations in London in the
first wave of a plan to trim its non-U.S. operations by 1,600
employees.
   The bank holding company said it also had trimmed five
workers from its Frankfurt foreign-exchange operations and
closed its Zurich dealing room, eliminating 20 jobs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The cuts are part of a decision, which Chase announced a
week ago, to trim costs by shedding 5,000 employees
world-wide. Chase has about 2,600 remaining U.K. employees
and 4,500 throughout Europe. A spokesman declined to say how
many more of the planned non-U.S. reductions would come from
its London and European pool of workers. Chase intends to
complete all of its the staff reductions by year end, the
spokesman added.</p>
<p>The cutbacks stem from the company's deteriorating
commercial real estate loan portfolio.</p>
