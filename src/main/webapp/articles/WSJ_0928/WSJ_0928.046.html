	<p class="article-leader">WYOMISSING, Pa. -- VF Corp., hurt by substantially lower
orders and shipments in its Lee jeans division, said
financial results for the third and fourth quarters will be
"well below recent estimates."
   The apparel maker expressed "serious concerns about
general economic and industry conditions." The company said
current sluggishness appears to be linked to a decline in
sales for jeans during the back-to-school season. Business at
other VF divisions "appears to be meeting expectations," the
company said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company also indicated that fourth-quarter results
would suffer from the slump even more than third-quarter
performance. VF didn't say what its recent estimates for the
third and fourth periods had been, and wouldn't specify its
revised estimates.</p>
<p>In the year-ago third quarter the company earned $52
million, or 80 cents a share, on sales of $695.4 million.</p>
<p>VF said several alternatives are being explored to respond
to the unexpected shortfall. The company didn't elaborate.</p>
