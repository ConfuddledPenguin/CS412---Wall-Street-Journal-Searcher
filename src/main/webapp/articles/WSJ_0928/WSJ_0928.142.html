	<p class="article-leader">Saskatchewan Oil & Gas Corp., or Saskoil, said its largest
shareholder plans to reduce its stake to 10% from 28%, by
selling 145 million Canadian dollars (US$125.6 million) of
Saskoil shares to several securities dealers.
   Saskoil said the sale by Saskatchewan government-owned CIC
Industrial Interests Inc. of 10 million Saskoil shares at
C$14.50 each is expected to close next month, pending
regulatory approval.</p>

went public in 1986, said a group of seven securities dealers
purchased the shares for redistribution. Under provincial
