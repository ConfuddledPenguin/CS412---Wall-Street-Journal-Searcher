	<p class="article-leader">A LIST of the world's 25 largest securities firms compiled
by Wright Investors Service should have given Nomura
Securities' capital as $12.8 billion, not $10.9 billion. The
list represents figures as of each company's 1989 fiscal
year's end. In addition, Principal Mutual Life is based in
the U.S., not the U.K. as indicated in the list of the
world's 50 largest insurers. Both lists appeared in The Wall
Street Journal Report on world business.
