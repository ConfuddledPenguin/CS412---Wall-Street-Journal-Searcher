	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Construction contracting dropped 3% in August,
but that reflects virtually no change in the recent weak rate
of building activity, the latest F.W. Dodge report said.
   F.W. Dodge, the forecasting unit of McGraw-Hill Inc., said
total construction startup rates slipped to $230.14 billion
in August, from $236.31 billion in July. The seasonally
adjusted annual rate brought the Dodge index of contract
values down to 146 from 150 the previous month, as was
expected based on fluctuations reported since last winter's
steep decline. The index uses 1982 as a base of 100.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Regarding the impact of the Middle East conflict on the
value of new construction, George A. Christie, vice president
and chief economist for F.W. Dodge said, "The risk, of
course, is whether higher-cost oil will tip the already
weakened economy into recession by next winter. Chances are
it will, and that implies a secondary decline for
construction, particularly for commercial building and
housing."</p>
<p>Values for both nonresidential and residential building
eased 4% in August. Office building remained the weakest
segment, with an August rate of $77.52 billion, down from
$80.34 billion in July, when the level plummeted 23% to its
lowest level in a decade. Nonbuilding construction, including
public works and utilities, edged up 1% due to a surge of
sewer and water projects.</p>
<p>Through the eight months of 1990, total contracting values
fell 8% from the year ago period. The Northeast region
remained most depressed with a 24% shortfall for the eight
months, followed by the Southeast, which reported a 14% drop.
The only gain this year was in the North Central region,
which rose 3% in August.</p>
