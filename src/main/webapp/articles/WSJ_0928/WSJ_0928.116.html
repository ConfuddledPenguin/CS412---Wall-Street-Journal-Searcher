	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee
filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission
charging that its GOP rival is violating federal contribution
limits in Senate races through a fund-raising program called
the Inner Circle.
   Set up earlier this year as a separate fund-raising
committee, the National Republican Senatorial Committee is
using the Inner Circle to funnel $11 million to its Senate
candidates.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Federal law places limits on the contributions that party
committees can make to candidates. Each can contribute
$17,500 directly to candidates and make certain additional
expenditures on their behalf. Because the Inner Circle is set
up independently from the Republican committee, the
Republicans contend that those contributions to candidates
don't fall under these limits. In its complaint, the
Democratic committee says they should. Robert Bauer, general
counsel to the Democratic committee, says the Republican
committee is "trying to buy Senate seats."</p>
<p>In a news release, the GOP defended the Inner Circle
program as legal and ethical.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a federal judge here ruled that the
Republican committee had illegally circumvented spending
limits by routing $2.7 million to its Senate candidates in
1986.</p>
