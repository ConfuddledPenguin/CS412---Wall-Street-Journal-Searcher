	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- International stock funds have produced great
track records for a decade. But this doesn't mean their
managers have been great stock pickers.
   Take a close look at these managers, and you find that
they lagged behind their benchmark index almost as badly as
their U.S. counterparts. This lapse didn't matter much in the
1980s, with foreign stock markets booming. But if
international markets turn out to be more treacherous in the
1990s, then poor performance won't be nearly so palatable for
mutual fund investors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>International funds, which invest largely outside the
U.S., now dominate the list of top performers for the past
five years, and a handful crop up among the 10-year leaders.
According to Morningstar Inc., a Chicago mutual-fund research
concern, international stock funds returned 16.2% a year for
the decade ended Aug. 31, while domestic stock funds plodded
along at 12.2% a year. (Returns include both share-price
changes and dividends.)</p>
<p>The better performance of international funds hasn't gone
unnoticed by investors, who so far this year have poured $4.8
billion into international funds, more than any other type of
stock mutual fund.</p>
<p>Yet the managers of these international funds couldn't
help but look smart, compared with their parochial colleagues
who stuck with the U.S. market. Their returns were boosted by
both rapidly rising foreign stock markets and a falling
dollar.</p>
<p>On average during the decade, foreign stock markets
outpaced the U.S. market by 2.1 percentage points a year.
Then the foreign-currency effect kicked in, bringing U.S.
investors roughly 1.4 percentage points a year extra just
because of the sinking dollar, which meant that the foreign
portfolios were worth more when converted into greenbacks.</p>
<p>Investors shouldn't take these funds' returns at face
value. When it comes to evaluating performance, it isn't just
total return that counts, but also how a manager performs,
compared with a benchmark index. On this basis, international
stock fund managers are only marginally more skillful than
their colleagues who stick to U.S. stocks.</p>
<p>A frequently used benchmark for international stock funds
is the Morgan Stanley Capital International stock index for
Europe, Australia and the Far East. For the 10 years ended
Aug. 31, the average international stock fund lagged behind
Morgan Stanley's EAFE index by 2.1 percentage points a year.
By contrast, domestic stock funds fell below the Standard &
Poor's 500 index of domestic stocks by a slightly wider
margin, 2.6 percentage points a year.</p>
<p>International stock fund managers may find it tougher to
stay close to the EAFE index in the decade ahead. The
international market is "definitely more competitive than it
was 10 years ago," said Kenneth Gregory, editor of the L/G
No-Load Fund Analyst, a San Francisco newsletter. "It's going
to become more difficult to beat the averages."</p>
<p>This is bad news for international fund managers, who say
foreign stock-picking is already pretty tough. Running an
international stock fund "is like playing three-dimensional
chess," George Noble, manager of Fidelity Overseas, said.
"It's a lot more challenging than playing the U.S. market."</p>
<p>Most domestic mutual-fund managers shun grand predictions
about the economy or the stock market's direction, and
instead buy stocks based on their individual merits. Life
isn't so simple for fund managers who invest abroad. These
international stock pickers operate as part foreign-currency
trader, part global economist and part securities analyst. As
a result, said Lori Lucas, a fund analyst with Morningstar
Inc., many international funds end up "just buying baskets of
blue-chip stocks in markets that look attractive."</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, major mistakes occur. Many fund managers
missed the Tokyo market's spectacular rise from 1986 to 1988,
and as a result, the average international fund lagged behind
the EAFE index by 3.5 percentage points a year over the past
five years. But even if Japan is excluded from the EAFE
index, international funds would still have been laggards,
though only by two percentage points a year.</p>
<p>"The question is, is it so much more complicated that
you're going to shoot yourself in the foot?" Mr. Gregory, the
newsletter editor, said.</p>
<p>It seems not. For while most international stock fund
managers trail the index, a few do exceed it. A popular
strategy with the more successful crowd is to exploit
economic themes the managers hope will play out in the next
few years.</p>
<p>Ivy International's fund manager, Hakan Castegren, for
example, is looking for a recovery among shipping companies
and a pickup in the price of base metals. This has led him to
buy stocks such as Keppel Corp., a Singapore shipbuilder, and
RTZ Corp., a mining conglomerate.</p>
<p>Many fund managers are trying to make money from German
reunification, but Richard Foulkes, manager of Vanguard
World-International Growth, reckons the biggest stock market
winners won't be German stocks. "We're trying to play the
theme that German demand will be very great, and that the
biggest beneficiaries will be its major trading partners,"
Mr. Foulkes said. He now has 43% of his fund's assets
invested in Continental Europe, with half that money in Dutch
and Swiss stocks. "It's a wonderful situation, sitting next
to a rich cousin and feeding off him," he said.</p>
<p>William Holzer, manager of Scudder Global Fund, is looking
to exploit a looming world-wide shortage of bank credit. He
points out that West German banks are preoccupied with
reunification, and that U.S. and Japanese banks are cutting
back on new lending because of balance-sheet problems. "The
question arises, where will the available bank credit come
from?" said Mr. Holzer, who believes Swiss banks, such as
Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corp., could be
major beneficiaries.</p>
<p>For those who prefer fund managers who are a little more
systematic in their stock-picking, Vanguard Group offers two
alternatives. One is Trustees' Commingled International,
which is distributed by Vanguard but managed by the
computer-driven investors at Batterymarch Financial
Management of Boston. The fund has beaten the EAFE index over
the past three years, and matched the index over the past
five.</p>
<p>The other alternative is Vanguard's new international
stock index fund. The fund is divided into two portfolios.
The European Portfolio tracks the Morgan Stanley Capital
International Europe Index by buying a representative sample
of the index's stocks, and the Pacific Portfolio seeks to
replicate the performance of Morgan Stanley's Pacific Index.
To buy the two portfolios in the appropriate proportions,
given the relative size of the two markets, investors would
put 55 cents into the Pacific Portfolio for every 45 cents
going into the European Portfolio.</p>

<p>                 A World of Difference</p>
<p>Over the past decade, international stock mutual funds
have easily outpaced their domestic counterparts, though most
have lagged behind Morgan Stanley's International stock
market index. Here, some no-load and low-load international
funds that Morningstar Inc. rates highly, based on both
performance and risk.</p>
