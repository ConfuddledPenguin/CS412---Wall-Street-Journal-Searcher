	<p class="article-leader">The rapid acceptance of a new version of Microsoft Corp.'s
Windows is changing the balance of power in the $6.5 billion
business of supplying software applications for personal
computers.
   Windows is expanding the domain of Microsoft while
constraining the growth of Lotus Development Corp. and
WordPerfect Corp., currently the two largest applications
suppliers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Microsoft's Windows program adds a set of graphical
commands to DOS, the basic software that controls the
operations of International Business Machines Co.'s personal
computers and compatibles. Instead of controlling
applications through keystrokes and strings of letters, users
of Windows can choose commands from menus and point at icons
to launch operations, such as a picture of scissors standing
for a command to delete information. However, new
applications -- such as spreadsheets or word processing
programs -- are required to take full advantage of Windows.</p>
<p>Lotus and WordPerfect were caught without their flagship
products tailored to the new version of Windows when
Microsoft introduced it in May. Now they are starting to pay
a price as sales of both Windows and Microsoft's applications
for it are taking off.</p>
<p>"They're losing some of the new market for applications
because they didn't realize how important Windows would be or
how quickly it would catch on," said Andrew Seybold, an
analyst at Dataquest Inc., a market researcher. Both Lotus
and WordPerfect say they'll ship Windows versions of their
most popular applications in the first half of next year.</p>
<p>WordPerfect, which supplies the most popular DOS word
processing program, acknowledges that it is losing business
because it lacks a Windows version of its word-processing
program. "Windows is taking away incremental growth we would
have had through the end of the year," said Willard E.
Peterson, executive vice president at WordPerfect, a closely
held firm that expects $425 million in revenue this year.</p>
<p>Mr. Peterson added that he believes he can regain lost
share with a solid Windows product next year, but "if we
should do a bad job, our sales will level off or drift down."</p>
<p>Lotus, which has a networking product called Notes but
none of its popular spreadsheets on Windows, said it is too
soon to gauge the effect of Windows on its business. But Jim
Manzi, Lotus's chief executive officer, said "getting out our
Windows applications is the most important project at the
company."</p>
<p>Other software suppliers without Windows applications also
are feeling the pressure.</p>
<p>"It's very clear that every major account is evaluating
Windows, and they've all called me in to explain my Windows
strategy," said Fred Gibbons, chief executive officer at
Software Publishing Corp.</p>
<p>Mr. Gibbons said his concern, one of the 10 largest
suppliers of PC software, plans in its coming fiscal year to
spend more money on Windows development than any other
applications projects. In the year ending Sunday, the company
spent virtually nothing on Windows development.</p>
<p>With interest in Windows running high, companies that
offer Windows applications are drawing buy-out offers from
larger competitors. Earlier this year, for instance, Mr.
Gibbons offered to acquire Micrografx Inc., which supplies
two Windows graphics programs, for $80 million in stock,
according to J. Paul Grayson, Micrografx's chairman. Mr.
Grayson said he refused the offer and his firm later
completed a public stock offering. Mr. Gibbons declined to
comment.</p>
<p>Some customers are so enthusiastic about Windows that
they've even stopped entertaining sales pitches from software
companies that don't offer Windows applications.</p>
<p>"If a company doesn't have any Windows applications, I
don't even want them to visit," said Darrell Owen, who heads
an office automation group for the Bonneville Power
Administration in Portland, Ore. Mr. Owen said he recently
refused to see salespeople from Lotus and Ashton-Tate because
neither were peddling Windows applications.</p>
<p>Prospects for a sea-change in the word processing and
spreadsheet markets -- the two biggest in PC applications --
isn't likely, however, provided Lotus, WordPerfect and other
suppliers of popular DOS applications can quickly deliver
Windows versions of their products. Most customers say they
don't want to abandon products with huge followings, but "the
day will come when we will switch vendors if Windows
applications aren't available," warns Sheldon Laube, national
director of information and technology at Price Waterhouse.</p>
<p>A new study by International Data Corp. underscores this.
In a poll of 200 corporate PC users, the company found that
more than 60% plan to buy both word processing and
spreadsheet software tailored to Windows.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Microsoft hopes to expand its own
applications business, which in recent years has grown more
rapidly than its bread-and-butter operating software
business. William Gates, Microsoft's chief executive, said
the company posted "a significant increase" in applications
sales in July and August, and he hopes to increase the
pressure on competitors next week by offering a bundle of
three Microsoft Windows applications at a 50% discount.</p>
<p>Prior to the introduction of the new Windows version in
May, many Microsoft competitors were skeptical about its
prospects, asserting that OS/2 would emerge as a stronger
alternative. But in the past four months, Microsoft has
shipped more than one million copies of Windows while OS/2,
another Microsoft operating system, flounders. Last week,
IBM, one of the staunchest advocates of OS/2, even agreed to
license Windows.</p>
