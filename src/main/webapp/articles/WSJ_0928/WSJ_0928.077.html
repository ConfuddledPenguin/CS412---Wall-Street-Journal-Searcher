	<p class="article-leader">BLOOMFIELD TOWNSHIP, Mich. -- Erhard Dahm's sparkling new
BMW dealership in this well-heeled Detroit suburb doesn't
sell lemons. But you can get egg rolls there.
   Under the same roof as Erhard BMW's stone-floored
showroom, and right behind its floor-to-ceiling smoked-glass
windows, sits the Golden Phoenix, a Chinese restaurant. In
the west wing of Erhard's Ushaped building you can buy a jet
black BMW 750 iL for $72,870. In the east wing you can buy
the Golden Phoenix's house favorite -- sweet and sour shrimp
-- for $9.75. Take out or eat in.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A charming juxtaposition, perhaps, even though it was
accidental. But it won't last much longer.</p>
<p>"Having a Chinese restaurant in your building isn't part
of BMW's corporate standards," says Chris Consiglio, the
dealership's general manager.</p>
<p>These strange bedfellows got together last year, when Mr.
Dahm bought the building that housed the Strike & Spare
bowling alley along with the Golden Phoenix. Mr. Dahm then
began converting the 50,000 square-foot structure for his car
dealership. Shortly thereafter the owners of the Golden
Phoenix exercised an option to extend their lease, despite
the sale of the building. Erhard BMW has made it clear that,
come July, the Golden Phoenix will have to whip up its egg
foo yong somewhere else.</p>
<p>But if the restaurant's patrons had their way, it would be
Erhard BMW that would have to hit the road. "I don't want
{the restaurant} to move," says James Howard of nearby
Bloomfield Hills, who owns a small steel company. "It's a
family, neighborhood restaurant." Other patrons are
considering a petition drive to keep the Golden Phoenix where
it has been since 1972.</p>
<p>Erhard BMW, meanwhile, is trying to avoid looking like the
bad guy in all this. Dealership officials explain that they
moved to the upscale neighborhood "to be nearer our
clientele." And it's certainly not the food. "I eat there
once a week," Mr. Consiglio says.</p>
<p>Yee Ting, manager of the Golden Phoenix, is discouraging a
petition drive. He thinks that could only lead to trouble.
Mr. Yee came to the U.S. from Hong Kong 15 years ago, and he
feels he has learned some of life's important lessons.</p>
<p>"Who has more money, has the power," he says. "Money
talks."</p>
