	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- London's stock market has taken its share of
battering from the Persian Gulf crisis, but some big British
investors are keeping a stiff upper lip. Several money
managers and analysts expect that, although the market still
faces rocky times, a recovery is only a few months away.
   Betting that any fighting in the Gulf will be over quickly
and that oil prices will drop, some institutions are buying
blue chips they consider undervalued.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"There's general belief that there will be war in the
Gulf," says Alistair McLennan, senior fund manager at Norwich
Insurance Group. "There then would be a {downward} reaction
in Wall Street and a knee-jerk reaction here. But if it's
over quickly, that could lead to a very, very sharp upward
movement -- greater than 20% before the end of January."</p>
<p>Mr. McLennan says that Norwich remains fully invested, and
recently has been buying certain internationally oriented
stocks. They are shares that, he reasons, should rise if oil
prices decline and sterling, currently propped up by
Britain's oil-producing capacity, starts to weaken. (A weaker
pound makes British exports cheaper.)</p>
<p>The stocks include Grand Metropolitan, BTR, B.A.T
Industries and Imperial Chemical Industries. Norwich also has
been buying defense-oriented stocks, including General
Electric, which isn't related to the U.S. company, and GKN.
"The peace dividend has been omitted," quips Mr. McLennan.</p>
<p>At Edinburgh-based Standard Life Assurance Co., "we
haven't exactly been filling our boots, but we're still
supportive of U.K. equities," says John K. Thomson, senior
investment manager. Britain's largest mutual insurer is still
buying stocks at its pre-Gulf clip of #14 million ($26.2
million) a week, he says.</p>
<p>Adds Mr. Thomson: "Short-term, the Gulf, inflation and
worries about a recession make for a nervous market. But
long-term, the market looks cheap. Once people are convinced
that Saudi oil is secure, the market will recover. When the
market turns, you won't be able to get any money in at all."</p>
<p>Mick Brewis, who manages money at Baillie Gifford & Co.,
says the Edinburgh fund manager's cash position is double its
usual level, mainly because of U.S. share sales. He thinks
the U.K. market "is oversold" and he has been picking up
shares of Racal Telecom, the cellular-phone maker.</p>
<p>Says Mr. Brewis: "Racal is pretty cheap at the moment. A
lot of Americans have been selling the stock, but we think
its medium-term prospects are pretty good. Its product
definitely is a productivity tool -- there will be a need for
it."</p>
<p>With the British economy staggering under high inflation,
high interest rates and low growth, shares already were
sliding when Saddam Hussein blind sided world financial
markets with the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. The general view
before the crisis was that the market would turn around by
year end. The crisis has accelerated the decline and, say
many market pros, has delayed the recovery until the first
quarter of 1991, although there are some sanguine souls who
still think the snapback will come right on schedule.</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Index was in the
low 2300s just prior to the Iraqi invasion. Many in the
London market had expected the index to fall to about 2200 by
year end purely as a result of Britain's economic woes. Then
the Gulf crisis hammered shares by hyping U.K. inflation to
10.6% just when many thought the rate would peak. The FT-SE
100 closed at 2009.1, up 9.1 points yesterday. The Financial
Times 30 Share Index gained 15.5 points to 1548.1. Volume was
428.8 million shares, up from 410.3 million shares Wednesday.</p>
<p>Midsummer predictions for a year-end market turnaround
were based on the belief that Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's government would begin to loosen Britain's
stifling 15% base interest rate when inflation showed signs
of receding.</p>
<p>Money managers and analysts also thought that a rate cut
would be coupled with British entry into the European
Monetary System's exchange-rate mechanism, or ERM. Membership
would tie sterling to a narrow band with other European
currencies and act as a stabilizing force against inflation.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Thatcher this week strongly stated that Britons
shouldn't expect a rate cut soon. Still, the London market
has been buoyed in recent days by indications that Britain
may join the ERM soon, without a rate cut.</p>
<p>"You could see a 15% to 20% rise in the market on the back
of ERM entry," says Mike Young, director of European
investment strategy at Merrill Lynch. Until then, he adds,
"things remain fairly gloomy -- we're in a period of very
slow economic growth, disappointing corporate earnings, a
housing market that's in a state of collapse and where the
cost of financing inventories is enormous."</p>
<p>In the current environment, it's best to be defensive,
says Richard Kersley, U.K. equity strategist at Barclays de
Zoete Wedd. He recommends purchase of food retailer Tesco,
pharmaceuticals maker Wellcome, and Reckitt & Colman, which
is in both fields. He also favors BTR "because of its proven
record" and General Electric, which he says has "a strong
balance sheet and prudent management."</p>
<p>The wild card, of course, is the Gulf. A prolonged war
with damage to Saudi oil production facilities would raise
havoc with world stock markets and economies. "We could have
a 15% inflation rate in a year {in Britain} if oil prices
really got out of hand," says Mike Payne, senior investment
strategist at Legal & General Group, a major insurer.</p>
<p>Observes Standard Life's Mr. Thomson: "You need to be a
military strategist as well as a market strategist to try to
judge this market."</p>
<p>Elsewhere, shares yesterday ended higher in Paris, Zurich,
Helsinki, Milan, Madrid; lower in Frankfurt, Stockholm, Oslo;
and mixed in Amsterdam. South African gold stocks closed
higher.</p>
<p>And stocks closed higher in Taipei and Sydney, mixed in
Seoul, Singapore and Hong Kong, and lower in Manila and
Wellington.</p>

as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.</p>
