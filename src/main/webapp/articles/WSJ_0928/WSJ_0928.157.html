	<p class="article-leader">PAPERS: A National Labor Relations Board administrative
law judge ordered Tribune Co.'s Chicago Tribune newspaper to
sign a union contract reached with Chicago Mailers Local 2 on
July 27, 1987, and make its terms retroactive to that date.
Union officials said signing the contract under those terms
could cost the paper $10 million or more in back pay. The
company said the ruling will be appealed and declined comment
on the cost estimate.</p>
