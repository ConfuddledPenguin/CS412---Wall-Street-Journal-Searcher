	<p class="article-leader">ACTON, Mass. -- CML Group Inc. said it expects to take a
pretax charge of $24 million to $25 million in the fourth
quarter, resulting in losses for the quarter and fiscal 1990.
   The charge stems from write-downs of the Carroll Reed
division, which was sold to a Hong Kong concern last month.
As a result, the company expects to report a net loss of $13
million to $14 million for the fourth quarter ended July 31,
Charles M. Leighton, chairman and chief executive officer
said. A year earlier, CML posted a loss of $43 million, or
$6.70 a share, after write-down charges.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It is also anticipated that the direct marketer of
consumer goods will report sales of about $61 million, up 30%
from $46.8 million.</p>
<p>For the full year, CML said its net loss narrowed to $12.9
million from $31.9 million, or $4.92 a share, which includes
a loss of $26.3 million, or $4.07 a share, from discontinued
businesses. The company said it will report financial results
Monday.</p>
<p>Excluding the Carroll Reed write-down, the company expects
to post a profit from continuing operations for the year of
about $13 million, or $1.95 a share, compared with a $5.5
million, or 85 cents a share, loss from continuing operations
in fiscal 1989.</p>
<p>The company also expects to report that full-year sales
increased 19% to $278.8 million from $234.6 million.</p>
<p>Leighton attributed CML's sales growth to brisk business
at its Nature Co. and NordicTrack divisions. Fiscal 1990
sales at Nature Co., a retailer that sells telescopes, maps
and outdoor instruments, increased 39% to more than $70
million; sales at NordickTrack, a maker of home exercise
equipment, rose 16% to about $85 million.</p>
<p>Gains at Britches, the company's clothing retail-chain
division, were more modest. Hampered by a soft apparel
market, sales at its Britches stores division grew 11% to
$117 million from $105.7 million.</p>
<p>Leighton said the company whittled its long-term bank debt
$17 million in fiscal 1990 to $68 million. Part of the money
came from proceeds from the sale of its Syber Vision and
Gokeys units, the rest from company cash. In fiscal 1991, CML
plans to further reduce that debt $20 million, using money it
received from the sale of Carroll Reed, Leighton said.</p>
<p>The Carroll Reed sale was the last of CML's efforts to rid
itself of four businesses over the past fiscal year. "We've
sold off everything we want to sell, and from now on we think
our growth potential is outstanding," Leighton said.</p>
<p>Its streamlined operations, reduced inventories and debt
will help the company gear up for a lackluster economy
expected in fiscal 1991, Leighton noted.</p>
