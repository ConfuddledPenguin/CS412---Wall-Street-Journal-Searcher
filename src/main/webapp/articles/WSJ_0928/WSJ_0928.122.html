	<p class="article-leader">Harry E. Figgie Jr., chairman and chief executive officer
of Figgie International Inc., brought his son, Harry E.
Figgie III, into the company as vice chairman, with the
assignment of speeding the adoption of new technology.
   The Figgies said during a joint interview that there isn't
any understanding that the move places Dr. Figgie, who is 37
years old, in position to succeed his 66-year-old father as
chief of the diversified company the senior Mr. Figgie
founded 26 years ago.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>There has been speculation since Dr. Figgie joined the
Figgie International board in 1985 that the senior Mr. Figgie
would keep the top job in the family. However, when asked
whether he plans to retire at any given date, Mr. Figgie
responded, "Hell, no. This is an exciting time. Things I've
waited my whole career to see are happening now."</p>
<p>The senior Mr. Figgie said the Willoughby, Ohio, company
has "a five-year window of opportunity to integrate new
technology" into its divisions. "There's been a technological
revolution," in machining, welding, assembly, product design
and other functions, he said, and in some industries the
company that successfully employs the new methods first "will
own the business."</p>
<p>Figgie, which expects 1990 sales of nearly $1.4 billion,
supplies fire-protection and security systems and services;
produces sporting goods, electronics systems and industrial
products, and is involved in real estate development and
other activities.</p>
<p>Dr. Figgie, who is an orthopedic surgeon as well as a
manufacturing executive, will phase out of his medical
practice over the next 18 to 36 months to head technology and
strategic planning at Figgie. He will be a member of a new
three-member office of the chairman, which will include the
senior Mr. Figgie and Vincent A. Chiarucci, 60, the company's
president and chief operating officer.</p>
<p>The senior Mr. Figgie said those divisions serving the
construction industry have experienced a rapid drop in orders
during the current quarter. The company is cutting employment
and speeding up the previously planned consolidation of
certain units to adjust to the lower business volume, he
said. He declined to make an earnings forecast.</p>
<p>Dr. Figgie has headed Clark-Reliance Co., a family-owned
manufacturer of valves, controls and instrumentation since
1975, when he was entering Case Western University's School
of Medicine. In addition to his medical degree, Dr. Figgie
has undergraduate degrees in bio-medical engineering and
accounting and a master's degree in factory automation. He
currently is an assistant clinical professor of medicine at
Case and has a surgical practice specializing in artificial
joint replacement.</p>
<p>Dr. Figgie said he had "reached a fork in the road" where
he had to concentrate exclusively on business or medicine. He
said he chose business because he finds the application of
new manufacturing technologies exciting and challenging.</p>
