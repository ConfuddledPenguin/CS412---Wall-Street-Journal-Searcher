	<p class="article-leader">Oil companies are expected to bid vigorously for the five
million barrels of crude the government will sell in its test
of the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
   The Energy Department said it will notify about 250
potential buyers beginning today of how much and what kind of
oil will be sold from the reserve's storage system, and
officials said the department expects queries from many more
interested parties. The oil will be sold from the SPR's four
largest salt caverns, in Texas and Louisiana. The entire
system holds about 590 million barrels.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The oil will be offered in a number of large batches, each
drawing competitive bids due next Friday. Winners can take
possession of their crude in the last two weeks of October or
in November, when they will transport it either on tankers,
barges or through pipelines. "We'll bid," flatly declared
Charlie Mast, vice president of supply of Amoco Corp. in
Chicago. "We'd like to be sure it all works."</p>
<p>In fact, making sure that the system can function reliably
is the most important aspect of the test as far as
oil-company executives and many government officials are
concerned. The actual amount being sold is tiny; too little
to influence prices in the currently hyper oil market and
less than a third of a day's supply for the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>The only other time that oil has been withdrawn and sold
from the reserve was during an even smaller, million-barrel
test that began in 1985.</p>
<p>"It's an excellent idea to test the hardware and the
procedures," said Ernie W. Stamper, an administrative vice
president for the gasoline refining and marketing unit of
Ashland Oil Inc. in Ashland, Ky.</p>
<p>At a hearing of a House Energy subcommittee, Rep. John
Dingell (D., Mich.) said he has "substantial doubts" whether
the oil drawdown will proceed smoothly, fearing equipment
breakdowns and expressing concern over the type of oil to be
sold. Many industry executives also worry about a bidding
process that allows traders as well as refiners to
participate.</p>
<p>Calling the test sale "extremely important," Energy
Secretary James Watkins conceded, "I can't say it's going to
work perfectly." In fact, Mr. Watkins told lawmakers the
department would prefer a bigger test sale of 15 million
barrels that would more closely simulate the "long-term,
high-pressure, high-volume" crude drawdowns that would be
required in an emergency. Overall, he insisted however, "We
are ready to move oil." Several lawmakers began drafting
legislation that would quickly authorize a larger test.</p>
<p>SPR officials met with oil-company executives in Houston
in late August to help prepare for a simulated sale scheduled
for October. In effect, that now has been turned into the
real thing. "It has gone from paper to wet," said an Energy
Department spokesman in New Orleans.</p>
<p>Test procedures shouldn't be unfamiliar to oil companies;
during the SPR's 1985 test, oil was also sold in batches,
with 35 bidders competing for five allotments that varied in
location and chemical makeup. For instance, Phillips
Petroleum Co. successfully bid for 300,000 barrels of crude
from the Bryan Mound storage dome near Freeport, Texas, and
300,000 barrels from the Weeks Island facility in Iberia
Parish, La.</p>
<p>"We didn't have any surprises," recalled Mike Dabbar,
Phillips's manager of crude oil supply. Because of the August
meeting with the Energy Department, Mr. Dabbar said Phillips
has a good sense of the oil that might become available and
what Phillips might bid for after notices go out by overnight
delivery today.</p>
<p>Like other oil-company buyers of crude, he spent yesterday
in meetings laying bidding plans. Winning bidders will be
notified Oct. 10 and must submit financial guarantees before
Oct. 17.</p>
<p>The SPR oil will move into the hands of buyers in any of
three ways: pipeline, tanker and barge. For instance, oil
from the Bayou Choctaw salt dome near Baton Rouge, La., can
go by pipeline to a nearby dock where tankers or barges can
load it. It can also go by pipeline to nearby refineries or
into a large commercial pipeline system called Capline that
feeds Midwestern refineries. Most winning buyers will
probably use pipelines if they can because that is generally
the least expensive way to transport oil.</p>
<p>Amoco's Mr. Mast said any oil his company buys would
probably be turned into gasoline, heating oil and other
refined products at just two of its seven refineries, in
Texas City, Texas, and Whiting, Ind., because both can
receive SPR oil directly from pipelines.</p>
<p>Aside from location, the oil will also be sold based on
sulfur content. Two-thirds of SPR oil is "sour," or high in
sulfur, which makes it impractical for many refineries
because it would destroy equipment. The Energy Department
said 2.8 million barrels, or 56% of the sale, will be sour
crude.</p>
<p>A big concern of oil companies is the auction process
itself, which will allow any party to bid. To qualify, a
would-be bidder needs only to put up a certified check or
letter of credit equal to 5% of the maximum potential
contract or $10 million, whichever is less, officials told
energy executives at the August meeting.</p>
<p>Some refiners worry that traders may buy the oil and try
to sell it for a profit rather than refine it. But one crude
oil trading house said it hasn't considered participating in
the SPR sale. "We haven't even talked about it," its head
trader said.</p>
<p>At the urging of oil companies, the Energy Department
changed the pricing mechanism for SPR crude to reflect market
pricing. The highest bidder will be assured of possession,
but at a final price that will fluctuate based on a market
barometer at the time of delivery up to eight weeks later.
That way, if the market price, say, falls $10 a barrel
between the bid and delivery, the final delivery price will
be reduced by the same amount.</p>
<p>If crude prices remain at or above their current levels of
around $40 a barrel as the test sale proceeds, the government
stands to make a hefty paper profit. The average price the
U.S. paid for SPR crude is $27.22 a barrel.</p>
