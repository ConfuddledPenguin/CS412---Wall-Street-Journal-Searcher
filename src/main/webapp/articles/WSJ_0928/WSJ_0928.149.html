	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis offered to
help United Airlines' unions acquire the carrier if the
employees' current offer for United parent UAL Corp. fails.
   Gerald Greenwald, who is leading the employee buy-out
effort, rejected Mr. Davis's offer for now, saying the labor
group expects to complete the buy-out on its own. "We do not
expect any action will be taken" on the Davis offer, Mr.
Greenwald said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The buy-out group said it received an unsolicited letter
from Mr. Davis, dated Wednesday, in which he offered to
provide as much as $750 million in equity for a joint bid.
Mr. Davis proposed giving the employees a 20% interest in
UAL, with the right to buy out his position after two years.</p>
<p>Mr. Davis didn't specify a purchase price, but said he
would be willing to negotiate one with UAL's board.</p>
<p>It is unlikely UAL's unions would want to work with Mr.
Davis, even if their offer fails. United's pilots union
refused to join him in a bid last year because he insisted on
majority control of the company. The unions have continued to
discourage other potential equity investors who sought
control as the price of their involvement.</p>
<p>By raising the possiblity that Mr. Davis might return, the
unions may be trying to shore up support for the employee
effort within their own ranks. Earlier this week, the pilots
union accused UAL management and chairman Stephen M. Wolf of
trying to foment dissent.</p>
<p>Indeed, in their latest letter to UAL pilots, union
leaders warned that "raiders remain a threat" and
specifically singled out Mr. Davis. "Only employee
ownership," the union cautioned, "would end the threat of
raiders."</p>
<p>UAL's three principal unions are working on an offer of
$175 a share for 85% of UAL's stock after failing to obtain
financing for the $201-a-share, $4.38 billion offer the board
accepted last April. Some traders value the latest offer at
only about $160 a share, or $3.49 billion.</p>
<p>The unions have until Oct. 9 to present the board with a
financed offer. It is still unclear whether the board will
accept a lower bid or whether this bid can gain bank
financing. Mr. Davis said his offer of help stands if the
unions fail to get the financing, or if the board rejects
their latest offer.</p>
