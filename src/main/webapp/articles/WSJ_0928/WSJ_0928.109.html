	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Japan's space program, like its U.S. counterpart,
is struggling with a series of embarrassing setbacks.
   The National Space Development Agency said Thursday that
the engine for its H-2 rocket, the centerpiece of Japan's
space effort for the 1990s, caught fire Wednesday during
tests at the Tanegashima Space Center off the southern tip of
Japan. It was the fourth test fire in the past year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A spokesman said the agency was discussing whether to
delay yet again the first voyage of the H-2, which is slated
for early 1993. That date was set last year after previous
glitches forced a one-year lapse from the original target
date of early 1992. The rocket is also already running 10%
over its original 200 billion yen ($1.46 billion) budget.</p>
<p>Japan's space program lags years behind those of other
industrialized nations, and the H-2 is its first 100%
domestically made rocket. The H-2 is also supposed to launch
a variety of other Japanese space projects, such as
satellites and an unmanned space shuttle.</p>
<p>Delays in the H-2 could force the embarrassing choice of
either pushing those projects back further or seeking foreign
assistance. Analysts have said Japan is also hoping the H-2
ultimately will compete with organizations like Europe's
Arianespace for commercial launches.</p>
<p>Japanese engine makers, led by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
Ltd., are struggling in part because this is their first
attempt to build an engine for the first stage of a rocket,
which is the heaviest phase and carries the most fuel.</p>
<p>This is also their first cryogenic engine, a complex
technology that runs on liquid hydrogen. It has more power
for its size and runs at higher temperatures than traditional
engines fueled by petroleum.</p>
<p>The previous major test problems were the result of
difficulties with the turbine blade, which cracked, or with
the starting mechanism, the spokesman said. He added that
those problems had been solved.</p>
<p>But the fire this week, which started in the engine's
turbo pump, apparently had a different cause, the spokesman
said, and the agency is conducting tests.</p>
<p>Last Saturday, the engine had its most successful test so
far, running for 200 seconds. The space agency was aiming for
350 seconds on Wednesday. But 16 seconds after ignition, the
fire started, damaging the engine and the test facility
before it was put out more than 15 minutes later.</p>
