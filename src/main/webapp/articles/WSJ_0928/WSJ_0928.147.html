	<p class="article-leader">Ing. C. Olivetti & Co. of Italy, an office automation
equipment maker, reported that first-half consolidated pretax
profit fell 41% to 60.9 billion lire ($51.9 million) from
102.6 billion lire a year earlier, continuing a 3 1/2-year
earnings slide.
   Operating profit fell 35% to 102.1 billion lire from 156.4
billion lire.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Revenue rose 5.8% to 4.167 trillion lire from 3.938
trillion lire.</p>
<p>Carlo De Benedetti, chairman and the controlling
shareholder, blamed the earnings drop on tough market
conditions, a continuing squeeze in profit margins and an
unfavorable exchange rate for the lira. But the company
claimed it fared much better than most of its European and
U.S. competitors, and predicted it will continue to outpace
other computer makers for the rest of the year, though it
didn't give a specific earnings forecast.</p>
