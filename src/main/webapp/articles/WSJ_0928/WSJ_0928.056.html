	<p class="article-leader">Dorrance "Dodo" Hamilton, the only director of Campbell
Soup Co. to have pushed publicly for a sale of the troubled
company, quit the board abruptly "for personal reasons."
   Her departure and other fresh developments appear likely
to reduce tensions among Dorrance family members, who
together own about 59% of Campbell's stock. The events also
dim the prospects for a takeover of Campbell, which has been
the target of Wall Street speculators ever since former
chairman John T. Dorrance Jr. died in April 1989.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Today, Charles Norris Jr., another dissident, is expected
to disclose in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission that he is resigning as a trustee of the dissident
group's block of Campbell shares, which constitutes a
combined 17.4% stake. Mr. Norris, husband of Mr. Dorrance's
niece Diana, is stepping down because of continuing marital
problems, according to family associates.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hamilton, 62 years old, is a granddaughter of the
company's founder, and controls about 7% of Campbell's stock.
Her husband, Samuel, has been ill with emphysema for some
time.</p>
<p>"She has been on the board for more than 10 years, and she
basically feels she's had enough," said a person close to
Mrs. Hamilton. The dissident group includes Mrs. Hamilton's
sister, Hope van Beuren, and her husband, as well as Mr.
Hamilton and the Norrises.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hamilton's departure, effective next Monday, is a
symbolic blow to dissidents. Her seat will be filled by
Charles H. Mott, investment adviser to the van Beurens and
chief executive of John W. Bristol & Co., a New York-based
investment management firm. Mr. Mott also is expected to be
named a trustee of the dissident stake, along with Mrs.
Hamilton.</p>
<p>Her quitting the Campbell board "has to be viewed as a
modest negative for the takeover story," said John McMillin,
a food industry analyst for Prudential Bache Securities. "She
was the true flag waver among the dissidents, but she's no
longer in the right frame of mind to fight."</p>
<p>But a spokesman for the dissidents said the fight would
continue through Mr. Mott. "The group feels that Mott will be
an effective advocate for the group's interests," the
spokesman said. "The position hasn't changed. It's just going
to be represented on the board by a professional money
manager."</p>
<p>Campbell also announced the retirement of another
director, William S. Cashel Jr., the 70-year-old former
chairman of the company, who had an uneasy relationship with
some of the Dorrances for several years. Mr. Cashel's seat on
the 16-member board will be filled by Edmund M. Carpenter,
48, chairman and chief executive of General Signal Corp.,
based in Stamford, Conn.</p>
<p>The confluence of these developments buys time for David
W. Johnson, Campbell's president and chief executive, who was
hired away from Gerber Products Co. in January to improve
Campbell's mediocre financial performance. Mr. Johnson has
vowed to keep the Camden, N.J., food company independent,
backed by the late Mr. Dorrance's three children and their
cousin George Strawbridge Jr.</p>
<p>But Mr. Johnson may never preside over peace among the
Dorrances. A spokesman for the dissidents said they still
favor the ultimate sale of Campbell, despite their current
support of Mr. Johnson. And in another twist, the ill health
of Mr. Strawbridge, a family conciliator, may weaken the
prospects for a lasting harmony.</p>
<p>Mr. Strawbridge, who was recently diagnosed with
intestinal cancer, is recovering from surgery at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. Although his
prognosis is good, says a Campbell spokesman, Mr. Strawbridge
is still undergoing chemotherapy and is unlikely to play an
active role in company affairs for some time.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Campbell shares closed unchanged at $45.375.</p>
