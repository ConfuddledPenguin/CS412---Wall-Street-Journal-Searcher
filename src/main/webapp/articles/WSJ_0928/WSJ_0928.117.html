	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- U.S. counterterrorism and intelligence
experts are combing the details of a break-in at the Brussels
home of an American general to see if it was a terrorist
attack connected in any way with Iraq.
   The incident, believed to have been an attempt at murder
or kidnapping, was aimed at Gen. John Douglass, who works on
the military committee at North Atlantic Treaty Organization
headquarters. Gen. Douglass wasn't home, so the attack
failed. No group has publicly claimed responsibility for the
raid Tuesday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Recently, U.S. intelligence has spotted agents of several
Arab terror groups with links to Iraq conducting surveillance
in Europe at American military installations. No attacks have
resulted from the surveillance, but the Bush administration
has warned Baghdad it will hold Iraq responsible for
terrorist attacks that occur during the Gulf crisis.</p>
<p>In the Brussels incident, several men broke into Gen.
Douglass's house and knocked out his aide, while confederates
waited outside. The dazed aide, who said he was also drugged
by the attackers, has been unable so far to provide a full,
detailed account of the incident.</p>
