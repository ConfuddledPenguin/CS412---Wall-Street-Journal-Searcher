	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Car sales in Europe fell 3.4% to about 1,110,000
in August from 1,149,000 million a year earlier, largely
because of sluggish British demand, but rose 16% from 959,722
in July.
   The industry statistics are based on new-car registrations
in 12 countries that normally account for 94% of sales from
Western Europe. Analysts were reluctant to draw many
conclusions from August and its implications for the year
because of seasonal distortions in Britain. But they
generally stuck with earlier predictions that 1990 car sales
will range from unchanged to down 2% from 12.6 million units
in 1989.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In Britain, August sales surged more than eightfold to
432,867 from July, and though the total represented the
third-highest for the country, it was still down 13% from the
year-earlier record 500,112. Britain usually has a big
seasonal upswing in auto sales in August, as consumers there
try to buy cars at the start of the auto registration year.</p>
<p>Had Britain's car sales been excluded from the
year-to-year total, European sales in August would have risen
4.3%.</p>
<p>Also, August sales in Italy and France usually decline
from the previous month, as consumer interest fades at the
height of the summer holidays.</p>
<p>"Of any one month of the year, August is the one you have
to be most careful about," as part of the measurement for the
year's trend, said Gavin Launder, a European car analyst at
Kleinwort Benson Securities Ltd.</p>
<p>Analysts said the August data weren't influenced by the
rise in crude oil prices springing from the Persian Gulf
crisis. This effect might not be felt in the car market until
next year, Mr. Launder said, though production plans might be
reduced in this year's fourth quarter to prepare for an
economic downturn, owing to the oil factor.</p>
<p>The West German market, where August sales climbed 16% to
224,088 cars from a year earlier, continues to be
"exceptionally strong," said Philip Ayton, European car
analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd. Recently released East
German savings continue to be sunk into the West German car
market, analysts said.</p>
<p>Analysts also said France is among the main markets
bucking the trend and showing strength in the face of what
they expect will be a dismal year overall in Europe. French
sales continue to be helped by a reduction in taxes on new
cars. In the past three years, France has reduced taxes on
consumer goods to 22% from 28%; the latest cut took effect
this month. The tax cuts brighten the outlook for sales for
the rest of this year, analysts said. France's August sales
rose 3.6% to 178,500 from a year earlier but fell 22% from
July.</p>
