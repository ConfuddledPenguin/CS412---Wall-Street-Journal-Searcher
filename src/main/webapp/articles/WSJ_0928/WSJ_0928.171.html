	<p class="article-leader">REDMOND, Wash. -- Data I/O Corp. said it expects to report
lower-than-anticipated third-quarter sales.
   The electronics company said it expects sales in the
quarter ended Sept. 28 to be $12.5 million to $13.5 million,
about $1.5 million to $2 million less than analysts expected.
Net income in the quarter will about break even, Data I/O
said. The company blamed the sales shortfall on
longer-than-expected production times of certain products.</p>
