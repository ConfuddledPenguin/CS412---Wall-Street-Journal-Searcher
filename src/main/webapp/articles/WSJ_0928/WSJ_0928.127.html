	<p class="article-leader">Consolidated pretax profit at Fiat S.p.A. fell almost 13%
in the first half, reflecting increased competition in its
home market and weakening demand for new cars in Europe
generally.
   The Italian car maker forecast a tough second half, saying
the Gulf crisis, higher inflation and the country's
continuing budgetary problems were likely to hurt business.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Consolidated pretax profit fell to 2.45 trillion lire
($2.09 billion) in the first half from 2.81 trillion lire in
the same period of 1989, while consolidated net revenue rose
to 30.31 trillion lire from 27.11 trillion.</p>
<p>Fiat's market share in Italy fell to 54% in the first six
months from 58% a year earlier. Fiat has encountered strong
competition on its own turf from Ford Motor Co., which has
doubled its market share in Italy to 7% this year following a
strong marketing campaign for its new-style Fiesta model,
which competes head-on with Fiat's top-selling Uno.</p>
<p>In the wider European market, Fiat's sales rose to
1,080,000 vehicles in the first half from 1,040,000 vehicles
a year earlier, but its market share slipped to 15% from
15.5%.</p>
<p>Another factor in the fall in the group's profitability
was heavy losses by Fiat's Brazilian subsidiaries, totaling
more than 300 billion lire.</p>
