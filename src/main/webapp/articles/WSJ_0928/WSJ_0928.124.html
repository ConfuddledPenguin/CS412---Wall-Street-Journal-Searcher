	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The stock market retreated again as crude oil
prices surged as high as $40 a barrel.
   An early softening in the price of oil had fueled hopes
for a rally in stocks. But an opening burst of stock buying
proved briefer than many investors expected.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>After advancing more than 22 points in the first 10
minutes of trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average quickly
headed lower. The index hit a 50-point loss shortly after
noon EDT, triggering the New York Stock Exchange's "uptick
rule" restricting computer-driven program selling.</p>
<p>The industrial average ended with a 32.17-point loss at
2427.48, a new low for the year. Standard & Poor's 500-Stock
Index dropped 4.09 to 300.97, and the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Index fell 2.16 to 165.36.</p>
<p>Declining stocks totaled 1,182 and advancing issues 395.</p>
<p>"This morning was a classic bear trap," sucking investors
in on false hopes, said James C. Andrews, first vice
president in charge of institutional trading at Janney
Montgomery Scott.</p>
<p>Those hopes were pinned on falling oil prices, which were
expected to open as much as $1 a barrel lower in New York
trading. Oil prices had declined sharply in European trading
after President Bush announced late Wednesday that he would
release five million barrels of oil from the nation's
strategic petroleum reserves.</p>
<p>But light sweet crude oil for November delivery opened
only about 87 cents a barrel lower on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, and soon recovered to surge past Wednesday's
closing levels -- moving briefly above $40 a barrel. The
spike in oil prices drove stock prices to their lows for the
day. By the end of the day, the November crude oil contract
had settled to $39.54 a barrel, up 87 cents from Wednesday.</p>
<p>Big Board volume totaled 182,690,000 shares, up from
Wednesday's 155,570,000.</p>
<p>Bank stocks led the decline in what Ralph Bloch, chief
market analyst at Raymond James & Associates, called
quarterend "window undressing."</p>
<p>So-called window dressing has often been cited as a cause
for gains in stock prices at the end of previous quarters as
portfolio managers bought winning stocks to enhance their
portfolios before the quarter-end review.</p>
<p>Mr. Bloch said portfolio managers may be dumping the worst
performers now -- primarily the bank stocks -- to get them
off the books before the quarter ends.</p>
<p>But there were plenty of other reasons to sell bank shares
yesterday.</p>
<p>NCNB dropped 3 1/8 to 20 1/8 after announcing late
Wednesday that it is increasing its loan and lease loss
allowance by $65 million. The increased provision will slash
the bank holding company's third-quarter profit to between 50
cents and 60 cents a share, down from $1.45 a share in the
like quarter last year.</p>
<p>Bank of Boston said its third-quarter loss would total
between $200 million and $250 million, including the addition
of $150 million to $200 million to its loan-loss provisions.
The bank, whose stock dropped 3/8 to 7 1/8, also cut its
dividend to 10 cents a share from 31 cents.</p>
<p>Landmark Bancshares fell 1 to 7 after it said its
third-quarter earnings would fall to as little as 12 cents a
share from 51 cents a share a year ago.</p>
<p>Other bank stocks were also down. Citicorp led the
most-active list with a 3/4point loss to 13 3/4. Wells Fargo
lost 3 5/8 to 42 3/4, Chase Manhattan eased 1/8 to 11,
Chemical Banking lost 7/8 to 14 1/8, BankAmerica dropped 3/4
to 19 1/4, and Security Pacific lost 1 1/2 to 19 1/2.</p>
<p>Market players have been saying all week that the stock
market is due for a technical bounce. And while the market's
inability to support a 22-point advance by the Dow
industrials yesterday morning discouraged some, others are
still saying the bottom is near.</p>
<p>"At some point the market will have largely discounted a
war," as well as a recession, said Oppenheimer market
strategist Michael Metz. "At that point {the market} will
turn." Mr. Metz believes the market is just about there.</p>
<p>The stock market wasn't without its winners yesterday.
Among the 30 Dow industrials, PepsiCo added 1/8 to 22 1/8,
while Procter & Gamble rose 1/4 to 72 3/8.</p>
<p>Union Carbide added 5/8 to 14 7/8. The company's board
authorized a series of initiatives designed to enhance value
for stockholders and strengthen its businesses. The moves
include the repurchase of about 14% of its shares outstanding
through a "Dutch auction" tender offer.</p>
<p>MCA, which jumped more than 25 points in the previous two
sessions on expectations of an acquisition agreement with
Matsushita Electric, retreated 2 1/4 to 59 in heavy trading.</p>
<p>General Electric lost 3 3/8 to 51 5/8. A federal ruling in
June removed limitations on the damages for which GE is
liable under a 1971 contract with Washington Public Power
Supply System. The ruling, which was unsealed Tuesday, found
that GE had hidden serious doubts about its design of a giant
nuclear-containment vessel for a WPPSS power plant. A trial
this summer brought by WPPSS against GE ended in a mistrial.
WPPSS has requested a new trial without a jury on the issue
of GE's liability in the case.</p>
<p>USAir tumbled 7/8 to 15 1/8. The airline operator said
late Wednesday that it is suspending its quarterly dividend
indefinitely and deferring delivery of 16 new Boeing jets for
several years. Boeing fell 1 1/4 to 39 5/8.</p>
<p>Unisys lost 1 5/8, to 5 3/8. The company suspended its
dividend and said it expects to report a loss in the current
third quarter. Unisys lost $4.25 a share in the third quarter
last year, including the effect of restructuring charges.</p>
<p>Whitman added 1/2 to 18 3/4 on heavy volume. Goldman Sachs
made positive comments about the stock yesterday. The
Chicago-based company has announced a restructuring program
to transform itself into an operating company focused on
foods and soft drinks, from a diversified holding company.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index slid 4.63
to 305.43. Volume totaled 16,780,000 shares.</p>
