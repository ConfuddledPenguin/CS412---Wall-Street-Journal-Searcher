	<p class="article-leader">U.S. OFFICIALS FEAR growing calls for a deal with Iraq.
   They believe Mitterrand's U.N. proposal is only the first
of many calls for negotiations with Saddam Hussein --
possibly trading withdrawal from Kuwait for access to a
Kuwaiti island in the Gulf, greater control of a rich border
oil field, and forgiveness of Iraq's $10 billion debt to
Kuwait.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Iraq probably could have had such an accord without
invading and bringing world opprobrium down on itself. But
the U.S. remains adamantly opposed to granting even symbolic
concessions, saying it could accept Iraq-Kuwait talks on
these issues only after an unconditional withdrawal.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, officials privately worry that Kuwait's exiled
emir might cut a secret deal with Iraq, offering concessions
himself in return for restoration of his government.</p>
<p>POLITICAL PRESSURES keep building on Bush as energy prices
rise. While officials hope the decision to tap the strategic
reserve will damp psychological pressures pushing prices up,
lawmakers criticize the White House refusal to take
additional measures. Democratic Sen. Lieberman calls for
prohibiting companies from charging "excessive prices" during
emergencies. GOP Sen. Packwood urges readoption of the
windfall-profits tax.</p>
<p>Administration officials fear an abnormally cold winter or
a major refinery accident could send prices -- and political
pressure -- spiraling anew. Even as Bush jawbones oil
companies to keep prices down, Energy Department officials
complain there's nothing they can do to prevent the firms
from exporting gasoline and heating oil to Europe, where
prices are higher.</p>
<p>WHOSE RECESSION? Officials seek a scapegoat in Greenspan.</p>
<p>Bush aides continue to mute their criticism of the Fed
chairman in public, fearing that too much recession talk will
alarm consumers and further weaken the economy. But they step
up behind-the-scenes criticism of the Fed's reluctance to
lower interest rates in the face of worsening indicators.</p>
<p>Many business economists share that view. Nearly 60% in a
recent survey say the Fed is being too stingy; normally, 60%
to 70% of the economists endorse whatever policy the Fed is
following. But Greenspan defenders warn the Fed can't offset
the damage that higher oil prices are doing.</p>
<p>Despite its impatience with the Fed, the administration is
nowhere near choosing a replacement for Vice Chairman Manuel
Johnson, who quit almost four months ago.</p>
<p>OFFICIALS DISMISS private suggestions from Syrian dictator
Assad that an Iraqi coup is possible soon; they say Saddam
Hussein's network of informers and habit of killing rather
than exiling foes make a successful plot unlikely. But the
administration, as well as Turkey's Ozal, say a coup might
occur if war breaks out.</p>
<p>HONORARIUM HONEYMOON: Disclosure forms show that the day
after Illinois Rep. and GOP Senate candidate Lynn Martin was
married in 1987, she and her husband, a judge, traveled to
Orlando, where she pocketed $2,000 plus expenses for a
speech. Next they headed for Jamaica, where she attended a
five-day expenses-paid seminar, after which she went alone to
San Diego for another $2,000 speech. Her spokesman attributes
the busy schedule to the press of being a two-career couple.</p>
<p>CLOSING IN: Massachusetts GOP Senate challenger Jim
Rappaport stalks Sen. Kerry by reminding voters Kerry served
for two years as lieutenant governor to the wildly unpopular
Dukakis. Rappaport's latest ad shows a photo of Dukakis that
slowly dissolves into one of Kerry. "He's back," says the
voice-over. The music is reminiscent of "Jaws."</p>
<p>TRADE HARD-LINERS in Congress line up to help push "Agents
of Influence," a new book about Japan's $350-million-a-year
U.S. lobbying operation. Hosts of a Capitol book party for
author Pat Choate included Heinz, Hollings and Gephardt.</p>
<p>THE SLEAZE SWEEPSTAKES focuses on ethics complaints, money
givebacks.</p>
<p>The House Democratic campaign committee -- itself
criticized in the past for fund raising on the yachts of S&L
kingpins -- files an S&L-related ethics committee complaint
against Oregon GOP Rep. Denny Smith. It also complains about
a loan to the GOP challenger to California Rep. George Brown.
Republicans counter with a complaint against Sen. Simon.</p>
<p>Under pressure from his GOP opponent, Sen. Heflin returns
$2,000 to a PAC controlled by Sen. Cranston, one of the
Keating Five. GOP Rep. Pashayan, who has already returned
$26,000 in Keating-related contributions, gives back $1,000
from a Washington lobbyist who represented Iraq. In New
Hampshire, ex-Sen. Durkin hammers GOP candidate Bob Smith for
$31,000 in oil-industry contributions.</p>
<p>The links get ever-more tenuous: Sen. Levin gives back a
donation from the PAC of a New York law firm that once
represented Charles Keating.</p>
<p>MINOR MEMOS: Quayle says he supports efforts "to limit the
terms of members of Congress, especially members of the House
and members of the Senate." . . . No limousine liberal,
former top Mondale aide and new Fannie Mae Chairman Jim
Johnson is spotted riding a school bus with his four-year-old
son. . . . Some House members, frustrated because they aren't
involved in either the Iraqi crisis or the budget talks, form
a Potted Palm Caucus.</p>
