	<p class="article-leader">Going easy on the gas pedal now that it takes a twenty
dollar bill to fill up your Toyota? What would you do if you
were buying the fuel for a DC-10?
   The answer, the nation's airlines say, is just about
everything imaginable. Since one of those jumbo jets averages
less than half a mile a gallon, your bill for a jaunt from
New York to Los Angeles would be somewhere around seven
grand.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For starters, you'd probably do what you do in your car --
spare the throttle, coast a lot, cut engine idling time and
avoid unnecessary miles. But there are many more tricks than
that, airlines say, from intentionally enduring bumpy rides
and foregoing early arrivals to keeping the outside of
aircraft paint-free. And these days, they're all being used
-- including at least one trick, carrying less fuel, that
makes some industry people nervous.</p>
<p>Jet fuel is the second-biggest day-to-day expense for most
airlines, behind labor. AMR Corp.'s American Airlines, the
nation's largest carrier, burns 2.5 billion gallons each
year. So the 65% price jump since the Middle East crisis
began on Aug. 2 has raised its annual fuel bill by about $875
million.</p>
<p>Cost increases like that, coupled with softening travel,
have the industry headed for a record $1 billion loss this
year, analysts say. To cope, carriers are cutting employment,
reducing schedules, raising fares -- and pinching pennies on
fuel.</p>
<p>American Airlines recently sent its cockpit crews and
dispatchers a detailed, 13-point bulletin on conserving fuel,
"the lifeblood of our operation." Says William Syblon, a
pilot and American's flight operations technical manager:
"We've redoubled our efforts. . . . It is a very critical
issue." Similarly, Pan American World Airways has
"rejuvenated" its fuel-saving program. "It's worth a
considerable amount of money," says chief pilot Norm Davies.
The Pan Am Corp. unit may even dump some of its biggest,
least-economical jets altogether.</p>
<p>While airlines have been fuel-conscious since the first
energy crunch in the 1970s, "it's more important now," agrees
Donald J. Breeding, Continental Airlines' senior vice
president of operations. "We're looking at a potential
downturn next year and at the same time an increase in fuel
expense," he says.</p>
<p>Continental pays quarterly bonuses to pilots and other
employees for cutting fuel costs. The program dates to the
mid-1980s, but it's being pushed anew. "We're trying to make
our people more sensitive," Mr. Breeding says. The carrier
splits its savings with 4,000 eligible employees. Last year,
when the plan yielded $20 million, captains got $4,500 each.
This year's pool is likely to be much higher.</p>
<p>Basically, airlines are re-examining anything that uses
fuel. Among American's recommendations to pilots: Cruise at
the optimum altitude suggested by the plane's on-board
performance computer, even if passengers must endure "some
degree of light chop."</p>
<p>That means a pilot might not opt for the smoothest ride
anymore if a slightly bumpier one is more fuel-efficient,
says Mr. Syblon. Planes burn less fuel at higher levels
because the air is thinner. So now, "if it's not too choppy,
we encourage pilots to stay there and save fuel," he says.</p>
<p>The payoff would seem hardly worth the bother at first. A
Boeing 757 flying at 35,000 feet on a transcontinental trip
might save 200 gallons -- about $200 -- by moving up to its
optimum altitude, 39,000 feet. But "if you could do it every
day on thousands of trips, it's pretty easy to see why you
would," Mr. Syblon says. Indeed, if American Airlines could
save $200 on each of its 2,300 daily flights, it would
recover some $460,000 a day, or more than 20% of the increase
in its fuel bill.</p>
<p>Besides encouraging pilots to fly high, airlines are
admonishing them to fly straight. The most direct route can
shave two to three minutes off a two-hour flight, and as much
as 10 minutes off a five-hour one, says Mr. Syblon. In 10
minutes, a 757 burns $180 worth of fuel.</p>
<p>On the other hand, deciding how fast to fly gets tricky.
After takeoff, it may pay to hit the throttles harder than
usual to reach a money-saving cruising altitude as soon as
possible. Once there, however, a lighter touch than usual
might be in order.</p>
<p>Pan Am encourages pilots running ahead of schedule on
long-distance routes to back off rather than to arrive at
their destinations early. Slowing a Rome-to-New York flight
by 14 miles an hour, for example, can save $368 -- though it
makes the trip 14 minutes longer.</p>
<p>American Airlines urges its pilots to ask air controllers
for permission to slow down rather than to change course when
maneuvering into line for landing at busy airports. Changing
course burns more fuel by adding distance.</p>
<p>But there's such a thing as being too poky. Pan Am says
slowing a flight beyond its allotted time could trigger
overtime pay for crews, wiping out any fuel saving. "In
general, you save fuel if you fly slower, but time costs
money, so we try to seek a balance," agrees American's Mr.
Syblon.</p>
<p>And sometimes, slowing down isn't feasible. "The area
where we are going to save more fuel is in a well-planned
descent," Mr. Breeding says. In the perfect descent, the
plane glides down from its cruising altitude with the engines
at idle. But controllers can order pilots to kick in the
power and speed up because traffic may be stacking up behind
them.</p>
<p>While skillful flying saves money, there may be even more
to be made on the ground. Some tricks are obvious: Use
electricity from the terminal to run lights and air
conditioning while at the gate; delay engine start-up until
the last minute and taxi on only one engine.</p>
<p>Some are not so obvious: Mesa Airlines, a 38-plane
regional carrier, hired 14 tanker trucks last month to haul
120,000 gallons of jet fuel 450 miles from Denver to its
Albuquerque, N.M., hub because it discovered fuel was much
cheaper in Denver. Mesa came out 10 cents a gallon ahead even
after trucking costs, says Vice President Jonathan Ornstein.</p>
<p>Some tactics are controversial. Carriers are taking a hard
look at the amount of fuel loaded into planes. Crews don't
simply fill up each trip. Extra fuel makes a plane heavier,
which in turn makes it burn more fuel. American Airlines
calculates that a plane constantly carrying around an
unnecessary 1,000 pounds of fuel-just under 150 gallons-would
boost its costs by $15,045 a year.</p>
<p>Currently, most airlines load enough fuel to fly a given
route, plus a safety allowance required by federal
regulations, plus an additional cushion beyond that. The idea
of scrimping on that cushion bothers the Air Line Pilots
Association, the union representing most airline pilots.</p>
<p>Cutting back "shrinks somewhat the safety buffer that we
have built into the airline business," an ALPA spokesman
worries. He concedes carrying a bit less probably wouldn't by
itself cause an accident, but he contends it might complicate
other problems that could arise. "You always want to maximize
the safety buffer," he says.</p>
<p>Airlines insist they don't take any fuel-saving steps
without first weighing safety. "There will be no instances in
which Delta will compromise safety. That's our No. 1
priority," declares a Delta Air Lines spokesman. At
Continental, Mr. Breeding says, "That's the first question we
ask ourselves: `Is it safe?' If the answer is no, we drop it
right there."</p>
<p>Weight-watching extends way beyond fuel loads. American
Airlines seems to have its planes on a constant diet. A few
years ago, it took 1,500 pounds off each of its Boeing 727s
by making seats lighter, changing metal food carts to
reinforced plastic and redesigning the structure of the
galley. It has even calculated the relative efficiency of
painted and unpainted planes -- and opted for no paint except
red, white and blue stripes. An unpainted DC-10 is about 400
pounds lighter and about $12,000 a year cheaper to fly,
American Airlines says.</p>
<p>It pays to be flexible on weight matters, however. Pan Am
has at times recently pumped an extra 5,400 gallons of fuel
into planes leaving Los Angeles for Washington, because the
California fuel was 22 cents a gallon cheaper. Even with the
extra weight, the airline came out $387 ahead each flight.
"It's the same concept as if you drove to New Jersey and
filled up there and then drove back to Manhattan," a
spokesman says.</p>
