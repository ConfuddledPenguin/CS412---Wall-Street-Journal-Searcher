	<p class="article-leader">Gannett Co.'s first foray into the sale of cross-media
packages -- offering advertisers the chance to tap
simultaneously into its vast newspaper, television, radio and
billboard properties -- was a colossal failure in 1984.
   But now, five years after Gannett pulled the plug on the
plan, the media giant is gearing up to make another run at
the business. It has set up a task force to study the idea
and says it wants to have "a few" advertisers try the
cross-media program in 1991.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It was really an idea before its time," says Cathleen
Black, publisher of USA Today and executive vice president of
marketing at Gannett. "But we've had some internal
discussions, and we think it's time again to rethink this."</p>
<p>But Gannett's idea isn't unique anymore, and it may find
that the market is already glutted with media companies that
have recently gotten into the cross-media ad package
business. Earlier this week, Washington Post Co.'s Newsweek
and Times Mirror Corp. announced a multimedia ad package.
Time Warner Inc., with its diverse interests from publishing
to cable TV, is also testing the waters, as is Hearst Corp.,
which owns magazines and the Lifetime cable network. Meredith
Corp. offers cross-media ad deals, too.</p>
<p>Gannett, though, says its programs will be different
because its regional media outlets would allow advertisers to
target their messages at very narrow local segments.
Advertisers that sign up could tap its 10 TV stations, 15
radio stations, 83 newspapers, USA Today and its outdoor
billboard network. Ms. Black says the company might even link
with non-Gannett media, such as a magazine or in-store media,
if an advertiser wanted that.</p>
<p>Still, some ad agency media directors aren't sure how big
a market there is for such deals. They warn that the programs
may appeal only to a very small group of big-spending
advertisers. And there are other concerns: "Media companies
have difficulty because they don't understand the needs of
the clients," says John Belfiore, senior vice president of
media planning services at ad agency BBDO.</p>
<p>Gannett acknowledges that it stumbled the first time
because it forced advertisers to select from rigid ad
packages that Gannett itself created. One package, for
example, might have offered billboard and radio ads -- but
not TV. Now Gannett is demonstrating a flexibility common to
more and more media companies these days. Programs now will
be created one-on-one with advertisers, Gannett says.</p>
<p>Ms. Black says Gannett decided to give the program a
second try in part because of interest from advertisers,
which said their marketing departments were facing cuts. The
advertisers, she says, were looking to Gannett and other
media companies not just for ad pages, but for marketing
advice.</p>
<p>"We do know that the easier you make it for them, the
better your chance of selling a program," Ms. Black says. "In
this day and age, the closer you are to your customer's
thinking, the better off you will be in creating ideas and
programs that match their objectives."</p>
<p>While Ms. Black touts the benefits of such packages, she
warns that advertisers who sign up won't get the big volume
discount some other programs offer. The program was primarily
developed, she says, to "get incremental dollars for
Gannett."</p>
<p>Although they're taking a wait-and-see approach, some
media directors at ad agencies say corporate advertisers,
particulary the big spenders, might be interested in looking
into the packages if media companies can convince them that
they have the know-how to offer individualized, tailored
service.</p>
<p>"The kinds of group deals or buys that were offered in the
past weren't flexible enough, and as a result, there wasn't
much business that grew out of them," says Rich Hamilton,
senior vice president at D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles. "The
media companies are recognizing the need to be more flexibile
. . . and that's a positive thing," he says.</p>

<p>Alaska Launches Ad Blitz</p>
<p>Do you think Alaska's shoreline is still awash in oil? The
Alaska Visitors Association, using $7 million from Exxon, is
mounting a TV ad blitz to convince you otherwise.</p>
<p>The 30-second spots, which will run about 60 times a week
for four weeks, broke yesterday in 35 major markets. Each of
the three spots features new footage of Prince William Sound
-- and its mammal and marine life -- with no visible effects
from the Exxon Valdez spill last year. A typical line: "The
sapphire of Prince William Sound nearly recovered from the
spill."</p>
<p>"Our research showed there is a substantial misperception
about the effects of the spill," says Robert Dindinger,
president of the 600-member trade association. "Nobody is
going to come to Alaska and see dead animals on the beach."</p>
<p>Mr. Dindinger said the number of tourists visiting Alaska
has actually risen slightly since the spill. But that growth,
at an annual rate of 2% to 3%, is a far cry from the
double-digit growth the state had seen in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Exxon, whose funding was termed voluntary by both parties,
shared creative control of the commercials. The oil company
"will benefit by dispelling misperceptions about conditions
in Prince William Sound," an Exxon spokesman said.</p>

<p>Ad Notes. . . .</p>
<p>AMTRAK: Amtrak will allow advertising on its ticket
jackets under an agreement reached with Devon Direct
Marketing & Advertising, Malvern, Pa. With an annual
ridership of about 21 million, the rail carrier will offer
six million ticket jackets for advertising. Most major
airlines carry such ads.</p>
<p>GERBER ACCOUNT: Gerber Products, Fremont, Mich., retained
TBWA Advertising, New York, to handle the launch of its new
Gerber Graduates food line for preschool children. Billings
haven't been determined, but the account eventually could be
valued at as much as $10 million. The Chicago office of J.
Walter Thompson, a WPP Group unit, continues to handle
Gerber's core baby-food business.</p>
