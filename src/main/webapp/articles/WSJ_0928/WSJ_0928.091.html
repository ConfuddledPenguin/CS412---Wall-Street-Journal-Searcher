	<p class="article-leader">BIRMINGHAM, Ala. -- In 1981, Lemmie Ruffin sold an
insurance policy to Cleopatra Haslip's employer. Now, that
simple transaction has led the Supreme Court to confront one
of the most critical legal issues involving American
business: whether the Constitution requires limits on
punitive damages.
   On one side is Mr. Ruffin's former employer, Pacific
Mutual Life Insurance Co., located in stylish Newport Beach,
Calif., with $1.58 billion in premiums last year. On the
other is 59-year-old Mrs. Haslip, the former $8,800-a-year
librarian for Roosevelt City, a poor, largely black suburb in
the old steel mill region west of here.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In 1982, only months after the insurance policy was
purchased, Mrs. Haslip found herself with a kidney infection
-- and uninsured for $3,500 in medical bills. In a lawsuit
charging that Mr. Ruffin, as a Pacific Mutual agent, had
defrauded her and three co-workers, a Birmingham jury ordered
Pacific Mutual to pay $1,077,978, with most of it intended to
punish the company.</p>
<p>In its new term, which begins Monday, the Supreme Court
will use the case to decide whether, under the 14th
Amendment's "due process" guarantee, juries must be given
standards to guide their decisions on when and how much
punitive damages are appropriate. The case is scheduled to be
argued next Wednesday.</p>
<p>For business, which complains bitterly that unreasonable
punitive jury verdicts are running rampant, the case will be
one of the most closely watched of the year. Briefs have been
filed by the pharmaceutical, wholesale, insurance, medical,
accounting and news industries, as well as the Business
Roundtable, U.S. Chamber of Commerce and American Corporate
Counsel Association.</p>
<p>"American business faces a world of unended, unbounded
threat of punitive damages with no guidelines that are really
tangible," says Victor Schwartz, a Washington lawyer who is
counsel to the Product Liability Alliance, a coalition of
manufacturers, wholesalers and trade groups.</p>
<p>Mr. Schwartz argues that "the threat of punitive damages
keeps good products off the market," even slowing development
and marketing of an AIDS vaccine, defibrillators and other
medical devices. And, he says, companies find "their credit
is threatened if they have big damage judgments pending
against them," because in most states insurance doesn't cover
punitive damages, and companies must cover the expense
themselves. In a small company, that could be fatal.</p>
<p>But consumer groups and lawyers who represent plaintiffs
in lawsuits for damages say they see no need for the Supreme
Court to meddle in the laws of the 50 states. "You do not
talk to companies unless you talk to their pocketbooks," John
Whitaker, a Birmingham lawyer for Mrs. Haslip, told the jury
in her case.</p>
<p>"Punitive damages are a very effective tool to curb
outrageous misconduct by companies," says Linda Lipsen of
Consumers Union of United States. "We recognize that these
awards can hurt, and they should hurt because they are
punishment. You can't tell a major corporation to go to its
room." Far from deterring major new products, she contends,
"Punitive damages drive from the market dangerous products.
They encourage innovation and responsibility for creating
better products."</p>
<p>Business interests cite numerous examples of big punitive
damage awards as evidence of problems in the system. Last
year, an insurance salesman in Clearwater, Fla., won $1
million in compensatory damages and $25 million in punitive
damages from John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. for
defaming him, according to Lawyers Alert, a Boston magazine.
In July, a research scientist who was fired for protesting
the alleged failure of Syntex Corp. to disclose side effects
of an anti-ulcer drug won $15 million in punitive damages, on
top of $2.5 million in compensatory damages.</p>
<p>But if the persistence of business complaints about
punitive damages provides anecdotal evidence of a widespread
problem, a study published this year by the American Bar
Foundation, a research arm of the American Bar Association,
suggests the opposite. The study, which examined a total of
25,627 jury verdicts in 47 counties in 11 states from 1981
through 1985, found that punitive damages were awarded in
only 4.9% of those cases, and in 8.8% of cases won by
plaintiffs.</p>
<p>The study also examined the median size of punitive
awards, rather than oft-cited averages, which it said can be
skewed by one large award. Its conclusion: in 15 of the 20
counties that had more than 10 punitive-damages awards, the
median punitive award was under $40,000; the other five
counties, all in California, had higher medians.</p>
<p>But one element that makes this case especially worth
watching is that business seems to have a sympathetic ear in
the Supreme Court, which has grappled with the issue
previously but never decided it.</p>
<p>Last year, in a case unsuccessfully challenging punitive
damages on other constitutional grounds, four justices --
Sandra O'Connor, John Stevens, Thurgood Marshall and the
since-retired William Brennan -- expressed concern that
juries' unlimited discretion to make awards might violate the
due-process guarantee, which requires some standards and
procedural fairness before people and companies can be
deprived of their property. And in another case, decided in
1988, Justice Antonin Scalia joined a concurring opinion by
Justice O'Connor that questioned juries' "wholly standardless
discretion."</p>
<p>If the justices find themselves deadlocked 4-4 on the
Pacific Mutual case, they might order it reargued after the
arrival of David Souter, whose nomination to the court is
expected to win Senate approval next week. Little is known
about his view of punitive damages.</p>
<p>In some ways, the Pacific Mutual case seems an unlikely
vehicle for the court to use to decide the punitive-damages
issue. The complex events don't give the court a "clean" case
that turns solely on the due-process issue.</p>
<p>Yet to Mrs. Haslip, the case is less about legal
abstractions than about real-life concerns. More than eight
years after the story began, she still faces more than $3,500
in unpaid medical bills, has court judgments against her for
the debt and thus has difficulty obtaining credit. "I didn't
see any alternative to the lawsuit," she says. "They weren't
going to pay my bills."</p>
<p>In 1981, Mrs. Haslip, a mother of five, was the librarian
and assistant town clerk at Roosevelt City's two-story, white
stucco town hall, where she had worked for nine years. The
town, which has since been annexed by Birmingham, had lost
its old employees' insurance policy and was shopping for a
new one when it was contacted by Mr. Ruffin, the Pacific
Mutual agent.</p>
<p>Mr. Ruffin signed up the employees with Pacific Mutual for
their life insurance. But because the company didn't issue
municipal group health insurance, he placed the health policy
-- with the approval of Pacific Mutual's local manager --
with a different company, Union Fidelity Life Insurance Co.,
a unit of Aon Corp.</p>
<p>Mrs. Haslip testified at the 1987 trial that if she and
her fellow workers knew about Union Fidelity at all, they
believed it was part of Pacific Mutual. Every two weeks, the
town deducted $52.95 from Mrs. Haslip's take-home pay of $280
for the life and health policies.</p>
<p>Using unorthodox practices described at the trial, Mr.
Ruffin presented only one bill on Pacific Mutual stationery
for both policies, collected the payments himself, and after
two months had the town make the checks out to him
personally. He also had the insurance companies send all mail
about the policies to him rather than to the policyholders.
(Mr. Ruffin hasn't been heard from by other parties in the
case for several years, and frequent calls to his last known
phone number have gone unanswered.)</p>
<p>What the town and workers apparently never knew is that
after one month on the health policy and two months on the
life policy, Mr. Ruffin stopped sending in the premiums, and
the policies were canceled. "Instead of forwarding these
collected premiums to the insurers, Ruffin pocketed the
money," Bruce Ennis, a Washington lawyer for Mrs. Haslip,
says in a Supreme Court brief. Mr. Ruffin said in a
deposition and Pacific Mutual said at the trial that the town
was told that the policy was canceled, but town officials and
workers testified they never knew.</p>
<p>For five months, the Roosevelt City workers continued
paying premiums on the nonexistent policies. Then, in the
middle of the night on Jan. 23, 1982, Mrs. Haslip was
admitted to the emergency room at Baptist Medical
Center-Princeton for what turned into a weeklong stay for a
kidney infection and hiatal hernia. She couldn't leave
without paying a $600 deposit on the bill, after discovering
that she was uninsured.</p>
<p>"That accounted for almost everything I had," she says in
an interview. "You don't have much savings on my salary." At
first, Mrs. Haslip says, "I thought it was a mistake." But
when she called Mr. Ruffin again, he insisted there was no
mistake. "I got so angry, I was shouting at him, crying and
everything," she says.</p>
<p>In May 1982, Mrs. Haslip sued Mr. Ruffin and Pacific
Mutual, on the theory that the company was responsible for
its agent's actions. The jury's verdict in her favor was
upheld both by the trial judge and, last September, by the
Alabama Supreme Court.</p>
<p>But Washington lawyer Andrew Frey, who filed a brief in
the case for the Business Roundtable, argues that punitive
damages are like criminal penalties, and "there must be fair
procedures for deciding that someone can be punished and for
setting the amount." The award against Pacific Mutual, he
says, is excessive because it wasn't based on any comparable
criminal fines or on the severity of the actions.</p>
<p>Because of the peculiar facts of the case, it is possible
that the court won't address the broad question of whether
limits should be placed on punitive awards; instead, the
justices could focus on the narrower question of whether the
Constitution allows an employer to be held liable for
punitive damages for an employee's actions that weren't in
line with company policy.</p>
<p>But even if the justices go that route, the issue won't
fade away. Nearly a dozen more appeals of punitive-damages
cases have been filed in the Supreme Court; they are
currently on hold, awaiting the outcome of the Alabama case,
and indicate just how far-reaching the challenges to punitive
damages are. They include:</p>
<p>-- An appeal by Reserve Life Insurance Co., a Sammons
Enterprises Inc. unit, of a Mississippi jury's award of
$500,000 in punitive damages for the company's failure to pay
a $6,658 medical claim;</p>
<p>-- A challenge by Clayton Brokerage Co. of St. Louis, a
Garnac Grain Co. unit, to a $400,000 punitive award for
allegedly causing a $7,923 loss in a commodities-trading
account;</p>
<p>-- And a petition by the Church of Scientology of
California to overturn a $2 million punitive award and
$500,000 compensatory award to a former church member who
sued, charging that church practices intentionally caused him
emotional distress.</p>
<p>Among lawyers in these heated debates, there are few
disinterested parties. Plaintiffs' lawyers profit from big
damage verdicts because they typically take the cases for a
sizable percentage of the total award. But battling against
punitive damages, both in court and in the legislative arena,
has become a profitable industry for defense lawyers, who are
paid well by businesses and trade groups.</p>
<p>As for Mrs. Haslip, she is still having money problems and
has yet to see a cent of the judgment. She plans to attend
the oral arguments on Wednesday, but says she hasn't much
thought about what she will do with the money if her victory
is upheld. "I try not to think that far ahead," she says,
"because I might not get it."</p>
