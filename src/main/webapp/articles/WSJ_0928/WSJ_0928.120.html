	<p class="article-leader">Charity, it's said, begins at home. But for a growing
number of corporate directors, it is being bankrolled in the
board room.
   Some of the nation's largest corporations are quietly
giving their directors the ability to leave handsome nest
eggs to the charity or charities of their choice -- at no
cost to the directors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It's the new million-dollar board perquisite. There's one
big catch: The gift isn't given until the director dies.
Payable to the designated charities upon death, the gift is
financed by insurance policies taken out by the company on
the director's life.</p>
<p>Typically, the policies will mean an eventual tax-free
windfall of between $500,000 and $2 million for the board
member's alma mater, favorite disease-fighting effort or
other worthy cause. The average legacy is $1 million.</p>
<p>"This allows a person to have an eternal impact, to really
leave something for generations to come," says E. Webb
Bassick IV, an executive compensation partner at Hewitt &
Associates, management consultants based in Chicago.</p>
<p>Companies say the perk helps them to lure the most
desirable directors and keep them on board. Attracting and
retaining directors isn't an easy task these days, say
executive recruiters. Mere cash doesn't cut it any longer, as
increased responsibilities and liability concerns prompt many
prospective directors to reject board invitations and many
incumbents to leave sooner. A recent Korn/Ferry International
survey finds that nearly half of the major companies it
polled expect at least one director to leave this year.</p>
<p>"If you're having difficulty getting directors to sit on
your board, this could make the difference," says Mr.
Bassick.</p>
<p>While the beneficiaries of the legacies will have to wait
for their money, the companies can take the cost of premiums
as an expense. More significantly, when the director does
die, the policy payoff can be included in the company's
charitable gift tax deduction since the money actually flows
from the insurer through the company and on to the intended
beneficiary.</p>
<p>Still, many companies are reluctant to publicize the perk.
While promoters of the million-dollar legacies say more than
two dozen major companies offer it to their directors,
General Electric Co., PPG Industries Inc. and Westinghouse
Electric Corp., among others, don't disclose it. "We did not
deem this to be compensation," a Westinghouse spokesman says.</p>
<p>"Corporations find there's a lot of focus on the magnitude
of director benefits, and they'd just like to avoid the issue
if they could," says Louis R. Richey, a vice president of
Ayco Corp., an American Express Co. unit that markets the
legacy perk.</p>
<p>Some companies also worry that shareholders will think
such plans enrich directors, or look on any eleemosynary
activity as a misuse of corporate assets.</p>
<p>But other companies see charitable giving as a public
relations plus. Waste Management Inc.'s proxy statement views
the perk as part of the company's "overall program to promote
charitable giving as a means to enhance the quality of life
in the many communities" in which it operates.</p>
<p>Because the perk doesn't compensate the individual --
although a grateful college may send him or her some choice
game tickets -- there is no requirement that it be disclosed
as a board benefit. Lawyers also say disclosure can be ducked
since, during the director's lifetime, his or her legacy
isn't irrevocable. The corporation could decide to
countermand the bequest wishes.</p>
<p>So far that hasn't happened. Insurers say no director
covered by such a policy has yet died.</p>
<p>Alexander Trowbridge, former president of the National
Association of Manufacturers who sits on Waste Management's
board, says his intended beneficiary is Phillips Academy in
Andover, Mass., where he chairs the planned-giving committee.
Mr. Trowbridge, who calls the legacy benefit "a brilliant
idea," says he has urged the school's leadership to recommend
it to other directors-alumni.</p>
<p>H. Brewster Atwater Jr., General Mills Inc.'s chairman and
chief executive officer, is on two boards with the perk --
his own and GE's. And while he says he intends to leave a
"good portion to education and a good portion to cultural
activities," Mr. Atwater hasn't notified the prospective
recipients "because I might find I may be more interested in
something else five years from now."</p>
<p>Legacy policies for directors are so new that only a
handful of insurers offer them. Thus, some companies find it
cheaper to bid out the coverage themselves.</p>
<p>Similar insurance has been available for well-to-do
individuals. But until recently, such policies haven't been
used as corporate benefits.</p>
<p>Initially the program isn't cheap: annual premiums can
cost upwards of $25,000 per director. "You've really got to
dig behind the numbers and see if you agree with all the
assumptions," says Hewitt's Mr. Bassick, noting that
dividend, tax and interest rates should be considered. "As
with any life insurance product, you have to look at it in
the same decision process as building a new factory: Should
we be using the funds in another way?"</p>
<p>A company should also ask what the buying power of today's
dollars will be decades from now. "We're looking at a face
value of $1.5 million and saying, `Boy, what a lasting gift.'
But in 30 years it may not buy the tribute we think of
today," notes Mr. Bassick.</p>
<p>Health is always an important factor in buying life
insurance. But some companies are getting around that by
pairing older directors who may be poor risks with younger,
healthier board members. Under such "survivorship" policies,
the insurer doesn't pay out either director's benefits until
both are dead. That could complicate the selection of
would-be beneficiaries.</p>
<p>"There's a lot of flexibility in policies. Premiums depend
on how long a company wants to pay out," says Amy Kalkbrenner
of Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Co., a Hartford, Conn.,
insurer specializing in the "survivorship" policies.</p>
<p>But this perk isn't for everyone. Smaller companies may
find the cost too great, or alternative uses of the money
preferable. And some large companies -- among them apparel
maker Hartmarx Corp. and pharmaceuticals giant Merck & Co. --
say they've studied the legacy perk program but passed, for
various reasons.</p>
<p>Some companies let directors pick the beneficiary. But PPG
asks directors to use their legacies to support education,
partly to foster a smarter work force for the future.
American Express and Union Pacific Corp. also have a say.
They split the proceeds between designated recipients and
their in-house charitable foundations.</p>
<p>A few companies that offer the plan to directors are
expanding it to include senior executives. Usually in those
cases, though, employees share the insurance cost with the
company, and their coverage may be considerably less than
that afforded directors. At Bell Atlantic Corp., only outside
directors with at least five years' service are eligible for
the perk. Raymond W. Smith, the company's chairman, says
directors may decide to increase the $500,000 maximum legacy
in lieu of more cash.</p>
<p>The legacy idea wins plaudits from many in the financial
planning and executive-compensation fields. "I don't think
that in the decade just past we were ready for this,"
Hewitt's Mr. Bassick says. "We were too cash-driven. Today,
charitable giving fits."</p>
