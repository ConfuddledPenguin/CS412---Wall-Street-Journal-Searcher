	<p class="article-leader">In reprinting an article by Yossi Sarid of the Israeli
Ratz-CRM Party (editorial page, Sept. 10), you editorialized
that the article "touched off an outpouring of similar
statements from the Israeli left doubting whether compromise
with Palestinians is possible."
   Your readers should know that Shulamith Aloni, head of
CRM, and CRM Knesset member Dedi Zucker both criticized Mr.
Sarid. Mr. Zucker said Mr. Sarid's statement that the
Palestinians will now have to "look for me" when they want to
talk is in fact a classic right-wing argument. "Anyone who
conditions negotiations on the Palestinians changing their
leadership is speaking with the Likud's mouth, because the
Likud, too, is unwilling to talk to them unless they change
their leadership," Mr. Zucker said. Said Mr. Aloni: "Never
has the enemy dictated our moral criteria or determined what
was good and right for the State of Israel."</p>
