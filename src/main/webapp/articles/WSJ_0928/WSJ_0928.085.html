	<p class="article-leader">Machine-tool producers will report dismal third quarter
profits. Shipments were depressed because of weak orders in
1989's second half and the first few months of 1990.
   Machine tools are large, complex machines that shape metal
parts, and there often is a lead time of several months to a
year between receipt of an order and shipment of the machine.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The industry also is beset by intensely competitive
pricing. There's excess capacity in the U.S. machine-tool
industry, and foreign producers are shipping in machines from
abroad and adding plant capacity in the U.S.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, "the tone at the recent machine tool show in
Chicago was quite upbeat," said Eli S. Lustgarten, machinery
analyst with PaineWebber. "Industry orders for 1990 will be
up 4% to 6% from last year, and they'll rise another 5% to
10% next year," he said. That's far from a boom, he added,
but it should produce improved industry profits in 1991.</p>
<p>For one thing, automotive companies are expected to place
some long-deferred orders for equipment to produce new
engines and other basic parts for 1993 and 1994 model cars.
"The stumbling blocks that delayed the orders are falling,"
Mr. Lustgarten said, and auto makers don't have much more
time, if they want to avoid slipping another year behind the
Japanese in car design.</p>
<p>Order deferral by car and truck makers was a major reason
for the machine tool order drop that began in the spring of
1989.</p>
<p>The declining value of the dollar is one of this year's
few plus factors. Machine-tool exports in 1990's first half
rose 17% from a year earlier, and may set a record for the
full year, exceeding the $1 billion of 1981, according to the
NMTBA -- the Association for Manufacturing Technology, a
McLean, Va., trade group.</p>
<p>The machine-tool industry isn't energy-intensive, and
won't be hurt directly by higher oil prices. However, orders
would drop if rising oil prices and uncertainty about the
threat of war in the Middle East bring on a recession in the
U.S. and slow economic activity abroad.</p>
<p>On the other hand, machine-tool companies are receiving
more orders from makers of oilfield drilling equipment, pumps
and valves as oil prices rise and demand for natural gas
increases.</p>
<p>In addition, higher gasoline prices may increase auto
company purchases of equipment to make new 16-valve,
four-cylinder engines and four-speed automatic transmissions.
The auto industry has been undecided about whether to make
more six-cylinder engines for larger, higher performance
cars, or to tool up for fuel-efficient models.</p>
<p>Government fuel-economy regulations pressure the companies
to emphasize economy, but consumer demand was tilting
strongly toward performance. Higher gasoline prices could
resolve the issue in favor of economy.</p>
<p>Longer term, if oil prices remain high, U.S. industry will
renew efforts to conserve energy, such as operating more
fuel-efficient trucks, airplanes and heavy machinery. That
would boost orders for machine tools in 1991 and beyond.</p>
<p>In the third quarter, negatives outweighed the positives.
Cincinnati Milacron Inc. said it's too early to make a
precise third-quarter earnings estimate, but that profit
probably will be in the ballpark of the disappointing 12
cents a share earned in the second quarter. In 1989's third
period, when Milacron was feeling the brunt of restructuring
problems, profit from continuing operations was $3.3 million,
or 13 cents a share, on sales of $233.8 million. Net income
was $2.5 million, or 10 cents a share.</p>
<p>Milacron's profit in recent quarters has suffered from
reduced shipments of some of its higher margin products, such
as plastics-injection molding machines. Also, the company is
shipping some machines that carry inadequate profit margins,
reflecting competitive pricing. Milacron has become more
selective about the business it accepts, a spokesman said,
but still has some low-margin business on the books.</p>
<p>Monarch Machine Tool Co., Sidney, Ohio, also is having a
disappointing third quarter, mainly because of reduced orders
during the spring and summer, said Robert J. Siewert,
president. The producer of lathes, machining centers and
equipment for processing coils of sheet metal will be
profitable for the quarter, he said, but it's too early to
say whether net will exceed the modest $271,942, or seven
cents a share, Monarch earned a year ago on $24 million
revenue.</p>
<p>Monarch began the year expecting sharply higher profit in
1990, but second and third-quarter earnings fell far below
expectations, Mr. Siewert said. The company's British lathe
operation had lower shipments at the same time that domestic
machine-tool business was in a slump. Orders have improved
recently, he said, and the fourth quarter will be the best
earnings period for the year.</p>
<p>Giddings & Lewis Inc., Fond du Lac, Wis., is faring better
than most other machine-tool builders this year; it expects
to approximate last year's third-quarter net of $4.8 million,
or 46 cents a share. "Our bookings have held up, and we have
a good backlog," said Richard Kleinfeldt, vice president and
chief financial officer. He doesn't quarrel with analyst
estimates that the company will earn $1.80 to $1.85 a share
for the year, up from $17.1 million, or $1.65 a share, in
1989, when sales were $233.1 million.</p>
<p>Cross & Trecker Corp. concedes that it won't realize a
previously announced goal of turning profitable in fiscal
1990, which ends Sunday. The Bloomfield Hills, Mich., company
expects to report a loss for the fourth quarter larger than
the year-ago quarter's loss of $1 million, or eight cents a
share. However, fiscal 1990's loss will be far smaller than
the loss of $46.5 million, or $3.76 a share, for all of
fiscal 1989, which included a restructuring charge of $21.3
million.</p>
<p>Reduced orders at the KT-Swasey unit, which produces
machining centers and lathes, and at the Sheffield measuring
machine unit, are major factors in the expected
fourth-quarter loss, Cross & Trecker said. Sheffield is
profitable, but will earn less than a year ago.</p>
<p>In addition, Cross has had difficulty in arranging
financing for a large Soviet order. Last March, Cross
received Soviet orders totaling $63 million for machinery to
equip a Soviet auto plant. West German banks agreed to
finance the $28 million portion of the order placed with the
Cross plant in West Germany. However, U.S. banks won't
finance the $35 million part that was to be produced in
Michigan, delaying the program, Cross said. U.S. banks are
skittish about whether the Soviets would make the repayments.</p>
<p>The company accounts for large contracts on a percentage
of completion basis, and had expected to book as much as
$700,000 of operating profit from the Soviet order in the
Sept. 30 quarter. Cross may transfer production to another
country to obtain financing, possibly reopening a Canadian
facility.</p>
<p>The order slowdown hit Hurco Cos., Indianapolis, just as
the producer of machining centers and electronic controls was
increasing spending on new-product development and its
marketing and customer-service organization. This year, Hurco
introduced a new generation of machine-tool controls and will
market five new machine tools, said Michael K. Campbell,
senior vice president and chief financial officer.</p>
<p>Hurco's profit in the third quarter, ended July 31,
plunged to $1.1 million, or 19 cents a share, from $2.2
million, or 45 cents a share, a year earlier. The company
expects net for the Oct. 31 fourth quarter to approximate the
third period's, which would be less than half the $2.9
million, or 51 cents a share, earned in the year-ago quarter.</p>
<p>However, Hurco could exceed a fiscal 1990 earnings
estimate of $1.20 a share if sales in the final weeks of the
year keep pace with a recent increase in customer inquiries,
Mr. Campbell said.</p>
<p>For fiscal 1989, Hurco earned a record $8.2 million, or
$1.70 a share, on sales of $93.7 million.</p>
