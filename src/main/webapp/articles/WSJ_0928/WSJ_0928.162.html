	<p class="article-leader">A federal judge in Florida struck down as unconstitutional
a rule by the state's board of accountancy that restricted
certified public accountants from directly soliciting new
business.
   In his ruling, Judge Maurice M. Paul found the state's
administrative code "places an unconstitutional ban on
protected commercial speech in violation of the first and
fourteenth amendments."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The case was brought by Scott Fane, a CPA licensed to
practice in Florida, against the state board, which the
Legislature has empowered to promulgate rules for the
profession. An attorney in the Florida attorney general's
office, which defended the case, said a decision hasn't been
made whether to appeal.</p>
<p>The state argued that its prohibition of accountants
soliciting business in person, or by telephone, was similar
to restrictions on attorney solicitation recently upheld by
the U.S. Supreme Court. But the judge held that concerns
surrounding solicitation by attorneys were unique to that
profession, and couldn't be extended to accountants.</p>
<p>David Vladeck, an attorney with the Public Citizen
litigation group in Washington who represented Mr. Fane, said
he doesn't know whether his client has begun exercising his
right to drum up business. Mr. Fane, a tax specialist,
"believes it will be much more efficient for him" to be able
to call potential clients and offer his services, Mr. Vladeck
said.</p>
