	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Mexico has voiced concerns about Canada's
bid to participate in Mexico's negotiations with the U.S.
over a free-trade agreement.
   In a classified letter to President Bush, White House
Trade Representative Carla Hills said Mexico is worried that
Canadian participation "could delay a U.S.-Mexico free-trade
agreement or jeopardize consideration by the U.S. Congress."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Canada, whose own free-trade pact with the U.S. took
effect last year, maintains that excluding it from the
U.S.-Mexico negotiations wouldn't be "politically
acceptable," according to Mrs. Hills. But, she added, the
Canadians don't want to be "a spoiler and would bow out
diplomatically" if their participation is seen "as delaying
or jeopardizing the achievement of a U.S.Mexican free-trade
agreement."</p>
<p>Mrs. Hills, the nation's top trade negotiator, sent the
letter Sept. 21, after meeting the previous evening with
Mexican Commerce Minister Jaime Serra Puche and Canadian
Trade Minister John Crosbie.</p>
<p>Canadian involvement undoubtedly would complicate
U.S.-Mexico talks. "Two's company, three may be a crowd,"
said Jim Moore, a former assistant secretary at the Commerce
Department during the Reagan administration. "To be able to
bring a third party -- Canada -- into the middle of these
U.S.-Mexican negotiations makes a much more delicate
situation." Mr. Moore, now a private consultant, added that
"there are many enormous complex bilateral issues" between
the U.S. and Mexico that don't closely involve Canada.</p>
<p>The U.S. push for a Mexican free-trade pact is part of the
Bush administration's strategy to boost commerce in the
Western hemisphere. In addition to the proposed agreement
with Mexico, President Bush called this summer for Latin
American nations to work toward establishing a free-trade
area throughout the Western hemisphere.</p>
<p>Already, Chile, which has done much to liberalize its
economy and trade over the past eight years, is eager to
start negotiating a bilateral trade pact with the U.S. Mrs.
Hills's aides say they welcome Chile's enthusiasm, but they
warn that the process takes time.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hills said in her letter that she and her Canadian
and Mexican counterparts will hold informal talks in the
coming months to devise a structure for the U.S.-Mexico
free-trade talks. She said the three trade ministers set next
Jan. 31 as "an unannounced deadline for determining whether
the negotiations would proceed bilaterally or trilaterally."
Formal negotiations between the U.S. and Mexico on the trade
pact are unlikely to start before that date.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush notified Congress earlier this week of his plans
to negotiate a free-trade agreement with Mexico. Mrs. Hills
suggested in her letter to the president that the
administration encourage the three nations to consult in the
coming months "to see if the trilateral approach was workable
and satisfactory for all sides, with the understanding that
Canada would depart gracefully" if its participation seemed
likely to upset the negotiating schedule or jeopardize
congressional approval.</p>
<p>The president sought to ease Canadian concerns in his
letter notifying Congress of his intentions to negotiate with
Mexico. He said the U.S. would consult with both Canada and
Mexico during the U.S.-Mexico negotiations, with a view to
eventually achieving a three-way agreement on free trade.</p>
