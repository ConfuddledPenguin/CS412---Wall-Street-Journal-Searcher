	<p class="article-leader">FLINT, Mich. -- The tentative labor pact between General
Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers union is sailing
through ratification by the union's rank and file, and could
win final approval by Sunday.
   Ratification of the GM pact will likely trigger the start
of negotiations between the union and Ford Motor Co. On
Monday, the UAW is expected to discuss its next moves in
talks with Ford and Chrysler Corp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Though many of the 155 locals haven't voted on the pact
yet, the outlook for passage is good. UAW members were
approving the accord by majorities in excess of 90% at some
plants. Even in the strongholds of factions opposed to the
current UAW leadership, the pact is passing by wide margins.
Workers at a Pontiac complex voted nearly 4-to-1 in favor of
the pact, even though their dissident leadership opposed the
agreement.</p>
<p>The strong support for the proposed GM pact shows that GM
and the UAW may be moving away from the strained relations
that marked the past several years and toward an era of
relative peace.</p>
<p>But GM will pay handsomely for smoother relations with its
blue-collar work force. Under the pact, GM is pledging up to
$4 billion to pay wages and benefits for workers it lays off
during the life of the agreement. The auto maker will also
spend heavily to sweeten pension and early retirement
benefits aimed at encouraging its older workers to retire.</p>
<p>GM officials acknowledge the pact is in part a bet that
the No. 1 auto maker's U.S. sales won't drop substantially
more than they have in the past decade. "If sales are
maintained, it's a liveable agreement," said a GM executive.
If not, "Then we're going to be in a hurt," he added.</p>
<p>GM workers, however, seem satisfied that the agreement
gives them protection regardless of what happens to sales.</p>
<p>"There is no doubt that this is going to pass
overwhelmingly," said Kenneth Scott, the top UAW official at
GM's Buick City auto complex. Mr. Scott said that he's
certain the 13,000 members in his local will vote in favor of
the pact, despite a large dissident presence in the local's
factories.</p>
<p>Mr. Scott said the new pact is finding favor among workers
because it has something for all classes of workers: Bigger
pensions for current and future retirees; more income
security for younger workers, who often endure lengthy
layoffs; and a small wage increase plus future cost of living
increases.</p>
<p>After GM workers ratify the pact, UAW bargainers are
expected to ask Ford to accept nearly identical terms.
Negotiations with Ford could start early next week. Ford
officials have said they could accept an agreement similar to
the GM pact, but want modifications allowing them to run
their plants on overtime schedules without having to pay the
steep penalty the GM agreement requires.</p>
<p>The UAW is expected to save Chrysler for last and thus
defer a possible showdown with the No. 3 auto maker. Chrysler
has insisted that it can't afford a pact modeled on the GM
agreement. UAW officials have said they won't break their
pattern bargaining strategy to benefit Chrysler.</p>
