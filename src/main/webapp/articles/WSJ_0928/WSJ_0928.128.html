	<p class="article-leader">Au Printemps S.A. said it had consolidated net profit of
57 million French francs ($10.9 million) for the first half
of 1990, compared with a year-earlier loss of 50 million
francs.
   The French retailing group said that part of the
improvement reflected its decision to no longer include in
its results its 25% stake in the distribution group
Euromarche S.A. During the first half of 1989, Euromarche cut
about 30 million francs off Printemps' earnings.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Printemps said earnings were also helped by the use of
proceeds from 1989 asset sales -- totaling about 800 million
francs -- to pay down its debt and reduce costs.</p>
<p>Revenue climbed 2% to 13.96 billion francs from 13.66
billion. Pretax profit from current operations surged to 192
million francs from 92 million.</p>
<p>Printemps wouldn't forecast full-year earnings because of
the unknown impact of the Persian Gulf crisis on demand
during the second half. However, it said it expects a
significant improvement in its current operating profit for
the year.</p>
<p>For 1989, Printemps had consolidated net profit of 524
million francs on revenue of 28.5 billion francs.</p>
