	<p class="article-leader">FRANKFURT, West Germany -- The Finance Ministry set a 25.8
billion mark ($16.48 billion) additional borrowing
requirement for 1990, as part of West Germany's third, and
largest, supplementary budget for the year.
   Ministry officials said the new borrowing will bring the
all-German federal spending deficit to 66.8 billion marks for
this year, a 63% jump from the combined 41 billion-mark
deficit previously planned for both German states, which will
reunite next Wednesday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Finance Minister Theo Waigel today will present a new
budget outline, requiring the additional borrowing to cover
20.1 billion marks in new federal spending and about five
billion marks in new credits pledged to East German
municipalities last July. Officials said the supplementary
budget, which is to become the first budget of a united
Germany, was crafted after an effort to siphon funds from
Bonn programs.</p>
<p>The new strains on West German capital markets don't end
there. Including off-budget financing for the agency trying
to salvage East Germany's inefficient industries, and deficit
spending of West German states and municipalities, the total
public-sector deficit of a united Germany will total about
100 billion marks this year, even after a 20 billion mark
surplus in West Germany's social security system. In 1989,
West Germany had a public-sector deficit of 21.6 billion
marks.</p>
<p>The newly budgeted all-German federal spending of 20.1
billion marks is added to the previously budgeted outlays of
311.8 billion marks for the West German federal government,
and 64.2 billion marks for the central government of East
Germany.</p>
