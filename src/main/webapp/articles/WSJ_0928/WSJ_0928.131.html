	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Senate passed legislation that would
give the Securities and Exchange Commission controversial new
enforcement powers, expanding the agency's fining authority
beyond insider-trading cases.
   The bill, approved by voice vote, also would give the
agency "cease and desist" power to stop alleged wrongdoers.
Moreover, it contains a provision that would better protect
penny-stock investors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The legislation, expected to be approved soon by the
House, is expected to allow the SEC to handle more cases
in-house through its own administrative law judges rather
than in federal courts. While the administrative law judges
are forced to use identical burdens of proof as federal court
judges, they are seen by some as being more sympathetic to
the SEC.</p>
<p>That has made some defense lawyers skittish that clients
won't get the same treatment they can expect now. But the SEC
dismisses that complaint, contending that the bill would
allow the agency to better tailor the punishment to the
crime. "It is not an unreasonable conclusion for people to
say the enforcement program in the '80s has uncovered enough
problems that we need more flexibility and to add some
economic deterrence," said SEC enforcement director William
McLucas. "My view is that's what this bill does."</p>
<p>The bill was proposed by the SEC two years ago in an
effort to fill what it saw were holes in its enforcement
program. The legislation also would give the agency the
authority to ask courts to bar people from serving public
companies as officers and directors if they have violated
securities laws.</p>
<p>Under the fining authority, the agency could impose
maximum penalties of as much as $100,000 per violation for
individuals, $500,000 for corporations or the amount gained
through illegal activities.</p>
<p>The penny-stock provision would give the commission the
power to take enforcement action against penny-stock
promoters, many of whom are not registered with the
commission. Promoters found to be wrongdoers could be barred
from being associated with a brokerage in the future. The
bill also features new risk-disclosure requirements telling
customers the nature and level of risks in the penny-stock
area. Those requirements also extend to the way brokers deal
with their customers.</p>
<p>The penny-stock provision also would give the SEC the
power to place new limitations on so-called blank-check
pools, which solicit investor funds without identifying the
use of the proceeds. Moreover, the bill instructs the SEC to
press exchanges to create an improved pricing system for
penny stocks.</p>
<p>Separately, the Senate Banking Committee unanimously
approved the nomination of Richard Roberts to the SEC. Mr.
Roberts is a lawyer who was a former aide to Sen. Richard
Shelby (D., Ala.), a member of the committee. Mr. Roberts,
who was nominated to fill a Democratic slot on the
commission, is expected to be approved soon by the full
Senate.</p>
