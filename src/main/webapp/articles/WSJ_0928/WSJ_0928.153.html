	<p class="article-leader">SAN DIEGO -- A federal court jury awarded Brooktree Corp.
$26 million in damages for infringements Advanced Micro
Devices made on the tiny chip maker's patents and copyrights.
   The award comes two weeks after the U.S. District Court
ruled that Advanced Micro, a Sunnyvale, Calif., chip maker,
illegally used three Brooktree patents in computer chips
called "color palettes," which control the display of colors
on computer screens. The court also ruled that Advanced Micro
infringed on Brooktree "mask work" rights, the rights to
circuit layouts on chips.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The award is a big one for Brooktree, a private company
that expects revenue of just over $60 million this year.
Brooktree charged that offending Advanced Micro chips cut
deeply into the smaller company's revenue. Advanced Micro's
color palette chips comprised less than 1% of its $1.1
billion revenue in 1989.</p>
<p>An Advanced Micro spokesman said the company will appeal
the damage award as well as the ruling. "This a shocking and
unsupportable amount of damages," the spokesman said. He
added Advanced Micro didn't copy Brooktree's chips and that
patent violation, if there was any, was inadvertent because
Advanced Micro's product was on the market before the patents
were issued.</p>
<p>The federal judge in the case issued an injunction calling
for Advanced Micro to stop making, using or selling any
infringing products. The court stayed the injunction for 10
days, but Advanced Micro says it will comply by immediately
ceasing sales of the product in question.</p>
<p>Advanced Micro has a patent-infringement case pending
against Brooktree, and says its patents are broader than
Brooktree's.</p>
