	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Amerada Hess Corp. said its Canadian
subsidiary completed the acquisition of oil and gas producing
properties owned by a subsidiary of Placer Dome Inc.
   Amerada Minerals Corp. of Canada acquired 80% of the
producing properties and 250,000 exploration acres from
Placer Cego Petroleum Holdings Ltd. for about $215 million.
The cost was 17% lower than Amerada stated last July; a
spokesman said the earlier cost of $260 million dropped
because of adjustments.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Amerada Minerals said it expects the properties, which are
principally in Alberta and British Columbia, to produce
14,000 barrels per day of crude oil and natural gas liquids
by 1992.</p>
