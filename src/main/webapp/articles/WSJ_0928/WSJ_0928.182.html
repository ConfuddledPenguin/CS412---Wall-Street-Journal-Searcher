	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A federal judge delayed the sentencing of
Michael Milken, scheduled for Monday, and ordered an unusual
hearing to consider additional crimes the government has
alleged Mr. Milken committed, but to which he hasn't pleaded
guilty.
   U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood said she would hold a
two-week hearing to air the government's allegations against
the former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. junk-bond king. The
hearing will likely be held next month. Judge Wood said she
planned to give both prosecutors and defense lawyers 20 hours
each to present arguments and cross-examine witnesses.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As previously reported, prosecutors had sought such a
hearing -- over the strenuous objections of Mr. Milken's
lawyers -- and have notified lawyers for witnesses who aided
the government in its case against Mr. Milken that these
witnesses may be called to testify.</p>
<p>Among the witnesses the government has indicated it may
call are Ivan F. Boesky, the convicted former Wall Street
stock speculator, and David Solomon, a former money manager.
Prosecutors have also notified former Drexel employees that
they may be called.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Arthur Liman, Mr. Milken's lead lawyer, opposed
such a hearing, saying it "will prolong the agony" of Mr.
Milken's family. Mr. Liman said he would talk to prosecutors
during the weekend to see if a hearing could be avoided.</p>
<p>Prosecutors sought the hearing because they want Judge
Wood to consider the full force of their case against Mr.
Milken when she sentences him. Mr. Milken pleaded guilty last
April to six felony counts relating to securities fraud and
faces a maximum jail term of 28 years.</p>
<p>The government has urged Judge Wood to sentence Mr. Milken
to "substantial" jail time and has painted the 44-year-old
Mr. Milken as a white-collar criminal of major proportions.
In a sentencing memorandum made public earlier this week, the
government unleashed a barrage of additional alleged crimes
that it believes Mr. Milken committed. The alleged crimes
include insider trading and illegal payoffs to certain money
managers and other favored clients.</p>
<p>Mr. Milken's attorneys have urged Judge Wood to view Mr.
Milken's crimes as aberrations in an otherwise exemplary life
and to sentence him to perform fulltime community service.
His lawyers have accused the government of presenting
evidence of offenses that Mr. Milken has "never acknowledged
and has never committed."</p>
<p>In calling for the extraordinary hearing, Judge Wood said
that the court may take into account unadmitted conduct in
issuing a sentence. "Considering unadmitted conduct gives the
court a sense of a defendant's character," Judge Wood said.</p>
<p>She said that to avoid a lengthy hearing on all of the
government's allegations, she would limit the time that the
government could spend presenting its case. She said she
expected the government to concentrate on less than a dozen
of the transactions it has alleged were illegal, but to which
Mr. Milken hasn't admitted guilt.</p>
<p>A judge is not obligated to take the government's
additional allegations into consideration when deciding on an
appropriate sentence. But if Judge Wood decides she wishes to
consider the additional evidence in meting out a sentence,
Mr. Milken is entitled to defend himself at a hearing.</p>
<p>A similar battle over sentencing took place earlier this
year in the case against Robert Freeman, the former head of
arbitrage at Goldman, Sachs & Co. who pleaded guilty to a
single charge of insider trading. In that case, the judge
said that in issuing a sentence, he wouldn't consider any
crimes other than that to which Mr. Freeman pleaded guilty.
The government alleged that Mr. Freeman committed some 20
other crimes.</p>
