	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A Congressional Research Service study says
Iraq can survive the winter's embargoes by shifting to a
vegetarian diet, rationing food and smuggling in whatever it
can.
   The assessment came as Baghdad announced its intentions to
cut off food to non-Arabs and extend rationing to rice,
flour, sugar, tea and cooking oil. Bread has been rationed
since Sept. 1.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a report to Congress, an agriculture-policy analyst for
the Library of Congress's research arm said Iraq's chances of
holding out against trade sanctions depend largely on how
quickly it turns toward subsistence farming and substitutes
domestic crops for food imports. Until its invasion of
Kuwait, Iraq imported 75% of its food, including feed grain
for egg and poultry production.</p>
<p>"Locally grown potatoes can be substituted for imported
rice," the analyst, Susan Epstein, said. "Locally grown dates
can be pressed to obtain a sweetener to replace imported
sugar, and locally grown barley can replace imported wheat
for bread." In addition, the Iraqis can switch to beans and
lentils as a protein alternative to meat, she said.</p>
<p>Shortages, Ms. Epstein said, will be offset somewhat by a
fall harvest of vegetables and the slaughter of livestock as
farmers run out of feed grain. Iraqi farmers will begin
planting their barley and wheat crops next month, for harvest
in May and June. In the meantime, rationing of dwindling
wheat and rice stockpiles must be strictly enforced.</p>
<p>Over the long term, Ms. Epstein said, efforts to increase
production will be limited by the lack of seed and
farm-equipment parts and the exodus of foreign technicians
who had repaired irrigation rigs.</p>
