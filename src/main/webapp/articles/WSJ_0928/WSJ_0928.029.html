	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Commerce Department said in a
preliminary ruling that imports of semiprocessed Atlantic
salmon from Norway are being sold in the U.S. at less than
their home-market prices or production costs.
   The department recommended anti-dumping duties of 1.66% to
4.90% to be imposed on the imports to offset their alleged
price advantage over salmon harvested by U.S. fleets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The duties are to be collected if the finding is verified
by a subsequent investigation and the U.S. fishing industry
is found to be injured by these imports.</p>
