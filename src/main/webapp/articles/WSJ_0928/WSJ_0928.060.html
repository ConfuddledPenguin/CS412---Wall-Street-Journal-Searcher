   TV Reporters Think
   They're Policy Analysts</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">All I can say is thank goodness Ken Bode (former NBC News
political correspondent) and Sam Donaldson (ABC News) were
nonexistent reporters during World War II or we'd still be
trying to figure out a way to "negotiate" with Nazi Germany.
   According to your Aug. 28 article "Test for TV: Dodging
Gulf Propaganda," Mr. Bode says that "television isn't
exhibiting the kind of skepticism it should." And Sam
Donaldson doesn't think "the media has been as skeptical as
it could be."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Since when was "skepticism" the major purpose of
journalism? I thought the journalist's job was to report the
news, get the facts straight and let the chips fall where
they may. If that were still today's definition of journalism
(which, for a change, most network reporters are adhering to)
the TV networks would not feel it necessary to present every
evening's newscast as though it were a point-counterpoint
production featuring Messrs. Bush and Hussein with equal-time
allotments.</p>
<p>How skeptical does one have to be in the face of Iraqi
tanks and troops blitzkrieging their way into Kuwait,
followed by Saddam Hussein's massive roundup of the entire
international community -- men, women and children.</p>
<p>I suppose it has become automatic for so-called reporters
such as Messrs. Donaldson and Bode to try to undercut
American confidence in any actions taken by their government,
even when taken in response to the barbaric events of the
past months.</p>
<p>As a youngster I listened every day to truly great
reporting during World War II by men such as Edward R.
Murrow, Elmer Davis and William Shirer, none of whom tried to
plant seeds of doubt as to the motives of those who led our
country against the Axis powers. It was their reporting that
motivated me to go into journalism.</p>
<p>All that Messrs. Donaldson and Bode (and a few others, to
be sure) motivate me to do is to flip to another channel.</p>

<p>I've become more concerned over the media's perception of
responsible broadcasting. In your article, Mr. Donaldson's
statement that "playing devil's advocate is the press's
proper role" disturbs me. Where did he ever get the idea that
the public is interested in his or his network's opinion
during a news broadcast? His job is to report the facts and
let the public draw its own conclusions.</p>
<p>In their zeal to beat each other in the ratings war, the
networks have lost some of their objectiveness and
impartiality. I have boycotted all news broadcasting of those
networks and exclusively rely on CNN and C-SPAN's objective
reporting.</p>
