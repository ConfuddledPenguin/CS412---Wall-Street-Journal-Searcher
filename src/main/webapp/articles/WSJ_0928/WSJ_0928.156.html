	<p class="article-leader">Teradata Corp. said it sees a fiscal first-quarter loss of
between 40 cents a share and 50 cents a share on
lower-than-expected revenue of about $50 million.
   In the year-ago quarter, the Los Angeles computer systems
concern earned $2.4 million, or 17 cents a share, on revenue
of $43 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Teradata said it is "taking a number of actions to
significantly reduce operating expense levels in anticipation
of lower-than-expected revenue growth" for the fiscal year
ending June 30. Some of these actions will result in a
"modest" first-quarter charge, the company said.</p>
<p>"We intend to reduce our operating expenses . . .
sufficiently to provide year-over-year earnings growth" in
fiscal year 1991, Teradata said. This year, the company had
net income of $16.3 million, or $1.15 a share.</p>
<p>Teradata attributed the revenue shortfall to slow sales in
Germany and Europe, including postponement of purchases by a
large European customer. The company said orders had been
disappointing from bank customers, particularly in the
Northeast.</p>
