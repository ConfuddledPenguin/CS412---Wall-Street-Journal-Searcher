	<p class="article-leader">With stock prices drifting lower almost daily, an
increasing number of investors are trying to cash in by
"selling short."
   That's a strategy for making money on bad news. Instead of
buying a stock and hoping that the price will rise, short
sellers borrow a stock and immediately sell it, hoping the
price will decline. Eventually, these "shorts" have to buy
shares to replace the ones they borrowed, but if the price
drops enough in the meantime, they make a profit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Some short sellers "are making a great deal of money" in
the current market, says Hugo Quackenbush, senior vice
president at Charles Schwab & Co. The discount brokerage firm
reports that its number of shares of stock borrowed, an
indicator of short selling, is up 15% since July.
"Sophisticated investors are shorting more stocks," says Mr.
Quackenbush.</p>
<p>Short selling isn't for everyone, however. The danger is
that the price of the stock will rise instead fall, causing
investors to lose money -- and the size of the loss is
potentially unlimited. If, for instance, an investor shorts a
stock at $20 and it rises instead to $100 or $200, the
investor will eventually have to "cover" the short sale by
purchasing the stock at the higher price.</p>
<p>That makes short selling especially risky in volatile
markets, when stock prices are moving up and down sharply.
Even now, at a time when the direction of prices has been
mostly down, some advisers see danger.</p>
<p>Stan Weinstein, editor of the Professional Tape Reader, a
Hollywood, Fla., newsletter, says it doesn't make sense "to
do aggressive shorting" after a 500-point decline in the
market. "There are bound to be some oversold rallies in this
bear market," he says, advising would-be short sellers to
wait until the market moves higher.</p>
<p>The nature of short selling also eliminates a usual
benefit of stocks -- receiving a dividend. Indeed, dividends
are an additional expense because the short seller must pay
any dividends that the company declares to the person he
borrowed the stock from.</p>
<p>Still a number of investment professionals say that short
selling can be worth a try for someone willing to take the
risks, do the homework, and stay on top of daily
developments. "Selling short makes fantastic money in down
markets," says Neil Dolinsky, a portfolio manager at C.C.
Dunnavan & Co., a Minneapolis money management firm.</p>
<p>"We always say the trend is your friend," says John
Brooks, a technical analyst at Davis Mendel & Regenstein, an
Atlanta brokerage firm. "Well the trend is down, and
{investors} should go with the flow -- at least for part of
their portfolio."</p>
<p>Mr. Brooks suggests looking for short-sale candidates
among companies with weak earnings, heavy insider selling and
share prices below their 200-day moving averages. "In this
kind of market, the weak get weaker. You will have plenty of
candidates. Very few fish will swim upstream," Mr. Brooks
says.</p>
<p>Sifting through the short-sale candidates requires
investors to do more of their own research than if they were
looking for stocks to buy, or "go long," says Michael Murphy,
editor of Overpriced Stock Service, a San Francisco short
selling newsletter. "On the long side, companies, brokerage
firms, public relations agencies and investment bankers will
give you all kinds of help in finding underpriced stocks."
But on the short side, "they will give you no help."</p>
<p>But that's also a plus, Mr. Murphy says. Instead of
competing with thousands of analysts, brokers and money
managers searching for underpriced stocks, individuals are
operating in "a relatively inefficient part of the stock
market" competing with a small group of short selling pros,
he says.</p>
<p>For those who want try to make some money on the short
side, here are some tips on minimizing the risks involved:</p>
<p>DON'T GO OVERBOARD. Mr. Murphy recommends that individual
investors devote only a small percentage of their capital to
short selling. Mr. Weinstein suggests that investors
diversify their short sales with six to 10 different stocks.</p>
<p>LIMIT LOSSES. To reduce the potential loss if the price of
a shorted stock goes up instead of down, some pros suggest
"stop-buy" orders. These are instructions to your broker to
buy the stock when it reaches a price of, say 10% to 25% over
the price you shorted the stock at. "You have to be able to
protect yourself if the stock runs away on the upside," says
Mr. Quackenbush of Charles Schwab.</p>
<p>Mr. Murphy says he sets a 25% stop-buy order on his
shorts. "If our analysis is wrong or our timing is off, we
are better off taking a 25% loss, coming back later with
fresh eyes, and seeing what we want to do about it," he says.</p>
<p>DODGE "SHORT SQUEEZES." A short squeeze is what happens
when the price of a heavily shorted stock rises and short
sellers have to compete against each other to buy enough
shares to cover their positions. The result can be a buying
frenzy that drives the stock price even higher with short
sellers taking heavier and heavier losses.</p>
<p>In a typical short sale, brokers require investors to
deposit 50% of the market value of the shares borrowed in a
margin, or credit account, to cover potential losses. If the
stock's price rises, investors will get "margin" calls to put
in more money whenever the deposit falls below a certain
percentage of the stock's market value.</p>
<p>One way to dodge a short squeeze is to avoid thinly traded
stocks, says Mr. Quackenbush. "Individuals should stay away
from a stock with {only} 200,000 shares outstanding, for
example," he adds.</p>
<p>Mr. Murphy says it's also a good idea for individual
investors to avoid trying to short the stocks with the
largest "short interest" -- the number of shares that haven't
yet been purchased for return to lenders. "That's a
professional's game -- a war between the shorts and longs,"
he says, and "it's best to say out of those contests."</p>
<p>AVOID EMOTIONAL HANGUPS. Finally, the pros say, investors
who short a stock shouldn't feel that they are doing
something unethical. "When you buy a stock long, you feel
like you've purchased a piece of America," says Mr. Brooks,
the Atlanta brokerage-firm analyst. But that doesn't mean
that shorting a stock is un-American, he and others say.</p>
<p>Indeed, Mr. Murphy adds, "By pushing overpriced stocks
down, short selling makes capital markets more efficient."</p>
