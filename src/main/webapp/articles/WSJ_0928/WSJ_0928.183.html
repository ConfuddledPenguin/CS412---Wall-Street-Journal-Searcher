	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. is raising prices on some
1990 and 1991 models by cutting the cash discounts offered to
buyers.
   In effect, the No. 1 auto maker is joining Ford Motor Co.
in a gamble that efforts to boost revenue in a slumping
market won't cost market share in the competition against
Japanese auto makers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>GM didn't raise prices as much as Ford, which earlier this
week eliminated cash-to-customer rebates on leftover 1990
models and sharply scaled back the discounts on many
high-volume 1991 models. Unlike Ford, GM left cash discounts
on most 1990 models. However, rebates on some high-volume
1990 and 1991 Chevrolet models will be substantially less
than they were just a few days ago.</p>
<p>For example, someone who bought a 1990 Chevrolet Corsica
Monday got a $1,000 cash rebate. But buying a 1990 Corsica
today will mean only $500 off the sticker price, in effect a
$500 price boost.</p>
<p>GM is raising the prices on 1991 Corsicas, too, by cutting
the cash rebate to $500 from $750. Similarly, the rebate on
1990 Chevrolet Lumina mid-sized sedans was cut to $500 from
as much as $1,500.</p>
<p>"Certainly we watch what other people do," a Chevrolet
spokesman said. The decision to cut back on rebates in part
reflects lower stocks of unsold cars on GM dealer lots, he
said.</p>
<p>GM isn't raising prices on every model. Some weak-selling
models will come with even bigger discounts. The rebate on
certain 1990 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme Coupes rose to $2,500
from $2,000. The discount on other Cutlass Supremes will
remain at $2,000.</p>
<p>GM's bid to raise prices on high-volume lines reflects
growing pessimism about the strength of the U.S. auto market.
GM and Ford, by raising prices, are signaling that they're
resigned to a period of weak sales.</p>
