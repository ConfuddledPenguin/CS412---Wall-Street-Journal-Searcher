	<p class="article-leader">In what was heralded as a landmark step, Governor Mario
Cuomo and New York City Mayor David N. Dinkins recently
announced a new plan to aid the mentally ill homeless.
Nowadays when politicians announce progressive new programs
for the mentally ill, sensible people start to worry -- with
cause.
   The track record of such programs, beginning with the
catastrophic one that "liberated" the mentally ill by
removing them from institutions that cared for them, is not
reassuring. Thanks to this grand remedy conceived in the name
of progress in the late 1960s, a huge army of severely sick
and dependent people now make their home in the streets. How
they got there is no mystery.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Public-interest attorneys and civil libertarians, rushing
to the barricades of what they saw as a great new
civil-rights movement, mounted a war of lawsuits against
state mental hospitals all through the '70s. Such advocates
pressed demands for patient liberation, and for rights
including a mentally ill person's right to refuse treatment.
The result of these efforts was the phenomenon known as
deinstitutionalization.</p>
<p>The mental hospitals emptied out while the nation's bus
terminals, parks and subway gratings filled up with hordes of
the afflicted now free to wander where they would, untended.
An army of psychotic and delusional people had been released
to a freedom that was, in effect, their abandonment.</p>
<p>The architects of deinstitutionalization now concede that
it has been a calamitous failure but argue that this is only
because of the government's failure to provide supporting
funds for outpatient clinics and group homes. It is an
argument that fails to address the core problem of the
mentally ill.</p>
<p>That problem, simply put, is that the mentally ill require
treatment which they are incapable of seeking for themselves.
All the funds and group homes in the world are of no avail so
long as residents can wander as they please and refuse
medication. A new book titled "Madness In the Street" by Rael
Jean Isaac and Virginia C. Armat argues that when the
diseased organ is the brain, afflicted individuals can't be
expected to make reasoned decisions regarding treatment. As
author Isaac told us, "at least half the mentally ill don't
think there is anything wrong with them."</p>
<p>Governor Cuomo and Mayor Dinkins now have introduced a
housing program for the mentally ill, based on the model of
residences run by Franciscan priests. They are models well
worth emulating. A visitor to their residences discovers
clean, cheery homes closely supervised by caretaker priests
and medical attendants who make it a priority to see that the
residents take their anti-psychotic drugs. The priests remove
and try to hospitalize anyone who refuses to take the
stablizing medication.</p>
<p>The question posed by the Cuomo-Dinkins plan is whether
state-run bureaucracies hamstrung by worries about lawsuits
can or will emulate the successful voluntary efforts of the
Franciscans. Those who favor publicly administered support
for such problems must answer the question of whether
government has become so encumbered -- by politicians,
lawyers, pressure groups, TV cameras -- that it simply can no
longer perform these tasks effectively.</p>
<p>The legal tangle produced by the patients' rights
advocates is such that it is now nearly impossible to commit
patients involuntarily, without offering the most compelling
and extreme proof that they pose a danger to themselves or
others. State hospitals now can hardly be persuaded even to
take people who wish to be committed, unless they can prove
they are dangerous to themselves or others. Mental illness is
apparently the only disease requiring the sufferer to reach
the worst stage before he is considered eligible for
treatment. There is something wrong with this situation.</p>
<p>The chaos in the homeless shelters and terminals where the
mentally ill gather testifies to the results. Most of the
mentally ill are not violence prone, but the segment that is
poses dangers not to be ignored. Arrest rates for violent
crimes are now consistently higher for the mentally ill than
for that of the general population. This can hardly be
surprising in a wandering population no longer in a position
where they can be given the anti-psychotic medication needed
to help and stabilize them.</p>
<p>It is clearly time to start reordering priorities and to
begin rethinking the complex of recently litigated legal
rights whose primary effect is to prevent gravely ill people
from receiving treatment. It's time to start hospitalizing
people who need it, and to recognize that creating a right
that allows extremely disturbed people to refuse treatment
amounts to the right to live in degradation.</p>
