	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Wall Street is killing the banks.
   Money managers dumped bank stocks for the fifth session in
a row yesterday, amid rising fear that the banking industry's
exposure to problem domestic loans is worse than bankers
believe.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Citicorp shares fell 75 cents, to close at $13.75, in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading, bringing its loss for
the past week to $2.875. Chemical Banking Corp. shares took
much the same hit, and fell 87.5 cents to $14.125 yesterday,
while Manufacturers Hanover Corp. shares have plunged $5.625
since last Thursday's close, finishing yesterday at $20.25,
off $1.</p>
<p>And it isn't just the money-center banks in New York that
are being bludgeoned.</p>
<p>NCNB Corp., after reporting late Wednesday that it will
increase its allowance for loan losses and post sharply lower
third-quarter earnings, yesterday was driven down $3.125 a
share to $20.125 on the Big Board.</p>
<p>"There's a real serious question of confidence in the
banking system," Jack Conlon, head of trading at Rothschild
Inc., said. "Banks have become totally disfavored by
institutional investors and are under heavy liquidation."
Another trader said this was the first week in nearly two
months that Iraq and the price of oil took a back seat in the
stock market to concern about the health of big banks.</p>
<p>The catalyst for the current sell-off was Chase Manhattan
Corp.'s stunning announcement last Friday that it would lay
off 5,000 employees, take $1 billion in charges and slash the
quarterly dividend from 62 cents a share to 30 cents.</p>
<p>What has unnerved many investors is that the latest
declines come after months of steady price erosion in the
shares of large banks. Before this past week, the shares of
most large banks had declined 45% or more since last October.</p>
<p>And as the end of the third quarter approaches, many money
managers don't want to have their reports to clients showing
large stockholdings of banks that may further disappoint
investors.</p>
<p>To be sure, some Wall Street analysts suggest that fears
of dividend cuts, at least among the biggest and best-known
banks, such as Citicorp, Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover,
are overblown.</p>
<p>"The market is pointing a finger at those institutions,"
said James McDermott, director of research at Keefe, Bruyette
& Woods, a securities firm that specializes in banks. "But I
wouldn't draw a straight line from Chase's action to those
banks without taking a hard look at cash generation and
overall asset quality. At this stage, we have no reason to
believe any similar action is imminent."</p>
<p>In any event, the big question plaguing bank investors now
is how bad can it get, said Judah Kraushaar, a bank analyst
at Merrill Lynch & Co. "The tremendous pressure on the bank
stocks reflects a crisis of confidence and an inability of
anyone to quantify the banks' exposure to nonperforming
assets," he said.</p>
<p>Prices of bank stock prices have fallen so far that many
of them now sport dividend yields -- the ratio of the
dividend to the stock's market price -- well into double
digits. But few money managers are being lured by the
attractive yields. They fear that bigger problems, and
perhaps dividend cuts, may be announced next month, along
with third-quarter earnings.</p>
<p>"I suspect you've got another round of dividend cuts still
to come," said Brett Brubaker, a money manager at Abraham &
Sons in Chicago.</p>
<p>The prospect of dividend cuts looms for many banks because
of reduced earnings. Indeed, bank specialists say any bank at
which earnings fail to cover its dividend for two quarters
will be forced by regulators to cut or eliminate the
dividend. When a bank announces a large provision against
losses for problem loans, the charge is taken against
earnings and, for accounting purposes, a dividend may not be
covered.</p>
<p>But inadequate earnings aren't the only threat to payouts.
Capital levels are becoming more important, too. As
deteriorating real estate portfolios force bigger charge-offs
and reserves for loan losses, many banks will find their
capital sagging enough to trigger the attention of
regulators.</p>
<p>While sick real estate markets have a lot to do with the
beating that banks are taking among investors, Merrill
Lynch's Mr. Kraushaar suggested that investors are looking
beyond the economic cycle to the banking industry's more
fundamental problem: There are simply too many banks.</p>
<p>"Everybody is so focused on overcapacity in this industry,
and there's no good gauge to measure that capacity," he said.
"The only thing I could foresee to shake people up on the
positive side would be two large banks announcing a merger.
But in this environment, I wouldn't hang my hat on that."</p>
<p>Still, amid all the gloom, some investors are beginning to
sense that bank stocks are approaching attractive levels.
Ralph Blair, a trader at Montgomery Securities in San
Francisco, said he saw evidence yesterday for the first time
this week that some bargain hunters were beginning to buy
battered bank stocks.</p>
<p>And while Mr. Brubaker of Abraham still is wary of more
dividend cuts, he said the banking industry's tendency to
lead the stock market both down and up will eventually make
bank issues attractive.</p>
<p>"They're getting to the point where you've got to think
about owning them," he said. "It's just a matter of when do
you pull the trigger?"</p>
<p>Frank DeSantis, a bank analyst at PaineWebber Inc., said
his chief worry isn't so much that economic fundamentals will
force dividend cuts, but that nervous regulators may press
the issue.</p>
<p>"The wild card is the political pressure of the regulatory
agencies," he said. "There's definite regulatory pressure to
raise capital, and the only thing that will ease that
pressure is if banks continue to comfortably earn the
dividend and maintain stability in loan performance."</p>
