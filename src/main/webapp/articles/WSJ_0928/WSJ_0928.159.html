	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Worried traders scrambled to sell bonds of
major banks and other financial issues as concern grew about
the fragility of the financial system.
   The search for safety drove many traders and investors to
government-guaranteed securities, sending prices sharply
higher on Treasury bills, notes and bonds. Prices of
long-term Treasury bonds surged yesterday by about one point,
or $10 for each $1,000 face amount.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"New cash that investors and money managers have is going
into Treasurys," said William Brachfeld, executive vice
president at Daiwa Securities America Inc. "There's wholesale
dumping by institutions of common stocks and debt of banks
and financial institutions because they don't want them on
their books at quarter's end, with the massive declines we've
seen in prices lately. And the beneficiary of this is the
Treasury market."</p>
<p>Treasury bond prices also were bolstered by speculation
that congressional leaders and the White House are close to
an agreement on cutting the nation's budget deficit, traders
said. If so, the Federal Reserve may react soon by lowering
short-term interest rates. The Fed's policymaking committee
is scheduled to meet Tuesday to review credit strategy.</p>
<p>Corporate junk bonds took another pounding. Prices of many
bellwether junk bonds, those high-risk, high-yield issues of
companies with low credit ratings or no ratings at all,
tumbled by about one point, their sixth consecutive setback.</p>
<p>In the municipal bond market, Massachusetts is paying a
stiff price for its financial woes. Massachusetts, which has
the lowest bond rating of any state, had to offer investors
high yields -- ranging to nearly 8% on some seven-year bonds
-- to attract buyers for a $1.3 billion issue.</p>
<p>Some municipal-finance specialists thought Massachusetts
might have to pay an even stiffer price for its financial
problems. Worries about the state's finances are widespread
because of speculation that voters may approve a proposed
tax-cut initiative in November. Bond dealers said the yields
announced yesterday were high enough to attract a mixed
reception from investors.</p>
<p>In the corporate sector, Chase Manhattan Corp., NCNB Corp.
and Bankers Trust New York Corp. were among the hardest hit.
Bank bonds have been hammered recently in the aftermath of
Chase's decision to cut its dividend and slash its staff by
5,000.</p>
<p>Some traders say investors have overreacted, that bank
bonds now offer unusually attractive yields and that this
could be a good time to pick up bargains. But they also say
there's no rush.</p>
<p>"This probably is not the right time" to buy bank bonds,
said Neil Crowder, investment analyst at IDS Financial
Services Inc. in Minneapolis. "The bonds do look cheap, but
there's a good chance they will get even cheaper soon. My
sense is there are so many people who want to get out of them
right now that buying would be almost like stepping in front
of a freight train."</p>
<p>The bank bond market "is very thin, and a lot of names are
being hurt," said Richard Barnett, a corporate bond analyst
at Mabon Nugent & Co. "The buyers are few and far between,
and there are very few bids left in the Street."</p>
<p>While banking and financial-sector issues continue to be
punished, traders say investor skittishness has spread to
other sectors, forcing yields higher on long-term bonds of
high-rated industrial corporations.</p>
<p>"Customers look at the marketplace and perceive heightened
corporate credit risk in a recessionary environment," said
James Quigley, head of syndicate at Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>Treasury securities were star performers amid growing
worries about the banking system.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year bonds jumped to 97 6/32 from 96 5/32
Wednesday. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction
to prices, fell to 9.01% from 9.13%.</p>
<p>Short-term Treasury bills, known as the safest and
stodgiest investments, also are enjoying growing popularity.
Prices rose again yesterday, and yields fell. The
bond-equivalent yield on the latest six-month bill fell to
7.55%, down about 0.15 percentage point from Wednesday. The
discount rate on these bills ended at 7.20% bid.</p>
<p>The Treasury's new two-year notes, auctioned Tuesday by
the government at an average annual yield of 8.18%, were
quoted late yesterday at 8.02%. The new four-year notes, sold
Wednesday at an average yield of 8.53%, were quoted at 8.40%.</p>
<p>Rumors that budget negotiators in Washington were close to
an accord helped drive Treasurys, traders said, though many
of them remained skeptical.</p>
<p>"The old saw is `Buy the rumor, sell the fact,'" said Joel
Naroff, senior economist at First Fidelity Bank in
Philadelphia. "That's what people are doing" in buying
government bonds despite the absence of concrete results in
the budget process, he said.</p>
<p>Municipal Bonds</p>
<p>The huge Massachusetts issue occupied center stage in the
tax-free market.</p>
<p>The state offered yields ranging as high as 7.97% for
bonds due in 1997, a reflection of its financial troubles. By
contrast, Maryland, which has a triple-A rating, sold
seven-year bonds this week at a yield about 1.5 percentage
points below that on comparable Massachusetts securities.</p>
<p>Massachusetts paid a rate for the term bonds comparable
with those on bonds sold by issuers such as New York City,
whose finances also are making many investors increasingly
nervous.</p>
<p>Analysts said the $1.3 billion Massachusetts issue
appeared get a mixed reception from investors.</p>
<p>Underwriters were able to restructure the issue late in
the day to lower the yield on the bonds maturing in 1997 to
7.97% from the 8% tentatively set earlier. But Massachusetts
also changed the composition of the issue -- moving bonds
from the longest maturity in 1997 to shorter maturities --
because of what some analysts said were difficulties in
selling many of the seven-year bonds.</p>
<p>The Massachusetts issue also includes bonds secured by
letters of credit.</p>
<p>Underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets said
they were pleased with investor reaction. "Very successful,"
said Dennis Boyle, a managing director at Merrill.</p>
<p>Some investment managers decided against buying the new
bonds partly because Massachusetts faces the possibility of
further revenue reductions if a voter initiative to reduce
taxes sharply passes in November. If so, Massachusetts bonds
could come under additional pressure.</p>
<p>"Proceeds of these bonds will clear the commonwealth's
$1.3 billion accumulated deficit, but it is too soon to
assess the effect of efforts to restore financial control,"
cautioned Moody's Investors Service Inc. In a statement
yesterday, the rating concern warned: "Continuing threats to
fiscal stability are posed by economic weakening, which has
already produced lowerings of this year's revenue estimates,
a pending court challenge to part of the fiscal 1991 tax
package and the tax-cut petition to be voted in November."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, prices of other state and local government
bonds trading in the secondary, or resale, market ended
little changed or with moderate gains. The New Jersey
Turnpike Authority's 7.20% bonds due in 2018 rose 1/2 to 96
1/4 bid, 96 1/2 offered, to yield 7.50%.</p>
<p>Corporate & Junk Bonds
</p>
<p>The corporate bond market, battered by heavy selling in
banking and financial issues, experienced broad declines as
investors scrambled to sell bonds amid rising concerns about
a weakening economy.</p>
<p>Corporate junk bond prices also tumbled. Salomon Brothers
Inc.'s daily high-yield index showed a price decline for the
sixth day in a row and the 12th time in 13 trading days.</p>
<p>Among corporate issues most affected were those of
Marriott Corp. and Unisys. Unisys said it would suspend its
25-cent quarterly dividend on its common, and Marriott
reported sharply lower third-quarter earnings.</p>
<p>Yields on some bonds of the two companies jumped about
half a percentage point. Unisys 10 3/4% debentures due in
1995 finished the day at 13.50%, up from 13% late Wednesday,
and Marriott's 8 7/8% senior notes due in 1997 also ended at
13.50%, up from 13%.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the already bruised bank sector continued to
deteriorate amid further signs of difficulties at large
banks. Traders said bonds from such companies as Bankers
Trust New York and NCNB came under pressure. Also hurt were
the already deeply depressed bonds of Chase Manhattan.</p>
<p>Chase's 10% subordinated notes due in 1999 fell two points
to 74 1/8. Bankers Trust New York's 9.50% subordinated notes,
maturing in 2000, dropped 1 5/8 to 90 5/8 for a yield of
11.10%. NCNB Texas National Bank's subordinated capital notes
due in 2004 plunged 4 3/4 to 86 3/8 for a yield of 11.60%.</p>
<p>Mortgage & Asset-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Mortgage-backed securities were higher despite the
continued increase in oil prices.</p>
<p>Government National Mortgage Association 9 1/2% securities
for October delivery were up 15/32 at 98 5/32. Conventional
mortgages were up 12/32, with Federal National Mortgage
Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. gold 9 1/2%
certificates for October delivery at 98 12/32 and 98 18/32,
respectively.</p>
<p>On the New York Mercantile Exchange, November crude oil
futures reached a record of $40.10 a barrel around midday and
closed at $39.54, up 87 cents a barrel.</p>
<p>Despite the sharp increase in the oil market, the
fixed-income markets have shown new signs of life. Traders
cited optimism about a solution to the budget deficit and the
prospect of an impending easing in interest rates by the Fed
as possible reasons, as well as the collapse in the banking
and finance sectors of the corporate bond market.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>British and German government bond prices finished little
changed, while Japanese bonds inched higher.</p>
<p>In Tokyo, traders were encouraged by the U.S. decision to
sell five million barrels of oil from its Strategic Petroleum
Reserve to try to contain surging oil prices. Japan's
benchmark issue No. 119, the 4.8% bonds due 1999, rose on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange to 80.68 from 80.63 Wednesday. The yield
fell to 8.69% from 8.71%.</p>
<p>In London, traders said investors remain worried about
inflation and are moving money into shorter-term securities,
which offer exceptionally high yields. Some short-term U.K.
issues now yield more than 14 1/4%.</p>
<p>Britain's 11 3/4% issue due 1991 rose 1/32 to 99 5/32 to
yield 14.27%. Among long-term issues, the 11 3/4% bonds due
2003/2007 finished unchanged at 99 2/32 to yield 11.87%.</p>
