	<p class="article-leader">One cold day in January the news arrived at the Cuban
Embassy in Moscow: The Soviet government had decided that
beginning in 1991, all of Cuba's transactions with Comecon
members (the now-loose economic confederation of the U.S.S.R.
and Eastern Europe) would be conducted in hard currency and
at current world-market prices. A message was sent directly
to Fidel Castro, explaining the new terms. Mr. Castro
convened an urgent meeting with his principal economic
advisers, top party officials and some ministers.
   A tense and disgusted Mr. Castro said that the Soviets
would now join the capitalist countries in the exploitation
of the underdeveloped countries, and of course of Cuba. "We
have to discuss and convince them to concede special prices
and special terms of trade," he said. "But in the meantime we
have to be prepared for the worst: a virtual blockade of Cuba
-- now from our traditional friends."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>During Fidel Castro's 31-year reign, Soviet economic
assistance to Cuba has become the most important source of
supplies and financial support for his regime. More than
that, the trend and level of Soviet aid actually determine
the level of the Cuban economy. There are problems in trying
to determine the exact value of Soviet aid to Cuba in dollar
terms. The ruble has no real exchange rate vs. the dollar,
and Cuba has been applying an outdated price system
established in 1981. Thus, we can calculate only very rough
estimates in dollar terms. Because the Cuban gross national
product is undervalued, I would argue that Soviet assistance
represents about 25% of the Cuban economy -- less than other
estimates. Still, it's fair to say that without Soviet aid it
would be almost impossible for the Castro regime to survive.</p>
<p>However difficult it is to fix an exact dollar amount on
Soviet aid to Cuba, the methods of delivery of Soviet aid and
how those delivery channels are being affected by changing
Soviet attitudes can be charted.</p>
<p>-- The first and main source of Soviet aid is channeled
through so-called direct "commercial aid." This heading
refers to the preferential prices the Soviet Union pays for
the principal exports of Cuba -- raw sugar, citrus fruits and
nickel. These products receive higher prices than the current
world-market level. Of course, the main product is raw sugar,
for which the Soviets agreed to pay 950 rubles a ton in
1988-90.</p>
<p>Cuba is supposed to deliver 4.4 million tons of sugar a
year. In fact, it has been unable to deliver this allotment
for the past three years because of inefficient domestic
production. This has forced Cuba to purchase large quantities
of sugar in the world market and deliver it to the Soviets.
Cuba also has been unable to fulfill the export agreements of
citrus and, on a minor scale, nickel.</p>
<p>In a 1989 meeting at which I was present, the export
situation was revised (realistically), and Mr. Castro was
infuriated, blaming some ministers and top production
officials for the failure. He demanded unrealistic
achievements and set new, impossible goals. Such unrealistic
planning is an endless source of frustration for the Soviets.</p>
<p>-- One area of Soviet support of Cuba likely to be
affected by current events in the Middle East is the
re-export concessions of crude oil and oil products. During
the past five or six years, Cuba re-exported substantial
quantities of Soviet oil through Soviet organizations, thus
obtaining additional "income" in hard currency. From 1985-88,
this channel represented one of the main sources of hard
currency -- in some years even more than the sugar crop. At
its peak, revenue from this channel amounted to $500 million
dollars. If the crisis in Iraq continues to lead to a
shortage of world crude oil, the Soviets are likely to cut
back substantially on Cuba's allotment.</p>
<p>-- Another channel of Soviet aid to Cuba consists of the
supply of products previously bought by the Soviets for hard
currency abroad and later delivered to Cuba, payable in
rubles. For example, this applies to wheat flour regularly
purchased in Canada and directly sent to Cuba.</p>
<p>-- Direct financial aid to Cuba covering the deficit of
the trade balance amounts to 2.5 billion rubles on a
five-year basis. In the 1985-90 period this sum was not
sufficient and Cuba asked for -- and received --
supplementary aid. The same amount has been allocated to
finance new projects and capital investments on a five-year
basis (in the past, such investments rarely proved
profitable).</p>
<p>-- The concession of special or zero interest rates on
loans or credits granted to Cuba apply to what can be termed
short- and long-term support. Some weeks ago, for the first
time, the Soviet press released information of a well-kept
secret: the amount of the Cuban external debt. A Soviet
Finance Ministry release said that the Cuban debt was a
little more than 15.7 billion rubles. That leak was a bitter
surprise for the Cuban government, which refused to give this
information to the Paris Club when the discussions of the
Cuban external debt were carried out.</p>
<p>In fact, in an internal discussion in May between Soviet
and Cuban officials at the commercial office of the Cuban
Embassy (at which I was also present), the debt was revealed
to be even higher -- about 17 billion rubles. The ability of
the Cuban government to pay or even begin paying installments
of this debt are remote, and the Soviet authorities are
perfectly aware of the real rating of this debt.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, one of the points set by the Soviets before
a joint commision (established after the spring visit to Cuba
by the Soviet prime minister) was the conversion of the debt
to hard currency. Top Cuban officials reacted with alarm to
this proposal. But Nicoli Katushev, the main Soviet
negotiator, very firmly expressed that the matter will be on
the agenda when future agreements between the countries are
discussed.</p>
<p>Top Soviet officials are fully aware that necessary cuts
in aid to Cuba will create hardships. That was one of the
main concerns of A. Abalkin, Soviet vice prime minister,
during his recent trip to Cuba. He said that the Soviets
would do their best to fulfill the trade and economic
agreements, but, "the Cubans have to re-adapt to the new
situation, find a new way of associating with Soviet
organizations and enterprises and overall begin to act in
accordance with economic market conditions."</p>
<p>Until now, the Cuban position has not been flexible. In
fact, this week the regime reacted to further decreases in
Soviet aid not by opening the economy, but by imposing yet
more price controls, extending rationing of food, clothing
and household articles and restricting the sale of prized
electrical goods. An official statement published in the
Communist Party daily Granma outlined the new restrictions
and warned: "We repeat that we must be ready to face even
more difficult circumstances than the present ones." How many
more deprivations the Cuban people are willing to face is
uncertain.</p>

in June and was granted asylum by the U.S. in July.</p>
