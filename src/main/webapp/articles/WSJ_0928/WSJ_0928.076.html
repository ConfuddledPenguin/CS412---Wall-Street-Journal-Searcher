	<p class="article-leader">Scientists experimenting with rats may have stumbled on a
potential answer to the temporary baldness that plagues
cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.
   Researchers at the University of Miami School of Medicine
in Florida said they came across two surprises in experiments
in which powerful anti-cancer drugs were administered to
week-old rats.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>One surprise was that many of the rats went bald in the
few days after receiving the anti-cancer drugs. Heretofore,
this chemotherapy-induced baldness has been seen only in
humans.</p>
<p>The second surprise was that some of the young rats
receiving a combination of two anti-cancer drugs didn't go
bald. These hirsute rodents were receiving a combination of
an older drug called ARA-C, which is known to induce
baldness, along with a new, still-experimental anti-cancer
drug called ImuVert.</p>
<p>The researchers' conclusion, backed by subsequent
experiments, is that ImuVert somehow prevents the baldness
induced by older cancer drugs -- at least it does that in
young rats.</p>
<p>"We don't know if it also works in humans and, even it
does, there might be better agents than ImuVert" that would
prevent baldness in patients, said Dr. Adel A. Yunis, the
oncologist and biochemist who heads the research team that
reported the discovery in this week's Science.</p>
<p>Temporary baldness is such a severe psychological problem
for many patients, particularly women, undergoing
chemotherapy that some may even refuse treatment because of
it, Dr. Yunis and his colleagues said. Little or no progress
has been made in preventing, or treating, the baldness --
partly because there hasn't been an animal model for
experiments.</p>
<p>The discovery in the rats "opens a whole, wide area of
research on this problem," Dr. Yunis said.</p>
<p>The discovery "was a surprise to us," said William
Critchfield, chief financial officer of Cell Technology Inc.
in Boulder, Colo., a small research company founded in the
mid-1970s to develop ImuVert as a potential cancer treatment.
ImuVert is extracted from a common bacterium, called
"Serratia marcescens", and is considered a "biological
response modifier," a drug that enhances the immune reaction
to cancer. Human trials are under way to see if it is
effective in adult brain cancer, Mr. Critchfield said.</p>
<p>The Miami researchers were testing the drug's effects,
alone and in combination with older drugs, against leukemia
cells transplanted in young rats. In these experiments, only
five of 20 who received ARA-C plus ImuVert had a mild hair
loss. In contrast, 16 of 23 rats receiving only ARA-C went
totally bald. ImuVert alone doesn't cause baldness in humans
or animals.</p>
<p>The researchers saw the same baldness prevention when
ImuVert was used in rats treated with doxorubicin or
cyclophosphamide, two widely used anti-cancer drugs that also
induce baldness in patients.</p>
