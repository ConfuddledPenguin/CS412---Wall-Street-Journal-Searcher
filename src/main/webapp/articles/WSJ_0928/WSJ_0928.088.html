	<p class="article-leader">Colonial Realty Corp., the embattled West Hartford, Conn.,
real estate syndicator, got a reprieve yesterday when a
petition for involuntary bankruptcy-court liquidation of the
company was converted into a Chapter 11 reorganization.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Robert Krechevsky approved a
request by Colonial's lawyers to convert the Chapter 7
petition, which was filed on Sept. 14 by six banks. The
banks, including a unit of Bank of New England Corp. and
People's Bank of Bridgeport, did not oppose the conversion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Colonial, which is closely held, has marketed limited
partnerships on real estate once valued at more than $1
billion.</p>
<p>"Obviously, this is in the best interests of the investors
and of the company," said Colonial spokesman Tom Drohan.</p>
<p>John Nolan, a Hartford lawyer who represents one of the
banks, said that a creditors commitee had been formed, which
would seek court approval to hire Coopers & Lybrand to
examine the company's books.</p>
