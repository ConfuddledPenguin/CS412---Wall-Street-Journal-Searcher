	<p class="article-leader">In the latest front of a bitter family war, chairman E.J.
"Joe" Shoen and his sibling allies are moving to tighten
their grip on Amerco, the Phoenix, Ariz., holding company for
the U-Haul rental empire.
   In a series of measures to be voted on at today's annual
shareholders' meeting in remote Tonopah, Nev., Mr. Shoen's
group seeks changes in Amerco's articles of incorporation
that would ban shareholder action by written consent, require
two-thirds of shareholders to approve any new corporate
bylaws and institute a stock-split plan that would put
millions of unissued shares at the disposal of current
management. Also on the table is a new system of electing
board members that includes four-year terms for Mr. Shoen and
U-Haul International president Mark Shoen, his brother and
primary supporter.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>If passed, the changes would further blunt U-Haul founder
L.S. Shoen's campaign to oust Joe Shoen, the son who toppled
him as chairman in 1986, claiming that his father's far-flung
diversification program was ruining the closely held company.</p>
<p>This month, the Arizona Court of Appeals dealt the elder
Mr. Shoen another blow by upholding a lower state court's
refusal to block management's 1988 issuance of Amerco
treasury shares to friendly parties. That action tilted the
balance of power in Joe Shoen's favor.</p>
<p>The chairman's group now controls about 53% of
Phoenix-based Amerco's outstanding shares; barring any
defections, that assures passage of the amendments. "It is an
outrageous thing," grumbled Marvin Johnson, L.S. Shoen's
attorney. "But I don't see how you can keep a board of
directors from doing what they are doing."</p>
<p>L.S. Shoen and his supporters have been further shaken by
the Aug. 6 murder of Eva Shoen, wife of former U-Haul
president Sam Shoen, who backs his father. The 44-year-old
mother of two was shot in the bedroom of the family's
Telluride, Colo., home while her husband was in Phoenix
working on U-Haul litigation. The San Miguel County
(Colorado) Sheriff's Department has ruled out sexual assault,
robbery and burglary as motives, but has released few other
details of the still unsolved crime.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, L.S. Shoen has reportedly given the sheriff's
department $50,000 to defray the costs of the investigation
and hired a public relations company to handle press
inquiries. Angrily denouncing rumors that the murder might be
connected to the family feud, Mark Shoen announced that
U-Haul was hiring its own private investigator to pursue the
case.</p>
<p>The investigator has since released a report criticizing
the sheriff's investigation and calling the murder part of a
botched kidnap-for-ransom scheme.</p>
<p>"His theories are not based on reality," said San Miguel
Sheriff Bill Masters. "He must be talking to Bozo the Clown."</p>
<p>In the midst of this continuing turmoil, Amerco posted
disappointing results for the fiscal year ended March 31. The
company reported net income of $18.5 million, down 49% from
the prior year's $36.2 million, despite a 2.4% gain in
revenue to $950.9 million.</p>
<p>The company blamed the earnings decline on disappointing
results from its general rental item and recreational vehicle
subsidiaries, lower-than-expected used-vehicle sales and
increased costs associated with its vehicle-replacement
campaign.</p>
<p>Despite the drop in earnings, analysts say that U-Haul's
core rental business continues to show improvement as the
company replaces its once-aging fleet with new trucks and
trailers. "The general trend of the company is still
positive," said Philip Baggaley, a transportation analyst at
Standard and Poors. "However, it's sort of two steps forward
and one step back."</p>
