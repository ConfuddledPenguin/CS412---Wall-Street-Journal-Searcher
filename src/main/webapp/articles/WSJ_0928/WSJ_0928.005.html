	<p class="article-leader">WILMINGTON, Del. -- Du Pont Co., a chemical and energy
concern, said it will invest more than $100 million to build
a plant in Singapore for making Lycra spandex fiber, which is
used in a wide range of applications, including swimwear,
hosiery and undergarments.
   The company said commercial production in Singapore,
intended to serve Asia Pacific markets including Australia
and New Zealand, is to begin in 1992. Du Pont operates eight
other Lycra plants.</p>
