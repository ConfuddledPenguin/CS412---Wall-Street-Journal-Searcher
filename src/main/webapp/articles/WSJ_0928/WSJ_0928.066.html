	<p class="article-leader">WEST POINT, Pa. -- Merck Sharp & Dohme, the pharmaceutical
arm of Merck & Co., said it is changing the trade name of
Losec, the medication used for peptic disorders, to Prilosec.
   The company said the change was being made to prevent
further confusion between the drug and a medication made by
Hoechst AG's Hoechst-Roussel unit called Lasix, used to treat
high blood pressure. It said it received necessary federal
approvals.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Merck said it received reports that some patients who had
been prescribed Losec were "erroneously" given Lasix, which
is also used to prevent bleeding in horses. Merck is based in
Rahway, N.J.</p>
