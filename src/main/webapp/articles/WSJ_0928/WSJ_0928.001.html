	<p class="article-leader">I enjoyed two articles on Japan in your Aug. 20 issue. The
first, "Guiding Hand: In Asia, the Japanese Hope to
`Coordinate' What Nations Produce" by Bernard Wysocki Jr.
(page one), described Japan as a lead goose leading a flock
of its Asian neighbors. Equally interesting was Stephen
Duthie's article on the bitter memories harbored by many
Asians who still remember the harsh rule by imperial Japan of
its Asian colonies before the end of World War II.
   Japan's metamorphosis from a ferocious wolf devouring its
neighbors to a docile goose assisting them deserves an
explanation. To understand Japan's past behavior, one must
remember that for centuries it was a feudal country dominated
by the Tokugawa regime and the Daimyo warlords. In the words
of a Japanese historian, it was by "the edge of the sword"
that "the virtues of hard work, thrift, self-discipline,
obedience and selfless service had been instilled in the
Japanese people." And even after the Meiji transformation in
1868, the right to vote was not universal.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As late as 1918, only the Japanese taxpayers who paid a
tax of at least 10 yen had the right to vote. They
represented just 2.6% of the population. True democracy was
not introduced in Japan until the arrival of Gen. Douglas
MacArthur in 1945. Once introduced, the Japanese political
institutions have proved themselves to be as dynamic and
vibrant as the economy itself. Currently, many Asian nations
in charting their economic policies look to Japan as the
model to emulate. However, when it comes to politics, many of
these nations still bear the burden of totalitarian regimes.
Japan should impress on its neighbors the fact that
free-market economics works better in a democratic setting.
This may be a tall order, given Japan's past meddling in its
neighbors' affairs.</p>
<p>However, times have changed. The new Japan can utilize its
considerable economic weight to nudge its neighbors toward
representative democracy. If this would happen, then Tokyo
would deserve credit for the spread of democracy in Southeast
Asia, the same way the U.S. deserves credit for the spread of
democracy in Japan.</p>
