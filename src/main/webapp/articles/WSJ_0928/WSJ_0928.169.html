	<p class="article-leader">While most of corporate America is bracing for gloomy
third-quarter results, the phone industry is looking to ring
up solid profits.
   "Relative to the rest of the world," says Jack B. Grubman,
a telecommunications analyst with PaineWebber Inc., phone
company earnings "will look really good."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The phone industry's numbers, however, don't necessarily
reflect a robust performance. Profits in the year-earlier
quarter were depressed by one-time charges, labor-settlement
costs and new state regulatory structures that required
initial rate cuts.</p>
<p>Analysts anticipate earnings for the regional Bell
companies to rise 6% to 14%, with the exception of BellSouth
Corp. The outlook for the long-distance companies isn't so
favorable.</p>
<p>MCI Communications Corp.'s earnings will be diluted by the
company's $1.25 billion acquisition of Telecom USA and damped
by a higher tax rate. American Telephone & Telegraph Co.
continues to be hurt by start-up costs associated with its
credit card business. United Telecommunications Inc., the
Kansas City-based owner of US Sprint long-distance service,
is still recovering from a $72 million charge in the second
quarter related to a $42 million operating loss at Sprint.</p>
<p>Analysts anticipate MCI will post profits of 65 cents a
share, up 4% from 62 cents a share, or $165 million, in the
year-earlier period. Robert B. Morris III, a
telecommunications analyst with Goldman Sachs & Co. said MCI
will be hurt by higher taxes in addition to dilution. Last
year, MCI's tax rate was 28%, compared with the current 33%
level. "That's about a nickel a share," says Mr. Morris.</p>
<p>For United Telecom, analyst foresee quarterly earnings
slumping about 11%. Earnings are projected at 40 cents a
share, compared with 45 cents a share a year earlier, when
the company earned $94.6 million. AT&T's profits are
anticipated to be about 66 cents a share, up a modest 2% from
65 cents a share, or $699 million, in the year-earlier
quarter.</p>
<p>Analysts expect minutes-of-use for the long-distance
segment to grow between 9% and 10%.</p>
<p>For the regional Bell companies, U S West Inc. should lead
the pack. Analysts estimate that U S West profits will rise
14%, from 69.5 cents a share, or $258.1 million, in the
year-earlier quarter. U S West's earnings in the year-earlier
period were hurt by rate reductions in Colorado and a $39
million pretax charge resulting from a settlement reached
with the Minnesota attorney general's office.</p>
<p>Ameritech and Southwestern Bell Corp., benefiting from
strong new-line growth and usage, are expected to post profit
gains in the 10% range. In the year-earlier quarter,
Ameritech had earnings of $1.06 a share, or $289.1 million,
and Southwestern Bell had profit of 98 cents a share, or
$295.3 million.</p>
<p>At Nynex Corp., profits should increase about 7% over
year-earlier results, which were depressed by a bitter
strike. BellSouth's earnings are expected to be flat. High
expenditures and rate cuts required for new state regulatory
plans dampened BellSouth's profits. In the year-earlier
quarter, BellSouth earned $404.4 million, or 84 cents a
share, and Nynex had profit of $288.7 million, or $1.47 a
share.</p>
<p>Profit at Pacific Telesis Group, which have suffered
erosion from a new rate structure in California, are
anticipated to grow 8% in the third quarter. Pacific Telesis
earned $278 million, or 68 cents a share, in the year-earlier
quarter. The rate plan, which was introduced last January,
reduced revenue by $391 million.</p>
<p>Analysts' estimates for Bell Atlantic Corp. range from 3%
to 8% from year-earlier levels of $344.1 million, or 86 cents
a share. Bell Atlantic's results should reflect continued
costs controls and moderate growth in minutes-of-use and new
telephone lines, says Richard Toole, a telecommunications
analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. Mr.
Toole predicts Bell Atlantic's earnings will rise 7% to 8% in
the third quarter.</p>
<p>For the Bell companies, the third quarter is expected to
show steady growth of 2.5% to 3% in new telephone lines and
7% to 8% in call volumes. In addition, the Bell companies'
cellular communications operations are anticipated to surge
50% to 60%.</p>
