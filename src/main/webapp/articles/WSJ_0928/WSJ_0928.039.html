	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The Bloomingdale's department store chain
received court permission to proceed with a new store at the
Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn.
   Judge J. Vincent Aug Jr. made his ruling in U.S.
bankruptcy court in Ohio. His approval was necessary because
Bloomingdale's, together with the Federated and Allied retail
units of Campeau Corp., Toronto, filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy-law protection Jan. 15.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We're very excited. You can't deny the magic of their
name," said Herbert Simon, president of Melvin Simon &
Associates Inc., Indianapolis. He is in charge of daily
operations at the mall, expected to open in September 1992.
The $625 million project is a joint venture between
affiliates of Melvin Simon & Associates and Triple Five Corp.
of Edmonton, Alberta.</p>
<p>Separately, Judge Aug ruled that attorneys for the Allied
Stores Corp. bondholders committee could conduct a
fact-finding interview, or deposition, with former Campeau
Chairman Robert Campeau. The issue will be heard by a court
in Ontario.</p>
<p>Attorneys for bondholders want to question Mr. Campeau in
connection with a suit for fraudulent conveyance they hope to
file against Federated Stores Inc., Campeau Corp. and other
parties involved in Allied's sale of Ann Taylor and Brooks
Brothers. The bondholders want to recover between $700
million and $1 billion they say belongs to Allied and its
creditors.</p>
<p>Judge Aug hasn't ruled on whether he will allow the
bondholders to sue.</p>
<p>An attorney for Mr. Campeau said he didn't know how his
client would respond to the ruling.</p>
