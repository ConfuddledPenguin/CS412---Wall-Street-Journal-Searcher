	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole has
publicly paraded as a big deficit cutter, but privately has
been pressing for a half-billion-dollar-a-year tax break,
with the biggest benefit going to a single company with close
ties to him.
   According to people close to the talks, the Kansas
Republican has argued forcefully behind closed doors to
extend revenue-losing tax incentives that prop up the
fledgling ethanol-fuels industry. About 70% of the nation's
ethanol is produced by Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., a giant
commodities company based in Decatur, Ill. Ethanol, a
corn-distilled alcohol, is mixed with gasoline to make
gasohol.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It's uncertain whether the tax credits will make it into
the budget package being negotiated by the White House and
Congress. But Sen. Dole's advocacy of them has drawn
criticism, even among members of his own party. Opponents
question their inclusion in a deficit-cutting plan, and note
that they aren't even scheduled to expire until the end of
1992. And though Sen. Dole says political contributions have
nothing to do with his support for the provisions, ADM and
its chairman, Dwayne Andreas, are longtime backers of his and
are big-time players in Washington in general.</p>
<p>Over the years, Mr. Andreas, his relatives and ADM's
political action committee have contributed $81,000 to Sen.
Dole's political efforts. Since 1987, they've given more than
$300,000 to an array of Republican and Democratic members of
Congress. In 1988, Mr. Andreas gave $100,000 to Team 100, the
so-called soft money fund of George Bush's presidential
campaign that was exempt from federal election law limits.</p>
<p>Personal ties also bind Sen. Dole with Mr. Andreas. In
1982, Mrs. Dole and her brother purchased an oceanfront
apartment in Bal Harbour, Fla., at a favorable price from the
ADM chairman. The Archer-Daniels-Midland Foundation also has
given $185,000 to the Dole Foundation, a charitable
organization set up by the senator.</p>
<p>The tax credits, one for excise taxes and another for
income taxes, amount to a 60-cent subsidy on each gallon of
alcohol used for fuel. Although the credits go to companies
that mix ethanol with gasoline and not to ADM, they still
provide a boon to the company by creating a market for
ethanol.</p>
<p>Sen. Dole and other backers of the ethanol breaks contend
that the hefty tax subsidies are essential for the survival
of the alcohol-fuels industry. They assert that ethanol
production is important because it provides a market for
U.S.-grown corn, which is in chronic oversupply, and helps
expand U.S.-produced motor fuels, which are chronically
scarce.</p>
<p>For his part, Sen. Dole acknowledges that he spoke in
support of the credits' extension during recent budget talks
at Andrews Air Force Base. But he says his motives have been
misconstrued. "I'm getting tired of all this Andreas stuff,"
he complains. A Dole aide said the senator has even explored
giving more benefit to small, start-up ethanol companies, and
less to big companies such as ADM, though the plan hasn't
been completed.</p>
<p>"This is an energy issue and Dole represents a lot of
farmers," a Dole spokesman says. "Why can't people understand
that?"</p>
<p>A good number of people don't understand."It shouldn't be
in there," argues Minnesota Rep. Bill Frenzel, the senior
Republican on the House Budget Committee and a high-level
budget negotiator. "I assume it's in there because Bob Dole
wants it. He's always wanted tax breaks for ethanol."</p>
<p>"It is not worthwhile in the context of deficit
reduction," he adds. "We have probably oversubsidized that
industry, particularly since that industry is largely one
company."</p>
<p>The Sierra Club questions whether the credits are
necessary, especially given the recent jump in energy prices.
And a renegade farmers' lobby called the American Corn
Growers Association denounces Sen. Dole's maneuvers. "The man
has no shame," says the corn group's chief lobbyist, John
Ford. "He's a go-fer for Dwayne Andreas."</p>
<p>A spokesman for ADM says the company isn't lobbying for
extension of the credits, and that there isn't anything
unusual -- or untoward -- about its support of Sen. Dole.</p>
<p>The current round of budget talks is only the latest
opportunity Sen. Dole has taken to try to extend the credits.
Over the past year or so, the senator has delayed at least
two trade bills trying to gain leverage for the extensions.</p>
<p>The next move depends on the outcome of the budget summit.
Sen. Thomas Daschle (D., S.D.), for example, also is eager to
extend the credits, but would phase them out eventually.
"I've been waiting," he says, "to see what success Sen. Dole
has."</p>
