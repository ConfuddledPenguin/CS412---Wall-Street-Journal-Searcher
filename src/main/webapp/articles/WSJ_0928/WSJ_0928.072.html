	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- If Shintaro Ishihara, Japan's best known
nationalist, were prime minister Japan's Persian Gulf policy
would be very different indeed.
   Mr. Ishihara dismisses Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu as "an
innocent boy" and calls Japan's management of the current
crisis "childish." He favors a posture that's both more
reliant on the United Nations, on the one hand, but
potentially more willing to commit Japanese military force to
the region, on the other. While completely unsympathetic with
Saddam Hussein and his aggression on Kuwait, Mr. Ishihara is
very sympathetic with Arab nationalism.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"They {the Arabs} still have a sense of colonial
domination by white people," Mr. Ishihara said in an
interview. "Japan can sympathize with them. We too are
colored in a way. Japanese have a different mentality from
white people."</p>
<p>Mr. Ishihara, a Liberal Democratic Party member of
parliament and co-author of the controversial book "The Japan
That Can Say No," doesn't necessarily speak for anyone but
himself.</p>
<p>But he is one of Japan's most popular politicians. Many
Japanese admire his outspoken views, even though they
wouldn't dare say such radical things themselves. In
particular, many Japanese agree with Mr. Ishihara that Japan
is too subservient to the U.S.</p>
<p>"I'm not saying Japan should say `no' to the U.S. 100%" in
the Gulf situation, he says. But he would like Japan's Gulf
policy to be "a bit aloof" from the U.S.'s. The countries
whose stances he most admires include the Soviet Union, which
is broadly supportive of the multinational forces in the Gulf
but wants a stronger role for the United Nations.</p>
<p>Mr. Ishihara believes the U.S. was too hasty in
dispatching forces to the Gulf. He would have advised making
more use of the United Nations first. Now that U.S. forces
are present, he says, the U.S. runs enormous risks. If Saddam
Hussein emerges from the situation with any part of his
initial aims achieved, the most radical elements in the
region will be inspired to try to topple all moderate Arab
regimes friendly to Washington. So if war ensues, Mr.
Ishihara muses, the U.S. had better not stop at recovering
Kuwait; it had better "go all the way to Baghdad."</p>
<p>By totally subscribing to the U.S. line, Mr. Ishihara
believes, Japan gives away one of its most important "cards,"
the chance to play a mediating role in the crisis. He says
73% of Iraq's foreign aid -- but none of its armaments --
came from Japan, which could have given Japan both leverage
and a strong moral platform for playing a mediating role.</p>
