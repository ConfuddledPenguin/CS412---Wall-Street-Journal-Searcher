	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- By diverting voters' attention from
President Bush's mounting domestic problems, events in the
Persian Gulf already are having a significant short-term
impact on domestic politics, The Wall Street Journal's panel
of political experts agrees.
   "Before this happened {the crisis in the Gulf}, all the
chickens were coming home to roost -- the budget deficit, an
impending recession, the S&L crisis," says Democratic
consultant Greg Schneiders. "This has stopped the slide."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The whole international equation is a major plus" for Mr.
Bush, says GOP theoretician Kevin Phillips. "Without the
combination of Panama and the Middle East, without Noriega
and Saddam Hussein, his {job-approval ratings} would be
somewhere between 48% and 55%," instead of 75% as measured in
the most recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll.</p>
<p>The other two members of the panel, Republican strategist
John Sears and Democratic consultant Alan Baron, also agree
the rally-round fervor for the deployment of U.S. armed
forces adds up to a political plus for Mr. Bush as voters
prepare to cast ballots in the Nov. 6 off-year elections.</p>
<p>Yet, it isn't all bad news for the Democrats. The
panelists agree that the drama of the events in the Middle
East, with Democrats offering enthusiastic support to Mr.
Bush, will tend to "freeze" incumbents in office in the House
and Senate.</p>
<p>The Journal's panelists aren't nearly so confident in
trying to estimate the long-range implications of Mr. Bush's
Mideast policy, except to agree that it will turn out to be
markedly decisive one way or another. They do agree that
there is almost no chance of a neat solution in which the
well-guarded Saddam Hussein would be overthrown or
assassinated.</p>
<p>The panelists also made these other points in a meeting
with Journal reporters and editors:</p>
<p>-- Republicans may be more likely to split over the events
in the Persian Gulf than Democrats.</p>
<p>-- Whatever the outcome in the Middle East, the likely
Democratic nominee in 1992 is New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, but
he would be hard-pressed to defeat Mr. Bush without a sharp
economic decline.</p>
<p>-- And, finally, Mr. Bush is going to allow Vice President
Quayle to remain on the ticket in 1992, with a slight
possibility he might be dumped if the economy were to take a
horrific downturn.</p>
<p>Nothing unnerves politicians more than uncertainty, and
these campaign veterans are stunned by the doubts that now
engulf domestic politics in the wake of Mr. Bush's decision
to send troops to halt Saddam Hussein's aggression.</p>
<p>"It's such a high-wire act," says Mr. Schneiders. "You can
come up with scenarios in which he {Mr. Bush} loses terribly
in 1992 or wins easily."</p>
<p>Mr. Sears says President Bush is betting on nothing less
than a new world order "to create effective policy against
aggression." The administration "is stacking its political
future on the belief the alliance can hold together and the
means undertaken will be effective enough to solve the
problem in the Middle East," he says. If it works, says Mr.
Sears, the president wins. If it fails, Democrats and
Republicans will line up to criticize what he has tried to
do.</p>
<p>Mr. Baron raises the question of U.S. casualties.</p>
<p>"If we get into fighting," he says, "it will not be a
matter of losing a hundred lives. There will be serious
losses over there." He envisions questions being raised about
the fact that U.S. troops would be bearing the brunt of the
fighting. "You can already see in Congress some of this
criticism of our allies for not putting as much at stake as
we are. Opposition could develop fast."</p>
<p>Mr. Sears says voters would be especially outraged if "the
bodies come home as a result of terrorist acts against people
driving trucks in American military camps. Even a few people
killed like that is a problem for us."</p>
<p>Generally, though, Mr. Sears believes the American people
support the president. "They sense that something should be
done about it. They don't like this man {Saddam Hussein} they
see from Iraq on television."</p>
<p>Mr. Baron and Mr. Phillips worry that public opinion could
change if voters see what's happening in the Persian Gulf
strictly in economic terms. "All of a sudden," says Mr.
Phillips, "if you've got bodies coming home and it's an
economic war, you get into one of the questions that's been
so difficult for American jurisprudence in the '80s. How do
you value a life? That's going to be an awful thing to have
to explain."</p>
<p>The panelists all agree Mr. Bush needs to do a better job
in defining the country's mission in the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>Especially striking is the panelists' belief that the
events unfolding in the Middle East are more apt to divide
the Republicans than the Democrats.</p>
<p>"In the war in Vietnam," notes Mr. Baron, "we were
fighting communists, and Russia was on the other side. We
don't have that here, and Russia's on our side." What's
happening, says Mr. Baron, is that the Republican Party is
splitting along one of its oldest divides -- "between
right-wing isolationism and old-fashioned, Thomas Dewey
Republicanism."</p>
<p>"Obviously," says Mr. Schneiders, "the lack of a communist
element in this makes it more difficult for Republicans, and
the result is the political landscape gets that more
confusing."</p>
<p>Republicans are also dividing on other questions, says Mr.
Phillips -- abortion, taxes, religion, the environment. It's
happening after 25 years in which most of the divisiveness
took place inside the Democratic Party, where, Mr. Phillips
believes, "divisions are actually being mitigated."</p>
<p>The Journal's experts agree that New York's Gov. Cuomo is
the likely nominee in 1992. "Even if events developed that
encouraged others to jump in, he's helped by the fact he's
not from Washington," says Mr. Schneiders. "And he's got $10
million or $12 million in the bank."</p>
<p>Mr. Baron argues that Mr. Cuomo would run forcefully in
the Democratic primaries and caucuses if President Bush
remained popular, because "the kind of people who participate
would be looking for someone to run on moralistic-sounding
issues. That fires them up."</p>
<p>Mr. Phillips argues that even in the event of a
hair-curling recession, Mr. Cuomo would run well because he
"has the sort of neo-New Deal policies that are likely to be
salable."</p>
<p>Of the four panelists, only Mr. Phillips believes there is
any faint possibility that Mr. Bush would dump his vice
president in 1992. "You've got an international crisis," he
says. "The whole notion that Dan Quayle should be within a
city block, to say nothing of a heartbeat, to the presidency
is disturbing to people." Mr. Phillips thinks it might happen
if Mr. Bush figured he was in a close contest.</p>
<p>"The big problem is trying to decide who his replacement
is," says Mr. Baron. "That's the trouble," says Mr. Sears.</p>
