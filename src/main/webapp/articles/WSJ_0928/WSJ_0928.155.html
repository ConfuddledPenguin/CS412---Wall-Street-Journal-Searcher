	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- Bank of Boston Corp., struggling in the sinking
New England ecomony, cut its dividend for the first time in
at least 30 years.
   The bank, plagued by a huge portfolio of nonperforming
assets, said that it will add about $175 million to its loan
loss reserves to offset continuing problems in the soft New
England real estate market.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The third-quarter numbers, according to bank officials,
will be bleak: it will lose up to $250 million. In the
year-earlier quarter, the company had a loss of $125 million.
In the next few months, 1,500 employees, 8% of the bank's
work force, are expected to leave under a voluntary program
of severance enhancements. The dividend, which the bank
claims is the longest standing in North America, continuously
paid since 1785, will drop from 31 cents a share to a dime.</p>
<p>"This corporation is clearly in a position to absorb these
kinds of problems -- even if they continue for a while," said
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ira Stepanian. He added
that the bank's actions yesterday, especially in terms of
increasing loan loss reserves, "ought to give people a sense
of comfort. Will it? Probably not."</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Bank of Boston shares closed at $7.125, down 37.5 cents.</p>
<p>The crux of the bank's problems are in its portfolio of
nonperforming assets. The bank's reduction of nonperforming
assets by $100 million to $1.85 billion was due to
charge-offs of about $175 million in bad loans and another
$35 million in real estate now owned by the bank. Chief
Financial Officer Peter Manning says that the inflow of fresh
nonperformers has been slowing a bit, although it is still in
the hundreds of millions for the quarter.</p>
<p>"Their nonperforming asset total has been kept level, but
at a painful level," said James Moynihan, an analyst with
Advest Inc. "When you realize the cost of those
nonperformers, in legal fees, much less the interest you must
still pay to depositers for holding their money, it's just
astounding." Carrying nonperformers costs the bank about $180
million annually.</p>
<p>The bank has also put aside $50 million in restructuring
costs, most of which will be paid in severance packages to
the 1,500 employees slated to leave by early 1991. Bank
officials said those employed for at least 10 years will be
offered the severance package, though it won't be extended to
senior management.</p>
<p>The bank said the moves it is making will reduce its
noninterest expense level by at least $100 million annually.</p>
<p>"These are very disturbing numbers, not just for Bank of
Boston but for all banks in the country with an exposure in
commerical real estate," said Gerard Cassidy, an analyst with
Tucker, Anthony & R.L. Day in Portland, Maine. "It shows bad
loans are still flowing in the front door -- that we haven't
hit bottom yet. To keep things under control, the bank will
have to continue to eat into its capital position."</p>
<p>Richard Syron, chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of
Boston, said recently that the region's economic slide is
still a year away from hitting bottom. The concern among
bankers in New England is that another year of high real
estate exposure, weak earnings and deteriorating credit
quality will eat away at the capital that serves as a bank's
financial cushion.</p>
<p>On that score, the Bank of Boston, the region's largest
bank with $37 billion in assets, has few worries. Its capital
level is strong, at over 9% of total assets.</p>
