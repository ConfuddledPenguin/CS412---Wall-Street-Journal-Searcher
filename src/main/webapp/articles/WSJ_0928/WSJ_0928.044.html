   Dwindling Sales Trend</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>THANKS TO clever marketing, some foreign brewers are
managing to swim against a receding tide of U.S. sales by
imports.</p>
<p>For the second year running, sales of imported beers are
declining, down 2.7% through May compared with the same
period last year, according to Beer Marketer's Insights.</p>
<p>But sales of Warsteiner, Germany's largest-selling beer,
rose 28% in the first half, without advertising. Its sales
are still dwarfed by Heineken, the No. 1 import. But
Warsteiner, which came to the U.S. in 1983 through Warsteiner
Importers Agency in Denver, projects sales will reach 320,000
cases this year, up 34% from about 239,000 last year.</p>
<p>Warsteiner enters its markets with sales of drafts at posh
locations, hoping to build package sales from such sampling
at bars and restaurants. Most importers go straight to the
supermarket.</p>
<p>Grolsch has also gained ground, with sales up 12.2% to
750,000 cases through August, compared with the same period
last year, estimates Jim Gollhofer, president of Grolsch
Importers, a unit of Grolsch Breweries of the Netherlands.</p>
<p>As other imports have slumped, Grolsch has beefed up its
sales force to increase the number of contacts it makes with
beer distributors, who are responsible for putting beer on
trucks and store shelves. And the company has reduced its TV
ads in favor of print ads in upscale magazines more likely to
reach its target audience, says Mr. Gollhofer.</p>
<p>Marketing May Explain</p>
<p>Alcohol-Labeling Push</p>
<p>DOES THE PUSH by G. Heileman Brewing to require the
disclosure of alcohol content on beer labels have as much to
do with marketing as the public's right to know?</p>
<p>Heileman is lobbying for the requirement in states across
the country, despite opposition by federal and state
governments, which fear that it might encourage people to buy
more potent beer. Heileman's aim may be just the opposite.
Heileman brews two of the five U.S. beers with the least
alcohol, Rainier Light and Henry Weinhard's Light, and may
see this as an advantage in marketing to today's
health-conscious consumers. Its other brands include Old
Style, Schmidt, Lone Star, Blatz and Special Export.</p>
<p>Last month, the La Crosse, Wis., brewer finally struck pay
dirt when the Washington state liquor commission decided to
require the percentage of alcohol to be printed on all malt
beverage labels. Washington state, where Heileman has a 30%
market share, was a logical place for the brewer to take a
high-profile stand on the issue. Washington is Heileman's
second-biggest market, largely due to its Rainier brand.
Rainier's light version has an alcohol content of 2.6%, while
the regular version has 4.6%. Heileman's sales, however, have
been declining there, down about 7% through May of this year
from the same period last year.</p>
<p>But a company spokesman insists Heileman's motive in
making the labeling push is that President Murray Cutbush,
who hails from Australia, grew up with alcohol labeling and
thinks the public has a right to know how much alcohol is in
each beer.</p>
<p>Other big brewers are split. Adolph Coors, which says it
"philosophically" agrees with Heileman, won't join the
state-by-state fight, calling that an "inefficient" approach.
Miller Brewing and Anheuser-Busch are opposed.</p>
<p>Brewers Are Cultivating</p>
<p>Environmental Image</p>
<p>GREEN MARKETING has become big with brewers.</p>
<p>Miller Brewing sponsors the "Sack It To Me Saturday"
citywide cleanup every spring in Milwaukee. And Canada's
Moosehead Breweries donates money to the National Fish and
Wildlife Foundation in the U.S. But some environmental
do-gooding seems to be aimed at atoning for brewers' own
environmental ills.</p>
<p>The most obvious example is Adolph Coors, which is under
criminal investigation by the state of Colorado for dumping
contaminated water from a well under its can plant into a
nearby creek. The company's water pollution problem convinced
Coors officials its environmental spending should go to a
water pollution cleanup effort, a spokesman says. As noted in
the company's television commercials, Coors gave $1 million
to Pure Water 2000, which backs hundreds of projects across
the country and is run by Robert Redford's Institute for
Resource Management. The company also agreed recently to
sponsor a Hudson River pollution patrol boat run by
riverkeeper John Cronin.</p>
<p>Then there's Anheuser-Busch's $5 million contribution to
the Don't Mess With Texas campaign, a state anti-litter
project. About 40 beer and other beverage cans and bottles
litter every mile of Texas highways, says Dan Syrek of the
Institute for Applied Research. Still, the brewer's grant
outweighs its contribution to litter, he says. "They're doing
more than their fair share."</p>
<p>Odds and Ends:</p>
<p>COORS receives the first kosher approval ever granted an
American beer. . . . After six months in Tulsa, Okla.,
Anheuser-Busch still isn't ready to expand its one-city test
of Busch Cold-Filtered Draft. . . . Beer's percentage of
alcohol business rose to 56.5% in 1989 from 50.2% in 1979,
Beer Marketer's Insights says.</p>
