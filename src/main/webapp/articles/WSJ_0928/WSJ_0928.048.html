	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- In the latest sign of Wall Street's rush to
profit from companies in financial distress, Goldman Sachs &
Co. said it finished raising a $750 million fund that will
invest in troubled corporations.
   Goldman's fund is the second biggest of more than 20
"restructuring" or "turnaround" investment pools being raised
this year, according to pension consultants. The Goldman
fund, known as Water Street Recovery Fund I, is exceeded in
size only by a $1 billion pool raised earlier this year by
Chicago investors Samuel Zell and David Schulte.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Goldman figures there is plenty of money to be made from
turnaround investing. In the four years prior to setting up
the Water Street fund, the firm says it made 22 investments
of its own in distressed companies' bonds, bank debt or
equity, usually at cut-rate prices. Eleven of those
investments produced annual returns of 35% or better, says
Goldman partner Mikael Salovaara. Mr. Salovaara is managing
the new fund.</p>
<p>In a memo to investors, the Water Street fund states that
it is seeking annual returns of 25% to 35%. If that goal is
achieved, Goldman will benefit richly. Goldman has $100
million of its own money in the fund; it also is entitled to
as much as 20% of the profits earned by its other investors,
which include corporate pension funds, university endowments
and foreign banks, mostly Japanese.</p>
<p>Running the Water Street fund, however, may clash with
Goldman's reputation of doing friendly work for blue-chip
clients. Turnaround investing often requires tough tactics,
such as pressuring managers of ailing companies to quit or
liquidate their businesses.</p>
<p>In its investors' memo, however, Goldman itself notes that
conflicts of interest with existing clients may limit
Goldman's ability to pursue some investments.</p>
<p>In previous investing for its own account, Goldman scored
a coup in 1988 and 1989 by buying junk bonds of Fruehauf
Corp. at 60 cents on the dollar. Goldman successfully pressed
Fruehauf to sell its major trailer-making unit and was able
to cash out its bond position at nearly 90 cents on the
dollar.</p>

<p>One of Goldman's best-known turnaround plays, however, has
backfired. The firm in early 1989 bought a one-third equity
stake in Wheeling-Pittsburgh Corp., a steelmaker operating
under bankruptcy-law protection. Goldman paid $8 a share; the
stock currently trades at $3.50. "We made a mistake," Mr.
Salovaara concedes. Goldman should have bought debt in
Wheeling-Pittsburgh first, before buying equity, he says.</p>
<p>In the past few months, Mr. Salovaara says, Goldman has
already invested $195 million of the Water Street fund,
primarily buying junk bonds at 40% to 50% of their face
value.</p>
<p>Both the U.S. economy and the market for distressed
companies' securities probably have "a ways further to go
down," Mr. Salovaara says. But he contends that by careful
buying, he can pick out profitable investments even in a
slumping market.</p>
<p>Others aren't so sure. Former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
mergers chief Leon Black, who this summer raised a $400
million fund that can make turnaround investments, says he is
inclined to wait six to nine months before putting much of
his money to work. With oil prices soaring, the economy
weakening, and bank stocks in free-fall, "it's pretty scary
now," Mr. Black says.</p>
