	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Agriculture Department, seeking to meet
the competitive challenge of the European Community, said it
will for the first time subsidize the sale of wheat flour to
the Soviet Union.
   The U.S. is prepared to offer export subsidies on 500,000
metric tons of flour under the department's Export
Enhancement Program, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter
said. If the Soviets take advantage of the offer, the
business could keep U.S. flour mills busy for many months.
What's more, a 500,000 metric-ton sale, comparable to about
700,000 metric tons of wheat, would help boost sagging wheat
futures prices, according to industry officials and market
analysts.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The department has been going to unprecedented lengths
lately to counter export subsidies being offered by France
and other EC countries at a time of bumper grain crops, huge
stockpiles and weak export demand. Earlier this month,
so-called U.S. export bonuses topped $50 a ton for the first
time, but that still was far short of the $150-a-ton French
subsidies.</p>
<p>Under the Export Enhancement Program, exporters sell wheat
and other commodities at the world-market price and collect
bonuses in the form of surplus, government-owned commodities.
The bonuses make up the difference between higher U.S. prices
and world-market prices.</p>
<p>The Bush administration has been under intense political
pressure from Wheat Belt lawmakers to do whatever it can to
shore up wheat prices. At the same time, the Soviets,
strapped for hard currency, have expressed interest in
obtaining $2 billion in U.S. credit for commodity purchases.
The administration has taken the position, however, that
Moscow must liberalize Soviet immigration law to qualify for
most-favored-nation status and export credit guarantees.</p>
<p>Wheat sales to Moscow have been slow lately. The Soviets
have bought only 693,000 metric tons in the marketing year
that began June 1. "Right now we have no sales on the books,"
said Vincent Peterson, marketing director for U.S. Wheat
Associates, a trade promotion group. In the previous year,
the Soviets bought 4.3 million metric tons.</p>
<p>The Soviets are expected to harvest a bumper grain crop of
230 million metric tons in 1990, including 104 million tons
of wheat. But they are losing much of the harvest to spoilage
and are having trouble transporting it to markets. At the
same time, there have been bread lines and sporadic bread
shortages in Moscow and other Soviet cities. A 500,000-ton
flour purchase would help mollify disgruntled Soviet
consumers.</p>
<p>"That's a lot of flour," said Mr. Peterson. "We don't have
a lot of excess milling capacity. It will take U.S. mills the
better part of a year to produce that much."</p>
