	<p class="article-leader">Mr. Dorsey R. Gardner, president of Kelso Management Co.,
sent a letter on behalf of an investment group to Information
International Inc.'s chairman saying he felt the company
should be sold. The group holds a 33.9% stake in the company.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Mr. Gardner stated, among other things, that the company has
suffered operating losses over the past two years. According
to the filing, Mr. Gardner feels the company should retain an
investment banker and proceed with an orderly auction of the
business.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Alfred Fenaughty, president of Information International,
said, "We don't believe this is the right time to even
consider such a plan."</p>
<p>Mr. Fenaughty conceded that the company has had operating
losses in the past two years but he said the company did
report net income in those years due to settlement from a
lawsuit and interest income. He also said he expects the
company to have net income again for the fiscal year ending
April 30, 1991.</p>
