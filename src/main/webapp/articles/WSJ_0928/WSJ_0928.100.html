	<p class="article-leader">If the whale called Washington wriggles off the
sequestration hook, it will be a pity for at least one good
reason. Such an event would at least pierce the walls
Washington has erected around Castle Status Quo. We read, for
instance, that the federal air-traffic control system would
be the first "victim" of sequestration. Where are the holy
tablets on which it is written that air-traffic control must
be run by a publicly funded agency for all time?
   The Federal Aviation Administration, which operates
air-traffic control, has failed to keep up with the massive
growth in airline traffic. The FAA's $12 billion, 10-year
plan to modernize traffic control is six or seven years
behind schedule and billions over budget. The results are
frequent and increasing delays. Counting the value of
passengers' lost time, the Department of Transportation
estimates airline delays now cost the public some $5 billion
a year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The FAA is not completely to blame for the system's
systemic failures. It has been starved for money because of
its absurd funding structure. Revenues from the 8% user tax
on airline tickets are supposed to fund air-traffic control,
but most of the money is put into a mythical "trust fund"
that is often drained for spending on other programs.
Cumbersome procurement regulations mean that it takes an
airport four to seven years to acquire an upgraded radar
system. Federal civil-service laws lead to understaffing in
many areas and a rigid, worker-unfriendly management style.</p>
<p>There is an alternative, favored even by many of the
air-traffic controllers themselves -- privatization. PATCO
proposed the idea in 1969, and the AFL-CIO's Lane Kirkland
has frequently endorsed it. Switzerland, Britain and New
Zealand have already turned air-traffic control over to
nonprofit, user-owned corporations. Bendix and Lockheed have
long provided traffic-control services to developing
countries.</p>
<p>In 1988, Jim Burnley, Ronald Reagan's last Secretary of
Transportation, proposed creating a federally chartered
corporation that would handle air safety, much as Comsat now
handles satellite telecommunications. Various safeguards to
prevent strikes from shutting down the system were included.</p>
<p>Mr. Burnley's successor, Sam Skinner, seems sometimes to
want to actively thwart privatization. He has been slow to
advocate the changes that would allow Albany, N.Y., and other
cities to sell their airports to private companies, along
with appropriate safeguards. His department's report on the
subject is said to endorse airport privatization rhetorically
but makes the specious argument that current law prevents the
government from allowing any airport privatizations.</p>
<p>Whatever threat a sequester might have posed to the smooth
functioning of commercial aviation should convince President
Bush to take responsibility for the nation's airline policy
away from self-interested bureaucrats and place it where
someone can rethink it. A good suggestion would be Vice
President Quayle's Task Force on Competitiveness, once
chaired by George Bush. That task force on regulatory relief
accomplished much during its eight years. Look closely at
what any sequester would touch, and you'll see how much work
remains to be done on making this fat government more
efficient.</p>
