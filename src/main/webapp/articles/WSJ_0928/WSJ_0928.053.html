	<p class="article-leader">SPRING VALLEY, N.Y. -- Par Pharmaceutical Inc. is asking
shareholders to close ranks around its new managers and
directors as they try to reverse the company's fortunes.
   The generic-drug maker holds its first annual meeting in 2
1/2 years today. In that time, the generic-drug industry has
been rocked by a scandal involving illegal substitutions of
drugs for federal approval and payoffs to federal regulators.
Par and its Quad Pharmaceuticals subsidiary, caught in the
scandal, are pressing to re-establish their reputations and
get their products back to market.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Par largely makes drugs taken orally and topical products.
Quad makes injectable drugs. They have a large product line
of generic equivalents of brand-name prescription drugs.</p>
<p>The hurdles are numerous. Beginning in August 1989, Par
pulled almost all of its products off the market voluntarily
to review them. It has since reintroduced 70% to 75% of its
oral drugs and 15% to 20% of its injectables.</p>
<p>Its 1989 annual report says it is among companies that are
barred from getting federal clearance on new drugs. And just
last Wednesday, Quad was barred from doing business with the
federal government until Aug. 31, 1992.</p>
<p>Previously, Par and Quad were fined and some former
officers were convicted in connection with allegations of
payoffs to Federal Drug Administration inspectors in
Maryland. Quad admitted that it improperly changed certain
manufacturing processes. The federal investigation in
Maryland is continuing and a number of lawsuits alleging
racketeering and securities violations related to the
company's stock price.</p>
<p>A year ago, amid all of this, Par revamped management,
with the aim of restoring the confidence of regulators and
investors in its products. It retained Kenneth I. Sawyer, an
attorney with experience in the generic-drug industry, to be
president and chief executive officer. And it later brought
in various executives to oversee product quality, regulatory
compliance and research and technology.</p>
<p>Par also is asking shareholders to approve a number of
measures designed to ensure that management isn't disturbed
in its efforts to revitalize the company. The company says in
its proxy material, though, that it doesn't know of any
current efforts to take over Par.</p>
<p>The company also seeks staggered terms for its directors,
which makes it more difficult for a hostile investor to take
control of the board. Previously, Par directors enacted a
poison-pill measure, and Mr. Sawyer has the right to vote
more than 19% of the company's shares, largely as a result of
proxies he received from major shareholders.</p>
<p>Par is "highly vulnerable" to a takeover, says Hemant K.
Shah, analyst at HKS & Co., Warren, N.J. "They have terrific
facilities in oral drugs and injectables," he says.</p>
<p>The analyst adds, however, that Par still is "going to go
through some very difficult times." The company's inherent
value "doesn't mean it won't go down before it goes up," he
says.</p>
