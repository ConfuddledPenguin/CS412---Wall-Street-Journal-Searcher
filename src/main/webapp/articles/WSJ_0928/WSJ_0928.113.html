	<p class="article-leader">This weekend, the United Nations will convene one of its
most highly publicized gatherings in years: The World Summit
for Children. Largely organized by Unicef, one of the U.N.'s
more respected agencies, the meeting now promises to be
attended by as many as 70 heads of state or government,
including President Bush.
   According to its sponsors, "the Summit will focus upon
universal problems affecting children." The U.S. has reviewed
and indicated its approval of one item on the agenda -- a
proposed Convention on the Rights of the Child. Were other
aspects of the conference's agenda as carefully examined,
however, it is by no means clear they would meet with the
approval of the president, or of the American public.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The conference's main background report is Unicef's "The
World Summit for Children," an updated adaptation of its
"State of the World's Children 1990." The report does indeed
contain proposals for a number of worthy initiatives --
diffusion of low-cost technologies for reducing child
mortality, for example. Yet much, if not most, of the
report's argumentation is given over to a rather different
purpose -- to making the case that Western creditors should
forgive the international debts owed by Third World
governments in the name of the world's children.</p>
<p>Ever since the advent of the "Third World debt crisis" in
the early 1980s, Unicef says, the transfer of resources from
poor countries to rich ones has caused hardship in many areas
of the world. To protect their credit standing and meet their
international debt-service payments, it argues, the
governments of many low-income countries have undertaken
harsh adjustment policies. These have routinely included
cutbacks in social services upon which the vulnerable depend.
As a result, it concludes, "the poorest and most vulnerable
children have paid the third world's debt with their health .
. . {and} with the loss of their opportunity to be educated."</p>
<p>"Infant mortality," it says, "is known to have risen in
parts of Latin America and Africa," and "the proportion of
children enrolled {in school} began to fall" for developing
regions as a whole. Thus, "the sine qua non of a resumption
of human progress" is said to be "some significant reduction
in debt servicing" -- preferably through "writing off of most
of the remaining debts of Africa . . . {and} further
reductions in the commercial debts of Latin America."</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Unicef has suggested that
creditors in affluent Western countries were killing babies
by insisting upon debt repayments. In 1988, for instance, its
annual report announced that 500,000 children in low-income
countries had died in the previous year due to conditions
associated with the debt crisis. Yet each major component of
Unicef's argument is either debatable or demonstrably
inaccurate. Taken together, they constitute a serious
misdiagnosis of the problems facing children and other
vulnerable groups in most of the world.</p>
<p>The notion that the "Third World" is being drained of
resources by rich countries is not a new one. To document its
assertions, however, Unicef relies upon a specific set of
numbers produced by the World Bank. Those data indicate that
poor countries, on balance, have been transferring resources
to rich ones since 1982, and that the magnitude of the net
transfer approached $40 billion a year in the late 1980s. Yet
even the World Bank has discarded those estimates as
unreliable. In response to criticism from the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development, the World Bank
itself now uses a substantially revised set of figures.</p>
<p>The OECD's estimates, incidentally, indicate that the net
transfer of resources to developing countries as a whole has
remained strongly positive during the years of the debt
crisis, albeit at a lower absolute level than in the years
leading up to it. Between 1983 and 1987, for example, the
OECD estimates that the developing countries enjoyed a net
transfer from abroad of more than $130 billion (not adjusted
for inflation or exchange-rate fluctuations). The "least
developed" countries -- a group including much of sub-Saharan
Africa -- are estimated to have received a net (unadjusted)
transfer from the West and its funding agencies of more than
$50 billion during that period alone.</p>
<p>Unicef's claims about the adjustment policies of highly
indebted governments are scarcely more convincing. The most
comprehensive and reliable figures on public finance in the
Third World are those of the International Monetary Fund,
which serves as a creditor to many of these governments.
According to its data and estimates, central government
expenditures accounted for a greater fraction of national
output in developing countries in 1987 (the most recent year
available) than in 1982 -- the year the debt crisis broke.</p>
<p>The same is true of central government expenditures net of
lending and repayments -- in other words, after the impact of
the debt crisis is specifically taken into account. Even in
Africa and Latin America, government spending, adjusted for
lending and repayments, appears to account for a greater
share of gross domestic product today than before the debt
crisis. Only against an expectation of even more rapid
government growth could current spending be characterized as
generally austere.</p>
<p>What about the charges that infant mortality rates are
rising, and educational enrollment rates are dropping, in
regions of the Third World? In its report for the summit,
Unicef does not attempt to explain how it would document its
infant mortality assertions. It is difficult, in fact, to
imagine how anyone would do so.</p>
<p>To measure year-to-year changes in infant mortality rates,
one would need reasonably complete figures on births and
infant deaths. According to the U.N. Population Division,
there are today only 14 countries or territories in the
developing regions with populations of a million or more and
infant mortality registration 90% or more complete. By the
U.N.'s reckoning, these places account for less than 3% of
the developing world's population. None is in sub-Saharan
Africa.</p>
<p>That these places publish annual figures on infant
mortality, of course, makes them atypical. For what it is
worth, however, two of them -- Chile and Uruguay -- have been
through rescheduling of their government debt. Debt crisis
notwithstanding, infant mortality in Uruguay was more than
35% lower in 1987 than in 1980; in Chile, more than 40%
lower.</p>
<p>Unicef's postulated drop in Third World school enrollment
is equally elusive. Unesco's data are considered to be
authoritative on this topic. According to Unesco's most
recent figures, net enrollment ratios for developing
countries as a group have risen steadily throughout the
1980s, and are higher than ever before.</p>
<p>At first exposure, Unicef's intricate and energetic
attempt to equate Third World debt to the distress of
children may seem rather peculiar. But, reduced to its
basics, the viewpoint bears distinct resemblance to earlier
calls for the "New International Economic Order." Those
proposals, in vogue in the 1970s at the U.N. and elsewhere,
envisioned massive and unconditional transfers from taxpayers
in the West to governments in the Third World.</p>
<p>The World Summit for Children, it appears, will
reintroduce this rhetoric and reasoning to respectable
audiences in a new and improved format. No longer will the
appeal for vast transfers be couched in terms of the desire
of Third World rulers to assume their rightful place at the
international table. It will be cast in terms of helpless,
powerless and manifestly innocent victims in those same
countries.</p>
<p>It is ironic that Unicef and others should be making the
case for the New International Economic Order into a
children's issue. In its original variant, the essence of the
proposal was unaccountability. In the ambitious new world to
come, Third World governments would be unanswerable to their
Western benefactors -- and to the populations they themselves
rule.</p>
<p>There is a connection between the debt crisis and the
plight of children. The very states that request, and
require, large-scale and continuous concessional transfers
from abroad to sustain them seem, during times of financial
difficulty, to be among those least averse to exposing
children and other vulnerable groups under their authority.
That, however, is one threat to children that summiteers are
unlikely to hear about at their weekend conference.</p>
