	<p class="article-leader">With stock prices in record-high territory, mutual-fund
marketers are trying to lure investors who are afraid of
heights.
   They're pitching funds -- including equity-income,
balanced and convertible-securities funds -- that are
supposed to cushion the fall if the long market rally should
finally run out of steam. That's because funds in these
groups contain bonds, high-dividend stocks or other
yield-producing securities intended to provide protection in
down markets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But although some funds have done a lot better than others
in times when the market has headed south, investors should
be careful about buying a fund simply because of its
category. In the past, some equity-income, balanced and
convertible funds got clobbered in down markets, and their
returns lagged when the market was up.</p>
<p>Instead of relying on labels, investors should "look for
funds that do reasonably well on the downside -- regardless
of the fund's category," says A. Michael Lipper, president of
Lipper Analytical Services Inc.</p>
<p>Investors who take this advice will discover that some of
the funds that have performed best in down markets turn up in
categories they might have passed over as too risky.</p>
<p>For example, according to an analysis by Lipper, one of
the best down-market performers of the past 10 years was
Lindner Fund. It did better than the average equity-income,
balanced and convertible-securities fund in each of the six
periods during the past decade when the market as a whole
fell at least 10% from its previous peak.</p>
<p>But risk-averse investors may never have given Lindner a
look. Why? Because Lipper and some other firms that track
mutual funds classify it as a growth fund. And growth funds
typically invest in stocks that often get slammed when the
market falls.</p>
<p>Lindner, however, uses a classic "value" investing
strategy -- buying companies' stocks at a discount to what
Lindner thinks the companies are worth now, says Kenneth
Gregory of Litman/Gregory & Co., a San Francisco investment
adviser. In contrast, growth-stock investors generally give a
lot of weight to future growth and earnings.</p>
<p>Lindner is a no-load fund, which means it has no sales
charge. Other value-oriented funds that are often lumped into
the growth category include Neuberger & Berman Partners (a
no-load fund) and Quest for Value (which has a 4.5% load).
Both outperformed most equity-income, balanced and
convertible funds in down markets over the past decade -- and
delivered top returns in up markets as well.</p>
<p>"We try to estimate the downside risk in every stock we
buy, and outperform the market," says Eileen Rominger, Quest
for Value's portfolio manager. "The best way to make money
over time is not to lose money," she says.</p>
<p>Another fund that turns up among good performers in down
markets and up markets is Phoenix Growth (which has a 6.9%
load). Though invested primarily in high-growth stocks, its
managers concentrate on traditionally "defensive" stocks in
pharmaceuticals, health-care and consumer staples. Earnings
in such companies aren't cyclical, which means they tend to
hold up well in recessions. In addition, the fund currently
holds 17% cash and 13.5% in Treasury securities, which would
soften the blow if the stock market fell.</p>
<p>Phoenix Balanced and Phoenix Convertible Securities funds
(with 6.9% loads) also turned up as top performers in their
categories during down markets, according to Lipper. Cathy
Dudley, co-manager of Phoenix Growth, says the Phoenix group
uses a similar conservative, top-down approach for all three
funds. "We start by looking at the economy, then the most
favorable sectors. We then buy the most growth at the least
cost, looking for predictable earnings and international
exposure."</p>
<p>Investors interested in unearthing other good down-market
performers won't find it easy. Since mutual funds generally
quote performance figures on an annual basis, investors will
have to ask the fund representative what happened during
specific down cycles.</p>
<p>"By looking only at total returns on a year-by-year basis,
you're not going to see how well the fund performed in down
markets," says Mr. Lipper. He recommends looking at funds
that have been around at least 10 years. If the fund is only
five years old, it will have weathered only one downturn.</p>
<p>Why look at down-market performance at all, rather than
total returns? Because even though two funds can have the
same results over 10 years, they may have given investors two
completely different rides, depending on how well they did in
down markets.</p>
<p>For example, Lindner Dividend and Oppenheimer Equity
Income, both equity-income funds, had annualized average
total returns of 18.8% and 17.45%, respectively, over the
past 10 years. However, during that period, Lindner Dividend
performed within the top 20% of equity-income funds during
all six down cycles. The Oppenheimer fund was in the bottom
40% in the two earliest cycles, the bottom 20% in the next
three cycles and the top 40% in the latest cycle, according
to Lipper.</p>
<p>While volatility may not matter to some investors, it's no
plus to those who prefer steady-as-you-go returns. "If
someone were going to pick a fund and close his eyes and not
look at it for 10 years, he'd probably want a pure growth
fund," says Mr. Gregory, who is also editor of L/G NoLoad
Fund Analyst newsletter. "But most people don't invest that
way. Their eyes are open all the time, and they get real
nervous."</p>
<p>For those people, funds that do well in down markets make
the most sense, he says. "They don't drop as much, so they're
less likely to panic investors," he says, and derail them
from their buy-and-hold strategies.</p>
<p>Finally, investors should plan to keep their money in
place even if the market tanks. Those who fled the market
following the 1987 crash missed a lucrative rebound: Since
that time, the average equity fund has gone up 61.24%. "Being
on the sidelines was an expensive seat," says Mr. Lipper.</p>
