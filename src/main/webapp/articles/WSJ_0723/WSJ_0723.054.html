	<p class="article-leader">Eastern Airlines is out to prove that a company beset by
employee strife can do a quick about-face.
   The airline, seeking to rebound from an acrimonious strike
that began over a year ago, has set an ambitious 100-day
deadline for mending its strike-torn labor-management
relations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"If there is one thing I can promise and deliver on it is
that the human equation will be paramount at Eastern," said
Martin R. Shugrue Jr., the bankruptcy-court-appointed trustee
now running the carrier, in a recent newspaper and television
advertising campaign. "If that thinking is a change from what
you've experienced before, so be it. That's the way we are
going to do it. Period."</p>
<p>But Eastern still faces a rash of troubles, the most
recent of which include possible charges by federal
prosecutors that it falsified maintenance records two years
ago. Eastern contends an indictment could devastate its
efforts to rebuild. Though Eastern's pilots and flight
attendants ended their sympathy walkout last November,
machinists remain on strike, and contract talks for pilots
reached an impasse this month.</p>
<p>"It's a classic example," says Jackie Greaner, executive
vice president of EnterChange Inc., a consulting firm. "How
do you renew an organization that's died or is dying?"</p>
<p>Improved morale, for which the continuing labor friction
doesn't bode well, is critical to the airline's efforts to
dig itself out from under bankruptcy-court protection.
Service organizations such as airlines rely heavily on good
relations with employees sparking similar good vibes with
customers. At Eastern, though, passengers often bore the
brunt of hostility between management and pilots, machinists
and flight attendants.</p>
<p>Its employees "didn't give a damn about the passenger,"
says James Petillo, manager of management development at
Wickes Lumber Co., recalling a pre-strike flight he took as
employee disaffection neared its apex. "All they talked about
was . . . the company and how bad it was."</p>
<p>Eastern agrees. "If we don't take care of each other, how
are we going to take care of our customers?" the ads ask. The
company, among other things, has begun running focus groups
and seminars for employees, dousing workers with videotapes
and preparing training sessions on customer service.</p>
<p>But simply resolving to change doesn't ensure success.
Eastern's attempt to remake itself is "a long-term process,"
and senior managers "have to build up employees' trust in
them," says Mr. Petillo. "You don't do that just by saying
you're going to do that. You have to do that on a day-to-day
basis, by showing you mean what you say."</p>
<p>Employees easily sense insincerity, says Joseph L.
Mancusi, a consultant from Alexandria, Va. He recalls one
client that held a gathering for 600 employees at a New York
hotel to reassure them about the effects of some pending
changes. The chief executive "spent hundreds of thousands of
dollars on the meeting, and lies were coming out of his
mouth," Mr. Mancusi says. The company "was in trouble, and
it's still in trouble."</p>
<p>Perhaps Eastern's most crucial action was the ouster of
Texas Air Corp., now Continental Airlines Holdings Inc., from
day-to-day management of the airline and Mr. Shugrue's
subsequent appointment. That came in April, after Eastern's
creditors lost faith in Texas Air and Chairman Frank
Lorenzo's plans to reorganize the airline.</p>
<p>Mr. Lorenzo, who headed the team that took over Eastern in
the mid-1980s, quickly became the focal point of employee
hostility. With an icy demeanor and a steel will, Mr. Lorenzo
locked horns with union representatives in his efforts to
turn around the struggling carrier. Though he often has
dismissed complaints against him as exaggerated, many people
who know him say his chilly personality alienated airline
workers. Eastern "would never be able to restore commitment
or loyalty under previous management," says Ms. Greaner.</p>
<p>Mr. Lorenzo wouldn't comment, but a spokesman for
Continental says his negative image is the result of a
successful negative campaign by Eastern's unions. "The
relations Mr. Lorenzo enjoys with the employees at
Continental disproves the image of him deliberately created
by Eastern's unions," the spokesman says.</p>
<p>Mr. Shugrue is at ease with people, cultivating good
relations with the media, suppliers and customers. An open
and friendly person, he has moved quickly to capitalize on
his assets.</p>
<p>Good employee morale is accomplished by exercising
"visible leadership," Mr. Shugrue says. "I have to be
available, flexible, visible, and I have to lead, not order."
The key, he says, is good communication. "You have to tell
employees where they stand, good or bad, what's expected of
them, and how they can contribute." He says Eastern is doing
all of that.</p>
<p>Mr. Shugrue says he has met with thousands of Eastern
employees, all of whom have been frank about their concerns.
"Airline employees are not shy people," he says. He says
morale at the airline is "just fantastic."</p>
<p>Mr. Shugrue isn't the only Eastern officer making the
rounds. He has accelerated a program of executive visits that
began shortly before he took charge, now making other
officers visit employees at least monthly, says Alan C.
Gibson, Eastern's vice president of employee relations. And
as it has since the strike began, the carrier sends daily
briefing notes by teletype to its bases and has an 800 phone
number for traveling employees to get the latest company
news.</p>
<p>Flight attendants returning to work since their strike
must complete a threeday program that includes a meeting with
the airline's vice president of in-flight operations. They
also view a video called "Rainbow Wars." The airline
describes it as a light-hearted animated cartoon about three
warring kingdoms that find they work better when they pull
together.</p>
<p>Returning pilots have a similar one-on-one "focus group"
with Eastern officers, each of whom spends about a half-hour
with the pilots.</p>
<p>Some employees minimize these efforts so far. Mary Jane
Barry, who heads the flight attendants union, says there
hasn't been much more than rhetoric in Eastern's morale push.
"There hasn't been a concerted effort to make things better,"
she says. "I don't think you'll find a great number of people
saying there have been dramatic changes."</p>
<p>Such employee skepticism is among the biggest obstacles to
the success of an employee-involvement program, specialists
say. Eli Witt Co. in Tampa, Fla., installed such programs in
the wake of its own Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding in 1979,
but employees "perceived it as another program coming from
corporate management," says George Pollack, a senior vice
president. Managers were reluctant to confide in workers
about information and decision-making. The company eventually
fired some supervisors and hired new ones.</p>
<p>Many Eastern managers feel the strike was cathartic
because it helped weed out disaffected managers and
employees. "People who are here today are here because they
want to be here," says Mr. Gibson, Eastern's
employee-relations manager. The company's work force has
shrunk 40% since the strike began.</p>
<p>Mr. Gibson says the airline already is reaping the results
of its efforts. He cites measures most important to Eastern:
passenger traffic and Department of Transportation
statistics. Eastern is no longer trailing its rivals in
on-time performance or racking up the most passenger
complaints. Also, reservations have increased, officials say.</p>
<p>Still, most agree that big changes won't come quickly. Mr.
Pollack from Eli Witt says that 18 months after setting out
to improve employee involvement, "we're still not there." He
says Eastern faces a harder task. "Eastern's Chapter 11 was
bitter. Ours wasn't that bitter," he says. "Eastern has a lot
more employees and many more levels of management. It will
have to do a lot of education."</p>
