	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Citicorp said it eliminated two layers of
management in its commercial and investment-banking operation
for North America, Europe and Japan, in the start of an
effort to cut the unit's operating expenses.
   The flatter management structure isn't expected to trigger
any massive dismissals of employees, but it is expected to
result in piecemeal layoffs over the next couple of years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Rumors have been rife among Citicorp employees that about
1,000 jobs will be cut from the 15,000 in the unit.</p>
<p>Michael A. Callen, Citicorp's head of global finance for
developed countries, said in an interview: "There is no
number {of jobs to be eliminated} that has been settled on. I
know that revenues and costs have gotten out of whack. We
have to sit down with the 50 activity-center managers and
look at revenue and costs and say: `You tell me what the
correct number is.' There won't be any slashing and burning
like we've seen elsewhere."</p>
<p>Eight group and division heads will lose their
administrative roles and become, in the words of Mr. Callen,
"player-coaches." They are Rodney F. Ballek, Peter Burnim,
Michael T. Welch, Philip B. Lassiter, Michael Kelland, Ernst
Brutsche and Jeffrey Grandy.</p>
<p>The elimination of the eight group and division executive
titles is the latest step in Chairman John S. Reed's
reshaping of Citicorp's commercial and investment-banking
business. For much of his five years as chairman, Mr. Reed
has been preoccupied with the developing-country debt
problem. Only in the last 18 months has he immersed himself
in the commercial and investment bank.</p>
<p>Like many of its competitors, Citicorp's commercial and
investment banking for developed countries has suffered from
rising costs of problem loans and sluggish corporate demand
for loans and services.</p>
<p>In the first six months of this year, Citicorp's
commercial and investment-banking business for developed
countries earned $85 million, down 72% from a year earlier.
That's largely because loss provisions and other related
costs for problem commercial real estate and highly leveraged
transaction loans soared to $501 million from $149 million.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, several large banking companies,
including Chase Manhattan Corp., Manufacturers Hanover Corp.
and Continental Bank Corp., have announced sweeping staff
cutbacks. Some analysts have said that Citicorp, too, was
overdue for cutbacks.</p>
<p>Mr. Callen said Citiorp has no further plans to scale back
any businesses, as it recently did in its municipal
securities and London securities units. Citicorp, however, is
expected to concentrate its resources on what Mr. Callen has
called its "seven towers of excellence" -- foreign exchange,
risk-management products, real estate finance, transaction
processing, highly leveraged transactions, securitization of
assets and loan syndications.</p>
