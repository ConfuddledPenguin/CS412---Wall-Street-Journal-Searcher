	<p class="article-leader">Foreign ministers of 12 nations are scheduled to gather in
Singapore July 30 for a meeting of APEC, the Asian-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum, a fledgling organization with the
purpose of promoting commerce among Pacific Basin nations
ranging from Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines to the
U.S., Canada and Japan. It now turns out that the Singapore
hosts also have their own private scheme, using the visiting
dignitaries to wave a mantle of international legitimacy over
their ongoing efforts to intimidate the press.
   The government of Singapore made this plain Thursday by
issuing a 28-page press release bragging that it had turned
down applications to cover the conference from The Asian Wall
Street Journal and the Far Eastern Economic Review, and
complaining about affronts to the dignity of Singapore by
these publications and various officers of their publisher,
Dow Jones & Co. We urge officials of the other 11 governments
to peruse the extraordinary assertions in this document --
for example that it is illicit for attorneys for defendants
even to raise fundamental arguments in Singapore courtrooms.
The ministers attending the conference ought to know why they
will not be allowed to explain their actions firsthand to
correspondents of the two publications most relevant to their
collective enterprise.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>They may also want to ponder the issue of consultation
about matters so obviously pertinent to the organization they
are trying to launch. Singapore's action was taken against
the advice offered by several of the other governments, which
cannot bode well for the future of APEC. In the case of the
United States government, Singapore's treatment of Dow Jones
publications was raised by President Bush during the recent
Washington visit of Goh Chok Tong, Singapore's first deputy
prime minister, and by Vice President Quayle, Secretary of
State Baker and other U.S. officials. We thank them for their
efforts, which may have contributed to Singapore's permission
for a correspondent for the U.S. edition of The Wall Street
Journal to enter Singapore on Secretary Baker's plane. But
most governments do not, as Singapore did, require advance
clearance for press accompanying the Secretary of State.</p>
<p>Singapore's shabby treatment of its APEC partners is of a
piece with the recent contentiousness of Prime Minister Lee
Kuan Yew's government. In the past five years it has been
embroiled not only with its natural political opponents but
also with longtime associates of Mr. Lee such as former
President Devan Nair and initially apolitical leaders such as
former Law Society President Francis Seow. In a National Day
speech last year, Prime Minister Lee expressed puzzlement
over the island's brain drain, some 4,700 mostly young and
educated families having emigrated in one year to Australia,
New Zealand, Canada and the United States.</p>
<p>Mr. Lee's government has also expelled a U.S. diplomat,
closed down the local office of the prestigious merchant bank
Jardine Fleming, engaged in a tiff with the Catholic Church
and exchanged unpleasantries with the Privy Council, the
Commonwealth's highest court. It has restricted Time and
Asiaweek as well as the Dow Jones publications, but its
battles with the press are merely one facet in the broader
picture. The various frictions are those bound to arise in an
interdependent world from heavy-handed efforts to stifle
local dissent and criticism.</p>
<p>For the record, though, a brief summary of the status of
the disputes between Singapore and Dow Jones publications: In
1985 Singapore brought contempt-of-court charges against The
Asian Wall Street Journal for an editorial on treatment of an
opposition member of Parliament; the publication and its
editors apologized and paid fines. In 1986, the Asian Journal
published an article quoting businessmen with doubts about a
new Singapore stock exchange. Singaporean officials refused
to negotiate over their lengthy and, in our view, inaccurate
letters to the editor. For failing to publish their verbatim
texts, they restricted the Asian Journal's circulation in
Singapore to 400 copies; it had sold 5,000.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, Singapore similarly restricted the
circulation of the Far Eastern Economic Review over articles
pertaining to its retention of 16 individuals, mostly
Catholic lay workers, in an alleged "Marxist conspiracy." The
Review did not refuse to publish Singapore officials'
letters, it was simply punished for what it did publish. The
Review reacted by suspending all circulation in Singapore,
whereupon Singapore chartered a local union to pirate its
editorial content and circulate a sloppily printed
counterfeit version absent advertising.</p>
<p>In the course of this dispute, Prime Minister Lee also
sued the Review in Singapore courts for libel, asking for
personal damages. In 1989, the courts awarded him a judgment
of some $132,000 plus costs (including those of the firm of
Lee & Lee, in which his wife is a principal partner). Dow
Jones President Peter Kann issued a statement in New York
criticizing this decision. This statement is now the subject
of four additional lawsuits -- further contempt and libel
actions against the Asian Journal, its editors personally and
Mr. Kann in Singapore courts, and libel actions in Malaysian
courts against the same defendants and also the Review.</p>
<p>Anyone who still views this dispute as the result of an
arrogant American press should especially read the
correspondence released in Singapore. It's available from the
Ministry of Communications and Information, 460 Alexandra
Road, Singapore 0511. Except in jurisdictions where cases are
sub judice, a Dow Jones history of the dispute is available
from the Corporate Relations Department, Dow Jones & Co.
Inc., 200 Liberty Street, New York, N.Y. 10281.</p>
<p>Any fair reading of this record will show that the Dow
Jones publications have been forthcoming in their efforts to
settle this dispute, insisting only on reporting truthfully
to their readers world-wide. Our reward, predictably we
suppose, is an escalation of the dispute to keep our Asian
publications from covering not only Singapore but Asian
multinational organizations that choose to convene there. We
wish the APEC governments better luck in their dealings with
Singapore.</p>
