	<p class="article-leader">The bidding heated up Friday for Ford Motor Co.'s
aerospace unit, with a consortium led by Westinghouse
Electric Corp. promising not to dismantle the
communications-satellite and military products maker if it
wins the auction for it.
   The Westinghouse-led partnership, which includes the
French company Aerospatiale and merchant banker Carlyle
Group, was identified earlier last week as one of three
parties vying for Ford Aerospace, which was put on the block
in January. The others are Loral Corp. and a coalition of
General Motors Corp.'s Hughes Aircraft division and Alcatel
N.V. of Belgium.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"If selected as the winning bidder, our primary focus will
be to keep the business intact and to support growth,"
Westinghouse said in a statement. "Ford Aerospace has an
excellent work force of over 16,000 employees, and we plan to
be very sensitive to their needs and provide these people
with the confidence and security they enjoy and deserve."</p>
<p>The proclamation came as some Ford Aerospace employees
launched a behind-the-scenes campaign to paint Loral, widely
rumored to be the front-runner in the contest, as
anti-worker. Under the proposal from Pittsburgh-based
Westinghouse, current Ford Aerospace management would
participate in the ownership of the Newport Beach, Calif.,
firm.</p>
<p>"People here are very negative about a Loral deal," said
one Ford Aerospace executive. "They feel like it has only a
short-term interest in the companies it gets involved with."</p>
<p>Officials at New York-based Loral didn't return phone
calls.</p>
<p>How much sway the workers' concerns might have wasn't
clear. One person close to the deal insisted that Loral
already had the acquisition locked up, largely because of the
persuasiveness of its investment banker, Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. Philip Caldwell, a former chairman and chief
executive officer at Ford, is now a senior managing director
at Shearson.</p>
<p>But a Ford spokesman stressed yesterday that no decision
has been made. And a company source said representatives of
all three bidders were at Ford's Dearborn, Mich.,
headquarters on Friday to meet with the auto maker.</p>
<p>All three bids were thought to be close in monetary terms,
according to the person close to the negotiations. He placed
all of them in the $700 million to $800 million range in
cash, plus the assumption of Ford Aerospace debts and
obligations that would drive the total value of the
transaction closer to $1.5 billion.</p>
<p>But Westinghouse is the only one that would guarantee to
keep certain employee benefits intact, this person said.
Loral, which sources indicated would have to tap into a
Shearson leveraged buy-out fund to buy Ford Aerospace, isn't
expected to keep the company together should it emerge
victorious.</p>
<p>And should Hughes win, the Los Angeles company would
almost certainly carve out and pass on Ford Aerospace's
satellite business to Alcatel, a telecommunications venture
of ITT Corp. and Compagnie Generale d'Electricite. That's
because Hughes already is the U.S. market leader in producing
satellites, and trying to hang on to that line is likely to
lead to antitrust problems.</p>
<p>Hughes has declined to comment on the Ford Aerosapce
situation.</p>
