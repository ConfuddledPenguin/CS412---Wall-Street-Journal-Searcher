	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- French household consumption of manufactured
goods eased to 55.72 billion francs ($10.12 billion) in June
from May's high level of 55.91 billion francs, according to
seasonally adjusted figures published by the National
Statistics Institute.
   The state agency said in a communique that the drop was
led by leather and textile goods, but was partly offset by a
2.4% rise in consumption of durable goods, especially
household electronics. It said auto demand was also down
slightly.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The June figures fit into the trend seen since the start
of 1990, with monthly consumption bouncing between 55.5
billion francs and 55.9 billion francs. A brief exception was
seen in April, however, when consumption fell to 54.07
billion francs.</p>
<p>The relatively steady consumption data coincide with a
period of little growth in industrial production and
moderation on the import front.</p>
