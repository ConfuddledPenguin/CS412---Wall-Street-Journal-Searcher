	<p class="article-leader">IRVINE, Calif. -- Mazda Motor Corp. said it is recalling
102,548 of its 1986 and 1987 Mazda 626 models because of a
possible problem with the ignition switch.
   The Japanese auto maker said the ignition switch could
wear out after prolonged use. If this happens, the windshield
wipers, windshield washer, engine-cooling fan, heater blower
and air-conditioner compressor will not operate.</p>
