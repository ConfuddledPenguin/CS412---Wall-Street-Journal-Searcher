	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Starting up a new record label is the chic
thing to do these days, and Rupert Murdoch is about to join
the party.
   A New York spokeswoman for Mr. Murdoch's News Corp.
confirmed reports that he is investing in the start-up of a
new record company, but said the name of the company and
other details won't be released until this fall.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Insiders in the record industry said Mr. Murdoch has hired
Aart Dalhuisen, a former executive with N.V. Philips's
PolyGram subsidiary, to run the company. Mr. Dalhuisen
couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Murdoch enters the record industry at a time of
massive consolidation, but also a very healthy time for
independent labels. Even small successful independents have
sold in the past year for $300 million and more, including
A&M and Island, both bought by PolyGram. Geffen Co.'s record
unit was bought by MCA Inc. this year for stock valued at
more than $500 million.</p>
<p>Geffen, started just a decade ago, is a demonstration of
how quickly the value of a hot label can escalate. On the
other hand, entry costs for the record business are small, in
the double-digit millions. Walt Disney Co. started its own
pop label last year, Hollywood Records, rather than pay a
prohibitive price for an existing independent.</p>
<p>News Corp. has interests in newspaper, book and magazine
publishing, as well as owning a movie studio and Fox
Broadcasting Co.</p>
