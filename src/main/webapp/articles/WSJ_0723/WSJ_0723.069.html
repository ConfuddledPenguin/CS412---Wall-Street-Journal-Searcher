	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Commerce Department sharply raised its
estimates of anti-dumping duties that could be imposed on
imports of synthetic-fiber sweaters from Hong Kong.
   In a final ruling, the department recommended that Hong
Kong suppliers be subject to remedial duties of 5.86%,
compared with a 2.25% rate recommended in the department's
preliminary finding. The potential assessment on Comitex
Knitters Ltd., one of the largest sweater makers in Hong
Kong, was raised to 5.86% from 1.89%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The department also recommended that duties for two
related suppliers, Prosperity Clothing Co. and Estero
Enterprises Ltd., be raised to 115.15% from 12.04%. But the
department exempted Crystal Knitters Ltd. and Laws Fashion
Knitters Ltd. from the prospective duties.</p>
<p>The assessments, which stem from a trade complaint filed
by the National Knitwear and Sportswear Association, will go
into effect if the U.S. International Trade Commission
affirms that Hong Kong imports are hurting U.S. producers.
The ITC ruling is due in 45 days.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department said the U.S. imported $208.8
million of such sweaters from Hong Kong last year. The
prospective duties are intended to offset unfair pricing in
which Hong Kong producers allegedly sell at less than their
production costs or home-market prices.</p>
<p>Hong Kong trade officials called the ruling a
"disappointment," insisting all along that manufacturers in
the free-trading entrepot don't need to engage in unfair
export pricing. However, lawyers for the Hong Kong
manufacturers and U.S. importers are relieved that the
average potential duties didn't go any higher.</p>
<p>Bruce Mitchell, counsel for the Hong Kong Woolen and
Synthetic Knitting Manufacturers Association, said the trade
body succeeded in persuading the Commerce Department not to
let the unusually high estimates for Prosperity and Estero
send the rates for all other Hong Kong suppliers soaring.
"Otherwise, we could be facing duties of 61% for all the
others," he said.</p>
<p>Hong Kong officials confirmed that Prosperity and Estero
were penalized for refusing to cooperate with U.S. trade
investigators. The U.S. petitioners have charged that the two
companies obtain some of their sweaters from other countries
in violation of U.S. textile-quota rules. However, P.C.
Leung, Hong Kong's Washington-based economic counselor,
insists that "there could be many other reasons why a company
decides not to cooperate."</p>
<p>Lawyers for the Hong Kong side estimated that these two
companies account for no more than 2% of synthetic-fiber
sweater exports to the U.S., but American industry officials
said that percentage could be higher.</p>
