	<p class="article-leader">Supreme Court Justice William Brennan was appointed by
President Eisenhower in 1956 only soon to become the
intellectual godfather of the judicial activists. What was
called the Warren Court could as well be called the Brennan
Court.
   On a personal level, we join the chorus saluting Justice
Brennan. He did have the decency of candor in his opinions.
His resignation at age 84 is similarly honest and
clear-headed. Justice Brennan was the only justice left who
took the time to read all the appeals to the Supreme Court
instead of leaving the task to young clerks. And unlike other
liberal judges, he was not afraid to admit there was no clear
constitutional justification for much of what he did.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>His ideology was that courts can decide all issues,
whether or not they are legal issues. The Constitution
envisions capital punishment in several clauses, but this
didn't stop Justice Brennan from invoking his own view of
"human dignity" to declare all death penalties
unconstitutional. Justice Brennan's expansion of the
exclusionary rule helps explain why we so rarely convict
criminals. His creation of broad due-process rights for
government benefits locked in the welfare state.</p>
<p>It is fitting that Justice Brennan's enormous influence
extends to defining the debate about his successor. With all
the issues that our court system must confront, somehow the
biggest impact of his departure is supposed to be over
abortion. Yet this is not mentioned in the Constitution, and
even an outright reversal of Roe v. Wade would have only a
minimal effect on the actual availability of abortion. This
is a Supreme Court issue only because Justice Brennan and his
allies made it one.</p>
<p>For many years the activist view prevailed over the idea
that judges should strictly construe both the Constitution
and their own roles, but the pendulum is swinging back.
President Reagan's brilliant nominations to the lower federal
courts created a long list of qualified potential nominees
whose views begin with the certainty that Brennan-style
judicial activism is illegitimate. Their intellectual leader
is Robert Bork, defeated for the court by a smear campaign by
those now demanding that President Bush look for "balance" in
choosing a new nominee.</p>
<p>This time, in short, the fight has started even before the
nominee has been named. But the Bork experience should be a
lesson to the left, for they ended up with Anthony Kennedy, a
more consistently conservative vote. We don't know whom
President Bush will pick for the seat, but if his first
nominee is knocked out for political reasons we'd say a fine
second choice would be Senator Orrin Hatch, confirmable
because of Senatorial courtesy and more conservative than any
other likely nominee.</p>
<p>More broadly, President Bush won a mandate by running on
the clear platform that he would pick an original-intent
justice, that it's time to close the activist era personified
by Justice Brennan. The electorate's view must count for
something; the selection of a nominee is the only time the
voters get their say on the Supreme Court.</p>
