	<p class="article-leader">SUNNYVALE, Calif. -- Advanced Micro Devices Inc.'s stock
skidded Friday on a report that the chip maker posted a net
loss of $5.9 million, or 10 cents a share, for its second
quarter ended July 1.
   Advanced Micro was expected to break even or turn a small
profit of as much as five cents a share. The company's loss
would have been even larger had the quarter not included a
$6.1 million gain from the sale of its stake in another chip
maker. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
Advanced Micro's shares closed at $7.25, down $1.75.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts blamed the poor results on a shortfall of roughly
$17 million in revenue, which overall declined 2.6% to $267.7
million from $274.9 million. The decline was caused by a 29%
drop in the price of the company's 286 microprocessor. A lack
of availability of certain memory and logic chips also hurt
sales.</p>
<p>In the year-earlier period, Advanced Micro earned $12.1
million, or 12 cents a share.</p>
