	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Texas Instruments Inc. contributed to the
sell-off of high-technology stocks Friday by reporting
sharply lower second-quarter earnings, largely because of
lower prices for semiconductor memory chips.
   The company also said that it might report a loss for the
third quarter, citing depressed memory-chip prices,
earthquake damage to its Philippines plant and research and
development and start-up costs for its new products,
including its four-megabit memory chip.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company reported second-quarter net income of $11
million, or two cents a share, compared with $106 million, or
$1.14 a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell to $1.59 billion
from $1.63 billion. For the six months, net was $24 million,
or seven cents a share, compared with $171 million, or $2.04
a share. Revenue in the six-month period declined to $3.13
billion from $3.23 billion.</p>
<p>Although analysts called the earnings disappointing, they
said that a drop in second-quarter earnings had been
expected. Estimates had ranged from five cents to 20 cents a
share. Richard Whittington, analyst for Kidder, Peabody &
Co., said he thinks the company's downturn is temporary,
although he now expects it to show a third-quarter loss. "If
they're saying {a loss is} possible, it'll probably happen,"
he said.</p>
<p>The company blamed its lower earnings on weak prices in
the commodity end of the memory-chip segment of its
semiconductor business. That caused a loss at the company's
components division, which also includes electrical controls,
custom semiconductors and integrated circuits, Texas
Instruments said. Memory-chip orders increased slightly in
the second quarter, though, and the losses in the division
were smaller than in the first quarter, the company said.</p>
<p>Texas Instruments also said that startup operations and
plant construction depressed earnings. The company is
building a $250 million memory-chip plant in Avezzano, Italy,
which may be operating by early 1991, in time for what the
company expects to be a turnaround in the semiconductor
market. In addition, the company is developing a four-megabit
memory chip that should be marketed late next year and a
16-megabit chip that may be available late in 1992 or in
1993, a spokesman said.</p>
<p>Other semiconductor manufacturers that are exposed to the
commodity end of the chip market are also suffering.</p>
<p>National Semiconductor Corp. about a month ago reported
lower net for its fourth quarter, and Advanced Micro Devices
Inc. contributed to Friday's high-tech stock sell-off with a
report of its own second-quarter loss. But other
semiconductor makers not so heavily dependent on the
lower-priced chips, including Motorola Inc. and Intel Corp.,
have reported higher quarterly earnings recently.</p>

<p>Corrections & Amplifications</p>
<p>TEXAS INSTRUMENTS Inc. says it will introduce its new
four-megabit memory chip late this year. The introductory
date was incorrectly reported in yesterday's edition.</p>
