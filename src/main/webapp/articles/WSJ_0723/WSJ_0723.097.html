	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The government unwraps its initial tally of
second-quarter gross national product this week as economists
grapple with revisions, concerns about the rest of the year,
and data flaws.
   The consensus view expects that GNP, or the total value of
the nation's output of goods and services, grew at an annual
rate of 1.5% in the second period, after adjusting for
inflation, a bit slower than the first quarter's 1.9% pace.
The GNP report, due out Friday, also includes benchmark
revisions stretching back three years. The week's only other
major offering is June durable goods orders, due out
Wednesday. Orders are expected to show an increase of 1.5% on
the heels of May's 4% jump as capital-goods orders continue
to rebound after several months of decline.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Although this week's calendar is thin, there's plenty to
puzzle over. In a quite informal survey, several economists
were quizzed on their estimate for the quarter, on the most
significant positive and negative forces in sight for the
balance of the year, and on their pet peeves about data and
interpretation of the data.</p>
<p>"The weakest aspects of second-quarter numbers are likely
to be in both residential and business fixed-investment" plus
weak consumption, said Stephen S. Roach, senior economist at
Morgan Stanley & Co., New York. As one positive, he cited
auto production, which he credits for about two-thirds of his
1.8% GNP growth estimate for the second quarter. Mr. Roach
said the swing in autos is largely driven by
inventory-building in advance of a possible strike, and he
expects an "equally strong or stronger boost to the third
quarter."</p>
<p>Mr. Roach's pet peeve? "A lot of people are presuming the
consumer will stay weak. I think the consumer will snap out
of lethargy in the second half -- not for a big surge, but
for something closer to trend," he said.</p>
<p>Brian J. Fabbri, chief economist at Midland Montagu
Economics, New York, cited inventory rebuilding in the second
quarter as "a big variable" that could swing the GNP growth
rate as much as one percentage point. His GNP estimate for
the period is from 1.5% to 1.75%, which takes part of the
variable into account.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Mr. Fabbri said "the principal negative
right now is consumer psychology." He cited "recession in the
home-building industry" as a major factor affecting prices of
new and existing homes and "depressing" homeowners. "If
{homeowner} confidence is down, it could also imply that
spending could be a trickle for the remainder of the year,"
he said.</p>
<p>As for positives, Mr. Fabbri noted "we could fashion
something out of a deficit-reduction package. It would be the
first in years, and that's positive." His peeve concerns the
premier indicator these days: employment data. "It's a number
we're discovering we don't forecast well on a month-to-month
basis" as well as one that's subject to huge revisions, Mr.
Fabbri said.</p>
<p>Neal Soss, a managing director of First Boston Corp., New
York, expects "essentially all" second-quarter GNP growth
(his estimate is 2%) to be attributable to inventory
accumulation. Among the negatives ahead, he cited: domestic
demand that continues to be stressed by weak employment,
tighter credit and weaker profits; fiscal drag stemming from
federal, state and local belt-tightening; and softer exports.</p>
<p>On the plus side, Mr. Soss noted that the Federal Reserve
Bank "almost guaranteed" not to use monetary policy to force
a recession. Until recently, his pet peeve has been that the
slowdown in money-supply patterns means something significant
-- such as a slowing of banks' willingness to lend money. "It
was a pet peeve," said Mr. Soss. "But it's hard for me to
claim it now that {Fed} Chairman {Alan} Greenspan has himself
claimed it."</p>
<p>Francis H. Schott, chief economist at Equitable Financial
Cos., New York, said second-quarter GNP "might be a positive
surprise, closer to a 2% than a 1.5%" growth rate. He expects
a recovery in the industrial sector to ensure more growth
down the road. "Export orders will start to show through in
the second quarter, and even more in the third and fourth
quarter. Exports are my big positive," he added.</p>
<p>Mr. Schott stopped short of naming a negative ahead, but
cited "contingencies" that include weakness in residential
and commercial construction that "could drag the economy
down." But he countered that declining mortgage rates "might
alleviate that."</p>
<p>As for pet peeves, Mr. Schott cited the "continuing
misconception" of economists who view monthly job growth of
100,000-plus positions "as weakness." Last year, growth
averaged well over 200,000 jobs a month. Mr. Schott said the
slowing this year simply corresponds with the pace of the
economy and full employment. He added: "All the people on the
`200-pitch' may have it wrong."</p>
