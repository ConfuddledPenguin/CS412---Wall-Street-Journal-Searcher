	<p class="article-leader">Grossman's Inc. said that a dissident shareholder group
led by real-estate investors Jay H. Shidler and Robert W.
Holman Jr. made filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission naming nine nominees for Grossman's board.
   Grossman's said that the papers indicate that if elected
they would name W. Allen Doane, a Hawaii real-estate
executive, to be chief executive officer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>According to Grossman's of Braintree, Mass., Messrs.
Shidler and Holman announced their plans to gain control of
Grossman's after Grossman's rejected a plan by which the
building-supply retailer would sell its properties to the men
and then lease them back "on terms which Grossman's believed
were highly unfavorable."</p>
<p>Grossman's said that once the dissidents send material to
shareholders, it will send shareholders its response.</p>
