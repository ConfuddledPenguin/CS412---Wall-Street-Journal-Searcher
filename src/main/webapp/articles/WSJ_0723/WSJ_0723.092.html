	<p class="article-leader">MADRID -- Spain's Ministry of Economy approved the merger
of two of the country's top savings banks, Caixa de Pensions
de Catalunya and Caixa de Barcelona, creating the largest
financial institution in Spain and one of biggest in Europe.
   The ministry said the two Barcelona-based banks, with
combined deposits estimated at more than four trillion
pesetas ($39.76 billion) will be given a tax write-off
amounting to 99% of their total tax bill, or 112.6 million
pesetas. They initially sought a tax concession of 167.5
million pesetas.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Spanish government has strongly encouraged a spate of
recent bank mergers, fearing that Spain's financial
institutions otherwise may be too small to compete when the
European Community fully liberalizes its markets in 1992.</p>
