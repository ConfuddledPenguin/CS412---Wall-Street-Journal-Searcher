	<p class="article-leader">CrossLand Savings reported a second-quarter net loss of
$40 million, or $3.64 a share, after taking $50 million of
charges for, among other things, writing down the value of
its real estate assets.
   For the year-earlier period, the Brooklyn, N.Y., savings
bank, the largest in the state and one of the biggest in the
U.S., reported net income of $3.8 million, but it posted a
loss of 47 cents a share after paying dividends on its
preferred stock.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>CrossLand, which like many Northeast banks was hit hard by
the slump in the region's real estate market, has submitted
to regulators a plan to bring itself back into compliance
with federal capital standards.</p>
<p>CrossLand said that regulators haven't yet cleared the
proposal and that it will update the proposal to reflect the
latest results. The plan calls for converting its two classes
of preferred stock, which don't qualify as capital, into
common stock, which does.</p>
