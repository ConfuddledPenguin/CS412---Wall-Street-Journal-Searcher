	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Resistance against one-party rule in central
Africa is pushing up the price of cobalt, an important
strategic metal.
   In only the past three weeks, the price surged to $10.50 a
pound from $7.80 because of acute production, refining and
shipping problems in Zaire and Zambia, says Oscar Prager,
managing director of Ayrton & Partners Ltd., London metal
dealers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Cobalt is an integral part of "super alloys" used in
military and civil jet engines and in machine tools. It is
strong, corrosion-resistant and able to withstand very high
temperatures, analysts say.</p>
<p>It is "strategic" because such things as jet engines can't
be built without it. About two-thirds of normal annual world
cobalt supplies of around 20,000 metric tons is mined as a
byproduct of copper in politically unstable Zambia and Zaire,
Mr. Prager says. He estimates that supplies from these two
landlocked countries could fall as much as 4,000 tons short
of normal.</p>
<p>Production difficulties are the result of deteriorating
conditions in the economies of the two nations, says Gavin
Sanderson, chief executive officer of China Industrial
Resources, a London metals company, adding that Chinese and
Eastern European industries were buyers of scarce cobalt.</p>
<p>Moreover, skilled expatriate technical and administrative
managers left Zaire and Zambia in recent months, Mr.
Sanderson says. An attempted coup in Zambia and fighting in
the mineral-rich Shaba province of Zaire are discouraging
foreign personnel from working there, he says.</p>
<p>"The shortage could be critical," Mr. Sanderson says.
Central African output has fallen in recent years because of
depressed prices, he says.</p>
<p>But mines and refineries won't be in a position to raise
production markedly, Mr. Sanderson says. There hasn't been
sufficient maintenance to raise capacity, and they won't
attract replacements of foreign qualified staff. They fear
tribal strife if President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire and
Zambian president Kenneth Kaunda are deposed, Mr. Sanderson
says.</p>
<p>In 1978, an invasion of Zaire's Shaba province
precipitated a ballooning of cobalt's price to $50 a pound
from $7, dealers recall. The price then slumped to around $4
as mines raised output rapidly and speculators dumped stocks.</p>
<p>Prices could rise sharply again, unless metal is released
from consumer inventories or the U.S. National Defense
Stockpile, Mr. Prager of Ayrton & Partners says. The U.S. has
built up a cobalt stockpile of around 24,000 tons, equivalent
to about 14 months of world consumption, as an insurance
against political or other disruptions, officials say.</p>
<p>It is included with 91 other commodities in a $10 billion
stockpile. But stocks of cobalt will only be released for
defense purposes and won't be sold if there is a shortage in
the markets, the officials say. Meanwhile, the U.S. is
upgrading the quality of cobalt in its stockpile, and its
long-term goal is to raise inventories to 38,000 metric tons.</p>
<p>But Phillip Crowson, chief economist of RTZ Corp., a major
international mining company, contends metals merchants are
being alarmists about cobalt. Fears of short supplies of
strategic metals arise periodically, he says, but there are
large stocks of metal world-wide.</p>
<p>Moreover, the defense industry, a major user of cobalt, is
likely to cut back purchases of cobalt because of detente
between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw
Pact, analysts say.</p>
<p>Cobalt is traded in a narrow, illiquid market, dealers
say, which means speculators can drive prices up or down
rapidly.</p>
<p>Rhodium, another strategic metal, which is used in
automobiles to reduce pollution, is a prime example, Mr.
Crowson says. Prices rose to a peak of $7,350 an ounce early
July from $1,250 a year earlier because of supply disruptions
at a refinery of South African producer Rustenburg Platinum
Mines Ltd. The price then fell to $4,300 an ounce early this
week and bounced back to $5,000 on Friday on extremely low
volumes, dealers say.</p>
<p>Rhodium supplies are likely to rise in coming months, say
Barry Davison, managing director of Rustenburg Platinum
Mines, who insists that the mine's refinery has overcome its
problems.</p>
<p>Although rhodium has risen swiftly because of a temporary
shortage, the price could easily tumble when more supplies
hit an illiquid market, dealers say. The same applies to
cobalt.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:</p>
<p>Livestock and Meats</p>
<p>After the close of trading Friday, the Agriculture
Department reported that the number of cattle on feedlots in
13 major ranch states on July 1 rose 1% from a year earlier.</p>
<p>The report was in line with the expectations of analysts.</p>
<p>The department reported that the number of young cattle
placed on feedlots for fattening in the second quarter
dropped 2% while sales by feedlots to slaughterhouses were
flat.</p>
<p>According to analysts, heavy rains this spring improved
the condition of pastures, which in turn reduced pressure on
ranchers to sell their cattle to feedlots.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Agriculture Department is slated to release
a survey of the nation's cattle herd, which began to slowly
rebound last year after slipping to its smallest number since
1961.</p>
<p>Industry analysts expect the government to report that the
number of cattle is increasing slightly.</p>
<p>In the hog market, traders will watch whether pork belly
prices recover from last week's plunge. The price decline was
fanned by speculation that high retail prices are damping
consumer demand. Pork bellies are used to make bacon.</p>
<p>Energy</p>
<p>Crude oil prices soared Friday on the belief that members
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would
toe the line in the face of Saddam Hussein's strong-man
tactics. For the first time in almost two months crude for
August delivery broke through a resistance level and finished
trading at more than $19 a barrel.</p>
<p>With oil ministers preparing to sit down and talk in
Geneva on Wednesday, traders say they don't want to be caught
short in the market. Iraq's threat to discipline cartel
members who are pumping beyond their quota may cause OPEC
producers to rein in output to no more than 22.5 million
barrels a day. That level is still above the overall OPEC
quota, but far below real OPEC production in recent months.</p>
<p>Demand for the cartel's crude is expected to increase
during the third and fourth quarter on a seasonal basis,
another factor that will bring some relief to a market
glutted with crude supplies, experts say.</p>
<p>Copper</p>
<p>Futures prices Friday rose almost two cents a pound; the
September contract closed at $1.1980. Traders will be
watching to see if the gains are sustained.</p>
<p>Friday's advance was a rebound from five consecutive days
of declines, which saw the September price drop 6.15 cents.
The rally occurred despite a 15,000-ton increase in London
Metal Exchange copper warehouse stocks and a tentative
settlement of the Asarco strike that began July 1.</p>
<p>However, the stock increase had been predicted, and a
labor settlement had been expected after Asarco and the
United Steelworkers union sat down Friday for the first time
since July 3 to resume contract negotiations. Basically,
analysts said, the selling pressure just seemed to have run
its course.</p>
<p>The copper industry is behaving normally this summer, in
contrast to the past two years when demand for copper was
strong and prices were high, according to Fred D'Agostino,
president of Metal Resources Inc., of Riverside, Conn., a
scrap and refined copper trading firm.</p>
<p>"Brass, tube and wire mills this summer are closing down
for their regular overhauls, which is leading to a lack of
demand for copper," he said. "Japan, on the other hand, for
several months has been a major buyer of U.S. copper and this
has contributed an underlying support to the market."</p>
<p>There have been spurts of buying, such as early in the
month when the July contract rose 20 cents on no discernible
reason, Mr. D'Agostino said. "If that demand were to come in
August and September for fourth quarter consumption, I could
understand it. Maybe speculators see something the rest of us
don't," he said.</p>
