	<p class="article-leader">The Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that a reporter's
promise of confidentiality to a news source doesn't
constitute an enforceable contract.
   The ruling overturns a $200,000 verdict against the
state's two biggest newspapers, the St. Paul Pioneer Press
Dispatch and the Minneapolis Star Tribune, whose reporters
told a news source he wouldn't be identified and then were
overruled by their editors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a decision Friday, the court found that a reporter's
promise of confidentiality is given as a moral commitment and
that neither side expects it to constitute a legally binding
contract.</p>
<p>The court upheld a decision by a lower appeals court
dismissing the plaintiff's claim of fraudulent
misrepresentation and a $500,000 punitive-damage award. The
$200,000 award was for compensatory damages.</p>
<p>News organizations often depend on confidential sources as
part of the news-gathering process. Lawyers said the issue of
whether a source can collect for breach of contract if a
newspaper breaks such a promise is pending in a handful of
cases around the country.</p>
<p>The case arose from stories in 1982 about the Minnesota
gubernatorial race. On condition of anonymity, Dan Cohen, a
public-relations professional associated with one candidate,
gave reporters information that another party's candidate had
previously been arrested for shoplifting. Editors at the
papers overruled the reporters because they believed readers
should know the information came from a rival camp. Mr. Cohen
sued the newspapers, alleging he had lost his job because he
was identified as the source of the stories.</p>
<p>The Minnesota Supreme Court acknowledged that there may be
instances when a confidential source is entitled to seek
damages for a broken promise. But the court found that
because Mr. Cohen's case involved public officals and issues
of public concern the press was entitled to protection under
the First Amendment.</p>
<p>In a harshly worded dissent, Justice Lawrence Yetka said
the decision "makes this a sad day in the history of a
responsible press in America." Justice Yetka said the media
was misusing the First Amendment to avoid liability and that
news organizations should be compelled to keep their
promises.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the newspapers contend it would have been
unfair to rule that the press can be sued for breaking a
moral commitment when other people who disclose confidences
revealed in a personal situation, such as office co-workers
or best friends, aren't usually sued for breach of contract,
says John Borger of the Minneapolis law firm of Faegre &
Benson, a lawyer for the Star Tribune.</p>
<p>Media defense lawyers say an adverse decision would have
enabled plaintiffs to circumvent the press's constitutional
privileges. "What was published was true information. To
carve out a broad exception for contract law would invite
very serious erosion of that First Amendment protection," Mr.
Borger said.</p>
<p>Elliot Rothenberg of Minneapolis, Mr. Cohen's lawyer, said
that the decision will discourage people from coming forward
with information and that the public may be denied access to
important information. He said he planned to ask the U.S.
Supreme Court to review the case because the Minnesota court
had dangerously expanded the press's First Amendment rights.</p>
<p>Joel Kramer, executive editor of the Minneapolis Star,
said the case had prompted the newspaper to implement formal
guidelines outlining the circumstances under which a reporter
is allowed to make promises of confidentiality to sources.
Mark Nadler, managing editor of the Pioneer Press, said he
had met with reporters to discuss the issue but no formal
rules have been implemented.</p>

<p>WHISTLE-BLOWER at pharmaceutical firm awarded $15 million
in punitive damages.</p>
<p>A San Jose, Calif., jury found that Syntex Corp., a Palo
Alto-based pharmaceutical manufacturer, had fired a
gastrointestinal-research scientist "in violation of
fundamental public policy." The jury awarded the scientist,
Dr. Gabriel Garay, $15 million in punitive damages and $2.5
million for economic loss and emotional distress.</p>
<p>Labor lawyers said the award is among the largest ever in
a California wrongful termination case.</p>
<p>Dr. Garay said he was fired for protesting the company's
alleged failure to disclose adverse side effects of an
anti-ulcer drug it was developing. He says that after he
complained to the Food and Drug Administration, the company
withdrew its application to market the drug.</p>
<p>James Der, a San Jose lawyer who represented Dr. Garay,
said the jury's verdict may enhance "the attractiveness of
wrongful-employment litigation in California." He said that
in recent years California courts have been reluctant to
award more than wage and benefit compensation to plaintiffs
who allege they were wrongfully fired.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Syntex said Dr. Garay left voluntarily
after he was passed over for a promotion.</p>
<p>She said the company will ask the judge to reverse the
jury's decision and if he doesn't, the company will appeal
the verdict.</p>

<p>LAW FIRMS NEED NOT APPLY for work from the Office of
Thrift Supervision.</p>
<p>The thrift office, which took over many of the
savings-and-loan supervisory duties of the old Federal Home
Loan Bank Board, intends to handle all new legal matters in
house, OTS director Timothy Ryan said last week during a
meeting with reporters in Dallas.</p>
<p>"The previous policy was to use outside counsel
frequently," Mr. Ryan said. "Our policy is to use no outside
counsel."</p>
<p>Under the direction of chief counsel Harris Weinstein, who
joined the OTS on May 7 from the Washington law firm of
Covington & Burling, the 200-member legal staff will be
pursuing civil actions against thrift owners and officers and
other matters.</p>
<p>"We feel we can do the work as effectively as fee
counsel," said Mr. Ryan, himself a lawyer. "We know how to
try cases."</p>
