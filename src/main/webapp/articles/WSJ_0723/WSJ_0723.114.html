	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Bond investors, always a mercurial and
hypersensitive lot, are up in arms about inflation again. But
a few Wall Street economists think such fears are overblown.
   There is nothing bond investors dread more than inflation.
So, it came as no surprise when bond prices fell sharply last
week after the Department of Labor reported that consumer
prices rose an unexpectedly strong 0.5% in June.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>What did come as a surprise was the lack of hard-nosed,
inflation-fighting rhetoric in Federal Reserve Board Chairman
Alan Greenspan's testimony before Congress last week. That,
along with the consumer price index report, led to
accusations that the Fed is abandoning its battle against
inflation and giving in to White House calls for lower rates.
The Bush administration says lower rates are needed to avert
a recession.</p>
<p>But several economists, including Lawrence Kudlow at Bear,
Stearns & Co., Robert Barbera at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
and Edward Yardeni at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.,
believe that investors are getting all worked up for nothing.
Despite the consumer-price report, these economists believe
that inflation is moderating and that the Fed is on the right
track. And they all were perplexed at the market's harsh
reaction to Mr. Greenspan and the consumer-price report.</p>
<p>Bond investors' rising anxiety about inflation "is a
tempest in the tiniest teapot," said Mr. Barbera. Bear
Stearns' Mr. Kudlow went so far as to call the latest price
report "a scam" and said it should come with a warning label
that says "use of this release for investment decisions could
pose grave risks to your financial health."</p>
<p>Mr. Yardeni blamed the market's negative reaction to the
consumer-price report and Mr. Greenspan on the uncomfortable
heat and humidity that hugged New York and other Northeast
cities last week. "The bond market is a collection of humans
who are prone to emotional mood swings," he said. "Right now,
it's hot and everybody's a little cranky."</p>
<p>But these optimistic economists are bucking the consensus
view on Wall Street. Most analysts, economists and
professional investors are very worried about inflation and
suspicious of the Fed's motives for cutting short-term
interest rates July 13.</p>
<p>When Mr. Greenspan failed to talk tough about inflation
last week while raising the Fed's inflation forecast for
1990, bond investors fretted that the Fed has shifted
emphasis away from inflation and now plans to save the
economy from recession. (Mr. Greenspan said the economy isn't
deteriorating and the credit easing was to avert a credit
crunch, but many bond investors didn't buy his explanation.)
Many bond investors would rather see the economy crash land,
than have the value of their portfolios erode due to rising
inflation.</p>
<p>Economist Richard B. Berner, of Salomon Brothers Inc.,
holds the consensus view. In Salomon's weekly "Comments on
Credit," Mr. Berner warned investors that the Fed's
priorities have indeed shifted and warned that a less-hawkish
monetary-policy stance by the Fed, high overseas interest
rates and a weaker U.S. dollar will "reinforce the upward
drift in bond yields." He forecasts that U.S. long-term bond
yields will remain at current levels of 8.5%.</p>
<p>By contrast, Messrs. Kudlow and Yardeni see inflation
moderating -- and not rising as the consumer-price report
would indicate.</p>
<p>For one thing, they think that falling prices of gold,
aluminum, silver, oil and other commodities are signaling
lower inflation ahead.</p>
<p>Mr. Kudlow believes the consumer-price report overstated
housing and rental-cost inflation, which comprises about 40%
of the inflation index and was partly responsible for the
large monthly rise in the June price index. The government
reported that housing costs rose about 0.6% in June and by
4.4% over the past 12 months.</p>
<p>Mr. Kudlow says the housing component is flawed. He notes
that home price data collected from trade associations reveal
that prices are rising at a very modest rate of about 2%, and
prices for apartments are declining by about 1%. "In other
words, housing and real estate are presently experiencing
their worst slump since 1982," Mr. Kudlow said. That makes
the housing price increases reported in the June data "very
hard to swallow," he said.</p>
<p>Among other problems, Mr. Kudlow claims that some prices
used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to calculate housing
costs represent homeowners' asking prices, and not actual
transaction prices, which are nearly always far lower than
asking prices. "Perhaps {the consumer price index} gave us an
inflation reading for the third ring of Saturn, but not for
the planet Earth," Mr. Kudlow scoffed. The economist believes
that yields on the Treasury's 30-year bond could fall as much
as one percentage point this summer as evidence of lower
inflation becomes more visible.</p>
<p>Mr. Yardeni forecasts an 8% long-bond yield by the end of
the summer. He's expecting the next employment report, due
out August 3, to be weak enough to trigger a bond market
rally.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>Treasury bonds ended modestly higher as fears of inflation
eased at least for a day and investors looked at other
economic news.</p>
<p>The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose less than 1/4
point, a gain of about $2.50 for a bond with a $1,000 face
amount. The issue's yield eased slightly to 8.53%. That was
after Treasurys fell a total of 1 1/8 points Wednesday and
Thursday in reaction to the consumer-price report and Mr.
Greenspan's comments.</p>
<p>Traders attributed the firmer tone largely to the Federal
Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's report that manufacturing
activity in that region is slowing. In its monthly report,
the Philadelphia Fed said that 29% of the firms surveyed said
business activity slowed down last month, while 16% reported
an upturn.</p>
<p>That report "provided a positive impetus for the bond
market," said Robert Chandross, a vice president and
economist at Lloyds Bank PLC. Market participants focused on
the regional Fed report because there were few other
developments.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, dealers said investors continue to favor
short-term securities over longer-term securities, as
evidenced by the continued steepening of the yield curve. The
yield curve measures the spread, or gap, between short-term
rates and long-term rates.</p>
<p>The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond yields 8.53%, which
is 0.44 percentage point more than the 8.09% yield on the
outstanding two-year notes. But just a month ago, 30-year
bonds yielded only 0.10 percentage point more than two-year
notes.</p>
<p>Junk bonds, which had a sharp run up for much of the week,
slipped between 1/8 and 1/4 point Friday. Junk bonds are
speculative-grade issue that carry low ratings or no ratings
at all. Traders said that investors used the publication of
the Resolution Trust Corp.'s $3.7 billion junk-bond portfolio
as an excuse to take profits after the nearly weeklong rally.
The RTC is the federal agency overseeing the thrift-industry
rescue.</p>
<p>Traders, however, said the publication of the RTC's
junk-bond holdings should not have any further negative
impact on the market and may actually help by erasing some of
the uncertainty concerning which issues the RTC might sell.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, some analysts had warned that the RTC's
sale of its huge junk-bond holdings would flood the market
for high-yield junk bonds and put further pressure on already
weakened prices.</p>
<p>Among major market movers:</p>
<p>R.H. Macy & Co.'s 14.5% junk bonds gained about three
points Friday to trade at 65 1/2 on news that the company
reached an agreement with its bankers that allows some added
financial leg room during the crucial Christmas shopping
season.</p>
<p>Aztar Mortgage Funding Corp.'s junk bonds fell after
issuer Aztar Corp. reported a second-quarter loss from
continuing operations. The casino builder's 13.5%
firstmortgage bonds fell 1 1/2 points to trade at 95.</p>
<p>Quantum Chemical Corp. bonds weakened on speculation that
it will report weak second-quarter earnings. Quantum's 12.5%
senior subordinated notes fell one point to 87 3/8.</p>
