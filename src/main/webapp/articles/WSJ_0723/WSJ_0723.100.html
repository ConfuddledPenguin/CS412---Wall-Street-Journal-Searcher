	<p class="article-leader">DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania -- Manilal Devani opens the porch
windows of his roomy house to let in the night breeze coming
off the Indian Ocean, a stone's throw away. His family built
this house in 1951; today, he pays rent to the state to live
in it.
   The house, along with the family's business property and
most of its export-import trade, was confiscated by the
government during an all-encompassing nationalization drive
after Tanzania gained independence from Britain in 1961.
About the only thing Mr. Devani still owns from before then
is his trusty old Peugeot 404, which he lovingly navigates
around the city's potholes.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"These are great cars for Africa," he says. "They have
really endured."</p>
<p>And so, too, has Mr. Devani. The family wealth is mostly
gone. His five brothers packed up and headed home to India
years ago. His two sons are partial to London. His beloved
city, of which he was mayor in 1960, has deteriorated almost
beyond recognition. But Mr. Devani is still here, 63 years
old and rail thin, trying to keep the 120-year-old family
business going.</p>
<p>Mr. Devani's story is no ordinary tale of entrepreneurial
perseverance. It is a saga of doing business in Africa -- of
making a bundle under colonialism, of losing it all in the
post-independence embrace of socialism, of scratching to make
it back while surrounded by economic decay.</p>
<p>"In Africa, you learn to make adjustments," he says. "We
have become great adjusters."</p>
<p>Mr. Devani's grandfather arrived in East Africa in 1870,
coming from India with dreams of getting rich in the
Asian-African trade. He first settled in Zanzibar, the island
just off the Tanzanian coast, and found work at a bank. By
1885 he had started his own import business, and five years
later he opened a branch in Dar es Salaam. At the time,
Tanzania, then called Tanganyika, was under German rule.</p>
<p>"Grandfather was always full of praise for the German
administration," Mr. Devani says. "He said the security was
so good you could leave your shop unattended for an hour and
nothing would be taken."</p>
<p>The Devani family business -- importing clothing and
textiles from India and exporting African fruits and animal
hides -- expanded across East Africa. As World War I ended,
Tanganyika came under British control. With the Empire
pushing into the African interior, the Asian traders
flourished like never before. By 1920, the Devanis were
operating a merchant bank, financing much of this "upcountry"
business.</p>
<p>Just as his grandfather praised the Germans, so did Mr.
Devani's father admire the British administration, so much so
that he sent his sons to London for their higher education.
Manilal returned to Dar es Salaam in 1951 and joined the
family business as a cashier. He also became involved in
civic affairs; first, president of the Tanganyika Swimming
Club, then mayor of Dar es Salaam.</p>
<p>He was the city's last non-black African mayor, for in
1961 Tanganyika won its independence and the country's black
majority took political control. At first, little changed for
the businessmen, mostly Indians who dominated the merchant
class. In 1963, Mr. Devani became managing director of the
family business, which by this time was importing goods,
mainly textiles, from India and Japan and exporting to Europe
and Asia. As Africa modernized, the Devanis even began making
air conditioners.</p>
<p>In 1967, the Tanzanian government steered sharply toward
socialism, asserting the state's right to control all major
means of production and exchange. In the wake of the
nationalization binge, businessmen fled the country and the
Indian population shrank to 40,000 from 100,000. The Devanis
shrank to one. His brothers pleaded with Manilal to leave
too, but there was something compelling about
post-independence Africa that enticed him to stay.</p>
<p>"It was really like watching a whole society in the
process of change," he says. Even now, there is excitement in
his voice. "They {the Africans} had a purpose. I found that I
shared their aspirations."</p>
<p>While he was mayor, Mr. Devani had become good friends
with a bright young politician named Julius Nyerere. Now Mr.
Nyerere was the president and the driving force behind the
nationalization.</p>
<p>"Nyerere's aim was to improve the lot of the whole
society, and who can argue with that?" says Mr. Devani. "He
believed that if in the process there were casualties, that's
the way it had to be."</p>
<p>Despite losing most of what he had, Mr. Devani continued
his civic work, sitting on both the salary and civil service
commissions, which were charged with correcting the racial
inequities in the old colonial civil service. At the same
time he worked cautiously to revive the family business. He
started over again as a small trader, buying locally made
goods from the state enterprises and occasionally contracting
for some imports through the agency that handled all foreign
trade.</p>
<p>As the state-run enterprises faltered, the entreprenuers,
both Asian and African, gradually moved to fill the gaps.
Now, with the country's infrastructure in ruins and its
Eastern European models turning away from socialism, the
Tanzania government is even courting private enterprise and
foreign investment. These days, Mr. Devani spends most of his
time with the Dar es Salaam Chamber of Commerce and the
government's taxation and banking commissions, helping the
government retool the economy toward the free market. He even
dares to dream of a Dar es Salaam stock exchange.</p>
<p>Another dream, perhaps even more elusive, is for his
eldest son, Rohit, to move back home from London and keep the
family business going for at least another generation.</p>
<p>"At the moment, things look OK. But can one be certain
they will stay that way?," says Rohit, 32, a London-trained
accountant and commodity broker who is on a visit home,
exploring the business possibilities.</p>
<p>"I'd love to come back, but I'm looking for security," he
says, bouncing his 10-month-old son on his knee. "Everything
has to fit."</p>
<p>The father smiles at the son and the grandson. The pieces,
he believes, are finally beginning to fall into place. "After
all these years, this is the time we've been looking forward
to," he says. "Patience, my son. Patience."</p>
