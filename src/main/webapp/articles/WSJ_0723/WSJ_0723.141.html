	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Forget the "T word" -- taxes. In this town,
the new dreaded scarlet letter is R -- for recession.
   Conventional wisdom has long held that the Washington
area's economy is recession-proof, resilient when other areas
have downturns. Its primary industries -- government,
consulting, contracting and law -- seem to roll along
oblivious to the ups and downs of the business cycle.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Until now. Recent data, while not indicating a serious
decline for the area's overall economic health, reflect a
marked slowdown in growth. And a sharp downturn in the real
estate market has sent shock waves throughout the community.
The latest sign of deep trouble came Wednesday, when
Washington Bancorp. posted an $80 million second-quarter loss
and said that its National Bank of Washington subsidiary, the
District of Columbia's fourth-largest bank, no longer meets
federal capital requirements and faces a threat to its
survival.</p>
<p>Local residents, long accustomed to a robust economy, are
suffering from a case of declining expectations. "The
slowdown, even if the economy is still growing, is enough to
shake a lot of people," says Joel Popkin, a local consultant.
For the first time in memory, job growth in the Washington
area is less than the rest of the country -- 1.7% from April
1989 through April 1990, compared with 2.1% for the rest of
the nation.</p>
<p>The signs of trouble are evident throughout the
metropolitan area, which includes suburbs in Virginia and
Maryland as well as the District of Columbia itself. After
years of booming growth, the value of office-space building
permits dropped 43% last year, the Commerce Department says,
while the value of residential building permits declined
5.5%. The vacancy rate for existing office buildings in the
region rose to 14.4% from 9.6% in 1984, according to the
Office Network, a real-estate brokerage firm.</p>
<p>In the wake of the slowdown, Perpetual Financial Corp.,
the parent company of Perpetual Savings Bank, the area's
largest thrift, had a $50.2 million loss in the second
quarter, while MNC Financial Inc., the holding company for
three of the area's largest commercial banks, recently
announced that it expects a second-quarter loss of $75
million.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Garfinckel's, once the area's premier upscale
retailer, is conducting a going-out-of-business sale, as is
Arthur A. Adler, the venerable men's clothing store favored
by George Bush. Some local observers blame the problems of
Garfinckel's and Adler mostly on management miscues and
increased competition. But the problems have been exacerbated
by what a recent report by management consultants Grant
Thornton concludes is a flattening of retail sales in the
area.</p>
<p>To be sure, a lot of areas would be quite satisfied with
the kind of "recession" Washington is experiencing. Despite
the slowdown, the Grant Thornton report ranks the area's
economy as the seventh-strongest out of 24 major metropolitan
areas in the U.S. And job growth, while down from 4.5% in
1988, could still be as high as 2% this year -- about average
for the rest of the country. "In the '80s, you were going
down the road at 80 miles an hour," says William Wrench,
president of the Greater Washington Board of Trade, the local
chamber of commerce. "Now we're slowing down to 55."</p>
<p>But that slowdown is being felt in a broad range of
sectors. "We've laid off quite a few of our construction
workers, and now we're at the stage of looking at other
layoffs," says Edward Miller Jr., a local developer.
Meanwhile, with Congress preparing to whack at the Pentagon
budget, Towson, Md.-based Black & Decker Corp. has run into
trouble in its efforts to sell Planning Research Corp. and
Advanced Technologies Inc., two companies in the northern
Virginia suburbs that have significant defense-related
components. "The market is somewhat softer than we expected,"
said Barbara Lucas, a spokeswoman for Black & Decker.</p>
<p>Experts say that one of the main culprits in the area's
slowdown is the same thing that has fueled growth for so many
years: federal spending. According to a recent report by
Stephen Fuller, chairman of George Washington University's
Department of Urban Planning and Real Estate Development,
federal procurement awards in the metropolitan area declined
16% between 1987 and 1989, while they declined 9.5%
nationwide in the same period.</p>
<p>Mr. Fuller's report says that federal purchases decreased
about a third faster in the Washington area than in the rest
of the country in 1989. The area's share of all U.S.
government purchases slipped to 5.4% in 1989 from 5.8% in
1987. Nonmilitary purchases in the area dropped 15% last
year, compared with a 2.3% drop nationwide.</p>
<p>Even more worrisome are long-term demographic changes
reflecting economic deterioration in the area's core -- the
District of Columbia.</p>
<p>The notion of Washington as recession-proof has always
been "a relatively snobbish perspective," says local
consultant Clifford Alexander, a former D.C. mayoral
candidate and secretary of the Army under President Carter.
"When you see what people in this city do, it's far from
recession-proof," he says, referring to the variety of
hardships that beset the poor residents of the district
during economic downturns.</p>
<p>While the metropolitan area continues to gain people, a
study by the Greater Washington Research Center concludes
that the federal city itself has been losing residents at an
average rate of 3% a year in the 1980s, and that its
population will decline to 595,000 in the year 2000 from
roughly 613,000 now. Further, D.C. residents' median income
declined $1,500 in real dollars between 1980 and 1986 and is
projected to decline a further $3,000 by the turn of the
century.</p>
<p>That trend is expected to worsen pressures on the suburbs,
which until now have been the engine of the region's growth.
"If we have a very dependent and economically weak urban
center of the metro area, that can have negative consequences
to the suburban areas," says Mr. Fuller. "The fringes are
moving out, too. The suburban jurisdictions will be taking on
greater social costs than they had before. What happens if
you only have basket cases and millionaires living in the
district?"</p>
<p>Some analysts believe the trend will lead the suburbs and
affluent D.C. residents to put more and more pressure on the
district to spend money to remedy its problems. But that will
be hard, given that city tax revenues are likely to decrease
as the median income declines. The federal government, which
makes an annual payment to the district in lieu of property
taxes on government buildings, is itself strapped for money
and seems ill-inclined to help much. One possible solution
might be a commuter tax, but that idea is routinely scuttled
by opposition in Congress from suburban lawmakers.</p>
<p>Political turmoil is also taking a toll. The current drug
and perjury trial of Mayor Marion Barry, and the
countercharges of racism by some in the black community, have
had a dispiriting effect on the city that may yet affect its
economic prospects.</p>
