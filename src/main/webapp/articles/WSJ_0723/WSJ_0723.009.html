	<p class="article-leader">In response to Tom Bethell's June 20 editorial-page
article, "The Heresy of Cardinal O' Connor": The timidity of
Cardinal John O'Connor and other American Catholic Church
leaders is amazing to this Catholic. The Catholic leadership
in America is not leading; it is posturing. Church teaching
on abortion is unequivocal: Abortion is wrong and must be
opposed.
   It is not sufficient to proclaim you are a Catholic to be
one. This can be said of any creed. Your claim to Catholicism
must be confirmed by your acceptance of and practice of the
precepts of the Catholic Church. Rejection of the teachings
and precepts of the Catholic Church means you have left the
church. Therefore, your claim to Catholicism is false.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It is unfortunate that Cardinal O'Connor and other church
officials have not been more public and forceful in their
criticism of "Catholicism" as practiced by some public
figures. Their failure has allowed public officials to claim
"Catholicism" yet support abortion. Catholics in America
deserve better leadership.</p>

<p>I am reminded of an old stratagem: If you can convince
your audience that two plus two equal five, you may proceed
with impunity to prove any number of equations based on that
premise. For instance: Membership in the Catholic Church is
not like membership in an exclusive golf club; (the rules of
admission are more egalitarian); Mario Cuomo's position
relative to the cardinal's is not that of Henry VIII's
relative to (St.) Thomas More's. The governor is not given to
throw his subjects in the Tower of London for the purpose of
putting their heads on the chopping block. Yes, there surely
is a "God's Law." The question is whether the cardinal is its
sole arbiter in the realm of the state of New York. You try
to prove that]</p>

<p>Mr. Bethell complains about the role played by the press
and the politicians in the recent excommunication brouhaha.
It seems to me the Catholic Church is in more danger from
prelates like Cardinal O'Connor. After all, he's the one who
backed off as soon as the media started giving him a hard
time.</p>
<p>What kind of church has it become to place so high a value
on avoiding martyrdom?</p>

<p>If Cardinal O'Connor and the Catholic Church are opposed
to abortion, why are they also unequivocally opposed to birth
control?</p>
<p>Why does Cardinal O'Connor shrink from publicly condemning
the truly grievous sinners in our society -- many of whom
reside in the cardinal's own back yard? (i.e. Mafia leaders,
drug dealers, dishonest public officials).</p>
<p>It is easier, and probably a lot safer, to condemn Gov.
Cuomo. The cardinal should know that there are millions of
non-Catholic women like myself who applaud Gov. Cuomo's
defense of our legal right to a medically safe abortion.</p>

<p>Hooray for Mr. Bethell for presenting the Catholic
Church's side. I'm tired of hearing "I'm a Catholic but I
don't believe in: the stance against abortion, celibacy, the
sacrament of reconciliation (formerly known as confession);
the stance against artificial birth control; the teaching
that the pope is the highest authority in the church," etc.</p>
<p>These are all precepts of the Catholic religion today, and
unless and until there are any changes made -- if one cannot
accept these precepts -- one should search for some other
religion by which to live. Of course the Catholic religion is
a difficult one by which to live in this age of total
permissiveness but there is no one living in the U.S. today
who is not free to worship in whatever religion that person
finds most comfortable.</p>
<p>I feel our elected officials should keep their religious
opinions to themselves. I feel the same about paid performers
such as the so-called "superstars." Their opinions are just
that -- their opinions, but because of their high profiles,
their opinions are being touted constantly.</p>
<p>Cardinal O'Connor has a duty as head of the Catholic
Church in New York to remind all Catholics (including Mario
Cuomo) about the precept concerning abortion and the
consequences of ignoring the Catholic teaching on this
subject. I sincerely hope Cardinal O'Connor sticks to his
guns on this matter and does not give in to media blackmail,
or he will be remiss in his duties.</p>
