	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- CalFed Inc., stung by California's
weakening real estate market, posted a second-quarter net
loss of $53 million, or $2.10 a share.
   Citing "declining values" in real estate, CalFed, parent
of California Federal Bank, a savings and loan with about $25
billion in assets, said it took its first quarterly loss in
years after setting aside $91.7 million to provide for loan
losses and losses on real estate investments. A year ago,
CalFed earned $19.1 million, or 76 cents a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>CalFed's poor results didn't spook investors, who traded
the stock up by 37.5 cents to $14.875 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading, slightly above its yearly low.</p>
<p>But the news confirmed that California's once go-go real
estate market is now sputtering, a trend that could spell
trouble for many banks and thrifts in the state. And it was a
reminder that with real estate prices slumping in much of the
country, even relatively healthy thrifts will find it
difficult to produce earnings as they scramble to revise the
value of their real estate loans and holdings.</p>
<p>"With changing market conditions, it is prudent to take a
more conservative view of potential future losses inherent in
our real estate loan portfolio," Jerry St. Dennis, CalFed's
chief executive officer, acknowledged in a statement.</p>
<p>The increase in loss provisions wiped out benefits gained
from several positive steps taken by CalFed. Expense cuts in
its banking operations are likely to save $35 million this
year, and general and administrative expenses fell by 9.3%
compared with a year earlier. And in the second quarter, new
loan originations grew by 20% to $1.2 billion, and the
banking segment's interest rate spread improved to 2.3% from
1.8% a year earlier.</p>
<p>For the six-month period, CalFed posted a loss of $34.1
million, or $1.35 a share, against net income of $36.6
million, or $1.46 a share, for the 1989 first half.</p>
