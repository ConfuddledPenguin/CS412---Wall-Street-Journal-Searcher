	<p class="article-leader">Hinderliter Industries Inc., Dallas, said a San Antonio,
Texas, court entered a summary judgment in favor of the
Signal Capital Corp. unit of Itel Corp., Chicago, in a $28
million lender liability lawsuit.
   Hinderliter, which makes alternative fuel-system parts,
said it will appeal. Costs associated with the suit were
primarily responsible for two quarterly losses.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company also said it asked the Securities and Exchange
Commission for approval to withdraw its convertible
subordinated debenture offering. It has been unable to sell
the notes because of conditions in the unsecured bond market,
and will seek refinancing alternatives, including a private
placement or debt restructuring.</p>
<p>Hinderliter said it will post a charge of about $2 million
against earnings for the year ended June 30, related to
litigation costs associated with the suit, costs for the
company's move from Oklahoma City, the offering's withdrawal,
and the May resignation of John L. Robertson, 70 years old,
as chairman. Richard H. Hughes, president and chief executive
officer, was named to the added post of chairman.</p>
