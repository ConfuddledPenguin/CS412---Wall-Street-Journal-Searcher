	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- An acquisition of troubled Mack Trucks Inc. by
Navistar International Corp. could provide Navistar with new
manufacturing strategies and a new niche in the slumping
truck market, analysts say.
   But despite Navistar's approximately $300 million in cash
reserves and substantial balance sheet, any deal depends on
the willingness of Renault Vehicules Industriels S.A. to sell
its 45% stake in Mack.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It's up to Renault," said Eli Lustgarten, a PaineWebber
analyst. "I'm not sure the odds are high that (Navistar) can
buy it."</p>
<p>Navistar has said that it is considering a bid for Mack,
if, among other things, Renault agrees to sell its stake.</p>
<p>But the French concern, a unit of Regines Nationale des
Usines Renault, said it isn't interested in selling its
stake.</p>
<p>Navistar's expression of interest comes less than two
weeks after Renault launched a $6-a-share, or $99 million bid
for the 55% of Mack it doesn't already own. And if Renault
exercises a warrant and converts certain debt, the Paris
concern could increase its stake to 61%.</p>
<p>For Navistar, manufacturing synergies and a large share of
the heavy-duty construction vehicle market that Mack serves
could make the Allentown, Pa., company an attractive
acquisition, industry experts say. Navistar, the U.S.'s
largest maker of medium and heavy-duty trucks, is best known
for its long-range hauling vehicles, unlike Mack, which made
its reputation with gargantuan cement mixers and dump trucks.</p>
<p>Mack's new manufacturing facility in Winnsboro, S.C., may
also offer Navistar the opportunity to streamline production
in its Springfield, Ohio, plant, say analysts, who consider
the Navistar plant overburdened and subsequently inefficient.
Analysts also point out that because it's domestically based,
Navistar might fare better at cutting overhead at Mack than
Renault.</p>
<p>With the assistance of Renault, Mack has held on in the
ailing truck market, but sales have continued to sag. Renault
began to accumulate its ownership in Mack in 1979, but
Renault hasn't enjoyed the success in the heavy-duty truck
market it then anticipated.</p>
<p>"It's been sort of a one-way street," said Larry Hollis,
an analyst at Robert W. Baird. Renault has said it now wants
full ownership of Mack because of Mack's deteriorating debt.</p>
<p>With the possibility of a bid from Navistar looming,
Renault will have to assess, at just what cost, it desires to
remain in the American market.</p>
<p>Even before Navistar expressed an interest, Mack's stock
was trading well above the $6-a-share that Renault offered.
In over-the-counter trading, Mack closed Thursday at $7.125.
After Navistar's interest was disclosed Thursday evening,
Mack climbed 50 cents Friday in national over-the-counter
trading, closing at $7.625.</p>
<p>Once known as International Harvester, Navistar divested a
series of heavy-equipment subsidiaries in the early 1980s,
capping the changeover with the 1985 sale of the giant
farm-equipment division. The moves represented a successful
effort to stem enormous losses and restructure the company
strictly as a North American truck producer.</p>
