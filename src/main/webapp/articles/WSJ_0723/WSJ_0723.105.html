	<p class="article-leader">MARIETTA, Ga. -- Healthdyne Inc., profiting from increased
cost-consciousness in the health-care industry, said it
expects to report net income of roughly $2.9 million, or 17
cents a share, for the second quarter, compared with profit
of $163,000, or one cent a share, a year earlier.
   Parker "Pete" H. Petit, chairman and chief executive
officer of the home healthcare service and manufacturing
concern, said in an interview that Healthdyne expects to
report second-quarter revenue of about $33.5 million, up 40%
from $24.1 million a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I think you'll see Healthdyne continue just like we are,"
said Mr. Petit. "We've gotten our business to where we want
to be from a strategic standpoint. We will continue putting
our resources into our three core entities."</p>
<p>Mr. Petit said Healthdyne had strong second-quarter
revenue growth in all three main units: its 66%-owned Home
Nutritonal Services unit, which provides athome service for
patients with intravenous drug needs; its Healthdyne
Technologies unit, which manufactures physiological monitors
and other medical devices for home use, and its Healthdyne
Perinatal Services unit, which provides home obstetrical care
for pregnant women at risk of premature delivery.</p>
<p>Mr. Petit said operating profit and revenue from the Home
Nutritional unit rose about 25% in the second quarter.
Operating profit, he said, is expected to be about $3.5
million in the recent period, on revenue of about $19
million.</p>
<p>The Home Nutritional unit's "home infusion market is
growing rapidly," said Mr. Petit. "There's an educational
process taking place. More and more physicians are realizing
they can provide this type of (intravenous-drug) service at
home instead of at the hospital."</p>
<p>Mr. Petit said Healthdyne Technologies' operating profit
more than doubled in the second period to about $1.3 million
from $500,000 a year ago. Its revenue soared to roughly $8
million from $4.9 million.</p>
<p>Mr. Petit said Healthdyne Perinatal had an operating loss
of more than $600,000 in the quarter, compared with an
operating loss of $500,000 a year ago. Its revenue jumped to
$6.5 million from $3.6 million. Mr. Petit said the unit
opened its last two centers in the quarter, until at least
the end of the year, accounting for the increased loss. It
now has 28 centers.</p>
<p>In June, Mr. Petit said, the obstetricians panel of the
Food and Drug Administration voted not to recommend FDA
approval of Healthdyne Perinatal's System 37 Home Uterine
Monitor for use on women 24 to 36 weeks pregnant. Mr. Petit
said the system, currently approved for use by the FDA under
"investigational" status, is being prescribed by about 7,000
of the nation's roughly 30,000 obstetricians. But roughly 30%
of insurance companies won't pay for its use because it
doesn't carry the FDA's full approval, he said.</p>
<p>"The panel wasn't familiar with our type of study," Mr.
Petit said. "It's not a question of whether System 37 is
safe. The only business issue is whether some insurance
carriers will pay for it."</p>
<p>Mr. Petit said Healthdyne will consider spinning off part
of its Technologies and Perinatal units, as it has done with
Home Nutritional Services, "if those divisions perform as
well as HNS was performing."</p>
