	<h3>World Markets: Japan's Big Securities Firms Are Easing Back Into Underwriting Equities, but Curbs Remain</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Big securities companies are tiptoeing back into
the underwriting business, 14 weeks after they suspended all
new equity issues to protect the then-faltering Tokyo stock
market.
   But the brokerage houses, still chastened by the market's
precipitous decline in the first four months of the fiscal
year, have imposed strict limits on the volume of new issues
the firms will back. The cautious pace will cost Japan's
securities houses tens of millions of dollars in lost revenue
and delay capital expansion plans of many of the nation's
manufacturers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Business is not going to be easy for us this year, and
probably the next," concedes Yasuo Kanzaki, executive vice
president of Nikko Securities Co.</p>
<p>For the stock market, though, the go-slow approach is
crucial. The market's recovery from the crash has been
wobbly. On Friday, unnerved by Bank of Japan Gov. Yasushi
Mieno's continuing hints of tighter credit, the Nikkei Index
of 225 issues plunged 634.10 points, or 2%, to 32421.52.
Volume was thin, at about 500 million shares, down from 620.9
million Thursday.</p>
<p>In early trading in Tokyo Monday, the Nikkei retreated
another 102.54 points to 32318.98.</p>
<p>The securities companies' reluctance to lift restrictions
on equity-linked financing reflects deeply rooted uncertainty
about the Tokyo market's prospects.</p>
<p>The combination of higher interest rates and investors'
new wariness has impaled Japan's brokerage firms on the horns
of a nasty dilemma: The firms desperately need the fat
commissions they typically earn by underwriting new issues,
but fear that churning out too much new stock too quickly
might send the Tokyo market into a second tailspin.</p>
<p>"The market's going to have to be nurtured very
carefully," says J. Brian Waterhouse, a financial analyst at
James Capel & Co., a British brokerage house. "If you stuff
it too full of paper, investors will back away."</p>
<p>It would be hard to put more paper into the market than
the firms put through last year: Japanese securities firms
raised $173 billion in equity-linked issues in the year ended
March 31.</p>
<p>Those big numbers meant big profits to the Japanese
brokerage houses. The four largest securities companies'
revenues from underwriting topped 400 billion yen, or nearly
$3 billion, and accounted for about 7% of their total income.</p>
<p>Executives at the Big Four securities companies -- Nomura
Securities Co., Daiwa Securities Co., Yamaichi Securities
Co., and Nikko -- voluntarily suspended equity-linked
financing on the Tokyo market on March 20 in an effort to
pull the Tokyo exchange out of a nosedive. Before the plunge
was over, the market had lost more than 27% of its value on
the last day of trading in 1989.</p>
<p>Executives of the top trading houses initially agreed to
refrain from underwriting new issues for a month, but later
extended the ban amid uncertainty about the market's recovery
prospects. Underwriting resumed July 6 when Nomura issued
warrants for a $300 million offering by Daikyo Real Estate.
That deal was quickly followed by about a dozen others.</p>
<p>Trying to keep the pace of new issues under control, top
executives in the Big Four brokerages' underwriting divisions
are meeting weekly to coordinate underwriting operations,
according to market analysts. Ministry of Finance officials
deny direct participation -- "All I know is what I read in
the newspapers," insists an official in the ministry's
capital market's division -- but it is widely believed that
the ministry is monitoring the discussions closely.</p>
<p>So far, the brokers have moved cautiously. They have
agreed to steer clear of fixed-rate equity deals for now,
instead confining underwriting to convertible bonds and
warrants, which allow investors to buy stocks without the
obligation to commit cash to the market immediately. Those
companies planning to issue new stock before the crash are
being given precedence by the securities houses; other
companies are being told to cool their heels.</p>
<p>At the moment, analysts believe Japan's stock market can
handle a slow, steady diet of new issues. The market is
buttressed by a solid array of fundamentals. Japan's economic
growth charged ahead at a 10.4% rate in the year's first
quarter, and corporate and consumer spending remains
vigorous.</p>
<p>Phillip Dodd, chief economist at S.G. Warburg Securities,
a British brokerage firm, thinks the Tokyo exchange will
"struggle to see good news over the next several months," but
argues that Japanese stocks remain a sound investment over
the long haul.</p>
<p>Akira Suzuki, a senior Morgan Stanley analyst who was one
of the first analysts to turn bearish on Tokyo market in the
weeks before it crashed, takes a different view. He predicts
that the Nikkei will break the pre-crash high of 38915.87,
reached at the end of last year, before the end of August.
But he worries that the market may slip below 30000 before
year end, as the effects of two quarters of high interest
rates filter through Japan's economy, pushing up prices and
dragging down exports.</p>
<p>In either case, the Big Four aren't anxious to force
recovery before the economy can support the market. For an
extra measure of safety, they've set the upper limit for new
issues in convertible bonds at 100 billion yen and for issues
in warrants at 50 billion yen. That's a far cry from the pace
of dealing in the heady days before the market's crash, when
firms would routinely announce several issues of more than $1
billion in a single day.</p>
<p>The securities companies self-restraint will cost them.
The moratorium on new issues wiped out this year's
first-quarter underwriting income, and many analysts estimate
that new issues will be off by as much as half for the rest
of the year.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, investor interest in the stock of the
securities companies themselves has also plummeted. Financial
analysts at many of the major foreign brokerage firms in
Tokyo confess they've stopped monitoring the Big Four
altogether.</p>
<p>Unlike Wall Street's brokerage houses, though, Japan's Big
Four aren't contemplating layoffs. Mr. Kanzaki says Nikko
plans to make up for its losses by shifting resources to
foreign securities and new products like mortgage-backed and
asset-backed securities. And in the long run, he says, "We
think there's still money available here" in the Tokyo
market.</p>

<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>London shares ended relatively robust trading just off
intraday highs, helped by institutional buying on the last
day of the current two-week trading account.</p>
<p>A bomb explosion at the exchange didn't affect share
trading but prevented options trading. One dealer said this
led to some liquidity problems but otherwise there was
considerable buy interest, albeit on a selective basis.</p>
<p>Overseas earners recovered from midweek lows, despite a
continued strong pound. This was mostly ascribed to heavy
U.S. buying, particularly of Glaxo and Reuters.</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index gained
12.8 points to 2400.1. The Financial Times 30 Share Index
rose 9.4 points to 1898.1.</p>
<p>Dealers noted the considerable buy interest in British
Gas, following on activity generated by the issue of over 50
million shares earlier in the week. British Gas rose 5 pence
to 228 pence (9 cents to $4.14).</p>
<p>The oil sector generally gained, as the oil price climbs
on the border dispute between Kuwait and Iraq. Shell rose 10
pence to 484 pence, while British Petroleum gained 7 1/2
pence to 334 1/2 pence. BP also rose on news that the
government is retiring its "golden share" in Britoil, BP's
subsidiary. Dealers said the move gave BP more control of
Britoil.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, share prices closed higher in Paris, Madrid,
Amsterdam, Brussels and Stockholm. Shares closed lower in
Frankfurt and mixed in Zurich and Milan. South African gold
stocks closed lower.</p>
<p>Share prices closed higher in Hong Kong and Taipei, mixed
in Manila and Seoul, and lower in Sydney, Singapore and
Wellington.</p>
<p>Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.</p>
