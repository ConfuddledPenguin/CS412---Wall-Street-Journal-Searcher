	<p class="article-leader">The largest guarantor of loans in the federal student-aid
program is facing a possible financial collapse, raising
doubts about the soundness of its $9.6 billion in loan
guarantees.
   Higher Education Assistance Foundation, a nonprofit
corporation based in Overland Park, Kan., last week
approached the U.S. Department of Education and congressional
staff, seeking approval for a federally-assisted takeover of
HEAF by another loan guarantor. People involved in the talks
say Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos has resisted approving
a merger because of concern about its costs to the
government.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>These people say HEAF could be forced to seek bankruptcy
protection unless it is allowed to merge or get some other
form of federal aid. HEAF's woes pose a threat of losses to
banks that made the loans it guarantees, to its creditors,
and to the troubled student-loan program.</p>
<p>A failure by HEAF to meet its main obligation -- repaying
banks in the frequent cases of student defaults -- could
cause lenders to lose faith in other guarantors and stop
extending credit. The student-loan program, with an estimated
$13 billion in projected loans this year and $51 billion in
loans outstanding, is the largest source of financial aid for
paying tuition.</p>
<p>HEAF declined to comment on its Washington negotiations or
financial condition. The Education Department, in a written
statement, said HEAF "is facing serious financial problems."
The department also said it is "closely monitoring" HEAF, and
added, "In the event HEAF is unable to solve its problems,
the department is considering options, all of which will
ensure the availability of new loans and the continuation of
guarantees and claim payments on the loans." A department
spokeswoman confirmed HEAF is seeking a combination with
Nebraska Student Loan Program Inc., which also declined
comment.</p>
<p>The department said the situation "will not affect the
ability of students to obtain loans, or of lenders to make
those loans." But others say that prediction's accuracy
depends solely on whether the government comes to HEAF's aid.</p>
<p>"The worry here is that banks will say, if HEAF can go
broke, all the other {guarantors can go broke, too," said
Mark Wolfe, an analyst who has written reports on the
student-loan program for state governments. If HEAF isn't
aided, "you will have lender reluctance settling in very
quickly," added one congressional aide who was briefed by
HEAF last week. Banks have no direct claim on the federal
government for defaulted loans under the program.</p>
<p>One of HEAF's largest creditors is Student Loan Marketing
Association, or Sallie Mae, a highly profitable company with
a highflying stock. Sallie Mae, which extended an $865
million credit line to HEAF last December, is one of the
country's largest holders of student loans, which it
purchases wholesale from lenders.</p>
<p>Sallie Mae is also deeply involved in the negotiations
with the Education Department, according to student-loan
officials. Gisela Vallandingham, a spokeswoman for Sallie
Mae, said, "We ultimately expect the situation will be
resolved so there is virtually no cost to Sallie Mae." She
declined to say how much HEAF currently owes Sallie Mae, or
to answer further questions.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Citibank, the largest lender in the
program, with about a 5% share, said the Citicorp unit hasn't
had problems receiving defaulted-loan reimbursements from
HEAF.</p>
<p>HEAF's troubles aren't new. It reported a deficit of $44.4
million in the year ended last Sept. 30, and its chairman,
Richard Hawk, has been struggling to reduce lending volume to
stanch the red ink. Mr. Hawk's main problem is HEAF's
guarantee on a huge number of defaulted loans to students of
for-profit trade schools.</p>
<p>Under the rules of the loan program, banks make loans to
students that are guaranteed by HEAF and about 50 other
independent guarantee agencies. When students default, the
banks submit claims to the agencies for reimbursement. The
agencies, in turn, are required to pay the banks and submit
claims to the Education Department for reimbursement.</p>
<p>HEAF's problem is that it has guaranteed so many loans
that are defaulting that it no longer qualifies for full
reimbursement. Once guarantors' default claims exceed 5% of
their outstanding guarantees, they begin to receive only
partial federal reimbursement. Thus HEAF is obligated to pay
banks 100% of defaulted loan balances, but has lately been
receiving only 80% of balances back from the government.</p>
<p>Net cash outflows at HEAF have hit $3 million a day,
according to people involved in the Washington negotiations.
HEAF told congressional staffers that it expects its cash
shortfall in the next 12 months will be between $50 million
and $100 million, and about $300 million over time as claims
are made on all the problem paper on its books.</p>
<p>But people familiar with the loan program say no one
outside of HEAF really knows how many defaulted loans it is
carrying or what its ultimate liability is. HEAF guaranteed
$4.9 billion in what one of its own financial reports called
"high-risk trade school loans" from 1986-1988, and many of
these loans are now believed to be in default.</p>
<p>HEAF also told those it briefed last week that it has
unpaid claims outstanding with the federal government for
about $300 million. The federal government may also reject
claims when it believes lenders haven't made sufficient
efforts to collect. According to Education Department figures
released to lawmakers last week, HEAF's negative cash
position exceeded $60 million more than a year ago. A more
recent figure wasn't available.</p>
<p>HEAF wants a merger because Nebraska Student Loan Program
receives 100% repayment on defaulted loans, regardless of its
default volume. That's because Nebraska Student Loan is only
four years old, and federal law allows agencies to receive
100% of default claims, with no conditions, for five years.</p>
<p>But Mr. Cavazos is said to be reluctant to extend the
Nebraska exemption to HEAF and its troubled guarantee
portfolio. HEAF's Mr. Hawk told congressional aides that
Sallie Mae, as a major HEAF creditor, insisted on explicit
Education Department approval before agreeing to the Nebraska
combination.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolfe, the loan-program analyst, said that extending
the Nebraska exemption to HEAF is legally questionable.
"That's a scam," said Mr. Wolfe. "But of course, it makes
sense for HEAF."</p>
<p>The HEAF problems are likely to revive debate about the
loan program, whose defaults are projected to grow to $2.3
billion this year from about $1.4 billion in 1988. Mr.
Cavazos must either back down from a get-tough Republican
policy toward defaults and accept an unknown bailout cost, or
let HEAF fend for itself and risk a loss of faith in the loan
program.</p>
<p>The Education Department has said that lax practices by
the schools, banks and guarantors have led to the high
defaults. Democrats in Congress, meanwhile, say the Education
Department has been inept and unable to control fraudulent
trade schools who obtain loans for their students, then
prompt defaults by giving shoddy training or closing down.</p>
