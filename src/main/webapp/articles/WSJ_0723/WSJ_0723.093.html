	<p class="article-leader">Northwest Airlines Chairman Alfred A. Checchi is expected
to make a proposal to Eastern Airlines and its creditors'
advisers today, under which Mr. Checchi would oversee a
controlled liquidation of Eastern assets.
   Under the plan, people familiar with the proposal said,
Northwest would take over certain Eastern assets it has eyed
for some time: 80 of Eastern's newer aircraft, airport gates
in Atlanta and maintenance facilities in Atlanta and Miami.
In return, Mr. Checchi would volunteer to "broker" the sale
of Eastern's remaining assets for the benefit of creditors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It couldn't be determined whether Northwest would own the
Eastern aircraft outright or assume leases on them as it
would on Eastern's gate facilities. But either way, Northwest
-- while risking little -- would effectively acquire a strong
East Coast hub, something it lacks now, and badly needed
narrow-body jets to replace its aging DC-9 fleet.</p>
<p>It isn't clear how Eastern and those representing its
creditors will react to Mr. Checchi's proposal.</p>
<p>The plan would leave Eastern short of its stated goal of
finding a buyer to operate the whole airline. "We continue to
maintain we're not interested in liquidation, but we're
willing to entertain proposals for the entire company," a
spokeswoman said for Eastern yesterday. She added that so far
Northwest hasn't made any such formal proposal.</p>
<p>Eastern is a unit of Continental Airlines Holdings Inc.,
Houston, formerly Texas Air Corp. A bankruptcy judge in April
appointed a trustee, Martin R. Shugrue Jr., to take control
of the airline.</p>
<p>Mr. Checchi and Northwest spokesmen couldn't be reached.</p>
<p>Several difficult issues would have to be resolved,
including what to do about Eastern's financial liabilities.
By some estimates, Eastern's pension plan alone is
underfunded by at least $500 million. Mr. Checchi has told
people that he wants no part of such obligations and that he
wouldn't enter into any agreement with Eastern that would
result in additional debt for Northwest.</p>
<p>Despite its drawbacks, the proposal could prove attractive
to Eastern creditors. They would receive additional proceeds
from asset sales Mr. Checchi would arrange, and they would
retain Eastern's existing cash and cash equivalents. Eastern
has about $700 million in cash from prior asset sales in an
escrow account and shortly will receive about $300 million
from AMR Corp. for the sale of Latin American routes.</p>
<p>Eastern creditors also might be able to negotiate some
kind of securities in NWA Inc., Northwest's St. Paul,
Minn.-based parent, people familiar with the proposal
speculated.</p>
<p>Eastern has been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection
since March 1989, and there hasn't been any plan approved yet
for resolving the bankruptcy proceedings. Mr. Checchi's plan,
if it materializes, would be the only one so far offering
creditors the prospect of an immediate partial recovery of
their claims.</p>
<p>In addition, creditors might be impressed with Mr.
Checchi's credentials. He had been a top strategist for the
Marriott Corp. hotel concern and the Bass brothers of Texas
before winning a bidding war for NWA last year with a $3.65
billion leveraged buy-out proposal. Some people have said he
might be able to negotiate better prices for Eastern assets
than creditors would otherwise receive.</p>
<p>"Checchi's deal might be marginally worse for the
creditors {than a successful reorganization of the carrier}.
But he can argue it would be cleaner for them and at least
the whole thing would be over with," one person familiar with
the proposal said.</p>
<p>Even if the creditors proved responsive, both sides would
have to work out an arrangement for labor. Most of Eastern's
current employees were hired after the airline's three unions
went on strike last year. Eastern's mechanics union has yet
to return to work. Northwest's unions don't want any
strikebreakers hired. And it's unlikely Mr. Checchi will do
anything to rile them after spending much of the past year
trying to improve labor-management relations at Northwest.</p>
<p>Mr. Checchi could argue that he doesn't have to take
Eastern employees as part of the deal. But as a practical
matter, he probably will need to if he wants to use Eastern's
aircraft, gates and maintenance facilities immediately. One
person familiar with Northwest's plans said Northwest's
pilots union is looking into how quickly pilots could be
trained to fly new jets.</p>
<p>Integrating the two work forces would be complicated. Mr.
Checchi is said to favor placing Eastern employees at the
bottom of Northwest's seniority list, which would relegate
them to the lowest wages. Such a move is likely to draw fire
from Eastern's employees.</p>
<p>Despite his interest in Eastern, several persons close to
Northwest say Mr. Checchi isn't prepared to rush into any
transaction. They say that while Northwest executives have
looked at a combination with Eastern from a financial and
marketing standpoint, they have yet to draw up a plan for
blending the two airlines' operations.</p>
<p>Mr. Checchi, who has spent months and millions of dollars
revamping Northwest's service, is said to be extremely
concerned about avoiding the problems that plagued
Northwest's 1986 merger with Republic Airlines. A lack of
planning for that merger produced labor strife and wreaked
havoc with Northwest's on-time performance and baggage
service. It took the airline more than two years to emerge
from those problems.</p>
