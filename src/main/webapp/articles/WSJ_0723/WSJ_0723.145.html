	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- One of the strongest muscles in the stock
market's long bull run is withering with the decline in
takeovers and share buy-back programs.
   Corporate purchases gave stock prices a major push in the
1980s, but this mode of propulsion lost steam quickly this
year as prices pushed to record highs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>So far, this lost supply of buying power has been more
than replaced by other players, among which are mutual funds
that are growing bigger as individual investors pour cash
into them. But fewer corporate buy-backs means less
underlying support when these other investors bolt for the
exits, which happened Friday when more earnings
disappointments helped sink the Dow Jones Industrial Average
32.67 points to 2961.14.</p>
<p>Corporate stock buy-backs and takeover mania, which
rapidly shrank the supply of stock available to investors,
reached a frenzied pace in the 1980s. From 1984 through 1989,
the combination of takeovers and buy-backs reduced the market
value of all New York Stock Exchange-listed issues by an
average 6.5% a year, Goldman Sachs estimates. A smaller
supply of stock during a period of high investor demand
helped buoy prices. Goldman figures overall corporate
purchases accounted for more than a fifth of the 114.8% rise
in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index in the decade's
second half.</p>
<p>But this year, corporate demand for stocks through
takeovers and buy-backs is waning. After adjusting for a
quickened flow of new stock issues, the annualized rate at
which shares are being taken out of investors' hands has
fallen to the lowest level since 1984. Goldman Sachs
estimates that the rate of shrinkage in Big Board market
value will slow to 3% or less this year.</p>
<p>Robert Farrell, chief market strategist for Merrill Lynch,
suspects corporations are on the way to becoming net sellers
of stock after seven years of being net buyers. Companies
will use proceeds from selling new shares to retire debt, he
predicts.</p>
<p>Throughout the 1980s, companies gobbled up their own
shares or took over other concerns because both tactics were
cheaper than the cost of replacing corporate assets or
starting a business from scratch. But in the process, many
companies took on a lot of debt.</p>
<p>"Now corporations will start using any opportunity they
get to sell equity in order to pay down debt and reduce
interest costs," says Mr. Farrell.</p>
<p>At the start of the bull market in 1982, says Steven
Einhorn, portfolio strategist at Goldman Sachs, stocks
generally were selling at 50% of the per-share cost of
replicating companies' assets. Now many stocks are trading at
a premium to replacement value. That means, he says, buying
its own stock isn't any longer a smart way for a company to
invest its cash.</p>
<p>The buy-back fad is fading before many large companies
have completed purchases of all the shares they announced
months ago that they might buy, notes Laszlo Birinyi of
Birinyi Associates, a research firm. As of the end of 1989,
the 30 companies whose stocks make up the Dow Jones
industrials had purchased only a fourth of the 685.4 million
shares they had authorized themselves to buy.</p>
<p>Theoretically, these companies could come back into the
market when prices head lower, but because of a sluggish
economy and high interest payments on debt, companies have
less cash these days to buy shares.</p>
<p>Reduced corporate stock purchases isn't necessarily all
negative for the market, though, analysts say. For example,
the much-slowed pace of takeovers means pension-fund capital
is being diverted from once-hot buy-out pools. "Part of that
money is coming in the front door {of the stock market, as
direct investment} instead of the back door," Mr. Birinyi
suggests.</p>
<p>Mr. Einhorn of Goldman Sachs says the decline of takeover
speculation should free up more capital for investing in a
broader array of stocks. The latest rally has been
concentrated in growth stocks, which many analysts complain
makes for a cockeyed advance that can't be sustained.
Theoretically, says Mr. Einhorn, as the focus on big stocks
declines, smaller stocks have a chance to outperform the
larger ones. In practice, it hasn't happened yet.</p>
<p>But James D. Awad, president of BMI Capital, a money
manager, says that while 1980s-style takeover speculation has
ebbed, a new wave of takeover activity in smaller companies
will help spur investor enthusiasm.</p>
<p>"Investment bankers still have to make a living," he says.
"The theme is to move away from highly leveraged financial
takeovers toward all-cash strategic acquisitions of small to
medium-sized growing companies, especially niche companies."
This is the undervalued part of the market, he says.</p>
<p>As for whether individual investors can take up the
stock-buying slack left by corporations, the jury is still
out. Some analysts think individuals are ready to become more
active in the stock market. While the stock portion of
individually held assets has shrunk to a historically low
level, the recent heavy flow of cash into mutual funds
suggests that trend is reversing.</p>
<p>Carmine Grigoli, vice president, equity research, at First
Boston, notes that the average individual's net worth
currently is just 14% in stocks, down from 26% in 1965.
During the same period, the real estate portion, including
the individual's home, has risen to 29% from 21%. Realigning
those relationships presumably would help offset a slowdown
in corporate buying.</p>
<p>Individuals whose net worth now is heavily in real estate
will increasingly move cash into stocks as they seek
investments that will outperform the rate of inflation, Mr.
Grigoli says. A real estate recession, which has beset many
regions of the nation, makes people feel less wealthy and
inclined to save more and spend less; much of that cash is
likely to go into mutual funds, with stocks promising a
higher rate of return than real estate, he says.</p>
<p>"More people are going to be renting and saving rather
than buying real estate," says Mr. Grigoli. He predicts that
the strong flow of money into mutual funds will continue for
three to five years, when a recovered real estate market,
among other things, may compete more effectively for
investors' funds.</p>
<p>Not all analysts agree with this scenario. Among them is
Abby Joseph Cohen, market strategist at Barclays de Zoete
Wedd Research, who has been steadfastly bearish throughout
the market's latest rally.</p>
<p>Ms. Cohen agrees that corporate buying has been
"enormously important" in lifting the stock market to its
current levels. But she says no matter how unattractive other
investments such as real estate may look by comparison,
institutional and individual investors eventually will
realize, as corporations apparently have, that many stocks
are overpriced. Besides, she says, there are investment
alternatives, such as U.S. Treasury bonds and bills.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ms. Cohen is bothered that much of the buying
in the recent rally has been centered on the big-name
companies with strong, dependable earnings growth. "You end
up with a tiering of the market," she says, as a small, elite
group of stocks zoom way out front and the rest plod along in
the dust.</p>
<p>"How long can that last?" she asks. Not very, she says.
And when the next big market break comes, "These {elite}
stocks will be the hardest hit. You can only sell what you
own, and investors like to sell what they can at a profit."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>Stock prices dropped sharply as the latest shock waves on
corporate earnings reverberated through the market,
especially in the technology sector.</p>
<p>Although the market held firm through most of the session
amid disappointing earnings developments at Storage
Technology and Advanced Micro Devices, prices tumbled near
the close after Texas Instruments' second-quarter results and
outlook provided more bad news.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which rallied past 3000
at midday, fell more than 34 points in the final hour of
trading.</p>
<p>The expiration of July stock-index futures and options
contributed to the market's slide, traders said. A number of
expiration-related buy orders that were placed in advance of
the earnings report from Texas Instruments were quickly
canceled when the news came out, said Thomas Gallagher,
managing director in charge of capital commitment at
Oppenheimer & Co.</p>
<p>Then sell orders in the Chicago stock-index futures
markets triggered stock-index arbitrage sell programs. The
tactic involved buying futures contracts and selling stocks
to lock in price differences between the two.</p>
<p>The late wave of selling pushed New York Stock Exchange
volume to 177,810,000 shares, compared with 162 million
Thursday. On the Big Board, declining stocks beat advancers
by 912 to 585.</p>
<p>Among broader market measures, the S&P 500 fell 3.71 to
361.61; the New York Stock Exchange composite index lost 1.73
to 197.65; and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index tumbled 3.18
to 335.87.</p>
<p>The Friday retreat left the Dow industrials with a loss
for the week of 19.06 points, or 0.6%. Other indices posted
sharper declines: the S&P 500 fell 1.6% for the week; the Big
Board's composite index lost 1.3%; and the Dow Jones Equity
Market Index retreated 1.7%.</p>
<p>With the market "breaking one stock after another" in
response to disappointing earnings, Oppenheimer's Thomas
Gallagher said institutions are likely to become more
hesitant in committing more cash to stocks now.</p>
<p>"People are getting annihilated, losing tons of money
here," Mr. Gallagher said. "There is no chance to get out of
a {stock} position when things go bad."</p>
<p>Texas Instruments dropped 5 3/4 to 33 1/8 following its
report that second-quarter net income tumbled 89.6% from a
year earlier. The company also said it may report a loss for
the third quarter, noting that it expects the semiconductor
market to be "sluggish" for the next few months.</p>
<p>Advanced Micro Devices, another chip maker, plunged 1 3/4
to 7 1/4 on 1.4 million shares in the wake of its
disappointing second-quarter results. The company reported a
loss of 10 cents per share. Analysts had expected the company
to break even or report a modest profit.</p>
<p>Storage Technology, which had been one of the
best-performing stocks of the year, plunged 8 3/4 to 25 3/4
on 4.8 million shares. Although the company reported that its
second-quarter earnings surged about 250% from a year
earlier, it warned analysts that earnings for the full year
"may end up being at the low end instead of the high end" of
Wall Street's current forecasts. Demand in New England and
United Kingdom markets has been weaker than expected, the
company noted.</p>

<p>ALLIED-SIGNAL Inc. had completed all its stock buy-back
programs as of the end of 1989. In January 1990 it authorized
a new 25 million-share buy-back, under which six million
shares have been purchased. A table in Monday's edition
misstated the status of these purchases.</p>
