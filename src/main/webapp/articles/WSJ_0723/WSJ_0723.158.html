	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The House Armed Services Committee appears
ready to cancel or sharply slash funding for the Air Force's
B-2 Stealth bomber, the Army's new LH helicopter and a host
of other multibillion dollar proposed weapons.
   Cuts in procurement will account for nearly half of the
overall $24 billion the committee is expected to carve out of
the Bush administration's nearly $307 billion defense budget
request.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The first clear indication of that trend is likely to come
today, when committee chairman Les Aspin (D., Wis.) is
expected to urge the House to eliminate procurement money for
additional B-2 bombers built by Northrop Corp. The move could
save at least $35 billion by the late 1990s.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the House panel is ready to eliminate some
125,000 active-duty troops in 1991, but lawmakers and
committee aides said savings from those cuts are likely to
total well under $1 billion for the fiscal year starting Oct.
1. That's primarily because the committee will provide
expensive health-care benefits, temporary housing, relocation
assistance, severance payments and other programs intended to
help cushion the blow for both officers and enlisted
personnel removed from the Pentagon's payroll.</p>
<p>Rep. Aspin told reporters last Friday that the committee,
which is slated to approve a defense authorization bill at
the end of the month, will rely more heavily on savings from
procurement cutbacks than the Senate's version of the
measure. "We're sympathetic to the problem of" soldiers being
forced out of the military, he said.</p>
<p>The Senate Armed Services panel envisioned saving nearly
twice as much in military personnel accounts next year,
although it called for fewer troop cuts. The Senate committee
also approved the bulk of the Pentagon's request for the
radar-eluding B-2 and the LH helicopter.</p>
<p>In the case of the LH, some senior House Republicans are
leading the battle to remove it from the budget entirely.
Moreover, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney in the next few weeks
is expected to propose deep cuts of his own to reduce the
program's $42 billion price tag, according to Pentagon
officials.</p>
<p>For the radar-eluding B-2, each of which carries an
estimated price tag of $800 million or more, Rep. Aspin's
anticipated attack could be the most serious blow yet. Last
year, the Wisconsin lawmaker played a major role in keeping
the embattled bomber alive. But in the past few months, cost
estimates have skyrocketed and the Air Force has come under
increased criticism on Capitol Hill for failing to
effectively monitor contractor performance or justify the
need for a full fleet of B-2s.</p>
<p>Rep. John Kasich (R., Ohio), a leader in the drive to kill
the B-2, declined to talk about Rep. Aspin's anticipated
change of heart. But in an interview, he said that at least
207 House members have indicated they support an amendment to
complete flight tests but cut off production after 16 planes.
"The program is literally falling apart," Rep. Kasich
asserted. A Northrop spokesman declined to comment.</p>
<p>In the face of escalating congressional opposition, the
Air Force is defending the B-2 by emphasizing what it claims
would be a nearly $4 billion penalty for canceling proposed
production plans. In a letter earlier this month, Air Force
Secretary Donald Rice warned members of the House
Appropriations Committee that the government would have to
bear the high cost of closing facilities, compensating
contractors and disposing of tools, parts and other
materials. Temporarily shutting down production for just one
year, Mr. Rice maintained, would increase those costs to $4.6
billion.</p>
<p>Members of the House committee, however, have challenged
the termination cost estimates released by the Air Force.</p>
