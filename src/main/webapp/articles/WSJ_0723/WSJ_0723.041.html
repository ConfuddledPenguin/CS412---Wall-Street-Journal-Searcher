	<p class="article-leader">BUSH LAUNCHED a search for a successor to Justice Brennan,
who resigned.
   The 84-year-old liberal justice's resignation Friday after
a term of nearly 34 years gives the president his first
opportunity to influence the Supreme Court's character. But
it raises the risk of a Senate confirmation fight, and of
further GOP schisms. The likely appointment of a conservative
will be felt when the court begins its next session Oct. 1.
On abortion and separation of church and state, the court's
decisions may have a stronger conservative aspect.
Affirmative action and civil-rights rulings also may be
affected. The departure of Brennan could bring a liberal era
on the Supreme Court to an end.</p>

<p>A COURT REVERSED North's conviction in the Iran-Contra
affair.</p>
<p>The reversal by a federal appeals court in Washington
Friday was on the grounds that trial proceedings may have
been tainted by exposure to his testimony before Congress.
North was convicted of destroying documents, accepting an
illegal gratuity, and aiding in the obstruction of Congress.
The former national security aide received a suspended jail
sentence and a $150,000 fine. The court dismissed a lower
court's ruling on the document-shredding conviction. The
other two counts weren't dismissed, but the decision improves
North's chances of being cleared.</p>
<p>The ruling may benefit former National Security Adviser
Poindexter, who received a six-month jail term in June for
his role in the Iran-Contra affair.</p>

<p>Liberia's Doe was confined inside his mansion in Monrovia,
with rebels besieging the capital and his 500-member
presidential guard refusing to let him flee without them,
according to military sources. In a telex to the BBC, Doe
vowed he would remain until "a clear victor emerges."</p>

<p>A House panel appears ready to cancel or slash funding for
the Air Force's B-2 Stealth bomber, the Army's LH helicopter
and other weapons. Procurement cuts will account for nearly
half of the $24 billion that the House Armed Services
Committee is expected to carve out of the Bush
administration's defense budget request.</p>

<p>An aftershock struck Baguio in the Philippines, creating
panic among thousands of people camping in the streets of the
city, hit a week ago by an earthquake that ravaged six
northern provinces. It wasn't clear if there were any new
casualties in the latest aftershock to last week's quake, for
which the death toll stands at 1,043.</p>

<p>The Minnesota Supreme Court ruled Friday that a reporter's
promise of confidentiality to a source doesn't constitute an
enforceable contract. The ruling overturns a $200,000 verdict
against the state's two biggest papers, whose reporters told
a source he wouldn't be identified but then were overruled by
editors.</p>

<p>A bomb blew a hole in the London Stock Exchange Friday,
but no one was injured and trading wasn't interrupted. A
telephone caller earlier had warned of an IRA bomb, prompting
the evacuation of scores of traders and other employees.</p>

<p>British authorities banned a Pakistani film that portrays
author Salman Rushdie as a drunken pro-Israeli playboy killed
by a bolt of lightning for attacks on the prophet Mohammed.
Rushdie, whose novel "The Satanic Verses" was termed
blasphemous by many Moslems, has been in hiding in Britain
because of an Iranian death threat.</p>

<p>East Germany's Parliament voted to reconstitute the
nation's five original states, reversing a 38-year Communist
decision and taking another step toward German unification.
Meanwhile, Premier de Maiziere averted his government's
collapse by getting feuding coalition members to agree to
consult Bonn about a date for unification.</p>

<p>Mongolians voted in their nation's first multiparty
election, a primary contest for local, provincial and
national legislators. Diplomats in Ulan Bator said the
Communists would win but their authority, unchallenged for 69
years, would be weaker.</p>
