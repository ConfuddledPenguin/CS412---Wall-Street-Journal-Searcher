	<p class="article-leader">FRANKFURT -- Helmut Kohl set off on his Austrian holiday
with every sign that German unification was on track with the
blessing of the four World War II Allies. But it's likely the
would-be unification chancellor will be spending more time
off the sun deck and on the telephone grappling with knotty
problems brewing back home.
   The move toward unity in December has been complicated by
East Germany's deepening economic crisis and predictions of a
"hot autumn" of social unrest as thousands more East Germans
lose their jobs every week. Then a prickly debate over the
mechanics of unification erupted into an open quarrel that
has rifted the coalition governments of both German capitals.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The clash centers on whether Germany should be reunited on
Dec. 1, a day ahead of the all-German parlimentary elections
ballot, or at midnight Dec. 2 after the polls close. If votes
weren't at stake, it might be a minor point of procedure. But
progress toward German unification has been hindered by
old-fashioned party politics.</p>
<p>In Bonn, the Free Democrats, the centrist junior coalition
partner of Mr. Kohl's center-right Christian Democratic Union
party, have sided with the opposition Social Democrats in
demanding that East Germany be absorbed into the Federal
Republic prior to the Dec. 2 elections.</p>
<p>Mr. Kohl's CDU wants to delay formal unification until
just after the election to allow smaller parties in East
Germany to skirt West Germany's election rule that parties
get a minimum 5% of the popular vote to qualify for
parliamentary representation. Although claiming that small
East German parties should be given a fair shot in their
first run at the national polls, the CDU's critics assert the
party is catering to the tiny East German affiliate of the
CDU's Bavarian sister party, the conservative Christian
Social Union.</p>
<p>The Free Democrats, including Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher, are rebelling. "We don't want to
repeat the mistake of the Weimar Republic," said a spokesman
for the Free Democrats in Bonn, "where governing was made
nearly impossible by all the splinter parties in parliament."</p>
<p>East German parties are lining up behind their Bonn
counterparts, dividing the East German government. Prime
Minister Lothar de Maiziere, head of the East German CDU,
spent a rancorous Friday session in parliament fighting off
strong demands for pre-election unification from within his
own coalition, led by the East German Free Democrats. The
issue may have to be decided by a special parliamentary vote.</p>
<p>Once the timing issue is solved, the second state treaty
for political unity -- expected in September -- could be
snagged by Mr. de Maiziere, who this time differs with Mr.
Kohl over the Berlin question. Bonn hopes to defer over
deciding on Bonn or Berlin as Germany's future capital to a
decision next year by the all-German parliament. Mr. de
Maiziere insists that Berlin be set down as the future
capital of a united Germany in the second state treaty. (The
first treaty covered July 1 monetary union.)</p>
<p>The dispute over details of unification, which is likely
to continue through September, hasn't obscured the sudden
tide of sobering news on East Germany's economy and the
rising cost of unity.</p>
<p>Even pessimistic economists are alarmed at the economic
aftershocks from the July 1 merger of the two German
economies. Unemployment is skyrocketing as the aftershocks
continue to shake down 40 years of stratified central
planning. East German suppliers are collapsing under the
onslaught of Western competition. The mass incursion of
Western goods and services has all but swept East German
products from their former markets, tearing huge gaps in the
work force as former clients turn to Western suppliers.</p>
<p>"Certain East German industry sectors are in desperate
need of help because they simply can't produce efficiently,
particularly agriculture and consumer goods," said Peter
Danylow, a German analyst for the Foundation for Sciences and
Policy outside of Munich. "And if the trend continues, we
could well see an outburst of social unrest and another mass
migration to the West," Mr. Danylow said.</p>
<p>East Berlin reported that 30% of East Germany's 8,000
major companies already are insolvent and unable to pay wages
or purchase materials. By early July, about 223,000 of East
Germany's 8.5 million workers were already reported out of
work and another 500,000 had been placed on shortened shifts
under a special 2 billion mark (US$1.22 billion) compensation
plan. East Germany estimates that unemployment rolls are
swelling at a rate of between 30,000 and 40,000 a week.</p>
<p>"We didn't expect the impact of monetary union would be
this bad, it's uncanny. Up to 40,000 more jobless every week
seems incredible," said a senior economist for one of the
five West German economic think tanks regularly advising the
Bonn government.</p>
<p>Spotty data make firm assessments difficult, the analyst
said. But the main problem is identified as the inability of
East Germany's moribund industry to defend against the
invasion of Western goods and foodstuffs. "That is
particularly disappointing," he said.</p>
<p>East German Finance Minister Walter Romberg sounded the
alarm in an interview with Bonn's Die Welt newspaper last
week, when he appealed to Bonn for closer cooperation in the
critical aftermath of monetary union.</p>
<p>"I have the impression," Mr. Romberg said, "that the
difficulty of some of the problems is underestimated by many
politicians in the Federal Republic."</p>
<p>The Bonn government has agreed to East Berlin's request to
increase its 1990 quota on credit guarantees for East German
companies needing a quick cash infusion. Funds available
under the facility were doubled to 8 billion marks from 4
billion marks. Another 700 million marks in subsidies was
made available to East Germany's badly mauled farm sector for
the months of July and August alone.</p>
<p>East Germany's industrial production dropped 15% in June
from a year ago, a pre-economic merger reading that is
expected to worsen in coming months as firms are swept aside
by Western competitors.</p>
<p>While the West German economy is widely predicted to
expand between 3% and 4% next year, the German Institute for
Economic Research in West Berlin estimates that average
monthly output in East Germany could slump by 20% before
recovering in 1992 or 1993. Thus, economists predict,
unemployment could reach two million or more next year as
East German firms drop workers to cut costs, or give up the
fight.</p>
