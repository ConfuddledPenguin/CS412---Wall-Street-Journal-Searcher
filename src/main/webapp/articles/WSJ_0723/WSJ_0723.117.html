	<p class="article-leader">SEOUL -- The South Korean government designated three
companies as the country's exclusive manufacturers of
aircraft, the Ministry of Trade and Industry said.
   Ministry officials said Samsung Aerospace Co., Korean Air
Co. and Daewoo Heavy Industries Co. were selected as those
that will be eligible to receive government orders for
aircraft, particularly from the military.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The decision was reached in a meeting of government
officials and aircraft experts that was to reduce the number
of local aircraft manufacturers to reduce excessive and
duplicating investments in the industry.</p>
<p>As a result, three other major aircraft makers, Hyundai
Precision & Industrial Co., Sammi Aerospace Co. and Daewoo
Sikorsky Aerospace Co. were excluded from the lists.</p>
<p>The selection was based on the evaluation on the technical
status, development potentials and management capabilities of
the companies, officials said.</p>
<p>South Korea's aircraft industry is still in its infancy,
but a growing number of companies are entering the business
due to its high growth potential, analysts say. The
government designated the industry as a strategic sector for
the next century and plans to provide various supports for
its growth.</p>
