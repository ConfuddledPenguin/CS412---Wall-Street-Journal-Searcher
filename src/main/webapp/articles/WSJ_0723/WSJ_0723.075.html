	<p class="article-leader">TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Export orders for Taiwanese products in
June eased to $5.56 billion, down 7.4% from the previous
month, a government agency said.
   The figures also registered a drop of 2.3% from the
year-earlier $5.69 billion, according to the Economics
Ministry.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Officials attributed the month-to-month drop to a cut in
machinery orders as well as those for home appliances and
transportation equipment. Machinery orders totaled $468
million, a decrease of 19% from the previous month.</p>
<p>Transportation orders fell to $320 million in June from
May's $397 million. Home-appliance orders fell 45% to $100
million.</p>
<p>Export orders from January through June amounted to $33.29
billion, down 0.9% from the year-earlier period.</p>
<p>The U.S. remained the leading destination for Taiwanese
exports, accounting for orders valued at $2.04 billion in
June, down 14% from May and down 9.5% from June 1989.</p>
<p>European countries ranked second among buyers of Taiwanese
goods. Those orders in June stood at $865 million, against
May's $864 million and June 1989's $820 million.</p>
<p>Orders from Japan were valued at $786 million, a gain of
4.4% from May but down 6.4% from the year-earlier period.</p>
<p>Hong Kong ranked fourth among buyers, with orders valued
at $569 million. The figure was a drop of $60 million from
May but a gain of $152 million from June 1989.</p>
