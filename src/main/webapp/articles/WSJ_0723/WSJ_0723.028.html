	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo -- This is a small country, where three generations
often share a modest apartment. For the most part families in
Japan are agreeable, and even in close quarters people seem
to get along all right. But, same as people everywhere,
sometimes young couples need a little privacy away from the
old folks and the kids. So the Japanese have erected
thousands of small hotels across the nation, trysting spaces
with a two-hour minimum.
   Their spirit is of straightforward, almost innocent, fun.
And with the growth of disposable incomes, Japanese
practicality has met Japanese imagination to make Japanese
love hotels unique.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>There are love hotels built to look like ruined European
castles, alpine chalets and Japanese gardens. One Tokyo-area
chain is easy to spot because of the Statue of Liberty
replica on the roof. Others favor a larger-than-life Venus de
Milo.</p>
<p>I'd seen these places from afar over the years and heard
about their more extravagant features -- gondolas suspended
from the ceiling that take you from the revolving bed to the
heart-shaped tub; in-room swimming pools and miniature golf;
whole floors evoking different periods in American life: the
Roaring Twenties or the Wild West (the Puritan era in
Massachusetts somehow was not mentioned).</p>
<p>I'd heard of sports hotels with boxing ropes around the
bed, of $100 places that need reservations weeks ahead, of a
spaceship love hotel with a crawl way to the place of
retirement.</p>
<p>Tired, finally, of hearsay, my wife and I asked some
Japanese friends who know about such things where we ought to
go to find the real thing. Shibuya's Maruyama district, we
were told. Nothing wild, nothing too sleazy, just your
healthy average 120-minute honeymoon spot.</p>
<p>Sunday seemed like a good time to go. As Vanessa and I
came up from the train station we knew we'd arrived.</p>
<p>Fashion Hotel Air France. Hotel TwoWay. Oz. Pelican. Casa
Nova.</p>
<p>The frisson we felt on the train over (do all the other
people aboard know where we're headed? we wondered) was
overwhelmed by the abundance of consumer choice.</p>
<p>Hotel Chez Nous. Le Pays Blanc. Once More. White Box.
Creative Room Lios.</p>
<p>In the lobby of most hotels an illuminated board pictures
the rooms and identifies the style of ambience for rent. We
saw English hunting motifs in one place, in another high-tech
laser lighting and lots of chrome. Most looked like spacious
American motel rooms, which may in itself be a big fantasy
for young Japanese couples.</p>
<p>When you find the room you want, you press a reservation
button that darkens the picture. The next couple makes its
choice from the lit pictures remaining.</p>
<p>Each hotel has a prominent list of prices and services.
Costs range between $24 and $34 for "rest" and $47 and $61
for "stay." Most seem to have "360-channel TV," videos, video
games, stereo, sauna and in-room refreshments.</p>
<p>And something called body sonic. In my notes of our tour
this attribute is followed by "]]???]]]" I'm not sure what
body sonic is, but that must be how you feel when you have
some.</p>
<p>Love hotels, like many aspects of Japanese life, cause
trouble for the native English speaker through the
imaginative use of his own tongue. "Let me tell you now all
that on my mine," said the sign before one hotel, "for a love
like yours I nead you more and more." In such an atmosphere,
even reserved Japanese get into the mood, in public. In the
narrow streets of Maruyama, Japanese couples, most under 25,
walk hand in hand. Good luck to them too, because on Sundays
Maruyama sees incredible business. On our tour of love we
found almost every hotel full up. No wonder Tokyo's so quiet
at the end of the week.</p>
<p>Every time we found a hotel to our liking (sorry to say,
Hotel America looked pretty run down) we faced a bank of
darkened rooms. No vacancy.</p>
<p>By the fifth hotel we were getting desperate. "Let's try
Hotel Parco," said Vanessa. "After all, it's an interesting
department store."</p>
<p>No room there, and we struggled on. I really could
identify with the guy standing behind us in one lobby who
whispered, "Gambatte kudasai" ("Please continue to try hard")
to his young wife. We too would do our utmost.</p>
<p>Finally we found a nice little place on a side street. As
we walked into the lobby one of the rooms on its listing
board lit up like a welcoming beacon. Together we pressed the
button.</p>
<p>I wanted to ask the attendant about their body sonic, but
he was mostly hidden by smoked glass, with just a small
opening to gather money. It didn't seem fair to intrude on
the fellow's privacy.</p>
<p>Our room was called Piccolo Mondo. It came with twin
ceramic elves on mushrooms inside big illuminated glass
cases. They swayed amiably when you hit a switch behind the
bed, while piped-in music played the room's theme song. The
bed's headboard was a cutaway gingerbread house.</p>
<p>There was a circular light overhead, which alternated
twinkling bluebirds of happiness with Doc of the Seven
Dwarves playing the pipes astraddle a crescent moon. On the
facing wall, Bambi smiled and looked modestly away.</p>
<p>Not exactly what we had in mind, but it had character. A
hotel employee came by to explain how to work the television,
the videocassette player, the in-bed radio, the cassette-tape
player and the room's vending machine.</p>
<p>Well, life's like that sometimes: You hope for the court
of Suleiman the Magnificent, you end up in toytown. But if
you don't worry about things it's pretty good fun, even if
you aren't sure you got any body sonic.</p>
