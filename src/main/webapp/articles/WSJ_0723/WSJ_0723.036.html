	<p class="article-leader">Given the chance to solidify a conservative Supreme Court
majority, President Bush has before him two tasks of
governing. He must nominate his choice to fill the vacancy
left by Justice William Brennan, who resigned Friday, and
then he must appoint the person, as the Constitution says,
"by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate." How well
he executes this two-part labor will depend on whether he has
absorbed the lessons of recent years.
   Over the weekend Mr. Bush declared he intends to select a
"strict constructionist," and there are good reasons to
believe he will do that. Like Ronald Reagan, Mr. Bush has
made judicial philosophy central to judicial selection. And
like Mr. Reagan, he has a team of people, in the White House
Counsel's Office and at the Justice Department, some of whom
commit entire days to screening candidates for their
jurisprudential learnings.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As a result, Mr. Bush has done as Mr. Reagan did,
generally putting conservatives on the district and appellate
courts. If Mr. Bush heeds the advice of his judgepickers, he
will propose a conservative to replace the court's most
important liberal. There are plenty of good choices, many of
them Reagan judges who have been taking, as it were, infield
practice, awaiting the call to the biggest league.</p>
<p>Still, mistakes are possible. An "affirmative action" pick
-- where ethnicity or gender counts most -- would be a bad
idea. Sandra Day O'Connor, the least conservative of the
Reagan justices, is the case in point. Because of his
campaign promise, Mr. Reagan chose from a list of women only,
none of whom possessed strong conservative credentials. To
say Mr. Bush should avoid the O'Connor temptation is
obviously not to say that he should forgo the choice of a
woman or a minority. It is to say that he should not
subordinate judicial philosophy to such concerns.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush also could be tempted to surprise the nation by
naming someone not on the standard lists surfacing in news
accounts. There's no problem with that, and in fact Mr. Bush
has more margin for a "surprise" today than he will a year
from now. Still, this is no time for the Supreme Court
equivalent of a Quayle pick, and any surprise choice should
be made with judicial philosophy chiefly in mind.</p>
<p>Of greater concern is that Mr. Bush might be tempted to
spurn the advice of aides in the legal know and select
someone his purely political advisers recommend -- someone
who is jurisprudentially unknown but a "safe bet" for
confirmation. If Mr. Bush does this, he should not be
surprised if the court is still a vote shy of a reliably
conservative majority. In the worst case, he may live to
regret his nomination, as Dwight Eisenhower did with his
choice of Justice Brennan, whom he called his "worst
mistake."</p>
<p>Speed in selection matters. Mr. Bush must not move so fast
that the personal and financial history of the candidate is
not adequately vetted; recalling the reasons for Douglas
Ginsburg's failed nomination should be enough to activate the
key antennae. On the other hand, Mr. Bush must not let the
business drag on. The longer it lasts the more external
voices will wish to be heard, and the less discretion Mr.
Bush may have. Already Senate Democrats are asking Mr. Bush
to consult with them over his choice. Mr. Bush should not
allow that Trojan Horse to enter the White House.</p>
<p>Nominating a squeaky clean, well-qualified conservative
may prove easier than achieving a Senate confirmation. The
prospect of a solid conservative majority already is
galvanizing a left that is dedicated and organized against
any conservative nominee. This is the key point that the Bush
White House will ignore at its peril. It must be prepared to
fight. It must remember the failed Bork nomination.</p>
<p>Mr. Reagan nominated Mr. Bork and then left him to fend
for himself. This meant Mr. Bork had to overcome a vicious
political campaign (the first of its kind ever against a
Supreme Court nominee) that used all the modern techniques,
including paid media advertising. Mr. Bork could not respond
in kind. No nominee can. Quite apart from the fact that
would-be justices are not politicians and are ill-equipped to
carry such a fight, only the president is positioned by his
place in the constitutional order to combat effectively the
kind of demagogic appeals that were used against Mr. Bork,
and which Mr. Bush can expect against any conservative
choice. Mark it down: There will be distortion, there will be
defamation.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush must be ready, as Mr. Reagan was not, to go
public against the Democrats. He must be willing, as Mr.
Reagan was not, to fight fire with fire. If, as happened with
Mr. Bork, the left says the nominee will return the nation to
segregation or force sterilization upon women (or the like),
Mr. Bush must not confine himself to saying that this vicious
rhetoric has no place in the advice-and-consent process. He
must also be prepared to respond in sharp language that
cannot be misunderstood. With the 1990 elections a few months
away this tactic could force senators to rethink their
positions.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Bush should not allow fear of defeat to
influence his actions. Thanks to the Constitution, the
president holds the upper hand. As Mr. Reagan showed in his
nominations of Mr. Bork, Mr. Ginsburg and Anthony Kennedy, a
president can eventually get his jurisprudential way. Still,
success can be achieved on the first try with a president of
purpose and will.</p>
