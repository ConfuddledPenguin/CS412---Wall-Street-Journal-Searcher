	<div class="article-body"><p>Japanese investment in the U.S. is helping revitalize U.S.
manufacturing, the Japan Development Bank said.</p>
<p>Investments made since the early 1980s should be
appreciated, rather than resented, the bank said in a report
on the role of Japanese manufacturers in the U.S. Ultimately,
Japanese investment will help stop the "hollowing out" of the
U.S. manufacturing sector, the bank's study asserted.</p>
<p>The Development Bank undertook the report in response to
growing condemnation in the U.S. of Japanese investment. Of
Japanese corporations' overall investments, 80% are made in
developed nations and two-thirds of that in the U.S.</p>
<p>By investing in local capacity, Japanese manufacturers are
adding to the U.S.'s capital stock and making a long-term
contribution to the nation, the Development Bank said.</p>
<p>COMPENSATION FROM HUNGARY</p>
<p>Hungary said it would compensate people for loss of
personal liberty under communism. A government spokesman said
a compensation bureau would be set up in September to start
handling complaints. "We are talking about compensating those
who lost their personal liberty for political reasons and not
about compensation for lost or nationalized belongings or
real estate," the spokesman said. "I mean those who were
interned, deported or were taken for {hard labor} to the
Soviet Union."</p>
<p>NEW ITALIAN TAXES</p>
<p>The Italian government is increasing the tax on gasoline
by 60 lire (five U.S. cents) a liter, raising the price per
liter of super gasoline to 1,485 lire ($1.23). There are 3.8
liters in a gallon. The government is also raising the price
of automotive diesel oil by 55 lire a liter. The excise tax
on mineral water and beer was raised to 19% from 9%, while
the manufacturing tax for liquor was increased 40%, the
government announced. The revenue from new taxes is expected
to be around 1.925 trillion lire in 1990.</p>
<p>A WARNING FROM MR. DELORS</p>
<p>The creation of new currencies by independence-minded
Soviet republics could be "devastating" for the Kremlin's
attempt to integrate its sickly economy into the global
economy, European Community Chairman Jacques Delors said.
Four of the 15 Soviet republics have said they want to
replace the ruble with their own currencies. Mr. Delors,
wrapping up the first official visit by an EC chairman to the
Soviet Union, said the republics' actions would run counter
to the EC's moves toward a single currency.</p>
<p>CHINESE INFLATION</p>
<p>Inflation in China dropped to its lowest level in five
years in May, when the retail price index climbed only 2.6%,
the State Statistical Bureau said. The average retail-price
increase for the first six months was 3.2%, down from the
25.5% increase for the same period last year, the bureau
said. In the fall of 1988, with inflation running at more
than 30%, China instituted an austerity program to cool an
overheated economy and ease inflation.</p>
<p>BMW'S EAST GERMAN PLANS</p>
<p>West Germany's Bayerische Motoren Werke AG said it would
invest an initial 100 million marks (about $61 million) to
build a factory for large machine tools in Eisenach, East
Germany. BMW, which started operations in Eisenach before
World War II, said it bought the rights to use a piece of
property there and would buy this land for the factory as
soon as the two Germanys have cleared the way for such
cross-border property-ownership arrangements. BMW, which
earlier said it had no intention of making cars in Eisenach
again, said it was putting the tools project there "because
of the availability of qualified labor."</p>
<p>PANAMA'S AILING HEALTH SYSTEM</p>
<p>Panama's state-run health system is near collapse,
government officials and doctors say.</p>
<p>Three years of political crisis leading up to last
December's downfall of Gen. Manuel Noriega have left
hospitals and health centers throughout the country in
serious disrepair, and a scarcity of medicial supplies has
forced the closing of some operating rooms. "To repair all
hospitals and health centers we would need about $10
million," said Minister of Health Jose Trinidad Castillero.</p>
<p>A lack of medical supplies, including penicillin and
painkillers, has sometimes forced the closing of operating
rooms. "Each day, more people are going to die who don't have
to . . . because there aren't supplies," said Ruben
Echavarria, the president of an association of Panamanian
doctors.</p>
<p>The government, deeply in debt and facing a host of other
problems, increased the health budget by 26% over last year
to $101.5 million; but doctors say more money is needed.
Panama has received some foreign donations to help resolve
the crisis, including $1 million promised from Spain.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>East Germany's 62,000 professional soldiers swore a new
oath of allegiance superseding the oath they once swore under
communism. Gone were references to defending the "workers'
and peasants' government against all enemies," alongside
Soviet troops. . . . Spain's Iberia airlines inaugurated its
first nonstop flight from Madrid to Moscow. The twice-weekly
flight goes on to Tokyo.</p>
