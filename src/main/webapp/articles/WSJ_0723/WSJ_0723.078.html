	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Oliver North case is back in the lap of
U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard Gesell.
   That development follows a federal appeals court's
decision Friday reversing Mr. North's conviction in the
Iran-Contra affair on the grounds that trial proceedings may
have been tainted by exposure to his testimony before
Congress.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. North was convicted in May 1989 for altering and
destroying official documents, accepting an illegal gratuity,
and aiding and abetting in the obstruction of Congress. The
former national security aide received a suspended jail
sentence and a $150,000 fine that he hasn't yet been required
to pay. He was also sentenced to 1,200 hours of community
service.</p>
<p>The appeals court dismissed the lower court's ruling on
the document-shredding conviction on technical grounds
regarding the way Judge Gesell instructed the jury.</p>
<p>The other two counts weren't dismissed outright. But the
appellate decision substantially improves Mr. North's chances
of being cleared of all criminal charges. It also may benefit
former National Security Adviser John Poindexter, who
received a six-month jail sentence in June for his role in
the Iran-Contra affair. Mr. Poindexter, who was convicted on
five counts, including conspiracy and obstruction of
Congress, is expected to appeal his case.</p>
<p>Friday's ruling came in response to a challenge by Mr.
North and the American Civil Liberties Union. Lawyers for Mr.
North and the ACLU questioned the prosecution's ability to
honor the "use immunity" guarantee granted to Mr. North by
the congressional Iran-Contra committee. Under use immunity,
a witness such as Mr. North can be forced to testify provided
that testimony isn't used against him in a criminal
proceeding.</p>
<p>In a 2-to-1 ruling, the appeals court panel ruled that the
lower court should have held a full hearing to demonstrate
that independent counsel Lawrence Walsh made no use of Mr.
North's testimony before the Iran-Contra committee. In order
to maintain Mr. North's conviction, Mr. Walsh now must show
in a hearing before Judge Gesell that this testimony didn't
affect the trial.</p>
<p>"Everyone familiar with these proceedings has recognized
the difficulty presented by the grants of immunity by
Congress," Mr. Walsh said in a statement Friday. "We have
diligently tried to work around these difficulties."</p>
<p>In its decision, the court expressed concern that Reagan
administration officials who watched or were briefed on Mr.
North's televised testimony to the Iran-Contra committees
were influenced by it when they subsequently testified at Mr.
North's trial.</p>
<p>For example, the court said that former National Security
Adviser Robert McFarlane, who testified to the Iran-Contra
committee before Mr. North's appearance, testified a second
time at his own request after Mr. North. In this second
appearance, the court said, Mr. McFarlane responded directly
to Mr. North's testimony, and "apparently managed to recall
items he had not remembered" the first time around. Mr.
McFarlane was a key government witness at Mr. North's trial.</p>
<p>Given the appeals court's strict requirements concerning
use immunity, Mr. Walsh is unlikely to prevail in a hearing
before Judge Gesell. A more likely course is for Mr. Walsh to
either petition all the judges of the appeals court circuit
for a rehearing, or to petition the Supreme Court. Mr. Walsh
didn't say Friday what course of action he would take.</p>
