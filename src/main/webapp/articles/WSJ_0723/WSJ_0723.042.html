	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The U.S. International Trade Commission is
expected to decide tomorrow whether higher tariffs, import
quotas or some other type of restrictions are needed on
imports of fixed-focus cameras from Japan and other
countries.
   Technically, the government trade panel will be voting on
whether these imports, which totaled about $689 million in
1989, are "injuring" a domestic industry, as alleged in a
complaint filed with the ITC several months ago by Keystone
Camera Corp., Clifton, N.J.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>If, as expected, the ITC upholds the Keystone complaint --
which has been strongly opposed by Eastman Kodak Co.,
Rochester, N.Y., and others -- the trade panel could either
make some immediate recommendations to the White House about
limiting imports or delay that decision until Sept. 9, after
another round of ITC hearings on the "remedy" for the import
problem.</p>
<p>White House officials are concerned that this trade case
may get to President Bush a lot quicker than previously
expected, forcing him to act by the end of the month on
accepting or rejecting "provisional" import restrictions that
the ITC could propose. Allowing the president only seven days
to make such a decision wouldn't give President Bush or his
top trade advisers much time for dealing with a difficult
trade dispute, U.S. officials say.</p>
<p>If the ITC delays its recommendations on an import relief
"remedy" until September, President Bush still would be
required to make the final decision this year on whether to
accept, reject or modify any ITC proposals.</p>
<p>The Keystone case, filed March 29 under Section 201 of
U.S. trade laws, has attracted a lot of attention in the
international trade community.</p>
<p>It doesn't involve alleged "unfair" import competition.
Rather, it is a straightforward request for protectionist
trade measures, in the form of higher tariffs and import
quotas for a period of five years, to restrain imports of
relatively inexpensive fixed-focus cameras using 35mm and
110-type film.</p>
<p>Without such import restrictions, Keystone has said it
would have to stop producing such cameras in the U.S. and
switch production abroad, as Eastman Kodak and other camera
manufacturers already have done.</p>
<p>But Eastman Kodak, which is ranked as an "importer" in the
current ITC inquiry, and representatives of camera makers in
Japan, Taiwan, Brazil, Hong Kong, China, Mexico, South Korea,
Malaysia and Thailand, argued that the import restrictions
sought by Keystone should be rejected by the ITC.</p>
<p>Earlier, the ITC rejected efforts of Eastman Kodak and
others to get the trade panel to terminate the inquiry on the
grounds that Keystone couldn't speak for the entire U.S.
camera manufacturing industry.</p>
<p>The government trade panel had its full complement of six
members when the camera import inquiry was ordered this year.
But two ITC members have resigned, and President Bush hasn't
filled those vacancies; new appointees also would have to be
approved by the Senate before they could assume office.</p>
<p>Therefore, the decision scheduled for tomorrow on the
Keystone case will be made by the four remaining ITC members,
which sets up the following possibilities on the outcome:</p>
<p>If the ITC rules against Keystone by a vote of 3-1, that
would end the entire case.</p>
<p>If it goes 3-1 the other way, Keystone would win.</p>
<p>If the ITC members split, a 2-2 vote on the question of
injury to a domestic industry also would mean that Keystone
would be the winner in the first critical decision in this
case, because that is the way U.S. law now reads for
decisions in Section 201 cases.</p>
<p>All of this suggests that President Bush, whether he likes
it or not, will have to make a tough call on restricting
imports of certain types of cameras that are sold by the
millions each year to U.S. consumers.</p>
