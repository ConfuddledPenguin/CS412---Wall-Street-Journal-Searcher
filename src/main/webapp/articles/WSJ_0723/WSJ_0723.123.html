	<p class="article-leader">COLUMBIA, S.C. -- A federal grand jury here has subpoenaed
the financial records of all 170 of South Carolina's state
legislators as part of an investigation into a cash-for-votes
scheme.
   In a statement, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and
the Justice Department confirmed that they were investigating
"allegations of illegal conduct involving certain members of
the South Carolina Legislature." They wouldn't elaborate,
except to say the investigation would be thorough and would
be concluded as quickly as possible.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>However, one person familiar with the investigation said
that it stems from the FBI's use of an undercover lobbyist to
offer legislators money in exchange for their votes. The
grand jury subpoenaed financial records from the 124 state
representatives Wednesday, the individual said, and
subpoenaed records for the 46 state senators Friday.</p>
