	<p class="article-leader">Caterpillar Inc. said second-quarter earnings tumbled 67%
on a 3.1% decline in sales.
   Net income dropped to $46 million, or 46 cents a share,
from $141 million, or $1.39 a share, in the year-earlier
period. Sales slipped to $2.95 billion from $3.04 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The discouraging numbers didn't come as a surprise. The
Peoria, Ill., heavy-equipment maker disclosed late last month
that its once highly profitable Brazilian operation has been
badly hit by the economic disruptions in that nation.</p>
<p>In addition, Caterpillar is feeling the effects of a soft
demand in the U.S. and some other markets. And the dollar's
recent strengthening means Caterpillar's sales to Japan
generate fewer dollars, and render competing Japanese imports
relatively cheaper in this country.</p>
<p>In composite New York Stock Exchange trading Friday,
Caterpillar shares closed at $52.50, unchanged.</p>
<p>Caterpillar also disclosed Friday that it is the target of
a shareholder suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Peoria,
which alleges the company violated securities laws by failing
to properly disclose its financial situation. The company
said it thinks the suit, which seeks class-action status, is
"without merit."</p>
