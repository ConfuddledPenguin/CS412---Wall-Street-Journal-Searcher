	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- NASA may have to take a much riskier
approach to building its proposed $37 billion space station
because of growing problems maintaining and repairing it.
   Two panels of National Aeronautics and Space
Administration experts said Friday that the space agency
would have to radically simplify its design and increase its
dependence on robotics to reduce the number of space walks
needed to build and maintain the space station. "One of the
ways they're trying to solve their problem is by increasing
the risk of the program," said John Pike, a space analyst for
the Federation of American Scientists.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Unless the recommended changes are made, the panels
estimated that NASA astronauts would have to spend about
3,500 hours annually in space suits repairing the station in
orbit -- about one space walk each day. Even before
astronauts begin living on the station, one of the panels
estimated, space station maintenance would require a space
walk about every other day. The problem is "there's no one up
there to do it," says William Fisher, an astronaut who led
one of the studies.</p>
<p>NASA wants to avoid space walks because they are
inherently dangerous and because they siphon away time that
crews would otherwise devote to scientific research. In
NASA's history, U.S. astronauts have spent a total of only
about 400 hours in space walks.</p>
<p>To reduce the number of space walks to about 500 hours
annually -- roughly one each week -- the panels recommended
dozens of actions. But Richard Kohrs, NASA's space station
director, said that NASA wasn't planning to adopt several of
the most important recommendations, including building an
improved space suit or moving several repairable items inside
the station, where they could be fixed without space walks.</p>
<p>One important recommendation that NASA seems willing to
accept is a greater use of the station's four proposed
robots. Jerry Grey, director of science and technology for
the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, said
that could involve taking greater risks in robot design. The
station's robots should be designed so they can incorporate
the latest technology, he said, even if that increases the
chance that the robots won't work as well as expected. "You
trade risk for accomplishment," he said.</p>
<p>But Mr. Pike fears that the space agency is simply
changing problems by relying more on the unproven robots.
"You make the {space walk} problem go away by creating a
robot problem," he said. "These robots haven't been built
yet. There's concern about their adequacy and their testing."</p>
<p>Space agency managers working on robots say that NASA is
pushing them to choose a design too early to incorporate the
latest technology. The first flight to test proposed hardware
for the station's main robot is planned for September 1991 --
about 3 1/2 years before the station is supposed to start
construction. If the robot falls behind schedule or develops
glitches, the station assembly also could lose ground.</p>
<p>The space station is already in trouble with Congress,
which is threatening to cut off funds in December -- when the
space agency is conducting a design review -- unless NASA can
substantially improve the station's capabilities. The added
risk involved in curing the maintenance problem "increases
concern that the station's design is too complex," a
congressional aide said.</p>
<p>The panels also made a number of other recommendations
that highlight the station's riskiness. One group, headed by
William Simon, a Johnson Space Center manager, suggested
eliminating the requirement that all critical systems be
designed to withstand two separate failures. "Ten years from
now, when the station comes unglued because of a failure of
redundancy," warned Mr. Pike, "you can point to this
{recommendation} and say it all started here."</p>
