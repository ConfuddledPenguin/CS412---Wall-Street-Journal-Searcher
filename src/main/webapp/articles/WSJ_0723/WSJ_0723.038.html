	<p class="article-leader">I work in an American industry that is successfully
marketing its product in Japan -- so successfully, in fact,
that it turns away many potential customers each year. The
industry is graduate management education; the product is the
Master of Business Administration degree. At well-known U.S.
business schools, Japanese applicants, most financially
sponsored by their employers, are beating down our doors. At
Cornell last year more than 10% of our 3,228 M.B.A.
applicants were Japanese. Fewer than 40 were accepted for a
class of 240; 20 will enroll.
   Yet before U.S. business schools go too far in smug
self-congratulation about their success, they should look
more closely to see whether the right students are being
admitted to the right schools and receiving the right kind of
education. The process through which Japanese students find
their way to American M.B.A. schools is fraught with
inefficiencies and misunderstandings. And once they make it
into a U.S. business school, there is an incompatibility
between what is taught and what Japanese students expect to
achieve.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>To start, U.S. business schools must recognize that the
goals of their Japanese students are usually quite different
from those of their U.S. applicants. Japanese government
ministries and large companies such as NTT, Nippon Steel and
Mitsubishi Corp. send young managers to the U.S. for their
M.B.A.s not primarily to learn useful techniques in marketing
or finance, but to learn about American culture and to make
personal contacts.</p>
<p>Thus, more thorough introductions to American business
culture are needed for Japanese students. At the very least,
M.B.A. programs should offer intensified coursework in
American history, institutions and society. Professors could
organize study groups to promote interaction between Japanese
and American students. Case studies and other teaching
materials that view business problems from a non-U.S.
perspective also are a good idea.</p>
<p>But problems with Japanese students begin even before they
arrive at U.S. business schools. Few involved in M.B.A.
admissions understand the graduate school preparation
industry in Japan. These preparatory schools have done their
work well. Japanese score very high on standardized tests;
thoughtful application essays are written in perfect English;
answers to typical interview questions are memorized. Even
the most experienced admissions officers are overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Since so many of the Japanese applicants are well
qualified, business schools make decisions on these
candidates almost at random. The rationale for acceptance or
rejection comes down to inconsequentially small differences
on test scores, or worse, the potential of sponsoring
companies to make financial contributions to the school. Many
admissions offices have, in effect, lost control over their
own selection criteria. They must develop the expertise to
regain it. Not to do so is unfair to Japanese applicants, who
are paying application fees to participate in a fair
competition, not a lottery.</p>
<p>The worries of some Japanese companies about
American-educated M.B.A.s are based on similar
misunderstandings. It's common for Japanese graduates to
complain that after returning to their corporations, they use
virtually none of the training they received in the U.S. It's
also increasingly common for such graduates to resent this
fact and occasionally to act upon it, forsaking lifetime
employment with the companies that sponsored their
educations. This quiet discontent is why the executive search
industry is growing in Japan and why some American investment
companies now make discreet contacts with sponsored Japanese
students at U.S. business schools.</p>
<p>This non-Japanese but characteristically M.B.A.-like
behavior causes consternation. Japanese companies need to
understand that business schools raise students' career
expectations, and that these expectations, not the disloyalty
of specific employees, are behind such defections. Unless
Japanese companies change managerial career tracks for
M.B.A.s, such attrition will be a necessary cost of sending
students to top American schools.</p>
<p>Another misunderstanding concerns Japanese perceptions of
the relative quality of U.S. schools. Japanese M.B.A.
applicants are brand-conscious. Hundreds of well-qualified
Japanese students are disappointed every year simply because
they focus their admissions efforts on only a handful of
schools. The students should learn the admissions tactics
that most college-bound Americans learn in high school, such
as identifying a "safety" school.</p>
<p>On the U.S. side, many excellent M.B.A. programs that
would welcome Japanese students are frustrated by a shortage
of applicants. These schools should work, either
independently or through professional associations, to get
the word out.</p>
<p>The sizable numbers of Japanese students in American
business schools is one of the few consistently encouraging
recent trends in the rocky relationship between the two
nations. But both sides can do better in nurturing this
trend. This current success in U.S.-Japanese relations should
not fall victim, like so many others, to incomprehension and
distrust.</p>
