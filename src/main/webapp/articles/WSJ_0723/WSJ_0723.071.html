	<p class="article-leader">MOSCOW -- A consignment of clothes from Eastern Europe has
just arrived at Moscow's Belgrade department store. An
expectant crowd soon gathers on the sidewalk outside, only to
be shooed away by seven beefy policemen with truncheons.
   The police point to a handwritten sign in the window:
"Closed to the public." The only people they let in, a few at
a time, are those with special printed invitations to shop at
the store.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It's outrageous," an elderly woman shouts at the police.
"Even when there's something to buy, it's not for sale."</p>
<p>In an office high above the crowd, meanwhile, store
director Nina Moskaleva entertains four visitors. As they sip
coffee, smiling store assistants bring in an array of men's
suits from East Germany, leather shoes from Italy and winter
boots from Yugoslavia. The visitors are impressed. "You
really can't purchase these anywhere," confides one, a
middle-aged Georgian, packing three pair of dapper woolen
trousers and some boots into his bag.</p>
<p>The Soviet state-run retail system has never been a model
of efficiency. But over the past few months, as shortages of
most goods have become the norm, it has all but broken down.
Across the nation, consumers now need more than just money to
buy anything worth having, particularly imported goods. They
either must have a special invitation to shop, be unusually
ingenious, or know people who will sell them goods under the
counter.</p>
<p>The breakdown in retailing is one of the worst failings of
perestroika, Mikhail Gorbachev's attempt to overhaul the
economy. It has enraged consumers and fed the burgeoning
black market. It also puts a question mark over the
effectiveness of any big aid program for the Soviets of the
sort being considered by the U.S. and Western Europe. Even
when imports arrive, the murky distribution system means they
rarely reach most ordinary people, except through the back
door.</p>
<p>"Ugly forms of commodity distribution have emerged," Prime
Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov told parliament recently, explaining
why shopping has become so difficult. Otto Latsis, a leading
economist, is more blunt. "Trade has actually ceased to
exist," he told the Izvestia daily. "For people this is not
abstract statistics, but a fact of life they have to face
each time they go shopping."</p>
<p>At the top of the list of government and consumer
complaints is shopping by invitation, a fast-growing form of
special distribution. It involves big factories cutting deals
with department stores such as the Belgrade to enable their
workers to buy hard-to-find goods.</p>
<p>For example, people wanting a refrigerator or a television
set apply to union officials at their workplace. When a
consignment arrives at the store, the officials hand out
coupons entitling workers to buy the items. In Moscow alone,
invitation shopping has soared 20-fold since 1986, accounting
for sales last year of $2.5 billion.</p>
<p>The procedure is fraught with so many difficulties that
authorities in Moscow are now trying to ban it. One drawback
is that people who don't work for enterprises big enough to
organize such activities lose out. So do pensioners and
others who don't work at all.</p>
<p>Moreover, with demand far outstripping supply, corruption
is rampant. In theory, union officials give invitations to
people who work well. In practice, they often keep them for
themselves.</p>
<p>"No social justice is achieved this way," complains Vasily
Buslakov, a senior official in the Ministry of Trade. "It's
accompanied by all sorts of abuse of power that are very
difficult to control."</p>
<p>Sometimes the abuse of power is so blatant it backfires.
Workers at a rubber factory in Yaroslavl almost went on
strike recently when 90 out of 108 video recorders ended up
being taken by union and factory officials instead of handed
out to the workforce, according to Alexander Tsvetkov, a
local journalist who exposed the incident.</p>
<p>"In times of shortages, you can't eliminate certain
subjective approaches to questions of distribution,"
acknowledges Pyotr Fyodorov, a senior official at labor union
headquarters in Moscow. "Only Jesus Christ could distribute
five loaves and two fishes to thousands of people fairly."</p>
<p>Mr. Fyodorov says union bosses are opposed to their
officials' organizing such activities, fearing that it harms
labor's already poor reputation. But many factories ignore
such objections. They argue that shopping by invitation is
still better for workers than having to shop at depleted
stores or on the black market.</p>
<p>In fact, the practice has added a new twist to the shadow
economy: the rise of a new, semi-legal options market. An
invitation to buy a color TV set costing 600 rubles may trade
for 200 rubles and upward. The right to buy furniture worth
10,000 rubles goes for about 2,000 rubles.</p>
<p>"Strictly speaking, it's not a crime," frowns Col. Mikhail
Shestopalov. "It's sale of a right, not a good."</p>
<p>Col. Shestopalov is the Elliot Ness of Soviet shopping. A
beefy plain-clothes cop with thick glasses and slicked-back
hair, he runs the Moscow Administration for Combating Theft
of Socialist Property, with the mission of fighting the black
market. He has his work cut out for him.</p>
<p>"Speculators" are the main target -- people who aim to buy
low and sell high. Such an ambition may be close to the heart
of capitalism, but in the Soviet Union it is illegal.
Authorities hate it because it involves people siphoning off
goods from the state sector, where prices are fixed, and
reselling them for a big markup on street corners. As the
number of products in short supply has soared, speculating
has become big business.</p>
<p>"In principle there's speculation with everything --
everything except for bread," Col. Shestopalov growls. "In
the U.S. you had it during Prohibition. Now we're in a tough
situation."</p>
<p>Well-organized groups of black marketeers are working
hand-in-hand with corrupt retail officials, he says,
diverting truckloads of goods ranging from shoes to mink
coats. In the first three months of this year, Col.
Shestopalov and his men caught more than twice as many
big-time speculators and store directors taking bribes as in
the whole of 1989. And that's just scratching the surface.</p>
<p>"There are entire underground department stores," says
Rimma Kogay, a retail specialist at Moscow's All-Union
Institute for Market Research. "Some speculators have goods
worth 20,000 to 30,000 rubles, the same amount a normal shop
has."</p>
<p>The black market has long played an important role in
Soviet society, enabling people to overcome the inadequacies
of the creaky state-controlled economy. For every big fish,
there are a multitude of nimble minnows. They are quick to
spot holes in the special distribution nets. Just ask Ludmila
Kurakina.</p>
<p>Mrs. Kurakina is the cheery director of the Department
Store for Newlyweds, a squat, two-story building in the north
of Moscow. It is the nearest thing to a Soviet shopper's
paradise. The shelves are laden with piles of cotton shirts
from India, woolen suits from East Germany and mountains of
socks -- an item in woefully short supply nationwide. Best of
all, behind a metal grille are rows of dainty shoes imported
from Yugoslavia and Finland.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, the Store for Newlyweds isn't open
to all. To shop here, consumers must produce documents from a
registry office showing they are to be married. Along with
the papers comes an invitation enabling the couple to shop.</p>
<p>That's where the fiddling starts.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, many young couples apply to be married in
three or four different registry offices," Mrs. Kurakina
says. That means they can buy three or four times as much.
"In fact, it's possible to get six invitations," she says:
two from the place of residence of the bride and the groom,
and one from each of four Moscow wedding palaces where people
can also go to register.</p>
<p>"They don't care about the wedding dresses," she says.
"It's the shoes they're after."</p>
<p>In the past, such abuses were impossible because the
registry offices would mark a small dot in the passports of
prospective couples. But Mr. Gorbachev inadvertently loosened
the system by ordering local bureaucracies to cover their
costs. Offices in Moscow immediately raised the price of
registering marriages from 1.5 rubles to 15 rubles and
stopped putting dots in passports. That made it lucrative for
the bureaucrats to register people as often as possible.</p>
<p>In fact, thousands of people just get engaged to go
shopping, and never get married at all. Last year, 31,500
couples didn't show up at their weddings in Moscow,
one-quarter of those who registered. "People are pretty
enterprising," Mrs. Kurakina shrugs.</p>
<p>Soviet officials say that similar scams regularly occur at
other special stores, which include shops for invalids and
war veterans. At the same time, they are trying to fight an
alarming increase in the longstanding Soviet practice of
selling scarce goods under the counter. The Russians even
have a word for it: "nalevo", or "on the left."</p>
<p>Last year the government issued instructions to all
retailers to be more vigilant. Stores now must keep a book
listing delivery and sale date of all hard-to-find and
imported goods in an effort to prevent shop assistants from
siphoning the stuff off and selling it to their friends.
Inspectors from a union-run organization called Workers'
Control drop by from time to time to take a look at the book.</p>
<p>The measure hasn't been too effective. Last year, Workers'
Control uncovered just 85 million rubles worth of goods that
had been put to one side, a drop in the bucket. For
speculators, says Col. Shestopalov, the book "isn't a big
obstacle, just an additional one."</p>
<p>His organization has had a little more success fighting
the organized crooks. In one provincial town recently,
investigators caught a couple selling invitations to buy
liquor. They had been printed and distributed by the local
town council, where the wife worked. According to Soviet news
media, the woman obtained more than 70,000 invitations
enabling the holder to buy vodka at less than half the
regular price. The scam was uncovered when police filmed one
of the couple's friends trying to buy 80 bottles at once.</p>
<p>Despite such successes, Col. Shestopalov isn't a happy
man. The only way to uncover such scams is by catching the
people red-handed, he complains. He dreams of the day when
the Soviet Union will allow police to use stings,
plea-bargaining and other techniques. "If we could use the
methods of our U.S. colleagues, it would be easier," he says.
"We would uncover much more."</p>
<p>Mr. Buslakov, the trade ministry official, isn't so sure
that giving police extra powers would help solve the problems
of the state retail industry. "We've always had speculation
and corruption," he says sadly, blaming the special
distribution networks for much of the present shortages. "I
think only a market economy can help solve the problem."</p>
