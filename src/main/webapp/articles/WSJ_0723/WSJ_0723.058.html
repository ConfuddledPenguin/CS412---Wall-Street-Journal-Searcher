	<p class="article-leader">American Brands Inc. agreed to pay $975 million to acquire
Moen Group Inc., a faucet maker, from Forstmann Little & Co.,
a leveraged buy-out firm.
   For American Brands, the acquisition sharpens the focus of
its hardware and home-improvement business. That business is
one of four areas where the Old Greenwich, Conn., company is
trying to diversify to reduce its dependence on tobacco,
which still generates 59% of its sales and 67% of its
operating profit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For Forstmann Little, the sale price represents a fat
sixfold profit for its equity investors since the New York
concern paid $840 million to acquire Stanadyne Inc., Moen's
predecessor, in March 1988.</p>
<p>American Brands stock price rose $1 a share to $70.50 in
composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange
despite a broad market decline, mainly because of
higher-than-expected second-quarter earnings.</p>
<p>For the quarter, American Brands said profit rose 32% to
$158.4 million, or $1.51 a share fully diluted, from $120.2
million, or $1.18 a share; revenue rose 8.4% to $2.95 billion
from $2.72 billion. The results were helped by strong sales
of cigarettes, including Benson & Hedges, in Britain.</p>
<p>Allan Kaplan, a beverage and tobacco analyst at Merrill
Lynch & Co., said American Brands paid "a rich price" of 10
times operating cash flow for Moen that he estimated will
dilute earnings 20 cents to 30 cents a share in 1991.
American Brands also sells life insurance, liquor and office
products.</p>
<p>Emmanuel Goldman, beverage and tobacco analyst at
PaineWebber Inc., said American Brands is targeting the
market for kitchen and bathroom repairs because homeowners
believe that in a flat real estate market, such repairs can
boost their resale price. Even so, American Brands said it
plans to sell its Waterloo tool-box business.</p>
<p>Brian Little, a founding partner of Forstmann Little, said
the sale is "a classic example of how a deal can go right,
even as the critics look back on leveraged buy-outs of the
1980s that reached a point of excess."</p>
<p>Forstmann financed the Stanadyne purchase with $75 million
in equity, $530 million in bank debt and $235 million in
subordinated debt from Forstmann's own investors. The firm
then sold five businesses in metals and auto parts for $240
million.</p>
<p>At the same time, it renamed the company Moen and boosted
its sales to $380 million from $300 million, Mr. Little said,
"by pushing distribution toward the replacement market" via
such sales outlets as Channel home centers and away from the
weaker new-housing market. Moen, which pioneered
single-handle kitchen and bathroom faucets, has about 25% of
the U.S. faucet market.</p>
<p>After debt repayment, the sale will yield Forstmann about
$500 million, giving its equity investors a gross annual
profit, before fees, of 112% and the firm's debt investors a
29% annual return. Morgan Stanley & Co. advised Forstmann,
Little & Co. on the transaction and Goldman Sachs & Co.
advised American Brands.</p>
<p>The sale is Forstmann's third big deal this year. The
buy-out firm acquired Gulfstream Aerospace from Chrysler
Corp. for $825 million and has agreed to acquire General
Instrument Corp. for $1.47 billion, or $44.50 a share.</p>
<p>General Instrument shares have been trading above the
Forstmann bid because two other concerns, Kelso & Co., a
leveraged buy-out company, and Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette
Securities Inc., have asked for information about General
Instrument, saying they might want to make a bid before a
mid-August deadline.</p>
