	<p class="article-leader">Here are the words you'll need to know for this article:
"Obscene" means "appealing to the prurient interest" and
"lacking any serious literary, artistic or scientific value."
"Indecent," a lesser standard, means "language or material .
. . patently offensive under contemporary community standards
. . . {describing} sexual or excretory activities or organs."
Finally, "awful," which is a technical term reviewers use
(see below). It doesn't count much in the current furor over
raunch in the arts.
   After the attacks on the National Endowment for the Arts
and 2 Live Crew, now it's television's turn. Recently, the
Federal Communications Commission proposed enforcing a total,
round-the-clock ban on any and all "indecent" TV broadcasts.
Maybe it's just me, but I get this creepy feeling that next
someone's going to start poking around in my sock drawer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The broadcast media -- television and radio -- are,
strangely enough, the only place in America where free speech
has never existed. It's that way by law. Because of its
"uniquely pervasive" nature, and because it's "accessible" to
kids, TV has been carefully regulated since before it was
born, by Section 1464 of the U.S. Criminal Code (Title 18),
barring both obscene and indecent emissions since 1927.
That's why no one exists from the waist down on television.</p>
<p>While obscenity provisions have always been enforced, no
one worried too much about indecency until George Carlin lost
his famous "seven dirty words" case in the U.S. Supreme Court
in 1978.</p>
<p>Even then, the rule was only enforced for programming
between 6 a.m. and 8 p.m. The point was to protect kids. No
one cared too much about indecency in the evening hours, when
most children supposedly weren't watching. But just over a
week ago, the strict new 24-hour scrutiny of indecency was
proposed, effectively reducing everyone's television to a
juvenile level.</p>
<p>FCC spokeswoman Sandy Wilson, special assistant to the
general council, states, "A lot of people think we've gone
too far; we think we're on solid ground. If you actually see
the shows we're talking about, it puts the whole question in
a different light."</p>
<p>Only shows on radio have so far been subject to FCC
indecency fines. Ms. Wilson cites two: "One on how to play
the piano with one's penis, and one on how to masturbate your
dog." Your dog? I guess you wouldn't want kids to realize
that grown people actually get paid for sitting around and
thinking up anything so incredibly dumb.</p>
<p>The creative community definitely is up in arms over the
FCC report. Julie Hoover, a spokeswoman for ABC, says, "We
are very concerned about the scope of the ruling. We believe
that a 24-hour ban is unconstitutional." Edward Zwick,
executive producer of "thirtysomething" (one of the shows
mentioned as a possible victim of the report, though not by
Ms. Wilson, who is a fan), terms it "a horrifying notion that
government would presume to legislate content." Surprisingly,
even Peggy Charren, president of Action for Children's
Television, opposes the FCC notion: "We want to increase
diversity on TV for children, not limit it. Remember,
obscenity is already illegal. The way the FCC has defined
indecency could do in `Bullwinkle.' It's amazing that just
when we're instructing people around the world about the
beauty of free speech, we're doing away with it in this
country."</p>
<p>Ironically, even if the U.S. Appeals Court (DC circuit)
upholds the FCC's stand, which bench watchers consider a
50-50 proposition at best, industry insiders say it won't
have that much effect. First, it only covers broadcast, not
cable. Second, as Garth Ancier, president of Walt Disney TV
(formerly head of Fox TV) says, "The networks are still quite
conservative. They could go further and come nowhere near the
FCC limit on profanity. The real limits are set by the
advertisers, who are far more sensitive to language and
content issues. The advertisers want an environment so
non-threatening it verges on un-entertaining."</p>
<p>Indeed, the networks seem so unconcerned about the FCC
statement that just three days after it came out, CBS
President Howard Stringer was telling reporters that he
intended to get away from their "bland," "dull" programming,
and spice he fall up with at least one show that's "slightly
crude" and "coarse."</p>
<p>My thought on all of this is, if the FCC really wants to
get into the business of regulating morals, there is a whole
series of really useful things it could regulate. It could
start by outlawing any show that features Brent Mushberger or
Vanna White. Then too, it could do away with all the programs
that have titles like "America's Funniest . . ." or
"America's Cutest Pets." And how about professional
wrestling? What are those big guys in those skimpy tights
doing in that ring anyway?</p>
<p>Mr. Zwick brightens perceptibly at the idea: "I like it]"
he says. "It's a modest proposal. How about we limit the
number of car crashes per hour?" How about violence
altogether? Mr. Ancier has to shake his head at the "cultural
imbalance" where films like "Total Recall" -- featuring arms
pulled out of sockets and blood flowing across the screen --
gets only a PG-13 rating. In film, as in TV, it's worse to
bare a breast than to blow it apart with a machine gun.</p>
<p>Of course, my secret dream is an FCC decree barring stupid
shows. "A stupidity test?" Mr. Ancier chuckles. "There'd be
so many time slots open. I don't think the industry could
meet that challenge. What could they do without `Mr.
Belvedere?'"</p>
<p>So to the FCC, now proposing to shield our kids from
indecent material even when they're asleep, I offer this
thought: The government is not a babysitter. The hourly wage
is just too high. Each parent can, in the privacy of his own
home, read the manual and learn how to unplug the TV set.
Because what's really indecent is how much TV -- how much
AWFUL TV -- kids are watching, complete with commercials for
Mutant Ninja Barbies. Arbitron today measures ratings of
children two to 11, and it measures them in the millions. Get
a life, kids]</p>
<p>Frankly, with the average household now watching more than
seven hours of TV a day, it's obvious that, children and
adults alike, we're a nation of tuboholics. It's not healthy.
Clearly, we have no will power. I think we need some help,
and I know just the government agency for the job. Not the
FCC, the CIA. It's probably at it already, hooking up the
master on/off switch in Washington.</p>
<p>In the meantime, a word of advice for the FCC: The problem
isn't from the waist down. It's from the neck up.</p>
