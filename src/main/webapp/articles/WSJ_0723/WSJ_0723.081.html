	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Withdrawals at savings and loans continued
to outpace deposits in January and February, and produced a
$13.3 billion net outflow in January, the Office of Thrift
Supervision said.
   For the two months, the net outflows totaled $19.9
billion, compared with $20 billion in the same period last
year. This past January's outflow grew from the $10.7 billion
in net withdrawals a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The outflows result from efforts by savings and loans to
meet regulations under the S&L cleanup law, which requires
thrifts to hold a greater amount of capital as a percentage
of assets.</p>
<p>S&Ls with lower deposits don't have to hold as much
capital, and many thrifts have lowered the rates they pay
depositors in order to allow controlled outflows of deposits.
Capital is the equity that the thrifts hold, and acts as a
cushion to taxpayer-backed deposit insurance.</p>
<p>"It just tells us that, clearly, so many institutions
still don't meet the new capital requirements," said James
Barth, an Auburn University economist.</p>
<p>Mr. Barth said the deposit withdrawals may also indicate
that some depositors are concerned that with so many federal
S&L takeovers, their funds could be tied up. The deposits are
all guaranteed for as much as $100,000.</p>
<p>"Either way, it still suggests that we have massive
consolidation and shrinkage, and that's been the story for a
year now," Mr. Barth said.</p>
<p>Total deposits at all 2,527 solvent and insolvent S&Ls --
354 fewer institutions than a year ago -- fell to $796.3
billion in February 1990 from $927 billion a year earlier.</p>
<p>Mr. Barth said it's possible that a recent spate of media
coverage about S&L woes could fuel an acceleration in
withdrawals, but later data haven't been released yet.
"Unfortunately, we are getting numbers for January and
February, and it's July," he said.</p>
<p>The thrift office, which was overhauled a year ago under
the S&L bailout law, was recently reorganized and has
frequently delayed the publication of its data.</p>
