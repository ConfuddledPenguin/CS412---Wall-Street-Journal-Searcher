	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- "Twin Peaks" is weird television, and it's
about to make for offbeat publishing.
   Fans of the ABC series about creepy crimes in the
imaginary logging town of Twin Peaks will find "Laura
Palmer's Secret Diary" in bookstores this fall. A diary kept
by the show's prom-queen murder victim figured in last
season's plot, but this is supposed to be an earlier,
still-secret diary, which may be written into next season's
episodes.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Doughnut-loving FBI agent Dale Cooper will also be
published in September, but on audiotape. Mr. Cooper is
frequently seen on the show talking into a tiny tape-recorder
to his secretary Diane. Will people who like to watch him
free on television pay up just to hear his voice -- even with
new clues to the murderer's identity?</p>
<p>The diaries and tapes are just a few of the unusual Twin
Peaks items that will be published by Simon & Schuster Inc.,
a unit of Paramount Communications Inc. Simon & Schuster's
Pocketbooks unit said it signed an agreement with the show's
creators, filmmaker David Lynch and his co-producer Mark
Frost, to publish as many as five books in the next 18
months, with additional titles possible if the show survives.
The publisher declined to discuss terms of the agreement.</p>
<p>Twin Peaks books are just one aspect of a massive
merchandising effort with a twist; the items will be approved
and sometimes designed by the show's creators, and are meant
to echo its witty surrealism. Licensing expert Seth Siegel of
Hamilton Projects Inc., New York, was hired only a few weeks
ago, but he already has dozens of ideas far beyond the usual
T-shirts and mugs. Mr. Siegel plans to license everything
from Twin Peaks bumperstickers and backscratchers to a
collection of psychedelic Dr. Jacoby ties. He has major
retail chains lined up for huge displays and he is talking to
coffee and baked goods companies about Twin Peaks coffee and
Twin Peaks cherry pie (Agent Cooper's favorite fare).</p>
<p>"We want this to be as big as possible without creating
any backlash or cynicism about the show," says Mr. Siegel.
"Every so often a TV series or movie becomes a style
statement of the day, like `Miami Vice.' We feel `Twin Peaks'
will do the same."</p>
<p>Concern that the show could be a short-lived fad with a
limited cult following hasn't affected executives at
Pocketbooks either. "We normally don't publish tie-ins to
television shows because they are so ephemeral," says William
Grose, editorial director of Pocketbooks. "But the hard-core
audience of Twin Peaks is committed and intelligent, and they
seem to be the kind of people who read books and can be led
to a bookstore more readily" than fans of some other shows.
Besides, Mr. Grose himself is an admitted "Peaks freak."</p>
<p>Irwyn Applebaum, publisher of Pocketbooks, says books need
a much smaller audience to succeed than do television shows.
"The original Star Trek series didn't survive on TV in the
ratings, but it has lasted 25 years in book form," says Mr.
Applebaum.</p>
<p>Pocketbooks is a sister company to Paramount Pictures,
which syndicates "Star Trek," and in the past decade,
Pocketbooks has published more than 60 Star Trek books. Most
are "original novels," based on the show's characters, and
many have been paperback best sellers.</p>
<p>Ed Victor, a literary agent, said the Twin Peaks book
projects were dreamed up by himself and Mr. Frost, the show's
co-producer, along with Mr. Lynch's television agent, Tony
Krantz of Creative Artists Agency. It was decided that a
straightforward novelization of the series wasn't offbeat
enough, considering the original material, says Mr. Victor.
At a brainstorming session, the three men dreamed up a whole
series of ideas, many of which Pocketbooks is considering.</p>
<p>After Laura Palmer's diary (which was actually written by
Mr. Lynch's daughter, Jennifer) and Agent Cooper's tapes,
expect to see some of the following: an epic James
Michener-style novel that will tell the history of Twin Peaks
"going back to the settlers and Indians," says Mr. Victor;
the high school yearbook of Twin Peaks High School, possibly
called "The Logroller;" and perhaps a travel guide to Twin
Peaks.</p>
