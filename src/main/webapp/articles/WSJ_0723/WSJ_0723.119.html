	<p class="article-leader">LORAL CORP. (New York) -- Standard & Poor's Corp. said it
placed this defense contractor's triple B-plus senior debt
and triple B subordinated debt ratings on its CreditWatch
with negative implications. About $410 million in debt is
affected. S&P's action followed Loral's announcement that is
a finalist in the bidding for the aerospace operations of
Ford Motor Co. The acquisition could be well in excess of
$500 million, S&P said, and Loral's credit quality could be
hurt if it acquired the operations largely with debt.
Officials of Loral couldn't be reached for comment Friday.
