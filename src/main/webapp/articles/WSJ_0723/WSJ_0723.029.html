	<p class="article-leader">Boeing Co. said it is holding discussions with Aeritalia
of Italy and Aerospatiale of France about the sale of the
Seattle-based company's perennially unprofitable de Havilland
commuter airplane division.
   Separately on Friday, Boeing said it will build a $350
million plant on 500 acres southeast of Tacoma, Wash., to
make wing parts for its 747, 767 and proposed 767-X wide-body
commercial-jet lines. The announcement about the "skin and
spar" factory underscored how cash-rich Boeing must expand
its manufacturing space to meet its burgeoning backlog of
airliner orders.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But its tiny commuter airplane unit, by contrast, has been
faltering badly. Analysts were baffled about a sale price for
the division, which Boeing purchased for $112 million from
the Canadian government in 1986.</p>
<p>"They have so many problems, it's nearly impossible to
figure out what it could fetch," said Bill Whitlow, who
follows Boeing for Dain Bosworth Inc., a brokerage firm based
in Seattle. Boeing has poured hundreds of millions of dollars
into de Havilland but has never been able to turn it around.</p>
<p>A Boeing spokesman declined to elaborate on the
negotiations, except to say that "any transaction would
involve an orderly transfer of responsibility to the buyers,"
including the necessary approval from Canadian authorities.
Pierre Lestringant, president of Aerospatiale Fianance Corp.,
a U.S. subsidiary of the French aerospace concern, also
wouldn't comment. Neither would Stefano Ruocco, president of
Italian Aerospace Industries USA, which is owned by
Aeritalia.</p>
<p>Aerospatiale and Aeritalia already have teamed up on a
venture to make commuter planes, called ATRs for the first
letters of the French words for regional transport aircraft.
People close to the Boeing deal said an acquisition of the de
Havilland Dash-8 turboprop line would be a natural way to
help Aerospatiale and Aeritalia expand their offerings in the
increasingly competitive commuter aircraft market.</p>
<p>The two types of Dash-8 planes seat as many as 39 and 54
passengers, and de Havilland has been contemplating building
a new series that would seat 65 to 70. The ATR seats as many
as 48 or 66, depending on the model.</p>
<p>The move to sell de Havilland hardly comes as a surprise.
Some Canadian analysts had been expecting Boeing just to
shutter the operation. Jerry Cantwell, who monitors the
aerospace industry for Wertheim Schroder & Co. in New York,
estimates that Boeing had a loss of $35 million at de
Havilland last year and will register a $25 million deficit
at the unit this year.</p>
<p>When Boeing bought de Havilland, it believed it could
capitalize on the growing number of major airlines, the
company's regular customers, that were initiating commuter
routes. And unit sales lately have grown strongly; at the end
of June, de Havilland had delivered 211 Dash-8s and boasted a
backlog for an additional 125.</p>
<p>But pricing is tough in a market swarming with
international competitors, including Embraer of Brazil,
Canadair and Saab. And cost control has been dismal.</p>
<p>In an interview with the Seattle Times in May, Boeing
Chairman Frank Shrontz said the company had "misjudged the
degree to which {de Havilland} lacks disciplinary procedures
and operation." He added: "We're used to operating in a
situation where there may be too many controls on processes,
but at least we have some control indicators where problems
are and what works. They didn't have."</p>
<p>Labor disputes haven't helped. This year marked only the
first time in two decades of union bargaining that the
Canadian Auto Workers didn't strike de Havilland. The unit
has nearly 6,000 employees.</p>
<p>And Boeing has been disappointed in what it has perceived
as inadequate support from the Canadian government. In
February, Boeing accepted a $134 million settlement from
Ottawa, which included the payment of claims arising from
costs the company incurred to correct alleged health and
safety hazards at de Havilland's main plant in Toronto.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, construction of the new facility in Washington
state could begin before the end of the year, and the plant
could be operational as early as mid-1992. It will have about
300 employees, the core of whom will be transferred from a
site in Auburn, Wash., where most of Boeing's 15,000
fabrication employees work. The company said operations at
the Auburn plant won't be affected.</p>
<p>In addition, Boeing said Friday that it will build a new
$30 million facility on 20 acres in Puyallup, Wash., for its
tool grind operation, where tools from all of Boeing's Puget
Sound factories will be sharpened. The shop will be relocated
from Auburn, along with its 270 employees.</p>
<p>Both proposed buildings will be in Pierce County, and Mr.
Shrontz praised the "supportive attitude" of local officials
there. In a statement, he said that the company was operating
"at or near capacity" in all of its Puget Sound locations and
that expanding is "imperative." Boeing has about 103,000
employees in the area.</p>
