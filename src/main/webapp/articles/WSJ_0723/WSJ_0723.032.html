<p>SYNOPTICS COMMUNICATIONS Inc. reported second-quarter
earnings of 34 cents a share, which was 19% greater than the
average estimate of analysts as compiled by Zacks Investment
Research. Because of a database error, SynOptics' earnings
were mistakenly listed as a negative surprise in the
Quarterly Earnings Surprises table in Friday's edition.</p>
