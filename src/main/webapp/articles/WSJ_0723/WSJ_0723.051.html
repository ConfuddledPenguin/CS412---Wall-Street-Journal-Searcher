	<p class="article-leader">HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Chrysler Corp. offered its union
employees part ownership of the company and incentive
payments in return for helping the auto maker slash costs.
   Chrysler officials didn't provide details such as how much
stock the company would offer workers, and the sketchy
proposal seemed to raise more questions than it answered.
Union officials immediately said they didn't take the offer
seriously. But Chrysler says it needs radical measures to
close the cost gap with Japanese competitors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"What we desperately need at Chrysler is cost parity,"
said Anthony P. St. John, Chrysler vice president for
employee relations. "The long-term result of not being
competitive . . . is failure." In addition to offering the
UAW a piece of the company, Mr. St. John said Chrysler would
be willing to give UAW workers bonuses for meeting specific
productivity goals.</p>
<p>Chrysler's sales and earnings are mired in a steep slump,
and crucial new products are still two years away. The
company wants to be the UAW's target for negotiating a
pattern contract for the Big Three auto makers, because
Chrysler believes it can't afford to be as generous as
General Motors Corp. or Ford Motor Co. If it isn't the
target, Chrysler would like a different contract -- although
breaking a pattern is near-anathema to the UAW.</p>
<p>In return for stock and bonus payments, the auto maker
wants greater flexibility to operate its plants. It also
wants the union's support for a plan to build a health care
network with other employers that would help cut Chrysler's
steep medical care bills, which are about $700 for each
vehicle sold.</p>
<p>Chrysler is asking similar moves from its white-collar
employees. They have been invited to bet a portion of their
salaries on the performance of the company -- specifically,
on whether Chrysler can meet ambitious cost-cutting goals.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time Chrysler has offered stock in
return for the union's assistance. A decade ago, when
Chrysler teetered near bankruptcy, it got wage concessions
from the union. In return, Chrysler paid stock into a fund to
be distributed to workers. In 1985 the company and union
agreed to terminate the fund, and Chrysler distributed $550
million to 87,500 hourly workers in the U.S. and Canada. The
workers had a choice of getting stock or cash, and most took
cash.</p>
<p>Also in return for concessions, the company named Douglas
Fraser, then the UAW president, to its board. Owen Bieber,
the current UAW president, still sits on Chrysler's board.</p>
<p>Mr. Bieber has called on the Big Three auto makers to give
union workers more say in management decisions, and to view
workers as equal partners. But several union officials said
privately that Chrysler's proposal was wildly unrealistic.
Publicly, however, a UAW spokesman said, "It's far too early
in the process to begin responding in the press to specific
proposals."</p>
<p>Analysts responded favorably to Chrysler's employee
ownership and incentive initiatives. "We've seen in company
after company that if you own part of the company, you work
smarter," said Ronald Glantz, an analyst with Dean Witter in
San Francisco.</p>
<p>On Friday, Chrysler stock closed at $16, down 50 cents in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Officials of GM and Ford, which also opened negotiations
with the UAW last week, said they would wait for Chrysler to
be more specific before commenting on its move.</p>
<p>Chrysler has the highest labor costs of the Big Three --
$33 an hour, compared with $31 an hour for Ford, and $30 an
hour for GM. And the Japanese factories in the U.S. that have
eroded Chrysler's share of the car market in recent months
enjoy labor costs about $10 an hour below Chrysler's.</p>
<p>While these Japanese-owned plants simply operate more
efficiently, some of the cost gap is beyond Chrysler's
control. Its employees are older, and the ratio of retired
employees to active workers is higher than GM's or Ford's.
The Japanese plants are new, and have virtually no retirees.</p>
<p>These problems are compounded by the 13% drop in
Chrysler's vehicle sales this year. The auto maker has said
it expects a second straight year of negative cash flow in
1990. The company is expected to post a sharply lower
second-quarter profit and said last week it expects a
"substantial loss" in the third quarter.</p>
<p>In outlining Chrysler's initiative, Mr. St. John said the
gain-sharing concept would reward workers at Chrysler plants
for meeting specific productivity targets, such as lower
absenteeism rates. The concept is similar to plans in many
factories around the nation.</p>
<p>Chrysler said it also needs the flexibility to institute
three shift operations at certain plants. Last fall, the
company and union leaders agreed to such a plan for
Chrysler's minivan plant in St. Louis. But workers at the
plant voted down the plan. Three-shift production would allow
the company to boost output and profit from a plant, without
substantial spending for additional facilities.</p>
<p>In a related cost-cutting initiative, Chrysler said it
wants to join with another large employer to build a
multi-employer health care network. That would enable the
auto maker to cut medical costs through efficiency of scale,
Chrysler said.</p>
<p>Unless it creates a multi-employer health care trust fund,
Chrysler's health care costs will increase by about $7 an
hour, per employee, Mr. St. John said. That's because a new
federal rule will force employers to allow health care
retirement benefits to accrue while employees are still on
the job, he said.</p>
