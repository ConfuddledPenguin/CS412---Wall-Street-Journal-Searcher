	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Four investors here are seeking a controlling
interest in Polifly Financial Corp., the New Milford, N.J.,
holding company for Polifly Savings & Loan Association.
   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the group,
which holds 9.99% of Polifly, said it proposed acquiring
control by buying new shares from the company. The proposal,
outlined in a May 29 letter to the company, is subject to
negotiation and discussions and may be modified or abandoned,
the filing said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The group, which hasn't obtained the financing needed to
buy a controlling interest, also plans to ask Polifly for
representation on the board, the filing said.</p>
<p>The investors are Haralambos S. Kostakopoulos, chairman of
Hsky Inc., a bank-advisory firm; Nicola Biase, a financial
consultant and U.S. representative of Findim Investments S.A.
of Massagno, Switzerland, which has financial and other
interests; Emmanuel M. Kontokosta, a general partner and
engineer at Kontokosta Associates; and Nikos Mouyiaris,
president of Mana Products Inc., a cosmetics manufacturer.</p>
<p>Hsky and Kontokosta are in Manhattan; Mana is in Long
Island City, N.Y. Findim, which has an office in Manhattan,
is a subsidiary of Findim S.p.A., Milan.</p>
<p>The investors acquired the shares of Polifly between June
27 and July 13 at $1.50 to $2.28 a share. Polifly shares
closed Friday at $2.19, up 19 cents, in national
over-the-counter trading.</p>
<p>Polifly has had financial problems. This year it signed an
agreement with federal thrift regulators substantially
restricting its activities. The bank also is bringing in new
managers: Last month, it named Joseph S. Paparatto president
and chief executive officer, and this month, Frederick T.
Muller, who had been acting chief executive, resigned as
chairman.</p>
<p>Mr. Paparatto, who assumed the chairmanship as well on
July 11, says the filing is under review but declined further
comment.</p>
