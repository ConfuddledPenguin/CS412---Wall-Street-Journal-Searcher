Diamond H. Controls Ltd. unit to Yale & Valor PLC. Terms
weren't disclosed, but Oak said the price is "substantially
in excess of book value."
   Oak, a maker of electrical and electronics parts and
controls said that it decided to sell the British unit
because it prefers to invest proceeds in the U.S. where it
can take advantage of corporate tax-loss carryforwards.
