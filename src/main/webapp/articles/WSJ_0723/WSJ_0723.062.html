	<p class="article-leader">"The Cosby Show" used to be mass advertisers' ideal way to
reach consumers. This coming season, though, the venerable
Cosby is getting some stiff competition from Peter Pan,
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and the New Kids on the Block.
   After years of talking about the spending power of kids,
advertisers are finally betting real money to try to prove
it. Advertisers that used to ignore the kids' market are
waking up and discovering after-school and Saturday morning
TV. "Up-front" sales of network ad time for kids' programming
ballooned for the coming season, fueled by new advertisers
ranging from microwave dinners to fastfood chains. The big
jump came even as prime-time ad sales fell short of
expectations. Kiddie cable and syndicated kid shows had
blockbuster ad sales too.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The influence on spending by kids has become apparent to
everybody, and that's the reason there's more money for
everyone," says Paul Rittenberg, vice president of daytime
and kids' sales for Capital Cities/ABC's network. Despite
mounds of research and years of lecturing by ad industry
gurus on kids' buying power, he says, "it's taken a while to
sink into the ad agency planning process."</p>
<p>Anyone up early enough to catch the Saturday morning
cartoons on TV this fall will find a new group of advertisers
joining the usual candy, cereal and toy hawkers. Ad
executives say microwave foods, such as Tyson Foods' new
Looney Tune meals for kids, are becoming major spenders. So
are sneaker companies that apparently have decided they had
better hook the kids before they grow into brand-obsessed
teens. And Burger King is making a major new kids' push, in
an aggressive bid to invade McDonald's warm-and-fuzzy Ronald
McDonald turf, ad executives say.</p>
<p>Adding to the spending spree, traditional toy companies
are beefing up their ad budgets this year, people in the
industry say.</p>
<p>The kids' market has a "relatively small number of
advertisers," says Jerry Dominus, senior vice president of
entertainment marketing and sales for CBS. "When you have key
players stepping up spending, and add in a few totally new
contenders, it really ratchets up the market."</p>
<p>Loretta Volpe, senior vice president and director of media
and marketing services for ad agency Griffin Bacal, whose
clients include Hasbro, Playskool and Milton Bradley, adds:
"This was one of the craziest kid marketplaces of any time.
It just exploded."</p>
<p>All told, the kid-show boom adds up to tens of millions of
new kiddie-TV dollars. Industry executives estimate that the
three major networks brought in a total of $155 million to
$165 million for this fall's kids' TV ad time, up sharply
from about $135 million a year earlier. On top of that, News
Corp.'s Fox network is offering its first kids' lineup,
including a daily animated Peter Pan cartoon and several
Saturday morning shows, that ad executives estimate took in
an additional $30 million. And this fall, ABC will roll out a
new animated New Kids on the Block show.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, syndicated kiddie shows, aired on independent
stations and network affiliates, saw an equally powerful ad
surge. That market was propelled largely on the strength of
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" and Buena Vista Television's
new two-hour kiddie schedule called "Disney Afternoon."</p>
<p>The Disney shows, aired Monday through Friday and
including the popular "Chip 'n' Dale's Rescue Rangers" and
"Duck Tales," proved to be some of the strongest contenders
in the kiddie market. Mark Zoradi, vice president and general
manager of Buena Vista Television, says the four shows in the
two-hour block pulled in $71 million in upfront ad sales.</p>
<p>That would make Buena Vista a bigger player than any of
the three major networks. Industry executives estimate that
ABC was the biggest network player, with about $65 million in
upfront sales, followed by CBS with $50 million to $55
million, and then General Electric Co.'s NBC with $40 million
to $45 million.</p>
<p>Certainly, advertisers had reasons for moving money into
the kids' market other than just deciding the ad industry's
research departments were right about kids after all. For
one, prime time has gotten stratospherically expensive: "The
networks keep seeing an erosion in ratings, but the prices
don't go down. The kids' market is so much less expensive,"
Griffin Bacal's Ms. Volpe says. She also credits the catfight
shaping up among the networks, Disney's powerhouse programs
and upstart contender Fox.</p>
<p>At its heart, though, the boom in the kiddie market
suggests that advertisers are finally realizing just how
tight a hold on the family pursestrings kids really have. Not
only do kids personally spend about $4 billion in allowance
money each year, estimates Children's Market Research Group,
a New York-based research firm, but they influence families'
decisions on another $60 billion worth of purchases --
everything from vacations to computers.</p>
<p>"I'm beginning to get calls from advertisers who are
recognizing it's both the parents and the children who make
decisions," says Selina Guber, Children's Market Research
president. And while she has been preaching about kids'
spending power for years, she adds, the advertisers' interest
"is definitely a recent trend."</p>

<p>FCB Wins Coors Job</p>
<p>Coors Brewing Co. pulled its estimated $20 million to $25
million Coors Extra Gold account from GSD&M and handed it to
Foote, Cone & Belding, Chicago.</p>
<p>Golden, Colo.-based Coors wouldn't say what prompted the
switch of the big beer account. A spokeswoman would only say
that the move resulted after a "periodic agency review
process," adding, "We're fortunate to have agencies that are
very talented, and we need to draw resources from them as
needed."</p>
<p>The win is a big addition to the Coors business at Foote
Cone, the shop that already handles ads for the company's
Coors Light, Keystone and Killian's Red brands. New ads for
Coors Extra Gold are expected to begin airing in December.</p>
<p>GSD&M, in Austin, Texas, continues to handle the ad
account for the regular Coors brand and Hispanic ad
responsibilities for Coors and Coors Light brands.</p>

<p>Ad Notes. . . .</p>
<p>JHIRMACK SWITCH: Playtex Family Products Corp., less than
a year after awarding its Jhirmack hair-care account to
Backer Spielvogel Bates, switched the business to Rosenfeld,
Sirowitz, Humphrey & Strauss. According to Leading National
Advertisers, Playtex spent nearly $13 million advertising the
brand last year. New York-based Rosenfeld Sirowitz handled
the account from 1978 until last September. Backer Spielvogel
is a unit of Saatchi & Saatchi. Stamford, Conn.-based Playtex
couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
