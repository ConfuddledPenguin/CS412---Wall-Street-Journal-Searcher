	<p class="article-leader">BURBANK, Calif. -- Walt Disney Co. and the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency reached a settlement over
allegations that hazardous paint thinner and other cleaning
solvents used at Disneyland for two years were dumped
illegally at sites in Utah and Wyoming.
   Under the settlement, Disney "accepts responsibility" for
the violations, but the EPA agrees these violations were
unintentional. Disney will pay a $550,000 fine and develop
both an environmental audit for Disneyland and a training
program which will include techniques for supervising
third-party contractors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It's by leaps and bounds the largest penalty ever for
this region," said EPA enforcement attorney David Janik.</p>
<p>Disney last week filed a lawsuit in state court in Orange
County, Calif., against Ken's Oil Co. of Garden Grove,
Calif., charging breach of contract and fraud and asking for
unspecified damages. It was Ken's that between May 1987 and
August 1989 hauled about 14,000 gallons of waste from
Disneyland to sites in Utah and Wyoming which, according to
the EPA, often were mislabeled and dumped at facilities
unauthorized to dispose of this kind of waste.</p>
<p>Ken's co-owner, Juanita Schow, said she didn't know about
the lawsuit. "We're just the haulers," she said. "The
responsibility is theirs."</p>
<p>Although the EPA has been investigating the alleged
violations for about one year, the affair was kept quiet and
the charges were filed at the same time as the settlement.</p>
<p>"No company wants to splash this kind of thing in the
papers," said Kim Murphy, the former marine biologist and
Imagineering executive whom Disney appointed vice president
of environmental policy earlier this year in the wake of
other environmental controversies.</p>
<p>"We're a very visible target," added a Disney spokesman.
"There's an old saying, `It's the nail whose head sticks up
that gets hit.' "</p>
<p>In January, Walt Disney World in Florida was fined $10,000
after pleading guilty to a charge of violating the federal
Migratory Bird Treaty Act after 15 black vultures that had
been confined in a small shed on Discovery Island died.</p>
<p>In April, Mr. Murphy said, the EPA fined Disney more than
$300,000 over the discharge of secondarily treated sewage
into wetlands. Mr. Murphy said the program was an experiment
to provide nutrients to the area and that permits were
obtained, but that the EPA closed the program down because
Disney was exceeding federal nutrient-level guidelines.</p>
<p>In 1988, Disney settled a similar hazardous waste case
with the state of Florida over storage and labeling of
materials at Walt Disney World. Disney paid a $150,000 fine.</p>
<p>In 1989, Disney paid a $2,500 fine to the EPA in Boston
for violations of the Toxic Substances Control Act in a case
involving the shipping of monorail cars with coolants
containing toxic polychlorinated biphenyls.</p>
<p>In the case of the Disneyland waste material, "we relied
on {Ken's Oil} to give us instructions on how to do this kind
of thing," said Mr. Murphy. "They're the experts. The thing
we're guilty of, and it's not a good excuse, is naivete."</p>
<p>Mr. Murphy said he has assembled a task force of Disney
managers to focus on environmental issues. He also said that
a training program has been in effect for a year and that a
$100,000 environmental audit of Walt Disney World has been
completed. He is interviewing consultants for a similar audit
of company facilities in California.</p>
<p>Disneyland generates a lot of such hazardous waste. "We do
a lot of painting and cleaning," the spokesman said. "We're
well-known for it."</p>
<p>The EPA said Disney had cooperated fully with the agency.
Mr. Janik said it still was assessing the extent of the
environmental damage caused by the dumping.</p>
