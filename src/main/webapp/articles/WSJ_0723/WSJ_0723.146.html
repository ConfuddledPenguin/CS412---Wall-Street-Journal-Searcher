	<p class="article-leader">Whether or not to tax services is the question more states
will be asking now that Massachusetts has slapped a 5% tax on
many services.
   The service tax will add $223 million a year to the $2
billion raised from the existing 5% sales tax, which now
accounts for 22% of the state's total tax revenue.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While not the first of its kind in the nation,
Massachusetts's newly adopted service tax is the broadest of
any major industrial state. And it is the boldest step toward
taxing services since Florida repealed its tax three years
ago, after vociferous protests and threats by some businesses
to pull out of the state.</p>
<p>It is inevitable, tax experts say, that many states will
consider following Massachusetts' lead. "There seemed to be a
lull after Florida, and now it appears that states are taking
another look at broadening the sales-tax base," says Corina
Eckl, a tax specialist at the National Conference of State
Legislatures, a research group.</p>
<p>Last month, New Jersey decided to raise additional revenue
by taxing, among other things, a number of services including
telecommunications and janitorial services. And last year,
Connecticut extended its sales-tax base to 21 services, from
public relations to landscaping and window cleaning.</p>
<p>"I'm receiving more and more calls from legislators and
legislative staff assistants with inquiries about taxing
services," says Ronald Schreiner, secretary of the Department
of Revenue for South Dakota, which long has taxed services in
the state.</p>
<p>Fiscal deterioration in many states -- as in Massachusetts
-- and the fact that the nation's economy is becoming more
and more service-oriented are catalysts spurring legislatures
to move toward taxing services, experts say. "The question is
bound to pop up in legislatures every time somebody needs
money," says Hal Hovey, editor of State Budget and Tax News
in Alexandria, Va. "As states look for new tax bases,
services consumed by individuals will be up for inspection
before the more sensitive issue of corporate taxes."</p>
<p>From a fairness standpoint, taxing services makes sense,
many contend. "There's no reason why buying a color TV should
be taxed and having that color TV repaired should not be
subject to a sales tax," argues John Mikesell, professor of
public and environmental affairs at Indiana University and
co-author of a book titled "Sales Taxation."</p>
<p>But there are drawbacks. For starters, almost any new tax
is politically unpopular, a fact lost on few legislators.
Moreover, until service taxes become common in states, those
that don't have them will have an economic advantage over
those that do.</p>
<p>"You can tax your services, but you make them less
competitive," says James W. Wetzler, commissioner of taxation
and finance for New York state. "States like Massachusetts
and Connecticut are going to have to fall behind the field in
competitive ability." Stiff opposition to a broad service tax
prompted New York state to back down and instead levy a
watered-down tax on only cleaning and security services.</p>
<p>Not all services in states with service taxes risk losing
customers to out-of-state competitors, of course. Customers
aren't likely to cross state lines for an out-of-state
television repairman or studio photographer, for example,
just to avoid the tax.</p>
<p>And there are ways to try to limit the effect on other
service providers. Massachusetts, for instance, will impose a
"use fee" equal to the service tax on in-state businesses
that employ an out-of-state accounting firm.</p>
<p>No doubt, a tax on services could create a paper quagmire,
especially with scores of exemptions tacked onto bills. In
Massachusetts, for instance, separate electric meters may
have to be used to track the energy used by businesses
specifically for manufacturing (which won't be taxed) as
opposed to electricity used for lighting and air conditioning
(which will be). If collection difficulties permit many to
avoid paying the tax, it could be perceived as inequitable
and become even more controversial.</p>
<p>The state's Department of Revenue concedes that tax
enforcement won't be without snags. "Certainly there're going
to be glitches," a department spokeswoman says. "Things, at
first, aren't going to be crystal clear; there's some
educating to be done to clear up confusion."</p>
<p>The department is underestimating tax revenue from
services during the first year, partly in anticipation of
collection difficulties.</p>
<p>As a result, some states are expected to proceed
cautiously. This year, Kentucky toyed with the idea of a
service tax but backed off, afraid of possibly blunting state
business. California, still locked in a struggle to balance
its fiscal 1990 budget, isn't considering broadening a sales
tax.</p>
<p>The Massachusetts Legislature modified its tax bill with a
pastiche of exemptions to overcome some of the objections and
win political support. For example, it exempted services
provided by Massachusetts firms to out-of-state clients from
having to pay the tax, so that Massachusetts companies
wouldn't be at a competitive disadvantage.</p>
<p>To appease small businesses and individual taxpayers, the
Legislature decided to waive the tax on professional bills of
less than $20,000. It also exempted advertising costs and
medical services from the tax. And Boston-based Fidelity
Investments, the nation's largest mutual-fund company, used
its lobbying clout to get mutual funds exempted from the tax.</p>
<p>But the law will tax 594 types of services, including fees
charged by lawyers, accountants, architects and engineers, as
well as parachute training for pleasure, yoga instruction,
fortune-telling and piped-in music.</p>
<p>Opponents still haven't given up their campaign against
the new tax. While the state's Supreme Judicial Court gave an
advisory opinion that the tax doesn't violate the state's
constitution, several businesses and professional groups say
issues addressed in the ruling were narrow. They plan further
legal challenges to the tax, raising U.S. constititutional
issues.</p>
<p>"For instance, the opinion doesn't treat the Sixth
Amendment issue of an individual's constitutional right to
(legal) counsel," says Charles Swartwood, president of the
Massachusetts Bar Association, a reference to the effect the
service tax would have on legal fees. In bypassing that issue
in the advisory opinion, "the Supreme (Judicial) Court in
essence has invited us to come back to court," he says.</p>
<p>In addition, a Massachusetts citizens group is seeking to
dismantle the law this November by bringing before voters an
initiative that would in effect rescind the tax package.</p>
