	<p class="article-leader">It ain't necessarily so that the customer's always right.
The old adage has been given new meaning by a contest to find
the best written response to a consumer complaint.
   In bestowing its "Silver Pen" award, the Major Appliance
Consumer Action Panel, a nonprofit mediation board sponsored
by the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, considers
such qualities as sensitivity and responsiveness to a
consumer's situation and complaint. Clear and concise
language and proper writing style also are de rigueur.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>What the letter doesn't have to do is give the consumer
what he or she wants.</p>
<p>Indeed, say experts in the field of consumer relations,
it's not what you tell consumers that counts, but how you
tell it.</p>
<p>"You tell people to go to hell in such a way that they
look forward to the trip," John Goodman, president of
Technical Assistance Research Programs, quotes one of his
trainers as saying.</p>
<p>Complaining consumers who fail to receive a satisfactory
response from a company that participates voluntarily in the
program may write to the panel and ask it to review the
complaint. The panel also forwards letters it gets directly
to a company and gives it time to respond. The panel's
recommendations aren't binding.</p>
<p>Marian Stamos, who runs the well-regarded program, says
the reason the award doesn't require that consumers get what
they seek is simple: "Consumers may not be right in what they
want."</p>
<p>The panel's 1989 Silver Pen award went to Julie Cicero
Bezotte, customer-service manager at Emerson Electric Co.'s
InSink-Erator division, a garbage-disposal company and
dishwasher marketer.</p>
<p>Ms. Bezotte's letter responded to one by an engineer who
complained about his dishwasher. "He was listening to it,"
Ms. Bezotte says, and he thought the water in the unit might
not be clean.</p>
<p>The letter, which is exceedingly cordial, won't get any
prizes for liveliness. But then, nobody would expect a
detailed description of a dishwasher's timer sequence to set
the world on fire. Ms. Bezotte cautioned the consumer not to
"confuse the `wash' cycle and the `purge' cycle." And, she
wrote, "as long as all plumbing and drain connections are
correct, waste water cannot back up into the dishwasher."</p>
<p>The world will have to take it on faith that the letter
satisfied his complaint. Both the company and the panel
prefer to keep the identity of consumers confidential.</p>
