	<p class="article-leader">SEOUL, South Korea -- Is South Korea's economy going to
the dogs?
   A lot of people might think so when they see news footage
of riot police in combat gear battling strikers. Or when
Korean government economists and business associations
pronounce the country in a crisis. Newsweek says, "South
Korea's Economic Miracle Has Lost Its Glow," and the New York
Times echoes, "The South Korean `economic miracle' looks
increasingly fragile now."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Don't bet on it. It is becoming increasingly clear that
Korea's economy has turned around and, while not quite ready
to roar, will be purring contentedly.</p>
<p>For all their recent talk of a crisis, economists now
agree Korea's gross national product will probably grow 9%
this year -- one of the biggest increases in the fast-growing
Asian region. Domestic demand is strong. Exports will be
expanding by an annual rate of more than 10% by the end of
the year, averaging more than 5% growth for all of 1990.</p>
<p>With machinery backlogs up 50% over last year and
shipbuilding orders up 50% -- enough to keep Korea's
shipyards busy for three years even if they get no new orders
-- a continuation of double-digit export growth into next
year looks like a sure thing. "Growth was somewhat more
robust than expected," says Koo Boo Young, a presidential
economic adviser.</p>
<p>There are of course some potential trouble spots.
Inflation, clipping along at an annual rate of about 12%, is
one of them. And Korea's merchandise trade balance may go
slightly into the red for the first time since 1985, although
that isn't as bad as it seems: Imports grew quickly because
Korean companies were buying 40% more U.S.- and Japanese-made
machinery than they did in 1988 to automate factories and cut
production costs.</p>
<p>All in all, optimism is breaking through the clouds.
"Policy makers are gradually getting more optimistic --
although some uncertainties linger over the optimistic
opinion," says Chang Seung Woo, a top official of the
government's Economic Planning Board.</p>
<p>In fact, the biggest worry these days among the
technocrats who engineered Korea's economic "miracle" isn't
the health of the economy. They worry that the factors that
will keep Korea's economic machine whirring are no longer
ones controlled by their macroeconomic tinkering. Korea's
economy now is so complex and intertwined with world markets
that developments in Tokyo, New York or Frankfurt -- an
interest rate change or a product innovation -- can have more
impact than government decisions. "In the past the outside
world did not interfere as they do now," says Lee Hahn Koo,
president of Daewoo Research Institute.</p>
<p>Korea's recovery was spurred by an abrupt end to labor
union unrest and a favorable turn in the value of Korea's
currency, the won.</p>
<p>The Labor Ministry says that through the first week of
July when the strike season usually finishes, the country
suffered only 255 strikes, compared with 1,127 last year.
Moreover, the average length of the strikes declined to about
12.4 days from 19.2 last year. Pay increases averaged only
about 7% this year, compared with 17.8% last year.</p>
<p>The labor peace shows up on the bottom line. In the first
quarter last year, companies claimed they lost $643 million
in exports due to labor disputes. This year the loss claimed
is only $20 million. Wages are rising, but they no longer are
outstripping productivity gains. "This year things are going
very smoothly," says Park Sung Kyou, president of Daewoo
Telecom Co. "Businessmen have got their confidence back,
their ego back, and they are starting to invest and starting
to export."</p>
<p>While many Korean businessmen had blamed higher wages for
Korea's loss of overseas competitiveness, the real culprit
seems to have been the change in the currency rates.</p>
<p>In 1986, when the Japanese yen began rising sharply
against the dollar, Japan's products became more expensive
overseas. Korea, which linked its currency to the dollar,
thus gained an advantage in the U.S. market. But it quickly
lost this advantage when the won started rising against the
dollar. Things got even worse when the yen started to fall
against the dollar and the won fell more slowly. That meant
that the price difference between Japanese and Korean
products narrowed. In some product areas, Korean products
became more expensive than their Japanese rivals, with
disastrous consequences for Korean exports.</p>
<p>SKC Ltd., a Korean video and audio tape maker, even
discovered that tapes imported into Korea grabbed 15% of the
local market because the prices were almost the same, even
though imported tapes were hit with a 13% duty. "We are not
very competitive," says Park Jang Suk, manager of the
government's planning department.</p>
<p>There was little the economic planners could do. The Korea
Institute of Economics and Technology, a government-supported
think tank, estimated that when the won-yen rate is at about
435 won to 100 yen, Korea loses about $3.4 billion in
exports.</p>
<p>Recently the won fell to around 484 to 100 yen, exports
surged, and the economy began its recovery.</p>
