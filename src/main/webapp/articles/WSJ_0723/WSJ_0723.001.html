	<p class="article-leader">MADRID -- Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, Spain's largest bank,
intends to revitalize its industrial strategy and forge
alliances with other big European banks as part of a plan for
the 1990s.
   "We're going to continue taking stakes in industry because
it's our tradition and we like it," said Emilio Ybarra, its
chairman.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>And, though "cross-frontier banking mergers aren't yet
possible in practice," he added, "changes in European
Community legislation may make them so. When that happens,
previously forged alliances may facilitate" such mergers.</p>
<p>Six months after the denouement of a debilitating
leadership crisis, BBV is back on the offensive. In an
interview in his office at the bank's Madrid headquarters,
Mr. Ybarra, the 56-year-old banking veteran who emerged from
the crisis as BBV's new chairman, sketched his plans to
consolidate the bank in Spain and expand into neighboring
markets.</p>
<p>For the moment, he said, BBV hasn't completed any alliance
with another European bank, but "we're working on it." Target
areas are West Germany, France and Britain, where the
strength of local banks makes it hard for BBV to compete at
the retail level.</p>
<p>Such link-ups, Mr. Ybarra suggests, might involve the sale
of products in each other's markets and joint ventures in new
sectors and geographical areas. Further down the line, in a
context of European financial consolidation, they could serve
as a basis for even closer ties. A prior alliance, by testing
mutual compatibilities, can help to establish a basis for a
possible merger, he maintains.</p>
<p>"The important thing {in any merger} is that it should be
a good merger, with good partners," he says.</p>
<p>The scion of a wealthy northern Spanish industrial and
financial family, Mr. Ybarra took the helm of BBV in January
at a difficult moment. Forged out of the merger in 1988 of
rivals Banco de Bilbao and Banco de Vizcaya, BBV was still
reeling from a succession crisis sparked in December by the
death of one of its then two co-chairmen, former Vizcaya
Chairman Pedro Toledo.</p>
<p>In a row over whether BBV should stay with a dual
chairmanship or let BBV's other co-chairman, ex-Bilbao
Chairman Jose Angel Sanchez Asiain, take over alone, factions
representing the bank's Bilbao and Vizcaya components fought
for control. The warring damaged the bank's efficiency and
its international image, forcing the Bank of Spain to step
in. Mr. Sanchez Asiain was obliged to resign, and Mr. Ybarra,
another ex-Bilbao executive, was appointed to succeed him.</p>
<p>Until then, Mr. Ybarra, who through his family is one of
the bank's leading individual shareholders, had been
occupying an unobtrusive role as BBV's vice chairman. A law
graduate who began his career in mining, he joined Banco de
Bilbao in 1964, working his way up to the post of Bilbao's
managing director and vice chairman.</p>
<p>But when Bilbao merged with Vizcaya, the top post at BBV
seemed barred to him because of the stronger claim of Mr.
Toledo, the former Vizcaya chairman. Until his death, Mr.
Toledo had widely been expected to take over as sole chairman
of BBV in 1992.</p>
<p>When Mr. Toledo's death indirectly propelled Mr. Ybarra
into the chairmanship, many people inside and outside the
bank expected the appointment to be only an interim one.
Since then, however, this quiet-spoken patrician has
confounded such expectations. Aided by the tact of Mr.
Sanchez Asiain, who now heads BBV's new cultural foundation,
he has shown a talent for conciliation and leadership,
smoothing ruffled sensitivities and giving a new sense of
direction to the bank.</p>
<p>"He's a practical man who has known how to put his
extensive banking experience to use," an ex-Vizcaya colleague
says. "He was called upon to play a role as pacifier, and he
has played it well."</p>
<p>On the domestic front, his appointment coincided with a
damaging interest-rate war among Spanish banks, which at one
point appeared to threaten BBV with a serious loss of
deposits. Launching a counteroffensive, Mr. Ybarra this year
introduced high-yield accounts at BBV including a savings
account with a built-in lottery. Results were quickly
apparent. BBV's market share, after falling from 7.25% of
total Spanish bank and savings bank deposits in December to
7.12% in February, rose to 7.56% in May, the latest month for
which figures are available.</p>
<p>In financial terms, Mr. Ybarra concedes, BBV will suffer
like other Spanish banks this year from the effects of a
reduction in financial margins and a Bank of Spain squeeze on
lending. On the other hand, however, the technical
integration of the bank's two halves is 80% complete, he
says. After a period of high costs and staff duplication, BBV
is beginning to see the economies of scale that the merger of
Bilbao and Vizcaya promised.</p>
<p>Its work force has been reduced by more than 1% since the
start of this year to 29,500, and it's gradually closing
unneeded offices. Increases in costs so far this year have
been kept below the rate of inflation. In spite of the
deposit-rate war, the bank's financial margin has narrowed by
only 0.3 percentage point in the past 12 months,
substantially less than at other banks.</p>
<p>On the industrial front, meanwhile, BBV is pressing ahead
with the reorganization of a range of industrial and service
interests under new holding companies. It has already set up
umbrella firms to run its interests in the foods sector and
wholesale distribution. Similar companies are in the pipeline
for retailing, new technologies and leisure services and
travel.</p>
