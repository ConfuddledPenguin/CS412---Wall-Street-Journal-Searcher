	<p class="article-leader">The chemical units of Rhone-Poulenc S.A. and Eastman Kodak
Co. plan to study the feasibility of jointly producing
cellulose acetate, the French company said.
   If the project receives a green light, Rhone-Poulenc
Chimie and Eastman Chemical Co. will form a joint venture
requiring a total investment of about $200 million to $300
million, a Rhone-Poulenc spokesman said. The partners would
divide the costs equally.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The site of the venture will be determined in the course
of the feasibility study, he said.</p>
<p>Cellulose acetate is used in the production of cigarette
filters, textiles and plastics. The companies are targeting a
completion date around the end of 1993 for a factory that
would produce 60,000 tons of the chemical annually.</p>
<p>The spokesman said this would represent the first
cooperative effort between Paris-based Rhone-Poulenc and
Kodak of Rochester, N.Y.</p>
<p>A U.S. subsidiary of the French concern bought Kodak's
Beta Physics polyester film operation in January 1988.</p>
