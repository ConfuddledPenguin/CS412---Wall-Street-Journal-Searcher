	<p class="article-leader">The Resolution Trust Corp. said Sun Savings & Loan
Association, Parker, Colo., was closed by the federal
government on Friday, after the federal agency failed to sell
the thrift.
   The RTC, which was named receiver, said that it solicited
bids for Sun Savings but that it decided to pay off insured
despositors instead, because it didn't receive any
"acceptable bids."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sun Savings had about $240.7 million in deposits, with
"minimal" uninsured deposits, the RTC said. The thrift had
assets of $208.4 million and liabilities of $298.7 million.</p>
