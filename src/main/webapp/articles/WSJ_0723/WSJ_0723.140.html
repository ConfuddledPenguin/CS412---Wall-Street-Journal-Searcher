	<p class="article-leader">Wells Fargo & Co. continued to expand its operations in
Southern California, reaching a definitive agreement to
purchase Citizens Holdings, parent of El Camino Bank of
Anaheim and Citizens Bank of Costa Mesa.
   Terms of the deal weren't disclosed. The two banks have a
total of six branches in Orange County, one of the state's
wealthiest areas, but one where Wells Fargo has only a small
presence now.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>This month, the San Francisco banking and financial
services company agreed to acquire the California branches of
Great America Bank for $492 million in a move that gives it
the leading retail banking and thrift share of the lucrative
San Diego area.</p>
