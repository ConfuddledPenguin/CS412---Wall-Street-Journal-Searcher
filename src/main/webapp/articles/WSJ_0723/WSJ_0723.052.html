	<p class="article-leader">GRAND CAYMAN, Cayman Islands -- Chandler Insurance Co.
expects to report record net income of about $3 million for
the second quarter, compared with $2.6 million in the
year-earlier period, W. Brent LaGere, chairman and chief
executive officer, said.
   Per-share earnings fell to between 38 cents and 40 cents
from 50 cents a year earlier because of a stock offering in
March of 2.2 million shares. At the end of the most recent
quarter, Chandler had an average of 7.7 million shares
outstanding, compared with 5.3 million a year earlier, Mr.
LaGere said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the first half, Chandler, which primarily reinsures
auto and general liability risks for trucking companies,
expects to report earnings of about $5.7 million, compared
with $5.2 million a year earlier. Per-share earnings fell to
about 85 cents from 97 cents. Chandler had an average of 6.7
million shares outstanding at the end of June, compared with
5.3 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>Mr. LaGere, in an interview, attributed the improvement in
earnings to strong growth in the company's large-fleet
trucking program, which accounts for about 36% of premiums.
Chandler expects earned premiums in the segment to total
about $10.2 million for the quarter, compared with about $7.8
million in the year-earlier period.</p>
<p>Chandler is also seeing significant growth in its surety
bond program, Mr. LaGere said, particularly because the
Treasury Department in December authorized the company to
write bonds for contractors that perform U.S. government
work. In the second quarter, the surety bond program had
earned premiums of about $3.7 million, compared with about
$1.8 million in the first quarter and about $1.5 million in
the 1989 second quarter.</p>
<p>Mr. LaGere declined to project results for the remainder
of the year. But he characterized Chandler as being "somewhat
immune" from price competition because of the specialty
niches that the company occupies.</p>
