	<p class="article-leader">BATTLE CREEK, Mich. -- Kellogg Co., citing "substantially"
improved sales from international operations, said
second-quarter earnings rose 4.6%, reversing a trend of lower
earnings experienced in the past three quarters.
   The cereal maker said it earned $135.7 million, or $1.13 a
share, on sales of $1.26 billion. In the year-earlier
quarter, it earned $129.7 million, or $1.06 a share, on sales
of $1.23 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Earlier, the company's chairman, William E. LaMothe, said
the quarter would be one of "very heavy investment" in
marketing as well as product development. Therefore, the
results weren't expected to match last year's earnings.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange trading Friday, Kellogg shares
rose 87.5 cents to close at $69.50.</p>
<p>Kellogg said sales volumes of ready-to-eat cereal in its
international operations increased substantially in the
quarter. A spokesman for the company said "international is
becoming an increasing percentage of our business. Last year,
sales from outside the U.S. contributed 37% of the sales of
the organization and it is continuing to grow." The company
also said the results were helped by cost-containment
measures taken throughout the company.</p>
<p>Despite the improvement in those operations, Kellogg said
the performance of its U.S. ready-to-eat cereal business was
down because of "intense" competition and slowed growth.</p>
<p>In the first six months, earnings fell 19.8% to $232
million, or $1.92 a share, on sales of $2.47 billion.</p>
