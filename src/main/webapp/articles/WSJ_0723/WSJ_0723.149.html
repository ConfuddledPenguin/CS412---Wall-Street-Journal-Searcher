	<p class="article-leader">The Philadelphia Stock Exchange is close to a deal that
would give U.S. investors an easy way to bet on the direction
of the German stock market.
   Last month, the Philadelphia exchange signed a
surveillance agreement and within a few days will sign a
licensing agreement with the Frankfurt Stock Exchange to
trade warrants on a German stock index. The agreements will
give the Philadelphia exchange nonexclusive rights to trade
put and call warrants on the Deutscher Aktien-index, or DAX.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Joseph Rizzello, the Philadelphia exchange's senior vice
president, new products, said the exchange started looking at
the DAX as soon as it was apparent that the six put and two
call warrants based on the Nikkei index of 225 Tokyo stocks
that began trading earlier this year on the American Stock
Exchange were a success. "I think the Amex had a great idea
with the Nikkei warrants," Mr. Rizzello said. "After they
came out, I figured the next best place to go was Germany."
Other exchanges are likely to follow with their own German
stock-index warrants, exchange officials said.</p>
<p>The DAX index is a widely followed stock market indicator,
based on the performance of 30 blue-chip stocks traded on the
Frankfurt exchange. The index includes companies such as
Volkswagen, Siemens, Schering, Lufthansa, Henkel and
Bayerische Motoren Werke, or BMW.</p>
<p>A DAX call warrant entitles an investor to a payment if
the DAX rises above the exercise or "strike price" specified
in the warrant's prospectus. A put warrant pays off if the
DAX falls below the warrant's strike price. The actual amount
of the payment depends on the difference between the DAX and
the strike price. Typically, such warrants have a three-year
life.</p>
<p>Investors who purchased Nikkei put warrants in February,
just before the Japanese stock market crashed, more than
tripled their money, in some cases, in less than three
months. More recent purchasers haven't fared as well, as the
Nikkei index has traded in a narrow range.</p>
<p>Trading in the DAX warrants can't begin until the
Securities and Exchange Commission approves the surveillance
agreement signed by the two exchanges. The SEC is withholding
its approval, because, under German law, if there were an
investigation of wrongdoing, it wouldn't be possible to
compel a German brokerage house or bank to deliver the name
of a customer suspected of violating exchange or SEC rules.
Under U.S. and most other countries' laws, it is possible to
gain access to such information.</p>
<p>But Mr. Rizzello said that in the past, German
institutions have delivered the names of customers as
requested by investigating bodies. He added, "Of course, the
SEC has to be satisfied with the surveillance agreement
before we can proceed." Mr. Rizzello wouldn't speculate on
when the agreement could be approved.</p>
<p>Brandon Becker, associate director in the SEC's division
of market regulation, declined to comment specifically on the
agreement between the Philadelphia and the Frankfurt
exchanges. But he said, "In general, we review filings on
index warrants to insure that adequate surveillance
procedures are in place between the markets trading the
derivative product and its underlying index."</p>
<p>Stocks in the DAX are selected on the basis of market
capitalization and trading volume. The index itself is
capitalization-weighted, which means shares of companies that
have more common and preferred shares outstanding will have a
bigger weight in the index. The index is calculated
continuously during the Frankfurt Stock Exchange's market
hours. The Standard & Poor's 500 stock index also is
capitalization-weighted.</p>
<p>Mr. Rizzello said the Philadelphia exchange is a good
place for the DAX warrants to trade, because of its active
market in foreign currency options. "I think the American
public have become sophisticated investors," he said. "They
see what is taking place with unification between the two
Germanys and they want to be able to participate."</p>
<p>Mr. Rizzello said that while he expects some institutional
buying of the warrants, he believes the warrants will appeal
mostly to individual investors.</p>
