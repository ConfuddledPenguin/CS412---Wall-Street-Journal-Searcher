	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission
identified several of the defendants in its insider-trading
case in connection with GTE Corp.'s agreement to merge with
Contel Corp.
   The agency said it identified four West German residents,
all of whom traded through accounts at Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc. in New York from accounts maintained at Simonbank AG,
Dusseldorf. All four traded call options within two days of
the announcement of the deal, the SEC said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A call is an option to buy a security at a specific price,
usually above the current price and usually within a limited
period.</p>
<p>The agency identified the four as Ortwin Heider of
Hofheim, Hans-Jurgen Klisch of Meerbusch, Hannelore
Mirbach-Krahn of Meerbusch and Bodo Pawlik of Ratingen.</p>
<p>The SEC also charged a German mutual fund, Union
Investment, and two Swiss companies, Nalasag Corp. of Geneva
and Sigesse SA of Lausanne, with trading Contel stock and
options ahead of the announcement. The two companies bought
the securities through Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. and
Union Investment bought its shares through Dean Witter.</p>
<p>Officials of Nalasag and of Sigesse couldn't be reached
for comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Heider, one of the four West German defendants, said:
"I'm not an insider -- I heard a rumor, and the investigation
will clear that." He added that he knows one of the other
West German defendants, but wouldn't say whether it was one
of the other three named by the SEC. "Dealing on rumor is not
insider trading -- at least I hope not," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Klisch, another of the individual defendants, is a
Duesseldorf-based broker for Dean Witter. He says he is
cooperating with the SEC, but insists that he cannot speak
regarding the case in general. For himself, however, he says:
"To my knowledge, this was rumor and a recommendation by
Shearson Lehman -- that's why I bought." He said Shearson
gave a buy recommendation; in addition, there were very good
fundamental reasons to buy. Mr. Klisch says Union Investment,
is a Frankfurt-based group and one of his customers.</p>
<p>The other two West German defendants couldn't be reached
immediately for comment.</p>
<p>The SEC charges were brought last week, soon after Contel
agreed to merge with GTE for $6.2 billion. At the time, the
agency didn't identify any of the defendants but was granted
a temporary restraining order by a federal court barring the
defendants from selling their stock or options.</p>
<p>On Friday, the SEC also issued a laundry list of trades of
both stock and options that it says were insider trades on
material non-public information. It also dropped charges
against buyers of some call options through Advest Inc.,
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Smith Barney.</p>
<p>None of the banks or brokerage firms have been charged
with any wrongdoing in the case.</p>
