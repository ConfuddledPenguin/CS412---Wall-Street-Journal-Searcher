	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Baldwin Securities Corp. said its auditors
still can't figure out the value of its investment in the
limited partnership that investor Paul Bilzerian used to
acquire the former Singer Co.
   The company said the inability of its auditors, Seidman &
Seidman, to place a value on Baldwin's investment in
Bilzerian Limited Partnership I, delayed the report of its
1989 results until yesterday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Baldwin narrowed its losses in 1989 to $1.4 million, or 65
cents a share, from $2 million, or 84 cents a share, a year
earlier. Revenue fell 39% to $2.03 million from $3.35
million.</p>
<p>Baldwin attributed the lower loss to an $843,000 interest
payment on a federal tax refund and reduced borrowings, lower
interest expenses and general cost-cutting. Baldwin's
expenses fell about 17% to $4.3 million in 1989 from $5.2
million in 1988.</p>
<p>The auditors chose to disclaim an opinion on Baldwin's
1989 results as a result of the investment, which the company
carried on its books at $13 million cost. In addition,
Baldwin said it is studying how the federal Investment
Company Act of 1940 applies to its investment in Bilzerian
L.P. I. Baldwin in 1987 was deregistered by the Securities
and Exchange Commission as an investment company and became
an operating company.</p>
<p>Bilzerian L.P. I, of which Baldwin owns 12.75%, is the
100% owner of Bicoastal Corp., the former Singer Co. that
filed for Chapter 11 protection last fall.</p>
<p>Mr. Bilzerian currently is appealing a June 1989
conviction for securities fraud, conspiracy to commit tax
fraud and filing false disclosure statements with the SEC
involving stock transactions in 1985 and 1986. None of the
charges involved his takeover of Singer.</p>
<p>Baldwin paid $13 million for its January 1988 investment,
which Mr. Bilzerian applied toward his takeover of Singer.
Baldwin hoped to make a profit on its stake after Mr.
Bilzerian sold off several of Singer's divisions.</p>
<p>Once Bicoastal comes out of Chapter 11, "there will be one
more obstacle removed to figuring out the value of the
investment," said Henry Welt, Baldwin's counsel and
secretary.</p>
<p>The company didn't break out fourth-quarter results. Mr.
Welt said he expects the company to release the quarter
results within two weeks.</p>
