	<div class="article-body"><p>First, the good news: If you invest in a mutual fund that
tracks the U.S. stock market as a whole, you are likely to
outperform the vast majority of all stock mutual funds.</p>
<p>Now, the bad news: Although a lot of folks think they own
funds that track the whole market's performance, they don't.</p>
<p>So-called index funds are the hottest mutual-fund product
of 1990, with industry giants Dreyfus Corp., Fidelity
Investments and Vanguard Group slugging it out for market
share.</p>
<p>Unlike most stock funds, which are actively managed in an
effort to achieve superior returns, index funds don't try to
outguess market swings or hunt for bargains. They simply buy
and hold all or most of the stocks that make up a market
index. Dreyfus, Fidelity and Vanguard all now offer funds
that seek to track the performance of Standard & Poor's
500-stock index, the most popular benchmark among index fund
investors.</p>
<p>So far this year, Vanguard's top selling stock fund is its
$2.3 billion Index Trust -- 500 Portfolio, the oldest and
largest of the stock-index mutual funds. The fund buys the
500 stocks that make up the S&P-500 index, and thereby hopes
to closely track the index's performance. This passive
strategy served shareholders well in the 1980s, when it
generated 17% annual returns, better than 73% of all stock
funds.</p>
<p>But now fund analysts and industry executives are warning
that the S&P-500 stocks account for only part of the U.S.
stock market. And it is starting to look like an increasingly
pricey part.</p>
<p>"We've been concerned about that for some years," says
John Bogle, Vanguard Group's chairman. "There's certainly
been a bias {toward bigger stocks} in the market. The issue
is, will Standard & Poor's 500 funds be as dominant in the
'90s as they were in the '80s? We don't know the answer to
that."</p>
<p>Index funds get their edge partly from staying fully
invested in stocks at all times. That was a big plus during
the raging bull market of the 1980s. Index funds also are
cheap to run. Vanguard's 500 Portfolio has annual operating
costs of 0.2%, vs. 1.5% for the typical actively managed
stock fund.</p>
<p>Lured by Vanguard's success, in terms of both investment
performance and attracting investors' dollars, Dreyfus and
Fidelity are trying to muscle into the index-fund market.
Earlier this year, both companies launched funds that track
the S&P 500.</p>
<p>The trouble is, S&P-500 stocks no longer seem to be
representative of the entire U.S. stock market. While S&P-500
stocks posted sparkling returns during the 1980s, other U.S.
stocks trailed badly. How badly? Take a look at the Wilshire
4,500, which is the Wilshire 5,000 index of all U.S. stocks
minus the S&P-500 stocks. During the 1980s, the Wilshire
4,500 posted a cumulative total return of 300%, vs. more than
400% for the S&P 500 stocks.</p>
<p>As a result of this lopsided performance, by the end of
1989 the stocks in the S&P 500 accounted for 73% of the
market value of all U.S. stocks, up from 68% a decade
earlier. The benchmark for measuring the market value of all
U.S. stocks is the Wilshire 5,000, which doesn't restrict
itself to 5,000 stocks, but rather includes all U.S. stocks
traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock
Exchange and Nasdaq. Over the course of the 1980s, the number
of stocks in the Wilshire 5,000 ballooned from 3,785 to
5,870.</p>
<p>As critics of indexing are quick to point out, a big
reason for the strong stock-market performance of the S&P-500
companies -- and of S&P-500 index funds -- is indexing
itself. "When people are buying a stock because it's listed
in an index, that creates inefficiency," notes Donald
Phillips, editor of Morningstar's Mutual Fund Values, a
Chicago newsletter.</p>
<p>Does that mean that the success of indexing in the 1980s
was a fluke, a self-fulfilling prophesy caused by the huge
influx of indexing money into the S&P-500 stocks? Not at all.
Even a strategy of indexing the whole market would have paid
big dividends over the past decade. Vanguard Group estimates
that a Wilshire 5,000 index fund would have returned 16.4% a
year after expenses during the 1980s. That would have put it
ahead of 65% of all stock funds.</p>
<p>For those who want to index the whole market, the only
current choice is Vanguard. In 1987, the company launched a
fund that tracks the Wilshire 4,500, called the Extended
Market Portfolio. Combine this fund with Vanguard's 500
Portfolio, and you would get exposure to the entire U.S.
stock market. To own each index in the right proportion given
their relative market values, you would currently have to put
$26 in Vanguard's Extended Market Portfolio for every $74 you
put in the 500 Portfolio.</p>
<p>Later this year, IBM Credit Corp. plans to launch two
index funds. While they will be aimed at employees of
International Business Machines Corp., they also will be
available to the general public directly from IBM Credit.
Taken together, the two IBM funds will index the 3,000
largest U.S. companies. But IBM's funds currently propose
charging hefty annual expenses of 0.8% a year. By contrast,
the annual expenses charged by Dreyfus, Fidelity and Vanguard
are all under 0.3%.</p>
<p>How much of your money should you have in an index fund?
Morningstar's Mr. Phillips says that for many investors,
indexing half their stock portfolio would make a lot of
sense. "You forsake the chance of really doing well, but you
also won't do really badly," he says. "It's a strategy for
people who don't have a lot of time."</p>

<p>Vanguard dominates the index fund market, but Dreyfus and
Fidelity are hoping to change that. Here are some of the
no-load index funds with the lowest annual expenses.</p>
