	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- Canadian manufacturers recorded a 2.7% decline
in their order backlog in March from February, according to
Statistics Canada, a federal agency.
   March was the fifth consecutive month that manufacturers'
unfilled orders decreased. Much of the March decline was
attributed to a drop in the order backlogs of the
transportation equipment and machinery industries.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>New orders received by manufacturers in March declined
0.2% from February. New orders have declined in most months
since October. Manufacturers' shipments rose 1.1% in March
from February.</p>
