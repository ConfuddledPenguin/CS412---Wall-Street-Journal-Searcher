	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- U.S. auto sales stayed in the doldrums in May,
with sales of domestically built cars and light trucks
falling 3.3% in the last 10 days of the month.
   But auto makers dismissed the possibility that lagging
sales will prompt huge discounts at the end of the 1990 model
year in September. The reason: Each of the Big Three auto
makers have relatively modest supplies of unsold cars on
dealer and factory lots.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We believe that our lower inventory position will signal
to consumers that GM is not planning a costly model-year-end
sale," said James B. Fitzpatrick, vice president for General
Motors Corp.'s marketing and product planning staff.</p>
<p>Overall, Americans bought 459, 109 cars and light trucks
in the nine selling days of the May 21-30 period. In the
eight selling days a year earlier, sales totaled 422,134
vehicles. The percentage change is based on the daily sales
rate.</p>
<p>The late-May car sales translated into a seasonally
adjusted annual selling rate of 7.3 million cars, according
to a Commerce Department formula. That compares with a 7.8
million-car rate a year earlier, and it left May with a 6.7
million-car rate.</p>
<p>Although sales have been sluggish since February, the Big
Three auto makers have compensated by scaling back
production. Now, Chrysler Corp. has a 55-day supply of cars,
GM has a 59-day supply and Ford Motor Co. has a 68-day
supply. Auto makers usually prefer to keep supplies at about
a 65-day to-70-day level.</p>
<p>The relatively lean stocks of many models have emboldened
auto makers to start trimming sales incentives. David Healy,
an analyst with Barclays BZW investment banking group,
estimated that discounts offered on new cars decreased by an
average of $100 to $200 a car in May to about $900.</p>
<p>Dealers, however, are still wary of getting stuck with
unsold vehicles late in the model year, and are holding back
on ordering substantial numbers of new vehicles from the
factories. As a result, it remains unclear whether auto
makers, particularly the Big Three, can cut discounts back
much further this summer and fall.</p>
<p>That may be especially true in the face of continued
strong sales by Japanese auto makers, which increased their
share of the U.S. passenger car market to 30% in May compared
with 24% a year earlier. Japanese brands had a 28% share for
the first five months of this year.</p>
<p>Some Japanese auto makers have taken advantage of the
weaker yen by sweetening the incentives they're offering on
their cars and trucks in the U.S.</p>
<p>Toyota Motor Corp. made the strongest gains in May,
increasing its car and truck sales 31.3% and boosting its
U.S. car-market share to 9.8% from 6.1% in May 1989.</p>
<p>Honda Motor Co. also increased its share of the car market
-- to 9.5% from 8.5% -- even though its sales nudged up only
slightly.</p>
<p>Chrysler's combined car and truck sales fell 16.9% in May
-- the most of the Big Three. Chrysler's share of the U.S.
car market dropped to 9.7% from 10.9% a year earlier. Ford
also continued to lose ground as its combined car and truck
sales for May were off 14%. Ford's share of the passenger car
market slumped to 18.8% in May compared with 21.5% a year
earlier.</p>
<p>One weak spot for Ford is the restyled 1991 Ford Escort
model, which is getting off to a slower-than-expected start,
according to Ford dealers. Combined sales of the new
subcompact and the old model it's replacing fell 17.2% to
24,867 cars in May. Dealers said a big problem for the new
Escort is that it doesn't come with any discount, while many
rival Japanese and domestic models do. Ford is also offering
rebates on the discontinued Escort models.</p>
<p>On the plus side, Ford saw a big increase in sales of its
new Ford Explorer and the discontinued Bronco II compact
sport utility vehicles; production of the Bronco II has been
discontinued.</p>
<p>The Explorer and Bronco II recorded a 67.8% increase to
15,706 vehicles. They seem to have taken a bite out of
Chrysler's rival Jeep Cherokee and Wagoneer. Sales of those
models declined 20.1% in May.</p>
<p>GM, meanwhile, benefited from strong sales of its Geo line
of Japanese cars. In May, GM domestic car sales fell 13.6%,
but its imported cars -- primarily the Geo vehicles sold
through Chevrolet dealersjumped 10.8%. Still, GM's car-market
share slipped to 35.5% in May from 37% a year earlier.</p>
