	<p class="article-leader">Britain's Tomkins PLC agreed in principle to acquire
Philips Industries Inc. of Dayton, Ohio, for $18.50 a share,
or $550 million.
   The acquisition accord ends months of debate on the
Philips board over the company's course, following the
collapse earlier this year of a leveraged buy-out by Merrill
Lynch Capital Partners Inc.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"There was a healthy discussion by the board whether to
stay independent, do an LBO or sell to an industrial
company," Gregory Hutchings, Tomkins's chief executive
officer, said in London. In Dayton, Jesse Philips, the
company's 75-year-old founder and retired chairman, said the
board voted unanimously to accept the Tomkins offer because
it represented the "best value" for shareholders.</p>
<p>Last September, Merrill Lynch offered $25.50 a share for
Philips, a maker of windows, bathtubs, air-moving equipment
and other products, but was unable to line up financing for
the buy-out, even after Philips agreed to reduce the price to
$24 a share. Further discussions failed to produce an
alternative transaction. Talks were initiated with Tomkins
soon after the Merrill Lynch buy-out collapsed last January,
according to individuals involved in the negotiations.</p>
<p>The proposed price for Philips stock, though significantly
lower than the initial $25.50-a-share buy-out proposal, is a
premium of 32% above Monday's closing price of $14 a share in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Yesterday,
Philips stock surged $3.25 to close at $17.25 on volume of
2,483,800 shares.</p>
<p>For London-based Tomkins, which already makes lawnmowers,
bicycles and handguns in the U.S. as well as other metal
products in Britain, the acquisition would be the biggest yet
in a program to expand in the U.S. Tomkins was attracted to
Philips because it operates basic businesses involving
relatively low-risk technology, said Richard G.G. Carr,
president of Tomkins Corp., the U.S. subsidiary of Tomkins
PLC.</p>
<p>In 1987, Tomkins bought Smith & Wesson Corp., the gun
maker, for $112.5 million. The following year it bought
Murray Ohio Manufacturing Corp., a maker of lawnmowers and
bicycles, for $224 million.</p>
<p>Acquisition of Philips would give Tomkins 66% of its
earnings from U.S. sources, according to Mr. Hutchings, up
from 45% currently. "Philips would be very similar to our
other U.S. acquisitions -- a company with low-risk, technical
products and good cash flow," he said.</p>
<p>Tim Harris, an analyst with Nomura Research Institute in
London, predicted that Philips would add significantly to
Tomkins's already positive future earnings outlook.</p>
<p>Tomkins stock, though, slipped 14 pence (23.5 cents) to
288 pence in late trading in London, reflecting concern over
the 58% dilution in the company's shares that would result
from the #320 million ($537.6 million) rights offering to
finance the acquisition. Tomkins conditioned its buy-out
offer on a successful underwriting of the rights offering.</p>
<p>If a definitive agreement hasn't been executed by the
close of business June 20, the agreement in principle will
lapse, the companies said. And Philips is permitted to
discuss a merger with any other party that indicates an
interest prior to completion of the Tomkins transaction.</p>
<p>Philips was very successful until recently, acquiring
companies in related industries and showing consistent profit
gains by improving operations of the new businesses. However,
the company reported a net loss of $14.6 million, or 51 cents
a share, for the fiscal year ended March 31 because of
after-tax charges totaling $51.3 million related to planned
disposition of three units and costs of the failed Merrill
Lynch buy-out. Sales were $927.5 million.</p>
