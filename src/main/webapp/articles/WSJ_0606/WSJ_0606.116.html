	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney reported
a "small degree of progress" on the third day of negotiations
on Canada's constitutional impasse.
   Mr. Mulroney declined to disclose details of the
negotiations, which involve himself and 10 provincial
government leaders. But government officials said that much
of yesterday's negotiations involved differences over a
proposed constitutional amendment that would set new rules
for changing the federal Senate.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The proposed amendment is part of the constitutional
accord that was negotiated three years ago at Meech Lake,
Quebec. The accord, as drafted, is opposed by two provinces,
Newfoundland and Manitoba.</p>
<p>The New Brunswick government dropped its opposition to the
accord Monday after receiving assurances from other provinces
that its constitutional concerns would be satisfactorily
addressed.</p>
<p>Mr. Mulroney welcomed New Brunswick's move as a "very
welcome development." But at the start of yesterday's
negotiations several provincial premiers said they were
pessimistic about prospects for settlement of the impasse.
"Today my greatest fear is for Canada," said Alberta Premier
Don Getty. Prince Edward Island Premier Joseph Ghiz said
"We're at an impasse and I don't see a way out of it."</p>
<p>Quebec Justice Minister Gil Remillard told reporters that
Quebec won't accept any changes to a Meech Lake proposal that
would recognize Quebec as a "distinct society" within Canada.
Such a designation would be used by the courts in
interpreting the constitution, but wouldn't give Quebec any
new law-making powers, federal officials said.</p>
<p>Newfoundland and Manitoba have strong concerns about
giving Quebec special status in the constitution. They also
object to a proposed amendment that would give all provinces
a veto over reform of the federal Senate. Smaller provinces
have been seeking to gain greater influence over federal
government policies through a reformed Senate. Mr. Ghiz said
he disagreed with some of the provinces who consider that
"Senate reform is the key to the economic salvation of the
country." Ontario and Quebec currently have the greatest
representation in the Senate, whose members are appointed by
the prime minister.</p>
<p>If the proposed Meech Lake accord is to take effect, it
needs to be ratified by all provincial legislatures by June
23, a legal deadline. If the accord isn't approved, many in
Quebec have said they will view the failure as a rebuff to
Quebec and press for the province's separation from the rest
of Canada.</p>
<p>The Canadian Business Council on National Issues, which
represents the chief executives of some of Canada's largest
companies, said resolution of the constitutional impasse "has
now become critical" for the country.</p>
<p>"The political costs of failure, so far, have been heavy,"
the council said. "The economic costs to all Canadians are
already apparent -- and rising with alarming speed." Some
businessmen have said some investments in Canada are being
postponed because of the uncertainty.</p>
