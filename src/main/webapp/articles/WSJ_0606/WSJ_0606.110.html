	<p class="article-leader">Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. of Japan said its
consolidated pretax earnings for the year ended March 31
surged 52% to 146.49 billion yen ($962.5 million) from 96.27
billion yen a year earlier.
   Net income rose 8.9% to 67.51 billion yen, or 20.19 yen a
share, from 62.01 billion yen, or 18.68 yen a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales increased 20% to 2.278 trillion yen from 1.89
trillion yen.</p>
<p>Despite a 9.83 billion-yen gain from the sales of
corporate assets and a 14% drop in taxes to 50.41 billion
yen, the pace of profit growth slowed sharply from the pretax
level, as the company posted extraordinary losses of 51.24
billion yen, mostly representing a setback stemming from the
currency conversion of the value of warrant bonds, as a
result of sharp foreign exchange fluctuations, officials
said. The fiscal 1989 results didn't have any such losses.
Non-operating profit, including interest and dividend
receipts, climbed 30% to 63.752 billion yen. Sales of power
systems rose 37% to 646.25 billion yen; this line is
Mitsubishi's largest, accounting for 28% of total sales.</p>
