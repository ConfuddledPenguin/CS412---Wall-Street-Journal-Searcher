	<p class="article-leader">Boots Co. and W.H. Smith Group PLC announced a joint
venture in Britain's do-it-yourself market that will create a
company to own and manage both British retailers'
home-improvement stores.
   Boots and W.H. Smith will each own 50% of the venture,
which will have net assets of #104 million ($174.3 million)
and trade under the name of W.H. Smith's Do It All chain. By
combining the Do It All stores and Boots's Payless chain, the
venture will have 230 outlets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Payless, acquired by Boots in August as part of a #900
million hostile bid for Ward White Group PLC, a diversified
stores and manufacturing group, had pretax profit of #8.7
million on sales of #273 million in the 14 months ended March
31. Do It All had pretax profit of #7.7 million on sales of
#238 million in the year ended June 3, 1989.</p>
<p>"This is a major realignment in the {do-it-yourself}
market," said Malcolm Field, group managing director of W.H.
Smith and chairman of the joint-venture company. He said the
companies "believe that this market has considerable scope
for profitable growth."</p>
