	<p class="article-leader">RPM Inc. said it will redeem on July 6 all $30 million
outstanding of its 5 3/4% convertible subordinated
debentures, due 2001. The Medina, Ohio, company, which makes
products used in waterproofing, corrosion control and general
maintenance, said it assumes that all of the debentures will
be converted into common stock. As of March 31, RPM said, it
had about 22.5 million common shares outstanding; conversion
of all the bonds would increase that total to about 24.2
million.</p>
