	<p class="article-leader">BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- In a thrift industry version of a
celebrity roast, Columbia Savings & Loan Association's new
chief executive officer blasted his predecessors at
yesterday's annual meeting, as former chief executive Thomas
Spiegel and his father, Chairman Abraham Spiegel, watched.
   But shareholders of this insolvent thrift weren't
laughing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"All of us are victims," said shareholder Charlotte
Levine, who bought Columbia stock on April Fool's Day 1987 at
the urging of her Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. stockbroker.
"This company was used as a personal piggy bank" for the
Spiegel family, which owns about two-thirds of Columbia, she
said.</p>
<p>"The association was placed in harm's way by direct senior
management actions," said Edward G. Harshfield, a longtime
financial services industry executive who was named president
and chief executive of Columbia in March.</p>
<p>Mr. Harshfield was particularly gloomy about the thrift's
ability to avoid seizure by federal regulators, saying that
"remedial medicine could be too late, since the patient was
already comatose -- insolvent -- when the doctor arrived."</p>
<p>Columbia has been scrambling to sell off its deteriorating
junk bond portfolio and certain preferred stock. Mr.
Harshfield said the portfolio has declined in value by
roughly $1 billion since the thrift purchased the bonds. The
portfolio had a value of about $2.9 billion as of March 31.</p>
<p>"The reality of the matter is what price we get for the
bonds, to see what solution is left" for the S&L, Mr.
Harshfield said, noting that the company has had "progress on
that front." The executive has said he believes the company
can get book value, "if not better," for the bonds. However,
thrift experts have said that even a sale at book value
wouldn't put a dent in Columbia's insolvency, and, therefore,
they expect regulators to take over the thrift.</p>
<p>"We are capable of being taken over by federal regulators
at any moment, as it now stands," Mr. Harshfield acknowledged
in response to a shareholder's question.</p>
<p>Although federal legislation changing the way a thrift's
assets are valued contributed to Columbia's insolvency, "only
3% of the loss was the cause of the government's action," Mr.
Harshfield said. Columbia had a $591.1 million loss in 1989
and a $293.3 million loss in the first quarter.</p>
<p>After the meeting, Thomas Spiegel bristled at Mr.
Harshfield's suggestions of mismanagement, saying, "You can't
just sit there and point in time and say that 97% of the
losses are attributable to this. . . . Ed's been here for
three months, and he has his perspective. I have mine, being
here 13 years."</p>
<p>The issue of alleged mismanagement was foremost on most
shareholders' minds yesterday, particularly in light of a
continuing probe by the Office of Thrift Supervision into
"certain expenses and activities of former association
officers."</p>
<p>Mr. Spiegel confirmed the OTS investigation but declined
to discuss specifics.</p>
