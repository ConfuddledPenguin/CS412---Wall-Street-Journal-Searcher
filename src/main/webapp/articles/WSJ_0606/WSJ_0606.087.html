	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Corporate and municipal treasurers went on a
borrowing binge yesterday as they issued more than $2.7
billion of new notes and bonds.
   The flood of new supply is a sign that issuers find
current interest rates -- which have been falling for more
than a month -- now at very attractive levels. At the same
time, bullish bond market sentiment greatly increases the
success of new offerings. Traders said that issuers are
rushing to tap the debt market for fear that these favorable
conditions could change.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Investors, meanwhile, are snapping up the new notes and
bonds in an effort to lock in current rates before they fall
any further.</p>
<p>The bulk of yesterday's new supply consisted of tax-exempt
municipal bonds, including an $875 million offering by
Washington Public Power Supply System. The nuclear power
agency, which is irreverently known as `Whoops,' is best
remembered as the issuer behind the biggest default in
municipal-bond history. In 1983, WPPSS defaulted on $2.25
billion of Project 4 and 5 bonds.</p>
<p>But despite its infamous past, demand was so strong
yesterday for the WPPSS bonds that underwriters led by First
Boston Corp. restructured the offering by increasing the size
from the originally planned $600 million and reducing yields.
After the restructuring, the bonds, which were refunding
revenue bonds for Project Nos. 1, 2 and 3, were priced to
yield from 6.30% for one-year notes to 7.78% for 27-year
bonds.</p>
<p>Brad Higgins, managing director of public finance at First
Boston, said the strong demand partly reflected the recent
credit rating upgrade on WPPSS bonds. Last week, both Moody's
Investors Corp. and Standard & Poor's Corp. boosted ratings
on some WPPSS debt to double-A from single-A.</p>
<p>Junk Bonds</p>
<p>Junk bond prices continued to rise yesterday,
outperforming the broader bond market.</p>
<p>Most junk bonds, which are speculative-grade corporate
bonds with low credit ratings or no credit ratings at all,
climbed 1/8 point to 1/4 point.</p>
<p>The major market movers yesterday were again the bonds of
casinos operated by Donald Trump and those issued by retailer
R.H. Macy & Co.</p>
<p>Junk bonds of Trump Taj Mahal Funding and Trump Castle
Funding continued to slip on news that real estate developer
Donald Trump is facing an acute cash shortage.</p>
<p>Trump Taj Mahal's 14% bonds, due in 1998, slid 2 7/8
points to 54 1/8 yesterday after shedding eight points
Monday. Meanwhile, Trump Castle Funding's 13.75% bonds,
maturing in 1997, declined 2 1/2 points to end at 58 1/2.
These bonds also fell eight points on Monday.</p>
<p>The recently battered junk bonds of R.H. Macy jumped on
news that the company is "actively examining" opportunities
to refinance or reduce its debt.</p>
<p>Macy's 14.5% senior subordinated debentures, due in 1998,
gained 2 1/2 points to close at 67 while Macy's 14.5%
subordinated debentures, maturing in 2001, advanced three
points to 56 1/2.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>Prices of Treasury bonds fell yesterday after a day of
seesaw trading.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year bond ended more than 1/4 point
lower, or $2.50 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The
issue's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its
price, rose to 8.45% from 8.41%. The benchmark bond was
quoted late yesterday at a price of 103 5/32 compared with
103 15/32 Monday.</p>
<p>The latest 10-year notes ended at 102 21/32 to yield 8.45%
compared with 102 26/32 to yield 8.43%. Short-term rates were
little changed.</p>
<p>In early trading, prices of bonds moved higher on
expectations that oil prices would plummet following
overnight news wire reports that Saudi Arabia will cut some
of its crude oil prices to customers in July.</p>
<p>Even though crude oil futures slipped substantially at the
New York Mercantile Exchange, "oil didn't fall as much as
hoped for and the bond market subsequently lost its
momentum," said James R. Capra, a senior vice president at
Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc.</p>
<p>Municipal Bonds</p>
<p>Washington Public Power Supply's $875 million bond
offering was clearly the highlight of the market.</p>
<p>However, in addition to WPPSS, several other
municipalities tapped the market, including Hawaii, which
issued $100 million in general obligation bonds and Maricopa
County, Ariz., which issued $202 million in bonds.</p>
<p>Despite the heavy supply, municipal bonds held up pretty
well.</p>
<p>The New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% bonds due in
2018 finished unchanged at 98 5/8 to yield 7.28%.</p>
<p>Mortgage-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Prices of mortgage-backed securities ended lower, with
prices retreating after posting gains early in the day.</p>
<p>Government National Mortgage Association 9.5% securities
for June delivery were down 1/8 on the day at 99 7/32, with
the bellwether issues having posted a 1/8 point gain shortly
after the opening.</p>
<p>The spread between the Ginnie Mae 9.5% securities and the
10-year Treasury was at 129 basis points, unchanged from late
Monday.</p>
<p>Ginnie Mae 9% securities were down 6/32 at 96 27/32, and
the 10% securities, at 101 20/32, were down 4/32.</p>
<p>In other mortgage-backed markets, Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp. 9.5% securities were down 5/32 at 98 18/32, as
were the 10% securities, at 100 15/32. Federal National
Mortgage Association 9.5% securities were down 5/32 at 99
2/32, as were the 10% securities, at 101.</p>
<p>Corporate Bonds</p>
<p>It was busy for the investment-grade new-issue market as
more than $1.1 billion of debt was offered.</p>
<p>The highlight of the session was a two-part debt offering
by two units of American Electric Power Co. The units, AEP
Generating Co. and Indiana Michigan Power Co., each sold
$218.3 million of bonds.</p>
<p>The bonds, which mature in 2022, were priced at par to
yield 9.82%. Among other new offerings: Morton International
Inc. issued $200 million of "credit-sensitive" debentures
priced to yield 9.335% and Boise Cascade Corp. issued $125
million of 12-year notes priced to yield 9.85%.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>Most foreign bond markets were relatively quiet yesterday,
apparently because investors had little economic news on
which to trade.</p>
<p>In recent sessions, some foreign government bonds have
taken their cues from the U.S. bond market.</p>
<p>Among them are Japanese bonds, which rallied Monday but
lost ground yesterday.</p>
<p>Japan's benchmark 10-year issue ended at a price of 88.19,
down 0.14 point, to yield 6.93%. (Bond yields quoted in this
column are calculated in local terms, but would show
different results if calculated by the semiannual compound
measure that is used in the U.S.)</p>
