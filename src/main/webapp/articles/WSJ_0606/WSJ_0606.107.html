	<p class="article-leader">The historic agreement between Seoul and Moscow to end 45
years of estrangement represents a personal coup for South
Korean President Roh Tae Woo and perhaps a significant step
in his efforts to break the long impasse with communist North
Korea.
   But the San Francisco meeting Monday between Mr. Roh and
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, at which they determined
to work toward normal diplomatic ties, isn't expected to
produce sharp changes in South Korea's nascent business
relationship with the U.S.S.R.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The two presidents didn't set a timetable to normalize
relations, but to many observers their unprecedented talks
represent glasnost's biggest impact yet on Asia. "The Cold
War ice on the Korean peninsula has now begun to crack," Mr.
Roh said at a news conference in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Indeed, Mr. Roh's comments about eventual diplomatic ties
were far more forceful than those of Mr. Gorbachev. The
Soviet leader, who didn't appear at the news conference, made
only the general remark that Moscow "must improve relations
with every one" of the Pacific Rim nations. "We can't do it
selectively."</p>
<p>The Soviet Union and South Korea have never had diplomatic
ties. After World War II, Moscow played a role in dividing
the Korean peninsula into two nations, and it and China since
1949 have been North Korea's most important allies in its
confrontation with the South. Both communist nations
supported the North during the Korean War of the early 1950s,
China with troops, while the U.S. and the United Nations
aided the South. There are still more than 40,000 U.S. troops
stationed in South Korea. But as tensions have eased in
recent years among Washington, Moscow and Beijing, hostility
is undiminished between Seoul and Pyongyang.</p>
<p>Analysts in South Korea say formal diplomatic relations
between Moscow and Seoul could come as soon as September;
alternatively, they predict April, when Mr. Gorbachev is
expected to visit Japan and talk of a new Soviet-Asian
relationship.</p>
<p>Yet as the two leaders sat in San Francisco discussing
diplomatic moves and possible economic assistance from South
Korea, business executives in Seoul were trying to collect
$30 million in overdue trade bills from Moscow. That is one
of many barriers to improved economic and business relations
that the leaders' get-together won't easily surmount, say
executives, government officials and diplomats in the South
Korean capital.</p>
<p>"The meeting will have no dramatic effect on business
relations," says Anatoliy Sirotuk, consular official at the
Soviet Chamber of Commerce and Industry office in Seoul.
"Because business relations are based on business potential,
not politics. And economic conditions in my country are still
not very attractive to Korean businessmen."</p>
<p>The two nations have begun limited trade and business
contacts during the past few years; Moscow is desperate for
such links to help its crumbling economy. But South Korean
officials and executives agree that the meeting won't do much
to remove longstanding obstacles to increased trade and
investment. These observers cite Moscow's shortage of hard
currency to pay for imports, the nonconvertibility of the
ruble, the lack of investment guarantees and double-taxation
protection for Korean investors in the Soviet Union, and the
Soviets' undeveloped sense of business and economic
principles.</p>
<p>Lee Ki Joo, assistant foreign minister for economic
affairs, says "the general direction is moving positively,
and of course, I'm sure that a sort of favorable environment
will be created as a result of the summit meeting." But, he
added, "on details, such as double-taxation avoidance and
investment guarantees, even if we agree on starting
consultations immediately, it will take some time to
negotiate and conclude agreements. So I don't know that the
attitude of Korean business people will change so suddenly."</p>
<p>A hint of optimism comes from Lee Chang Jae, director of
the Soviet Union and East Europe Department for the
International Private Economic Council of Korea. "I don't
think there will be any immediate change in the concrete
economic relations," Mr. Lee said. "But psychologically, the
meeting is very important. With possible diplomatic relations
in the near future, I think a lot of Korean businessmen would
be willing to take a closer look at the Soviet Union."</p>
<p>Mr. Lee, whose agency is funded by Korea's biggest
companies and business organizations, said he expects many of
the obstacles related to the "basic framework of economic
cooperation" to be solved in the near future. That would
include, he said, diplomatic relations, tax and investment
treaties, and basic business needs such as direct telephone
links.</p>
<p>What can't be easily solved, he says, is the inability of
the Soviet Union to provide offices for Korean companies, or
for Soviet managers to deal with their economy. "That may be
the most important thing," says Mr. Lee, "and it will not
change with a meeting of some government leaders. It will
take a long time."</p>
<p>The San Francisco meeting is a substantial personal coup
for Mr. Roh, who has actively sought ties with East bloc
countries since his election as president in 1988. Frustrated
in his effort to hold unification talks with North Korea, Mr.
Roh pursued relations with Pyongyang's socialist allies as a
way to pressure the hard-line North into ending its
belligerence.</p>
<p>Mr. Roh said at the news conference that he asked Mr.
Gorbachev to "bear upon North Korea" to reduce its offensive
military posture on the peninsula. A South Korean aide said
Mr. Gorbachev had no specific response.</p>
<p>South Korea has normalized relations with most Eastern
European nations, including Poland, Hungary and
Czechoslovakia. The South Korean news media is speculating
that Mr. Roh will meet with Chinese leaders, in what would be
another important step in pressuring the North. South Korean
officials say that once the Soviets establish relations with
the South, it will be easier for China to follow. But China
doesn't want to move first.</p>
<p>There wasn't any immediate response to the Roh-Gorbachev
meeting from Pyongyang, which last week sharply criticized
the Soviets for agreeing to it.</p>
