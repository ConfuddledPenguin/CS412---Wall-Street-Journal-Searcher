	<p class="article-leader">KALAMAZOO, Mich. -- When the two archrival hospitals here
found out that both planned to launch helicopter ambulance
services, they flew into action. Borgess Medical Center
quickly found a copter, called photographers and was first to
get pictures in the local paper.
   But Bronson Methodist Hospital struck back, getting its
chopper into the air first and proudly proclaiming a nurse
aboard every flight.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Borgess retaliated three months later, boasting a doctor
on every trip. Within a year, each hospital had upgraded to
twin-engine choppers -- making the announcement the same
week. "There are only 90 helicopter ambulances in the whole
country," an exasperated executive of Upjohn Co., the city's
largest employer, said at the time, "and two of them are
here."</p>
<p>Not to mention two heart programs, two maternity wards,
two state-of-the-art emergency rooms, and two radiology
services. There were even two billboard campaigns. Robert
Fabi, a respected neurologist who has practiced here for more
than 20 years, describes the situation in verse: "Given the
history of Kalamazoo, if there is one, there will be two."</p>
<p>In most businesses, competition cuts prices. But hospital
bills in Kalamazoo, a metropolitan area of 200,000 between
Detroit and Chicago, are the second highest in Michigan and
among the highest in the nation. In general, hospital costs
in two-hospital towns like Kalamazoo are 30% higher than in
one-hospital communities, according to a survey by Booz-Allen
& Hamilton, Chicago consultants. "Kalamazoo is a microcosm of
the national environment," says Gary Alquist, a Booz-Allen
vice president and health-care specialist.</p>
<p>Charges per admission in 1988 averaged $6,112, 55% higher
than in nearby Grand Rapids and 34% above the national
average for metropolitan areas. Health costs at James River
Corp.'s Kalamazoo paper packaging operations rank in the top
three of the company's 15 similar units nationwide. When it
comes to further expansion, health costs put the area "at a
competitive disadvantage versus some of the other communities
we do business in," says Norman Ryan, a James River
executive.</p>
<p>The costs are a threat to both corporate profits and the
region's economic growth. Total medical costs here rose
nearly 15% last year at Upjohn, a pharmaceutical concern, and
20% at both Stryker Corp., a medical equipment company, and
FabriKal, a plastic products maker. First of America Corp., a
bank holding company, budgeted a 45% increase in costs this
year from 1989. "We have good medical care," says Theodore
Cooper, chairman, president and chief executive of Upjohn.
"We need it to be priced right."</p>
<p>As a result, Upjohn and other major businesses here have
tried hard to get the hospitals to cooperate. But nearly all
the efforts have failed. Last fall, the most ambitious -- a
two-year effort to merge the hospitals, one Catholic and one
Methodist -- collapsed over the issue of abortion.</p>
<p>Bronson and Borgess haven't gotten along since the turn of
the century, when a group of doctors left Borgess, which had
been founded by the Sisters of St. Joseph, to start their own
hospital. Each hospital, of course, has its own version of
that.</p>
<p>Borgess says the doctors were kicked out in a
philosophical tiff with a nun about, among other things,
religious influence over medical care. Bronson says the
physicians left after the nuns refused to shorten their
habits, which the doctors believed swept up germ-laden dust
as they swished along the floor.</p>
<p>Over the next several decades, the hospitals divided up
patients along religious and ethnic lines. "If your name was
Kelly, you went to Borgess," says Dan Ryan, retired editor of
the Kalamazoo Gazette, himself a Borgess baby.</p>
<p>In the 1950s, Bronson was the first to add a wing and
lease space to physicians, drawing first blood in the war for
supremacy. "You began having guys who were Bronson doctors
and Borgess doctors," says Mr. Ryan.</p>
<p>In the 1960s and 1970s, Borgess was particularly
successful at recruiting physicians highly trained in such
emerging areas as heart surgery and neurology. With the help
of an infusion of Medicare and other federal health funds,
both institutions established centers for a variety of
medical specialties.</p>
<p>Bronson has a burn unit, a neonatal intensive care ward
and strong pediatric and women's services. Borgess stresses
cardiology and neurosurgery and does kidney transplants.</p>
<p>Bronson is a sprawling 442-bed facility crammed into a
downtown city block. Borgess is a 458-bed hospital on 40
acres just two miles away. Both reported revenues of about
$140 million in 1988; both offer comprehensive services for
the treatment of critically ill patients.</p>
<p>Between 1970 and 1980, the number of physicians in
Kalamazoo doubled, intensifying the use of medical resources
-- and competition. Doctors, with power to refer and admit
patients, are catalysts in hospital battles. When Bronson
refused to purchase expensive surgical tables for some
orthopedic surgeons a few years ago, "they picked up their
scalpels and went across town," says Russell Kneen, former
chief executive at Bronson.</p>
<p>Regulation plays a crucial role as well. In the early
1980s, the U.S. instituted a program to control Medicare and
Medicaid costs by reducing hospital admissions and shortening
stays. Meantime, Michigan was one of many states that enacted
so-called certificate-of-need laws that require hospitals to
prove the need for expensive new technology and services.</p>
<p>The result: Between 1984 and 1988, the Kalamazoo
in-patient market shrank by 10%. But certificate-of-need
rules meant that being second with new technology necessary
to compete for the dwindling supply of patients could mean
not getting the technology at all. Competition, already
fierce, turned nasty.</p>
<p>One early battle was over a $2 million magnetic resonance
imaging machine, the state of the art in diagnostic
technology. At first, the hospitals planned to acquire one
jointly. But when a group of doctors allied with Borgess (and
unaffected by certificate-of-need requirements) bought their
own MRI, Borgess acquired a half interest in the doctors'
machine instead.</p>
<p>Despite agreements to assure Bronson doctors access to the
MRI, "it's turned out that we've been at a disadvantage,"
says Patric E. Ludwig, Bronson's chief executive officer. Now
Bronson intends to acquire its own MRI, a mobile version that
can be hauled from hospital to hospital. But the Borgess
physicians recently won approval for a mobile unit of their
own.</p>
<p>Bronson added open-heart surgery to its fledgling
cardiology service in 1987. That nettled Borgess, which has
done 7,000 open-heart operations.</p>
<p>State health officials ordered Bronson to shut down the
service, on the ground that it lacked a permit. Bronson says
Borgess provoked the action, something Borgess denies. In any
event, Bronson says the order forced one patient, on the eve
of his scheduled surgery, to be transferred -- to Borgess --
for the operation.</p>
<p>Then the state decided it lacked authority to stop Bronson
from doing open-heart surgery and permitted the procedures to
resume. But Borgess challenged that decision with a pending
lawsuit.</p>
<p>"You have a hard time convincing me that you need two
heart programs in this town," says R. Timothy Stack,
president of Borgess.</p>
<p>"They wanted to maintain a monopoly on that service,"
replies Mr. Ludwig.</p>
<p>Finally, local businesses just couldn't take it anymore --
and not only because of increased costs resulting from
duplicated services. Because reimbursements from Medicaid and
Medicare don't keep pace with costs, both Borgess and Bronson
(as well as hospitals around the country) shift a portion of
those costs to their paying customers, effectively charging
them extra.</p>
<p>Upjohn and other leading companies, many of which have
executives on the boards of both hospitals, began demanding
some sort of cooperation. In mid-1987, the chief executives
of the two hospitals began merger talks. That led to the
formation of First Health Development Corp., a company
comprising board members and doctors from both institutions.</p>
<p>"The joke in town is that they took the guns off the
helicopters during merger negotiations," says Kevin
Fickenscher, an assistant dean at Michigan State.</p>
<p>First Health's plan wasn't to eliminate competition but to
redefine it so the combined hospital would compete with other
hospitals in the region. In October 1988, after over a year
of courtship, Bronson and Borgess announced intentions to
consolidate.</p>
<p>Almost immediately, the romance turned rocky. In December,
Bronson won its fight to resume open-heart surgery and
refused to delay the service until negotiations were
completed. In January, First Health decided to name a chief
executive. The candidates: Borgess's Mr. Stack and Bronson's
Mr. Ludwig. The result: a 4-4 vote, deadlocked along loyalty
lines. First Health decided to leave the decision up to the
board of the combined hospital.</p>
<p>Then came the religious issues. Bronson's Methodist
affiliation is little more than a formality, but at Borgess,
each day begins with a prayer over the hospital intercom.
While neither side retained counsel who specialized in
mergers and acquisitions for the talks, Borgess hired a canon
lawyer to protect its religious interests.</p>
<p>Borgess insisted Bronson agree to bar abortion. Bronson
said abortions had to be available, even though the hospital
had performed just four in 1988. Finally, Bronson agreed to
do no abortions except in cases of anencephaly, in which the
brain fails to develop, or other rare instances when the
prognosis for the fetus is hopeless.</p>
<p>That wasn't good enough. Last October, talks collapsed.
And this spring, a new front in the war opened: laser
surgery.</p>
<p>Borgess announced in March it intended to triple its
annual volume of 500 laser procedures. In April, Bronson,
which says it already does 1,500 a year, trumped the plans by
performing the region's first laser gallbladder surgery --
and trumpeting the feat in newspaper ads.</p>
<p>"They're trying a pre-emptive thing to minimize the impact
of our program," charges J. Patrick Dyson, a Borgess senior
vice president. "One of the surgeons flew in from out of
town," he adds. "It's what we call itinerant surgery."
Bronson concedes the out-of-town surgeon trained the Bronson
doctors in the procedure, but he merely watched "to make sure
everything went fine," says James B. Falahee Jr., Bronson's
general counsel.</p>
<p>In this environment, businesses are looking at other ways
to keep costs down. Upjohn and other companies are
considering negotiating discount rates in return for a
guaranteed flow of patients. "We've never tried to bid one
against the other," says Upjohn's Dr. Cooper. "But we do have
other responsibilities," including assuring "a fair return to
shareholders."</p>
<p>The pressure is having some effect. Since 1985, Bronson
has trimmed staff by 9%. It didn't raise rates last year, and
last month announced a 5% across-the-board price cut. It
pledges to cut the difference between Bronson and Grand
Rapids hospitals by half this year. Borgess has reduced its
work force as well and plans package rates for cardiology and
other specialties.</p>
<p>One important cooperative effort is making headway. In
February, the hospitals announced plans to build a joint $10
million outpatient cancer treatment center downtown. Among
other things, it would mean the purchase of just one
million-dollar linear accelerator (used in radiation
treatment) instead of two.</p>
<p>A group of local executives called the CEO Council is
prodding the hospitals to consolidate other services. One
prime candidate: the helicopters. The hospitals say each
chopper makes more than 600 flights a year, enough to justify
two. They often back each other up, and it isn't unusual to
see the Bronson helicopter deliver a patient to Borgess and
vice versa.</p>
<p>Operating both units costs a total of $5 million a year,
says Dave Kovacs, medical director of Borgess Inflight
Medical Services, and combining their operations would save
at least $1 million, even while keeping both choppers
running.</p>
<p>But the helicopters are objects of intense pride. "We feel
ours has been successful because we are the major trauma
center," Bronson's Mr. Ludwig says. It plays an important
role in Bronson's emergency service, which generates 30% of
patient admissions, he adds.</p>
<p>Borgess, on the other hand, even distributes postcards and
calendars with pictures of its chopper in flight. And Borgess
proudly says that its was the first to rack up 3,000 trips.
Told that Bronson considers its own service the leader, Mr.
Stack shrugs and says: "It's a popular misconception on their
part."</p>
