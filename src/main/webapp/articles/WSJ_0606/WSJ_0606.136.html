	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Southmark Corp. said a federal bankruptcy judge
has approved its disclosure statement, allowing the company
to seek creditor and stockholder approval for its
reorganization plan.
   The real estate and thrift concern plans to reorganize
around its San Jacinto Savings Association thrift and to
liquidate most of its remaining assets. The company, which
filed last July for protection under Chapter 11 of the
federal Bankruptcy Code, said it will mail the disclosure
statements next week to about 127,000 creditors and security
holders, and collect votes until July 6.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Terms of the plan call for Southmark to pay about $300
million -- $76 million in cash, $75 million in secured notes,
$100 million in preferred stock, and the remainder in common
stock -- to settle approximately $2 billion in debts. As a
result, creditors are expected to receive a few pennies to
perhaps 32 cents for each dollar owed.</p>
<p>As part of the reorganization, Southmark said, creditors
have chosen Glen Adams, a former executive of Great Western
Sugar Co., to become the new chief executive officer after
the plan is approved, succeeding Arthur G. Weiss. Mr. Weiss,
an Atlanta businessman, has led the company since its top two
officers were ousted in January 1989.</p>
<p>The company said Mr. Adams is expected to join the company
soon. In addition, creditors have chosen as Southmark's new
directors Mr. Adams; Arthur Collins, founder and president of
a Connecticut real estate development company; Philip
Montgomery, president of a Dallas real estate management
company; and Richard J. Vossler Jr., an executive of a money
management firm that owns Southmark bonds.</p>
<p>A confirmation hearing on the reorganization plan is
scheduled for July 11. The company has said it hopes to have
its reorganization plan approved before July 17, when an
agreement among the company, San Jacinto and federal
regulators expires. That agreement calls for Southmark to put
about $100 million more in assets into the Houston-based
thrift, though the company said recently that even those
assets won't bring the thrift into compliance with federal
regulations.</p>
