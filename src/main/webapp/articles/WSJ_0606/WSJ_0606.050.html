	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Despite signs of a stagnant economy, Federal
Reserve officials appear to have no intention now of cutting
short-term interest rates.
   Interviews with a number of top Fed officials, some
speaking for the record and some insisting that their names
not be used, suggest the central bank isn't likely to ease
its grip on credit anytime soon. The comments came despite a
discouraging employment report Friday, which showed private
payrolls in the past three months expanded at their slowest
rate since the recession of 1982.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I am comfortable with policy as we sit here today," said
Fed governor Edward Kelley, describing the current policy
stance as "probably moderately restrictive."</p>
<p>"I think the best analysis might be that we are
accomplishing precisely what we set out to do," agreed Roger
Guffey, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.
"The economy is slowing into the area of 2% growth."</p>
<p>In the past, weak employment reports have prompted the
Federal Reserve to ease its grip on credit and allow
short-term interest rates to fall. So when the Labor
Department said Friday that private payrolls barely grew in
May, many market analysts and some Bush administration
officials began to speculate that the Fed would be moved to
ease.</p>
<p>But Fed officials seem convinced that stagnant job growth
doesn't presage a recession. Economic data watched closely by
Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, such as the level of inventories
and the lead times between orders and deliveries, show no
signs of a cumulative weakness in the economy.</p>
<p>Moreover, top Fed officials also seem relatively
unperturbed by recent slow growth in the money supply,
arguing that those numbers have been artificially depressed
by the government's accelerating pace in disposing of failed
savings-and-loan institutions.</p>
<p>And perhaps most importantly, Fed officials worry that
their tight-money policies haven't yet had the desired effect
in heading off a gradual pickup in inflation.</p>
<p>Mr. Guffey, for instance, says he still sees no signs that
the slowing economy has brought down inflation. "When you
look at the sectors, you don't get the sense that there is
anything other than a Mexican standoff," he said.</p>
<p>To be sure, further signs of deterioration in the economy,
or convincing evidence that inflation has slowed, could lead
the Fed to change course. But for now, it seems clear no
policy change is in store.</p>
<p>Fed policy is set by the 12-member Federal Open Market
Committee, which is made up of the seven Fed governors in
Washington and five of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Bank
presidents. That committee is scheduled to meet in Washington
July 2 and 3.</p>
<p>In the past few years, the regional presidents have tended
to favor a tighter Fed policy than their colleagues in
Washington. Cleveland Fed President Lee Hoskins, for
instance, has been the most consistent anti-inflation hawk.
And in an interview, he said the employment numbers hadn't
changed his views. "We shouldn't react to short-term
numbers," he said. "There is a lot of noise in the economic
numbers that come out, and our ability to forecast is quite
weak."</p>
<p>But for now, Fed Chairman Greenspan, Mr. Kelley and other
members of the Fed's board in Washington also appear willing
to keep their current relatively tight grip on credit. Mr.
Kelley noted there is "always the possibility" the economy
could slip into recession, but said "I don't see that in the
cards at this time and I don't expect it."</p>
