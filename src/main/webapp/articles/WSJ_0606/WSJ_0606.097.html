	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- It's a stock market money managers hate to
love.
   For many money managers, the stock market's recent string
of records has been about as cozy as an electric chair.
Staunchly refusing to jump into what they think is an
overpriced, highly speculative market, these bears are
sticking with high cash levels in their portfolios-even as
stocks head higher. As a result, many are watching their
performance slip.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"People keep asking me: `When are you going to buy?'" says
Henry Van der Eb, manager of the $235 million Mathers Fund,
which has had a 90% cash position since January. His answer:
Stocks are highly overvalued, and the U.S. is "potentially on
the edge of a deflationary recession or worse."</p>
<p>But a lot more investors are willing to jump into the
current rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 8.3%
in May alone. Yesterday, the industrials fell 10.19 points to
2925, a slight retreat from Monday's record close. Cash
levels in stock mutual funds, relatively high in April at 7%,
fell to 6.1% by the end of May, according to a survey of
1,200 funds by Indata. Yet there are still plenty of bears;
more than 45% of investment advisers were still pessimistic
in late May, according to an Investors Intelligence survey.</p>
<p>"The stock market has really climbed a wall of worry,"
says James Awad, president of BMI Capital, a money management
firm. "Corporate earnings have been difficult to navigate;
there has been little euphoria and lots of chances to lose
money. People are afraid to let their guard down."</p>
<p>So what's bothering the bears? They see pitfalls in a
stock market that keeps bulling its way higher and higher.
Even though analysts are cranking up earnings estimates up
for a number of companies, bearish investors don't like the
outlook for the economy or interest rates; most of all, the
bears are disturbed by the way stock values, in their view,
seem to ignore economic fundamentals and float higher.</p>
<p>Dozens of money managers who have performed well over the
years by buying cheap stocks say there are few bargains
today. Until a few weeks ago, many of these investors were
ahead of the stock market because they earned about 8% on
Treasury bills and other cash investments. But now the stock
market is gaining ground, and the bears are starting to
sweat.</p>
<p>Still, Eric Ryback, portfolio manager of the $600 million
Linder Fund, says he will not change his discipline. He says
the fund has performed well over the years guided by his
bargain-hunting discipline. Mr. Ryback is keeping cash at
23%, because there are so few cheap stocks to buy.</p>
<p>Charles Allmon, president and chairman of the $127 million
Growth Stock Outlook Trust, which has a 79% cash position,
says, "This market reminds me of 1987 all over again."</p>
<p>"There is a huge deluge of money coming into stock funds,"
Mr. Allmon says. "Brokers are saying they are getting calls
from people who haven't bought a stock for three years."</p>
<p>Mr. Allmon thinks stocks are overvalued by a number of
measures. He notes the stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average are trading at about 2.7 times the value of
underlying assets, while the average for the past 50 years is
about 1.5 times underlying assets. Even if current valuations
reflect higher earnings potential, Mr. Allmon thinks much of
the cash that factories and labor are generating is going
toward hefty interest payments on debt, and not dividends to
shareholders.</p>
<p>Besides, he says, plants are operating at a high capacity,
so he doubts there is room for higher production to generate
more profits.</p>
<p>"The pipelines are full, and a slowdown is in the cards,"
he says. "Common sense should tell you that this {market} is
living on borrowed time. People are not investing, they're
speculating."</p>
<p>Dividend yield is another troubling fact for Mr. Allmon.
He says with further declines in the dividend yield on the
Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which is now about 3.3%,
stocks will not be able to compete with the low-risk returns
of Treasury bills.</p>
<p>Still, some investors who were cautious for much of this
year are throwing in the towel amid the current rally. BMI's
Mr. Awad has been buying stocks and has reduced his cash
levels to about 10% from about 25% at the end of March.</p>
<p>"If you are paid to outperform the market, you have to
capitulate," he says. But even those money managers who jump
on the stock bandwagon aren't particularly confident, he
says. "It has been so hard to beat the market that money
managers are gun-shy," fearful of another sudden stock market
correction like in January or October.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most powerful argument that the dwindling camp
of bearish investors can muster is that interest rates are
falling because the economy is slowing. Inflation is dropping
because corporations can't raise prices, according to Carmine
Grigoli, chief strategist at First Boston Corp.</p>
<p>Another danger, bears say, is the summary punishment that
investors are exacting on stocks that veer from the market's
expectations of high earnings growth. "Companies which
reported earnings on the light side of expectations -- such
as Fluor, L.A. Gear, and Adobe Systems -- saw holders of
these stocks exit in a rapid manner," says Ellen Harris,
chief domestic investment officer at PaineWebber Mutual
Funds; she has a 20% cash position in an $84 million fund she
manages. "That type of behavior is not consistent with a
broad-based move," she says. "Investors are showing caution
and a happy trigger finger." Mr. Van der Eb says that at the
first sign of an earnings setback, many of the growth stocks
"are taken behind the shed and shot."</p>
<p>Still sticking to his 90% cash position, Mr. Van der Eb
claims the current rally is a "classic triumph of psychology
over fundamentals." He vows: "We are not going to deviate
from our discipline. Stocks are more expensive than they were
six months ago, while earnings are lower and interest rates
are higher."</p>
<p>Arnold Kaufman, editor of S&P's Outlook newsletter, says
that many of the staunch bears simply got blindsided. They
"didn't see the rally coming. There was a lot of intricate
reasoning for the market not to do what it's doing now. And
when it gets to a new all-time high, you hate to jump on the
bandwagon."</p>
