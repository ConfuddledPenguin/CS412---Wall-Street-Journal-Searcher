	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Mervyn Lahn, chairman and chief executive
officer of CT Financial Services Inc., said he plans to
resign Dec. 30. CT Financial is 98.2%-owned by a unit of
Montreal-based Imasco Ltd.
   Mr. Lahn is also chairman and chief executive officer of
Canada Trustco Mortgage Co., Canada's second-largest trust
concern in terms of assets. Canadian trust companies are
similar to U.S. thrifts.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Lahn, 56 years old, said he is resigning because,
after 17 years as chief executive officer, he wants to make
way for younger executives. He said CT Financial's board is
expected to name his successor on June 25. The new chief
executive officer will be someone currently with the company,
he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Lahn said he has no specific career plans, but he
won't join another trust concern after he leaves CT
Financial.</p>
<p>Imasco, a consumer products and financial services
concern, is 40.4%-owned by B.A.T Industries PLC of the U.K.</p>
