	<p class="article-leader">Adolph Coors Co. said its brewing unit agreed to buy a
Memphis, Tenn., brewery from Detroit-based Stroh Brewery Co.
Terms weren't disclosed.
   The deal would give the Golden, Colo., company its first
large group of union workers in about 13 years and its first
beer ever brewed outside Colorado.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The acquisition, which is expected to be completed about
July 3, would alleviate the severe packaging-facility
shortages and imminent brewing-capacity shortages that Coors
faces because of its recent rapid growth. In the first
quarter, Coors shipments rose nearly 30% to four million
barrels from a year earlier. In 1989, its shipments grew
faster than those of any other major U.S. brewer, expanding
6.5% to 17.7 million barrels.</p>
<p>Coors brews only in its Golden facility, which can brew
about 20 million barrels a year, and packages beer in Golden
and Elkton, Va. Coors's major problem now is its limited
packaging capacity, as the company struggles to fill its
bottles and cans for the peak summer season. The packaging
facilities at both locations are being operated at or above
design capacity to meet demand, said Peter Coors, president
of the brewing unit, who noted that Coors distributors aren't
getting all the beer they want in the packages they want.</p>
<p>Coors said it plans to increase its Golden brewing
capacity to about 28 million barrels a year, but this
expansion won't be completed until 1995. Mr. Coors said
Stroh's 1971-vintage Memphis brewery has a capacity of 5.5
million barrels and can probably be retrofitted and ready to
produce and package Coors products for next year's summer
season. He said the company hasn't determined what beer or
how much it would brew in Memphis.</p>
<p>Coors would inherit a unionized work force and a union
contract at the Memphis brewery. Coors beer was the subject
of a 10-year boycott by the AFL-CIO after a 1977 strike, and
now its only union workers are some Operating Engineers in
Golden. The Teamsters organized a vote of Coors brewery
workers in December 1988, after the union boycott was ended,
but 73% of the employees rejected union representation.</p>
<p>"We have no aversion to having unions," Mr. Coors said.
Coors managers began holding talks with the Teamsters and the
Brewery and Soft Drink Workers Conference representatives in
Memphis yesterday, he said.</p>
<p>The planned sale would leave troubled Stroh with five
breweries. Stroh's 1989 shipments fell nearly 10% to about
18.4 million barrels from a year earlier. The company
acquired many brands and some breweries throughout the 1980s
by buying other brewers such as Schlitz, but the family-owned
company wasn't able to catch up with the market leaders,
Anheuser-Busch Cos. and Miller Brewing Co., or match the
marketing dollars of the two giants. In 1989, Stroh, the
nation's fourth-largest brewer in terms of shipments,
retained Morgan Stanley & Co. to try to help sell the company
or some of its assets.</p>
<p>Last September, Coors, the third-largest brewer in the
U.S., signed a deal to buy most of Stroh for about $425
million, but that agreement expired in December without a
final deal. People close to the negotiations have said that
the agreement fell apart during due-diligence investigations,
which disclosed a substantially weaker Stroh than Coors
executives had anticipated.</p>
