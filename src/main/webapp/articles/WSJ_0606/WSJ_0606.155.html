	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. is expected
to present a proposed reorganization plan to its creditors
today that would pay them 100 cents on the dollar.
   The company, which filed under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code on Feb. 13, has told its creditors'
committee, its shareholders' committee and the Securities and
Exchange Commission that it will unveil the proposal at 2
p.m. at the office of Drexel's bankruptcy-law firm, Weil,
Gotshal & Manges in Manhattan.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The proposed reorganization plan would be the first step
in negotiating the final plan to pay Drexel creditors and
possibly allow Drexel to emerge from Chapter 11 as an
operating company. The two committees already have begun work
on their own proposals.</p>
<p>People familiar with the case said Drexel had sent letters
to the two committees and to the SEC advising them that a
proposal would be made today.</p>
<p>Drexel's proposal is expected to say that creditors will
be paid 100 cents on the dollar. The proposal would involve a
senior series of notes secured by Drexel assets, an attorney
familiar with the case said. Drexel's assets have an
estimated value of about $200 million.</p>
<p>As part of the plan, Drexel also is expected to set aside
money to pay estimated claims stemming from approximately 400
lawsuits pending against the company.</p>
<p>Last night, Drexel's attorneys couldn't be reached for
comment.</p>
<p>As part of the plan, Drexel is expected to propose that
the company continue operating under current management,
essentially to oversee efforts to pay off creditors.</p>
<p>Barry Dichter, an attorney for the central bank of
Portugal, said he and other creditors are likely to oppose a
plan that leaves current management in place. A member of one
of the committees said the creditors and shareholders
probably would seek some way to oversee the management of any
operating company that emerges.</p>
<p>Drexel specifically invited only the SEC and members of
creditors' and shareholders' reorganization subcommittees to
the unveiling of the proposal. But in notifying the groups,
Drexel said representatives of any interested party would be
welcome. As a result, hundreds of attorneys are expected to
show up, that may make it difficult for any real discussion
of the plan to take place.</p>
