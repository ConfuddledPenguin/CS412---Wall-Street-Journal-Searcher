	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Phillips-Van Heusen Corp. reported a 78% drop
in fiscal first-quarter net income and said it is negotiating
to swap about half its preferred stock for less-expensive
subordinated debt.
   The apparel company's announcement got a positive response
from analysts and from investors, who sent Phillips-Van
Heusen's shares up 62.5 cents, to $22.25, in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the quarter ended April 29, PhillipsVan Heusen said
net income sank to $643,000 from nearly $3 million a year
earlier. On a per-share basis, the results were a 15-cent
loss and a 10-cent profit, respectively, both reflecting more
than $2 million of preferred-stock dividends. Sales rose 4.9%
to $155.4 million from $148.1 million.</p>
<p>"We were looking for a 20-cent loss and they came in at 15
cents. That was encouraging," said Jay J. Meltzer, analyst at
Goldman, Sachs & Co.</p>
<p>The preferred stock-for-debt swap, involving about half
Phillips-Van Heusen's $72 million of preferred stock, could
save the company as much as $1.2 million after tax annually,
said Irwin W. Winter, the company's chief financial officer.
The preferred, which is held by Prudential Insurance Co. of
America, carries an 11.25% interest rate.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Meltzer noted that the swap "will benefit
earnings because interest costs are deductible while
preferred dividends are not."</p>
