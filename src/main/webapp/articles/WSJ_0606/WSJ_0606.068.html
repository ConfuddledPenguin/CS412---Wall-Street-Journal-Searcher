	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- A former supervisory officer of Security
Pacific National Bank's central vault, 27-year-old Jose O.
Lopez, was sentenced Monday to 46 months in prison for
conspiracy in a drug-money laundering operation.
   Also sentenced for the same offense was Geno Apicella, 27,
to 37 months in prison. Both men pleaded guilty Feb. 28 to
the conspiracy charges, which came after an undercover
investigation by Internal Revenue Service special agents and
internal investigators of Security Pacific National Bank, a
unit of Los Angeles-based Security Pacific Corp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>During the four-month investigation, an IRS undercover

defendants pleaded guilty to conspiracy and were previously
sentenced.</p>
