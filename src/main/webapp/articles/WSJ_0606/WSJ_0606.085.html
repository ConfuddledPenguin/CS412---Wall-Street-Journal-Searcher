	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- The Chicago Mercantile Exchange said it fined
William A. Walsh $35,000 and expelled him from membership for
making fraudulent Swiss-franc futures trades in 1988.
   Mr. Walsh, one of 48 individuals who was indicted last
year by a federal grand jury here on fraud charges, pleaded
guilty to making the illicit trades and is cooperating with
the government investigation of trading fraud. He is expected
to be called as a government witness in the trial of three
Swiss-franc futures traders that is under way in U.S.
District Court here.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As part of his guilty plea arranged with the U.S.
attorney, Mr. Walsh will pay an unspecified amount of money
as restitution to customers he defrauded.</p>
