	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Regency Cruises Inc. said it expects to report
a second-quarter operating loss, reflecting unrest in Latin
America, bad Caribbean weather and a ship that ran aground
last month.
   William Schanz, the company's chairman, disclosed the
expected loss at the company's annual meeting, but didn't
provide further details, including whether Regency will
report a net loss.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>He did say that Regency's cruise business off the coast of
Alaska is "currently booked at approximately 85% of
capacity." Most of that business is done in the third
quarter, which a spokesman said is traditionally the
company's best period.</p>
<p>A second-quarter loss would be Regency's third consecutive
quarterly deficit. In the first quarter, Regency had a loss
of $2 million, or nine cents a share; in last year's fourth
period, the company had a loss of $1.2 million, or five cents
a share.</p>
<p>The company pegged its first-quarter and second-quarter
woes to a lack of tour interest in Panama, prior to and
following the U.S. invasion; a State Department advisory that
Americans steer clear of Colombia; and Hurricane Hugo, which
devastated the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Last month, an electrical snafu forced one of Regency's
three ships, the Regent Star, to run aground in Delaware Bay.
The company subsequently canceled a five-day cruise, and
scratched a two-day cruise because of a small fire on the
ship three days later.</p>
<p>But a spokesman said things could improve by the third
quarter because Alaska cruise bookings are strong. And
Regency has pulled out of the problem-plagued Caribbean,
opting instead for a potentially more lucrative New
York-Montreal route.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, holders at the meeting approved adoption of a
stock-option incentive plan for executives that calls for the
issuance of one million new common shares. Holders also
re-elected three directors to three-year terms, including Mr.
Schanz, Fred A. Mayer and Roland J. Hawkins.</p>
