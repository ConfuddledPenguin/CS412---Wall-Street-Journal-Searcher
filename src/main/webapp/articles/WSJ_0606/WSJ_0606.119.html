	<p class="article-leader">THE SOVIET UNION ANNOUNCED unilateral arms cuts in Central
Europe.
   Shevardnadze, at an East-West conference in Copenhagen,
said Moscow would remove a significant number of its nuclear
weapons from the region "to create favorable conditions" for
U.S.-Soviet negotiations on short-range nuclear missiles. The
Soviet foreign minister also met with Secretary of State
Baker and suggested that they had made some progress on the
issue of German unification. In Moscow, the Soviet
legislature tentatively postponed adoption of a law to ease
limits on emigration, a move that could jeopardize a
Bush-Gorbachev summit agreement that would increase Soviet
trade with the U.S.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ethnic unrest flared in the Central Asian border city of
Osh as Uzbeks and Kirghiz clashed over land. At least 11
people were reported killed, and officials imposed a state of
emergency.</p>

<p>New Jersey's Supreme Court ruled that the state's system
of financing public schools doesn't provide enough money for
poorer, urban districts. In striking down the system, the
court said the property taxbased system violates the state's
constitutional guarantee of a "thorough and efficient"
education.</p>

<p>Rebels in Liberia seized a large rubber plantation as they
battled government troops for control of an area about 25
miles from Monrovia. In Washington, the State Department said
the U.S. military won't intervene in the conflict, even
though Navy warships are off the West African country's
coast, poised to help evacuate Americans.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Two rival Cambodian leaders signed an agreement in Tokyo
calling for a conditional cease-fire to end 11 years of civil
war in the Southeast Asian nation. But the accord, reached by
Cambodia's Prime Minister Hun Sen and guerrilla coalition
leader Prince Sihanouk, was given little chance of success
because of a boycott by the Khmer Rouge.</p>

<p>East German joblessness tripled since April and the
government, concerned about civil unrest, unveiled a program
to blunt the effects of an economic transition under the
planned German unification. Officials said factories will cut
work turns and wages to keep more people employed, and that a
new agency would oversee worker retraining.</p>

<p>South Korea's Roh expressed hope that his talks Monday
with Gorbachev would lead to full diplomatic ties between
Seoul and Moscow, as well as peace on the Korean peninsula.
The presidents didn't set a timetable to normalize relations,
but some believe the move could come as soon as September.</p>

<p>A Michigan doctor helped an Alzheimer's patient commit
suicide, allowing her to use a device to administer a lethal
dose of chemicals. The woman, 54, pressed a button on the
contraption, built by the physician, that released the
mixture, the doctor said. Some medical ethicists called the
doctor's actions immoral and perhaps illegal.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Presbyterians adopted a statement of faith combining
Christian beliefs with environmental concerns and likening
God to both a mother and father. The Presbyterian Church
(U.S.A.) statement, which must be ratified by the Protestant
denomination's members, is the first since a 1983 merger
ended a 122-year split within the church.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The Senate refused to limit debate on an omnibus
anti-crime bill. Democratic opponents are expected to try
again tomorrow to invoke cloture. Failure to do so could
extend debate on more than 240 pending amendments for weeks,
and prompt the Democratic leadership to pull the legislation.</p>

<p>Mulroney held closed-door negotiations in a bid to win
over two holdout provincial governments and prevent the
collapse of talks aimed at resolving Canada's constitutional
impasse. The Canadian leader gained the support Monday of New
Brunswick, which also had opposed an accord granting
French-speaking Quebec special status.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Mandela said South African President de Klerk would make
an "important statement" soon, raising speculation that the
Pretoria government would lift a four-year-old state of
emergency. The black nationalist leader made his remarks in
Botswana.</p>

<p>India's police killed 13 suspected Sikh extremists in the
northern state of Punjab, and at least 22 other people were
killed in a bout of separatist violence. The deaths occurred
on the sixth anniversary of a raid by the Indian military on
the holiest Sikh shrine, the Golden Temple complex in
Amritsar.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Ethiopia said it would allow a rebel-held Red Sea port to
be used for the delivery of food to millions of famine
victims. The strategic port of Masawa has been closed since
it was captured by the insurgents in February. The rebels,
meanwhile, warned of attacks if a plan to use Soviet planes
to transport U.S. relief supplies is carried out.</p>
