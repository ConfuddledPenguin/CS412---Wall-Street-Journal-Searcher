	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said it
rejected an offer for its 26% stake in Continental Bank Corp.
made by private investors, Continental and some of its
executives.
   The offer, a Continental official said, was made at about
$15 a share, or near market price last week, for a total of
more than $200 million for the equivalent of 14.2 million
shares that the FDIC owns.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The FDIC said it "remains committed to realizing full
value for its holdings, and will explore all options for
divesting its ownership in the company."</p>
<p>The FDIC became a shareholder of Chicago-based Continental
as part of the agency's 1984 rescue of the former Continental
Illinois Corp., the holding company for Continental Illinois
National Bank & Trust Co.</p>
<p>Along with the market, Continental stock has rallied since
last week. Yesterday, in composite trading on the New York
Stock Exchange, Continental's common closed at $17, up $1, on
volume of 194,400 shares.</p>
<p>Thomas C. Theobald, Continental's chairman and chief
executive officer, said in a statement: "I'm dumbfounded that
in a little more than six months the FDIC has passed up two
legitimate opportunities to sell its minority interest in
Continental. Not only have they failed to turn their asset
into cash, but they've continued ownership in a healthy bank,
which is a wholly unwarranted role for a regulator."</p>
<p>The FDIC turned down a proposal from Continental last fall
to buy the agency's stake through a public offering.</p>
