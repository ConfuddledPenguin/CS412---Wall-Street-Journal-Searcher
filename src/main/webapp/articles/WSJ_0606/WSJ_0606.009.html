	<p class="article-leader">Wind Cave, Ky. -- Jim Webb lugs his guitar case down a
steep bank past wooden shacks and chicken coops, remnants of
a century-old homestead where generations have raised tobacco
and cattle.
   After searching for days, Mr. Webb has learned from
neighbors that this obscure spot is home to Elbert McQueen, a
wiry fiddle player. Most days, the 63-year-old Mr. McQueen
tends to the farm, feeding chickens and shooing steers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But a steady rain offers a good excuse to go indoors and
play some mountain music with his guest. "A lot of my tunes
are leaving me," he laments. He coaxes a wail from an antique
fiddle.</p>
<p>Old timers like Mr. McQueen are disappearing fast. And so
is their music. Armed with a banjo, guitar and tape recorder,
Mr. Webb is a modern day Chaucer. But rather than retelling
what he hears, he plays it to schoolchildren and anyone else
who will listen. His mission: to capture the native tunes of
Appalachia, before they recede into the hills never to be
heard again.</p>
<p>"It's gotten to the point where the media age has
decimated this sort of culture," says Mr. Webb, whose few
gray hairs offer the only hint that he's 42. "Most people
don't think it's important because music doesn't help pay the
bills."</p>
<p>The son of a mechanic and a writer, Mr. Webb's interest in
bluegrass music began when he got his first guitar at age 17.
Leaving his boyhood home in the Maryland suburbs of
Washington, D.C., he enrolled in Bellarmine College in
Louisville, Ky.</p>
<p>Since then, he's played bluegrass at bars and folk
festivals. To support himself, he's mowed grass in
graveyards, driven cabs and built furniture. "There's not a
neat little slot for people like me to fit into," the
boyish-faced Mr. Webb says.</p>
<p>But pursuing his own slot has meant a lean lifestyle for
him and his wife, Stephanie, and infant son, Johnson. This
year, they exist on a $6,000 grant from the Kentucky Arts
Council. He expects to make a little money from an organic
vegetable garden he planted this spring.</p>
<p>"The income is pretty limited, but it's unpretentious and
it's real," says Mr. Webb.</p>
<p>So's the music he is trying to preserve. The songs reflect
the daily struggles of mountain people, focusing on such
subjects as farming, hunting, love affairs and death. They
were passed down from fathers to sons and mothers to
daughters, and played every time neighbors gathered. But now
it's often only the old folks who know the words.</p>
<p>"An old guy missing most of his teeth and playing a banjo
isn't a viable product," says Jeff Place, folklife archivist
at the Smithsonian Institution. "The music industry is
looking for a product to sell."</p>
<p>Though some suggest interest in mountain music is up, Mr.
Webb is hard pressed to find evidence of a sweeping revival.
As he drives through the Kentucky hills, he grumbles that
television has robbed a generation of its past. Satellite
dishes bring HBO and MTV into tiny wooden shacks where many
families still live. "That's what caused all the damage," he
says.</p>
<p>With annual art-council grants, Mr. Webb has traveled to
various schools in the state to teach music. This spring he
visited Tyner Elementary School, where he's known simply as
"the music man."</p>
<p>Especially amusing are the lyrics to a few of his ditties.
Singing "Four Wet Pigs," Mr. Webb squeals: "Cut 'em into hot
dogs, slice 'em into ham, chop 'em into pork chops, squeeze
them into Spam."</p>
<p>But it's tough to get youngsters hooked on some older
tunes, like "Peg and Awl," a story of a cobbler who was
replaced by assembly line. "Do you know what a cobbler is?"
he asks the class. "Is it a chicken?" replies a boy in the
front row. "No that's a gobbler," Mr. Webb says.</p>
<p>The class yawns and fidgets as he sings the lonesome tune.
So he tries to appease them by taking their requests for
other songs. Showing their tender age, the group of fourth
graders chants: "Play some Elvis."</p>
<p>Another obstacle in preserving the music is finding the
musicians. Many live in towns never marked on any map. And
there are few meeting places left where musicians gather.
"People used to play in their homes. That gave them a sense
of community. They just don't do it much anymore," says Mr.
Webb.</p>
<p>So he's a bit of a sleuth, tracking down leads, going
door-to-door. His searches always provide a history lesson on
Appalachia, as well as its music. Mr. McQueen tells Mr. Webb
about the time Bill Monroe, considered the father of
bluegrass, visited the hollow.</p>
<p>Mr. Webb believes storytelling is key to learning the
roots of mountain music. He asks for details on Mr. McQueen's
lifetime on the farm. Until a few years ago, he learns, the
McQueens used a team of mules to plow. "We had to scratch our
toenails off to keep the bills paid," he says. "It's play now
because I have a tractor."</p>
<p>The two men sit in wooden chairs, playing tunes like
"Billy and the Low Ground."</p>
<p>Sometimes he meets people who are trying to break into the
music business. One day, he stops at Dan and Nora Lee
Caldwell's house in rural Jackson County. Mr. Caldwell, an
unemployed truck driver, tells Mr. Webb about his plans to
build a recording studio in the vacant field next to their
house.</p>
<p>They discuss the musicians who've influenced them, legends
like the Carter family and the Stanley Brothers. "You wanna
pick a couple tunes?" Mr. Webb asks, itching to get started.
He tunes his 1953 Martin guitar, bought secondhand for $160.</p>
<p>Later that night, Mr. Webb visits Samuel T. Evans, a
retired farmer and banjo player in nearby Tyner, Ky. The
75-year-old Mr. Evans teaches him the claw hammer style, a
technique in which only the thumb strikes the strings.</p>
<p>Mr. Webb watches Mr. Evans's leathery hands and calloused
fingertips dance across the banjo's strings as he plays. He
hands the banjo to Mr. Webb, so he can try the technique.
"You're good at that," says Mr. Evans, who has played the
banjo for 60 years.</p>
<p>The evening slips away as the two musicians stomp their
feet in time to the music. Soon the stomping stops. Mr. Webb
says his goodbyes and slips out the door. A cool rain hits
his face. Smiling, he says, "This puts me at peace."</p>
