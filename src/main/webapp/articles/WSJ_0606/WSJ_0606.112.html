	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Bloomingdale's said it will close its branches
in Dallas and Stamford, Conn.
   Chairman and Chief Executive Marvin Traub said the
closings followed a routine review of the company's
operations. The two stores generate about 4.5% of the
17-store chain's revenue.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>According to an offering prospectus prepared last year by
First Boston Corp., Bloomingdale's was expected to produce
$107.5 million of earnings before interest and taxes in its
fiscal year ending Jan. 31, on revenue of $1.3 billion.
Bloomingdale's parent, Federated Department Stores Inc., a
unit of Campeau Corp., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection in January.</p>
<p>Retail experts say the decision to close the Dallas and
Stamford stores makes business sense because sales were
declining at both units. The Stamford store generated about
$35 million in revenue for the fiscal year ended January 28,
1989; while the Dallas store produced about $30 million in
sales during that period.</p>
<p>The Dallas store opened in 1983 with much fanfare, but it
never really caught on with local shoppers. Over the last
three years, revenue declined more than 11%. Bloomingdale's
opened its Stamford store in l954. Since l985, Bloomingdale's
revenue at Stamford has declined one or two percentage
points.</p>
<p>Gordon Cooke, executive vice president for sales promotion
at Bloomingdale's, said that the chain doesn't have plans to
close additional stores.</p>
