	<p class="article-leader">A Wisconsin appeals court has ruled that beer sales
representatives can't buy a round for patrons of bars they
service, but a Milwaukee-area beer distributor is considering
taking it to a higher bench.
   Under a decades-old state law designed to prevent brewers
and wholesalers from gaining control of retail outlets, they
are prohibited from giving bar owners "furniture, fixtures,
fittings, equipment, money or other thing of value."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales people for closely held Miller Brands-Milwaukee Inc.
have for years been following the widespread practice known
as "trade spending," buying drinks all around when they drop
in to service an account at a bar. Federal law permits such
spending.</p>
<p>But Wisconsin's Department of Revenue, after receiving a
complaint, began an investigation of whether Miller Brands'
largesse violates state law.</p>
<p>Miller Brands went to court, and got a summary judgment
that the practice isn't a violation. But last week, the
appeals court said buying a round generates profit for the
bar owner, as well as good will, and that those things
unambiguously represent "a thing of value."</p>
<p>Trade spending has been "going on in the industry as long
as there's been a brewing industry," says James Shellow, an
attorney for Miller Brands. The appeals court's
interpretation, he says, "suggests that any Miller officer
couldn't buy drinks in a tavern, couldn't even buy dinner in
a place licensed to sell alcohol."</p>
<p>For that matter, says Mr. Shellow, under the wording of
the law, the court's ruling would mean stockholders of Philip
Morris Cos. would be under the same prohibitions. Miller
Brands, which distributes beer made by Philip Morris's Miller
Brewing unit but has no other links to the company, is
considering asking the state's supreme court to review the
ruling.</p>
<p>In a dissenting opinion, one of the appeals court judges
pointed out that Miller Brands doesn't require patrons to buy
its brands, and pays full price for whatever the customers
order. The law was originally designed to block the
once-rampant abuses known as the "tied house," in which
manufacturers and wholesalers gained control of retail
outlets by creating financial obligations through costly
"gifts" or loans. The judge said there is "nothing in the
record to indicate" Miller Brands' purchases were aimed at
creating such an obligation. Rather, the trade spending
appears to be "no more than a reasonable marketing device,"
he says.</p>
<p>If "purchasing a beverage -- a beer, or perhaps a soda --
for a retailer's customer is a thing of value to the retailer
within the statute's purview, what about a stick of gum," the
dissent asked. "A handful of peanuts?"</p>

<p>GARY HART and Denver law firm form international
consulting venture.</p>
<p>Called International Strategies, the venture will be an
affiliate owned by Davis, Graham & Stubbs, the Denver firm
where Mr. Hart has been an attorney since he left the U.S.
Senate in 1987. Since then Mr. Hart has been heavily involved
in helping the firm's existing and potential clients explore
international business markets. Apparently, the new venture
is at least partially aimed at taking advantage of his
ability to attract business in this area.</p>
<p>David Miller, a principal at the Denver consulting firm of
Greenberg Baron Simon & Miller, will be a consultant to the
venture, which will help American and foreign companies
pursue international business and trade, find joint venture
partners, deal with governments and arrange financing.</p>
<p>Mr. Hart said the firm has heard from an increasing number
of businesses wanting to know about expanding into Eastern
bloc countries, particularly the Soviet Union. "In the last
year or so, it's dramatically increased," he said, noting
that the firm currently is working on a half-dozen
"significant" projects. Mr. Hart recently has been involved
in the efforts of one client, U S West Inc., to develop a
$500 million fiber-optic cable in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The former senator and presidential candidate said his
role with the firm wouldn't change. But since the expanding
consulting business isn't strictly a law practice, it was
decided that creating an affiliate was an appropriate move.</p>
<p>"We just felt that to keep the professional lines clear it
would be best to have an affiliate that advised people, with
the understanding that if negotiations went forward, Davis,
Graham & Stubbs would end up being legal counsel," Mr. Hart
said.</p>

<p>SOFTWARE THEFT CASE against Westinghouse can go to trial,
judge rules.</p>
<p>A federal judge in Connecticut cleared the way for a
software developer's suit against Westinghouse Communications
Software, Inc., a unit of Westinghouse Electric Corp.; the
subsidiary's chairman, Oliver MacKinnon; and Communications
Design Corp., a company primarily owned by Mr. MacKinnon.</p>
<p>The judge rejected the defendants' request to dismiss
plaintiff John McCann's complaint that Communications Design
stole and marketed telephone management systems software
allegedly developed by Mr. McCann when he worked there.
Westinghouse Communications purchased Communications Design's
assets in 1989.</p>
<p>Mr. McCann alleges that joint ventures between
Westinghouse and Ameritech Information System rely on
software he developed. He is seeking up to $65 million in
damages.</p>
<p>Richard Horgan, of the Stamford, Conn., office of
Winthrop, Stimson, Putnam & Roberts, which represents Mr.
MacKinnon, said Mr. McCann was fired from Communications
Design in 1981 because he was unable to perform his job and
the programs he wrote did not work as intended. Hoping to
"get rich," Mr. McCann "came out of the woodwork" to file the
suit when he learned that Mr. MacKinnon was selling his
company, Mr. Horgan said. He has filed a motion requesting
sanctions against Mr. McCann and his lawyers for "bringing a
baseless suit."</p>
<p>A trial date hasn't been scheduled for the case.</p>
<p>A lawyer for Westinghouse, Edward Hennessey of Robinson &
Cole in Hartford, said the company was aware of Mr. McCann's
claim when it acquired Communications Design's assets and
that the purchase agreement protects Westinghouse "should
there be some validity to the claim."</p>

<p>TOP-GROSSING FIRM in Atlanta adopts two-tier partnership.</p>
<p>King & Spalding, a 242-attorney firm, decided to add a
"nonequity" partnership level in an effort, it says, to
retain high-quality lawyers who would not have been made full
equity partners after their stints as associates.</p>
<p>For some lawyers, the nonequity partnership will be an
interim position, for others a final landing point. "They are
all still going to be eligible to be considered to election
to equity partnership," said James Wildman, managing partner
of King & Spalding. "But for those not qualified, we think
this will provide a new opportunity for long-term employment
at the firm that didn't exist before."</p>
<p>The firm will begin using the category when it names its
new partners July 1. The nonequity partners will be salaried
and will attend partnership meetings but won't vote.</p>
<p>The move reflects something of a national trend at major
firms: The long and winding road to partnership is getting
longer and more winding -- and chances are increasing that
the path may not lead to full equity partnership at all.</p>
<p>Driven by the economic realities of a more competitive
legal environment, such alternatives to equity partnership
are becoming more common. "Plenty of midsized firms are
looking at or implementing these programs," said Ward Bower,
of Altman & Weil Inc., a Newtown Square, Pa., legal
management consulting firm. The nonequity partnership creates
"a more flexible career path."</p>
<p>Some firms are adopting other alternatives, such as
"senior attorney" or "senior counsel" posts, or in effect
creating different tiers of partners by varying compensation
among them.</p>

<p>BAKER & MCKENZIE nabs 14-lawyer real-estate finance group.</p>
<p>The New York office of Baker & McKenzie added three
partners and 11 associates from the real estate finance group
of New York law firm Mudge Rose Guthrie Alexander & Ferdon.
What lured the group away, says one of the partners, Richard
Weidman, was Baker & McKenzie's international business,
especially in Tokyo, Hong Kong and other Pacific hubs.</p>
<p>Says Mr. Weidman, "We were not dissatisfied with Mudge,
but the situation at Baker & McKenzie, the match of our
client base with their infrastructure, was just so good."</p>
<p>Baker & McKenzie, based in Chicago, has a total of 1,515
lawyers in 50 offices world-wide. The firm plans to double
the size of its New York office, which has 100 lawyers now,
in the next two years. Areas targeted for expansion are
finance, creditors' rights and environmental law.</p>
<p>Donald J. Zoeller, a member of the executive committee at
Mudge Rose, said of the exodus: "It's just one of those
things that happens in the lives of large law firms. There's
a great deal of mobility in the profession now and we have
been spared from it mercifully for a long time."</p>
<p>Mr. Zoeller said two partners and a number of associates
remain in Mudge Rose's real estate finance group.</p>
