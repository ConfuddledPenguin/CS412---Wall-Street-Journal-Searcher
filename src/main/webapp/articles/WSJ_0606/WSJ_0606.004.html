	<p class="article-leader">The past decade has been the most ambitious period of
school reform in the nation's history. But evidence of school
improvement -- e.g., in test scores and dropout rates -- is
almost impossible to find.
   How can government work so hard to solve a problem yet
make so little progress? The conclusion Stanford Prof. Terry
Moe and I reached -- after analyzing more than 20,000
students, teachers and principals in a nationwide sample of
500 schools -- is that government has not solved the
education problem, because government is the problem.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The public education system functions naturally and
routinely, despite everyone's best intentions, to burden
schools with excessive bureaucracy, to discourage effective
school organization, and to stifle student achievement.
Efforts to improve schools are therefore doomed unless they
eliminate or sharply curtail the influence of the
institutions that cause the schools' problems in the first
place.</p>
<p>We consequently propose a new system of public education
that will not be governed directly by politics but will be
controlled indirectly through markets -- through school
competition and parental choice. Markets, we found,
discourage excessive bureaucracy and promote more effective
schools. Because states have primary responsibility for
public education, the best way to establish a "choice" system
is for states to withdraw authority from existing
institutions and vest it directly in the schools, parents and
students -- as follows:</p>
<p>The state will be responsible for setting criteria that
define what constitutes a "public school" under the new
system. These criteria should be minimal, roughly
corresponding to the criteria many states now use in
accrediting private schools -- graduation requirements,
health and safety requirements, and teacher certification
requirements. Any group or organization that meets these
minimal criteria must then be chartered as a public school
and granted the right to accept students and receive public
money. Existing private and parochial schools (as long as
their religious functions are kept separate) will be
eligible, and their participation should be encouraged,
because they constitute a ready supply of often-effective
schools.</p>
<p>School districts can continue running their present
schools, but they will have no authority over any of the
others that may be chartered by the state.</p>
<p>The state will set up a Choice Office in each district,
which, among other things, will maintain a record of all
school-age children and the level of funding -- the
"scholarship" amounts -- associated with each child. This
office will directly compensate schools based on the specific
children they enroll. Public money will flow from funding
sources to the Choice Office and then to schools.</p>
<p>The state must pay to support its own Choice Office in
each district. Districts may retain as much of their current
governing apparatus as they wish, but they have to pay for it
out of the scholarship revenue of those children who choose
to attend district-run schools.</p>
<p>As it does now, the state will have the right to specify
how much, or by what formula, each district must contribute
for each child. Our preference is for an equalization
approach that requires wealthier districts to contribute more
per child than poor districts do and that guarantees an
adequate financial foundation to students in all districts.</p>
<p>Scholarships will also take into account special
educational needs -- arising from economic deprivation,
physical handicaps, and other disadvantages -- that can be
met effectively only through costly specialized programs.
State and federal programs already appropriate public money
to address these problems. These funds should take the form
of add-ons to student scholarships. At-risk students would
then receive bigger scholarships than the others, making them
attractive clients to all schools -- and stimulating the
emergence of new specialty schools.</p>
<p>Each student will be free to attend any public school in
the state, with the scholarship -- consisting of federal,
state and local contributions -- flowing to the school of
choice. Most students will probably choose schools close to
home, but districts will have no claim on their own
residents. To the extent that tax revenues allow, every
effort will be made to provide transportation for those who
need it, especially the poor and those in rural areas.</p>
<p>To assist parents and students in choosing among schools,
the state will provide a Parent Information Center within
each local Choice Office. This center will collect
comprehensive information on each school in the district, and
distribute and collect applications. Its liaisons will meet
with parents to help them judge which schools best meet their
children's needs.</p>
<p>Schools will make their own admissions decisions, subject
only to nondiscrimination requirements. This step is
absolutely crucial. Schools must be able to define their own
missions and build their own programs, and they cannot do
that if their students are thrust on them by outsiders. They
must be free to admit as many or as few students as they
want, based on whatever criteria they think relevant.</p>
<p>Schools will set their own "tuitions." They may choose to
do so explicitly, say, by publicly announcing the minimum
scholarship they are willing to accept. They may also do it
implicitly by allowing anyone to apply for admission and
simply making selections, knowing in advance what each
applicant's scholarship amount is. In either case, schools
are free to admit students with different-sized scholarships
and to keep the entire scholarship that accompanies each
student they admit. That gives schools incentives to attract
students with special needs, since these children have the
largest scholarships.</p>
<p>While it is important to give parents and students as much
flexibility as possible, we think it unwise to let them
supplement their scholarships with personal funds. Such
add-ons threaten to produce too many inequalities within the
system, and many citizens would regard them as unfair.</p>
<p>The application process must guarantee each student a
school, as well as a fair shot at getting into the school he
most wants. We suggest the following. The Parent Information
Center will be responsible for seeing that applications are
submitted by a given date. Schools will then be required to
make their admissions decisions within a set time, and
students who are accepted into more than one school will be
required to select one. Students who are not accepted
anywhere, as well as schools that have yet to attract enough
students, will participate in a second round of applications,
after which unaccepted students (there should be few) will be
assigned to schools by the Choice Office.</p>
<p>The state must grant each school sole authority to set its
own governing structure. A school may be run entirely by
teachers or even a union; may vest all power in a principal;
may be built around a committee that guarantees
representation to the principal, teachers, parents, students
and community members. Or it may do something completely
different.</p>
<p>The state will also do nothing to tell the schools how
they must be internally organized. It will not set
requirements for career ladders, advisory committees,
textbook selection, in-service training, preparation time,
homework, or anything else.</p>
<p>Statewide tenure laws will be eliminated, allowing each
school to decide for itself whether to adopt a tenure policy
and what the specifics will be. This change is essential if
schools are to have the flexibility to build well-functioning
teams of professionals. Some schools may rely solely on pay
and working conditions to attract teachers, while others may
offer tenure as a means of compensating and retaining their
best teachers.</p>
<p>Teachers will continue to have a right to join unions and
engage in collective bargaining, but the bargaining unit will
be the individual school or, as in the case of the district
government, the organization that runs the school.</p>
<p>The state will continue to certify teachers, but
requirements will be minimal. Individuals should be certified
to teach if they have a bachelor's degree and if their
personal history reveals no obvious problems. Whether they
are good teachers will be determined in practice, as schools
decide whom to hire, observe their own teachers in action,
and make decisions about merit, promotion and dismissal.</p>
<p>The state will hold the schools accountable for meeting
the criteria set out in their charters, for adhering to
nondiscrimination laws, and for making available to the
public, through the Parent Information Center, information on
their mission, their staff and course offerings, standardized
test scores (which we would make optional), parent and
student satisfaction, and anything else that would promote
informed educational choice.</p>
<p>The state will not hold the schools accountable for
student achievement or other dimensions that call for
assessments of the quality of school performance. When it
comes to performance, schools will be held accountable from
below, by parents and students who directly experience their
services and are free to choose.</p>
<p>These changes have nothing to do with "privatizing" the
nation's schools. The choice system we outline would be a
truly public system -- and a democratic one.</p>
<p>Nothing in the concept of democracy requires that schools
be subject to direct control by school boards,
superintendents, central offices, departments of education,
and other arms of government. Nor does anything in the
concept of public education require that schools be governed
in this way. There are many paths to democracy and public
education. The path America has long been treading is
exacting a heavy price -- one the nation and its children can
ill afford to bear, and need not.</p>
