	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stock and bond prices, after a brief surge in
early trading, declined under pressure from investors taking
profits after two sessions of strong gains.
   Bond prices rose sharply on news that Saudi Arabia was
cutting oil prices. But a wave of profit-taking quickly
followed, fueled by news of stronger-than-expected car sales
in late May, a rebound in oil prices as the day wore on, and
an increase in commodity prices.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated 10.19 points to
finish at 2925.00 in brisk trading. Long-term U.S. Treasury
bond prices fell more than a 1/4 point, or more than $2.50
for each $1,000 of face amount, in moderate trading. The
dollar was narrowly mixed against major currencies as traders
hunted vainly for market-moving news.</p>
<p>"Stocks took their cue from bonds, and in both cases you
had profit-taking," said Jack Solomon, market technician at
Bear Stearns. Helping buoy both markets lately was the
widening perception that lower interest rates are inevitable
because economic growth is weakening and inflation seems to
be reined in. But when expectations of lower interest rates
becomes a topic of household conversations, he said, "you
know we're going to get a correction."</p>
<p>Later, in fact, the prospect of the Federal Reserve Board
lowering rates any time soon dimmed with Fed Gov. Edward
Kelley's comment that he is comfortable with the current
"moderately restrictive" monetary policy. Without the
immediate threat of recession, the Fed is likely to hold to
its policy, aimed at keeping inflation under control.</p>
<p>Mr. Kelley's comments, combined with news indicating
economic strength and higher prices, was "enough bad news to
justify some profit-taking," said Philip Braverman, chief
economist at DKB Securities Corp. "If you've got it there,
you want to make sure it doesn't disappear on you."</p>
<p>Technology stocks that helped spark the market's most
recent run-up were being sold yesterday, noted Joseph
Feshbach, director of technical market analysis at Shearson
Lehman Hutton.</p>
<p>But some investors were taking advantage of the selling to
get into the market. Andrew Riley, head of U.S. equity
research at Yamaichi International, said he noticed a pickup
in Japanese buying of U.S. stocks yesterday.</p>
<p>In major market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices fell in heavy trading, with 199.7 million
shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange.
Declining issues outnumbered advancers, 813 to 774.</p>
<p>Bond prices fell. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond edged up to 8.45%.</p>
<p>The dollar ended mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.6850 marks and 152.45 yen, compared
with 1.6855 marks and 152.40 yen Monday.</p>
