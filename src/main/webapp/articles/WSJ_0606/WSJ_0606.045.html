	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A lawsuit was filed on behalf of bondholders
of two of Donald Trump's casinos, accusing the developer of a
breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the opening of
his Taj Mahal casino.
   The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges
that Mr. Trump's promotion of the $1 billion Atlantic City,
N.J., casino hurt the performance of his Trump Plaza and
Trump's Castle properties.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The lawsuit claims Mr. Trump violated Securities and
Exchange Commission requirements by not disclosing that he
gave the Taj Mahal confidential information about the two
casinos' clients.</p>
<p>"In order to pay the interest on these bonds, you need
cash flow and for cash flow you need the high rollers," said
Edward Labaton, an attorney for the plaintiff, Peter
Stuyvesant Ltd.</p>
<p>Mr. Labaton said the plaintiff seeks class-action status
on behalf of all affected bondholders.</p>
<p>The lawsuit seeks a court order requiring Mr. Trump to
sell his interests in Trump's Castle and Trump Plaza if he
continues to use the confidential information to benefit the
Taj Mahal.</p>
<p>Since the Taj Mahal opened in April, revenues at the two
properties have fallen by as much as 25% from the year
before. For the month of May, however, Trump Plaza revenue
rose about 24%, though that result is said to have been
distorted by a single baccarat player's loss of $10 million.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Mr. Trump declined to comment.</p>
<p>The lawsuit said bondholders were assured that the value
of their securities would not be hurt by Mr. Trump's opening
of Taj Mahal.</p>
<p>On Monday, this newspaper reported that Mr. Trump was in
intense discussions with his bank creditors to restructure
his $2 billion in bank debt. Apparently as a result, the
casinos' bond prices plummeted, raising speculation that Mr.
Trump would not be able to make interest payments. Trump
Castle Funding's 13 3/4% bonds, maturing in 1997, declined 2
1/2 points to end at 58 1/2. Trump Plaza Funding bonds
stabilized and finished the session at 81 1/4, up 1/4 point.</p>
<p>Trump Taj Mahal's bonds did not fare much better, falling
2 7/8 points to 54 1/8.</p>
