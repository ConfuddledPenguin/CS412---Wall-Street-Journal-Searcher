	<p class="article-leader">As a recently retired member of the National Council on
the Arts who has participated in council meetings with Helen
Frankenthaler, I am greatly disturbed by your May 21
editorial "Controversy vs. Quality" and by your reference to
Ms. Frankenthaler's New York Times op-ed piece last July.
   Ms. Frankenthaler as an artist speaks for herself. Her
comments about the quality of the grants and panels have been
intemperate and insidious at a moment when the National
Endowment for the Arts is under siege. She has been quoted in
a Times magazine article as saying, "Sometimes I wish I had
more people to relate to and refer to and talk to, but there
are very few artists whose work I want to see. . . ." Her
interest in young artists, contemporary artists, contemporary
issues, in my opinion and observation, is limited at best.
This to the point of having said at one council meeting words
to the effect that, who can be bothered to visit all those
galleries in SoHo, as a way of dismissing the new, the young,
the untested. To those with an interest in the world of the
visual arts it is analogous to an academician stating he
could not be bothered to visit the Montparnasse of 1908 or
the Montmartre of 1925.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The fellowship grants and attendant peer panel review
system at the NEA have been supportive and courageous. They
have funded the difficult where others feared to tread. The
peer panel review system has guaranteed connoisseurship and
competence and it has responded in a meaningful and
supportive way to artists the length and breadth of the
nation.</p>
<p>Of course there will be both mistakes and controversy. One
must sympathize with those who are deeply offended by certain
works of art. Nonetheless, to cite these isolated examples
and to mix in some glib perjoratives such as "fashion" and
"chic" to besmirch one of the few support systems our
government has to assist the individual artist is unfortunate
in the extreme. It gives ammunition to those who wish to
extinguish, cut back or change the way the NEA goes about its
business of assisting artists and art institutions, which it
has done well and effectively on very little of the
taxpayer's money. Its budget is about $175 million a year,
not even the cost of a single, minor-league S&L bailout.</p>
