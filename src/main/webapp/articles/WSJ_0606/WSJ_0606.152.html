	<p class="article-leader">IRVINE, Calif. -- Fluor Corp. said that its Fluor Daniel
G.m.b.H. West German unit signed a letter of intent with
Ingenieurbetrieb Anlagenbau Leipzig (IAL) to jointly pursue
hydrocarbon, industrial, and other projects in East Germany
and other East European countries.
   A Fluor spokeswoman said the company was already
negotiating two "small" contracts with IAL, the largest East
German engineering and construction-services company. The
Fluor spokeswoman said the company has had a West German
office for 30 years. The current letter of intent, she said,
"is a first step, a good way to gain experience in a new
market."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Separately, Fluor reported that earnings in the
second-quarter ended April 30 jumped 59% to $38 million, or
47 cents a share, compared with $23.9 million, or 30 cents a
year ago on fewer shares outstanding. Revenues for the
quarter climbed 12% to $1.83 billion, from last year's $1.63
billion.</p>
<p>For the six months ended April 30, the engineering,
construction, and technical services company reported that
net income rose 45% to $66.2 million, or 82 cents a share,
compared with $45.5 million, or 57 cents a share. Revenues
rose 21% to $3.71 billion, compared with $3.05 billion a year
ago.</p>
<p>The spokeswoman said the main reason for the sharp rise in
net income was a $19 million, or 23 cents a share, reversal
of tax reserves no longer required.</p>
