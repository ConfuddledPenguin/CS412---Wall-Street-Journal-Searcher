	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- The federal government charged three
Southern California travel agents with fraudulently taking
advantage of American Airlines' frequent-flier program.
   According to U.S. Attorney Robert L. Brosio, a 22-count
indictment alleged that the three agents created a list of
more than 50 fictitious passengers between 1986 and 1988,
then tampered with American's computer-system records by
crediting the fake travelers with miles that had been flown
by real people who weren't members of the airline's
AAdvantage program.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>An American spokeswoman claimed without elaborating that a
"significant" number of miles were involved. She said the
unit of Dallas-based AMR Corp. uncovered the alleged scheme
during a mid-flight cross-check of passenger names against
the names on checked baggage. It forwarded the case to the
Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
<p>The indictment charges James Robert Winkleman and Phillip
Ross Rinker of Woodland Hills, owners and operators of North
Ranch Travel agency, and Brenton Neil Mullins, of Playa Del
Rey, with conspiracy, wire and mail fraud and illegally using
fictitious names.</p>
<p>Howard Cole, an attorney for Mr. Rinker, said he
"emphatically denies" any wrongdoing by his client. Attorneys
for Messrs. Mullins and Winkleman couldn't be reached.</p>
