reinsurance contract covering investments by General Electric
Co. in an electric lightbulb manufacturing venture in
Hungary.
   The Overseas Private Investment Corp., a U.S. government
agency, previously authorized $130 million in investment
insurance guarantees for the project. The World Bank agency,
in effect, will assume $30 million of the OPIC risk. Covered
risks include possible losses arising from currency transfers
and expropriation.</p>
