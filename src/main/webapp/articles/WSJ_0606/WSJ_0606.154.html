	<p class="article-leader">TAX TREATIES move to center stage. Backers hope no drama
will develop.
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee tentatively plans a
hearing June 14 on six long-awaited pacts negotiated by the
Treasury and backed on behalf of business generally by the
National Foreign Trade Council. Those with West Germany,
India, and Spain are especially notable in U.S. efforts to
eliminate double taxation of overseas income. Treaties with
Finland, Indonesia, and Tunisia also are up for Senate
ratification.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In such pacts, the U.S. government acts to protect U.S.
businesses, notes Robert T. Cole, a Washington lawyer and
trade-council member. The Treasury now is engaged in several
major negotiations: With Canada, to update the current treaty
in line with a recent free-trade agreement. With Mexico, for
an initial pact that could be a model for Latin America. With
the Netherlands, to halt abuses of the current pact by
nationals of non-treaty nations. With the Soviet Union, to
aid investment there.</p>
<p>The Treasury says it has active negotiations with 19
countries and plans talks with seven more.</p>
<p>TREATIES WITH GERMANY and India resolve talks stretching
back decades.</p>
<p>Treasury aides say the successor to the 1954 treaty with
Germany should serve in many ways as the U.S.'s model for
agreements with developed nations. But a unique arbitration
feature is included just as a test. "We want to see how it
works before we put it in another treaty," says a Treasury
official. The clause allows for binding arbitration in a tax
dispute if both countries and the taxpayer agree. It's an
"excellent" innovation, Washington lawyer Cole says.</p>
<p>It took nearly 30 years to negotiate the U.S.'s first tax
pact with India. The terms aren't as favorable as those the
U.S. has with developed countries; but they are improvements
in most respects from nontreaty taxation, the Treasury says,
after major concessions by both sides. The treaty with Spain,
the U.S.'s first, is expected to enhance U.S. investment in
that fast-growing European-common-market economy.</p>
<p>BUT HAPPY ENDINGS aren't guaranteed for treaties or
taxpayers.</p>
<p>Shipping-container lessors contend the Treasury let them
down. Charles Tingley, president of Transamerica Leasing and
of the Institute of International Container Lessors, a trade
group, plans to testify against provisions that let India and
Indonesia withhold 10% taxes on lease fees leaving their
shores. Most pacts treat containers like ship and air
transport-taxable only at home. Many treaty backers fret that
this attack could hold up the eagerly awaited benefits of the
two treaties.</p>
<p>Also, while it isn't clear just how big the issue is,
Germany has held up its ratification proceedings to emphasize
its concern about a 1988 U.S. estate-tax law. The law denies
the full marital exemption to surviving spouses who aren't
U.S. citizens. Germany and the Treasury have exchanged notes
on the issue.</p>
<p>Opposition has faded in the U.S. to ratification of a
seventh treaty under which the U.S. would share tax data with
several European countries.</p>
<p>A MILLION FILERS, including those who report business
income on personal returns, won't have to file Form 4562 for
depreciation of business assets next year. Research Institute
of America reports the IRS plans to drop the use of Form 4562
for certain assets of noncorporate taxpayers. Depreciation
still will have to be figured and reported on returns, of
course.</p>
<p>CORDLESS PHONES can trip you up. IRS investigators must
get search warrants to intercept conversations carried wholly
or in part by phone wires -- but not to listen to radio
transmissions. Thus, the investigators' manual now notes,
they don't need warrants to spy on transmissions between a
cordless phone and its base unit.</p>
<p>TAXPAYER MOVEMENTS are alive and growing, the National
Taxpayers Union declares. It says initiatives to restrict or
control state and local taxes or spending will be or are
"very likely" to be on 1990 ballots in California, Colorado,
Illinois, Massachusetts, Nebraska, Nevada, Oregon, and Utah.</p>
<p>NEXT MONEY LAUNDERER: Step up and give the teller your
real name.</p>
<p>In the war on money laundering and tax evasion, a 1988 law
requires financial institutions to verify and record the
identity of anyone buying bank, cashier's, or traveler's
checks or money orders for $3,000 or more in cash. The
Treasury has issued final rules, effective Aug. 13, telling
banks and others how to keep logs of these transactions for
Treasury perusal.</p>
<p>If the buyer has an account, the bank must verify that and
log the name, account number, and details of the purchase. If
the buyer has no account, he must show a document (such as a
driving license) with his address and also supply for logging
his Social Security or alien ID number, birth date, and other
data and identify anyone for whom he is acting. A customer
who doesn't provide the information must not be served. Banks
are to watch for and log multiple purchases totaling $3,000
on the same day.</p>
<p>Know your customers, the Treasury advises banks, and
report suspicious purchases or actions.</p>
<p>BRIEFS: The IRS will promote electronic return filing at a
conference and exhibition for preparers, technology vendors,
and others July 25 and 26 in Dallas. . . . Vermont's amnesty
waiver of penalties for tax delinquents will end June 25.</p>
