	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Home Savings of America, the principal
subsidiary of H.F. Ahmanson & Co., said it sold $250 million
in subordinated debt. The seven-year notes were priced at
99.7% of face value, yielding 10.56%, the company said.
   The proceeds from the sale bring Home Savings' total
risk-based capital ratio, or the ratio of capital to a
calculation of assets adjusted to reflect their relative
risk, to 8.3%, well above the 6.4% required by regulators,
the company said. The lead underwriter for the offering is
Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.</p>
