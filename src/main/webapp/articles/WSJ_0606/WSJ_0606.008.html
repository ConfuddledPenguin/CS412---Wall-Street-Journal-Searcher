	<p class="article-leader">A new study bolstered the suspected link between colon
cancer and the saturated fat in meats and dairy products.
   The study found that Chinese who developed colon or rectal
cancer had consumed higher amounts of saturated animal fat
than Chinese of comparable age who didn't have the cancer.
The link was strongest among Chinese who had migrated to the
U.S. or Canada and had begun to adopt a Western diet. But it
also was evident among Chinese living in two cities in China.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Previous studies, mostly involving Caucasians, have
implicated high-fat diets in colon and rectal cancer. The new
study narrows the link to saturated fats, particularly the
saturated fats in meat and dairy products.</p>
<p>The new study, a collaboration of researchers in China,
the U.S. and Canada, was undertaken to find out why the rate
of colon and rectal cancer among Chinese Americans is four to
seven times higher than it is among the population in China.
A related mystery is why the rate is markedly higher among
Chinese American men than among Chinese American women.</p>
<p>To find out, research teams in Los Angeles, San Francisco
and Vancouver, British Columbia, did a controlled study among
Chinese Americans while a Chinese research team did an
identical study among residents of the cities of Hangzhou and
Ningbo in eastern China. On both continents the researchers
took dietary and social histories of patients with colon or
rectal cancer and compared them with similar histories of
cancer-free volunteers who were of the same age and lived in
the same area as the cancer patients.</p>
<p>Statistical analyses "supported the conclusion that
saturated fat was the most important dietary correlate of
colorectal cancer risk," Alice S. Whittemore and her Chinese,
Canadian and American colleagues reported in this week's
issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. Ms.
Whittemore is a biomathematician at Stanford University
medical school in Stanford, Calif.</p>
<p>Animal fats such as butter and the fat on beef and pork
are relatively high in saturated fat, which makes them solid
at room temperature. Vegetable fats, like soybean and corn
oils, are relatively low in saturated fat and are usually
liquid at room temperature.</p>
<p>On both continents, the more calories of saturated fat a
person consumed the more likely he or she was to have colon
or rectal cancer. No such link could be found for unsaturated
fats, proteins or carbohydrates, the researchers reported.</p>
<p>But the link of colon cancer with saturated fat was most
striking among Chinese Americans. A difference of 100
calories of saturated fat in the daily diet almost doubled
the risk of colon cancer for Chinese Americans, whereas it
raised the risk for Chinese in China by 20% or less. This is
about the amount of saturated fat contained in 12 ounces of
sirloin steak, two ounces of hamburger meat or two ounces of
American cheese.</p>
<p>This last finding prompted the researchers to check the
sources of saturated fats in the diets on both continents. In
the U.S. and Canada, the Chinese immigrants got 44% of their
saturated fat from meats and 19% from dairy products with the
rest coming from cooking fats. In China, only 30% of the
saturated fat calories came from meats and only 7% from dairy
products. "Thus, the stronger association {with cancer} for
saturated fat noted in North America could reflect the
greater contributions from meat and dairy products to diet on
this continent," the scientists said.</p>
<p>The colon cancer risk increased the longer a person had
lived in North America. Among those who had immigrated to
North America, the men had lived in the U.S. or Canada four
to 10 years longer than the Chinese women who had immigrated.
This longer exposure to Westernized diets may explain why the
colon cancer rate is higher among Chinese American men than
among Chinese American women, the scientists suggested.</p>
