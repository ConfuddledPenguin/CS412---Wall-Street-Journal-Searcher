	<p class="article-leader">Saudi Arabia moved to damp speculation it is launching an
oil-price war after the kingdom's new discounts triggered a
sell-off in world petroleum markets.
   In a government statement released in Riyadh and
Washington, Hisham Nazer, the oil minister, reaffirmed Saudi
Arabia's commitment to the May 2 agreement by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to reduce total
OPEC output by nearly 1.5 million barrels a day.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The kingdom "promised at the May OPEC meeting to abide by
its quota" of 5.4 million barrels a day, Mr. Nazer said. "It
is still committed to what it promised."</p>
<p>But before the statement was issued, a near collapse of
oil prices followed published reports confirming discounts
that had been widely rumored for Saudi pricing formulas.
According to Dow Jones International Petroleum Report, the
planned discounts will range between 25 cents and 70 cents a
barrel.</p>
<p>In most areas, prices of crude oil were down 50 cents to
60 cents a barrel before the Saudi statement was issued. The
statement helped calm jittery oil markets some, and prices
recovered slightly.</p>
<p>Still, on London's International Petroleum Exchange,
Brent-blend crude futures settled 23 cents to 34 cents a
barrel lower. In the U.S. futures market, prices of fuels in
the energy complex were all sharply lower. Some reached
life-of-contract lows before recovering.</p>
<p>The July contract for crude oil traded on the New York
Mercantile Exchange fell through the technically important
level of $17 a barrel to a low of $16.42 before rebounding
some. It settled at $16.68 a barrel, down 46 cents for the
day. The August crude contract fell 38 cents, to $17.39.</p>
<p>Some oil-market participants jumped to the conclusion that
the Saudi price discounts were a prelude to a pricing war
such as the one the kingdom launched in 1986. It was said
that the Saudis were running out of patience with those OPEC
members continuing to produce beyond their quotas.</p>
<p>But there were indications that the discounts may have
been needed to keep Saudi crudes competitive in the current
pricing environment with the big overhang of crude supplies
in inventories or at sea in tankers. "The Saudi oil
authorities view their price moves as defensive and needed to
prevent volumes falling below quota," reported the
London-based Energy Compass.</p>
<p>In his statement, Mr. Nazer made clear that the kingdom
only promised at the May OPEC meeting to remain within its
production quota. Since "Saudi Arabia has not pledged other
than that," he said, "it will be a baseless conclusion to
link the kingdom's commitment with the changing market
forces."</p>
<p>Meantime, there were new reports that total OPEC
production is beginning to decline, if only modestly. The
Paris-based International Energy Agency released its monthly
estimate of world oil production showing OPEC's May output at
23.4 million barrels a day, down 400,000 barrels from revised
April figures.</p>
<p>After futures trading closed, the American Petroleum
Institute released its latest weekly U.S. oil statistics. The
API report showed big inventory increases of 2.5 million
barrels in crude oil, 2.3 million barrels in gasoline and 4.1
million barrels in distillates, including heating oil.</p>
<p>The immediate reaction in the cash market was negative,
with U.S. spot prices of crude oil dropping a further 15
cents a barrel. Also late yesterday, some U.S. refiners
reduced their posted field prices for West Texas Intermediate
crude by 50 cents a barrel to $15.75. According to the API
report, however, the nation's imports of petroleum also
declined in the latest week. "That may be an indication
OPEC's production is indeed tapering off," said Nauman
Barakat, first vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton.</p>
<p>In other commodities markets yesterday:</p>
<p>GRAINS and SOYBEANS: The price of the corn futures
contract for July delivery rose 4.5 cents to settle at
$2.7825 a bushel, as rains returned to the Midwest and
traders reasoned that this year's crop yields may be less
than ideal. Farmers have been late planting corn through much
of the Midwest because of soggy spring conditions. Analysts
said the weather needs to be virtually perfect for the rest
of the growing season for yields to be strong. "With all this
moisture and coolness and poor germination, you get shallow
root development," said Richard Loewy, president of
AgResource Co., Chicago. "If the weather is very hot in July,
it could kill off some of the crop," he said. Potential for a
weak crop is being coupled with strong demand for corn
products, analysts said. Corn is a major component of
livestock feed and the nation's cattle herd is expected to
expand this year. For these reasons, "any perception of lower
yield will be explosive on prices" of corn-futures contracts,
Mr. Loewy said.</p>
<p>COPPER: Futures prices rose. The thinly traded spot June
contract, which will expire June 27, advanced 2.90 cents a
pound, to $1.1710, while the most-active July contract was up
1.95 cents, to $1.1310. A price-supporting factor was that
holders of June call options in the London market declared
their intention of exercising their right to buy June futures
contracts, analysts said. In addition, two major U.S. mining
corporations, whose labor contracts expire June 30, have not
yet reached agreements with their unions. The possibility of
production disruptions because of strikes is creating some
uneasiness among traders, one analyst said. Peruvian copper
output during the first four months of this year fell 29%
from the year-earlier period because of strikes; Chile
suffered a loss of some 100,000 tons of refined-copper output
because of various production problems, analysts said. The
July futures price has fallen about 7%, or nine cents a
pound, during the past 3 1/2 weeks. Yesterday's low of
$1.1020 a pound in the July contract was near the key support
level of $1.10, an analyst said. Some demand was triggered at
the low and helped the July price rebound. Another analyst
observed that the $1.10 level was a "crucial one." If the
July price had fallen below it, he said, there likely would
have been a test of $1.05.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices rebounded from recent
weakness, led by platinum. July-delivery platinum rose as
much at $10 an ounce, to $497, before easing to settle at
$492.30, up $5.50. August gold was up $1.20 an ounce at
$363.60. July silver advanced 1.4 cents an ounce, to $5.0960.
"Platinum has been oversold and dragged down by gold and
silver," said Jacques Luben, executive director of the
Platinum Guild International, an industry group. "The belief
among traders is that it shouldn't have fallen as much as it
has, and the low prices attracted renewed demand for bullion
from Japan," he said. This demand, in turn, touched off short
covering, or the purchase of futures contracts that were
previously sold by traders who thought prices were going to
fall further. Stuart Shinbein, senior technical editor for
Commodity Research Bureau, a New York unit of Knight-Ridder,
observed that the lift in platinum, as well as in gold and
silver, was helped by a soft dollar. Further, Mr. Shinbein
said, demand for July platinum-futures contracts appeared
when the price fell to the day's low of $487 an ounce. The
three precious metals, he said, have declined significantly
from November highs. Platinum fell more than 10% from $556 in
that time. It hit a life-of-contract low of $446 in April
before recovering to present levels. July silver suffered a
new low as it dropped 18% from its November high of $6.22.
August gold, in falling 17% from $440 in November, is nearing
the $356-to-$360 area it reached in June and September of
1989. Fred Demler, metals economist for PaineWebber, New
York, noted that South African labor contracts at
precious-metals mines with the National Union of Mineworkers
run out July 1. There has been some unrest and wildcat
walkouts, he said, and as the deadline nears, concern is
going to grow unless agreements are reached.</p>
<p>LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Prices of hogs and pork-belly futures
contracts rose sharply on rumors that the Soviet Union would
use any credit guarantees it might receive from the U.S. to
buy meat, principally pork. As part of the recent summit
between President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev, the U.S. proposed granting the Soviet Union
trade-related credits if it eased emigration restrictions on
Soviet Jews. The proposal is also subject to approval by
Congress. A report released after the end of trading
yesterday showed higher-than-expected movement of frozen pork
bellies from storage. "That shows we're consuming bellies at
a higher than normal rate," said Thomas Morgan, president of
Sterling Research Corp., Arlington Heights, Ill. Pork bellies
are uncured slabs of bacon.</p>
