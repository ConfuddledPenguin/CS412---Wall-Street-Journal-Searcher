	<p class="article-leader">Nevada's utility regulators rejected a power purchase
contract between Nevada Power Co. and SCEcorp's Mission
Energy Co. unit, citing "unreasonably high costs for the
project."
   "The evidence showed that Nevada Power can get a better
deal for ratepayers," said Tom Stephens, chairman of the
Nevada Public Service Commission. "There is a clear need to
adjust the price of this contract."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the proposed contract, Nevada Power would purchase
electricity generated by a new 210-megawatt power plant that
Mission would build on property adjacent to a Nevada Power
station in the east Las Vegas valley. Nevada Power estimates
the plant would cost about $88 million to build, and it has
agreed to buy the electricity for $6.16 per kilowatt per
month.</p>
<p>The commission has given Nevada Power 30 days to either
negotiate a contract price that would be similar to what it
would cost if Nevada Power built the project itself, or
develop an alternative.</p>
<p>Nevada Power plans to renegotiate with Mission, a
spokeswoman said. Officials of SCEcorp, a Rosemead,
Calif.-based utility holding company, weren't available for
comment.</p>
