	<p class="article-leader">The cold-fusion controversy heated up again after a lawyer
representing two chemists who originated claims about the
phenomenon threatened legal action against a scientist who
cast doubt on its existence.
   The threat was contained in a letter sent to physicist
Michael J. Salamon of the University of Utah by a lawyer
representing chemists B. Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann,
who work for a cold-fusion institute affiliated with the
university.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In his letter, the Morganton, N.C., attorney, C. Gary
Triggs, asserted that Mr. Salamon had published a "factually
inaccurate" report on cold fusion that had caused "undue
ridicule and negativism" about the phenomenon. The letter
urged that Mr. Salamon's study on cold fusion "be voluntarily
retracted" and threatened Mr. Salamon with "legal action" to
"protect" the interests of Messrs. Pons and Fleischmann.</p>
<p>The legal threat, perhaps unprecedented in a scientific
debate, provoked outrage in scientific circles. "I view this
with alarm," said Eugen Merzbacher, president of the American
Physical Society, the main U.S. physics association, who
added that the physics group's executive committee will take
up the matter at its next meeting. Added Richard Muller, a
physicist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in
Berkeley, Calif.: "It's intimidation of the worst kind. If
scientists try to suppress findings with lawsuits, the truth
will have no more meaning in science than it does in
politics."</p>
<p>A spokesman for the physics society in Washington, D.C.,
said scientists "are calling in asking if they can contribute
to a legal defense fund" for Mr. Salamon.</p>
<p>Mr. Salamon's paper appeared in the March 29 issue of the
journal Nature. It reported results of experiments performed
to measure neutron emissions from Mr. Pons's cold-fusion
apparatus at the University of Utah. The group didn't find
neutrons that would indicate cold fusion was occurring in the
apparatus -- a finding that many scientists regard as a final
crushing blow to claims that cold fusion exists. The paper
was particularly embarrassing for Messrs. Pons and
Fleischmann because it appeared just before a cold-fusion
conference at the school.</p>
<p>Messrs. Triggs, Pons and Fleischmann couldn't be reached
for comment. Mr. Salamon asserted that their legal threat is
"detestable" and "antithetical to the spirit of free academic
inquiry." He added that he is seeking assurance from the
University of Utah that it will pay his legal costs if
Messrs. Pons and Fleischmann sue him.</p>
<p>Mr. Triggs, reportedly a personal friend of Mr. Pons, has
served as an outside patent counsel for the University of
Utah regarding cold-fusion findings. Joseph Taylor, the
University of Utah's vice president of academic affairs, said
university administrators "were horrified" to learn "we were
continuing to pay Triggs (as a patent consultant) when he was
involved in writing a letter harassing a faculty member." He
added that the university is seeking to sever its ties with
Mr. Triggs, who has received a total of about $68,000 from
the school for his services.</p>
<p>Mr. Taylor said he expects the university to pay Mr.
Salamon's legal fees if he is sued by Messrs. Pons and
Fleischmann.</p>
<p>Partly because of the escalating cold-fusion controversy,
the University of Utah faculty senate this week passed a
motion requesting its governing board to examine whether the
school's president, Chase N. Peterson, should resign. Mr.
Peterson, who has helped promote the school's cold-fusion
research, responded in a statement that the motion "must be
taken seriously" and that he expects to hold discussions
concerning it after the school's commencement this week.</p>
