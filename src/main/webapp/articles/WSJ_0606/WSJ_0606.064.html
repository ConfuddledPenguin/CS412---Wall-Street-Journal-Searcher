	<p class="article-leader">Santangelo's Restaurant in Liverpool, N.Y., is truly a
family business. Sam and Sally Santangelo's eight children
all help out at the Italian eatery.
   That helps explain why Mr. Santangelo is actively opposing
proposed state legislation that would curtail the hours that
children under 18 can work. If the measure passes, the
restaurateur figures he would have to hire outside help to
work late hours. "I don't know where I'll look," he says.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Across the country, small businesses that hire such
teen-agers are facing similar problems as lawmakers in a
growing number of states push child-labor legislation. The
bills are aimed at encouraging teen-age workers -- especially
those 16 and 17 years old -- to punch out earlier in hopes
that they'll spend more time doing schoolwork. Under federal
law, children 14 and 15 years old can't work more than three
hours a day and 18 hours per week, or after 7 p.m. on school
days. The federal restrictions don't apply to teens 16 and
older.</p>
<p>While many states have mulled child-labor-law reform in
recent years, the issue has gained momentum from the U.S.
Labor Department's well-publicized crackdown in March against
child-labor-law abusers. Hundreds of Labor Department
investigators swept into businesses nationwide seeking
evidence of teen-agers working illegally long hours,
operating dangerous equipment and otherwise being forced to
ignore federal regulations protecting them.</p>
<p>"The noise that the Department of Labor made got people
energized about doing something on the local level," says
Mark Alesse, a state lobbyist for the National Federation of
Independent Business, a small-business trade group.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, legislatures in at least six states --
Florida, Hawaii, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina and Ohio
-- are considering limiting working hours for those under 18,
and Tennessee has already passed an act. Besides placing a
curfew on evening work for 16- and 17-year-olds, some states
are debating limiting the total number of hours per week
those teen-agers can work. "There's a real concern that long
work hours have an impact on children's health and their
studies," says Brenda Trolin, a staff member at the National
Conference of State Legislators.</p>
<p>In response to encouragement from educators and
parent-teacher groups, other legislatures are expected to
join the bandwagon, says Ms. Trolin. "They're all starting to
talk about it. By this time next year, there will be a lot
more."</p>
<p>Small businesses expect to feel the effect more than other
concerns because they tend to rely heavily on teen-age
employees. According to an NFIB study, for instance, small
businesses in New York state depend on youths under 18 for
about 20% of their employees.</p>
<p>Finding a solution that would satisfy the interests of
business owners, educators, parents and children won't be
easy. Herve Juris, a professor of human-resources management
at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management,
says building a strong work ethic in children can be equally
as important as instilling good study habits. "This is
certainly not a question of whether or not kids should work,
but a question of how much they should work," Prof. Juris
says.</p>
<p>Tennessee's new law, which takes effect next month, bars
most 16- and 17-year-olds from working on school nights after
10 p.m. The Tennessee law, which had been considered in
previous legislative terms, passed after legislators reached
a compromise allowing students with high grades to work after
10 p.m.</p>
<p>In other states, especially those burdened with rising
high-school dropout rates, the issue has become much more
controversial. In Florida, where the low-paying service
economy depends heavily on teen-age workers and where the
dropout rate is the nation's highest, one survey found
small-business owners "evenly split" over restrictive work
hours.</p>
<p>"There are a lot of mixed feelings in the small-business
community on this issue," says Bill Herle, state NFIB
director. While often depending on teen-age workers,
"small-business owners have a hard time finding skilled
labor, so they recognize the need to reduce the dropout
rate," he says.</p>
<p>The proposed legislation would allow exceptions for
students with economic hardships. But opposing lawmakers
argue that the hardship exemptions, which require approval
from school administrators and parents, could prove faulty.
They contend that poor students whose families need extra
income could be kept off the payrolls.</p>
<p>"Getting the school superintendent and the principal to
look over each exemption won't be easy. When students find a
job, they don't have too much time before they have to accept
it or lose the job offer," says Willie Logan, a Democratic
representative from Opa Locka, a southern Florida town.</p>
<p>Even the legislation's sponsor concedes that snaring
exemption status could be elusive. "Economic hardships will
be difficult to get," says Tom Mims, a Lakeland Democrat.</p>
<p>In New York, tougher battle lines are taking shape.
Organized labor, mindful that limiting teen-age hours would
force businesses to pay higher wages to lure older workers,
is lobbying hard for restricted work hours for 16- and
17-year-olds. Teachers also are backing the proposal, arguing
that many school-age children work too much and don't need
the income. Instead, teachers contend that such students are
sacrificing their school work to buy cars, designer clothes
and other luxury items.</p>
<p>"These kids come to school sleepy, and they don't do their
homework," says George Mayer, a Long Island, New York, high
school teacher and representative of the 5,000-member New
York State United Teachers Union. "Not enough parents are
telling kids that they simply can't have things. Instead,
they're telling them that if they can pay for it, then they
can have it."</p>
<p>Opposing the proposed New York restrictions, which would
set a work limit of four hours a school day and 28 hours a
week on 16- and 17-year-olds, are representatives of many
small businesses. These include the Food and Merchants
Association, which represents 23,000 food retailers, and the
NFIB, which has 32,000 members in the state.</p>
<p>"We think it's a bad bill," says Mr. Alesse, who heads the
NFIB staff in New York. "Taking work time away is no
guarantee that kids will use that time to study."</p>
<p>Ralph Kushner, co-owner of Super Duper grocery stores in
Buffalo, N.Y., says he employed both of his children while
they were in high school and their grades didn't suffer from
the work. "As a parent and as a merchant, I find this to be a
tough dilemma."</p>
<p>Mr. Kushner adds: "We severely doubt whether we can get
18-year-olds or over to fill these jobs. This may mean
cutting back our hours of operation. We've grown to depend on
younger workers."</p>
