	<p class="article-leader">NL Industries Inc., Houston, said its Kronos International
Inc. unit, based in Leverkusen, West Germany, signed a
seven-year term-loan agreement for 1.6 billion marks ($945.6
million), which will be used for debt repayment and other
corporate purposes.
   The specialty chemicals concern, which is controlled by
the Dallas investor Harold C. Simmons, last year used
proceeds from a loan denominated in marks in part to buy
substantial stakes in Lockheed Corp. and Georgia Gulf Corp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>An executive with Mr. Simmons's holding company, Valhi
Inc., said the loan, which matures in June 1997, will
increase NL's cash position by about $200 million, some of
which will be used for NL's new Lake Charles, La., chemical
plant. The proceeds also will be used to repay about $602
million of existing West German mark financing. Kronos
generates about 55% of the company's sales and a substantial
amount of its cash flow.</p>
<p>The bank group is led by Hypobank International S.A. and
Banque Paribas.</p>
