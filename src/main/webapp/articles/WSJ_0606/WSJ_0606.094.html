	<p class="article-leader">Kubota Ltd., a Japanese maker of farm equipment and
ductile iron pipes, announced that despite a 14% gain in net
sales, consolidated pretax profit fell 29% in fiscal 1989 to
31.85 billion yen ($209.3 million) from 45.12 billion yen.
   Net sales rose 14% in the year ended March 31 to 821.88
billion yen from 721.39 billion yen.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Many of the newly consolidated subsidiaries posted strong
sales growth, contributing to the net sales gain.</p>
<p>But operating profit was knocked down 15% by higher sales,
administrative and general expenses, to 36.31 billion yen
from 42.55 billion yen.</p>
<p>Higher depreciation costs, caused by expanded production
facilities, cut into sales income as well, Kubota said.</p>
<p>Net income tumbled 59% to 7.60 billion yen from 18.43
billion yen.</p>
<p>Kubota cited losses from higher interest rates,
foreign-exchange losses and increased costs for starting new
businesses, such as computer-related fields through its
subsidiaries, for the plunge in net.</p>
