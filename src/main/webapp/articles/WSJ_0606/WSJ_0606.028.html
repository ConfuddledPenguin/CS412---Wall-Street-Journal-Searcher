	<p class="article-leader">Your page-one article about the challenges faced by
families and other care givers of Alzheimer's disease victims
("Life With Alzheimer's Is Often the Hardest on Families of
the Sick," May 2) was exceptional. As the son of an
Alzheimer's victim, I know the agony and pain faced by
millions of American families.
   A bipartisan coalition in Congress is introducing
legislation that details the funding increases necessary for
research into Alzheimer's and outreach to its victims. Named
the CARE bill (Comprehensive Alzheimer's Assistance Research
and Education Act), it will authorize $300 million for
research funding in fiscal 1991, more than a twofold increase
in the current funding of $149 million. It also authorizes
family support demonstration projects throughout the country
and federal matching grants for states to develop such
programs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Alzheimer's is nothing new, but comprehensive
authorization legislation with the support of a broad
coalition of policy makers has never been introduced in
Congress. In years past, funding for research and outreach
has been done on a piecemeal basis by the appropriations
committees. The CARE bill will change that, signaling that
the federal government is making Alzheimer's a top priority.</p>

<p>Having lost my husband to this dreadful illness, I am
aware of the tremendous burdens placed upon not only the
patients, but also their families and care givers. It is
distressful to learn that the government's research budget is
only $149 million for this fiscal year. For those involved in
this crusade against the cruelest and most destructive of all
diseases, we find it difficult to understand why the funding
for this type of dementia is still pitifully small.</p>

<p>Your article is outstanding in describing the suffering of
all involved in the care of their destroyed family member.</p>
<p>Very poor federal support is being given to the efforts of
the researchers at the National Institute of Mental Health in
their efforts to find the cause, the cure and ultimately the
prevention of Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>Unmentioned was the continued refusal of the government to
allow fetal-tissue research, which has shown the most
immediate promise for restoring those with Alzheimer's. When
will all of us rise up and insist that this promising line of
research be supported by our government?</p>
