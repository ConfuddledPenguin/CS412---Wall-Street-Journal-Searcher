	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- The chairwoman of Equimark Corp.'s main
banking unit resigned amid increased speculation that the
parent company is preparing to put itself up for sale.
   The departure of Claire Gargalli, one of the nation's
highest-ranking woman bankers, as chairwoman of Equibank
comes one week after the resignation of another top
executive, Judith E. Fellheimer. The moves are part of a
cost-cutting program in which more than 20 middle and senior
managers have been fired, four Philadelphia branch banks have
been sold, and executive perks have been trimmed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The moves have prompted speculation that Equimark's
embattled chairman, Alan S. Fellheimer, who together with his
wife owns 13% of Equimark, is trying to trim the bank to make
it more attractive for sale. The departure of the bank unit's
two most senior executives has also fueled rumors that
Equibank may have unacknowledged problem loans. But in an
interview, Mr. Fellheimer vigorously denied that either the
company was for sale or that the executives were fired.</p>
<p>Wall Street reacted favorably to the news as buyers bid up
the stock on takeover speculation. In New York Stock Exchange
composite trading, Equimark rose 75 cents to $8.625 in heavy
trading.</p>
<p>For his part, Mr. Fellheimer insisted he has no plans to
sell the bank. He contends the recent cost-savings were made
necessary when Equimark's $116 million acquisition of
National Bancshares Corp. of Texas fell through. Equimark,
which has about $3.8 billion in assets, had added staff
assuming that the deal would come to fruition.</p>
<p>Moreover, Mr. Fellheimer said, personnel cuts were needed
because the focus of the bank has changed. With earnings
down, Equimark won't be looking for acquisitions, which have
been a source of growth over the past several years.</p>
<p>Even without diversions, the bank has plenty of problems
at home. The bank had a loss of $15.4 million in the first
quarter and is dogged by rumors that it will have to take
further write-offs this year to cover bad real estate loans,
particularly in the Philadelphia area.</p>
<p>Mr. Fellheimer wouldn't comment on the possibility of more
write-offs or on earnings projections.</p>
<p>The 57-year-old Ms. Gargalli said she walked away from her
job, which paid about $600,000 a year before bonuses, because
she agrees that the company had too many senior executives
for its current size. Her decision to leave clearly surprised
many at the bank. At one department meeting where the
announcement was made, employees gasped when they heard the
news.</p>
<p>Ms. Gargalli, who will receive a severance package, said
the decision to leave Equimark was her own. She worked at the
bank unit since 1984 when federal regulators were threatening
to shut it down, and eventually became Equimark's No. 2
executive. She had held the top post since 1987, and will be
succeeded in that post by James McLaughlin, currently the
bank's president.</p>
<p>Her departure leaves Mr. Fellheimer without two longtime
executives who were instrumental in helping to bring Equimark
back to financial health after he became chairman in 1985.
Nevertheless, he insisted that the changes were necessary.
"I'm doing everything I can to slim down" the company, he
said. "We had no sacred cows."</p>
