	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Abbott Laboratories' ousted chairman, Robert
Schoellhorn, called accusations that he stole from the
company a "fabricated" effort to deny him $3.8 million of
Abbott stock and to ruin his business reputation.
   In a filing in state court here, Mr. Schoellhorn said
Abbott's charges were made "in direct retaliation" for a
lawsuit he filed in March seeking to keep the board of the
pharmaceutical and hospital-product company from removing him
as chairman.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The filing contains Mr. Schoellhorn's most detailed
assertions thus far in what has become an unusually public
battle between a highly profitable company and the man who
ran it successfully for a decade. Neither Mr. Schoellhorn nor
Abbott's directors have said publicly what set off the
bizarre series of accusations.</p>
<p>Abbott's board removed Mr. Schoellhorn as chief executive
officer in December and stripped his remaining post,
chairman, of most of its power. In March, Abbott directors
sought to remove him from that post as well. He sued to stop
them, alleging, among other things, that they improperly
changed the company bylaws.</p>
<p>Mr. Schoellhorn and his attorney, John H. Mathias Jr.,
wouldn't elaborate on the filing, which seeks to add counts
to the existing suit, or discuss the rift with the board. The
filing does, however, mention what Mr. Schoellhorn calls "a
serious breach of confidence" by one or more outside
directors, which he wanted to investigate. The filing doesn't
explain the alleged breach, but asserts that his firing
"pre-empted" any investigation.</p>
<p>North Chicago-based Abbott, after Mr. Schoellhorn's suit,
sought to fire him "for cause," meaning it could withhold
certain benefits. The company alleged that he used its
aircraft for personal matters, submitted false expense
reports, and claimed as his own art objects that were gifts
to Abbott.</p>
<p>Mr. Schoellhorn denied these charges in yesterday's
filing. He said Duane L. Burnham, the former chief financial
officer that the board chose to succeed him, was responsible
for Abbott's aircraft and its accounting records.</p>
<p>"It was Mr. Burnham's job to question and rectify anything
he thought was improper regarding use of company aircraft or
other assets by Abbott executives," Mr. Schoellhorn said in
the filing, adding: "As Mr. Burnham well knows, Mr.
Schoellhorn's use of company aircraft, assets and personnel
have been consistent with normal business practice and
satisfactory to Abbott's internal auditors, external
auditors, Board Audit Committee, and Mr. Burnham himself."</p>
<p>An Abbott spokesman said the company and Mr. Burnham
wouldn't comment.</p>
<p>The art work in question is a painting and an urn, both
gifts from Japanese companies, according to the filing. The
urn was presented to Mr. Schoellhorn and his wife as a
personal gift in their home in Highland Park, Ill., and the
painting hung there for more than three years while he
entertained Abbott executives and directors, according to the
filing. Only after Mr. Schoellhorn's suit was filed in March,
he asserts, did Abbott say he shouldn't have the painting or
the urn.</p>
<p>If the company is allowed by the courts to fire Mr.
Schoellhorn with cause, it could keep 51,600 Abbott common
shares awarded to him under a restricted stock plan. Mr.
Schoellhorn said in the filing that the company has withheld
his dividend on the stock, and refused to issue a like amount
of shares due to him from a 2-for-1 stock split, thereby
diluting his holdings.</p>
<p>Before his suit was filed, Mr. Schoellhorn said he was
assured repeatedly into March 1990 by James Bere, Borg-Warner
Corp. chief executive and chairman of the Abbott board's
compensation committee, that those shares wouldn't be taken
from him.</p>
<p>Mr. Bere couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
