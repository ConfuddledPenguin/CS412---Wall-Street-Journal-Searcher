	<p class="article-leader">Argyll Group PLC, a British food and drink retailer, said
pretax profit for the year ended March 31 rose 27% to #227.5
million ($381.2 million) from #178.7 million a year earlier,
citing big gains from its Safeway supermarket chain --
formerly part of the U.S. chain but now unrelated.
   Profit after taxes but before special items also rose 27%
to #159.2 million from #125.1 million. Per-share earnings
rose 25% to 17.2 pence from 13.8 pence. Profit attributable
to shareholders rose 30% to #163.3 million from #125.1
million, boosted by a #4.1 million gain from proceeds from an
asset sale; the year-earlier period didn't have any special
items.</p>
