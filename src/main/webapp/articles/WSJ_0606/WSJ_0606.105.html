	<p class="article-leader">De La Rue PLC, a U.K. specialty printing group, said it
pulled through a year of restructuring with a 41% rise in
pretax profit, to #38.5 million ($64.7 million) from #27.3
million, and forecast a further rise in earnings in the year
ahead.
   But a #57.3 million extraordinary charge, largely against
the sale and closure of several electronics and printing
technololgy units, led to a loss attributable to shareholders
of #37.6 million for the year ended March 31, compared with a
#2.14 million profit a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales, hit by the disposals, fell 33% to #349 million from
#523 million. Nevertheless, the company said it would
recommend a final dividend of 10 pence (16.8 cents), lifting
the total payout for the year even with the 13.25 pence paid
a year earlier.</p>
<p>During the year, De La Rue disposed of its Crosfield
Electronics printing equipment manufacturer. It also agreed
to sell its Printrak unit and escaped a hostile takeover bid
by Norton Opax PLC.</p>
