	<p class="article-leader">WILMINGTON, Del. -- Du Pont Co. said it developed two
prospective substitutes for Halon fire extinguishants that
don't cause depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer.
   Based on preliminary tests over the past year, the new
bromine-free agents cause "zero to extremely low" ozone
depletion, said Donald P. Dunn, a Du Pont marketing manager.
Halons, which can do severe damage, are being phased out by
international agreements that call for a production freeze by
1992.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Du Pont, a chemicals and energy company, currently sells
about $8 million to $10 million a year of fire
extinguishants. The world-wide market is about $80 million.
Du Pont's new products could be used in aircraft, ships,
computer rooms, museums, hospitals and petroleum-production
facilities, Mr. Dunn said.</p>
<p>Du Pont has invested more than $170 million on research
into alternatives to chlorofluorocarbons and Halons, which
are both substances widely blamed for damaging the ozone
layer. Du Pont is concentrating on substitutes made up of
hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, and hydrochlorofluorocarbons, or
HCFCs.</p>
<p>By excluding the bromine compound, the active agent in
Halon, Du Pont's new products are safer for the environment,
Mr. Dunn said. But he added that they would be two to three
times more expensive, and would require using more volume for
comparable effectiveness.</p>
<p>Du Pont's products will be produced commercially at its
Maitland, Ontario, facility and in small quantities at a
pilot facility in Deepwater, N.J.</p>
<p>Approval of the products are subject to separate
applications and standards testing by the U.S. Army, Air
Force and Navy, as well as the National Fire Protection
Association. Mr. Dunn said the company expects to market the
products commercially beginning in 1995.</p>
<p>Du Pont's main competitors in manufacturing fire
extinguishants are Imperial Chemical Industries PLC in
Britain and Atochem in France as well as Great Lakes Chemical
Co. and several smaller companies in the U.S.</p>
