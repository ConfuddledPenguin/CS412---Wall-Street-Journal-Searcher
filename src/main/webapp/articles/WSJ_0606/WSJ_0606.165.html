	<p class="article-leader">The invest-in-Europe bandwagon is getting a new calliope.
   It's one more sign of the rush to capitalize on the
presumed gold mine of unifying Western Europe and rebuilding
Eastern Europe.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The latest wrinkle comes from New York-based Eurovaleur
Inc., a new money management firm specializing in publicly
traded European stocks. The firm is starting a new venture
headlined by a "star" money manager, Felix Zulauf, a Swiss
who is well known in U.S. investment circles.</p>
<p>But this isn't a solo venture. While Mr. Zulauf, in
Zurich, makes broad asset allocation decisions, such as how
much to invest where, 11 different money managers in as many
countries will run portfolios in 14 European stock markets.</p>
<p>Commerz International Capital Management G.m.b.H., a unit
of Commerzbank AG of West Germany, will evaluate and
supervise the country managers. To maintain independence, the
West German bank doesn't hold a stake in Eurovaleur.</p>
<p>"It's a unique way for Americans and Asians to invest in
European equities," said Mr. Zulauf, who is resigning as
chief investment officer of Zurich-based Clariden Bank, a
unit of Credit Suisse Holdings S.A. "You don't have to go to
10 or 15 individual countries or managers."</p>
<p>U.S., Japanese and other Asian money invested in multiple
European markets is usually managed from a major money center
such as New York or London. But Mr. Zulauf and his partners
at Eurovaleur contend this technique is faulty.</p>
<p>"An American operating out of the U.S. or London talks to
brokers in individual countries," he said. "Brokers' first
interest is in volume, turnover, and not good, long-term
performance." Moreover, the American "has to compete in each
market with a professional domiciled in that market who knows
the market inside and out," he said.</p>
<p>A minimum investment with Eurovaleur is $5 million;
investing $20 million wins the right to have the funds
independently managed. Participation is restricted to
institutional investors.</p>
<p>European markets have been attractive, especially because
of the weak dollar, euphoria surrounding the planned 1992
abolition of trade and investment barriers among the 12
countries of the European Community, and the recent collapse
of communist regimes in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>In the five years to May 31, Morgan Stanley Capital
International's Europe index rose 200.3% in dollar terms. In
the same period, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose
118.69%. The two European markets that posted the biggest
gains in those five years were Sweden, up 396.1% in dollar
terms, and Austria, up 382%.</p>
<p>In the first five months of this year, the Europe index
climbed only 2.8% vs. the Dow's 4.48% increase. But the
Austrian market has climbed a hefty 24.1% and the Norwegian
market 22.1%.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Sonja Kohn, Eurovaleur's president, who also
remains president of Windsor I.B.C., a privately held New
York broker-dealer that specializes in European business,
said that investing in Europe can be tricky. "To really know
what's going on in Europe, you've got to be part of the
establishment," she said. Compared with the U.S., "There is
less regulation, the flow of information is different, there
are no Chinese walls between investment banking and brokers."</p>
<p>For example, she said, the Swiss pharmaceutical giant F.
Hoffmann-La Roche & Co. carries its real estate holdings --
valued at as much as an estimated three billion Swiss francs
($2.09 billion) -- on its books at one franc (70 cents). "You
can't sit in New York and London and expect to understand
what's going on," she declared.</p>
<p>The emphasis at Eurovaleur will be on performance. Daily,
Commerzbank and Mr. Zulauf will be able to judge how well the
11 country managers -- each has outpaced his domestic market
over the past five years -- is doing, Mrs. Kohn said.</p>
<p>A U.S. investor can't afford to ignore European markets,
Mr. Zulauf said. "You have a lot of momentum going on 1992,
and Eastern Europe should extend that momentum," he said.
"The greater Germany will be on a major fiscal expansion
program for the next couple of years," and the demand created
by that spending "will spill over throughout Europe," he
predicted. What's more, "The long-term theme is capital
goods," Mr. Zulauf said, noting that West Germany is "the
major capital goods producer in the world."</p>
