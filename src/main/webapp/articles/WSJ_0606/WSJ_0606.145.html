	<p class="article-leader">BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- Qintex Entertainment Inc., which
last October filed for bankruptcy-law protection, said its
board approved the sale of operating assets for more than $65
million. The company is a unit of Qintex Ltd.
   According to a Qintex spokesman, the debt outstanding of
the company as of Oct. 31 totaled $91.8 million. The company
said funds from the asset sales will be allocated to
creditors in accordance with the reorganization plan to be
filed with the bankruptcy court.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Qintex, which produces and distributes filmed
entertainment products, said it agreed to sell its
entertainment assets for $42.4 million to RHI Entertainment
Inc., a private, New York-based television production
company. The sale includes the company's library, accounts
receivable, development projects and $7 million cash, Qintex
said. The Qintex spokesman said RHI's owners include Robert
Halmi Sr., a Qintex co-chairman of the board.</p>
<p>Qintex said HR Broadcasting Inc., a private owner and
operator of independent television stations, of which Qintex
has an interest in the form of notes and convertible
debentures, will sell some assets. Qintex said as a result,
it would receive at least $23 million from HR Broadcasting's
sale to ABRY Communications, a Boston-based private owner of
independent television stations.</p>
<p>The sale includes television stations WTTO in Birmingham,
Ala., and WCGV in Milwaukee.</p>
<p>Qintex Entertainment is 43%-owned by Qintex Australia, a
unit of Qintex Ltd., based in Brisbane, Australia. Both sales
are subject to, among other things, regulatory approvals and
approval of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.</p>
