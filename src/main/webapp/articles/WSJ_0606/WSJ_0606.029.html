	<p class="article-leader">UNITED MEDICORP Inc. said it registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission to offer 2.5 million
common shares. The Dallas-based medical insurance claims
processing company said it expects the offer to take place
after its planned 1-for-2 reverse stock split, which will be
paid June 21 to stock of record on the same date. After the
split, the company will have about 10.7 million common shares
outstanding. Proceeds from the offering will be used to repay
short-term debt, expand marketing efforts and increase the
company's operations. Eppler, Guerin & Turner Inc. of Dallas
is managing the underwriting.</p>
