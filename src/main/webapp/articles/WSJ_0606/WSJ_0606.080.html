	<p class="article-leader">BASF AG said it agreed to buy the bulk of Agfa-Gaevert
AG's consumer and professional audio/visual-tape cassette
business for a sum it didn't disclose.
   The Frankfurt, West Germany, chemical group said that it
expects to sign a letter of intent for the Agfa purchase
today and that the companies will complete details as soon as
possible.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Agfa is a unit of the West German chemical company Bayer
AG.</p>
<p>BASF said it agreed to buy both the consumer and
professional videotape cassette lines of Agfa but only the
professional audiotape line. The consumer audiotape
operations did not interest BASF.</p>
<p>BASF, among the world's largest producers of consumer and
professional tapes, has 1.6 billion marks of annual sales,
which represents about 13.5% of BASF's 11.89 billion marks of
world-wide group sales last year.</p>
