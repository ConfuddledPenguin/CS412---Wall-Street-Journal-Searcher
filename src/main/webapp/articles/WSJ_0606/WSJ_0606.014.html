	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The dollar was mixed as the market concerned
itself primarily with the potential impact of future
political and economic developments.
   The dollar was slightly higher against the yen and lower
against the mark and the pound in trading inspired mainly by
technical considerations amid a dearth of market-moving news,
participants said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The market is waiting for next week's release of May U.S.
inflation indicators, for an outcome to negotiations on
Canada's constitutional deadlock and for news on progress of
U.S.-Soviet talks on the military status of a unified
Germany.</p>
<p>In particular, the dollar's failure to reach 1.7000 marks
during European trading led to selling of the U.S. currency
below 1.6900 marks, said Charles Cossentino, a vice president
at Deutsche Genossenschaftsbank in New York.</p>
<p>Mr. Cossentino and others said their outlook for the
dollar against the mark remains bullish, with nervousness
over the domestic economic consequences of unification again
leading the list of factors weighing on the West German
currency.</p>
<p>Traders are seeking signs of a U.S.-Soviet compromise on
the military status of a unified Germany, but the influence
of that factor has waned on the perception that any deal will
be a long time coming and isn't likely to delay unification.</p>
<p>Sterling was broadly higher as participants went to
currencies backed by high interest rates amid a lack of news
to move other exchange-rates aggressively, traders said. In
late afternoon New York trading, the pound was at $1.6870, up
from $1.6810 late Monday.</p>
<p>The U.S. currency rose slightly against its Canadian
counterpart, as market nervousness over the outcome of
negotiations on Quebec's constitutional status negated the
potentially positive factor of high Canadian interest rates,
participants said.</p>
<p>Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and 10 provincial
premiers are conducting talks in a last-ditch attempt to
forge a compromise on the constitutional amendment giving
French-speaking Quebec status as a "distinct society" within
Canada. All 10 provinces must ratify the measure by a
deadline of June 23 for it to become law. Two provinces are
still opposed and leaders are pessimistic about the chances
for a compromise.</p>
<p>Quebec has threatened to secede from Canada if the measure
isn't passed.</p>
<p>In late afternoon New York trading, the dollar was at
1.6850 marks, down from 1.6855 marks late Monday, and at
152.45 yen, up from 152.40.</p>
<p>In Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar was quoted at 152.55 yen
soon after opening at 152.45 yen; it closed at 152.43 yen in
Tokyo on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at
about 1.6835 marks, down from Tuesday's Tokyo close of
1.6884.</p>
<p>Participants said the market is beginning to look beyond
the interest-rate implications of the current attempt to
reduce the huge U.S. budget deficit, focusing instead on the
economic benefits that a lower government debt could bring.</p>
<p>Traders said the shift in focus is creating a more
positive view of the short-term effects of the budget
"summit" between the U.S. administration and Congress. During
past weeks, many in the market said they expect the dollar to
fall on expectations of lower interest rates if a deal is
reached to reduce the budget deficit.</p>
<p>Meetings on the budget deficit in Washington are scheduled
to resume today after a holiday break for Congress last week.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Congress is expected to approve an increase
in the Treasury's $3.12 trillion debt limit sometime in the
next few months, observers said.</p>
<p>Foreign-exchange dealers said they expect greater market
attention on the budget talks in coming weeks because of a
growing awareness of the economic damage that unrestrained
growth in the deficit could cause.</p>
<p>In Europe, the dollar was modestly weaker, although the
day's action was largely defined by technical dealings and
featured dollar moves within previously defined trading
bands. In Tokyo, the dollar drifted lower in quiet dealings.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $359.80 an ounce, up $1.20. Estimated
volume was a light 2.5 million ounces.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was quoted at $359.50 an
ounce.</p>
