	<p class="article-leader">Business schools have some new critics: themselves.
   After two years of study, a top-level panel of business
school deans and others concludes that many M.B.A.s today are
merely number-crunchers, ill-prepared to manage in the
rapidly changing global marketplace.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Warning that business schools risk "professional
irrelevance," the report urges sweeping changes, including a
greater practical focus for teaching and research, more
emphasis on managerial experience in selecting faculty and
tougher prerequisites for student admission.</p>
<p>The report also suggests "new assessment devices" to test
applicants on leadership potential as well as mathematical
and verbal skills. One possible result of the study is a
major overhaul of the Graduate Management Admission Test, the
aptitude test that a record 290,000 business school aspirants
registered to take this past academic year. The study was
commissioned by the group that sponsors the test.</p>
<p>"There is a need for a fundamental rethinking of graduate
management education," the report says. Given the increasing
demographic diversity of the workplace, fast-changing
technologies and the "internationalization" of business, the
report adds, "simply preparing students to solve problems in
traditional ways is insufficient."</p>
<p>Business schools generally agree with the report's
suggestions, and some even say it didn't go far enough. But
they caution that, given current high enrollments and the
healthy demand for M.B.A.s, quick change at most business
schools is unlikely.</p>
<p>Many business leaders and commentators have slammed
business schools in recent years for contributing to
America's economic woes, charging that M.B.A.s aren't
committed to anything but lofty salaries and titles. Many
business schools have responded by pouring more energy and
money into public relations. They have done this partly to
raise money, but also to boost their visibility in the
growing number of nationally published magazine surveys,
which schools have found can greatly influence student
applications.</p>
<p>Business schools must be persuaded that more substantive
changes are needed, the report's authors say. "If we continue
to squabble and worry about who's No. 5 and who's No. 15, we
risk behaving in ways that confirm what our critics have said
about us -- that we're concerned only about ourselves and
with creating a narrow, materialistic perspective about
business," says John W. Rosenblum, dean of the University of
Virginia's Darden School of Business and co-chairman of the
21-member study panel.</p>
<p>The Graduate Management Admission Council, the Los Angeles
research organization that sponsors the GMAT exam, began
circulating the report among the nation's business schools
last week.</p>
<p>The report doesn't list specific courses or topics that
schools should emphasize. But it recommends that each
institution conduct an "honest self-assessment" of its
strengths and resist the temptation to add a jumble of new
courses, as many have done. "More electives on information
systems or international business are not the answer," the
report says. "Neither are more foreign student exchanges or
Outward Bound-type programs."</p>
<p>Most critical, the report says, are courses that stress
"managerial relevance." Contending that teaching and research
on many campuses today suffer from "pedantic sterility," the
report says business school faculty need to spend more time
within companies observing "business practices in action." It
suggests more collaborations between schools and
corporations, and even adjusting faculty selection standards
to value managerial experience among instructors, not just
scholarly credentials.</p>
<p>"We need to create a more real world environment," says
H.J. Zoffer, dean of the University of Pittsburgh's Katz
School of Business and a panel member. With the divisions
between regular and clinical faculty at many business schools
now, he says, "either you've got a practitioner who knows
nothing about scholarship or an egghead who knows nothing
about practice. Those worlds have got to begin merging."</p>
<p>Business schools could also become more effective if they
focused their offerings and considered joining forces with
other institutions, the report says. Many schools on their
own, it notes, are attempting to squeeze more into their
M.B.A. curricula while also training doctoral students and
running growing executive education programs. To lessen the
burden and allow more time to cover advanced topics, the
report says schools should require that entering M.B.A.s know
certain material such as basic economic theory and
fundamental accounting principles before they start.</p>
<p>Schools should also screen entering students more
carefully for such personal qualities as intellectual
curiosity, managerial aptitude, self-awareness, and "concern
for the consequences of one's actions upon others," the
report says. "While these skills can be enhanced in graduate
schools of management, our schools cannot bear the entire
load of developing them."</p>
<p>The report acknowledges that many of the changes it
proposes won't be easy to swallow. For instance, loosening
faculty appointment guidelines will challenge entrenched
practices at many institutions. And, say officials at several
schools not represented on the study panel, broad change is
unlikely so long as interest in business schools remains
strong.</p>
<p>"Anytime you have large numbers of students, you become
fairly complacent," says Jack R. Borsting, dean of the
University of Southern California business school. Mr.
Borsting says a review of his school's programs under way for
the past year is in line with many of the themes raised in
the report, but he laments that the report isn't strong
enough to guarantee change elsewhere. "I think the report
should have stronger language," he says. "People can just
pass over this."</p>
<p>At the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, Jerry
Wind, a professor of marketing who is heading a review of
Wharton's curriculum, agrees that "M.B.A. education has to be
completely reconsidered." But he scoffed at the report's
suggestion that business schools must join forces to ensure
students a complete menu of offerings. "It's absurd. We will
not even consider it."</p>
<p>Mr. Wind adds that many business school faculty are likely
to resist the call for shifting their research to more
"relevant" topics. "Whether they are relevant or not is not
very important to them," he says. He also disagreed with
adding prerequisite business courses for admission. "You may
discourage people from the humanities and sciences from
pursuing an M.B.A.," Mr. Wind says. "That would be terrible."</p>
<p>The Graduate Management Admission Council plans a series
of meetings and other efforts to encourage discussion of the
report and adoption of its proposals. The council is also
beginning a thorough study of the three-hour GMAT exam, which
hasn't undergone a complete revision since its debut in 1956.
William Broesamle, the council's president, says that
significant change in the test might be five to 10 years
away, but that modification is likely.</p>
<p>One change already under consideration, he says, would be
simply adding new written questions to probe "social
interaction" and leadership potential. Another, he adds,
could be transferring the test to a computer format, to gauge
students through their responses to simulated business
situations.</p>
