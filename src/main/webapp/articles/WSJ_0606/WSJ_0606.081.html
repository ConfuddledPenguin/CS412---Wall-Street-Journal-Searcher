	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The stock market's latest move into uncharted
territory was short-lived, as an opening advance gave way to
profit-taking that sent prices lower in active trading.
   Reports that Saudi Arabia had lowered crude-oil contract
prices for July set off a bout of heavy selling among
oil-field services stocks, which paced the market's slide.
Also, the technology sector erased some of its gains over the
past few weeks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had advanced a
total of 4.1% in the five previous sessions since Memorial
Day and had set records in four of them, fell 10.19 to
2925.00.</p>
<p>At the opening, the average rallied to a gain of about 12
points with the help of buying that spilled over from the
market's rally Monday afternoon. The industrial average had
jumped 34.22 points Monday, and nearly all of the gains came
as a result of that advance.</p>
<p>But after the initial rise, the market drifted back into a
narrow trading range and then retreated as market players
moved to take advantage of its recent rally.</p>
<p>"The selling which is coming in," said Paul Hennessey, a
vice president of trading at Boston Co. in Boston, "is
definitely aimed at taking some profits after a big run-up
here."</p>
<p>Broader market measures fared better than the industrial
average, as the profittaking left more of a mark on blue-chip
issues. Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index dropped 0.76 to
366.64, the New York Stock Exchange Index lost 0.28 to 199.93
and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index fell 0.68 to 341.30.</p>
<p>Declining issues edged advancers by about 813 to 774 on
the Big Board, where volume swelled to 199,720,000 shares
from 175,520,000 shares Monday.</p>
<p>"What we're seeing is a little bit of consolidation, which
is totally to be expected. You could see some continuation of
this for the next session or two," said John A. Conlon Jr., a
managing director at Rothschild Inc.</p>
<p>However, traders said buying interest at prices just below
current levels appeared to be widespread, providing an
indication that stocks aren't likely to fall sharply from
their peaks right away. "People with cash positions that are
higher than they would like them to be have been looking for
an opportunity to get into the marketplace," Mr. Hennessey
said.</p>
<p>In the oil-field services sector, Schlumberger plummeted 2
3/4 to 55 3/4 on Big Board composite volume of 1.8 million
shares, Baker Hughes slid 2 to 27 5/8 on 1.7 million shares
and Halliburton tumbled 2 3/4 to 46 1/4 on 1.4 million
shares. In addition, McDermott International eased 1 to 30
1/2 after reporting that its loss from continuing operations
for its fiscal fourth quarter, ended in March, widened from a
year earlier.</p>
<p>Stocks of major oil companies were less affected by the
developments in the oil market, where July crude-oil futures
contracts fell 46 cents a barrel to $16.68 in New York
trading. Exxon closed unchanged at 48 1/4, Chevron was
unchanged at 70 3/8, Texaco fell 5/8 to 59 3/8, Mobil slid
3/8 to 63 1/8, Amoco dropped 3/8 to 52 3/4 and Unocal fell
1/8 to 30.</p>
<p>AMR climbed 1 3/8 to 68 7/8 as two million shares changed
hands. Merrill Lynch raised its second-quarter earnings
estimate for the owner of American Airlines by 25 cents a
share, to $2.40, and reiterated its buy recommendation.</p>
<p>Other airline stocks rallied as well, reflecting
expectations that the drop in oil prices will translate into
lower prices for jet fuel. Delta Air Lines rose 5/8 to 80,
Southwest Airlines gained 3/8 to 26 1/2, USAir Group added
3/8 to 30 1/8 and Alaska Air Group climbed 3/4 to 24 3/8.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, financial issues continued to attract buyers
despite a downturn in the bond market, which gave back early
gains linked to the Saudi reports. Among money-center bank
stocks, Citicorp rose 3/8 to 25 on 2.3 million shares and
BankAmerica added 1/2 to 33 1/8 on 1.9 million shares.
Elsewhere in the sector, Primerica climbed 1 1/8 to 34 3/8,
PNC Financial added 1 to 37 1/2, NCNB went up 1 1/2 to 43 1/2
and Golden West Financial rose 7/8 to 33 1/8.</p>
<p>Philips Industries jumped 3 1/4 to 17 1/4 on 2.5 million
shares. Tomkins PLC of Britain agreed in principle to acquire
the company for $18.50 a share, or $550 million.</p>
<p>Campbell Soup surged 3 3/8 to 60. Three dissident members
of the founding Dorrance family formed a voting trust,
holding 16.5% of the company's common stock, and reaffirmed
their belief that a sale of Campbell Soup would be in the
best interest of its shareholders.</p>
<p>Kellogg surged 3 3/4 to 72. Goldman Sachs put the stock on
its list of recommended issues and raised its second-quarter
earnings estimate by five cents a share, to $1.05. Food
analyst Nomi Ghez told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report
the stock "has been a major laggard" and the company is
"high-quality."</p>
<p>Fluor fell 1 7/8 to 46 7/8 following the release of its
earnings report for the fiscal second quarter, ended April
30. Although its net income for the quarter exceeded
analysts' forecasts, a tax-related gain accounted for about
half its earnings.</p>
<p>Greyhound Dial went down 5/8 to 28 3/8. The company said
it would take a $100 million charge to set up a reserve for
losses tied to Greyhound Lines, which filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy-law protection. Greyhound Dial owns 22.5% of GLI
Holding, which owns the bus company, and leases buses to the
line.</p>
<p>National Intergroup rose 2 1/2 to 17 3/8 after disclosing
that it plans to conclude its restructuring by selling its
Ben Franklin Stores unit and either paying a special dividend
to its shareholders or buying back stock. The company also
said Howard M. Love would step down as chairman and chief
executive officer following completion of the restructuring.</p>
<p>Tribune rose 1 to 44 7/8 after British publisher Robert
Maxwell acknowledged he would be interested in acquiring the
New York Daily News from the company if contract negotiations
with the paper's union reach an impasse.</p>
<p>Morrison Knudsen, scheduled to join the S&P 500 this week,
advanced 1 1/2 to 52 3/4. Stocks added to a major index
typically attract buying upon their inclusion from managers
of index funds, or portfolios designed to mirror the
performance of a selected market measure.</p>
<p>Saatchi & Saatchi gained 3/8 to 5 5/8. In reporting that
first-half pretax profit dropped 29% from the year-earlier
level, the company said it agreed to sell its Hay Group
consulting unit for $80 million to a group including the
unit's managers and institutional investors.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 0.57
to 363.83. Amex volume totaled 13,310,000 shares, compared
with 12,700,000 shares Monday. There were 275 issues
advancing, 326 declining and 231 were unchanged.</p>
<p>Team Inc. gained 7/8 to 17 1/8. The Wall Street Journal
reported in its "Heard on the Street" column that R. Jerry
Falkner, research director at Southeast Research Partners,
favors the company as a possible beneficiary from the
expected passage of the Clean Air Act.</p>
<p>Ecology & Environment rose 1 to 18 1/4. The company
reported that net income for the fiscal third quarter, ended
April 28, more than doubled from a year earlier.</p>
