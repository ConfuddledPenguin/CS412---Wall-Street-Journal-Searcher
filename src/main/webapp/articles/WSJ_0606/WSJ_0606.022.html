	<p class="article-leader">Investors in over-the-counter stocks took profits, pushing
the Nasdaq Composite Index down 1 to 464.61 in heavy trading.
   Volume rose to 173.5 million from 142.2 million Monday, as
declining shares overtook advancing stocks, 1,053 to 968.
Financial and other interest-sensitive issues remained
strong, while technology and industrial stocks weakened.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The next four or five days could be a little bit choppy,"
cautioned Peter Da Puzzo, co-head of world-wide equities for
Shearson Lehman Hutton. "Frankly," he added, the stocks "got
a little bit ahead of themselves. I would think normal
profittaking would occur and the market will catch its
breath."</p>
<p>Buoyed by yesterday's rally, the OTC market opened higher
but quickly faded as large investors sold stocks and
retreated to the sidelines, said Peter Coolidge, senior OTC
trader at Kidder Peabody. However, small investors bought
shares throughout the day at Robinson Humphrey in Atlanta,
according to Robert King, head of OTC trading there.</p>
<p>Shearson's Mr. Da Puzzo and Kidder's Mr. Coolidge said
they expect the market's advance to slow as summer nears.
However, Mr. Da Puzzo said that he doesn't expect the market
to retreat too far or for too long because investors who
think they missed the rally will step in to take advantage of
sliding prices.</p>
<p>Far more pessimistic is Michael Murphy, editor of the
Overpriced Stock Service, San Francisco. Mr. Murphy said in
an interview that on May 11 he advised his clients to put all
their investments into cash and get out of the stock market
entirely.</p>
<p>"To me, this whole market is a bet that a bunch of
politicians are willing to raise taxes and cut spending in an
election year," Mr. Murphy said. "I think it's a terrible
bet," he said, adding that he expects the Dow Jones
Industrial Average to drop to 2,550 "fairly quickly." That
would be a 13% drop from yesterday's close of 2925.</p>
<p>Mr. Murphy, who said he doesn't expect the Federal Reserve
to lower interest rates, sees a number of signs that the
economy is weakening and believes it's too risky to expect
earnings to increase. He said the bigger-profits scenario is
based largely on stronger sales in Europe in the fourth
quarter.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Murphy says smaller stocks aren't as
overvalued as larger stocks, adding that he's selling short
only a few OTC stocks while selling short a number of large,
listed issues. Short sellers borrow shares and sell them,
hoping to profit by replacing them later at lower prices.</p>
<p>Among yesterday's most active issues were three new public
offerings. Shares of Fleer, a Philadelphia maker of baseball
cards and Dubble Bubble bubble gum, closed at 20 1/4 on 2.1
million shares. The initial public offering of 1.7 million
common shares was priced at $15 a share Monday and opened
yesterday at 18.</p>
<p>K-Swiss closed at 22 1/2, up 5, on 1.6 million shares
after an initial public offering at $17.50 for each of 1.45
million common shares; K-Swiss makes athletic shoes.</p>
<p>Gensia Pharmaceuticals closed at 11 1/8, above its initial
offering price of $11 a share. Gensia is a San Diego
developer of pharmaceutical products.</p>
<p>Profit-taking hurt computer-related issues. Apple Computer
dropped 1 1/4 to 39 1/2; Adobe Systems fell 1 to 32 1/4;
Intel lost 1 3/8 to 47 1/8, and Microsoft tumbled 3 5/8 to 73
3/8.</p>
<p>Spectrum Information Technologies added 5/8 to 2 15/16
after the Dallas technology concern said its Spectrum
Cellular unit is in a licensing pact with a maker of laptop
computers, Toshiba America Information Systems, to use
Spectrum's newest generation of cellular-landline modem
technology.</p>
<p>Duty Free International rose 1 1/4 to 31 3/4 on more than
seven times average volume. The Ridgefield, Conn., operator
of dutyfree stores, reported net income for the first quarter
ended April 30 of 18 cents a share, up from 12 cents a year
earlier. Gerald F. Egan, chief financial officer, told Dow
Jones Professional Investor Report that he and John A. Couri,
chief executive officer, are scheduled to appear today at a
Morgan Stanley-sponsored conference on growth stocks.</p>
<p>BEI Electronics extended its gains. The San Francisco
maker of defense systems said Monday it agreed to buy four of
the six divisions of Systron Donner Corp. from Thorn EMI for
$22 million. BEI, which gained 7/8 Monday, rose 1 1/8 to 8
5/8.</p>
<p>SkyWest climbed 1 1/8 to 8 1/4. The St. George, Utah,
regional airline Monday reported net income for the fiscal
year ending March 31 of 91 cents a share, up from 73 cents in
1989.</p>
<p>Timberline Software continued to climb following a
favorable analyst's report about the Beaverton, Ore., maker
of accounting and information-management software. Thomas P.
Cox, Timberline's vice president and chief financial officer,
told DJPIR Monday that a "buy" recommendation appearing in
the current edition of the Financial Research Center Special
Situations Letter, Framingham, Mass., sparked Monday's
two-point rise in the stock. Timberline added 1 1/2 to 14
yesterday.</p>
<p>Central Sprinkler plunged 4 1/2 to 18 1/4 after the
Lansdale, Pa., maker of fire sprinkler systems reported net
income for the second quarter ended April 30 of 24 cents a
share, down from 28 cents a year earlier.</p>
<p>Genus slid 1/2 to 3 3/4. After the market closed, the
Mountain View, Calif., maker of integrated-circuit
manufacturing equipment said that it expects to report a net
loss of 35 to 45 cents a share for the second quarter ending
June 30, compared with net income of two cents a share in the
first quarter. Genus cautioned investors in late March that
earnings would be sluggish in the first half of the year. In
the 1989 second quarter it earned 26 cents a share, including
some nonrecurring items.</p>
<p>Price Co. dropped 2 1/2 to 36 3/4 after Salomon Brothers
analyst Jack D. Seibald cut his investment opinion on the
stock to a "sell" from "hold" and recommended that clients
instead buy shares of Costco Wholesale, DJPIR reported. Mr.
Seibald, who cited continually slowing sales at Price, a San
Diego operator of cash-and-carry membership wholesale clubs,
also shaved his earnings estimates for the company, DJPIR
reported. Shares of Costco, which is based in Kirkland,
Wash., advanced 5/8 to 41 1/8.</p>
