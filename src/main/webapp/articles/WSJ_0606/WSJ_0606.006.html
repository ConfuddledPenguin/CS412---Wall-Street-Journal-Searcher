	<p class="article-leader">Author Bill Kauffman seems to subscribe to the sinister
notion that only by enduring self-imposed sentences of
starvation and denial can artists find artistic truth ("Real
Artists Don't Take Handouts," editorial page, May 14).
   No, Faulkner, Whitman and Thoreau never received
government support for their works. But how many would-be
artists failed to grow into the girth of their potential
because their as-yet-developed talents could not sustain them
through their early years? How many more Faulkners, Whitmans
and Thoreaus might there have been had the government
provided small doses of financial encouragement to those with
a gleam of promise?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As for those who have received government support --
authors such as Alice Walker, John Irving, Gloria Naylor and
Raymond Carver -- certainly they have returned our investment
in them, both in the tax revenues generated by their works
and, more important, through the enriching quality of their
prose.</p>
<p>This is not to suggest that without fellowships from the
National Endowment for the Arts such literary notables would
never have earned their place in American letters. Yet,
listen to the words of playwright Alfred Uhry who said that
"Driving Miss Daisy" would never have gotten out of the
garage if not for Endowment help. Or from Oscar Hijuelos,
this year's Pulitzer recipient for fiction, who claimed that
his Endowment fellowship was as important to him in 1985 as
the Pulitzer is today. In fact, all four Pulitzer recipients
in the arts this year, as well as the recipients of the
National Book Award for Fiction and the National Book Critics
Circle Award for Poetry, received Endowment grants in one way
or another.</p>

<p>I always find it either naive or stupid (or both) when the
Brahmins of American literature, Thoreau, Hawthorne and
Emerson, are trotted out to bash those who accept grants.
Working stiffs they weren't. Emerson (as quoted by Mr.
Kauffman) advising writers to learn writing in the streets,
not college, may make a figurative point, but such counsel
coming from one of the well-off and well-educated is a bit
much. And to bring in poor Melville] After the economic
debacles of "Moby Dick" and "The Confidence Man," Melville
had to work for 20 years at a government agency, the Custom
Office (a political patronage job). Perhaps if there had been
a direct government grant to get back then, he would have had
the wherewithal to publish another masterpiece in his
lifetime (it would have been "Billy Budd"), the sort of work
Mr. Kauffman, poor fellow, searches for in vain.</p>

<p>Mr. Kauffman made some good points. In the process,
however, he seemed to suggest that writers ought to be poor.</p>
<p>There is no dishonor in poverty, but being poor doesn't
help you write. When writers are broke, they get jobs.
Subsequently they write less or stop writing altogether. Even
when they land writing jobs, writers can rarely write about
what they regard as vital.</p>

<p>Vincent van Gogh was supported by grants from his brother;
one of his paintings just sold for $82.5 million. Perhaps Mr.
Kauffman would classify van Gogh as a mediocre artist because
he was subsidized. Much great art was the result of some type
of grant. The Sistine Chapel was commissioned by the Catholic
Church; Mozart was supported by kings.</p>
<p>In our time, the Guggenheim Foundation (to name only one)
has been responsible for 44 National Book Awards, 39 Nobel
Prizes and 90 Pulitzers. Among them were Katherine Anne
Porter, Alfred Kazin, John Kenneth Galbraith, Stephen Vincent
Benet, Conrad Aiken, Samuel Barber, Arthur Schlesinger Jr.
and Virgil Thomson. Benet's wife wrote that if it hadn't been
for the foundation grant in 1925, he never would have written
the poem "John Brown's Body," for which he won the Pulitzer
Prize.</p>
