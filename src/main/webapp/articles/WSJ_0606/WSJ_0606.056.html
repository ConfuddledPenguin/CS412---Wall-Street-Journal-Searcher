	<p class="article-leader">These are excerpts from the appeal Robert Bork filed on
behalf of Robert Wallach, who was convicted for activities
relating to Wedtech. A related "Rule of Law" column appears
today (see: "Rule of Law: Robert Bork Defends the RICOed
Robert Wallach" -- WSJ June 6, 1990).</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law: RICO
is constitutionally intolerable. The Due Process Clause of
the Fifth Amendment forbids Congress from enacting penal
statutes that are so vague and indefinite as to deprive a
person of ordinary intelligence of notice of the prohibited
conduct, and to afford unfettered discretion to prosecutors.
As Wallach's prosecution demonstrates, RICO grants
essentially unbridled discretion to judges and juries, and
affords no notice of what conduct it prohibits.</p>
<p>The key statutory elements -- the existence of an
"enterprise" and . . . "pattern of racketeering" -- have no
limiting definition in the statute. Nor does either of these
statutory terms provide any notice of what is actually
forbidden.</p>
<p>In the indictment here, the government listed five
payments that Wallach received from Wedtech. Yet he was
convicted for alleged misconduct with respect to only two of
those payments, made over a year apart, in compensation for
two entirely different undertakings. It is impossible to see
how they could be said to constitute any kind of "pattern" at
all. The two payments -- the bare minimum needed to establish
a "pattern of racketeering" -- appear to be related only
because they both involve Wallach and Wedtech, who were
otherwise involved in a legitimate business relationship.</p>
<p>This RICO prosecution well illustrates the constitutional
defects of that statute. No more than any judge of the
federal court system or any jury member, Wallach could not
possibly be expected to understand that Wedtech was a
"racketeering enterprise" or that two letters about different
fees for different legal services constituted a "pattern of
racketeering activity." The implications of Wallach's
conviction for other lawyers who sometimes bill clients as
their clients ask to be billed are extremely ominous. Either
the client or the law firm may be the "enterprise" and any
two fee statements may be the "pattern."</p>
<p>Avital Sharansky's non-testimony: In a sworn offer of
proof given from the witness stand outside of the jury's
presence, Mrs. Sharansky testified that she met Wallach in
1982; that she had met with him many times in her efforts to
gain her husband {Natan}'s release from a Soviet
concentration camp; that without any publicity Wallach had
contacted Henry Kissinger, Robert McFarlane, Edwin Meese and
members of Congress to plead her husband's case. The
government opposed Mrs. Sharansky's testimony on the ground
that it would center on a specific instance of conduct, but
at one point stated its true objection to her taking the
stand: "{T}his witness's testimony . . . will be very
powerful to the jury in a way that the testimony of other
character witnesses was not."</p>
<p>Despite being told that Mrs. Sharansky had to return to
her dying mother in Israel that night, the district court
refused to rule on the admissibility of her testimony until
the next day. . . . Judge Learned Hand warned that a trial
judge "must not take on the role of a partisan." Again and
again, however, the district court permitted the government
to try Wallach with irrelevant, but plainly prejudicial
evidence. Just as consistently, the court refused to allow
Wallach to defend himself against the government's onslaught
of inadmissible evidence, and effectively excluded some of
Wallach's most powerful evidence. Taken separately, each of
these rulings would require reversal. Taken together, they
produced a trial that cannot be countenanced.</p>
<p>A key prosecution witness's perjury: The government knew
or should have known that {Wedtech officer Anthony} Guariglia
perjured himself. After Guariglia testified that he stopped
gambling in the summer of 1988, he was forced to admit on
cross-examination that he had signed gambling markers in the
fall of 1988 in Atlantic City.</p>
<p>Thus, the government was told Guariglia had lied about his
gambling and handed the records that proved it. {Assistant
U.S. Attorney} Baruch Weiss protested that he had questioned
Guariglia extensively about the Atlantic City incident, and
Guariglia "firmly denied" gambling then or at any other time
subsequent to the summer of 1988. In light of Guariglia's
history of lying -- certainly no secret to the government --
and the Tropicana's records, the government must have known
that Guariglia's denial of gambling was perjury. As the
district court recognized, reversal is "virtually automatic"
if the government knowingly uses perjured testimony. . . . In
January 1990, after Wallach's trial, the government admitted
that Guariglia perjured himself.</p>
