	<p class="article-leader">Revco D.S. Inc., a unit of Anac Holding Corp., said it
agreed to sell 220 of its drugstores in five Southeastern
states to Jack Eckerd Corp. of Clearwater, Fla. Terms weren't
disclosed.
   For Revco, operating under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code, the sale represents a step in its plan,
announced Jan. 26, to divest itself of 712 stores in 17
states. Under Chapter 11, Revco receives court protection
from its creditors while it formulates a reorganization plan.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Revco, which along with its parent is based in Twinsburg,
Ohio, has said it plans to pare down its drugstores to about
1,100 in 10 contiguous Eastern states that account for 64% of
its $2.7 billion in yearly sales. Revco said the latest sale
to closely held Eckerd is subject to approval by the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court.</p>
