	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- In a compromise that could break the logjam
over cable TV legislation, the cable industry indicated it
would accept a proposed Senate bill to reregulate monthly
rates for basic service and let federal regulators limit the
size and activities of large operators.
   The new draft legislation, which calls for regulation of
rates for a basic tier of service consisting of broadcast
stations, is to be introduced tomorrow at a Senate Commerce
Committee session. The legislation is tougher than a proposal
circulated in the House by Chairman John Dingell (D., Mich.)
of the Energy and Commerce Committee, but is less restrictive
than earlier Senate measures.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>James Mooney, head of the National Cable Television
Association, said the industry has "serious problems" with
the new draft, but signaled that his organization wouldn't
oppose the measure. The proposal, he said, "clearly is less
onerous than the previous staff draft. That being the case,
we will focus on opposing adverse amendments to it."</p>
<p>Under the proposal, the Federal Communications Commission
would be required to monitor monthly rates for special cable
channels, and could reverse abusive rate increases. The FCC
would also devise rules for limiting horizontal and vertical
integration of large cable operators. In addition, it
requires cable companies to provide programming to
competitors, such as satellite or wireless cable services.</p>
<p>While the measure is aimed at encouraging competition, it
wouldn't allow telephone companies to enter the cable
business. Phone companies, however, have been lobbying
intensely for the opportunity, and Sen. Conrad Burns (R.,
Mont.), is planning to introduce an amendment to let phone
companies provide cable service within their franchise
territories. The amendment would substantially reverse the
1984 Cable Act ban on such activity.</p>
<p>In the House, Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.), chairman of
the telecommunications subcommittee, began circulating draft
cable legislation and has set a markup for June 25. Like the
Senate measure, the Markey plan also calls for reregulating a
basic tier of broadcast stations, establishing
customer-service standards and encouraging competition by
setting up guidelines for satellite or wireless cable rivals
to obtain cable programming.</p>
<p>For the past year, lawmakers have been under pressure from
cable subscribers to rein in rates, which have risen more
than 100% in many cities since they were largely deregulated
in 1987. But even if both the Senate Commerce Committee and
the House telecommunications panel pass legislation this
month, there is still a good chance that proponents of
reregulation will run out of time before the session ends,
preventing lawmakers from bringing home a trophy by November.
A crowded agenda could bog down lawmakers in phone-company or
competition issues that the industry is certain to fight.</p>
<p>Legislative efforts could be blunted by the FCC, which is
getting ready to decide whether to give municipalities more
say over rates and will recommend a package of legislative
changes in July.</p>
<p>The Bush administration is preparing to express strong
opposition to reregulation in a letter from Commerce
Secretary Robert Mosbacher and James Rill, head of the
Justice Department's Antitrust Division. They caution
lawmakers that legislation already introduced goes too far.</p>
