	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The Securities and Exchange Commission accused
a former official of Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. and
five others of securities-law violations involving three A&P
acquisitions.
   The civil suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan,
accuses Alan C. Goulding, formerly an A&P senior executive
vice president and chief operating officer, of passing on
inside information that the others used in purchasing stock.
The insider-trading scheme allegedly lasted from May 1986
through March 1987. Mr. Goulding allegedly tipped the other
defendants off about A&P's plans to acquire Shopwell Inc.,
Delchamps Inc., and Waldbaum Inc., as well as tipping them
off about higher-than-projected A&P earnings.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Goulding, 60 years old, of Allendale, N.J., and the
other defendants signed consent orders settling the case. In
the consent orders, the defendants neither denied nor
admitted any wrongdoing. The other defendants are Robert J.
Foley, 68, a food-marketing consultant in Redwood City,
Calif.; Joel Lopate, 56, of Miami; Murray Verlin, 68, part
owner of a food-distribution company, of Miami; Kurt Goldman,
65, of Boca Raton, Fla.; and Peter Goldman, 62, also of Boca
Raton.</p>
<p>In the consent order, the defendants agreed to turn over
alleged insider-trading profits totaling $513,881, plus
interest of $189,880. They also will pay penalties totaling
$1.3 million. Mr. Goulding, who isn't accused of trading on
the inside information, will pay a penalty of $635,000, the
largest portion of the disgorged profits and penalties.</p>
<p>Michael Himmel, an attorney for Mr. Goulding, said his
client left A&P for health reasons, and that he settled the
case in order to put it behind him.</p>
<p>An A&P spokesman said Mr. Goulding's departure from A&P
had nothing to do with the SEC allegations. He said the SEC's
investigation began after Mr. Goulding had taken early
retirement in July 1987.</p>
<p>Pamela Rogers Chepiga, an attorney for Kurt Goldman and
Peter Goldman, said she doesn't believe her clients committed
inside trading because they received their information
second-hand, rather than directly from Mr. Goulding. But she
said the two men decided that the settlement "was
economically advisable."</p>
<p>Lawrence Horn, an attorney for Mr. Lopate, declined to
comment. Attorneys for the other defendants couldn't be
reached for comment.</p>
