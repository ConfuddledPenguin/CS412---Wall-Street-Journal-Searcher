	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A Washington lawyer who made headlines last
summer when his private plane mysteriously crashed into the
Atlantic Ocean pleaded guilty to five felony counts,
including defrauding clients and submitting counterfeit
documents to federal agencies, a U.S. attorney said.
   A grand jury had indicted the lawyer, Thomas Root, in
March on various counts of counterfeiting federal documents,
forgery, and defrauding his clients, among other charges.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Root's guilty plea in Washington federal court came a
day after he was indicted on 455 counts of securities fraud
and related charges by a separate grand jury in Nashville,
N.C.</p>
<p>Mr. Root, 37, couldn't be reached for comment yesterday.</p>
<p>His guilty plea pertained to his representation of clients
seeking radio licenses before the Federal Communications
Commission. As a result of the plea, he faces up to 35 years
in prison and $1.25 million in fines, U.S. Attorney Jay
Stephens said. No date for sentencing has been set.</p>
<p>Mr. Root, in a July flight from Washington to North
Carolina, reportedly blacked out in the cockpit of his
single-engine plane. The plane eventually crashed off
Bermuda. Mr. Root survived, but he was pulled from the water
with a gunshot wound in his stomach.</p>
