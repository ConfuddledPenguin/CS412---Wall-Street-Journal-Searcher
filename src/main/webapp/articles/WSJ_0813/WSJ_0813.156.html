	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- What little safe-harbor appeal the wobbly
dollar had is wearing off, currency analysts say.
   While the Iraq-Kuwait crisis might, in other
circumstances, have prompted an enthusiastic rush to buy
dollars, U.S. economic fundamentals now are simply viewed as
too bearish for the dollar to qualify as a "safe" investment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It's a surprise that the dollar is not higher," given the
events in the Middle East, says Victor Polce, manager of
corporate trading at Algemene Bank Nederland in New York.</p>
<p>The dollar's movement Friday surprised many market
participants, as it stumbled against most other major
currencies even after statements by Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein sent shock waves through U.S. financial markets.</p>
<p>When the dollar sagged, gold quickly replaced it as the
investment of choice. On the Commodity Exchange in New York,
gold for current delivery settled at $396.90, up $11.10 an
ounce. Estimated volume was a heavy seven million ounces.</p>
<p>In late currency trading here Friday, the dollar was
changing hands at 1.5905 marks and 150.45 yen, compared with
1.5965 marks and 149.80 yen late Thursday. Compared with a
week earlier, the dollar was about unchanged, while gold was
up nearly $20 an ounce.</p>
<p>In early trading in Tokyo Monday, the dollar was quoted at
150.15 yen, up from 149.75 at the close there Friday. The
dollar was also trading at 1.5823 marks.</p>
<p>"The dollar is going to be heading south," probably to
1.50-1.55 marks and the "low 140s" against the yen, as soon
as the last of its "safe haven" appeal is worn off, Mr. Polce
of Algemene Bank says.</p>
<p>While the yen is currently being held back by worries that
higher oil prices will aggravate Japan's already substantial
inflation pressures, the recent rise in Japanese money market
rates should help the yen strengthen eventually, according to
Mr. Polce.</p>
<p>The market's hands-off mood about the dollar stems from a
series of ills that have pushed the U.S. economy to the brink
of recession. Those problems include a troubled banking
industry, a sluggish manufacturing sector and growing
unemployment.</p>
<p>"There's a good fundamental camp that has wanted to see
the dollar go lower" because of the economy, says Rick
Porter, manager of corporate trading at Westpac Banking Corp.</p>
<p>Among the U.S. economy's several problems, the most
worrisome at the moment is the surge in oil prices caused by
Iraq's takeover of Kuwait. The September crude oil futures
contract has risen more than $6 a barrel in the past two
weeks to settle Friday at $26.23.</p>
<p>The higher oil prices couldn't have hit the U.S. at a
worse time: Inflation is already a stubborn problem burdening
the economy, and with the oil-price surge the Federal Reserve
can't ease credit aggressively to stimulate growth.</p>
<p>At the current rate of economic activity, some analysts
see negative growth as possible for the U.S.'s third and
fourth quarters after a feeble 1.2% annual rate of expansion
in the second quarter and 1.7% in the first quarter.</p>
<p>Roger Brinner, chief economist at DRI-McGraw Hill in
Lexington, Mass., says U.S. economic growth could be cut by
0.7 percentage point in 1991 if oil stays near its current
price for a lengthy period.</p>
<p>Mr. Brinner sees better prospects for Europe and Japan,
saying that inflation-adjusted growth in European Community
countries might be curbed by only half a point next year if
oil prices stay up and that growth in Japan may be trimmed by
0.6 percentage point.</p>
<p>The generally stronger economies of Western Europe and
Japan should help those nations withstand any oil price shock
better than the U.S., Mr. Brinner says.</p>
<p>In early trading in Hong Kong Monday, gold was quoted at
$394.25 an ounce.</p>
