	<p class="article-leader">Prison, as Richard Nixon has observed, has proved to be
fertile ground for writers and social observers in this
century. Idealists and visionaries like Mahatma Gandhi and
Martin Luther King Jr., and lunatics like Adolf Hitler,
spawned powerful books and articles about their movements
from behind bars. Now, from that center of the new and the
relevant, Los Angeles, come some poignant thoughts about
management and organization in modern corporations, also
germinated in jail.
   The source of this data is a man I will call Donald. He
was a student of mine some years ago at a glittering
university overlooking the ocean in Malibu. Donald was an
intelligent and articulate guy, but he was also an
incorrigible (I thought) wise guy, troublemaker and arguer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>I had heard, off and on, that the same traits had dogged
him when he had gone to work for a very major corporation
here in Los Angeles. Promotion had been slow, and he had been
in constant jeopardy of being dismissed -- always because of
his bad attitude.</p>
<p>When he pulled up behind me at a gas station in Malibu a
few days ago in a gleaming sports car, looking like a vastly
more confident, far smoother, far easier to talk to -- far,
far better dressed -- guy than I had known, I was surprised.
He looked, as one might say, like a successful version of his
old self.</p>
<p>He said that he had, in fact, been doing incomparably
better at his work, had been promoted, was told what an asset
he was, and was on the fast track to plutocracy. Over veggie
burgers at an outdoor restaurant, he told me what had
happened.</p>
<p>It all began, he said, when he had been sentenced to 60
days in LA County Jail for drunken driving while on
probation. It was, he said, a kind of education he had never
expected, but had badly needed.</p>
<p>From the first moment that he had been handcuffed to a
hardened convict and attached by leg irons to five others --
all of whom were terrifying -- Donald had realized that he
had better learn the rules of prison life fast, or he was
going to wind up either dead or with some truly horrible
stories to tell for the rest of his life. "There are rules of
how to get by," he said, "and if you follow them, you do."</p>
<p>Rule One, he said, ". . . is that no matter what kind of
crap is being dished out by the cops and the guards, you
absolutely have to put up with it. You can't say one word
back or you get hit so hard you can't believe it, and you
can't do a thing about it. That's rule one: Be humble and
don't talk back to those who have power over you.</p>
<p>"Rule Two is that you can't take any crap at all, not any,
from anyone on your level. You can't let yourself be pushed
around at all, not even a little bit, by the other prisoners.
If they ask you for a cigarette, you tell them to go ----
themselves. If they ask you for money, you tell them you'd
rather kill them than give them a cent. You can be friendly,
but don't ever back down from anything, and even if the guy
is 10 times your size, you let him know you'll put up a fight
and he'll at least have some scars on him. Respect is
everything in jail, and if you don't have the guts to fight,
take it until you do (while I was in jail, I told people I
was there for whacking my old lady, just so they wouldn't
think I was another drunk-driving wimp).</p>
<p>"Third, beware of anyone who seems to be doing you a favor
that's too good to be true. The first night I was there, a
little guy offered me his bed -- and there weren't anywhere
near enough beds to go around -- for five bucks. I paid him,
and 10 minutes later, this huge Chinese guy comes by and says
it's his bed and he's going to kill me. We swore at each
other for a while, so I at least looked tough, and then I
went and got my money back from the little guy. Guys who
(make offers) too good to be true are nothing but trouble, at
least in jail.</p>
<p>"Fourth, stay out of other people's fights. You don't need
to speak up for someone who's being hassled unless you're
part of his group. The guy who started teaching me about this
told me at first I should just go off into a corner and not
talk to anyone. He was totally right -- totally. And it saved
me a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>"Fifth, hook up with a larger group who can protect you.
Don't ever be alone in jail. In LA County (jail) there were
mostly blacks and Hispanics, and since I'm not black and I
speak Spanish, I got with the Mexicans. That way I wasn't
just one lone guy who they could kill in the shower for
laughs.</p>
<p>"Sixth, have a goal, and pay attention to it. My goal was
to get out of there alive, in one piece, in good health, and
without any horror stories to tell my friends. I did it, but
it meant giving up being a wise ass; no more arguing for the
fun of it, no more disrupting everybody else just to be the
center of attention. Just staying alive. That was my goal.</p>
<p>"The point is that when I got out, one month early for
good behavior, and went back to work -- they thought I was in
Germany on vacation -- I just reflexively started to do the
same things I had done in County.</p>
<p>"They worked even better there. Being humble to my bosses,
not taking any guff at all from the people on my same level,
not getting into other people's fights, making myself part of
a group that could protect me, staying away from people who
offered me unreal favors, paying attention to my goal (which
was to get promoted), not showing off -- all that works
incredibly well in a large white-collar organization.</p>
<p>"Prison is the most unforgiving, rigorous large
competitive organization. It's the essence of human
relationships in groups without any of the politeness or the
etiquette. It's what business school should teach you about
what competing is really like -- boot camp, in a way, for
other more compromising situations. It sure worked for me,"
Donald said.</p>
<p>"Anyway, now that you know," he added, "don't feel you
have to try it."</p>
<p>(Thanks, I won't.)</p>
