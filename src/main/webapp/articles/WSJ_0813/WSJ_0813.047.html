	<p class="article-leader">Trying to dissect the criminal-justice system -- and what
ails it -- is a favorite pastime of politicians, the public
and Hollywood. Now, a former assistant district attorney has
written a book on wielding the hammer and feather of justice.
   The setting could be anywhere, but here it is the
Manhattan DA office of Robert Morgenthau, where David
Heilbroner spent three years learning how to indict the
proverbial ham sandwich. "Rough Justice: Days and Nights of a
Young D.A." (Pantheon, 280 pages, $19.95) is Mr. Heilbroner's
rambling, but always colorful description of his adventures
with a legal system he finds in deep need of reform.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Like all rookies, Mr. Heilbroner's training started with a
course on jury selection. How to choose? Mr. Heilbroner got
his instructions from one of the office's bureau chiefs, Tom
McGillicuddy, who stressed: "No artists or musicians --
they're too spacey and can't remember complex fact patterns."
("I thought what about a Rachmaninoff piano concerto?")</p>
<p>"Writers are okay, but they tend to be too liberal and
look for the defendant's motivation. . . . No doormen. They
always acquit. Janitors can be okay, but security guards will
give you trouble," continued Mr. McGillicuddy. Included in
his generalizations, which the author notes "poured forth
like a series of intentional faux pas," were that Irish were
bad jurors, blacks okay, Hispanics so-so. Mr. Heilbroner also
says rookies were told "never to ask jurors after a trial how
they had reached their verdict. Their answers would be too
disturbingly unrelated to the facts."</p>
<p>Then how, one wonders, did Mr. McGillicuddy devise his
theories? Still, perhaps because of the cynicism and cliches,
the book seems palpably real. So are the nonchalant
descriptions of violence and the weird legalese -- the
subculture of terminology dominating communications in a
prosecutor's office.</p>
<p>Cases start out, Mr. Heilbroner writes, in ECAB, or Early
Case Assessment Bureau, the first level of examining
complaints in the courthouse known on TV as "Night Court."
While that sitcom has almost nonstop humor, the real life of
an ADA is anything but a lot of laughs. ECAB is a place where
no one is trusted -- even phones and desks are bolted down.
Conversations between a cop and an ADA, Mr. Heilbroner
writes, go like this: "How many knife wounds did the victim
receive?" Answer: "At least three to the right arm and maybe
a couple to her side. There was so much blood it was hard to
tell."</p>
<p>"Do you think she might go out of the picture?" "Nah. They
just stitched her up in the ER and I gave her a ride home."</p>
<p>The book suggests that being a prosecutor is often like
trying to be King Solomon, the ayatollah and the boy with his
finger in the dike all rolled into one. Though often
prosecuting the obscure, Mr. Heilbroner had 15 minutes of
fame while investigating the hospital death of Andy Warhol
and the theft of two fur coats belonging to Barbara Bush when
she was Second Lady. They were stolen from a refurbisher's
storage by an employee who then sold them for $200 each to
buy, oh irony, a night's worth of crack.</p>
<p>Beyond that it was plain folks and accompanying case files
that make Greek look easy. Take this example of DA shorthand:
"On for arr. f & s vdf and ind. Offer: c w/3-6. f & s pfs."
(Translation: The case is set for arraignment. File with the
court and serve on defense counsel a copy of your voluntary
disclosure form and a copy of the indictment. We will reduce
the charge to a Class C felony -- 3 to 6 years minimum -- if
the defendant will plead guilty. Because the defendant has a
prior felony conviction, file a predicate felony statement
with the court.)</p>
<p>The cast of characters in this legal madness, including a
criminal named Vanity Valdez and a victim named Andrew
Straight, is endless: rapists, murderers, shoplifters, con
men, fake street vendors, drug runners, prostitutes and so
forth -- three shifts a day. Some of the obscure crimes Mr.
Heilbroner became well-versed in were jostling and clipping a
dog's ears without anesthetic.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Mr. Heilbroner's proposals for reform
include abolishing the grand-jury system and dismissing
marginal misdemeanors. On top of that, he says legalizing
prostitution and marijuana, though politically unpopular,
would "help eliminate thousands more petty cases each year,
cases that neither judges nor prosecutors take seriously."</p>
<p>Life as an ADA took its toll, writes Mr. Heilbroner, as he
describes a darkly funny scene that could only involve a
lawyer. Toward the end of his prosecutorial stint, he began
cross-examining a beggar on the street who asked for money.
(Who are you, why do you want the money, etc.) At this point,
the author knew it was time for a change, and traded in his
sword of justice for a pen to write what is a good first
book. As for the beggar, he's probably still wondering whom
he tangled with. They don't call it "Rough Justice" for
nothing.</p>
