	<p class="article-leader">May Department Stores Co. said it postponed an initial
public offering of stock in its Venture Stores Inc. unit
because of "current market conditions."
   In June, St. Louis-based May said it planned to offer 14%,
or about 2.3 million Venture shares, at between $16 and $18 a
share. May then planned to spin off the remaining Venture
shares to May shareholders.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Since then, however, the stock market has declined, and
the environment for new offerings is less friendly.</p>
<p>May nevertheless said it plans to complete the offering
"as soon as market conditions allow," and spin off the
remaining Venture shares before year end.</p>
<p>The spinoff of the discount chain would allow May to
concentrate on its main business of department stores and
would better capitalize Venture, which plans to expand with
more stores.</p>
