	<p class="article-leader">TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. -- A top United Auto Workers union
official said the union would moderate its pay demands and
back three-shift production schemes at Big Three assembly
plants in exchange for "true job security."
   "I think management is right that they need more
flexibility to keep their plants running at capacity and to
keep jobs in this country," Stan Marshall, the UAW vice
president leading the union's negotiations with Chrysler
Corp., said Friday at an industry conference here.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But Mr. Marshall said the union has no interest in
Chrysler's proposal to pay UAW members with stock in exchange
for wage and work-practice concessions. He also said the
union isn't interested in Chrysler's proposal to pay
employees at certain factories for achieving specific
productivity goals, such as reducing absenteeism or improving
quality.</p>
<p>Chrysler officials had no comment on Mr. Marshall's
remarks. Both General Motors Corp. and Chrysler have made
union approval of three-shift production a major objective of
their current national contract negotiations with the UAW.</p>
<p>Analysts say expanding vehicle production over three
shifts from two could yield as much as $200 million more a
year in gross profits from a plant building a popular model.
GM credits three-shift work schedules for helping to produce
record profits in the past three years at its European
operations.</p>
