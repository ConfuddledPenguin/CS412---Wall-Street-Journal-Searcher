	<p class="article-leader">LUMEX Inc. directors omitted the two-cent quarterly
dividend. As of June 30 the company had an average of 4.2
million shares outstanding. The Bay Shore, N.Y., manufacturer
of products for the fitness, health-care and physical-therapy
markets cited "depressed first-half results and the uncertain
economic climate." For the first six months, Lumex reported a
loss of $1.1 million, or 25 cents a share, against net income
of $811,000, or 19 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
The company said, however, that it expects to be profitable
in the second half. In American Stock Exchange composite
trading Friday, Lumex fell 62.5 cents to $5.75.</p>
