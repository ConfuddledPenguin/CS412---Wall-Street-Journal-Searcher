	<p class="article-leader">Poor Clifford Gookin ("On the Street: Still Disbelieving,
a Highflying Yuppie Tastes Unemployment," page one, July 17)
should sue Harvard Business School for not having taught him
fundamentals such as "risk vs. reward" and "supply meets
demand." Perhaps Mother Teresa could recommend a lawyer for
an ill-educated white man embittered by life's cruel
injustices such as having his ego and $500,000-a-year income
shot out of the stratosphere and then having to listen to his
own whining instead of piped-in stereophonic down here on
Earth.
   Mr. Gookin sounds like a decent person, and I might have
had sympathy for him had he had the humility to acknowledge
that the "lottery" through which he, correctly, claims to
have lost his job is the very same lottery through which he
won it -- the lottery that picked "tall, mostly white, mostly
men. Most of them were athletes. They had short hair. . . ."</p>

<p>Poor Clifford] Call it callous, but your portrait of
yuppie despair brought a smile to my face, as it probably did
to any readers who were among the tens of thousands of people
who lost their jobs through the deals Mr. Gookin and his
colleagues engineered. It is time these fearless corporate
warriors realized they are not exempt from the risk of
becoming casualties in the board-room wars they instigated,
and by which they profited so much.</p>

<p>Have no sympathy for an investment banker who apparently
actually believed that with seven years of business
experience he was worth $500,000 a year. The average annual
family income in the U.S. is about $25,000. Does Mr. Gookin
truly think he was worth 20 average Americans? If so, all I
have to say is, to quote from the wisdom of Ann Landers,
"Wake up and smell the coffee, Buttercup."</p>

<p>Mr. Gookin seems to forget he was the victim of what he
helped to perpetuate. One of the asserted reasons for many
corporate takeovers was to eliminate inefficient management
preventing a company from maximizing its profit potential.
Mr. Gookin's loss of employment is consistent with that goal.
It's difficult to feel much sorrow for him, as he had the
opportunity to earn an enormous income for several years and
will be able to find new employment at a smaller but still
comfortable income. Many employees who lost their jobs in
takeover deals in which Mr. Gookin undoubtedly participated
never made big incomes and will have a difficult time finding
new employment at a living wage.</p>
<p>Mr. Gookin doesn't understand why First Boston could not
keep him when it continues to pay seven-figure salaries to
senior managers. How incredibly naive. He was merely a highly
paid technician carrying out details of deals arranged by
senior partners. He is replaceable by myriad people with
similar education. In contrast, the highly paid senior
managers have two characteristics Mr. Gookin lacks: a wealth
of business experience and, perhaps most important, the
ability to bring in clients.</p>

<p>Mr. Gookin wonders what went wrong with his world. He
wants to know why First Boston didn't stand behind him; why
many of the firm's senior management didn't cut their
seven-figure salaries in order to keep him around. Try greed
and no loyalty -- the same principles that guided Mr. Gookin.</p>
<p>These MBAs with their junk bonds and leveraged buy-outs
made an art form of "downsizing" of companies while selling
off their assets. How many thousands of hard-working men and
women found their jobs had been lost to Mr. Gookin and his
"bean counters," just so the "deal could be done?"</p>

<p>Your article was one of the funniest pieces I've read in a
long, long time. Mr. Gookin says he was the victim of a
callous numbers game, and that he is bitterly disappointed
that his number randomly came up. Did he ever stop to think
that being on Wall Street in the mid-1980s was also a random
bit of luck?</p>

<p>I wonder if, while Mr. Gookin and his associates pursued
their LBO quarries, he spared a thought for the "mid-Eighties
Everymen" who were less than pawns in the avaricious and
remorseless quest for sometimes senseless deals that
impoverished those who had no control over their employment
destinies?</p>
<p>Now that the feeding frenzy is over, it appears very few
"names" will remain untouched by the various investigations
into the half-baked money-grubbing. The euphemism
"white-collar crime" is fast becoming the understatement of
the decade. Who knows how many more will suffer as a result
of the junk-bond debacle?</p>
