	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Just over a decade ago, gold prices soared
threefold to $850 an ounce, mainly because worried sheiks
feared armed confrontation in the Middle East.
   This time around, however, bullion proved to be an
unsatisfactory haven for Middle Eastern potentates, some
dealers say.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Iraq's invasion of Kuwait only spurred a gold price rise
of $23 to $396 an ounce, and the metal proved to be poor
security for Kuwaitis, the dealers say. The invading Iraqi
army looted Kuwaiti banks, houses and bazaars, stealing large
quantities of gold.</p>
<p>"Worried Middle Eastern potentates now appreciate that
gold doesn't provide more security than other financial
assets," a German bullion manager says. On the contrary, it
was fortunate for wealthy Kuwaitis to have other assets
safely tucked away in foreign banks, he says.</p>
<p>It isn't even advantageous to hold gold as a "discreet
asset", the dealers say. Gold isn't any more anonymous than
currency deposits, securities or any other financial assets,
they say.</p>
<p>When the U.S., U.K. and other nations either froze or
restricted movement of Kuwaiti and Iraqi assets after the
invasion, gold was included.</p>
<p>Gold owned by Kuwaitis and Iraqis are under the same
restrictions as other assets, a senior Bank of England
official says. Banks intending buying or selling bullion on
behalf of Kuwaiti or Iraqi owners must receive permission
from the Bank of England, the official says.</p>
<p>Bullion banks are under a legal obligation to disclose
whether Kuwaitis or Iraqis are the owners of the metal, the
official said. Since gold stocks are held at the Bank of
England and in the vaults of London bullion houses, its
ownership can be traced, the official says.</p>
<p>The Bank of England rules apply to assets under its own
jurisdiction, the official says. Yet if a Swiss bank carries
out the transaction with a London bullion house, it is up to
the Swiss intermediary to disclose the Kuwaiti or Iraqi
ownership of the gold to its own regulatory authority, the
official says.</p>
<p>Yet some dealers say wealthy Middle Eastern investors are
no longer mesmerized by gold.</p>
<p>It costs $1500 for each $1 million worth of gold stored in
a vault of a Swiss bank, and the metal doesn't earn any
interest.</p>
<p>"Moreover, the younger Middle Eastern generation isn't as
gold-minded as their elders," says Alfred Schneider, a first
vice president of Swiss Bank Corp. They are educated abroad
and understand sophisticated currency and bond and equity
investments, he says.</p>
<p>Between March and June, Kuwaiti and Saudi investors dumped
an estimated 100 to 200 tons of gold on the market, bullion
dealers say, because they were disenchanted with it as an
investment. That gold was originally bought in the late '70s,
so losses on capital and foregone interest were extensive.</p>
<p>In their rush to obtain dollars and other foreign currency
during the latest crisis, wealthy Middle Eastern sheiks,
including Kuwaitis and Saudi Arabians, sold more gold, Swiss
dealers say. They received higher prices because professional
dealers and investors in Europe, the U.S. and Japan were
enthusiastic buyers.</p>
<p>Despite the growing sophistication of the wealthier Middle
East families, people in the region will continue to be
hoarders of gold, according to Timothy Green, a gold
consultant and author of books on the subject. In the past
decade, for example, Saudi Arabians bought 173 tons of gold
from local dealers.</p>
<p>In the latest crisis, Middle Eastern investors bought
small gold bars and jewelry at bazaars known as souks. The
souks could soon run out of gold, dealers say, because Swiss
and other Western bullion refiners have stopped shipments of
the metal to the unstable region.</p>
<p>There were some advantages for Kuwaitis to hold gold.</p>
<p>"An ounce or two would have bribed an Iraqi soldier," the
German banker says. For refugees, gold in the pocket is worth
far more than virtually useless Kuwaiti currency, he says.</p>
