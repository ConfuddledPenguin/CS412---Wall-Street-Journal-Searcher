	<p class="article-leader">The rise in oil prices caused by the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait will raise the general level of prices in the United
States and lower our real economic growth during the year
ahead. But if the Federal Reserve does its job well, the oil
price rise need not cause a recession or start an
inflationary spiral like that of the 1970s.
   Although there are already calls for the Fed to ease
policy enough to prevent any economic slowdown, that would be
a mistake. It would also be a mistake for the Fed to tighten
monetary policy enough to prevent any oil-induced rise in
next year's overall price index. The best strategy for the
Fed would be to stick to its current implicit target of a
rise in nominal GNP (i.e., total national output at current
prices) of about 6% even though that will mean some slowdown
in real activity and a somewhat faster rise in prices than
would have been anticipated before the Iraqi invasion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>An unchanged nominal GNP target is more than just a
compromise between a more expansionary monetary policy aimed
at preventing any slowdown in real activity and a tighter
monetary policy designed to prevent any rise in inflation. An
explicit Fed promise to stick to a policy consistent with its
original nominal GNP projections would reassure financial
markets and the public that the current oil price rise would
not trigger an inflationary spiral and ultimate recession.</p>
<p>Market expectations that the Fed will not shift its
nominal GNP goal are important. If companies believed instead
that the Federal Reserve will respond to the oil price hike
with an accommodating easy money strategy, as it did in the
1970s, they will try to get a jump on the upcoming inflation
and the overall price level will rise by more than the direct
effect of the oil price increase. But if companies believe
that the Fed will not accommodate such a price rise, the
overall price increase could be less than the direct effect.</p>
<p>Before the oil price jump, a nominal GNP rise of 6% during
the next four quarters would probably have translated into an
inflation rate of about 4% and a rise in real GNP of about
2%. Any faster rise in total spending would be inconsistent
with bringing U.S. inflation down from its current
unsatisfactory level.</p>
<p>And while the recent inflation rate of between 4% and 5%
may seem moderate in comparison to the much higher inflation
of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the current inflation rate
is substantially above that in Japan and in major European
countries and nearly twice as high as the U.S. sustained
between the end of the Korean War and the acceleration of the
Vietnam War. The Fed has been correct to insist on reducing
the rate of inflation.</p>
<p>To lower the pace of inflation, the Fed has been gradually
slowing the rate of increase of nominal GNP by slowing the
expansion of monetary aggregates. In recent months, however,
the execution of this strategy of gradualism has been
frustrated by the reluctance of banks to lend in the current
regulatory and economic climate. Despite the Federal
Reserve's actions to lower the federal funds rate, the M2 and
M3 monetary aggregates have not increased since April. The
virtual standstill of the aggregates over the past six months
is inconsistent with a nominal GNP rise of 6% and could
contribute to a further slowdown this year.</p>
<p>Unless there is reason to expect a sharp rise in velocity
in the future -- and I can see no such reason -- a more
expansionary monetary policy during the coming months would
have been appropriate in order to achieve 6% nominal GNP
growth. Sticking with that same 6% nominal GNP target after
the oil price rise may now require a slightly different path
for money than it would have if the level of oil prices had
remained unchanged. But the pace of monetary expansion should
still be increased enough in the coming months to bring the
aggregates back to the center of their target ranges, an
expansion that would lower short-term interest rates.</p>
<p>What impact would such a 6% nominal GNP increase have on
real economic activity during the coming year? If 6% nominal
GNP growth would have implied a rather weak 2% rise in real
GNP prior to the jump in oil prices, will the shift to higher
inflation and lower real growth now mean a recession? I don't
think so.</p>
<p>The extent of the increase in next year's inflation and
the corresponding slowdown of real growth within the overall
6% nominal GNP rise depends of course on the extent of the
jump in the oil price. Although no one can be certain about
the future level of oil prices, as of today the spot price is
$27 a barrel or about $7 a barrel above the $20 average
around which oil prices have fluctuated for the past two
years. Looking ahead, the prices of oil futures for the 12
months of 1991 now average about $24 a barrel. At the risk of
overestimating the decline in real GNP growth, let's assume
that the current $7 a barrel price rise will persist.</p>
<p>There are two channels through which the higher oil price
will depress economic activity. First, an increase in the
price of imported oil is like a tax levied by the OPEC
producers on American consumers and businesses. Since the
U.S. imports about two billion barrels of oil a year, a $7 a
barrel price hike would reduce total real income by $14
billion.</p>
<p>Most of this would translate into reduced consumer
spending. Although this would in principle be offset by
increased demand for our exports as OPEC countries spend
their added income, in practice much of that extra income
would be saved by the OPEC countries. The increase in overall
OPEC saving will lower world interest rates, but the
resulting rise in U.S. investment won't happen soon enough to
offset the fall in consumption in 1991. The net short-run
impact would be likely to be equivalent to a decline in
demand of $10 billion to $15 billion or between two-tenths
and three-tenths of 1% of GNP.</p>
<p>The other short-run direct effect of an oil price rise is
to raise the overall price level in the U.S. This rise in the
price level would increase the public's demand for money. If
the Federal Reserve does not fully accommodate this increased
demand, short-term interest rates would rise and real
activity would be depressed. This is what will happen if the
Fed keeps the rise in nominal GNP unchanged. Over a two or
three year period, such a policy will reverse the initial
rise in the price level as the temporarily weaker economy
slows the rise in the prices of non-oil products.</p>
<p>Interest rates would then subside and real economic
activity return to normal. But in the short run, the higher
overall price level would mean that the growth of nominal GNP
would involve more inflation and less real economic growth.
How much less? The impact of the higher oil price on the
overall GNP price level depends on the total volume of oil
produced in the U.S. (about 3 billion barrels a year) and not
on oil imports. A $7 a barrel price rise would directly
increase the dollar value of U.S. oil production by $21
billion a year or about four tenths of 1% of GNP. This
translates directly into a 0.4% rise in the overall price
level.</p>
<p>Since the combination of higher oil prices and depressed
real activity would change other prices as well (the prices
of coal and gas are already up while the prices of the wide
range of goods for which demand will fall as overall activity
slows will decline), it's not possible to say with precision
how much the overall price level would change if the Fed
holds constant the increase in nominal GNP. But even if the
increases in coal and gas prices offset all of the other
price slowdowns, the effect would be an overall price rise of
only 0.4%. If total nominal GNP growth is unchanged, the
effect of that higher price level would be to cut the growth
of real GNP next year by four-tenths of 1%.</p>
<p>These estimates of each of the two effects taken by itself
-- the OPEC tax that reduces real consumer spending and the
higher domestic price level that reduces the real GNP
component of a given nominal GNP -- are not additive. Because
the two effects interact with each other, their combined
impact is an average of the two effects calculated
separately.</p>
<p>A precise estimate of the prospective change in real GNP
is, however, not possible. But my own judgment is that if the
Federal Reserve achieves a nominal GNP growth of 6% over the
next four quarters, the oil price rise is likely to reduce
real GNP growth in the coming year by only about one-half of
1%. Economic growth would drop to about 1.5% but a recession
would be avoided and price inflation, while rising
temporarily to 4.5%, would be kept under control.</p>
<p>Although such a slow growth of real GNP would be
frustrating to everyone at a time when unemployment is rising
and profits are falling, it would be the best response to the
extra burden imposed on our economy by Iraq. Such a policy
would avoid the risk of repeating the inflationary explosion
of the 1970s.</p>
