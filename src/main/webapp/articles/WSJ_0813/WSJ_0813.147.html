	<p class="article-leader">Volkswagen AG said Friday that effective today it is
raising prices of its automobiles in West Germany an average
2.9%.
   Europe's largest car maker said it last raised prices
across the board in December 1989, when prices rose 2.9% as
well. Earlier this year, however, the company cut prices on
certain automobiles equipped with catalytic converters.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Wolfsburg-based company said the base price of its
popular Golf model, with a 1.3 liter engine, will rise to
18,820 marks ($11,788) from 18,330 marks, and the base price
of the midsized Passat, with a 1.8 liter engine, will rise to
25,790 marks from 24,960 marks.</p>
<p>Volkswagen derives about 35% of its more than 65 billion
marks in annual sales from the West German domestic market.
Other West German auto makers are likely to follow Volkswagen
and raise prices by somewhat similar margins soon.</p>
