	<p class="article-leader">FRANKFURT -- West German publishing group Axel Springer
Verlag AG said Friday it has formed a new Electronic Media
division.
   West Berlin-based Springer said the new operating unit
will be responsible for the group's expansion into the
rapidly growing global electronic communications sector. It
cited specific areas such as "new (communications)
technologies and mobile communications."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Springer added that it will place a priority on growth in
the electronic media market. That would include shareholdings
in satellite television stations, among others, officials
said.</p>
<p>Meantime, the company that publishes West Germany's
popular mass-circulation daily newspaper, Bild, said it will
continue to expand aggressively in the newspaper and magazine
markets despite "hard competitive pressures" in West Germany.</p>
<p>The company also said it plans to broaden its presence
abroad. Springer has been expanding into Eastern Europe since
the liberalization of the East Bloc.</p>
