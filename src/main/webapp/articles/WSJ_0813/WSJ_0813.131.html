	<p class="article-leader">After 20 years of relentless litigation, federal judges
from across the U.S. approved an unusual joint arrangement to
resolve the 90,000 asbestos personal-injury cases now
clogging the courts.
   Faced with thousands of new cases filed each month --
often by victims who will die before their claims are paid --
the judges approved an order Friday addressing the urgency of
the problem and setting up three forums for resolving the
cases. The actions announced in the order are intended to
pressure the defendants either to agree to a national
settlement or go to trial in a class-action lawsuit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For now, however, the judges' action is likely to bring
current settlement efforts to a halt as defendants size up
their new alternatives. Supporters of the judges' plan,
though, say that a consolidated, nationwide effort to resolve
the cases will benefit asbestos victims in the long run by
ensuring that funds are distributed more equitably and by
guaranteeing that money is left to pay future claims.</p>
<p>Asbestos, once widely used as insulation, causes cancer
and respiratory ailments. Most of the claimants are former
shipyard and construction workers who became ill years later
from the asbestos dust they inhaled on the job. The
defendants are former asbestos makers and distributors who
are accused of failing to warn workers of the serious health
risks.</p>
<p>"The need for a multicourt cooperative effort to dispose
of these cases is compelling," the judges said in the order.
"The various case management techniques utilized by the
federal courts over the last 10 years have proved to be
ineffective. . . . The asbestos litigation has become the
classic example of civil cases that cost too much and take
too long."</p>
<p>The order was issued by Judge Thomas Lambros, chief judge
of the Northern federal district of Ohio, and by Judge Robert
Parker, chief judge of the Eastern federal district of Texas.
U.S. Judge Jack B. Weinstein of Brooklyn, whose criticism of
the Manville asbestos trust a few weeks ago was the catalyst
for the national effort, agreed to the order. Seven other
federal judges approved the order at a meeting in Washington
on Friday.</p>
<p>The order includes plans for two possible class-actions,
one of which is likely to be kicked off today in Judge
Weinstein's courtroom in Brooklyn. That class action is meant
to include the less financially secure former asbestos makers
and is expected to eventually involve the Manville trust. The
trust's resources would be combined with those of other
defendants.</p>
<p>The Manville trust, instrumental to Manville Corp.'s
bankruptcy-court reorganization plan in 1986, was set up to
pay asbestos personal-injury claims against the company. The
asbestos litigation controversy came to a head after the
trust said it couldn't pay new claimants for more than 20
years because it was running out of cash.</p>
<p>The class-action motion before Judge Weinstein was filed
by Eagle-Picher Industries Inc., which claims that it and
other defendants don't have enough money to continue fighting
the cases. In court filings, the company said it spent $119.7
million on the litigation last year and is named in 2,000 new
suits a month.</p>
<p>Under Friday's order, as many as five other defendants can
join Eagle-Picher in the class action. For the case to
proceed, the court will have to determine that the defendants
don't have enough money to pay current and future claims.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a national settlement effort for all cases will
be set up by Judge Lambros in Cleveland. The joint order
envisions a massive settlement. Several judges are expected
to participate by encouraging plaintiffs and defendants to
settle.</p>
<p>In order to give the settlement process clout with
defendants, a wider class action will be heard by Judge
Parker in Beaumont, Texas. He will oversee cases against
defendants who are unwilling to settle.</p>
<p>The judges will hear objections to the proposals at a
hearing on Sept. 14 in federal court in Cleveland. In recent
weeks, the judges' efforts to come up with a national
solution has drawn mixed reviews from plaintiffs and
defendants, and aspects of Friday's order are likely to be
appealed. But some attorneys indicated that the judges may
have found an acceptable middle ground.</p>
<p>Louis S. Robles, an attorney for asbestos victims in
Miami, said he still opposes a class action. But considering
the judges' determination to come up with a national
approach, the latest order "was a prudent way to go" because
it doesn't immediately force the parties into a class action
and it allows current cases to continue, he said.</p>
<p>Attorneys for Eagle-Picher praised the judges' decision.
"It is consistent with our goals," said Arvin Maskin, an
attorney for the company. "The corporate defendants remain
viable, transaction costs {of resolving the cases} are
reduced, and it alleviates a tremendous burden on the
courts."</p>

<p>FORMER THORNBURGH AIDE indicted on cocaine-related
charges.</p>
<p>A former Justice Department official was accused of using
cocaine in the latest of a string of highly visible problems
for Attorney General Dick Thornburgh.</p>
<p>In a four-count indictment, a grand jury in Harrisburg,
Pa., accused Henry Barr of using cocaine over a four-year
period, including the time he served in the Justice
Department. In a highly unusual charge, Mr. Barr was also
accused of lying to cover up his drug use on an application
for a security clearance.</p>
<p>Mr. Barr, a former federal prosecutor who served on Mr.
Thornburgh's staff when he was governor of Pennsylvania, quit
his Justice Department post in May 1989, citing personal
reasons. He had coordinated major criminal investigations for
the attorney general, including those involving drugs. His
lawyer, Charles Scarlata of Pittsburgh, said Mr. Barr would
plead not guilty.</p>
<p>Mr. Thornburgh, trying to stay clear of the situation, has
recused himself from the Barr case on the grounds that he
knows the defendant personally. "I have no knowledge of the
particular circumstances of this case," the attorney general
said in a prepared statement on Friday.</p>
<p>Mr. Thornburgh has suffered several political defeats,
including seeing top appointments rejected by the Senate and
personal aides implicated as not being fully truthful on
lie-detector tests administered during investigations of
Justice Department leaks.</p>
<p>Both Mr. Barr's defense lawyer and Sen. Arlen Specter (R.,
Pa.) have called for appointment of a special independent
prosecutor in the Barr case to avoid conflicts of interest.
Mr. Thornburgh hasn't officially responded but isn't expected
to comply with the requests.</p>
<p>Lawyers familiar with the case said they believe Mr. Barr
is the highest-ranking U.S. law enforcement official ever
charged with a drug offense.</p>

<p>LIABILITY CRISIS seen by lawyers at small firms, survey
finds.</p>
<p>The majority of lawyers surveyed by Lawyers Alert, a
Boston trade publication, feel that the legal system is too
complex and generates excessive litigation. But they don't
support any current reform proposals, the survey found.</p>
<p>Five hundred plaintiff and defense lawyers practicing in
law firms of nine or fewer attorneys participated in the
study.</p>
<p>According to the survey, 61% of the lawyers oppose federal
legislation to create a uniform national system for product
liability cases, 60% oppose limiting personal injury damages,
and 69% oppose statutes limiting the liability of doctors,
which have been enacted in many states.</p>
<p>The lawyers were split on only one issue: 47% of the
lawyers said they favor no changes in medical malpractice
laws, while 41% said damages should be made easier to recover
from doctors.</p>

<p>LEGAL SERVICES Corp. chooses former ethics chief as new
president.</p>
<p>David Martin, director of the Office of Government Ethics
during the Reagan administration, was chosen to lead the
controversial poverty-law organization, which is funded by
the federal government.</p>
<p>Chairman George Wittgraf said Mr. Martin "has strong
credentials both as a lawyer and as an administrator" with
extensive experience in government.</p>
<p>But Caroline Stewart, spokeswoman for the National Legal
Aid and Defender Association, an advocacy organization for
legal aid, said: "We really don't know that much about him.
He has no discernible legal experience in legal services."</p>
<p>Mr. Martin assumes the presidency of LSC at a time when it
is the focus of considerable controversy. Among the issues
currently being debated in Congress are whether the
organization should continue to participate in redistricting
suits and whether a current prohibition against litigating
abortion suits should remain in place.</p>
<p>After leaving the Reagan administration, Mr. Martin was
affiliated with the Washington office of Porter, Wright,
Morris & Arthur, a Columbus, Ohio, law firm. Since last year
he has had a solo law practice in Washington. He is expected
to assume office in September.</p>

<p>GOING GREEN: Hannoch Weisman, a 150-lawyer firm in
Roseland, N.J., is abandoning traditional yellow legal pads.
From now on the firm will use white pads. Sanders M.
Chattman, chairman of Hannoch's 20-lawyer environmental
department, said that when the law firm started participating
in a recycling program, they learned that the yellow dye in
the pads made the cost of recycling prohibitive. One added
benefit is that white legal pads cost less.</p>
