	<p class="article-leader">This will be a busy week for Donald J. Trump, who it now
appears will spend the rest of 1990 negotiating with bankers,
contractors and bondholders to keep his shaky empire afloat.
   Today, he plans to hire First Boston Corp. to organize a
restructuring of $1.3 billion in casino bonds, the developer
has told several individuals.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Tomorrow, he is scheduled to sign the first closing
documents on a $65 million loan that gives his bankers second
mortgages on his most valuable properties, and gives him
three to five years to pay interest on nearly half of his $2
billion in bank debt.</p>
<p>He is also soon expected to name a chief financial officer
to oversee his operations. That job has already been offered
to Stephen F. Bollenbach, Promus Cos. chief financial
officer.</p>
<p>"But I will still be the top guy, don't forget that," Mr.
Trump said in a brief telephone interview.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Trump still hasn't come to an agreement
with contractors that helped build the Taj Mahal and say that
they're owed about $80 million. The contractors have
threatened to force Mr. Trump into bankruptcy proceedings if
an agreement isn't reached shortly.</p>
<p>But Mr. Trump's biggest challenge is expected to be
persuading his bondholders to forgo interest payments in
exchange for equity in his casinos. Unlike the banks, the
bondholders' loans are fully secured by first mortgages on
the properties, which means if Mr. Trump fails to make
interest payments, they could end up owning the casinos.</p>
<p>First Boston's task will be to prepare an acceptable
proposal to bondholders, many of whom have already informally
organized committees to challenge Mr. Trump. A conference
call for bondholders organized by First Executive Life, an
insurance company that owns Trump casino bonds, is scheduled
for today, says a participant.</p>
<p>First Boston apparently wasn't Mr. Trump's first choice.
This past week, Merrill Lynch & Co. abruptly stopped working
on the restructuring, which put pressure on Mr. Trump to come
up with a new investment adviser quickly.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump must have a restructuring plan approved by Nov.
15, which is when he is scheduled to make a $47 million
interest payment to holders of junk bonds secured by the Taj
Mahal casino. The property isn't believed to be making enough
money to meet its debt service and had a $14.7 million pretax
operating loss in the second quarter.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump already has a comfortable working relationship
with several First Boston officials. Casino analyst Daniel
Lee, a former Drexel Burnham Lambert analyst who has been a
vocal booster of Mr. Trump's Taj Mahal casino, has in the
past discussed working for Mr. Trump, according to several
individuals familiar with the discussions. William Jacobs, a
First Boston bankruptcy specialist, got to know Mr. Trump
when Mr. Jacobs represented holders of Resorts International
bonds in negotiations with Mr. Trump last year. Mr. Jacobs
was working for Prudential-Bache Securities.</p>
<p>Both Mr. Lee and Mr. Jacobs met with Trump officials about
a bond restructuring last week, people familiar with the
situation said. Mr. Lee did not return phone calls. Mr.
Jacobs declined to comment.</p>
<p>People familiar with Mr. Trump's bank deal say it makes
allowances for his Atlantic City, N.J., casinos' poor
showing. One person who has read the thousands of pages of
documents cementing the bank arrangement said that a default
on the bank loans wouldn't necessarily be triggered if Mr.
Trump defaults on payments due his bondholders.</p>
<p>However, this person added, should Mr. Trump be forced to
give up any of his casinos it would still imperil the $65
million bank deal because that arrangement calls for banks to
hold a second mortgage on the Trump Plaza casino.</p>
