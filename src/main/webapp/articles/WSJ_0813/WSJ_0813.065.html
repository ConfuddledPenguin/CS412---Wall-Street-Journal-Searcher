	<p class="article-leader">UPPER SADDLE RIVER, N.J. (AP) -- Western Union Corp. on
Saturday locked out 2,000 employees in the middle of contract
talks with their union.
   The company did not indicate whether the workers would be
rehired if it signs a new contract with their union, the
Communications Workers of America, which represents a total
of 2,500 workers at Western Union.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Western Union said the replacements would not affect its
money-transfer, telex, electronic mail and paper-based
message services.</p>
<p>"We sincerely regret that, in the absence of a union
contract, we have reluctantly had to take this defensive
action," said Robert J. Amman, Western Union president and
chief executive officer. "We cannot operate under the
ever-present threat of an employee strike while continuing to
bear the cost required to ensure that the company would
survive one."</p>
<p>Western Union has a total of 3,400 employees. The CWA
represents operators, customer relations clerks, clerical
workers and field technicians.</p>
<p>Dan Beckstead, the chief union negotiator, deplored the
lockout, saying the union had not given the company any
indication it intends to strike.</p>
<p>"In fact, we told them we wanted to continue to negotiate
in an attempt to reach an agreement," Mr. Beckstead said. CWA
workers have authorized their leadership to call a strike.</p>
<p>Western Union said many of the replaced CWA workers were
from its central telephone bureaus in Bridgeton, Miss., and
Reno, Nev.; its computer centers in Middletown, Va., and
Bridgeton.</p>
<p>It temporarily replaced them with workers from Western
Union headquarters and trained temporary replacements, the
company said.</p>
<p>The company has been negotiating with representatives of
the CWA since July 23. The previous two-year contract expired
Aug. 6, but management and union negotiators have continued
to meet to try to agree on a new pact.</p>
