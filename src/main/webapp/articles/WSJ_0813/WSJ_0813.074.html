	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Economists remain divided over whether the
economy is entering a recession. Forecasters who believe a
recession is at hand have increased sharply since Iraq
invaded Kuwait. However, most analysts still look for
recession-free but very sluggish growth in coming months.
Forty-nine economists polled late last week by Blue Chip
Economic Indicators, a newsletter, on average expect the
economy to expand at annual rates of 1.4% this quarter and
0.9% next quarter, with brisker, accelerating gains in 1991.
   It is too early to know whether the Blue Chip consensus is
right. Much will depend on events in the Middle East and
their impact on oil prices. It is not too soon, however, to
try to gauge economic developments if the consensus is wrong
and a recession takes hold.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>If a new recession is arriving, these developments very
likely will be full-blown by the time the recession is
plainly evident. The 1973-75 recession began in November
1973, but as late as August 1974 Arthur F. Burns, the Federal
Reserve chairman, was assuring Congress that the economy was
expanding.</p>
<p>The National Bureau of Economic Research, the official
arbiter of when recessions start and end, bases its calls on
dozens of statistics, many of which appear months after the
fact and then are revised and revised. The economy can be in
a recession a year or more by the time the nonprofit group
announces the fact.</p>
<p>While recessions are hard to spot, they also can be hard
to stop. There is a widespread assumption that a prompt
easing of the monetary reins by the Federal Reserve will
prevent or mitigate an incipient recession. But monetary
policy is a blunt, slow-acting tool.</p>
<p>In the 1981-82 recession, which began in July 1981, the
money supply -- broadly defined to include most savings and
adjusted for inflation -- started to expand at the very start
of the recession and continued to do so. Yet, the slump
persisted for 16 months and brought the highest joblessness
of the post-World War II era. Moreover, most interest rates
fell throughout the 1981-82 recession. Over its course, the
average prime rate of banks dropped from nearly 21% to less
than 12% and the average yield on new issues of high-grade
corporate bonds fell from nearly 17% to about 12%. There were
similar trends in earlier recessions.</p>
<p>If a recession sets in, the federal budget deficit,
already huge and growing, will probably increase sharply,
whatever happens in the Middle East. This invariably has
occurred in recent recessions. It reflects two recessionary
patterns: rising relief spending as unemployment spreads and
declining tax revenues as incomes erode.</p>
<p>As the 1981-82 recession began, the budget deficit was
running at an annual rate of about $50 billion and when the
recession ended the deficit rate topped $200 billion. When
the 1973-75 recession started, the deficit rate was under $2
billion and when it ended the rate exceeded $8 billion. A
fourfold increase in the current budget deficit would push
the level of red ink up close to $800 billion, a daunting
amount.</p>
<p>The civilian unemployment rate climbed to 5.5% last month
from 5.2% in June. Though the rise was considerable, far
sharper increases are probable if a recession sets in. The
jobless rate rose from about 7% to nearly 11% over the course
of the 1981-82 recession and from less than 5% to about 9%
during the 1973-75 slump.</p>
<p>While unemployment invariably rises over the course of a
recession, corporate profits typically decline sharply. In
the 1981-82 recession, after-tax profits fell nearly 30% to
an annual rate of $104 billion.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, share prices also declined, but only in
the first year of the recession. With the approach of
economic recovery, the stock market turned up and in fact was
generally higher at the end of the recession than at its
start. The stock market, it should be added, is among the key
leading indicators that forecasters monitor to anticipate
turning points in the business cycle.</p>
<p>Recessions vary greatly in length and severity. There have
been eight since World War II. The average length comes to 11
months, but the range runs from 16 months down to six. At the
end of the 10-month recession of 1953-54, the unemployment
rate was as low as 5.9%, compared to 10.8% at the end of the
far longer 1981-82 slump.</p>
<p>There appears to be no clear relationship between the
magnitude of each period of economic expansion and the
subsequent recession. The 1981-82 recession followed a feeble
expansion that lasted only 12 months, the shortest in 60
years. The recession of 1969-70 lasted 11 months and the
unemployment rate was only 5.9% when the slump hit bottom.
Yet, the preceding expansion endured 106 months, longer than
any other upturn in the business cycle's 136-year history.</p>
<p>Economists disagree over how severe a new recession would
be, if one materializes. The Middle East remains a huge
imponderable, but other considerations can be weighed.
Forecasters who anticipate at worst a modest slump tend to
discount the depressing effect of debt levels and voice
confidence in the Fed's ability to induce recovery promptly.
Analysts who foresee a severe downturn generally worry more
about debt and place less faith in the Fed's efficacy.</p>
<p>The record, on balance, seems to support the more
pessimistic view. So let us hope -- but by no means assume --
that the recession-free consensus of the Blue Chip
forecasters is correct.</p>
