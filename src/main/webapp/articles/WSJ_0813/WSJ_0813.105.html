	<p class="article-leader">EL PASO, Texas -- Farah Inc. predicted the company would
prevail in a proxy battle with former chairman William F.
Farah.
   The company made its prediction after a surprisingly
anticlimactic special shareholder meeting Friday, called by
Mr. Farah to consider his demand that seven of the company's
nine board members be ousted. A company counterproposal
sought the removal of Mr. Farah and longtime associate
Charles C. Wood as directors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While preliminary results won't be disclosed until later
this week, the company said it has enough votes to defeat Mr.
Farah. A spokesman for Shareholders Communications Inc., Mr.
Farah's New York proxy solicitation firm, insisted the vote
was too close to call.</p>
<p>Officials also indicated the company expects to report a
third-quarter loss; results are expected to be disclosed in
two weeks. In the six months ended April 30, Farah had a net
loss of $2 million, or 32 cents a share, on sales of $59.9
million. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
Friday, Farah fell to $2.875, down 62.5 cents.</p>
<p>If the company prevails, it would mark the end of Mr.
Farah's 53-year career at the apparel manufacturing company
founded by his parents. Throughout his tumultuous, 25-year
reign as chief executive officer, Mr. Farah had outlasted
several potential successors, including his oldest son James,
and survived one previous ouster backed by the company's
creditors.</p>
