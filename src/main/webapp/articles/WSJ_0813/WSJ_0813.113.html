	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Riggs National Corp. acquired most of the
assets and deposits of the National Bank of Washington for a
$33 million premium after federal regulators declared the
bank insolvent and closed it.
   National Bank of Washington was a unit of Washington
Bancorp., Washington, D.C., which filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection Aug. 1.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the agreement with the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., Riggs National Bank assumed about $1 billion in
deposits and will purchase about $1.1 billion in assets,
mostly loans.</p>
<p>FDIC will retain about $500 million of "adversely
classified" assets and may be forced to keep certain other
loans, Riggs said.</p>
<p>Separately, the Treasury Department said it fined National
Bank of Washington $368,000 for money laundering just before
the bank was closed. The Treasury said that the bank failed
to report currency transactions as required under the Bank
Secrecy Act. In 1988, former bank senior vice president Roger
Schultz pleaded guilty to several violations under the
secrecy act.</p>
