	<p class="article-leader">While it may spell economic distress for much of the
industrialized world, the Persian Gulf crisis is money in the
bank for the Soviet Union.
   According to Western experts, the surge in the prices of
gold and oil -- two of Russia's biggest foreign-currency
earners -- could inject as much as an extra $7.25 billion a
year into the Soviet economy if the crisis persists. The
windfalls came just as the Soviet Union was teetering on the
brink of a record trade deficit and was digging deeply into
its emergency gold reserves.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It's as though someone has been listening to {Soviet
leader Mikhail} Gorbachev's prayers," says Marshall Goldman,
head of the Russian Research Center at Harvard University. He
has been among the most pessimistic experts on the longevity
of the reform-minded Soviet leader's regime.</p>
<p>In addition, notes Mr. Goldman, the Soviet Union is likely
to have a record grain harvest of some 260 million metric
tons this fall, 23 million tons higher than the previous
record, meaning the country could cut the amount of food
normally imported from abroad.</p>
<p>"The prospect for Soviet finances is fundamentally
changing," says Jan Vanous, director of PlanEcon Inc., a
Washington research firm that tracks the Soviet and Eastern
European economies. He and Mr. Goldman estimate that the
Soviet Union gains $1 billion from each dollar increase in a
barrel of crude oil because crude and other price-related
exports, such as natural gas, coke, electricity and coal,
bring in more than two-thirds of the Soviet Union's hard
currency. So far, the gulf crisis has kicked up the price of
oil to around $25 a barrel from $18 in world spot markets.</p>
<p>Gold exports may bring in an additional $250 million a
year, resulting from a 7% increase since late July, when
tensions in the gulf began propelling the metal's price
upward. Roger Robinson Jr., who formerly studied Soviet
financial dealings as a staff member of President Reagan's
National Security Council, believes Soviet gold traders may
have actually helped trigger the rise by pulling out of the
gold markets, where the Soviets had been "dumping their
strategic reserves."</p>
<p>In recent months, he believes, the Soviets have been
selling more than their annual production of gold to keep
afloat. In 1989, according to Mr. Goldman, the Soviet Union
had a $3 billion trade deficit, three times more than the
previous year. "Those kind of statistics show you why they
haven't been able to pay their debts," says Mr. Goldman.</p>
<p>While the new cash has been pouring in, however, Soviet
leaders have suggested that they may play a larger military
role with the West in the crisis, even to the point of
sending troops to Saudi Arabia if the U.N. sanctions a
multinational force there as a way to stem the crisis.</p>
<p>That would literally be lining up against their own
economic interest. Not only would the Soviet Union be acting
to ease the revenue-producing panic in the markets; the
country's soldiers would be facing one of the Soviet Union's
biggest export customers.</p>
<p>The Soviet-made Iraqi tanks parked on Kuwait's border
aren't paid for yet. Iraq owes the Russians almost $6 billion
for weapons and has been paying for them in oil at the
equivalent of $1 billion a year, according to Mr. Goldman.
"They'll probably lose that," he adds.</p>
<p>"The bigger bargain they {the Soviets} are looking for is
probably more help and aid from the West," suggests Charles
Wolf Jr., director of Rand Corp.'s research in international
economics. "So if they're a responsible player in the
international peace-keeping domain, presumably their
prospects for getting more government support from the West
will be stronger."</p>
<p>Because of the peculiar economic climate of Eastern
Europe, the sunshine for the Soviets means gloom for their
former satellites, which once imported oil from the Soviet
Union at a subsidized price of around $7 a barrel.</p>
<p>"The East bloc is terrible. The Soviets have stopped their
oil deliveries, preferring to sell to hard-currency
customers," explains Mr. Vanous. Recently, he says, the
situation in Czechoslovakia became so desperate that the
government began pumping from the Warsaw Pact's strategic
reserves of diesel oil, normally reserved to fuel tanks in a
military crisis. "They just raided it."</p>
