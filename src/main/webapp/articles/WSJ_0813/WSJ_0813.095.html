	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- Massachusetts, responding to rising fuel prices
in the wake of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, adopted emergency
regulations to protect consumers from price-gouging in sales
of gasoline and other petroleum products.
   The regulations, which will be in effect for the next 90
days, make it "an unfair act or practice for a petroleum
related business to charge an unconscionably high price for
petroleum products during any market emergency." They define
gouging as a "gross disparity" in the price of petroleum
products immediately before and after a market emergency that
isn't "substantially attributable to additional costs imposed
by suppliers." The regulations carry a civil penalty of
$5,000 for each violation.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The regulations were put in place by Massachusetts
Attorney General James M. Shannon under the state's Consumer
Protection Act. Mr. Shannon called the rules "essential
safeguards in dealing with this crisis. I am in no way
prejudging the situation, but I want to put these oil
companies on notice that in Massachusetts we're watching, and
that we will take whatever action we can to stop
price-gouging."</p>
<p>He added that officials from the U.S. Justice Department
and the Federal Trade Commission have agreed to meet with him
and other attorneys general on Aug. 20 in Washington to
discuss the issue.</p>
