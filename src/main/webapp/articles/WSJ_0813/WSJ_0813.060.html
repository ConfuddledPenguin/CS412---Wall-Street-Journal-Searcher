	<p class="article-leader">The watchdogs of progress and enlightenment have been
quite busy of late, snarling at the war on drugs, and
sneering at its adherents. Take, for example, the recent
Herblock howler -- a cartoon showing drug chief William J.
Bennett in full martial regalia, about to lead troops in an
armed assault on the patients of a drug-rehabilitation
center.
   Among the other anti-drug war warriors, count the
advocates of "personal freedom," who would rather blame the
drug problem on everything from alienation to consumerism
rather than acknowledge how much permissiveness has to do
with the growth of this tragedy. Then there are the
progressives, who maintain that enforcement measures and a
war on drugs can't work. The only solution to drugs, they
argue, is to attack poverty and racism, itself a racist
notion suggesting that the minority poor have no will of
their own. An all-fronts war of condemnation, law enforcement
and neighborhood activism seems to have upset the agendas of
the enlightened. What was particularly upsetting about this
war to advanced thinkers was its emphasis of an old value
known as moral leadership.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yet drug czar Bennett soldiered on and behold, there are
now signs that the war may be having its effect. The major
reporting systems all indicate a drop in drug use for the
first time since the mid-1980s, when the drug epidemic began
spiraling out of control. Cocaine emergencies dropped off
sharply in 1989, according to data collected by the Drug
Abuse Warning Network (DAWN), the agency that monitors
hospital emergency rooms in major cities. Heroin emergencies
also fell, though to a lesser degree. While no single
indicator tells the whole story, the DAWN report is
significant because its data comes from centers of hard-core
drug use.</p>
<p>Perhaps more significantly, drugs have lost their old
luster among the young. According to the 1989 High School
Senior Survey, the already high rate of disapproval of drugs
continues to climb among high-school seniors. The
overwhelming majority of the students surveyed disapproved
not just of cocaine, moreover, but also of occasional
marijuana use. That response would surely have been
inconceivable a little over a decade ago.</p>
<p>The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse provided a
similar omen in its report of a 37% drop in drug use since
1985. What is particularly telling is that this survey
reports largely on middle-class drug consumption. The drug
epidemic can be said to have arrived, truly, when parents and
teachers, businessmen and bus drivers and other average
citizens embraced the notion of "recreational drugs." In
short order they became the dealers' best customers. If
middle-class Americans no longer buy the notion that drugs
are acceptable, we have turned a major corner in the war.</p>
<p>On the supply side, too, there are hopeful signs. Cocaine
prices have skyrocketed, while the purity level of the
available cocaine has dropped dramatically. Both are sure
signs of a disruption in supply. In Bolivia, coca farming has
become unprofitable, the direct result of harsh measures
lately taken both in Bolivia and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Colombian President Virgilio Barco deserves considerable
credit for his efforts. After the murder of a Colombian
presidential candidate, President Barco embarked on a program
of total war against traffickers, including massive arrests
and extraditions.</p>
<p>None of this is to say, of course, that the drug lords
have been destroyed. It is to say a hard line on law
enforcement can and clearly does work.</p>
<p>Charleston, South Carolina, saw that rule proved when
Police Chief Reuben Greenberg simply used round-the-clock
surveillance to force dealers from turf to turf, thus cutting
them off from their customers. When his men move in on an
operation, the chief told columnist William Raspberry, they
seize the furniture, the air conditioner, the phones, the
very chair the dealer sits on, so that he can't do business
the next day. Chief Greenberg's hard-line tactics have had a
dramatic effect on Charleston's crime rate, now lower by 45%.</p>
<p>In the crime-plagued cities, the fervor against drugs and
dealers mounts. None of this, again, is to say that victory
is at hand. It is to note real progress in the war on drugs.
A most important sign of that progress is the perception, in
inner cities as elsewhere, that drug users are losers.</p>
<p>When rock stars and other beautiful people began to flaunt
and glamorize drugs, they were also sending the catastrophic
signal that drugs were associated with power and status. The
deglamorization of drugs now in evidence among all classes of
our society is the best indication to date that the war
against drugs is winnable. In arguing these many years that
such a war could not be won, the naysayers failed to reckon
with the power of moral leadership, its insistence on
accountability, its distinction between right and wrong. If
we are seeing some rays of hope in the battle against drugs,
it is mainly thanks to the fact that that weapon has at last
been put to work.</p>
