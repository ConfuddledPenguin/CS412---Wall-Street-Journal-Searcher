	<p class="article-leader">BOULDER, Colo. -- Exabyte Corp. said it expects
third-quarter sales to "substantially exceed" the sales of
$23.9 million for the same period a year ago. But the company
said sales and net income for the third quarter will fall
below second-quarter results.
   For the second quarter, ended June 30, Exabyte reported
profit of $8 million, or 38 cents a share, on sales of $46.3
million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The maker of cartridge-tape systems said third-quarter
sales will be affected by excess inventory at certain
customers, seasonal slowness in the European market and a
general softening in the computer industry.</p>
