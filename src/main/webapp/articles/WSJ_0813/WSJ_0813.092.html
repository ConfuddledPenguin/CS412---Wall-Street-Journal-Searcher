	<p class="article-leader">HONOLULU -- Hawaiian Airlines said surcharges have
resulted in fare increases to compensate for higher fuel
costs, which have recently risen 17%.
   The cost of trans-Pacific flights increased $10 each way
and South Pacific routes will cost passengers $15 more each
way, the airline said. A fuel surcharge raised inter-island
flights $2.50 each way this past week.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The airline said it would resist increasing air fares as
much as 10%, as other airlines have done, in hopes that oil
prices will stabilize. The airline has 230 daily flights to
the West Coast, South Pacific islands and Australia.</p>
