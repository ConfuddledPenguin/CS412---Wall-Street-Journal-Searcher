	<p class="article-leader">Video telephones are finally catching on -- a mere quarter
of a century behind schedule.
   Prototypes were a hit at the 1964 World's Fair, prompting
people to jump way ahead of reality and start worrying about,
say, how to turn off the camera if they came running out of
the shower to answer the phone. But the technology wasn't
ready, and the economics never worked. Despite 20 years of
testing, the devices were never more than a novelty.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Now, however, several hundred video conferencing units are
in use around the world, and market researchers say the
market for video telecommunication equipment could reach more
than $100 million this year. They add that it could grow at
least 50% annually for the next several years.</p>
<p>At the moment, the video conferencing market is dominated
by two small companies, Compression Labs Inc., of San Jose,
Calif., and PictureTel Corp., of Peabody, Mass. Other, bigger
firms, such as the Bell companies, are likely to enter the
market as it grows, either with their own products or through
alliances.</p>
<p>Promoters of the technology are no longer using their
this-will-mean-the-end-of-life-as-we-know-it rhetoric. But
they do expect the technology to spread broadly through
businesses over the next decade, as it lands on many desktops
in some combination of personal computer and telephone. And
this time they may even be right.</p>
<p>"The market is just exploding unbelievably," says Al Lill,
who follows the video teleconferencing market for Gartner
Group Inc., a market-research firm.</p>
<p>Current systems are still clunky. If sold as a total
package, they can be as big as oversized refrigerators, with
a large television screen, camera and "codec," which
compresses the video for faster transmission over phone lines
and decompresses incoming signals. The systems also come with
microphones and a control panel.</p>
<p>Prices typically range from $65,000 to $80,000 for each
unit, steep enough to give pause to many businesses. But
prices have come way down, from around $500,000 in the
mid-1980s, and the systems have improved greatly. The images
produced by the codecs are far clearer than they were a few
years ago.</p>
<p>The phone companies have done their part to make the
technology easier and more affordable to use. In 1984, the
high-speed lines required for video conferences had to be
reserved well in advance, and they might cost $1,000 an hour.
Now, no warning is needed, and the lines may cost $15 an
hour, roughly what a normal long-distance line would cost.</p>
<p>Prices for the hardware are expected to continue plunging
-- as always seems to happen with new types of electronics.
Mr. Lill of Gartner Group predicts that the cost of a codec
will fall from $30,000 to $1,000 within three years,
suggesting that total systems could come in under $10,000.
Even if he's overly optimistic by a few years, that's still
the kind of price that would get lots of people to start
conversing face-to-image with their colleagues.</p>
<p>Even at the current prices, many users say the systems'
costs are justified by savings on travel. When First Chicago
Corp. bought a Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. business in New
York, it purchased conferencing systems from PictureTel.
First Chicago used the systems to help manage the takeover
and found itself saving so much on travel between Chicago and
New York that the systems paid for themselves within three
months.</p>
<p>When Air Products & Chemicals Inc. had a plant built in
Houston, it installed systems so that people at headquarters
in Allentown, Pa., could easily talk about changes in
blueprints and schedules with people at the plant site.
(Graphics can be printed out on paper and held in front of
the camera or sent directly from a personal computer into the
video conferencing equipment.)</p>
<p>Tom Hickey, manager of corporate communication services at
Air Products, says the system allowed for much faster
decisions, without travel. In the past, he says, significant
changes would have involved "repeated phone calls and
letters, and then probably a visit anyway."</p>
<p>Video telephones have proved useful even when
long-distance communication isn't necessary. San Diego County
installed a Compression Labs system when construction
temporarily left the courthouse 45 miles from jail. Rather
than transporting the judge or the prisoners back and forth,
the court used a video link.</p>
<p>Sears, Roebuck & Co. hasn't tried to quantify any savings
from its use of video conferencing but still has invested
heavily, because it feels that video improves the quality of
the communication. Sears has Compression Labs equipment in 43
rooms across the country, has 921 further rooms that can
review broadcasts from those rooms and has trained more than
8,000 people to use the equipment. Sears spokesmen say the
retailer is even looking to expand use of its network,
especially to talk to outsiders, such as suppliers.</p>
<p>That may be difficult because of an old bugaboo in
computers and electronics: compatibility. PictureTel systems
can talk to other PictureTel systems but not to Compression
Labs systems or those made by anyone else. And that won't
change until the industry agrees on standards.</p>
<p>An initial attempt at that should bear fruit this fall,
but that will just start to solve the problem. Standards tend
to be lowest common denominators, so each company's system
still will work best with a sister system, rather than some
other company's system.</p>
<p>In addition, the initial standard, called PX64, mainly
covers very high-speed transmissions, which offer a better
picture. But low-speed communication is the fastest-growing
part of the market. When transmissions occur at low speeds,
quick movement blurs the picture.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other bugs to work out, too. Although
the hardware is reliable these days, a recent demonstration
of a PictureTel system included an embarrassing 11 system
crashes in an hour.</p>
<p>More importantly, some intended uses may turn out not to
be practical. Some retailers, hoping to send fewer people on
clothes-buying trips, have found that a video link doesn't
replace being there to feel the cloth and see how it hangs on
a mannequin.</p>
<p>Video communication forecasts start to get fanciful again
when proponents talk about putting a system on every desktop,
but there has been some progress there, too. Harris Corp.
recently introduced personal-computer-based systems selling
for about $25,000 apiece. Some of the big semiconductor
companies are expected to produce chip sets over the next
year or two that could allow codecs to be produced on single
circuit boards, which could then be slipped into personal
computers.</p>
<p>It could well take years before the desktop situation
sorts itself out. The personal-computer types,
video-conferencing types and telephone-company types will
all, no doubt, think of these desktop systems as extensions
of their own technologies, and there could be a fight over
who controls the standards for how an image is displayed. As
sometimes happens in technological changes, some other
technological constituency might join in the fun, too.</p>
