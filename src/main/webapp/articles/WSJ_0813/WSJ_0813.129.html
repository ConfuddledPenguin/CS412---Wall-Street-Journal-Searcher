	<p class="article-leader">Interlake Corp. said that some tests of aerospace parts
produced by the company weren't performed properly. The
company said it is investigating and doesn't believe any of
the parts are unsafe.
   The testing problems occurred at a Cleveland plant
Interlake sold in May to Wyman-Gordon Co., which notified
Interlake about the testing deficiencies and corrected the
problem.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The plant makes fittings, brackets, manifolds, housings
and swirlers, which are used to mix fuel and air, and sells
these products "throughout the aerospace industry," a
spokesman said.</p>
<p>Interlake, based in Oak Brook, Ill., said that some tests
weren't handled properly and that some parts were welded
without customer approval. Interlake wouldn't identify the
customers, except the U.S. government, but said it has
informed them all. It said it also hired Arthur Andersen &
Co., the accounting firm, to review the investigation into
the problem.</p>
<p>The parts made at the plant sold for about $50 each, on
average, the spokesman said, and the plant produced annual
sales of between $8 million and $13 million while owned by
Interlake.</p>
