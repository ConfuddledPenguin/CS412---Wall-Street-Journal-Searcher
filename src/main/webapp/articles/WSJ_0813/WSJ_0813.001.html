	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Southmark Corp. said it emerged from Chapter 11
proceedings and began distributions to creditors and
shareholders under the reorganization plan approved last
month by a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge.
   In accordance with the plan, Southmark said it transferred
$76 million in cash along with new securities to various
agents on behalf of its creditors and shareholders. Holders
of old Southmark securities will receive their portions of
the cash, new notes, new preferred stock and new common stock
upon surrender of their old certificates.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As part of its reorganization plan under Chapter 11 of the
federal Bankruptcy Code, Southmark also transferred $100
million in assets to San Jacinto Savings Association, its
Houston-based thrift unit. The company said it won't have
management control of San Jacinto.</p>
<p>The thrift will be exempted from the planned liquidation
of most of Southmark's assets. The proceeds of the
liquidation will be used to redeem the new notes and new
preferred stock of the reorganized real estate and financial
services concern.</p>
<p>The company proposed deferring payment of some legal and
other professional fees incurred with its reorganization
until April 15, 1991, to maintain adequate working capital.
The deferral, agreed to by professionals in the case, total
about $8 million, the company said.</p>
<p>Southmark also said Glen Adams was named chairman,
president and chief executive officer. Mr. Adams, as
previously announced, succeeds Arthur G. Weiss, who resigned.</p>
<p>Mr. Adams previously managed the liquidation of Great
Western Sugar Co. and its subsidiaries. He has also held
senior positions at Texas Industries Inc. and Electronic Data
Systems Corp.</p>
<p>Eight of Southmark's 10 directors also resigned and will
be succeeded by directors to be nominated by the company's
unsecured creditors' committee. The company said the two
remaining directors, James A. Colquitt and Arthur L. Crowe,
agreed to remain in office for a transition period of about
one week.</p>
