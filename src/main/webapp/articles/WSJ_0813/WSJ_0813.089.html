	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- GTE Corp. formed a Telecommunications Products
& Services Group and named the chief of its mobile
communications business to head it.
   The group comprises four businesses: GTE Government
Systems, Information Services, Mobile Communications and
Spacenet. It will be headed by Terry S. Parker, president of
Houston-based GTE Mobile Communications.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Parker, 45 years old, has also been named to the
company's policy committee and may end up supervising several
business units of Contel Corp., which is merging with GTE.</p>
<p>A spokesman said GTE made the appointment in part to
relieve Charles R. Lee, GTE's president and chief operating
officer, who had supervisory responsibility for the units now
in Mr. Parker's group.</p>
<p>"This will give Chuck more time to work on strategic
planning and work more closely with {GTE chairman James L.
Johnson} on corporate vision, direction and culture," the
spokesman said.</p>
<p>Mr. Parker will run Mobile Communications until a
successor is found.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a federal judge in Boston set aside a jury
verdict against GTE Products Corp., including damages of
$15.9 million awarded to Cool Light Co., Hollywood, Calif.</p>
<p>Cool Light, a maker of television studio lights that
generate less heat than conventional units, alleged that GTE
Products breached a contract to manufacture parts of Cool
Light's product and instead produced its own version of the
light.</p>
<p>However, Judge John J. McNaught questioned the logic of
the June 29 verdict and ordered a new trial. Cool Light was
unavailable for comment.</p>
