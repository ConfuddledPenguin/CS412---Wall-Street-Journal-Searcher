	<h3>Commodities: Lower Coffee Prices Expected as Brazil's Backlog Hits Market, Crowding Central American Harvest</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">As the old song said, there's a lot of coffee in Brazil.
And it could hit the market this fall, swamping prices.
   Brazil currently isn't shipping as much coffee as it
normally does, so the beans are piling up. Moreover, this
backlog will be swollen by the crop now being harvested, says
one veteran U.S. coffee dealer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The result, he says, is that Brazil will have to sell its
coffee just when Central American production will also be
coming to market -- meaning that prices could drop sharply.</p>
<p>The nearby futures contract on the New York Coffee, Sugar
& Cocoa Exchange closed Friday at 93.5 cents a pound, up from
85 cents in mid-July but below this year's high of $1.05 in
March.</p>
<p>Usually, prices of green unroasted coffee beans rise in
the fall as roasters buy supplies for the peak winter
coffee-drinking season. However, these buyers already have
ample supplies, so they might not be eager to load up and
push prices higher. Instead, they're expected to buy what
they need and allow prices to remain under pressure from
mounting supplies.</p>
<p>Brazil is harvesting coffee for its 1990-91 season, which
began July 1. Estimates of its output range from 22 million
to 30 million 132-pound bags.</p>
<p>"Let's say production amounts to 25 million bags," the
veteran coffee dealer says. "Add 17 million bags the
government has in store which were bought by the IBC {the
Brazilian Coffee Institute, a government agency that used to
supervise the coffee industry but was eliminated by the
current government} and you have 42 million bags."</p>
<p>Add in about six million bags left over from the 1989-90
season that farmers and exporters had on hand as the new
season began, and Brazil will have about 48 million bags
available for sale. From this, deduct about eight million
bags for domestic use. In addition, about five million bags
from the former IBC stocks probably can't be shipped because
of quality problems.</p>
<p>However, these non-exportable coffees can be used within
Brazil, and "every one of these bags used internally
liberates an exportable bag for sale abroad," the dealer
says. So, figuring conservatively, Brazil will have about 36
million bags of exportable coffee.</p>
<p>"Since July 1, only 3.5 million bags of coffee have been
registered in Brazil for shipment through Dec. 31," the
dealer says. Brazil historically has shipped about 16 million
bags a year to International Coffee Agreement member
countries, and in recent years it has been selling about two
million bags annually to consumer countries that aren't
members of the agreement, he says. The agreement's export
quotas were suspended in July 1989.</p>
<p>For Brazil to continue to export the 18 million bags it
has annually sold and maintain its 30% share of the world
market, the dealer says, "it has to sell like bandits."</p>
<p>Such heavy selling will come just as the harvest begins in
September in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and some other
Latin American producers. These countries don't have the kind
of storage capacity Brazil has, and they traditionally try to
sell out their harvests as quickly as possible. Currently,
their coffees are also in great demand. The Central American
nations, for example, are usually completely sold out by
March. These factors will create strong competition for
Brazil.</p>
<p>Colombia, the world's second largest producer, whose
harvest also begins in September, sells year-round. In the
first full International Coffee Organization year without
export quotas, which will end Sept. 30, Colombia is expected
to ship about 12 million bags, the dealer estimates. That
would be about three million more than it sold under ICO
quotas. In addition, its 1990-91 crop is expected to amount
to around 13 million bags, "so it can be expected to continue
to sell in quantity from its new crop," the dealer says.
Colombian coffee, regarded as one of the best in the world,
is always in strong demand, he says.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, buyers won't exactly be starved for coffee.
Green coffee inventories in the U.S. amount to about 6.2
million bags, one dealer says, more than twice the average of
2.5 to three million bags over the past 15 to 20 years.</p>
<p>These stocks include those held by importers, dealers,
roasters and in warehouses of the Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa
Exchange in New York. The exchange's stocks alone amount to
2.2 million bags, "a huge figure," according to the dealer.
"This is indicative of the inability of roasters to absorb
all the coffee that's available," he says. In Europe, about
9.2 million bags are on hand, which industry sources think is
too much coffee at the start of a new season, the dealer
says.</p>
<p>From time to time, the industry expresses hope that the
ICO export quotas will be reinstated, which would push prices
higher, the dealer notes. However, Brazil, the biggest
producer, is against restoring the quotas, as are the Central
American countries. Brazil and Central America together
account for about 60% of world coffee production, and they
have the voting power to prevent the quotas' restoration.
Most consuming countries are also against reinstatement of
the quotas, so fiercely competitive selling can be expected
to continue for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week:</p>
<p>Precious Metals</p>
<p>Prices surged Friday and are expected to continue rising
along with any increased tensions in the Middle East.</p>
<p>The highest prices of the day were posted in the closing
minutes. "A close of this nature in heavy volume portends a
bull market with further gains," said one analyst.</p>
<p>December delivery gold ended $11.10 an ounce higher at
$405.90, the highest price since April 16. December silver
gained 12 cents an ounce to $5.11. October platinum was up
$9.40 an ounce to $496.30.</p>
<p>"This was the first time since June that silver and
platinum have joined gold in a strong rally," said David A.
Poole, vice president and chief economist for International
Investors Inc., a New York-based gold mutual fund.</p>
<p>The advances were triggered by news reports of
disagreements at the Arab conference in Cairo and a call by
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein for Arab unity against U.S.
and other Western forces, analysts said.</p>
<p>Energy</p>
<p>Crude oil and gasoline prices rose Friday, though the
movement was small compared with the huge swings earlier in
the week. Generally traders were avoiding taking large
positions so they wouldn't be overtaken by events over the
weekend. The market-moving news Friday was Baghdad's call for
a "holy war" against foreign troops in Saudi Arabia. Some
market participants said the call heightened tensions, while
others said it was mainly rhetoric. Crude for September
delivery rose 56 cents a barrel to $26.23 on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. September gasoline went up 3.03 cents to
79.45 cents a gallon. Separately, U.S. Deputy Energy
Secretary Henson Moore, who met with several oil producers
last week, said they may produce an extra 50,000 barrels of
oil a day from Alaskan oil fields starting in two or three
weeks. This month, the trans-Alaska pipeline transported an
average of 1.79 million barrels of oil products a day.</p>
<p>Grains and Soybeans</p>
<p>The export picture is looking grimmer.</p>
<p>Good growing conditions are generating large crops in
China and the Soviet Union that will probably reduce their
demand for U.S. crops.</p>
<p>At the same time, two markets for U.S. crops have
effectively dried up: Iraq and Kuwait.</p>
<p>If a U.S. embargo against Iraq is effective, farmers would
lose a market that annually imported between $700 million and
$800 million in U.S. agricultural goods. According to a trade
source, a vessel holding U.S. sunflower oil originally bound
for Iraq was unloaded last week in a Gulf of Mexico port.</p>
<p>The Kuwait market has also evaporated. Although it isn't a
major purchaser of U.S. crops, as recently as July it had
arranged for the shipment of U.S. wheat as food aid for
Egypt.</p>
<p>All this is expected to further depress wheat and corn
prices, which were already skidding.</p>
<p>Wheat prices have fallen to their lowest levels in about
four years because the harvest, which is mostly complete, is
about 33% larger than last year's poor crop, and stockpiles
are building.</p>
<p>Corn prices have slipped nearly 50 cents a bushel, or
about 15%, since June as good growing weather improved the
prospects for a strong harvest. September corn was unchanged
Friday at $2.5025 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.</p>
