	<p class="article-leader">MILWAUKEE -- Badger Meter Inc. said it scheduled a special
shareholders meeting for Sept. 18 to vote on a proposal to
allow seven corporate officers to become holders of the
company's Class B shares, which have so-called super-voting
rights.
   Until now, only existing Class B holders could buy Class B
shares as they became available. The maker of flow
measurement products, which has about 562,785 B shares
outstanding, said the proposal doesn't involve the issuance
of new B shares.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The B shares have 10 votes a share vs. one vote for
regular common.</p>
<p>The proposal, the company said, is aimed at increasing its
ability to "attract and retain high quality officers." The
proposal covers only the top seven officers.</p>
