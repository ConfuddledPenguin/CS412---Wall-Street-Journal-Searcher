	<p class="article-leader">STILLWATER, Minn. -- Emil Johnson isn't a typical tree
lover.
   The 53-year-old, his arm tattooed with a wolf howling at
the moon, daintily snips needles from a potted Juniper. Four
years ago, the tree was scraggly and four-feet tall. Now, it
reaches only a foot and is shaped like one of the Great
Pyramids at Giza.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Johnson is practicing the Oriental art of "bonsai" --
pruning and shaping trees until they become miniature
sculptures. "It's never finished," he muses.</p>
<p>This is probably a good thing.</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson is serving a 40-year sentence at the Minnesota
Correctional Institute in Stillwater, one of the state's two
maximum security prisons. In 1964, Mr. Johnson robbed, then
killed, a 22-year-old service-station attendant. "The man
kicked me, and I shot him," says Mr. Johnson.</p>
<p>Today, he is a member of the Stillwater Prison Bonsai
Society -- a select group of murderers and armed robbers who
toil in a prison-yard greenhouse, where flowers bloom and
trees take root. One convict gently bends a branch and coils
a wire around it to keep it crooked. Another snips off buds.
Their bonsai are in various stages of a training that may
last decades.</p>
<p>Bonsai came to Stillwater four years ago, when inmate
Billy Dye plucked a Time/Life bonsai guide from a pile of
donated books. Intrigued, he practiced on trees that grew
between the cracks in the prison's sidewalks. Then one day,
with the guarded consent of the warden, Mr. Dye called the
president of the Minnesota Bonsai Society.</p>
<p>"It was weird," recalls Randy Clark, the group's
past-president. "He asked me, `Does bonsai take a long time?
Is it something you can do in a confined space?' I said,
`Yeah,' and he said, `How would you like to teach bonsai to a
crazy bunch of convicts.' I thought, `Oh, God. Criminals
doing the gentle art of bonsai, what next?'"</p>
<p>From humble beginnings -- a handful of inmates working
with Mr. Clark and using clumsy plastic scissors -- grew a
close-knit group of avid horticulturists. Two years ago, the
prison gardeners won five ribbons in the novice class at the
Minnesota State Fair bonsai show. A year later, they snagged
seven. The society also exhibited at a Mother's Day show in
1988, and again this year.</p>
<p>The group of 15 -- the maximum number the bonsai
greenhouse can accommodate -- includes 13 murderers and two
armed robbers, perhaps the reason they can't personally
attend the Mother's Day shows or the state fairs. The
society's president, Tim Eling, killed an off-duty police
officer. Mr. Dye, who is 5-feet-5 and called the "Runt
Treeman of Stillwater," (a la the "Birdman of Alcatraz"),
murdered a 24-year-old pizzeria employee.</p>
<p>Because recruits must be sponsored by an existing member,
then passed on by a two-thirds vote and approved by the
society's two sponsors on the prison staff, members have
virtual control over who gets in. Mostly, it's their friends.
Mostly, they're white. Sex offenders who've abused children,
about 20% of the inmate population, are not welcome. They are
shunned prison-wide.</p>
<p>With membership come some elements of style -- and
freedom. Members have business cards emblazoned with their
logo: a bonsai tree with a broken chain hanging from the
tree. They have stationery that lists their officers. And for
as many as 50 hours each week, they have the chance to toil
in a thermostat-controlled oasis where ceiling fans whirl.</p>
<p>In the greenhouse, a rescued cowbird egg sits on a wooden
plank under the warmth of a light bulb. "I will give every
effort for its survival," says one of the society's newest
initiates, Jamie Maxwell, who is serving time for
third-degree murder.</p>
<p>By contrast, the prison is an ancient stone building
situated on a woodland bluff along the St. Croix River near
the Wisconsin border. Two pairs of cell blocks flank the
sterile hallway that strips through the prison. The dark,
noisy cell blocks each have four tiers of cages, each cage
measuring 6-by-10-feet.</p>
<p>"This is totally an escape," Mr. Dye says of life amid the
bonsai. "This is ours as much as anything can be in here."
With the exception of volunteer teachers, outsiders aren't
welcome.</p>
<p>The group boasts that it hasn't had a single greenhouse
assault. (Mr. Dye was accused of hitting a fellow inmate with
a birdhouse, for which he spent time in the "hole," or
solitary confinement. But that incident happened in the
cellblock.) Tools -- wire cutters, branch cutters and branch
benders -- are carefully checked in and out. None has been
stolen. Members know that the smallest infraction could put
an end to their society.</p>
<p>Still, the prisoners are not without their differences.
They bicker when they can't find one of their trees and think
another inmate has moved it. They grumble when they think a
piece of copper wire has been stolen from their trees. They
rib Mr. Dye about hogging the pay phone to lobby bonsai
boosters for donations.</p>
<p>Generally though, arguments concern aesthetics. Mr. Dye is
a strict traditionalist -- using an understated planter,
eschewing geegaws. Mr. Johnson breaks the rules. He lays a
mirror below one tree to simulate a lake. He plants another
bonsai in a slice of tree trunk he painted with shiny
polyurethane. Some prisoners put tiny ceramic oxen in their
planters. Others favor figurines of pagodas and Chinese men
wearing coolie hats.</p>
<p>Mr. Dye had a running tiff with former inmate Karta Singh
over matters of style -- which way to bend a tree branch, for
example -- and substance, whether a bonsai should be
fertilized. They entered their trees at the state fair. Mr.
Dye won a red ribbon. Mr. Singh one-upped him with a blue.
But the bickering didn't end until Mr. Singh was released.</p>
<p>The inmates' bonsai are considered among the neatest at
shows. "You won't find a single browned needle on their
trees," says Ann Erb, a bonsai volunteer. Occasionally,
though, they are forced to improvise. Last year, when they
couldn't get baby oil, normally used to buff planters into
show condition, they turned to motor oil. "The trees smelled
like a '57 Chevy," says Mr. Clark, the teacher.</p>
<p>Bonsai aren't suited to all aspects of prison life. When a
shipment of about 100 trees arrived one recent Friday,
officials searched them for hidden contraband. As a result,
bonsai members didn't get the trees until Monday. Half the
trees were dead.</p>
<p>Bonsai are also at risk during "shakedowns" -- when
officials conduct weapon searches and inmates are locked in
their cells 24 hours a day. During the last shakedown, Mike
Hermerding, a burly guard and a bonsai group sponsor,
surreptitiously tended the trees. "I rolled up my sleeves,
dug in, repotted the plants and washed my hands kind of like
nothing else had happened. I didn't want my peers to get it
on film," he says. When the inmates returned to the
greenhouses more than two weeks later, their beloved trees
were a little scruffy but alive.</p>
<p>This kind of dedication -- from prisoners and sponsors --
may soon pay off. A local greenhouse maker, Poly-Tex Inc.,
which has donated much of the bonsai equipment to Stillwater,
is negotiating with prison authorities to take the trees
public. Poly-Tex will pay inmates 50 cents to $4.50 per hour,
average for prison wages, to sculpt trees, which local
nurseries will then sell. Possible marketing pitches for the
trees: Hard Rock Bonsai, Hard Times Bonsai, Prison Blue
Bonsai and Ball and Chain Bonsai.</p>
<p>For the moment, though, inmates pursue their art. They
banter about whether to snip off a low branch on one tree.
Mr. Dye laments a recent loss. "Sometimes these things just
decide they're going to die," he says.</p>
<p>"You give it all this care. You've done everything right,"
he mulls. "It's like children. You feed 'em. You change its
diapers. You do everything. You give 'em everything in the
world, and the little bastards end up going to prison." He
laughs at the comparison.</p>
