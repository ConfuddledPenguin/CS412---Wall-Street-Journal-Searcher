	<p class="article-leader">CERRITOS, Calif. -- Cardis Corp., which late last year
emerged from its Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law reorganization,
reported that its fourth-quarter net loss narrowed to $1.1
million, or 11 cents a share, from a net loss of $13.8
million, or $1.26 a share, a year ago.
   The wholesale distributor of automotive parts, supplies,
and accessories, said improved operating results reflect
reduced interest expense since it was not charged on debt
deferred by its Chapter 11 bankruptcy.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Cardis said that the year-ago net loss included a loss
from discontinued operations of $4.1 million, an
extraordinary loss from debt restructuring and its
reorganization of $1.7 million, and a gain from an accounting
change of $3.7 million.</p>
<p>Cardis reported the loss on a 1.9% decline in sales to
$21.2 million from $21.6 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>For the year ended April 30, the company reported an
operating loss of $3 million, or 28 cents a share, compared
with an operating loss of $22.2 million, or $2.03 a share, a
year ago. In the current year, an extraordinary gain from
debt restructuring and reorganization of $67.9 million made
net income $64.9 million, or $5.92 a share. In the previous
year, a loss from discontinued operations of $5 million, an
extraordinary loss of $1.7 million, and a gain of $3.7
million from an accounting change, gave the company a net
loss of $25.3 million, or $2.31 a share.</p>
<p>Cardis reported a 9.5% drop in sales to $84.8 million from
last year's $93.7 million.</p>
