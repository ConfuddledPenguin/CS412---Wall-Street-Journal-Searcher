	<p class="article-leader">Commodore International Ltd., West Chester, Pa., posted a
net loss of $3.5 million, or 11 cents a share, for the fourth
quarter, ended June 30, as demand for its personal computers
remained lackluster.
   The loss represented an improvement over the year-earlier
loss of $8.9 million, or 28 cents a share, but much of the
difference was accounted for by the company's decision to
reduce by $10 million the amount it had set aside to cover
future tax payments. The operating loss in the latest quarter
was only somewhat narrower than in the year-earlier period --
$14 million compared with $16.7 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales rose 10% to $198.1 million from $180.3 million, but
Commodore said favorable foreign currency exchange rates
accounted for much of that gain. Unit sales of the Amiga
personal computer -- the machine on which Commodore has
staked its future -- climbed 40%. But unit sales of the
venerable C64 declined, as did sales of some IBM-compatible
machines.</p>
<p>Commodore said its results continued to be hurt by heavy
marketing expenses.</p>
<p>For the full fiscal year, Commodore posted a profit of
$1.5 million, or five cents a share, down 97% from a year
earlier.</p>
