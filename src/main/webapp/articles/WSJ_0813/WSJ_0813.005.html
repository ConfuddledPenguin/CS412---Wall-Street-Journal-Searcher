	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Don't look for Japanese investors to resume big
buying of U.S. Treasury bonds any time soon.
   Japan's institutional investors sharply curtailed their
usual bidding at the U.S. Treasury's $32.25 billion quarterly
securities auction last week, acquiring only a fraction of
the U.S. government debt they usually buy. Analysts warn that
if this trend continues, U.S. long-term interest rates aren't
likely to fall significantly, despite a slowing economy,
because the Treasury will be forced to offer fatter yields to
lure the Japanese back or attract other investors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At Thursday's sale of 30-year Treasury bonds, the final
segment of the three-part auction, Japanese investors
purchased between only 5% and 15% of the $10.26 billion of
bonds sold. That was down sharply from as much as 50% at some
previous 30-year bond auctions. It's a trend that analysts
and Japanese investors expect to persist.</p>
<p>"The Japanese have got all the dollars they need," said
Robert Alan Feldman, an economist with Salomon Brothers Inc.
in Tokyo. Besides, added Koichi Torihara, an international
investment manager at DaiIchi Kangyo Bank Ltd., the world's
largest bank: "It's not the right time to do long-term
investments."</p>
<p>The implications of Japan's waning hunger for Treasury
securities are important for the U.S. Without big Japanese
interest, "the bonds have to be bought by domestic
investors," said Scott Pardee, chairman of the U.S.
subsidiary of Yamaichi Securities Co. in New York. And now,
U.S. investors are demanding higher rates to compensate for
expectations of rising inflation, especially since oil prices
began soaring after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a big problem is that Americans don't save
enough to finance the federal budget deficit and U.S.
industry's needs. Analysts estimate the shortfall to be about
$100 billion. If foreigners don't pony up the difference,
U.S. long-term rates will have to rise sufficiently to
attract U.S. and foreign investors.</p>
<p>"To the extent that our savings can't cover our fiscal
deficit, the savings and loan bailout, the state budget
deficits and the legitimate needs of U.S. industry, then our
rates are going to have to go up," said Mr. Pardee.</p>
<p>Analysts say that's what happened at Wednesday's $11.5
billion auction of 10-year Treasury notes. The average yield
on the securities was set at 8.77%. But because there wasn't
enough demand at that yield, the Treasury was forced to
accept bids as high as 8.84% to unload its notes.</p>
<p>Higher interest rates just now could be bad news for a
faltering U.S. economy already faced with the prospect of
higher oil prices and slowing growth. If the cost of money
rises, said Salomon's Mr. Feldman, "it will make it that much
harder to get the U.S. economy back on its feet." It would
also bloat an already huge federal budget deficit.</p>
<p>Even government officials in Japan are aware of the
hazards for the U.S. but say there is nothing they can do.
"It's early to draw any conclusions," said Makoto Utsumi,
Japan's vice minister of finance for international affairs.
"But it's clearly very, very bad timing."</p>
<p>The main factor sapping Japanese interest in U.S. Treasury
securities is fear of the unknown. Japanese investors see no
reason to keep stocking up on U.S. debt when they see U.S.
military forces in a standoff with Iraq in the Middle East,
the U.S. economy slowing down and little difference between
U.S. and Japanese interest rates. Moreover, there's a
widespread belief in Tokyo that the dollar soon will weaken.
"The visibility is almost zero for investors," said Mr.
Utsumi. "They can't have any clear perspective."</p>
<p>Japanese investors are equally blunt. "It's not good sense
to buy U.S. Treasurys," said Hideaki Nishisaka, a manager at
Daido Mutual Life Insurance Co., which has $20 billion in
assets. The company has trimmed its holdings of U.S. Treasury
bonds to about two-thirds the amount it would consider a full
load, he said.</p>
<p>Japanese investors' declining appetite for U.S. Treasurys
isn't altogether new. In the first quarter, the latest for
which data is available, they sold a net $3.9 billion of U.S.
government securities. Last week's auction continued "a trend
that we've seen all year," said William M. Brachfeld, an
executive vice president at the U.S. unit of Daiwa Securities
Co. in New York. "There are many {Japanese} who speculate,
who come in and out all the time. But in terms of investors,
someone who sticks and stays there, you're not seeing that."</p>
<p>Japanese investors haven't shunned all foreign bonds.
Yamaichi's Mr. Pardee said these investors have been
attracted to West German government bonds. One reason is that
German bond yields equal those in the U.S., while German
inflation is lower and its currency is expected to remain
strong. And while higher oil prices will boost German
inflation as well as America's, Mr. Pardee said Germany has a
better record in controlling prices.</p>
<p>The waning Japanese appetite for U.S. government debt is
evident everywhere. Before Thursday's auction of 30-year U.S.
Treasury bonds, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank already had decided to
sit out the auction, even though it can borrow dollars and
avoid the foreign-exchange risk of owning dollar-denominated
bonds that other, yen-based, investors might face.</p>
<p>At Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance Co., with more than $100
billion in assets, the international investment division was
on holiday last week, in the midst of a record U.S. debt
auction. The insurer isn't related to Dai-Ichi Kangyo.</p>
<p>"The problems in the Middle East hurt interest" at the
U.S. Treasury sale, said Aaron Cohen, a senior analyst at
Daiwa Securities Co. With U.S. troops poised to challenge
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the prospect of a major regional
conflict is real. In the past, the U.S. was considered a safe
haven for international money in times of crisis. But today,
investors in Japan say, the Japanese economy is better
positioned to weather higher oil prices than the U.S.
economy. Because investors in Japan already hold large
amounts of U.S. government debt, they don't want to add to
their risk by buying more.</p>
<p>And though the recent Mideast tensions have driven the
dollar higher, institutional investors don't expect the U.S.
currency's strength to last. They cite the troubled outlook
for the U.S. economy and, in a bit of circular logic, their
waning interest in buying dollar-denominated U.S. Treasurys.
"Looking ahead, we expect the dollar to go back down by the
last quarter of the year," said Mr. Cohen.</p>
<p>The possibility of foreign-exchange losses for yen-based
investors who buy dollar-denominated bonds makes the
ever-narrower difference between the yields on Japanese and
U.S. government bonds seem insignificant. At the end of
trading in Tokyo Friday, the No. 119 benchmark 10-year
Japanese government bond yielded 7.98%, or 7.37% when
calculated on a semiannual compound yield basis. That
compares with a semiannual compound yield of 8.67% for
10-year U.S. Treasurys.</p>
<p>Even if Japanese life insurance companies didn't foresee
risks in increasing their U.S. Treasury holdings, many
couldn't afford to. Kozo Nishimoto, a managing director at
Meiji Mutual Life Insurance Co., notes that asset growth at
the company, with $66 billion in assets, is slowing. Last
year, the growth was only 85% of what it was the year
previously. "We cannot increase our investments like we did
before," he said.</p>
<p>Aware of the drawbacks many Japanese investors see, the
big Japanese securities houses didn't push their clients to
invest in U.S. bonds at last week's auction, some securities
dealers say. "There wasn't much evidence of interest, and we
can't create it," said one dealer.</p>

<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>Prices of U.S. Treasury notes and bonds ended unchanged to
moderately lower as one of the market's most volatile weeks
in recent years drew to a close.</p>
<p>For the entire week, the Treasury market posted
significant losses with the price of the benchmark 30-year
bond falling about 2 1/2 points, or about $25 for a bond with
a $1,000 face amount, according to Salomon Brothers Inc.</p>
<p>During Friday's session, bond prices gyrated wildly. Bonds
rose during early trading on news that the producer price
index, a measure of inflation on the wholesale level, fell
modestly in July. Bond prices then plunged more than one
point as traders tried to clear out some of the inventory
they accumulated during last week's Treasury refunding.</p>
<p>Menacing talk from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and some
confident comments from President Bush contributed to
Friday's volatility.</p>
<p>Late in the day, bonds bounced off their lows on
bargain-hunting and ended as much as about 3/8 point lower.
The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at 99 21/32, down
from 100 2/32 on Thursday. The yield rose to 8.77% from
8.75%.</p>
<p>In the corporate market, junk bonds languished. Most junk
bonds, speculative-grade securities with low or no credit
ratings, finished 1/4 to 1/2 point lower.</p>
<p>Among leading losers were the junk bonds of casinos
operated by real estate developer Donald Trump. Trump Castle
Funding Corp.'s 13 3/4% first mortgage bonds slipped 1/2
point to 49 1/2, while Trump Taj Mahal Funding Corp.'s 14%
securities fell one point to 41 1/2.</p>
<p>An article in Friday's edition of The Wall Street Journal
reported that Merrill Lynch & Co. quit work on restructuring
$1.3 billion of Trump's casino bond debt.</p>
