	<p class="article-leader">Chemical stocks weren't a bad place for investors to hide
out after the oil market turmoil of 1973. But don't expect
history to repeat itself, analysts warn.
   Back in 1973, when war broke out in the Mideast and an oil
embargo sparked panic buying of many chemicals from already
busy plants, prices soared. For petrochemical makers, "it was
a short-term Shangri-La," recalls Paul Leming, a Morgan
Stanley analyst.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Chemical stocks handily beat the market in the 1974-75
decline. The Standard & Poor's chemical index rose 8% in the
first three quarters after the oil shock while the S&P 500
was declining 14%, Mr. Leming recalls.</p>
<p>Now, however, analysts see trouble ahead, especially for
makers of bulk chemicals and plastics, whose costs are
closely tied to pricing at the oil well. The shares of Dow
Chemical, Vista Chemical, Union Carbide and Quantum Chemical,
already slumping before Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait, have
since continued to weaken.</p>
<p>The threat of a sustained rise in oil prices deepens Wall
Street's doubts about when these stocks will rebound. Since
the invasion, analyst Harvey Stober at Dean Witter has
lowered his buy/hold rating on Dow and Quantum to hold, while
maintaining a hold on Carbide and a "swap" on Vista. He has
cut earnings estimates for all four. Leslie Ravitz at Salomon
Brothers has erased his buy recommendation for Carbide.</p>
<p>Clouding the outlook is the industry's brisk expansion. A
survey by Anantha Raman & Co., which tracks U.S. production
capacity, projects the industry will grow 7.2% in 1990 for
ethylene, a basic chemical building block; 16% for
polyethylene, the highest-volume plastic, found in milk jugs,
food wraps and housewares; and 8.8% for polyvinyl chloride,
widely used in construction.</p>
<p>Expanding output will keep pressure on prices, perhaps
forcing producers to eat the higher cost of oil-based raw
materials. Analyst Leonard Bogner at PrudentialBache has
worked up some numbers for a "worst-case scenario." He
estimates that, if raw-material costs stemming from a
$3-a-barrel rise in oil prices had to be entirely absorbed,
the hit to annual per-share earnings would be $3.70 at
Quantum Chemical, $1.50 at Vista Chemical, 60 cents at
Carbide and 40 cents at Dow.</p>
<p>Some building plans may be canceled. But demand could
change, too. DRI/McGraw Hill, a consulting firm, says its
preliminary analysis shows demand for petrochemicals slipping
5% in 1991 if oil is priced at $25 a barrel instead of
between $18 and $20.</p>
<p>All this numbers-crunching comes amid great uncertainty
about what will happen next in the Mideast. Professional
stock watchers don't relish their additional roles as
geopolitical deep thinkers. "I'm not convinced this uptick in
oil prices will stick," says John Neff, manager of Windsor
Fund, which holds about 8 million Carbide shares. He calls
Carbide cheap at 2.8 times 1990 cash flow, and doesn't expect
to change his position in the short term.</p>
<p>Indeed, if the stocks keep getting hammered, buying
opportunities may emerge. Morgan Stanley's Mr. Leming, while
glum about industry fundamentals, is recommending Quantum,
which has lost about 70% of its value in 12 months.</p>
<p>Katharine Plourde, a specialty-chemicals analyst at
Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette, says Nalco Chemical and Great
Lakes Chemical also have been "overpenalized." She considers
the stocks "attractive now" with 20% growth potential over
the next 12 months, though she hasn't put them on her buy
list yet. She thinks Great Lakes, whose big line is fire
retardants, can raise prices to offset any lower demand for
its gasoline additives. Nalco's strengths are water and waste
treatment chemicals. Both companies have sidelines in
chemicals used in oil drilling.</p>
<p>There is another oil shock on record, of course. But
during the 1979 climb in oil prices, chemical plants weren't
as busy; that year the stocks as a group did no better than
the S&P 500. Since then, some industry giants have tried to
cushion themselves from oil swings. Du Pont and Monsanto have
sloughed off petrochemical businesses and diversified
further. Du Pont also bought an oil company, Conoco.
Salomon's Mr. Ravitz has upgraded Du Pont to a buy from a
hold because of the potential strength on its oil side.</p>
<p>The widely diversified giants have won some fans among
analysts worrying about the next recession. Pharmaceutical
and farm-chemical businesses at Du Pont and Monsanto don't
follow the slopes of overall economic cycles. Monsanto argues
that even its core chemical business, long tied to the
housing and auto industries, isn't as subject to recessionary
pressures as it was in the early 1980s. For example, the
company makes the nylon for Wear-Dated carpet but says that
for every yard going into a new house, five are bought for
redecorating.</p>
<p>"These companies during the '80s were saying, `We have
made ourselves more recession-proof,'" says Gerald Adolph, a
chemicals-industry consultant at Booz Allen & Hamilton. "Now
we may find out."</p>
