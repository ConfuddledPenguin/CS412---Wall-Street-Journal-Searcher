	<p class="article-leader">PharmaKinetics Laboratories Inc. disclosed that the U.S.
Attorney's office in Baltimore is investigating the company
and its chief scientific officer in connection with the grand
jury investigation of generic drug makers.
   The Baltimore-based company said a letter from the U.S.
Attorney didn't indicate the scope of the investigation of
the company and its chief scientific officer, Mark Perkal. It
said it wasn't aware "of any facts or circumstances that
would lead it to believe that Perkal or any other employee
has violated any laws."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>PharmaKinetics did testing for both Bolar Pharmaceutical
Co. based in Copiague, N.Y., and Vitarine Pharmaceuticals
Inc., of Spring Valley, N.Y. Both companies have pulled
generic drugs from the market because of evidence suggesting
they passed off brand-name drugs as their own to obtain
government clearance to market a generic version.</p>
<p>Steven A. Woodman, PharmaKinetics chief executive, said
that the letter came "as a surprise to us, given the active
and positive nature of Dr. Perkal's and the company's
assistance in the various government investigations of the
generic drug industry over the last year."</p>
<p>A lawyer for the company said it "has been and continues
to be cooperating in the investigation."</p>
