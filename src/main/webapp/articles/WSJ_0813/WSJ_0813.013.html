	<p class="article-leader">PRIME MOTOR INNS Inc. (Fairfield, N.J.) -- Standard &
Poor's Corp. said it lowered its ratings on about $230
million of debt of this hotel and real estate company, and
removed the company from its CreditWatch list of issues under
review. Subordinated debt was lowered to single-B-minus from
double-B-plus. S&P noted that Prime has been affected by the
rapid weakening in the hotel industry, which has reduced
Prime's financial flexibility and will depress profitability
and cash flow.</p>
