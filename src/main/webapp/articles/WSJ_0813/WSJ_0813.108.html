	<p class="article-leader">MOUNT LAUREL, N.J. -- SL Industries Inc. said it expects
to report a loss for the fourth quarter, ended July 31.
   The company also said that because of increasing softness
in most phases of its business, it expects to report that
earnings from operations fell significantly from the
year-earlier period. In the fiscal 1989 fourth quarter,
per-share earnings were 14 cents, adjusted for a 6% stock
dividend distributed last November.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, SL
slumped $1.75 to close at $4.875.</p>
<p>In a series of announcements, the company said it plans to
repurchase up to one million shares, or 15% of its common
stock, and will establish in the fourth quarter a pretax
reserve of $3.5 million, or about 33 cents a share. The
reserve is for environmental cleanup related to manufacturing
plants the company operated in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
<p>The company also said it has accelerated spending at its
Electrostatic Technology Inc. subsidiary, which has developed
a way to coat materials with polymers. Demand for the
technology, the company said, "has been growing rapdily." SL
Industries further said that it sold its SL Plastics unit
Aug. 2. It said profit on the transaction wasn't material,
and it didn't disclose the purchaser or terms of the
transaction.</p>
<p>Daryl L. Renschler, SL president and chief executive
officer, said the company "remains in excellent financial
condition, with only 4% of long-term debt to total capital."
He added that book value at April 30 was $5.49 a share and
that developmental expenditures continue to be funded
internally.</p>
<p>SL Industries designs, manufactures and distributes
engineered products.</p>
