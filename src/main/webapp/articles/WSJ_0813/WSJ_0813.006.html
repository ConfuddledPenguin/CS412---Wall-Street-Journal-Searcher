	<p class="article-leader">PITTSFIELD, Mass. -- General Electric Co. is reworking the
formulation of its plastics in an effort to make those
materials more recyclable.
   Competitors at Dow Chemical Co. and Du Pont Co. also are
moving in that direction, but think some GE goals may be
difficult to attain.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At GE's $5 billion-a-year plastics division here,
officials say manufacture of recyclable plastic resins will
be crucial to long-term success. Pressures from
environmentalists and customers are building, they note, to
solve problems of toxicity, performance and raw material
compatibility that devalue recycled plastics.</p>
<p>For consumers, the push for recyclability will mean higher
prices for many products, GE says. Reformulating
flame-resistant resins used for computer housings, for
example, has added 15% to the resins' manufacturing cost.
John S. Razzano, manager of GE Plastics' high-performance
polymer and coatings, said GE hasn't passed on the increases
to its customers because those markets are competitive. "But
sooner or later, prices of such recyclable plastics will go
up. The additives and development costs will be expensive,"
he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Razzano declined to estimate the total cost of
research and development aimed at recycling technologies.
They account for about 30% of GE Plastics' technical efforts,
however, and are expected to increase to between 50% and 60%
within five years.</p>
<p>Attacking the toxicity problem, GE recently discontinued
certain bromine compounds used to make plastics
flame-retardant, prompting a complete formula change.
Although the bromine compounds were safe in primary use, they
give off harmful dioxin when the plastics containing them are
remelted. "Balancing the formulation to maintain the
plastics' performance was a major technical challenge," Mr.
Razzano said.</p>
<p>GE also is changing resin formulas for plastics used in
such products as computer and machine housings. These
polymers get their yellow pigment from cadmium, which is
carcinogenic. It doesn't pose any danger in the plastic, but
it can come loose in acidic environments. A non-toxic
substitute would make these polymers recyclable into building
materials and toys. GE said it is also working with pigment
suppliers to develop non-metallic pigments that duplicate
cadmium's high temperature resistance.</p>
<p>A bigger problem for GE researchers is that additives that
give plastics such essential properties as durability,
strength and impact resistance degrade significantly when the
products are chopped up and melted. "We are just beginning to
uncover these surprises," says Michael O'Mara, manager of
chemical research at GE's corporate research and development
center in Schenectady, N.Y. "A lot of additives in packages
have to be removed, and that means we have to use different
chemistry."</p>
<p>Incompatible resins may be the toughest problem of all.
Currently, such items as plastic beverage bottles, milk jugs,
bags, computer housing and car bumpers must be separated
carefully before they can be reused. That is because the
different polymers of which they are made don't blend when
melted together. The industry's attempt to have plastic
products coded with numbers to help consumers and recyclers
sort them hasn't worked well.</p>
<p>"Complete segregation of plastics at the consumer end
isn't feasible," says Mr. Razzano. "While separation by
recycling centers will continue to be a part of our overall
strategy, we have to assume that we won't get perfect
separation."</p>
<p>Thus GE researchers are attempting to develop
"compatiblizers," chemicals that can bind different forms of
polymers into one homogeneous resin. Development of these
binding agents are critical to recycling some of GE's major
high-performance plastics.</p>
<p>A lot of GE polycarbonate plastics are used in automobile
bumpers, for instance. But they aren't compatible with
plastics used in fenders and car doors. And even if these
different plastic parts were sorted in a junkyard, it would
probably be asking too much of a recycler to separate bumpers
by car makes, which in many cases have different polymers.</p>
<p>Researchers are aiming to develop a "universal
compatiblizer" that can fit four or five different polymers
into its chemical structure, the way cement holds sand and
stones of different size to form concrete. This approach may
also require the use of special additives to stabilize a
particular polymer in the mixture, and the researchers say
they will have to learn how to do that without interfering
with the rest of the mixture.</p>
<p>Scott Fritschel, solid waste program manager at Du Pont,
doesn't think that a "universal compatiblizer" is feasible.
He said Du Pont has developed additives to make specific
groups of polymers more recyclable, but isn't attempting
anything so ambitious as GE's effort to meld vastly
dissimilar resins into a single compound. "We are making
incremental steps, rather than quantum leaps," he said.</p>
<p>One source of pressure for recyclable plastics is auto
makers' concern that future legislation could force them to
bear the burden of recycling plastics contained in
automobiles. General Motors Corp., for example, is working
with suppliers of "sheet molded composites," which make up
entire body panels in several GM vehicles. In one technique,
GM is testing, as a passive participant, the recycling of
automotive plastics into roof shingles and other construction
materials. A GM spokesman said that the auto maker is urging
suppliers to explore recycling technologies, but it also is
doing some advance research in this area on its own.</p>
<p>"Four or five years ago, we didn't have to worry about
recycling, but the society is taking a different view of the
manufacturers as to how they account for the final
disposition of the material. What we are doing is trying to
develop a mechanism to make plastics a two-way material,"
says Glen Hiner, senior vice president of GE Plastics.</p>
