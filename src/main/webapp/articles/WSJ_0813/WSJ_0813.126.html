	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Inter-American Development Bank approved
a $300 million loan to Mexico for improvements in the
country's transportation and telecommunications industries.
   The IADB said this was its first loan to support whole
sectors of a country's economy. Previous IADB lending to
Latin American countries has been linked to specific economic
development projects.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The IADB said the $300 million loan will be used by the
Mexican government to improve the efficiency, reduce costs
and expand the capacity of its trucking industry. It will
also support improvements in Mexico's telecommunications
services through the privatization of Telefonos de Mexico, a
government-owned company.</p>
<p>IADB officials said the loan to Mexico is a co-financing
venture with the World Bank, which has approved $380 million
in other credits to support the same programs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the U.S. Export-Import bank said it will
guarantee $20.5 million in loans to Mexico for the purchase
of about $24.1 million in railroad equipment from General
Electric Co. and General Motors Corp.</p>
<p>The guarantee was extended to Mexico's Nacional
Financiera, which will arrange for the loans from U.S.
commercial banks or other private lenders.</p>
