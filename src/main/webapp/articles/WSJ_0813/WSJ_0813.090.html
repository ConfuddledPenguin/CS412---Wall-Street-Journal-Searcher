	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said
rising oil prices resulting from the Middle East crisis will
cut already sluggish economic growth in the U.S. by half but
won't cause a recession.
   Mr. Brady again called on the Federal Reserve to ease
credit and "tip the scales toward growth." But he said those
in Congress who view the Iraqi invasion, higher oil prices
and a weak economy as reasons to put off cutting the budget
deficit are "dead wrong."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Treasury secretary, in an interview Friday, said that
if oil prices stay near their current levels, that will
reduce the nation's growth to an annual rate of 0.75% -- down
from the 1.5% pace in the first half of the year.</p>
<p>But Mr. Brady continued to argue that a recession isn't in
the works. "Even if growth dips under 1%," he said, "we'll
still be growing."</p>
<p>He blamed the slower growth on the budget deficit, which
he said has "held interest rates at a high level," and on the
savings and loan fiasco, which he said fueled overbuilding in
the 1980s.</p>
<p>Mr. Brady also said a credit crunch "has got something to
do with it." But he called it a "chicken and egg" problem.
"Part of the credit crunch is banks are being more careful,
especially on real estate loans, and part is demand for loans
is down," he said.</p>
<p>Repeating his call for the Federal Reserve to lower
interest rates, Mr. Brady said the country should "avoid an
over-single-minded emphasis on inflation." He noted the Fed
"is an independent institution," but said its independence
"shouldn't prevent us from speaking out."</p>
<p>Mr. Brady also said the Middle East events and the slowing
economy make it "all the more important to move apace" on
budget cuts. He said he anticipates the budget negotiations,
which reconvene after Labor Day, will produce an agreement
before the November elections.</p>
<p>Because of the weakness in the economy and the likely
difficulty in agreeing on cuts in defense spending, some
congressional budget negotiators are reconsidering their goal
of shrinking the deficit by $50 billion in the fiscal year
that begins Oct. 1 and by $500 billion over the next five
years.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Brady reiterated his support for those
objectives, he said, "It is not so critically important to
have exactly $50 billion in the first year as long as we have
$500 {billion} over five years." He emphasized that the
administration will insist on a growth-oriented package -- a
reference to the administration's proposed cut in
capital-gains taxes -- and on alterations to the budget
process to assure that the deficit reductions projected for
future years are realized.</p>
<p>Mr. Brady acknowledged that an energy tax, an idea that
had gained support from negotiators from both parties,
"doesn't make a whole lot of sense" if the recent rise in oil
prices persists. If oil prices come down, however, such a tax
might be attractive, he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Brady tried to put the onus on the Democrats for the
slow pace of the budget talks, which began in mid-May and
have accomplished little. He said the president took a "large
political risk" in convening the talks and that the
Republicans were prepared to put forward a package of
spending cuts and tax increases last month. Democrats
weren't, however. "You can't negotiate with yourself," he
said.</p>
<p>On other topics, Mr. Brady said:</p>
<p>-- Recent events in the turbulent stock market demonstrate
the success of mechanisms installed to prevent a market crash
-- mechanisms such as the so-called circuit breakers that
stop trading in stock and futures markets when prices fall by
a set amount. "The circuit breakers . . . worked and they
worked well," he said. Mr. Brady, who chaired a presidential
commission that recommended such changes after the 1987
stock-market crash, added that some who opposed the changes
have written him recently to admit they were wrong.</p>
<p>-- A securities-transfer tax, one of many options examined
as a way to reduce the deficit, has good points and bad, and
Mr. Brady declined to take a position on such a tax. "There's
a lot of economic theory on both sides of that," he said.</p>
<p>-- President Bush will move to fill a vacancy on the Fed's
seven-member board of governors "very quickly" after Congress
returns in September. Manuel Johnson, the Fed's vice
chairman, announced his resignation two months ago.</p>
