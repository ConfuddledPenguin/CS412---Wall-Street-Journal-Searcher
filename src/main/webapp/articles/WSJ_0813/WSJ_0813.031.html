	<p class="article-leader">Regarding your July 6 page-one article "Parental Concern:
As Nanny Agencies Proliferate, So Do Gripes About Service":
   First, personally check all references. Second, personally
interview the candidates. Third, give some time to developing
the working relationship.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>I bet the parents do at least as much when hiring someone
for the steno pool at the office. What are they thinking of,
to depend so utterly on the word of any agency as to the
person who will be in their home caring for their precious
children?</p>

<p>It is reprehensible that some agencies do not screen as
thoroughly as they claim. Agencies must follow through or be
prepared to refund fees. But parents must assume some
responsibility as well. I am distressed when a client to whom
I have referred a nanny declines the opportunity to
double-check my reference work on the applicant. What might
she learn about that candidate's specific suitability to her
own situation that I, not being part of her family, could not
have known to ask?</p>
<p>The question that haunts this industry is, how well can
any screening process predict the likelihood of a particular
nanny's success on the job? Written references double-checked
by telephone, driver's license and criminal checks, a
personal letter from the applicant, medical history, numerous
lengthy interviews and reports, situational questions
relating directly to the candidate's working style -- a
comprehensive application is at least 10 to 15 pages long.
Some agencies do psychological tests, too, but their success
rates are no higher than those of careful agencies that do
not test.</p>
<p>Nannying is hard work. Like any other responsible job it
deserves medical insurance, paid holidays and vacations, as
well as overtime pay for extra hours. It needs thoughtful and
frequent, open communications with parents, better pay and,
yes, training. Raising someone else's kids these days is no
piece of cake. Nannying, if it is to be improved, needs
recognition as a challenging, rewarding, long-term career
option for qualified, loving, intelligent women of various
ages and for an occasional young man as well.</p>
<p>But please let's stop looking for Mary Poppins. She was a
creation of the Victorian imagination, which liked to pretend
that it did not need to know what went on in the nursery.
Today's involved, conscientious parent needs today's nanny, a
real person.</p>

<p>As owner of one of the oldest agencies in the country, I
am all too familiar with the problems that arise when trying
to match families with in-home child-care providers. There
will always be unsuccessful placements due to homesickness,
personality clashes, poor communication and differing
expectations, but it doesn't mitigate the need for the best
screening and recruiting services possible for the client.</p>
<p>In 1985, I and a handful of other nannies,
placement-agency owners and educators founded the
International Nanny Association to educate the public about
hiring in-home child care. Since then, we have established
standards for the industry and codes of conduct for nannies
and agencies. We have also printed definitions of "au pair,"
mother's helpers, nannies and governesses.</p>
<p>My advice to the client: Take part in the screening
process. My agency always recommends to the client that he or
she follow up our screening process with calls to the nanny's
references, and most families don't do it.</p>
