	<p class="article-leader">Program trading accounted for an average of 9.9% of New
York Stock Exchange volume, or 17 million shares a day, in
the week ended July 27.
   That was up slightly from an average of 9.6%, or 16
million shares a day, in the previous week, the Big Board
said in its weekly report on computer-aided trading.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The most active program traders for the week were General
Electric Co.'s Kidder, Peabody Group Inc. (16.3 million
shares), Morgan Stanley Group Inc. (12.7 million), Goldman,
Sachs & Co. (7 million), PaineWebber (6.5 million) and
Merrill Lynch & Co. (6.5 million). These five firms accounted
for 58% of all program trading on the exchange.</p>
<p>On July 23, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell
nearly 60 points in the first hour of trading, the Big Board
said Kidder Peabody sold 351,000 shares in program-trading
strategies for its own account and 383,000 shares as an agent
for customers between 10 and 10:30 a.m. Salomon Inc.'s
Salomon Brothers unit sold 543,000 shares for customers in
program-trading strategies.</p>
<p>The same day, the Dow fell to a loss of 106.94 points by
10:46 a.m., but then rallied 49 points in 14 minutes, paring
losses to 57.94 points by 11 a.m. During that time, Merrill
Lynch bought 805,000 shares for customers. Susquehanna
Investment Group sold 592,000 shares for its own account. CS
First Boston Inc.'s First Boston Corp. unit bought 419,000
shares for its own account and 460,000 shares to facilitate
customer orders.</p>
<p>Program trading is the purchase or sale of a group of at
least 15 and often hundreds of different stocks. Stock-index
arbitrage, which involves stock purchases and sales with
offsetting trades in futures and options, was led by Kidder
Peabody, which accounted for 38% of the total.</p>
