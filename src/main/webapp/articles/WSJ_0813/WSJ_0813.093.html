	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration exercised its option
to exempt all military personnel accounts from any
across-the-board spending cuts this fall.
   "This is considered to be in the national interest . . .
to maintain the force levels required for our national
security," Budget Director Richard Darman said in notifying
Congress of President Bush's decision on Friday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>About $84 billion of spending cuts will be triggered in
October by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law, unless
Congress and the president agree on a way to shrink the
deficit or alter the law before then.</p>
<p>Even though Mr. Bush has exempted military personnel, the
law requires that other Pentagon spending accounts absorb
half of any Gramm-Rudman cuts. The Office of Management and
Budget estimates these accounts would be slashed by 34.9%.
Non-defense accounts covered by the law would be cut by
31.9%. Social Security and many other government benefit
programs are exempt.</p>
<p>Earlier last week, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
indicated that Mr. Bush was planning only to shield some
portion of the military personnel accounts from the cuts.</p>
