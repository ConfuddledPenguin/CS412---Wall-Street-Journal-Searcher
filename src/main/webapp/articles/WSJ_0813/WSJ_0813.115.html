	<p class="article-leader">California's air pollution control agency said it passed
additional emission-control standards that will cut by 80%
emissions of smog-forming hydrocarbons generated by
evaporating gasoline in new cars and trucks.
   "Evaporating gasoline can account for as much as one third
of the pollution generated by a new car," said board
chairwoman Jananne Sharpless.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The California Air Resources Board said that the about 1.4
million new cars and trucks made in the state each year will
have to be fitted with larger charcoal-filled canisters that
absorb evaporation from fuel lines and gas tanks and route
them to the engine, where they are burned. The filters and
other changes required, which the state said were opposed by
various auto makers, will add $18 to the cost of each
vehicle. The requirement will be phased in between 1995 and
1998.</p>
<p>In 1989, California, which has the nation's strictest
tailpipe standards, required equipment that would reduce by
41% the emission of hydrocarbons for cars made in 1993 and
after.</p>
