	<p class="article-leader">BRUSSELS -- What NATO governments do in response to Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait, said U.S. Secretary of State James Baker
here Friday, "has significance far beyond the situation in
the Gulf." Indeed it does. It will test whether Europeans
have the collective will to defend Europe's own interests or,
once again, will simply "let the Yanks do it."
   That in turn will have a bearing on whether NATO has any
future as a military alliance, and whether Europe's vaunted
ambitions for "political unity" have a ghost of a chance.
Many of Europe's politicians, it should be noted, were as
eager as many U.S. congresspersons for unilateral disarmament
and the "peace dividend" before Saddam grabbed Kuwait. No
European policy coordination was evident.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>After the invasion, European responses were mostly
tentative. Everyone condemned Iraq, but so has the rest of
the world. The only immediate substantive action came from
Margaret Thatcher, the least "European" of all of Europe's
leaders. She began dispatching planes, ships and troops to
the Gulf to bolster American, Turkish and Egyptian forces.
She was the only European to provide instant military
firepower as a counter to any temptation Saddam might have to
take advantage of his immediate numerical superiority.</p>
<p>France and Germany -- where most of the talk of "political
unity" originates -- displayed very little of that unity.
France said it would dispatch one of its two Clemenceau-class
small carriers to the area. But since French forces are not
under NATO command, it is not clear how its ships and planes
will be teamed up with other naval and air forces.</p>
<p>That mostly endangers French sailors, since protecting
ships from missiles requires close coordination of defensive
units. France has been Iraq's second most important arms
supplier, after the Soviet Union. It would be supreme irony
if one of its own ships were hit with one of the Exocet
missiles it has sold Saddam.</p>
<p>The German government has had even more trouble making up
its mind. Statements from the offices of the chancellor and
the foreign minister have conflicted, but both have stressed
legal restrictions on "out-of-area" use of German forces. Not
even a hint of support came from Karsten Voight, spokesman
for the opposition Social Democrats, who said that German
troops have "no business" in the Gulf. Germans, too, have
provided lethal technology to the Arabs. Industrialist Jurgen
Hippenstiel-Imhausen was convicted in June of selling Libya
equipment that could be used to make poison gas.</p>
<p>Italy, although it has a strong navy, couldn't even decide
whether to support the United Nations embargo on Iraqi oil.
The foreign ministry was quoted last Thursday as saying the
embargo is not "total" so far as Italy is concerned.</p>
<p>Italy, Spain and Germany did quickly agree to let the U.S.
dispatch planes and forces from their NATO air bases. That's
at least progress from responses to past Middle East crises.
U.S. F-111s from England had to give the European continent a
wide berth, entailing a long flight and midair refueling,
when President Reagan dispatched them to punish Moammar
Gadhafi. The fact that most of Gadhafi's terrorism had been
conducted in Europe was deemed immaterial.</p>
<p>Europe's NATO members traditionally have found it
convenient to turn a deaf ear to U.S. pleas that they help
deal with out-of-area security problems. When the Soviets and
Cuba were building up their Caribbean presence through the
construction of air bases on the island of Grenada and the
northeast coast of Nicaragua, U.S. admirals warned that there
were strategic implications for Europe as well as the U.S. A
lot of Europe's commerce flows through the Panama Canal and
the Caribbean. The allies weren't interested, so the U.S.
tackled that problem independently, encountering opposition
from German leftist supporters of Castro's Sandinista
proteges in Nicaragua.</p>
<p>Going back to the late 1960s, some Americans still
remember needling from Britons -- "pity about Vietnam" -- at
a time when American troops were trying to halt the spread of
communism in Southeast Asia. British interests were just as
much jeopardized as American interests. It has been left up
to the Americans to combat Arab terrorism, even though much
of it was directed at Europe, because France, Italy and, to
some degree, Germany and England, didn't want to jeopardize
their commercial and political ties with Arab nations. As
Albert Wohlstetter and Fred Hoffman wrote in the Journal last
week, there also was ambivalence over whether Turkey, a NATO
member, would merit NATO support if it were attacked by Iraq
or Syria.</p>
<p>Saddam Hussein's grab does not necessarily chuck all those
conflicting interests out the window. Judging from Karsten
Voight's statement, it won't instantly cause the European
left to embrace American leadership. But judging from the
overwhelming (83%) public support in the U.K. for Mrs.
Thatcher's dispatch of forces to the Gulf, it is likely that
Europe's priorities will undergo some change. Those big
tankers sailing into Rotterdam from the Persian Gulf every
day are a vital lifeline for Europe. Saddam Hussein surely
has exploded the myth that the only threat to Europe was from
a now-dismembered Warsaw Pact.</p>
<p>Whether NATO is unified sufficiently to step up to
out-of-area threats has not been resolved, however. The
preference among most European leaders is for conduct of the
Persian Gulf military operation under the aegis of the United
Nations, or maybe the Western European Union. That would
preserve NATO's purity, but it would also guarantee its
ultimate extinction, since its single mission, to protect
Europe from a Soviet attack, suffers from diminishing
credibility.</p>
<p>Such a demise would be a shame. One of the largely hidden
virtues of NATO has been that it has combined under a central
command the military forces of nations whose quarrels have
cost the world many millions of lives in this century. German
reunification should, if anything, emphasize the importance
of that. It also should give France second thoughts about
that now-outdated DeGaulle decision to keep France's forces
outside the unified command, although there is no sign of
such second thoughts. Finally, a credible NATO, capable of
agreeing quickly on a military response to out-of-area
crises, would deter future Saddams from jeopardizing European
and North American interests.</p>
<p>But if Europe's leaders -- other than Mrs. Thatcher -- are
aware of all this, it hasn't been immediately obvious. With a
potentially effective military alliance already in place,
there will be continued speculation on alternative "security"
structures, such as the Committee for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), of dubious value. As Mr. Baker
said, Europe faces some big decisions. And events are moving
fast.</p>
