	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- First Executive Corp., the wounded
insurance holding company, said its longtime auditor,
Deloitte & Touche, has declined to continue in that capacity.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the company said it hasn't had any disagreements with
Deloitte & Touche in the past 2 1/2 years, and the reason for
the firm's decision to remove itself remains unclear.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>First Executive, the parent of Executive Life Insurance
Co., a California concern, and Executive Life Insurance Co.
of New York, has been the subject of widespread news coverage
since earlier this year, when it reported an $859 million
write-down of its junk-bond portfolio. The unexpected
write-down, which applied as of Dec. 31, 1989, brought the
company's net loss for last year to $775.6 million, or $9.67
a share.</p>
<p>First Executive noted in its filing that, in June, it
hired William L. Sanders as chief financial officer,
treasurer and a corporate vice president. Mr. Sanders had
been the Deloitte & Touche partner in charge of First
Executive's audit since 1986.</p>
<p>Subsequent to hiring Mr. Sanders, First Executive said, it
recruited a number of other Deloitte & Touche employees who
also had worked on its audit. First Executive said it
employed the former members of the group that audited it "in
order to expand its accounting staff."</p>
<p>The company said that, because of the resulting changes at
Deloitte & Touche, it had begun considering a possible change
of accountants but hadn't reached any decision when Deloitte
& Touche apparently beat it to the punch and resigned.
However, the filing doesn't explicitly connect Deloitte &
Touche's decision to resign with First Executive's unusual
decision to employ what appears to have been a substantial
portion of its outside auditor's team.</p>
<p>First Executive's disclosure was made in an 8-K
extraordinary events filing with the SEC. The filing, dated
July 30, was signed by a corporate officer Aug. 2 and
received by the commission the next day.</p>
<p>For its part, Deloitte & Touche, in an attached
one-sentence letter, said it concurred with First Executive's
"comments" in the 8-K filing but didn't provide further
disclosure. Robert Garland, managing partner of Deloitte &
Touche's Los Angeles office, declined to elaborate.</p>
<p>Fred Carr, chairman and chief executive officer of First
Executive, said the company hasn't selected a successor to
Deloitte & Touche. Before a merger that created Deloitte &
Touche, a predecessor firm, Touche Ross & Co., had audited
First Executive. "They are an excellent firm, and we have
enjoyed an excellent relationship with them," Mr. Carr said,
adding that he had discussed Deloitte & Touche's decision to
withdraw as auditor at First Executive's July 30 annual
meeting.</p>
<p>Mr. Carr said he wasn't sure how many members of Deloitte
& Touche's former audit team had been recruited by First
Executive. "I'm guessing that it's seven or eight," he said.</p>
<p>Deloitte & Touche is a defendant with First Executive in
shareholder suits focusing, among other things, on alleged
inadequate disclosure of the company's troubled financial
condition.</p>
<p>Over the years, the accounting firm has issued a series of
unqualified audit opinions on First Executive. However, in
its March 29, 1990 report on the 1989 financial statements,
Deloitte & Touche included extensive cautionary explanations.
Among other things, it said that the estimated market value
of First Executive's $8 billion-plus junk-bond holdings was
based on the company's and certain brokers' subjective
determinations because the market for some of the securities
was either too volatile or too illiquid to get a clear
reading.</p>
<p>However, the auditor's letter didn't flag or explain the
$859 million write-down or note that, even after the
write-down, the company's market value of the bond portfolio
remained about $1 billion below the $13.26 billion value at
which it is recorded on First Executive's books. Deloitte &
Touche did note, however, that if troubled market conditions
continue, the company could suffer greater portfolio losses
than then estimated.</p>
<p>First Executive is the subject of a number of regulatory
inquiries, among them a formal SEC investigation begun in
March that is looking into the company's financial
statements, including the bond-portfolio write-down.</p>
<p>As its financial woes deepened this year, including more
than $1.33 billion paid in the first quarter to holders
cashing in policies, First Executive began pointing to
studies by consulting actuaries Milliman & Robertson, which
it said proved that its California-based Executive Life
Insurance unit was financially sound and able to withstand a
variety of hypothetical adversities.</p>
<p>But, while reporting the good news, First Executive thus
far has refused to make the reports themselves public.</p>
<p>Friday, New York's state appeals court delayed ruling on
an appeal by First Executive to forestall disclosure of the
reports to Joseph Belth, publisher of "Insurance Forum," and
a frequent critic of First Executive. A lower court had
ordered the New York State Department of Insurance, which has
copies of the reports, to make them public under state
freedom of information statutes.</p>
