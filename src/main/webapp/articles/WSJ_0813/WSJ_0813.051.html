	<p class="article-leader">DOMINGUEZ, Calif. -- Pic 'N' Save Corp. forestalled a
threatened proxy battle with Girard Partners L.P. and
investor David Batchelder by agreeing to put Mr. Batchelder
and two associates on the board, widen a planned stock
buy-back and lift two anti-takeover measures.
   The pact, announced by the two sides Friday, appears to
give Girard and Mr. Batchelder much of what they have sought
since April, when they disclosed a 6.7% stake in Pic 'N'
Save, which operates a chain of stores specializing in new
"closeout" merchandise.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the pact also leaves unclear where control of Pic 'N'
Save is headed and whether Girard, which earlier said it
would make a bid for the company, might later pursue an
offer.</p>
<p>"There's no limitation on Girard or on any other
shareholder," said Mr. Batchelder, an investor in La Jolla,
Calif., who was once Texas oil man T. Boone Pickens,
principal strategist. Mr. Batchelder declined, however, to
say whether the Girard group will increase, decrease or leave
unchanged its holding.</p>
<p>As part of the pact, Pic 'N' Save agreed to redeem its
so-called "poison pill" takeover defense and to urge
shareholders to amend the company's bylaws to exempt the
company from a Delaware restriction on financial transactions
by a hostile acquirer.</p>
<p>Despite its relatively small current holding, the Girard
group has acquired a large representation on Pic 'N' Save's
board, with three members of a reconstituted eight-member
board being named by Girard and a fourth member, acceptable
to both sides, apparently being named by other major holders.</p>
<p>Among other things, it appears that Girard will have
effective control over the selection of a new president and
chief executive officer. As reported, the current incumbent,
Lewis B. Merrifield III, has resigned effective Jan. 1. Mr.
Merrifield, who remains on the board, has agreed not to vote
on matters related to his own succession.</p>
<p>Mr. Batchelder declined to say whether a successor had
been selected. However, he added that "the issue will be
dealt with promptly."</p>
<p>Pic 'N' Save stock barely budged after the announcement,
rising 25 cents a share Friday to close at $10.25 in active
over-the-counter trading. The stock had climbed from a
52-week low of $8.75 a share last Monday.</p>
<p>In announcing the agreement, Pic 'N' Save reiterated an
earlier statement that it is "aggressively pursuing" efforts
to expand to $150 million a current $60 million common stock
repurchase authorization. At Friday's closing price, the $150
million would buy approximately 42% of the about 34.9 million
shares outstanding at July 31. The current $60 million
authorization would buy about 17%. But the bigger buy-back is
contingent on suitable financing and neither side would
discuss the progress, if any, in that area.</p>
<p>A company spokesman said that under its $60 million
authority, Pic 'N' Save will start repurchases today on the
open market through a solicitation group led by Goldman,
Sachs & Co.</p>
<p>Pic 'N' Save, whose retail operations have been strained
of late by rapid expansion, has been seen as a test case for
the high-profile Mr. Batchelder, considered a bright and
seasoned strategist in his work for Mr. Pickens and for Los
Angeles investor Marvin Davis in his failed attempts to buy
NWA Inc., the parent of Northwest Airlines, and UAL Corp.,
the parent of United Airlines.</p>
<p>The early results with Pic 'N' Save -- Mr. Batchelder's
first independent effort -- weren't auspicious. Three months
after announcing that it expected to make a $447 million
offer for Pic 'N' Save, Girard said it doubted that it could
raise sufficient cash to make an attractive bid to holders.
Analysts wondered aloud about the attractiveness of Pic 'N'
Save. And talks with management stalled repeatedly. But
Girard pressed on with plans for a proxy contest.</p>
<p>Now, it remains to be seen whether Mr. Batchelder can
steer Pic 'N' Save to more profitable ground. The company had
net income of $5.9 million, or 17 cents a share, on $119
million in sales in the April 29 fiscal first quarter.</p>
<p>Clearly under pressure from Girard, management has set
sharp cost-cutting measures designed to increase cash flow.
Last week, it announced that, after the closing of 14 of its
190 stores, the facilities were returned to a previous owner
and the inventory was sold for an undisclosed amount to a
joint venture 50%-owned by New York-based Lionel Corp.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Pic 'N' Save's board was expanded to
eight members from seven and, with the resignation of three
incumbents, three new nominees from the Girard group were
accepted as directors. The fourth new member was agreed upon
by both sides.</p>
<p>The directors from Girard group are: Mr. Batchelder; James
J. Zehentbauer, a partner of Mr. Batchelder's; and Bill M.
Thomas, a former chief financial officer of Pic 'N' Save who
has sided with Mr. Batchelder and Girard. Mr. Thomas owns a
4% stake in Pic 'N' Save in addition to Girard's 6.7%.</p>
<p>The director accepted by both sides is Peter Willmott,
former chairman, president and chief executive officer of
Carson Pirie Scott & Co., a food services concern.</p>
<p>The incumbent directors who remained are: Arthur Frankel,
chairman and former chief executive officer of the company;
Mr. Merrifield, the departing president and chief executive
officer; Ronald Spogli, general partner of Freeman Spogli &
Co.; and Bruce E. Karatz, president and chief executive
officer of Kaufman & Broad Home Corp.</p>
