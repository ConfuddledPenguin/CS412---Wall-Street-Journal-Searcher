	<p class="article-leader">MCCONNELLSBURG, Pa. -- JLG Industries Inc. said it will
cut its McConnellsburg plant work force by 150, as a result
of soft residential and commercial construction markets.
   There has already been a reduction of 135 workers over the
past several months at the company's domestic and foreign
facilities.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The maker of hydraulic machinery reported that its work
force after the reduction will total about 1,400, with 1,150
in the U.S. and 250 overseas.</p>
