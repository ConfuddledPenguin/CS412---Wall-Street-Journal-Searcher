	<p class="article-leader">WestAir Holding Inc., Fresno, Calif., said July revenue
passenger miles increased 37% to 57.3 million from 41.8
million a year earlier. A revenue passenger mile is one
paying passenger flown one mile.
   The load factor, or percentage of seats filled, for the
month was 45.5%, compared with 48% a year earlier. WestAir
attributed the drop to last year's "kids fly free" promotion,
which boosted load factors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company also announced that it will raise fares 5%
Wednesday to offset higher fuel prices. WestAir operates as
United Express through a marketing agreement with United Air
Lines. It operates more than 850 daily flights to 60 U.S.
cities.</p>
<p>For the year through July 31, WestAir said revenue
passenger miles rose 36% to 364.6 million from 267.7 million
a year earlier.</p>
