	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Mattel Inc. said it signed an exclusive
licensing agreement with Price Stern Sloan Inc. to produce a
series of books, including a cookbook, based on its Barbie
doll toy.
   The books will add to a plethora of products Mattel is
introducing around the image of Barbie, the world's
best-selling plastic playmate. Already, the toy maker has
unvieled several new Barbie Style products, including a line
of girl-sized costumes, bed sheets and accessories.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Over time, Mattel has said it plans to take Barbie beyond
the toy category and into children's clothing, beauty
products and other consumer goods -- hoping that by doing so,
the company will bolster sales of the doll.</p>
<p>Mattel said it is considering several proposals from movie
producers to take Barbie to the silver screen. A Mattel
spokesman said a decision on whether to make a movie hasn't
been made. One consideration the company has always had is
that a Barbie movie, which would show how the doll supposedly
sounds and acts, would impinge on each individual girl's
fantasies about the doll, the Mattel spokesman said.</p>
<p>Barbie accounted for $600 million of Mattel's $1.2 billion
in total revenue for 1989.</p>
<p>Los Angeles-based Price Stern Sloan, a publisher and
distributor of children's books, said it plans to introduce
the first of several lines of Barbie books in the spring of
1991.</p>
<p>In addition, Price Stern said that in July, it entered
into a licensing agreement with Walt Disney Co. to produce an
electronic wand with a Mickey Mouse head and to publish six
books featuring Disney characters.</p>
