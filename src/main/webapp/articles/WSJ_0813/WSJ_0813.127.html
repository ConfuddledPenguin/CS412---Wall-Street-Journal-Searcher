	<p class="article-leader">Gasoline pump prices fell Friday for the first time since
Iraq invaded Kuwait, but not by much.
   After prices ran up 15 cents to 20 cents a gallon in many
parts of the nation, a handful of major oil refiners began to
cut wholesale prices and it seems some of those reductions
are filtering on to the corner service station. Some big oil
companies froze their prices.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Companies said they made the unsually quick cuts in
response to falling crude-oil markets and to President Bush's
plea for pricing restraint.</p>
<p>The American Automobile Association said the average price
nationwide for self-serve unleaded gasoline declined 0.3 cent
to $1.25 a gallon. The AAA survey found wide disparities from
area to area. In Michigan prices dropped by one cent and in
Indiana by five cents, while prices rose one cent in Texas.</p>
