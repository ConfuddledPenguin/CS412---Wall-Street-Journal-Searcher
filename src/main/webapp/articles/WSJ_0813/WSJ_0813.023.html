	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Chase Manhattan Corp. plans to offer severance
to "a few thousand" U.S. employees as part of its plan to cut
$300 million of costs.
   The banking company said employees with at least 10 years'
time would be eligible, and would start with two weeks' pay
for each year of service. Chase wouldn't specify the number
of employees eligible, but expects to report about a $30
million third-quarter charge for related costs of the
voluntary program. At the same time, a spokesman said, Chase
estimates it will save $10 million in the fourth quarter and
"commensurate" amounts later.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The charge and savings depend on the number of workers who
choose the severance, the spokesman said, adding that Chase
reserves the right to accept or reject severance applicants.</p>
<p>Analysts had expected the bank to take less than $100
million of charges for the cost-cutting effort. The
spokesman, calling the severance plan "a small part" of the
overall cost cuts, confirmed that the bank plans further
steps "that will result in additional charges but additional
savings" as well.</p>
<p>Chase Manhattan's chairman-elect, Thomas G. Labrecque, and
president-elect, Arthur F. Ryan, are determined to make the
major cost cuts and boost profitability as Chase, like other
major banks, has been hammered by bad commercial real estate
loans.</p>
<p>At June 30, past-due real estate loans plus foreclosed
properties rose 52% to $1.75 billion, from $1.15 billion at
March 31. In the first half, Chase's net income sank 64% from
a year earlier to $96 million, or 44 cents a share, as its
provision for possible losses on bad loans grew 50% to $450
million.</p>
<p>For 1989's third quarter, Chase reported a net loss of
$1.11 billion, or $12.45 a share, after $1.26 billion of
special provisions, including a special addition to the
bank's reserve for possible losses on loans to countries that
were refinancing their debts.</p>
<p>Under the severance plan, those eligible employees with 10
to 19 years' experience at Chase would get two weeks' pay for
each year worked. Those with 20 or more years would get three
weeks' pay per year, to a maximum of 104 weeks.</p>
<p>Chase, which employs 40,000 world-wide, isn't offering the
severance plan to, among others, non-U.S. workers, part-time
employees or certain senior officers. But for the eligible
employees "who've been here longer term," the plan "increases
their benefits and flexibility in making career decisions,"
the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The eligible employees aren't concentrated in any
particular departments or divisions, Chase's spokesman said.</p>
<p>Part of Chase's plan to boost profitability is possible
sales of assets. "I have nothing to report on that," the
spokesman said, though analysts expect the bank to sell
certain buildings overseas.</p>
<p>Separately, Fitch Investors Service Inc. pared its ratings
on $8 billion of Chase Manhattan's securities, including a
cut in the senior debt rating to triple-B-plus from
single-A-plus. Standard & Poor's Corp. and Moody's Investors
Service Inc. made similar reductions in June.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Chase
shares fell 50 cents to $18.625.</p>
