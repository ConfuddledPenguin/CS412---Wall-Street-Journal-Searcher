Marelli S.p.A. agreed to establish a joint venture to produce
car air conditioners in Britain and to exchange shares in two
subsidiaries.
   The two companies will form the joint venture to pursue
market opportunities in the quickly developing European
market, the Japanese company said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Nippondenso is the second-largest member of the Toyota
group and is 23.3%-owned by Toyota Motor Corp. Milan-based
Magneti Marelli is 60%-owned by Fiat S.p.A.</p>
