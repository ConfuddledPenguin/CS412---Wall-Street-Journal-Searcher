	<p class="article-leader">Edison Brothers Stores Inc., moving to expand its group of
menswear stores, plans to acquire Webster Clothes Inc. for
$19.2 million.
   St. Louis-based Edison said it agreed to pay $6 a share
for Webster's common stock. Fifty cents a share will be
placed in escrow, subject to certain events and adjustments.
A Webster official said the company will disclose details of
the contingencies on Monday in its merger filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain Webster
shareholders, who own 80% of the stock, have granted Edison
an option to purchase their shares at the merger price.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The merger, subject to approval by Webster shareholders as

under the names Webster, Zeidler & Zeidler, and Aggio.</p>
