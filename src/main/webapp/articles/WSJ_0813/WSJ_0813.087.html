	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said his
recusal from energy-policy matters has been waived because of
the crisis in the Persian Gulf.
   "I have a temporary waiver from my recusal because we're
talking about the Iraq-Kuwait problem. With something that
pressing, the president wanted his full team," Mr. Mosbacher
said in an interview.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Mosbacher has previously been recused from
energy-policy matters because of possible conflicts of
interest. Before taking his present post, he spent his career
in the oil business in Houston, where he managed his family
oil concern Mosbacher Energy Corp. The company is now run by
his son Robert Mosbacher Jr.</p>
<p>Discussing the current crisis, the commerce secretary was
critical of those retailers of oil and gas who have increased
their prices drastically. "I think it's shortsighted of these
guys. If I was in business, I'd be a little more circumspect.
Long-term it isn't smart business," he said.</p>
<p>The longstanding friendship between President Bush and Mr.
Mosbacher dates back to the 1960s, when both men sought their
fortunes in the oil exploration business in Texas.</p>
