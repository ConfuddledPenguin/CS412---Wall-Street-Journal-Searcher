	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- Chrysler Corp. was sentenced to pay $7.6
million in criminal fines for mail fraud in connection with
the sale of approximately 30 previously wrecked vehicles as
new automobiles.
   The $7.6 million in criminal fines is another embarrassing
reminder of the 1987 scandal in which the auto maker
acknowledged that it sold as new cars that factory officials
had driven, with the odometers disconnected.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The latest judgment comes less than two months after the
company was hit with a $1 million penalty in a Missouri court
for selling a Missouri couple a "new" Chrysler New Yorker
that had been wrecked during a factory official's test drive.</p>
<p>Chrysler said it is considering appeals of both penalties.
The auto maker already has sent $500 apiece to 27,500
customers as part of the settlement of a class-action lawsuit
stemming from the same issue, said Charles Newman, a Chrysler
lawyer.</p>
<p>Chrysler pleaded no contest in December 1987 to charges of
selling the wrecked vehicles, as part of a larger case
brought by federal authorities in St. Louis. Federal
officials charged that Chrysler employees disconnected the
odometers on approximately 60,000 new cars that were then
driven by Chrysler executives. The cars were later sold as
new, including some that had been damaged and repaired,
federal officials said.</p>
<p>The mail fraud charges stemmed from the fact that titles
which described the vehicles as new were sent to consumers
through the mail, the Postal Service said in a statement.</p>
<p>Shortly after the charges came to light in 1987, Chrysler
Chairman Lee A. Iacocca said disconnecting odomoters to
conduct test drives "went beyond dumb and reached all the way
to stupid." Mr. Iacocca's candor, and his offers to extend
warranties on affected vehicles, largely defused the issue at
the time. Still, the court actions this year are an unwelcome
echo of the episode at a time when Chrysler is trying to
break out of a sales and earnings slump.</p>
<p>"Certainly the sooner we can get this behind us, the
happier we can be," a Chrysler spokesman said Friday.</p>
