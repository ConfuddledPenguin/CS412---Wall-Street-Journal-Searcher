	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Iraq's claim to Kuwait, though summarily
rejected by the international community, has some shaky basis
in history.
   Iraq had asserted its right to control Kuwait even before
the Kuwaiti state won its independence from Britain in 1961.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Above all, that claim is based on the fact that, before
the British dominated the region, the Ottoman Empire had
declared that Kuwait was part of a province controlled from
the Iraqi city of Basra. Iraq argues that the lines of
control established in that Ottoman era should still apply,
not borders later worked out by the British.</p>
<p>Iraq's claim is similar to those made over the years by
other Middle East states dissatisfied with international
borders largely drawn up by colonial powers decades ago. But
it isn't very solid by current international standards. The
al-Sabah family ousted by Iraq's invasion has ruled the area
around Kuwait City for 234 years. Even before aligning
themselves with the British, the family had refused to
acknowledge that it was subject to Ottoman control.</p>
<p>Kuwait's leaders in 1899 signed an agreement giving the
British responsibility for their defense and foreign affairs,
and in 1913 the British concluded an agreement recognizing
the autonomy of the leader of Kuwait. Kuwait's borders were
established at a conference held by the British in 1923, and
the country was granted its independence from Britain in
1961.</p>
<p>Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein "has a very uphill battle" to
make the case, says Christine Helms, a Middle East scholar
who has written a history of Iraq.</p>
<p>Still, in Iraqi eyes its claim is buttressed by longtime
cultural and economic links between Kuwait and Iraq. Kuwaiti
sheiks, for instance, once owned large date plantations in
Iraq. And Iraq once provided nearly all of Kuwait's fresh
water, until the Kuwaitis built big plants to desalinate
Persian Gulf water, Ms. Helms says.</p>
<p>And there's a more current dispute that underlies the
Iraqi move. An oil field known as the Rumaila field straddles
the Iraq-Kuwait border, and Iraq claims that Kuwait had been
drilling diagonally from its side of the border to tap
reserves from the field lying under Iraqi territory. U.S.
officials say there is reason to think the Iraqi claim may be
true.</p>
