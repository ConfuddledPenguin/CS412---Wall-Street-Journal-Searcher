	<p class="article-leader">Nestle S.A. posted sales of 22.7 billion francs ($16.9
billion) for the first half of 1990, compared with 22.8
billion francs a year earlier.
   The Vevey, Switzerland, food company cited the weakness of
several currencies against the Swiss franc as the main reason
for the flat sales. The results matched analysts'
expectations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts expect Nestle's group net income for the full
year to rise as much as 10%, depending on currency rates,
from the year-earlier 2.41 billion francs.</p>
