	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Running counter to the industry trend, Fuji
Securities Inc., the U.S. government securities trading arm
of Japan's Fuji Bank Ltd., is adding staff.
   The firm said it is hiring 33 people from the defunct
Westpac Pollack Government Securities Inc., the primary
dealer subsidiary of Australia's Westpac Banking Corp.
Westpac closed the unit in June, citing lack of
profitability.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Fuji's move is a surprising one in a market devastated by
losses and littered with dropouts. Primary dealers are an
elite group of 41 firms that deal directly with the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York when it buys and sells U.S.
government securities as part of its activities to influence
U.S. monetary policy. Once, a dealership was one of the most
coveted franchises in international finance.</p>
<p>But lately many firms have cut staff and, so far this
year, five financial institutions have given up or lost their
primary-dealer status. The latest are Bank of New York and
Midland Bank PLC, both of which abandoned the business within
the past month. Dealers' earnings are being squeezed by low
trading volume and -- except for the last few days following
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait -- reduced volatility, which
traders need to enhance profits.</p>
<p>But mostly, too many firms chasing too few customers has
reduced profit margins and left many firms with bloated
overhead costs.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Fuji is gambling that with the 33 new hires
"we should be able to get a large part of {Westpac Pollack's}
business with 20% of their people and 10% of their cost,"
said Mitchell Shivers, president and chief executive officer
of Fuji Securities, which is based in Chicago. "We didn't
have a strategy to rapidly increase our New York operation,
but we didn't want to turn down an opportunity to hire very
good talent." Westpac Pollack had about 160 employees.</p>
<p>The former Westpac people will remain in New York and be
merged with Fuji's small office here. Fuji executives said
there were no plans to cut any of the firm's current staff of
107.</p>
<p>Last December, Fuji acquired 100% of the primary
dealership that had previously been controlled by Britain's
Kleinwort Benson Group PLC.</p>
<p>People familiar with the government securities market said
that Fuji currently has a little over a 1.5% share of the
primary dealer market and that before closing, Westpac
Pollack had roughly 2% or a bit more. They also said while
Fuji currently was breaking even, the added Westpac staff
could increase both Fuji's profits and market share. They
said that Westpac Pollack was regarded as a successful
trading operation, but that its revenue was chewed up by very
high overhead costs.</p>
<p>Mr. Shivers said that the former Westpac people give Fuji
a new or strengthened ability to trade Treasury bills, U.S.
federal agency securities and odd-lot orders. The latter
involve amounts less than the $1 million and above round-lot
sizes normally traded.</p>
<p>Moreover, Mr. Shivers said: "We consider ourselves to be a
low-cost producer," something a growing number of executives
consider a key to surviving in the U.S. Treasury market.</p>
