	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Lionel Corp. said it formed a joint venture
with Isaac Perlmutter, former head of Odd Lot Trading Corp.,
to purchase the Job Lot/Pushcart retail chain from Pic "N"
Save Corp.
   Through the venture, Job Lot Associates L.P., Lionel and
Mr. Perlmutter will contribute $3 million each to the Job
Lot/Pushcart chain, which consists of 14 closeout stores in
the New York metropolitan area. Under the agreement, Lionel
will contribute only inventory to the stores; Mr. Perlmutter
will contribute cash and inventory.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Lionel, which operates 94 specialty toy stores in 15
states, has been under pressure from some shareholders to
find a buyer. Earlier this year, the company turned down
investor Robert I. Toussie's offer of $8 a share, or $94.4
million.</p>
<p>Mr. Perlmutter is a principal in a media-buying company
that has Lionel as a client, and Lionel has purchased toy
inventory from companies controlled by Mr. Perlmutter's
Admerex International Inc.</p>
<p>Trendex Capital Management Corp., a Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
concern representing a dissident group of Lionel shareholders
with a 5% stake, had asked Lionel to form a panel of
outsiders to examine Lionel's relationship with Mr.
Perlmutter -- a request the company refused. The Trendex
group also has asked Lionel not to impede prospective
acquirers such as Mr. Toussie, who dropped his bid earlier
this year when the stock was trading for $5.625 a share.</p>
<p>In American Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
Lionel stock closed at $2.625 a share, unchanged.</p>
