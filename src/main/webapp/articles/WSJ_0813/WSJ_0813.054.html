	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- Shawmut National Corp. said that it entered into
agreements with federal bank regulators to strengthen certain
lending practices, credit review, liquidity planning and
management information systems.
   The agreements follow a regulatory review of the bank
concluded during the second quarter, which ended June 30.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Of several agreements with regulators, the most
significant is a "formal agreement" with the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency. That document, which the bank
will sign in a few days, is a regulatory measure exceeded by
a formal enforcement action -- like that brought against Bank
of Boston Corp. last October -- and, after that, by a cease
and desist order. Of the large regional banks in New England,
only the Bank of New England Corp. has received a cease and
desist order -- a regulatory action just a step below an
actual bank seizure.</p>
<p>Joel B. Alvord, Shawmut's chairman and chief executive
officer, said "We believe that the provisions of these
agreements will serve to assure our long-term strength."</p>
<p>Along with other New England banks, Shawmut, with $26.6
billion in assets, is wrestling with a large portfolio of
real estate loans in a softening regional real estate market.
The bank's nonperforming loans and foreclosed property rose
to $1.31 billion at the end of the second quarter, up from
$1.16 billion in the first quarter. Total loan loss reserves
stood at $748.3 million, or 4.48% of total loans outstanding,
compared with $287 million in reserves, 1.53% of total loans,
on June 30, 1989.</p>
<p>Carrying $1.31 billion in nonperforming assets -- money
lent out that is bringing no return -- causes a heavy drain
on Shawut's capital because the bank must continue to pay
interest on that money to depositors. The losses tend to be
about 9% of the total nonperforming portfolio, or, in
Shawmut's case, approximately $120 million annually.</p>
<p>In reviewing the bank's nonperforming assets, Thomas F.
Theurkauf, the bank's senior vice president, noted Shawmut
took one step forward in clearing away nonperformers in the
second quarter, but was pushed two steps back -- with $237.5
million in fresh, non-accruing loans appearing on the bank's
books.</p>
<p>"The content of the {OCC} agreement we are not giving
out," said a bank spokesman. "All I'll say is that the
economic scenario this is all being driven by is we have a
regional economy that is at least six to nine months from
stabilizing. All the banks up here are fighting the same
situation we are."</p>
