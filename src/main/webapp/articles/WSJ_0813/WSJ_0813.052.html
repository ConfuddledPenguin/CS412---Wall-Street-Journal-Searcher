	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- The European computer market may be nearing the
end of an era.
   Almost since computers began, U.S. manufacturers like
International Business Machines Corp. have dominated the
market in Europe. U.S. companies get three out of every four
dollars spent on mainframe computers there, and U.S. products
account for at least half of all computer sales. Last year,
as its U.S. operations bled red, IBM leaned on Europe for 71%
of its net income.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But now Japanese companies are coming on strong. Among the
first was Toshiba Corp., grabbing the market lead in laptop
computer sales. Last week, Fujitsu Ltd. one-upped that by
agreeing to buy control of Britain's biggest computer maker,
International Computers Ltd., or ICL. With less flash but
equal resolve, Hitachi Ltd. and Mitsubishi Electric Corp. are
also expanding.</p>
<p>So far, the Japanese hold less than 10% of the $110
billion European computer market. But nobody -- least of all
the endangered Americans -- thinks they'll stop there. "We
expect the Japanese to increase their role," says David E.
McKinney, chief of IBM's European computer business.</p>
<p>For the Japanese, Europe is the latest battleground in a
30-year campaign to overtake the U.S. computer giants. Adding
Europe, a third of the global computer market, to their
territory would increase their world-wide economies of scale.
For the U.S., a tough competitor would thereby become
downright frightening; the ICL purchase agreement makes
Fujitsu the world's second-biggest computer maker, vaulting
it ahead of U.S.-based Digital Equipment Corp.</p>
<p>No. 1 IBM is the target. In Europe, "we aren't competing
with European manufacturers; we're competing with IBM," says
Soji Endo, manager of overseas operations for Hitachi's
computer business. "We try to scratch a little bit from
{IBM's} market."</p>
<p>But Adam Quinton, of London stockbrokers UBS-Phillips &
Drew, notes that the Japanese threat is a long-term one: "I
don't think it's a question of IBM needing to do anything
dramatic" today, he says. And IBM's Mr. McKinney says: "Our
strategy doesn't change. We're going to work very hard to
stay competitive."</p>
<p>Ultimately, European consumers will decide the winner.
Force of habit will be a big factor: Most big European
corporations already have huge investments in American
software.</p>
<p>Technology will be another factor. Despite past U.S.
strength, Japan is moving up fast. The computer-screen
technology in today's laptops, for instance, comes mostly
from Tokyo. In the end, says Bruno d'Avanzo, Digital's
European marketing boss, the computer war in Europe "boils
down to American technology vs. Japanese technology."</p>
<p>Such talk annoys native European computer makers, but
they're becoming irrelevant. Often weak in technology and
finance, the major European manufacturers never managed more
than a 25% share of their home market in the 1980s -- and now
they're losing even that.</p>
<p>All but the strongest European hardware maker, West
Germany's Siemens AG, have recently reported losses or
sluggish sales. In the confusion, the Japanese are picking up
some of the pieces. ICL was Fujitsu's prize. Mitsubishi
gobbled up ailing Apricot Computers Ltd., once the biggest
personal-computer maker in Britain.</p>
<p>Next, analysts say, may be Italy's struggling Ing. C.
Olivetti & Co. or the unprofitable computer business of N.V.
Philips of the Netherlands; both have been seeking foreign
partners. The only sure survivors will be Siemens with its
financial muscle, and French state-owned Groupe Bull with its
political backing.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, all eyes are on European
Community headquarters in Brussels. Though the EC has no
ideological reason to favor one country's industry over the
other's, it's leery of Japan because of past trade friction
and Japan's late entry into an overcrowded market. Another
possible boost for the Americans may be an alliance with the
EC to link computer-research programs; talks exploring that
option began last month in Washington and Brussels. The EC
might also try to force Tokyo to ease entry to its market for
European companies.</p>
<p>With 1992 and a unified European market approaching, the
EC is also unlikely to sit idly by as its native computer
industry withers. "My view is the world needs equilibrium" of
computer production among Europe, Japan and the U.S., warns
Filippo Maria Pandolfi, the EC's science and research
commissioner. "I am strongly in favor of maintaining the
capacity of the European industry."</p>
<p>But it's already too late for Britain. Computer science
began here, with 19th-century mathematician Charles Babbage;
and though the Pentagon made the first primitive electronic
computer, Cambridge University was the birthplace in 1949 of
the first machine to store programs.</p>
<p>That's moldy history now. Nearly every computer-hardware
engineer in Britain today works for a U.S. or Japanese
company. Excluding troubled PC maker Amstrad PLC, "there
really isn't anybody left in the information technology
industry in the U.K.," laments Peter Horne, Apricot's
managing director.</p>
<p>Apricot, put on the block last winter by its founders, was
a shuttlecock between Japanese and U.S. bidders. Japanese
flexibility and tact, not price, were deciding factors in
choosing the winner, says Roger Foster, managing director of
Apricot's former parent, now called ACT Group PLC.
Mitsubishi, though no major player in the Japanese computer
market, pleased him with its pledges to become a good,
long-term partner for both Apricot and ACT. By contrast, the
Americans struck Mr. Foster as prickly. "The Americans were
preoccupied with all the legal problems" and risks, he says.</p>
<p>The sale stirred little political controversy. In the
early 1980s, Apricot's catchy name (a play on better-known
Apple) and snazzy technology made it the U.K. market leader.
But it was too small to compete easily with multinationals,
and it blew its lead with a few marketing blunders. By last
year, it had sunk to fifth place in the U.K. PC market. Under
the circumstances, the Japanese were welcomed as saviors.</p>
<p>The honeymoon is now in its fourth month. A one-month
salary bonus for all 400 Apricot employees helped ensure good
will. A typically British summer party, held under a canopy
in a Yorkshire field, smoothed relations with dealers. Next,
Mitsubishi plans to expand Apricot's product-development
staff and to install new equipment in its Scottish PC
factory.</p>
<p>The Japanese know that success in computers -- as in the
automobile and consumer electronics industries -- is partly a
matter of global economies of scale. Hitherto, Japan's
computer giants were preoccupied with their home market and
the U.S.; Europe was an afterthought. Now Europe, with its
1992-related economic growth and the opening of former East
bloc markets, has appeal.</p>
<p>Fujitsu's managing director and vice-general manager,
Michio Naruto, hopes that 70% of the company's revenue will
come from outside Japan by the end of the decade, up from 35%
today.</p>
<p>In one European market niche, victory has already gone to
Tokyo. In 1986, armed with new technology for easy-to-read,
portable computer screens, Toshiba rushed into the European
market with its laptop computers. To sell the machines,
Toshiba's marketers in Europe -- themselves Europeans --
methodically targeted the continent's top PC dealers, already
used by IBM and Compaq Computer Corp. At the time, neither
U.S. company had a comparable product, so Toshiba was an
instant hit. Last year, on the strength of its specialized
laptops alone, it was the sixth biggest PC vendor in Europe.</p>
<p>Once entrenched, the Japanese can be hard to dislodge.
According to market researchers Dataquest Inc., Toshiba last
year had a 39% share of the laptop market in Europe, compared
with Compaq's 16%. "We're taking share back," says Joseph
McNally, Compaq's British boss. But despite Compaq's status
as the second-biggest vendor of PCs in Europe, surveys show
Toshiba's name has more clout among British consumers.</p>
<p>Still, Toshiba may be a special case. For the Japanese
generally, building a continent-wide sales network from
scratch will be difficult. The number of attractive takeover
targets in Europe is small. And the risk of a political
backlash is great.</p>
<p>"The Japanese over time have a chance of being strong {in
Europe}, but a lot of things have to happen before they get
there," says Digital's Mr. d'Avanzo. Among other things, he
says, the Japanese must learn to write software and provide
computer services to suit the tastes of European customers.</p>
<p>For the European companies, providing such software and
services may be their last refuge. Already, as their hardware
businesses weaken, Bull and Olivetti are rushing into the
faster-growing software and service markets. At this rate,
some analysts predict, most in the European industry could
end up as glorified repackagers of hardware mass-produced by
Japanese and U.S. giants. The native European hardware
industry could shrivel, just as the U.S. consumer-electronics
industry withered in the face of strong Far East competition.</p>
<p>The thought chills some Europeans. "I cannot imagine such
a danger," says Francis Lorentz, Bull's chairman and chief
executive. No matter what happens, he says, the sheer
dynamism of a post-1992, post-Cold War Europe will provide
enough business for all to prosper -- Japanese, American and
European. "We have fantastic market opportunities for the
future," he says. "Europe today has become the major
battlefield in our industry."</p>
