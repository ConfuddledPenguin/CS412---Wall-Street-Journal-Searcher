	<p class="article-leader">Comstock Resources Inc., Dallas, said it reached a
definite 15-year agreement for the sale of all casinghead gas
produced at its 54,000-acre Bivins Ranch lease in Texas.
   Comstock said Maple Gas Corp. agreed to purchase the gas
and to install processing facilities that will have a
capacity of 20 million cubic feet a day by Dec. 1. Subject to
Comstock's deliverability, capacity will increase to 40
million cubic feet a day by April 1. Comstock said production
would come from 102 wells, each producing about five barrels
of oil and at least 180,000 cubic feet of gas a day. Comstock
said the number of producing wells on the lease would
increase.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Comstock said Maple, a private Texas company, would
construct pipeline connections and gathering facilities at an
estimated cost of $20 million. Starting Dec. 1, Maple will
pay Comstock based on 90% of residue gas and 70% of all
liquids extracted by the processing facilities, Comstock
said.</p>
<p>Comstock said that proceeds from its public offering in
May are being used to fund completion of its well and
drilling program on the Bivins lease. It said the proceeds
were also used to pay off all bank debt.</p>
