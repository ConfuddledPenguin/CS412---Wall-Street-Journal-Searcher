	<p class="article-leader">RALEIGH, N.C. -- Following public outcry about the huge
run-up in gasoline prices, the state attorney general filed
suit against Exxon Corp., alleging deceptive trade practices.
   While a number of states have said they would pursue
investigations into allegations of price-gouging and
profiteering by major oil companies after the Iraqi invasion
of Kuwait, it is believed this is the first suit following
the big gasoline price increases.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>North Carolina charged that Exxon raised its wholesale
gasoline prices to distributors by as much as six cents a
gallon after contracting to sell that gasoline at a lower
price. In some cases, the state alleges, distributors had
made deliveries to service stations before learning of the
increase in prices.</p>
<p>An Exxon spokesman in Houston declined to comment on the
suit.</p>
