	<p class="article-leader">The 1965 Watts riots that left 35 people dead began with
the arrest of a black motorist. Such was the rage against the
police, the grievances over joblessness and discrimination
within this large black Los Angeles neighborhood, that it
required only the sight of a white policeman arresting an
intoxicated black driver to start the Molotov cocktails
flying. That, at any rate, is the premise of "Heat Wave,"
airing tonight on TNT (8-10 p.m. EDT).
   This dramatization of the riots was written by Michael
Lazarou and produced by Jon Avnet and Jordan Kerner. They
deserve notice, first of all, for having produced one of the
most simple-minded sociopolitical tracts seen on a TV screen
in recent years, which is saying a lot. Second, their show is
unremittingly silly, when it is not vicious, in its
stereotyping of whites.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>One learns something about the mindset of this movie from
its efforts to portray a sympathetic white. The only white
uppermiddle-class resident of Los Angeles not represented as
some sort of murderous yahoo, for example, is one Mrs.
Canfield, a spacey, childlike character portrayed by Sally
Kirkland with, it should be said, a certain whiny
effectiveness. If this is what "Heat Wave's" creative minds
have brought forth by way of a token "good" white, you can
imagine the others.</p>
<p>Based loosely -- one hopes -- on the recollections of the
black Los Angeles Times reporter Bob Richardson, the movie
chronicles a black family's struggles in Los Angeles, the
mecca to which they migrated with high hopes several years
before the riots. They discovered that in the California of
the early '60s, as in the South, facilities for blacks were
separate but not equal, that the police could be abusive and
that good jobs for blacks were rare.</p>
<p>The family's head, known as Mother-Dear if you should need
a hint as to her character, is the cook, housekeeper and
surrogate grandmother to the wealthy Canfields to whom she
also dispenses spiritual and psychological guidance.
Mother-Dear, (Cicely Tyson) is concerned only with church,
family and with the Canfields, who sorely need her patient
wisdom and care. You get the picture.</p>
<p>Mother-Dear sees her unemployed son turn to drinking,
along with her grandson who, we are informed, burned with
ambition to be a jet pilot until discouraged by a guidance
counselor. It takes just one session with a high-school
guidance counselor, according to this film, to turn a
zealous, open-hearted, sky's-the-limit ambitious youth into a
snarling ne'er-do-well. Pop into the guidance counselor's
office a few minutes and out comes a criminal. Such is the
magic of character development in our times.</p>
<p>But even though afflicted by alcoholism and lack of
opportunity, Mother-Dear's own family is an admirable bunch
compared with the unhappy and strife-ridden Canfields.
Insistently and crudely, the stereotypes of the sterile,
loveless, cowardly and materialistic whites are juxtaposed
with portrayals of universally loving, loyal and devoted
black couples. Any failures of character among these blacks,
we are regularly reminded, derive solely from discrimination.
Nevertheless, virtually every black in evidence is a hero of
one kind or another. Every white person in evidence, except
for the childlike Mrs. Canfield, and briefly, a policeman not
much less childlike, is either a redneck thug, a hypocrite or
worse.</p>
<p>After the Watts uproar begins, and there are attacks on
motorists, rioters announce plans to attack white
neighborhoods, and that threat inspires some whites in the
threatened neighborhoods to try to arm themselves. An
unpleasant-looking crowd of white males in a gun store stands
around looking for all the world like a mob gathered for a
lynching, which is, of course, precisely the way they were
intended to look. Notwithstanding who is threatening whom, it
is clear the film means to portray these weapons-seekers as
the immoral ones.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Molotov cocktails are flying
pell-mell through Watts. But these deadly weapons are
evidently to be judged on another scale of morality from the
weapons purchased by whites in self-defense. For in this
case, we are clearly supposed to view the improvised missiles
as political symbols, emblems of rebellion. Lest anyone be
confused over the moral difference, the film makers have
provided an instructive scene, played out at the Canfield
residence. None other than Mother-Dear's employer, the surly
and dyspeptic Mr. Canfield, stands waiting by the window, gun
in hand. Horrified, Mother-Dear offers to pray for him.</p>
<p>Watts burned for six days thanks to the Molotov cocktails
that helped take out 600 buildings. It can be said of this
film, at least, that it is straightforward about the riot's
ugliness and violence. Still, it manages to glorify this
event in which 30 blacks and five whites died, and to
represent it as a kind of important political act.</p>
<p>Certain aspects of these events, of course, are harder to
pass off as political activism than others. Representing the
large-scale looting of stores as an act of political
expression, for example, has always been a questionable
proposition, and that applies no less to the Watts riots.
Still, there can be no doubt that the residents of Watts felt
their deprivations keenly, and that their rage fueled the
explosion.</p>
<p>Watts was a complex tragedy, meriting better than this
hash of politically progressive cliches and stereotypes. The
worst thing about the film's portrayal of blacks is that it
represents them -- with but few exceptions -- as victims
wholly without inner resources, people whose lives and
character are shaped exclusively by their helplessness, lack
of initiative, lack of any focus except resentment against
whites.</p>
<p>In the '70s there was a great to-do about violent,
so-called black-exploitation films such as "Superfly." This
is another, far more insidious kind of exploitation of blacks
in film. It is also guilty, in its treatment of whites, of
something normally called racism when such stuff is directed
at blacks.</p>
