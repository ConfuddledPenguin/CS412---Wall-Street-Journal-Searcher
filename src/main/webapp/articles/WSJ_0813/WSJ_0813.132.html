	<h3>Advertising: Ad Spending For 2nd Half Looks Bleak</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">In the wake of the Iraqi invasion, with the twin threats
of inflation and recession looming at home, the advertising
business is facing a second half that may be even worse than
expected.
   After a generally slow first half, ad agency executives --
professionally optimistic, as usual -- had been promising
some recovery in the second half and next year. But the
Mideast crisis, and the economic threat that it set off,
appear to have splashed very cold water on that idea, some
executives said last week. Several said they are girding for
possible further client spending cutbacks. And the agencies
themselves have begun re-evaluating their own costs to see if
they can batten down and prepare for the worst.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We haven't had any specific reaction from a client
saying, `The economy is bad, we have to cut,' but I've got to
tell you, I would be brain-dead not to feel that the yellow
light is on," says Burton Manning, chairman and chief
executive officer of WPP Group's J. Walter Thompson Co. unit.
"We're on budget now. But whether that will continue in light
of all this news, I just don't know."</p>
<p>As events unfold, Thompson, like other agencies, is also
taking a second look at its own expenses, such as new hires
and department expansions. "We haven't stopped," Mr. Manning
says, "but we don't have our foot to the floor. We want to
make sure we aren't going to be foolish in terms of our own
costs."</p>
<p>Several big agencies had already been scrambling to cut
costs. Interpublic, where domestic ad revenue dropped 5% to
6% in the first half, won't allow anyone to fly first class
beginning Sept. 1. The agency is also considering wage and
hiring freezes, says Eugene Beard, executive vice president.
And it is scrutinizing entertainment costs, chipping away at
what once was the backbone of Madison Avenue culture.</p>
<p>The specter of rising oil prices adds yet another problem
to the already dangerous mix of the budget deficit and the
savings and loan crisis, Mr. Beard says. And that doesn't
augur well for client spending.</p>
<p>"Clients are deferring spending or just cutting budgets,"
he says. The cuts are "incremental, 2% to 3%, not radical,"
he says, but they add up. As a result, Interpublic "is
looking at every single item in our operations. There are no
sacred cows." He adds, though, that the agency group isn't
considering layoffs and that it isn't changing its 1990
earnings forecast of $2.35 to $2.40 a share.</p>
<p>Should Mideast tensions escalate and oil shortages result,
almost all major advertisers would be affected, ad executives
say. Manufacturers would see expenses rise, appliance and
home entertainment businesses would be hurt by rising costs
and skittish consumers, and travel-related industries would
be squeezed.</p>
<p>"It will impact just about every business in the country,
and some will cut advertising spending," says Bob Wolf,
chairman and chief executive of North American operations at
ad agency Chiat/Day/Mojo. "Advertising is something a lot of
people believe they can cut short-term. Many times that's a
serious mistake."</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf believes the Iraqi situation makes the economic
outlook for advertising "dramatically different" from just a
few weeks ago. He hadn't been optimistic even before. In the
past two weeks, Chiat laid off about 40 people, imposed pay
cuts on senior management, and replaced the top management of
its New York office following a rash of account losses. Mr.
Wolf says a number of remaining clients, including American
Express, New York Life Insurance and Arrow shirts, have
slashed ad spending.</p>
<p>With the escalating threat in the Middle East, Mr. Wolf
says: "There's no good news on the horizon. I think optimism
would be if it {the economy} stays the way it is. Pessimism
is it's going to get worse."</p>
<p>Not everyone agrees with that dire picture, though. At
Omnicom Group, ad revenue grew a better-than-average 8% in
the first half and will probably continue at that pace in the
second half, says Fred Meyer, chief financial officer. He
says the agency was spared in part because it isn't involved
in product categories that have slashed ad spending, such as
cigarettes. And, while a number of car companies have pared
spending, Omnicom's two auto clients, Chrysler and
Volkswagen/Audi, "had practically no cutbacks," he says.</p>
<p>McCann-Erickson's top ad spending guru, Robert Coen, has
been predicting a modest 5.3% increase in 1990 U.S. ad
spending. He believes the Iraqi situation won't much change
that. He notes that after the 1973 oil embargo, ad spending
by food, packaged goods, liquor and other major consumer
companies "did surprisingly well. . . . It held up."</p>
<p>Furthermore, if inflation does threaten as a result of the
Iraqi situation, he contends, "it could help advertising." He
reasons that with inflation on the rise, companies might not
be so quick to pour money into promotions, such as price
breaks given to retailers as an incentive to stock products.
Manufacturers will "figure their expenses are going to be
higher, so why give big discounts to retailers?" he says.
Instead, he suggests: "Advertising's relative importance
could rise. There may be a return to basic advertising,
rather than daily price cuts."</p>

<p>Korey Dies at 56</p>
<p>Lois Korey, president of ad agency Korey, Kay & Partners,
New York, died Thursday night of a heart attack. She was 56
years old.</p>
<p>Ms. Korey set up the agency more than eight years ago with
Allen Kay, her longtime collaborator. Together, Ms. Korey and
Mr. Kay created the New York area Honda ads that featured
"Danny," a woeful car salesman who sells "the car that sells
itself." They also created ads for Members Only clothing.</p>
<p>Mr. Kay, who is the shop's chairman, said there are no
plans to replace Ms. Korey as president. "We were two people
who functioned as one person," he said.</p>

<p>Ad Notes. . . .</p>
<p>LONDON ACQUISITION: As expected, D'Arcy Masius Benton &
Bowles acquired Yellowhammer PLC, a financially troubled
London ad agency with billings of about #60 million ($112
million). DMB&B said its London office would operate
separately from Yellowhammer. Terms weren't disclosed.</p>
