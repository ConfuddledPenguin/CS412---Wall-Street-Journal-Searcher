	<p class="article-leader">AmeriFirst Bank of Miami said it signed an agreement with
the Office of Thrift Supervision that puts it under the
strict control of regulators in the areas of commercial
lending, foreclosures and development real estate.
   AmeriFirst said in a statement that the agreement permits
federal regulators to appoint a conservator or receiver for
the institution if it deems the step necessary.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The thrift said the pact allows "the bank to continue to
serve fully its retail and deposit customers."</p>
<p>AmeriFirst has been hurt by a large portfolio of troubled
commercial real-estate loans.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, after spending more than a year as
chairman of the board, M. Lee Pearce, a prominent Miami
businessman, resigned, saying he felt he had done all he
could. He was succeeded by Laurence Brodym, a local dentist.</p>
<p>As reported, AmeriFirst recently said a capital plan,
which included an infusion of private capital, appeared
"infeasible," and, as a result, the Office of Thrift
Supervision rejected it.</p>
