	<h3>Mideast Crisis Dashes Hopes for Rebound In Corporate Profits in the Second Half</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">The likelihood of a second-half rebound in corporate
profits all but died with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   Many U.S. manufacturers had expected 1990 profits to be
the mirror image of 1989 results, starting out slowly as
companies completed the inventory reduction begun in late
1989, but then improving noticeably in the second half. The
oil crisis makes it more likely that profits will continue to
slip until sometime in 1991.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Even optimistic economists who don't expect higher oil
prices to trigger a recession say after-tax corporate profits
will decline in 1990 for the second consecutive year. Richard
D. Rippe, senior vice president and chief economist with Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc., is looking for a 2% to 3% dip from
1989's $167.1 billion.</p>
<p>Among the more bearish forecasters, A. Gary Shilling, New
York economic consultant, says the crisis is "the last nail
in the coffin of this expansion." He's forecasting a 12% to
14% profit drop for 1990. David Bostian, managing director
and chief economist for Jesup, Josephthal & Co., believes "we
were in a recession before the invasion occurred." Piling on
the Middle East crisis will produce some "downright scary"
earnings reports because of "the downside leverage of high
corporate debt."</p>
<p>Even before Saddam Hussein plunged across the border, the
profit outlook was less favorable than manufacturing
executives had expected during the spring. Demand was a
little weaker than anticipated, triggering discounting on
products ranging from tires to machine tools and preventing
producers of other items from raising prices to pass through
higher costs. And costs rose a little more than had been
budgeted.</p>
<p>In addition, many multinational corporations are incurring
losses in Brazil. The combination drove profits in the second
quarter down 11% from a year earlier, according to a Wall
Street Journal compilation of reports from 639 major
companies.</p>
<p>The Mideast crisis compounds those problems. Even if oil
prices level off in the low to mid $20s for the rest of this
year, the bill for oil and basic chemical feedstocks will
rise 25% or more at many factories. It will be hard to pass
that along, particularly if uncertainty created by the
invasion causes both consumers and companies to rein in their
spending a bit.</p>
<p>Dow Chemical Co. provides a good illustration of the
profit problems. The Midland, Mich., chemicals and plastics
producer reported a 50% drop in second-quarter net, shocking
industry analysts who looked for a more moderate drop from
last year's unusually fat profits. Dow officials said
second-half earnings would be even weaker than the first
half. Anticipated price increases hadn't appeared, and prices
of some products, such as polyethylene, actually declined,
Dow says. Also, the construction, automotive and furniture
markets are weaker than expected.</p>
<p>Rising oil prices worsen the outlook, Dow says, but it's
too early to estimate how seriously. Dow's plants use huge
amounts of energy, and oil is a basic feedstock for many of
its plastics and organic chemicals. The extent of the profit
drop will depend on Dow's success in passing through those
cost increases.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are few pluses for business in the
current crisis, other than for oil producers and oil-field
service concerns. And the oil companies already are under
political pressure to hold down prices; there's talk of
additional taxes to siphon off any windfall profits.</p>
<p>The first impact of the crisis will be weaker sales
arising from increased uncertainty. Companies insist that
they're proceeding with capital spending programs, product
development and other long-term projects. Most will do that.
Some plant managers may place orders quickly, before the
authority to do so is revoked by skittish boards. But more
companies will move a little more slowly as they watch
Mideast developments.</p>
<p>More important, they're likely to hold back on routine
replacements of trucks, machinery and office equipment, says
Stephen R. Hardis, vice chairman and chief financial and
administrative officer of Eaton Corp., Cleveland-based maker
of truck parts and electrical and electronic products.
Already companies such as American Steel & Wire Corp.,
Cuyahoga Heights, Ohio, say they're watching inventories and
expenses a little more closely.</p>
<p>Consumers, who already were dragging their feet on
purchases of cars, appliances and other major items, also are
likely to pause, at least briefly. Besides, a little more of
their money is going abroad as they pay higher prices for
gasoline and heating oil.</p>
<p>And if the crisis drags on until Christmas, the year's
biggest shopping season could suffer. "And there are a lot of
shaky retailers out there," adds Gary E. Morin, vice
president for finance and chief financial officer of Huffy
Corp., the nation's largest bicycle maker. "If they don't
have a good Christmas, manufacturers will be writing off a
lot of receivables" as the retailers fold.</p>
<p>As Mr. Bostian suggests, the profit impact of the weaker
sales will be amplified by high corporate interest expense
and other fixed costs.</p>
