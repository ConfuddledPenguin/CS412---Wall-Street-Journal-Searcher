	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo stocks retreated to a new 1990 low, with waves of
arbitrage selling accelerating the slide Friday afternoon as
investors held off buying ahead of a possible weekend
worsening of the Persian Gulf crisis.
   London shares finished lower in subdued dealings as events
in the Middle East overshadowed any genuine interest in the
market.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Tokyo's Nikkei index of 225 issues lost 286.18 to finish
at 27329.55. The index plunged 893.41 points Thursday. Volume
on the first section was estimated at 320 million shares,
down from 409.4 million Thursday. Losers outnumbered gainers
616-303, with 169 unchanged.</p>
<p>At the end of the morning session in Tokyo Monday, the
Nikkei index had tumbled 763.12 points, or 2.8%, to 26566.43
on selling by arbitragers.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section, which lost 31.61 Thursday, was down 11.53, or
0.56%, at 2056.88 Friday. The Second Section Index, which
gained 22.25 Thursday, was down 0.83, or 0.02%, to close at
4112.11. Volume in the second section was estimated at 11
million shares, down from 14.8 million.</p>
<p>"There was no bad news for the market, with both currency
and bond markets stable and no significant developments in
the Middle East," said a trader at James Capel Pacific.</p>
<p>"Investors who are nervous about the Iraqi issue have
already sold off their holdings," the trader said. "But
investors can't buy, due to fears that something may happen
over the weekend."</p>
<p>Petroleum shares ended mixed, with Teikoku Oil down 110
yen at 1,610 yen ($10.75) a share, but Mitsubishi Oil edged
up 10 to 1,280.</p>
<p>High-priced technology shares ended generally lower. Sony
lost 120 to 7,810, while TDK fell 160 to 6,450.</p>
<p>Isetan advanced 140 to 4,420, prompting speculation that
the buying may be linked to a merger and acquisition attempt,
traders said.</p>
<p>Paper and pulp makers were sold, with Jujo Paper down 21
to 730 and Oji Paper falling 20 to 960.</p>
<p>Shionogi lost 90 to 1,210 on rumors about side effects
from the company's blood pressure-reducing drugs, traders
said.</p>
<p>Plant engineering companies fell sharply, as their
activities in Iraq and Kuwait have been frozen by Japan's
economic sanctions against Iraq. Chiyoda lost 150 to 1,660.</p>
<p>In London, investors were said to be flattening out
positions ahead of the weekend in case the Middle East became
more volatile before today. Most participants fled to the
sidelines and were unwilling to open fresh positions,
commentators said.</p>
<p>In addition, a murky start on Wall Street and a drop
during the London afternoon caused players to take a more
cautious footing, dealers said. At the close of the London
session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 27.23
points at 2731.68.</p>
<p>There was also a dearth of major corporate or economic
news, giving players little incentive to adjust current
short-term positions, traders said. And some strong falls in
international stocks, which were nervous in the wake of the
Middle East turmoil, also sent the market lower late in the
session.</p>
<p>At the closing bell, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was down 11.1 at 2233.8, the day's low and
well below its opening peak of 2249.2.</p>
<p>The FT 30-share industrial index was down 9.8 at 1743.0.
Volume was a meager 312.4 million shares, compared with 429.2
million issues a day earlier.</p>
<p>Among the few corporate features, health and household
products group Glaxo Holdings fell 43 pence to 761 pence
($16.08) a share. Forecasts for the company's 1990 pretax
profit were downgraded to #1.05 billion by Schroder
Securities Ltd. from a previous estimate of #1.15 billion.</p>
<p>The downgrading came on worries that the strength of the
pound against the dollar could affect the company's earnings.
In addition, Glaxo's American Depositary Receipts were sold
heavily on Wall Street overnight, dealers said.</p>
<p>Carlton Communication had another steep fall, shedding 41
to 319. Dealers said the stock dropped as one large sell
order had difficulty being placed.</p>
<p>ICI, Britain's largest chemical concern, shed 25 to 941 as
market-makers tried to get rid of stock picked up since the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait Aug. 2, dealers said. They said
investors are shying away from international stocks because
of uncertainty over world economies in the wake of higher
crude-oil prices.</p>
<p>Anglo-Dutch health and household products group Unilever
fell 9 to 661. The company said second-quarter pretax profit
rose 4.8% to #477 million, although analysts suggested that
the 1989 purchases of Faberge/Elizabeth Arden and Calvin
Klein had hindered results because of large interest
payments.</p>
<p>Among other oil stocks, British Petroleum rose 2 to 360,
and Ultramar retreated 5 to 345.</p>
<p>Ultramar said it contracted to buy three one
million-barrel capacity oil tankers for $212 million from
Samsung Shipbuilding & Heavy Industries Co. of South Korea.</p>
<p>Ultramar said the ships will secure Ultramar's anticipated
long-term crude oil transportation requirements to its Quebec
refinery on the St. Lawrence River in eastern Canada "at an
advantageous cost."</p>
<p>Brewers Whitbread and Allied-Lyons both dropped sharply,
with Whitbread falling 11 to 411 and Allied-Lyons losing 17
to 477. Whitbread said it agreed to sell its 50% stake in a
joint venture to partner Allied-Lyons. The price wasn't
disclosed.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, Whitbread will sell its half of
European Cellars (Holdings) Ltd., a British shipper and
wholesaler of wines, to the wines and spirits division of
Allied-Lyons.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, share prices closed lower in Frankfurt,
Amsterdam and Madrid, were unchanged in Paris and Zurich and
ended mixed in Brussels, Milan and Stockholm. South African
gold stocks were higher.</p>
<p>In Asian and Pacific markets, shares closed lower in
Tokyo, Singapore, Hong Kong, Wellington, Taipei and Manila
and higher in Seoul and Sydney.</p>
<p>Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.</p>
