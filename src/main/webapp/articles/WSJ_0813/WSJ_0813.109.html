	<p class="article-leader">Some call it "ambush sampling." Some call it "guerrilla
marketing." Whatever the name, it's helping a small company
called Wave Promotions Inc. stand out from the pack of
marketing firms.
   At some New Jersey beaches recently, 25 make-believe
pirates, sporting black eyepatches, red bandannas and
black-and-white clothing, raced into crowds of sunbathers --
not to loot their treasures, but to hand out free bags of
popcorn. Within minutes, 50 to 100 people were thus
"ambush-sampled" by young people hired by Wave, a Washington,
D.C., firm that uses such stunts to promote clients'
products.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Wave's samplers, usually dressed in loud costumes, conduct
ambushes in supermarkets and public parks, on ski slopes and
public sidewalks, reaching as many as 2,000 people in a few
hours. Such attention-getting tactics have helped Wave hook
such big clients as Coca-Cola Co., Lorillard Inc., PepsiCo
Inc.'s Frito-Lay subsidiary, MTV, and Source Perrier S.A. But
the method has its doubters.</p>
<p>"To me, the word `ambush' doesn't sound very upscale,"
says George Avery, regional manager for Bacardi Imports Inc.
Wave conducts much more conservative in-store promotions for
the importer of rum and other liquor products. "They {Wave}
are not doing that for Bacardi," he adds. "I would never use
that technique because all my projects are planned events."</p>
<p>Adds Steven Shugan, a University of Chicago marketing
professor, "Those things only last for so long before the
novelty wears off, and then after a while, the technique
becomes cliche."</p>
<p>None of this is stopping Wave so far. The pirate promotion
was one of several done for Smartfood Inc., a small
Marlborough, Mass., company that -- like Wave -- was out to
make a name for itself. Wave's young samplers have walked
into downtown-Washington rush-hour traffic dressed as giant
popcorn bags to give out Smartfood samples to commuters
caught in traffic. Wave's founders, Mike Napoliello and Jason
Moskowitz, say they develop such projects after looking at
their clients' overall marketing needs.</p>
<p>"Ambush sampling is like finding the largest market by
whatever means necessary," says Mr. Moskowitz, a partner and
chief financial officer for Wave. "The consumer isn't always
in their house watching the `Cosby Show' or listening to the
radio, so we have to go were they are."</p>
<p>Wave's techniques are a new twist to methods used over the
years to promote products, says Robert Blattberg, also a
professor of marketing at the University of Chicago. "They
have just thought of another way to startle the consumer and
cut through the clutter," he says.</p>
<p>What makes ambush sampling different from other so-called
interactive sampling techniques, such as in-store sampling,
is that the promotion, designed to draw a festive crowd of
consumers to sample the product, is an unannounced event.
Most other sampling techniques are cleared with property
owners or managers before the event date.</p>
<p>"We're the uninvited guests or the invited guest,
whichever really doesn't matter much," says Mr. Napoliello, a
partner of Wave and director of client programs. "Sometimes
we just show up at the bar, grocery store or wherever and
just say, `We are here with free T-shirts, may we come in?'
If they say no, we just go to the next place."</p>
<p>But some potential hosts resist in no uncertain terms.
Outside a Who concert in East Rutherford, N.J., two of Wave's
snack-food samplers were arrested by security guards. The
samplers had been told to leave, but simply went to another
area where they were spotted by the guards. Wave says the
samplers were "overambitious."</p>
<p>Despite an occasional chilly welcome, Wave's founders say
the promotional stunts have helped their company grow from
one small office in Spring Lake, N.J., to a national company
with offices in Washington, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston,
Miami and New York. Wave now handles about eight clients at a
time, doing about 15 promotional projects a year. Five years
ago, Wave only did one project at a time.</p>
<p>Mr. Napoliello and Mr. Moskowitz, both 27 years old,
founded Wave in 1981 while in college. Over the past five
years, Wave's staff has increased from three full-time
employees and 10 part-time workers to about 30 full-time and
200 part-time employees nationwide.</p>
<p>Mr. Moskowitz says business for Wave has just "boomed"
over the past two years. He says Wave is profitable and its
1990 revenue has already reached about $2.5 million, compared
with $1.8 million grossed in all of 1989.</p>
<p>Many of Wave's clients say sales increased during Wave
promotions. Stuart Ross, a spokesman for Monsieur Henri
Wines, the importer of Stolichnaya Vodka and a Wave client,
says: "We have had double-digit growth in Stoli sales over
the last five years, and we know that the Wave Promotions had
something to do with that."</p>
<p>Wave has used "bar parties" to promote Stolichnaya. In one
such promotion Wave set up indoor miniature-golf courses in
bars, restaurants and night clubs in Miami during spring
break. Wave decorated the places with Stolichnaya banners and
balloons and gave out free T-shirts. And it usually persuaded
the establishments to offer a discount on the drinks.</p>
<p>Wave also sponsored volleyball tournaments on behalf of
Stolichnaya at Point Pleasant, N.J. Because Wave couldn't
hand out free samples of the vodka, it threw a party at a bar
overlooking the beach and invited the tournament's adult
observers to go join the party. "Anyone over 21 could go to
the party," Mr. Moskowitz says.</p>
<p>For Bacardi, Wave usually puts on in-store demonstrations
giving out free samples of a specially made non-alcoholic
"Bacardi Breezer." The sample supposedly looks and taste like
the alcoholic "Breezers."</p>
<p>Last year, Wave sent a "comedy van" from Washington, D.C.,
to Maine. It stopped at colleges, parks and other places.
Then a comedian called "the Fat Doctor" got on top of the van
with a microphone and went into his act to attract a crowd,
which then was ambush-sampled with Smartfood popcorn.</p>
<p>Smartfood sold about $12 million of its popcorn in the
three years, including two years as a Wave client, before
Smartfood was bought by PepsiCo's Frito-Lay early last year
for about $14.5 million. Smartfood has since dropped Wave. It
claims that it generated the ideas for the Smartfood stunts
that Wave executed. But Frito-Lay remains a Wave client for
promoting such products as Ruffles potato chips.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the young employees who pull off the stunts
seem to enjoy the elaborate sampling events. "It's great,"
says Wendy Meere, who has dressed up as a giant popcorn bag
several times. "It was really exciting because you have all
these little kids running up to you saying, `Hi] It's Mrs.
Popcorn.'"</p>
