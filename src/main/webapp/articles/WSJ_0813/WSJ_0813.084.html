	<p class="article-leader">ROME -- Italy's unadjusted index of industrial production
fell 3.6% in June from a year earlier, the State Statistical
Institute Istat said.
   Istat said the index (1985 equals 100) registered 125.2 in
June, compared with 129.9 in June 1989.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The drop was partly due to fewer working days in June of
this year. The index was based on 21 working days; while June
1989 counted 22 working days.</p>
<p>The drop, which followed a year-on-year rise of 0.7% in
May, confirms a downard trend in economic activity in recent
months. Taking into account the difference in number of
working days, the average daily industrial production edged
up 0.1%, Istat said.</p>
