	<p class="article-leader">PHILADELPHIA -- SmithKline Beecham Corp. said a federal
judge here gave preliminary approval to a proposed $22
million settlement of a class-action suit brought by
shareholders in 1988.
   The company, which denied any liability or law violation,
said the proposed settlement approved by Judge Robert
Gawthrop III is subject to final court approval at an Oct. 3
hearing. SmithKline said it was settling to "eliminate the
burden and expense of litigation." The shareholders alleged
that SmithKline officials delayed disclosure of
pharmaceutical sales trends that would have hurt the
company's stock price.</p>
