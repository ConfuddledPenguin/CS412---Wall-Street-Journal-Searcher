	<p class="article-leader">LITHUANIA SAID the Kremlin pledged increased gas supplies
to the republic.
   As prospects emerged for a compromise in the six-week
impasse over Lithuania's proclamation of independence,
Vilnius Radio reported that the Soviet Union eased economic
curbs imposed last month by doubling the amount of natural
gas to the republic. But Lithuania's president said the move
"has not happened." Moscow's vow came after Gorbachev and
Landsbergis praised a plan by France and West Germany calling
for the republic to delay implementing its independence
without rescinding the declaration itself.</p>

accept NATO membership for a united Germany if the alliance
made strategic changes.</p>

<p>LEBANESE KIDNAPPERS SAID an American hostage would be
released.</p>
<p>A previously unknown group called the Organization of the
Islamic Dawn announced in Beirut that Frank Herbert Reed, who
has been held since September 1986, would be freed by
tomorrow. The group's statement, which was accompanied by
photographs of the educator, said Reed would carry a message
for the Bush administration. The communique came a week after
pro-Iranian extremists freed American captive Robert Polhill
in Lebanon.</p>
<p>Bush reacted guardedly to the statement about Reed's
possible freedom, saying only "that's wonderful" if the
announcement from Beirut proves true.</p>

<p>The space shuttle Discovery landed at Edwards Air Force
Base in California, touching down on a 15,000-foot runway to
end a flight that included the launch of the Hubble Space
Telescope on a mission to search the universe. NASA
engineers, meanwhile, said the telescope's main antennas were
locked into unuseable positions.</p>

<p>Communist leader Joe Slovo returned to South Africa after
27 years in exile and addressed a crowd of more than 20,000
people near Cape Town. Slovo, the highest-ranking white in
the African National Congress, is to join preparatory talks
this week between Pretoria and the ANC aimed at black-white
power-sharing.</p>

<p>About 2,500 South Korean workers waged hit-and-run battles
with police and shouted anti-government slogans to protest a
raid that crushed a three-day strike at a Hyundai Heavy
Industries shipyard near Ulsan. In Seoul and elsewhere,
students staged rallies against Saturday's raid, and a
dissident labor group called for nationwide strikes.</p>

<p>Bush said the "widespread prevalence of abortion in
America is a tragedy." But the president, speaking by
telephone Saturday to a rally in Washington of about 200,000
anti-abortion activists, didn't mention his once-outspoken
support for a constitutional amendment outlawing the
procedure.</p>
<p>Connecticut's Senate approved a measure Friday
guaranteeing a woman's right to choose abortion. The bill,
which effectively codifies much of the 1973 Roe vs. Wade
decision of the Supreme Court, already has been cleared by
the state's House and is expected to be signed by the
governor.</p>

<p>European Community leaders agreed to seek ways to
politically unify the Common Market, including more joint
decision-making, greater democratic checks and balances, and
a less cumbersome institutional structure. The accord came
during a oneday summit Saturday in Dublin.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Thornburgh withdrew the Justice Department's support for
tough new mandatory sentencing guidelines to punish
corporations convicted of crimes. The attorney general's
action last month followed lobbying of the Bush
administration by major companies claiming the proposed
guidelines were too severe.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Wisconsin's governor signed legislation to temporarily ban
the commercial use and sale of a genetically engineered
hormone that increases milk output by dairy cows. The action
was called a victory by opponents of the hormone, who had
argued that it would cause a milk glut and lower prices.</p>

<p>Israel's army strengthened forces in the occupied West
Bank and imposed a curfew in the Gaza Strip as the nation
mourned its war dead and prepared for today's 42nd
anniversary of its independence. In Rome, Pope John Paul II
expressed concern about tensions in Jerusalem that prompted
Friday's closure of Christian holy sites.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Thousands of Romanians demanded the resignation of interim
President Iliescu in what was viewed as one of the largest
antiCommunist demonstrations in Timisoara since December's
revolution. In Bucharest, as many as 10,000 people rallied,
accusing the government of harboring former Communist
officials from Ceausescu's regime.</p>
