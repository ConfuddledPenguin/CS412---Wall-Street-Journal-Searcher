	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The economy appears to have rebounded mildly
from its weakness of late last year, the government's initial
reading of first-quarter economic growth indicates.
   The economy grew at a 2.1% annual rate in the first
quarter, the Commerce Department reported Friday. That is a
slow but healthy pace, by most economists' standards. More
important to many, it is nearly twice the fourth quarter's
feeble 1.1% rate.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The department's chief economist, Anthony Villamil, said
the new numbers point to "a modest pickup in the economy."</p>
<p>"The economy appears to be pulling out of a slump," agreed
Donald Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch & Co. in
New York. "But pockets of weakness still exist."</p>
<p>Inflation is still a nagging problem. An index measuring
the change in the prices of a fixed array of goods and
services soared at a 6.5% annual rate in the first quarter,
the sharpest rise in prices since the fourth quarter of 1981,
when inflation was subsiding after running at double-digit
rates. In the fourth quarter, the index, known as the
fixed-weight index, grew at a 3.6% annual rate.</p>
<p>Another inflation measure, known as the implicit price
deflator, rose at a 5.7% annual rate in the first quarter,
compared with a 3.2% jump in the fourth quarter. Economists
generally view the deflator as a less precise indicator of
inflation than the fixed-weight index, because the mix of
goods and services the deflator gauges changes with the mix
of goods and services the economy produces each quarter.</p>
<p>The numbers were contained in a report on the nation's
real gross national product, the inflation-adjusted value of
the nation's output of goods and services. The calculations
were based on highly incomplete data; Commerce Department
economists will revise the figures twice in the next two
months, after more information comes in.</p>
<p>Despite the improvement over the fourth quarter, the
first-quarter growth rate was lower than many economists
anticipated. Most analysts expect the Federal Reserve to keep
its credit policy on hold after seeing the new numbers, but
some said the inflation figures could prompt the central bank
to consider tightening credit for the first time in more than
a year. The Fed in recent months has been holding interest
rates steady in an effort to prevent a flareup of inflation,
while still avoiding a recession.</p>
<p>As the year plays out, inflation will almost certainly
slow from its sharp first-quarter pace, economists believe.
Half the first-quarter acceleration came in food and energy
prices. Frigid temperatures clenched much of the country in
late December, destroying crops and sending energy use
surging; as a result of depleted supplies in both areas,
prices jumped.</p>
<p>But food and energy prices are moderating now. "Inflation
is going to come off" its current pace, predicted James
Annable, chief economist at First National Bank of Chicago.</p>
<p>Some economists wonder whether the first quarter's pace of
economic growth can be sustained, though most believe the
economy is safe from recession for now. Kenneth T. Mayland,
chief economist at Society National Bank in Cleveland,
predicted that the economy is likely to continue for a while
at "something around this pace, give or take a half a percent
or so."</p>
<p>Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the
nation's economic activity, picked up considerably in the
first quarter, growing $16.4 billion, compared with a $3.6
billion rise in the fourth quarter, according to the report.
A January jump in car buying fueled the increase, as
consumers took advantage of big discounts offered by auto
makers and dealers in an effort to clear inventories. But car
buying has fallen off in subsequent months, and analysts
predict it will continue to be weak for some time.</p>
<p>The nation's trade imbalance also improved in the first
quarter, with exports increasing and imports decreasing.
Business investment picked up, after dropping in the fourth
quarter.</p>
<p>Business inventories also grew slightly, despite a massive
sell-off of auto inventories. While inventories contribute to
GNP growth, a sharp buildup in inventories at a time of slow
economic activity can lead to production cutbacks and
layoffs. In the fourth quarter, inventories grew $22.2
billion, but they rose only $2.6 billion in the first
quarter.</p>
<p>Many economists believe that the weather propped up
economic growth in the first three months of this year. The
coldest December on record was followed by unseasonably warm
temperatures through much of January and February, leading
builders to start construction projects earlier, for example.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the fourth quarter's growth had been
anemic, partly as a result of some special factors. Employees
at Boeing Co., one of the nation's largest aircraft
producers, were on strike. The California earthquake also
hurt growth.</p>
<p>"If you average the first quarter with the fourth quarter,
it's a little bit closer measure of what the economy is
doing," Mr. Annable, the Chicago banker, said. "Basically,
what we had was an awful lot of offsetting of special
factors."</p>

<p>               GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT</p>
<p>Here are some of the major components of the gross
national product expressed in seasonally adjusted annual
rates in billions of constant (1982) dollars:</p>
<p>                              1st Qtr.     4th Qtr.</p>

<p>GNP .......................... 4195.8      4174.1</p>
<p>  less: inventory chng .......    2.6        22.2</p>
<p>  equals: final sales ........ 4193.2      4151.9</p>

<p>  Gov't Purchases ............  816.1       810.4</p>
<p>In the first quarter, the implicit price deflator rose to
5.7% of the 1982 average, from 3.2% in the previous quarter.</p>
