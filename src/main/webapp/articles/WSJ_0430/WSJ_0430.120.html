	<p class="article-leader">Thrift regulators and Congress should be wary of further
erosions of the earnings of the Federal Home Loan Banks,
according to separate warnings from the president of the
Dallas bank and thrift analysts at Salomon Brothers Inc.
   "A further drop in the (banks') dividend yield and, in
turn, the value of (bank) stock could have horrendous
implications for the savings institutions we cover," Salomon
Brothers analysts Bruce Harting and Susan Silverstein said in
a report.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Thrifts, which own stock in the 12 regional banks equal to
at least 1% of their mortgages outstanding, count the
holdings as part of the tangible net worth they must maintain
to stave off regulatory actions. As dividend yields have
fallen, many of the thrifts have been reducing their holdings
in the Federal Home Loan Banks.</p>
<p>Part of the decline in dividend yields is caused by a
ceiling imposed by the banks' regulatory board. The ceiling
is roughly one percentage point above the federal funds rate,
placing the current dividend yields between 8.2% and 8.5%.
The funds rate is what banks charge each other on overnight
loans.</p>
<p>But yields are also suffering from provisions of the
federal thrift-bailout legislation that took effect in
August. Among those provisions is a requirement that the
Federal Home Loan Banks contribute $300 million annually,
regardless of earnings, to pay for the cost of failed
thrifts.</p>
<p>In addition, the banks are watching their major source of
revenue -- loans, or advances, to member thrifts -- dry up as
thrifts cut borrowings in an effort to shrink to meet the
law's stringent capital standards. The decrease in borrowings
is also helping push down dividend yields.</p>
<p>"As this bank shrinks, it is going to be more and more
difficult to pay reasonable dividends," said George Barclay,
president of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas. For the
first time, the Dallas bank will tap a reserve fund to keep
its dividend yield at about 8.5% for the second quarter, he
said.</p>
<p>Mr. Barclay said the Dallas bank has fed the reserve by
deliberately keeping dividends low during the past several
quarters to counteract the loss of revenue as borrowings by
member thrifts decline. Advances from the Federal Home Loan
Bank of Dallas fell from a peak of $27.5 billion in June 1989
to the current level of about $19 billion, Mr. Barclay said.</p>
<p>Other more-profitable banks, such as the one in San
Francisco, had been paying member thrifts substantially
higher dividend yields than the Dallas bank. But that has
ended. The San Francisco bank dropped its yield from about
12% in early 1989 to the current rate of about 8.5%.</p>
<p>"The real concern about this is that net worth be
preserved," said Ray Martin, chairman and chief executive
officer of Coast Savings Financial Inc., parent of Coast
Savings & Loan Association of Los Angeles. Coast Savings is a
shareholder of the San Francisco Federal Home Loan Bank.</p>
<p>Mr. Martin said Coast has reduced the amount of its
holdings in the San Francisco bank by about $240 million to
about $100 million. Those holdings represent about 49% of
Coast's tangible net worth, according to the Salomon Brothers
report.</p>
<p>Coast isn't concerned as long as Congress and the
regulators don't do anything to erode the earnings of the
Federal Home Loan Banks further, Mr. Martin said.</p>
