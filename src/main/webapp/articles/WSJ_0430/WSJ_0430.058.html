	<p class="article-leader">Spare me from the federal government giving a seal of
approval to healthy foods ("AHA to Drop Seal Endorsing Low
Fat Foods," April 2). If I can't trust the Heart Association
to evaluate foods in good faith, I certainly don't trust the
FDA to do it. Why do people expect the government to do
everything for them? I suspect what some are really looking
for is someone or some seal to say junk food is good for you
after all.
   Guess maybe we'll have to read labels and exercise a
little common sense after all. Darn it.</p>
