	<p class="article-leader">Emboldened by a new weapon in its regulatory arsenal, the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. scuttled its planned, $366
million bailout of National Bancshares Corp. of Texas rather
than bow to bondholders' demands that it sweeten a debt-swap
offer.
   The unexpected move -- which, according to one analyst,
turned on a mere $6 million gap between the two sides --
undid nine months of work by Equimark Corp., the Pittsburgh
bank holding company which had planned to acquire National
Bancshares for $116 million. And it reopened for sale
National Bancshares' rich Texas banking franchise.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I'm very unhappy about not getting this deal, very
unhappy," said Alan S. Fellheimer, Equimark's chairman, who
said he, unlike the FDIC, was willing to accede to
bondholders' demands that they be paid more.</p>
<p>"The FDIC has more power now," he added, "and it's itching
to send a message to the arbs: Don't mess with the FDIC."</p>
<p>The FDIC's new muscle derives from the 1989 thrift bailout
law, which authorizes the agency to seize assets of solvent
subsidiaries of a financial institution to help defray the
costs of rescuing insolvent units -- a tactic which, if
upheld by the courts, would deprive holding company creditors
of assets which they might otherwise sell to recoup their
loans.</p>
<p>Analysts say they expect National Bancshares to provide
the first major proving ground for the weapon: The FDIC has
repeatedly threatened the company's bondholders that it would
use the so-called "cross guarantee" provisions if at least
85% of the company's $25 million in outstanding debentures
weren't tendered -- at a 70% discount to face value -- by the
April 26 deadline set forth in the recapitalization plan.</p>
<p>On Friday, National Bancshares announced that only 22% of
the debentures were tendered, and added that it won't extend
the offer. Shareholders, on the other hand, approved the plan
by more than two-to-one, the company said.</p>
<p>Alan Whitney, an FDIC spokesman, declined to say what the
agency's next move will be, other than to say that it and
other regulatory agencies "are proceeding immediately to
consider alternative resolutions to the NBC situation,
including contacting qualified prospective acquirers."</p>
<p>Jay Lustig, an analyst at Drake Capital Securities Inc.,
Santa Monica, Calif., blasted the FDIC for failing to
complete the planned deal with Equimark, calling the agency
"inflexible." Mr. Lustig contended that, had the FDIC agreed
to a proposal by creditors to swap the current debentures for
securities worth 60 cents on the dollar of original debt, the
total cost of the recapitalization would only have risen by
$6 million.</p>
<p>Frank Anderson, an analyst with Stephens Inc., Little
Rock, Ark., agreed that the amounts of money involved are
small, and speculated that the FDIC was mainly interested in
sending a signal to bondholders. "I don't think the money has
anything to do with it," he said. "I think the FDIC just
doesn't want to look like a patsy or a pushover in the
future."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some in the industry speculated that the
recapitalization failure owed as much to Equimark's problems
at home as it did to recalcitrant bondholders. Buffetted by
the weak commercial real estate market, Equimark lost $15.4
million in the first quarter. And the company's weak stock
price scuttled a planned stock offering, meaning the company
had to resort to such measures as selling its credit card
business to help raise the $116 million.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
Friday, Equimark's stock closed at $8.125, down 25 cents.</p>
