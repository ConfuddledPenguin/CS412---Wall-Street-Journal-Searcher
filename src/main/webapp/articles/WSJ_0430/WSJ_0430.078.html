	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- From his lofty Sears Tower office, which
associates call "The Dream Factory," William F. Farley laid
plans that made him a rich industrialist. But that wasn't
enough. He wanted to be famous too.
   So the chairman and principal owner of Fruit of the Loom
Inc. hired one of Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen's speechwriters
and made the aide vice chairman of the holding company Farley
Inc. Mr. Farley ran a series of national television ads that
featured his views on American competitiveness -- and never
mentioned his company's products.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>He considered running as a Democrat for president in 1988,
but modestly decided that the timing wasn't right since he
was only 44 years old. He took to the airwaves again, with
ads portraying a trim and sweaty Mr. Farley pumping iron in a
Fruit of the Loom T-shirt and sweat pants. And then he
decided to make another acquisition, one with well-known
consumer products that, according to former aides, would be
easily recognized by voters and would boost Farley's annual
revenue to an impressive-sounding $5 billion. Mr. Farley
early last year acquired West Point-Pepperell Inc., the maker
of Martex sheets and Lady Pepperell blankets.</p>
<p>Since then, Mr. Farley has had little time for politicking
or image burnishing: He is locked in the financial fight of
his life, and he could end up losing everything.</p>
<p>The $2.5 billion West Point takeover now appears to be on
the verge of collapse. Last month, Mr. Farley defaulted on
$1.5 billion in debt and then offered to relinquish a
majority stake in West Point if bondholders would agree to
lower interest rates and deferred payments.</p>
<p>But now even that plan may fail. In recent days, people
familiar with the talks say, Mr. Farley's creditors have
privately rejected his offer. Negotiations are continuing,
but the outlook for a favorable ending appears grim. "We're
beginning to think we may get a better deal from a bankruptcy
judge," says a Kidder Peabody & Co. official hired to advise
the bondholders.</p>
<p>A bankruptcy-law filing is a distinct possibility. Mr.
Farley's chief lenders, Wells Fargo & Co. and Bankers Trust
Co., could force him into bankruptcy court at any time
because he failed to repay a $796 million short-term loan,
due March 31. But so far, they have been awaiting the outcome
of the bondholder negotiations -- which could free up cash
needed to pay the banks.</p>
<p>If he does end up in bankruptcy court, Mr. Farley's empire
could be ruined. While he certainly would lose control of
West Point Acquisition Corp., the company he set up to buy
the Georgia textile concern, other Farley enterprises could
be jeopardized as well. Farley Inc., Mr. Farley's 77%-owned
holding company, whose units make Acme Boots and metal parts
for industry, now has twice as much debt on its books as
assets; it posted a pretax loss of about $40 million in 1989.
Creditors might also seek to go after his controlling stake
in Fruit of the Loom.</p>
<p>Mr. Farley declined to be interviewed for this story. His
vice chairman, Jack Albertine, the onetime lobbyist and
Bentsen speechwriter, quietly resigned two weeks ago. "Bill
doesn't need a public policy person anymore," Mr. Albertine
says.</p>
<p>There's always a chance that Mr. Farley will find a way to
save the West Point transaction and keep his dreams alive.
More than once, he has emerged from last-ditch negotiations
with a cocky smile and a transaction safely closed.</p>
<p>In 1977, when a Farley-owned paper-folding machine plant
in Sidney, Ohio, was near bankruptcy, he left his family
behind in Chicago and moved to an apartment near the plant.
For a year, he personally managed the factory while pleading
with his bankers for leniency. Eventually, the plant posted a
profit and was saved.</p>
<p>"He has a flair for last-minute heroics," says Paul Shaum,
vice president of corporate bond research at Salomon Brothers
Inc. "The only question is: Has he gone too far this time?"</p>
<p>A former encyclopedia salesman and son of a Pawtucket,
R.I., postman, Mr. Farley graduated from Boston College Law
School and went on to an investment-banking career at Lehman
Brothers Kuhn Loeb, which he left to become his own
dealmaker, assembling a $4 billion empire -- largely with
other people's money -- in just 14 years.</p>
<p>"Bill is incredibly good at phoning bankers and making
them feel he's doing them a favor {while they are} lending
him millions of dollars," says an associate.</p>
<p>Along the way, Mr. Farley acquired a taste for the good
life, hiring a valet to accompany him everywhere and even to
accept his hotel room-service deliveries. He also made plans
to commission a 120-foot yacht. Those plans, like his
political career, are now on hold.</p>
<p>Mr. Farley's first deal involved a citrus-processing plant
in Anaheim, Calif. The owner, NL Industries Inc., was asking
$1.7 million, with a cash down payment of $200,000. Mr.
Farley had a mere $25,000, but he persuaded NL to ignore
other bids for six months while he borrowed the rest of his
"equity" from four other lenders. The plant was his
collateral for the rest of the loan and a subsequent one to
remodel the place.</p>
<p>The experience taught Mr. Farley that the leveraged
buy-out could be a way to mint money. In the early 1980s,
long before junk bonds put a pin-striped gloss on going into
hock, Mr. Farley parlayed promissory notes into a dozen
plants making such unglamorous items as screws and pinsetters
for bowling alleys.</p>
<p>Aligning himself with the emerging junk-bond specialists
at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in 1985, he made his first $1
billion acquisition -- Northwest Industries Inc., a maker of
aerospace, defense and chemical products. Shortly afterward,
his personal fortune was estimated at $50 million, including
his 24% stake in Fruit of the Loom, which he spun off from
Northwest. He bought houses on the ski slopes at Snowmass,
Colo., and on the shore in Kennebunkport, Maine, near the
retreat of President Bush. Mr. Farley sometimes brags that
his twin-engine Magnum powerboat is so fast the U.S. Secret
Service bans it -- for security reasons -- when the president
is angling in nearby waters.</p>
<p>With Northwest under his belt, Mr. Farley began to feel
the lure of politics because, as one close friend quotes him
as saying, "I have done everything else."</p>
<p>In 1986, he hired Mr. Albertine, who encouraged the
Chicago industrialist's presidential ambitions and told him
he needed a veteran of Washington political circles to
promote his name and to coach him on national issues.</p>
<p>Mr. Albertine crafted a $2.5 million series of unusual
television ads that ran on the networks and featured Mr.
Farley in various sporting locales, such as a football locker
room, extolling the work-ethic virtues of teamwork and good
management. "Just imagine being a diver for a coach who
pushes you to do lots of dives as fast as you can, instead of
going for that one perfect dive," says Mr. Farley, standing
by a swimming pool. "Is putting quantity before quality any
way to win?"</p>
<p>In 1987, Mr. Farley made about a dozen personal
appearances in Iowa, site of the first primary caucuses, at
which he promised -- despite his own borrowing binge -- to
reduce the federal deficit if elected president. But then he
abruptly withdrew from the race, saying he wasn't yet ready
for a national campaign.</p>
<p>While Mr. Farley was toying with politics, he made the
business decision that may prove to be his undoing. In early
1988, he began planning his next acquisition with Drexel
officials, who helped him raise a $500 million war chest
through the sale of junk bonds.</p>
<p>He yearned to make a run for Pillsbury Co., but it was too
expensive. West Point-Pepperell did fit Mr. Farley's profile,
and the fourth-generation Lanier family management appeared
vulnerable to an aggressive, hostile takeover attempt.</p>
<p>As expected, West Point-Pepperell's board at first
rejected Mr. Farley's offer in October 1988 to pay $48 a
share, or $1.3 billion, while also assuming $1 billion in
West Point debt. West Point lawyers lobbied state legislators
for anti-takeover legislation, employees burned Fruit of the
Loom underwear in demonstrations and Joseph Lanier Jr., the
chairman, vowed to fight Mr. Farley "until hell freezes over,
and then we'll fight him on the ice."</p>
<p>Mr. Farley rushed to Georgia, believing he could convince
Mr. Lanier of his good intentions for West Point-Pepperell.
But Mr. Lanier avoided him. Mr. Farley finally caught up with
him in the restroom of an attorney's office.</p>
<p>"I'm delighted to meet you," Mr. Lanier recalls Mr. Farley
saying.</p>
<p>"I wish I could say the same," replied Mr. Lanier, who
brushed past his visitor, ending the meeting.</p>
<p>After West Point-Pepperell put itself up for auction in an
attempt to escape his clutches, Mr. Farley surprised some
Drexel officials by raising his bid, in stages, a full $10 a
share, to $58, despite the fact that no other bidder ever
stepped forth publicly. Former Drexel officials say the
now-defunct investment concern warned that he was probably
overbidding by at least $200 million. Mr. Farley, however,
was adamant about the higher bid, people familiar with the
transaction say. He won control of the company in a tender
offer, but he had purchased only 95% of the shares when he
ran out of money.</p>
<p>Mr. Farley had expected to complete the purchase of West
Point by floating other bonds through Drexel or by borrowing
cash from Drexel if necessary. But the collapse of the
junk-bond market, followed by Drexel's bankruptcy filing,
eliminated those options. Meanwhile, Mr. Farley's ability to
pay off West Point's debt was diminished by the poor price he
got for the company's Cluett, Peabody & Co. unit, which
makes, among other products, Arrow shirts. He ultimately
realized only $350 million in cash plus a $60 million note
from the buyer -- far below his asking price.</p>
<p>Mr. Farley couldn't use the Cluett proceeds directly
because of arrangements he had with certain lenders. Thus Mr.
Farley couldn't scrape up the $83 million he needed to buy
the remaining 5% of West Point's common stock. Without 100%
ownership, he couldn't use the Cluett proceeds to help repay
the $796 million short-term loans from Wells Fargo and
Bankers Trust.</p>
<p>Instead of demanding immediate repayment, however, the
banks agreed to wait for Mr. Farley to try to negotiate a new
deal with the holders of the junk bonds he issued to finance
the lion's share of the transaction.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, Mr. Farley offered the junk-bond holders a
65% equity stake in West Point -- equal to about $1.1 billion
based on the tender offer price of $58 a share -- in return
for substantially lower interest rates and substantially
delayed debt payments. People familiar with the talks say,
however, that the noteholders want at least a 75% stake and
much higher interest rates than Mr. Farley is offering. They
may oppose to Mr. Farley's plan to retain control of West
Point's board.</p>
<p>Mr. Farley could conceivably sell his $120 million
personal stake in Fruit of the Loom and use that to complete
the West Point deal, but he has been reluctant to do that.</p>
<p>Privately, people close to him say he is admitting his
takeover win has turned into a financial defeat, and he
merely wants to recover the $220 million he personally put
into the West Point deal, particularly since most of that was
money he borrowed and must repay over roughly the next
decade.</p>
<p>His repayment record is already suspect in the town of
West Point, Ga., where he borrowed $40 from Mayor H.E. Steele
to buy a pair of jogging shoes that caught his eye in March
1989, while on a downtown good-will tour.</p>
<p>It wasn't until this month that Mr. Farley finally sent
the mayor a check. "Don't know whether to frame it or cash
it," says Mr. Steele.</p>
