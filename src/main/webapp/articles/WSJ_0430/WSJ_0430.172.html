	<p class="article-leader">George Melloan's April 2 Global View "Who Will Pay the
Bill for Russia's Decline?" was truly outstanding. Mr.
Melloan should be commended for clearly and concisely
portraying the capital demands that exist today. As a
financial consultant with a global view of investing, I keep
asking how all the capital needs that these new-found
democracies require will be met.
   So far, the only answer is probably higher interest rates
and greater market uncertainty. To answer the question of who
will pay the bill: We all will.</p>
