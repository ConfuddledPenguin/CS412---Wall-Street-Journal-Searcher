	<p class="article-leader">Cirrus Logic Inc., a fast-growing semiconductor start-up
concern, expects to report net income more than doubled in
its fiscal fourth quarter, adding to a series of improved
results from computer chip companies.
   Cirrus expects today to report net of $5 million to $5.5
million, or 33 cents to 34 cents a share, for the fourth
quarter ended March 31, compared with the year-earlier $1.9
million, or 15 cents a share, said Michael Hackworth,
Cirrus's president and chief executive officer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Milpitas, Calif., chip company was expected by
analysts to report net of 30 cents to 31 cents a share for
the quarter, Mr. Hackworth said.</p>
<p>Mr. Hackworth attributed the favorable results to growing
strength in chip demand among office-automation equipment
makers that are Cirrus's main customers. Cirrus expects to
post fourth-quarter sales in the range of $27.5 million to
$28.5 million, compared with $12.1 million in the
year-earlier quarter, Mr. Hackworth said.</p>
<p>"The overall office-automation market was stronger than we
had anticipated," he said. "Last year everyone was walking on
eggs about 1990. We're feeling much more bullish about the
market than we did five months ago."</p>
<p>For the year ended March 31, Cirrus expects to post net of
$15 million to $15.5 million, or $1.02 to $1.03 a share,
compared with $4 million, or 32 cents a share, last year.
Cirrus expects to report revenue in the year of $84 million
to $85 million, up from $27.5 million to $28.5 million a year
earlier, he said. Cirrus had about $40 million in cash and
equivalents at the quarter's end, he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Hackworth attributed the earnings to
better-than-expected sales of its new chips used in
laptop-computer screens and in computer disk drives. Cirrus's
improved profits are a welcome boost for the five-year-old
company, which went public last June.</p>
<p>And Cirrus's earnings boost comes after several big chip
makers -- including Intel Corp., LSI Logic Corp. and Cypress
Semiconductor Corp. -- announced better-than-expected
quarters. The industry's leading indicator, the so-called
book-to-bill ratio, is at its highest level since July 1988.</p>
<p>Cirrus's orders in the fourth quarter were strong and
presage a strong first quarter, Mr. Hackworth said. He said
he was comfortable with analysts' estimates that the company
would have net of about $4 million, or 24 cents a share, in
the quarter ended June 30, compared with net of $2.5 million,
or 14 cents a share, a year earlier. Cirrus is comfortable
with revenue estimates for the quarter of $29 million to $30
million, up from $14.8 million last year, he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Hackworth said the company plans to add 10 to 20 new
chips to its lineup, which now includes about 40 chips.</p>
