	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- In the game show, as in life, the West Coast
computer nerds beat the East -- following a close contest
that was decided in a sudden-death finish.
   The storied rivalry between Silicon Valley's laid-back
computer wizards and the buttoned-down businessmen of
Boston's flagging Route 128 region was reflected Friday in
the second annual Computer Bowl. The Boston Computer Museum
benefit, modeled after the College Bowl game show, featured
an all-star cast including William H. Gates, reformed hacker
and billionaire chairman of Microsoft Corp., and Mitchell
Kapor, trivia whiz and founder of Lotus Development Corp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The East Coast team, captained by Patrick J. McGovern,
chairman of International Data Corp., maintained a slim lead
through much of the contest, fielding the most obscure
computer-trivia questions. Bob Frankston, co-developer of the
first electronic spreadsheet and chief scientist at Lotus,
was the East's Most Valuable Player.</p>
<p>The rapid-fire questions ranged from real softballs
(E-PROM, as any nerd knows, is an erasable-programmable
read-only memory) to the truly arcane (Q: What's the ASCII
equivalent for the `escape' key? A: 27). Mr. Frankston, clad
in the dark business suit that was the uniform of the East,
knew that one. The West wore shirt-sleeves.</p>
<p>The West's big gun, Mr. Gates, didn't turn out to be much
of a factor, though he delivered in a couple of clutch
situations. He was hot in a warm-up round before the Bowl --
to be broadcast nationwide on PBS's Computer Chronicles in
May -- but the East took the preliminary. There was some
speculation that the warm-up loss was a set-up by the wily
Mr. Gates, and someone from Microsoft was indeed seen taking
bets.</p>
<p>It was a bitter defeat for the East. It's bad enough that
the momentum in the industry has shifted to the West and
smaller, more nimble machines, leaving Eastern firms
bleeding. This was personal.</p>
<p>After trailing most of the game, the West seized the lead
in the fourth quarter. The East tied the score in the final
seconds, but the West won at the buzzer. The coveted silver
Computer Bowl was handed over to the Californians. "The
defeat of unknown nerds from failing East Coast companies was
inevitable," said West Coast captain and venture capitalist
L. John Doerr, who couldn't resist rubbing it in.</p>
