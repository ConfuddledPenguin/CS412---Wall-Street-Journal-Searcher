	<p class="article-leader">The federal government's war on drugs is snaring thousands
of innocent pleasure boaters. But often they can't do much
more than complain.
   Coast Guard and Customs Service officials say the
boardings and searches are a small price to pay in the war
against drugs. But many boaters say boarding parties often
behave like storm troopers and leave owners with whopping
repair bills that they must pay largely by themselves.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"These intrusions on the boating public are beginning to
take their toll," says Michael Sciulla, a spokesman for the
350,000-member Boat Owners Association of the U.S. "Some
innocent citizens now face thousands of dollars of damage to
their property. Others, who live on their boats, no longer
feel safe from the government in their own homes."</p>
<p>Unlike homeowners and car drivers, boaters enjoy little
protection under the Fourth Amendment's search and seizure
doctrine. The Coast Guard can board and search any vessel,
whether docked or at sea, to check its compliance with safety
rules. The Customs Service has similar latitude to check for
contraband when a vessel comes from a foreign port. Both
agencies need nothing more than a reasonable suspicion -- a
commander's judgment that something is amiss -- to search for
drugs.</p>
<p>The searches can last for hours. A boat may even be
detained overnight in dry dock while inspectors search it
with drug-sniffing dogs, drills, saws and crowbars.</p>
<p>Holding either agency accountable for damages is tricky.
The Customs Service can be held liable for no more than
$1,000 under federal tort law. The Coast Guard's liability
isn't limited, but the agency determines what it will pay
boaters; people who are unhappy with its judgment can sue.</p>
<p>Law enforcement agencies say they have little choice but
to continue the searches. "Law enforcement isn't easy, and
we're as concerned as anyone about doing the job in a
professional, unobtrusive manner," says Rear Adm. W.T.
Leland, chief of law enforcement for the Coast Guard. "The
problem is that some boaters and yachtsmen have smuggled
drugs and will continue to do so for as long as the
attraction lasts."</p>
<p>Both agencies maintain that the searches pay off. The
Coast Guard seized 37,000 pounds of marijuana and 8,000
pounds of cocaine from pleasure boats last year. Customs
seized 20,972 pounds of cocaine and 58,185 pounds of
marijuana in 1989 from pleasure boats in the Gulf Coast and
Florida area.</p>
<p>Both agencies also say they are trying to be less
intrusive on pleasure boaters. Coast Guard boardings of all
kinds of boats fell 29% to 50,000 in the fiscal year ended
last September from two years earlier. Customs Service
boardings of noncommercial vessels in the Atlantic Ocean near
Florida, the Gulf Coast and the Caribbean fell by one-quarter
last year to 3,710 from 1987.</p>
<p>But the widespread searches have overwhelmed free-spirited
pleasure boaters, particularly those cruising the Gulf
Coast-Florida area. Those waters long have been considered a
pleasure boater's semitropical paradise, where the Coast
Guard was perceived as a lifesaver and unobtrusive safety
inspector. Contact with Customs was rare. But boat owners see
their paradise slipping away.</p>
<p>Craig Klein, a University of North Florida journalism
professor, says his newly purchased secondhand sailboat was
impounded and damaged by Customs before he even sailed it. As
a hired crew was transporting it last spring to Jacksonville,
Fla., from St. Petersburg, Customs agents became suspicious
because two characters in its state registration number were
hard to read. When the agents boarded, the hired crew was
vague about who had hired them. The agents found a gun, and
the original copies of ownership documents weren't aboard as
required.</p>
<p>Customs took the boat to dry dock, where inspectors
discovered recent repairs to the hull. They removed wood and
fiberglass panels and drilled holes into the boat, but found
no drugs. The agency estimated the damage to the boat at no
more than $1,000. But Customs also told Mr. Klein that it
wouldn't pay him anything because the search was reasonable
under the circumstances.</p>
<p>Mr. Klein, who says his $17,000 boat sustained $4,000 of
damage, has no realistic recourse because of the $1,000 limit
on the Customs Service's liability. "I feel violated," he
says. "My government has greatly disappointed me."</p>
<p>Brooks Thomas, a Customs Service lawyer, declines to
comment on the Klein case. But he says the rule of thumb is
that "Customs is not liable for damage it causes in a
detention situation."</p>
<p>Elaine Dickinson, a spokeswoman for the boat owners group,
says recreational boaters tend to have more problems with
Customs than the Coast Guard because Customs personnel aren't
as familiar with boat construction. But the Coast Guard,
which had 20 claims filed against it last year by boaters,
also makes mistakes.</p>
<p>In February 1989, a 46-foot-long boat owned by Robert and
Kay Weeks Jr., of Charleston, S.C., was boarded by the Coast
Guard 17 miles off the Florida coast and taken into custody
at Port Everglades. The agents used chain saws and drills to
rip into the floorings and furnishings and left
16-inch-square holes in the deck.</p>
<p>The Coast Guard told the couple how much it would pay to
repair the boat. (It hasn't made the figure public.) Lt.
Cmdr. James Simpson says that as a matter of policy, the
Coast Guard feels compelled to pay for the damages it causes
to innocent boaters. "It's sort of an outgrowth of our search
and safety mission," he says. "Why should an innocent boater
bear the cost of damages when we chop up his boat?"</p>
<p>But the Weeks, who say their boat sustained more than
$400,000 in damage, say the Coast Guard proposal was
inadequate. They filed suit last September in federal court
in Charleston.</p>
<p>Neither agency is unresponsive to boaters' protests. When
the Boat Owners Association brought the Weekses' story and
others to the attention of a congressional subcommittee on
the Coast Guard last year, the agency changed its rules on
boarding and searching. The Coast Guard agreed that all
agents would keep their sidearms holstered when boarding a
boat and said it would develop a computerized system to
protect against repeated boardings, a subject of complaint by
some boaters.</p>
<p>Also, Customs and the Coast Guard both say their personnel
will now issue summonses only when they find quantities of
drugs clearly indicating trafficking rather than personal
use. That marks the end of the so-called zero tolerance
policy, under which boats would be seized if any illegal
drugs were found, no matter how small a quantity.</p>
