	<p class="article-leader">Cineplex Odeon Corp. said it agreed to sell the bulk of
its Virginia theaters to SKS Enterprises Inc. for $18
million, the first of what are expected to be several asset
sales over the coming months.
   The troubled movie theater chain said $17 million of the
proceeds will be used to reduce its bank debt, which at last
report totaled about $620 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Cineplex will get the remaining $1 million in SKS
preferred shares, it said.</p>
<p>The assets being sold include 80 screens in 18 locations.
Cineplex said it will retain its theaters in the Washington,
D.C., area and nearby Virginia communities.</p>
<p>Cineplex has promised its bankers to raise $200 million
this year from asset sales to apply against debt.</p>
<p>The company said the agreement is subject to post-closing
adjustments, which it said aren't expected to be material.
The sale is expected to close May 25, Cineplex said.</p>
