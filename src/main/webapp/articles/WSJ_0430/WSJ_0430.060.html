	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The giant bookstore chains get a lot of grief
about selling books like junk food, filling up the windows
with Stephen King and Danielle Steel.
   But the B. Dalton chain has a new program designed to get
shoppers to buy more of such books as "Skywater" by Melinda
Worth Popham, a serious novel written from the point of view
of a pack of coyotes. A book like this -- without sex, drugs
or detectives, written by an unknown author and published by
a tiny, independent press -- doesn't normally have a chance
to attract wide readership. Obscure novelists who sell 5,000
copies consider themselves lucky.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Starting tomorrow, browsers at more than 250 of the 800 B.
Dalton stores across the country will find "Skywater"
displayed in a special section and recommended in a brochure
along with 28 other novels by unknown or little-known
authors. "Discover Great New Writers" is the name of the
program, and new selections will be made and promoted every
two months. Half a dozen of the titles will be chosen by the
local store manager, with the rest of the books picked by the
chain's buyers in New York, after reviewing publishers'
recommendations.</p>
<p>"We're certainly conscious of our image in the
marketplace," says Leonard Riggio, chief executive officer
and principal owner of B. Dalton. "We do a great job with the
cookbooks and the how-tos and the big-name authors, but we
know there is frustration on the part of authors that don't
sell. We're going to give them a shot, to express gratitude
and maybe to help discover the future's best sellers. These
shopping-center stores sell to a middle-American client and
we're trying to broaden their reading."</p>
<p>As the chains, particularly B. Dalton and Waldenbooks,
expanded rapidly through the '80s until they came to
represent some 30% of U.S. sales, publishers observed the
stores' power to make a book a best seller. Dire predictions
were uttered in publishing circles about the imminent
disappearance of serious books. Then, several years ago, a
series of very demanding fiction and non-fiction books became
surprise best sellers without the chains paying much
attention.</p>
<p>It turned out that the recommendation of passionate,
book-loving, independent-bookstore owners across the country
had been the spark, and then the chains chimed in. One
example: "The Joy Luck Club," a first novel by unknown Amy
Tan, has sold more than 270,000 copies in hardcover since
March 1989.</p>
<p>"The chains like B. Dalton are trying to pick up on what
has made some independents so successful," says Scott Walker,
founder and editorial director of Graywolf Press, which
published "Skywater," the coyote novel. "The chains are
starting to have a broader selection of titles and doing
things like more author signings and readings."</p>
<p>For a small press like Graywolf, the Discover program is a
special blessing. "We don't have a big promotion budget --
almost nobody does for a first novel," says Mr. Walker. "For
some reason the word `literary' scares people, and we have to
start aggressively marketing to new audiences. I think this
program is one way to reach more readers with this type of
book."</p>
<p>St. Paul, Minn.-based Graywolf publishes only about 14
titles a year, and though its promotion budget for "Skywater"
is one of its biggest, it totals just $7,000. Nationwide.</p>
<p>The other titles on B. Dalton's first "Discover" list
aren't all by small presses, though several others are
represented. But even when the book is the product of a
powerhouse publisher or is a murder mystery that might
automatically grab genre readers, its author is a virtual
unknown or first novelist. Some movie fans may know Hanif
Kureishi as the writer of such cult British movies as "My
Beautiful Laundrette," but Mr. Kureishi is hardly a household
name. "The Buddha of Suburbia" is his first novel.</p>
