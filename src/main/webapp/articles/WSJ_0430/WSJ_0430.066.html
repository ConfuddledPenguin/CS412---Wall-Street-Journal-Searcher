	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A Securities and Exchange Commission hearing
officer suspended Blinder, Robinson & Co., once the nation's
largest penny-stock underwriting firm, for 45 days and barred
the firm from underwriting any securities offerings for two
years.
   Administrative law judge Brenda Murray also barred Meyer
Blinder, founder and president of the Denver-based firm, from
associating with any brokerage firm, with the proviso that he
can seek reinstatement as a registered broker after two
years. The unusually harsh sanctions stem from a 1980 casino
stock-underwriting in which the firm and Mr. Blinder were
charged with fraud and manipulative practices.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In issuing her decision Friday, Ms. Murray said that the
evidence in the long-running case "indicates a high
probability that Mr. Blinder cannot ever operate in the
securities industry in compliance with the law."</p>
<p>The decision becomes final within 15 days unless the firm
and Mr. Blinder ask the five-member SEC to review it. Both
were expected to file such petitions.</p>
<p>Attorneys for Mr. Blinder and Blinder Robinson declined to
comment Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>Under the 45-day suspension, Blinder Robinson will still
be able to make unsolicited trades for customers, complete
transactions outstanding, and make deliveries and transfers
of securities.</p>
<p>Ms. Murray rejected the SEC's request for a permanent bar
against Mr. Blinder, opting instead for two years which, she
said, "will give Mr. Blinder an opportunity for
rehabilitation."</p>
<p>The administrative case has been fiercely fought for
years. In 1985, another SEC hearing officer ruled that
Blinder Robinson and Mr. Blinder had violated securities laws
by, among other things, failing to disclose the firm's
purchase of American Leisure Corp. securities to close out a
$25 million underwriting for the Atlantic City company. In
1986, the commission imposed the same sanctions as Ms. Murray
did Friday. Attorneys for Mr. Blinder and the firm appealed
the sanctions to the federal appeals court here in 1987,
arguing that the SEC deals more harshly with newer brokerage
firms than "old-line houses."</p>
<p>In January 1988, a three-judge appellate panel remanded
the case to the SEC for further hearing, saying the hearing
officer should have allowed the introduction of certain
evidence about Mr. Blinder's relationship with his legal
advisers on the casino-stock offering.</p>
<p>Mr. Blinder had consulted with securities lawyers before
he decided against disclosing in the American Leisure
prospectus that Blinder Robinson was buying the last unsold
securities in the "all or none" offering. In such an
underwriting, if all of the securities aren't sold by a
specified date, the investors must be reimbursed.</p>
<p>In her decision, Ms. Murray said that Mr. Blinder had
rejected the lawyers advice to disclose the American Leisure
purchases "because it would have damaged Blinder Robinson's
business reputation," indicating an inability to complete a
deal. "Taken as whole," she added, "the evidence is that Mr.
Blinder didn't rely on anyone's advice but did what he wanted
to do."</p>
<p>Ms. Murray also rejected the argument that the SEC has a
double-standard of enforcement, meting out more severe
sanctions to firms, such as Blinder Robinson, that aren't
members of the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
