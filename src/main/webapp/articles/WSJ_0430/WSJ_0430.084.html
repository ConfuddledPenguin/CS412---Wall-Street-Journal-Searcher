	<p class="article-leader">Today marks the 15th anniversary of the fall of Saigon.
With communism receding in Europe, Vietnam's plight reminds
us that politics in other areas of the world remain grim and
dangerous.
   Fifteen years is a long time for Vietnam's communist
victors to remain shunned by the West, their government
unrecognized and their trade embargoed by the United States.
So, is it time for rich and mighty America to forget the
grudges of the 1970s and offer Ho Chi Minh's heirs the trade
and aid traditionally allotted to former enemies?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Absolutely not, unless America wants to risk one more
sucker punch. Unhappily, 15 years has not been long enough to
turn Vietnam into a benign presence in Asia.</p>
<p>Today's anniversary has inspired a stack of sermons on the
virtues of wound-healing and chapter-closing. "Washington
continues to act as if Hanoi had sent its troops to invade
Virginia instead of down the Ho Chi Minh trail," chides a
Newsweek article. Like many others, this article goes on to
blame the U.S. trade embargo for the pathetic state of
Vietnam's centrally planned economy. The idea seems to be
that direct U.S. contact would woo over the Hanoi politburo
to the American ways of peace, capitalism and democracy, even
though that tack has hardly worked in China.</p>
<p>Vietnam remains a bastion of repression and a threat to
its neighbors. It is important to insist that it first behave
like a civilized nation before offering it friendly gestures.
That may sound like antique rhetoric at a time when the
Berlin Wall has been reduced to a heap of paperweights. But
in Asia, from China to North Korea to Burma, Laos, Cambodia
and Vietnam, there has so far been no crackup of communist
dictatorships. Neither has there been any significant
reduction in the Pacific military might of Vietnam's Big
Brother, the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Since 1979 Hanoi has allowed the Soviet Pacific fleet
exclusive use of Vietnam's huge facilities at Cam Ranh Bay.
This provides Moscow with a warm water Pacific port for its
warships and submarines, in easy striking distance of the
Philippines, southern China, and the narrow shipping lanes
off Indonesia that link the Persian Gulf and Japan. Were the
Soviet Union's glasnost a done deal, Cam Ranh Bay could be
ignored. But disintegrating empires are dangerous.</p>
<p>Both the Vietnamese and the Soviets have recently been
talking a good game on Cam Ranh Bay, suggesting that American
ships might soon be allowed to dock there. Vietnamese foreign
minister Nguyen Co Thach told a U.S. congressional delegation
earlier this month that the Soviets would be out by 1992. But
Americans should know by now to watch what Vietnam does, not
what it promises to do.</p>
<p>Vietnam also hasn't given up its adventures in neighboring
Cambodia and Laos. A troop withdrawal from Cambodia last
September was much publicized. But there is again evidence of
Vietnamese troops fighting in both Cambodia and Laos.</p>
<p>True, in Cambodia the Vietnamese army may be battling the
even more noxious Khmer Rouge guerrillas. But if Vietnam had
been dedicated to free and fair government, it could have
used its 11-year occupation of Laos and Cambodia to sponsor
genuine reform and elections instead of propping up hated
puppet regimes.</p>
<p>Vietnam's rulers continue to systematically deprive even
their own countrymen of basic rights and freedoms. They have
been experimenting with China-style economic reforms and the
West has heard so many mentions of them by now that one would
think the place must be getting pretty livable. Not so.
Vietnam is still one of the world's most tightly controlled
societies, and hence one of its most stifled, dirt poor
economies.</p>
<p>That's why desperate Vietnamese refugees have for 15 years
been risking their lives to seek asylum abroad. That's why
more than 40,000 such refugees piled into the camps of Hong
Kong last year; that's why boat loads of refugees have been
in the news again recently, pleading for asylum in Indonesia
and Malaysia.</p>
<p>The problem for the West is how to reach out toward the
people of Vietnam without simultaneously handing cash and an
unearned stamp of approval to the disgusting government in
Hanoi. Like China, Vietnam is a country run by a
thick-skinned gang of old communists who have not recognized
that their century is ending, who would rather go on wrecking
their country than risk losing power.</p>
<p>The wisest move for a gracious America would be to take in
the Vietnamese refugees now locked in the camps of Asia. Not
least, these people offer the best conduit for genuine help
to the citizens of Vietnam. Refugees who succeed abroad often
find ways to share their new wealth with relatives back in
Vietnam.</p>
<p>The other contribution America can make -- both to the
people of Vietnam and to their Asian neighbors -- would be to
offer no concessions until it is a sure thing that the 1975
fall of Saigon was indeed Hanoi's last laugh. It will be time
to recognize Vietnam when Hanoi's communists take a hint from
Eastern Europe.</p>
