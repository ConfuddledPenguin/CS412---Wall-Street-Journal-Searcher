	<p class="article-leader">Gentner Electronics Corp. reported a loss of $241,034, or
eight cents a share, in its fiscal third quarter and said it
expects to report a loss for all of fiscal 1990.
   In the 1989 quarter, the maker of electronic audio
equipment had net income of $179,622, or six cents a share.
Revenue in the quarter ended March 31 declined 3% to $1.47
million from $1.51 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>During the quarter, the company said spending on research
and development peaked. The substantial costs in developing
new products and slower-than-expected growth in existing
product sales were primary factors in the quarterly loss, the
company said.</p>
<p>Three products designed to enhance the company's existing
line of sound equipment for use at FM radio stations and a
new line of telephone products are in the final stages of
development. The company said it expects to begin shipping
those products "in the near future."</p>
<p>For the nine months, Salt Lake City-based Gentner had a
loss of $274,000, or nine cents a share, compared with
year-earlier net of $333,000, or 11 cents a share. Revenue
increased 14% to $4.1 million from $3.6 million.</p>
