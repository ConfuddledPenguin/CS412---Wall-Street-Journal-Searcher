	<p class="article-leader">HONG KONG -- The principal aid donors to the Philippines
remain confident about the country's economic prospects and
are unlikely to reduce their levels of support, special U.S.
aid representative Elliot Richardson said.
   Despite a power shortage affecting most of the main island
of Luzon and continuing rumors of another coup attempt, "I
still think the Philippines is an attractive place to
invest," he said in an interview in Hong Kong, where he was
traveling on business.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A former U.S. attorney general and defense secretary and
now a Washington-based lawyer, Mr. Richardson is the special
representative of President Bush to the Multilateral
Assistance Initiative for the Philippines, a World Bank-led
consortium of 19 donor countries and a half-dozen
multilateral agencies. The group was formed in July 1989 to
coordinate foreign-aid programs and attract more overseas
investment to alleviate poverty in the Philippines.</p>
<p>The group pledged $3.3 billion in economic aid for the
Philippines in 1990; it will hold a pledge meeting for 1991
aid sometime in this year's second half. Japan is the biggest
donor, with about $1 billion pledged, followed by the World
Bank and the Asian Development Bank.</p>
<p>The Bush administration pledged $200 million to the
assistance initiative this year, but Congress approved only
$160 million. However, with military aid, the U.S. is
contributing $545 million in direct assistance.</p>
<p>Mr. Richardson said the Bush administration is proposing
$200 million for 1991. He plans to take up the proposal with
congressional leaders soon.</p>
<p>The renegotiation of a lease on U.S. military bases in the
Philippines won't affect the Bush administration's economic
aid program, he said. However, he acknowledged that Congress
may cut economic assistance if the U.S. is required to
provide more military aid in return for extending the bases
agreements beyond the 1991 expiration date. Preliminary talks
on the leases are to begin May 14.</p>
<p>Mr. Richardson, who was in Manila at the onset of the coup
attempt in December, repeated earlier warnings from
Washington that U.S. aid to the Philippines will be cut off
by law if there is a successful coup against President
Corazon Aquino. He said other donors likely would halt aid,
too.</p>
<p>But Mr. Richardson said the likelihood of a successful
putsch diminishes as the 1992 presidential election grows
nearer. He also said the Philippine business community "is
increasingly well aware that the prospects for the Philippine
economy are good if they can sustain progress along present
lines. There is great potential for disaster if a coup
attempt should succeed."</p>
<p>Since coming to power in 1986, the Aquino government has
beaten back six coup attempts by rebel soldiers. The December
coup was the most serious, claiming more than 100 lives. Mr.
Richardson likened rebel leaders, several of whom remain at
large, to 1930s Italian fascists, "whose only program was to
make the trains run on time."</p>
<p>Despite persistent rumors of a seventh coup, Mr.
Richardson said foreign companies are still considering
investments in the Philippines, attracted by the country's
educated, largely English-speaking work force. He cited
continued interest especially from companies in Taiwan and in
Hong Kong, where he met with territory-based investors during
his visit.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Richardson called the electricity shortage
that has led to a temporary four-day workweek in Manila an
"embarrassing development" that should have been foreseen by
the Aquino government when it shelved a controversial nuclear
power plant.</p>
<p>But he said the power shortage was "correctable" in time,
adding that much of the foreign aid is aimed at improving
infrastructure.</p>
<p>More than coup attempts, he said, donors are concerned
about improving the speed and efficiency of the use of
foreign-aid money in the Philippines. "The most significant
concern of the donors in general and the U.S. Congress in
particular is the pipeline problem," Mr. Richardson said. But
he added that the Aquino government was working to remove
bottlenecks delaying aid dispersal.</p>
