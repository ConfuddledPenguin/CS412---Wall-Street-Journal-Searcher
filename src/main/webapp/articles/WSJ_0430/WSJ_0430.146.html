	<p class="article-leader">Filmstar Inc., Los Angeles, said it made a bid to acquire
the assets of AEG Acquisition Corp., a closely held
entertainment concern that is in bankruptcy-law proceedings,
for $10 million in cash and securities.
   Filmstar, which provides services to independent movie
producers, said its bid consists of $7.5 million in cash and
the balance in securities.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The bid is for some of AEG's receivables, its domestic or
foreign distribution rights to about 117 movies, seven
unproduced movies, and interests in about 20 other
development projects, as well as four offices and two
residential properties that AEG owns.</p>
<p>Alan Saffron, AEG chairman and chief executive officer,
said bids have been received from two other parties that he
declined to name. One is an all-cash offer, "which the estate
favors very much," he said.</p>
<p>AEG has been operating with protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code since July.</p>
