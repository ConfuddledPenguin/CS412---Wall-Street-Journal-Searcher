	<p class="article-leader">Saab-Scania AB said sales jumped 14% and pretax profit
increased at a somewhat faster rate in the first quarter.
   But the Saab Automobile AB joint venture with General
Motors Corp. had falling sales and continued to struggle with
costs at Swedish plants, Saab-Scania Chief Executive Georg
Karnsund said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a speech at the annual meeting, Mr. Karnsund said
Saab-Scania's first-quarter sales rose to 7.4 billion Swedish
kronor ($1.21 billion) from 6.5 billion kronor a year
earlier. Profit wasn't disclosed, pending the company's
financial report for the year's first four months.</p>
<p>But Mr. Karnsund disclosed that operating profit fell at
the Scania truck division in the first three months --
despite a 9% increase in sales.</p>
<p>Mr. Karnsund said retail sales of Saab cars skidded 15%,
to 24,700 from 29,200, continuing the downward trend of
recent years. The unit's operating profit fell as a result of
lower volume, rapid cost increases and high interest rates
prevailing in Sweden, he added.</p>
<p>Directors elected Anders Scharp, chief executive officer
at Swedish appliance maker AB Electrolux, Saab-Scania's
chairman, succeeding Sten Gustafssons.</p>
