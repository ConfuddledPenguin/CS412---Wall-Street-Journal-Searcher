	<p class="article-leader">IVREA, Italy -- Ing. C. Olivetti & Co. reported a 43% drop
in consolidated net income for 1989, but Managing Director
Vittorio Cassoni, citing more than satisfactory first-quarter
sales and orders, expressed optimism about a possible
turnaround in 1990.
   The Italian office-equipment maker posted group net income
of 202.8 billion lire ($164.8 million) for 1989, down from
356.2 billion lire a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The results were at the lower end of analysts'
expectations. On average, analysts had estimated 1989 net
earnings at around 250 billion lire. Mr. Cassoni blamed the
decline on costs related to last year's reorganization,
combined with a slump in the world-wide computer industry.</p>
<p>Olivetti also said that operating earnings declined 5.8%
to 382.4 billion lire from 406 billion lire. Group sales rose
7.4% to 9.031 trillion lire from 8.407 trillion lire.</p>
<p>The board of directors, which met in the Olivetti
headquarters at Ivrea, decided to cut the dividend by 21% to
270 lire a common share from 340 lire a share. Saving shares,
which have a preferential status, will get 290 lire, down
from 360 lire for 1988.</p>
<p>Chairman Carlo De Benedetti said in a statement that last
year "had been very difficult and that in this context
Olivetti managed to outgrow the market and maintain its
operating profitability virtually unchanged."</p>
<p>Mr. Cassoni showed optimism about the prospects for 1990.
He said group sales in the first quarter of the year rose a
substantial 8.7% from a year earlier, while new orders in the
January-March period jumped 21.3% from the previous year.</p>
<p>Mr. Cassoni also confirmed that talks with N.V. Philips
could possibly lead to a partnership with the Dutch
electronics giant. He indicated the partnership may include
an exchange of shareholdings or be limited to the takeover of
a stake by one of the partners. He declined to confirm
reports that the agreement would be limited to a sector
partnership in electronic components and printers.</p>
