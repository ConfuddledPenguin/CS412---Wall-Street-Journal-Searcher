	<p class="article-leader">Horten AG, West Germany's fourth-largest retailer, halved
its 1989 dividend to three marks ($1.78) a share, continuing
its widely fluctuating payout pattern of recent years and
citing falling profit.
   The company reported that 1989 profit fell 57% to 15
million marks ($8.9 million) from 35 million marks in 1988,
citing costs associated with the reorganization of its
Galeria department store operations. It didn't provide any
more financial data, though earlier this year, Horten said
1989 sales fell 3.7% to 3.02 billion marks, citing the
shedding and restructuring of some operations.</p>
