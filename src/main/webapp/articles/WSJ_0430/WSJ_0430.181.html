	<p class="article-leader">CANBERRA -- Australia's cotton crop has been damaged by
widespread rains that have flooded much of eastern Australia.
   A spokesman for the Australian Bureau of Agricutural and
Resource Economics said the quality of cotton will have been
spoiled by the heavy rains and this will lower export
returns.</p>

exports would total 508 million Australian dollars (US$383.2
million) for the year ending June 30.</p>
