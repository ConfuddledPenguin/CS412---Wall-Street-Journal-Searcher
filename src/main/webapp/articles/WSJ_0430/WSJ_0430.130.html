	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Import contracts signed by Japan's major trading
companies in March jumped a record 53.8% from a year earlier
to 2.874 trillion yen ($18.05 billion), the Japan Foreign
Trade Council said Friday.
   Export contracts climbed 39.9% to 3.406 trillion yen,
posting the strongest year-on-year advance since March 1982.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A council official attributed the rise in export contracts
to sharp increases in plant and machinery export contracts
during March.</p>
<p>A rise in fuel import contracts paced the overall advance
in the import category, with the council citing a weakening
of the oil market as a factor prompting an increase in
contracts signed.</p>
<p>The council's monthly reports are based on contract
statistics provided by 18 major Japanese trading companies,
and are widely considered to be short-term indicators of
overall trade trends. The companies furnishing contract
statistics account for roughly half of Japan's general
exports and about two-thirds of imports.</p>
<p>In February, export contracts rose 1.2% from the year
before, the first increase in three months. Imports edged up
0.3%, the smallest rise in four months.</p>
<p>For fiscal 1989, export contracts rose 10.1% to 14.568
trillion yen, while import contracts climbed 20.4% to 17.088
trillion yen.</p>
