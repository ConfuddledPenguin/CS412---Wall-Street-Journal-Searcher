	<p class="article-leader">As one of the many Americans who indulged their curiosity
about the Soviet Union by reading Hedrick Smith's 1977 best
seller, "The Russians," I looked forward with some eagerness
to Mr. Smith's new TV series, "Inside Gorbachev's U.S.S.R."
The series, which focuses on the changes wrought by glasnost
and perestroika, airs Mondays -- tonight through May 21 (9-10
p.m. EDT, on PBS; check local listings).
   The series rewarded my eagerness by offering a glimpse of
Soviet life that is infinitely more nuanced and comprehending
than the tidbits dished up by the network news, never mind
the propagandistic mush shoveled out by previous TV series
such as Ted Turner's 1988 "Portrait of the Soviet Union." Mr.
Smith is well served by his three years in Moscow as bureau
chief for the New York Times. Not only does he speak the
Russian language (rare enough in a Western journalist), he
also empathizes with the Soviet people.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>We see this empathy in tonight's episode, when Mr. Smith
interviews four women holding a hunger strike on the steps of
a church in the central Russian city of Ivanovo. Closed in
the 1930s, the church is now a "government archive" --
meaning it is stacked with documents so old we can
practically smell the mildew. The women, who have been lying
in the cold for four days in a protest aimed at reopening the
church, reply to Mr. Smith's gentle questioning with feeble
voices but eloquent eyes.</p>
<p>Yet because Mr. Smith is such a simpatico reporter, he
returns a few weeks later to talk again with the women. After
16 days, they tell him, they finally got the local party
official to promise a resolution of the problem by the end of
the month. "And so you ended it?" asks Mr. Smith. "Yes, we
believed him," one says without irony. "After all, he's a
Communist." Expressing no surprise that religious women would
trust a Communist, Mr. Smith simply adds that, after five
months, the church remains closed.</p>
<p>As the rest of the programs proceed, Mr. Smith maintains
the same unruffled manner when bright hopes for political
democratization, legally protected free speech, economic
liberty and national self-determination meet official
resistance. Nor is he surprised to see these same hopes
founder on the ambivalent attitudes of even the most
committed reformers. Unlike most of his media colleagues, Mr.
Smith knows better than to assume that inside every Russian
there is an American trying to get out.</p>
<p>Nowhere is the Russians' ambivalence clearer than in the
third (May 14) segment, "Looking for Perestroika." The film,
which would be better titled "Desperately Seeking
Perestroika," presents vivid testimony from Siberian coal
mines, Ukrainian potato farms and Ural heavy industries about
the frustrations of partial reform. As one manager puts it:
"In your country, normal economic relations exist -- meaning,
you have money."</p>
<p>A similar impasse faces Mark Masarsky, a Novgorod
"entrepreneur" trying to launch a construction business.
After buying a brick factory and replacing its prison labor
force with productive workers attracted by the prospect of
high wages, profit sharing and home ownership, he is stymied
by a lack of lumber. There's a sawmill nearby, but the state
forbids it to trade with him. As the camera pans along a pile
of rotting logs, Mr. Masarsky sums up the problem: "This
lumber belongs to everybody . . . and nobody."</p>
<p>Yet even Mr. Masarsky is ambivalent toward Western-style
capitalism. His employees are all shareholders, and he
clearly wouldn't have it any other way. At one point, Mr.
Smith links Mr. Masarsky's views with the New Economic Policy
(NEP) decreed by Lenin in 1921. In Mr. Smith's voice-over
narrative, the NEP is described as "socialist capitalism,"
with "socialism" defined as "a society of civilized
cooperators."</p>
<p>Before we get all misty about the good old days of Lenin's
perestroika, we should recall the reasons for the NEP, as
summarized by the Sovietologist S. Frederick Starr: "Lenin,
realizing that the peasantry was solidly opposed to
bolshevism and that the Bolsheviks themselves possessed
neither the numbers nor the skills to manage the economy,
took a giant step backward to state capitalism."</p>
<p>In fact, "state capitalism" is too kind a term. According
to the British historian Paul Johnson, "NEP was, in fact,
surrender to the peasants and the return to a market system
based on barter. The goonsquads {who had been seizing food at
gunpoint} were withdrawn, and . . . small factories and
workshops were allowed to start up again, outside the control
of the state, to produce goods the peasants were willing to
accept in exchange for grain."</p>
<p>As it turned out, the NEP was too little, too late. The
peasants had already been prevented from sowing that year's
crop, and when drought came, there were no reserves.
Approximately three million people died in the terrible
famine that followed. Add to this figure Mr. Johnson's
estimate of 50,000 people murdered by Lenin's secret police
by 1920, and you have something other than "a society of
civilized cooperators."</p>
<p>It is ironic, in light of this history, that next week's
episode should be called "Comfortable Lies, Bitter Truths."
For the whole series endorses the biggest and most
comfortable lie of the Gorbachev era -- namely, that the bad
guy of Soviet history is not Lenin, but Stalin. To cite one
of many examples, Mr. Smith declares in tonight's episode
that "not since Lenin" has a Soviet leader accepted criticism
as willingly as Mikhail Gorbachev.</p>
<p>Perhaps Mr. Smith has forgotten that it was Lenin, not
Stalin, who expanded the secret police to 16 times its size
under the czars, and replaced the court system with
"revolutionary tribunals" that executed people not for
committing crimes, but for belonging to the wrong class and
ideological categories. His goal, proclaimed in 1918, was to
"purge the Russian land of all kinds of harmful insects."</p>
<p>Some of those insects remember. To judge by the young
students whose classroom we visit next week, the bitter truth
is not far from the surface. To the question of whether
Stalin's dictatorship was inevitable, one girl comments: "It
seems to me that Stalin was a product of the system." A boy
adds that if Lenin was as guilty as Stalin, "then the whole
foundation is destroyed." Another boy suggests that Lenin's
drive to "separate all thinking people from the state" made
him "close to Stalin."</p>
<p>You will get a new slant on glasnost when you watch Leonid
Milgram, the principal of the school, abruptly cut off this
line of inquiry. "You are out of bounds," he says. Lenin and
Stalin are not the same. If only you "pessimistic" young
people would "study more history," you would come to
understand it "correctly," he says. At this point, it becomes
clear that, as good as this series is, it would be a whole
lot better if the simpatico Mr. Smith had spent less time
with that principal, and more with those students.</p>
