	<p class="article-leader">You probably are aware that if you crave real action
Atlantic City and Las Vegas are two places that can provide
it nonstop. However, you might not know that you can get more
action than you want in the privacy of your own home. And
like the two gambling meccas it's all legal -- no fear of
busted kneecaps here.
   The books reviewed below will tell you how you might
triple your wealth in a year or less. But since returns from
high-risk investments are far from guaranteed, you also might
find yourself popping frozen macaroni-and-cheese dinners into
the microwave six nights a week, and not eating at all on the
seventh.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>All commodity traders and most stock investors know what a
margin clerk is. That's the brokerage-house employee who
calls you up and asks you to post more money after a trade
you have made has gone bad. As a rule those phone calls are
not pleasant. But if you read Michael Curley's book
"Understanding and Using Margin" (Probus, 158 pages, $19.95),
you might be able to avoid receiving such calls. Mr. Curley's
book is written for stock and bond investors and not for
those who trade commodities or options on futures.
Nevertheless, it provides good basic information for anyone
who trades on margin -- that is, someone who borrows a
portion of the cost of his or her investment. The book shows
readers what margin can do for an investor if he is right
about his investments and, alas, the consequences if he is
wrong. (It would not be of much use to commodity traders
since futures trading involves no borrowing of funds as it
does when trading equities and debt instruments on margin.)</p>

<p>The future will be just like the past, only different,
says Bruce Babcock Jr. in his book "The Dow Jones-Irwin Guide
to Trading Systems" (Dow Jones-Irwin, 316 pages, $57.50).
With that warning one might wonder why bother to even try to
devise a trading system to extract profits from the commodity
markets? But Mr. Babcock makes a fairly convincing argument
that with a little patience, thought and an inexpensive
personal computer profitable systems can be created.
(However, whether you or anyone else will be able to use such
systems to actually take money from the markets is another
story. Developing trading systems and using them profitably
are two separate skills, not necessarily related.)</p>
<p>Mr. Babcock starts with market basics and makes trading
sound easy. But then he explains why about 70% of all
commodity traders lose money and you learn it has nothing to
do with the nature of markets and everything to do with the
nature of people. Chapter 7 alone is worth the price of the
book as it gives a brief history of the marketing of trading
systems. If the practices he describes didn't cost people so
much money, it would be hilarious to read about the sales
pitches that have persuaded traders to shell out thousands of
dollars for questionable systems. (Unfortunately, these same
methods continue in use today.) Readers will learn how to
design and test trading systems.</p>
<p>More importantly they also will learn about the pitfalls
of "curve-fitting," that is, designing a system that trades
the past perfectly but has about the same chance of producing
profits in the future as I have of becoming a pilot in the
Chinese air force. Mr. Babcock doesn't just show you how to
develop a successful system but actually provides you with
several of them that appear, at least on paper, to have the
potential of being profitable in the future. Unfortunately,
most investors do not have the discipline to trade any system
for consistent profits.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>But futures are not the only derivative instruments that
markets offer to dyed-in-the-wool risk takers. They also
offer options on futures. Readers who want a straight-forward
introduction to the subject should read Ronald Frost's book
"Options on Futures" (Probus, 254 pages, $55). Mr. Frost has
written the text as a workbook and provides exercises after
each section to let readers see if they truly understand the
meaning of such terms as delta, theta, gamma and a Christmas
tree spread.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>I'm not the type of guy who leads readers into a casino
and says, "Here's $50, good luck]" and walks out. So here's a
book by three attorneys, Stephen Elias, Albin Renauer and
Robin Leonard, that could be your lifeline if you do some
foolish things after reading any of the three books just
reviewed. It's called "How to File for Bankruptcy" (Nolo
Press, 203 pages, $24.95). This book shows how any
intelligent person can use Chapter 7 of the Federal
Bankruptcy Code to cancel his debts and start fresh. It won't
help at all in complicated cases such as a married person
filing for bankruptcy separately from a spouse or for people
in business partnerships. The book explains in some detail
what property can be kept after bankruptcy and how to fill
out the various bankruptcy forms. Unlike most things written
by attorneys, this cheerful book is in plain English with
little jargon.</p>
