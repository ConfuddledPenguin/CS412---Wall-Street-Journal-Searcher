	<p class="article-leader">MINNEAPOLIS -- SciMed Life Systems Inc. said competitor
C.R. Bard Inc. filed a suit in federal court here alleging
that SciMed is infringing on a C.R. Bard heart-catheter
patent.
   In a statement, Dale Spencer, president of SciMed, said
the company is reviewing the matter with counsel. He said,
"SciMed's policy is not to violate the patent rights of
others. SciMed intends to vigorously defend against this
suit."</p>

still pending, according to Mr. Spencer, who was reached at
home.</p>
