	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- While the new foreign friends of the U.S.
struggle, Washington is dithering over how to help them.
   Nicaragua now has a new president, and Panama's pro-U.S.
government has been in power almost four months. Yet Congress
and the White House have failed to agree on a basic package
of $720 million in "emergency" aid to help those two
countries.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>What's more, that failure probably only foreshadows more
floundering this year in setting the broader foreign-aid
program of the U.S. The difficulties stem partly from
Congress's continued distaste for foreign aid and partly from
President Bush's failure to offer a new aid program more in
tune with world changes. Whatever the cause, the problems
raise doubts about whether the U.S. is up to meeting one of
the most rudimentary foreign-policy requirements of the
1990s: helping new democracies get on their feet.</p>
<p>Instead of acting, Congress and the Bush administration
are bickering. That was clear recently when President Bush
and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell had a discussion
on foreign aid that, according to a White House aide who was
there, degenerated into the nastiest argument of Mr. Bush's
presidency.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush, who had invited congressional leaders to the
White House to discuss pending issues, asked whether the
Senate would get moving soon on the aid for Panama and
Nicaragua. Sen. Mitchell then dropped a bombshell: He said
the Senate wouldn't take up the aid package until after it
finished a complicated child-care bill.</p>
<p>President Bush, sensing that the Central American aid was
going to be held hostage to force him to accept a child-care
bill he doesn't like, bristled. "You told me a week ago this
would be a top priority," he declared to Mr. Mitchell, one
observer recalls. Jousting between the two continued until
Sen. Mitchell said: "I'm going to run things the way I want
to run them," the observer recalls.</p>
<p>Later, an agreement was worked out under which the Senate
has taken up the aid bill before the child-care measure. But
now President Bush, despite his insistence that the aid is a
top national priority, is the one threatening to kill the
package. The White House says he's nearly certain to veto the
aid bill unless senators remove an unrelated provision that
would allow the use of government funds for abortions in the
District of Columbia.</p>
<p>For his part, Sen. Mitchell says he has a fundamental
problem with the president's approach to foreign aid. He
declares that the administration has offered "no plan at all"
for how to tie various pieces of foreign aid to emerging
democracies into a coherent package. He's cool to approving
aid in bits and pieces.</p>
<p>That's a concern many other Democrats share. Many are
bewildered, for instance, that at the same time the
administration was proposing its emergency aid for the new
democracies in Panama and Nicaragua, it was offering a mere
$500,000 in aid this year for Namibia, an African nation that
has just become independent and democratic. Congress is in
the process of boosting that to $10 million.</p>
<p>Rep. David Obey (D., Wis.), head of the House
appropriations subcommittee that handles foreign aid, has
complained to the State Department that the administration's
$15.3 billion foreign-aid budget proposed for next year would
increase overall funds for Eastern Europe by only about $100
million, despite the democratic revolution that has swept
that region. And despite the virtual end of the Cold War, the
Bush administration is seeking an increase in military aid
that, in percentage terms, roughly matches the increase in
non-military aid.</p>
<p>Rep. Lee Hamilton (D., Ind.), a senior member of the House
Foreign Affairs Committee, complains that the Bush
administration simply took its 1990 aid plan and said, "Ditto
for 1991." He adds: "There's not been an overall review."</p>
<p>A fundamental obstacle to such a new strategy, though, is
the distaste in Congress -- and among the American people --
for foreign aid. Republican pollster Richard Wirthlin
recently asked in a survey whether America should help
rebuild the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe, as it did
in Western Europe after World War II. Some 62% of those
polled said America shouldn't help.</p>
<p>So, the administration and congressional leaders face the
challenge of making a public case for foreign aid. "Foreign
aid isn't the most popular program in the Congress," says
Rep. Stephen Solarz (D., N.Y.) of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee. But, he adds, "with the end of the Cold War, the
foreign-aid program becomes a more important vehicle than
ever for the promotion of American values and protection of
American interests."</p>
