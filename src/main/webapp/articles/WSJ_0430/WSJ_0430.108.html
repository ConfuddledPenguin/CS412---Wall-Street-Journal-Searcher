	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- In May, the yen will confirm it has hit
bottom, the mark will narrowly survive economic-union
jitters, and gloom surrounding the dollar will vanish.
   That's the outlook of 10 economists and currency dealers
in Tokyo; Frankfurt, West Germany; London and New York
interviewed by Dow Jones International News Service. By the
end of May, these experts' average forecast calls for the
dollar to stand at 159.20 yen and 1.6980 marks. The mark is
seen slipping to 93.76 yen.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In late Friday afternoon New York trading, the dollar was
at 159.30 yen, up from 159.23 yen late Thursday, and at
1.6775 marks, down from 1.6803 marks. The mark was trading at
94.96 yen up from 94.76 yen.</p>
<p>Where and whether interest rates will rise remains a
source of widespread speculation and disagreement. While most
see real U.S. rates rising relative to Japanese and West
German rates, others see them falling or holding even.</p>
<p>But there is a consensus that the yen is undervalued and
the mark overvalued, suggesting both deserve correction.</p>
<p>At the beginning of April, a similar survey predicted the
dollar would be about 156.73 yen by the end of April, with
estimates spread evenly between 162 yen and 150 yen. One bear
said 136 yen.</p>
<p>The early April survey saw the dollar at 1.7150 marks by
the end of April, with estimates ranging from a low of 1.65
marks to a high of 1.75 marks.</p>
<p>"Real" interest rates -- nominal rates minus anticipated
inflation -- were cited by most in the survey as the key to
predicting exchange rates. While acknowledging problems with
the political and economic unification of the two Germanys,
most of the respondents said the mark would be the main
currency of Europe in the 1990s. The survey's two West German
experts, however, were relatively bearish on the mark's
prospects for May.</p>
<p>Ingo Kuller, chief trader at Westdeutsche Landesbank
Girozentrale in Duesseldorf, said reunification will cast a
shadow over the mark for many months to come, and the
energies of the Bundesbank will be diverted away from holding
the dollar down as it grapples with the specter of rising
inflation. He sees the dollar climbing to 1.7640 marks by the
end of May and higher, to 1.78 marks, in 90 days.</p>
<p>Klaus Groner, chief trader at Bayerische Vereinsbank in
Munich, differs over the 90-day term, expecting the U.S.
currency to fall against the mark to 1.65 marks later in the
spring as worries about the monetary union with East Germany
abate. "I see a renaissance for the mark," he said. "The way
the government in Bonn is systematically tackling the
problems with monetary union is encouraging."</p>
<p>Most of the respondents said the Bundesbank can keep
inflation under wraps, predicting a 3% or lower rate for the
year. Though most survey respondents said a boost in West
German interest rates was in the cards, one economist
suggested that nation's rates would ease because politics has
outrun economics.</p>
<p>"I recognize it's a new ball game for the Germans," said
Irwin Kellner, chief economist for Manufacturers Hanover
Trust in New York, "but I'd say the markets have already
discounted the effects of this and then some," leaving the
dollar room to correct.</p>
<p>Mr. Kellner said trade-related pressures have led to an
undervaluation of the dollar against European currencies and
an overvaluation against the yen. The dollar should be buying
fewer than 140 yen, he said, instead of 159 yen.</p>
<p>The U.S. posted an unadjusted $959.6 million trade surplus
with Western Europe in February, compared with a $309.8
million deficit in January, putting the U.S. ahead $650
million through March. Against Japan, meanwhile, the
unadjusted trade gap widened in February to $3.12 billion
from $2.86 billion in January.</p>
<p>Survey participants generally agreed the Japanese base
interest rate wouldn't fall, but were reluctant to say it was
certain to rise in the month or 90-day period. The yen, in
this scenario, likely will stay weak but not slip further.</p>
<p>Russell Sheldon, senior economist at Mellon Bank,
Pittsburgh, said Japan may have an emerging inflation
problem. "I don't think they'll be tightening policy to the
degree they'd need to" to control inflation, he said. Japan's
consumer prices, a key index of inflation, rose 2.9% in the
fiscal year ended March 31, the largest gain since 1981.</p>
<p>As long as Tokyo stock and government bond markets stay
shaky and prospects for European growth are good, "strong
demand for dollars and other currencies will keep the yen
weak," said Shigeito Yanase, manager of foreign-exchange
trading at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Political problems still dog the yen, Mr. Yanase noted.
Talk in Tokyo that Liberal Democratic Party elders could
force Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu to resign before
a July economic summit in Houston will hinder any sort of yen
recovery, he said.</p>
<p>Prospects for a tightening of U.S. monetary policy, which
would tend to boost the dollar, are at least as tenuous as
those for Japan and West Germany. Again, no one saw the U.S.
Federal Reserve lowering interest rates, but only two said
flat-out that rates would rise.</p>
<p>Supporting that view were sharply higher inflation
readings released Friday with U.S. provisional first-quarter
gross national product data. The implicit price deflator rose
at a 5.7% rate, the largest increase since the third quarter
of 1982, and the fixed-weight deflator, another inflation
gauge, was up 6.5%, the largest leap since the fourth quarter
of 1981.</p>
<p>"U.S. consumer price inflation should be around 4.5% in
the second quarter, an unacceptable level for the Federal
Reserve Board," said a senior corporate dealer with a large
Tokyo-based bank.</p>
<p>The same dealer said growth in Japanese institutional
investor demand for dollar-denominated investments should
fall off, but dollar investments will still grow in absolute
terms.</p>
<p>Forecasts for the pound averaged $1.613 in 30 days and
$1.606 in 90 days, and were the most tightly-grouped
forecasts among the currencies surveyed. All 10 participants
said the pound would be about $1.6 in both periods, ranging
from five $1.6 estimates to a low of $1.65 in the 30 days;
for the longer period, estimates ranged from a bearish $1.53
to $1.67. Late Friday in New York, sterling was at $1.6350,
below $1.6343 late Thursday in New York.</p>
<p>On New York's Commodity Exchange Friday, current-delivery
gold settled at $371.10 an ounce, up 20 cents. Because of
computer failure, trading was limited. Estimated volume was
only 700,000 ounces.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong Monday, gold was quoted at $371.60 an ounce.</p>
