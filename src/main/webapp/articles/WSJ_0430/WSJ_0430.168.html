	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The Gannett Foundation's plan to sell its 10%
stake in Gannett Co. has raised questions about whether the
broadcasting and media giant has been put into play as a
possible takeover target by Allen Neuharth, the former
Gannett chairman who now heads the foundation.
   The foundation, the largest Gannett holder, this past week
said it hired investment bankers to negotiate the sale of its
stake in the company, which had revenue of $3.5 billion last
year. The foundation's 15.9 million shares, based on
Gannett's recent stock price of about $36 apiece, have an
indicated market value of close to $600 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts said that while Gannett would be a difficult and
costly takeover target, a major block of Gannett stock on the
market could attract unfriendly bidders from the U.S. or
overseas. So far, Gannett has said it hasn't decided whether
it might buy the stock itself. The foundation said it would
prefer to put the stock in the hands of Gannett, but "our
financial adviser will explore all alternatives."</p>
<p>Wall Street analysts speculated that the planned sale also
appears to reflect a growing rift between Mr. Neuharth and
his successor, John J. Curley, Gannett chairman, president
and chief executive officer. Mr. Neuharth denied that is the
case, and said in an interview that the foundation's move was
spurred by Internal Revenue Service regulations that forced
the foundation to consider diversifying its holdings.</p>
<p>"Our bankers have told us to invest our assets in
something with a higher yield to meet the obligations the IRS
puts on us," Mr. Neuharth said. Putting the entire block of
stock up for sale at once is also an attempt to "maximize
{the stock's} value, rather than dribbling out portions of it
over time," he said.</p>
<p>Analysts stressed that a takeover of Gannett would be a
monumental task for anyone. While Gannett has only one class
of stock and doesn't operate with specific anti-takeover
provisions, it is regarded as one of the best-managed
companies in the industry, with more than 80 consecutive
quarters of uninterrupted earnings growth, despite its costly
launch of the USA Today newspaper.</p>
<p>"Gannett is really protected by the fact it is efficiently
run and financially strong," said John Morton, an analyst
with Lynch, Jones & Ryan. "It would be difficult for an
outsider to say they could improve on the operating profits."</p>
<p>During Mr. Neuharth's reign, Gannett had friendly merger
conversations with other large media companies, including CBS
Inc. and Time Inc., though nothing ever came of the talks.
While Gannett has in the past been mentioned as a potential
target for an unfriendly suitor, a raider would have to come
up with more than $6 billion to purchase Gannett's 161
million shares outstanding. And that's at the current stock
price; a buyer would probably have to come up with a
considerable premium.</p>
<p>What's more, highly leveraged takeover attempts are
becoming far more difficult for U.S. companies to mount. And
foreign companies with the financial muscle would face
another problem: Gannett owns seven television stations, and
foreign ownership of broadcasting properties is restricted by
U.S. federal rules.</p>
<p>"A foreign buyer would run into a buzz saw of regulation
problems, since Gannett owns TV stations too," said J.
Kendrik Noble, an analyst for PaineWebber Inc. "However, you
can't rule out another media company buying {the stock} and
can't rule out an unfriendly takeover."</p>
<p>Mr. Morton of Lynch Jones said he expects most other
newspaper companies to keep their distance. "A fraternity
exists in newspapers. There would be long talks before any
such move were made," Mr. Morton said. Asked if his company
was interested in Gannett stock, James K. Batten, chairman
and chief executive officer of Knight-Ridder Inc. said he
wasn't interested. "We have discretionary money, but that
wouldn't make sense to us."</p>
<p>Despite the foundation's statement about IRS rules,
analysts are still puzzled by the timing of the planned sale.
With the newspaper industry in one of its worst periods in
decades, newspaper stocks have been hard hit, including
Gannett. In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Gannett fell $1 to $36.125; in the summer of 1987,
when Gannett shares were trading in the $50s, the
foundation's stock would have been valued at as much as $900
million.</p>
<p>"I think the personality question needs to be resolved,"
said Peter Appert, analyst for C.J. Lawrence. "Why's Al doing
this now? The timing is crazy." Analysts cited evidence of
tension between Mr. Neuharth and Mr. Curley; Mr. Curley, for
example, has kept up a running commentary in front of
securities analysts about how he has cut the lavish corporate
expense budget that once belonged to "Al {Neuharth} and his
entourage." Mr. Curley, who was handpicked by Mr. Neuharth,
has cut at least $16 million from corporate expenses. Mr.
Curley has sold off at least one company jet, and unlike Mr.
Neuharth, prefers taxis to limousines. Gannett has instituted
strict cost controls companywide this year, such as cutting
corporate travel expenses.</p>
<p>Asked about a rift between the two, who often throw barbs
at each other publicly, Mr. Curley said that "honestly, there
isn't one." Mr. Neuharth said: "Anyone who knows us knows
that for 20 years we have been jabbing and ribbing each
other. I did select him to succeed me. But I understand where
the speculation is coming from."</p>
<p>In part, the speculation comes from Mr. Neuharth himself.
In a recent column in USA Today about Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev's troubles with Lithuania, he said, "I know how
Gorby feels. In recent years, some people I favored or
fostered over a quarter century have turned and bitten my
hand." Mr. Neuharth said of the column, "You can speculate
but there's been lots of people in my life -- friends,
family."</p>
<p>Last week, Mr. Curley, along with other current Gannett
executives, withdrew from re-election to the foundation's
board to avoid any potential conflict of interest.</p>
