	<p class="article-leader">NEWTON, Iowa -- The abortion wars are being fought in the
community halls of Iowa again.
   The parking lot is chock-full of pickups and vans, and
inside the union hall, a windowless building dropped beside a
cornfield here in central Iowa, Donald Avenson is vowing to
"protect the most important decision that a woman may have to
make."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Avenson, Iowa's House speaker, is involved in more
than a bitter gubernatorial primary to see which Democrat
will face two-term GOP Gov. Terry Branstad in the autumn
election. He is a principal in perhaps the greatest electoral
challenge that his abortion-rights allies have faced
nationwide since the Supreme Court last July gave the states
room to restrict abortion.</p>
<p>Although polls consistently have shown that Iowans favor
abortion rights, an abortion opponent, Attorney General Tom
Miller, for months has led Mr. Avenson and banker John
Chrystal, both abortion-rights supporters. Mr. Miller, whose
lead has dwindled as the June 5 primary approaches, attracts
a surprisingly substantial backing from abortion-rights
supporters.</p>
<p>"If the abortion-rights movement is going to have any
weight, it has to get its supporters in line," says Arthur
Miller, a University of Iowa political scientist. "There's
something wrong with the pro-choice message if they can't win
this."</p>
<p>Abortion-rights activists sense this, too, and last week,
armed with an infusion of cash from the National Abortion
Rights Action League in Washington, they began an advertising
offensive against Mr. Miller, saying he "wants to take away
your right to choose and give it to the politicians."</p>
<p>But the offensive, already handicapped because the
abortion-rights vote is largely split between two candidates,
encountered two obstacles it hadn't anticipated: the refusal
of seven television network affiliates across the state to
air the ads and the ferocious backlash of Iowans -- including
many of the candidates' own supporters -- who regard the
Washington activists as modern-day equivalents of the
handcart pioneers, the unwelcome outsiders who flooded Iowa
in the 19th century on their way west.</p>
<p>"I wish NARAL had kept their butt out of here," says Mr.
Chrystal, who trails the two other men in a very close race.
"Maybe it's to my benefit, but I find it offensive when a
group comes in from Washington, D.C., and tries to tell us
what to do."</p>
<p>The worry here in Newton, where the jobs of most of the
voters are related to the ingenuity of the Maytag brothers --
one whose tinkering with farm machinery led to a
washer-and-dryer works, the other whose agricultural bent led
to Maytag blue cheese -- is that the anti-Miller drive might
backfire.</p>
<p>"It's absolutely sleazy for any of the fringe fanatical
groups to come in and spend all that money trying to pull one
over on Iowans," says Democratic state Rep. Dennis Black of
Newton, an Avenson supporter. "If they bash Tom Miller too
much, they could help him."</p>
<p>These calculations aren't the idle ruminations of
politicians who are lost in the arcana of public-opinion
polls. Democrats, who have been kept out of the Terrace Hill
governor's mansion for 22 years, know that abortion was
critical in the defeats of two of their incumbent senators,
Richard Clark in 1978 and John Culver in 1980.</p>
<p>Abortion, moreover, is part of the landscape of even the
smallest Iowa crossroad town. Thirty miles from here, across
the street from the 65-foot memorial to the devout Dutch
farmers who settled the small community of Pella, and just
beside the Vander Ploey Bakery, which specializes in the
S-shaped Dutch pastries filled with almond paste, Francis
Schiebout, the local State Farm Insurance agent, has hung a
large "Preserve Life" sign across his window.</p>
<p>Mr. Avenson, the longest serving House speaker in Iowa's
history, and Mr. Chrystal, a Coons Rapids banker who has
pioneered U.S. agricultural ties with the Soviet Union and
has had a longtime association with Mikhail Gorbachev, favor
no restrictions on abortion. Mr. Miller opposes the use of
Medicaid funds or the use of public health facilities for
abortions except in cases of rape, incest or danger to the
life of the mother. The 12-year attorney general, who says he
doesn't expect major changes in Iowa's liberal abortion law,
supports a provision requiring parents of minors to be
notified of their daughter's intentions to have an abortion.</p>
<p>In recent days, Mr. Miller, so sensitive about the
abortion issue that for 10 months he has refused to complete
a questionnaire submitted to him by his allies at the Iowa
Right to Life Committee, has tried to shift the attention
away from abortion. When the issue flared during a televised
debate in Sioux City last week, the attorney general pleaded
that it was "time to move on" to other issues.</p>
<p>Mr. Avenson's campaign has won important labor
endorsements and seems to have the most momentum. He tried
unsuccessfully to muscle Mr. Chrystal out of the race in
recent days but stands to win NARAL's support if the group,
for the first time, decides to make an endorsement in a
primary.</p>
<p>Although abortion opponents customarily have been the
first to raise the issue in Iowa elections, abortion-rights
activists took the initiative this time. Now, however, they
are worried that unless they succeed in defeating Mr. Miller,
the November election could be lost in June because both Gov.
Branstad and his Democratic challenger would oppose abortion.
"We may have to look at new strategies," says Kate Michelman,
the group's executive director. "I don't want to see Tom
Miller win because we have split the pro-choice vote."</p>
<p>In the meantime, local organizers are planning hundreds of
house parties around the state to identify and mobilize
abortion-rights activists and are pressing their efforts to
force TV network affiliates to join the cable outlets in Des
Moines and in the Eastern reaches of the state that are
airing the NARAL ad.</p>
<p>But in a state where, according to the Des Moines
Register's Iowa Poll, half the likely primary voters say
their decision will be shaped by the abortion issue, Mr.
Miller's lead has withered away. "Avenson wants this to
become a referendum on abortion," he complains.</p>
<p>Mr. Avenson is attempting to capitalize on the issue,
moreover, by portraying abortion rights as a symbol of
Iowans' independence and their reflexive distrust of
government. "People here are Iowa-stubborn," asserts Mr.
Avenson, who voted against requiring motorcycle riders to
wear helmets, who doesn't wear a seatbelt even though it is
required by law and who, barreling his van toward the pink
and purple horizon of the cornfields with a reporter the
other night, turned on a radar detector to avoid speed traps.
"We don't want to be told what to do."</p>
