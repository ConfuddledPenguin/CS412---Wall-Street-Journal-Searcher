	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Broad Inc. said fiscal second-quarter net
income rose 22% to $9.9 million, or 30 cents a share, as the
first profits from Broad's acquisition of Integrated
Resources Inc.'s core financial services businesses boosted
profit.
   Eli Broad, chairman and chief executive officer, said he
expects net for the year ending Sept. 30 to be in line with
analysts' estimates of $1.20 a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Broad based his projection on sharply reduced overhead
expenses as a result of the company's consolidating and
computerizing its back-office operations here and a higher
level of both investment and fee income on increased assets.
They include about $4 billion of annuity reserves and assets
under management acquired from Integrated in January.</p>
<p>"We're looking forward to continued revenue and profit
increases as all the things we've done in the last two years
come on line," said Mr. Broad. "We're just starting to get
the benefits."</p>
<p>The back-office operations will be completely computerized
by September, he said. Broad has spent about $15 million in
the past 18 months to install laser-imaging equipment that
"eliminates over 90% of the paper we have to handle."</p>
<p>The company's earnings in the period ended March 31
exceeded those of any quarter since Broad was transformed
into a financial-service concern in March 1989 through a
restructuring of the former Kaufman & Broad Inc. In 1989's
second quarter, Broad had net of $8.1 million, or 25 cents a
share.</p>
<p>Broad primarily sells tax-deferred, single premium
annuities. Annuity buyers pay the company a lump sum at
purchase in return for the company's repayment of principal
plus interest, usually at a much later date.</p>
<p>The company's operating profit before investment losses
rose 56%, to $13.1 million from $8.4 million; investment
losses were about $5.1 million, compared with $459,000. The
year-ago quarter included a $675,000 gain on the corporate
restructuring.</p>
<p>In the first half, net was $13.2 million, or 40 cents a
share, compared with a net loss of $11.2 million, or 37 cents
a share, a year earlier. The earlier result included $27
million in charges related to the restructuring.</p>
