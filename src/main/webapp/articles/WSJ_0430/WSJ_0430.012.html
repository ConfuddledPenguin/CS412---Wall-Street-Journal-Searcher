	<p class="article-leader">CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- Joe Slovo, the leader of the
South African Communist Party, was nearing the end of his
first speech on home soil in 27 years when, from the
multitude gathered at his feet, a voice cried out, "We love
you, Slovo."
   While Communist party leaders in the rest of the world are
beating a fast retreat, Mr. Slovo who went into exile in
1963, has made a triumphant return to South Africa. His
opening words to a "Welcome Home" rally here yesterday --
"Comrades, we are together at last" -- were greeted with wild
cheers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But Mr. Slovo didn't return so much as a prophet of Marx
as he did a fellow traveler in the struggle against the white
government and its policies of racial segregation known as
apartheid. Mr. Slovo is the highest-ranking white person in
the African National Congress, the mass-based black
liberation movement, and at one time he was the leader of the
ANC's exile-based armed wing. Now, he returns as one of the
11 ANC leaders who will engage the government in three days
of historic talks, beginning Wednesday, aimed at clearing the
way for negotiations on black-white power-sharing.</p>
<p>"We have come to talk to the government in the spirit of
conciliation," Mr. Slovo told the mass rally on a wind-swept
soccer field in a colored, or mixed-race, township outside of
Cape Town. An ANC flag fluttered to his right, a Communist
Party flag (a hammer and sickle within a red star) to his
left. "If there is a way forward without bloodshed," he said,
"we will grab it with both hands."</p>
<p>But, in so doing, the ANC isn't about to let go of its
demands for a new constitutional order. Mr. Slovo made it
clear that the ANC won't compromise on its bottom-line goals
of one-man, one-vote simple majority rule and a
redistribution of the country's wealth and land, which is
concentrated in white hands. The government opposes simple
majority rule, claiming that it would lead to black
domination (blacks outnumber whites more than five to one),
and it dismisses redistribution as "theft."</p>
<p>To get to those issues, though, both sides will first have
to create a climate suitable for constitutional talks. The
ANC demands that the government lift the four-year-old state
of emergency and release all political prisoners. Pretoria,
which legalized the ANC and the Communist Party in February
after a three-decade ban, insists the ANC give up its armed
struggle. Both sides say this week's talks may just be the
beginning of efforts to clear away the obstacles to real
negotiation.</p>
<p>In the three months since President F.W. de Klerk's moves
to free up the country's political activity, the level of
nationwide violence has soared. Protesters taking advantage
of the new opportunities have at times been met by strong
police resistance, particularly in the rural areas. The "Zulu
wars" in the Natal province, where the ANC and the more
conservative Zulu political movement known as Inkatha are
fighting for political supremacy, have intensified.</p>
<p>At the same time, the ANC and the government are under
pressure from their constituencies not to concede too much at
negotiations. The Pan Africanist Movement, which says blacks
should just seize power and not bother with negotiations,
accuses the ANC of selling out black interests and of
appeasing Pretoria. On the other hand, the virulent white
right wing accuses the government of surrendering white
interests to the blacks.</p>
<p>"We know negotiation is a question of give and take," Mr.
Slovo said. "But there is a limit to what one side gives and
what one side takes. This is the gap that needs to be closed
by dialogue."</p>
<p>Mr. Slovo's words, carried far by the strong winds, were
echoed by cries of "Viva" from the crowd. For years, the name
of this 64-year-old white man has been shouted in the same
breath as the names Nelson Mandela and Oliver Tambo, the
ANC's two paramount leaders. And, during the years of banning
and exile, the Communist Party's surge in popularity has
mirrored that of the ANC. "The enemy of our enemy is our
friend," said a young black man when asked why he was waving
a Communist Party flag. "Slovo," in big capital letters, was
emblazoned on a sticker plastered across the front of his
sweater.</p>
<p>In the white community, though, Mr. Slovo's return to
South Africa is causing more angst than the release of Mr.
Mandela from prison in February. Because he's white, Mr.
Slovo's actions have always seemed more treacherous, his
calls for black liberation more ominous. He, more so than Mr.
Mandela, has been the whites' most-feared bogeyman. And now
that he's back, many whites are studying him closely to
confirm their fears. When he flew into the country Friday,
the pro-government media jumped on the fact that he was
wearing red socks. No one chronicled what the black ANC
members were wearing.</p>
<p>The government is hoping that the events in Eastern Europe
will discredit Mr. Slovo and his party. But the stocky,
gray-haired lawyer, who was born in Lithuania, seems to be
adapting with the times. Once a hard-line Stalinist, Mr.
Slovo recently examined communism's shortcomings in an essay
entitled "Has Socialism Failed?" Yesterday, he warned Mr. de
Klerk that the tide of liberation sweeping across Eastern
Europe is also sweeping across South Africa. He praised the
role of the churches in the anti-apartheid struggle, calling
on "every good believer to become a witness for liberation."
He said the ANC has displayed "the Biblical patience of Job"
in its long battle against Pretoria. He embraced multiparty
democracy. He talked about redistributing wealth and hailed
the contribution of the working class, but he didn't rail
about economic nationalization.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, he said in private, socialism is still
his goal for South Africa. But, he added, first things first.</p>
<p>"When we left (South Africa) in 1963, the main slogan was
`Freedom in our lifetime,'" he said. "Today, our cry is
`Freedom now.'"</p>
