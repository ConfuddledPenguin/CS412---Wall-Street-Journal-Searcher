	<p class="article-leader">General Electric Co.'s aerospace division, responding to
defense spending cuts, said it will eliminate 4,200 jobs,
farm out production of standard parts and consolidate several
plants.
   Earlier this year, GE had said the defense cuts might
prompt it to eliminate as many as 10,000 jobs over the next
three years. The announcement Friday gave the first
indication of the diversified concern's extensive
restructuring plans.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The GE unit said it expects to lay off about half of the
4,200 workers. The rest will be absorbed in other GE
operations or their positions will be eliminated through
attrition and retirement.</p>
<p>"We're entering a decade that will provide a difficult
challenge for defense companies," said Jon Rittenhouse,
senior vice president of GE Aerospace in Valley Forge, Pa.
"In this difficult environment, only the most-efficient,
highest-quality manufacturers will survive and win."</p>
<p>Tassos Philippakos, an aerospace analyst at Moody's
Investors Service Inc., applauded GE's action. He said it was
the first such major move by a defense contractor.
"Unfortunately, the U.S. defense contractors are responding
slowly to the reality. That will definitely hurt their
profitability," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Philippakos said a major reason for most defense
contractors' slow response is that it isn't clear whose
programs are going to be axed. But if the companies don't
begin to make broad plans, many of them will find themselves
with excess capacity and other high fixed costs. "The
European defense industry is moving a lot faster. We're
seeing European companies consolidating their products and
forming consortiums," he said.</p>
<p>A GE Aerospace spokesman said that if the defense budget
continues to decline the way the division anticipates, "we
expect that some of the plants will be operating at 75% to
80% of capacity, or less." He said the cutbacks and
consolidation will eliminate the potentially unused capacity
of 20% to 25%, thus bringing the operations closer to full
capacity.</p>
<p>GE, which is based in Fairfield, Conn., said the 4,200
hourly and salaried jobs will be eliminated over the next 2
1/2 years in five locations: in Binghamton, Syracuse and
Utica in New York state, and in Camden and Moorestown in New
Jersey.</p>
<p>GE will purchase standard parts, such as printed wire
boards and cables, from outside suppliers. It said this would
allow the aerospace division to concentrate primarily on
final assembly, testing and systems integration, enabling it
to reduce inventory and overhead costs, as well as to cut
excess capacity. Currently, 70% of GE Aerospace's business is
devoted to final assembly and testing, and the rest to the
manufacture of parts.</p>
<p>GE also will consolidate its dozen plants that manufacture
advanced electronic parts into two centers. One center, which
will be located in Conklin, N.Y., will serve six businesses
in the New York and New England area. The other, for which GE
is considering Logan Township, N.J., as a site, will supply
six GE operations that are primarily in Pennsylvania and New
Jersey. These two centers will become operational in the
spring of 1991.</p>
<p>Separately, Lockheed Corp. said it will lay off 2,750
employees in its Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co. unit by
the end of June. Like GE, Lockheed cited the shrinking
defense budget, as well as its completion of several military
aircraft production programs.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the unit, based in Burbank, Calif., said
that of the layoffs, 2,000 will be in Southern California and
750 in Marietta, Ga. The layoffs will be "across the board"
and include manufacturing, finance, administrative and
clerical employees, the spokesman said. Supervisors will be
included, he said.</p>
<p>Lockheed Corp., based in Calabasas, Calif., is a military,
aerospace and electronics concern.</p>
