	<p class="article-leader">Midway Airlines, stung by high fuel costs, reported a
deeper-than-expected net loss of $22.9 million, or $2.39 a
share, for the first quarter.
   A year earlier, net income was $2.9 million, or 17 cents a
share. Revenue rose 34% to $157.2 million from $117.3
million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Chicago-based carrier said its bottom line is still
being affected by costs associated with the start-up of a
Philadelphia hub of operations. Midway has been expanding
service out of Philadelphia since November. Until then, its
only hub of operations was at Chicago's Midway Airport.</p>
<p>Last summer, Midway Chairman David Hinson cautioned that
it might take a year before the expansion in Philadelphia
contributes substantially to the company's earnings.</p>
<p>Although Midway didn't disclose how much its fuel costs
rose in the first quarter, many Wall Street analysts are
estimating that average prices surged 25% to 30% from a year
earlier. For that reason, most airlines have been reporting
losses for the first quarter.</p>
<p>Midway's first-quarter operating expenses rose 61% to
$183.3 million from $113.7 million the year earlier.</p>
