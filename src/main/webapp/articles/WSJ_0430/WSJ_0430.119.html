	<p class="article-leader">STOCKHOLM -- Sweden's Stora Kopparbergs Bergslags AB ended
weeks of intensive bargaining by capturing West German
pulp-and-paper giant Feldmuehle Nobel AG in the biggest
international takeover to date by a Scandinavian company.
   Stora and its two biggest owners -- Wallenberg group
holding companies AB Investor and AB Providentia -- said they
acquired 86% of Feldmuehle's shares outstanding and intend to
seek full control through a public tender offer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Stora and its allies paid an average price of 567 marks
($337) a share, valuing the whole of Feldmuehle at 3.97
billion marks ($2.36 billion). If the offer succeeds, Stora
expects to keep 75% of Feldmuehle with Investor and
Providentia holding 25%.</p>
<p>The transaction is subject to review by West Germany's
antitrust agency. But Stora's legal advisers said they don't
expect objections.</p>
<p>The acquisition would cement Stora's position as Europe's
biggest pulp-and-paper concern -- and vault the Swedish
concern to a position of global leadership. Stora claims the
expanded concern would be the world's biggest producer of
printing paper and market pulp -- and No. 4 world-wide in
overall pulp and paper capacity, trailing the U.S.'s Stone
Container Corp., but roughly equal with two other U.S.
concerns, Georgia-Pacific Corp. and International Paper Co.</p>
<p>"Consolidation among domestic forestry companies is nearly
finished in Sweden, Finland and the U.S.," said Stora's chief
executive officer, Bo Berggren. "Now we're seeing the same
process get under way on a global scale."</p>
