	<p class="article-leader">OMAHA, Neb. -- ConAgra Inc. said its ConAgra Grain Cos.
unit formed a joint venture with Consolidated Grain & Barge
Co., under which the two concerns will merge their barge and
tow-boat operations.
   ConAgra, a food company, said it will hold an 80% stake in
the newly formed company, Superior Barge Lines Inc. The new
company will combine ConAgra's 570 barges, which transport
grain from river terminals in the middle of the U.S. to
export grain elevators, with Consolidated Grain's
approximately 550 barges. Financial terms weren't disclosed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For ConAgra, the deal lifts its river-barge fleet from a
midsized concern to among the largest. For Consolidated --
which was acquired in 1988 by Japanese trading house C. Itoh
& Co. and Zen-Noh, a Japanese farm co-operative -- the
transaction appears designed to allay legal headaches over
ownership of the barge operations. A statute known as the
Jones Act sharply constrains foreign ownership of marine
assets, and some Consolidated Grain competitors had raised
that issue following the company's acquisition by the
Japanese buyers.</p>
<p>Consolidated Grain also operates some 40 U.S. grain
terminals; those operations aren't involved in the plan with
ConAgra. Consolidated Grain officials weren't available to
comment.</p>
