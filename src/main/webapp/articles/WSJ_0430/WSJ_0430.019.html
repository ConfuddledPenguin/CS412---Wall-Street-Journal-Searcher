	<p class="article-leader">MONTVALE, N.J. -- Mercedes-Benz of North America said it
is recalling 1,584 of its 300-Class luxury cars to replace an
electrical part in the engine cooling fan.
   The auto maker, a unit of Daimler-Benz AG, Stuttgart, West
Germany, said heat from the suspect part could cause its
plastic cover to melt and possibly burn when the auxiliary
fan is working at low speed. Three incidents of melting have
been reported, none involving accidents or injuries.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The cars being recalled are certain 1990-model 300E 2.6,
300E and 300E 4Matic sedans, 300TE and 300TE 4Matic station
wagons and 300CE coupes.</p>
<p>Mercedes-Benz said dealers will replace the problem part
with one that has a metal cover at no cost to customers.</p>
