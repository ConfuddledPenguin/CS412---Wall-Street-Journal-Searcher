	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- As the stock market eases back toward the
middle of the range that has confined it for four months,
many money managers continue to search for the potential
nuggets amid the dross.
   The two best-performing money managers of 1989 take
similar approaches, which they think are serving them well
while the market meanders.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Fred Moran, president of Moran Asset Management in
Greenwich, Conn., earned 55.6% on $500 million in 1989,
ranking first on CDA Technologies Inc.'s list of top money
managers. Morris Mark, president of Mark Asset Management,
New York, placed second with a return of 54.2% on the $375
million he currently manages.</p>
<p>Both are far behind last year's pace. Mr. Mark says he was
about even with the market's 3% decline in the first quarter,
while Mr. Moran says he "lagged a bit." As far ahead as they
care to peer, they aren't optimistic about the overall
market, but both assert confidence that their investment
styles will reap big rewards in one to two years.</p>
<p>Very important among the five or six things Mr. Moran
looks for in a company is cash flow, which is the money the
concern generates before interest expenses, taxes,
depreciation and amortization. Mr. Moran doesn't focus on
profits because, he says, "Earnings are distorted by
accounting techniques."</p>
<p>For example, "Let's say you have an asset that's growing
in value without capital needed to be invested. Accountants
are going to depreciate that asset" by deducting certain
amounts from earnings each year to reduce taxes. By contrast,
cash flow measures the raw earnings of a company's
operations.</p>
<p>Ironically, cash flow was one of the yardsticks used to
pick out possible takeover targets during that mania of a few
years ago. "Our reason has nothing to do with seeking or
anticipating a takeover," Mr. Moran insists. He says cash
flow gives him insight to a company's competitive position,
market share and the skill of management.</p>
<p>"Think of it in terms of bridges," Mr. Moran says. "We
want to buy a company that's like the Golden Gate Bridge or
the George Washington Bridge. Nobody can build a bridge next
door; the economics won't permit it." Carrying his analogy
further, Mr. Moran observes that the more traffic crossing
the bridge, the greater the cash flow from toll fees.</p>
<p>What kinds of companies are "bridges"? Mr. Moran names
telephone companies, such as Telephone & Data Systems; cable
television concerns, such as Comcast, and waste management
companies, such as Chambers Development.</p>
<p>Here's another: Telemundo Group, a New York-based
television producer specializing in Spanish programming. Some
of its shows are Desportes Del Mundo ("Wide World of
Sports"), Estrellas ("Stars"), and Cara a Cara ("Face to
Face"). Telemundo had an operating loss of $5.4 million in
1989, but Mr. Moran's research staff predicts a $1.3 million
profit this year. A.C. Nielsen & Co., the ratings firm, is
measuring Telemundo's audience this year for the first time.
Mr. Moran thinks it's bigger than many expect, which will
draw advertisers. "This one is going to be big," he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Mark looks at the "private market value" of a company,
another tool from the takeover era. He seeks to discern what
the working parts of a company are reasonably worth, and then
checks whether the stock price reflects that value. Strong
cash flow is also important for Mr. Mark, and he looks for
companies that distribute cash to shareholders through
dividend increases.</p>
<p>This year Mr. Mark added to his position in Home Depot, a
building materials and home improvement retailer that Mr.
Mark thinks can expand its franchise in coming years. "The
company is attractively valued on a private market basis," he
says. "It just seems to me that this is a very attractive
business that other people in retailing would love to own and
pay a huge premium for."</p>
<p>The stock is already up 24% this year and the ratio of the
current price to forecasts of per-share earnings over the
next 12 months is about 32, far above the P/E on the Dow
Jones Industrial Average last week of about 12. Even so, Mr.
Mark contends, "The current P/E, in relation to the growth
the company is likely to achieve, is modest."</p>
<p>Both managers chat frequently with managements of the
companies whose stocks they own. Last Thursday, for example,
Mr. Mark talked to officers of four companies, and Mr. Moran
spoke on the telephone with the chief executive officers of
six; on Wednesday, the chief operating officer of another
company came to his office. Keeping close tabs on a company
helps insulate the manager's portfolios from the destruction
of negative earnings surprises, they say.</p>
<p>Other than management and cash flow, Mr. Moran says the
companies whose stocks he owns must have "a healthy labor
situation," a strong competitive position and have most of
their operations in the U.S. In addition to signs of strong
future earnings growth, Mr. Mark likes companies whose
revenue is cash sales (as opposed to interest income, for
example), and have low debt levels.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>Stock prices fell in light trading dominated by several
rounds of futures-related selling.</p>
<p>The renewed weakness also came on the heels of the
first-quarter gross national product report, which was not as
strong as expected. Inflation rose more sharply than
forecast.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 31.53 to 2,645.05,
its lowest close since March 1. The 30-stock average had
rallied a total of 22.08 points in back-to-back gains
Wednesday and Thursday, rebounding from a five-session losing
streak.</p>
<p>Stocks showed little initial response to the news that GNP
rose during the first quarter at a 2.1% annual rate, below
the 2.7% rate forecast in a consensus estimate of economists
surveyed by Dow Jones. The report also showed that two
inflation measures based on GNP rose at annual rates of 5.7%
and 6.5% during the quarter. Both increases exceeded
forecasts.</p>
<p>New York Stock Exchange volume totaled 130,630,000. The
market's downturn was broad-based: 1,070 issues declined on
the Big Board while 403 advanced.</p>
<p>Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 3.81 to 329.11,
the New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 1.92 to
180.74 and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index dropped 3.52 to
306.60.</p>
<p>For the week, the Dow industrials fell 50.91 points, or
1.9%. The S&P 500 and the Big Board composite each dipped
1.8%, while the Dow Jones Equity Market index dropped 1.7%.</p>
<p>Citicorp fell 1/2 to 21 7/8 on volume of 1.8 million
shares after Standard & Poor's downgraded $30 billion of the
company's debt and preferred stock. The rating agency's
decision is expected to raise the cost of money for the bank
holding company and put increased pressure on Citicorp to
sell assets and issue new common shares.</p>
<p>Black & Decker skidded 2 3/8 to 13 3/4 on 1.4 million
shares. Goldman Sachs lowered its investment rating on the
stock in the wake of the company's first-quarter earnings
report. Separately, Black & Decker said it plans to
restructure certain debt and sell some of its receivables
later this year to reduce heavy interest expense.</p>
<p>Illinois Power, which fell 1 7/8 Thursday after a hearing
examiner recommended to Illinois utility regulators that the
company receive just $27.7 million of a requested $215.7
million rate increase, dropped another 1 to 15. Trading
volume of the stock amounted to 3.2 million shares, making it
the most active on the Big Board.</p>
<p>USX dropped 7/8 to 33 1/8 on 2.5 million shares, with most
of the volume stemming from one series of block trades
designed to capture its next quarterly dividend. The stock
carries a dividend yield of 4.2% and goes ex-dividend Monday.</p>
<p>Europe Fund, the latest in a growing number of closed-end
mutual funds that invest overseas, finished unchanged from
the price of its initial public offering at 15. Composite
volume totaled 1.1 million shares; a total of 7.25 million
were sold in the offering.</p>
<p>Marriott dropped 1 3/8 to 22 after Smith Barney and
Goldman Sachs lowered their earnings estimates for 1990. In a
meeting with analysts Thursday, the company said it was
comfortable with forecasts of $1.90 to $1.95 a share for the
year, compared with a previous range of $2 to $2.10 a share,
Smith Barney analyst Joseph Doyle told Dow Jones Professional
Investor Report.</p>
