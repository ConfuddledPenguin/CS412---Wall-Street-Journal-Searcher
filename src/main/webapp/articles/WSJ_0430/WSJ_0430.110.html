	<p class="article-leader">Computer makers are scrambling to cash in on people who
find the pen mightier than the keyboard.
   International Business Machines Corp., Apple Computer Inc.
and other big computer makers are staking out positions in
the nascent market for "note-pad computers," small machines
that let users enter data by writing rather than tapping
keys. The note pads typically recognize numbers and letters
printed on a screen with a special pen and convert them into
conventional electronic characters. The information is then
stored for later transfer to a personal computer or a
company's main computers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The size of the market for note-pad computers isn't clear,
but Infocorp, a Santa Clara, Calif., market-research firm,
estimates the market will grow to 3.4 million units sold in
1995 from 22,000 units this year. Only one company, Tandy
Corp.'s Grid Systems unit, currently sells note-pad computers
in the U.S.; its model, introduced last September, is priced
at $3,000. But new ventures are expected to introduce several
note-pad machines this year. And already, big computer makers
are fighting quietly for control over software standards for
these gadgets, which require different programs from those
used with keyboard computers.</p>
<p>"This is a group of people fundamentally worried about
their future," says Stewart Alsop, editor of PC Letter. "No
one wants to be left behind."</p>
<p>The early wrangling pits IBM, the world's largest computer
maker, against Microsoft Corp., the biggest supplier of
software for personal computers. In the 1980s, the two
companies teamed up to set a software standard for personal
computers called MS-DOS. Today, however, they appear to be
approaching note-pad computers on different paths.</p>
<p>Microsoft is determined to stay within the MS-DOS standard
for note-pad software. Though the company may be willing to
write applications for other standards, "I don't believe you
have to come up with a new operating system to succeed in
this business," says Jeff Raikes, who runs Microsoft's
word-processing division.</p>
<p>But in an apparent effort to set a different standard, IBM
has struck an alliance with Go Corp., a tiny Foster City,
Calif., company. Go is expected to introduce later this year
a note-pad computer incompatible with MS-DOS, the basic
software needed for most personal computers, including IBM's.
People close to the deal say IBM has agreed to license Go's
software for use in future note-pad computers of its own.</p>
<p>The standards battle is hard to handicap. Go has persuaded
some large software makers, including Borland International
Inc., to write applications that work with its operating
software. But Grid Systems chose Microsoft's MS-DOS for its
note-pad computer, and Software Publishing Corp. turned down
a request to produce programs for Go "because the last thing
we need is another operating system," says Fred Gibbons,
Software Publishing's chief executive officer.</p>
<p>U.S. companies tackle software issues in earnest because
software is an area where they hold an advantage over
Japanese competitors. Japanese companies, however, figure to
supply much of the basic hardware -- the displays, the screen
coating on which people write and the circuitry -- for
note-pad computers.</p>
<p>The new gadgets should help broaden acceptance of personal
computers in Japan, where the country's elaborate written
language has frustrated typists and forced many to maintain
handwritten records. In March, Sony became the first company
in Japan to sell a note pad that recognizes Japanese
characters.</p>
<p>Despite intense interest, note-pad computers aren't a sure
thing. They could become "an exotic flop" because of
restrictions on handwriting that may disappoint buyers
expecting the devices to recognize script or messy printing,
says Peter Teige, an analyst at Infocorp, the market-research
firm. For instance, Grid's note pad can only accurately
recognize clearly printed letters and numbers. That means
many users may have to modify their ordinary handwriting when
using the pad.</p>
<p>Such limitations are expected on a note pad from Go,
expected to be introduced later this year, and industry
officials expect subsequent models from other U.S.
manufacturers to require careful printing as well. "We won't
see cursive writing for anywhere from three to 15 years,"
says Vern Raburn, who last year founded Slate Corp., a
Scottsdale, Ariz., company that plans to produce software for
Go's computer.</p>
<p>For at least the next few years, note pads will function
most readily by contrasting clearly printed letters against
"static" images of letters stored in memory. An alternative
"dynamic" approach recognizes curves and connections between
letters, but because English writers exhibit idiosyncratic
styles, producing highly accurate systems is hard. Japanese
makers are using this more complex approach, but mainly
because Japanese people are more consistent in their
penmanship.</p>
<p>Besides technical concerns, there are serious questions
about whether the size of the market for note-pad computers
justifies all the effort. "It's an open question how much
someone is willing to modify their normal practice to use" a
note-pad computer, says Michael Swavely, president of Compaq
Computer Corp.'s North American operations. "Unfortunately,
the {computer} industry has a long history of promising more
than it can actually deliver. I think we're in that mode with
handwriting recognition."</p>
<p>Boosters of the devices, though, say that for a vast
number of workers, a note pad rather than a laptop computer
better suits their routine. Moreover, they say most people
find writing with a pen more natural than typing on a
keyboard.</p>
<p>At the very least, these gadgets should win a following
among mobile workers who now keep track of business on forms
attached to clipboards. To improve the accuracy of its
records, Best Foods Baking Group, a unit of CPC International
Inc., is starting to outfit its 1,500 delivery-truck drivers
with Grid Systems computers. The note-pad computers replace a
system of keeping records on paper forms.</p>
<p>Besides Best Foods, Grid has obtained large orders for its
note pad from Southern Pacific Transportation Co. and several
other companies. "This is a blue-collar computer, a computer
for truck drivers," says Alan Lefkof, Grid's president.</p>
<p>Handwriting aside, pens seem destined to leave their mark
on personal computers. Future models are likely to sport a
pen controlling some of the machine's functions; pointing at
spots on the screen will trigger operations much as clicking
a button on a mouse, or pointing device, works today.</p>
<p>Says Jean-Louis Gassee, Apple's chief of product
development: "The question isn't keyboards vs. pens," but how
they can complement each other.</p>
