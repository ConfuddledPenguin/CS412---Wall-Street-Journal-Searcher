	<p class="article-leader">DEARBORN, Mich. -- CMS Energy Corp. said the Midland
Cogeneration Venture will sell 200 megawatts of power to
Ontario Hydro, Canada's largest electric utility, from May
through September.
   A CMS spokesman described the transaction as the first
major sale for the Midland Cogeneration Venture, but he
wouldn't provide a dollar value for the deal. CMS is a
49%-owner of the Midland Cogeneration Venture.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Midland Cogeneration Venture was designed originally
as a nuclear power plant but was abandoned before completion
in 1984. The plant was reopened on March 16 as a gas-fired
plant.</p>
