	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Arnold Staloff, president and chief executive
officer of the Commodity Exchange, resigned on Friday after
only nine months on the job. His resignation is effective May
1.
   The Comex is the nation's fourth-largest futures exchange
and the biggest precious-metals marketplace. Mr. Staloff was
brought in from the Philadelphia Stock Exchange with
considerable fanfare because of his reputation as a developer
of new financial products such as the first foreign-currency
options and a computerized trading system.</p>

Chicago in the introduction of new futures products.</p>
