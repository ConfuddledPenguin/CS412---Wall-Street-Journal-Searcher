	<h3>Economy -- Tracking the Economy: Though Recession Is Nowhere in Sight, Data Don't Depict Clear Signs for Future</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">The economy is looking a lot better than it did late last
year, and a recession is nowhere in sight. Among analysts and
businessmen, however, the joy is somewhat restrained.
   One reason is that the economic statistics continue to be
good but not great. The widely watched purchasing managers'
index, to be reported tomorrow, is expected to decline
slightly. A general forecast is that the index, which
measures inventories, orders, employment and other factors at
manufacturing companies, will be about 48.5% for April.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While that will be above the average for the past nine
months, it will still be below the 50% level above which the
economy is judged to be expanding.</p>
<p>Along the same line, personal income for March, to be
reported this morning, is generally expected to rise by only
0.5%, down from a gain of 0.9% in February. According to the
economists at Morgan Stanley & Co., "A moderation in income
generation largely reflects a slower expansion of the key
wage earnings component -- driven by March's temporary
consolidation of employment growth."</p>
<p>Payroll employment expanded by only 26,000 in March, a
sharp decrease from prior months. The April number will be
released Friday, and analysts believe it bounced upward. But
the gain won't be as great as it may at first glance appear.
A general estimate is that payroll employment rose by about
300,000 last month, but this included 200,000 temporary
census workers. The economists at C.J. Lawrence Morgan
Grenfell note that the gain, deducting the census workers,
"would be a modest 100,000 as suggested by the decline in the
help-wanted ad index and the increase in unemployment
claims."</p>
<p>The weak employment number in March was accompanied by a
decline in the unemployment rate to 5.2% from 5.3%. But this
month's somewhat stronger job gain, most analysts believe,
will result in an unchanged jobless rate.</p>
<p>March construction expenditures, to be reported tomorrow,
are likely to decline. The economists at Morgan Stanley, who
look for a 2% drop, say, "A falloff in building activity
appears to be a virtual certainty following the
weather-distorted surge of 5% in the first two months of the
year. Declines should be concentrated in the nonresidential
sector."</p>
<p>The residential business, however, isn't exactly booming.
Analysts at Fuji Securities estimate that March sales of
single-family homes rose a modest 5.1%, keeping the sales
rate below last year's level.</p>
<p>Where is the economy actually going? The Commerce
Department puts together an index of leading indicators,
statistics that are expected to move up or down ahead of the
economy. The index will be reported on Wednesday. It fell in
February, but it is expected to rise in March. By how much? A
clutch of forecasts vary all the way from 0.3% to 1.5%.</p>
<p>A recession isn't out there, in other words, but it
remains to be seen just what the future holds.</p>
