	<p class="article-leader">Wang Laboratories Inc. reported a loss for its fiscal
third quarter, ended March 31, of $146.6 million, or 89 cents
a share, reflecting a number of one-time charges and
continued weakness in its computer sales.
   In the year-earlier quarter, the Lowell, Mass., concern
reported a loss of $63.7 million, or 39 cents a share. Wang's
third-quarter revenue fell 19% to $583.1 million from $721.4
million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Wang's B stock fell 25 cents to $4.50 Friday in American
Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
<p>Richard Miller, chairman and president, said that the
larger-than-expected setback reflected "increasingly
competitive industry conditions" and an internal
reorganization that disrupted sales and marketing during
January and February.</p>
<p>The one-time costs are related to the sale of certain
subsidiaries to raise cash and reduce debt. Wang said it had
completed the previously announced plan to sell its
international lease financing operations to General Electric
Capital Corp., a unit of General Electric Co., for $240
million. It also has agreed to sell two smaller units. It
said losses on the sales of the discontinued operations
amounted to $54.7 million.</p>
<p>Wang said that on a pretax basis, after eliminating
interest costs, its operating loss for the period was $57.4
million compared with $36.5 million in the year-earlier
period.</p>
<p>Mr. Miller said that completion of the subsidiary sales
will generate $285 million in cash, allowing the company to
cut bank debt to about $65 million, and eliminating $55
million in annual interest payments compared with last year.
He added that the company is "progressing in its turnaround
efforts," and hopes for "operating profitability in the year
beginning July 1."</p>
<p>Analysts said the widening sales decline is worrisome.
Barry Willman, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.,
said "while all the expense (cutting) steps are necessary,
the revenue will need to be stabilized in order to restore
sustained profitability."</p>
<p>For the nine months, Wang reported a loss of $219.2
million, or $1.33 a share, widened from a loss of $49.6
million, or 30 cents a share. Revenue fell 15% to $1.82
billion from $2.13 billion.</p>
