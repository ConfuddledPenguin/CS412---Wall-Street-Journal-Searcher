	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- College social problems, such as excessive
drinking and racial tension, reflect murky standards of
conduct and administrative ambivalence about enforcing the
rules that do exist, a new report on campus life concludes.
   The study by Ernest Boyer, president of the Carnegie
Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, comes amid
growing reports that colleges across the country are
struggling to deal with heavy student drinking, as well as
with increases in racial and ethnic slights, including
anti-semitism.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The idyllic vision so routinely portrayed in college
promotional materials often masks disturbing realities of
student life," the report contends. One reason is that "on
most campuses, expectations regarding the personal conduct of
students are ambiguous, at best," the report says. "What we
found particularly disturbing is the ambivalence college
administrators feel about their overall responsibility for
student behavior."</p>
<p>The report cites efforts to control drinking as one
example. The study was based in part on a survey of 382
college and university presidents conducted by the foundation
and the American Council on Education. In the survey, 67% of
the presidents rated alcohol abuse as a problem on their
campuses. Many college administrators say drinking
contributes to a number of campus problems, including
vandalism, crime and sexual harassment.</p>
<p>Yet many colleges don't take a firm stand against alcohol
use, even by minors. In part, that's because they would
rather have students drink on campus than force them to drink
off campus and then drive back.</p>
<p>"If state laws say alcohol use is illegal for those under
21, colleges should make this fact clearly known to students
and declare that they will support the law, rather than
ignore it," Mr. Boyer says, adding that students "need models
of integrity, not equivocation."</p>
<p>Many colleges are crafting firmer anti-drinking policies,
driven in part by several well-publicized drinking-related
deaths on campus and increasing fears of liability.</p>
<p>While Mr. Boyer praised these programs, his report,
entitled "Campus Life: In Search for Community," recommends
that colleges and universities adopt basic principles on
which to base their policies. The first principle, it
suggests, should be to pay more attention to education. He
notes with some despair that many students simply don't study
very much. According to one nationwide survey, only 23% of
college students study 16 or more hours a week.</p>
<p>Other principles stress the importance of discipline,
justice and open debate in campus communities.</p>
