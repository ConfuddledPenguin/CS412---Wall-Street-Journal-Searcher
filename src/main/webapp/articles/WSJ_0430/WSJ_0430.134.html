	<p class="article-leader">It's bad enough that Texans should claim that the first
Thanksgiving took place near El Paso 392 years ago today. Now
they want Massachusetts, home of the real Thanksgiving, to
agree.
   Last week, the Texas House of Representatives passed a
resolution declaring that "a site in present-day San Elizario
is the location of the first Thanksgiving celebration by
colonists in America." Then the Legislature resolved to send
the resolution to the Massachusetts house "as a formal
request that its members also" admit the first Thanksgiving
"occurred in Texas on April 30, 1598."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As they say in Massachusetts: Fat chance.</p>
<p>"That's about as likely as Texas proclaiming Massachusetts
the chili capital of the country," says Lawrence Alexander, a
state representative from Marblehead, Mass. "Texas may have
conceived a way to bring the Democrats and Republicans
together here."</p>
<p>The Pilgrims didn't get to Massachusetts until 1620, but
to Bay State eyes that just means whatever happened in Texas
wasn't really Thanksgiving. "The Pilgrims were never there,"
says a spokesman for Massachusetts' speaker of the house.
"They don't have a Plymouth Rock."</p>
<p>To be sure, the Texans do have some historical
justification. In 1598, Don Juan de Onate, a wealthy Mexican,
led some 400 colonists north across the desert, arriving at
the Rio Grande (then the Rio Bravo) on April 20. Ten days
later, they gathered for a feast and formally claimed the
land for Spain. For the past two years, the event has been
celebrated in El Paso with a reenactment on the last Sunday
in April.</p>
<p>Texas Rep. Nancy McDonald, a four-term legislator from El
Paso, sponsored the resolution with backing from the state
tourism industry, which sees firsts as potential boons.
Johnny Johnson, lobbyist for the Texas Travel Industry, a
trade group, says: "We have this Hispanic Catholic heritage
that sometimes has been overlooked. In 1598, a guy named
Onate had a priest conduct a service. I'm a Methodist
preacher's son, but I'm still impressed."</p>
<p>Ms. McDonald adds, "I wanted to put Texas out there where
it should be -- No. 1 with Thanksgiving, too." She adds,
"We're a pretty boastful state, so nobody found this
unusual."</p>
<p>There's one part of the history Texans don't boast about.
After the Thanksgiving, the Onate party packed up and headed
for what is now New Mexico.</p>
