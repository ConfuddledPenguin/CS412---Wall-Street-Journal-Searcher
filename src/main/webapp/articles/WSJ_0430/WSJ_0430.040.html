	<p class="article-leader">Vitronics Corp. expects to report first-quarter sales and
profit roughly even with year-earlier results, reflecting
continuing weakness in the U.S. electronics industry offset
by strong international demand, said Elliot M. Katzman, chief
financial officer.
   In the 1989 quarter, Vitronics posted net income of
$107,000, or three cents a share, on sales of $4.9 million.
Vitronics, based in Newmarket, N.H., makes automated
thermal-processing devices and other equipment used in the
manufacture of electronic circuit boards. The company is
expected to report earnings later this week.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Katzman added that the company "anticipates a strong
second half" following the recent introduction of a product
line that washes processing residues from circuit boards
without the use of chlorofluorocarbon solvents. CFCs, heavily
used in the electronics industry, are known to damage the
Earth's protective ozone layer.</p>
<p>Vitronics claims about 50% of the market for
thermal-processing machines. The line "continues to be very
profitable," Mr. Katzman said. But he said the company is
expanding investments in new lines, including the CFC-free
circuit board cleaning machines, and that those investments
squeezed profit margins during the first quarter.</p>
<p>John Walthausen, an analyst with First Albany Corp., says
the CFC-free technology "appears very promising" and that
Vitronics was one of the first with a CFC-free system
suitable for factory-line use. He said he was concerned that
backlog for the core product line was down some at Dec. 31
from a year earlier, reflecting slowness in the U.S.
business, but he called it "a temporary phenomenon."</p>
<p>Mr. Katzman said the company's international business was
strong during the quarter and now accounts for more than 40%
of total sales. Europe was the largest market, but the
company is considering an Asian facility to meet rising
demand in that region, he said.</p>
<p>Buyers of the company's core product line include most
major electronics firms, including Compaq Corp.,
International Business Machines Corp. and American Telephone
& Telegraph Co. A few customers, including AT&T and the
CalComp unit of Lockheed Corp., have bought the new CFC-free
board washers, and Vitronics so far has sold nine systems,
which range in price from $50,000 to $95,000, Mr. Katzman
said.</p>
<p>During the quarter, Vitronics announced the resignation of
co-founder and director George F. Soderberg and the buy-back
of his 7.5% stake in the company for $547,000 in cash and a
note. Mr. Soderberg is to continue as a consultant and signed
a non-compete agreement.</p>
<p>For all of 1989, Vitronics posted net income of $827,000,
or 20 cents a share, on record sales of $20.6 million. Net
income in 1988 was $528,000, or 13 cents a share, including a
one cent a share gain from tax loss carry-forward, on sales
of $16.5 million.</p>
