	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- A federal court judge here sentenced a
stockbroker and an investment manager to prison after their
conviction by a jury last month on 20 counts each of
securities, wire and bank fraud.
   Gina Loren, 53 years old, was sentenced to six years in
prison, followed by five years of probation. Daniel Burkhart,
43, was sentenced to four years in prison, followed by five
years of probation, said James R. Asperger, an assistant U.S.
attorney who prosecuted the case.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The two convicts collected about $4.1 million from 44
victims who were told that the funds would be held in a trust
secured by U.S. Treasury securities. Instead, the funds were
deposited -- and then withdrawn -- from an account at Bateman
Eichler, Hill Richards Inc. in Ventura, Calif., where Mr.
Burkhart, who lives in Camarillo, Calif., was employed as a
stockbroker.</p>
<p>Ms. Loren, who resides in Los Angeles and is also known as
Grace Horner, diverted large amounts of the funds to purchase
several luxury cars and a $1.6 million home in Orange, Calif.
Mr. Burkhart received about $66,000 in payments over a
three-month period for assisting Ms. Loren.</p>
<p>Officers at the brokerage firm alerted federal authorities
when they learned of the swindle, the U.S. attorney said. The
victims included a group of Catholic nuns in South Dakota and
retired military personnel.</p>
<p>Another participant in the scheme, Charles J. Lusin, 57,
previously pleaded guilty to one felony count of mail fraud
for assisting Ms. Loren by preparing certain documents. He
was sentenced March 26 to three years of probation and 300
hours of community service.</p>
<p>In an interview Friday, Mr. Lusin said he also voluntarily
gave up his license to practice law in California. He is now
unemployed and living in Temecula, Calif. An attorney for Mr.
Burkhart declined to comment on behalf of his client. Ms.
Loren and her attorney couldn't be reached.</p>
