	<div class="article-body"><p>The boss's fair-haired boy</p>
<p>Doesn't get there overnight;</p>
<p>It takes considerable work,</p>
<p>With things done exactly right.</p>
<p>One must be on constant call,</p>
<p>Showing diligence and flair,</p>
<p>And in time the fair-haired boy</p>
<p>Will most likely have gray hair.</p>

Why do the nurses wear masks when it's the cashier who
should?</p>
