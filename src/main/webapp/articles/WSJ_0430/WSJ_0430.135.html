	<p class="article-leader">A bankruptcy court confirmed the previously announced
revised reorganization plan for De Laurentiis Entertainment
Group Inc., a movie studio.
   The Los Angeles-based De Laurentiis concern revised the
plan in March as part of an agreement by Carolco Pictures
Inc. to acquire the company. De Laurentiis filed for creditor
protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code in
September 1988 after a string of box-office bombs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the plan, Carolco will acquire 49.9% of De
Laurentiis's common shares, and creditors will receive the
remainder along with cash and certain rights and warrants.
Because of certain preferred stock to be issued to Carolco as
part of the reorganization, Carolco will own from 60% to 70%
of shareholders equity in the new company.</p>
<p>Current shareholders of De Laurentiis will receive no
distribution under the plan.</p>
