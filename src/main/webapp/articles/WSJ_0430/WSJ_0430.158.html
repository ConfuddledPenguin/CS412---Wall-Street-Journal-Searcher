	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Seeking to avoid a game of chicken that could
wind up in bankruptcy court, Western Union has been meeting
with noteholders before a crisis is at hand. But despite the
company's efforts, it's beginning to look as if brinksmanship
may be the name of the game.
   Late Friday, Western Union filed a proposal that would
give holders of $530 million in notes a 21% stake in the
company's stock. Chairman Bennett S. LeBow's stake would be
cut to 32% from 46%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In an unusual twist, Western Union had carried on
extensive talks with noteholders before filing the
out-of-court exchange offer -- hoping to avoid the sort of
rejection that other troubled companies have recently gotten
from bondholders.</p>
<p>But there's no applause yet from the creditors' camp. Ken
Moelis, a Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette investment banker who
represents a group of noteholders, issued a terse statement,
saying that while the terms "definitely are not acceptable,
negotiations are continuing."</p>
<p>Robert J. Amman, Western Union chief executive officer,
says, "We are anxious to have a deal before June 15." Western
Union has a $51 million interest payment due on that date
that it might be unable to pay. "This company doesn't belong
in bankruptcy," Mr. Amman says. "Brinksmanship doesn't make
sense."</p>
<p>But privately, noteholders say the offer falls far short.
Of the detailed talks preceding Friday, one noteholder says:
"I'm not sure what purpose they served." Merrill Lynch's
Nathan Thorne, who represents Western Union, says the talks
did result in an agreement on basic structure. Now, he says,
"the negotiations will mostly be about how much of the
company noteholders should own."</p>
<p>Western Union's troubles are, in part, a legacy of Drexel
Burnham Lambert, the defunct junk bond powerhouse. In 1987,
when Mr. LeBow acquired control of Western Union, the company
issued $500 million in five-year, 16 1/2% senior secured
notes. Drexel, then at the height of its powers, designed a
"reset" feature to protect the notes' market value: the
coupon would be reset to any level necessary so that the
bonds would trade at their full face value.</p>
<p>But in practice, not even Drexel was able to get highly
troubled bonds to trade at par. Western Union got the worst
of both worlds: its coupon was raised to 19 1/4%, worsening
its cash squeeze, and the market value of its notes plunged.
The notes traded Friday at about 38 cents on the dollar.</p>
<p>Mr. LeBow was quoted in this column one year ago as
saying: "No one is going to lose a penny on those notes."
Noteholders now want to hold him to it. They say their aim is
to get the 16 1/2% return on investment promised in the
original notes.</p>
<p>Western Union says they will achieve this under its plan
-- if its stock goes to $5 a share by 1995. The stock now
trades at 56 cents.</p>
<p>Under the plan, each holder of a $1,000 note would get 150
shares of Western Union stock and a total of $1,000 face
value in two new notes. The new notes wouldn't pay or accrue
interest for two years, then they would pay an average rate
of interest of 8.2%.</p>
<p>One of the new notes would mature in 1992, the other in
1995. Western Union's preferred stock also would be converted
to common.</p>
<p>"Management has an incentive to take the noteholders out"
when the notes mature, "and that's what noteholders wanted,"
Mr. Amman says. The company could extend both of the new
notes -- but if it did so the noteholders' stake could rise
to as much as 53%.</p>
<p>Western Union's telex business has been mauled by the
growing use of facsimile transmission. Telex revenue last
year plunged to $140 million from $350 million in 1987. But
its other businesses -- a variety of electronic message and
money transfer and payment services -- are growing. Without a
debt restructuring, it projects a total of $79 million in
free cash flow -- far below its $217 million interest bill --
in 1990 and 1991.</p>
<p>The restructuring would get it over the hump. In 1992
Western Union projects that its money transfer and message
businesses would generate free cash flow of $109 million.
Interest would be only $56 million.</p>
<p>One item noteholders want to examine is the $2.4 million
in annual advisory fees that Western Union pays to Mr. LeBow
and his partner. And generally, one holder says, "the
proposal doesn't mesh with Western Union's rosy projections
for their business."</p>
<p>Mr. Amman counters that the point of the restructuring is
to move the company back from the edge of the cliff. "We want
to take the `troubled' out of our name," he says. "The
long-term outlook is positive, but we don't want to wind up
back where we are today."</p>
<p>Both sides have an ace card. The company says its money
transfer businesses might suffer in bankruptcy proceedings --
and thus, the noteholders won't push them that far. But
Western Union has no bank debt. Thus, noteholders would be
first in line in a bankruptcy. "We would lose in a
bankruptcy," one holder says, "but LeBow would lose more."</p>
