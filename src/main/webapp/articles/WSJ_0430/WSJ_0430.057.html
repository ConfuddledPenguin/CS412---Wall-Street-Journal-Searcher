	<p class="article-leader">CLEVELAND -- Ferro Corp. reported a 51% drop in
first-quarter net income to $6 million, or 26 cents a share,
from $12.4 million, or 60 cents a share, a year earlier,
mainly because of problems in Latin America.
   Sales rose 3%, to $279.7 million from $271.5 million. The
company previously said it expected to report an earnings
drop of more than 50% for the quarter.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Government measures to fight inflation in Brazil and
Argentina severely restricted economic activity in those
countries and drove up interest costs, Adolph Posnick,
chairman and chief executive officer, told the annual
meeting. As a result, Ferro had a first-quarter loss in Latin
America, he said.</p>
<p>Latin America is an important market for the producer of
specialty coatings, chemicals and plastics, providing 25% of
the company's 1989 profit.</p>
<p>In addition, lower U.S. auto and appliance production in
the first quarter cut into domestic earnings. And a French
chemical plant was shut down from January through March for
equipment modifications, he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Posnick said management is optimistic about the
outlook for the remainder of the year. However, he said it is
too early to forecast whether the company can earn enough in
the next three quarters to offset the slow start.</p>
<p>Brazil, which is Ferro's largest Latin American market,
will continue to be a drag on profit in the current quarter
and probably for several additional quarters, he indicated.</p>
<p>However, domestic demand has improved for a number of
Ferro's products, he said, and the company is benefiting from
cost-reduction efforts undertaken in the first quarter. The
French chemical plant is back in operation, and business
prospects in Europe are strong, he said. Europe provided 42%
of 1989 profit.</p>
<p>For all of 1989, Ferro earned $49.7 million, or $2.25 a
share, on sales of $1.08 billion.</p>
