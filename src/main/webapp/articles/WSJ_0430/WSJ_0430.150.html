	<p class="article-leader">Britain's secretary of state for trade and industry
ordered a review of the proposed tie-up between Grand
Metropolitan PLC and Elders IXL Ltd.'s brewing and retail
operations, expressing concern there may be "effects on
competition in the U.K. market for beer in terms of increased
concentration. . . ."
   The Monopolies and Mergers Commission, the competition
watchdog charged with making such investigations, was given
until Aug. 21 to complete the review.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under an elaborate agreement between the two companies
reached in March, Australian-based Elders is to pay #366
million ($597.9 million) for Grand Met's breweries, which
include local British beer brands Websters, Trumans, Ruddles,
Wilson and Ushers. Elders is also due to receive Grand Met's
local brewing and distribution rights to several non-British
brands, including Carlsberg and Budweiser.</p>
<p>At the same time, Grand Met, a British group that has
extensive interests in food products and restaurants as well
as brewing, agreed to merge its U.K. public houses (pubs)
with those controlled by Elders.</p>
