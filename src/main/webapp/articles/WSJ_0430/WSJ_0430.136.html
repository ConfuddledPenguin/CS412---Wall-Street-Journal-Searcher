	<p class="article-leader">Marubeni Corp., a major Japanese trading house, said it
plans to join Finland's state-owned oil company Neste Oy and
the West German steelmaker Thyssen AG in establishing a joint
oil refining company in East Germany.
   The three concerns agreed to conduct a feasibility study
with East German authorities, said Marubeni, which hopes to
sign a formal accord and establish the joint company next
year, and to complete construction of the refinery by 1994.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Initial plans call for creating the joint company to build
the refinery near Rostock harbor on the Baltic coast of East
Germany at a cost of about $1.2 billion, to process about
120,000 barrels of oil a day. This would be East Germany's
first facility for refining oil supplied by the West. East
Germany has depended on the Soviet Union for most of its oil
needs, but it is planning to diversify its sources of supply,
in view of the planned unification with West Germany,
Marubeni officials said.</p>
<p>The three companies have obtained approval from East
Germany and are seeking cooperation by West Germany in
financing the project, officials said.</p>
