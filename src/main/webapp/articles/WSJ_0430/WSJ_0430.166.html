	<p class="article-leader">Japan's prowess in translating new technologies into
commercially viable products and bringing those products to
the market fast has achieved legendary status throughout the
world. It is widely assumed that the root of Japan's superior
technological performance lies in the renowned Japanese work
ethic, popularly conjured up in the image of the obsequious
employee who keeps his nose to the grindstone day in and day
out. In reality, Japanese workers often contribute more to
the goals of their firms by looking around them and by
talking to one another.
   Japanese companies are continually assessing and
reassessing the status of their technology. Such evaluation
requires constant examination of the marketplace. The
critical question is: Are both the size of the market for the
proposed product and the product's expected profit margin
large enough to justify the research?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Based on my own research in Japan, top management rate
research projects in new technology every six months,
granting them one of three possible grades: Tops in the
world, at the same level as the leading players or lagging
behind. If the self-rating is "tops in the world," Japanese
companies don't merely rest on their laurels; management
pushes even harder to get the technology ready for a
marketable product in the appropriate time window. If the
technology is far superior to the competition's, the company
may even advance the date of introduction to gain greater
advantage in the marketplace. Last summer, Toshiba and
Hitachi both pushed up by more than six months their 4-MB
chip introductions after coming to such a conclusion.</p>
<p>If self-ratings are low, research management may decide to
upgrade the technology to bring it to the top level, or at
least to the average level, before they bring the product to
market. Or, if employees feel they are lagging too far behind
the best in the world, the firm may drop the research
altogether.</p>
<p>If they believe their research in a given area to be among
the world's best, Japanese firms will focus on patents to
protect their competitive position. "Patents First" seems to
be the motto of many Japanese firms, which often emphasize
patents and patentable research at the cost of basic
research. Although there are fewer lawyers overall than in
the U.S., Japan abounds in patent attorneys. In major
technology firms such as Toshiba, NEC and Hitachi, 8% to 10%
of the staff in research labs are patent attorneys and staff.</p>
<p>To rank themselves on any scale, companies must know what
it is they are ranking. To that end, Japanese researchers
interact with product designers, marketeers, and
manufacturing engineers to a much greater degree than is
common in the U.S. In Hitachi's labs, researchers meet with
marketing personnel at least once a month to determine the
"hot" projects. For more basic research projects, meetings
might take place every three to six months. For projects with
great patent potential, however, contact between the business
unit and research arm are more intensive. Management wants to
provide adequate funding and personnel to keep up with
schedules.</p>
<p>And despite what outsiders often conceive of as the rigid
structure of the Japanese corporation, these working
relationships bypass the normal hierarchy. Interaction is
lateral and personal. It is quite common to see the
researchers visiting the production facilities and the design
and marketing personnel visiting the labs.</p>
<p>In addition to the official visits, colleagues usually go
out together to bars. These after-work beer parties generally
contribute more to corporate goals than simply a sense of
camaraderie among colleagues. While researchers may gather
technology -- ranking information at professional
conferences, in meetings with peers at other companies or
universities, or just generally through the grapevine, it is
often easiest to do comparative studies over a couple of
beers at day's end.</p>
<p>Thanks to the camaraderie developed at such informal
communication channels, Japanese researchers get to know
their colleagues in the distant halls of their companies.
When a new project gets under way, the researcher knows which
design engineer or marketing person to contact about it, and
information sharing can begin right along with research.</p>
<p>Once there is general understanding of
product-introduction goals, Japanese companies continue to
rely on communication across departments for technology
transfer from lab to factory. Two often-used transfer modes
include the exchange not only of information but of personnel
between the labs and the business units. In a number of
projects I studied, management assigned the researcher to the
business unit on a short-term basis to get production
started. In others, the development engineer spent
considerable time with the research unit during the research
phase, long before the actual transfer occurred. Such
attention to technology transfer means that the business unit
will be ready to produce the product as soon as the research
is completed, with essentially no start-up problems.</p>
<p>U.S. industry rarely spends as much time keeping its ears
and eyes open for information regarding technology and
markets and the relationship between the two. Inadequate
attention to technological threats can lead to disasters like
"Polavision" (film-based instant movies). U.S. companies
should also scrutinize patent issues more intensely. With
global competition affecting the smallest of local
industries, firms must examine not only U.S. patents, but
patents in competing countries.</p>
<p>With regard to cross-corporate communication, some leading
U.S. firms already have achieved significant progress.
Perkin-Elmer, for example, has found that such interaction
between professionals has dramatically reduced the number of
engineering changes. Ultimately, close interaction between
personnel from different walks of corporate life may be the
most important factor. Just ask Intel. After discovering the
acceleration advantages of their GYAT ("Get Your Act
Together") meetings, which united manufacturing professionals
with design engineers once a week, the microchip giant
started an even broader program for its next product. They
dubbed it PDQ2 -- "Perfect Design Quality, Pretty Damn
Quick." Intel had learned its Japanese lesson.</p>
