	<p class="article-leader">DUBLIN -- The European Community embarked on a journey to
an unknown destination called "political union," hoping to
arrive by the end of 1992.
   At a summit meeting here, the 12 EC leaders agreed to seek
ways to create a more unified and efficient EC, with more
joint decision-making, greater democratic checks and balances
and a less cumbersome institutional structure. Though they
have radically different visions about how much national
sovereignty they are willing to transfer to a European
government, and how quickly, they agreed "further decisive
steps should be taken" toward a new EC structure.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Foreign ministers will spend the next two months
collecting and assessing ideas and definitions of political
union. The formal calling of the talks, which will run
parallel with already-called negotiations about economic and
monetary union, is expected to take place at another EC
summit here June 25 and 26. But the wording of Saturday's
summit communique leaves no doubt about an eventual calling
of negotiations once a clearer plan evolves.</p>
<p>"Today the Community firmly, decisively and categorically
committed itself to political union," said Irish Prime
Minister Charles Haughey, who chaired the meeting. "For that
purpose now, an intergovernmental conference will be held and
we will go on from there."</p>
<p>The leaders also agreed unanimously to a much quicker
timetable for economic and monetary union negotiations than
originally planned. They said they will try to finish the
talks, which start in December, and the process of national
ratification of the new treaty by the end of 1992, to
coincide with the completion of the EC's single-market
program. Even after the treaty is in place, it will take
several years to introduce a system of central banks or a
single currency; but the agreement on a deadline for the
talks was considered a major boost for supporters of the
plan. They also agreed to aim for a political union treaty to
come into force at the same time.</p>
<p>The agreements, issued in a 10-page joint communique, add
up to some of the most ambitious and detailed plans the
Community has ever set for itself. The summit not only set
out the EC's vision for its own future, but issued a
blueprint for the "New Europe" that is taking shape because
of reforms in the East bloc. Among some of the key points of
the agreement are the following:</p>
<p>German unification: The leaders welcomed East Germany into
the EC as part of a unified Germany and agreed on a policy
and procedure to manage the integration of that country's
territory and 16 million citizens into the legal and economic
structure of the Community. West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl said the EC Commission would be involved in the planning
and execution of the unification process to make sure German
monetary union and all other intra-German agreements are in
keeping with EC law and open to examination of the other EC
members. He reassured the poorer members of the EC that the
East German bailout won't rob them of limited regional
development funds, and said a revived East Germany would
beneift the whole EC.</p>
<p>Eastern Europe: Ever-deeper contacts with reforming
Eastern European countries will remain conditional on these
countries developing democratic, free-market systems. A new
set of association agreements, which define closer economic
and political ties, could result in eventual full membership
in the EC. It was agreed that aid provided by the Group of 24
industrialized nations to this region, currently being
coordinated by the EC Commission and limited to Poland and
Hungary, should be extended to East Germany (until its full
unification), Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and
Romania.</p>
<p>Relations with the U.S.: The leaders agreed to "further
develop close trans-Atlantic relations based on contacts at
the highest levels." This initiative, launched by EC
Commission President Jacques Delors and U.S. Secretary of
State James Baker, foresees twice-yearly meetings of the U.S.
president with the president of the EC council of ministers,
two meetings a year between the EC foreign ministers and the
U.S. secretary of state and high-level contacts between the
U.S. administration and the EC Commission.</p>
<p>A surprisingly positive tone and agreement by British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to go ahead with the
political talks reflects her belief that she will be able to
have a major influence on them.</p>
<p>According to senior British officials at the summit
meeting, she told the other leaders they needed to reassure
"worried" publics that what was about to happen wouldn't
threaten such things as national identity, national culture,
language, electoral or legal systems.</p>
<p>Officials of other countries at the meeting said they
agreed with many of the excluded items on Mrs. Thatcher's
list, and that by clarifying what political union is not,
Mrs. Thatcher probably had contributed to its ultimate
success. The EC won't scrap national parliaments or
presidents, and most expect the six monarchs of the EC to
keep their jobs.</p>
<p>Mrs. Thatcher also made some small steps in the direction
of the supporters of more ambitious interpretation of
political union. She said she would consider reducing the
veto rights of individual states in EC decisions, allowing
for quicker and more efficient progress on legislation. Such
procedures, already enshrined in the single market program,
had served British interests well, she said. She also said
she would consider changes in the treaty making it more clear
what powers should be given to the EC and what powers should
be reserved for the member states.</p>
<p>But Mr. Kohl said the EC states had to be prepared to
agree to more radical transformation of EC institutions,
parliaments and decision-making processes than Mrs. Thatcher
had in mind.</p>
