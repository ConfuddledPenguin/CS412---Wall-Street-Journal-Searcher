	<p class="article-leader">International Semi-Tech Microelectronics Inc., based in
Markham, Ontario, said it and a Malaysian partner called off
an agreement to buy Consumers Distributing Co. for 165
million Canadian dollars (US$142.1 million), because of
"serious deterioration" in the Provigo Inc. unit's balance
sheet.
   International Semi-Tech, a fast-growing merchandising,
manufacturing and electronics concern, said it and Berjaya
Corp. of Malaysia had begun an action in Ontario courts to
seek damages from Provigo, a Montreal-based food distributor.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Germain Lecours, chief financial officer of Provigo, said
the company "completely denies all the allegations" by
International Semi-Tech. He said Provigo regards the sale
agreement as still binding.</p>
<p>Provigo agreed in February to sell Consumers Distributing
to a partnership that is 19%-owned by International Semi-Tech
and 81%-owned by Berjaya, a holding company with interests in
manufacturing, retailing and gambling. The purchase was to
have closed today.</p>
<p>A spokesman for International Semi-Tech said that after
the agreement was reached, the partners received audited
statements for the year ended Jan. 27, showing Consumers
Distributing's balance sheet and operating results had
deteriorated sharply from the unaudited statements previously
supplied for the 11 months ended Dec. 31.</p>
<p>"I don't mean a little, I mean tremendous," he said of the
difference between the two sets of statements. He said
Consumers Distributing took "significant write-offs" in
January. He declined to elaborate.</p>
<p>Mr. Lecours of Provigo declined to discuss Consumer
Distributing's results. The wholly owned subsidiary is one of
three nonfood units that Provigo put up for sale in October,
after deciding to concentrate on its core grocery business.</p>
<p>The International Semi-Tech spokesman said the company and
its partner "would still love to buy" Consumers Distributing,
but for "a lot less" than agreed upon in February. He
declined to say what price they had in mind. He said the
partners' suit seeks the recovery of legal fees and expenses
related to the transaction. He said the amounts hadn't been
determined.</p>
<p>Consumers Distributing owns more than 200 stores, mostly
catalog showrooms, across Canada. The acquisition was seen as
establishing a North American outlet through which the
Malaysian tycoon Tan Chee Yion, who controls Berjaya, could
distribute consumer goods made by his Malaysia-based
companies.</p>
<p>International Semi-Tech beat Berjaya last year in a
bidding war for SSMC Inc., which made and distributed Singer
brand sewing machines and consumer products. The two
companies then made peace, with Berjaya becoming 21% owner of
International Semi-Tech's Hong Kong subsidiary, which now
owns the Singer name.</p>
<p>Consumers Distributing has been a drag on Provigo's
earnings. Provigo sold the subsidiary's 90-store U.S. unit to
International Semi-Tech's Hong Kong subsidiary last year for
US$40 million.</p>
