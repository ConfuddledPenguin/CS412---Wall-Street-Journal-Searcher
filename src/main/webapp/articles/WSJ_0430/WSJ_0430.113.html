	<p class="article-leader">HAWTHORNE, N.Y. -- The chess grandmaster sits on the
laboratory floor, quietly replaying variations on recent
games. Nearby perch his handlers, boasting of past and future
conquests.
   Although he has beaten some of the world's top players and
is touted to topple world champion Gary Kasparov, this player
never brags.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>He can't: He is less than two years old. And he is a
computer.</p>
<p>Known as Deep Thought, the silicon prodigy is the
offspring of five graduate students from Pittsburgh's
Carnegie Mellon University, long a cradle of artificial
intelligence -- AI, as its practitioners call it. The machine
also challenges the conventional wisdom in an overhyped field
that has long promised, but never delivered, computers that
can "outthink" their human creators.</p>
<p>Financed by International Business Machines Corp., Deep
Thought comes close to that goal. If IBM's claims prove out,
it will soon exceed the goal. But although it duplicates a
feat that humans generally deem intelligent, Deep Thought
doesn't know much -- and therein lies its significance.</p>
<p>Deep Thought uses custom-built circuits to sift through a
million possible board positions per second. In 18 months,
with better chess instincts and a specially designed set of
chips, IBM expects to have it considering one billion
possibilities a second.</p>
<p>This "brute force" approach to AI was largely abandoned 25
years ago in the belief that it is more efficient to beef up
a computer's knowledge than its speed. Now, Deep Thought and
its ilk are turning that approach on its head. Speedy
circuits look like a key to intelligent behavior -- and not
just in chess.</p>
<p>At Kurzweil Applied Intelligence Inc. in Waltham, Mass.,
AI pioneer Raymond Kurzweil calls computing horsepower the
magic ingredient that will enable his machines to understand
human speech. Students at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology have used brute force to help identify proteins
and control a robot arm. Carnegie Mellon researchers recently
found that special brute-force circuitry recognizes voice and
image patterns 10 to 100 times faster than traditional
methods.</p>
<p>"AI grew up in an era when machines were pretty puny,"
says David Waltz of Thinking Machines Inc., a Cambridge,
Mass., maker of special AI-oriented computers. "Powerful
machines like Deep Thought will make everyone re-evaluate
their assumptions."</p>
<p>Back in the lab, Deep Thought shows why -- as it follows a
match in progress halfway around the world, between former
world champion Anatoly Karpov and Dutch grandmaster Jan
Timman.</p>
<p>Murray Campbell, a Canadian programmer, keys in Mr.
Karpov's latest move. Faster than you can say "Indian
defense," Deep Thought zips through myriad versions of the
next few moves and isolates combinations that score for Mr.
Timman. Then, it tracks promising scenarios through as many
as 40 sets of moves and countermoves, narrowing its focus
through a process called "singular extension" until it finds
the best outcome. Twenty seconds later, Deep Thought's answer
pops up on a nearby screen. It's the same move Mr. Timman
chooses -- after several minutes.</p>
<p>"Some people say that brute-force searching isn't `real'
intelligence," muses Edward Fredkin, a computer-science guru
who has offered a $100,000 prize for the first machine to
beat the human world chess champion. "They might just as well
say that flying with an engine isn't real flying because that
isn't how birds do it."</p>
<p>Patrick Winston, the director of MIT's Artificial
Intelligence Laboratory, concurs. "It's misadvised to suppose
that intelligence will turn out to be one sort of thing," he
says. Using another nonstandard approach to AI, his
colleagues have built robots that aren't very smart but learn
to walk through a trial-and-error process that is eerily
lifelike.</p>
<p>Though limited in its applications, chess has long been
popular in AI circles because it illustrates a classic
trade-off between knowledge and processing power.</p>
<p>The average board position offers roughly 35 possible
moves; checking out just the next three moves and
countermoves involves looking at more than one billion
possible positions. Humans, of course, ignore almost all this
"search space" to concentrate on a minuscule number of moves,
the moves that seem promising.</p>
<p>During the mid-1960s, people became convinced that giving
computers a little knowledge -- telling a sock-finding
machine to ignore sweaters, for example -- would do just as
well as turbocharging them to search faster. Once the very
stuff of AI, searching fell into neglect while researchers
devised software to teach computers human feats such as
rule-following, learning, logic and inference.</p>
<p>Once that task was accomplished, they promised, computers
would outdo humans in many routine "intelligent" tasks --
guarding buildings, interpreting X-rays, summarizing
documents, steering ships. But progress toward these goals
has been painfully slow: Even the most sophisticated "expert
systems" stumble when faced with the unexpected and are
outperformed by well-trained humans. Nevertheless, many AI
researchers still believe that programming computers with
knowledge is the road to intelligence.</p>
<p>"Current machines are perfectly adequate," asserts Douglas
Lenat of Microelectronics & Computer Technology Corp., a
Texas research consortium. "The hardware solution is clearly
here. AI is almost completely a matter of software."</p>
<p>But this view never caught on in computer chess. Instead,
a handful of researchers continued to work on solutions that,
like Deep Thought, use massive number-crunching.</p>
<p>"There really haven't been many advances in computer chess
for a long time, except speed," says Ken Thompson, a
researcher at American Telephone & Telegraph Co.'s Bell
Laboratories and designer of the first chess computer to beat
a master-level player. "You put in the meat, crank the crank
and sausage comes out. People have tried other approaches,
but they always get beaten by brute force."</p>
<p>This pragmatism is echoed by the Carnegie Mellon team that
built Deep Thought, an extremely powerful machine that
conquered the chess world almost by accident. Like many
prodigies, Deep Thought had humble roots. His father was
little more a testing device for a specialized computer chip
designed by Feng Hsiung Hsu, a disheveled, Taiwan-born
computer-science graduate student. But "Chiptest" started
beating highly rated chess computers, Mr. Hsu recalls, "and
somehow we got ambitious."</p>
<p>With four other graduate students who had worked on
Chiptest, Mr. Hsu scrounged parts from other projects and
designed a machine that best used the team's limited chess
expertise. Built with only $5,000 of equipment, Deep Thought
was born in May 1988. Almost immediately, the Hsu team became
the frontrunner in the race to wrest the world chess title
away from Gary Kasparov with a computer.</p>
<p>Nearly two years later, Mr. Hsu sits below a board listing
Deep Thought's "scalps," including Bent Larsen, the first
grandmaster ever to be beaten by a computer; former U.S.
champion Robert Byrne, who writes on chess for the New York
Times; and former British champion Tony Miles.</p>
<p>On the U.S. Chess Federation scale, which is based on whom
you have managed to beat, Deep Thought is rated at 2,552 and
has performed lately at about 2,650, which would make him, if
human, a grandmaster. But he still is nearly 300 points below
Mr. Kasparov, who whipped him last October and recently
became the highest-rated player in history.</p>
<p>Even so, Deep Thought is good enough to stomp on all but
about 200 players world-wide. He recently gave Mr. Karpov,
Mr. Kasparov's perennial challenger, a scare during an
exhibition game in Boston. Deep Thought could have drawn that
game but threw away the opportunity by failing to realize
that sacrificing some pieces could have yielded long-term
benefits.</p>
<p>Such blind spots have taught the Deep Thought team that
they can't depend on brute force alone. Even checking a
million positions a second, Deep Thought's special hardware
usually looks only 10 moves and countermoves into the future.
Thus, it sometimes misses the long-range impact of his
choices.</p>
<p>Not that it is stupid: Along with special searching
techniques, Deep Thought is programmed with quite a bit of
chess knowledge. It knows, for example, that a piece usually
is worth more when it is in the center of the board. Right
now, it may use such knowledge to follow certain sequences
through as many as 40 sets of moves and countermoves; in the
future, this horizon will extend to 60 sets.</p>
<p>And soon, it will get another infusion of knowledge. Maxim
Dlugy, a grandmaster and one of the top 10 U.S. players, is
helping Mr. Campbell develop new opening strategies and
evaluation procedures. By year-end, Mr. Campbell says, Deep
Thought should be rated around 2,700.</p>
<p>But brute force will continue to be the machine's forte.
Mr. Hsu says a single next-generation chip will be five times
as fast as Deep Thought's current pair of chips and will have
a rating between 2,800 and 2,900. Hooking 1,000 of these
chips together will increase even that speed by a factor of
200. That's enough, in theory, to raise the machine's rating
to about 3,500 -- more than enough to challenge the common
wisdom about the trade-off between knowledge and search.</p>
<p>The new machine will cost IBM about $300,000 in equipment,
Mr. Hsu says, and will probably be different enough from Deep
Thought to merit a new name. (Leading candidate: Blue Chip.)
The souped-up hardware, he thinks, will make victory over Mr.
Kasparov all but inevitable.</p>
<p>More significant, Mr. Fredkin says, will be Deep Thought's
role in the overthrow of AI's 25-year software fixation.
"It's purely a matter of evolution," agrees Carnegie Mellon's
Raj Reddy, director of the university's robotics institute.</p>
<p>Within a few years, Mr. Reddy predicts, Deep Thought's
type of brute force will solve such mature AI problems as
computer vision, speech recognition, language understanding
and knowledge processing. Already, Carnegie Mellon has built
a car that drives itself by using television cameras for
eyes. Brute-force circuits process the visual information and
rapidly search video frames for threats and obstacles. If
researchers were to tackle the same task with conventional AI
software, Mr. Reddy says, the programming would take forever
-- and the car would probably move at a snail's pace.</p>
<p>At Mr. Kurzweil's firm, researchers found that computers
equipped with conventional AI can understand human speech
only if the speaker pauses between words. To understand
normal speech, as well as different accents and slurred
words, they must emulate Deep Thought and "throw a lot of
computer at it," Mr. Kurzweil says.</p>
<p>And Randal Moulic, who oversees IBM's Deep Thought team,
says brute force also will prove invaluable for huge
scheduling problems, such as those at airlines. Juggling
hundreds of planes among many destinations -- and lots of
gates at those destinations -- generates as many
possibilities as Deep Thought faces in chess.</p>
<p>Luckily, Deep Thought has proved that brute force is
relatively cheap. "We are talking about a world where someone
with a Cray (supercomputer) can get blown away by a few
graduate students from Carnegie Mellon," Mr. Moulic says.</p>
<p>Indeed, Hans Berliner, a leading Carnegie Mellon computer
scientist and inventor of a chess computer ranked second only
to Deep Thought, thinks that the government should try to
transfer the chess talents of specialized brute-force
circuitry to areas of national importance. Candidates for
such an approach, according to Mr. Berliner, are other
problems with large "search spaces." Molecular structure,
weather forecasting and human genetics top his list.</p>
<p>"If Mr. Hsu's chip were focused on some real-world problem
rather than chess, it would already be worth a fortune," he
says. "IBM isn't doing this for the fun of it."</p>
<p>But IBM's Deep Thought team members -- a third Carnegie
Mellonite, Thomas Anatharaman, has joined Messrs. Hsu and
Campbell at the company's Hawthorne facility -- say they
don't much care about debates in the AI world. They just want
to beat Mr. Kasparov. While visiting New York, the
27-year-old Soviet genius generously praises the progress
made by computers. But he is too cocky to believe a machine
will defeat him soon. "Chess is intuition, it's in your
head," he says. "How can a computer copy this process? Even I
don't know how I do it."</p>
<p>However, he worries that eventually a computer may triumph
by outlasting him and making fewer mistakes. The oldest he
wants to be when he next does battle, he says, is 30. "That
is the key in playing a computer, to be young and strong," he
explains. "The computer is always young and strong."</p>
<p>Mr. Kasparov says his next face-off with a computer --
probably the 1,000-chip version of Deep Thought -- will be
"the most exciting challenge I will face," and he talks of
defending the honor of the human race. But even if he loses,
he won't be impressed by the brute-force approach.</p>
<p>"I am not afraid to lose to such a computer," he says. "I
am more afraid of what people will lose by working only on
such computers. You could lose your soul with such a
computer."</p>
