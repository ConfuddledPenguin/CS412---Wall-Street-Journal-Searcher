	<p class="article-leader">OAKLAND, Calif. -- American President Cos. said it had a
first-quarter loss of $2.5 million, or 21 cents per share. It
earned $5.8 million, or 14 cents per share, in the
year-earlier period.
   The shipping and transportation concern said revenue in
the quarter ended April 6 increased 3%, to $587 million, from
$571 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company attributed the loss to an $11.2 million pretax
loss in its transportation operations, which had pretax
income of $7.9 million in the 1989 quarter.</p>
<p>Like other transport concerns, American blamed the loss on
increased fuel and equipment expenses and a decline in
margins at its freight-brokerage operation. The company also
cited competitive pressures in its Asia transportation
business.</p>
<p>The Asia operations, the company said, were a drain on
international revenue, but those operations still posted a 5%
increase in the quarter to $405 million, from $399 million, a
year earlier. Domestic revenue of $172 million was
essentially unchanged from the 1989 quarter, the company
said.</p>
<p>In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock
Exchange, the company closed at $23.375, down 50 cents.</p>
<p>Earnings also were affected by the sale of 48 acres,
resulting in pretax contribution of $6.8 million, compared
with $1.4 million in the first quarter of 1989.</p>
