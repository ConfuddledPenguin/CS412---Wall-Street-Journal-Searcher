	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Noranda Inc. reported that first-quarter
earnings fell 63% to 59 million Canadian dollars ($50.8
million), or 26 Canadian cents (22.4 cents) a share.
   The results compare with profit of C$158 million, or 82
Canadian cents, a year ago. Revenue rose 7.9% to C$2.45
billion from C$2.27 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The natural resource company said the high value of the
Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar, as well as high
interest rates in the latest quarter, reduced earnings by
about C$12 million.</p>
<p>The company reported reduced profits in its mining, forest
and manufacturing operations, though profits in its oil and
gas operations rose as a result of higher oil prices.</p>
<p>For the balance of the year, Noranda said earnings will
likely continue in line with those reported for the first
quarter. Alfred Powis, chairman and chief executive officer,
said he expects 1990 earnings of about C$1.05 a share, down
from 1989 net of C$2.19.</p>
<p>Mr. Powis said earnings will be depressed this year by
lower prices for nearly all of Noranda's products.</p>
<p>On the Toronto Stock Exchange Friday, Noranda closed at
C$18.375, down 25 Canadian cents.</p>
