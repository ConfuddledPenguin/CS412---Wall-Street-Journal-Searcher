	<p class="article-leader">Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi, Italy's state energy
conglomerate, said 1989 earnings rose 23% to 1.613 trillion
lire ($1.31 billion) from 1.31 trillion lire a year earlier.
   The results fell short of ENI's October estimate of 1.7
trillion lire in profit, partly because of disappointing
earnings in its chemical sector. ENI is composed of 278
operating companies with interests in oil exploration,
refining, distribution, engineering and services.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Revenue rose 11% to 36.467 trillion lire from 32.837
trillion lire.</p>
<p>Operating earnings rose 17% to 7.209 trillion lire in 1989
from 6.165 trillion lire in 1988. Pretax earnings rose 32% to
2.272 trillion lire from 1.723 trillion lire.</p>
<p>Net debt rose to 15.849 trillion lire at the end of 1989,
up from 14.513 trillion lire a year earlier. Net equity rose
to 14.516 trillion lire from 12.904 trillion lire, so the
debt-to-equity ratio eased to 1.09 at the end of 1989 from
1.12 a year earlier.</p>
<p>Cash flow rose to 5.624 trillion lire in 1989 from 4.973
trillion lire, covering nearly all investments, which last
year rose to 6.345 trillion lire from 5.859 trillion lire.</p>
