	<p class="article-leader">Over 160 cities and towns declared themselves
"nuclear-free zones" during the 1980s, but only Oakland,
Calif., tried to restrict the transit of nuclear material and
outlawed nuclear-weapons work within its borders. One physics
consultant was told he would have to move out of town to
comply. A federal judge has now struck down the law, saying
it interfered with the federal government's authority over
national defense. Oakland officials may appeal, but it looks
as if they are back under the U.S. nuclear umbrella whether
they like it or not.</p>
