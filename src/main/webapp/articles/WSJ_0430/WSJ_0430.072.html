	<p class="article-leader">To suggest ("Warring Couples Shun Divorce Mediators and
Opt to Battle It Out in Court Instead," March 27) that
divorce mediation has been shot down by lawyers because it
represents "a threat to their livelihoods" is unfair.
Generally, divorce lawyers in America are operating on
"overload" and would welcome any process that could relieve
them of some of their burdens and, at the same time, afford a
vent for the parties' anger and frustration.
   Divorce mediation reminds one of John Randolph of
Roanoke's comment, "It is like rotten mackerel by moonlight.
It shines and it stinks." Divorce mediation is terribly
attractive and seductive in concept, glistening out there on
an otherwise angry landscape of discontent, but as you get
closer it turns out to be somewhat odoriferous, or, at least,
not as attractive as initially perceived.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Unfortunately, the mediators are uneven in training and
often inexpert in application of their skills. Ofttimes they
create more problems than they solve. While I suppose it is
true that "there is a great deal of competition for the
family law dollar," one hopes that the money will be spent
for solutions that are more effective in operation albeit
less appealing in presentation.</p>
