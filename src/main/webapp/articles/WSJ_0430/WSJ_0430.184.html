	<p class="article-leader">HARTFORD, Conn. -- Aetna Life & Casualty Co.'s
first-quarter earnings rose 3.6% to $179.8 million, or $1.61
a share, reflecting improved results in its group insurance
and pension business.
   Yet results for the company's personal auto insurance
business were disappointing. James T. Lynn, Aetna's chairman,
blamed high loss costs and inadequate pricing. Its
auto/homeowners business posted earnings of $1 million,
including a net realized capital gains of $2 million,
compared with a loss of $4 million in the year-ago quarter.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At the company's annual meeting Friday, Ronald E. Compton,
Aetna's president, outlined various steps the insurer is
taking to improve profitability of its personal auto
insurance business.</p>
<p>Aetna has reduced agents' commissions on personal auto
insurance in many states. To lower expenses, it has
instituted stronger underwriting standards and improved its
claims-handling practices.</p>
<p>Mr. Compton said the company will invest its capital in
the auto insurance business "only in those states where the
regulatory and political climates permit us to earn adequate
returns on our investments." Already the company has cut back
some 15% to 20% in states where the auto insurance business
is considered unprofitable.</p>
<p>Earnings for Aetna's employee benefits group, which
includes group insurance and pensions, rose to $77 million,
from $42 million, in the 1989 first quarter.</p>
<p>Aetna's first-quarter results included net realized
capital gains of $20 million, or 18 cents a share, compared
with net gains of $21 million a year ago. Capital gains of
$23 million from the sale of the company's Australian
insurance operations were also included in first-quarter
results. Revenue rose 4.3% to $4.8 billion.</p>
