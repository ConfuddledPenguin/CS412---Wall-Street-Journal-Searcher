	<p class="article-leader">The nation's biggest securities firms are forming a joint
venture with leading bond brokers to distribute
government-securities price data 24 hours a day.
   The decision to create the new venture, which will
represent all 44 primary dealers and four of the major
so-called interbroker dealers, was announced at a Virginia
meeting of the Public Securities Association.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We are going to move very fast" and hope to launch the
service this summer, said William Brachfeld of Daiwa
Securities America Inc., chairman of a task force that
recommended forming the venture.</p>
<p>The New York-based PSA said the venture, as yet unnamed,
will negotiate to sell "real time" price data to several news
services and electronic information systems. These include
Telerate Inc., a subsidiary of Dow Jones & Co., which
publishes the Wall Street Journal; Reuters Holdings PLC;
Knight-Ridder Inc.; Bloomberg Financial Markets and
Associated Press.</p>
<p>Real time or "live" quotes would allow subscribers to see
prices as they occur. Securities firms once kept a close grip
on their own trading data. But the government has been
pressing them to make more price information widely available
in the market, and the value of each firm's knowledge has
diminished somewhat with the growth of the electronic data
suppliers. Round-the-clock quotes are feasible because the
bond market doesn't close, as the stock market does;
government bonds are traded globally from New York to Tokyo
to London.</p>
<p>A PSA spokesman said the price data wouldn't be
disseminated on an exclusive basis to a limited number of
vendors, but instead would be available to anyone willing to
pay for the service. Mr. Brachfeld said he could even
envision a tape of government bond prices running on the
Financial News Network.</p>
<p>A PSA spokesman said the venture should be up and running
in two or three months. One potential sticking point is how
the profits from the venture will be divided. To decide that,
the venture participants must first agree on who really owns
government bond price information -- the primary dealers who
buy and sell bonds or interdealer brokers who handle some of
those trades.</p>
<p>Primary dealers are an elite group of securities firms and
big banks that the Federal Reserve calls upon to buy and sell
government securities as part of its activities to regulate
monetary policy. These dealers can also bid to buy bonds
directly from the Treasury at government bond auctions.</p>
<p>Interdealer brokers execute so-called blind trades for
securities firms. (Although these brokers buy and sell bonds
for securities houses, they don't transact business with the
general public.)</p>
<p>Fran Bermanzohn, the PSA's general counsel, said the four
interdealer brokers that will participate in the new venture
are Fundamental Brokers Inc., RMJ Securities Corp., Liberty
Brokerage Inc. and Garban Ltd.</p>
<p>Mr. Brachfeld said the new venture won't prevent market
players from pursuing their own efforts to disseminate
government bond data. He cited in this regard the recently
reported plans of the so-called Group of Six securities firms
to distribute bond prices and other market information. That
venture, called Electronic Joint Venture, was formed by CS
First Boston Inc.'s First Boston Corp. unit, Goldman, Sachs &
Co., Morgan Stanley Group Inc.'s Morgan Stanley & Co.,
Salomon Inc.'s Salomon Brothers Inc., American Express Co.'s
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Citibank, a unit of Citicorp.</p>
<p>At the PSA meeting, all but one of the Group of Six firms,
Shearson, voted to allow the new joint venture to proceed.
The willingness of the Group of Six members to participate in
the PSA venture raises questions about the viability of the
Electronic Joint Venture. Officials at Electronic Joint
Venture couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>The new venture could also threaten the exclusivity of
several existing bond quotation services, such as the service
that provides "live" Cantor Fitzgerald quotes on Telerate
screens. Also, Merrill Lynch provides bond quotes to
Bloomberg. Cantor Fitzgerald, an interdealer broker,
abstained from Friday's PSA vote.</p>
<p>The General Accounting Office several years ago
recommended that information on government securities
brokers' screens be distributed more broadly, beyond the
primary dealers and aspiring primary dealers. The GAO said
market participants should be given a chance to do this
voluntarily before the government steps in. A new GAO report,
expected to be released soon, will note that voluntary
progress is still awaited. It is expected to recommend
government action to require broader dissemination of price
data if voluntary efforts don't reach fruition by a
"date-certain" deadline.</p>
<p>The PSA said it wouldn't be involved in the new business
venture, but would continue its consultative efforts to
encourage expanded dissemination of government securities
price information. "Our goal is to walk in the office Monday
morning and start the next step," said Ms. Bermanzohn.</p>
