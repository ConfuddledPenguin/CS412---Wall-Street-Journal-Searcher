	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- The French glass and building materials group
Cie. de Saint-Gobain S.A. said Friday that its West German
unit Vegla Vereinigte Glaswerke G.m.b.H. reached a joint
venture agreement with the East German glass monopoly VEB
Flachglas Kombinat Torgau.
   Saint-Gobain said in a communique that each group will
hold 50% of a new company to be created for the study of
possible joint ventures in the field of float glass, auto
glass and windows with a special focus on meeting demand that
is likely to arise from expansion by the West German auto
makers Volkswagenwerke AG in Zwickau, Adam Opel AG in
Eisenach and Daimler-Benz AG in Ludwigsfelde.</p>
