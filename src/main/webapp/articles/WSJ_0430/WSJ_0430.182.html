	<p class="article-leader">BLOOMFIELD HILLS, Mich. -- PHM Corp. said it hired former
top Chrysler Corp. executive Harold K. Sperlich as chairman
and chief executive officer, succeeding James Grosfeld, who
has retired.
   PHM, one of the nation's largest home builders, didn't
elaborate on the reasons for Mr. Grosfeld's retirement, which
was announced late Friday afternoon. The company said he will
remain on the company's board and act as co-chairman with
founder William J. Pulte of the board's executive committee.
He also will serve as a consultant to the company. PHM said
that it purchased 1,770,634 shares of PHM from Mr. Grosfeld
"at approximately market price." He will continue to hold
about three million shares, or about 13% of PHM's common
stock, the company said.</p>

<p>Mr. Sperlich, 60 years old, left his post as president of
Chrysler's automotive unit in January 1988 amid reports that
he had clashed with Chairman Lee A. Iacocca and other
executives over the 1987 acquisition of American Motors Corp.
and other issues.</p>
<p>While at Chrysler, Mr. Sperlich was credited with
masterminding the development of two critical products: The
front-wheel-drive "K-cars" that saved Chrysler in the early
1980s, and the hugely successful minivans that are central to
the company's profitability now. Since leaving the auto
maker, Mr. Sperlich has headed Sperlich & Associates, a
consulting firm. He joined PHM's board in July 1989.</p>
<p>PHM announced the change at the top in conjunction with
its first-quarter earnings, which rose 14% to $12.2 million,
or 46 cents a share, from $10.8 million, or 41 cents a share.
Revenue dropped nearly 12% to $238.7 million from $271
million.</p>
