	<p class="article-leader">ZEELAND, Mich. -- Herman Miller Inc., an office furniture
maker, said Richard H. Ruch, 60-year-old chief executive
officer, was elected to the additional post of president,
succeeding Edward R. Simon, 52.
   Mr. Simon said earlier this month that he was resigning to
"provide {Mr. Ruch} with an opportunity for further alignment
of the organization."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Philip J. Mercorella, 45, president of the Milcare Inc.
unit, was named senior vice president, global sales,
marketing and dealer distribution, succeeding David
Armstrong, 54, who is taking early retirement as senior vice
president, sales and marketing. The company said Mr.
Mercorella's post involves broader responsibilities than Mr.
Armstrong had. Mr. Mercorella will remain Milcare president
until a successor is named.</p>
