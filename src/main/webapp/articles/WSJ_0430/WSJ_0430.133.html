	<p class="article-leader">Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd., the maker of Subaru cars, said
Friday that it plans to cut its year-end dividend in half to
two yen (1.3 cents) a share for the fiscal year ended March
31 because of slumping sales and plunging profits.
   Company officials said the proposal to halve the dividend
will be submitted to a general shareholders' meeting
scheduled for late June.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the first half of the fiscal year, Fuji paid an interim
dividend of four yen, unchanged from a year earlier.</p>
<p>Officials said the Japanese company has decided to cut the
year-end dividend, as both sales and profits sagged from the
prior fiscal year. Profits, especially, will show a sharp
drop, they said.</p>
<p>During the fiscal year, officials said, car sales both in
the domestic market and overseas slipped below the prior
year's levels. The setback in the domestic market wasn't
especially serious, as demand remained high, but sales in the
U.S. showed a conspicuous decline, according to officials.</p>
