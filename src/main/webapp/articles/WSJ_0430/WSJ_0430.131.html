	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The federal government will spend $20.4
billion on computers, software and telecommunications
services in fiscal 1991, up 11% from the current fiscal year,
said Federal Sources Inc., a Vienna, Va., market-research
firm that tracks government spending.
   Federal Sources said increased spending at the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, the Internal Revenue Services and the Defense
Department accounted for much of the expected overall
increase. Civilian agencies represent 53% of the anticipated
spending, while the Pentagon accounts for the rest, the
consulting company estimated. The federal government
typically represents about 10% of the entire market for
so-called information technology.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>NASA is expected to increase its computer and
telecommunications spending to get ready for the deluge of
space-based data, including a project to study the Earth from
space. The FBI is increasing spending to update its
computerized criminal records. The IRS is enhancing several
computer systems that track taxpayer compliance.</p>
<p>Federal Sources said that Unisys Corp. was the leading
information-technology vendor in the federal market during
fiscal 1989, with sales of $590.1 million. American Telephone
& Telegraph Co. was second with $434.6 million, followed by
International Business Machines Corp. with $376.8 million.</p>
