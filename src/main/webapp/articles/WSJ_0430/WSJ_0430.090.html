	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo stocks finished higher in quiet trading Friday,
helped by investment trust buying of blue-chip electrical
shares, traders said.
   The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues, which lost 139.78
points Thursday, closed 160.22 points higher at 29584.80.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Volume on the first section reflected pre-holiday
sluggishness, estimated at only 480 million shares, down from
766 million shares Thursday.</p>
<p>Advancing issues outnumbered declining issues, 503 to 395,
while 198 remained unchanged.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index (Topix) of all issues listed
in the first section, which slipped 0.41 point Thursday,
added 5.86 points, or 0.27%, at 2205.96.</p>
<p>The second section index, which gained 6.89 points
Thursday, jumped 15.23 points, or 0.43%, to close at 3530.95.
Volume in the second section was nine million shares, up from
7.2 million Thursday.</p>
<p>Traders said that the most notable buying of the day came
from investment trust funds, which supported blue-chip
electrical shares toward the afternoon close.</p>
<p>The substantial rally in many of these high-priced issues
boosted the Nikkei index, they said.</p>
<p>But Christopher Leighton, manager of international equity
sales at Schroder Securities (Japan) Ltd., noted the advances
weren't sectorwide, as many electricals were hit by
profit-taking.</p>
<p>Moreover, many observers doubted the possibility that
index-linked buying of the Nikkei 225 issues was responsible
for the afternoon rise, saying that they would expect a
broader-based upward movement if that were the case.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, incentive-backed shares, particularly Osaka
Gas, were struck by a wave of selling in the afternoon. While
a company spokesman had said Thursday that its new materials,
which might be used in high-efficiency batteries, are still
in the experimental phase, the stock was heavily bought
Friday morning, only to be sold when investors' excitement
fizzled.</p>
<p>"These were really clobbered down, as investors were
obviously just looking for some quick money," said one trader
at a foreign brokerage firm.</p>
<p>"The market has been trading on stories rather than
fundamentals," said Kevin Haag, a trader in international
equity sales at Nomura Securities Co. "It's just a little
game for the market."</p>
<p>Investors are putting off big strategic positions and are
concentrating on speculative trading, which is fine as long
as the currency and bond markets hold up, Schroder's Mr.
Leighton said.</p>
<p>But the yen's weakness hasn't abated, and bond prices are
still under pressure, traders noted.</p>
<p>Kyocera ended 90 yen (57 cents) higher at 7,310 yen
($45.91), while Fanuc jumped 170 to 7,140.</p>
<p>Sony continued its recent strength, up 120 to 8,470. Sharp
was up 20 to 1,710, while TDK rose 40 to 6,880. Advantest
gained 50 to 5,150.</p>
<p>Hirose Electric rose 200 to 6,500, and Tokyo Electric
Power was up 50 to 4,140.</p>
<p>But Pioneer fell 20 to 5,960 and Fujitsu also fell 20, to
1,400.</p>
<p>The top story in the market Friday afternoon concerned
talk that Middle Eastern companies are considering buying a
stake in a Japanese oil refinery. Showa Shell soared on the
rumor and closed 90 higher at 1,150.</p>
<p>Investors lost their incentive to back Suzuki Motors,
which lost 79 to 931. Isuzu was also hit by profit-taking,
falling 40 to 1,100.</p>
<p>Osaka Gas ended 15 lower at 635.</p>
<p>Alps Electric, which reported worse-than-expected earnings
Thursday night, closed 180 lower at 2,040.</p>
<p>London share prices ended a second day of sharp losses in
light dealings Friday, pressured by overhanging economic and
political gloom, markdowns on the end of the three-week
trading account and a dearth of buyers.</p>
<p>"Market-makers didn't want to be stuck with any stock,"
one dealer said. "Sentiment is just as bad as it could be,"
he added.</p>
<p>Additionally, a poor performance on Wall Street added to
the market's woes. Wall Street and London were hurt by the
release of U.S. first-quarter figures for the gross national
product, which showed a lower-than-expected growth rate and a
higher-than-expected inflation measure.</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
finished down 27 points at 2106.6, slightly above its
intraday low of 2105 and greatly lower than its intraday high
of 2140.2, reached in the first hour of official trading.</p>
<p>At the close, the narrower FT 30 share index was down 17.4
points at 1658.7. Volume was 536.7 million shares compared
with 510.9 million a day earlier, a relatively healthy number
in light of the dismal trading volume during the past month.</p>
<p>In the futures market, the June FT-SE 100 index contract
finished at 2135.0, down from its close of 2156.0 Thursday.</p>
<p>Banking, property and insurance stocks were hit
particularly hard by the bearish tide, as negative statements
by Midland and Barclays banks earlier in the week and a
profit warning by construction company George Wimpey Friday
were poorly received, traders said.</p>
<p>Among bank shares, Barclays shed 7 pence (11 cents) to
500, Lloyds was off 2 to 250 and Midland sunk 8 to 279.</p>
<p>In the property sector, MEPC dove 2 to 479, Land
Securities skidded 14 to 465 and Hammerson lost 3 to 727.
George Wimpey slipped 8 to 227 after its bearish statement.</p>
<p>Composite insurers Commercial Union lost 12 to 447,
General Accident dropped 16 to #10 ($16.33) and Sun Alliance
shed a penny to 298.</p>
<p>Food and drinks group Grand Metropolitan plunged 16 to 554
after Britain's Monopolies and Mergers Commission said Friday
it would investigate the pending merger between the brewing
and beer retailing operations of Grand Met and Australia's
Elders.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, stock prices closed lower in Paris, Frankfurt,
Zurich, Amsterdam, Stockholm and Brussels, and higher in
Milan. South African gold stocks closed firmer.</p>
<p>Share prices declined in Hong Kong, Sydney, Wellington and
Manila, and were higher in Seoul and Taipei. Singapore was
closed.</p>
<p>Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.</p>
