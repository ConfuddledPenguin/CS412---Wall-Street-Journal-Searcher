	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Who are some of the biggest victims of the
junk bond market's collapse?
   Nobody can say for sure, but here's one particularly
noteworthy candidate: American Express Co.'s Shearson Lehman
Hutton Holdings Inc. unit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Earlier this month, Shearson announced it was bailing out
of $480 million of junk bond holdings -- taking a $115
million writedown in the process -- and ending a
spectacularly unsuccessful foray into the high-yield junk
market by the big securities firm.</p>
<p>The fiasco raises questions about management controls at
Shearson and the judgment of former chief executive officer
Peter A. Cohen, analysts say, and shows the pitfalls of
taking steep short-term market risks.</p>
<p>In early 1989, just as the junk bond market was reaching
its peak, Shearson and its money management subsidary, Boston
Co., made a big bet on the junk market. Boston Co. plunked
down $290 million to buy shares in seven junk-bond mutual
funds. And Shearson bought $190 million of individual junk
bond issues through an unusual "special purpose investment
subsidiary."</p>
<p>The big securities firm funded the long-term junk bonds --
which were then yielding well above 12% -- by issuing
short-term floating-rate paper with yields of less than 9%.</p>
<p>As Shearson saw it, "If I can gross 12% and pay 9%, that's
a return on assets equal to four times what I'm getting on my
normal business," says James Hanbury, an analyst at Wertheim
Schroder & Co. "It was a simple arbitrage play." Other
analysts called it more of a casino gamble.</p>
<p>Trouble is, Shearson's timing -- both buying and selling
-- probably couldn't have been worse.</p>
<p>A junk bond manager familiar with Boston Co.'s mutual-fund
purchases says that the buying largely occurred last spring
when the prices of many junk bonds were at their peak. "They
may not have hit the bottom {with their selling}," the
manager says. "But they couldn't have done much worse."</p>
<p>A Shearson spokesman says all the mutual fund shares were
sold this month, in addition to part of the individual junk
bond holdings. Shearson declined further comment about the
junk holdings.</p>
<p>Which funds were the beneficiaries of Boston Co.'s
largesse? A Boston Co. spokesman refuses to say but says none
of the money ended up in Shearson's own broker-sold mutual
funds.</p>
<p>Boston Co. put most, if not all, the money into no-load
funds, which don't charge upfront fees and are often sold
directly to investors by telephone and mail, and not through
brokers. "I'm sure they had some in Fidelity High Income, and
maybe some in T. Rowe Price and Vanguard," says the portfolio
manager familiar with the fund purchases.</p>
<p>Both Vanguard Group and T. Rowe Price Associates said
there would have been net inflows into their junk bond funds
in April, but for hefty redemptions by a single financial
institution, which they refused to identify. A Fidelity
Investments executive declined to comment.</p>
<p>Shearson has tried to blame the trip-up largely on its
former chairman Mr. Cohen, who resigned under pressure
earlier this year. A Shearson spokesman notes, for instance,
that the trades took place on Mr. Cohen's watch. Shearson
declined further comment.</p>
<p>But other top Shearson and American Express executives,
including current Shearson chief executive Howard L. Clark
Jr., clearly knew about the junk holdings -- or should have,
analysts say.</p>
<p>"It was a failure of management," says Mr. Hanbury, the
Wertheim Schroder analyst. "The buck has been passed about,
but the ultimate responsibility of the business still was
with {Peter} Cohen."</p>
<p>Mr. Cohen, who hasn't spoken to reporters since his
resignation, declined to comment.</p>
<p>Boston Co.'s decision to bet $290 million of its $5
billion investment portfolio may have reflected pressures at
the firm for short-term results. And, "You can't beat junk
bonds for short-term income," says a fund manager at a
competing Boston firm.</p>
<p>Shearson's $115 million charge against first-quarter
earnings were part of a massive $630 million restructuring
charge: $70 million in reserves were for the Boston Co. junk
portfolio, and $45 million went toward Shearson's special
purpose investment unit. All told for the quarter, Shearson
posted an industry-record loss of $915 million.</p>
<p>Although securities firms long have used special-purpose
units to buy mortgage-backed obligations, it's very unusual
for them to buy the more risky junk bonds. And, in Shearson's
case, says Wertheim Schroder's Mr. Hanbury: "It was a major
miscalculation."</p>
