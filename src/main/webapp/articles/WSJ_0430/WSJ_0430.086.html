	<p class="article-leader">Pennsylvania Gov. Robert P. Casey signed the nation's
toughest anti-takeover statute on Friday, just in time to
protect Armstrong World Industries Inc. against Canada's
Belzberg family in the proxy fight at Armstrong's annual
meeting this morning.
   Within minutes of the law's enactment, two lawsuits
challenging its constitutionality were filed in U.S. District
Court in Philadelphia, promising that the controversy over
the statute's provisions may not be over for months or even
years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"This law fundamentally alters the relationship between
the corporation and its shareholders," said Richard
Greenfield, an attorney for the plaintiffs in one of the
lawsuits. "Under this law, there is no way to attack
corporate decisions."</p>
<p>The new law, first introduced at Armstrong's behest to
fend off a possible bid by the Belzbergs, has four major
provisions designed to dissuade a takeover.</p>
<p>Most immediate to the Armstrong-Belzberg conflict, the law
would "disgorge" the profits of short-term shareholders who
sell within 18 months after a failed attempt to "control" a
company through a buy-out or proxy fight. The profits would
be turned over to the target company. The law also withholds
the voting rights of shareholders who control 20% or more of
a company's stock until "disinterested" shareholders agree to
restore their votes.</p>
<p>Another provision redefines the fiduciary duty of
directors, allowing them to base decisions not only on
shareholders' interests, but also on the interests of
employees, customers, suppliers and other "stakeholders."
Under the provision, directors would also be insulated from
most lawsuits by aggrieved stakeholders. Finally, the law
guarantees labor contracts and severance pay in the event of
a takeover.</p>
<p>Many states, such as Indiana, New York, Massachusetts and
Ohio, have some form of anti-takeover statute, and
Pennsylvania last adopted such protections two years ago. The
new law's backers, which include the state's business chamber
and largest labor unions, say that it will further dissuade
raiders from making runs at Pennsylvania companies and
attract even more companies to the state. Currently, only
about 4% of New York Stock Exchange firms are incorporated in
Pennsylvania, compared to nearly 50% for neighboring
Delaware.</p>
<p>But critics, including the Belzbergs, institutional
investors, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, say
that the new law so seriously infringes upon the rights of
shareholders that it will drive them away from Pennsylvania.
In any case, they argue, the law is probably
unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Indeed, two individual Armstrong shareholders filed a suit
against the company, its officers and state officials,
alleging that the law diminishes the value of their holdings
and deprives them of their constitutional rights. The
Belzbergs, who own 11.5% of Armstrong, filed a similar
lawsuit, seeking to block enforcement of the law,
particularly with respect to its battle today for four seats
on the board of Armstrong, a Lancaster, Pa., flooring and
building-products concern.</p>
<p>The suits say the statute conflicts with federal
securities laws, unduly burdens interstate commerce in
shares, curtails free-speech rights of shareholders,
interferes with contracts and violates property rights.</p>
<p>Legal scholars said the law is most vulnerable on
interstate commerce and supremacy grounds. The Supreme Court
has upheld the right of states to regulate internal corporate
affairs. "But who gets the gain on a transaction between two
non-Pennsylvania residents?" says Ronald Gilson, a Stanford
University law professor. "That is a transaction many states
would have an interest in," particularly for taxation
purposes.</p>
<p>In addition, the voting restrictions appear to conflict
with the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, which regulates
proxy contests.</p>
<p>But given the Supreme Court's recent support of
control-share voting limits and merger restrictions, the
outcome of the constitutional challenges is not clear, said
Gregg Jarrell, former chief economist of the SEC and a
finance professor at the University of Rochester. "The courts
have to give the benefit of the doubt to the state," he said.
"After all, the legislation passed almost unanimously."</p>
