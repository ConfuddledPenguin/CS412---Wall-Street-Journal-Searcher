	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The head of Manufacturers Hanover Corp.'s
branch network, William A. Buckingham, resigned to take a
similar position with Buffalo-based First Empire State Corp.
   Mr. Buckingham, 47 years old, is highly regarded within
Manufacturers, and his departure, according to bank
executives, was for "life-style reasons." Mr. Buckingham, an
executive vice president, and his wife are both from the
Buffalo region. Mr. Buckingham couldn't be reached.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In an internal bank memo, Vice Chairman Edward Miller said
he accepted Mr. Buckingham's resignation "with deepest
regret."</p>
<p>Since Manufacturers encountered some liquidity problems
following the failure of Continental Illinois Bank in the
early 1980s, Mr. Buckingham played an important role in
increasing the bank's consumer-deposit base.</p>
<p>Last year, Manufacturers' core deposits accounted for 25%
of net liabilities, up from 22% in 1988.</p>
<p>No successor has been named.</p>
