	<p class="article-leader">It's true that parents don't "get it" when it comes to
Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles ("Ninja Turtle Juggernaut
Demolishes Box Office Record," April 3). I get it -- in
spades. The Turtles are my parents' revenge for the Three
Stooges. Their antics consumed my every waking moment 31
years ago the way my four-year-old now lives and breathes
Cowabungas.
