	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Norton Co. expects net income to more than
triple in 1990 to $346.1 million as sales increase 4.6% to
$1.6 billion, according to a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
   The filing was made by Cie. de Saint Gobain S.A. in
connection with the French glassmaker's $1.9 billion, or $90
a share, tender offer for all of Norton's shares outstanding.
Norton, a Worchester, Mass., maker of abrasives, ceramics and
other products, agreed last week to be acquired by
Saint-Gobain.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The filing said Norton's projected 1990 net income figure
includes, among other things, a $249 million gain on the sale
of its Eastman Christensen operation. For 1989, Norton had
net of $105.1 million, or $5.02 a share, on sales of $1.53
billion.</p>
<p>To fund the acquisition, Saint-Gobain said it plans to
obtain $900 million through borrowings under a 1987 credit
facility with banks including Banque Nationale de Paris. A
further $600 million will be obtained through a 1988 facility
with banks including Chemical Bank, while the remainder of
the $1.9 billion purchase price will be taken from its
general corporate funds, the company said.</p>
<p>Saint-Gobain said it has agreed to pay its financial
adviser, Lazard Freres & Co., $6 million in connection with
the offer.</p>
