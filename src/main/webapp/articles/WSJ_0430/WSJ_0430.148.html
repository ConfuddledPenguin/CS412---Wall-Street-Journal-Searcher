	<p class="article-leader">Lincoln NC Realty Fund Inc., Palo Alto, Calif., said it
rejected an offer from Silverstone Partners, a closely held
Los Angeles partnership, because it viewed the proposal as
unfair.
   In a letter, Silverstone Partners offered to buy all of
Lincoln's common stock and warrants outstanding at $9.21875 a
share and 3.1 cents a warrant in a transaction valued at
about $19 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In composite trading Friday on the American Stock
Exchange, Lincoln fell 12.5 cents to $8.375.</p>
<p>Lincoln previously rebuffed Silverstone. In March, the
investment trust terminated a letter of agreement to be
acquired by Silverstone because Lincoln's banker couldn't
confirm the financial fairness of the deal.</p>
<p>Silverstone, which couldn't be reached to comment, holds
8.6% of Lincoln.</p>
