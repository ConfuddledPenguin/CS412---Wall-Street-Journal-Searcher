	<p class="article-leader">Gov. Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin signed legislation to
temporarily ban the commercial use and sale in the state of a
genetically engineered hormone that increases milk production
by dairy cows.
   The governor's action was claimed as a victory by
opponents of the hormone, who had argued that it would hurt
dairy farmers by causing a milk glut and forcing milk prices
lower.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But whether a temporary ban would delay the marketing of
the hormone for long remained unclear, since it still must
get marketing approval by the Food and Drug Administration
anyway.</p>
<p>For several manufacturers -- Monsanto Co., Eli Lilly &
Co., Upjohn Co. and American Cyanamid Co. -- the hormone is
the first potentially big product to emerge from agricultural
biotechnology. Some estimates of the world-wide market range
as high as $1 billion annually.</p>
<p>A Monsanto spokesman said, "We'll continue battling and
are confident that in the long run the product's merits will
carry the day."</p>
<p>Mr. Thompson approved a ban on the hormone, called bovine
growth hormone (BGH) or bovine somatotropin, until June 1,
1991. At the same time, he vetoed another measure that would
have extended the ban until July 1, 1991, or six months after
FDA approval, whichever came later. The FDA is expected to
approve BGH this year or next.</p>
<p>Whether to ban BGH has been a hot issue in Wisconsin for
several years. Mr. Thompson, a Republican who is up for
re-election in November, had indicated his opposition to
stronger bans but hadn't publicly disclosed until Friday how
he would respond to the latest bills to pass the state
legislature.</p>
<p>The governor said his action would provide "sufficient
time to allow for additional farmer and consumer education on
the use" of BGH "without compromising Wisconsin's ability to
compete" in milk markets.</p>
<p>Opponents of BGH have argued that any drop in milk prices
because of its use would particularly hurt small dairy
farmers. Among the opposition have been small-farm groups and
the Foundation on Economic Trends, which is headed by the
anti-biotechnology activist Jeremy Rifkin.</p>
<p>State Sen. Russ Feingold, a Democrat who sponsored
anti-BGH bills, called the product part of a "technological
treadmill" that is forcing small farmers out of business. In
addition to the economic issue, the opponents say, some
questions about the safety of BGH need more study.</p>
<p>The companies that developed the hormone maintain that its
use wouldn't favor big farmers over small, and that it
wouldn't disrupt the dairy-farm economy more than have
previous innovations, like artificial insemination. Farmers
in various states have volunteered to take part in BGH
trials.</p>
<p>As for safety, the companies note that FDA officials have
already said milk from BGH-treated cows is safe for human
consumption; continuing studies focus on the health effect on
dairy herds.</p>
<p>BGH, a protein that is nearly identical to a growth
hormone that cows produce naturally, is manufactured by
fermentation. The gene encoding the protein is inserted into
bacteria, which then produce the protein in quantity.
Injected into cows, BGH has boosted milk production 10% to
25%.</p>
<p>Opponents of BGH said the they expect the temporary ban in
Wisconsin to help their efforts in other leading dairy
states. For one thing, the Wisconsin law appears strong
enough to activate a one-year ban in Minnesota, which was
contingent on action in Wisconsin or other states.</p>
