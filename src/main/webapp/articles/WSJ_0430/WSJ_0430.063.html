	<p class="article-leader">Bank of Credit & Commerce International, which pleaded
guilty to money-laundering charges this year, is expected to
announce a huge loss for 1989, according to individuals close
to the Luxembourg-based bank.
   In addition, these individuals say, the bank will unveil
major changes in its management and ownership, including a
capital injection of well over $500 million from the ruler of
Abu Dhabi.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The bank, which has grown to almost $21 billion in assets
from $10 million at its founding in 1972, had an operating
profit of about $200 million in 1989, the same individuals
said. But the need to substantially increase provisions for
bad and doubtful loans -- following pressures from auditors
and regulators -- led to its 1989 loss, estimated to total
about $500 million. The changes, which could be announced as
early as today, also are said to include a sharp reduction in
staff and the possible closure of some offices world-wide.</p>
<p>The bank's capital, and its ability to make such huge
provisions, will, however, be bolstered by an infusion of
more than $500 million from Sheik Zayed al-Nahyan, president
of the United Arab Emirates and the ruler of Abu Dhabi. One
estimate has Sheik Zayed, who is already a major shareholder
in BCCI, injecting as much as $1 billion. Abu Dhabi, a big
oil producer, is the richest of the small sheikdoms on the
southern shore of the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>During a recent interview in London -- where BCCI has 45
branches -- bank representatives refused to discuss the
institution or its plans. But recently, company officials and
people close to the bank have indicated that they planned
major announcements that would transform it. Yesterday, bank
representatives couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>The massive infusion of capital -- made necessary by
losses from unsecured or poorly collateralized loans -- also
will be accompanied by substantial changes in the bank's
ownership. Sheik Zayed and the state-owned Abu Dhabi
Investment Authority, which the sheik and his family
effectively control, would become the bank's majority
shareholders, making the bank a government-owned institution.</p>
<p>BCCI, which is closely held, doesn't disclose its
ownership; its parent is a Luxembourg holding company, BCCI
Holdings (Luxembourg) S.A. But, according to recent reports,
and according to estimates based on interviews with several
people close to the bank, the bank is roughly 36%-owned by
Sheik Zayed and the Abu Dhabi investment agency. Khaled
Bin-Mahfouz, of the family that owns National Commercial Bank
of Saudi Arabia, is the next largest shareholder with about
20%.</p>
<p>In an apparent link with the U.S., BCCI has several common
shareholders with First American Bankshares, the
Washington-based bank holding company. Sheik Zayed, the ADIA
and Mr. Bin-Mahfouz are estimated to own close to one-third
or more of First American.</p>
<p>BCCI also is expected to name a new chairman to succeed
Hasan Abedi, the bank's founder and mentor who is an invalid
after a heart transplant in 1988. Meanwhile, Zafar Iqbal, who
is managing director and chief executive officer of BCCI's
unit in the UAE, would become co-president with Swaleh Naqvi,
BCCI's current acting president and chief executive. The two
presidents and three other appointees from Abu Dhabi would
form the bank's executive committee.</p>
<p>BCCI also will slash its staff as part of a restructuring
it has worked out with its shareholders and discussed with
its regulators in Luxembourg and London, according to people
close to the bank.</p>
<p>They said that the bank is taking a close look at its
far-flung branch network that now extends to 73 countries,
and that it is expected to close some offices. According to
one individual close to the bank, BCCI will close its Latin
American and Caribbean branches, and may even close up in the
U.S.</p>
<p>After BCCI earlier this year pleaded guilty in Tampa,
Fla., to charges that it had laundered more than $14 million
of drug money, state banking authorities in Florida have said
they won't renew its banking license there.</p>
<p>According to its annual report for 1988, BCCI's U.S.
assets totaled $390 million, a small part of overall assets
of $20.67 billion.</p>
<p>According to one drastic retrenchment plan that top
management has considered, BCCI would relocate its
headquarters to the United Arab Emirates and restructure
itself as an Abu Dhabi-based bank with most of its offices in
the Middle East, Africa and Asia.</p>
