	<p class="article-leader">There were hints over of the weekend of a possible
compromise in the standoff between Lithuania and Moscow along
lines suggested last week by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
and French President Francois Mitterrand. In an interview
with the Wall Street Journal's Edward McFadden conducted
before these developments, Gediminas Vagnorius, chairman of
the committee on economy of Lithuania's parliament, discussed
the standoff. Egidijus Klumbys, vice-chairman of the foreign
affairs committee, accompanied Mr. Vagnorius. The two were in
Brussels Saturday on a mission to win support in Europe for
Lithuanian independence. Andre Miknevicius translated. An
edited transcript:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>WSJ: What is the situation in your country?:</p>
<p>Due to the complete blockade by the Soviet Union many
people have now stopped working. Because oil, gas and goods
no longer arrive, the factories cannot work normally. We have
had to lay off doctors. They have nothing to heal their
patients with. We don't have basic drugs, even oxygen for
surgery is in short supply. There are no longer goods in the
shops.</p>
<p>WSJ: What are the prospects for a peaceful negotiation?:</p>
<p>Up to now, Lithuania has been doing everything it can to
start negotiations and Moscow has refused. We are open to
negotiating everything except the restoration of
independence. That would be like selling our mothers and our
fathers.</p>
<p>WSJ: From the Lithuanian point of view, what would be the
minimum acceptable outcome from negotiations?:</p>
<p>The legal recognition of the March 11 declaration of
independence. All the rest is negotiable in satisfying the
vital interests of Lithuania, but also satisfying what Mr.
Gorbachev considers to be the Soviet Union's vital interests.</p>
<p>WSJ: Do you think that you will gain your freedom
peacefully?:</p>
<p>Of course. We have no other way. We have no army, no
armored force. Lithuania will negotiate everything
peacefully. I was recently in the southern Caucasus republics
and there the situation is much more critical than in the
Baltic states because there they are of a mind to use force
and they have the means to do it. They have the natural
boundaries, and they have the temperament.</p>
<p>WSJ: Before you declared independence did you believe you
would get greater Western support than you have received?:</p>
<p>Almost all Western countries did not recognize the
annexation of the Baltic states to the Soviet Union. We were
convinced the Western states would be consistent with their
former position and would support an announcement of
restoration of our independence. Due to the very weak
position taken by the West, Moscow is feeling much more free
to do whatever it wants not only in Lithuania but in all the
republics and especially in the treatment of other democratic
forces in the Soviet Union. As you know the Soviet economic
situation is catastrophic. They are bankrupt. The position of
the West will influence the internal political actions which
Moscow will take.</p>
<p>WSJ: What would be appropriate measures for the West to
take?:</p>
<p>The West must accept the legality of the independence act.
I don't think the West understands the internal politics of
the Soviet Union. The West thinks that silence strengthens
the democratic forces but the exact opposite is true. If the
silence continues, you have to expect events very similar to
what happened in Romania. The difference is that you will
have assured the victory of the conservative forces in this
civil war.</p>
<p>It is a complete mistake for the Bush administration to
think that Mr. Gorbachev is representative of democratic
forces. Inside the Soviet Union, the democratic forces think
exactly the opposite. A month ago, Mr. Gorbachev appointed a
special board of advisers -- the most powerful body in the
Soviet Union -- and he picked nothing but conservatives.
There is not one democratic member on the board. From what we
have seen, it is clear that Mr. Gorbachev is legalizing his
dictatorship.</p>
<p>WSJ: If the West wanted to send aid in the form of fuel,
medicine, etc. does Lithuania control a port of entry?:</p>
<p>Nowadays, all the borders on sea and land are controlled
by not only the Red Army, but also the KGB army. They are
confiscating all the goods coming from other countries.
Moscow confiscated all the currencies that belong to the
Lithuanian factories and enterprises. This is due to the
centralized banking system of the Soviet economy. There are
two things that the Soviet Union will now openly dare to do:
First, armed intervention -- the use of force; second,
confiscating all the goods and humanitarian help that reaches
the borders from the West. We hope that this will become an
international scandal.</p>
<p>WSJ: Russia is withholding fuel from Lithuania, and
Lithuania food from parts of Russia. Which side will feel the
most pressure?:</p>
<p>We don't need anything from the Soviet Union. We just wish
that they would stop the blockade. Before World War II the
economy of Lithuania was completely Western-oriented. Our
standard of living was the same as Denmark. Look at where
Denmark is today, and look at us. Of course now we need the
commerce from the East and we would like to preserve this
commercial relationship and to develop it as I would our
relationship with other republics in the Soviet Union. I have
received a lot of offers from regional authorities, from
other cities in the Soviet Union -- Leningrad, Lvov, etc. --
to support Lithuania but because of the army, they can't.</p>
<p>WSJ: Do you agree with Mr. Gorbachev's view that Lithuania
owes the Soviet Union financially for its support the past 50
years?:</p>
<p>When the Soviet Union first occupied Lithuania, the
standard of living was much higher than in Russia. The output
and productivity gains of Lithuania during the 50-year period
were always higher than any other republic. Capital
investment put back into Lithuania was only the average of
what all the republics received, so clearly we received less
for what we produced. Between 1941 and 1952 we lost 15% of
our population, 300,000 people were forcibly deported to
Siberia to work outside of their homeland.</p>
<p>WSJ: So when it comes right down to it, you don't think
you owe them anything:</p>
<p>Right. We have been a Western country that has been
occupied for 50 years.</p>
<p>WSJ: How are the Lithuanians prepared to cope?:</p>
<p>It is very difficult to make plans because all the borders
are controlled by the KGB border guards. They can make a
crackdown with blood at any time and we are trying to break
the blockade by any peaceful means available. We are also
here to try to get very urgent humanitarian aid.</p>
<p>WSJ: Do you really think that the KGB will let this
humanitarian aid in after letting nothing else in so far?:</p>
<p>We must try. If the KGB confiscates these goods and
humanitarian aid, then it will be a shame not only for the
Soviet Union but also for all the Western countries. The
physicians have no medicine, we especially need the medicine.
As soon as we can, we are trying to convert all of the
internal production to try to produce some of the goods being
held out by the blockade. I think you should understand that
the blockade is not only keeping things out, but there is an
internal blockade as well. All the internal traffic,
especially on the railways and roads is blocked. If our
conversion is to succeed, our first goal is to get petrol. We
have some reserves, but not much.</p>
<p>WSJ: And the general public is willing to sacrifice like
this? What would happen if two weeks from now, the people
said, "Enough. We can't take this any more"?:</p>
<p>That is a statement that will only be issued by Moscow,
not by the Lithuanian people. The day before this delegation
came here, we received over a thousand phone calls saying,
"`Please hold your position. We are ready to support
everything." Please take into account that this is not a
struggle that just started on March 11. This is a struggle of
50 years. And as deep as the pressure is from Moscow, so is
the determination of the Lithuanian people.</p>
<p>WSJ: We have received reports that officials from
Lithuania's government are being sent out of the country to
form an international network, in case there is a serious
crackdown and the independence movement is struck down:</p>
<p>Powers have been given to some of the former ambassadors
who were in place before World War II to continue to do
everything that is suitable to regain independence for
Lithuania. But no new leaders are involved. We have a
government-in-exile set up in case Lithuania is annexed a
second time or the West recognizes the first annexation,
which in fact is what they are doing right now.</p>
<p>WSJ: If you could speak directly to Mr. Bush and the
American people, what would you say?:</p>
<p>Mr. Bush, the stability of the Eastern nations is in your
hands. Please be careful.</p>
