	<p class="article-leader">COSTA MESA, Calif. -- Archive Corp. said it completed its
previously announced acquisition of San Diego-based Cipher
Data Products Corp. for $8.25 a share, or about $120 million.
   Both companies make computer-tape drives, the backup
data-storage devices for computers. Archive also said it
borrowed $140.2 million under its credit line with Barclays
Bank. The funds will repay loans made by Barclays to purchase
Cipher shares, will go toward the costs and fees related to
the transaction, and will be used for additional working
capital, the company said.</p>
