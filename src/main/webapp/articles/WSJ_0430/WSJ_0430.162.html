	<p class="article-leader">Pinnacle West Capital Corp., Phoenix, Ariz., said it
agreed to sell its Malapai Resources Co. uranium mining unit
to an affiliate of Electricite de France of Paris. The cash
price wasn't disclosed.
   Pinnacle West, parent of Arizona Public Service Co., the
state's largest electric utility, said in January it had put
Malapai up for sale. Proceeds will be used to cut Pinnacle
West debt of about $1.1 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Malapai had total equity and liabilities of $86.4 million
at Dec. 31, Pinnacle West said, and expects a $36.6 million
pretax loss for the 18 months ending June 30.</p>
<p>Pinnacle West said Electricite de France is the only
electric utility company in France, where about 75% of all
electric power is nuclear-generated. Malapai, which mines
uranium for nuclear plants, would be operated by Total
Minerals Corp., a unit of Total Cie. Francaise des Petroles,
under a separate pact between Total and the Electricite de
France affiliate, which is in formation. The sale is subject
to a definitive agreement and regulatory approvals. Pinnacle
West said it hopes the deal can be completed by the end of
June.</p>
