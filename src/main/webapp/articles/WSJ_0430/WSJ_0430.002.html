	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The U.S. expanded the trade benefits it
gives to developing nations -- especially to Mexico --
following an annual review of the so-called Generalized
System of Preferences.
   The GSP, a system of tariff reductions and quota increases
designed to benefit developing countries, will now cover
goods from developing countries that had a total of nearly
$2.4 billion of U.S. imports in 1989.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The moves will particularly help Mexico, which the White
House Trade Office termed "the major beneficiary of this
year's decisions." Mexican goods valued at $1.97 billion in
1989 will be provided new, restored, or expanded GSP
eligibility, the trade office said.</p>
<p>The Bush administration has been trying hard to help
Mexico, which has shown more commitment to economic policy
changes than most other Latin American countries. The
Mexicans also are trying to work their way out of a
formidable foreign debt problem, and were the first country
to negotiate a package that includes cuts in bank debt and
interest payments under the Bush administration's
international debt strategy.</p>
<p>The administration had the room to expand the GSP program
because of the graduation from the program of Taiwan,
Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea on Jan. 1, 1989.
Countries graduate from the GSP program when they reach a
certain stage of economic development. The Andean nations
also benefited from this year's review: Goods that totaled
$44.3 million in U.S. imports from Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador
and Peru will soon be given duty-free status.</p>
<p>The administration also is delaying until June 1 GSP
decisions on eligible Brazilian goods totaling $517 million
in annual trade. By that date, President Fernando Collor de
Mello, who took office in March, will have instituted trade
and economic reforms, the White House Trade Office said.</p>
