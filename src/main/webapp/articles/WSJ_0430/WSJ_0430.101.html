	<p class="article-leader">General Motors Corp. and National Broadcasting Co. are
negotiating a massive media package in which GM would spend
well in excess of $500 million over three years at the
nation's No. 1 prime-time network.
   NBC and GM officials refused to comment. But executives
familiar with the negotiations said the package would be
substantially more than $500 million and perhaps close to $1
billion, depending on certain conditions. It would include ad
time during prime-time programming and National Football
League games, as well as time on NBC's fledgling CNBC cable
network and its Sports Channel America cable network. The
executives said that, barring last-minute complications, the
deal should be announced this week.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Other advertisers have negotiated packages with networks
before. General Electric's NBC unit and American Home
Products crafted a three-year package several years ago, for
example, while ESPN last week announced a five-year, $100
million deal with Anheuser-Busch.</p>
<p>But the huge NBC-GM deal would dwarf all of them. If the
deal goes through, GM -- among the nation's largest TV
advertisers -- would spend more at NBC than at any other
network. The big auto maker most likely would continue
spending at its usual levels at ABC and CBS, but spending at
those two networks could be negatively affected in certain
cases. If GM were to cut its ad budget, for example, or if it
were to shift some of its budget away from network television
and into local or magazinead spending, those cuts would come
from ABC and CBS, not from NBC, executives close to the talks
said.</p>
<p>The proposed deal would give GM tremendous power in the
network prime-time arena and allow it to dominate its
automotive competitors on the top-rated network. It would
give GM first dibs -- apparently at attractive prices -- on
the most desirable prime-time and sports programming,
according to the executives. GM would also be able to lock
out or severely restrict its competitors from some of the
hottest prime-time shows; prime-time programs allot only a
certain number of commercial spots to auto makers and GM
apparently would be able to grab up many of those slots
before its rivals had a chance.</p>
<p>The executives said GM's spending commitment is flexible,
with both GM and NBC having options each year of the
contract. Although GM would be required to spend a minimum
amount over the three years, it would be protected somewhat
if NBC's ratings plummet: NBC would guarantee certain
audience sizes -- as the networks often do -- and would make
up for any shortfalls with additional commercial time, the
executives said.</p>
<p>The package would involve a number of other complex
provisions designed to give both NBC and GM some flexibility.
NBC can set limits on how much of its best inventory is sold
to GM; for example, if it comes up with another hit as big as
"The Cosby Show," it wouldn't be forced to sell all of the
show's ad time to GM at below-market prices, the executives
said. GM, for its part, could be flexible in how it uses the
commercial time; rather than buying ads scattered across many
shows, it could opt to become a major sponsor of several "big
event" shows.</p>
<p>The proposed deal is sure to have a substantial ripple
effect across the ad business, and could affect coming price
negotiations for the fall season. Those so-called upfront
negotiations typically begin in June. NBC clearly hopes that,
by selling such a big chunk of its ad time before
negotiations begin, it will boost prices as other advertisers
scramble to buy what's left. Meanwhile, other advertisers are
sure to rush to calculate just what sort of prices GM would
be paying as they prepare to negotiate prices themselves.</p>
<p>The proposed deal would pair two market leaders. General
Motors is consistently ranked as one of the country's largest
two or three advertisers, spending in excess of $1 billion a
year across various media. Last year, according to ad
industry executives, it was the largest advertiser on
prime-time TV as well as on sports programming. Its size
makes it one of the most influential advertisers in the
country, along with fellow giants Philip Morris -- including
its Kraft General Foods -- and Procter & Gamble.</p>
<p>By negotiating the three-year package, GM may be reacting
to last year, when network prices soared largely because of
strong demand by car companies -- especially GM. If the deal
goes through, GM wouldn't face that sort of uncertainty. It
would be protecting itself against major price hikes like
those last year.</p>
<p>GM has been negotiating the package along with its two
major ad agencies, Leo  Burnett, which handles GM's
Oldsmobile division, and Interpublic Group's Lintas agency,
which creates ads for Chevrolet, the executives said.</p>
<p>NBC, meanwhile, has been on an unbroken winning streak for
five years, thanks to enduring hits like "The Cosby Show."
But the network has come under increasing pressure from ABC,
which has been developing its own hits like "Roseanne," which
toppled "The Cosby Show" from its No. 1 prime-time ranking in
the latest season. Industry executives suggested NBC may have
been willing to offer an attractive multiyear deal in order
to shore itself up for a less certain future.</p>

<p>Chatting About Chores</p>
<p>Procter & Gamble is expected to announce today that it is
the sponsor of a new "infotainment" program on the Telemundo
network in which the big stars will be P&G brands like Tide,
Crisco and Scope.</p>
<p>The program, called "Hablando," is billed as a half-hour
"information, education and entertainment program for
Hispanic women." Scripts call for actors to chat about
household chores, using and mentioning by name a number of
P&G products.</p>
<p>"`Hablando' is a unique opportunity to address the needs
of Hispanic women in their role as care-givers," P&G said in
a statement.</p>
<p>Telemundo said the show will feature Hispanic actresses
playing homemakers and a Hispanic actor as a building
superintendent. It will air twice a week in an afternoon time
slot on the cable TV network.</p>
