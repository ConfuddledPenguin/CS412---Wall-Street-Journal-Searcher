	<p class="article-leader">MOSCOW -- Mikhail Gorbachev was re-elected general
secretary of the Soviet Communist Party by a wide margin only
hours after attacking his critics, accusing them of being out
of touch with reality and guided by "ossified ideological
cliches."
   Unlike his carefully balanced political report given at
the start of the party congress last week, Mr. Gorbachev's
speech was an uncompromising assault on the military officers
and party veterans who have been sniping at his entire
perestroika reform program.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>He told them that their dogmatic interpretation of Marx,
Engels and Lenin "will kill perestroika and society," and
urged top officials who didn't agree with his foreign policy
to shut up or resign.</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev delivered his combative address to the party
congress after it had become apparent that his foes didn't
intend to challenge his leadership. In the election by secret
ballot, delegates voted about 3-1 to reappoint Mr. Gorbachev
as party leader, consolidating his power as the nation's
supreme leader. He is also president of the Soviet Union,
elected to that new post by the Soviet Parliament earlier in
the year.</p>
<p>Reflecting his desire to make party affairs more
democratic, Mr. Gorbachev wasn't the only candidate for
general secretary. Seven others were proposed, but six of
them immediately withdrew their candidacy. The only man bold
enough to take on the Soviet leader was Teimuraz Avaliani, a
58-year-old official from the Kuznetsk coal-mining region of
Siberia who helped to organize a nationwide miners strike
last year.</p>
<p>Mr. Avaliani's program differed little from that of the
Soviet leader, and he himself admitted that he felt "rather
uncomfortable" challenging Mr. Gorbachev. He received 501
votes in favor and 4,026 against, while Mr. Gorbachev was
supported by 3,411 delegates with 1,116 voting against.</p>
<p>Most delegates argued that Mr. Gorbachev was the only man
able to steer the nation through its current upheaval, and
needs all the support he can get.</p>
<p>But some, including Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze,
conceded that they were uneasy about the principle of one man
combining the highest offices of both party and state. Mr.
Gorbachev himself has been moving to separate the two,
transferring power from the party to the evolving system of
elected government.</p>
<p>If Mr. Gorbachev's re-election came as little surprise,
his speech amounted to a political bombshell. In recent
weeks, a growing number of military officers and midlevel
party officials have been openly complaining about
perestroika, claiming that it was responsible for the
collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and had brought the
Soviet Union to its knees. Their arguments, many of which
were repeated at the congress, have sent shivers through the
nation, raising fears of a reactionary backlash or worse.</p>
<p>But Mr. Gorbachev went out of his way to soothe such
worries. Point by point, he lambasted the arguments of the
conservatives, whom he described as being "nostalgic for old
times, old methods of work."</p>
<p>"The principal positive result {perestroika} is that
society won freedom," he said. "Without freedom, this
congress would not have been held, or it would not have been
held in the atmosphere we have now."</p>
<p>While accepting the need for criticism of some of his
policies over the past five years -- criticism he himself
aired -- he said the Communist Party was now in a crisis
largely because officials at middle and senior levels were
"unable or unwilling to understand that we live and work in a
new society."</p>
<p>"We are not changing our line or our choice and are
committed to socialist values," he said. "But believe me, the
party's success depends on whether it realizes that this is
already a different society. Otherwise it will be
marginalized by other forces and we shall lose ground."</p>
<p>He strongly defended his plans to replace the rigid
planned economy with a more market-oriented one, rejecting
claims by critics that this represented a lurch toward
capitalism. "If we continue to act {as before}, then we will
bankrupt the country," he said.</p>
<p>Much of his wrath was directed at officials who have
criticized the death of old-style Soviet ideology and the
foreign policy shift away from confrontation to a spirit of
cooperation with former foes.</p>
<p>"Well, do you want tanks again? Shall we teach them again
how to live?" he said, referring to charges that he "lost"
Eastern Europe. "Did we act wisely in adjusting and
developing good relations with tens of countries on all
continents? I am sure we did, and they responded in kind, not
only rulers but peoples. One must be blind to overlook it."</p>
<p>Those who disagreed with such policies were free to do so,
he said. But for people occupying important state posts -- an
apparent reference to the generals who have criticized him --
loyalty must be the watchword. "If they are decent people and
they disagree with government policy, they must resign," Mr.
Gorbachev said.</p>
