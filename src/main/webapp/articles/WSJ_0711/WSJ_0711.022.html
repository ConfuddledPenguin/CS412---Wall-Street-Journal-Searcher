	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump is bracing for his latest
battle. Call it Trump: The Hearings.
   Following from the wrenching $65 million restructuring of
his bank debt, the New York developer is about to be asked to
defend the plan before House Banking Committee Chairman Henry
Gonzalez. The maverick Texas populist is planning to hold
hearings next month to investigate how Mr. Trump's debt was
restructured, and to assess whether the bailout has been
scrutinized by banking examiners.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But Mr. Trump, in an interview yesterday, bristled over
the committee's inquiry, and said he didn't know if he would
voluntarily testify. He hasn't yet been called, but committee
staffers say he will be.</p>
<p>"I haven't missed a single interest payment. My assets are
great," he said. "If I'm asked to testify, then everyone who
is restructuring a loan should be asked to testify. That's
when I'll testify."</p>
<p>In recent hearings, Mr. Gonzalez hasn't been shy about
issuing subpoenas to anyone who has piqued his curiosity or
sense of outrage. Junk bond king Michael Milken and Lincoln
Savings chief Charles Keating were both subpoenaed.</p>
<p>In addition, Neil Bush, President Bush's son, appeared
voluntarily before Mr. Gonzalez's committee recently to
discuss his business relationships with two major borrowers
of Silverado Banking Savings & Loan Association, a failed
thrift in Denver of which he was a director.</p>
<p>Throughout the hearings, Mr. Gonzalez has pointedly asked
why federal examiners weren't more vigilant in regulating the
banks whose loans went bad. Mr. Gonzalez indicated, in a
letter dated yesterday to Currency Comptroller Robert Clarke,
that he would pursue that course again.</p>
<p>"The highly publicized loans and debt-restructuring
arranged for Donald J. Trump and the Trump Organization in
New York and New Jersey illustrate current problems in the
banking industry and real estate markets," Mr. Gonzalez wrote
in the letter, in which he asked Mr. Clarke to testify. Mr.
Gonzalez said he would pursue "the manner in which the
various regulatory agencies have reacted to the
developments."</p>
<p>Mr. Clarke oversees many of the big banks that loaned
millions to Mr. Trump, including Citibank, Chase Manhattan
and Manufacturers Hanover, all based in New York. Federal
Reserve officials and New York state regulators will also be
asked to testify, House staffers said.</p>
<p>As for Mr. Trump, he says what the banking examiners do
isn't his worry. "The banks and I worked out an intelligent
deal for both parties," he said. "I haven't dealt with the
regulators."</p>
