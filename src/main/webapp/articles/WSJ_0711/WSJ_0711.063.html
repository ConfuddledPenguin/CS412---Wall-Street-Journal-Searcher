	<p class="article-leader">MINNEAPOLIS -- Norwest Corp. is holding discussions with
United Banks of Colorado Inc. over a possible acquisition of
the Denver bank-holding concern.
   In a joint release, the companies said "no definitive
agreement has been reached," and cautioned there is "no
assurance" a deal will be struck.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Rumors the company might be the recipient of a bid sent
United Banks of Colorado shares upward on unusually heavy
volume yesterday, before trading was halted late in the
session. The announcement came after the close of trading
yesterday.</p>
<p>National over-the-counter trading in United Banks was
halted late in the session. At that point, the stock was
trading at $20, up 1 1/8 from Monday's close.</p>
<p>While the stock seems likely to climb today, yesterday's
closing price values United Banks at about $306 million.</p>
<p>The state of Colorado will open to nationwide interstate
banking in January. United Banks, the state's largest holding
company with assets of $5.9 billion, disclosed in April that
it has held talks with out-of-state banking companies
interested in a possible acquisition aimed at gaining entry
to the state. Norwest, with assets of about $26.7 billion,
was among those identified by United Banks as discussing an
acquisition.</p>
<p>Norwest currently has banking operations in Minnesota,
Wisconsin, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota,
South Dakota, Montana, and Arizona, and it recently reached a
definitive agreement to acquire Wyoming National Bancorp.,
its first bank in that state. Norwest, which in May paid $215
million to acquire First Interstate Corp. of Wisconsin has
made it clear that it intends to pursue further growth
through acquisition.</p>
<p>United Banks of Colorado has a book value, or
shareholders' equity, of $26.47 a share. Acquisitions of
financially healthy financial institutions typically involve
a price in excess of book value, which suggests that any
Norwest proposal for United Banks would cost it upwards of
$400 million.</p>
