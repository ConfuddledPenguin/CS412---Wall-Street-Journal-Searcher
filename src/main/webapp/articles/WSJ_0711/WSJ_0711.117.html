	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- The leaders of the industrial world agreed to
make a major study of the Soviet economy by year end to
define that country's needs, as the U.S. disclosed it is
negotiating with the Soviets to resolve longstanding
financial claims as a prelude to lifting restrictions on
Soviet borrowing in U.S. capital markets.
   But at the annual economic summit here, leaders of the
U.S., Japan, West Germany, Italy, Britain, France, Canada and
the European Community weren't able to break the deadlock on
agricultural subsidies in current international trade talks.
President Bush and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney
rejected a compromise proposed by British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher yesterday morning, U.S. and British
officials said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Later in the day, Mr. Bush presented a U.S. compromise
proposal on agriculture based on a recent paper by Aart de
Zeeuw, chairman of the agricultural negotiating committee at
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, according to U.S.
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter.</p>
<p>The paper was intended to serve as a catalyst for the GATT
talks in Geneva. The negotiations pit major food-exporting
countries such as the U.S., which favor the eventual
elimination of farm subsidies, against the EC, which argues
that such subsidies are needed to maintain Europe's social
fabric.</p>
<p>Mr. de Zeeuw proposed dividing agricultural subsidies into
four categories: domestic supports such as direct payments to
farmers; measures applied at borders, such as import quotas
and tariffs; export subsidies; and health and sanitary
requirements imposed on importers.</p>
<p>Mr. de Zeeuw recommended that trading nations agree to put
a ceiling on internal supports, according to officials
familiar with the text of his plan. He would convert all
border measures to tariffs. Export subsidies would be reduced
quickly and eventually eliminated. And nations would adopt a
code to assure that health regulations aren't used to
restrict trade.</p>
<p>"In my opinion, we'll either have some appropriate
reference to the {GATT proposal} or we'll agree to disagree,"
Mr. Yeutter said of the summit. "It's too late to paper over
our differences," the agriculture secretary said. "The
president understands that, and he's communicated that to his
negotiating colleagues."</p>
<p>Staff members were preparing to work through the night in
hopes of reaching an agreement by the time the summit
concludes today.</p>
<p>The summit's political communique, published yesterday,
masked the tensions on trade and focused instead on the
increasing acceptance of market-oriented democracy throughout
the world. The 1990s should be "a decade of democracy," the
communique said, welcoming recent moves toward democracy in
Eastern Europe and Latin America. President Bush and the
other summit leaders also gave a qualified endorsement to the
more tentative political and economic changes in the Soviet
Union and South Africa.</p>
<p>In that context, the summit nations agreed yesterday to
proceed with a study of the Soviet economy and its
requirements. The study would be conducted by the
International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development and the new European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady told reporters.</p>
<p>The study is a compromise between the U.S. and the EC,
which recently commissioned a separate study. That would have
excluded the U.S., Canada and Japan. The new study will draw
on the much greater resources of the IMF and World Bank,
which are dominated by the U.S., and American officials
believe these organizations will do a more rigorous analysis
of Soviet needs.</p>
<p>The Soviets also could soon have better access to U.S.
financial markets, which has been blocked under U.S. laws
that prohibit debtors in default from returning to American
financial markets. The Soviet Union, struggling to modernize
its economy, is willing to negotiate its debts outstanding,
while the U.S. is prepared to help the Soviets gain access to
financial markets.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union has substantial debts to the U.S.
unsettled from earlier eras. These include $300 million in
borrowings by the Czarist government and the provisional
Kerensky government prior to the Bolshevik revolution of
1917. The sum owed would amount to many billions of dollars
if accrued interest is taken into account. The Soviets also
owe the U.S. about $700 million for military hardware and
other war-related aid provided during World War II.</p>
<p>"We'll have to find a way to resolve it somewhere short of
their claim and our claim," said Secretary of State James
Baker. "It's a negotiation under way." Besides being
ineligible for commercial bank credit from the U.S., the
Soviets can't receive loans backed by U.S. government
guarantees because of the disputed loans.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union and its floundering economy have
attracted much of the attention at this summit. President
Mikhail Gorbachev wrote to President Bush before the
gathering asking for economic aid and technical assistance.
The U.S. so far has extended only limited technical
assistance to the Soviets.</p>
<p>Asked whether the U.S. would advance economic aid to the
Soviets, Mr. Baker said, "I don't think you should ever say
never." But he added, "There are, as I think we articulated,
particular problems that face the United States today in
using taxpayer dollars to provide economic assistance to the
Soviet Union." The U.S. approach could change if the Soviet
Union makes a fundamental effort "toward free-market reform,"
reduces the scope of military spending and cuts aid to
governments such as Cuba, which he said, "support
instability."</p>
<p>In their political communique, the summit leaders affirmed
they would help countries that choose freedom, and they said
political and economic freedoms are "closely linked and
mutually reinforcing." They said Europe is "at the dawn of a
new era" because of changes in Eastern Europe and the
unification of Germany, but added that the industrial
countries shouldn't neglect reforms elsewhere, including such
countries as Nepal, Namibia and Chile.</p>
<p>The communique said sanctions should remain on China
because of the massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in
Beijing. But it acknowledged some "recent developments"
there. The summit also offered the prospect of some expansion
in World Bank lending to China, particularly to address
environmental concerns.</p>
<p>The language on China was designed to finesse differences
between Japan and the other summit nations. Unlike its
partners at the summit, Japan favors resuming lending to
China and soon will restart a $5 billion loan held up since
the Beijing killings in June 1989.</p>
<p>The summit group congratulated Namibia and Chile on their
democracies, and urged Cuba and Romania to do more to foster
democracy. It also sounded a cautionary note on the surge of
ethnic and religious violence, saying "such intolerance can
lead to conflicts, which can threaten fundamental human
rights."</p>
<p>On South Africa, the summit leaders said they hope for "a
peaceful transition to a non-racial democracy and the
complete dismantlement of the apartheid system." The group
called on all parties to "refrain from violence or its
advocacy."</p>
