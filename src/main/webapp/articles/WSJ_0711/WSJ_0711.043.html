	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- General Electric Co. scientists announced they
had made one-carat, gem-quality synthetic diamonds that in
some ways are superior to natural diamonds.
   The diamonds, which GE hopes to begin producing in
commerical quantities in the next year or two, will be cut
into thin slices and sold for use in electronic components,
lasers and communications equipment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The GE diamonds are superior to natural diamonds in their
ability to soak up heat, the company's scientists said. Thus,
slices of the diamonds can be used to dissipate heat produced
in lasers and microelectronic circuits. GE officials
estimated the market for such heat-absorbing diamonds at $50
million to $100 million a year.</p>
<p>The GE diamonds are larger than the half-carat,
gem-quality synthetic diamonds that Sumitomo Electric
Industries of Japan has been selling to electronics companies
for the last five years. The GE stones, however, aren't as
large as gem-quality synthetic diamonds produced
experimentally by De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the big
South African diamond cartel. In 1987, the Gemological
Institute of America reported it had examined a five-carat
synthetic diamond loaned to the institute by De Beers.</p>
<p>GE scientists said their diamonds were superior to other
diamonds for heat-transfer properties. Diamonds are crystals
of pure carbon, with 99% of the carbon being the isotope
carbon-12. In natural diamonds, the scientists explained, the
heat-transfer properties are limited by the presence of the
carbon-13 isotope, which comprises 1% or more of natural
diamonds.</p>
<p>The GE diamonds are more than 99.9% pure carbon-12, said
the scientists from the company's research and development
laboratory in Schenectady, N.Y., where the methods for making
the diamonds were developed.</p>
<p>Tests by scientists at Wayne State University in Detroit
found that the "isotopically pure" synthetic diamonds are far
better heat sinks than predicted, the company said. The
synthetic diamonds, for instance, are 1,000% more resistant
to damage from high-powered laser beams than natural
diamonds.</p>
<p>GE said its scientists developed a twostep process for
making the isotopically pure diamonds. In the first step, a
chemical vapor rich in carbon-12 is deposited on a slab under
low pressure to create tiny diamond crystals. The sheet of
crystals is then crushed into a powder that is placed in a
large press that generates tremendously high pressures and
temperatures. A "seed" diamond crystal and a metal catalyst
is added. Careful control of pressures and temperatures
forces carbon-12 atoms to migrate to the seed crystal and
build up a large, gem-quality diamond.</p>
