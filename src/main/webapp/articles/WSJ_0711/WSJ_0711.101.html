	<h3>Heard on the Street: Investors Have One Word for Berlitz's Stock, And at 36 Times Earnings It's Spelled: `Pricey'</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">In any language, shares of Berlitz International are
getting expensive.
   Since the end of April, Berlitz stock has risen 48%.
Yesterday, it closed at 22, meaning that a share now sells
for 36 times the past 12 months' per-share earnings for the
language-instruction company. That puts it in the priciest
10% of all New York Stock Exchange stocks, according to
FactSet Data Systems. Not bad for a company that went public
only last December.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In 1988, Britain's Maxwell Communication acquired
Macmillan, which had owned Berlitz since 1965. In December,
Maxwell offered 44% of Berlitz shares to the public at 16 1/2
each. The price lingered in that neighborhood for several
months, then shot upward.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Berlitz yesterday cited three reasons
for the stock's strength: favorable reports by brokerage
analysts, increased interest in global businesses, and the
opening up of Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Gail Raiman, analyst with C.J. Lawrence, sees another
reason. Investors were intrigued when Robert Maxwell,
chairman of Maxwell Communication (and of Berlitz), said
recently that he plans to sell $800 million of "non-strategic
business assets." Some investors figured that this might mean
Berlitz and that Mr. Maxwell might wangle an above-market
price, at least for his own shares and possibly for the whole
company.</p>
<p>In light of the recent run-up, however, even fans of the
company are beginning to concede that the stock is pricey.</p>
<p>"We still own some; obviously we still like it," says
Robert Buhrmann, analyst with Sun Bank Capital Management in
Orlando, Fla. "Nobody else has the international reach that
they do, and nobody else can charge the premium price that
they do." He says Berlitz has "a defendable niche," and "we
like niche stocks."</p>
<p>Even so, Mr. Buhrmann says, "I would not add {to holdings}
at these prices." He suggests that long-term holders
"accumulate" the stock on dips below 20 and "be aggressive"
in buying on any declines below 18.</p>
<p>Sun Bank Capital owned 365,000 shares as of March 30,
according to CDA Investment Technologies, which tracks money
managers' government filings. The firm expands or trims its
core holdings based on short-term price movements. Lately it
has been trimming its Berlitz holdings. "But I certainly
wouldn't sell all my position," he says. "You know, really
good businesses are hard to find."</p>
<p>Berlitz should benefit from the increasing unification of
Europe and the growing ties between the old West and East
blocs. It caters to business people who want to learn (or
brush up on) a language before a trip or assignment abroad.
About half of its business comes from Fortune 500 companies.
For its intense, short-term courses, it generally charges
higher prices than competing language schools.</p>
<p>More than 75% of its business comes from outside North
America: Berlitz is much more likely to teach a Japanese
businessman English than to teach an American businessman
Japanese. Its revenue comes 40% from Europe, 27% from Asia,
23% from North America and 9% from Latin America. For people
apprehensive about the sluggish U.S. economy, that's a plus.</p>
<p>Analysts expect Berlitz to earn about 67 cents to 70 cents
a share this year, and close to $1 a share next year. The
company will say only that it expects this year's earnings to
top last year's 63 cents a share, but it doesn't quarrel with
analysts' estimates.</p>
<p>Reported earnings understate the cash flow, because
there's about 50 cents a share in amortization of goodwill,
mostly from the Maxwell acquisition of Macmillan. And debt --
a $50 million bank loan from Societe Generale in France -- is
moderate.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the stock is still priced at 22 times next
year's earnings. The average Big Board stock sells for about
16 times last year's earnings -- and even that multiple is a
bit above historic norms.</p>
<p>At Goldman Sachs, which handled the initial public
offering of Berlitz shares, analyst Robert Adler rates
Berlitz "attractive." But because the stock already has hit
his target price of 22, he says: "I guess I rate the stock an
excellent long-term hold, but I'd be less aggressive at
current levels."</p>
<p>The company projects that its sales will grow about 15% a
year for the next five years (10% volume increases and 5%
price increases), with earnings growth of perhaps 17% a year
(based on modest improvements in profit margins). That's nice
growth. But it isn't the sort of scorching growth for which
investors usually pay fat earnings multiples.</p>
