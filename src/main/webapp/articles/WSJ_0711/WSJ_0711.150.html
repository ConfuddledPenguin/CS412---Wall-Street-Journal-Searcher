	<p class="article-leader">What would Mikhail Gorbachev's Soviet Union do with $15
billion? This is the amount of aid that West Germany and
France would like their partners at the Houston economic
summit to send to the Soviets. While opponents of aid are
arguing, correctly, that the Soviet bureaucracy would surely
waste the money, there is another dimension to this question.
What reason is there to believe that most of this $15 billion
would spend any time at all in the Soviet Union? Hard
currency is fungible. It can go anywhere, buy anything.
   According to figures cited in May by National Security
Adviser Brent Scowcroft, Soviet transfers to some of its most
prominent client states add up to something over $15 billion.
The Rand Corp. breaks down the Soviet aid disbursements this
way: Cuba: $5 billion; Afghanistan: $3 billion; Vietnam: $2.5
billion; Syria: $1.5 billion; North Korea: $1 billion; Libya:
$1 billion; Angola: $1 billion. The total is $15 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>To their credit, President Bush and Secretary of State
Baker have pressed the Soviet leadership relentlessly on the
question of its continuing aid to the Cubans. And Messrs.
Gorbachev and Shevardnadze have been equally persistent in
rebuffing these entreaties. This is no small matter.</p>
<p>Despite various reports that the Soviets are unhappy with
Castro, there is little concrete evidence that the Soviet
Union is prepared to step down from its relations with Cuba
or, for that matter, with Afghanistan, Vietnam, Syria and
Libya. In no sense is the behavior of these countries
consonant with the reformist image that Mr. Gorbachev asks
the West to accept as genuine.</p>
<p>Indeed at the risk of being sniffed at by our more
credulous colleagues for "old thinking," it should be plain
that the Soviet Union's relations with these states remains
rooted in the Cold War. How come? Why is it that Mr.
Shevardnadze simply cuts off Secretary Baker or Western
reporters when asked about Cuba or his apparently bankrupt
treasury's ability to keep sending aid to these other
dictatorships?</p>
<p>The Soviet Union, of course, has a concrete military
presence in both Cuba and Vietnam. And while the Red Army, on
balance, may be out of Afghanistan, the Soviets continue to
rely on that country's compliant communist government for
natural gas. The Syrian relationship is predicated almost
wholly on continuing purchases from the Soviet arms industry.
Whatever the state of play in the external Soviet empire,
there is absolutely no reason why a "helpful" West should now
start transferring hard-currency aid or credits to a Moscow
that can't and won't promise not to pass along the money to
these pariah nations.</p>
<p>Fidel Castro to this day continues to throw into his
dungeons opponents who dare to speak out for democratic
reforms. Some of Mr. Gorbachev's former clients in Eastern
Europe already have begun to wind down their long
relationship with Fidel. Most recently, Czechoslovakia's
Vaclav Havel sent Castro a stiff letter denouncing his
continuing human-rights violations. Two days ago, seven Cuban
dissidents sought asylum at the Czech Embassy in Havana;
there is no expectation that Castro will give them exit
visas.</p>
<p>The West Germans have been pressing the hardest in Houston
for aid to the Soviets, and no doubt have an interest in
linking aid to their unification drive and desire to rid East
Germany of Soviet troops. But they have to understand we also
have a special interest in the presence of an unreformed
Stalinist state in our own back yard.</p>
<p>Most likely, the Houston summit will address the Soviet
aid question in its communique later today. We hope that it
shows some understanding that at this point in time, putting
cash in the Kremlin's hands is not yet a policy that is
either economically or morally defensible.</p>
