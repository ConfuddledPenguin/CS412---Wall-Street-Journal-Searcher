	<p class="article-leader">HOLLYWOOD -- Just when the deafening hype surrounding
"Dick Tracy" seems to be on the wane, Walt Disney Co. is
quietly gearing up for another marketing offensive: the home
video release of the film, said to be planned for November.
   Disney hasn't yet decided whether to price "Dick Tracy"
for the rental market or for sale directly to consumers,
according to industry sources. The "sell-through" market
holds out the lure of a bigger payoff than the rental market
but also carries bigger risks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Individuals close to the company confirm the timing of the
videocassette push, but Bill Mechanic, president of Disney's
video division, denies that such a decision has been made.
This may be for good reason: "Dick Tracy" is still playing at
more than 2,200 theaters around the country; it grossed a
respectable $6.6 million last weekend for a total of more
than $80 million after one month in release, and any public
indication that a video release is a few months away would
send theater owners howling.</p>
<p>Industry executives expect Disney to choose the
sell-through market for "Dick Tracy." In sell-through,
marketing and manufacturing costs are higher, and sales are
hard to predict: Earlier this year, Disney shipped too many
copies of "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids" and had to endure a high
percentage of returns from stores. But the rewards can be
hefty. Last Christmas, Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Video unit
rushed out "Batman" -- the movie with which Disney hates to
have "Dick Tracy" compared -- and sold nine million units.</p>
<p>"Dick Tracy" is expected to go sell-through for reasons
that speak directly to its strengths and weaknesses so far in
theaters. Though it's no "Batman," at its relatively low cost
"Dick Tracy" is indisputably a success. "It'll blow right
through $100 million, and that's the first checkoff point for
sell-through," says Tom Adams, analyst for the consulting
firm Paul Kagan Associates.</p>
<p>The bad news is that "Dick Tracy" isn't mesmerizing the
"core audience" of viewers, particularly males, in their
teens and early 20s. These are "repeaters," who go to the
same movie again and again and boost movies such as "Batman,"
the "Indiana Jones" and the "Star Wars" pictures into the
stratosphere.</p>
<p>Instead, according to an exit poll based on opening-night
attendance by research firm CinemaScore, "Dick Tracy" is
strongest with the youngest and oldest moviegoers. For "Dick
Tracy," 31% of the audience was over 35 years old; that age
group accounted for only 18% of the audience for "Batman."
And although 22% of the "Batman" audience was between 18 and
24, "Dick Tracy" only garnered 17% of that age group.</p>
<p>"Usually the only time you get this is with kiddie movies,
when parents bring their kids," says Harold Mintz, analyst
for CinemaScore. "It's getting both ends."</p>
<p>This is, however, good news for a video release. Video
buyers tend to be older than moviegoers, and 60% of video
sales are for gifts, says Amy Innerfield, general manager of
Video Flash, a tracking service of Alexander & Associates.
"People will buy this for their kids," she says, "and almost
everything from Disney is a collectible."</p>
<p>Moreover, Ms. Innerfield says, "there's a hole in the
market" for older viewers in the coming Christmas season,
when other leading sell-through titles will include "Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles," Disney's own "Peter Pan" and "The
Little Mermaid" (in a second promotional push), the Mary
Martin "Peter Pan" from Good Times Video and "All Dogs Go to
Heaven" from MGM/UA. Most of the other big films of the
summer, such as "Die Hard 2" and "Total Recall," are likely
to be priced as rentals and released early next year.
Industry executives are divided on the prospects for Disney's
"Pretty Woman." Some think Disney is so aggressive in video
that it will price the movie at sell-through and release it
this year despite the non-kiddie subject matter.</p>
<p>Ironically, the crowded video field may be hurting
business at the box office now. "Repeaters are a problem for
Hollywood in general this summer," says Martin Grove, film
analyst for the Hollywood Reporter and Baseline. "The 12- to
22-year-olds used to spend the money, but now tickets are as
high as $7.50, and you can wait six months and see it for
$2." Furthermore, he says, repeaters can't repeat because
they're too busy rushing to see the next incipient
blockbuster.</p>
<p>Even so, Disney has been quietly spreading the word among
video distributors that "Dick Tracy" is much better the
second time around, even if it's in the audience's living
rooms. "It's the perfect sell-through title for Christmas,"
says Elliot W. Stone, chairman of Philadelphia-based West
Coast Video Ltd., the nation's second-largest video retailer.</p>
<p>J. Ronald Castell, senior vice president of programming
for Blockbuster Video, the largest chain, adds, "People
aren't negative about `Dick Tracy'; they say it's OK, but
they all comment on the way it looks." That, he says, is
important for video buyers seeking to add to their
collections.</p>
<p>And though strolling tourists this summer seem to display
Bart Simpson more than Breathless Mahoney, Disney says
consumers do want to take home "Dick Tracy" merchandise.
Preliminary reports indicate that sales of "Dick Tracy"
products were more than double those of merchandise
surrounding Disney's "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" during the
first two weeks, according to Ann Osberg, vice president of
film and television licensing for Disney's consumer products
unit. It has sold "a couple of hundred million dollars at
retail," she says.</p>
<p>Larry Carlat, editor of Toy and Hobby World magazine,
cautions, "I don't think this is going to be long-lived once
the movie goes away."</p>
<p>Perhaps so, but under Disney's scenario, the movie won't
be going away, just changing venue. Domestic theatrical
revenues represent only about 20% to 30% of a film's total
take these days, and Disney aims to start its video push for
"Dick Tracy" while the marketing glow of the film is
lingering.</p>
<p>But with the movie still in theaters, an announcement of
Disney's plans isn't likely soon. Last summer, thousands of
video retailers assembled for their annual convention in Las
Vegas, Nev., eagerly anticipating a statement of Warner's
intentions for "Batman." The studio gave a presentation,
video chief Warren Lieberfarb addressed the throngs -- and
the subject didn't come up. "He went out the back door,"
recalls Vern Fross, senior vice president of sales and
marketing for Commtron Corp., the largest video distributor.
Warner announced its plans after Labor Day.</p>
