	<p class="article-leader">RICO's balloon continues to deflate. Prosecutors have had
a high time of it in recent years, using the perverse glamour
of a "racketeering" indictment against all manner of non-Mob
defendants -- from Wall Street to the Marcoses to the Chicago
trading pits. A jury in Chicago has just told the prosecutors
to get serious again. It returned eight relatively minor
guilty verdicts out of more than 100 counts filed against
three futures traders on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. A
RICO indictment stood at the center of the case. If
prosecutors discover white-collar crime, they should pursue
it. But let them find a basis for prosecution that the public
can recognize and respect. The law called RICO isn't it.</p>
