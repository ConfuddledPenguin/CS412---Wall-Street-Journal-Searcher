	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- The government's first prosecution of Chicago
commodities traders may have gone awry partly because it
became the Case of the Missing Victims.
   Throughout the seven-week trial, the government didn't
produce a single customer to testify that he had been ripped
off by exchange insiders. There were no grandmothers who had
lost their savings, no banks that had been bilked. "No
ultimate alleged victim was called to testify; that's very
unusual," says Robert Tarun, a former assistant U.S.
attorney.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Defense attorneys were able to emphasize that no customers
or brokerage firms ever complained about the trades that
formed the basis for the alleged fraud.</p>
<p>That and other weaknesses in the government's case led a
jury on Monday to set back the most ambitious investigation
ever of alleged corruption at Chicago's two big futures
exchanges. In essence, the jury found two traders in the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange's Swiss Franc pit guilty of eight
counts of stealing only $200 from customers. On the remainder
of the more than 100 counts, the jury either found the two
traders and a co-defendant innocent or couldn't reach a
verdict.</p>
<p>The jury was deadlocked on a conspiracy count against one
trader, Robert Mosky, under the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act. (The two other traders, David Zatz
and Danny Scheck, were charged with lesser violations of
commodity law.) In interviews, several jurors said a
significant number of their peers refused to consider the
conspiracy portion of the government's case, believing the
prosecutors hadn't come close to proving it.</p>
<p>Juror Terry Elkins, a 44-year-old plant engineer, said he
even believed a government agent had tried to lure traders
into breaking the law. Juror Jill Schleff, a former teacher,
said the lack of evidence that any major wrongdoing occurred
left her wondering as she went into the jury room, "Why were
they even arrested?"</p>
<p>The outcome of the trial, the result of an elaborate and
expensive undercover investigation dubbed "Operation
Hedgeclipper" at the Chicago Merc and "Operation Sourmash" at
the Chicago Board of Trade, threatens to cripple the
prosecution's ongoing investigation. So far, 48 individuals
have been indicted as a result of the investigation. Sixteen
of those indicted have pleaded guilty to fraud charges and
are cooperating with the government.</p>
<p>Prosecutors had hoped to tap into a public backlash
against 1980s-style greed. Prosecutors had hoped that, as
traders turned into witnesses, convictions would top 100 and
perhaps reach beyond the trading floor to clearing firm
officials.</p>
<p>Though the government lacked a target on the order of Ivan
Boesky, some Justice Department officials hoped the futures
case would rival Wall Street's insider-trading investigation.
But the small-change nature of some of the Swiss-franc pit
charges proved to be a far cry from the suitcase full of
money and illegal million-dollar trades the Wall Street probe
exposed.</p>
<p>Allowing the Swiss franc trial to be the leadoff court
case to develop out of the investigation also appears to have
been a blunder. The Swiss franc pit trial "was the defense's
best case. The government's case was highly technical," a
defense attorney said. Assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel
Gillogly conceded as much at one point in the trial. "There's
no sex, drugs and rock `n' roll here, this is a thinking
man's case," he said.</p>
<p>Government attorneys cited scheduling conflicts between
defense lawyers and federal judges for the Swiss franc case
going to trial first. But prosecutors could have delayed
asking a grand jury to indict the Swiss franc traders. Trials
of traders who worked in the Japanese yen pit at the Chicago
Merc and the soybean pit at the CBOT are set to begin in
September.</p>
<p>None of the cases the government plans to bring involve
huge amounts of money, but the counts listed in the Swiss
Franc case involved less than the rest. The dollar amount
allegedly stolen from customers in many of the trades was as
little as $12.50 a futures contract -- the minimum price
increment, or tick, by which foreign currency futures trade
on the Merc. Four of the trades that underlie the fraud
charges against Mr. Zatz resulted in profits to the trader of
$50 or less a trade.</p>
<p>This represented a minuscule portion of the trades
conducted in the pit. Mr. Mosky, for instance, was indicted
on less than 0.1% of the trades he made in 1988.</p>
<p>The cornerstone of the prosecution's case was a series of
more than 100 secret tape-recordings that undercover FBI
agent Randall Jannett made while posing as a futures trader
from February through December of 1988. Yet no single tape
was a "smoking gun" that clearly illustrated fraudulent
trades.</p>
<p>Nearly all the tapes concerning the three defendants
consisted of arcane and often confusing bantering among
traders about price quotes and the number of futures
contracts each had to buy or sell. Mr. Jannett interpreted
the trading tapes from the witness stand for 15 days, often
comparing them in mind-numbing detail to reams of exchange
trading data and brokerage firm records. One result of the
hours of testimony delivered in a "just the facts"
policeman's monotone was that some jurors fell asleep during
the trial.</p>
<p>While listening to the tapes the jurors also had to juggle
the government's transcript and another, covering certain
tapes, compiled by Mr. Scheck's attorney, Harvey Silets. The
defense transcript provided different interpretations and
attributions for several conversations.</p>
<p>The government's intent in interpreting each tape was to
illustrate that the trades were made non-competitively. The
government alleged that the traders acted as part of a
conspiracy to skim customer profits. The most common fraud
alleged occurred when Mr. Mosky, the broker handling customer
orders, got "local" traders trading just for themselves to
accept losing trades to cover errors Mr. Mosky made in
executing customers' orders. Mr. Mosky then allegedly repaid
the locals with non-competitive trades that the locals could
immediately convert into a profit in the market, pocketing
gains that rightly belonged to Mr. Mosky's customers. Mr.
Scheck and Mr. Zatz, both local traders, participated in the
scheme, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>But defense attorneys aggressively cross-examined the
agent, maintaining that most tapes represented two traders
confirming earlier trades that the
agent-turned-neophyte-trader had failed to notice. They said
he was too inexperienced to understand or see what was
happening in the pit on many occasions.</p>
<p>"Jannett's position was if he didn't see it, it didn't
happen," said Mr. Silets, Mr. Scheck's attorney. In his
closing arguments, Mr. Silets asked: "What did Jannett have,
some sort of force field out of Star Trek around him?"</p>
<p>The attorney got Mr. Jannett to concede that a trade he
said he observed as being below the market price, and
therefore non-competitive, could have happened 20 seconds
earlier than the time he recorded the event in his hidden
microphone. If it had occured 20 seconds earlier it would
have been executed at what was then the market price.</p>
<p>In addition to checking trades, many of the fraud counts
against Mr. Mosky were the result of honest mistakes he made
while trying to get all his customer orders executed under
chaotic market conditions, said Elliot Samuels, Mr. Mosky's
attorney. Error rates of 10% or more aren't considered out of
the ordinary for busy Merc brokers, he said.</p>
<p>"This is life in the pits. It's not pleasant, it's not
serene, it's not pretty, but things get done," Mr. Samuels
told the jury.</p>
<p>Prosecutors attacked what they called the Wizard of Oz
defense, which painted a picture of pit trading as too
complex for "mere mortals," such as jurors or FBI agents, to
understand. The government agent "pulled back the curtain"
and disclosed the corruption in the Swiss franc pit, just as
a Great Plains flimflam artist was disclosed as the true Oz,
said James Fleissner, an assistant U.S. attorney.</p>
<p>The government says its inclination is to retry the three
traders on the 86 counts on which the jury was deadlocked.</p>
