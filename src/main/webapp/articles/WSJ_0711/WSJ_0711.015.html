	<p class="article-leader">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Harvard University agreed to retire
about $5 million of Ecuador's national debt in return for the
creation of a scholarship fund.
   Harvard said the "debt for scholarship swap" marked the
first time distressed Third World debt would be paid off in a
way that promoted education.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In essence, the agreement allows Ecuador to retire its
debt at a discount and obtain scholarships to Harvard for
Ecuadorean students. Harvard said the agreement would allow
the university to provide more scholarships than it otherwise
could.</p>
<p>Harvard said it will buy Ecuadorean debt at a price equal
to its current value in the secondary market -- about 15% of
face value. Robert Scott, Harvard's vice president for
finance, said the university anticipated spending up to
$700,000 for about $5 million in face value of Ecuadorean
obligations.</p>
<p>Harvard will donate the debt to an Ecuadorean foundation,
which will exchange it for government bonds valued at about
half of the face-value amount Harvard purchases -- or about
$2 million to $2.5 million. The new Ecuadorean obligations,
Mr. Scott said, would be sold by the foundation and the
proceeds used to buy dollar-denominated securities that will
be the scholarship fund's capital.</p>
<p>Most of the income from the fund will support about 70
scholarships for Ecuadoreans over the next 10 years, roughly
doubling the number of scholarship students from Ecuador at
Harvard. About 20% of the fund's income will pay for research
grants and internships for Harvard students and faculty in
Ecuador. Mr. Scott said the scholarship fund would generate
between $100,000 and $200,000 in annual income.</p>
