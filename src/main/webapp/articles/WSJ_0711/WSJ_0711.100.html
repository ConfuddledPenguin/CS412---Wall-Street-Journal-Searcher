	<p class="article-leader">Asko Deutsche Kaufhaus AG's decision to throw in the towel
in its battle with Dutch retailer Ahold N.V. ends nearly a
year of bitter dispute between the two companies and also
demonstrates once again the virtual invulnerability of Dutch
defenses against a hostile takeover.
   West German Asko is a wholesaler of food and other
consumer goods, and a retailer of food and drink. Ahold is a
food retailer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Asko said that it would sell its entire 13.1% stake in
Ahold to a consortium of Dutch and West German banks led by
Amsterdam-Rotterdam N.V. and Deutsche Bank. The banks in turn
will privately place the shares in as wide a distribution as
possible with private investors, according to a statement
issued by Ahold.</p>
<p>An Ahold spokesman indicated that no further contacts
between the companies is likely given the fact that Ahold and
its partners in the Associated Marketing Services (AMS), a
European retailing alliance, have successfully recruited
another West German company, Allkauf AG, to replace Asko as
the West German representative in the AMS.</p>
<p>Analysts agree that this marks the end of Asko's bid for a
strong presence in Western Europe outside of West Germany.</p>
