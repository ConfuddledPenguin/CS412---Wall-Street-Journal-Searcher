	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Marvin Roffman, the casino analyst who lost
his job after making critical remarks about the financial
prospects for Donald Trump's Taj Mahal casino, has taken
legal action against both his former firm and Mr. Trump.
   Mr. Roffman filed an arbitration claim for wrongful
discharge against his former employer, Janney Montgomery
Scott, a securities firm owned by Penn Mutual Life Insurance
Co. The claim is being brought before a New York Stock
Exchange arbitration unit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Roffman also is suing Mr. Trump in a Pennsylvania
federal court alleging that Mr. Trump interfered with Mr.
Roffman's employment by threatening to sue Janney Montgomery
unless Mr. Roffman publicly apologized for his remarks about
the Taj Mahal.</p>
<p>For each action, Mr. Roffman is seeking compensatory
damages in excess of $1 million, plus unspecified punitive
damages. He also is seeking reinstatement by Janney
Montgomery Scott.</p>
<p>On March 20, the day Mr. Roffman's negative comments about
the casino appeared in this newspaper, Mr. Trump wrote a
letter to Norman Wilde Jr., president of Janney Montgomery,
stating: "I am now planning to institute a major lawsuit
against your firm unless Mr. Roffman makes a major public
apology or is dismissed."</p>
<p>Mr. Roffman first sent an apologetic letter to Mr. Trump
but withdrew it the next day, saying: "I retract the letter."
That day, Mr. Roffman was fired.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump's attorney denied the casino owner and developer
had anything to do with Mr. Roffman's termination.</p>
<p>An attorney for Janney Montgomery said Mr. Roffman was
fired for repudiating a letter to Mr. Trump apologizing for
his remarks about the Taj Mahal. The attorney said the letter
was written by Mr. Roffman after his supervisor warned him,
in writing, not to send it.</p>
