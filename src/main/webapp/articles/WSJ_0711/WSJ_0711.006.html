	<p class="article-leader">Datchet, England -- When he was 11 years old, Richard
Porter attended a school dance competition, where he saw a
little blond girl. He asked her to dance, and they waltzed
and tangoed through amateur dance competitions for a year or
so until the little blonde quit to join the Girl Guides.
   Richard danced on. And that, more or less, is how he
became a British television star.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Richard Porter is not a big star, of course. He still can
stroll the streets of this snug London suburb without fending
off autograph fiends. On the other hand, it could be that no
one recognizes him in T-shirt and jeans. Dress him in black
sequined trousers and a low-cut shirt, however, and Mr.
Porter starts looking like the star of the longest-running
television musical series in the world.</p>
<p>It's called "Come Dancing," and as the innocently dated
title hints, it has aired regularly on the BBC since the
autumn of 1949.</p>
<p>"Come Dancing" is a televised series of British amateur
ballroom dance competitions. Broadcast every summer from a
cavernous old ballroom in Blackpool, an old-fashioned north
England resort, each 45-minute episode engages the dancers in
spirited regional competitions pitting, say, the best fox
trotters from Manchester against the finest from Birmingham.</p>
<p>Some of the dancers, like Mr. Porter and his pretty
partner/wife, Els, are as polished as professionals and would
be thoroughly at home on a Broadway stage. Others, flaunting
too many sequins and too much baby fat, would be better off
confining their swings and sways to small parties in the
Liverpool suburbs.</p>
<p>Contestants, mostly in their early 20s, perform updated
versions of Viennese waltzes, fox trot, quick step, tango,
samba, cha-cha and formation dances, which are large ensemble
numbers that owe a mighty debt to Las Vegas and the Ice
Capades.</p>
<p>Always, always the Come Dancers are dressed to thrill,
particularly the Latin women, who don't have to wear long
pastel chiffon and maribou feathers like their ballroom
counterparts. Mr. Porter describes the Latin category, his
specialty, as, "The one where the dancing is really fast, and
the girls don't wear a lot."</p>
<p>Angela Rippon, who hosts the show this season, credits
"Come Dancing's" massive success -- more than six million
viewers in the U.K. -- to its unique escapism. "We've got an
awful lot of soaps, game shows and chat shows on television
these days, and `Come Dancing' is glamour and entertainment."</p>
<p>John Leach, head writer for Dance News, a 52-year-old
weekly paper devoted to competitive dance, thinks ballroom
dancing has simply grown more popular here. "Right now people
are upset by the general level of violence in society, with
football hooliganism and all, and are looking for something
respectable."</p>
<p>And the history-minded point out that Britain is the home
of both social dancing and competitive dancing.</p>
<p>Another reason, which no one actually mentions, is that
"Come Dancing" attracts two very different tiers of equally
rabid fans. One contingent views the proceedings quite
literally, applauding the dancers' skills, admiring the
glittering costumes and perhaps remembering a time when
people danced in the evenings instead of watching television.</p>
<p>The others think "Come Dancing" is high camp-the more
sequins and lacquered hair, the better. "I think it's
hilarious, though I mean that in a good humored way," says
Mark Philliskirk, who works in public relations at a large
London hotel. "No matter how talented the dancers are, it's
often in very bad taste."</p>
<p>Like so much in Britain, "Come Dancing" also reflects the
barriers between the classes and shows how television quietly
acknowledges and reinforces these. "Come Dancing's"
contestants are for the most part working-class Britons, not
a bunch of Princess Di's cronies. And like beauty pageants in
the American South, competitive dance is one way for the most
talented to waltz out of mundane occupations like
hairdressing and bank clerking -- or at the least, flirt with
a little glamour if they never actually make it to the top.</p>
<p>Those who hit it big on "Come Dancing" can turn pro and
join the international competitive dance circuit, supporting
themselves by demonstrating, performing and teaching in
places such as Tokyo, Rio and even Moscow.</p>
<p>Such businesslike aspects of the sport are precisely what
the show's producer, Simon Betts, wants to emphasize, and
he's tried to chip away at "Come Dancing's" more endearingly
amateurish aspects in recent seasons. Gone are the avuncular
announcers of the past, who would confide that Daphne's
mother sewed 5,000 pink sequins on her daughter's dress.</p>
<p>The music, played by a 31-piece orchestra, also has moved
from faceless generic dance music to recognizable hits by
Jerome Kern, Cole Porter and Michael Jackson.</p>
<p>And at some future date, "Come Dancing" may go
international, pitting the best of England against the best
of, say, West Germany or Norway or even the U.S., which,
according to Mr. Porter, is producing some spirited Latin
American competitors.</p>
<p>"It's easy to knock `Come Dancing' and the thousands of
miles of tulle," says Mr. Betts, who co-produced the wedding
of Fergie and Prince Andrew for television. "But the fact is
that British dancers happen to be the best in the world. We
have few world champions in anything now, and our dancers
deserve more credit than they are getting."</p>
<p>Richard and Els Porter, who already have won a slew of
amateur international dance competitions, think Mr. Betts is
right. A year ago they quit their jobs and now practice their
dancing full time, supplementing dance workouts with weight
training. ("You don't get as tired in competitions," says Mr.
Porter.) For now, money, including the more than $15,000 they
spend annually on costumes and shoes, comes from their
savings, their parents and two sponsors. Once they turn pro,
following "Come Dancing's" current season, their dancing
should make money instead of gobble it up.</p>
<p>And once they turn pro, of course, they won't be tangoing
with the amateurs on "Come Dancing" anymore. But should their
children -- or grandchildren -- decide to samba in their
footsteps, television's longest-running musical series
probably still will be around.</p>
