	<p class="article-leader">As bad public policy goes, the proposal for an 0.5% tax on
stock transactions is something of a champion. All at the
same time, this tax would increase the volatility of stock
markets, knock roughly 5% off the Dow Jones average, damage
the ability of new companies to raise capital and drain
liquidity from already endangered U.S. financial markets. And
all to try to raise $10 billion in federal revenues -- $10
billion that surely will not materialize.
   The Treasury arrives at its $10 billion figure via the
simple expedient of multiplying 0.5% by the value of the $2
trillion trading on the New York Stock Exchange each year.
Two trillion dollars times 0.5% equals $10 billion of found
money. The assumption here is that making trading more
expensive and less profitable will not reduce the number of
trades executed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But it will of course. And in consequence, not only will
the government gather less in revenue, but the stock market
will be pushed toward even greater volatility than it shows
today. Advocates of the transaction tax claim that it would
encourage long-term investment, and therefore reduce "excess"
volatility. But a long-term investor is not just one who buys
100 shares of utility stock, sticks them in a safe deposit
box and waits for retirement.</p>
<p>Pension fund and mutual fund money managers, who remain in
the market for long periods of time, adjusting their
portfolios as circumstances change are long-term investors
too. They play the important role of capitalizing sector
trends, arbitrating differences in rate of return across
industry groups and sending capital from low-return to
high-return sectors.</p>
<p>One effect of a transaction tax would be to discourage
such investors from engaging in such active management of
their portfolios. This is because the transaction tax adds to
transaction costs. When the benefits of a particular trade
are less than the transaction tax, investors will be
dissuaded from trading. They will disregard information that
would justify small increases or decreases in the prices of
stocks. However, as information continues to flow, a point
will be reached where the benefits of doing the trade will
exceed the cost of the tax. The tax, in other words, will
cause stock prices to move in bigger jumps, both up and down,
than they now do.</p>
<p>In other words, rather than promoting swift and continuous
adjustment to new information, a transaction tax would cause
prices to jerk and lurch. For smaller, less liquid, firms the
fluctuations will be exacerbated.</p>
<p>The first of these swings will occur as soon as the tax
looks likely to become law. Combined with other pending laws,
the tax would quickly wipe some 5% -- or 150 points -- off
the value of the Dow Jones average. Here's why.</p>
<p>Investors have historically expected an average 3%
after-tax real growth in the value of their equities over
time. At the current rate of inflation, roughly 4%, that
translates into 7% after-tax nominal growth in capital value.</p>
<p>Under the present tax regime, a company must earn 14.7%
annually in order to satisfy its investors. After paying its
34% corporate income tax, a company that earns 14.7% will
have 9.7% to distribute to its owners. If it, as most
companies do, kicks out 3% of earnings to shareholders in the
form of dividends, it will retain 6.7% of earnings. This
should be reflected in appreciation of the value of the
stock.</p>
<p>From the shareholders' point of view, a 3% dividend will
translate into a 2.2% return on investment after paying
personal taxes. The 6.7% of earnings that are retained will,
after payment of the current 28% capital gain, translate into
a 4.8% return on investment. And of course, 2.2% after-tax
return from dividends plus a 4.8% after-tax capital
appreciation add up to the required 7% return.</p>
<p>Now add an 0.5% transaction tax to the calculation. The
shareholder now needs a 7.2% increase, instead of a 6.7%
increase, in the after-tax, after-3% dividend value of the
company if he is to earn his nominal 7%. Redoing the
arithmetic, that means the company must earn a nominal 15.5%,
instead of 14.7%. That additional increment it will now have
to earn doesn't sound like much, but it adds up to a 5%
increase in the cost of capital.</p>
<p>Well of course, companies can't summon up the necessary
improvement in earnings with a snap of the fingers. So a 5%
increase in the cost of capital will mean a corresponding 5%
depreciation in asset values -- and thus 5% off the value of
equities.</p>
<p>Some in the Bush administration dream of trading off the
transaction tax as part of a deal that would also cut the
capital gains rate to 20% from 28% and boost the top personal
income tax rate to 33% from 28%. This deal would not be worth
doing, at least not from the point of view of equities
markets.</p>
<p>The combined effect of the lower capital-gains tax rate
plus the higher top personal income tax rate would be to
reduce the pre-tax nominal return needed to earn a post-tax
7% (made up, remember, of 3% real growth and 4% inflation) to
9.3% from the 9.7% mentioned above. That would cut the cost
of capital by 4% and, presumably, boost the value of the
equities markets by 4%.</p>
<p>But the 0.5% transaction tax would wipe 5% off the value
of those markets. So all this finagling will simply have the
effect of increasing the cost of capital by 1%. The
transaction tax will annihilate the advantage of lower
capital-gains taxes.</p>
