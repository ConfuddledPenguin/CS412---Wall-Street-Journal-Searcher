	<p class="article-leader">Well-known in the field of international studies as the
managing editor of Foreign Affairs and the author of
wide-ranging books and articles on American foreign policy,
James Chace was born in 1931 into the kind of family often
characterized as influential. But he grew up just at the time
that its influence and power base were waning.
   In his lucidly written book, "What We Had: A Memoir"
(Summit, 187 pages, $17.95), Mr. Chace takes a thoughtful
look at his family background, not only as a force that
helped mold him, but also as an example of what went wrong
with the once-prosperous city of Fall River, Mass., where he
was raised.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Chace money came primarily from cotton mills, which
flourished (as mills are wont to do) in wartime with orders
for uniform cloth. By the time young James came on the scene,
however, his father's income was chiefly derived from selling
off equipment and importuning his sister (who'd married a
wealthy man) for contributions. According to Aunt Sue ("the
surest witness of some past no one quite remembered"),
profits from the mills went to finance the political career
of her father, Frank Minthorn Chace, who was president of the
Massachusetts state senate. No provision was made for
reinvesting to buy new machinery so that the prosperity of
the family -- or the town -- would continue.</p>
<p>Nor was Sen. Chace's attitude exceptional for his time.
The picture of the mill owners that emerges in these pages is
likely to dispel anyone's lingering nostalgia about the good
old days of provident New England businessmen.</p>
<p>Recounting his boyhood in Fall River and his various
attempts to break out of its confines, Mr. Chace not only
provides a portrait of himself as a young man, but also
summons up the characteristics of the generation that came of
age in the years after the Second World War. Mr. Chace and
his friends at Harvard did not really exemplify the group
that attended school on the G.I. Bill. Disdaining politics --
and other forms of seriousness -- for the aesthetics of
Yeats, Eliot and Dylan Thomas, many later would find
themselves caught up in the emerging structure of the Cold
War, but without the passionate intensity and conviction they
had felt as boys hunting Nazi spies in the years before.</p>
<p>The weakest portions of Mr. Chace's memoir have to do with
his attempt to deal with the inexplicable streak of violence
in his older brother and, to a lesser degree, in himself.
Although he alludes to this violence, he fails to evoke, let
alone explain it fully enough for the reader to get much
sense of it. Indeed, Mr. Chace is at his best when analyzing
generational trends or evoking cultural contrasts, as he does
so beautifully in his opening reconstruction of how it must
have felt for his mother and grandmother, poor but
respectable people from the pastoral world of the Hudson
River Valley, to arrive in the alien, sullen industrial
environment of Fall River.</p>
<p>Although the title suggests nostalgia, "What We Had" is
remarkably free from sentimentality. It is a forthright,
intelligent, enjoyable, if uneven book, uneven in that its
strengths as cultural and family history are not matched by
strengths in more introspective realms.</p>
<p>Tom Grimes's "A Stone of the Heart" (Four Walls Eight
Windows, 131 pages, $15.95) is a novel, but it too conveys a
vivid sense of a boy coming of age.</p>
<p>Although Michael McManus, the 14-year-old narrator growing
up in a lower-middle-class Catholic family in Queens in the
summer of 1961, is a far cry from James Chace in personality,
generation, religion and social background, there are odd
similarities in their stories. Both have alcoholic fathers
reluctant to assume responsibilities, disillusioned mothers
who retreat from reality, and a troubled and troublesome
brother. In Michael's case, it's his younger brother Rudy,
who is six years old but has never spoken a word.</p>
<p>Michael's response to his family situation is to eat. He's
the proverbial "fat kid," ransacking the refrigerator for
satisfaction he never finds, each bite of junk food an
unsuccessful antidote to the previous one. Michael's mother
cherishes the hope that her son's aptitude for schoolwork
will lead to a distinguished career as a doctor and entree
into the haven of "fortune and respectability," but Michael
knows he is just "a slightly above average school kid.
Nothing to get excited about."</p>
<p>Michael's overriding passion is for baseball: and this is
the summer that Roger Maris is challenging Babe Ruth's
single-season home-run record. With that excitement in the
background and the far less pleasant excitement of his family
crises in the foreground, Michael has his hands full.</p>
<p>As narrator of his own story, Michael displays the humor,
compassion and underlying toughness that enabled him to cope
with the tensions of a family in the process of breakdown.
And though some of the thoughts are a bit pretentious, the
narrative Mr. Grimes has fashioned for him is fast-paced,
funny, dramatic and convincing. Mr. Grimes achieves a great
deal in the course of this short first novel.</p>
