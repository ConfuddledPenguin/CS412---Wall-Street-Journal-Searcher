	<p class="article-leader">Hong Kong -- Screwing up my courage I said in my best
approximation of a Peking accent, "If you let me ride with
you I'll show you my Chairman Mao button collection." In
those days, there was nothing more coveted and more difficult
to get than a Chairman Mao button . . . The worker's eyes
gleamed with interest and I pressed my advantage. "I'll give
you one. I'll let you choose any one you like."
   -- From "Son of the Revolution"</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Unlike 12-year-old Liang Heng, who parts with a precious
button to stay on a train to Peking in 1966, you wouldn't get
far in China with a Chairman Mao button today. Once a prized
emblem of revolutionary fervor, a Mao badge now can be had
for the asking.</p>
<p>"There's a billion Chinese and they made a whole lot of
buttons," says Scott Seligman, an American living in Hong
Kong who has saved hundreds of Mao buttons since starting his
collection 10 years ago. "They have this stuff around the
house; they don't want it, but they don't want to throw it
away because they don't want to be accused of anything, and
they're perfectly happy to give you this stuff."</p>
<p>The first button, issued to officers of the People's
Liberation Army in 1965, was a rectangular-shaped aluminum
pin bearing the slogan, "Serve the People." Mao buttons also
were awarded to the Red Guards to commemorate their long
marches to revolutionary sites. They swapped revolutionary
paraphernalia, vying for the largest, rarest Mao buttons. A
former Red Guard, Cheng Ting Au, now a professor in Hong
Kong, says, "Now you choose Pierre Cardin for prestige; then,
you would attract the attention of your superior by wearing a
new Mao badge]"</p>
<p>At the height of the button craze in the late '60s, the
Great Helmsman's face appeared on aluminum, porcelain, bamboo
and plastic. Schools, factories and other organizations
mass-produced the buttons, inscribing their names and the
date of issue on the back. When friends or relatives got
together, the big thrill was to compare button collections.
"You were very ashamed if you didn't have an impressive
collection," says a former PLA soldier, Keung Yuk Sing.</p>
<p>Chinese traded Mao badges the way Americans exchange
baseball cards. Friends bearing buttons would display their
collections in specially made, two-section holders: one with
buttons to trade; the other with buttons to brag over but
never to part with.</p>
<p>It was the Great Helmsman himself who finally brought a
halt to this frenzy. In the early '70s, Mao asked his
admirers to turn in their collections. "Return my airplanes,"
he said. People were reimbursed, according to the weight of
their collections -- by their work units or neighborhood
committees. Mao's rationale for the recall seems to have been
that China was running out of aluminum. But Grace Wang, who
held onto her collection, remembers it differently: "People
realized they'd been betrayed by Chairman Mao; they regretted
that the country had spent so much money on the buttons."</p>
<p>"The fever had died," says Ms. Wang, who now lives in Hong
Kong. "The collections had become a burden to the people, and
the government didn't want to see Mao's face in the trash
can, so they offered a place to dump the collections." Ms.
Wang kept her collection "for art's sake." She boasts that
"you can't find nicer buttons than I have." One of her
treasures is the size of a dinner plate. Another glows in the
dark.</p>
<p>Beyond size and rarity, buttons are judged on whether they
have a date inscribed on the back and on the quality of
craftsmanship. Particularly esteemed are those that make up
the complete set of the five major revolutionary shrines:
Jinggang Mountain, Peking, Shaoshan (Mao's birthplace), Yenan
and Ruijing.</p>
<p>Mr. Seligman's piece de resistance is a red alarm clock
with Chairman Mao on its face. A young Red Guard is in the
foreground, ticking off each second by waving her little red
book. After searching 10 years for such a clock, Mr. Seligman
paid $50 for it this year in Beijing. "I would have paid
twice that; I was so glad to see it."</p>
<p>A British collector in Hong Kong, Anne Shepherd, says the
Chinese have recognized the potential market and are
beginning to produce new Cultural Revolution clocks. "But
mine's the real thing . . . it's old and bashed up," she
says.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, when she started her collection, it
perplexed her Chinese friends. "But then they understood; I
would give them English stamps, and they would give me
buttons." At last count, she had 100 buttons.</p>
<p>Ms. Shepherd refuses to buy buttons from the shops in Hong
Kong, where they're sold for as much as $13. At the
"foreigner shopping" areas in Beijing, Mao buttons run about
$1, up from about 30 cents 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Button collectors may soon hit hard times, however.
Chairman Mao buttons are coming back in style in China. These
days the Chinese wear the buttons as a slap in the face to
the Deng Xiaoping administration. Mao buttons made
appearances last year at demonstrations in Beijing and even
in Texas. "A group of students held up a huge sheet of Mao
buttons to protest that Deng is a murderer," says Zhou Xiao,
who was a student organizer in Houston.</p>
<p>It's unlikely that there will be buttons with Mr. Deng's
face on them. According to Mr. Keung: "The cult of
personality will never happen again. If there is positive
meaning from the Cultural Revolution, it's that we grew up;
we realized Mao was not a god, and the Chinese people would
never worship any leader again."</p>
