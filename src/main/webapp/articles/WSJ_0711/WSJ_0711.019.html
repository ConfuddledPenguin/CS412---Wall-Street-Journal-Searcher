	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Star stock picker Mario J. Gabelli is putting
a little of his own money into commodities.
   Last month, he bought $94,540 of stock in Balfour Maclaine
Corp., a New York-based commodities-trading firm where Mr.
Gabelli is a director, filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission show.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I'm going to make some money," Mr. Gabelli said. The
purchase, of 13,000 shares, almost tripled his stake in
Balfour Maclaine.</p>
<p>Mr. Gabelli, whose investment portfolios boast some of the
best long-term performance records among U.S. money managers,
said that "visceral instincts" tell him "the 90s will see a
return in commodity-related businesses."</p>
<p>Although Balfour is a "very volatile company" that he
"would not have bought for my client accounts," Mr. Gabelli
is bullish. He's betting that an upturn in the agricultural
cycle will benefit farm equipment companies, fertilizer
concerns and even some related Midwestern businesses.</p>
<p>Balfour Maclaine acquired Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s
cocoa-trading unit and some of the firm's employees earlier
this year.</p>
<p>Mr. Gabelli paid an average share price of $7.27 in his
purchases from June 6 to June 21. The stock closed at $6.50,
unchanged, in American Stock Exchange trading yesterday.</p>

<p>GRAPHIC SALES: Nine insiders sold $1.8 million of Mentor
Graphics Corp. stock in late April and May at prices well
above the stock's current level.</p>
<p>Company President Gerard Langeler and the others got an
average price of $22.96 for the shares they sold, SEC filings
show. The stock, which dropped sharply last week after Mentor
announced that its second-quarter profit would be 10 cents a
share or less, closed yesterday at $18 a share, up 75 cents,
in over-the-counter trading. The Beaverton, Ore., maker of
computer-aided engineering systems reported earnings of 29
cents a share in the year-earlier quarter.</p>
<p>Jack Carvath, the company's treasurer, said the insiders
have a 30-day window four times a year in which to sell
shares, a limitation that tends to cluster sales. SEC filings
show the company had similar selling activity in May 1987 and
May 1988.</p>
<p>The biggest insider-seller this spring was Mr. Langeler,
according to SEC filings. They show he sold 25,000 shares, or
7% of his stake in the company, on May 3 at $21.70 a share.
The second-largest sale was by the company's chief financial
officer, Brian Henry. He sold 15,335 shares, his total
holdings, according to the filings. The other insiders, all
vice presidents, sold from 240 to 12,000 shares, representing
between 7% and 100% of their total holdings.</p>
<p>Mr. Langeler and Mr. Henry couldn't be reached for
comment, but Mr. Carvath said all nine insiders sold less
than 10% of their stakes when their options holdings are
taken into account.</p>
<p>Laura Conigliaro, an analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., downgraded the stock from "buy" to "hold"
early last month, predicting "transition-related bumps." She
said she still likes the stock long term. "There aren't that
many competitors that serve the broad sweep of its industry,
and Mentor's the one with the critical mass," she said.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>COMING OUT IN THE WASH: Harvey Kapnick, a director of
Maytag Corp., sold 51% of his direct and indirect holdings in
the company, 105,047 shares, in several sales from June 8
through June 20, filings with the SEC show. His shares of the
Newton, Iowa-based maker of appliances fetched prices ranging
from $17.38 to $18.63 a share, or a total of about $1.9
million.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange trading, Maytag stock closed
yesterday at $17.625, up 25 cents.</p>
<p>Mr. Kapnick is traveling in Europe and was unavailable for
comment, and the company declined to comment. SEC filings
show that roughly half of the shares he sold had been
obtained less than a year earlier through the exercise of
below-market options.</p>
