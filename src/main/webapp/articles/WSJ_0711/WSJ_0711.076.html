	<p class="article-leader">SAN ANTONIO, Texas -- Two weeks into a six-month sentence,
a television reporter here was freed after a source whose
identity he was protecting identified herself to attorneys.
   "She came forward," Brian Karem, the reporter, said. "I
proved my point and I would keep my promise again." Mr. Karem
surrendered his notes and confirmed the name of the source
who helped arrange a phone interview last year with jailed
murder suspect Henry David Hernandez. Mr. Karem works at
KMOL-TV in San Antonio.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Two other sources had already identified themselves, but
Mr. Karem refused to give up his notes or testify without the
permission of the third, Mr. Hernandez's cousin Deborah
Ledesma. He was jailed for contempt of court June 27 and his
case stirred national debate on reporter privilege under the
First Amendment.</p>
<p>Mr. Hernandez, on trial with his brother Julian for the
March 1989 murder of San Antonio policeman Gary Williams,
said in the phone interview that he shot the officer in
self-defense. Attorneys had insisted that the name of the
third source was important to admission of the interview as
evidence.</p>
<p>Mr. Karem's request for an emergency stay of the jail
sentence pending an appeal was rejected by the Supreme Court
earlier this week.</p>
