	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The recently created Lehman Brothers division
of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. is already living up to the
tony image of its famous name -- at least when it comes to
pay.
   Shearson's new proxy statement shows that the two men
chosen to head the division, which includes all of Shearson's
investment banking and trading operations, received the
fattest paychecks in 1989 among current Shearson executives.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The two are Sherman R. Lewis Jr., who received more than
$1.6 million in cash compensation last year, and Richard S.
Fuld Jr., who was paid almost that amount, the proxy
statement says.</p>
<p>The statement doesn't include departed executives, such as
Peter A. Cohen, formerly chairman, and Jeffrey Lane, formerly
president, or Shearson's new chairman, Howard L. Clark Jr.,
who came on board in January.</p>
<p>The 184-page proxy statement was issued by Shearson prior
to the firm's annual meeting, scheduled for Aug. 9. At the
shareholders' meeting, the firm's merger into American
Express Co., which owns a 60% stake in Shearson, will be
formally approved.</p>
<p>On another pay front, the proxy statement discloses that
Mr. Cohen will be reimbursed, through next March 31, as much
as $30,000 a month in "out-of-pocket office, staff and other
expenses of a nature similar to those paid by the company
prior to his resignation." As previously reported, Mr. Cohen
will technically remain a Shearson consultant through March
31, as part of a severance agreement his lawyer negotiated
that is valued at $10 million or more.</p>
<p>Among other things, the proxy statement discloses that Mr.
Cohen agreed not to hire away from Shearson before 1993 any
employee paid more than $40,000 a year, or any employee
before December 1991.</p>
<p>Despite the big pay envelopes for Messrs. Lewis and Fuld
at the Lehman Brothers division, Shearson's overall
compensation levels still pale, compared with other big
securities firms. The three top executives at Morgan Stanley
Group Inc. received 24% pay increases last year, boosting
their salaries to more than $5 million apiece. Then again,
Morgan Stanley posted net income of $443 million last year;
Shearson earned $110 million.</p>
<p>In a carefully worded section of the new proxy statement,
Shearson addresses continuing speculation that American
Express will eventually sell all or part of the firm.
"American Express's present intention is to continue to
operate (Shearson) as a separate business after the merger,"
the proxy statement reads. "American Express does not at this
time have plans to sell or dispose of all or part of"
Shearson.</p>
<p>In late January and February, American Express discussed
merging Shearson with Primerica Corp.'s Smith Barney, Harris
Upham & Co. unit. Shearson and American Express previously
said the talks with Primerica, run by a former Shearson
chairman, Sanford Weill, were terminated.</p>
<p>Shearson is engaged in a big retrenchment and
reorganization effort. The firm has announced the closing and
consolidation of 67 U.S. branch offices, 2,000 layoffs, a
slashing of advertising expenses, and the sale of
"nonessential corporate assets," including aircraft, artwork
and its Beaver Creek, Colo., ski resort, built for $25
million. (Shearson said it is still accepting bids for the
resort.)</p>
<p>Shearson also will soon change its name back to Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc., as it attempts to recapture some past
glory by emphasizing the Lehman Brothers name left over from
its 1984 acquisition of Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb Inc.</p>
<p>The new proxy statement says that Shearson returned to
profitability for the two months ended May 31, and that the
firm "expects to be profitable for the entire second quarter
of 1990." Shearson had a $915 million first-quarter loss, a
record deficit for any quarter, mostly attributable to its
retrenchment costs but also because of operating losses.</p>
<p>The proxy statement says Dillon, Read & Co., the
investment bank retained to advise Shearson on its merger
into American Express, was paid $2.5 million in fees, not
counting expenses.</p>
<p>Former President Gerald R. Ford, a Shearson director,
received $125,000 for consulting services in 1989 and will
receive the same amount in 1990, the proxy statement says.
Another director, Howard L. Clark, former chief executive
officer of American Express and father of Shearson Chairman
Howard L. Clark Jr., also received $125,000 in consulting
fees in 1989 and will receive the same amount this year.</p>
<p>Willkie Farr & Gallagher, Shearson's longtime law firm,
was paid $14 million for services during 1989, not including
certain investment banking fees. Willkie Farr partner Jack H.
Nusbaum is a Shearson director.</p>
