	<p class="article-leader">Datapoint Corp., citing continued depressed sales of its
computer systems, said it's laying off 91 employees effective
immediately.
   The layoffs at the San Antonio, Texas, headquarters
effectively close Datapoint's corporate sales efforts in the
U.S. The company now will rely on third-party resellers for
domestic sales, a company spokesman said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Earlier this week, the troubled computer and
communications concern lost an appeal in a
patent-infringement case brought against it by Northern
Telecom Inc. A company spokesman, however, said there wasn't
any connection between the layoffs and the appeal decision.</p>
<p>For its third quarter ended April 28, Datapoint reported a
loss of $8.4 million, or $1.07 a share, compared with a loss
of $21.3 million, or $2.35 a share, the year earlier.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Datapoint
shares closed yeserday at $2, down 12.5 cents.</p>
