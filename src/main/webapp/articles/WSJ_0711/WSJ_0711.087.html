	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Oki Electric Industry Co., a maker of
communications equipment, agreed to buy Technitron PLC of
Britain, a computer-printer marketing company, for #25
million ($45.2 million), company officials said, and a final
agreement is likely to be signed in August.
   Approval by Technitron shareholders is needed. The
proposed acquisition is part of Oki's plan to expand its
business in the European Community prior to the region's
market unification by the end of 1992. Technitron, which is
capitalized at #15 million and has about 500 employees, had
1989 sales of #77 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Since 1977, Technitron has marketed Oki's printers in
Britain, Italy and Scandinavia and these account for more
than 70% of Technitron's printer sales. The Technitron
purchase would enable Oki Electric to capture about 80% of
printer sales in Europe through its own marketing networks.
Oki already maintains three marketing units, one in Britain
and two in West Germany.</p>
