	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The two biggest U.S. stock exchanges will
launch systems for trading privately placed stocks and bonds,
in separate efforts to unseat the National Association of
Securities Dealers' new electronic Portal system.
   The American Stock Exchange, in a joint venture with
Reuters Holdings PLC, and the New York Stock Exchange are
each seeking to share in the expected boom in the $170
billion private-placement market.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The two stock exchanges are trying to catch up with the
NASD's Portal system. Launched last month, Portal was the
first out of the gate for trading privately placed stocks and
bonds that fall under the government's so-called Rule 144a
passed in April.</p>
<p>The stakes are high. Becoming the primary market for
privately placed securities, which are traded by large
institutions and exempted from normal disclosure
requirements, means more income in years to come, and an
avenue to more listings by foreign companies that are
expected to raise money in the U.S. in coming years.</p>
<p>Even more important, dominance in trading privately placed
securities would give the winning market an important
foothold in electronic stock trading for institutional
investors, clearly a growing trend in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Eventually, only one electronic system for trading private
placements will dominate, exchange officials agree.</p>
<p>"It will be difficult to have three formal controlled
markets," says Joseph Hardiman, president of the NASD.
Indeed, Mr. Hardiman sees Portal as a vindication of the
electronic trading system his Nasdaq over-the-counter market
system has used for years for publicly traded stocks.</p>
<p>"Increasingly, you are seeing the institutional market
move to a screen-based market -- whether it's trading
options, futures or ordinary shares," says Mr. Hardiman. "I
don't think that exchanges are going to fold up their tents.
But they will adapt to what the market is telling them."</p>
<p>Enacted by the Securities and Exchange Commission in
April, Rule 144a is designed to encourage capital raising and
trading in the private placement market. That market is
likely to be limited to several hundred large institutional
investors and several dozen investment banks. Small investors
don't qualify as participants under SEC rules.</p>
<p>But securities executives say that the separate challenges
from the Amex and the Big Board underscore some of the
drawbacks they see in the NASD's Portal, which stands for
Private Offerings, Resales and Trading through Automated
Linkages. Portal is an electronic billboard which allows
traders and institutions to advertise buying and selling
prices of privately placed stocks and bonds.</p>
<p>Since Portal went live June 15, the NASD has signed on
nearly 30 institutional investors and about 20 major
investment banks. So far, about 10,000 shares of stock have
traded on Portal, according to the NASD. Firms such as First
Boston Corp. and Goldman, Sachs & Co. are already making live
markets on Portal.</p>
<p>Monte E. Wetzler, a lawyer at Breed, Abbott & Morgan in
New York who has made a speciality of Rule 144a and its
implications, says: "Portal has been slower in getting out of
the box than people thought."</p>
<p>The Amex and Reuters hope to offer a more flexible system
that builds on Reuters' technology and huge share of
financial market data. By the first quarter of 1991, they
hope to have their "Situs" (System for Institutional Trading
of Unregistered Securities) trading system up and running.</p>
<p>Individuals familiar with Situs say Reuters's world-wide
securities data base, software capabilities, and links to big
investors through products such as Instinet, an electronic
trading system, could mount a powerful challenge to Portal.</p>
<p>Situs will be able to show exchange rates, home-market
prices for a stock, and live U.S. quotes for the unregistered
security all on the same screen, according to people familiar
with the system. Like Portal, Situs will have an automatic
execution system.</p>
<p>Individuals familiar with the talks said that Instinet and
Reuters's U.S. subsidiary have approved of the Situs project,
but the matter is awaiting final approval by senior Reuters
executives in England.</p>
<p>American Stock Exchange President James Jones says: "We
think our system will be superior to Portal. It's going to be
head-on competition. We will have better display, better
systems and better hardware."</p>
<p>What the Amex doesn't have, however, is Portal's head
start, which the NASD is trying to solidify by not charging
any fees to use the system now. And NASD officials say they
can upgrade Portal to match efforts by competitors.</p>
<p>Big Board President Richard Grasso won't discuss details
of the exchange's own private placement trading system. He
says the exchange is studying Portal and is waiting for the
Amex system, with the hopes of improving on both.</p>
<p>"I don't think there is an insurmountable competitive
advantage {the NASD} gains by being up," Mr. Grasso says.
"Being late may be advantageous."</p>
<p>The Big Board says that if there is enough institutional
demand, it could have a system on trading desks around the
country by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Trading executives say the Big Board's name will be a
powerful marketing tool with foreign issuers. They note, too,
that an unregistered securities trading system would be the
third major recent effort by the Big Board to cater to large
institutions. The others are the exchange's stock basket
product and planned after-hours trading.</p>
