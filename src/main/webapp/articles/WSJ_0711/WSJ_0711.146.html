	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Yields on certificates of deposit at major
banks and brokerage firms were mixed in the week ended
Tuesday.
   Average yields on small-denomination CDs sold directly by
banks were flat to slightly lower. The average yield on a
six-month consumer CD remained at 7.64%, while one-year CDs
slipped to 7.82% from 7.83%, according to an 18-bank survey
by Banxquote Money Markets, a New York information service.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Average yields on small-denomination CDs sold by leading
broker-dealers were up slightly. Average yields on one-year
CDs rose to 8.19% from 8.15%, while average yields on
two-year CDs rose to 8.32% from 8.22%, according to
Banxquote.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, average yields for large-denomination CDs,
which typically require deposits of $90,000 or more, were
also up slightly. Average yields on one-year jumbo CDs rose
to 7.93% from 7.88%, while five-year maturities climbed to
8.23% from 8.20%.</p>
<p>The increase in yields on broker-sold and
large-denomination CDs was in response to a slight rise in
Treasury yields last week, said Norberto Mehl, chairman of
Banxquote. Big brokerage firms usually negotiate rates with
banks and thrifts whose CDs they sell; banks tend to adjust
yields more quickly on jumbo CDs in response to changes in
Treasury bill yields because they compete for the same
insitutional money.</p>
