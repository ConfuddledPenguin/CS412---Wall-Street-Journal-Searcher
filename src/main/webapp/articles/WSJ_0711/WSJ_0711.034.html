	<p class="article-leader">Dorothy Rabinowitz's well-researched article on the
continuing popularity of the World War II television
documentaries (Leisure & Arts, June 18) confirms the
impression one gets on scanning daily TV listings. And her
analysis of what lies behind the phenomenon is certainly
correct. We wonder, however, if one couldn't take it a step
further.
   World War II was undoubtedly America's finest hour,
certainly in this century. The courage we displayed in
response to treacherous and unprovoked attack, the industrial
genius that permitted the war to be pursued on the vast scale
necessitated by global fronts, the relative cheerfulness of
the civilian public in accepting the sacrifices imposed on
them, the myriad acts of heroism, individual and collective,
by our land, sea and air forces as they pushed the war to
victory and, perhaps most important, the generosity America
displayed toward its defeated enemies -- all this is
something to look back upon with appropriate pride, with
swelling heart and filling eye, America at its very best.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But alas, it all happened nearly half a century ago, and
there has been little in our history since then to excite our
pride to anything like that degree, and much to be ashamed
of. No wonder we want to see the pictures and hear the words
over and over again.</p>
<p>Does an analogy suggest itself? To the stock figure of the
broken-down prizefighter or the has-been entertainer getting
out his scrapbooks and poring over the old pictures and press
notices by the hour and endlessly telling anybody who will
listen the story of his triumphs long ago?</p>
<p>It's a chilling thought.</p>
