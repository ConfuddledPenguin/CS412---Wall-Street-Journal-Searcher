	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- DRT International, an accounting firm whose
affiliates include Deloitte & Touche, said its British member
firm, Touche Ross & Co., will merge with the U.K. practice of
Spicer & Oppenheim.
   The combination, planned for Aug. 1, would create
Britain's fifth-largest accounting firm, moving Touche from
sixth place and Spicer from ninth place. The resulting firm,
which will retain the Touche Ross & Co. name, will have
annual fees of more than #262 million ($473.7 million.)</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A spokesman for DRT in New York said the merger of the
firms "significantly strengthens" its operations in Britain.
DRT says it is the world's third-largest accounting group,
with annual fee income of $3.68 billion.</p>
<p>DRT was formed after the merger last year of the U.S.
accounting firms Deloitte, Haskins & Sells and Touche Ross &
Co. Deloitte & Touche is the third-largest U.S. accounting
firm. Some international affiliates of the accounting firms,
including the British firm of Deloitte Haskins & Sells,
declined to participate in the world-wide merger. Although
Britain's Touche Ross kept its DRT affiliation, the British
Deloitte Haskins affiliate merged instead with the U.K.
affiliate of Coopers & Lybrand, resulting in the largest U.K.
accounting firm.</p>
<p>"Deloitte & Touche had a big hole there {Britain} after
Deloitte Haskins jumped to Coopers," said Arthur W. Bowman,
editor of Bowman's Accounting Report. Mr. Bowman speculated
that some European partners may have "rebelled" against what
they could have viewed as the domination of the practice by
U.S. partners.</p>
<p>Touche Ross officials, while conceding the firm would have
ranked in first or second place in Britain if Deloitte
Haskins had participated in the world-wide merger, maintained
Touche has been courting Spicer & Oppenheim in Britain for
the past 10 years. "They are one of the city of London's
best-known names," said George Westropp, a Touche Ross
partner. He said Spicer & Oppenheim, whose clients include
many investment firms, has been hurt by the slump in the
financial district in the past year. "They felt they had a
need to belong to a bigger firm," he said.</p>
