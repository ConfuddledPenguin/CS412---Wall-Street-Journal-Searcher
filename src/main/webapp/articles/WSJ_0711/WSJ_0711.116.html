	<p class="article-leader">SunTrust Banks Inc., Atlanta, reported a 3% increase in
second-quarter net income, to $88.5 million, or 69 cents a
share, reflecting an additional provision in its loan-loss
reserve.
   In 1989's second quarter, SunTrust had net of $85.9
million, or 66 cents a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As reported, a special examination by the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency prompted the banking company to
provide loan-loss reserves of $64.6 million for the quarter.
That figure is $24.8 million more than the 1989 second
quarter and $26.6 million more than the 1990 first quarter.</p>
<p>SunTrust said the negative effect of the additional
provision on earnings was partially offset by two unrelated
purchase accounting adjustments on earlier acquisitions
totaling about $19 million.</p>
<p>The company, which has $31.3 billion in assets, said
nonperforming assets totaled $503 million as of June 30,
compared with $296.3 million a year earlier. The most recent
figure includes $322.1 million in problem loans.</p>
<p>For the first six months of the year, net rose 3.8% to
$176.4 million, or $1.38 a share, from $169.9 million, or
$1.31 a share, the year earlier.</p>
