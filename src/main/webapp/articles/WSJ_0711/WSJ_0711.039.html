	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Senate Armed Services Committee today
begins drafting a $289 billion defense-spending bill that
would slash at least 100,000 active-duty troops in 1991 while
rejecting Pentagon proposals for comparable cuts in reserve
forces over the next few years.
   The committee also is expected to avoid wholesale
termination of new multibillion-dollar weapons, keeping alive
such controversial programs as the Air Force's B-2 Stealth
bomber, the Navy's expensive Seawolf submarine, and a group
of sophisticated aircraft still under development.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Final details, however, won't be worked out until the
budget summit between Congress and the White House winds down
and the House Armed Services Committee has had its chance to
chop away at uniformed strength and cherished Pentagon
weapons plans in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Meeting behind closed doors, members of the Senate panel
are expected to approve about $289 billion in
military-spending authority for the fiscal year starting Oct.
1. That level, $18 billion less than President Bush's January
budget request, is the one advocated by Chairman Sam Nunn
(D., Ga.), who is one of the leading lawmakers seeking
gradual cuts.</p>
<p>But in an unusual procedure, the committee is expected to
map out at least $4 billion more in contingency cuts --
including the elimination of an additional 30,000 or so
troops next year -- reflecting the likelihood that greater
Pentagon sacrifices will be part of any summit agreement with
the White House.</p>
<p>Defense Secretary Dick Cheney cut short an official trip
to Europe to attend another meeting of the budget summiteers
here today, although spokesmen said Mr. Cheneny didn't have
any plans to submit revised spending figures to the group.</p>
<p>The committee's action will be the opening salvo of what
is certain to be an emotional and drawn-out congressional
debate pitting Sen. Nunn and other Pentagon supporters
against an increasingly powerful bipartisan coalition
determined to gut some of the military's most expensive
research and procurement programs. Depending on how the
budget summit ends, fights over many of the cuts may have to
be repeated on the Senate floor.</p>
<p>By voting out a bill before the budget summit concludes,
Sen. Nunn and his allies apparently hope to take the
initiative away from lawmakers who advocate deeper cuts. The
strategy, according to Senate aides and defense officials, is
to draw a line in the sand and demonstrate how much pain even
the committee's cuts would cause the Pentagon.</p>
<p>Still, the Senate bill is bound to be more favorable to
the Pentagon than the measure taking shape on the other side
of Capitol Hill. House Democratic leaders, for example,
advocate substantially deeper cuts that Secretary Cheney
complains could force more than 700,000 active-duty troops
and some 500,000 reserves off the Pentagon's payroll by the
late 1990s. Currently, there are about 2.1 million
active-duty troops and 1.1 million reserves.</p>
<p>In a series of speeches earlier this year, Sen. Nunn
emphasized that he would strongly oppose such hefty personnel
cuts, especially in reserve units that are less expensive to
maintain than active-duty forces and often are viewed as
important parts of the local community. "The presumption,"
Sen. Nunn argued in one of the speeches, should be to
transfer "as much capability into reserve {forces} as
possible in this new era."</p>
<p>Sen. John Glenn (D., Ohio), chairman of the manpower
subcommittee, also has come out strongly against cutbacks in
the National Guard and Army reserves, according to Pentagon
officials and committee aides. As a result, these officials
said, the Senate panel is expected to approve only marginal
reductions in 1991 reserve strength. Pentagon officials are
struggling to finish a comprehensive study on the
responsibilities reserve units should assume, but the
congressionally mandated report won't be available until well
after both committees finish work on Pentagon spending bills.</p>
<p>In weapons-buying accounts, the Senate panel is expected
to reject administration proposals to aggressively develop
both the multiple-warhead MX missile and the smaller
Midgetman missile. The committee also is expected to trim
requests to build a new generation of attack helicopters and
combat vehicles for the Army, scale back purchases of
guided-missile destroyers by the Navy, and cap research
funding for the Strategic Defense Initiative, a proposed
space-based anti-missile system, at less than $3.5 billion.</p>
<p>Mr. Cheney still hasn't announced the results of his own
reassessment of SDI, the Army's LH helicopter program and the
Navy's overall submarine and ship-buying plans.</p>
