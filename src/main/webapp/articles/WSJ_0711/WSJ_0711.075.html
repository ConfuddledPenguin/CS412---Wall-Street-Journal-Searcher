	<p class="article-leader">A federal jury in Birmingham, Ala., found USX Corp. guilty
of 14 criminal counts in connection with a conspiracy to
unfairly influence a labor contract in 1983.
   The Pittsburgh-based energy and steel concern, which faces
maximum fines of $4.1 million, said it was "extremely
disappointed" and plans to appeal the verdict to the U.S.
Court of Appeals.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Two United Steelworkers union officials, E.B. Rich, 60
years old, and Thermon Phillips, 62, were also convicted.
Messrs. Rich and Phillips each were found guilty of two
counts, including conspiracy and violation of a provision of
the Taft-Hartley Act barring union representatives from
taking something of value from an employer. They each face up
to 10 years in prison and $500,000 in fines.</p>
<p>The verdicts in the 14-week trial came after two weeks of
jury deliberations.</p>
<p>The only USX official indicted, former top labor
negotiator J. Bruce Johnston, has yet to face trial on a
four-count indictment, according to a spokesman at the U.S.
attorney's office.</p>
<p>USX said it believes there was "clear error in the conduct
of the trial which will lead to a reversal of the verdicts."
The company added that it believes the "indictments and
verdicts were the products of strained and erroneous
interpretations of complex statutes."</p>
<p>The company said it continues to believe that its officers
and employees acted properly throughout the events prior to
and following the Fairfield Works labor contract of 1983.</p>
<p>Sentencing is scheduled for Aug. 20 before U.S. Judge E.B.
Haltom.</p>
<p>The case stemmed from 1983 labor negotiations when USX,
then U.S. Steel Corp., sought substantial concessions from
steelworkers to reopen its idled Fairfield works near
Birmingham.</p>
<p>The U.S. attorney's office said evidence showed that USX
and Mr. Phillips, district director of the United
Steelworkers, and Mr. Rich, sub-director of the union,
conspired to violate the Taft-Hartley Act. One of the
purposes of the act is to eliminate practices that might
impair the impartiality of union representatives or corrupt
collective bargaining.</p>
<p>Specifically, the government said USX influenced the two
men by arranging for their pensions to be enriched beyond
what they would have received as regular company employees.
For instance, Mr. Rich received a pension based on 30.9 years
of service while he had actually worked only 13 years for the
company. Mr. Phillips received a pension based on 37.75 years
of employment while he had only worked at the company for
five years, between 1946 and 1951.</p>
<p>The case against Mr. Johnston, who faces charges of
violating federal law by concealing information about the
pension change and failing to inform employees about it, is
expected to receive a boost from the USX verdict.</p>
<p>In addition, 38 Fairfield workers filed suit in 1988 to
recover income they lost as a result of what they consider an
illegal pact. Their case may also receive a boost from
yesterday's verdict.</p>
<p>The union said it expects the convictions to be overturned
on appeal. The union said the trial was marked by error and
that testimony that was barred "would have shown that the
pension arrangements at issue were widespread in American
industry, served proper labor-relations purposes and never
had been regarded as unlawful by the Department of Labor."</p>
<p>The case may influence events far beyond the courtroom.
The Steelworkers union suffered a sharp decline in membership
during the 1980s as steel companies closed plants,
streamlined and laid off thousands of members. The union
began trying to organize smaller plants and businesses in the
service industry to make up for those losses.</p>
<p>Yesterday's verdict, however, could damage the union's
reputation and its credibility as a representative of
workers. Even before the verdict, anti-union groups were
pinning articles about the case on company bulletin boards to
thwart union organizing attempts.</p>
<p>USX, for its part, has traditionally been a tough
negotiator with the steelworkers. The two are to begin
negotiations by the end of this year on a new national
contract. Most other major steelmakers negotiated pacts last
year, and USX officials have called them too generous. The
combination of a union seeking to regain credibility damaged
by the verdict, and a company pledged to maintain a hard line
could lead to rancor in those talks.</p>
