	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Boys and young men who emulate their baseball
heroes by chewing tobacco risk developing mouth sores, dental
problems and perhaps even cancer, a new report says.
   In a study of 1,109 major and minor league baseball
players, health researchers found that nearly half of
frequent users of smokeless tobacco developed white,
callus-type sores on their gums. Such players were also more
likely than those who didn't use the smokeless tobacco to
have other gum problems that could ultimately lead to loss of
teeth later in life.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The study, published in today's Journal of the American
Medical Association, adds to growing concern about the health
effects of smokeless tobacco -- including chewing tobacco and
snuff -- and increasing use of the products by children.</p>
<p>"The players know in general that it has bad health
effects," says Deborah G. Grady, assistant professor of
epidemiology and medicine at the University of California at
San Francisco, and a co-author of the study. "A lot of young
boys emulate them and they're concerned about that."</p>
<p>About 75% of the players in the study used snuff; other
players used a coarser wad of chewing tobacco.</p>
<p>The researchers didn't uncover any evidence of cancer
among the players, most of whom were between 20 and 29 years
old. But other studies have linked long-term use of snuff in
particular with oral cancer, Dr. Grady says.</p>
