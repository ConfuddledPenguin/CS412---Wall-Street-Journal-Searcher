	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- Flexing its recently expanded muscles, France's
securities market watchdog ordered Bernard Tapie Finance S.A.
shares suspended from trading because the company hasn't
adequately informed investors about its plan to acquire
Adidas AG.
   Mr. Tapie's company, which is nearly 60% controlled by the
French financier personally, responded by saying it would
release details of its takeover plans, and its partners, next
Monday. The company said it was making the announcement to
quiet talk about "the alleged trouble we are having putting
together a group of backers to help us finance Adidas."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Tapie still refuses to say how much he is paying for
the 80% stake in the sporting goods giant that he has agreed
to buy from West Germany's Dassler family. But his
announcement said that when the takeover price is disclosed,
it would be clear that worries over his ability to finance
the purchase are "ridiculous."</p>
<p>The financier didn't say which banks are helping provide
funds, but said that contrary to press reports no bank has
yet refused to back him. He told a radio interviewer that he
had signed a secrecy agreement with the Dasslers, but his
statement later said that Adidas had "authorized" him to
release information Monday.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the French markets regulator, the
Commission des Operations de Bourse, said the agency has
rarely ordered a share suspension for lack of proper
financial information, a power it gained as part of expanded
authority granted by the government earlier this year.</p>
<p>"Market regulations clearly require every quoted company
to give prompt information about any event that will change
its financial situation," the spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>She said it isn't clear how Mr. Tapie is making the
acquisition or which Tapie-controlled company would end up
holding his Adidas stake. Until Mr. Tapie publishes such
information, the spokeswoman said, his company's shares, and
the shares of its two quoted subsidiaries, industrial
scalemakers Terraillon S.A. and Testut S.A., will be
suspended from trading.</p>
<p>Before promising to release information, Mr. Tapie had
made his own request for a trading suspension -- until Aug.
11. His company explained that West Germany's Cartel Office,
which must approve major takeovers, has until then to rule on
the Adidas acquisition.</p>
<p>The commission spokeswoman said that it was a highly
unusual request, but that she didn't have an official
reaction.</p>
<p>The controversy is typical of the 47-year-old Mr. Tapie, a
flamboyant former television personality and singer who has
made a specialty of rescuing troubled companies. He long has
enjoyed making surprise announcements and unexpectedly
changing his position. Since acquiring control of the
Marseilles soccer team in the mid-1980s and then launching a
career as a left-wing member of the French Parliament in
1988, he has been increasingly in the public eye.</p>
