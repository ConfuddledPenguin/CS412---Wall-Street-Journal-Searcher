	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Reflecting a steady uptrend, orders for machinery
received by Japanese manufacturers in May climbed 13.4% from
a year earlier to 1.658 trillion yen ($250.7 million), the
Economic Planning Agency announced.
   Orders dipped 0.2% last December, interrupting the
increase that started in October 1988, but they have been
rising again each month since the beginning of 1990.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The sustained increase is evidence of Japanese
corporations' desires to modernize, in anticipation of better
business in the future, officials said.</p>
<p>The latest gain was also attributed to the fact that the
government, having failed to pass its fiscal 1989 budget
through parliament in time, held down orders in May 1989.</p>
