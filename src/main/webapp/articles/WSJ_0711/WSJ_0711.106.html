	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is
considering filing civil charges against President Bush's son
Neil and other former officials of a Colorado thrift, but a
final decision hasn't been made yet, an agency spokesman
said.
   Neil Bush, a Denver oil businessman, was an outside
director of Silverado Banking Savings & Loan Association,
which failed in late 1988 at an expected cost to the
government of $1 billion. The Office of Thrift Supervision
has charged him in an administrative action with violating
conflict-of-interest rules as a Silverado director. Mr. Bush
has denied any wrongdoing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The FDIC routinely files civil charges against directors
and officers of failed institutions, as well as outside
attorneys and accountants, in cases where the government bank
and thrift insurance funds suffer a loss. The agency
typically brings charges of negligence and breach of
fiduciary duty to the institution, seeking to cover its
losses. Banks and thrifts usually carry insurance for their
officers and directors to protect them from such suits.</p>
<p>ABC News reported last night that the FDIC is about to
file a $200 million civil suit against Mr. Bush and other
former Silverado officials, but the FDIC spokesman, said "no
final decision" has been made on whether to bring a suit.
High-level officials at the FDIC confirmed that a final
decision hasn't been made, but one person said a decision
"isn't too far off."</p>
