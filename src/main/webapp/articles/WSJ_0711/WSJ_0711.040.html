   You're Right -- It's Unmentionable</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">Regarding your June 12 editorial "Unmentionable
Prescription": In your unending crusade for a reduction in
the current capital-gains tax rate, you are now claiming that
as the result of such a move "Real-estate values would
improve overnight . . . since the unmentionable prescription
would lower a tax on potential gains." Well, maybe, but
probably not. Even less well conceived is the idea that "The
tax was . . . lower when the properties . . . were initially
purchased; their current low values . . . reflect a higher
tax."
   During the early 1980s, the real-estate industry convinced
the Reagan administration and Congress that a quick tax fix
for high interest rates was both fair and necessary. The
exact rules changed several times over the next few years,
but by the time of the 1986 Tax Reform Act, real property
investors were depreciating their appreciating holdings over
15 years at accelerated rates. The resulting annual "tax
savings" were at income-tax rates that, I'm sure you will
remember, were 50% at that time, not 28%. The most egregious
cases of legal tax abuse came with limited partnerships,
through which limited partners did no work but saved taxes,
and general partners earned high fees and supposedly managed
property.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>I doubt that the capital-gains tax was even considered by
many real-estate investors, whose gaze was fixed on all those
immediate deductions. If they had considered the long-run
consequences they would have realized that the capital-gains
tax on depreciable assets is applied not to the gain in price
but to the difference between the net sales price and the
depreciated book value. Whether the rate is 20% or 28%
matters less than the fact that the amount taxed is the
entire value of the property after 15 years. But after all,
what the tax man has given, the tax man can take away. You
only get to "save taxes" once.</p>
<p>Naturally, the short-term quick tax fix led to
overbuilding, poor management decisions, outrageous fee
schedules and poorly conceived projects. The industry is
paying for the previous "prescription" now with high vacancy
rates, useless projects, and a severely constrained lending
industry that lost sight of its own need to evaluate projects
for realistic income potential, as well as tax saving.</p>
<p>A return to a 20% capital-gains rate has not been
necessary to increasing prices in the stock market and will
do nothing for the real-estate market. High vacancy rates,
abandoned projects, changing demographics and a
still-reeling, blind-sided lending industry are real economic
problems that will not respond to another quick-tax-fix
prescription.</p>

<p>You are right on the mark when you say that in order to
pump some life into the nation's sluggish economy "we need .
. . a policy that would increase the values of real estate. .
. ." After all, the real-estate and construction industries
are the largest sector of our economy.</p>
<p>However, your prescription -- cut the capital-gains tax --
would be only a good left jab. In order to knock the problem
out, it would have to be followed by an overhand right --
namely, slash interest rates. This would allow more buyers
into the market and reduce the carrying costs for investors
and developers.</p>
<p>At their current levels, interest rates are simply too
high to make real-estate projects feasible; thus,
construction is grinding to a halt. It is no coincidence that
Japan, which until recently has had very low interest rates,
also has the highest real-estate values in the world.</p>
