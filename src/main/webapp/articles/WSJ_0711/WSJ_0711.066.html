	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- In this year's battle over the budget, the
top rate is rapidly becoming the bottom line.
   Democrats say basic fairness demands that the top income
tax rate on high-income Americans be raised from its current
28% to at least 33% -- especially if President Bush insists
on cutting the tax rate on capital gains. But many
Republicans are equally adamant in their opposition to such a
move, defending the 28% top rate as the Holy Grail of
Reaganomics.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The controversial issue could well be the downfall of the
budget talks. On the other hand, if one side capitulates or a
compromise is reached, it could be the key decision that
allows a massive tax-increase bill to become law.</p>
<p>Inside the Bush administration, the issue is sparking
intense debate. Publicly, administration officials all say
they oppose any effort to raise the top rate. But privately,
opinions are split.</p>
<p>Some top administration officials have expressed a
willingness to compromise on the rate issue -- provided
Congress agrees to the other key elements of a budget
package. But White House Chief of Staff John Sununu is
adamantly opposed to any effort to touch the top rate.</p>
<p>On Capitol Hill, the battle lines are even more firmly
cast. Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) of the House Ways
and Means Committee says anything less than a 33% top rate
"is something that the Democrats have to walk away ashamed
of."</p>
<p>Indeed, many even say tax rates must go higher than 33% to
penalize the very wealthy who were the prime beneficiaries of
the tax cuts of the Reagan years. "I've got a Democratic
caucus that wants a 36% rate," Mr. Rostenkowski says.</p>
<p>But Sen. Robert Packwood of Oregon, like many other
Republicans, says he is "unalterably opposed" to raising the
rates. Sen. Packwood, the top Republican on the Senate
Finance Committee, adds that if negotiators at the budget
summit can't find an alternative to raising the top rate,
which was just lowered a few years ago, "then we're out of
luck."</p>
<p>At the heart of the controversy is an anomaly of the 1986
Tax Reform Act known as the "bubble." That provision requires
high-income taxpayers to pay a 5% surtax on certain portions
of their income. The purpose of the surtax is to nullify the
benefit these taxpayers get from the personal exemption and
the lower, 15% tax rate.</p>
<p>For a married couple without children, the surtax kicks in
when taxable income reaches $78,400, and kicks off after
income exceeds $185,730. For taxpayers whose income falls
within this "bubble" range, the marginal rate -- that is, the
rate on each additional dollar earned -- is 33%.</p>
<p>In recent years, the bubble has been a target of heavy
criticism among Democrats, who complain it's unfair for
couples earning less than $185,730 a year to pay a higher
marginal tax rate than those earning more, who pay only 28%
on each additional dollar.</p>
<p>To solve this anomaly, Democrats want to add a new top tax
rate of 33%. That would be a tax increase for the 600,000
Americans now above the bubble range, raising $3.8 billion
for the government in the first year and nearly $42 billion
over five years.</p>
<p>As a compromise, some administration officials have
discussed a plan that would eliminate the bubble by adding a
new, 31% tax rate. The result would be a tax increase for
couples earning more than $185,730 a year, but also a small
tax cut for those in the bubble range. There would be no
change in government revenue, allowing the president to claim
he didn't raise income taxes.</p>
<p>The compromise proposal has some support among
Republicans, since those receiving tax cuts would outnumber
those receiving tax increases by seven to one. "I have to see
the whole package," says Rep. Rod Chandler (R., Wash.). "But
that's a reasonable idea. I am kind of impressed."</p>
<p>For other Republicans, however, such tinkering with the
top rate is heresy. "I could not sign onto anything that
raises the rates," says Sen. Packwood. White House Chief of
Staff Sununu apparently agrees, and privately has even
suggested bursting the bubble by eliminating the surtax and
imposing instead a solid top rate of 28%.</p>
<p>In response to such hard-fought positions, White House and
congressional tax experts are toying with a variety of other
options to hit the rich without raising rates. One idea,
mentioned in private talks by Mr. Sununu, would limit the
deduction for state income taxes to a specific number, say
$15,000 a year. Other ideas would limit the deductions to a
percentage of adjusted gross income or subtract a given
amount from total deductions.</p>
<p>The problem with such formulations is that they would
effectively reduce some of the most politically sacred
deductions in the tax code, such as the mortgage-interest
deduction, the charitable deduction and the deduction for
state and local income taxes.</p>
<p>In some ways, the issue is more symbol than substance.
Fewer than five million of the nation's about 110 million
taxpayers -- or less than 5% -- would be affected by any
change in the top rate. What's more, under the current system
no taxpayer ultimately has to pay more than 28% of his or her
income in taxes -- even those in the bubble whose top
marginal rate is 33%.</p>
<p>"I think it's really mostly aesthetics," says Joseph
Minarik, executive director of the congressional Joint
Economic Committee. "Some people will see it and have some
discomfort about it. But I don't think the bubble is worth
bleeding and dying over."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, many Democrats are determined to stake their
claim on the issue. In their view, the bubble is a symbol of
the tax policies of the Reagan years, when the top tax rate
on high-income Americans dropped from 70% to 28% -- reducing
the progressiveness of the tax system. They see President
Bush's proposal to cut the capital-gains tax rate as yet
another giveaway to the rich.</p>
<p>At best, Democrats say they are determined to make certain
the tax bill of 1990 doesn't continue the Reagan trend. "If
you are going to have a big tax increase this year," says
James Wetzler, New York state tax commissioner and an adviser
to New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, "the upper income people ought
to pay something."</p>
