	<p class="article-leader">EDISON, N.J. -- Engelhard Corp. said it ended negotiations
to sell its world-wide gold and silver businesses to Degussa
AG because "acceptable terms" couldn't be reached.
   Engelhard, a specialty chemical concern, said it won't try
to find another buyer for the whole group of gold and silver
businesses. Instead, it will keep the European segment and
attempt to sell the less profitable North American
operations.</p>
