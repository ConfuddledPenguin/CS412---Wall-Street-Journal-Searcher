	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The dollar fell broadly against all major
foreign currencies amid expectations of higher Japanese
interest rates and a stronger yen.
   The dollar's weakness helped kill an early-morning rise in
bond prices. Stocks fell under the weight of last-minute sell
programs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 23.27
points to close at 2890.84 in moderate trading.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The drop in the dollar stemmed directly from rumors out of
Washington and Houston, site of the economic summit, that the
Group of Seven major industrial nations favors a strong yen
and a stable mark. The dollar fell to 148.30 yen from 151.15
yen in late New York trading Monday, breaking through the
psychologically important level of 150 yen. The dollar
dropped to 1.6425 marks from 1.6530 marks.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Mondschein, managing director of foreign exchange
at Continental Bank, said the prospect of higher Japanese
rates made it hard for the dollar to gain any ground against
other currencies, especially in the absence of any hope for
easing interest rates elsewhere overseas.</p>
<p>"Yields from holding foreign investments right now are far
superior" to those on dollar investments, Mr. Mondschein
said, and the expectation that the underlying foreign
currencies will appreciate only adds to the appeal.</p>
<p>The rumor of an imminent rise in Japanese rates was "the
one the currency market latched onto," said Nicholas Sargen,
an analyst at Salomon Brothers. "The trigger mechanism is
that there is an economic summit going on, which lends
credence to any rumor, no matter how erroneous."</p>
<p>Not that Mr. Sargen doubts the possibility of higher
interest rates in Japan. A more likely reason to suspect such
a move, he said, is that the overnight money rate in Japan
crept up at the end of June. Japan's central bank now may be
contemplating a rate boost because of a continuing stream of
evidence that Japan's domestic economy isn't slowing down, he
said.</p>
<p>The latest number, released early in the day, showed that
machinery orders in Japan, an indicator of economic growth,
were up 13.4% in May from a year ago.</p>
<p>The retreat in the dollar was bad news for U.S. bonds,
said Philip Braverman, chief economist at DKB Securities
Corp., "because it creates a potential loss for foreign
buyers." But he said a successful auction of Resolution
Funding Corp. bonds late in the day bolstered hopes that the
bond market is poised to improve.</p>
<p>Stock prices fell on volume of 147.6 million shares in New
York Stock Exchange trading. Declining issues far outnumbered
advancers, 969 to 529.</p>
<p>Bond prices fell about a quarter of a point, or about
$2.50 for each $1,000 face amount. The yield on the
Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose to 8.56%.</p>
