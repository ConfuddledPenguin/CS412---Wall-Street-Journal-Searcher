	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- In a bid for cleaner air, United Parcel
Service Inc. said it will convert 20 of its trucks here to
run on natural gas within the next year.
   United Parcel Service is running the test program in
conjunction with Southern California Gas Co. If the program
goes smoothly, UPS said it will consider converting the rest
of its Los Angeles fleet of more than 2,000 trucks to natural
gas.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Southern California Gas said vehicles powered by natural
gas emit 65% less ozone-forming pollutants than those using
gasoline and other fuels.</p>
<p>UPS has had a similar test program with Brooklyn Union Gas
Co. involving ten trucks in the New York area for more than a
year. "That's going extremely well and that's why we thought
we could expand into Los Angeles," said Siro DeGasperis, a
spokesman for Greenwich, Conn.-based UPS. "The emissions have
been significantly reduced and the things we feared, such as
loss of power, didn't materialize."</p>
<p>As part of the test program, Southern California Gas will
provide the natural gas and both companies will share the
cost of the conversion equipment for the trucks. A spokesman
for the utility said there are currently about 30,000
vehicles in the U.S. which run on natural gas. Most of those
are owned by gas utilities.</p>
