	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Molson Cos. said it plans to raise 300 million
Canadian dollars (US$259.3 million) through an equity and
debt issue in order to finance expansion of its current
businesses.
   Molson said it will issue four million Class A nonvoting
shares at C$37.625 each to the Canadian public, as well as
C$150 million of one-year floating-rate redeemable
debentures.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Two Toronto-based securities dealers, RBC Dominion
Securities Inc. and Gordon Capital Corp., agreed to lead the
underwriting group for the equity issue and to buy the
debentures, Molson said.</p>
<p>Analysts described the issue as essentially a two-stage
equity offering, because Molson can require that debenture
holders redeeming the securities apply the proceeds to
purchase Class A shares, at a price based on trading prices
at the time of redemption. Molson said it can redeem the
debentures any time after Nov. 1, 1990.</p>
<p>Philip Koven, an analyst with Richardson Greenshields Inc.
in Toronto, said it's clear from the size and nature of the
offering that Molson is interested in expanding its brewing
interests.</p>
<p>Officials at Molson, which has interests in brewing,
specialty chemicals, retailing, and sports and entertainment,
declined to say which of these areas the company is seeking
to expand.</p>
<p>Marshall Cohen, Molson's president and chief executive
officer, said at the annual meeting last month that the
company will seek to reap further benefits from its links
with the Australian brewing concern Elders IXL. In August
1989, Molson and Elders merged their North American brewing
operations into a joint venture, Molson Breweries of Canada.</p>
<p>Mr. Cohen, who couldn't be reached for comment following
the announcement yesterday, said at the annual meeting that
the Elders' alliance "has provided us with an opportunity to
participate in the Foster's Brewing Group."</p>
<p>As reported, Elders proposed last March to restructure its
assets, turning the company known as Elders IXL into a
publicly traded brewing concern to be known as Foster's
Brewing Group Ltd.</p>
<p>Molson's move to raise financing has triggered speculation
that the company may use the funds to invest in Foster's
Brewing, possibly by buying shares held by closely held
Harlin Holdings Pty., which is closely associated with John
Elliott, Elders' chairman.</p>
<p>In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday,
Molson's Class A shares closed at C$37 a share, down C$1.625,
as investors reacted to the fear of diluted earnings. Molson
has about 22.7 million Class A shares outstanding and 10.2
million Class B shares.</p>
