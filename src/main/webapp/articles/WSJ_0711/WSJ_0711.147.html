	<p class="article-leader">A computer pioneer has formed a group to defend the civil
rights of hackers, computer users who are at the center of a
controversy over how best to crack down on electronic crime.
   Mitchell Kapor, creator of the single most popular program
for PCs, 1-2-3, and founder of Lotus Development Corp.,
yesterday unveiled the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which
is being underwritten by Mr. Kapor and Steve Wozniak,
cofounder of Apple Computer Inc. The group will assist in the
legal defense of hackers accused of crimes and will research
legal issues involving computer communications.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Kapor began his campaign on behalf of hackers in late
May, but with the exception of Mr. Wozniak, who no longer has
an active role in the industry, he has been unable to gain
broad support in the computer world. So far, many of the
industry's biggest names have decided against wading into the
controversy, including wealthy ex-hacker William Gates, now
chairman of Microsoft Corp. He considers the legal issues too
murky.</p>
<p>Mr. Kapor's defense of hackers -- who use their knowledge
of the intricacies of computer networks to enter, or "hack,"
forbidden databases -- comes in the wake of a series of
investigations into computer crime this year by the Secret
Service, which enforces federal laws in this area. The
biggest investigation, dubbed Operation Sun Devil, led to a
May 8 raid that resulted in five arrests and the seizure of
40 computers and 23,000 data-storage disks in 14 cities.</p>
<p>Mr. Kapor contends that the government's crackdown
threatens the rights of computer users and may stifle
creativity, saying that some teen hackers are going to become
"the technological innovators of tomorrow." Some prosecutors
disagree. Mr. Kapor's attitude is that "there's something
holy and sacred about computers that exempts those who use
them from ordinary rules," said Gail Thackeray, an attorney
with the state of Arizona.</p>
<p>Far from oppressing the inquisitive, the Secret Service
says it is simply cracking down on people who exploit
loopholes in computer security to steal credit card numbers
and charge thousands of dollars of goods and telephone
services. "These people are not the Lewis and Clarks of the
21st century," said Dale Boll, who runs the Secret Service's
fraud division.</p>
<p>Mr. Boll said that, among other things, the Secret Service
uncovered a plot to disrupt emergency telephone service in
nine states through the introduction of a virus, or
disruptive software program, into the computer system of
BellSouth Corp.</p>
<p>On Monday, three men -- said to be members of the Legion
of Doom, a loose association of about two dozen hackers from
around the country -- pleaded guilty in Atlanta to stealing
software and access codes from BellSouth. Ironically, the men
gained entry into BellSouth's sophisticated computer network
using an old-fashioned method: they found a telephone number
for a central computer in a company trash bin.</p>
<p>Despite the guilty pleas, the government is coming under
fire for failing to bring its cases to court more quickly.
Mr. Boll says it will be months before the government even
seeks indictments stemming from its May raids because the
Secret Service still must sift through huge amounts of
electronic evidence.</p>
<p>The delays frustrate people caught up in the May 8 raids,
some of whom vigorously protest their innocence. Steve
Jackson, who runs a games company in Austin, Texas, saw
Secret Service agents seize several personal computers and
business information on May 8, including the manuscript for a
fantasy game called "cyberpunk,"in which hackers wield power
through computers. It was six weeks before Mr. Jackson got
his equipment back, but by then the disruption had forced him
to lay off eight of his 17 employees, he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Jackson said he has never received an adequate
explanation of why his company was searched. The Secret
Service said the company was targeted because one of Mr.
Jackson's employees was being investigated.</p>
<p>Also troubling to Mr. Kapor is the closure of a
computerized bulletin board run by a University of Missouri
student, who was indicted in February on several counts of
interstate wire fraud and transportation of stolen property.</p>
<p>Mr. Kapor contends the closure of the bulletin board
amounts to a restraint on free speech, but the government
asserts that the student knowingly distributed stolen
information using the bulletin board.</p>
