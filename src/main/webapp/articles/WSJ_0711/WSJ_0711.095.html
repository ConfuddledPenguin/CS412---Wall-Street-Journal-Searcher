	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Labor Department today plans to announce
its first proposed requirements for motor-vehicle safety on
the job.
   The proposal, which would cover some 5.4 million employers
and 35 million workers, will take the department's
Occupational Safety and Health Administration beyond its
usual regulatory realm, largely reflecting OSHA chief Gerard
Scannell's zeal for tackling new areas.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It would mandate that employers require employees to
buckle safety belts in salesmen's cars, trucks, and other
vehicles equipped with belts; require motorcycle-delivery
people to use safety helmets; and set up training programs to
enhance certain aspects of safe vehicle operation. The rules
would apply to such jobs as salesmen and service people.</p>
<p>Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole has also seized on the plan
as a way to promote transportation-related safety. That's an
area in which she made a mark as transportation secretary six
years ago when she promulgated rules that led to widespread
state laws requiring auto safety belts to be buckled up. The
rules also led to current auto-industry moves to equip new
cars with automatically inflating air bags or so-called
automatically fastening "passive seatbelts."</p>
<p>She in fact picked today, the sixth anniversary of the
rule for belt laws and passive restraints, to announce the
new OSHA vehicle-safety push.</p>
<p>Mrs. Dole said in an interview that the passive-restraint
rule she issued in 1984 was a "necessary foundation" for the
new OSHA rule proposal. Since 1984, nationwide seatbelt use
has climbed to 46% from 14%, she said. She and Mr. Scannell
agreed early last year to push for the new federal standards.
Mr. Scannell instituted a similar program when he was safety
director at Johnson & Johnson and chairman of the National
Safety Council's motor-vehicle safety committee.</p>
<p>For both officials, the initiative is venturesome. John
Pendergrass, Mr. Scannell's predecessor as OSHA chief, had
rejected an NSC petition for such requirements, and insisted
that OSHA lacked authority to issue them.</p>
<p>Mrs. Dole said she has had a much easier job persuading
the White House Office of Management and Budget to accept the
new proposal than she had in trying to "break through the
palace guard" to persuade President Reagan and his OMB and
other White House staffers on the air-bag rule. While top
White House aides wanted to scrap any air-bag requirement in
1984, she reminded them that the Supreme Court had ruled the
Reagan administration's earlier rescinding of the requirement
to be illegal.</p>
<p>Now, she said, "it's a different climate" in the country.
This time, by contrast, the OMB not only went for the
workplace motor-vehicle idea, but even buttressed it by
helping insert the motorcycle-helmet requirement after OSHA
had gingerly raised the question, she and OSHA officials
said.</p>
<p>The OMB cited a Louisiana study showing that reinstatement
of the state's motorcycle-helmet law cut cyclist deaths
sharply. The issue has been controversial for many years,
with conservatives saying cyclists shouldn't be forced to use
helmets if they don't want to.</p>
<p>Mrs. Dole and OSHA noted that motor-vehicle accidents are
the largest single cause of workplace fatalities, accounting
for 36.5% of occupational deaths, with about 2,100 worker
motor-vehicle fatalities and 91,000 injuries resulting in
lost workdays a year. The rule will save more lives than all
other OSHA safety rules issued in the past decade combined,
Mrs. Dole said.</p>
<p>OSHA estimated that the proposed rule will save between
465 and 684 lives and prevent between 22,221 and 31,635
injuries annually, while costing employers $221 million a
year.</p>
<p>While some companies such as Johnson & Johnson, Du Pont
Co. and United Parcel Service of America Inc. already have
rather stringent worker motor-vehicle safety rules in effect,
the proposed OSHA requirements would cover 90% of the six
million companies the agency regulates. The rule would
embrace a wide range of vehicles, including cars used on the
job, forklift trucks, bulldozers, and many farm tractors,
though some of these are already covered by OSHA standards,
such as ones dealing with construction projects.</p>
<p>The proposal will also ask whether bicycles used on the
job, such as in making deliveries, should be covered, whether
vehicles that are unsafe because of poor maintenance should
be addressed, whether OSHA should move to require air bags in
worker-used cars; and whether vehicles without belts should
have to be refitted with belts.</p>
<p>OSHA is expected to take public comments on the proposal
for about 120 days. The agency also could decide to hold a
hearing late this year or early next year.</p>
