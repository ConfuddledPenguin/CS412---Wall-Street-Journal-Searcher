	<p class="article-leader">BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- Hilton Hotels Corp., feeling the
effects of new competitors in the Las Vegas, Nev., casino
market, reported a 9% drop in second-quarter earnings to
$38.2 million, or 79 cents a share, from $42 million or 87
cents a share a year earlier.
   Revenue for the hotel and casino company rose 3% to $273.8
million from $265 million a year earlier. Operating income
dropped 8% to $73.8 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Operating income from the casinos dropped 21% to $29
million for the quarter, while the hotel segment posted a 3%
increase in operating income to $44.8 million. Much of the
decline came from the Las Vegas Hilton, which reported an
unexpectedly sharp 56% decline in operating results.</p>
<p>Maurice Scanlon, Hilton's senior vice president-finance,
attributed part of the year-to-year decline at the Las Vegas
Hilton to a strong quarter a year earlier, and to a decrease
in wagers at table games. That stemmed largely from new
competitors, including Golden Nugget Inc.'s Mirage casino
resort.</p>
<p>For the six months, net income rose 15% to $63.3 million,
or $1.31 a share, from $55.1 million, or $1.14 a share, a
year earlier. Revenue rose 10% to $593.1 million from $490.1
million.</p>
