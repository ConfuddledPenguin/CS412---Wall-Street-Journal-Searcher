	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Dow Jones & Co. reported a 28% drop in
second-quarter net income, reflecting an earnings slump in
the publishing company's information services activities.
   Earnings fell to $34.9 million, or 35 cents a share, from
$48.4 million, or 48 cents a share, in the year-earlier
period. Revenue edged up to $441.6 million from $437.7
million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Operating income for Dow Jones's business publications
rose 7.5% to $37.6 million, despite flat revenue and a
decline in advertising linage. Business publications include
The Wall Street Journal, its overseas editions and Barron's
magazine.</p>
<p>At Dow Jones's information services group, however,
operating income slumped 53% to $27.6 million. Information
services consists of Telerate, which provides financial
market data via computer, as well as various database
packages and wire services.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Dow Jones common stock rose 37.5 cents to close at $23.50 a
share. The stock had sunk to a seven-year low of $21.50
earlier this month as securities analysts lowered their
earnings estimates in expectation that the information
services results would be weak.</p>
<p>Some analysts are concerned about Telerate's efforts to
establish a foreign-exchange trading service. That venture
ran up a pretax start-up loss of $51 million last year, when
it was 50%-owned by Telerate and 50%-owned by American
Telephone & Telegraph Co. Telerate and the currency-trading
service now are owned solely by Dow Jones. By setting up a
currency trading service, Telerate is competing with Reuters
Holdings PLC, which dominates the foreign-currency data
market.</p>
<p>A Dow Jones spokesman said the trading service's losses
are narrowing, but the service "isn't expected to be
profitable this year or next." The service's software is
being upgraded, he said, and developing a revenue base will
take time. "This is a long-term commitment by Dow Jones," he
added.</p>
<p>Dow Jones said Telerate's other North American business
was hurt by "retrenchments taking place at major Wall Street
investment firms and throughout the savings and loan
industry."</p>
<p>Dow Jones said its second-quarter earnings were reduced 12
cents a share by increased interest expense and good will
amortization charges relating to its January 1990 acquisition
of the 33% of Telerate that it didn't already own.</p>
<p>Dow Jones also said that "a significant reduction in the
rate of expense growth is expected in the second half in the
information services segment, notably at Telerate." It also
said Wall Street's retrenchment and its impact on revenue is
expected to continue.</p>
<p>In the second quarter, Ottaway Newspapers Inc., Dow
Jones's community newspapers unit, reported a 16% drop in
operating income to $10.6 million.</p>
<p>In the quarter, Wall Street Journal advertising linage
declined 8.7% while Barron's linage was off 7.4%.</p>
