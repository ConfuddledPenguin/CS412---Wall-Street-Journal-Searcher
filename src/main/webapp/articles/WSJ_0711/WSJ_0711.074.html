	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- American Red Cross blood banks failed to
notify the organization's Washington headquarters of 224
possible instances of AIDS contamination, according to the
Food and Drug Administration.
   In all instances, the blood banks had been alerted by
physicians that AIDS patients believed they had been infected
through blood transfusions. All of the blood banks are in the
Washington, D.C., region, which has one of the highest urban
rates of AIDS.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under an agreement with the FDA, the Red Cross has been
required since 1988 to monitor its blood banks more closely
than it had in the past. But most of the cases of possible
contamination occurred before 1985, according to an FDA
spokeswoman.</p>
<p>The FDA's findings appear in an inspection report awaiting
final review. Its contents were first reported yesterday in
the Philadelphia Inquirer.</p>
<p>The Red Cross said that since AIDS testing and screening
had begun, "only six cases of transfusion-associated AIDS
have been reported."</p>
