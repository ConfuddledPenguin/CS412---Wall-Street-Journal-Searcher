	<p class="article-leader">Mikhail Gorbachev was re-elected to lead the Soviet
Communist Party yesterday, but it isn't clear why anyone
should care. The 28th Congress that was to revitalize Lenin's
party has become its last hurrah.
   Lavishing attention on the Communists' Party Congress, all
four U.S. network anchormen showed up in Moscow. Of course,
when it's over, they'll fly out of the Soviet Union. But as
Marx might have put it, history is moving and the communists
are no longer in the vanguard. Consider:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>-- In Donetsk and elsewhere, coal miners say they'll
strike today despite Mr. Gorbachev's pleas for "harmony." "We
have nothing in common with the Party Congress," declared a
miner in Vorkuta. The miners are demanding the
nationalization of Communist property, and the abolition of
Party cells in the military, the KGB and the workplace.</p>
<p>-- Boris Yeltsin took to the Congress podium last week and
said the Party must radically reform or face a "historic
defeat" at the hand of a "union of democratic forces." He
even mentioned that Party leaders could be prosecuted "for
the damage they have personally inflicted on the party and
the people." The Party delegates, most of them nostalgic for
the Brezhnev glory years, could only squirm in their seats.</p>
<p>-- In Moscow, the city government has decided to give city
residents their own apartments. It is also planning a new
cable-TV network, and like other newly elected city
governments, it is locked in a battle over property and
newspapers long controlled by the Communist Party.</p>
<p>-- A recent Soviet poll showed that only about 10% of
young people have any faith in Komsomol, the Communist youth
organization. A recent celebration of youth day in Moscow
turned into an impromptu anti-Komsomol demonstration. A poll
published last week in Izvestia said only 28% of those
surveyed believe the Party Congress can solve the country's
economic crisis.</p>
<p>At this Congress, the Communist Party looks like a kind of
Potemkin Village. Yigor Ligachev and the hard-left statists
seem to dominate; Mr. Ligachev says to count him foursquare
against "free markets or private property." It's not clear
whether the members are defending Marx or their personal
"nomenklatura" privileges; they assail demands to take Party
property as an attempt "to weaken the Party, deprive it of
its material basis and make it unable to engage in political
struggle."</p>
<p>In the end, though, the Congress ends up doing the bidding
of Mr. Gorbachev. He professes reform, but remains wedded to
the main enemy of reform, the Party. He endorses glasnost,
but recently stripped a retired KGB officer, Oleg Kalugin, of
his honors for saying publicly that the Communist Party
controls the KGB.</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev also maneuvered this week to nearly double
the size of the ruling Politburo, ostensibly to promote
reform. But one of the new Politburo members will be Ivan
Polozkov, newly elected head of the Russian Communist Party
and an ally of Mr. Ligachev. In sticking with the Party, Mr.
Gorbachev increasingly resembles a medieval alchemist trying
to turn lead into gold.</p>
<p>The real actors in the drama are such democratic and
free-market reformers as Leningrad City Council Chairman
Anatoly Sobchak. Mr. Sobchak opposes any Western aid to the
current Soviet government as a "waste," and says that
"everything begins and ends with individual enterprise." Most
of these people have remained in the Party so far, but some
have started to resign. Don't be surprised to see mass
resignations in the coming weeks. It's clear that the radical
reformers have much of non-communist opinion on their side.</p>
<p>Mr. Yeltsin is at least a good enough politician to
understand this. He is, of course, an enigmatic figure, not
least because he himself has long been and remains a
Communist. His economic pronouncements have also been a long
way from capitalist. But he is in effect proposing to save
the Party by destroying it -- by ending its system of
privileges (special shops and the like), its control of the
economy and security agencies.</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev and the Party continue to control the
official instruments of power, of course, but they can no
longer be sure the spirits will come if they call. From every
sector of Russian society, they face a popular revulsion
against 70 years of horror and poverty. The Soviet peoples,
unlike many in the West, are saying that reform can't succeed
in Russia until the Party really is over.</p>
