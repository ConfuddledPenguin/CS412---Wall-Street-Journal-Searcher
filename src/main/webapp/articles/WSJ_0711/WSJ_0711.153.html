	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. said it won't
commit any more capital to Isosceles PLC of the U.K., but
would be willing to manage the supermarket company, with is
struggling with heavy debt.
   "We could do a better job of managing the company" than
those who are currently making decisions, A&P Chairman James
Wood said at the annual meeting. All the same, he added, "we
haven't been invited to take management control despite the
obvious need." A&P has a 20% interest in Isosceles.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A&P, which is 52%-owned by Tengelmann Group of West
Germany, reported a 12% rise in net income for the fiscal
first quarter ended June 16. The increase was achieved
despite a 1% decline in sales -- and despite net interest
expense equivalent to seven cents a share in connection with
the company's investment in Isosceles.</p>
<p>Mr. Wood said first-quarter net income was $51 million, or
$1.33 a share, up from $45.4 million, or $1.19 a share, a
year earlier.</p>
<p>Sales were $3.40 billion, down from $3.44 billion. Mr.
Wood said 13 fewer stores were in operation in the latest
period. He also cited "a sluggish sales climate in several
regions that should improve as the year goes along."</p>
<p>The company also announced a quarterly dividend increase,
to 20 cents a share from 17.5 cents a share. The dividend is
payable Aug. 6 to shares of record July 20.</p>
<p>Last fall, as the result of a takeover battle over Gateway
Corp. of Britain -- which Isosceles won -- A&P in turn wound
up with a 20% interest in Isosceles. A&P is "carefully
evaluating the current situation" as Isosceles develops plans
to restructure heavy debt incurred in the Gateway takeover,
Mr. Wood said.</p>
<p>A company spokesman said A&P's investment in Isosceles is
valued at about $150 million at current exchange rates.</p>
