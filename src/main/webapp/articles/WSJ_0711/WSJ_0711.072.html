	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A class-action lawsuit was filed asking a
federal judge to ban Sony Corp. from selling its new digital
audio tape recorders.
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. district court in Manhattan,
alleges that the recording devices, which make nearly
flawless recordings from compact disks and other sources, are
designed solely to enable consumers to violate music
copyrights by making unauthorized versions. The action was
filed on behalf of songwriters and other owners of music
copyrights in the U.S.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The lawsuit seeks a court order prohibiting Sony from
distributing and marketing the DAT recorders, which it began
shipping to retailers last month, as well as blank DAT
cassettes. The lawsuit also seeks a declaration by the court
that unauthorized home recordings made on the DAT machines
violate music copyrights, and that Sony will be liable for
those alleged infringements.</p>
<p>Michael Oberman, an attorney for the plaintiffs who
brought the suit, said a recent survey by the Roper
Organization found that nearly everyone interested in buying
a DAT machine intends to tape prerecorded music.</p>
<p>Sony, in a statement, said the suit is "totally without
merit," adding that "DAT is the latest development of a
product that has been widely used in the U.S. for more than
30 years -- the home tape recorder."</p>
