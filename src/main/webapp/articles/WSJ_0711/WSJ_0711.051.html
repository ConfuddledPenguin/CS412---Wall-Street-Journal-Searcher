	<p class="article-leader">Lawsuits claiming fears about the future are giving
companies anxiety attacks.
   More and more suits are being filed that seek compensation
for plaintiffs' worries about events that may happen at a
later time, and defense lawyers say the trend poses serious
problems for corporations. The specter of liability for fear
and distress, they argue, could deter manufacturers from
introducing beneficial products. They also say it's unfair to
make companies pay for worries about incidents that are
statistically unlikely to occur.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But modern society increasingly views " `mental
tranquillity' as a protectable interest," says Paul
Rothstein, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center.
"Part of the good life today, as opposed to medieval times,
is that we're not only entitled to be free from physical
injuries but we're also entitled to a degree of mental
happiness."</p>
<p>Consequently, individuals and companies have been sued by
people who believe they may develop cancer because of their
proximity to manufacturing plants, worry that life-saving
equipment may eventually kill them and fear that they will
contract sexually transmitted diseases.</p>
<p>Decisions on compensating the victims of fear have varied
from court to court, but the U.S. Supreme Court is expected
to address the issue in the fall. The court will hear a case
filed by passengers of an Eastern Airlines flight who say
they suffered emotional injuries when they were told by a
pilot that their plane might crash.</p>
<p>Courts have long recognized the right to seek damages for
emotional distress, but until recently compensation was only
granted when the distress was the result of a physical
injury. Many judges viewed fear and distress claims
skeptically because they thought that emotional injuries were
easy to feign. Many courts also believed that such injuries
were temporary and thus difficult to compensate.</p>
<p>But a growing understanding about the devastating impact
of emotional injuries has made judges more willing to
compensate plaintiffs, even when their fears don't have
physical manifestations.</p>
<p>"From a financial standpoint, the suits have the potential
to be devastating," says Arvin Maskin of the New York law
firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, who defends corporations in
fear litigation.</p>
<p>Last year a Los Angeles jury awarded $14.5 million to Marc
Christian, Rock Hudson's former lover, who claimed he
suffered emotional distress after learning in a 1985 news
report that Mr. Hudson was dying from AIDS. It is believed to
be the largest amount awarded to someone who tested negative
for a sexually transmitted disease. The trial judge reduced
the award to $5 million, but lawyers for Mr. Hudson's estate
have asked the appeals court to grant a new trial, arguing
that there was insufficient evidence that Mr. Christian
suffered severe emotional distress.</p>
<p>"When someone says I had a relationship and I'm fearful
I'll get AIDS, how can you prove or disprove that? It's your
word against his," says Robert Parker Mills of the Pasadena
law firm of Mills & Schroeder, which represents the estate.</p>
<p>But Kent L. Richland, who represents Mr. Christian, says
that medical science can't say with complete certainty that
his client will never contract AIDS. "The threat that is
hanging over his head is a horrible disease and a miserable,
painful death," says Mr. Richland, a lawyer with the Beverly
Hills law firm of Greines, Martin, Stein & Richland.</p>
<p>Lawyers say the Hudson verdict has wide implications and
has been used to support claims involving alleged exposure to
toxic substances, where diseases often have a long latency
period and proving an injury is difficult. In those cases,
the courts have grappled with determining how reasonable the
fear is, especially in incidents where the odds of a disease
materializing are remote. Many judges are beginning to accept
the notion that probability isn't a good measure of a
person's fears.</p>
<p>That was the reasoning applied by U.S. District Judge
Robert J. Bryan in a suit brought by nine past and present
residents of an Air Force base in Tacoma, Wash., against the
federal government for damages resulting from the alleged
contamination of their water wells. In a 1987 decision that
included more than $80,000 for the plaintiffs' emotional
distress, Judge Bryan wrote that the plaintiffs hadn't been
exposed to a risk "greater than one in one million. The
actual risk was probably much less, and may be zero." But he
noted that the Environmental Protection Agency had advised
the plaintiffs not to drink or use the water, which contained
possible carcinogens, and so he found the residents'
anxieties reasonable.</p>
<p>Other courts have determined that a person's fears are
reasonable based on a wide range of evidence, including
letters from a doctor prescribing regular checkups,
transcripts of congressional hearings in which the health
risks associated with certain chemicals are discussed,
scientific articles, and even TV broadcasts.</p>
<p>Mr. Maskin of Weil Gotshal, who lectures regularly about
phobia suits, says he worries that "the courts have allowed
perceived risks to transcend actual risks. If you jettison
the reality of risk, then the sky is the limit."</p>
<p>But plaintiffs' lawyers say that medical science still
can't definitively state how exposure to toxic substances
affects individuals, so courts must find other methods to
assess fear.</p>
<p>Employees of Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. have filed a suit
claiming the company fraudulently concealed information about
hazardous substances used at the company's Salinas, Calif.,
facility and seeking funds to pay for regular checkups to
monitor their health. Firestone has denied the allegations.</p>
<p>In a 1987 opinion refusing to dismiss the case, U.S.
District Judge Robert P. Aguilar of San Jose acknowledged
medical science hadn't developed to the point it could detect
the employees' injuries and that the legal system "must
evolve to meet the needs of society." The case is pending.</p>
<p>John W. Fowler of the San Francisco firm of McCutchen,
Doyle, Brown & Enersen, a lawyer for Firestone, says that
providing lifetime medical monitoring could be costly for
employers and open up manufacturers to liability for diseases
that never materialize. But the employees' lawyer, Gordon A.
Stemple of the Century City firm of Stemple & Boyajian, says
companies that knowingly send employees into a dangerous
workplace should bear the cost of monitoring for health
problems.</p>
<p>Fear suits raise particularly troubling questions in the
area of medical technology, where advances in science have
led to breakthroughs that are often accompanied by health
risks.</p>
<p>The issue was highlighted by a suit filed by Judy Khan, an
artificial heart valve patient. Mrs. Khan claims she has
lived in constant fear of death since she learned that Shiley
Inc., the valve's maker, was recalling the product because a
defect could cause the valves to fracture. The California
Supreme Court ruled in May that Mrs. Khan can seek damages
for emotional distress if she can prove Shiley concealed
material information.</p>
<p>"Whether you're talking about an AIDS vaccine, an organ
implant or artificial heart valves, few medical products are
risk-free. If you allow these lawsuits {to proceed}, in
effect you create universal liability," says David Klingsberg
of the New York law firm of Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays &
Handler, which represents Pfizer Inc., Shiley's owner.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Khan's lawyer, Bruce A. Finzen of Robins, Kaplan,
Miller & Ciresi of Minneapolis, says Pfizer should be held
liable for concealing the risks associated with its product.
"Their breach of duty has caused people anguish," he says.</p>
<p>Not all such litigation involves fears of future events.
Lawyers say a growing number of cases are being filed by
passengers who survive airplane accidents and seek damages
for the emotional distress when they thought they might die.</p>
<p>In the case currently before the U.S. Supreme Court, 25
passengers and their spouses are seeking damages for mental
distress they say they suffered aboard Eastern Airlines
flight 855 on May 5, 1983. Bound for the Bahamas, the plane
ran into trouble after leaving the Miami airport. One engine
malfunctioned and had to be shut down by the crew. The other
two failed soon after.</p>
<p>As the plane rapidly lost altitude, the captain announced
it might crash in the Atlantic Ocean. But the crew managed to
restart one of the engines, and the plane returned safely to
Miami.</p>
<p>John M. Murray, a lawyer for Eastern from the Miami law
firm of Thornton, David, Murray, Richard & Davis, said the
passengers shouldn't be able to collect damages because they
suffered no physical injuries. He predicts that if the case
goes forward, "the number of lawsuits that are filed against
air carriers will vastly increase."</p>
<p>But the plaintiffs' lawyer, Joel D. Eaton of the Miami
firm of Podhurst, Orseck, Josefsberg, Eaton, Meadow, Olin &
Perwin, sees it differently. "The passengers were told they
were going to crash," he says. "They were nearly frightened
to death."</p>
