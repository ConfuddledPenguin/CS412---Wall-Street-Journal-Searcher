	<p class="article-leader">LAS VEGAS, Nev. -- American Pacific Corp., a specialty
chemical maker and industrial real estate developer,
announced definitive cooperation agreements with Dynamit
Nobel AG of West Germany for the design, construction and
operation of a sodium azide plant in Iron County, Utah.
   Sodium azide is the main chemical used to inflate
automotive air bags. There is no U.S. producer of the
material, American Pacific said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The estimated capital cost of the plant, which will be
owned and operated by American Pacific's American Azide Corp.
unit, is about $20 million. The plant is to have annual
capacity of 1,000 metric tons. A metric ton is equal to about
2,204.62 pounds. Dynamit Nobel, which will provide technical
assistance to help get the factory completed and running, has
retained the option to purchase 30% of the common stock of
American Azide.</p>
<p>Dynamit Nobel's obligation to proceed with the project
beyond the first phase, however, is subject to American
Pacific's getting the required financing. "Although there can
be no assurance that financing will be obtained, the company
has had preliminary discussions with a number of financing
sources and is optimistic that satisfactory financing
arrangements will be made," said Fred D. Gibson Jr., American
Pacific's chairman.</p>
<p>The plant will be built by United Engineers & Constructors
Inc., a division of Raytheon Co., Lexington, Mass.
Construction is planned for the spring of 1991 and the
plant's start-up for the 1991 fourth quarter. The plant will
be designed for "timely and economic expansion" to 2,000
metric tons of capacity annually, American Pacific said.</p>
