	<p class="article-leader">McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s helicopter unit, in the latest
of a series of restructuring attempts, said it was changing
its management framework and announced the departure of five
executives.
   The company said other actions being taken include
"significant cost and budget-cutting measures," but details
won't be disclosed until later.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The company's financial performance in the past year
makes it clear that a change in the way we do business is
necessary," Tom Gunn, president of the Mesa, Ariz.-based
subsidiary, said in a statement. About a year ago, the
helicopter concern said it would streamline and restructure,
and in February it initiated another cost-reduction plan that
included about 630 layoffs.</p>
<p>So far, though, little seems to have been turned around.
In 1989, significant writedowns were recorded at the
helicopter unit, especially on the AH-64 Apache program.
Moreover, the General Accounting Office in April branded that
aircraft as breakdown-prone. "The Apache's problems are
serious and go beyond normal growing pains," a representative
of the congressional investigative arm testified at a House
hearing. Then in May, Mr. Gunn's predecessor stepped down
amid the company's continuing poor financial performance.</p>
<p>The helicopter unit, which employs about 7,000 people, has
four product lines: the AH-64; the LH, on which it has teamed
up with Textron Inc.'s Bell unit in a bid to develop a light
armed reconnaissance helicopter for the Army; the MD-500,
which features a no-tail rotor system; and the MDX, a
twin-engine commercial helicopter that can seat up to eight.</p>
<p>"The need to restructure is particularly acute in light of
the dramatic changes in the world political picture and the
resultant reduced spending for defense," Mr. Gunn said.</p>
<p>McDonnell Douglas, the nation's No. 1 military contractor,
disclosed last month that it would try to pare $700 million a
year from its cost structure, corporationwide. The St. Louis
aerospace firm, stung by losses principally at its transport
aircraft division in California, has in the past year piled
up debt and watched its stock price sink.</p>
<p>But a spokesman in Mesa said the helicopter unit's actions
were largely unrelated to its parent's recent plea for more
efficiency. "I don't think I would connect the two," he said.</p>
<p>As part of the changes, McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Co.
said it would break into four autonomous divisions covering
its distinct product lines, supported by six other divisions.
Previously, there were only seven divisions in all.</p>
<p>In addition, two unit vice presidents and two unit
directors elected to take early retirement or to resign. Norm
Hirsh, an executive vice president and a 27-year McDonnell
Douglas veteran, also retired.</p>
