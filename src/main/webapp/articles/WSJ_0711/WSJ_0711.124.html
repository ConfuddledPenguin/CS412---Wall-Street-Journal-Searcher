	<p class="article-leader">British publisher Robert Maxwell must put back on the
market a 14.9% stake in Bell Group Ltd. of Australia that he
acquired in April. But his lawyers said he may be able to
retain the stake.
   Bell Group, an affiliate of Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd.,
publishes the main morning newspaper in Perth, the West
Australian, and Mr. Maxwell has been seeking a foothold in
Australian newspaper publishing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Maxwell purchased the stake in Bell Group for 485,900
Australian dollars (US$390,400), or one Australian cent a
share, from David Aspinall, managing director of Bell Group,
and regulators alleged that the sale breached Australia's
takeover rules. Mr. Aspinall, who earlier acquired a 16.6%
stake in Bell Group, was deemed to be an associate of the
controlling holder, Bond Corp., so his purchase should have
triggered a takeover offer for the whole company, regulators
said.</p>
<p>In the settlement, Mr. Aspinall must offer for sale his
5.4 million Bell Group shares and Mr. Maxwell must offer his
shares. The shares will carry a reserve price that hasn't yet
been disclosed. Bell Group shares currently are trading at
seven Australian cents. Mr. Maxwell can bid for the shares he
already owns, and if no other buyer offers the reserve price,
Mr. Maxwell can retain the shares.</p>
