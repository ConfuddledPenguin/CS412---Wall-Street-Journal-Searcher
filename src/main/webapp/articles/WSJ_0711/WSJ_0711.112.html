	<p class="article-leader">PURCHASE, N.Y. -- International Paper Co. reported that
second-quarter earnings dropped 19% on lower prices for
uncoated printing and writing paper and for containerboard,
used in making corrugated cartons.
   The results substantially exceeded analysts' expectations,
however, and investors buoyed the company's stock price.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The paper, packaging and wood-products giant said its
European paper and packaging operations performed strongly,
as did specialty products, which include chemicals used in
paints and adhesives; fabrics; and commercial photographic
film and paper.</p>
<p>Second-quarter earnings sank to $185 million, or $1.70 a
share, from $229 million, or $2.04 a share, in the same
period a year earlier. Sales rose 6.7% to $3.2 billion from
$3 billion.</p>
<p>The results "were significantly better than I was
expecting," said Mark S. Rogers, analyst at Prudential-Bache
Capital Funding, who had pegged International Paper earnings
at $1.55 a share.</p>
<p>In linerboard, used to line corrugated packaging, and
market pulp, the basic material for paper, "the down trend
wasn't as strong as I thought," Mr. Rogers said, adding that
those product areas are likely to continue to drop
industrywide in the second half.</p>
<p>But while uncoated paper hurt the year-to-year comparison,
prices have been recovering quarter to quarter this year, and
"that's sustainable," the analyst said. "That product area
looks well-positioned and is on a cyclical upturn after
bottoming (early) this year."</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
International Paper's shares rose 87.5 cents to $52.50.</p>
