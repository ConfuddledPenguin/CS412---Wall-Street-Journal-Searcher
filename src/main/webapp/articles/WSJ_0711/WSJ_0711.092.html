	<p class="article-leader">AMMAN, Jordan -- Coming from the mosque in a teeming
refugee camp, a Palestinian explains why war with Israel is
imminent.
   "Our holy prophet tells us that when all the Jews of the
world are gathered east of the river, we will destroy them
there," says 28-year-old Radi Mohamed. "The coming of the
Soviet Jews shows us that this day is soon."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Across town, in a quiet room of his pink stone palace, a
grim-faced King Hussein drops his voice to a whisper. "People
have had about enough," he says. "The situation could
explode."</p>
<p>In neighboring Israel, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir tries
to damp such talk of impending war. "Nobody thinks about it,"
he says. But in the warren of ajoining offices, his
colleagues acknowledge they have thought about it a great
deal, ever since Saddam Hussein's April threat to burn half
of Israel in retaliation for any attack on Iraq. "We didn't
answer. We didn't want to inflame the situation," says Avi
Pazner, Mr. Shamir's spokesman. "Words have power of their
own."</p>
<p>Violent rhetoric is the common fare of Middle Eastern
discourse. But veteran rulers, politicians and diplomats see
the latest round of tough talk as just one indication of a
region sliding toward war. Tension is so high that when a
recent sandstorm caused a blackout in Cairo, Egyptians
scanned the skies for the Israeli jets they thought had
bombed the Aswan Dam.</p>
<p>Fakir Jabali, a member of the Palestine Liberation
Organization's military wing, speaks proudly of the increased
numbers of Palestinians volunteering for army training in
Iraq. In Baghdad, a senior government offical coolly weighs
the pros and cons of a chemical-weapons strike on Israel: "We
are not suicidal; we realize that if we burn half of Israel,
half of Iraq also will burn. But they (Israel's population)
are more dense and more vulnerable."</p>
<p>Alliances are in a state of flux and power struggles are
under way throughout the Arab world. Iraq, one the world's
biggest arms buyers for the past five years, is rapidly
gaining influence over the PLO and neighboring Jordan, both
of which had been in the orbit of Egypt, the only Arab nation
to have made peace with Israel.</p>
<p>Inside the PLO, Yasser Arafat is losing ground to radicals
who say his attempts at conciliation have been fruitless.
Islamic fundamentalism is on the upsurge everywhere, with one
of its principal tenets the destruction of Israel. Israel
last month installed the most hard-line government in its
42-year history. And all this comes with U.S. influence at
its nadir after a decade of botched mediation attempts.</p>
<p>Arabs liken the current mood to the months before the 1967
war, with Saddam Hussein's rhetoric reminiscent of then
Egyptian president Gamal Abdul Nasser. When Nasser closed the
Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping, the Israelis launched a
pre-emptive strike that virtually wiped out the Egyptian air
force. Today, Arabs fear that Israel will find a similar
cause of war in Iraq's acquisition of weapons.</p>
<p>Some Israelis, meanwhile, see closer parallels with the
period before the 1973 Yom Kippur War, when Arabs launched a
surprise attack as Israel's politicians ignored warnings of
war preparations. Conventional wisdom then, as now, said
Arabs didn't have the military might to risk a confrontation.
Now, Mr. Shamir says Israelis who warn of war probably do so
"because of political interests, in order to criticize the
new government."</p>
<p>The drift began in earnest in January, with Mr. Shamir's
statement that the mass immigration of Soviet Jews required
"a big Israel." It was, says one Israeli immigration offical,
"a tragic statement." Arabs heard it as a threat to annex
Israeli-occupied Palestinian lands in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, and campaigned to slow an immigration that ultimately
could add a million people to Israel's 4.4 million
population. As that effort proved fruitless, war-like
rhetoric escalated.</p>
<p>Ghazi Breigeith, a Palestinian electrician in the West
Bank village of Beit Omar, says Arab leaders bungled the job
of explaining their case. Reaching for a plate of mulberries,
he tries to clarify his feelings about the Soviet
immigration. "If this is mine, and you come and start eating
from it, and invite your friends to share it, how do I know
there'll be anything left for me?" he asks. "If we each have
our own plate, you can eat as you like. If we had our own
state we wouldn't care how many Russians came to Israel, but
right now we have no borders to say this is yours, this is
mine."</p>
<p>Under the pressures of Israeli settlers and the
Palestinian resistance, some Palestinians are leaving the
West Bank.</p>
<p>By King Hussein's count, 46,000 have moved to Jordan since
the December 1987 beginning of the uprising. Many Arabs,
including King Hussein, believe it is only a matter of time
before Israel's new hardline government finds a pretext to
push out even larger numbers of Palestinians.</p>
<p>"Ninety-nine per cent of Israelis would like to get up in
the morning and find no Arabs here, and 99% of Arabs feel the
same" about Jews, says Moshe Yogev, a Jewish settler in the
West Bank town of Efrat, 15 minutes drive from Jerusalem. But
he says that the Soviet influx isn't relevant to that
tension, because less than 1% of the newcomers are settling
in the occupied lands. His own 400-family community has just
two Soviet families so far. Because most settlements have
houses rather than apartments, he says, their prices are too
high for most newcomers.</p>
<p>But when he gives the cost -- around $70,000 for a
semi-detached villa -- the U.S. born Israeli who has been
translating the interview begins firing off questions of her
own. For two months, she has been looking for a place to buy
in Jerusalem, fearful of being priced out of a rental market
where Soviet demand has pushed rents up 40% to 100%. For
$70,000, she has seen only grim, shabby two-bedroom flats.</p>
<p>The Soviet influx isn't the only destabilizing by-product
of the changes in the East bloc. While the easing of
U.S.-Soviet tension has lessened the chance of a global
conflict, Arabs fear it has increased regional risks by
eliminating the Soviet/East bloc balance to strong U.S.
support for Israel.</p>
<p>During the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, the U.S. put its forces
on nuclear alert, fearing that the regional conflict could
drag it into war with the Soviets. Now, such a possibility
has receded to the rear drawer of strategic speculation. Some
military analysts say U.S. attention has gone with it.</p>
<p>"This region has been the third priority, now it's about
tenth," in U.S. foreign policy, says a senior U.S. military
official who works closely with the Israelis.</p>
<p>Adding to the risk is arms proliferation in a region
already bristling with missiles, chemical weapons and
Israel's unacknowleged nuclear bombs. As the superpowers
disarm in Europe, the poorer countries of the Middle East
seem set to become each side's dumping ground for cut-price
used arms, while such oil-rich states as Saudi Arabia and
Iraq offer rare sales opportunities in a declining market.</p>
<p>In March, the U.S. said it planned to sell 700 M-60 tanks
to Egypt, thus accounting for most of the 930 tanks the army
estimates it doesn't now need in Europe. In a report to
Congress, the administration said just under half its
possible $30 billion foreign arms sales is headed for the
Middle East. In the past, such sales have received intense
congressional scrutiny, but with hard-hit defense contractors
fighting for every sale, politicians are less likely to
object.</p>
<p>The Soviets also have a lot to sell. "Trucks, ammunition,
MiGs, you name it, pay dollars, you'll get it," predicts
Yacov Sheinin, an economics consultant in Tel Aviv.
Meanwhile, Iraq is in the midst of a vast military
industrialization. "It's a good business," says Nizar
Hamdoon, Iraq's deputy foreign minister. "The West has
flourished on it."</p>
<p>But in the streets of Baghdad, Iraqis seem more sobered
than elated by the war mood. "My son says he'll desert rather
than go back to war," says an Iraqi whose son served through
most of the eight-year conflict with Iran. "He says, Dad, I
don't care if they hang me.'"</p>
