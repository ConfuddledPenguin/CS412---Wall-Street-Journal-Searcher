	<p class="article-leader">MINNEAPOLIS -- AirTran Corp. said June traffic at its
Mesaba Aviation unit rose 18% to 18.3 million revenue
passenger miles from 15.5 million.
   A revenue passenger mile is one paying passenger flown one
mile.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The regional carrier said its load factor, or percentage
of seats filled, dropped to 51.9% from the year-earlier
61.7%. The drop reflects an increase in capacity and an
unusually high year-earlier load factor, Mesaba said.</p>
