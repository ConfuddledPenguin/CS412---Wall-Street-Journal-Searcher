	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- An increasingly popular yen pushed the dollar
broadly lower yesterday. The Japanese currency led active and
volatile trading, surging against most of its counterparts.
   The dollar declined almost three yen, or by about 2%, to
end New York trading at a four-month low against its Japanese
counterpart. The greenback also fell about a German pfennig
to a two-month low against the mark and allowed the British
pound to extend its gain nearly 1 1/2 U.S. cents, closing the
day at an 18-month dollar high.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
1.6425 marks, down from 1.6530 marks late Monday in New York.
The U.S. currency was also changing hands at 148.30 yen, well
below 151.15 yen in New York late Monday.</p>
<p>In Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar was trading at 148.50 yen
soon after the opening, down from Tuesday's Tokyo close of
149.60 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at
1.6445 marks, up from Tuesday's Tokyo close of 1.6394 marks.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the yen registered gains on the mark and, to a
lesser extent, the pound. Briefly in Asian trading,
cross-selling of the mark for yen allowed the pound cross
rate to rise past three marks -- the level thought to be
favored by the U.K. government for sterling's entry into the
price bands of the European Monetary System.</p>
<p>Yesterday's global trading session, like many recently,
was driven by interest rates. But rather than single-mindedly
buying currencies, such as Australian and Canadian dollars
and sterling, with a huge yield edge, investors moved their
money around based on the smaller interest rate
differentials, both real and potential, among the world's
three leading currencies.</p>
<p>"The whole play is interest-rate based," said Peter
Connelly, foreign exchange manager for Wells Fargo Bank in
San Francisco</p>
<p>The yen's main source of strength was the renewed prospect
of a tighter credit policy in Japan. Also buttressing the yen
was speculation that leaders of the Group of Seven leading
democracies meeting in Houston will issue a statement
supporting the Japanese currency at the conclusion of their
talks today.</p>
<p>Most currency dealers saw the spark for the yen's rally in
a widely circulated report from Smick Medley International, a
Washington-based investment advisory firm. The company said
Sunday, "there is now an 80%-90% chance the Bank of Japan
will raise interest rates over the next several months."</p>
<p>Tokyo traders said they sold the dollar on hearing talk
about the report during the Asian morning Tuesday. When the
Japanese translation appeared on domestic wire services soon
after trading began for Tokyo's afternoon session, the dollar
was sold off again.</p>
<p>Rumors about Bank of Japan tightening have been bandied
about the market ever since Japanese negotiators acceded to a
U.S. demand that the government of Prime Minister Toshiki
Kaifu spend more money on public works. Yen money market
rates have been rising recently, and Japanese monetary
officials have expressed concern at the quick growth of the
nation's money supply.</p>
<p>In late New York trading the pound was trading at $1.8230
and 2.9943 marks, above $1.8080 and 2.9886 marks late Monday.
The British currency, however, closed at 270.35 yen, down
from 273.28 yen late Monday.</p>
<p>The dollar closed at its lowest level against the yen
since Feb. 23, when it stood at 147.07 yen. Against the mark,
the greenback finished at its lowest level since May 11, when
it traded at 1.6380 marks. The last time sterling finished at
such a high dollar level was Jan. 3, 1989, when a pound
bought $1.8225.</p>
<p>"The yen is catching up with the Deutsche mark," said Mr.
Connelly of Wells Fargo, noting that the Japanese currency
lagged other non-dollar currencies when the greenback began
it current downward trend in June.</p>
<p>Added Tomi Kilgore of Toyo Trust & Banking Co.'s New York
office, "the yen is getting a lot of support on the crosses."
The market "isn't only selling dollars, it's buying yen."</p>
<p>Mr. Connelly commented that no interest rate changes need
occur for the dollar's troubles to continue. "Even if the
(U.S. Federal Reserve Board) doesn't do anything, the dollar
will lose ground," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Kilgore said that the U.S. is currently the only
nation with a major currency whose monetary bias is toward
easing. As long as that situation continues, the market will
be eager to sell dollars, he said.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $355.50 an ounce, down $2.70. Estimated
volume was a moderate 4.2 million ounces.</p>
<p>In early trading in Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was quoted
at $354.75 an ounce.</p>
