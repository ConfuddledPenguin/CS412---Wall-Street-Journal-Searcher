	<p class="article-leader">Perhaps only God can make a tree, but Marvin Davis is
claiming that one is his own "intellectual property."
   His Pebble Beach Co., owner of the scenic golf and hotel
resort on the central California shore front, has informed
photographers that the Lone Cypress standing on a rocky point
of its land is a company-trademarked image.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In November, company attorneys told Westlight, a Los
Angeles photo agency that had sold a Lone Cypress photo, to
stop marketing images of the tree. The same month, says
free-lance photographer Ed Young, Pebble Beach denied him
permission to take pictures if he planned to sell them "in
violation of their trademark."</p>
<p>That has pro photographers scurrying to their lawyers for
rebuttals to Pebble Beach's view of the trademark laws.</p>
<p>"Is Mount Rushmore next?" asks Robert M. Cavallo, whose
New York-based Cavallo & Wolff law firm represents Westlight
and the Picture Agency Council of America. He contends that
the Pebble Beach trademark protects only the company's
distinct logo rendering of the tree with waves in the
background, and that after 100 years of being freely snapped,
the tree is now in the public domain.</p>
<p>Pebble Beach says its attorney knowledgeable on the issue
is unreachable. But in a letter to Cavallo & Wolff, the
company said it has applied to "register the tree itself as a
trademark no matter how depicted."</p>
<p>Even if the company is successful in this application,
it's questionable how any restrictions would affect the
thousands of commercial photographs already in circulation.
"They're trying to lock the barn door after the horse is
out," says Pat Hathaway, a Carmel photographer whose firm,
California Views, has more than 100 versions of the Lone
Cypress, including one picture taken in 1880.</p>
