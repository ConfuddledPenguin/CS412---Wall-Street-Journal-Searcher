	<p class="article-leader">Societe Lyonnaise des Eaux, a diversified French
water-treatment group, and building company Dumez S.A. said
they plan to merge but declined to provide further details
until after their boards meet to approve the plan.
   The two companies, which obtained a suspension of their
shares on the Paris stock exchange Monday, said their boards
will meet today.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The move came as a surprise to some analysts, who didn't
expect Lyonnaise des Eaux to merge with a company whose
profit margins are generally only half its own and whose
business is vulnerable to swings in demand for construction.
Some analysts suggested, however, that the merger would allow
the two companies to catch up with their main rivals in
efforts over the last two or three years to build
multiservice conglomerates.</p>
<p>Lyonnaise des Eaux shares were suspended Monday at 702
francs ($126.60) each, while Dumez shares were frozen at 641
francs each. At those levels, the common stock of Lyonnaise
des Eaux and Dumez would be worth just over 20 billion francs
and seven billion francs, respectively. Lyonnaise des Eaux
also has several convertible bonds outstanding.</p>
