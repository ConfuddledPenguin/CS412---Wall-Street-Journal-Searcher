	<p class="article-leader">As Mikhail Gorbachev tries to patch up the cracks in the
Soviet Communist Party, another Soviet institution is showing
signs of splitting: the military. A profound schism is
dividing junior and mid-level officers from the generals who
command them. "Glasnost" has shattered the myth that the
Soviet military -- the highest ranks apart -- is prosperous
and privileged. Inflation has eroded the purchasing power of
lower-echelon officers' salaries -- particularly of those
officers who serve in remote areas where it is impossible for
their wives to get jobs. Lower-ranking officers often have to
live with their families in a single room in communal
apartments with shared facilities. Some officers are
literally homeless and have to beg their colleagues to put
them up temporarily or sleep in cars or garages on their
bases.
   Officers whose units have been withdrawn from Eastern
Europe find they have no apartments waiting for them back
home. Some send their families to stay with relatives
hundreds, even thousands, of miles away. These forced
separations can last for years. In the meantime, lucky
officers get beds in shared rooms in local officers'
dormitories; the unlucky move into tent cities. The situation
is even worse for retired officers. The Soviet media last
year reported that societies of homeless retired officers are
appearing in some cities.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Junior and mid-level officers have also begun to complain
about the army's involvement in domestic policing operations.
"I am ashamed before my soldiers]" said one battle-hardened
veteran of the Afghan war to a reporter. Officers have been
invited by their superiors to "volunteer" for policing
operations. Those who refuse are kicked out of the Army in
violation of the existing regulations.</p>
<p>These grievances have triggered an absolutely
unprecedented event in Soviet military history: a wave of
resignations from the armed forces. Some 30,000 letters of
resignation from Soviet officers are currently awaiting
action by the Ministry of Defense.</p>
<p>Unhappy lower-ranking officers have begun to organize in
defense of their interests. A group of mid-level and junior
officers was elected to the Supreme Soviet in the spring of
1989. An independent military trade union, Shield, was also
founded by maverick officers in 1989 to protect the economic
and legal rights of active duty military personnel, veterans
and their families. Shield is reported to have some 40,000
members, but the exact number is unknown. Several of its
members have been elected to local and regional soviets.</p>
<p>These new military voices propose far-reaching military
reforms that would do away with the draft and transform the
Soviet military into an organization of well-paid,
voluntarily recruited professionals, barred from domestic
policing operations. This plan has been embraced by Boris
Yeltsin and other progressive politicians.</p>
<p>By contrast, the High Command of the Soviet Armed Forces
has placed itself firmly at the conservative end of the
Soviet political spectrum. The generals have been
increasingly outspoken in their criticism of President
Mikhail Gorbachev. Addressing the recent congress of the
Communist Party of the Russian Republic, Albert Makashov,
Commander of the Volga-Ural Military District, called Mr.
Gorbachev's policies "feeble-minded," and blamed him for the
loss of Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Top-level military officials have displayed a disturbing
eagerness to use force against civilians in domestic crises.
A senior General Staff officer, Gen. Grigoriy Krivosheyev,
and Chief Military Prosecutor Gen. Aleksandr Katusev have
suggested that Lithuania should be put under military
occupation and its president, Vitautas Landsbergis,
prosecuted, in order to put a stop to draft resistance in
Lithuania.</p>
<p>Gen. Igor Rodionov -- the senior regional military
commander in Tbilisi at the time of the 1989 massacre by
paratroopers of unarmed civilian demonstrators, many of them
women -- justified the use of force as "defense against the
aggressiveness of the crowd" and an appropriate reaction to
the protesters' anti-Soviet slogans. Civilians have also been
massacred in the civil strife of the past two years in
Azerbaijan and Armenia.</p>
<p>The bloody-mindedness of the High Command should not,
however, be taken as evidence that the military is
monolithically opposed to reform; neither should the
hardening of Soviet positions in negotiations over arms
control and German unification. The military itself is
increasingly polarized and the High Command no longer speaks
for the entire institution.</p>
<p>Since the reformist military deputies in the Supreme
Soviet submitted their proposal for military reform to the
legislature, senior military officials have been forced into
discussions of military reform. The High Command made public
its own counter-proposal for reform in April.</p>
<p>This concession has weakened the High Command's legitimacy
-- by conceding that other forces speak for military
interests too -- without satisfying the lower echelons. The
High Command remains extremely reluctant to deal with the
socio-economic problems of lower-echelon officers.</p>
<p>The generals oppose reallocation of funds from weapons to
housing and other amenities for military personnel-even as
the spotlight of glasnost has been cast on the perks of the
higher-ups.</p>
<p>The High Command has no constructive solutions to offer,
either for the military or for Soviet society at large. All
it can do, if it becomes more politically involved, is
trigger the final split within the military by attempting to
draw lower-ranking officers into a coup against Mr. Gorbachev
and Mr. Yeltsin. Such a split would not be in anybody's
interest. A lot of innocent bystanders could get hurt in an
internal conflict between different factions of a military
armed with nuclear, chemical and modern conventional weapons.</p>
<p>The best chance for healing the divisions within the
military, and avoiding a possibly violent split, lies in a
reconciliation between Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Yeltsin. This
would deprive the hard-liners in the Communist Party of any
role in the political process. The High Command would be left
without coalition partners and with no choice but to
acquiesce in the reformers' agenda.</p>
