	<p class="article-leader">GAITHERSBURG, Md. -- Oncor Inc. said it has applied for
pre-market approval from the Food and Drug Administration to
sell a DNA-based test for cervical cancer.
   Oncor, which already markets the test in other countries,
sells the test in the U.S. for research purposes. If the new
application is approved, Oncor would be allowed to sell the
test to labs for widespread use on human patients.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>An Oncor spokesman said the company's application for
pre-market approval also fulfills a clause in its
international marketing agreement with Medscand AB of Sweden,
which helped fund the test's development. Under the
agreement, Medscand will pay Oncor the final $200,000
installment of a $500,000 development fee within 30 days.</p>
<p>Stephen Turner, Oncor's chairman and chief executive
officer, said he envisions the Human Papillomavirus Analysis
System as a second test, to verify results from the widely
used Pap smear. "The data isn't there for broad screening"
with the Oncor system alone, Mr. Turner said.</p>
<p>The company estimates the immediate U.S. market for the
test at about 2.4 million women. Oncor expects to sell the
testing kits to labs for about $15 each. The labs would then
charge the patient $70 to $100 to administer the test.</p>
<p>Mr. Turner said he expects the FDA review to take from six
to 12 months.</p>
