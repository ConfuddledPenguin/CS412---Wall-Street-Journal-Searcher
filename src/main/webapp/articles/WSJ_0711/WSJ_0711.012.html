	<p class="article-leader">The May 24 "Your Money Matters" column on insurance
policies discusses commissionable life-insurance policies vs.
noncommissionable policies, but fails to say where the agent
who sells the non-commissionable policy is going to be
compensated, unless missionaries will sell the policy.
Obviously, the person who sells or recommends the policy with
no commissions will have to charge a fee. You make no mention
of these fees.
