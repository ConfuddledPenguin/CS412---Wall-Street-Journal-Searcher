	<p class="article-leader">MIAMI -- Eastern Airlines said its June traffic rose to
1.44 billion revenue passenger miles from the 252.47 million
a year earlier when a strike cut flights.
   A revenue passenger mile is one paying passenger flown one
mile. The carrier said load factor for the month was down to
61.41% from 61.95% a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the first six months, Eastern said it flew 9.08 billion
revenue passenger miles, up from 4.96 billion. Load factor
was 61.59%, up from 58.46%.</p>
<p>Eastern, formerly a unit of Texas Air Corp., is being
managed by a bankruptcy court-appointed trustee. Texas Air
has since changed its name to Continental Airlines Holdings
Inc.</p>
