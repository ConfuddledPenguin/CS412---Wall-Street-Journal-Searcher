	<p class="article-leader">CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- Former West Virginia Gov. Arch A.
Moore Jr. was sentenced yesterday to five years and 10 months
in prison and was fined $170,000 for a scheme to extort money
from a coal operator and buy votes.
   The 67-year-old Mr. Moore, a three-term Republican
governor, pleaded guilty in April to charges of extortion,
obstruction of justice, and tax and mail fraud. He faced a
maximum penalty of 36 years in prison and fines of as much as
$1.2 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It's not clear whether Mr. Moore will appeal. He couldn't
be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Attorneys for Mr. Moore had asked to withdraw the guilty
plea, saying the former governor was rushed into his plea.
But federal Judge Walter Hoffman denied the request Monday.
The former governor remains free on bond until July 31, when
he is scheduled to report to a minimum-security prison in
Petersburg, Va.</p>
<p>Michael W. Carey, a U.S. attorney in West Virginia, called
the sentence significant and proof that even former West
Virginia governors go to jail if they "violate the public
trust."</p>
<p>The judge sentenced Mr. Moore to concurrent terms of five
years for extortion, six months for mail fraud and two years
for each of two charges of tax fraud. In addition, he was
sentenced to 10 months in prison on the obstruction of
justice charge.</p>
<p>Prosecutors say Mr. Moore illegally diverted $100,000 in
state funds to his 1984 election campaign, which his
supporters used to buy votes from residents in southern West
Virginia counties.</p>
<p>The extortion charge relates to a scheme in which he
agreed to use his influence as governor to refund $2.3
million from the state's black-lung fund to a coal operator.
In return, the coal operator agreed to offer Mr. Moore 25% of
the refund in kickbacks, according to the indictments by the
Charleston grand jury.</p>
<p>The black-lung fund is a coal industry-funded pool of
money that provides payments to disabled miners who suffer
from the disease.</p>
<p>The tax fraud counts allege that Mr. Moore filed false
campaign finance statements and tax returns in 1984 and 1985.
The obstruction of justice charge related to Mr. Moore's
alleged attempt to influence the testimony of two witnesses
during the investigation.</p>
<p>Mr. Moore served as governor from 1969 to 1977 and from
1985 to 1989.</p>
