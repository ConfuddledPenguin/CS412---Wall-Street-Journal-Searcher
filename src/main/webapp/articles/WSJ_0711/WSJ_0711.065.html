	<p class="article-leader">PHONY REPORTS of nonwage payments lead the scheme's
promoter to conviction.
   A federal jury in Fargo, N.D., has found Roger N. Elvick
of Moorhead, Minn., and three others guilty of filing false
documents with the IRS. Elvick is said to have concocted and
promoted a widespread scheme to file Form 1099 reports
showing nonwage payments of millions of dollars to officials
and others. Undetected false 1099s may lead to needless and
costly audits. The defendants were accused of trying to
harass people they felt had wronged them.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Also convicted: Ronald W. Knutt, Natalie C. Telemaque and
Thomas D. Porter. Sentencing hasn't been set; maximum prison
terms for the offenses range from three to five years. The
first of six persons facing similar charges in Albuquerque,
N.M., Jean R. Canon, is to go on trial tomorrow. A second,
Peggy R. Williams, may go on trial Monday. A videotape of
Elvick presenting his tax-protest and harassment scheme was
found in the Farmington, N.M., office of Mrs. Williams and
her husband, Clinton P. Williams, a co-defendant.</p>
<p>Elvick and his three co-defendants refused to attend their
trial in Fargo. They stayed in jail and called no witnesses
in their defense.</p>
<p>SPURIOUS 1099s have sparked 65 criminal investigations in
16 states.</p>
<p>That's up from 40 such investigations two months ago. So
far, the IRS has intercepted 3,343 forms reporting phony
payments of $20.5 billion and filed by 271 persons in 29
states, says Tim Wellesley, director of the Fargo district,
which began coordinating the cases last fall. Some of those
people also filed 115 tax returns for 1988 and 1989 falsely
claiming refunds of $8.3 billion.</p>
<p>The IRS and the Justice Department decline to discuss the
continuing investigations; but the areas include North
Dakota, Minnesota, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and New York.
A man facing marijuana charges in Sacramento, Calif., is said
to have filed false 1099s naming federal and state judges and
law-enforcement officials; he hasn't been charged with a
crime related to the 1099s. In Sioux City, Iowa, the Justice
Department got a civil injunction ordering a man not to file
false 1099s or take other actions to harass IRS agents.</p>
<p>CAN COMPUTERS TAKE OVER the selection of returns for
audit?</p>
<p>The IRS already uses computers to score returns for
possible audit. Returns with high scores then go to human
classifiers, who analyze the issues to determine whether they
warrant auditing. Now "artificial-intelligence" experts are
developing a computer system to emulate the decision-making
processes of the IRS's best classifiers. The system will be
used this year in the Andover, Mass., service center to
classify 12,000 1989 returns with high scores.</p>
<p>The IRS says it got good results in a previous test of a
prototype, using returns from earlier years that already had
been classified and having expert classifiers analyze any
differences. For 63% of the returns, the computer did a
better job than staff classifiers did. The staff did better
with 18%. The results were the same for 19%.</p>
<p>If the Andover test goes well, the system will be tested
in Atlanta next year. It could be in use in all 10 centers in
a few years.</p>
<p>THE PAYOFF: Ex-mayor Lee Alexander of Syracuse, N.Y.,
pleaded guilty in 1988 of extortion and evading taxes. Now
the Tax Court says he owes taxes of $667,681, plus civil
fraud and other penalties, on unreported kickback income of
$1.3 million.</p>
<p>A FLAT FEE of 25 cents is charged in California for each
used tire left with dealers; the state's tire-recycling fund
gets the cash. Critics note that vehicle-fleet owners might
avoid the tax by dumping cast-offs themselves and wonder why
the fee isn't imposed on sales of new tires.</p>
<p>CHANGES IN CONTROL and recapitalizations occurring after
last March 31 must be reported by certain corporations, under
the 1989 tax act. Newly proposed IRS rules limit reporting to
transactions valued at $10 million or more. The IRS expects
about 10,000 filings a year on new Form 8820.</p>
<p>HE MADE HIS MARK by writing wrong, the Tax Court says.</p>
<p>Edward Voccola of Cranston, R.I., was an owner and manager
of an auto-body shop. IRS auditors said he endorsed over
$100,000 in insurance-company checks for customers' repairs
in 1973 and 1974 and kept the cash without reporting it as
his income or the firm's. Voccola was convicted of insurance
fraud and perjury, but he and the firm went to court to
contest IRS claims for taxes and civil fraud penalties. The
script for his plea: He couldn't have signed the checks,
because he can't read or write.</p>
<p>Voccola even claimed he had others sign his name to a
marriage-license form, a voter-registration form, a power of
attorney, and many other witnessed or notarized documents.
But no one took the stand to endorse his claims, and a
handwriting expert testified that the same person had signed
31 of the documents over 25 years. Also, Voccola wrote his
signature in court, albeit laboriously and apparently to
distort it.</p>
<p>Judge Shields ruled that Voccola signed the checks and
found him and the firm liable for fraud penalties.</p>
<p>BRIEFS: Groups volunteering to participate in Tax
Counseling for the Elderly next year must apply to the IRS by
Aug. 15; for information, phone 202-566-6603. . . . IRS
Revenue Ruling 90-53 says South African taxes for years after
1987 don't qualify for foreign credits against U.S. taxes.</p>
