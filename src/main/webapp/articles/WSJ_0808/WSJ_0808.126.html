	<p class="article-leader">Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices each claimed
victory in a U.S. District Court judge's preliminary ruling
in a copyright dispute over the use of Intel microcode
technology in Advanced Micro's products.
   Since 1976 Intel has allowed Advanced Micro to use some
microcode technology for internal office use, but last March
the company filed a lawsuit to prohibit Advanced Micro from
proceeding with a plan to distribute the technology in its
own computer chips. Microcode is the software that tells a
chip how to perform its function.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While not ruling on that final issue, U.S. District Court
Judge William Ingram yesterday issued a preliminary
injunction that bars Advanced Micro from using the Intel
product name as an advertising tool or including computer
chips bearing the Intel name in its product line. The judge,
however, said Advanced Micro would be permitted to continue
using a numbering system that mirror's Intel's own line of
chips.</p>
<p>In Santa Clara, Calif., Intel's chief counsel said the
court ruling just affirmed their position, and that the
preliminary injunction was filed to "maintain the status quo"
until a trial scheduled for February decides the copyrights
of the company. In Sunnyvale, Calif., a spokesman for
Advanced Micro said the company was equally satisfied because
the judge refused to halt sales of the company's mathematics
coprocessors with the "87" numbering system attached to the
covers. Advanced Micro has been selling the products for
about six weeks.</p>
<p>"The only issue we are interested in is the conflict over
the numbering system used to designate the models," an
Advanced Micro company spokesman said. He said the company
had previously agreed to remove the Intel name from its
computer chips and in its advertisements.</p>
