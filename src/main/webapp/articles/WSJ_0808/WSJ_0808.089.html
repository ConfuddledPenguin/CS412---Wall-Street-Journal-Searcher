	<p class="article-leader">TOO LATE TO DIG A MOAT? Fake a foreclosure to keep the IRS
out.
   Richard L. and Shirley A. Connelly of Las Vegas, Nev.,
were consistent, at least. In 1986, they were convicted of
not filing returns for two years and of filing a false refund
claim for another. A judge sentenced them to a year in jail
and $5,000 fines, but released them on probation after six
months on condition that they pay their taxes and cooperate
with the IRS. Last year, they went back to jail; they had
refused to cooperate and had paid only $17,134 of a $51,843
tax bill -- through involuntary wage levies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The couple also tried to hide ownership of their one
asset, their home: They said they mortgaged it for $65,000 to
Nassau Life Insurance Co., trustee for Benco Management Co.
of the Turks and Caicos Islands, and gave the cash to their
children, who "blew it." Benco supposedly foreclosed for
default -- then rented the house to the Connellys. But the
IRS tied Benco to a well-known tax protester and showed the
fraudulent deals were "self-serving fictions."</p>
<p>Shirley Connelly appealed the revocation of her probation.
Now the ninth-circuit appeals court has upheld it.</p>
<p>WARNING FLAGS RISE over non-profits that rent out logos
and donor lists.</p>
<p>Many charities earn a lot by rentals to insurers,
credit-card issuers, and others. But rental income may fall
in a gray area: It may be treated as taxable business income
-- or as tax-free passive royalties from intangible assets.
In February, Disabled American Veterans won a major victory
when the Tax Court, split 12-4, said its donor-list rentals
were royalties. But two new IRS actions indicate that
non-profits should be cautious in offering rentals, says
Laura Kalick of Coopers & Lybrand, CPAs.</p>
<p>The IRS now says it will appeal the DAV case. And in
private ruling 9029047, it has reversed its own 1988 ruling
and told an unidentified charity that licensing name and logo
to an insurer was taxable because the license was intertwined
with taxable member-list rentals. Kalick says the IRS
apparently now contends that maintaining a mailing list for
rental is an active business -- and that name and logo income
must be purely passive to qualify as royalties.</p>
<p>HER $50,000 MERCEDES was just a token of the boss's
esteem, they said.</p>
<p>John J. Deisher of Dallas was a regional v.p. of Fannie
Mae, the home-mortgage financer, when his wife, Judy, was
hired by a condominium developer. The developer was
extravagant and bragged he had "bought" public officials; he
gave lavish gifts to his employees. In 1983, when Judy
Deisher reported $35,000 of wage and commission income, the
developer gave her $50,000 to buy a Mercedes for her
birthday; she didn't report the $50,000 as income. Later, the
couple invested in the developer's projects.</p>
<p>The developer subsequently was charged with various
frauds. The Deishers, who filed for bankruptcy in 1988,
weren't linked to the charges. But they turned to the Tax
Court when the IRS sought to tax them on the $50,000 "gift."
Now Judge Cohen says the developer didn't give the money out
of "detached and disinterested generosity," but in the
expectation -- justified or not -- of benefiting from his
connection with a high-ranking Fannie Mae official.</p>
<p>The $50,000 was taxable income for the Deishers, the judge
says.</p>
<p>NIMBLE NUMBERERS at the IRS have devised a system to help
spot sole proprietors' unreported income. It cross-checks
third-party reports of payments to proprietors filed under
their employer numbers against proprietors' tax returns filed
under their Social Security numbers.</p>
<p>NEVADA HIKES THE ODDS against residents who register cars,
boats, or planes outside the state to escape sales tax. It
offers a penalty amnesty through Sept. 30; then an
enforcement drive begins. The penalty is as much as triple
the tax.</p>
<p>WE WOULDN'T DREAM of letting psychologist Joseph Franklin
Martel deduct med-school costs as business expenses incurred
before he took up the trade, the Tax Court says. Nor may the
El Paso, Texas, man deduct them as research expenses.</p>
<p>S-CORPORATION STATUS may reward a service business most
when it is sold.</p>
<p>A closely held S concern is taxed much like a partnership:
Owners, not the company, are taxed on corporate income. That
may not bring large immediate benefits to many doctors,
lawyers, CPAs, and other personal-service professionals
operating in regular corporate status. But owner-employees
who sell thriving businesses may be glad they elected S
status, says John Donchess of Packer, Thomas & Co., CPAs in
Youngstown, Ohio.</p>
<p>When a regular corporation is sold, its gain is subject to
tax; then the proceeds distributed to shareholders are
taxable to them. But for S corporations, this double taxation
is limited; it applies only to gains in asset values achieved
before the first Scorporation year. Any appreciation in the
business's value after its conversion to S status generally
is taxed just once -- to the selling shareholders.</p>
<p>An S election can hold down the tax on intangible "good
will," often the fastest growing asset, Donchess notes.</p>
<p>BRIEFS: Sweden enacted an innovative carbon-dioxide tax on
fossil fuels, but cut other energy taxes. . . . The IRS
announced an agreement with Korea to coordinate audits of
taxpayers operating in both countries. . . . Massachusetts'
1990 income-tax returns will include a checkoff allowing
filers to contribute to AIDS programs.</p>
