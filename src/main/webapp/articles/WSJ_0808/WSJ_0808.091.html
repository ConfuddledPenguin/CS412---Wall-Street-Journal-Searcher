	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Postal Service said it's making progress
in boosting productivity and narrowing losses, but not enough
to affect its plans for a new round of rate increases.
   The estimated postal deficit for the fiscal year ending
Sept. 30 will be less than $1 billion, compared with the $1.6
billion loss originally projected, Postmaster General Anthony
Frank told his board of governors and a news conference. He
credited the narrowing to productivity gains, which have been
escalating over the past 12 months, reaching 3.4% in the
quarter ended June 30.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The benefits of a major postal automation program and a
recently imposed ceiling on employment levels are responsible
for improving productivity, Mr. Frank said. The Postal
Service has been installing automatic equipment that reads
envelopes and sorts them according to nine-digit address
codes. Hiring curbs also have helped reduce its work force by
23,000, to 764,000, since June 1989, officials said.</p>
<p>But Mr. Frank said the improvement isn't sufficient to
alter the plan to boost rates by an average of 19%, including
an increase of five cents to 30 cents for first-class
service. The rise would occur early in 1991, after
consideration by the Postal Rate Commission.</p>
<p>In defending the rate increase's size, Mr. Frank noted the
uncertainty over how well the agency can do in holding down
labor costs in talks with unions, which begin late this
month, and the White House budget office's efforts to require
the service to contribute $1.3 billion to U.S. deficit
reduction.</p>
