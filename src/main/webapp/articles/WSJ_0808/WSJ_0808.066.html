	<p class="article-leader">CAMBRIDGE, Ontario -- Jose Banos doesn't have to worry
about mowing his lawn this summer: It's been repossessed.
   At least, that's what Mr. Banos and his wife, Maria, say
happened to their acre lot after they refused to pay a local
landscaping firm 2,900 Canadian dollars (US$2,523) for sowing
grass seed on their back lawn.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Instead of growing grass, Mr. and Mrs. Banos say, their
lawn sprouted a fine crop of weeds this spring. Unhappy with
the job, they say they refused to pay the bill, figuring that
being taken to court would be the worst that could happen.</p>
<p>They were wrong. Mrs. Banos says the landscaper, Gordon
Kinzie, telephoned on a Friday morning to say that if he
didn't have full payment for the seeding job by that noon, he
was going to dig up the lawn. "I figured he was crazy until
two bulldozers showed up and started plowing up and down, up
and down, shoving all the soil and all the weeds up into a
big pile at the end of the garden," Mrs. Banos says.</p>
<p>Mr. Kinzie agrees that he and another man bulldozed the
lawn after the Banoses repeatedly refused to pay the seeding
bill. "We did soil tests, that's the story we're sticking
with," he says. Mr. Banos had complained there wasn't enough
soil for the grass to grow properly, the landscaper says, "so
we checked every bit of it because we wanted to be thorough."
He adds: "There's lots of soil there, only now it's all in a
big pile at the other end of the garden."</p>
<p>Mr. Kinzie's novel method of debt collection comes up for
consideration in Ontario's provincial court Monday, when he
faces charges of trespassing. The landscaper insists he
wasn't trespassing. "I asked Mr. Banos for permission to fix
the lawn, and he said go ahead," Mr. Kinzie says. "So I fixed
it. Maybe that wasn't what he had in mind as far as fixing
goes, but he did give me permission."</p>
<p>Mr. Kinzie says he and many other contractors are fed up
with customers who don't pay once a job on their home is
completed. "Because I'd waited to submit my bill, to ensure
they were satisfied, I couldn't put a lien on the house," he
says. "If I took them to court, it would take ages and I
might wind up paying my lawyers more than I collected from
them."</p>
<p>The Banos's lawyer, Timothy Hilborn, says the courts may
cost time and money, "but you can't just breeze in there and
say, hey, that's my lawn, give it back."</p>
