	<p class="article-leader">Backer Spielvogel Bates, stung by several major account
losses since January, announced a management realignment and
said it is searching for a new U.S. creative director.
   Carl Spielvogel, chairman and chief executive officer of
the big Saatchi & Saatchi unit, said senior executives Dean
Scaros and Ken Rogers will be promoted to new U.S. positions.
The changes may help to diffuse criticism -- which has been
growing proportionately to Backer's account losses -- that
the 61-year-old Mr. Spielvogel is a one-man show without
sufficient management depth to back him up.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The move to bring in a heavyweight creative executive,
meanwhile, could appease critics who say the big agency's
creative product is getting stale. Robert Lenz, chairman of
the U.S. company, had also been filling in as U.S. creative
director, but industry executives say the agency needs a
creative shot in the arm if it is to reverse its fading U.S.
fortunes. Bill Backer, 63, an agency co-founder who is
probably best known for penning "I'd like to teach the world
to sing" for Coke, remains world-wide creative director.</p>
<p>"It's evident they're having problems. This looks to be a
decisive attempt to correct the problems. I would be
encouraged by it from that standpoint," said James Dougherty,
an analyst with County NatWest Securities. Backer in January
lost the $60 million Prudential Insurance account. Since
then, it has had a rough streak in the U.S., losing the $15
million to $20 million Fisher-Price account, the $13 million
Jhirmack account and most recently, the $25 million-plus
Xerox corporate account.</p>
<p>Mr. Spielvogel, though, said the moves weren't related to
Backer's U.S. difficulties. "This is a further refinement of
the organization moving forward. Renewal in a
personal-service business is constant. Companies that don't
renew themselves end up going down," he said.</p>
<p>Indeed, the high-profile executive, who prides himself on
his hands-on attention to clients, insisted that the agency
isn't having problems in the U.S. at all. "I think of all the
companies in the Saatchi group, we are the closest to budget
this year of any of them, and the U.S. company is right on
budget," he said. He said U.S. billings will be "slightly
ahead" of last year because of gains from existing clients,
like Miller Brewing, Wendy's and Hyundai, and the world-wide
company's billings will be up about 12% over last year's $5.1
billion for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30.</p>
<p>Under the management realignment, Dean Scaros, 44,
currently president of the U.S. company, adds the title of
chief operating officer, a position vacant since the
retirement last year of G. Robert Holmen. He also remains
head of the agency's Miller Brewing account. Ken Rogers, 43,
executive vice president and the key executive in charge of
Backer's big Mars account, becomes managing director of the
New York office, succeeding Mr. Scaros.</p>
<p>Mr. Lenz, the U.S. agency chairman who has also been
acting as U.S. creative director, is currently interviewing
people for the creative job "internally as well as
externally," Mr. Spielvogel said.</p>
<p>Some industry executives questioned whether Backer can
attract a high-profile creative executive, considering that
Mr. Spielvogel is so closely identified as the face of the
company -- and considering that Ted Bates, one of Backer's
two predecessor companies, had a reputation for
extraordinarily workmanlike ads. But Mr. Spielvogel said the
new creative executive "will have the necessary autonomy to
get the job done."</p>
<p>In the wake of the account losses, speculation has been
mounting that Saatchi's new chief executive, Robert
Louis-Dreyfus, thought management changes were needed to
shore up Backer's U.S. business. Mr. Louis-Dreyfus couldn't
be reached, but Mr. Spielvogel bristled at any suggestion
that the Saatchi executive played a part in the changes.</p>
<p>"Robert has nothing to say in the operation of BSB. He
sits in budget meetings and reviews financial forecasts and
results," Mr. Spielvogel said. "He doesn't come out of an ad
agency background. I don't tell him how to run the parent
company, and he doesn't tell me how to run BSB Worldwide."</p>
<p>Mr. Spielvogel also said his own job wouldn't be affected
by the changes. The executive, who travels world-wide almost
nonstop and who at the slightest provocation will hop on a
plane to have an eyeball-to-eyeball chat with a client, said
he doesn't plan to retire for at least five years. The
management changes "have nothing to do with succession at the
parent company," he said. "This has to do with succession in
the U.S. company."</p>
<p>Wall Street analysts, though, said the changes send a
positive signal that Mr. Spielvogel, who is widely perceived
as a one-man band even though his far-flung organization
numbers 6,600, is willing to share responsibility. "This guy
is spreading himself a little thin, and that's been a
concern," said Alan Gottesman, an analyst with PaineWebber.
"But he isn't a one-man show. There's a normal evolutionary
current that runs through this thing."</p>

<p>Ad Notes. . . .
</p>
<p>EARNINGS: WPP Group PLC said net for the fiscal six months
ended June 30 rose 95% to #27 million ($50.1 million), or 42
pence a share, from #13.9 million, or 33.9 pence, in the
year-earlier period. Revenue rose 89% to #626.2 million from
#330.9 million. The huge earnings jump was due in large part
to the inclusion for the first time of earnings from Ogilvy
Group, which WPP acquired in May last year. But London-based
WPP, which also owns J. Walter Thompson, said a lower tax
rate, cost-control and a strong new-business record
contributed to the higher earnings.</p>
<p>NEW ACCOUNT: Dutch Dairy Bureau awarded its ad account to
the New York office of Hal Riney & Partners. The agency will
create ads promoting Dutch cheeses. Billings haven't been
determined.</p>
