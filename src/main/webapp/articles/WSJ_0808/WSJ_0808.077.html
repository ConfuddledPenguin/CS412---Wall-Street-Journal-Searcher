	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- President Bush has decided against
intervening in the proposed acquisition of Norton Co. by
Compagnie de Saint-Gobain of France.
   Worcester, Mass.-based Norton makes abrasive products and
enginering materials and has engaged in extensive research
and development of advanced ceramics and diamond films deemed
to have national security significance.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the
Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States found
that the acquisition wouldn't impair national security.</p>
<p>Last month, Saint-Gobain's subsidiary, SG Acquisition
Corp., extended its $90-a-share tender offer for all of
Norton's common shares outstanding to 5 p.m. EDT today.</p>
