	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Whitman Corp., which has been trying to improve
results at its big Pet Inc. food subsidiary, said the unit's
president and chief executive officer, J. Robert Copper,
agreed to resign.
   A Whitman spokesman said Mr. Copper, 50 years old, stepped
aside after Whitman's president, Miles L. Marsh, made it
clear he felt improving Pet's performance required a
management change. Mr. Copper, reached at his home in St.
Louis, didn't dispute that, but said he quit because it was
apparent that his path to the top of Whitman was blocked.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"There can only be one CEO in a company," Mr. Copper said.
He joined what was then IC Industries in 1980 as vice
president in charge of strategic planning, and handled
acquisitions and divestitures for the conglomerate. In 1988,
he was named Pet president, and had hopes of some day running
the renamed Whitman, he said, but his "upward track" appeared
blocked beginning about six months ago. IC Industries was
renamed to Whitman Corp. in 1988.</p>
<p>"It's better for my career," Mr. Copper said. "After
discussing the future of the whole corporation, my
aspirations were not consistent with what the corporation saw
for me." After some time off, Mr. Copper said, he plans to
look at other opportunities.</p>
<p>Whitman has sold a lot of businesses to focus on consumer
products and services. Mr. Marsh will oversee Pet's
day-to-day operations while the company looks for a successor
to Mr. Copper, Whitman said.</p>
<p>Pet accounts for about 50% of Whitman's sales, which were
$1.96 billion for the first half of 1990, with profit of
$58.6 million, or 38 cents a share.</p>
