	<p class="article-leader">Eva Berg Shoen, wife of U-Haul heir Dr. Sam Shoen, was
murdered in what authorities say resembled "a professional
hit," and they are looking for a connection to the family
feud over the U-Haul empire.
   "The controversy surrounding that family {and} U-Haul is
certainly an angle we're investigating," says Bill Masters,
sheriff of San Miguel County, Colo.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mrs. Shoen, 43 years old, was shot early Monday in the
family home outside Telluride. The murder apparently occurred
while her three children slept undisturbed in the house, and
Sheriff Masters said it did not appear to be a case of either
sexual assault or burglary. "There's something else" going on
here, he said. "This doesn't appear to be a local issue."</p>
<p>At the time of the murder, the victim's husband was in
Phoenix, Ariz., base of the embattled U-Haul empire. As
reported in a recent front-page Wall Street Journal story,
Dr. Shoen is battling with certain of his 11 siblings over
control of the empire founded by their father, L.S. Shoen.</p>
<p>At present, the company -- a subsidiary of Amerco -- is
being run by siblings unfriendly to Dr. Shoen's cause. But a
company spokesman denied that the family dispute could have
had anything to do with Mrs. Shoen's death. "The whole family
is devastated," said the spokesman.</p>
<p>Dr. Shoen is offering a $250,000 reward for information
leading to the arrest of his wife's murderer.</p>
