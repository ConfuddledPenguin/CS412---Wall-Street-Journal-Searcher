	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The growing sense of economic crisis, the
result of spurting oil prices and the newly evident slowing
of the U.S. economy, is likely to hasten an agreement on the
budget deficit but shrink the size of the first-year package,
participants in the budget talks say.
   When negotiators settled on a goal of reducing the fiscal
1991 deficit by $50 billion in the spring, the economy
appeared substantially stronger. Some negotiators, in
Congress and the Bush administration, now are resigned to the
fact that the objective will be reduced when talks resume
after Labor Day. "With the economy in a state of slow growth,
people get worried that any adjustment will tip us over,"
said Rep. Bill Frenzel (R., Minn.).</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta (D., Calif.),
among the Democrats who is the strongest advocate of
negotiating a compromise with the administration, said:
"Obviously, we are going to have to make some adjustments
based on what is happening with the economy."</p>
<p>Negotiators and their staffs caution, however, that
developments in the Middle East and in the economy during the
next month will be important. No firm decisions are likely to
be made before Labor Day. "If you have an accumulation of
events -- both in terms of the Middle East as well as the
economy -- that indicate increasing trouble, that would be
added impetus to arrive at some kind of agreement," Rep.
Panetta said.</p>
<p>One solution, negotiators say, may be an agreement that
falls short of the $50 billion first-year objective, but
raises taxes and cuts government benefit programs in
subsequent years. Congress could enact a law this fall, but
delay the effectiveness of some aspects of it.</p>
<p>The risk, of course, is that such an agreement won't be
seen as credible by financial markets and the Federal
Reserve. There is no point in approving politically costly
tax increases and spending cuts unless interest rates fall as
a result, one Democratic congressional strategist said
yesterday.</p>
<p>Some economists say that this option might be the most
prudent. "Make a commitment, but don't cut too drastically
all at once," advised Victor Zarnowitz, a University of
Chicago economist. He emphasized that simply pledging deficit
reduction in the future won't suffice.</p>
<p>A weak economy "might be an argument for lowering your
sights for fiscal 1991," says Robert Reischauer, director of
the Congressional Budget Office, "but it shouldn't result in
any easing of the five-year effort."</p>
<p>Several budget negotiators said -- with hindsight, of
course -- that the best moment to strike a significant
deficit-reduction accord was last fall or early this spring.
"I told the administration last year to get their deficit
reduction then," said Sen. Jim Sasser (D., Tenn.), chairman
of the Senate Budget Committee. "If you get to the point
where you're entering a recession or in a recession, it's
going to make it more difficult."</p>
<p>At least in the minds of important members of Congress,
the weak economy and the turmoil in the Middle East are
removing what little credibility remained in the
administration's threat to allow $84 billion in automatic
spending cuts to take effect on Oct. 1. The Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law requires the cuts unless an agreement
is reached to bring the projected fiscal 1991 deficit below
$74 billionor the law is altered, as some in Congress
predict.</p>
<p>"Those cuts would produce nothing less than sheer
disaster," says Rep. Panetta. "Nobody is going to select that
out of choice."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the administration continues to rattle the
Gramm-Rudman saber. White House Budget Director Richard
Darman yesterday briefed the cabinet on the Gramm-Rudman
cuts, and asked all federal agencies to submit plans for
carrying out such cuts by Aug. 27.</p>
<p>"You will likely need to initiate a number of personnel
actions, including elimination of overtime, hiring
limitations or freezes, furloughs of temporary employees, and
finally furloughs of permanent employees," Mr. Darman said in
a memo sent to all federal agencies yesterday.</p>
<p>Layoff notices would be issued in September, perhaps in
the midst of congressional debate over a deficit-reduction
accord, administration officials said.</p>
<p>Mr. Darman estimated that the Gramm-Rudman cuts, if put
into effect, would slash spending in affected non-defense
agencies by 31.9% as of Oct. 1. President Bush must decide by
next Wednesday whether to exempt military personnel from the
Gramm-Rudman cuts. If he does, as seems likely in the current
situation, other defense accounts would be cut by 34.9%, Mr.
Darman said.</p>
<p>Without congressional action of some sort, agencies must
carry out the spending cuts. "This is enforceable by criminal
penalties," Mr. Darman warned.</p>
