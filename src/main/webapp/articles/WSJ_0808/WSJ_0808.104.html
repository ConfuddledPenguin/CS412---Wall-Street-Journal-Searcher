	<p class="article-leader">MOSCOW -- The Soviet Union would support possible military
moves to enforce the economic blockade against Iraq and might
participate militarily if the action were on a multilateral
basis, says a senior Foreign Ministry official.
   "We would prefer to . . . go through United Nations
channels to organize international mechanisms, or force if
needed, to patrol and enforce this embargo," says Sergei
Tarasenko, a close adviser to Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze, in an interview. "I wouldn't rule out the
possibility of Soviet military participation on such a
collective basis. This is not for show. We want to get
results."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Since Iraq invaded Kuwait, the Soviet Union has engaged in
unprecedented joint action with the West, giving impressive
substance to what is touted here as "new thinking."</p>
<p>In its response, the Soviet Union has effectively junked a
decades-long policy of support for radical Third World
regimes. The message from Moscow is clear: An alliance with
the West is worth more than dubious arrangements with
dictators.</p>
<p>"This aggression gives the chance for Soviet foreign
policy to continue its review regarding Third World military
regimes, which were built up and which existed with Soviet
assistance," says Victor Kremenyuk, a deputy director at the
USA and Canada Institute and adviser to the parliament's
committee on international affairs. "It gives us the moral
grounds, it gives us the political grounds. There can't be
anyone now who'd raise a voice and say, `Look, the Soviets
are abandoning their friends.'"</p>
<p>In recent days political analysts have reiterated the idea
that only with the West can the Soviet Union find the
solution to its internal problems. Soviet and U.S.
policymakers have been in daily contact by phone and telex on
the Iraqi crisis, Soviet officials say. They stress that it
is important to grab this chance to prove the Soviet Union is
sincere in calling for a reduction in world arms levels and
East-West confrontation.</p>
<p>"It's the first case of what we now define as a
partnership relationship," says Mr. Tarasenko. "As partners
we're supposed to do more than just cooperate."</p>
<p>Soviet analysts have even rejected the suggestion that the
rise in oil prices caused by the Iraqi invasion might benefit
the Soviet Union, a major oil exporter.</p>
<p>Some Western oil industry analysts have said the gains
will be huge. Roger W. Robinson Jr., a private consultant who
was senior director of international economic affairs at the
National Security Council during the Reagan administration,
told a congressional hearing in Washington: "Moscow is even
now taking the Iraq-Kuwait crisis to the bank in terms of
pocketing roughly $1 billion annually for every $1 increase
in the price of a barrel of oil."</p>
<p>But Soviet economists say that higher oil prices will make
debt servicing more expensive and drive up prices on consumer
products that the Soviet Union increasingly hopes to import
from the West.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's economic problems are also too vast to
be helped by a sudden influx of dollars. Some experts say a
wave of convertible currency would be counterproductive. "If
the money now appears simply by price increases, the
motivation to change the economy would immediately become
weaker," says Mr. Kremenyuk.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union also has experienced a steady decline in
oil production in the past several years. Old wells have
matured and new technology is needed for extracting new
resources. In addition, the Soviet Union won't receive about
10 million tons of oil that it is owed by Iraq for weapons
shipped in the past, Mr. Tarasenko says.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union is counting on Western help as it tries
to shift to a market-driven economy. "We are extremely
interested in safeguarding the business situation in the
U.S.," says Mr. Kremenyuk. "It is to our interest to
safeguard it so that the West can continue to supply us with
aid and investment."</p>
<p>All this has driven the Soviet Union to its recent series
of stunning moves. Some diplomats recall that an Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait would have caused a full-blown military
alert in the West just a short time ago. Now, the Soviet
Union has stopped its arms shipments to Baghdad, issued the
joint statement of condemnation with the U.S. and supported
the United Nations' economic embargo of Iraq.</p>
<p>Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh said that
Soviet warships are on patrol in the Indian Ocean and that
two of those ships -- an anti-submarine ship and a command
ship -- are sailing toward the Strait of Hormuz. In light of
the situation, he said, "this is a usual, normal measure."</p>
<p>Soviet experts say that by cutting off arms, the Soviet
Union has already hit Iraq in its most vulnerable spot. And
by cooperating swiftly with the U.S., the Soviet Union has
made it clear to Iraq that the two superpowers can no longer
be played off against each other.</p>
<p>Some Soviets say that is all the Soviet Union needs to or
can do. They say that the problem is in the hands of the
West, and of Turkey and Saudi Arabia, which control the
pipelines by which Iraqi oil is delivered.</p>
<p>"It's out of the question for the Soviet Union to take
place in any kind of military action," says Georgi Mirsky, an
authority on the Mideast at an influential government
think-tank. "We don't have this responsibility. Maybe we're
not a superpower anymore."</p>
<p>However, experts say that even if the Soviet Union doesn't
support the West militarily, it won't provide intelligence
information on aircraft movements to Iraq as it would have in
the past.</p>
<p>"The Iraqis understand that they'd get no information,"
says Mr. Kremenyuk. "They'd be blind."</p>
<p>Arms supplies and intelligence support have been the basis
for Soviet relationships with Third World nations for a long
time. Recently a vigorous debate has been under way here
about the wisdom of those ties, focusing particularly on the
financial demands of aiding such nations as Cuba.</p>
<p>The Iraqi crisis will propel this argument forward. When
parliament reconvenes in September, the Soviet Union may
formally abrogate its 20-year-old friendship treaty with
Iraq. The Soviet Union also will look at changing its
priorities in the Middle East, and a likely focus of new
efforts will be Saudi Arabia. So far, Saudi Arabia has
resisted some Soviet attempts at strengthening ties. Now,
says Mr. Tarasenko, the Iraqi crisis may give the efforts new
impetus. "Just the announcement that Saudi Arabia and
U.S.S.R. agreed to move toward full diplomatic relations
would be a strong signal to Iraq," he says.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Soviet Union will probably undertake a
thorough reassessment of some dozen treaties with Third World
nations, many of which were formed in the 1970s. "We accept
the criticism that we should be more choosy in allying
ourselves with certain regimes, governments and so on," says
Mr. Tarasenko. "This is a very important threshold in Soviet
overall foreign relations."</p>
