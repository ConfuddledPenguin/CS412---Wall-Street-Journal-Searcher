	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Centaur Partners Group won three seats on the
board of National Intergroup Inc., unseating Chairman Howard
M. Love.
   Elected to the board were Melvyn J. Estrin, a principal of
Centaur; Robert J. Slater, former vice chairman of Crane Co.;
and William G. Tull, former president of American Security
Bank. Centaur said its slate received two-thirds of the
shares cast at National Intergroup's meeting July 25.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A spokeswoman for National Intergroup said that the
results of the preliminary count, reported by Centaur,
corresponds with their tally. The company had no further
comment.</p>
<p>Centaur also said that three of its governance resolutions
were approved by between 65% and 70% of shareholders. Those
resolutions provide for confidential voting by stockholders,
prevent the board from lowering the trigger of the company's
shareholder-rights plan below 20% and require a majority of
stockholders' approval of any golden-parachute plans for
management.</p>
