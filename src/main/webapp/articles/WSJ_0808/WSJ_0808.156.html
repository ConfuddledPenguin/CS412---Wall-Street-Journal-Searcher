	<p class="article-leader">Turmoil in the Mideast has handed American oil companies a
big public relations challenge: How to explain why prices at
the pump jumped so fast.
   But so far, industry experts and crisis management
consultants say, the oil companies are fumbling, shouldering
the brunt of Americans' anger even though the situation may
be beyond their control.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The oil industry must enjoy wearing the black hat," says
Paul Fullmer, president of the Chicago-based public-relations
firm Selz, Seabolt & Associates. "They have again dropped the
ball."</p>
<p>But others say that, given the circumstances, the oil
companies are doing the best they can. "Given the
uncertainties in the Middle East, it's probably inappropriate
for them to do much more than they are doing," says Robert
Dilenschneider, chief executive of Hill & Knowlton, a public
relations firm that advises major oil companies. "It's like
driving on a mountain in a heavy storm. You're not sure
what's around the next bend."</p>
<p>Still, any mistakes could prove costly in the long run.
U.S. oil companies are already reeling from such public
relations disasters as the grounding of the Exxon Valdez. In
the early 1970s, oil shortages and price increases after the
Arab oil embargo helped lead to the loss of some industry tax
credits, the passage of a windfall profits tax and an
antitrust complaint against the eight biggest oil companies.</p>
<p>This time, industry officials fear that the public outcry
could set back industry efforts to regain drilling rights in
environmentally sensitive areas -- at a time when the
industry needs them the most.</p>
<p>The oil companies say they are doing all they can to
explain why price increases are necessary. "Our policy is to
be prompt, straightforward, sincere and honest with all
inquiries," Shell Oil Co. said in a written response to
questions yesterday. "We recognize we are dealing with an
extremely volatile and consumer-sensitive area."</p>
<p>Douglas Elmets, director of media relations for Atlantic
Richfield Co., says that between the time of the invasion and
yesterday afternoon, he was interviewed 92 times, while the
president of the company's marketing arm was involved in six
interviews with TV stations, one with radio and three with
major newspapers.</p>
<p>But even those who have tried to get their positions out
to the public say the industry could do better. Dale Basye,
manager of corporate communications at Chevron Corp., says
the company had up to 10 people at once answering inquiries,
and made senior economists available for a televised rebuttal
of an industry pricing critic's charges.</p>
<p>Still, he says, the company hasn't yet decided whether to
involve senior corporate officers: "It's something we've been
looking at," he says. "Unfortunately, it's been reactive up
to this point. Now we are looking at ways to take the
initiative."</p>
<p>And privately, some industry spokespeople bemoan the
industry's passivity. "You always say we wish we had {done
more}," says one. "I'm not the decision maker." Another
complains that competitors were "unwilling or reluctant" to
address the topic directly, while yet another berates
industry officials for "burying their heads in the sand."</p>
<p>Since the industry takes the position that immediate price
increases are necessary and unavoidable, public relations and
crisis experts say, the industry should have moved much more
quickly and actively to explain that. In particular, they
say, a crisis in which oil supplies were interrupted and
prices rose quickly was predictable, so the oil companies
should have prepared their dealer network to deal with it.</p>
<p>"They should have had illustrations available on how the
whole domino effect takes place, and posters and handouts
available for dealers," says Mr. Fullmer of Selz Seabolt. "If
they were done ahead of time, they could have been printed
within a day or two."</p>
<p>Mary Woodell, a crisis management director at consultants
Arthur D. Little Inc., agrees. "It's the dealer or retailer
who takes the heat. I would advise them to give dealers as
much advance notice as possible, a short statement of
purpose, of why we are doing this, so that they have
something to say to the people who go to the gas tank."
Otherwise, she says, "the retailer can be left flat-footed
and bearing the brunt of the blame."</p>
<p>Mobil Corp. says such materials for dealers are "in the
pipeline."</p>
<p>Others suggest that oil companies should have tried harder
to align themselves with the American public against a
common, outside, enemy. Otherwise, says Ian Mitroff, director
of the Center for Crisis Management at the University of
Southern California's business school, the blame falls on the
oil companies by default: "When you can't do much about an
external threat, you have to project and put that threat
somewhere. That's Freud 101. The anger has to go somewhere,
especially when you feel impotent."</p>
<p>Herbert Schmertz, a former senior public affairs official
with Mobil Corp., now heads a private consulting company
bearing his name. He believes that oil companies should have
quickly seized the initiative to try to affect U.S. energy
policy: "There is a need to explain to the American public
{that} by misguided governmental policies we have put
ourselves in a position where we are dependent both
politically and economically on imported oil. They should be
making that case to the American public," he says, adding, "I
don't see any sign of it."</p>
<p>Mr. Schmertz, long an advocate of lobbying aggressively
directly to the public, recommends a combination of paid
advertising and sending oil company executives out to speak.</p>
