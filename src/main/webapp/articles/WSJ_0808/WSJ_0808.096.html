   Passing the Buck
   On a Colossal Scale</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">If the White House is seriously contemplating responding
to the S&L scandal by slashing federal deposit insurance
coverage from $100,000 to $50,000 (page one, July 3), then
the scheme represents one of the most colossal pass-the-buck
scenarios ever devised.
   Such an "overhaul," as the Journal generously refers to
it, smacks of an effort by the Bush administration to assess
blame for the $500 billion crisis on depositors in the failed
banks -- when, of course, it was the bankers who mismanaged
their funds and the federal regulators who blithely turned a
blind eye as if nothing untoward was happening, until it was
too late.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>If Washington is serious about creating an atmosphere
under which this kind of scandal can never reoccur, it will
turn away from scapegoating depositors and instead create a
system of oversight that compels stricter compliance with the
rules that remain on the books.</p>
<p>For example, when the Feds deregulated the banks they also
cut back on their staffs of examiners. But prudent
deregulation does not call for the total withdrawal of
oversight. Quite the opposite. This was a terrible mistake,
and to correct it the regulatory staffs ought to be beefed up
immediately. Washington should also create a new, separate,
independent entity -- apart from the bank regulators and
accountable directly to the White House -- to manage and
liquidate the S&Ls' real-estate assets for the best value
possible. Such an entity ought, moreover, to have
private-sector involvement, as well as a strong presence in
each region of the country, since local real-estate dealings
require local expertise.</p>
<p>Finally, the Feds ought to be thinking not about weakening
safeguards for depositors but about overhauling the way they
regulate banks in the first place. Replace the potpourri of
existing regulatory agencies with a sole, centralized
regulator, armed with a strong enforcement staff, and
responsible for total oversight over the banking system at
the federal level.</p>
<p>There is one reform we can institute where deposit
insurance is concerned, as New York Gov. Mario Cuomo has
already proposed: limit insurance to $100,000 per depositor,
instead of $100,000 per deposit, so the so-called
"sharpshooters" can't buy extra protection with extra
accounts.</p>

<p>I'd like to suggest the possibility of enabling
legislation to cause federal deposit insurance to compete
with insurance provided to banks by the insurance and
financial communities, similar to the manner in which
workers' compensation insurance systems work.</p>
<p>Over time, this should provide incentives to the financial
system to be self-policing in regard to risks. I would expect
under such a system that the risks associated with banking
activities eventually would be reflected in the interest
costs to borrowers. This is certainly fairer than creating
high tax rates for taxpayers who may or may not be
participants in the credit system that created the problem.
In addition, those taxpayers who are also savers would be
rewarded with higher returns on their savings rather than
higher taxes on their earnings.</p>
