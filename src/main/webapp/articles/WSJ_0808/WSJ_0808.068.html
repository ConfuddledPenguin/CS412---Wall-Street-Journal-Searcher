	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- What do the copper industry, the American
Council of the Blind and jukebox owners have in common?
   Not a whole lot, actually, says James C. Benfield. But
that's the point. The 46-year-old lobbyist has discovered
that one of the best ways to win legislative battles in
Washington is to enlist many otherwise unrelated foot
soldiers in a common fight. Mr. Benfield is currently the
executive director of the Coin Coalition, a collection of 23
trade associations pushing for the replacement of the dollar
bill with a gold-colored dollar coin.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Legislation pending in both the House and the Senate calls
for the creation of a dollar coin that would be at least 90%
copper in content. The coin would be distinguishable by feel
to help the blind, and it would effectively eliminate the
need for jukebox owners to install costly dollar-bill
changers adjacent to their juke boxes. Accordingly, Mr.
Benfield has recruited into the coalition's ranks two
copper-industry trade associations, three blind-advocacy
groups and two associations of owners and manufacturers of
coin-operated amusement games.</p>
<p>Mr. Benfield spends much of his day compiling information
on: the experiences of countries that have undergone
successful bill-to-coin conversions, the purchasing power of
a dollar bill 30 years ago compared with today, the number of
bills an average American carries in his wallet.</p>
<p>He also acts as the coalition's "traffic cop," directing
the efforts of vending-machine manufacturers, who fly into
Washington to lobby their congressmen, and vending-machine
owners, who visit their elected representatives when the
lawmakers are back home. "The way you move the process is by
getting constituents to do the talking," says Mr. Benfield,
who does very little work on the Hill himself. His coalition
rarely meets. Washington tends to be "all meetings, no
action," Mr. Benfield says. Instead, he writes countless
memos and directives to the various members, and spends much
time on the phone.</p>
<p>Several years ago, Mr. Benfield employed similar tactics
in his successful push for an extension of daylight time.
Something like that was tried as an energy-conservation
measure by the Nixon administration but was soon abandoned
because of a lack of public enthusiasm. Under the banner of
the Daylight Savings Time Coalition, Mr. Benfield spearheaded
17 companies and trade associations ranging from the Amateur
Softball Association (more daylight, more playing time) to
Kingsford Co., the charcoal maker (more daylight, more
barbecues). A monthlong extension of daylight time went into
effect in April 1989. Several industries gained from the
measure, and no one was hurt, Mr. Benfield says.</p>
<p>As for his current reform effort with the dollar, the
deficit-plagued U.S. government could be the greatest
beneficiary. A recent study by the General Accounting Office
concludes that replacing the dollar bill with a dollar coin
would save the government an average of $318 million a year
over the next 30 years, after start-up costs.</p>
<p>A dollar bill costs 2.6 cents to produce and remains in
circulation about 17 months before it becomes so worn that it
must be withdrawn, shredded and replaced. A dollar coin,
while more costly to produce (about 6 cents), would last 30
years -- 20 times longer than the dollar bill, the GAO
estimates. Production savings: $41.4 million per year.</p>
<p>But the lower production cost represents just part of the
savings potential. The difference between the face value of a
minted coin and its production cost go on the Treasury
Department books as an asset. In the case of a dollar coin,
this difference, called seigniorage, would be 94 cents per
coin minted. Interest earned on seigniorage reduces the
amount of money the government must borrow to finance the
federal deficit.</p>
<p>The government benefits in a similar way from printing
dollar bills. But an efficient conversion to dollar coins
would require replacing each circulating dollar bill with two
circulating dollar coins, the GAO estimates. Vending
machines, the GAO says, would need large inventories of
dollar coins for making change. Thus, the switch from dollar
bills to twice as many dollar coins would save the government
$284 million a year in interest payments, the GAO concludes.</p>
<p>Rep. Jim Kolbe (R., Ariz.) shares Mr. Benfield's vision.
Mr. Kolbe's bill calling for the replacement of the dollar
note with a dollar coin has attracted more than 130
co-sponsors in the House and is scheduled for more hearings
after the August recess. Rowdy Yeates, an aide to Mr. Kolbe,
says his office's relationship with Mr. Benfield's coalition
has provided a "model for cooperation" between a lawmaker and
a lobbying group. Mr. Benfield and Mr. Yeates talk several
times a week, share files of information and plot strategy
together. Mr. Kolbe says he considers Mr. Benfield a master
of "bottom-up, grass-roots politics."</p>
<p>A similar measure in the Senate, introduced by Pete
Domenici (R., N.M.), calls for the introduction of a dollar
coin but would leave the dollar bill in circulation, allowing
consumers a choice in currency. But doing so, say Mr.
Benfield, the GAO and officials in the U.S. Mint, would
undoubtedly cause a second Susan B. Anthony fiasco. In 1979,
the Carter administration minted 800 million Anthony dollars;
more than 425 million currently sit in vaults in the Treasury
Department and Federal Reserve. "We don't want to get caught
with another disaster on our hands," explains a Mint
spokesman.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Mint doesn't want anything to do with another
dollar-coin attempt, whether the dollar bill is withdrawn or
not. Donna Pope, director of the U.S. Mint, argues that there
is no compelling reason to believe Americans want a dollar
coin. An April Gallup poll supports her case. Only 15% of
those surveyed said they would favor replacing the dollar
bill with a dollar coin. "Machines like coins; people like
bills," Ms. Pope says.</p>
<p>The director of the Mint credits Mr. Benfield with being
"very intense and very determined." She says he has done a
good job of "developing arguments that support his point of
view." But, she is quick to add, the Mint must react to the
demands of the general public, not the outcries of a
"vociferous group."</p>
<p>Getting Americans excited about changing a currency system
that they take for granted presents a challenge. Bruce
Wright, associate director of the Coin Coalition, concedes,
"On initial blush, {the dollar coin} sounds like a sort of
silly idea." Thus, Mr. Benfield has been appearing on radio
talk shows across the country and patiently waiting for the
press to ask for his side of the story.</p>
<p>Patience is one of Mr. Benfield's greatest strengths,
coalition members say. Four years ago, Rick Currie, president
of Coin Control, a small company that manufactures
vending-machine parts, traveled to Washington to hear Mr.
Benfield's pitch. The lobbyist mapped out what Mr. Currie
considered a frustratingly long road to dollar-coin
legislation. "There were no shortcuts involved," Mr. Currie
recalls. But Mr. Benfield's realism sold the Coin Coalition
to Mr. Currie and his fellow members of the American
Amusement Machine Association, which is now one of the
coalition's strongest financial backers.</p>
