	<p class="article-leader">TRADING RUBLES</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Soviet government announced a plan to allow some
businesses and organizations to trade rubles for foreign
currency at market rates.</p>
<p>The action, a step toward the ruble's convertibility,
would establish currency markets in the Soviet Union
beginning Jan. 1, 1991, the official Tass news agency said.
Tass said the Soviet Council of Ministers made the decision
on Saturday.</p>
<p>Legal enterprises and organizations, but apparently not
individuals, would be permitted to buy and sell foreign
currency in exchange for rubles at rates established by
banks, currency auctions and other operations, Tass said. The
report didn't say what the other operations would be or what
other limits and controls would be placed on such markets.</p>
<p>Tass said the decision to set up a currency market was
prompted by preparations for the Soviet Union's transition to
a regulated market economy.</p>
<p>CHINA-INDONESIA AGREEMENT</p>
<p>Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng met Indonesian President
Suharto in Jakarta yesterday and promised not to use ethnic
Chinese in Indonesia to serve Beijing's own purposes. Mr. Li
was in Indonesia to sign an agreement to resume diplomatic
relations between the two countries. Relations were suspended
after Indonesia accused Beijing of supporting an attempted
coup by Communist rebels in 1965.</p>
<p>BANANA WORKERS BACK ON JOB</p>
<p>In Honduras, thousands of banana workers returned to their
jobs after ending a strike that began June 25 against
Chiquita Brands International Inc. The strike caused an
estimated $60 million in losses to the Honduran economy.
Threatened with dismissal after the government sent in troops
to end the strike, the workers accepted a 25% pay raise; they
had earlier demanded more than 50%.</p>
<p>MATSUSHITA-IBM AGREEMENT</p>
<p>Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.'s Taiwan
personal-computer subsidiary will make PCs for International
Business Machines Corp. after the subsidiary starts
operations this October, a Matsushita spokesman said. The
Japanese company's spokesman said the agreement to make
32-bit PCs for IBM on an original-equipment-manufacturing
basis represents a further strengthening of the relationship
between the two companies. Matsushita already manufactures
IBM's PC2 at the company's facilities in Illinois.</p>
<p>JAPANESE IMPORT PANEL</p>
<p>Japan will set up a 30-member Import Board to help slash
its trade surplus. Establishment of the panel, comprising
government officials, Japanese businessmen and foreign
business executives, was approved by the Trade Conference,
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said. The
conference is chaired by Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and
includes cabinet members and Japanese business leaders. The
new board will meet twice a year, beginning this fall.</p>
<p>WARSAW NEAR BANKRUPTCY</p>
<p>Warsaw is almost out of money because Poland's
economic-reform program has left thousands of businesses
facing bankruptcy and unable to make tax payments, the city
government reported.</p>
<p>Both large enterprises and small factories have had
trouble meeting their obligations, causing a dramatic drop in
revenues collected by the Warsaw government, the Polish media
reported. In the province of Warsaw, which includes the city
and surrounding villages, local governments have paid only 3%
of their annual dues to the provincial government, the Zycie
Warszawy newspaper said.</p>
<p>The local governments owe 481 billion zlotys ($50.6
million) -- money they are unable to raise because they
managed to collect only 40% of the taxes owed to the village
administrations, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>"The {Warsaw} province is on the edge of bankruptcy," a
provincial official said, adding that a precise budget review
would be completed this month.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>With most of Europe in the grips of a drought, water
restrictions are widespread. Yesterday, a woman caught
watering her garden in southwest France was fined $250. In
Britain, drought orders are in force in 26 districts, and
those who disobey can be fined up to $750. . . .
Switzerland's Federal Court agreed with retiree Andre Cornu
that cowbells worn by neighboring farmers' herds can be a
form of noise pollution. Mr. Cornu said the court ruled that
bells must come off all cows right next to his property "and
bronze bells must not be used at all."</p>
