	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- President Bush was in the middle of a visit
to Central Intelligence Agency headquarters yesterday when
something occurred to him. Breaking off from the meeting, Mr.
Bush went to the telephone -- and called Canadian Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney, with whom he had dined the night
before. After a several-minute talk about the Persian Gulf
crisis, the president hung up and rejoined the CIA group.
   George Bush is handling the gravest crisis of his
presidency exactly the way he has handled foreign policy
since his first day in office: through his carefully
cultivated personal ties with foreign leaders and the advice
of a tight circle of trusted aides.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That approach seems to be bearing fruit in the unusually
united world response to Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein's
invasion and takeover of Kuwait. While Mr. Bush can't take
all the credit for the broad-based denunciation of Iraq, some
analysts say the results -- from the Soviet Union's decision
to turn back arms shipments to Iraq to Japan's willingness to
participate in an oil embargo and China's decision to stop
arms sales -- stem at least in part from the relationship Mr.
Bush has forged with their leaders.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush knows the Saudis' Washington ambassador, Prince
Bandar bin Sultan, well and has visited Saudi King Fahd in
his kingdom. That may have helped persuade the Saudis to
decide for the first time to accept a large American force in
their country.</p>
<p>"The whole country is seeing now the benefits of his
establishing these relationships with our allies," says
Republican pollster Robert Teeter, a close associate of Mr.
Bush.</p>
<p>Within the administration, Mr. Bush has leaned heavily on
national security adviser Brent Scowcroft and on Secretary of
State James Baker and Defense Secretary Richard Cheney, both
of whom he has dispatched on sensitive foreign missions. Also
influential is Gen. Colin Powell, the chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, who also brings the expertise he gained as
national security adviser under President Reagan.</p>
<p>Observers say the president is following his general mode
of operation in such matters, taking information from many
but advice from few. "His is not a practice of exclusion,
it's one of inclusion," says Peter Teeley, a former longtime
aide. "He'll bring in these individuals who have expertise in
the areas he needs," regardless of whether they are
high-ranking officials. Among other things, the president
yesterday met with a group of prominent Arab-Americans to
hear whatever information they might have about the
tension-filled region.</p>
<p>When a decision is required, though, Mr. Bush reverts to
his inner circle in a search for consensus. If there has been
any sharp disagreement so far, the group has managed to keep
it to themselves -- though Gen. Powell was reported to be
more insistent than others in the group that a blockade of
Iraqi oil required an agreement with Saudi Arabia to allow
U.S. military forces there.</p>
<p>As a former CIA director himself, Mr. Bush has kept in
close touch with his old agency during the crisis. CIA
Director William Webster, though not in the policy-making
inner circle, has been a frequent conduit for information.
Although there has been frequent speculation that Mr. Webster
would be replaced at the CIA, his performance in the current
crisis could boost his prospects for remaining at least
through the end of Mr. Bush's current term; in any event,
Bush aides say the president has been particularly pleased
with the quality of the intelligence he has been receiving.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush's visit yesterday to CIA headquarters was for a
long-scheduled meeting with the intelligence officers who
prepare his daily briefing; it turned into a discussion of
the unfolding events in Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Since the crisis began, the White House says, Mr. Bush has
talked personally no fewer than 20 times with the leaders of
at least a dozen nations, from Italy to Yemen. In the 24
hours between Monday night and last night alone, aides say,
he spoke on the telephone not only with Mr. Mulroney but also
with King Hassan of Morocco, Yemen's President Ali Abdallah
Salih, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and French President
Francois Mitterrand.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush also has seized some unexpected opportunities to
build international backing. By chance, British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher was in the U.S. when the Iraqi
invasion occurred; Mr. Bush, who had already met with her in
Aspen, Colo., during her trip, invited her to stop at the
White House on the way home. There, she met with Mr. Bush and
with Manfred Woerner, secretary general of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization, and issued a strong statement of support
for the president.</p>
<p>Similarly, Mr. Bush turned a planned trip to South America
by Vice President Dan Quayle into an opportunity to lobby for
support in the Persian Gulf. In preparation for Mr. Quayle's
trip to Bogota for the inauguration of the new president of
Colombia, the president and vice president met for lunch
Monday and discussed specific messages for Mr. Quayle to
carry to other heads of state. Brazil, for instance, has been
a supplier of arms to Iraq and a customer of Iraqi oil;
Venezuela is being called upon to increase its oil output to
help offset the embargoed Iraqi and Kuwaiti supplies.</p>
<p>David Silverstein, a defense-policy analyst with the
conservative Heritage Foundation, says the president's style
of personal diplomacy is all the more important now because
of changes in the world order that have taken place. "This is
a post-Cold War world and the U.S., while it is a benevolent
leader, is a leader in a world of equal nations," he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Silverstein believes "a convergence of self-interests"
is mostly behind the world's surprisingly unified response to
the Iraqi crisis. But, he says, President Bush's personal
diplomacy "has made it easier for all sides to come
together."</p>
