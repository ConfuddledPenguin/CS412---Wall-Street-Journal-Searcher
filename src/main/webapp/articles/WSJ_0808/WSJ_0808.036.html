	<p class="article-leader">MELBOURNE, Fla. -- Harris Corp. said that it expects
earnings for the first half of the current fiscal year to be
"relatively flat" compared with last year's first half.
   John T. Hartley, chairman and chief executive of the
information and communications concern, said, "We're
operating in a difficult economic environment that shows no
signs of early improvement." In addition, he said earnings in
the semiconductor sector are expected to be lower in the
first half of the year due to manufacturing consolidations
and the discontinuance of nonstrategic product lines.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>However, Mr. Hartley added, "Assuming no further
deterioriation in the economic environment in which we
operate, we expect good earnings growth in the second half of
the year, resulting in a solid increase for the year as a
whole."</p>
<p>Harris reported net income for the fourth quarter ended
June 30 rose 14%, to $39.5 million, or 99 cents a share,
compared with profit from continuing operations of $34.8
million, or 90 cents a share. For the year-ago fourth
quarter, an $86.8 million loss from discontinued operations
resulted in a net loss of $52 million, or $1.34 a share. The
company said revenue rose 5%, to $819.4 million in the latest
fourth quarter, compared with revenue from continuing
operations of $778 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>Harris also said its board approved the repurchase of as
many as 1.5 million of its common shares in the open market.
It said the shares will be used for general corporate
purposes. Harris has 39.6 million common shares outstanding.</p>
