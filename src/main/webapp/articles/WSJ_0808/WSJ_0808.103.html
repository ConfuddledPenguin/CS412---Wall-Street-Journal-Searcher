	<p class="article-leader">Replacement cost. Now, again: REPLACEMENT COST. Repeat
after me: r-e-p-l-a-c-e-m-e-n-t cost.
   This summarizes the clearest lesson we learned from the
energy crisis of the 1970s. It's too bad so many people slept
through that decade.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Senator Joseph Lieberman skipped the 1970s, and yesterday
paraded his ignorance: "In the last week, American consumers
have been ripped off on a massive scale." Rep. Phil Sharp
also missed the last energy crisis, to judge by his comment
that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein "may not be the only
greedy person in this picture." Even the White House
evidently was on vacation last time around, or it wouldn't
set out poor Marlin Fitzwater to say: "It is not clear that
all of the increases that have been reported at the consumer
level are necessary." The common theme is that the gasoline
price went up at retail before the new, higher-priced crude
oil could flow through the pipelines.</p>
<p>To take replacement cost from the ground up, suppose
you're Sam Sanchez, proprietor of Last Stand Gas at Custer
and Santa Anna in Heartland, Texas. You read that the price
of crude oil just jumped from $14 to $21, and are trying to
figure out what retail price is "necessary" if you're going
to stay in business. You have half a tank truck of gas you
bought at wholesale at 66 a gallon, and if you continue to
sell at 99.9 cents, your bookkeeper will tell you that you
made your usual markup to cover the attendants' salaries, the
bank loan and your kid's sneakers.</p>
<p>As a striving entrepreneur, however, you know that when
the tank truck arrives on Tuesday, you're going to have to
shell out 99 cents a gallon at wholesale. And as someone who
has to buy sneakers, you wonder where this extra money will
come from. The bank's been asking a lot of questions lately,
and you're not sure it'll cough up a new loan for working
capital. So you go out to the pumps and slap on a $1.29
price, enough to afford your next truckload of gas at the new
price -- enough, that is, to replace the gas you're selling.</p>
<p>The bookkeeper says you've doubled the profit on the gas
still in the tank. Economists call this historical cost.
Gas-station operators call it going out of business; the
station operators who care about staying in business will
price according to replacement costs. So will the
wholesalers, independents and Octopus Oil. The natural result
is that an increase in the price of oil will be reflected
immediately at retail.</p>
<p>It's possible, of course, that someone may try to boost
the retail price even above replacement cost. But if Sam
Sanchez's big competitor puts on a $1.99 a gallon price, Sam
won't go above $1.95, somebody else will come in at $1.90 and
pretty soon we're all back to $1.29, without any intervention
from Congress. Edwin Rothschild of the consumer group Citizen
Action called for a boycott of the highest-priced gas
stations in each community -- advice your average consumer is
likely to find, well, superfluous.</p>
<p>It's pointless, then, for Congress and its sisters and
cousins and aunts to run around the country with dipsticks
trying to measure how much cheap gas everyone had in tanks
and pipelines when the price went up. We've been through all
of this once, and by now ought to understand that what counts
is replacement cost. We ought also to understand that the
effect of hysteria and demagogy can only be legislation or
other efforts to keep the price below the market-clearing
point, discouraging conservation, capping new supplies,
causing queuing at stations, and otherwise shooting ourselves
in the foot for the benefit of Saddam Hussein.</p>
