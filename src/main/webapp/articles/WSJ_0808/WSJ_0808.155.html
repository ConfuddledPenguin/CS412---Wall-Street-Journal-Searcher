	<p class="article-leader">Washington, D.C. -- During the '50s and '60s, Nicolas de
Stael (1914-1955) was widely considered one of the greatest
postwar painters. I well remember the enthusiasm that I, and
virtually every artist I knew, had for his work in the '60s,
and how strong his influence on younger artists was then. At
a time when existentialism was all the rage, both the man and
his art seemed to have the essential ingredients of
greatness.
   Born to an aristocratic Russian family on the eve of the
revolution, de Stael lived a life of displacement and
tragedy, and his struggles and conflicts later took on a
romantic aura. His family was forced to flee to Poland when
he was five, and both his parents died a few years later.
Educated in Belgium, he suffered great solitude, wandered
widely before he settled in France, and even spent the better
part of a year in the Foreign Legion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>De Stael was a tall, moody, Angst-filled man who painted
with great energy and dramatic flourish. Around 1949 he
developed his characteristic technique of applying broad,
thick swaths of paint with a palette knife, and after 1950 he
enjoyed considerable fame and fortune. During the last few
years of his life, he also struggled with one of the most
pressing artistic issues of the day: whether or not to paint
abstractly. From 1952 on, he repeatedly challenged
conventional distinctions by going back and forth over the
treacherous border between abstraction and figuration. When
he committed suicide by jumping from the terrace of his
studio at Antibes on the French Riviera, he seemed like a
modern Icarus, destroyed in the obsessive pursuit of his
high-flying artistic aspirations.</p>
<p>Before long, a shadow fell over de Stael's reputation.
Once avidly sought by collectors and lavishly praised by
critics, his work has not been given an American museum show
in the past 25 years. And so the current retrospective
exhibition at the Phillips Collection provides a particularly
welcome opportunity to re-evaluate his accomplishment. It
contains 91 works, drawn entirely from North American
collections, and ranges over the artist's entire mature
output, starting with a small abstraction painted in 1943 and
ending with a view of Antibes painted from his window in
1955. More than a third of the show's entries are
little-known drawings and collages.</p>
<p>De Stael owed and continues to owe his place in the world
to the paintings he did after 1950. In abstract canvases like
"Nocturne" (1950), he evokes both a state of mind and a time
of day through muted color and melancholy formal rhythms. The
paintings of this period are characterized by rich surfaces,
extensive use of grays, and by slab-like, nearly geometric
compositional structures. Taken one at a time, they are
lyrical and quite lovely. But seen together, their
repetitious colors and unimaginative compositional formats
have a numbing effect.</p>
<p>The paintings that work the indefinite area between
abstraction and figuration are even more problematical. The
1952 landscapes are so stylized as to seem more decorative
and elegant than emotionally moving. And to my surprise, the
contemporaneous semi-abstract pictures of football players
and vases of flowers seem to have some of the slick elegance
of magazine illustrations.</p>
<p>This is not to say, however, that he didn't produce some
stunning and impressive pictures. In the majestic "Sicilian
Landscape" (1954), shrill colors play against a menacing
black sky with relentless tension. An ethereal beauty
emanates from exquisitely poised pictures like "Nice" (1954),
and from some of the small Mediterranean seascapes. Even in
his weaker pictures, de Stael manages to evoke an impressive
sense of light.</p>
<p>In the works that mix flat, painterly abstraction with
highly stylized representational subject matter, de Stael is
working in a vital modernist tradition that takes the
physical world as the subject for art, but that does so
indirectly and metaphorically rather than directly and
literally. What bothers me about many of de Stael's paintings
in this mode is that they seem self-consciously clever and
virtuosic. Their composition and drawing tend to be
uninventive; their color harmonies and trowel-like
application of paint are too predictable.</p>
<p>In some cases, as in "White Flowers in a Black Vase"
(1953), the contrast between the vigorous, bravura paint
application and the banal prettiness of the image is quite
troubling. The same embarrassing banality undermines the
well-known "Musicians" (1953), where there is a lack of
underlying synthesis between the abstract rhythmic patterning
that evokes the musicians and the literalness of their poses.</p>
<p>As I walked through this show, I found myself wondering
how de Stael's art had had such a different effect on me in
the '60s. I don't think my taste has changed so much as the
historical perspective one inevitably brings to de Stael
today. Twenty-five years ago, his work seemed very original
and authentic; now it seems considerably less so. His
influences -- especially Braque and the late Matisse -- now
seem more evident (and more imperfectly mastered) and his
means of expression appear more self-conscious.</p>
<p>This is particularly apparent in the drawings and
collages, which are generally much weaker than the paintings.
The best drawings are the small pure line drawings done
directly from nature -- although even these look derivative.
But in the more elaborate drawings, such as the large and
grandiloquent charcoals done in 1954-55, de Stael seems to
get bogged down in superfluous posturing. It is as if he
became trapped in his own myth. And it is a myth that
unfortunately does not seem to be withstanding the test of
time very well.</p>
<p>The exhibition will be on view through Sept. 9. It will
then move to the Cincinnati Museum of Art, from Oct. 16
through Dec. 31.</p>
