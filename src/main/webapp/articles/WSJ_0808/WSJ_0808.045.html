	<p class="article-leader">EMERYVILLE, Calif. -- Cetus Corp., hindered by
expenditures related to the development of interleukin-2, or
IL-2, said its fourth-quarter net loss widened to $16.5
million from $14.3 million a year earlier.
   Cetus cited increased marketing and manufacturing costs
associated with IL-2 as well as a significant decrease in net
interest income. Revenue for the quarter ended June 30 rose
75% to $19.4 million, from $10 million, reflecting higher
research and development revenue, product sales and
royalties.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the year, the net loss of $61.5 million, or $2.15 a
share, widened to $50 million, or $1.86 a share, from fiscal
1989. The fourth-quarter loss for each period was equal to 53
cents a share, reflecting an increase in common shares
outstanding.</p>
<p>Last week, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory
panel postponed recommendation of the drug for sale on the
U.S. market as a treatment for advanced kidney cancer pending
further research. Concern over the outlook for IL-2 has
caused Cetus stock to drop more than 40% in the past two
weeks. Yesterday, in national over-the-counter trading, the
stock closed at $9.25, down 25 cents.</p>
<p>Analysts say the company will continue to post losses
until it can market IL-2 in the U.S. The company has spent
$120 million to research, develop and launch the drug on the
European market.</p>
<p>In a statement, the company said it planned to make
spending adjustments to reflect the delay as soon as the
extent of the delay is determined.</p>
