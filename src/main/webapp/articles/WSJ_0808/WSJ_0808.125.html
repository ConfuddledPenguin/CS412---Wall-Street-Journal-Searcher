	<p class="article-leader">Harley-Davidson Inc. said it adopted a revised shareholder
rights plan to thwart any hostile takeover attempts.
   However, the Milwaukee motorcycle maker said it isn't
aware of any efforts currently to gain control of the
company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the plan, shareholders of record Aug. 20 will
receive, for every common share they hold, a right to buy
one-hundredth of a newly issued share of preferred stock at
an exercise price of $100. The rights would be exercisable if
a bidder acquires 15% or more of the company's common stock
-- or announces a tender offer for at least 25%.</p>
<p>If Harley-Davidson is taken over, each right will entitle
the holder to buy shares in the acquiring company's common
stock with a market value of twice that of the right's
exercise price.</p>
<p>In addition, if a bidder purchases a 15% stake in the
motorcycle concern, each right holder (other than the
acquirer) can receive preferred shares in Harley-Davidson
with a market value equal to twice that of the exercise
price. The company's previous rights plan required that a
bidder acquire at least 25% of its shares before the rights
were triggered.</p>
