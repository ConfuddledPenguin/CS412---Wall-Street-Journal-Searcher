	<p class="article-leader">"I hope you didn't ---- us too much," Janis Joplin is
supposed to have said upon meeting the man who drew up her
first record contract for CBS Records. Here, quite clearly,
was a woman who understood the nature of the recording
industry in America. Not that it seemed to bother her: Upon
signing the contract, she offered to sleep with the CBS
Records head Clive Davis to celebrate the deal.
   Fredric Dannen, a contributing editor of Vanity Fair, is
not nearly so forgiving as the late Ms. Joplin. He intends,
with "Hit Men: Power Brokers and Fast Money Inside the Music
Business" (Times Books, 387 pages, $19.95) to expose the
industry in all its lurid corruption, to lay bare its
mismanagement and flush out its seedy characters, to point
out its conflicts of interest and raise an accusatory finger
at the exploitation that is at its core. As Mr. Dannen
describes it, the typical transaction in the music business
goes like this: If the recording artist is a small fry, then
the record company tries to ensure that he is taken to the
cleaners in the contract. If the recording artist is a big
shot, he tends to insist on a contract that will almost
surely cost the record company money.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Hit Men" tells two different, if mildly interconnected,
stories. The first, and weakest, is an expose of a racket
called "independent promotion," in which a few men with ties
to radio stations were paid fees by the record companies to
ensure that songs got airplay. These men become so powerful
they were called "The Network," and by the mid-80s, they
commanded huge sums; Mr. Dannen estimates that companies were
spending a total of $60 million to $80 million on independent
promotion. There is not much doubt those thugs could keep
records off the air. That they had mob ties seems
irrefutable; that they were involved in payola (some of it in
the form of cocaine) has since been proved in several
criminal cases.</p>
<p>That's one of Mr. Dannen's problems: Rather than exposing
The Network, he has done not much more than rehash the work
of others, most notably Brian Ross of NBC News, who
originally broke the independent-promotion scandal back in
1986. Another problem is that the context for this scandal is
largely missing. We get no sense, for instance, of whether
Top 40 radio -- the bread and butter of the independent
promoters -- still matters in the age of MTV. Nor does Mr.
Dannen's reasoning always make sense: He claims at one point
that The Network had become so expensive that only CBS
Records could afford it. Yet if The Network is as powerful as
he says it is, you have to wonder how anyone else got any
records on the air. Mr. Dannen does, however, have a nice
feel for the ironies involved; he is amused at the way the
record companies were shocked -- shocked] -- when the payola
practices of the independent promoters were exposed in the
press; and, as he points out, in the end the industry used
the exposes and prosecutions not so much to get rid of
independent promotion as to shift its cost from themselves to
the recording artists.</p>
<p>Mr. Dannen's second purpose is to bring to life the men
who run the record industry, in all their unpleasantness and
egomania, and here he largely accomplishes his purpose. You
simply cannot read his descriptions of people such as David
Geffen of Geffen Records, Irving Azoff of MCA Records, and
most of all, Walter Yetnikoff, the head of CBS Records,
without thinking ill of them. Mr. Yetnikoff, who is the
central character in the book, comes across in "Hit Men" as
the most overrated executive this side of James Robinson. His
shtick, apparently, is to yell at people in the foulest ways
imaginable; a typical Yetnikoff sentence can't be repeated in
this newspaper. When he first became head of CBS Records in
the early 1980s, he decided to wage open war against
archrival Warner Bros.; among other tactics, he had a huge
obscene anti-Warner flag made. His management "skills" were
such that by the end of the decade, the once-dominant CBS
held only 16% of the market, while Warner Bros. had risen to
40%. He openly mocked his superiors at CBS, including CBS
President Laurence Tisch, whose sin, in Mr. Yetnikoff's eyes,
was not giving in to every Yetnikoff demand. Mr. Dannen even
makes a persuasive case that Mr. Yetnikoff liked the
independent-promotion system, slimy though it was, because it
provided a prohibitively expensive barrier to small record
companies.</p>
<p>Cement contractors who do this sort of thing can find
themselves in a lot of trouble but, as we all know, it didn't
work out too badly for Mr. Yetnikoff. His open harassment of
Mr. Tisch played at least a small role in CBS's selling its
record division to Sony (for a wildly inflated $2 billion),
and then Mr. Yetnikoff helped persuade Sony to overpay again,
this time to land Yetnikoff buddies Jon Peters and Peter
Guber to run Columbia Pictures, Sony's new movie division.
And of course, for his role in helping snooker his new
employer, Sony made Mr. Yetnikoff a very rich man. Despite
his lackluster performance, he remains, as he likes to say of
himself, "probably the most powerful record executive." As
somebody didn't say, there's no business like the record
business.</p>
