	<p class="article-leader">As the entire world knows, the Soviet Union now has
perestroika, democracy, and, of course, the world's most
popular political leader, who started it all -- Mikhail
Gorbachev. About the reforms he launched five years ago,
there can be no disagreement. It is an indisputable fact that
before we lived in one kind of society, and now we are trying
to create another. Only one question remains: Are we creating
a democracy, or is it something else?
   The whole world believes it is a democracy. And indeed, we
have chosen a Parliament, and all sorts of people are arguing
there, expressing a wide variety of opinions, voting on
various proposals, passing resolutions by a majority of
votes.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But we should ask ourselves a question. How was this
majority formed? It is well known that during the 1989
elections to the Congress of People's Deputies, the winning
candidates in some districts ran unopposed. It is also well
known that one-third of the deputies were chosen by the
executive bodies of public organizations. Finally, in 1989
there were special pre-election meetings where a few hundred
people, chosen in a rather arbitrary way and certainly not
representing the opinions of all the voters in the district,
decided which candidates should stay on the list and which
should be stricken from it.</p>
<p>In many districts where there were two or more candidates,
they all represented one platform, that of the Communist
Party. In other words, the only choice available was between
personalities, not ideas. Even in districts where there was a
competition of ideas, the candidates who followed the Central
Committee line enjoyed enormous advantages. Such "correct"
candidates were supplied with brigades of campaigners and
copying machines, and were given access to the press.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, the debates between the minority
and the majority at the sessions of the Congress of People's
Deputies and the Supreme Soviet are not in the same category
as the traditional debates in Western parliamentary systems
between a democratically elected majority and a
democratically elected minority. It would be more accurate,
in the Soviet case, to speak of debates between an
undemocratically elected majority and a democratically
elected minority.</p>
<p>The gap between the people and its allegedly democratic
Parliament leads to difficult social conflicts, growing
tensions and, as we say these days, to the rocking of an
already unstable boat. Popular discontent with the content
and pace of decisions by the country's legislative body is
expressed through rallies, demonstrations, and strikes -- not
to mention hunger strikes, unauthorized takeovers of
government officials' summer homes, and other excesses.</p>
<p>All these actions, of course, are criticized by the
authorities. The strikes, we are told, undermine the economy,
while rallies distract people from their jobs. Both claims
are partially true, though rallies and strikes are often the
only way the people have to force their "chosen"
representatives to speed up economic and political reforms.
And the delay of such reforms does much more harm to the
economy than any strikes ever could.</p>
<p>As a result of the dissatisfaction of the majority of the
population with the current situation, a broad-based
democratic movement has emerged. In practice, the democratic
movement consists of a multitude of more or less organized
structural components, such as popular fronts, voter's
associations, and various cultural and educational societies.
These organizations have begun forming umbrella groups called
civic action committees.</p>
<p>The development of structures of a broad-based democratic
movement and the involvement of these structures in the
electoral process make it quite probable that mid-level and
lower-level elected bodies will more or less accurately
reflect the interests of the people -- that is, will be truly
democratic. The 1990 elections have offered good
opportunities. The elections in the Baltic republics were
harbingers of democracy. There, the republics' popular fronts
won by landslides. The results of the municipal elections in
Moscow as a whole have also been positive, with democratic
forces winning an absolute majority. There, Gavriil Popov was
elected chairman of the Moscow City Council, and I was chosen
chairman of the Oktyabrsky District Council. Thus, in parts
of the country there is a realistic prospect of bringing
government under democratic control.</p>
<p>The existence of jurisdictions where democrats control
local government can boost the democratic process throughout
the Soviet Union. They can be an inspiration to other
regions; moreover, democratic local councils can actively
support popular movements and assist the work of civic action
committees in neighboring nondemocratic regions.</p>
<p>The increase in the number of pro-democracy jurisdictions
inevitably will step up the pressure on the upper echelons of
power. This pressure must be brought to bear not only through
strikes, rallies and demonstrations, but also through the
actions of local councils in various regions. By adopting
resolutions and pressing the central legislature, local
bodies can further the cause of democratic reform. In this
way, I hope my country can navigate through narrow and
dangerous straits to early elections for a genuinely
democratic national Parliament.</p>
