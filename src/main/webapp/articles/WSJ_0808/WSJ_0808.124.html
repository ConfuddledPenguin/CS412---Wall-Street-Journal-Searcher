	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department, as expected,
filed suit to block a plan by Procter & Gamble Co., the maker
of Pepto-Bismol, to acquire the exclusive sales rights for
Maalox, another stomach remedy.
   The Justice Department sought a court injunction under the
Clayton AntiTrust Act to prevent Procter & Gamble from
acquiring the exclusive rights to market and distribute
Maalox.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Court papers filed in federal court in Philadelphia
charged that the proposed agreement between Cincinnati-based
Procter & Gamble and Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc., which makes
Maalox, would lessen competition in the market of
over-the-counter stomach remedies.</p>
<p>Procter & Gamble, based in Cincinnati, sold $125 million
of Pepto-Bismol last year, or 14% of the domestic retail
market. Domestic sales of Maalox totaled $111 million last
year, or 12% of the market.</p>
<p>Under the proposal, Procter & Gamble would acquire the
exclusive rights to market and sell Maalox and an option to
purchase the manufacturing assets from Rhone-Poulenc Rorer,
which is based in Fort Washington, Pa. The deal would make
Procter & Gamble the largest seller of stomach remedies in
the U.S. market, according to the complaint.</p>
