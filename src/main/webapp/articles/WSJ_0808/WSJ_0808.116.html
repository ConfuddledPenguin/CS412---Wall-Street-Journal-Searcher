	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Pfizer Inc. said it would attempt to establish
a registry of more than 55,000 patients world-wide who have
received a potentially defective Shiley heart valve.
   Pfizer's Shiley subsidiary sold about 86,000 of the valves
between 1978 and 1986. Defects in the valves have contributed
to the death of 252 people, Pfizer has said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The patient registry would be one of the first ever
developed for a medical device and could have implications
for manufacturers and users of a variety of implantable
devices.</p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration is considering whether
patients should be notified directly in circumstances where
potential problems arise with such devices. Under current
policy, only doctors receive such notice from either the FDA
or a manufacturer. A registry would permit broad notification
much the way car manufacturers advise owners of recalls.</p>
<p>Pfizer's announcement comes as the company is under
increasing legal and regulatory pressure over the valve. The
California Supreme Court recently ruled that a woman could
sue Pfizer for damages related to anxiety over her implanted
valve, even though it is working properly. And the FDA is
reviewing a petition by Public Citizen, a Washington consumer
group, to require Pfizer to notify patients directly of
potential problems with the valve.</p>
<p>"This is long overdue," said Sidney Wolfe, director of
Public Citizen, of Pfizer's plans. While companies and some
federal agencies maintain patient registries for pacemakers,
there is no broad requirement that such records be
maintained. "This is a message to anyone selling these
devices," Mr. Wolfe said, to set up registries at the
beginning, "before a product is established as defective
rather than afterward."</p>
<p>But Pfizer said setting up the registry didn't necessarily
mean it would notify everyone on the list of the concerns
over the device. "We're not doing this to make a blanket
announcement," said Steven Kany, Pfizer's senior assistant
general counsel.</p>
<p>Because the risk of surgery to replace the valve, or of
other health factors, could be higher than the risk of valve
failure, Mr. Kany said, notifying patients of the potential
defect could cause unnecessary alarm. "In most
circumstances," he said, "the doctor is the right person to
give information to patients."</p>
<p>But Public Citizen's Mr. Wolfe says his organization
continues to hear from patients who have heard nothing from
their doctors about the problems.</p>
<p>Mr. Kany said Pfizer previously supported the concept of a
registry, saying such a record would be useful for patient
notification if necessary and for collecting research data.
When the valve was marketed it included a card for doctors to
return to Pfizer but only 45% of the cards were returned, Mr.
Kany said, and all contain information at least five years
old. Pfizer will work with doctors, hospitals and insurers to
develop the registry.</p>
<p>One concern, Mr. Kany said, is that the registry would
land in the hands of plaintiffs attorneys, who could use it
to solicit clients.</p>
<p>The valves in question are Shiley's 60-degree and
70-degree convexo-concave Bjork model heart valves. The FDA
banned the use of the 60-degree model in 1986 and Pfizer
stopped selling the other model, which was marketed only
abroad.</p>
