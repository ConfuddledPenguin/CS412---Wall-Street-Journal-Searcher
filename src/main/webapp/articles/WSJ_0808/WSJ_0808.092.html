	<p class="article-leader">Martin Feldstein's article "Trade Economic Aid for Soviet
Arms Cuts" (editorial page, June 28) described how the U.S.
could reach "clear military superiority" over the Soviet
Union. From his point of view, it would be foolish not to
spend "a few tens of billions of dollars" to obtain a major
reduction in Soviet military capacity in exchange for massive
economic aid.
   In other words, he suggests using recent Soviet economic
difficulties to fulfill an old dream in the West -- military
superiority over the Soviet Union.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Even though he mentions the necessity of some U.S.
military reductions, the U.S. superiority thus obtained
supposedly would ensure peace for the rest of the world. Can
you imagine what the American reaction would be if some
people in the Soviet Union aspired to the role of "world
peacekeepers" in such a manner?</p>
<p>Mr. Feldstein is wrong in thinking my country could ever
sell its security for consumer goods and know-how. Recently,
the Communist Party Congress in Moscow adopted a resolution
on national defense policy saying in particular that a
military threat to the Soviet Union persists as long as there
are no guarantees of the irreversibility of positive changes
in the military and political situation. Under these
conditions the Party Congress considers it a major task to
strengthen and maintain the Soviet Union's defense capacity
at a reasonably sufficient level.</p>
<p>As one can see from the example of the postwar period, the
desire to have military superiority has fed the arms race and
increased international tension and the threat of war. The
belief in my country is that the existing rough parity
between the Soviet Union and the U.S., and between the Warsaw
Treaty Organization and NATO, is the decisive factor
preventing wars. This parity should be maintained, but at
steadily decreasing levels.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union is already applying this principle. From
1989 to the end of this year the Soviet armed forces will be
unilaterally reduced by 500,000 men and officers, 10,000
tanks, 8,500 artillery systems and 820 combat aircraft. In
1989 it unilaterally reduced its armed forces by 265,000 men
and officers, withdrew 27,400 servicemen from the Northern,
Western, Central and Southern groups of forces in Europe and
22,900 from Mongolia. The number of Soviet weapons in Europe
went down by 9,320 tanks, 5,050 artillery systems and 835
warplanes.</p>
<p>More than 59,000 servicemen, 1,370 tanks, more than 1,040
artillery systems and 173 combat aircraft have been withdrawn
from Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and Mongolia this year.</p>
<p>The Soviet navy has scrapped 12 submarines and 28 surface
ships, and moth-balled three submarines and 11 surface ships.
Besides, 500 tactical nuclear charges have been withdrawn
from Warsaw Treaty countries. The Soviet Union is prepared to
pull all its nuclear weapons out from allied countries, if
the U.S. acts likewise.</p>
<p>The restructuring of the Soviet armed forces is proceeding
under the sign of defense. But realization of defense
sufficiency is possible only on the basis of reciprocity.</p>
<p>Reciprocity is the only way to curb the arms race and
disarm. This is the best way we have of achieving, using Mr.
Feldstein's words, "greater military security" and "greater
global stability." And it is also the best way for the U.S.
to reduce safely its own military spending.</p>
