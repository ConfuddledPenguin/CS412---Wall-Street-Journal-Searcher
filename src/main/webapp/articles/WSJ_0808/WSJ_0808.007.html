	<p class="article-leader">Tensions continued on the home front of the Mideast
crisis, as people hurled accusations about rising gasoline
prices -- using forums on Capitol Hill and at pumps from
coast to coast.
   As House and Senate panels held three separate hearings,
irate New England customers demanded that station owners
produce gas invoices, Los Angeles drivers filled-up more
often and a would-be Dallas vacationer feared she would have
to cut back travel plans.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A gallon of unleaded self-service regular gas averaged
$1.20 yesterday, up about 13 cents since last Wednesday, said
the American Automobile Association.</p>
<p>"The U.S. should declare war on Iraq, and the 200 senators
and representatives of the House of the state of
Massachusetts should be sent to the front line," said Bryan
Horshowowsky, a Revere, Mass., Ford car salesman, about the
gas-price boosts. "Everybody wants more money and who's
paying? We, the helpless consumer."</p>
<p>In response to such outbursts, some of the same witnesses
from the Energy Department, the oil industry and think tanks
moved from one hearing to another on Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>Lawmakers peppered oil executives with questions about the
workings of the oil and gasoline markets, pausing only
momentarily -- if at all -- for answers. Rep. Edward Markey
(D., Mass.) said: "If the loss of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil on
the world market leads to a price increase, then we will all
understand that the laws of supply and demand are still
working. But when the retail prices start increasing less
than 24 hours after the Iraqis invaded Kuwait, then we know
that the laws of war profiteering are at work."</p>
<p>Still, there was no call in Congress to reinstitute the
federal oil and gas price controls imposed during the energy
crises of the 1970s.</p>
<p>Oil-industry representatives and some private economists
labored to explain the intricacies of the oil markets to
members of Congress. Their explanations for the price rises,
in general, were these:</p>
<p>Oil is priced when it is delivered to the refinery, not
when contracted for. Glenn Tilton, president of Texaco Inc.'s
Texaco Refining & Marketing Inc., said that "oil shipped
several weeks ago arrives today and is paid at today's market
prices" no matter what the price was when the contract was
signed.</p>
<p>Also, the industry representatives said, oil companies
haven't raised wholesale gasoline prices as much as crude oil
prices have risen. And gasoline prices rapidly reflect the
prices set in the New York Mercantile Exchange and other
commodity markets, both cash and futures.</p>
<p>A service-station owner complained of being "trapped in
the middle" between angry consumers and prices that soar in a
matter of a few hours.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a number of lawmakers, as well as
representatives of some consumer groups, called on President
Bush to pressure the oil industry to roll back price
increases, urged the selling of oil in the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve to hold down prices, called for an
investigation into the oil-futures market and its role in
setting oil prices, and said Congress should pass laws
requiring higher fuel-economy standards for autos.</p>
<p>Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said a "massive paper
chase" had begun to discover if there was any collusion
involved in the price increases. In a meeting with reporters,
the attorney general said, "There are allegations of
wrongdoing that will be pursued."</p>
<p>The voices at gas stations may have lacked a boost from
Washington's echoing corridors, but they were loud enough.</p>
<p>"I just can't stand the thought of someone taking
advantage of me," said Irene Soltau, a Plymouth, Mass.,
resident who works as a federal court secretary. "I'm ready
to do anything, even walk 20 miles to work, to fight back."
She now drives to a subway station outside Boston and rides
the train the rest of the way to her downtown office in
Boston.</p>
<p>Prices in Massachusetts have risen an average of 11 cents
a gallon since June 25, according to a survey by the state's
Commissioner of Energy Resources. Of that, about seven cents
is from last month's gasoline-tax increase ordered by the
financially strapped state.</p>
<p>In Providence, R.I., Shell station manager Victor Realejo
said wholesale increases of three cents a gallon Friday night
and five cents Saturday morning were passed on and quickly
brought out customer hostilities in the affluent suburb.</p>
<p>"About 75 percent of the people who come in complain,"
Realejo said. "I had to show them my gas invoices for them to
believe it."</p>
<p>Tooran Montazeri, a 47-year-old registered nurse from West
Los Angeles, said she has also been shopping for cheaper
prices and filling up more often. "I can't drive any less
than I do unless I get another job," she said while filling
her tank at a busy Chevron station in West Los Angeles.</p>
<p>A native of Iran who has lived in the U.S. for more than
20 years, Ms. Montazeri said she is "very, very worried about
war" in the Middle East and wouldn't be surprised if there
were gasoline shortages here soon. "I fear the worst from
Iraq."</p>
<p>But others took the increases in stride. Of the dozen or
so patrons interviewed at two Dallas gas stations, three said
they weren't aware of gas-price boosts and the rest said they
weren't changing their buying habits regardless of increases.</p>
<p>Shell station manager Dawn Bailey said most of her
customers are continuing to fill their tanks as normal. But
she might have to change vacation plans. "I'm driving north
in two weeks, and I had my gas mileage all figured so I'd
know what my budget would be," she said. "I was counting on
$1.15 a gallon all the way to Minnesota. Now, I don't know
what it will be. It's going to make a difference in how long
I can afford to stay up there."</p>
<p>One Dallas patron was even happy about the prices. "I'm
glad they're going up," said Bob Sandifer, owner of a small
food processing company. "It's good for the economy here."</p>
