	<p class="article-leader">ORLANDO, Fla. -- Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. reported a
second-quarter net loss of $23 million, or 39 cents a share,
compared with a year-earlier net loss of $42.6 million, or 84
cents a share.
   The publishing and insurance concern, which is shouldering
a heavy debt load stemming from a 1987 recapitalization
program, attributed the improvement to a reduction in
interest and other expenses, as well as higher revenue.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Harcourt said that largely because it used proceeds from
the sale of its theme parks to pare debt, interest expense
dropped to $66 million in the latest quarter, compared with
$91.6 million a year ago. First-half interest expense fell to
$124.1 million from $179 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>In the 1989 second quarter, Harcourt had a loss from
continuing operations of $70.1 million, or $1.21 a share, and
a profit from discontinued operations of $27.5 million, or 37
cents a share. Revenue rose 6% to $348.5 million from $328.6
million.</p>
<p>Robert E. Evanson, executive vice president, said that the
third quarter -- traditionally the most important for the
publishing business -- should prove to be the most
significant for Harcourt this year. "It's nice to be going
into the busy season ahead of schedule, but the important
quarter is right now -- this will be the key quarter," Mr.
Evanson said.</p>
<p>For the six months, Harcourt reported a net loss of $94.9
million, or $1.47 a share, compared with a loss from
continuing operations of $167.7 million, or $2.77 a share, a
year earlier.</p>
<p>For the year-earlier six months, income from discontinued
operations of $9 million brought the net loss to $158.7
million, or $2.64 a share.</p>
<p>Revenue rose 9.7% to $625.4 million from $570.2 million.</p>
