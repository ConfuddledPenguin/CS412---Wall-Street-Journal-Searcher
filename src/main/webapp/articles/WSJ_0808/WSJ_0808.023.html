	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stocks reeled up and down like a yo-yo and the
bond market fell sharply again, responding to a volatile oil
market that shook with each bulletin from the Middle East.
   Late-afternoon news reports that the U.S. was moving
troops into Saudi Arabia to defend against Iraqi invasion
sparked a rally in the dollar and firmed stock and bond
prices. Signs of escalating tensions had buoyed the dollar
against most other major currencies throughout the day.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 5.70 lower at
2710.64, its sixth consecutive loss. Broader market measures,
including the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter
stocks, closed slightly higher, however.</p>
<p>Crude oil prices opened weak yesterday morning, and the
stock and bond markets rallied explosively as bargain-hunters
swooped in.</p>
<p>Investors lunged for cheap growth stocks, including many
technology shares, which advanced sharply in early trading.</p>
<p>Compaq Computer gained 1 3/8 to 53 7/8. An abundance of
buy orders caused delayed openings in Warner-Lambert, Capital
Cities/ABC and Ingersoll-Rand on the New York Stock Exchange;
each stock has been a favorite with investors over the past
few months.</p>
<p>"You have some of the highest-quality companies in this
country down 25% to 30% in a week," said James Awad,
president of BMI Capital, a money management firm. "I am
buying aggressively. My cash level is down to 10% and going
lower, and I expect to be fully invested."</p>
<p>Mr. Awad said he expects a quick resolution to the Middle
East crisis and looks for the Federal Reserve to cut interest
rates -- both events that he says would trigger a quick
rebound in stock prices.</p>
<p>"Bearishness is pervasive, capitulation is pervasive," Mr.
Awad said. "But every time there has been a panic like this,
if investors bought stocks they made money."</p>
<p>Other money managers were less certain. The Dow Jones
industrials' 30-point rally was erased by 11:30 a.m. EDT and
the average went into the loss column as dozens of big
institutions, still jittery from the recent turmoil, began
offering large blocks of stock. Traders watched in
astonishment as the rally stalled, then scrambled to unload
sell orders they were holding for clients. Many people on
brokerage-firm trading desks thought the market would rally
strongly for much of the session after Monday's 93.31-point
sell-off.</p>
<p>"Most fund managers want to see the Treasury auction, the
U.S. budget compromise and the Middle East crisis resolved
before they commit heavily to the stock market," said Peter
Vanden-Berg, senior vice president at Shearson Lehman
Brothers.</p>
<p>Shortly before noon, the Federal Reserve indicated through
a transaction in the money markets that it had no intention
of lowering interest rates. The industrial average
immediately fell about 15 additional points, and short-term
interest rates began to rise.</p>
<p>Bond traders scrambled to adjust their bids for $11.5
billion in new three-year notes, the first leg of a
three-part, $32.25 billion Treasury auction this week. Later,
auction results showed less demand than expected, and the
yield on the new note rose to 8.20% at one point. The average
auction yield was 8.10%.</p>
<p>George Gianaris, sales manager at Daiwa Securities
America, a dealer in U.S. Treasury securities, said
developments in the Middle East could jerk new 10-year note
and 30-year bond yields in all directions. But the usual big
buyers aren't expected to be aggressive at either of the debt
sales, which occur today and Thursday.</p>
<p>"Domestic investors are jittery, and Japanese investors
will not participate to the degree they did in May, because
they are concerned about their own stock and bond markets,"
Mr. Gianaris said.</p>
<p>In major market activity:</p>
<p>Stocks finished mixed. The Big Board churned through its
fourth consecutive session of volume over 200 million shares;
yesterday's total was 231,580,000.</p>
<p>Bonds were lower. After a volatile session, in which
prices on 30-year Treasury bonds lost as much as a point,
benchmark Treasurys finished down 1/2 point, or $5.00 for
each $1,000 face amount.</p>
<p>The dollar rose. In late New York trading, the currency
was quoted at 1.5875 marks and 150.95 yen, up from 1.5765
marks and 150.32 yen late Monday.</p>
