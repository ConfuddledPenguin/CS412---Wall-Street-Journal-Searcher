	<p class="article-leader">POTEAU, Okla. -- The boycott of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil
should be a boon for the U.S. Oil Patch. It conjures up
visions of companies suddenly drilling new holes, plopping
down rigs and watching as geysers of American crude replace
some of Saddam Hussein's oil.
   The reality is not so pretty. Even before Iraq's invasion,
a small boom in U.S. oil exploration had come up against an
ugly reality: The infrastructure of oil exploration and
production in the U.S. seriously atrophied during the '80s.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The capacity of the U.S. oil-field service and equipment
industry to accomplish things -- big things like building
pipelines or small things like manufacturing drill bits --
has withered to about 50% of its peak a decade ago, says
Charlie Oliver, president of Fluor Daniel Corp.'s oil
division.</p>
<p>Scores of companies have vanished; they've gone bankrupt,
merged or simply called it quits. The survivors have slashed
budgets, cut loose most of their experienced help and sold
off equipment -- or let it rust in back lots and bayous.</p>
<p>The shortage of trained help is acute. Unit Corp. of Tulsa
had to turn down million-dollar contracts to drill 10 new
wells in the past two months because it couldn't find
experienced workers. Parker Drilling Co. dispatched more than
a dozen workers all the way across Louisiana to drill a well
in Lafayette, once an oil mecca crawling with seasoned men
ready to work.</p>
<p>Warehouse shelves are nearly empty of the mundane valves,
fittings and connectors that keep rigs running. In a few
months, the industry could actually start running out of the
super-strength pipe used to turn drill bits.</p>
<p>Even ordinary earth-moving equipment and backhoes are in
short supply. Repairs of sophisticated monitoring equipment
that once took hours now take days.</p>
<p>Domestic production could never again satisfy America's
voracious energy appetite, of course; it can't begin to
replace all of the 8.4 million barrels a day of petroleum now
imported. After a century of high U.S. production, there
simply isn't enough left underground. But stepped-up oil and
gas output at home could at least slow the growing reliance
on foreign oil.</p>
<p>It has happened before. After the oil price shocks of the
1970s, furious exploration and drilling halted a long decline
in domestic reserves and production. That, coupled with
conscientious conservation, cut oil imports by the early
1980s to 32% of U.S. consumption, before they rose to a
record of nearly 50% of consumption in the first half of this
year.</p>
<p>Recently, savvy independents and even Big Oil have again
been sinking new wells in the U.S. at a rising rate. Last
month, more than 1,000 drilling rigs were grinding away, up
from 832 a year earlier and 663 four years ago. The incentive
was last year's steady 30% rise in U.S. crude prices to an
average of about $20 a barrel.</p>
<p>Mini-oil-booms have been rocking along this year from
sagebrush towns of South Texas to Alabama, Kansas and
Wyoming. Drillers are working in Alaska's icy Chukchi Sea and
in the deep blue waters far into the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>Though it started with gutsy little companies, the game
has been joined by big players in the past few months. With
DuPont Co.'s Conoco unit planning to spend upwards of $600
million in 1990, "we'll probably have the biggest year ever
in exploration," says Constantine Nicandros, the Conoco chief
executive.</p>
<p>Mobil Corp. projects annual capital spending above $5
billion in a few years, 50% higher than in 1989. Exxon plans
to spend $500 million developing just two Gulf of Mexico
fields. Texaco Inc. raised domestic spending on exploration
25% this year and expects to maintain that level at least
through 1995.</p>
<p>For many companies, natural gas is as good a target as
crude oil, because rising oil prices tend to tow gas prices
along. Gas is also more plentiful than oil in the U.S., and
can be an effective substitute for imported oil in many
applications. Coastal Corp. has been sitting on a backlog of
500 gas discoveries, but wouldn't drill until convinced that
prices justified it. "We are now beginning," James Paul, the
president, said before the Iraqi invasion.</p>
<p>Because $20 oil had all that impact on U.S. output, it
might seem the new prices well above $25, if sustained,
should turn the rebound into a stampede. After all, the
industry took full advantage of the oil shocks of the '70s.</p>
<p>Back then, however, things were different. Oil-field
businesses were many, rich, well-equipped and fully staffed.
Money to finance growth was beating a path to their door;
everyone from New York bankers to Los Angeles dentists wanted
to invest in the Oil Patch. To expand, "you just placed the
orders," says C.R. Palmer, chairman of the drilling company
Rowan Cos.</p>
<p>This time, the industry is staggered, investors are wary
and the infrastructure is weak. The drilling recovery "could
stop short just as it gets started," warns Matthew Simmons, a
Houston investment banker.</p>
<p>For instance, here in the Ouachita Mountains stretching
from Oklahoma 100 miles into Arkansas, three times as many
wells are being sunk as last year -- but shortages are part
of the daily routine on most rig sites. Not long ago, Jeff
Nelson, head of a Mobil team drilling a four-mile-deep gas
well, spent half of one night looking for welders; he called
eight before he got one.</p>
<p>"Personnel is the critical issue of the '90s," says Robert
Parker Jr., president of Parker Drilling, the company that
sent the workers across Louisiana. To ease such problems,
Parker has reopened its "drilling school" in Odessa, Texas,
which was closed during the mid-1980s. Ten former auto
workers there are learning to drill ultra-deep Oklahoma gas
wells.</p>
<p>Last month, Texas A&M University began training $8-an-hour
roughnecks to "run pipe" through wells, using an Abilene
school shuttered since 1986; the first class of seven will
graduate this month. And headhunters are scouring the country
in hopes of luring $50,000-a-year geologists and
geophysicists back to the Southwest.</p>
<p>Earle Lamborn, the head of oil-rig operations for Unit
Corp., the firm that had to turn down contracts for lack of
manpower, is a frustrated man. "I hate that," he says. "We
need every contract we can get." Unit nearly suffocated in
the collapse of U.S. oil and gas exploration of the 1980s and
hasn't made a dime in six years. The spurned contracts would
have raised monthly revenue more than 40%, or $1.3 million.</p>
<p>In 1981, the Tulsa-based contractor had 650
rough-and-ready drillers on its payroll. That dropped to 410
a half-dozen years ago -- and now just 220. "We haven't
trained anybody in years," he says.</p>
<p>And many of the trained people may be gone for good. One
possible reason is that drilling is growing more complex
because of technological changes, while at the same time
remaining grimy, dangerous work where bodies are bruised and
fingers easily lost. Many experienced workers "have found
something else to do and they're not apt to come back," says
Robert Spears, a Tulsa consultant.</p>
<p>Men like Tony Morris. Son of a roughneck and "Employee of
the Year 1980" in his small drilling outfit in eastern
Oklahoma, he epitomized those who were once the lifeblood of
the Oil Patch. Mr. Morris left two years ago to drive trucks
and vows he'll never return. "I've found easier ways to make
a dollar," he says. After a decade of declining wages, work
and benefits, the already tough life just became too
insecure. "You don't know if you'll work the next day," he
says.</p>
<p>That leaves headaches for the survivors -- men like Paul
Murray, a "tool pusher" who heads up Unit Corp. drilling rig
no. 36 leased here to Mobil. "As more rigs get put up, the
hands jump around," he says. In fact, labor is so tight that
he was promoted after just six months with the company. Now
he drives his white Chevy pickup 270 miles across Oklahoma
twice a week to get here.</p>
<p>"There's fixing to be a bidding war" for roughnecks -- the
basic category of well worker -- mutters Dee Morris, rig 36's
other "tool pusher," or man in charge of the drilling.
Unshaven, unwashed and unkempt after days of nonstop work,
Mr. Morris says the scuttlebutt is that competitors are
offering 50-cent-an-hour raises. Roughnecks currently earn
about $8 to $8.50 an hour. "The hands are griping. I wouldn't
be surprised if I lose a few," he says.</p>
<p>When that happens, it can hurt. Down the road a dozen
miles, where a Unit crew did lose a roughneck to another
drilling company, there now are two "young guys" with less
than two weeks' experience working on the rig, says Alan
Williams, a skilled 17-year company veteran. So far, nothing
has gone wrong. But new workers frighten him because of the
heightened chance of injuries.</p>
<p>"It would be a nightmare to fire up a new rig with all new
hands," he says. "It probably takes a good year to train a
hand where you don't have to lead him around by his hand."</p>
<p>The revitalization of South Texas oilfields by a new
technology called horizontal drilling has created tremendous
demand for workers there, says Energy Service Co., which is
canvassing the area to find foremen with experience in that
specialized process.</p>
<p>Finding people who can build an oil platform is just as
hard as finding men to work one. When Phillips Petroleum Co.
wanted to build a new platform in the Gulf of Mexico 90 miles
off Louisiana this year, it found only a handful of
experienced companies still making them. And they were busy.
The lowest bidder promised delivery next year, four months
too late for Phillips's schedule, says Rolf Wieborg, a
Phillips offshore manager.</p>
<p>"We ended up splitting the contract in two" to speed
delivery, he says, but that cost more and now he fears rising
contractor prices will kill some other drilling projects
before they start.</p>
<p>Certain hardware is scarce, too. There are still a lot of
derricks available, but that may not mean much because
warehouse shelves are emptying of the mundane materials that
oil people call rope, soap and dope. "We've been using that
stuff up ever since the boom," says Terry Adams, an Oklahoma
rig worker.</p>
<p>"The supply train is severely taxed," says Mr. Oliver of
Fluor. One example: Orders for certain compressors and pumps
take from eight months to 18 months to fill. "Something's got
to give," he says.</p>
<p>For now, it's price. At a recent Houston auction, a
3,000-horsepower rig motor assembly sold for $42,000; the
same equipment sold for a quarter of that in a 1986 Morgan
City, La., auction. Some drill-rig parts have soared 15-fold
compared with prices at that big Morgan City sale.</p>
<p>Used drill pipe that last year cost $12.50 a foot now goes
for $18.50, and new pipe would cost around $25 if it could be
had. Drillers have been living on leftovers for years and now
some veteran oil men claim there isn't enough pipe around to
run 50 more rigs.</p>
<p>The catch is that lease rates for a rig aren't yet high
enough to justify ordering new pipe -- so hardly anyone is
making it.</p>
<p>Some items like that are likely to stay scarce for a long
time even if demand keeps rising. "We're not going to open a
new plant as fast this time," says Bennie Daricek, a 17-year
veteran with Cameron Iron Works. "During the good days a man
would have to wait three years for a blowout preventer," he
says, referring to a crucial component of an oil-drilling
operation. "When the bust came, people canceled three years
of orders. We got stuck."</p>
<p>On the other hand, amid all the shortages there are still
some gluts. Never-used eight-year-old mud pumps, which
lubricate drill bits, still languish in Cooper Industries
Inc.'s inventory, says Robert Cizik, chairman. "I'll give you
a mud pump just like that," he says, snapping his fingers.
"I'll give you 10. I'll give you 20. How many do you want?"</p>
<p>John Cassidy has more than mud pumps. Probably the biggest
dealer in used oil-field equipment, he still has millions of
dollars of equipment stacked up in his 160-acre yard in
Stroud, Okla. He bought a lot of it in the downturn for as
little as a penny on the dollar.</p>
<p>For about $45,000 in 1985, Mr. Cassidy bought a derrick
and platform that had cost $1 million new in the early '80s.
Right now it wouldn't fetch more than $7,000 as scrap. But
he'll wait. "It's just too early to sell," he says. And then
he grins.</p>
