	<p class="article-leader">Unions Miss the Mark
   In Slighting Small Firms</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>UNION INROADS have been greater at big companies than at
smaller ones, but many small companies are sitting targets.</p>
<p>So say researchers Charles Brown, James Hamilton and James
Medoff in their recently published book "Employers Large and
Small" (Harvard University Press). Employee dissatisfaction
with wages and working conditions tends to be greater at
smaller companies, they say.</p>
<p>Moreover, their evidence shows unions help close the gap
between the often skimpy fringe benefits at smaller companies
and those at big employers. "Small employers today have many
characteristics that should make them prime targets for
organizing drives," the authors find.</p>
<p>They say the share of unionized companies climbs from 8%
for employers with fewer than 50 workers to 66% for companies
with more than 1,000 workers. Overall, 18% of the U.S. work
force is unionized.</p>
<p>Unions tilt their organizing efforts toward large
companies, even though the bigger the target, the less likely
unions are to win acceptance, the study indicates. Complaints
by labor officials of illegal opposition to organizing
campaigns also occur more often at small companies, according
to the researchers.</p>
<p>Why do unions tend to zero in on bigger firms? It's a
matter of economics, say the authors. Organizing costs don't
rise in proportion to a company's size, but the potential
payoff in the form of increased member dues is much larger at
big employers.</p>
<p>Rehearsing Executives</p>
<p>Before a Roadshow</p>
<p>GIVING LESSONS to companies going public is a growing
business for a California coach.</p>
<p>Jerry Weissman of Power Presentations, Santa Clara,
Calif., helps top executives of young businesses deliver
convincing pitches as they try to spark interest in their
companies' initial public offerings.</p>
<p>Executives know the "roadshow" isn't easy. They must
convince analysts, investors and portfolio managers that a
company will make lots of money. All eyes are on the speaker;
sweaty palms are common.</p>
<p>Top executives often compound the task with inept
performances. "They empty the file when they speak," boring
listeners with unnecessary data, says Mr. Weissman. Also,
"they speak the way the prospectus reads: `It is hoped that
the company flourishes in this market. . .'" Though many
media-shy executives go to public-speaking coaches, Mr.
Weissman's program is more specialized.</p>
<p>Mr. Weissman videotapes an executive's message, then
critiques the performance. "It's exactly like studying their
golf stroke," he says. "They see themselves as others see
them." Finally, at "dress rehearsals," Mr. Weissman peppers
the client with questions. Despite a $10,000 fee, he says,
there is a waiting list.</p>
<p>Paul Grayson, chairman of Micrografx Inc., Richardson,
Texas, tells of former problems, "shifting my weight back and
forth," among other things, before Mr. Weissman cured him.
"He showed us how to handle the tough questions from the
audience . . . and there were a lot of tough questions," he
says.</p>
<p>Mr. Grayson says the training helped Micrografx to sell
1.3 million shares in June in its first public offering, at
$16 a share. Before the roadshow, he had hoped to get a price
of about $13 a share.</p>
<p>New England Is Paying</p>
<p>For Its Overconfidence</p>
<p>SMALL BUSINESSES in New England can blame part of their
current problems on overconfidence generated by the region's
economic boom of the 1980s, some economists say.</p>
<p>A recent rise in business failures there follows several
years of prosperity for Northeastern entrepreneurs, with
unemployment rates touching the lowest levels since World War
II.</p>
<p>"Two years ago, one out of every two {New England} firms
had a job opening it couldn't fill," says William C.
Dunkelberg, chief economist of the National Federation of
Independent Business and dean of Temple University's business
school. "That kind of excitement generally breeds
overexuberance."</p>
<p>Dun & Bradstreet Corp. found Massachusetts failures in the
first four months nearly quadrupled from the year-earlier
period. Failures were up 156% in Vermont, 100% in Rhode
Island and 97% in New Hampshire.</p>
<p>Large and small companies are included in the totals. But
"we know that most of the failed firms are small," says
Douglas Handler, a Dun & Bradstreet economist. "Smaller
companies tend to operate at the margins. Any increase in
economic stress brings about a disproportionate increase in
their failures."</p>
<p>Lynn Browne, vice president and economist of the Federal
Reserve Bank of Boston, says real-estate companies are in
trouble and retail space that used to house boutiques is
conspicuously empty. "Two years ago, everybody was talking
labor shortages," Ms. Browne says. "It really does make you
doubt the worth of long-range forecasting."</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>THOUGH President Bush's veto of a parental-leave bill was
upheld by Congress, more than 20 states have passed laws
requiring companies or state government to grant leave to
workers for critical family matters without jeopardizing
employment status. . . . European venture capitalists
invested the equivalent of $5.5 billion in small European
companies in 1989, up 24% from the year before, says KPMG
Peat Marwick. U.K. companies received the most money,
followed by France, Italy, West Germany and the Netherlands.</p>
