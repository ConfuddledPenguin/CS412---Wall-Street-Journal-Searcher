	<p class="article-leader">Over-the-counter stocks rebounded slightly and hung on to
their gains, despite a fall in exchange-listed shares
triggered by reports that U.S. troops were moving into Saudi
Arabia.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 2.04 to 402.08, a 0.5%
gain, compared with a 0.2% loss in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average. Volume eased to 165.5 million shares from 174.8
million shares Monday as advancing stocks overtook decliners,
1,106 to 964.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We're not out of the woods yet," said Eric Siefert, a
senior OTC trader with Shearson Lehman Brothers, who kept a
close eye on televised reports of developments in the Middle
East. Calling the day's gains a "technical bounce," Mr.
Siefert agreed with other traders that professional dealers
and investors were making investment decisions based on
unfolding developments in the Middle East and the direction
of the bond market and exchange-listed shares.</p>
<p>"Everybody's trading from a defensive point of view and
staying close to the vest," said Robert Antolini, head of OTC
trading for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. Mr. Antolini added
that OTC trading desks are keeping their inventories of
shares low.</p>
<p>Many of the OTC market's largest stocks reclaimed their
lead after Monday's plunge, but larger issues ended the day
mixed. Intel added 5/8 to 37 7/8; Conner Peripherals gained 1
to 22 7/8; Sun Microsystems rebounded 1 to 28 5/8; Liz
Claiborne regained 1 1/8 to 26, and Nike advanced 2 1/8 to 74
7/8. The Nasdaq 100 Index added 2.40 to 405.31, while the
Nasdaq Industrial Index gained 2.45 to 429.01.</p>
<p>Apple Computer closed unchanged at 39 1/2, as did Oracle
Systems at 14 7/8. Shortly after the market closed, Oracle
introduced a new database server called Oracle Server for
Apple Macintosh computers.</p>
<p>Amgen slipped 1 1/4 to 80 1/4. The executive secretary of
a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel told Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report that scheduling problems prevent
the panel from meeting in November. Analysts had expected the
panel to meet then to review the Thousand Oaks, Calif.,
biotechnology concern's G-CSF product used to stimulate white
blood cell production. The executive secretary said she hopes
the meeting will occur by year end.</p>
<p>ransportation issues, pummeled Monday on fears of higher
oil prices, also reclaimed some losses as the Nasdaq
Transportation Index rebounded 8.66 to 444.59.</p>
<p>Yellow Freight System gained 7/8 to 24 1/8; Roadway
Services, also a motor freight carrier, jumped 2 1/4 to 34;
Arkansas Freightways added 1 to 19 1/4, and J.B. Hunt
Transport rose 1/2 to 17.</p>
<p>However, airline shares turned in a mixed performance:
American West Airlines gained 1/4 to 7 1/2 and Mesa Airlines
edged up 1/8 to 7 1/4, but commuter airline Air Wis Services
eased 1/8 to 8 5/8.</p>
<p>Utility shares, hammered Monday on fears of higher
interest rates, regained some lost ground. The Nasdaq Utility
Index climbed 2.76 to 553.10 as market leader MCI
Communications added 5/8 to 34 5/8. Among natural gas
utilities, Delta Natural Gas advanced 3/8 to 12 1/4;
Northwest Natural Gas climbed 1/4 to 22 7/8, and Public
Service Co. of North Carolina added 1/8 to 16 3/8. Magma
Power, a San Diego, developer of geothermal resources, jumped
1 3/4 to 35 1/2.</p>
<p>Seattle Filmworks added 1 to 7 5/8 after the Seattle
mail-order film processor said it plans to buy back up to
200,000 shares of its nearly 1.8 million common shares
outstanding.</p>
<p>Central Fidelity Banks climbed 3/4 to 24 after the
Richmond, Va., bank said late Monday it plans to buy back up
to 750,000 shares, or about 5%, of its common stock.</p>
<p>Buffets rose 1/2 to 18 3/4. Late Monday, the Eden Prairie,
Minn., restaurant chain reported net income for the second
quarter ended July 18 rose to 24 cents a share from 17 cents
a year earlier.</p>
<p>Gish Biomedical jumped 1 1/2 to 11 7/8. Monday, analyst
Steven E. Crowley of Craig-Hallum, Minneapolis, raised his
investment opinion on the Santa Ana, Calif., medical-products
maker to an "accumulate" from a "hold," DJPIR said.</p>
<p>Gish Biomedical's chief financial officer, Jeanne M.
Miller, told DJPIR she had "no problem" with Mr. Crowley's
estimate that the company earned 15 cents a share in fourth
quarter ended June 30, up from 12 cents a year earlier. Those
earnings are scheduled to be reported between Aug. 15 and
Aug. 30, she said.</p>
<p>Ms. Miller also said Gish was listed as one of 500 top
growth stocks Aug. 7 issue of Financial World magazine. She
added that "a parade of corporate finance people" have
recently visited the company, trying to interest it in a
transaction such as a secondary public offering. However, Ms.
Miller said the company has no interest in such a
transaction.</p>
<p>Some other medical products concerns also rebounded after
Monday's thrashing: Shares of heart valve maker St. Jude
Medical jumped 2 3/8 to 29 and specialty medical-device maker
Stryker leaped 2 3/8 to 25.</p>
<p>Sigma-Aldrich plummeted 4 5/8 to 55 5/8. The St. Louis
producer of biochemical and organic products reported net
income for the second quarter ended June 30 of 73 cents a
share compared with 66 cents a year earlier. That profit was
below analysts' expectations of 75 cents a share, according
to First Call, a unit of Thomson Financial Networks.</p>
<p>Cetus fell 1/4 to 9 1/4 after the Emeryville, Calif.,
biotechnology concern reported a loss for the fourth quarter
ended June 30 of 53 cents a share on 30.8 million shares
outstanding, versus a year-earlier loss of 53 cents on nearly
27 million shares outstanding.</p>
<p>W. R. Berkley slid 1/4 to 35 3/4. After the market closed
Monday, the Greenwich, Conn., insurer estimated it could face
a charge of $10 million, or 84 cents a share, in the third
quarter ending Sept. 30, following arbitration of a
reinsurance dispute. In the year-earlier third quarter,
Berkley reported net income of $1.03 a share.</p>
