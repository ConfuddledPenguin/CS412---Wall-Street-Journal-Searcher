	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- President Bush plans to send scores of U.S.
combat aircraft and thousands of troops squarely into the
path of a large Iraqi invasion force -- a force that the U.S.
believes is primed to strike at the vast Saudi oil fields
that fuel the West.
   Diplomatic sources say the decision to send jet fighters,
bombers and troops to Saudi Arabia and Turkey was made after
American intelligence detected ominous new Iraqi military
moves on the Saudi borders. These included the secret
deployment of dozens of Iraqi fighter aircraft to Yemen, on
the opposite side of Saudi Arabia, and Iraqi troop movements
in occupied Kuwait. To make the U.S. intervention more
palatable in the Moslem world, Egypt is believed to have
agreed to join the military effort and other nations may also
lend support.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The U.S. action risks putting American forces into a
potentially widespread conflict and brings President Bush to
the most dangerous and decisive hour of his young presidency.
But he enters this confrontation armed with unusually strong
domestic support and an unprecedented international consensus
that Iraq's march through the Persian Gulf must be halted.</p>
<p>In the hours before the deployment, a global embargo
ground Iraqi oil exports nearly to a halt. Turkey began
turning away ships seeking to load oil from Iraq's twin
pipeline through that country and said it would shut down the
line within a few days. In Moscow, a top Foreign Ministry
aide told The Wall Street Journal that the Soviet Union might
join a possible naval blockade of Iraqi oil exports.</p>
<p>In a major policy turnabout, King Fahd of Saudi Arabia
yesterday agreed to increase the kingdom's oil output to help
make up for world oil supplies lost to the embargo, senior
administration officials said. It was understood the Saudis
hadn't yet pledged to a specific figure, although the
administration has been seeking a commitment of increasing
production by about two million barrels a day. Also
yesterday, Venezuelan officials told Vice President Dan
Quayle that their country would pump oil beyond its OPEC
quota, according to an official traveling with the vice
president.</p>
<p>But the most significant breakthrough was Saudi Arabia's
agreement to harbor a large foreign military contingent
inside its kingdom. The Saudi royal family for more than a
decade has repeatedly rebuffed American pleas for access to
its large, modern air bases, for fear of inciting an
anti-American backlash both inside the kingdom and among its
Moslem neighbors.</p>
<p>But military intelligence supplied by the U.S. and the
threat posed by Iraq's forces along the Saudi border appear
to have swayed the royal family, as did the apparent
agreement of Egypt, a leader of the Islamic world, to
participate. Though the Egyptian Defense Ministry was saying
last night it hadn't sent any troops yet, Pentagon officials
said Defense Secretary Richard Cheney had obtained promises
that Egyptian troops would be dispatched in the next few
days. Mr. Bush scheduled a press conference for 9 a.m. EDT
today to discuss the situation in the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>Before the American deployment was disclosed, the White
House was already sounding warnings about Iraq's intentions
in the region. "We believe there is an imminent threat to
Saudi Arabia from the way that they {the Iraqi forces} are
positioned and located in Kuwait," presidential spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>The deployment, which was confirmed by Pentagon officials,
apparently has been in the works since Iraq's lightning
takeover of Kuwait last Thursday. But the administration
wasn't planning to announce the venture until today.
Officials expressed concern that leaks about the mission had
not only tipped off the Iraqis but might have rattled the
nervous Saudis.</p>
<p>The most immediate risk facing Mr. Bush involves the
vulnerability of an estimated 3,000 American civilians still
in Kuwait and 500 in Iraq itself -- including 39 Americans
bottled up in a Baghdad hotel. The State Department said
yesterday the 39 have been prevented from leaving the
building, although the U.S. officially doesn't yet consider
them hostages. As a precaution, Mr. Bush has sent
hostage-rescue commandos to the mideast, where they are on
stand-by.</p>
<p>According to government sources, the U.S. deployment plan
involves sending as many as 40,000 troops in phases,
including elements of the 82nd Airborne division and part of
a Marine division, to Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the
region. At least 80 U.S. fighters, including F-15s and F-16s,
would also be dispatched. Thirty-six FB-111 bombers have been
moved to Turkey, while a number of B-52s have been positioned
on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia.</p>
<p>They were to join two U.S. aircraft carrier task forces
converging on the Arabian Peninsula. The USS Eisenhower --
which has received the special permission of Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak to sail through the Suez Canal into
the Red Sea -- is carrying 80 combat aircraft. The
Independence, on station off the coast of Oman, is carrying a
similar number of planes.</p>
<p>The U.S. ground forces appear too small in number and too
lightly armed to be designed to roll back the 100,000 or so
armored troops that Iraq has massed on the Saudi border.
Rather, they are likely to be used mainly to deter an attack
on Saudi Arabia and help secure and defend the air bases
housing U.S. planes.</p>
<p>The plan to put American forces in the Middle East was a
key part of discussions Defense Secretary Cheney held Monday
in Saudi Arabia with King Fahd. It was during those talks
that the two men apparently agreed on the scope of U.S.
involvement.</p>
<p>Mr. Cheney has since been to Egypt, presumably to discuss
a role for that country in the force, and stopped in Morocco
on his way home last night. This morning, Secretary of State
James Baker is due to leave for NATO-member Turkey, another
nation whose bases appear to be part of the military noose
tightening around Iraq. Mr. Baker will then go to Brussels to
confer with NATO leaders.</p>
<p>Iraq's reported move to position planes in Yemen, Saudi
Arabia's neighbor to the south, was likely particularly
unsettling to Saudi Arabia, which has a history of tense
relations with the Yemenis. Ali Abdallah Salih, the president
of Yemen, has openly supported Iraq's Mr. Hussein, and the
Saudis may have sensed that they were facing hostile forces
both in Kuwait, to the north, and in Yemen, to the south.</p>
<p>Last night, the gravest danger for Saudi Arabia was the
possibility of an Iraqi invasion triggered by news reports of
the U.S. plan. Mr. Hussein, under growing international
economic pressure and facing the arrival of a large and
hostile military force near his borders, suddenly had reason
to strike first, U.S. officials feared.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush's "game plan was not to announce this until the
troops were there," one government official said last night.
"Because of the leak, the most dangerous time is right now."</p>
<p>Mr. Hussein himself delivered a threatening message
yesterday, rejecting foreign pressure on him to withdraw from
Kuwait and warning against any outside efforts to force him
out. "We would rather die than be humiliated, and we will
pluck out the eyes of those who attack the Arab nation,"
Baghdad Radio reportedly quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>The deployments to Saudi bases are part of a much larger
U.S.-led military effort designed both to prod the Iraqi
dictator away from Saudi Arabia and, potentially, to roll him
out of Kuwait. The plan also involves dispatching dozens of
warships -- probably including a few from Britain, France and
the USSR -- to stand off the gulf and off ports in Turkey and
Saudi Arabia through which Iraqi oil is shipped after
traveling through pipelines.</p>
<p>These vessels won't immediately block those points,
Pentagon officials said, but will be available to do so if
necessary. So far, a world-wide embargo on trade with Iraq,
imposed by the United Nations Monday, has slashed Iraqi oil
sales without a blockade.</p>
<p>It was the unusually forceful UN action that gave an
international legal and political umbrella for the U.S.
military move. Another key factor was the recent end of the
Cold War between the U.S. and the USSR, which led Moscow to
band together with the U.S. and which freed smaller nations
from worry about angering the Soviets by opposing Iraq, a
longtime Kremlin ally.</p>
<p>The first role of the U.S. forces being sent to the
Persian Gulf region is to deter the Iraqi leader, reducing
the temptation for him to sweep over the Saudi border and
down the west coast of the Persian Gulf, where Saudi oil
fields, oil processing facilities, terminals and
petrochemical operations are strung out.</p>
<p>"The combination of forces and having U.S. air power can
create a fundamental shift in Saddam Hussein's calculus,"
explains Frank Gaffney, director of Washington's Center for
Security Policy and a former Defense Department official.</p>
<p>Mr. Gaffney believes the U.S. must be prepared to take
combat losses and should be prepared to face an attack by
chemical weapons, which Mr. Hussein used against Iranian
forces in 1987. He is among a number of U.S. analysts who
believe that, short of a U.S. intervention, "it was a sure
thing" that Mr. Hussein, a man who has gambled on forceful
solutions all his life, would have sent his troops over the
Saudi border sooner or later.</p>
<p>If Mr. Hussein managed to destroy Saudi production
facilities, Mr. Gaffney asserts, it would further enrich
Iraq's position as the holder of the world's second largest
petroleum reserves. "What he's intent on doing is adding to
the value of his primary assets."</p>
<p>The first priority for U.S. forces if a shooting war does
break out is Mr. Hussein's air force, over 500 combat
aircraft, including a mixture of French Mirage F-1 and Soviet
MiG fighters and 16 Soviet Tupolev bombers. The Iraqi air
force, according to U.S. analysts, is primarily skilled in
air-to-ground missions, such as strafing and bombing.</p>
<p>By deploying some of those warplanes to Yemen, Mr. Hussein
may have hoped to hide them from such a U.S. attack. He used
similar scatter tactics to save his planes from destruction
during the eight-year war with Iran, which he initiated in
1980.</p>
<p>Iraq's arsenal of Soviet, Chinese and French-built
missiles must also be taken into account. Chemical-tipped
missiles, for example, could wreak havoc among U.S. troops
and oil workers in the desert, where 120-degree temperatures
would make wearing protective clothing and conducting
decontamination procedures extremely difficult.</p>
<p>To counter such threats, U.S. officials said, Patriot
missiles and other anti-missile systems would also be sent to
Saudi Arabia. Also to be dispatched were additional Airborne
Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft, which use
computers and powerful radar to direct fighters to their
targets.</p>
<p>If the Iraqi Air Force were destroyed, U.S. analysts said,
the matter of dealing with Mr. Hussein's tank-heavy ground
forces would be easier. In order to reach the oil fields his
tanks would have to traverse long desert roads and would
therefore be exposed.</p>
<p>Should Iraqi armored columns reach the oil fields, they
would have to be removed without damaging the fields -- a
delicate task, considering that the fields are dotted with
expensive terminals and processing plants.</p>
<p>Within 150 miles of the Kuwaiti border are two key Saudi
facilities, an $80 billion petrochemical complex at Jubail
and a huge oil-loading terminal and refinery complex at Ras
Tanura. An attack on either facility could have an enormous
impact on world markets. U.S., British, French and Soviet
naval forces operating in the Persian Gulf may also be called
into play to defend the two areas. As the planned deployment
unfolds, the force may assume a multinational character. In
addition to possible Egyptian forces, the U.S. and Saudi
Arabia would like Morocco to send troops. Other countries
could also be approached.</p>
<p>On Capitol Hill, reactions were generally positive. Rep.
Les Aspin, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee,
said sending troops makes "a lot of sense" because it gives
Saudi Arabia the protection it needs to pump additional oil
and make up part of the shortfall caused by the embargo.</p>
<p>"It is a serious business and it's a sign of our will,"
Sen. Robert Dole, the Kansas Republican, said after President
Bush telephoned him about the military move. "We hope Saddam
Hussein will get the message."</p>
<p>U.S. units have provisions to sustain themselves for
months in the Persian Gulf region. Pre-positioned ships
containing food, water, ammunition and heavy weapons are
stationed at Diego Garcia, which is outfitted for just such a
contingency. But while the U.S. has coveted a military
presence in the region for years, the White House will face
some political risk if great numbers of U.S. troops remain
stuck there for months.</p>
<p>For instance, even amid the support on Capitol Hill last
night, Sen. Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, reacted cautiously. He said it was "important"
that Saudi leaders had invited U.S. and other foreign allies
in to protect the kingdom, but that he hoped U.S. ground
forces would be used primarily in a defensive role, such as
guarding air bases and laying mines. He said he hoped, in
turn, that Arab forces, including soldiers from Egypt and
Morrocco, would be the troops used to reinforce the Saudi
infantry.</p>
