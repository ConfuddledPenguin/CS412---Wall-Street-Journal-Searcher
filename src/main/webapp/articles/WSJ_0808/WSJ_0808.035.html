	<p class="article-leader">President Bush's advisers have had plenty on their minds
as they devise options for dealing with Saddam Hussein.
Pentagon, national-security and intelligence officials have
the usual concerns about U.S. air, sea and ground power, but
today they have another burden. They must also consult their
lawyers to make sure they don't wind up in some criminal
courtroom.
   The idea of laws limiting our response to a lawless
Hussein figure may seem absurd, but the constraints are real.
More than a decade of congressional micromanagement of
foreign policy has produced volumes of rules limiting overt
and covert action. Although military strategists and their
government lawyers are understandably reluctant to discuss
hypotheticals, it's easy to imagine some of the legal
discussions of the past few days.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>All proposed military actions since 1973 have had to take
into account the ticking of the War Powers Resolution time
clock. This law limits deployment of forces into "imminent
hostilities" to 60 days. At the end of this period, Congress
must vote to affirm the action or the troops must come home.
Even if Congress supports initial deployment, legislators
might lose their enthusiasm over time. Military planners know
there is no guarantee they will be able to implement any
strategy that takes more than two months.</p>
<p>Government lawyers have no doubt reminded the military
that President Reagan's comparatively modest move of sending
the Navy to protect shipping in the Persian Gulf led to
congressional demands that he abide by War Powers Resolution
time limits. Mr. Hussein is canny enough to understand that
his strategy should also recognize the 60-day anniversary as
a make-or-break date for Congress.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court should and probably would declare the
War Powers Resolution unconstitutional as a fetter on the
implied powers of the president. Unfortunately, this requires
a test case. Mr. Hussein reportedly studied law for a time in
Cairo, but even so he's unlikely to offer Mr. Bush a
continuance while the Justice Department litigates the issue.</p>
<p>Requirements that the president let Congress know ahead of
time of covert activities are also probably unconstitutional;
the Federalist Papers stress that only the executive branch
has the "secrecy, energy and dispatch" to execute a
successful foreign policy. This week's apparent leaks of
covert actions against Mr. Hussein may be intentional or may
be the result of too many people knowing and talking.</p>
<p>Mr. Hussein's personality and appetite for territory have
been compared with Hitler's, but don't expect any U.S. role
in any plot to kill the Iraqi dictator. In 1976, President
Ford was faced with harsh congressional criticism of the CIA.
In order to avoid even more restrictive legislation, he
signed a prohibition against assassinations, which President
Reagan reissued in 1981.</p>
<p>Executive Order 12333 says that no one employed by the
U.S. or acting on its behalf "shall engage in, or conspire to
engage in, assassination." This prohibition was partly blamed
for the failed coup attempt against Manuel Noriega before he
was finally apprehended. Panamanian officers had been told by
U.S. officials that Americans could not be involved in
anything that looked like assassination. This may be one
reason coup plotters hesitated to use force against Mr.
Noriega when they had the chance.</p>
<p>Sen. William Cohen (R., Maine) said afterward that the
executive order was clearly at issue. "If, for example, the
rebel officers had every intent of killing Noriega during the
coup," he said, "then active support of these officers by
U.S. personnel might have resulted in charges of their
complicity in such assassination." Indeed, the understanding
had been that congressional interpretations of the ban on
assassinations required the executive branch to warn a
foreign head of state of any plan that might include his
death.</p>
<p>The Justice Department issued a new set of guidelines on
assassinations late last year. The new interpretation is
confidential, but apparently identifies an exception to the
rule. This is that the U.S. can aid a coup that results in
the death of a political leader, but only when the death is
not the express purpose of a coup. This nice distinction
between assassination and death as a byproduct of a coup
probably conforms to the ambiguous demands in the 1970s of
the congressional Church Committee. Its report called for a
ban on "targeted assassinations instigated by the U.S.," but
would "not today rule out support for dissident groups
seeking to overthrow tyrants."</p>
<p>Where there is no coup attempt, however, the broad wording
of the executive order probably prohibits any action that
would cause the death of Mr. Hussein. Lawyers could craft
arguments distinguishing between assassinations and killings.
They might argue that a free-falling bomb from thousands of
feet up is not the same as a single, targeted pistol shot.
Maybe the rule is that a massive air raid that also killed
many civilians is fine, but any surgical strike against Mr.
Hussein would be a violation.</p>
<p>As a matter of policy, it's a good idea to think twice
before sending poisoned chocolates to Mr. Hussein. Remember
the disastrous assassination of South Vietnam President Diem.
And a threatened Castro may have had something to do with the
murder of President Kennedy. The point here is that President
Bush should be free to choose his military strategy without
having to worry about legalities.</p>
<p>Officials have good reason to abide by even the most
ambiguous rules. Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh has shown
with his Iran-Contra prosecutions that even laws with no
criminal penalty can lead to criminal prosecutions. The War
Powers Resolution is not part of any criminal code, but
neither were the Boland amendments. The executive order
against assassinations is not even a law, but it would be no
surprise if an independent counsel some day invented the
crime of "conspiracy to violate an executive order."</p>
<p>There is something worse than effete about pretending that
the law can limit decisions on national security. It demeans
the law to try to force the circle of the rule of law into
the square of an international battlefield. International law
was outraged when Israel bombed the Iraqi nuclear plant in
1981, but no one complains now.</p>
<p>More broadly, Congress should reconsider its post-Vietnam
project of writing guidelines for the president on how
battles can and can't be fought. Times and circumstances
change in ways that rigid legal prohibitions can never
recognize. In times of crisis, the War Powers Resolution and
other supposedly legal constraints on the commander in chief
begin to look like silly, and dangerous gamesmanship.</p>
