	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Capital spending by Japanese corporations this
year will grow 16% from a year earlier, according to
responses by 4,296 companies in a survey by Japan's Economic
Planning Agency.
   The forecast represents a slowing of growth, following
year-to-year gains of 27% in 1989 and 22% in 1988, but it
would still mark the third consecutive year of double-digit
increases in capital spending outlays. The agency said it is
certain that growth in capital outlays for the year ending in
March will exceed 10%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The agency acknowledged that recent market instability,
following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, could hurt market
sentiment. But it said corporate investment for energy
conservation and new technologies is expected to remain
strong.</p>
