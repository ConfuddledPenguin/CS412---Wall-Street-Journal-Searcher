	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Federal Trade Commission issued a final
consent order under which the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants agreed not to restrict accountants from
accepting contingent fees and commissions from non-audit
clients.
   The governing council of the institute, the major
professional body for U.S. accountants, effectively had
lifted its ban on most such practices in May. But the
institute was awaiting a final FTC order before formally
changing its rules.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The institute had agreed in August 1988 to settle FTC
charges that its ban on contingent fees restrained
competition.</p>
<p>The institute has a membership of nearly 300,000 CPAs in
public practice, but its rules don't override state law or
the rules of state CPA societies.</p>
<p>An FTC complaint issued with the order charges the
institute illegally restrained competition and deprived
consumers of information about "the availability, price and
quality of CPA services." The order, issued on a 3-2 vote,
doesn't constitute an admission of a violation, but carries
the force of law regarding future actions.</p>
<p>Under the final order, the institute agreed not to
restrict CPAs from working for non-audit clients for
contingent fees, or accepting commissions, as long as the
CPAs disclose them to their clients. The institute also
agreed not to ban fees for referring clients to CPAs, or to
bar nondeceptive advertising. Disclosure of referral fees and
commissions on services and products also may be required.</p>
<p>Contingent fees are those in which accountants take an
engagement where the final fee is based on getting a benefit
for the client. Commissions are paid for services such as
advising a client to buy specific computer hardware, or
taking an audit or consulting job when the final fee is based
on the benefit derived by the client.</p>
<p>Under modifications by the commission, the order allows
the institute to prohibit CPAs from accepting contingent fees
for preparing tax returns. It also limits acceptance of the
fees and commissions to non-audit clients, and allows the
institute to prohibit CPAs from providing audit services to
clients where they have provided services for a contingent
fee or commission. The earlier proposal would have removed
restrictions on doing such work for audit clients.</p>
