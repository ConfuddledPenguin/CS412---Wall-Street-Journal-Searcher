	<p class="article-leader">Saga Petroleum AS said pretax profit more than doubled in
the first half and predicted pretax profit for all of 1990
would rise 29%.
   But the Norwegian oil concern's forecast assumes a
conservative 120 Norwegian kroner a barrel average price for
crude oil, roughly $18.50 a barrel at exchange rates
prevailing for most of the year, according to a Saga
spokesman. Industry analysts predicted that Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait would push Saga's average crude price higher,
probably to between $22 and $25 a barrel.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under that scenario, analysts added, Saga's 1990 pretax
profit would nearly triple, making the Oslo-based company one
of Europe's biggest winners from skyrocketing oil prices.</p>
<p>First-half pretax profit soared to 389 million kroner
($63.6 million) from 151 million kroner a year earlier.
Operating profit jumped to 494 million kroner from 394
million kroner. Expenses were halved, falling to 105 million
kroner from 243 million kroner a year earlier. Revenue rose
12.7% to 1.28 billion kroner.</p>
<p>Saga directors said they expect fullyear operating profit
to reach between 800 million kroner and 900 million kroner,
compared with 760 million kroner last year.</p>
