	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- The Bank of England said it plans to allow
Kuwait's massive investment arm to manage its holdings on a
normal basis, so long as assets inside the U.K. don't leave
the nation.
   Bank of England officials adopted this relatively flexible
approach as they set out rules governing Britain's freeze on
Iraq and Kuwait assets in the U.K. The freeze was imposed
after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, but the terms of the policy
weren't spelled out until yesterday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>British officials said that while assets of the
London-based Kuwait Investment Office are included in the
freeze, normal portfolio management should continue.</p>
<p>"We're working with the KIO to try to devise for them a
regime where they can operate their portfolio management as
freely as they choose so long as their assets don't leave
this jurisdiction," said one bank official. The main goal of
the asset-freeze is to keep the Iraqi government from seizing
control of the investment arm, whose holdings are estimated
at $100 billion.</p>
<p>The KIO has been a major player in world markets, owning
shares in dozens of British and Spanish companies, as well as
several West German concerns, including Hoechst AG and
Daimler-Benz AG.</p>
<p>Also included in Britain's asset-freeze is Kuwait
Petroleum Co. Bank of England said that consistent with the
goal of keeping these assets beyond the reach of the Iraqi
forces occupying Kuwait, local offices of the oil concern
would be able to carry on normal commerce.</p>
<p>The British freeze on assets covers both residents and
institutions from the two countries. Kuwaiti institutions can
draw on U.K. accounts to make pension and salary payments to
Kuwaiti citizens living in Britain.</p>
<p>The rules governing the freeze of Iraqi assets don't
provide for the same leeway. Bank of England officials noted
that Iraqi assets in the U.K. are far smaller than the
Kuwaiti assets. The Bank of England said it will consider
giving permission for withdrawals of Iraqi funds needed to
cover medical emergencies or travel costs of Iraqi citizens
wishing to return home.</p>
<p>The Bank of England estimated that British banks have
about $1 billion of claims on Iraq currently. The current
rules don't provide for Iraqi assets to be confiscated in
support of these claims. But bank officials said that in the
event of a default, "they would be subject to the normal
legal process."</p>
<p>The Bank of England has established a 10-person "emergency
unit" to administer the rules. Violations could be prosecuted
as criminal offenses.</p>
<p>The U.S., Japan and other major European nations have all
imposed their own freeze-orders on Kuwaiti and Iraqi assets.
Bank of England officials said there will be future efforts
to coordinate the procedures and regulations each country
adopts.</p>
<p>One problem, for example, is that the Bank of England
rules don't apply to foreign branches of U.K. banks. However,
officials said that U.K. banks won't be allowed to transfer
Kuwaiti assets to foreign branches. "We don't want this to
become a bypass," said a Bank of England official.</p>
