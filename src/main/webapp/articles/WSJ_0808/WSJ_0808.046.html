	<p class="article-leader">London -- God is the central character of David Hare's new
play, "Racing Demon," which is packing them in here at the
Royal National Theatre. It opens with a minister of the
Church of England chastising Him (or Her) for not speaking
up: "You see, I tell you, it's this perpetual absence -- yes?
-- this not being here -- it's that -- I mean, let's be
honest -- it's just beginning to get some of us down."
   But God, like that other central character Godot, never
appears and refuses to bless anyone or anything, even the
Church of England. And so the church is in chaos -- bishops,
vicars and curates bustling to and fro, desperately trying to
fill the void left by God's "perpetual absence."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Lionel Espy, the middle-aged vicar, believes that his best
service is to provide a sympathetic ear to the despair of his
impoverished parishioners, many of them Third World
transplants who don't know the difference between a vicar and
a curate and don't care.</p>
<p>Communion bores the Rev. Espy as much as it does his needy
parishioners. He prefers to administer weak sympathy to the
downtrodden while he awaits a clear message from God. As a
result, his bishop works to eject him from his inner-city
parish, saying: "As a priest, you only have one duty. That's
to put on a show."</p>
<p>Tony, just out of divinity school, wants -- like Christ --
to touch people, rather than just listen. He burns with
desire to rekindle the flame, march at the head of the
Christian soldiers, punch out the wife-abusers, fill the
empty pews, sponsor Billy Graham's crusade, bring the
supernatural back into the church. Espy, he believes, is a
fuddy-duddy and so conspires with the bishop to have him
removed as vicar.</p>
<p>Harry is the aging, homosexual priest who can't leave the
closet because "If I do something that in any sense is
worrying . . . if I upset my communicants in any way, then
the focus is moved. From the Lord Jesus. On to his minister."
Which leaves little room for tending his personal life. He
remembers but "one single moment of unbelievable happiness"
during his three years at Cambridge. The one time he kissed a
man. "Lord, you know I don't expect more."</p>
<p>Then there's Streaky, the happy priest who loves the job.
In his former parish in the country, bliss was "Matins, a
sung Eucharist, two Evensongs and `Iolanthe' five nights a
week." In London's Jamaican slums, it's "the rum and the
curried goat. . . . The whole thing's so simple, so
infinitely loving. Why do people find it so hard?"</p>
<p>Playwright Hare effectively lays bare the church's
problems as it struggles with declining attendance, political
conflict, and economic imperatives. But his interest in the
current plight of the Church of England has not resulted in a
mere tract. "Racing Demon" is compelling, witty and superbly
mounted by director Richard Eyre, who demonstrates with sharp
and simple staging why he was chosen to succeed Lord Olivier
and Sir Peter Hall as director of the Royal National.</p>
<p>The action occurs on a simple, cruciform set designed by
Bob Crowley and lighted by Mark Henderson. It serves equally
well as church, rectory and the bar of the Savoy Hotel, where
friendly priests plan Espy's defense while they get high on
Tequila Sunrises with cherries and umbrellas.</p>
<p>Played with enormous sympathy by Oliver Ford Davies, the
Rev. Lionel Espy listens so carefully to the people who seek
his ear that he fails to hear his wife's crying need for
human love and attention. Adam Kotz offers us hints of Elmer
Gantry and Ayatollah Khomeini in his portrayal of the Rev.
Tony Ferris who crusades against the wife-abusing Jamaican
but deceives and deserts his own mistress. The veteran actor
Michael Bryant is painfully touching as the wry, wily and
frightened Rev. Harry Henderson, who washes his hands of his
male lover's needs, fearing exposure, which comes anyhow.
David Bamber is a delight as the Rev. Donald "Streaky" Bacon,
the happy priest. The only false note in Mr. Hare's play is
struck by Tony's secular mistress, Frances Parnell. Stella
Gonet does all she can with the part, but it stretches belief
that a beautiful, well-educated and principled woman would
throw herself at the zealot Tony and then turn the head of
the Rev. Espy while his wife lies ill with a stroke in the
next room. Some might argue that Mr. Hare needed to season
all his pious interplay with a bit of sex. What he really
needed, though, was a commentator outside the church, who
might more realistically have been Espy's wife, Heather. In
its current form, hers is a small but affecting role,
beautifully played by Barbara Leigh-Hunt.</p>
<p>But however well-acted and staged this play was, I found
myself wondering how it would go over with American
audiences. God seems to succeed on the American stage and
screen only when he plays straight man to the evil, as in
Arthur Miller's "The Crucible"; when his Son gets into steamy
situations, as in Martin Scorsese's "The Last Temptation of
Christ"; or when he is incarnated as the warm, cuddly and
wholly accessible George Burns in "Oh, God." Unlike our
English cousins, we have little patience for debates on His
presence or absence, and no predisposition to watch a band of
well-meaning men try to chart the right course for His
church. But over there it's not simply His church, but Her
church as well, Elizabeth II's. The Church of England, like
the Royal Family (and the Royal National Theatre), is part of
the British establishment. Even today, many Brits -- even
those who couldn't tell a synod from a sin -- look to the
Church of England for a sense of order, of decency, of faith,
just as they look to the Royal Family for vague assurance
that their values and traditions have not been wholly lost.
We disestablished all of that. Since we are not privy to a
common faith, we can't question whether it still pertains.
All to the good, of course, but it's uplifting on occasion to
see a fine piece of work that assumes common knowledge about
a common faith, and can then proceed to question that faith.
We will no doubt continue to receive from the mother country
dancing cats who sing T.S. Eliot poetry, phantoms who stalk
elaborate sets, and other easily deciphered entertainments.
But don't hold your breath until "Racing Demon" and its like
are imported or created in the U.S.</p>
