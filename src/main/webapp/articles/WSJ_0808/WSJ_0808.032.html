	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Standard & Poor's Corp. said it will add Pep
Boys Manny, Moe & Jack, a Philadelphia-based retailer of
automotive parts and accessories, to its stock index of 500
companies.
   S&P said General Instrument Corp., a New York
communications equipment and electronic components
manufacturer, will be deleted from the list because it is
being acquired by Forstmann Little & Co. The change will
occur at the close of trading Monday, S&P said.</p>
