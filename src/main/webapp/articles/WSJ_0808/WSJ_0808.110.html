	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- It is small wonder that Wall Street is gaga
about oil-service stocks.
   The smart money has always said that the place to be in a
gold rush is selling shovels, and Wall Street hasn't wasted
any time in figuring out who is selling shovels now.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Historically, oil-service stocks have been the leveraged
beneficiary of oil prices," says Daniel Rice, who manages the
MetLife-State Street Energy Fund. Leverage is greatest at the
margins of any industry -- and oil service, a byproduct of
growth, occurs at the margin of the oil business.</p>
<p>Currently, the market capitalization of the entire
oil-service industry is less than that of Merck. This
suggests, to some, a fleeting opportunity. In Mr. Rice's
enthusiastic imagery: "When portfolio managers decide they
want to get in this industry, the door will get very small."</p>
<p>There is no argument here that shares of Schlumberger,
Halliburton and Baker Hughes, to name a few, would all be
attractive at 10 times earnings. And maybe, even, at 20 times
earnings.</p>
<p>But no one is offering to make that trade. These stocks,
as do those of many oil-service concerns, trade at about 30
times estimated 1990 earnings. Multiples of 1991 earnings are
closer to 20.</p>
<p>It is only when one goes out to 1993 or 1994 that
multiples appear reasonable. And who is going to predict what
international oil markets will look like in 1994?</p>
<p>This is not to say that oil-service stocks are necessarily
overpriced -- only that they are discounting a lot of good
news.</p>
<p>Mr. Rice, for example, argues that when the level of
drilling in the U.S. rises to 1,500 rigs, Halliburton's
earnings should soar to $5 a share (from a 1990 consensus
estimate of $1.87). At that level, its stock would indeed be
reasonable.</p>
<p>But 1,500 rigs represent 55% more than the total now in
service. Analysts say the industry has contracted so much
since the previous boom that it lacks the capacity in many
areas to grow quickly, and such a rise in the number of rigs
would also require a huge leap of faith by oil companies.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch predicts that Schlumberger, in 1994 or so,
should earn $10 to $12 a share (up from a consensus estimate
of $2.38 for 1990). Suzanne Cook, a Merrill analyst, says,
"There has been such a consolidation in oil-service that
companies have more pricing power than is readily apparent."</p>
<p>For example, she says, "Schlumberger is the only game in
town" for high-technology well-testing. Thus, she predicts
rising revenues and rising margins across much, if not most,
of the oil-service industry.</p>
<p>Margins and revenues may indeed rise. Mark Baskir, who
invests in energy stocks for Neuberger Berman and who is
neutral on oil-service stocks, says the problem is this: "How
much is the stock market already discounting?"</p>
<p>James Carroll, an analyst at PaineWebber, says that for
each $1 increase in the estimated future price of a barrel of
oil, the intrinsic value of oil-service companies, as
measured by a discounted cash flow model, rises 8%. And based
on the current price of West Texas intermediate crude of
about $28 a barrel, he says oil-service stocks are fairly
priced. He says, "There is a lot of leverage" on the upside
if oil prices rise.</p>
<p>But the price of a barrel of oil has already risen to
something like the price of a high-priced steak dinner. Until
a week ago, the price was barely enough for a large pizza,
maybe with a few extra toppings. In short, most analysts say
oil's price is as likely to drop back as it is to rise
further.</p>
<p>And uncertainty works against the oil-service investor,
because oil companies require a measure of certainty before
they commit large sums of capital.</p>
<p>"These {oil-service} stocks are ridiculously valued," Alan
Gaines, president of Gaines & Berland, an institutional
brokerage firm, says. Mr. Gaines is hardly disinterested; he
has sold short a laundry list of stocks, betting their prices
will drop. His argument is that "oil companies don't budget
on the basis of one week's events in the Middle East."</p>
<p>Mr. Gaines is right -- but only partly.</p>
<p>"We have been through these cycles before," Will Price,
president of Chevron's Chevron USA unit, says. "You have the
suspicion that things will moderate." Chevron makes no
flat-out predictions, though the general sense from Mr. Price
is that -- partly because of restrictions on drilling --
exploration will increase, but only gradually.</p>
<p>The current price of oil "pretty much hits the bull's eye"
in terms of what oil companies need to drill, Theodore Eck,
chief economist of Amoco, says. "The question is, can we stay
there?"</p>
<p>There is little question that drilling will increase. But
is Wall Street, recalling the last oil boom when the rig
count soared to 4,000, counting on too much, too soon? Oil
men also remember the oil boom -- and the nearly decadelong
slump that followed.</p>
<p>Thus, they say that oil at $25 to $30 a barrel will
sustain a lot of drilling, but that the industry isn't likely
to plunge in as it did in the 1970s, when long lines at
gasoline stations were fresh news. "This time feels
different," Mr. Eck says. "There isn't a sense of panic."</p>
