	<p class="article-leader">British Airways PLC reported that pretax profit for the
first quarter ended June 30 rose 62% to #156 million ($291.9
million) from #96 million a year earlier, despite a slower
rise in sales and the strong pound's adverse effect on the
carrier's international earnings.
   The results were well above market expectations for pretax
profit of #135 million. Profit after taxes, or that
attributable to shareholders, increased 79% to #111 million
from #62 million. Per-share earnings on a fully diluted basis
rose 54% to 12.9 pence from 8.4 pence. Operating profit eased
0.8% to #123 million from #124 million. Pretax earnings were
enhanced by net of #50 million in income from interest and
asset disposals, compared with a year-earlier net loss of #1
million.</p>
