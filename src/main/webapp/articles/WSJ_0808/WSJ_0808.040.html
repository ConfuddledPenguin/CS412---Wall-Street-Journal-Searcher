	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Stung by nine months of disappointing earnings
-- including a startling first-quarter loss -- American
Airlines is taking a bite out of budgets up and down the
company.
   The airline, the main unit of Fort Worth-based AMR Corp.,
is curbing overtime, freezing hiring and taking a tough stand
in contract negotiations with its pilots. Chairman and
cost-cutter extraordinaire Robert L. Crandall has even
personally distributed a memo admonishing employees to turn
off lights after quitting time and not to photocopy
little-league schedules at the office.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It's a re-examination of everything we spend money on,"
acknowledges Michael J. Durham, chief financial officer and
senior vice president of finance. He and other senior
executives have been attending regular cost-cutting meetings
with Mr. Crandall since early July. Their goal: to wring $100
million a year out of day-to-day operations, an AMR spokesman
says.</p>
<p>AMR's profit squeeze isn't entirely of its own making. The
industry's boom times of 1988 and early 1989 -- which saw
American dash to the head of the pack with more than $10
billion in annual revenue -- screeched to a halt late last
year when jet-fuel prices soared unexpectedly at the same
time traffic began to slow. The current crisis in the Middle
East is forcing fuel prices even higher, with serious
implications for all carriers.</p>
<p>"This hasn't been a brilliant six months in the airline
business, and it hasn't been a brilliant six months at
American Airlines," concedes Donald Carty, executive vice
president.</p>
<p>But American has some unique problems. Traffic turned
sluggish just as it was halfway through an aggressive and
costly expansion. It is committed to $20 billion in capital
spending by 1995 for new planes and ground facilities. It
just spent more than $600 million to add Latin American and
European routes, and is fighting to secure more Pacific
routes, although a Transportation Department administrative
law judge recently recommended against American's bid for the
two most lucrative routes. The judge's decision still can be
overturned, but American said failure to secure the
Chicago-Tokyo and Los Angeles-Nagoya routes "will have a
profoundly adverse impact on our company." If it ultimately
wins the new Pacific routes, American is prepared to quickly
purchase two new wide-body jets for $330 million.</p>
<p>AMR insists its penny-pinching isn't linked to its
burgeoning debt. "It's linked to the fact that we're not
making a lot of money," Mr. Durham says. Indeed, as the
nation's biggest, richest airline, American is far from
financial difficulty. Its debt-to-equity ratio of 0.7-to-1 is
well below rivals', and while second-quarter profits fell
25%, they at least reversed the first-quarter flow of red
ink.</p>
<p>One noticeable area where AMR hasn't had stellar
performance is in its stock price, which has fallen over the
past 12 months from $107.25 to yesterday's closing price of
$50.375, unchanged, in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. AMR is doing no worse than most of its airline
rivals, however. All airline stocks took a tumble last fall
when the first UAL Inc. buy-out effort fell through.
Uncertainty about the current proposed buy-out may be
affecting airline stocks as well.</p>
<p>So far, cuts seem to be an extension of American's
turn-on-a-dime philosophy, in which spending grows with
profits, and programs or routes falling below projections are
summarily axed. The question, says Mr. Durham, is "are we
getting enough bang for our buck given that revenue is not
satisfactory?"</p>
<p>The attack on expenses is relentless. The airline has
imposed a hiring freeze on management and clerical personnel.
It is re-evaluating whether to continue publishing a dozen or
so divisional newspapers. "Maybe we can't afford them this
year," Mr. Durham says. Even now, it is poring over flight
schedules, city by city, nipping and tucking arrivals and
departures to minimize labor and other costs.</p>
<p>At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, the nation's
busiest, American is reversing flight changes made just last
November to improve on-time performance. At the time,
American fanned out departures over several hours to spread
labor costs and avoid delays, instead of crowding flights
into peak periods. It found, however, that passengers chose
other airlines that continued to leave at peak times. And
American's on-time statistics didn't improve much either. So
American is reverting to its original peak-time departures.
"Bad plan," groans Mr. Durham.</p>
<p>As American wields the knife, passengers may get nicked.
The airline is taking back some of the leeway previously
granted its airport employees to hand out travel vouchers to
disgruntled passengers. The projected savings: $50 million to
$60 million a year. "The cost of vouchers went through the
ceiling, and we weren't really improving the quality of our
product," Mr. Durham says. Though stingier, the new policy is
still very generous, Mr. Durham maintains.</p>
<p>American also is leaning on employee labor costs.</p>
<p>Back in the early 1980s, weakened by fare wars, limited
routes, old equipment and huge fuel bills, American pioneered
a two-tier wage scale. Under the scheme, new hires moved
along a separate, lower "B" pay scale than senior workers.
That greatly reduced overall labor costs, because American
was hiring new people in droves as it pursued a bold
expansion. The idea paid off: from the signing of contracts
in 1983 until last year, profits soared.</p>
<p>Now American's more than 8,400 pilots, in contract
bargaining, say it is payback time. "We want an
industry-leading pay scale," declares Fred Vogel, president
of the Associated Pilots of America union. That means
bringing the 57% of pilots who are B-scalers up to parity
with their senior counterparts in wages, pension and
vacation, he says.</p>
<p>No way, American counters; continued growth will provide
more money and promotions for pilots. It contends its most
recent contract offer would already raise its labor costs by
about $600 million over five years without granting B-scalers
parity. AMR argues that the wholesale change sought could
make its expansion sputter and wants to bring junior pilots
to parity slowly, not immediately. It also wants pilots to
accept more flexible medical benefits, which shift more of
the costs to them.</p>
<p>In a videotape mailed to pilots not long ago, Mr. Crandall
said the airline has "an obligation not to sign a contract
which we think will cripple the company's future." The pilots
responded last month by replacing their negotiating team with
one expected to be tougher. Talks, supervised by a federal
mediator, resume next week between the company and the new
team.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, American is entering the last, most costly
years of its growth plan. It expects capital spending to
average $4 billion a year until 1995. This year alone,
American will take on about $1 billion in leveraged leases on
new aircraft, shell out another $1 billion for new
facilities, sign up for $800 million in unsecured debt and
borrow another $800 million short-term. The 1991 spending and
debt schedule looks much the same, gradually easing in later
years as fewer planes are delivered and facilities are
completed.</p>
<p>Despite the cost squeeze, American intends to steady its
course. "Unless the world crashes in on us from a
profitability view, we would continue to execute the {growth}
plan," says Mr. Carty.</p>
