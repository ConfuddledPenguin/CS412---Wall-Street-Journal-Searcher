	<p class="article-leader">The push within the airline industry to raise fares
because of rising oil prices might pass its biggest hurdle as
early as today.
   Industry people said they expect AMR Corp.'s American
Airlines to announce that it plans to raise ticket prices by
10% in the near future. The move is important because the
momentum for a fuel-related fare rise probably would die
without the acquiescence of the powerful Dallas-based
carrier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>An American spokesman wouldn't comment on the reports, but
said the carrier plans to make a fare-related announcement
early today.</p>
<p>In recent days, Pan American World Airways and Northwest
Airlines have released plans to raise their fares because of
a surge in the price of aviation fuel: one of the biggest
expenses of an airline. The Pan Am Corp. unit plans a 10%
domestic fare increase effective tomorrow. The same day, NWA
Inc.'s Northwest plans to institute an $8 ticket fuel
surcharge on a one-way basis.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Trans World Airlines said it plans to implement
a $20 fuel surcharge on trans-Atlantic fares on a one-way
basis, Aug. 15. Pan Am plans to raise international fares 10%
effective that same day.</p>
<p>The airlines are trying to compensate for price increases
in aviation fuel that have occurred since Iraq invaded
oil-rich Kuwait. TWA said its fuel costs have already risen
33%.</p>
<p>It isn't clear whether the fare rises will fly with
consumers.</p>
<p>The carriers are trying to implement the fare increases at
a time when traffic has been unusually soft. Traffic will
also deteriorate with the approach of fall, when vacation
travel evaporates and carriers often must resort to discount
fares.</p>
<p>"With the climate the way it is, it's obviously not a good
time to push through a fare increase," said Cornish
Hitchcock, legal director at the Aviation Consumer Action
Project.</p>
<p>But the airline industry has little alternative. Fuel
costs account for about 15% to 20% of an airline's operating
expenses.</p>
<p>One airline consulting firm projected yesterday that
$25-a-barrel oil over a period of just a few months would
result in one of the biggest hemorrhages of red ink for the
airline industry since it was deregulated in 1978.</p>
<p>The firm, Washington, D.C.-based Airline Economics Inc.,
scrapped its projection that the industry would generate a
$400 million to $500 million profit this year. It said it now
expects the industry to post a $1 billion operating loss in
1990.</p>
<p>Last year, the industry had an operating profit of $1.8
billion, according to Airline Economics. Its best year since
deregulation was 1988 with an operating profit of $3.4
billion.</p>
<p>The proposed fare increases would raise prices
significantly. For example, under Pan Am's plan the cheapest
round-trip fare between New York and Miami would increase to
$216 from $196. American is expected to follow suit. In
Northwest's proposal, the fare would increase to $212.</p>
<p>"I think it's horrible," says JoAnn Alesci, manager at the
Travel Bug Inc. in Cleveland. "I've had people just sit in
here and just be astonished at the prices everywhere."</p>
<p>If the planned fare increases go into effect, it would be
the second time this year that the airlines have instituted
boosts as a result of rising fuel costs.</p>
