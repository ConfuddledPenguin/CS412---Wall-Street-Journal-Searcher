	<p class="article-leader">While the peak of the Iraqi crisis may yet lie ahead, it
carries opportunity as well as risk. Indeed, if President
Bush wins, he will emerge with his hand strengthened on a
wide range of important matters.
   International Security Arrangements. Working the phones,
Mr. Bush in a matter of days has moved the issue of post-Cold
War security from the level of abstraction to concrete
action. He has thrown an economic and military noose around
Saddam Hussein, and is now drawing it tighter, with his
deployment of large U.S. forces to Saudi Arabia as the latest
and most dramatic step.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The deployment means Mr. Bush has lined up Saudi Arabia as
well as Egypt and other nations to protect Saudi oil fields.
Turkey has honored its side of the NATO agreement by banning
the loading of tankers with oil from the Iraqi pipeline, and
by providing a base for U.S. F-111s within striking distance
of Iraqi targets. A French destroyer was sailing through the
Suez, and two U.S. aircraft carriers were positioned at the
mouth of the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush's blockade, in short, has already isolated Iraq.
Saddam Hussein is perfectly capable of further rashness with
his huge army and chemical weapons, and as the noose tightens
may strike out in blood. Yet it now seems possible to
speculate that in the end he could find himself evicted from
not only Kuwait but Iraq itself. If so, it would be a lesson
to all the world's bullies and potential bullies.</p>
<p>And a lesson, too, about the discussion of "bringing
American troops home" now that the Cold War has thawed. The
embarrassing pre-Saddam votes in the Democratic-controlled
Congress to gut the Defense budget need to be revisited,
along with such issues as how to honor our side of the NATO
bargain with Turkey. Those of us who have been skeptics about
the United Nations may need to take another look if events
consolidate the kind of big-power cooperation its
institutional design assumed. Should Mr. Bush succeed against
Iraq, he will have earned the stature, both domestically and
diplomatically, to lead a large reordering of international
security.</p>
<p>The Myth of American Decline. Since Vietnam, an entire
school of academics and their Wall Street admirers has grown
up around the notion that the American Century is at an end.
If the Bush exercise in American leadership evident the past
several days succeeds, the decline school will belong in
whatever basement now houses Eastern Europe's faculties of
Marxist economics.</p>
<p>The International Economy. As a logical extension of those
discussions, Mr. Bush could be expected to provide some
vision, largely missing at this juncture, of the future shape
of the international economy. If the united front of nations
that Mr. Bush has assembled to preserve the global economy
emerges victorious, its next task ought to be needed
institutional reforms for peacetime. The policy discussion
around such matters as destructive agricultural subsidies or
international monetary arrangements has been drifting or
neglected altogether, and is scarcely less dangerous than a
jump in oil prices.</p>
<p>Presidential Authority. As a Washington insider, George
Bush has also been an on-site witness to the entire period of
decline in presidential authority. The nearby Rule of Law
column discusses such artifacts of that decline as the War
Powers Resolution (See "Rule of Law: What if We Had a War and
No One Invited the Lawyers?" -- WSJ August 8, 1990). We would
add to that the Budget Reform Act, which tipped spending in
Congress's favor and into its current abyss. Mr. Bush has
been looking for the right moment to enhance presidential
authority, restoring a proper balance with congressional
powers in domestic and foreign affairs. With success in the
Gulf, that moment would have arrived.</p>
<p>Indeed the Iraq crisis has the potential to make clear
that a vigorous U.S. presidency is an inevitable necessity of
a functional political system, at home and abroad. Its
powers, if deftly used, can be one of history's most
effective forces for positive good.</p>
