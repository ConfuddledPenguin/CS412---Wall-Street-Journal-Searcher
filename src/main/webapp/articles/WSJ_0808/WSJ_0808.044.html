	<p class="article-leader">JERUSALEM -- An Israeli lieutenant colonel runs his finger
along a map of the Middle East and shrugs. "So Saddam is
crazy, what else is new?" he says. "The Saudis and Americans
are losing a lot more sleep over this one than we are."
   As a U.S. force steams toward the Persian Gulf and global
sanctions start pinching Iraq, Israel finds itself in the
unfamiliar position of watching a Middle East crisis from the
sidelines. Israel is deliberately keeping a low profile,
knowing that any visible Israeli role would inspire Arab
reaction.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Few Israelis fear that fighting in the gulf could make
Israel a target for Iraqi missiles. "Israel is not Kuwait,"
says Avi Pazner, a senior adviser to Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir. This and similar comments by Israeli officials
suggest that Israel would retaliate massively against an
Iraqi attack.</p>
<p>Israel's right wing has greeted the gulf crisis with grim
satisfaction. Officials believe that the crisis has reminded
the world of the threat facing Israel and that it is likely
to silence talk in the U.S. of cutting aid. The attack also
split the Arab world and diverted attention from the
Palestinian situation at a time when Israel faces strong U.S.
criticism.</p>
<p>"Arab hawks have once again come to the rescue of hawks in
Israel," says Abba Eban, a former foreign minister and
longtime advocate of peace talks. Adds Gerald Steinberg, a
strategic analyst at Hebrew University: "The idea that a
solution to the Palestinian problem will bring peace has been
blown out of the water."</p>
<p>If the short-term effect of Iraq's action is to take the
heat off Israel, the long-term impact is more worrisome to
Israelis. Mr. Steinberg says the crisis has forced Israel to
think more seriously about pre-emptive attacks on Iraq, like
the air strike it launched on an Iraqi nuclear facility in
1981. "Saddam's audacity in Kuwait shows he's willing to risk
thousands of Iraqi lives," Mr. Steinberg says. "If we're not
dealing with a rational leader, then deterrence isn't
enough."</p>
<p>Military analysts say Iraqi installations remain
vulnerable because of poor air defense. But Iraq now has a
deterrent of its own, missiles that can carry chemical
warheads. While analysts say Iraqi missiles are too few and
too inaccurate to "scorch half of Israel," as Mr. Hussein has
threatened, Iraq could inflict hundreds of casualties if a
missile hit Tel Aviv. In April Mr. Hussein moved missiles to
a site near the Jordanian border, within easy range of
Israel.</p>
<p>If Mr. Hussein remains bellicose, analysts say Israel may
make its own deterrent powers more obvious, perhaps with an
overt nuclear test. Israel and the U.S. are jointly
developing a missile defense system called Arrow.</p>
<p>Israel is planning to begin distributing gas masks to
every citizen, but there has been no panic or military
call-up.</p>
<p>Israeli officials say the U.S. hasn't asked for military
assistance, and they don't expect such a call, except as a
last resort. The U.S. has signaled this by sending emissaries
to Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Egypt while canceling a scheduled
visit to Washington by Israel's foreign minister, David Levy.</p>
<p>However, deputy foreign minister Benjamin Netanyahu says,
"If we are asked, we will respond." He adds that one impetus
for Mr. Hussein's attack may have been the perception that
the "Israeli-U.S. alliance wasn't as healthy as it once was.
Appearances count." Asked if this meant Israel would be
asking the U.S. for increased aid, he said, "clearly a weak
Israel invites Iraqi aggression."</p>
<p>Iraq's action also has focused Israeli attention on
Jordan, which has backed Mr. Hussein. Defense Minister Moshe
Arens told parliament "the moment we see that we are facing a
change like the entrance of the Iraqi army into Jordan, we
will act."</p>
<p>"Jordan could become the killing field of the next
Arab-Israeli war," says Hirsh Goodman, a newspaper editor and
defense analyst. Another red flag for Israel would be an
acceleration of Iraq's nuclear program, believed to be five
years from deployment.</p>
<p>Iraq's action has hardened Israel's stance toward
Palestinians. With Yasser Arafat, leader of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, in the Iraqi camp, the moribund
"peace process" seems dead. Heightened tension was evident
when the discovery of two murdered Israeli teen-agers in
Jerusalem provoked anti-Arab violence, with Israelis stoning
Arabs and smashing their cars.</p>
<p>On his way to work Wednesday, Mr. Goodman stopped for a
haircut. The chat in the crowded barber shop alarmed but
didn't surprise him. "People now think Arabs just want to
drink blood," he says. "The last week has confirmed the view
that all Arabs understand is force."</p>
<p>For their part, many Palestinians have embraced what one
intellectual calls "a deep political nihilism." If dialogue
is dead, the reasoning goes, then a shock to the system is
better than stalemate, even if it is Kuwait that suffers.</p>
<p>Dishing up falafel on a cobbled street of Jerusalem's Arab
quarter, Mahmoud Abu Dalou watches warily as Israeli patrols
make their way through the souk, toppling Arab fruit stands
with the butts of their rifles. "We have nothing more to
lose," Mr. Abu Dalou says. "The world has abandoned us. Maybe
Saddam will wake everyone up." The intifada, or Palestinian
uprising, didn't flare after Iraq's invasion.</p>
<p>The losers for now are the dwindling ranks of moderates on
both sides. Palestinians blame emerging Arab radicalism on
the U.S.'s failure to pressure Israel. Says Sa'eb Erakat, a
political scientist: "America has taken the peace process out
of the hands of Hosni Mubarak and handed it to Saddam."</p>
<p>Mr. Eban says the Iraqi action has relieved pressure on
Israel to "stop arguing Talmudic points" about Palestinian
representation and get on with peace talks. But he thinks
it's "light-headed" to suppose Israel will be off the hook
for long.</p>
<p>"If the U.S. takes effective action against Iraq, its
general posture will be strict," he says. And if united world
action succeeds in restraining Iraq, the same concerted
pressure could eventually be brought to bear on Israel.</p>
