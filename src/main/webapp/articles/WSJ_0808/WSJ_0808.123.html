	<p class="article-leader">Syntro Corp. said it and Upjohn Co. resolved a legal
dispute over patent rights to a swine vaccine. With the cost
of that litigation eliminated, Syntro, a start-up
biotechnology company with a history of losses, said it
expects break-even results for the year ending Oct. 31.
   Upjohn sued Syntro in March 1989 in Delaware and Kansas,
charging that a swine vaccine sold by a Syntro animal health
subsidiary infringed on an Upjohn patent. Syntro countersued
in Delaware.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the agreement, the companies will recognize each
other's patents by paying royalties to each other. Of the $25
million world-wide market for the swine vaccine, Syntro said
it has a 40% share, while Upjohn has about 1%. Lenexa,
Kan.-based Syntro said the settlement would not affect market
share or the ability of either company to compete.</p>
<p>An executive of Kalamazoo, Mich.-based Upjohn said, "This
settlement provides further recognition of our scientific
efforts."</p>
<p>For the nine months ended June 30, Syntro posted a loss of
$1.2 million on revenue of $2.5 million.</p>

<p>A SYNTRO CORP. EXECUTIVE, clarifying statements he made in
yesterday's edition, said the company expects to be operating
at a break-even level Sept. 30, the end of its fiscal year,
but still expects to report a net loss for the year. Further,
he said the company has a 40% share of the U.S. market for
its swine vaccine. Also, the company had a $1.6 million loss
for the nine months ended June 30. The amount of the loss was
misstated in yesterday's edition.</p>
