	<p class="article-leader">PASADENA, Calif. -- Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. said a
unit received a $15.6 million contract from Glendale Memorial
Hospital Health Center to build an addition to the Glendale,
Calif., medical center.
   The 130,000 square-foot addition will include surgical
suites, an emergency treatment center and X-ray facilities,
Jacobs said. The project, awarded to Jacobs's Robert E. McKee
Inc. unit, is set for completion in early 1992.</p>
