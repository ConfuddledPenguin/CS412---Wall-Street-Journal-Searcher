	<p class="article-leader">SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- First Federal Savings Bank,
Puerto Rico, said two senior officers -- Arturo J. Somohano
and Fernando Ochoa -- resigned as a result of flaws noted in
a recent audit by the Office of Thrift Supervision.
   The thrift said Angel Alvarez, executive vice president
and general counsel, will assume Mr. Somohano's duties as
senior executive vice president and chief operating officer.
Jorge R. Rodriguez, vice president and investment manager,
will succeed Mr. Ochoa on an interim basis as senior vice
president for investments.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>After the audit, First Federal made a special provision
for loan losses of $16.7 million for the second quarter.</p>
<p>"In neither case was it a conflict of interest or
malfeasance," Annie Astor de Carbonell, executive vice
president and chief financial officer, said of the
resignations. "It was mostly a result of lack of proper
administration and management on their part."</p>
<p>Messrs. Somohano and Ochoa couldn't be reached for
comment.</p>
