	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Quaker Oats Co., citing rising marketing costs,
said it expects to report lower earnings from continuing
operations for the fiscal first quarter ending Sept. 30.
   The grocery-products company said profit will be lower
than the 49 cents a share in the year-earlier quarter, partly
because Quaker plans to beef up European marketing of its
star product, Gatorade. Results in the year-earlier quarter
also were boosted by unusually strong results in Brazil, a
spokesman said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the fourth quarter ended June 30, the company posted
net income of $66.3 million, or 86 cents a share, consisting
of a profit from continuing operations of $100.7 million, or
$1.31 a share, and a loss from discontinued operations of
$34.4 million, or 45 cents a share. The loss from
discontinued operations, from its Fisher-Price toy business,
was twice as high as the company had predicted.</p>
<p>Fourth-quarter sales rose 4% to $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>In the fourth quarter ended June 30, 1989, Quaker had net
from continuing operations of $40.8 million, or 52 cents a
share. Net from discontinued operations of $15.7 million, or
19 cents a share, made net income $56.5 million, or 71 cents
a share.</p>
<p>Quaker took a $59.9 million loss on the discontinued toy
unit in fiscal 1990. It hopes to spin off the unit as a
separate company to shareholders by early next year.</p>
<p>Officials said fiscal 1990 results came in "below
expectations" because of sluggish sales in its U.S. grocery
business. Domestic grocery-product sales were flat at $3.6
billion.</p>
<p>The company blamed intense competition in its domestic
cereal and pet food lines, cool weather last summer which
impeded Gatorade sales, and a sudden drop in demand for
oat-bran products. Unit volume fell 6% as declines in its pet
foods, hot and ready-to-eat cereals, and Golden Grain lines
offset gains in its Gatorade, Aunt Jemima syrup and
food-service businesses.</p>
<p>Overall, sales from continuing operations in fiscal 1990
were $5.03 billion, up 3% from fiscal 1989.</p>
<p>Slightly higher margins helped boost operating income, as
the company focused its merchandising might on higher-margin,
higher-growth products, while trimming costs in mature lines.
Overhead expenses were also reduced.</p>
<p>Internationally, Quaker's grocery products operations,
which posted record sales and operating earnings, were aided
by the reversal of a previous charge for plant consolidations
in Europe. The company last year took a $20.7 million
restructuring charge because of plans to close older plants
in West Germany and the Netherlands and build a new one. Upon
reflection, the company decided to save costs by keeping the
older plants open instead of building the new one.</p>
