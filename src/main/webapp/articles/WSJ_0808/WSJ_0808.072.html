	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Western Union Corp.'s unionized workers
remained on the job as the company and the Communications
Workers of America worked toward a new three-year contract to
replace one that expired midnight Monday.
   The United Telegraph Workers/CWA had threatened to strike
if it didn't get a new contract. But a company spokesman said
Western Union's 2,500 unionized employees were working and
that company and union negotiators were still meeting at the
Cavalier Hotel in Virginia Beach, Va., trying to reach a new
agreement.</p>
