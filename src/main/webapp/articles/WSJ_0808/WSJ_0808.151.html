	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The clock has begun ticking for Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein, whose access to world oil markets
has been closed by a multinational embargo. But the U.S. is
scrambling to minimize the damage the boycott could do to its
own economy.
   Saudi Arabia yesterday agreed to increase its oil
production in a move that could cushion much of the coming
embargo-related oil shock, according to senior Bush
administration officials. The Saudis didn't commit to a
specific increase in production, although there were
indications that talks would continue. The White House had
been seeking an increase of about two million barrels a day
in the kingdom's current output of 5.4 million barrels a day.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The agreement represented a major breakthrough in the
growing global campaign against Mr. Hussein. The Saudis in
recent years have forsworn their one-time role as the "swing
producer" in OPEC, and have always resisted appearing
sensitive to Western influence. In the delicately balanced
world-wide oil market, two million barrels a day of extra
production could cut several dollars from the price of a
barrel of crude.</p>
<p>Also yesterday, Vice President Dan Quayle met with
Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez, who reversed his
earlier position and agreed to increase his nation's oil
production by 500,000 barrels a day, according to an
administration official traveling with the vice president.</p>
<p>In addition, the U.S. decided to send a representative to
a meeting of the International Energy Agency tomorrow to
discuss plans for the U.S., Germany, Japan and other nations
to use jointly their strategic petroleum reserves to ease the
pain of the embargo. Officials say the White House has not
yet decided whether it will use the U.S. reserve but wants to
"feel out" the other nations.</p>
<p>The embargo of Iraqi oil began to show its full force
yesterday. Turkey said it is turning away ships loading oil
from an Iraqi oil export pipeline. And the flow of oil
through Iraq's pipeline across Saudi Arabia also is likely to
be shut down by Sunday, oil experts say, because storage
tanks will be full and tankers aren't loading the oil. That
means Mr. Hussein will lose, for now, the oil revenues he
needs to maintain his military machine and feed his army.</p>
<p>"Realistically, he ought to be recalculating," says
Richard Murphy, the State Department's top Middle East
diplomat in the Reagan administration. "It is hard to
believe, though we don't know, that he had expected the
opposition that was generated in the last few days."</p>
<p>But U.S. government estimates show Iraq has enough food to
last into the fall, even without oil money. "I think the food
situation is better than it has been for some years," says
Jonathan Crusoe, an Iraqi specialist at the Middle East
Economic Digest who just returned from that country. "There's
more local produce in the shops than before."</p>
<p>In the meantime, soaring oil prices could cut deep into
the economies of the rest of the world. That means that
unless the Mideast standoff explodes into a military
confrontation, Iraq and the industrialized world will be
caught in a high-stakes war of nerves to see who flinches
first.</p>
<p>Mr. Hussein is a hardened risk taker, who has shown that
he has incredible staying power and the ruthlessness to win.
When he tried, at the age of 22, to assassinate Iraq's
military leader, he was shot in the attempt and dug the
bullet out of his thigh as he fled across the desert. And he
proved he could endure a decade of intense economic pain
during the Iran-Iraq war. "I think in a sense he does have
more patience than we do," says Kenneth Katzman, a defense
consultant who studied Mr. Hussein as a Central Intelligence
Agency analyst. "Just choking him off won't deflate him."</p>
<p>Moreover, Mr. Hussein may get some help from neighboring
Jordan, which has supported Iraq's move and could provide an
overland route for bringing in food and other vital imports.
In addition, Turkish truck drivers, whose workload has
declined since the Iran-Iraq war ended, will undoubtedly be
itching to sneak loads of goods across the long Iraqi-Turkish
border.</p>
<p>Mr. Hussein is also likely to try to intimidate other oil
sheikdoms, particularly Saudi Arabia, into giving him money.
"Even if the embargo works 100%, they (the Iraqis) will still
have revenues because the Saudis are going to pay bribes,"
says Patrick Clawson, an economist at the Foreign Policy
Research Institute who has dealt extensively with the Middle
East. The U.S., however, is sure to try and stop the Saudis
from making any such payments.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the test for the boycotting nations will
be to maintain their resolve in the face of high oil prices.
Over time, Mr. Hussein is likely to find a way to sell some
of his oil to energy-hungry nations. Indeed, without the
formation of an effective international naval blockade, the
embargo almost certainly will leak as oil prices rise. "There
are always cheaters," says Michael Ameen, a Houston
consultant who formerly worked for Mobil Corp. "There are
always people who say they're not going to buy, and then they
turn around and buy."</p>
<p>The industrialized world, meanwhile, is going to be badly
hurt by the oil-price increase resulting from the embargo.
"It will slow the rate of growth considerably in Europe and
Japan, although they can probably avoid recession," says
Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International.
"In the U.S., however, if oil prices stay at these levels,
it's probably impossible to avoid recession."</p>
<p>Japan is the nation most dependent on imported oil. But it
is in some ways the best-positioned to deal with a price
increase -- thanks to the energy-conservation measures and
industrial restructuring that have taken place in the past
decade. The U.S., on the other hand, has been less aggressive
in reducing its dependence on imported oil. Moreover, the oil
price spike comes at a particularly bad time for the U.S.,
because its economy is so weak.</p>
<p>The U.S. has been hoping to ease the pain of a jump in oil
prices by convincing Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates,
Venezuela, Nigeria and Ecuador to produce more oil.</p>
<p>Venezuela's President Perez promised Mr. Quayle to help
Brazil, which has been receiving large quantities of Iraqi
oil. And he said Venezuela will do everything it can to keep
the price of oil at the $21-a-barrel price agreed to recently
by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.</p>
<p>John Easton, assistant energy secretary for international
affairs, will represent the Bush administration at the IEA
meeting in Paris. The U.S. has 590 million barrels of oil in
its reserve, while Japan has 140 million barrels and Germany
100 million barrels. Those three nations alone could make up
for the lost Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil for about 200 days.</p>
<p>Administration officials say they would prefer to act in
concert with other nations. "Obviously using (the strategic
reserve) unilaterally . . . wouldn't be nearly as beneficial
for American consumers as if we can arrange for coordinating
a multinational drawdown of stocks," said Linda Stuntz,
deputy undersecretary of energy.</p>
<p>Ms. Stuntz said the U.S. Energy Department is preparing a
list of options for President Bush to respond to the crisis.
The list doesn't include any proposal for price controls, but
does include such measures as encouraging industries to
switch from oil to natural gas, and encouraging conservation
measures -- for example enforcing speed limits and increasing
tire pressure in vehicles.</p>
