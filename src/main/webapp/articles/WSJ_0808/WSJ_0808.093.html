	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Corporate giving to education and charitable
causes rose a meager 3% in 1989, and is likely to grow only
5% this year, according to a survey by the Council for Aid to
Education.
   After more than a decade of annual increases averaging
15%, corporate contributions began to drop off in 1988, the
council said. A spokeswoman attributed the slowing rate to
changing tax laws, mixed corporate profits and uncertainty
over the economy.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Increases in donations to education also have slowed in
recent years, the survey found. Contributions to education
rose 4% in 1989 and 6% in 1988, after 12 years of
double-digit jumps.</p>
<p>In addition to curbing their largess, the study found
companies are redirecting their gifts. The share of dollars
devoted specifically to pre-college education jumped 10.5% in
1989, after years of much smaller increases.</p>
<p>Total corporate giving to all causes in 1989 rose to an
estimated $6.5 billion, or about 2.1% of pretax corporate
profits. Giving to education rose to $2.8 billion, or 0.9% of
corporate profits, the council estimated. The growth in
corporate giving in 1988 was only 2%, the council now
estimates, down from an earlier estimate of 3.2%.</p>
<p>Data for the survey were provided by 333 companies, which
account for 25% of corporate giving.</p>
