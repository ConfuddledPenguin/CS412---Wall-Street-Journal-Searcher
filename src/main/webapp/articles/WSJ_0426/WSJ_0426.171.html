	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Strong buying of marks on renewed confidence
in the Bundesbank's ability to control West German inflation
sent the dollar two pfennig lower against the mark.
   The U.S. unit also ended moderately lower against the yen
amid broad dollar weakness inspired by the market's bullish
stance on the mark and participants' continuing focus on
non-dollar dealings, traders said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The mark began its surge at the beginning of the European
day after the Bundesbank's 1989 annual report was released,
in which the German central bank pledged to maintain a strong
mark as a means to help contain inflation.</p>
<p>The annual report, which suggested that the Bundesbank was
prepared to defend the mark either through intervention or by
raising interest rates, relaxed market anxiety about the
ramifications of monetary integration that had damped
interest in the West German currency recently, participants
said.</p>
<p>Typical of the market's reaction to the annual report was
a comment by Carl Amendola, a vice president at Bayerische
Hypotheken-& Wechsel-Bank AG in New York, who expressed
confidence that "any inflationary outburst will be handled in
the most efficient manner by the Bundesbank."</p>
<p>The report was also seen as reassurance that the central
bank will have the last word on how the consequences of
monetary union are managed, following the West German
government's decision to apply more widely than the
Bundesbank had recommended the exchange ratio of one Deutsche
mark to one Ostmark.</p>
<p>Reports shortly before the close of New York trading that
West German opposition leader Oskar Lafontaine had been
attacked and seriously wounded at a political rally had
little immediate effect on trading. Hypo-Bank's Mr. Amendola
said market participants would wait to see how West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl responds to the attack before taking
positions. Mr. Lafontaine was stabbed in the neck by a
middle-aged woman; his condition was later reported as
serious.</p>
<p>Mr. Kohl's reaction is important, Mr. Amendola noted,
because Mr. Lafontaine, a leader of the West German Social
Democratic Party, had been chosen by his party to oppose Mr.
Kohl in December's election for chancellor.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank news also served to fuel another day of
strong mark gains against the yen, lending added impetus to a
shift toward long mark positions in mark-yen dealings that
began Tuesday. The West German currency rose to around 94.578
yen late Wednesday in New York from 93.99 yen in late Tokyo
dealings and from 93.61 yen late Tuesday in New York.</p>
<p>The perception that the Japanese currency went too far,
too fast in its recovery against the mark this past week
underlies the mark's recent gains against the yen, said
Abigail Cook, a vice president at Hongkong & Shanghai Banking
Corp. in New York.</p>
<p>Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
1.6785 marks, down sharply from 1.6980 marks late Tuesday,
and at 158.75 yen, down from 158.93 yen late Tuesday.
Sterling was quoted at $1.6403, up from $1.6343 Tuesday.</p>
<p>In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the dollar was quoted
at 158.73 yen, off from Wednesday's Tokyo close of 159.25
yen. Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at about 1.6783 marks.</p>
<p>Following Wednesday's Tokyo close, the dollar slid in
European and New York dealings before finding a comfortable
trading level just above support at 158.50 yen, participants
said.</p>
<p>With market attention focused elsewhere and lacking fresh
news, the dollar spent the day trading near 158.60 yen,
except for a late attempt at 159 yen that fizzled on a lack
of follow-through buying, the traders said.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery fell $5.20 to $370.70 an ounce in moderate trading.
The close was the lowest since April 2. Estimated volume was
4.3 million ounces.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at $371.85 an
ounce.</p>
