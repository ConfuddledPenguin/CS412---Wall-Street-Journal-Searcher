	<p class="article-leader">OSHAWA, Ontario -- A walkout by Canadian Auto Workers
union members forced General Motors Corp. to shut down three
assembly plants here Tuesday afternoon and most of yesterday.
   But late yesterday, GM said local union leaders were
asking members to return to their jobs in time for the
evening shift. GM and the union were scheduled to begin talks
to resolve the dispute, which flared after a local union
leader was suspended from his job.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As of yesterday afternoon, GM said it had lost two shifts'
worth of production Tuesday night and Wednesday morning at
its Oshawa No. 1 car plant and its Oshawa truck assembly
factory. The evening shift was canceled at the Oshawa No. 2
car plant, but work resumed there yesterday morning, a
company spokesman said. Some 10,000 workers either walked off
the job or were sent home, he said.</p>
<p>The local union moved to halt the walkout late yesterday
after a strong rebuke from CAW president Bob White. Mr.
White, in a statement, called the shutdown "absolutely
ludicrous" and a violation of union policy. GM had earlier
said the strike was illegal, and threatened to seek
government sanctions against the CAW.</p>
<p>The strike began about midday Tuesday when managers
suspended a CAW local official for two weeks. A GM spokesman
wouldn't elaborate on the reasons, but the union said the
official was disciplined for remarks made to a GM manager.</p>
<p>Shortly after the suspension, a small group of workers in
a key area of the Oshawa No. 1 car plant walked off the job,
halting production of midsized Chevrolet Lumina and Buick
Regal models. The CAW local then called its shop stewards off
the floor at all three Oshawa assembly facilities. That
precipitated a broader work stoppage that finally forced GM
to cancel the evening shift Tuesday, the company said. The
work stoppages continued yesterday morning at two of the
three assembly plants at GM's Oshawa complex.</p>
<p>GM didn't say how many vehicles it lost because of the
strike. The two Oshawa car plants build about 400 vehicles a
day, while the truck plant builds 480 vehicles a day.</p>
<p>Separately, GM confirmed that it will move production of
its Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird models to its Ste.
Therese, Quebec, plant. The move is expected sometime before
1993, but GM didn't set a date. The company also didn't
elaborate on the fate of the Van Nuys, Calif., plant that
currently builds the cars. But GM officials have said they
are "optimistic" that the Van Nuys plant will keep operating
producing other models.</p>
<p>Still, Stephen P. Yokich, head of the United Auto Workers
union's GM department, denounced the move, saying such
announcements "are doing nothing to create a favorable
environment for the difficult negotiating task we face" when
the UAW-GM contract expires this fall.</p>
