	<p class="article-leader">Under the terms of the Super 301 provision of the 1988
Trade Act, President Bush must decide by Monday which
countries to target as unfair traders. A word of advice:
unfair trading practices are an unfair condemnation of a
friendly ally.
   The Japan-bashers' arguments against Japan's supposed
trade perfidy have undergone a series of self-interested
metamorphoses. The original complaint was that Japan's
visible trade barriers were much higher than ours. When it
became apparent that this was not so, the criticism shifted
to the charge that the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry somehow was managing to prevent the lower trade
barriers from increasing imports. Empirical scrutiny failed
to sustain this charge too.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Now the argument has shifted again. The current charge is
that the problem is not the efficacy of MITI's visible
(import-restraining) hand but the inefficacy of Adam Smith's
invisible (import-enhancing) hand. In short, Japan is too
bizarre and exotic, in its culture and in its economic
organization, for markets (and therefore GATT-style market
access) to work as they do in the West.</p>
<p>The culturalists have had a field day with this view. But
their assertions of Japan's cultural uniqueness and how
normal "rules-based" trade with Japan is impossible, don't
hold up under economic scrutiny. As is often the case,
economics can explain differences glibly attributed to
culture. A few examples should suffice:</p>
<p>Take the popular view that Japan's familial culture leads
to the "permanent-employment" system. Few know that this
system came to Japan only after the Second World War. Indeed,
as argued recently by Columbia Prof. Jacob Mincer, the labor
turnover rates in Japanese manufacturing before the war and
in American manufacturing since the war are broadly similar.
It wasn't until after the war that the decline in employee
turnover in Japan occurred. The explanation seems to be that
the rapid economic growth in post-war Japan was based on
rapid technical change that called for intensive formation of
human capital specific to an enterprise. This encouraged
lower turnover.</p>
<p>Or take the frequent complaint that the Japanese are
wedded to their own for supplies of intermediates. Evidence?
In the U.S., Japanese companies' ratio of imported
intermediates to value added is twice as high as that of
other foreign investors. But think again. If protection, or
the threat of it, induces foreign firms to enter a market,
they will typically import as many components as they can
from their home base, where production is cheaper. Who can
deny that our actual and threatened trade restraints against
Japan have been substantially greater than those against
other nations? The astonishing thing may well be that
Japanese investors have not wound up showing a yet higher
ratio of imports to value added.</p>
<p>James Fallows of the Atlantic Monthly writes about Japan's
inability to play by "rules," and its preference for
"quantities." These cultural abnormalities make it impossible
for Japan to have rules-based, GATT-type trade and makes
"managed trade" (with specified quantities traded) the best
solution. Japanese trade negotiators presumably ask the U.S.:
How much do you want us to import? Mr. Fallows attributes
this query to "Japanese discomfort with the very prospect of
abiding by abstract principles." This is nonsense. Is it not
more likely that, faced with Americans' repeated complaints,
the Japanese ask: "How much do you want us to import," wisely
muting the rest of the sentence: "to get you off our backs?"
Since the 1930s, the U.S. has imposed quantitative limits on
Japan's successful exports, starting with "voluntary" export
restraints on electric lamps and textiles. Could not the
Japanese have learned, thanks to us, the wisdom of asking
about quantities?</p>
<p>Clyde Prestowitz, former U.S. trade negotiator and an ally
of Mr. Fallows in the angst over Japan, is doubly wrong when
he asserts that Japan "plays a different game" and that
therefore the U.S. cannot have beneficial trade with it under
a rules-based multilateral trading regime. For one thing, the
sports analogy is inappropriate: In games, one party loses
and the other wins; in trade, both often win. His second
error, shared by other culturalists, is to exaggerate the
exotic nature of the Japanese game. In his incomprehension,
he's like the Indian maharajah who, taken to a polo match,
turned to his English host in puzzled consternation to say:
"It is so sad to see them fighting over that ball. Why don't
you give each their own?"</p>
<p>What then about the view, often ascribed to Chalmers
Johnson, professor at the University of California at San
Diego, that Japanese companies believe in "predatory"
competition?</p>
<p>The notion that American companies, by contrast, compete
in a benign fashion is faintly romantic and fully foolish.
What the Cambridge economist Joan Robinson used to call the
"animal spirits" of capitalist entrepreneurs surely are
manifest in both countries. The successful always appear more
predatory. This was exactly the stereotype of British
entrepreneurs during the 19th century and of the "ugly"
American in the '50s and '60s. With success, one gets one's
share of envy and resentment.</p>
<p>The hawks in Congress would like to hit Japan again this
year with Super 301, seeing Japan's latest concessions at the
Structural Impediments Initiative talks as a defendant's
admission of guilt. But these concessions are nothing of the
kind. Most, such as the promise of more infrastructure
spending, have little relationship to trade; none can be a
substitute for our own actions in improving our trade
deficit.</p>
<p>Rather, the concessions are designed to cap the
increasingly strident Japan-bashing from getting altogether
out of hand. They give the administration a sporting chance
to face down a bellicose Congress by citing Japan's agreeable
accommodation of our needs. The president should seize that
chance.</p>
