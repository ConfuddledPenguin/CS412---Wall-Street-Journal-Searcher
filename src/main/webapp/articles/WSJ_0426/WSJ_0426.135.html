	<p class="article-leader">Total-Cie. Francaise des Petroles, Paris, said its 1989
net consolidated profit jumped 49.2% to 2.2 billion francs
($386 million) from 1.48 billion francs in 1988.
   Consolidated revenue rose 15.6% to 107.9 billion francs
($18.9 billion) from 93.3 billion francs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The French state-controlled oil group noted that the steep
rise in profit occurred despite 1.14 billion francs in
extraordinary items. In 1988, the company had extraordinary
gains of 242 million francs.</p>
<p>About one-half of the 1989 extraordinary charges was
attributable to various provisions linked to restructuring
within the group. The other half was because of the
acceleration of depreciation and provisions affecting the
group's oil and gas assets, mainly in North America.</p>
<p>Total-CFP said the sharp increase in revenue reflected
strong sales growth both in terms of value and volume. The
group sold 62.1 million tons of crude oil in 1989, up 14.2%
from a year earlier.</p>
