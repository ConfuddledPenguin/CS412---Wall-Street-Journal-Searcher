	<p class="article-leader">HAMBURG, West Germany -- East Germany plans to permit 100%
foreign ownership of businesses, the Hamburg-based newspaper
Bild quoted Gerhard Pohl, the economics minister of the
formerly Communist country, as saying.
   Mr. Pohl said East Germany will repeal recent laws that
restrict foreign ownership in joint ventures to 49%, Bild
reported. Many foreign companies have shied away from
investments in East Germany because of restrictions limiting
investors to a minority share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Pohl said new laws will be passed "very soon," Bild
reported, but he added that East Germans will receive
preferential treatment in investments.</p>
