	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The White House is betting that trade
problems with Japan have slipped off the political front
burner.
   This morning, the president's top economic advisers are
scheduled to meet to discuss whether the U.S. should formally
designate Japan or any other nations as unfair trading
partners. According to administration officials, the outcome
of this morning's meeting has been set in advance: Japan
won't be on the list.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>White House Trade Representative Carla Hills yesterday
said that the administration shouldn't single out Japan. When
it comes to lowering trade barriers, "I think Japan has moved
further this year than any other country," she told
lawmakers.</p>
<p>The administration's soft-glove approach represents a
shift from the iron fist it swung only a year ago. Under
provisions of the 1988 Trade Act, the U.S. last year branded
Japan for blocking U.S. sales of supercomputers, satellites
and wood products in that country. Officially designating
such practices under the so-called Super 301 provisions of
the Trade Act triggered a process that can lead to
retaliatory measures.</p>
<p>Since then, the administration has won new concessions on
satellites and supercomputers -- and only yesterday announced
an agreement on wood products that could add as much as $1
billion a year in U.S. lumber exports. President Bush,
meanwhile, is eager to show appreciation for the steps that
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu has taken to address U.S. trade
concerns.</p>
<p>But still, the trade deficit with Japan, while shrinking,
remains large. So why now, when the law requires the
administration to make its annual identification of unfair
trading partners, is the White House going easy on Japan?
Partly because the administration -- which is predisposed
toward free-trade policies to begin with -- thinks the
protectionist fires are burning out on Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>The White House may be right. "The emotion has gone out of
the trade issue," says Douglas Lamont, senior lecturer in
international business at the Kellogg Graduate School of
Management of Northwestern University. Developments in
Eastern Europe and elsewhere demand cooperation instead of
confrontation with Japan, he says. In addition, even if the
numbers remain high, "the trend line of the trade deficit is
good," he says.</p>
<p>The issue is far from cut-and-dried in the polls. Voters
ranked the trade deficit well behind the federal budget
deficit -- and behind unemployment as well -- as the most
important economic issue facing the country, according to a
Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll conducted in March.</p>
<p>But a Journal/NBC poll conducted this month showed that
only 34% said they believed that Japan was sincere about
removing trade barriers, while 52% believed it was insincere.</p>
<p>At today's meeting of the Economic Policy Council, only
two of the 10 members likely to attend are expected to
dissent from the view that Japan shouldn't be cited under
Super 301 this year, a senior administration official says.
They are Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher and Labor
Secretary Elizabeth Dole, who both apparently advocate citing
Japan as an unfair trader, while expressing appreciation for
the market-opening moves Japan has made so far.</p>
<p>In the debate over whether to cite Japan, administration
officials took account of election-year pressure -- and
determined that there wasn't all that much of it. Sen. John
Rockefeller of economically depressed West Virginia has long
promoted his tough stance on protecting U.S. patents and
other intellectual property -- but now is shifting his focus
to health issues. He hasn't even bothered to reappoint to his
staff a full-time trade official to fill the vacancy caused
by the departure of Ira Wolf, a noted trade specialist.</p>
<p>Others on Capitol Hill have been co-opted on the trade
issue. Two Senate trade hawks, Robert Packwood (R., Ore.) and
Max Baucus (D., Mont.), have become much quieter on trade
problems with Japan since the admininstration began pressing
for concessions on wood-products exports -- from which their
states draw big revenues.</p>
<p>When Ms. Hills yesterday traveled to Capitol Hill to say
that Japan shouldn't be named an unfair trading partner, Sen.
Packwood supported her -- and Sen. Baucus hestitated to be
critical. In fact, he used the occasion of yesterday's
announcement of a lumber agreement with Japan to estimate
that the extra wood sales would create 15,000 to 20,000 jobs.</p>
<p>No matter how the administration handicaps the political
odds, there's bound to be some moaning on Capitol Hill when
the Super 301 decision is announced -- either tomorrow or
Monday. Failing to name Japan, says Senate Finance Committee
Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas), "would be a serious
mistake" and "a complete abandonment" of the intention of the
1988 Trade Act.</p>
<p>Worse still for the White House, Sen. Bentsen adds, the
decision may throw the administration's entire trade agenda
into gridlock. It "may poison the well for {congressional}
consideration" of administration proposals for trade
legislation relating to Czechoslovakia, China, the Soviet
Union -- and even the round of talks to overhaul the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which governs most of the
non-Communist world's trade.</p>
<p>But Sen. Bentsen and others on the Finance Committee are
pleased with the way that Ambassador Hills has carried out
provisions of the 1988 Trade Act. There is a strong feeling
in the committee that the panel's influence -- through the
1988 act -- has led to the market-opening successes of the
past 15 months in negotiations with Japan and South Korea.</p>
<p>But, reflecting a widely held view in Congress, one Senate
staffer says now isn't the time to let up; she feels that
Japan will become less cooperative on trade issues if its
feet aren't held to the fire through continued use of the
Super 301 provisions.</p>
<p>The U.S.-Japan wood products agreement announced yesterday
is the most recent result of last year's Super 301 process.
The agreement is designed to improve U.S. access to the
Japanese market through changes in tariff classification and
product certification.</p>
<p>Beginning June 1, most structural laminated wood products
shipped to Japan will carry a tariff of 3.9%, down from as
much as 20% currently. The certification of U.S. lumber
products entering Japan also will be streamlined to save time
and cost to the supplier.</p>
<p>Japan also agreed to accept U.S. grading organizations'
testing methodologies for wood products provided they offer
equivalent guarantees of quality and safety. In addition,
Japanese building codes will be revised to facilitate the
introduction of new products.</p>
<p>A representative of the U.S. wood industry who monitored
the talks in Tokyo said his group was generally pleased with
the agreement, but failed to get many of its demands. He said
the pact would, over the next 10 years, increase sales about
$750 million a year, well below the $2 billion gain the
industry estimated had it received everything it sought.</p>
