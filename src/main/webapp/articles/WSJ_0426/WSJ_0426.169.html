	<p class="article-leader">BRUSSELS -- The European Community Commission unveiled a
major proposal aimed at establishing a single market for
brokerage and investment services.
   The proposal, which would set minimum capital-adequacy
rules for securities firms to apply across the EC, is
considered a major step in the EC's plan to create a single
market by the end of 1992. In combination with other pending
legislation, it will allow any investment-services firm
established anywhere in the EC to do business throughout the
trading bloc.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The plan still has to be approved by the member states and
could face amendments and tough bargaining. But the proposal
is likely to form the basis of a final agreement.</p>
<p>Early drafts of the proposal drew complaints from firms in
the U.K., including U.S. firms established there, because the
rules would force them to substantially boost capital. The
revised plan seeks to answer this complaint by allowing more
flexibilty in covering investment risk.</p>
<p>German banks, meanwhile, had protested that securities
firms would have an unfair advantage because the banks would
remain subject to more rigid -- and potentially more costly
-- minimum solvency requirements the EC is imposing on banks.
West German markets are dominated by so-called universal
banks, which offer a full range of financial services from
commercial banking to insurance and brokering.</p>
<p>The compromise proposal unveiled yesterday allows EC
states to make an exception for universal banks, whose
securities operations may be covered by the capital-adequacy
rules rather than by the banking solvency rules. It also
allows the banks more flexibility in raising capital to cover
securities operations.</p>
