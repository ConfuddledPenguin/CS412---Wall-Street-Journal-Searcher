	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The Securities and Exchange Commission said
that Richard Bangham, former chairman of Viking Freight Inc.,
settled a civil suit involving alleged insider trading.
   In the settlement, Mr. Bangham agreed to pay a penalty of
$117,625. In agreeing to the settlement, he neither admitted
nor denied the allegations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The SEC suit, filed in November, alleged that Mr. Bangham,
as Viking chairman, learned on July 1, 1988, that Roadway
Services Inc. was interested in acquiring the company. The
suit alleged that Mr. Bangham passed that information to
Kenneth Liroff, a friend and business associate. The SEC
charged Mr. Liroff, of Livingston, N.J., with using that
information to purchase Viking common shares.</p>
<p>Mr. Liroff has denied the allegations. The SEC's civil
charges against him are pending in federal court in
Manhattan.</p>
<p>Viking and Roadway announced Roadway's tender offer for
the company on July 18, 1988. After the announcement,
Viking's stock price climbed 60% above the previous day's
closing price. The penalty to be paid by Mr. Bangham, of the
British West Indies, equals the profit that the SEC alleges
Mr. Liroff made on the transactions.</p>
