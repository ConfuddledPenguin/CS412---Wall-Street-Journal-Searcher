	<p class="article-leader">Far from the feverish salons of Manhattan and the
Washington Beltway, the air in western Michigan clears the
mind.
   The phenomenon is much in evidence in "A Gale of Creative
Destruction: The Coming Economic Boom, 1992-2020" (Praeger,
176 pages, $39.95), by Myron H. Ross. He's a little-known
economist devoted to exposing the fallacious notions about
the U.S. economy peddled incessantly these days -- in the
peevish pages of Harper's, the laconic lamentations of Irving
R. Levine, and the hysterical hearing rooms of the Capitol.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Ross is swimming upstream from his base camp at
Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo -- and loving it. In
the opening section, he takes apart the various popular
accounts of "America's decline." Paul Kennedy's "imperial
overstretch" mode is prima facie contradictory: America ought
to be getting stronger, not weaker, since federal outlays for
defense as a percentage of GNP have fallen from 9% in 1970 to
6% in 1986. Ben Wattenberg's prediction that a "birth dearth"
in the industrialized West will lead to shrinking markets
confuses population size with aggregate demand. As for Ravi
(the-depression-is-coming) Batra's stock market theory of the
business cycle, Mr. Ross finds that between 1946 and 1986
stock market turns bore a relation to turns in the business
cycle only 55% of the time.</p>
<p>In the author's iconoclastic view, the years 1992-2020
will see per capita real income in the U.S. grow at an annual
average rate of at least 2.5%, but probably closer to 3%, up
from an average of 2% between 1950 and 1986. An enormous
leap, this. Practically, it means that today's kids will have
at least twice the current income of their parents. (Lest you
think Mr. Ross is out on this limb alone, another excellent
book, "Rust to Riches: The Coming of the Second Industrial
Revolution," by John Rutledge and Deborah Allen, recently
predicted "decades of productivity growth and expansion
without inflation" on the strength of rising rates of savings
and pools of capital.)</p>
<p>Mr. Ross would bristle at terming his forecast
"optimistic," for he grounds it in the empiricism of Russian
economist N.D. Kondratieff's long-wave cycle of economic
growth and the works of Joseph Schumpeter. But neither
Kondratieff nor Schumpeter have been much studied in the
academy ever since the neoclassical and Keynesian models came
into vogue. These models assume that technological change
takes place at a constant rate, while Kondratieff and
Schumpeter thought that innovations in technology tend to
cluster in time.</p>
<p>Testing this hypothesis from 1790 on, the author discovers
that cycles of rise and relative decline in the growth rate
of per capita real income occur in roughly 30-year intervals.
The 1938 to 1968 rise coincided with innovations in
electronics, the computer, air transport, and the material
and green revolutions. Decline set in for 1968 to 1992, with
innovation and production dipping, along with savings,
investment and research-and-development expenditures. The
Reagan recovery of the past seven years merely is a harbinger
of the coming upswing, Mr. Ross argues.</p>
<p>That period will see world-wide deregulation,
privatization and democratization. Market competitiveness at
home and abroad will spur the rate of product innovation and
diffusion, especially in fields such as superconductivity and
biotechnology. Global firms will face less risk and
uncertainty in the internationalized market. As a
consequence, the minimum required rate of return on
investment, and interest rates, will be reduced. This should
increase the rate of innovation and productivity and minimize
inflation and unemployment.</p>
<p>The productivity lag associated with a young labor force,
and the flow of women and the ill-educated '60s generation
into it, will be reversed. Women's earnings and productivity
already are rising rapidly, and the same should hold true of
blacks. As older, less-educated blacks leave the work force,
the ratio of black to white income will rise. In the event,
the tax base and the savings rate will climb.</p>
<p>Overlapping markets will render meaningless national
growth rates. But since the learning process benefits
countries that start late on the growth path (witness Japan),
the developing world should reap high-tech economies of
scale, given a commitment to economic growth, foreign trade
and low tariffs. "If markets are kept competitive," the
author writes, "there is no conflict between the pursuit of
profits by multinational corporations and economic welfare."
This caveat applies equally to the U.S., where Mr. Ross's
truism -- free trade is a "free lunch, not a zero sum game"
-- seems lost on economic sophisticates like Dick Gephardt.</p>
<p>In the realm of U.S. policy, Mr. Ross thinks the president
should have discretionary power to vary taxes and spending by
5% of authorized levels, to check the congressional bias in
favor of running deficits. He also favors more flexible
nominal wage rates, more profit-sharing plans, lower
corporate tax rates, and a less progressive personal income
tax.</p>
<p>Being out of fashion is a funny thing. Allan Bloom and
Robert Bork found eager audiences when they delivered
themselves of intellectual tonics that were, as Mr. Ross's
is, so right for the moment. In the meantime, one can imagine
the professor sitting quietly in his office at Western
Michigan, marking off the days until 1991, when Dr. Batra
will be obliged to eat his silly words.</p>
