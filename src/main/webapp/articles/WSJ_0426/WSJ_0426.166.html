	<p class="article-leader">STOCKHOLM -- Svenska Cellulosa AB called off its pursuit
of West Germany's Feldmuehle Nobel AG -- but another big
Swedish pulp and paper maker, Stora Kopparbergs Bergslags AB,
quickly took up the chase.
   Separately, Veba AG said it's in negotiations with Stora
and other parties to break the deadlock over control of
Feldmuehle, and hinted that it may sell its 50.01% stake if
it can't consolidate its control at a price it considers
reasonable. Veba is "open to . . . solutions," a company
spokesman said, "as long as they are in the interest of
{Feldmuehle}."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>SCA yesterday said it sold its 5% Feldmuehle stake,
acquired last month, for 500 million Swedish kronor ($81.5
million) to 600 million kronor. The Swedish forestry giant
bought the stake to increase its bargaining power with the
West German paper, chemicals and engineering group, and
claimed its proposals for cooperation -- and perhaps even a
merger or acquisition -- had the support of shareholders
owning another 20% of Feldmuehle.</p>
<p>But the Swedish concern said yesterday that its proposals
were rebuffed.</p>
<p>Stora, Sweden's biggest pulp and paper group, disclosed a
few hours later that it is in talks with Feldmuehle. The
company declined further comment, but it and Feldmuehle have
a track record of cooperation, and currently operate joint
newsprint and pulp-making ventures.</p>
<p>Veba's comments indicate the West German chemicals and
energy concern may be willing to abandon its quest for
Feldmuehle, ending a two-year board-room drama that marked
West Germany's first big hostile takeover bid.</p>
<p>Despite its majority stake, Veba hasn't been able to gain
control of Feldmuehle because of that company's 5% voting
restriction on shareholders, regardless of the size of their
stake. This has led to a deadlock over control between Veba
and Feldmuehle's second-biggest shareholder, an investment
group led by U.S. brokerage firm Merrill Lynch & Co., which
is thought to hold more than a fifth of Feldmuehle's shares.</p>
<p>The Merrill Lynch group repeatedly has offered to sell its
shares to Veba for around 600 West German marks apiece
($353.22), a price Veba has rebuffed as too expensive. Veba
acquired its Feldmuehle shares for around 400 marks apiece.</p>
<p>If Veba does abandon its quest, it could open the way for
Stora, which, like SCA, is scrambling to expand in the
European Community ahead of the EC's 1992 single-market plan.
Both companies have snapped up European acquisitions to
bolster market shares and strengthen distribution networks.</p>
