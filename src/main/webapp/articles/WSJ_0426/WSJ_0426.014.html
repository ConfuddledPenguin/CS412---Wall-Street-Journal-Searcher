	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman
Richard Breeden said several provisions in a House bill aimed
at curbing penny-stock fraud "would have costly and
undesirable side effects."
   Speaking before the House finance subcommittee, Mr.
Breeden said the SEC doesn't support a provision that would
ban certain "blind pool" stock offerings. Blind pools are
offerings in which the business plan of the issuer is to seek
mergers or acquisitions in a specific line of business. They
have long been used by issuers in venture capital, real
estate and oil- and gas-exploration programs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Thus, substantial costs and burdens could be imposed on
this kind of financing technique for which disclosure
regulation has been adequate in the past, and which has been
an important source of producing capital," the SEC chairman
said.</p>
<p>Mr. Breeden also raised questions about a provision in the
bill that would require all penny stocks to be listed on an
automated quotation system. The measure might impose costs
that would discourage market-making in inactively traded
stocks of reputable companies, he said.</p>
<p>Despite Mr. Breeden's opposition, the bill has strong
bipartisan support in the subcommittee. The bill was
introduced this month by Rep. Edward Markey (D, Mass.),
chairman of the subcommittee.</p>
