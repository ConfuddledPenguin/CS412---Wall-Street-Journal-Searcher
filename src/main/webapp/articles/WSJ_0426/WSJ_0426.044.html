	<p class="article-leader">Procter & Gamble Co. reported fiscal third-quarter net
income soared a higher-than-expected 30% as sales rose 13%.
   For the third quarter, ended March 31, net income climbed
to $404 million, or $1.14 a share, from $310 million, or 92
cents a share, a year earlier. The company had more shares
outstanding this year because of an acquisition, and the
year-earlier per-share figure is adjusted for a 2-for-1 stock
split last November.</p>

<p>Analysts had predicted a strong quarter, but the results
beat even the rosiest forecasts. "It's like a broken record,"
said Joseph Kozloff, analyst with Smith Barney in New York,
pinning the higher results on a variety of P&G's operations,
especially overseas.</p>
<p>Based on the higher earnings report, some analysts boosted
their forecasts for P&G's fiscal 1990 and 1991 results. Mr.
Kozloff, for instance, raised his 1990 estimate to $4.50 a
share, up from his earlier estimate of $4.40. For 1991, he
expects P&G to earn $5.20 a share, up from his earlier $5.10
forecast.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, P&G shares
rose $1.125, to $69.50.</p>
<p>One factor that helped the Cincinnati-based maker of
consumer products was a lower tax rate of 32.1%, compared
with 38.5% the year before.</p>
<p>More important, though, was P&G's continued growth in
Japan and other international markets, analysts said. In the
U.S., P&G's market shares in laundry and cleaning products
improved.</p>
<p>Cost-cutting measures continue to be a priority at the
company. For instance, P&G is expected to announce some plant
closings, because in the second quarter the company took a
one-time charge of $174 million to cover the consolidation.</p>
<p>For the fiscal first nine months, P&G posted net income of
$1.32 billion, or $3.71 a share, up 27% from $1.04 billion,
or an adjusted $3.06 a share. Sales rose 12% to $17.87
billion from $15.97 billion.</p>
<p>The year-earlier figures included a gain from P&G's switch
to a hyperinflationary accounting system for certain
operations in Latin America. P&G didn't quantify the gain at
the time, but analysts say it was worth about seven cents to
nine cents a share.</p>
