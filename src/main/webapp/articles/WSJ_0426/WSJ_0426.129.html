	<p class="article-leader">Consolidated Freightways Inc., Menlo Park, Calif.,
continuing to suffer deficits from its Emery Worldwide unit,
said it had a loss of $37.1 million, or $1.06 a share, in the
first quarter. A year-earlier it earned $32.5 million, or 86
cents a share.
   The transportation concern said revenue climbed 37% to
$997.7 million from $726.1 million. The 1989 quarter was
restated, the company said, because of an accounting change
that added $11.3 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company said its Emery unit had an operating loss of
$69.5 million on revenue of $317.8 million.</p>
<p>The firm acquired the unit last year for $230 million and
the assumption of $240 million in debt. Emery consistently
has posted losses because of either bad weather, high fuel
costs or both. The subsidiary also has been hurt by the
increasing competitiveness of the air freight industry.</p>
