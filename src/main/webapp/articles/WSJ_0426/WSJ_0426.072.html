	<p class="article-leader">As of yesterday, Nicaragua has a president deserving of
the title. A president should be freely determined by a
nation's voters, and that is precisely how Violetta Chamorro
came to be inaugurated yesterday as president of Nicaragua.
Now, after years of the Somoza and Sandinista dictatorships,
Nicaraguans have a chance to shape their own affairs. But it
won't be easy.
   President Chamorro takes office under circumstances that
are politically bizarre. She has agreed to let Humberto
Ortega run the army, while she holds the title of Defense
Minister. Clearly, she is not yet fully in control of the
country's substantial arsenal of military power. Sandinista
"unions" already are hammering with strikes what little is
left of the economy. At her inauguration yesterday,
Sandinistas threw water balloons at Mrs. Chamorro and rocks
at Vice President Dan Quayle. Against this backdrop, the U.S.
Congress, controlled by Democrats who bellowed for years
about how much they cared for Nicaragua, is dragging its feet
on voting $300 million in much-needed aid for the
Nicaraguans. The Democrats' silence is obvious and deafening
at the moment that the new Nicaraguan democracy most needs
their support.</p>
