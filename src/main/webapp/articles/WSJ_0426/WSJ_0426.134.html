	<p class="article-leader">Holiday Inns Inc. said it will dismiss about 600
employees, as part of an effort to streamline the lodging
company, based in Memphis, Tenn.
   Holiday, a unit of Bass PLC of Britain, said it will drop
about 260 people from its hotel-services division; 210 from
its Holiday Clubs operation, which will include the
disbanding of the sales force; 80 from its international
operations; and 50 from its headquarters staff. The company
said the moves were prompted by findings from an
organizational review conducted since February. Holiday has
40,000 employees.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Holiday said it intends to focus solely on its hotel
operations. As part of its restructuring, the hotel business
in the U.S., previously run as one operation, will be split
between company-managed hotels and a franchise system.</p>
<p>The company also announced the resignation of Kenneth B.
Hamlet as president and chief executive officer of the
Holiday Inn Hotel division. He will remain a consultant to
the company.</p>
