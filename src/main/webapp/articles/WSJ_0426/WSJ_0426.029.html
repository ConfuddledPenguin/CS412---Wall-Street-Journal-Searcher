	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Noranda Forest Inc. said it will discontinue
the production of coated label papers at its mill in Thorold,
Ontario.
   A company spokesman said there's no indication that the
move, which includes the loss of 95 jobs representing about
16% of the plant's work force, will result in a charge
against earnings. He said the production of label papers,
used for labeling cans and other containers, isn't profitable
because of competition from imports. The company said the
future of the Thorold mill lies in de-inked recycled papers
and wallpaper.</p>
