	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Primerica Corp.'s direct marketing subsidiary,
Fingerhut Cos., began trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday after a public offering of six million shares.
   Proceeds of the offering, at $16.50 a share, will be about
$93 million, after expenses, excluding the underwriters'
overallotment option of an additional 900,000 shares. After
the offering is completed, and excluding the overallotment,
Primerica will own 72.4% of Fingerhut common outstanding.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Fingerhut, based in Minneapolis, is a catalog retailer and
the U.S.'s fourth-largest direct mail marketer in sales. In
1989, Fingerhut earned $39.4 million on revenue of $1.1
billion.</p>
<p>In composite New York Stock Exchange trading, Fingerhut
shares closed unchanged at $16.50. Primerica closed at
$28.625, up 62.5 cents.</p>
<p>Separately, Sanford I. Weill, chairman of Primerica, an
insurance, consumer-credit and financial-services company,
said after the company's annual meeting that he plans to
expand the sales force of the Smith Barney, Harris Upham &
Co. unit internally rather than through acquisition. The
company has said it wants to increase Smith Barney's sales
force about 50% in the next three to five years, from about
2,500 currently.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Mr. Weill was in talks with American
Express Co. about a possible merger of that company's
Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. securities unit with
Smith Barney. In response to a question, Mr. Weill said,
"Shearson was a unique situation. We were approached and we
spoke to them." Mr. Weill said "we could have injected a
level of management" to help the financial situation at
Shearson, and "we felt we had an obligation to our
shareholders to look at it."</p>
<p>But American Express decided to buy back the remaining
approximately 30% publicly held shares of Shearson, which
last week reported a first-quarter loss of $915 million, or
$10.54 a share.</p>
<p>Mr. Weill declined to make any earnings predictions.
Primerica last week posted a 62% jump in first-quarter net
income, to $83.2 million, or 73 cents a share.</p>
<p>In related news, Primerica said Joseph R. Wright Jr. was
elected to its board. Mr. Wright, vice chairman and a
director of W.R. Grace & Co., succeeds William S. Woodside, a
former chairman of Primerica, who retired from the board. Mr.
Woodside was named director emeritus.</p>
