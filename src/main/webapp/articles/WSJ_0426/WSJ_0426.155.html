	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon said that Craig Fields, who was
ousted recently as head of the Defense Advanced Projects
Agency (Darpa) in a battle over industrial policy, has
decided to accept a transfer to another Pentagon job.
   But a colleague said that the Pentagon technologist
planned to take the new job only temporarily while lining up
work in private industry. Mr. Fields declined to comment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A Pentagon spokesman said that Mr. Fields would start May
7 as deputy director of defense research and engineering,
with responsibility for streamlining the Pentagon's
laboratories. Victor Reis, Darpa's deputy director, will
succeed Mr. Fields as acting administrator.</p>
<p>Mr. Fields was pressured into accepting the transfer,
widely viewed as a demotion, Pentagon and congressional
officials said, because he had pushed the government to
aggressively invest in companies pursuing commercial
technology.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, a group of 11 lawmakers, including House
Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, called for Mr. Fields's
reinstatement, arguing that he is one of the government's
most successful technology leaders. But a colleague of Mr.
Fields said that the Pentagon technologist doubted the
Defense Department would reverse its decision.</p>
<p>Last Friday, the Pentagon delivered an ultimatum to Mr.
Fields to resign, accept the transfer or be fired.</p>
