	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- ITT Corp. said net income rose 27% in the
first quarter, results it called "better than expected."
   Net income rose to $253 million, or $1.88 a share, from
$200 million, or $1.40 a share. The latest quarter included
the previously reported after-tax gain of $47 million, or 33
cents a share, on the sale of the company's investment in
Compagnie Generale d'Electricite. Without the gain, net
income would have risen 3%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Rand V. Araskog, chairman and chief executive officer,
said operating results, or income before taxes and interest,
for all businesses except electronic parts were equal to or
better than year-earlier results.</p>
<p>Sales rose 2% to $4.93 billion from $4.83 billion. The
year-earlier quarter included $139 million in sales from
businesses that have since been divested. "Despite the lower
results in some of our businesses, 1990 is off to a good
start," Mr. Araskog said.</p>
<p>ITT said defense business operating income improved
because of increased contract margins and product shipments.
Automotive gains in Europe were offset by softness in North
American markets. Fluid-technology results were flat, while
pulp and timber income improved, reflecting favorable profit
margins from log sales and higher pulp volume. Income from
electronic components declined substantially, reflecting
"continuing competitive pressures within the connector and
semiconductor businesses resulting in lower sales and
margins."</p>
<p>ITT said its equity from Alcatel N.V. "rose dramatically;"
Alcatel is a European telecommunications-equipment joint
venture with Compagnie Generale d'Electricite.</p>
<p>Earnings from service businesses declined because of "the
difficult business climate in the U.S. during the quarter."
Operating results at the Hartford insurance business rose due
to higher investment income and improved life-insurance
operations, offset by "continued deterioration" in casualty
underwriting.</p>
<p>ITT Financial had "a substantial decline" because of
increased provisions for consumer-loan losses from "portfolio
control actions and an increase in personal bankruptcies."
Results declined at the ITT Sheraton hotel operations.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
ITT closed at $52, up 62.5 cents.</p>
