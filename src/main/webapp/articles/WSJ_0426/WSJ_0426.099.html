	<p class="article-leader">Cie. Generale des Etablissements Michelin said its
consolidated net profit after payments to minority interests
climbed 3.4% to 2.45 billion francs ($430.1 million) in 1989
from 2.37 billion francs a year earlier.
   The French tire and rubber group also said it plans to
boost the net annual dividend for its publicly traded Class B
stock to 2.40 francs a share from 2.25 francs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The group's 3% earnings gain in 1989 was roughly in line
with previous forecasts by analysts, who had worried that
weakening tire demand and the firm tone of the franc against
other currencies could limit earnings growth.</p>
<p>Michelin said consolidated revenue rose 7% to 55.26
billion francs. Operating profit eased 3% to 4.7 billion
francs.</p>
