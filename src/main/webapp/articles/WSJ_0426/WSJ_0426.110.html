	<p class="article-leader">Two of the nation's biggest newspaper chains plan to
combine their national advertising sales arms into a single
jointly owned company in the wake of slumping ad revenues.
   Times Mirror Co. and Knight-Ridder Inc. said their new
company, to be called Newspapers First, will enable national
advertisers to buy space in about 40 newspapers from a single
source. The newspapers reach about 20% of all adult newspaper
readers in the U.S., the companies said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The merger is also a way to make the newspaper companies'
advertising-sales functions more efficient in response to the
decline in recent years in the number of national accounts.
"There's a smaller pool of customers because so many
companies have merged, or been bought out," said a
Knight-Ridder spokeswoman.</p>
<p>Some analysts predicted that the merger will result in the
loss of jobs of some sales people in the companies' existing
organizations. "Instead of having two salesmen call on every
national account they'll have one," predicted John Morton, a
Washington-based media analyst with Lynch, Jones & Ryan.</p>
<p>Mr. Morton said that many national advertisers "are
attracted to deals where they can cover a lot of markets with
one buy and one bill." While it wasn't clear how the
combination would affect advertising rates, Mr. Morton said
he expected that "costs per thousand" readers would be lower.</p>
<p>Company officials, who were attending an industry
conference yesterday, couldn't be reached for comment.
Spokeswomen for both companies said they weren't aware of any
layoff plans.</p>
<p>In a joint statement, the companies stressed the
advantages of the merger to advertisers. "We have an
opportunity and a determination to package and position
newspapers in a context that makes sense to advertisers,"
said G. Kingsley Anthony, president and chief executive
officer of Newpapers First, which will be formally launched
on June 4.</p>
<p>Mr. Anthony currently holds those titles at Times Mirror's
national sales affiliate, Million Market Newspapers/Times
Mirror National Marketing. John Kosanke, president and chief
executive officer of Knight-Ridder Newspaper Sales Inc., will
become executive vice president of the joint venture, which
will have headquarters in New York.</p>
<p>For its part, Times Mirror said the joint venture extends
an arrangement begun in July 1986 when its Times Mirror
National Marketing unit merged with Million Market Newspapers
Inc., a group of independent newspapers including the Boston
Globe, the Denver Post, the Indianapolis Star and News, the
Milwaukee Journal and Sentinel, the Arizona Republic and
Phoenix Gazette, the Seattle Times and the Seattle Post
Intelligencer.</p>
<p>Miami-based Knight-Ridder publishes 29 newspapers in 26
cities, including the Miami Herald, the Philadelphia Inquirer
and Philadelphia Daily News, the San Jose Mercury News, the
Detroit Free Press and the Charlotte Observer.</p>
<p>Los Angeles-based Times Mirror publishes the Los Angeles
Times, Newsday and New York Newsday, the Baltimore Sun
newspapers, the Hartford Courant, the Morning Call, the
(Stamford) Advocate and Greenwich Time. Times Mirror and
Knight-Ridder also have interests in cable television and
other businesses.</p>
