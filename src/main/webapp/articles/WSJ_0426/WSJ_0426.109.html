	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Dayton Hudson Corp. told employees of Marshall
Field's that it plans to consolidate "the majority" of the
chain's central office operations into its own
department-store operation in Minneapolis.
   Dayton Hudson, which last week agreed to buy Field's from
B.A.T Industries PLC for $1.04 billion, had been expected to
combine some operations once the acquisition is completed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In meetings with Field's employees yesterday and in
letters distributed to the staff, Dayton Hudson executives
said they would maintain a regional office in Chicago to
focus on "customer service and community involvement." The
company said other central office functions, such as
merchandise buying, would be handled through its department
store unit in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>"We know the merchandising functions will get consolidated
right away -- after closing," a spokeswoman said. "The rest
of it will take place over a period going into fall, probably
October."</p>
<p>The spokeswoman said she didn't know how many of Field's
1,700 central office staffers will lose their jobs, although
some will be offered positions in Minneapolis. Field's
employees at its warehouses and its 24 stores aren't affected
by the consolidation.</p>
<p>Still uncertain is the fate of Philip B. Miller, the chief
executive officer of Field's who led an unsuccessful bid for
the chain. Mr. Miller, who is widely credited with turning
around the chain, isn't expected to stay, because he would
likely lose his autonomy. Spokeswomen for Dayton Hudson and
Field's would say only that discussions are continuing
between Mr. Miller and the new owner.</p>
