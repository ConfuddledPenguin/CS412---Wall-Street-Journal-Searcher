	<p class="article-leader">Bond Corp. Holdings is in talks to sell its 66% stake in
Bond Corp. International to Tompson Pacific Ltd. and a group
of unrelated parties, according to the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange.
   The announcement about the Australian company, the
flagship of Alan Bond's troubled corporate empire, comes
after speculation over the fate of the investment holding
subsidiary. BCIL has sold off nearly all of its assets in the
past 18 months, keeping only its 50% stake in a Rome property
development site and a brewery in China.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The statement didn't disclose the price being discussed,
indicating only that Tompson Pacific, a property investment
and investment holding company, is in talks to buy 34.5% of
BCIL. The report also said Bond Corp. is in discussions to
place the remaining 31.5% with unrelated parties.</p>
<p>Trading in shares of BCIL and Tompson Pacific was stopped
before the start of yesterday's session and will remain
halted until further details are disclosed, the companies
said.</p>
