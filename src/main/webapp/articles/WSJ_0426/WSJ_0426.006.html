	<p class="article-leader">CHAMORRO ASSUMED Nicaragua's presidency, ending Sandinista
rule.
   After a decade of U.S. hostility toward the nation's
leftist leaders, the 60-year-old publisher took the oath of
office in Managua before about 20,000 people. In her
inaugural speech, Chamorro, a conservative elected in
February, declared a political amnesty and ended the military
draft. She also said that Gen. Humberto Ortega, the
ex-president's brother, would head the armed forces, but that
she would be the defense minister. In Washington, Bush made
Nicaragua eligible again for Export-Import Bank financing and
restored its full authority to export sugar to the U.S.</p>

rile the anti-Sandinista Contra rebels, who have signed an
accord to disarm by June 10.</p>

<p>The shuttle Discovery's astronauts sent the Hubble Space
Telescope on a 15-year mission to explore the far reaches of
the universe. After the crew overcame some balky gear, the

has limited the view of ground-based devices.</p>

<p>A woman stabbed West Germany's leading opposition
candidate, Oskar Lafontaine, during a campaign rally in

wounded in the neck. The assailant was arrested.</p>

<p>Lithuania is urgently seeking direct trade links with
Soviet regions as a way of skirting the Kremlin's cutoff of
energy supplies to the republic, which proclaimed its
independence March 11. Gorbachev, meanwhile, traveled to a
Ural Mountain industrial center in an effort to ease worker
concern over the transition to a market economy.</p>
<p>Bush rejected criticism of his refusal to act against the
Soviet Union for its crackdown on Lithuania, saying he has
"strong support from the American people." The president's
decision was denounced in Lithuania as a gesture of
appeasement toward Moscow. A spokesman said the U.S.
sympathized with Vilnius's "frustration."</p>

<p>Shiite Moslem leader Musawi urged pro-Iranian kidnappers
to continue holding their Western hostages, saying the U.S.

Musawi, believed to have played a role in Sunday's release of
Polhill, cited the House's passage Tuesday of a resolution
endorsing Jerusalem as Israel's capital.</p>

<p>Chinese Premier Li sought to minimize suggestions of an

<p>Rival Christian forces battled in residential areas of

enclave.</p>
