	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration approved
the first test kit for HIV-2, a comparatively rare strain of
the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus.
   The test kits will be used by blood banks. Because only 17
cases of HIV-2 infection have been reported in the U.S. until
now, the FDA won't require blood banks to test for HIV-2, as
they are required to do for the more common AIDS strain,
HIV-1.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the American plasma industry will probably begin
screening for HIV-2 to meet import requirements in Europe,
according to Steve Bryant, a spokesman for Genetics Systems
Corp. of Seattle, which makes the test.</p>
<p>Genetics Systems is a unit of Sanofi of France. Sanofi
purchased the company from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. a week
ago.</p>
