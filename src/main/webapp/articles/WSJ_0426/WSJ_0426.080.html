	<p class="article-leader">PROTECTING THE MARK</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>West Germany's Bundesbank is considering the means and
timing for tightening monetary policy if the July 2 monetary
union of the two Germanys threatens to weaken the mark.</p>
<p>"One can be assured that we are already thinking
intensively of what we might do, and when," said Wilhelm
Noelling, a member of the Bundesbank's policy-setting Central
Bank Council. He asserted that the Bundesbank wouldn't
hesitate to hike official interest rates if necessary, even
though such a move would be unpopular in Bonn with national
elections looming on Dec. 2.</p>
<p>"We probably won't have any reliable indications of new
price developments until autumn," Mr. Noelling said. "I am
sure that if this shows cause for concern, we will act
immediately."</p>
<p>Bonn's offer would convert East German wages, pensions and
up to 4,000 East marks of savings per person at a 1-to-1
rate. By contrast, the Bundesbank had proposed a more
cautious formula under which East Germans would receive a
1-to-1 rate for savings of up to 2,000 East marks; everything
else would be converted at a 2-to-1 rate.</p>
<p>CHANGING A NATIONAL ANTHEM</p>
<p>A Church of England proposal to scrap the pugnacious
second verse of "God Save the Queen" and replace it with
rhymes about brotherly love has created a storm of
controversy. Currently, the second verse begins: "O Lord our
God arise, Scatter her enemies, And make them fall." The
church's proposal of softer language brought this suggested
substitution from Ian Hislop, editor of the satirical
magazine Private Eye: "O Lord our God arise, And report our
enemies, To the United Nations. Make them observe treaties,
So hostilities may cease, And we all then live in peace, With
normal diplomatic relations."</p>
<p>KOITO'S INCREASED DIVIDEND</p>
<p>Japan's Koito Manufacturing Co. said it will add an extra
two yen (1.3 cents) to its regular dividend of eight yen a
share for the fiscal year ended March 31, bowing to a demand
from T. Boone Pickens. The Texas oilman became the largest
stockholder in the auto-parts company last year after buying
a holding from Japanese investor Kitaro Watanabe. Separately,
Koito announced it had increased the number of its
shareholders sufficiently to stay in the Tokyo stock
exchange's primary sector; its placement there had been
endangered by Mr. Pickens's purchases of its shares.</p>
<p>FRENCH TRANSPORT TIE-UPS</p>
<p>A national strike by France's public-service employees
prompted Air France to cancel half its medium-range flights
from Paris airports today. The one-day strike called by
unions representing France's five million public workers will
also affect the national railway system and the capital's
suburban rail networks, officials said, but most
international trains will be unaffected. A spokesman for the
Paris Metro said the capital's subway system would be
unaffected.</p>
<p>SOUTH KOREAN STRIKES</p>
<p>About 20,000 workers at South Korea's largest shipyard, a
Hyundai Group facility in Ulsan, walked off their jobs
yesterday, demanding the release of four jailed union
leaders. Elsewhere, Kia Motors Co., the nation's
third-largest car maker, was crippled yesterday when 7,000
workers staged a one-day walkout, and a protest against the
Korean Broadcasting System went into its second week.</p>
<p>BRITISH SOFT-DRINK INVESTIGATION</p>
<p>Britain's Office of Fair Trading asked the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission to investigate competition in the U.K.
carbonated soft-drinks industry. Major suppliers who will be
scrutinized are Coca-Cola Co.; Britvic Soft Drinks Ltd., 51%
owned by Bass PLC; and Schweppes Beverages Ltd., a division
of Cadbury Schweppes PLC, the OFT said. Sir Gordon Borrie,
director general of fair trading, said, "There are
indications that smaller suppliers, at local and regional
levels, are being squeezed out."</p>
<p>MORE BAD NEWS FOR BHOPAL</p>
<p>Medical facilities for victims of the 1984 gas disaster in
Bhopal, India, are running out of money and may have to shut
down, a senior state official warned.</p>
<p>Adding to problems faced by survivors of the Union Carbide
Corp. plant gas leak that killed more than 3,700 people,
Bhopal banks said they didn't have enough staff to handle
monthly relief payments ordered by Prime Minister V.P. Singh.</p>
<p>"We will be impelled to close down the hospitals and other
health-care facilities if financial assistance does not come
through soon," said S.R. Sathyam, gas-relief commissioner in
Madhya Pradesh state. He said the state government had sent
an appeal for help to the central government in New Delhi.</p>
<p>Mr. Sathyam concluded: "There is now no money to pay
salaries to the hospital staff, deliver free milk to
children, train the gas victims in various crafts and trades
and extend loans to them."</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>Britain's House of Commons cut the time limit on legal
abortions from 28 weeks, one of the most liberal in the
Western world, to 24. . . . East Germans have formed the
country's first golf association, in Dresden. There were once
about a dozen golf courses in what is now East Germany, but
none survived 40 years of Communist rule.</p>
