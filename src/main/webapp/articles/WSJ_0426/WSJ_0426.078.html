	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- President Bush, in an effort to bolster the
new government of Violeta Chamorro, made Nicaragua eligible
again for Export-Import Bank financing and restored its full
authority to export sugar to the U.S.
   But the steps will be of only minimal help to Nicaragua's
new president, who was inaugurated yesterday to succeed
Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega. The biggest and most useful
chunk of likely U.S. assistance, a $300 million dose of
foreign aid Mr. Bush requested last month, remains bogged
down in wrangling between the White House and Congress.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Bush tried to offer at least a token of direct aid to
Nicaragua yesterday by authorizing up to $2.5 million in
emergency medical assistance. The U.S. moves were timed to
coincide with Mrs. Chamorro's inauguration, at which Vice
President Dan Quayle represented the Bush administration. But
White House officials couldn't predict when the larger aid
package might be sent.</p>
<p>To make Nicaragua eligible for Export-Import Bank credits
and loan guarantees, the president signed a proclamation that
Nicaragua isn't ruled any longer by a Marxist-Leninist
government. The proclamation removes Nicaragua from a list of
nations barred from financing under a law blocking such aid
to countries with Marxist-Leninist governments.</p>
<p>White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, however, that
any financing for exports to Nicaragua still is contingent on
a ruling by the Export-Import Bank that the Central American
nation is creditworthy.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush's decision to restore Nicaragua's full sugar
import quota reverses decisions the Reagan administration
took in its efforts to turn up economic pressure on
Nicaragua's former Sandinista rulers. Mr. Reagan signed an
order in 1983 reducing Nicaragua's quota of sugar exports to
the U.S. to just 6,000 tons. Then, in 1985, Mr. Reagan
imposed an embargo on virtually all trade with Nicaragua.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush ended the broad trade embargo last month, but he
didn't move to restore Nicaragua's full sugar import quota.
The quota represents Nicaragua's share of the total amount of
sugar imports the U.S. allows. Mr. Bush's move yesterday
means that Nicaragua now will be able to export about 54,000
tons of sugar to the U.S., officials said.</p>
