	<p class="article-leader">Regarding your March 12 page-one article "Noble
Experiment: Volunteers' Distress Cripples Huge Effort to
Provide AIDS Care," AIDS volunteerism can certainly be
distressing. Some volunteers do burn out and drop out.
However, problems of overextension can be addressed with
appropriate training, close supervision, continuing support,
sabbaticals, job rotation and the setting of limits.
   The real problem with AIDS care in this country is not
"volunteer distress" or how to manage it, but the absence of
government support. As remarkable as the volunteer AIDS
effort has been all around the country, volunteerism can
never take the place of a meaningful government commitment to
addressing the epidemic, nor was it ever intended to.
Volunteers cannot build hospitals, do research or provide
medical care. Nor can they provide the political leadership
that we need at the highest levels of government.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Congress can demonstrate its commitment by expeditiously
passing the Americans With Disabilities Act, which will
provide equal treatment in employment and public
accommodations to all people with disabilities; and the
Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act of 1990, which
will provide emergency relief funds to the 12 urban areas
hardest hit by the AIDS epidemic.</p>

<p>At Kairos House (meaning " this is the moment of life"), a
resource center for the "caregivers" of AIDS patients, we
provide support groups, workshops, counseling, resource
materials and a peaceful haven away from the workplace. We
encourage caregivers to deal with their grief and stress
issues, and we emphasize healthy caring for oneself to
prevent the empty feelings and stress that precede and
accompany burnout. We also try to learn the "life lessons"
those we are caring for are offering us.</p>
