	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- A new study estimates the total market
value of bankrupt and distressed securities was about $200
billion at the end of January.
   Of that amount, about $13 billion was publicly traded,
according to a survey of 56 mostly private vulture funds by
Edward I. Altman, finance professor at New York University's
Stern School of Business.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The results of the survey, sponsored by Foothill Group, a
Los Angeles financial-services firm, were released at an
investment conference here. Foothill manages about $130
million of distressed securities in two private limited
partnerships.</p>
<p>All together, the investment firms included in the survey
manage about $5 billion of distressed securities. They target
about a 30% total return, Prof. Altman said in an interview.</p>
<p>Whereas junk-bond buyers primarily look for high yields,
"the distressed-securities investor is primarily interested
in the upside price potential," he said.</p>
<p>Although the distressed securities in the survey had a
market value of $200 billion, Prof. Altman put their par
value at about $300 billion.</p>
