	<h3>Foreigners Keep Gobbling Up U.S. Firms As Americans Have Financing Troubles</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">With many U.S. buyers hobbled by problems getting bank
debt or junk-bond financing, a steady parade of foreign
buyers continues to gobble up U.S. corporations.
   Ever since Japanese purchases of Rockefeller Center and
Columbia Pictures jolted Americans last year, foreign buyers
have kept up their acquisitions even as many U.S. concerns
have held back.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The latest examples came within hours of each other
yesterday morning when Norton Co. agreed to be sold for $1.9
billion to Cie. de Saint-Gobain of France, and a Mideast
investment concern won an auction for Saks Fifth Avenue with
a $1.5 billion bid. Both bids were blowouts that far exceeded
expectations.</p>
<p>Mike Overlock, head of mergers and acquisitions at
Goldman, Sachs & Co., said he believes foreign buyers are
gaining a greater share of the $1 billion-plus acquisitions
of U.S. concerns than in the past several years. He said
that's partly because U.S. leveraged buy-out firms have faded
from the scene.</p>
<p>Stephen Waters, co-head of mergers and acquisitions at
Morgan Stanley & Co., which advised the winning bidder for
Saks, agreed. "The collapse of the junk-bond market and the
strictures that the Federal Reserve is putting on U.S. banks
have allowed foreign buyers who aren't operating under the
same strictures to be more aggressive on pricing," Mr. Waters
said.</p>
<p>Felix Rohatyn, senior partner at Lazard Freres & Co.,
which advised Saint-Gobain, said foreign purchases of U.S.
concerns have risen "dramatically," reflecting both the
growth of foreign economies and the fact that many U.S.
companies have taken on too much debt to make purchases.</p>
<p>"It may be that foreign companies leveraged themselves
less over the last 10 years than American companies, and are
in a stronger position now to make acquisitions," said Mr.
Rohatyn. "The Europeans and Japanese have invested heavily in
their own businesses, and have grown to have the critical
mass to do these sort of things."</p>
<p>According to Securities Data Corp., five of the 10 biggest
announced bids for U.S. concerns this year have come from
foreign bidders. And foreign companies accounted for 31% of
the dollar value of all announced bids for U.S. targets.</p>
<p>Without a healthy market for junk bonds, U.S. leveraged
buy-out firms haven't been able to compete for many of the
companies that came up for grabs. This year's only big
announced LBO, a $780 million purchase of Chrysler's
Gulfstream business aircraft unit, is being done by
Forstmann, Little & Co., which has its own subordinated debt
fund and so doesn't need to sell junk bonds.</p>
<p>In the Saks auction, Bahrain-based Investcorp
International Inc. was helped by its ability to tap its own
big pools of both equity and subordinated debt, which
eliminated any need for selling junk bonds. According to
people familiar with the Saks auction, Investcorp plans to
put up about $600 million in equity and $300 million from its
own debt fund.</p>
<p>The hefty equity and debt contributions reduced the need
for bank debt to less than half of the purchase price, making
it easier for Investcorp to line up $700 million in bank debt
from a group led by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. Only one
buy-out fund, Merrill Lynch Capital Partners, bid for Saks,
in a joint venture with another retailer. Another,
Wasserstein, Perella & Co., expressed interest, but didn't
make a formal bid.</p>
<p>The runners-up in both contests also were foreign. The No.
2 bidder for Saks was a team of management and a Japanese
concern, which is said to have bid $1.3 billion -- itself at
the top of the range of expected bids. And the company
Saint-Gobain outbid for Norton was a British conglomerate,
BTR PLC.</p>
<p>J. Tomilson Hill, co-head of investment banking at
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., which conducted the Saks
auction, said that foreign acquirers such as Hanson PLC and
Grand Metropolitan PLC have generally made the kind of
drastic operating changes that eventually justified what at
first appeared to be high prices for their U.S. purchases. He
called both the Saks and Norton price tags "very full."
Saint-Gobain, however, has promised to avoid certain drastic
cost-cutting and plant-closing measures.</p>
<p>William Strong, co-head of world-wide mergers and
acquisitions at Salomon Brothers Inc., noted that foreign
companies continue to be helped in buying U.S. assets by the
weak dollar. Although the dollar has rebounded recently, it
remains nearly 40% below its 1985 peak against the yen, for
example.</p>
<p>To be sure, many takeover experts believe the appetite of
Japanese concerns for foreign acquisitions will inevitably be
curbed by this year's big 30% sell-off in the Japanese stock
market. Also, Saks was already owned by a British concern,
B.A.T Industries PLC.</p>
<p>And takeover experts said U.S. corporations that have big
cash hoards or don't already have big debt loads will
continue to be able to bid for other U.S. companies, as
Georgia-Pacific Corp. did successfully in winning its $3
billion battle for Great Northern Nekoosa earlier this year.
This past week, Dayton-Hudson Corp. won Marshall Field for
$1.04 billion.</p>
<p>One symbolic test of U.S. buyers' ability to complete
acquisitions will come when a group of unions attempts to
raise financing this summer for a $4.38 billion leveraged
buy-out of United Airlines parent UAL Corp. With UAL stock
trading far below the $201-a-share price tag, traders aren't
betting on the group's success.</p>
<p>Although foreign acquisitions sometimes ignite political
outcries in the U.S., there isn't any consensus among
economists or others on Wall Street that the purchases harm
the U.S. economy or damage the national interest. "Capital
comes into the U.S. and the jobs stay here," said one
takeover lawyer.</p>
<p>But at the moment, the same lawyer noted, "what you're
seeing now is an almost exclusively foreign market."</p>
