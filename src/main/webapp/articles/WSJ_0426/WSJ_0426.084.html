	<p class="article-leader">ENGELHARD Corp. (Edison, N.J.) -- Moody's Investors
Service Inc. said it downgraded its ratings on $100 million
in long-term debt this company, which has interests in
specialty chemical products, engineered materials and
precious-metal management services. The rating concern
lowered its rating on Englehard's notes to single-A-3 from
single-A-2 and on commercial paper to prime-2 from prime-1.
Conditions in some of Engelhard's businesses, "such as
petroleum refining catalysts, may remain difficult," Moody's
said, adding that these problems "are offset somewhat by the
company's strong positions in its core businesses."</p>
