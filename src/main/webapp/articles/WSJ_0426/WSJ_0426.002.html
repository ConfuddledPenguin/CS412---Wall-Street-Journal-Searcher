	<p class="article-leader">The beauty was only skin-deep at Wilfred American
Educational Corp.'s beauty schools in Massachusetts: On the
surface, the schools appeared to be teaching an honest trade
to people sorely in need of training. But behind the scenes,
according to federal prosecutors, the schools were conspiring
with students to defraud Uncle Sam of loan funds.
   Wilfred's Massachusetts schools have closed, though the
company continues to operate 30 schools elsewhere. Wilfred,
which denies wrongdoing, faces a 12-count mail-fraud
indictment, handed up last October by a grand jury in federal
district court in Boston. And now Wilfred may be but a
harbinger for its huge industry: The federal government and
many states are escalating efforts to crack down on the
nation's more than 6,000 trade schools. The crackdown may
hamper the schools' efforts to expand their enrollments by
exploiting recent welfare reforms sparked by Congress.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>To some, the problem illustrates a pitfall of many fields
dominated by small businesses. Like many other such fields,
the trade-school industry has a low cost of entry and
comparatively few nonfinancial barriers to hanging out a
shingle. At the same time, the huge number of players makes
it hard to regulate the field.</p>
<p>Still, agencies are trying. Illinois, California, Georgia
and Florida already approved sweeping legislation aimed at
curbing abuses at trade schools. And more than a dozen other
states, including New York, are working on comparable new
laws.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, many trade schools hate the changes.
"The states are overreacting," said Stephen Blair, president
of the National Association of Trade and Technical Schools
Inc., Washington, D.C., an industry-sponsored accreditation
agency that represents 1,345 trade schools. "There was a
nationwide problem," he concedes, but he insisted that "it
represented only 3% to 5% of all schools." The trade group is
spending $1 million to lobby against proposed laws affecting
trade schools. Also, it and other accreditation agencies are
increasing their monitoring and analysis of the schools.</p>
<p>But critics say abuses have been rife. Many schools have
shut without fulfilling their obligations to students, who in
fact are worse off because they are stuck with repaying loans
that financed their tuition. In New York state alone, more
than 120 trade schools have closed in the past three years
without fulfilling the enrollment agreement with their
students, according to Elizabeth Imholz, an attorney
representing students with claims against schools.</p>
<p>Though most of them are fairly small, for-profit
vocational training institutions receive an estimated $2
billion a year in federal funds and enroll more than 1.2
million students. Their programs purport to teach such skills
as cosmetology, computer programming and truck driving. But
some people charge many schools don't adequately provide the
skills or services advertised and are established to generate
quick profits at the expense of mostly low-income students
and taxpayers.</p>
<p>Nationwide, many of these schools follow a similar
strategy: They recruit low-income individuals, especially
those on welfare and thus eligible for maximum federal and
state aid. Many welfare recipients will soon be required to
enroll in educational training or job-related activities -- a
probable boon for the schools. But before being able to cash
in on this next funding surge, schools may face new curbs.</p>
<p>Although criticism of the industry has been steadily
mounting for the past five years, the real crackdown began
only about 18 months ago. For example:</p>
<p>-- The U.S. Justice Department late in 1988 sued
Continental Training Services, which operates a chain of
Indiana trucking schools, in federal court in Indianapolis
for $366 million, claiming it didn't qualify for federal
grants and student loans. In Indianapolis, an attorney for
the company didn't return calls seeking comment.</p>
<p>-- The New York attorney general last July obtained an
indictment against the owner of Adelphi Institute for
allegedly scheming to defraud students and falsifying
business records. The attorney for Adelphi, which isn't
related to Adelphi University, said the company is in Chapter
7 bankruptcy-law proceedings and a trustee was appointed by
the Manhattan Bankruptcy Court. The case in state criminal
court in Manhattan hasn't gone to trial yet, he said.</p>
<p>-- The U.S. Education Department last year cut off aid to
six Robert Fiance Corp. trade schools in Florida and
penalized the company $1.5 million. The trustee for the
company, which is going through bankruptcy proceedings in New
York, said all its schools have closed.</p>
<p>In some instances, students themselves take legal action
against trade-school operators. In August 1989, a federal
district court jury in Chicago awarded $640,000 in damages to
plaintiffs who sued D'or Beauty Schools Inc., Chicago, now
closed, under the Illinois consumer-fraud act.</p>
<p>On behalf of students in New York, South Brooklyn Legal
Services, a federally funded legal-services agency, last year
brought a class-action suit against MTI Business School of
Brooklyn and its owners in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn,
charging the school made false statements to induce students
to enroll and apply for government aid. Attorneys for MTI
refused to comment. This week in federal Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan, Judge Prudence Abram ordered the appointment of a
trustee to oversee MTI's bankruptcy case, filed when the
school closed last year.</p>
<p>"The industry has grown too fast," said Jeffrey Plaut,
author of a study sponsored by New York Interface Development
Project Inc., a public policy research group. "There are too
many jurisdictional bodies involved in monitoring the
business."</p>
<p>Alan Alop, a lawyer with the Legal Assistance Foundation
of Chicago who is an author of the Illinois bill, and others
are hopeful that laws being enacted will bring about reform.
The Illinois law, which went into effect last year, aims to
close down schools with low graduation rates. Schools will
have to disclose all information about their graduation rates
and success at job placement. And students who withdraw from
these programs will be entitled to tuition refunds
substantially larger than those previously given, Mr. Alop
said.</p>
