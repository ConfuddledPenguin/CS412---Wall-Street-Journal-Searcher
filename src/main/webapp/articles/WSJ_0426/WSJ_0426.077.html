	<p class="article-leader">Walt Disney Co.'s motion picture business surged in the
second quarter, ended March 31, pacing a 20% rise in net
income on a 26% gain in revenue.
   The entertainment company earned $178.5 million, or $1.29
a share, in the period, compared with $149 million, or $1.08
a share, a year earlier. Revenue climbed to $1.3 billion from
$1.04 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Disney said in Burbank, Calif., that its second-quarter
results continued its string of more than 20 consecutive
record periods.</p>
<p>Led by the strong home video showing of "Honey, I Shrunk
the Kids," "Dead Poets Society" and "Turner and Hooch," and
the performance in theaters of "The Little Mermaid" and
"Pretty Woman," Disney's filmed entertainment segment posted
a 40% rise in operating earnings to $57.8 million on a 30%
revenue rise to $469 million.</p>
<p>But its huge theme park operation and consumer products
also scored major gains, Disney said. Consumer-products
operating earnings rose 24% to $59.2 million on a 29% rise in
revenue to $124.5 million. And theme parks and resorts
recorded operating earnings of $194.5 million, up 14% from
last year, on a 22% increase in revenue to $710.3 million.</p>
<p>Disney, which for competitive reasons doesn't divulge the
number of visitors to its California Disneyland, Florida
Disney World and other theme parks, said record attendance,
higher per-capita guest spending and resort expansions all
contributed to higher operating results for that segment.</p>
<p>Further, the latest quarter lacked the benefit of the
strong Easter holiday season, which occurred in the fiscal
1989 second quarter but will bolster third-quarter figures
this year. Disney also cited the opening last May of the
Disney-MGM Studios Theme Park, near Disney World in Orlando
as a "major contributor" to this year's rise.</p>
<p>The Orlando business will begin getting its first major
test in a few weeks, however, as MCA Inc.'s Universal Studio
Tour attraction opens a few miles away. "Until now, Disney
has had a lot of studio tour (in Orlando) vs. nothing," said
Harold Vogel, who follows the entertainment industry for New
York-based Merrill Lynch Research.</p>
<p>Mr. Vogel, however, expects Disney to continue doing well
in the third quarter, as "The Little Mermaid" animated hit is
released for home video and the longawaited Warren
Beatty-Madonna film "Dick Tracy" is released in theaters.
"That's their big hope," Mr. Vogel said, adding that because
it is an expensive film, "it has to do well."</p>
<p>Earnings were announced after the stock market's close
yesterday. In composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange Disney shares closed at $111.25, up $1.</p>
<p>For the six months, net income rose 19% to $352.9 million,
or $2.55 a share, from $297.3 million, or $2.16 a share.
Revenue spurted 25% to $2.59 billion from $2.08 billion.</p>
