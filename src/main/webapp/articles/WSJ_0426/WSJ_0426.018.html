	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- Carl C. Icahn said he will purchase an
additional $800 million of USX Corp. stock if his proposed
spinoff of USX's steel business is approved by shareholders.
He said he would pay up to $48 a share.
   The New York-based investor has proposed that USX holders
approve a plan that would spin off as much as 80% of USX's
steel business as a separate company. Mr. Icahn contends that
the separation, which is to be voted on by USX holders at the
company's annual meeting May 7, would yield a combined value
of $48 a share in the two companies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>USX shares closed up $1.25 yesterday to $34 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
<p>Charles A. Corry, chairman and chief executive officer of
USX, said in a statement that Mr. Icahn's announcement
"sounded like a ploy." Mr. Corry said, "It seems to me that
Icahn is simply trying to buy votes and distract stockholders
from the serious questions that we and a number of prominent
analysts have raised about his proposal to break up USX." He
said he remains opposed to the spinoff proposal.</p>
<p>USX has said Mr. Icahn's proposal would cost the company
an additional $110 million to $120 million in interest and
insurance expenses, among other things. USX also has
disparaged Mr. Icahn's $48-a-share valuation as the result of
a "lightweight analytical job."</p>
<p>Mr. Icahn, however, insists the company is undervalued. He
said yesterday that even if shareholders approve the spinoff
and USX does not implement it, he believes USX "would have to
take some bold actions to enhance shareholder value.
Consequently, the purchase of additional USX stock
immediately following a favorable vote on the spinoff would
be, in my opinion, an excellent investment."</p>
<p>To increase his stake, Mr. Icahn said he would direct his
various affiliates to deposit $400 million with Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. so that Shearson could begin a buying
program for $800 million.</p>
<p>Mr. Icahn currently owns 13.3% of USX's shares
outstanding. A further $800 million investment at current
market prices would bring the value of his USX holdings to
nearly $2 billion.</p>
<p>He said the purchases would be made in the open market, by
tender offer or other means.</p>
