	<p class="article-leader">EAST HARTFORD, Conn. -- First Federal Savings & Loan
Association said its shareholders voted to request that
directors initiate discussions with parties interested in
acquiring the company.
   The proposal was brought before the annual meeting by the
Baupost Group of Cambridge, Mass. First Federal has $420
million in assets and nine offices.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>James D. Shelton, president and chief executive officer of
First Federal, said, "The board will undertake efforts to
initiate the shareholders' petition and to continue to
investigate other ways of maximizing shareholder value."</p>
<p>"Our earnings, asset quality and capital position are well
above Connecticut regional and national averages which, we
believe, make the institution a very valuable investment
whether it remains independent or is sold," Mr. Shelton said.</p>
