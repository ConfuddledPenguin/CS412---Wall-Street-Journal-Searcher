raised his stake in ICM Property Investors Inc. to the
equivalent of 20.2% from 19.2% of the common shares
outstanding.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Mr. Bedford said he bought 67,600 ICM common shares from
April 18 to April 23 for $6.875 to $7.125 each. The purchases
bring Bedford's stake to 1,309,350 shares, including one
million shares that he may acquire upon the exercise of an
option.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Bedford, a real estate developer, acquired his stake
in ICM, a New York-based real estate investment trust, two
months ago. At the time, Mr. Bedford said he acquired the
stake to expand his real estate holdings and make his real
estate portfolio more liquid.</p>
<p>ICM, which considers Mr. Bedford's interest friendly,
encouraged the initial Bedford investment.</p>

ICM shares closed at $7.25, up 37.5 cents.</p>
