	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- After only a month at the helm of ABC's
prime-time programming division, Robert Iger claims he was
too new to know better when he chose to go ahead with the
unlikely new series "Twin Peaks."
   The menacingly creepy murder mystery, set in a small
Northwestern town, breaks most of television's rules. It
shuns a simple plot. It has no major stars. Its characters
are beyond bizarre. Its pacing, in an era of jumpy attention
spans, is eerily languid, typical of its originator,
off-kilter film director David Lynch, a TV novice who made
the frightfully twisted cult films "Blue Velvet" and
"Eraserhead."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The early indicators on the show weren't promising,
either. ABC's own research showed an alarming 25% of viewers
gave up on "Twin Peaks" in test runs. Most of the New
York-based network brass deemed the macabre series just too
weird. But the 39-year-old Mr. Iger liked it. A Hollywood
newcomer who was thought to be a bean-counter from Capital
Cities/ABC Inc., he also saw a chance to prove his creative
reputation. So he mounted a battle to get the trial series on
the air.</p>
<p>At the moment, it appears to be the best gamble of the
season. "Twin Peaks" premiered this month as the most
talked-about, most-watched TV movie of the year, seen by
almost 35 million viewers. The media waxed rhapsodic. "Like
nothing you've seen in prime time -- or on God's earth,"
raved Newsweek. Television "has rarely seen anything as
strange -- or as superb," concurred Time.</p>
<p>With its third weekly episode airing tonight, the show has
lured the biggest audience of any ABC series in its time slot
in four years. If it can sustain its strong start -- far from
assured -- it could be a pivotal hit for the once-ailing
network, which is already gaining momentum in its effort to
close the gap with first-place NBC, leaving CBS even further
behind.</p>
<p>Even if "Twin Peaks" caves in, it has already won ABC new
cache in Hollywood as the hands-off network, eager for ideas
that are daring and different. And it has emboldened Mr. Iger
and his team to raise the bar for how strange a show can get.</p>
<p>It's as if America's embrace of the oddballs in "Twin
Peaks" has turned on a giant light bulb over the dream
factories of Hollywood. Last week, for example, Mr. Iger and
his team screened the rough cut for "CopRock," the next
series for ABC by Steven Bochco, the successful creator of
Hill Street Blues and L.A. Law. It is the first cop show done
as a musical: In the pilot a jury sings the verdict in an
original song by the sardonic Randy Newman.</p>
<p>Mr. Bochco praises Mr. Iger for taking the creative risks
openly: "He always gives you a straight answer," says the
producer. "He never hides behind the corporate `we.'"</p>
<p>Another unusual ABC pilot, "My Life and Times," has an
88-year-old man in the year 2035 looking back on our present.</p>
<p>Such experiments are critical not just to the network, but
also to Mr. Iger's attempt to fill the job previously held by
such Hollywood luminaries as Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael
Eisner, Fox Inc. Chairman Barry Diller, and producer Fred
Silverman, known in the '70s as the guy with the "golden
gut."</p>
<p>Beaming from his sun-drenched Century City office, Mr.
Iger is obviously enjoying the first blush of success. "I
feel giddy," he says.</p>
<p>In many ways he is an unlikely candidate for one of the
most powerful jobs in television. In an industry of
wide-screen egos and technicolor personalities, the onetime
TV weatherman is admittedly kind of gray. "You don't have in
me this distinctive personality," he says. In fact, the man
who shepherded the most provocative hit on the air
acknowledges, "a blandness of sorts."</p>
<p>He didn't even show any excessive interest in watching
television as a boy in Oceanside, N.Y. Instead his father, an
ad man, pushed him to read -- which he still does, most
recently wading through a two-volume biography of Churchill.</p>
<p>When he graduated from high school in 1969 he was voted
most enthusiastic, "which in 1969, when America was inflamed,
is probably something to be embarrassed about," he admits.</p>
<p>Tall, dark and camera-handsome, he attended Ithaca College
in Ithaca, N.Y., and then spent a year as a TV weatherman at
a local station. But he says he was too stiff to ad-lib on
camera. In 1974 he joined ABC, supervising studios for soap
operas and game shows. One day, he was told his boss's boss
had taken a disliking to him, and that maybe he should look
for another job. Offended, he interviewed later the same day
at ABC Sports.</p>
<p>"It drove me not to remorse, but to aggressiveness. It
was, `I've got to take care of myself,'" Mr. Iger says now.</p>
<p>And so he did. He won six promotions in 11 years at ABC
Sports and grew into a shrewd negotiator, which would come in
handy in Hollywood. From the longtime ABC Sports head Roone
Arledge, Mr. Iger learned the axiom "Never accept no for an
answer." Mr. Iger never puts a price on the table first. "I
like to be told what it takes."</p>
<p>Mr. Iger bid for the biggest events and dickered over
dozens of fight deals with the likes of Don King, the
wild-haired boxing promoter. By flattering first and
admonishing later, he learned to handle such challenges as
trouble on the set of "Roseanne." Mr. Iger describes several
"frank and fruitful" talks with the temperamental star of
ABC's No. 1 series.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1988 he moved up to a job in the
corporate group that oversees ABC. Seven months later he was
named to head ABC Entertainment, succeeding tinsel town's
beloved Brandon Stoddard, a filmmaker at heart who stepped
aside suddenly last spring to run ABC's in-house production
company.</p>
<p>In Hollywood, a change at the top means bulldozing dozens
of projects and ousting key players. Mr. Iger was happy to
inherit both kinds of assets. He has hardcore business skills
that aren't the forte of his deputies, Ted Harbert and Stuart
Bloomberg, both 12-year veterans at ABC Entertainment. They,
in turn, have creative and programming experience Mr. Iger
lacks. Mr. Bloomberg, a bespectacled, curly haired
40-year-old, oversees all new-series development. Mr.
Harbert, 34, handles current shows and scheduling. He watches
six TV sets scattered through his three-bedroom home; as a
child, he memorized the TV Guide listings every week.</p>
<p>Mr. Iger needed all the help he could get when he
parachuted into the job. He had only six weeks left to pick
new fall shows from Mr. Stoddard's pilots. One was for "Twin
Peaks."</p>
<p>The show's creators, David Lynch and TV producer Mark
Frost, had first pitched the artsy soap opera months earlier
in a 10-minute meeting with Mr. Stoddard's drama head, Chad
Hoffman. The concept: A small town is rocked by the murder of
a good girl with sordid secrets.</p>
<p>Mr. Lynch in "Blue Velvet" had given the film world the
creeps with vivid images that may never be ready for prime
time. That movie served up a severed ear and sadomasochistic
sex. In "Eraserhead" a misfit nurtures a monstrously deformed
newborn.</p>
<p>As it happened, Mr. Iger loved the director's movies.
"Blue Velvet," he explains with admiration, "slapped you in
the face. It did things to me." As for its kinkier aspects,
Mr. Iger notes, "I don't take part in such rituals, nor do I
advocate that anyone else should -- nor would I put it on the
air." But he does believe that in an era of jaded viewers
distracted by a dizzying array of entertainment
possibilities, the traditional network diet of whitebread TV
series, "may not be enough today."</p>
<p>Convincing the network brass was a bit harder. They just
didn't get Mr. Lynch's style. "I was baffled by it," admits
ABC President Mark Mandala, "but we were all 50-plus white
males." Mr. Iger suggested showing it to a more diverse,
younger group. "Unanimously, they loved it," Mr. Mandala
says. (The show continues to do well with precious
18-to-49-year-olds, as well as hooking a number of people who
rarely watch TV, and women over 50.)</p>
<p>Mr. Iger persuaded the brass to buy seven episodes at $1
million a piece -- a standard cost. Some executives took
comfort in thinking it would never get on the air. Then Mr.
Iger sought to schedule it for the spring. The final debate
came down to a bi-coastal conference call between Mr. Iger
and a room full of New York executives. Mr. Iger won, but
many of the others were still queasy.</p>
<p>"I wasn't a big fan. Bob was the one that persevered,"
says his boss, John Sias, No. 3 at Capital Cities/ABC. Mr.
Iger argued that putting the risk-taking show on the air was
critical to the image ABC was cultivating in Hollywood. "When
he says that to me, he'll get what he wants," says Chairman
Thomas Murphy. "We're only as good as the {producers} we work
with."</p>
<p>Particularly heartening to Hollywood was the fact that Mr.
Iger gave David Lynch and Mark Frost free rein. Soon they had
created a roster of odd characters -- the Log Lady clutches a
small log and may know about the girl's murder. FBI agent
Dale Cooper babbles compulsively, even about the office
doughnuts. Nadine wears a black eye patch and is obsessed
with hanging drapes.</p>
<p>Things got especially strange in last Thursday's episode:
A dream sequence had the FBI man chatting with the murder
victim -- and with a well-dressed midget who talks backward
and boogies to sleepy jazz. "Now that," says Mr. Iger's boss,
Mr. Sias, "was bizarre. Even by David Lynch standards, that
was weird."</p>
<p>Depending on whether tonight's ratings match the strong
start, Mr. Iger may decide as early as this week whether
"Twin Peaks" is a glorified fluke, or whether it can join the
ABC lineup for the new TV season that starts next fall. He
faces a bigger test in mid-May, when he must choose about six
new series from 30 pilots vying for the new fall schedule.
Unlike this year's lineup which was largely inherited from
his predecessor, next year's will have all been ordered on
his watch.</p>
<p>Some producers, their interest piqued by the creative
liberty Mr. Iger gave the creators of "Twin Peaks," are
coming to ABC. James L. Brooks, the successful filmmaker who
also co-produces "The Simpsons" and "The Tracy Ullman Show,"
on Fox Broadcasting Co., was courted by all three networks.
But he recently signed an exclusive new-series deal with Mr.
Iger, who invoked the freedom accorded "Twin Peaks" and
"CopRock."</p>
<p>Mr. Iger fashioned an unusually loose deal for the
producer. Mr. Brooks gets cash up front and doesn't have to
deliver any series by any deadline. Mr. Iger offered it
without a price, which came later. Smart ploy: "It wasn't a
matter of money at all," says producer Mr. Brooks. "It was
the atmosphere for doing the work, and how committed they
seemed to the shows that we might come up with."</p>
<p>Many of the building blocks for a turnaround are already
in place at ABC. The network has already gained ground on
Sundays with the hit "America's Funniest Home Videos,"
developed under the TV-loving Mr. Harbert. But the network
has been unable to find a follow-on show that can hold the
audience. "Elvis" flopped despite critical raves. ABC also
needs to fix a hobbling Saturday lineup and fill other gaps.
As Mr. Iger & Co. search for new shows, the question since
the "Twin Peaks" success is how far they can go.</p>
<p>An ABC pilot called "The Danger Team," for example, has a
lady private eye aided by three tiny, clay-animation guys.
They include Nitt, "a Harpo Marx type who doesn't speak but
makes noises," says Leslie Moonves of Lorimar Television,
which produced the pilot. "I can't believe I'm a grown man
having this conversation."</p>
<p>Mr. Iger, however, seems ready to err on the side of risk.
Inevitably, he will brook some failures too. Earlier this
week for example, he abruptly canceled "Capital News," a new,
though hardly daring series about a Washington newspaper,
after only a pilot and two episodes had aired. He had already
paid for a full 13 episodes and now concedes, "as a
businessman, it was a bad decision."</p>
<p>If anything, the demise of the more traditional series may
embolden Mr. Iger further on his course of provocative shows.
He professes that the only rules come down to "No rules."
"We're explorers hoping to discover something," he proclaims.
"There's always that possibility that we're going to step
beyond what the viewer wants."</p>
