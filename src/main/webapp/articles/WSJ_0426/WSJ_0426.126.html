	<p class="article-leader">Newmont Mining Corp. and its 90.1%-owned Newmont Gold
Corp. reported sharply higher first-quarter earnings, largely
due to increased gold prices and lower production costs.
   Newmont Mining, based in Denver, reported net income rose
sixfold to $57.4 million, or 85 cents a share, from $9.4
million, or 14 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose to
$165.5 million from $111.3 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Profit from continuing operations was $42.7 million, or 63
cents a share, compared with a loss of $2.7 million, or four
cents a share, a year earlier. In the latest quarter,
continuing operations included a pretax gain of $16.4 million
from a sale of shares in Newmont Australia Ltd.</p>
<p>Profit from discontinued operations was $14.7 million, or
22 cents a share, compared with $12 million, or 18 cents a
share, a year earlier. Newmont restated its earnings to
reflect its 55% interest in Peabody Holding Co. as
discontinued operations. Newmont has agreed to sell its
Peabody investment to Britain's Hanson PLC.</p>
<p>The company said it realized an average of $414 an ounce
for its gold sales, including a gain from a gold-loan
payment, up from $405 an ounce a year earlier.</p>
<p>Newmont Gold reported net of $42.5 million, or 41 cents a
share, compared with $16.5 million, or 16 cents a share, a
year earlier. Sales rose to $160.4 million from $108.2
million.</p>
