	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- Tuntex Group, a Taiwan conglomerate, said
it planned to invest $10 billion to develop a new community
on a 1,000-acre site it purchased south of here.
   A spokeswoman for Tuntex Properties Inc. USA, based in San
Jose, Calif., said the company is interviewing architects and
planning consultants to determine the best use of the
Brisbane, Calif., property, which was bought in January from
Southern Pacific Railroad for $108 million. She said
discussions have centered on a mixed-use development that
would include residential, commercial, retail and
recreational sites.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>She also said that the company is conducting an
environmental impact study on the property, of which only 500
acres is on dry land. The dry acreage is landfill, the
spokeswoman said, and California law mandates that before
landfill can be developed it must undergo rigorous tests for
pollutants, among other things.</p>
