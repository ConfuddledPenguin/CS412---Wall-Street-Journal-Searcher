	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Senate Labor and Human Resources
Committee brushed aside the objections of the food industry
and approved a sweeping consumer-protection bill that
requires nutrition labeling on all packaged foods.
   The measure also would require supermarkets and other
retail outlets to post nutrition information regarding 30
fruits and vegetables as well as raw fish and shellfish. In
addition, the bill, which passed in a 10-5 vote yesterday,
would empower the Food and Drug Administration to regulate
health claims and would authorize state agencies to enforce
federal labeling requirements.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Consumers are fed up with confusing, misleading food
labels," said Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio), chief
sponsor of the legislation. But lobbyists for the nation's
major food processors complained that the bill doesn't go far
enough in preempting state food-labeling laws.</p>
<p>"This is a recipe for consumer confusion and distribution
chaos," said C. Manly Molpus, president of the Grocery
Manufacturers of America.</p>
<p>John Cady, president of the National Food Processors
Association, said the bill is likely to provoke a floor fight
in the Senate and, if it clears Congress, to become "veto
bait" at the White House. Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter and other administration officials advocate food
labeling uniformity throughout the U.S. and federal
preemption of state laws if necessary.</p>
<p>"This bill could truly result in a Tower of Babel, with
food manufacturers required to label products differently
depending on the state to which they were shipped," Mr. Cady
said.</p>
<p>The food processors "want to stop the states from doing
things on their own where federal law falls short," said Joel
Johnson, Mr. Metzenbaum's legislative director. He said they
fear a proliferation of state laws patterned after
California's Proposition 65. Passed in November 1986,
Proposition 65 requires processors to put health warnings on
any food containing a chemical believed to pose a risk of
cancer or birth defects.</p>
<p>While the Metzenbaum bill would regulate nutrition
labeling and health claims on packaged foods, it wouldn't
cover health warnings or preempt state health-warning laws.
"It doesn't overrule Proposition 65," said Jeffrey Nedelman,
a spokesman for the Grocery Manufacturers of America.</p>
<p>Food processors also complain that the bill's
health-claims provision would be so stringent that claims
could be made for "only a handful" of food products, Mr.
Nedelman said.</p>
<p>The bill, among other things, would require disclosure of
serving size, the number of servings per container, the
number of calories per serving and the number of calories
derived from total fat and saturated fat in a serving. It
also would require processors to list the total amount of
fat, saturated fat, unsaturated fat, cholesterol, sodium,
sugar, fiber, protein and carbohydrates as well as the total
amount of important vitamins and minerals.</p>
<p>In addition, the percentage of fruit or vegetable juice in
beverages would have to be listed. Currently, nutrition
information is required only on products for which health
claims are made.</p>
<p>The bill wouldn't cover meat and poultry, which are
regulated by the Agriculture Department. It would exempt
restaurant foods, prepared foods sold in supermarkets and
delicatessens, food sold in bulk, medical foods, infant
formula, and food with insignificant nutrient content. Small
packages of food would have a partial exemption, while food
sold by specialty-food processors with less than $1 million
in sales would be exempted.</p>
<p>A similar bill, written by Rep. Henry Waxman (D., Calif.),
is pending in the House Energy and Commerce Committee.</p>
<p>Some critics see no need for the legislative initiatives.
Last month, Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan pledged swift action on a comprehensive
food-labeling package. New health-message regulations have
been proposed by the FDA for public comment, and a broad
nutrition labeling package is expected by early 1991.</p>
