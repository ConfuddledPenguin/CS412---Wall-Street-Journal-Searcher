	<p class="article-leader">OAK BROOK, Ill. -- Spiegel Inc. said first-quarter profit
rose 23% on sales that increased 20%.
   The catalog company, which is outpacing some of its rivals
in a difficult retailing environment, said net income for the
quarter was $7.8 million, or 15 cents a share, compared with
$6.3 million, or 12 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue
rose to $389.9 million from $325.2 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>John J. Shea, Spiegel's president and chief executive
officer, said the company is gaining market share by adding
new customers in all of its units. "We believe the remainder
of 1990 holds great potential," he said.</p>
<p>Spiegel, whose majority shareholder is the Otto family of
West Germany, sells apparel and household furnishings through
its Spiegel catalogs. It also operates Eddie Bauer and
Honeybee stores and catalogs.</p>
