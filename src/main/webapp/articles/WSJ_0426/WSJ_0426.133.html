	<p class="article-leader">The Canadian government authorized New York-based American
Express Co., a travel and financial services company, to
establish a bank in Canada, despite strong opposition by
Canadian banks.
   The new Amex Bank of Canada will give American Express
customers access to automated teller machines and
check-writing access to credit lines.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Canadian banks have complained that the planned bank would
be granted broader powers than those available to banks in
Canada. These include the power to promote goods and
services, including insurance. Canada's Finance Department
has repeatedly rejected the objections raised by Canadian
banks, arguing that the American Express proposal is
consistent with Canadian banking regulations.</p>
<p>The government is expected to introduce in Parliament
later this year changes in bank laws that would allow
Canadian banks to engage in some of the same activities as
American Express does.</p>
