	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Japan imported agricultural, forestry and fishery
products valued at $51 billion in 1989, up 7.9% from 1988 and
exceeding $50 billion for the first time, the government
said, citing rising grain prices and the yen's strength for
most of last year that made imports easier.
   Imports from the U.S., which has been asking Japan to open
up its market for more agricultural products, rose 9.1% to
$16.3 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Overall imports of grain and other agricultural goods last
year increased 8.3% to $29.6 billion. Those of wheat from the
U.S., where the 1988 drought pushed up prices, rose 15%,
while corn showed an 8.8% rise. Imports of U.S. beef climbed
28%. The Japanese government plans to lift restrictions on
beef imports in 1991.</p>
<p>Imports of forestry products, a subject of bilateral trade
talks with the U.S., jumped 21% from 1988 to $10.8 billion,
topping $10 billion for the first time.</p>
<p>Despite an increase in volume, though, fishery product
imports, at $10.5 billion, registered a 3.5% drop because of
falling prices of some fish.</p>
