	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Gaps are opening in Wall Street's stock
research, as more securities analysts fall casualty to the
latest round of cutbacks.
   While the number of laid-off analysts is relatively small,
compared with the thousands of clerks and others who have
been put out of work since Wall Street's recession began
after the 1987 stock market crash, the effect can be
significant for customers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Merrill Lynch & Co., for example, no longer has analysts
covering the biotechnology or defense industries. And the
firm has reduced the number of analysts following savings and
loan, steel, auto parts, paper and forest products, and
emerging growth stocks. In all, Merrill Lynch has laid off
seven analysts in New York, bringing its total of domestic
stock analysts down to 85, though still the largest of any
Wall Street firm.</p>
<p>American Express Co.'s Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. unit,
the second-largest firm, has laid off seven analysts. But no
industries are going uncovered, said Jack Rivkin, Shearson's
co-director of world-wide equities and until recently its
director of research. "In all cases, we reassigned the
coverage," Mr. Rivkin said.</p>
<p>But Shearson's staff-trimming has created gaps and
apparently left some clients feeling abandoned. Last July,
Shearson awarded special bonuses to two thrift analysts,
Allan Bortel and Gareth Plank, for their recommendation of
HomeFed Corp.; the company's stock zoomed up 47% in a year
and became one of the best performers on Shearson's annual
list of 10 "uncommon values in common stocks."</p>
<p>But within nine months, Shearson abruptly laid off the two
California-based analysts in a cost-cutting drive. Shearson
brokers whose clients still owned HomeFed shares began
calling Mr. Bortel at his home to seek advice. "I had several
calls from people who felt very much at loose ends, because
there was nobody to follow that stock," said Mr. Bortel, who
has been a thrift analyst for nearly 20 years and was named
to the all-American research team compiled by Institutional
Investor magazine for 13 years in a row.</p>
<p>Research directors at other firms said they frequently get
complaints from investors whose stocks aren't covered any
more. "You always get those complaints when you lose an
analyst who follows stocks," Alan Benasuli, director of
research at Primerica Corp.'s Smith Barney, Harris Upham &
Co., said. "It's difficult to switch coverage of those stocks
to another analyst, so you have to wait until you get a new
analyst."</p>
<p>Mr. Rivkin of Shearson argues that, in some cases, the
quality of coverage improves with consolidation. As an
example, he cited the thrift and regional bank sectors, where
regulatory differences between banks and thrifts are
diminishing.</p>
<p>After Shearson laid off Messrs. Bortel and Plank, it
reassigned the coverage to a regional bank analyst. But then
the firm suspended publication of research on big West Coast
thrifts and hasn't resumed coverage. The bank analyst, James
Rosenberg, has followed West Coast banks for eight years but
never followed thrifts.</p>
<p>Mr. Rivkin admits that cost-cutting, not improved research
quality, was the main reason that analysts were let go. After
its cutbacks, which also included a California-based
semiconductor industry analyst, Shearson still fields a team
of 75 stock analysts, second only to Merrill Lynch. And
Shearson continues to dangle analysts' research as a lure for
new customers. Shearson recently ran newspaper
advertisements, offering a research report that recommended
three stocks in the entertainment industry.</p>
<p>Some money managers are upset that Wall Street firms
encourage analysts to produce revenue by soliciting
investment banking business from the companies they cover.
This practice, they argue, makes it tougher for analysts to
make objective, critical evaluations of a company's
prospects. Others contend that layoffs since the 1987 stock
market crash have hurt the quality of Wall Street research.
"We think that the depth of coverage we're getting isn't what
it once was," a mutual fund manager in the Midwest said.</p>
<p>Despite Wall Street's research claims, no firm believes it
is obligated to cover every stock in every industry. "We're
committed to really have opinions on everything that matters
a lot in life," Michael Culp, managing director of research
at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said. "We have opinions
on 600 stocks, but we can't have an opinion on everything."
Prudential-Bache is a unit of Prudential Insurance Co. of
America.</p>
<p>But institutional investors, such as mutual funds, pension
funds and insurance companies, aren't affected as much as
individual investors if a securities firm stops following a
particular stock or industry. Institutions generally use
several different brokers to trade stocks and can pick up
research elsewhere.</p>
<p>What can an individual investor do if his brokerage firm
stops following certain stocks? He could consider switching
firms, particularly if the departed analyst went to another
firm with eager retail brokers, who sell investments to
individuals. Mr. Plank, the thrift analyst let go by
Shearson, landed at Sears, Roebuck & Co.'s Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. unit, for example.</p>
<p>Or an investor could consider switching to a
discount-commission broker and buying research from a firm
such as Value Line Inc., a unit of Arnold Bernhard & Co. This
won't necessarily save money. A one-year subscription to
Value Line, which follows 1,700 stocks and publishes about
four reports on each stock during the year, is priced at
$495.</p>
<p>For discount brokers, research cutbacks at the
full-commission firms could present an opportunity. "It's a
question, going into the '90s, whether the full-service
houses are really going to be able to sell that research
factor to the retail customer," Leslie Quick III, president
of Quick & Reilly Group Inc., a major discount broker, said.
"They're going to have to do something different than what
they're doing now."</p>
<p>Among other major firms with a significant presence in the
retail end of the securities business, General Electric Co.'s
Kidder, Peabody & Co. unit has made the biggest cuts, laying
off four analysts and hiring one. Kidder also cut back on
analyst outposts, dispensing with technology analysts in
Boston and San Francisco. In New York, Kidder laid off a
publishing analyst and a junior retail analyst.</p>
<p>R. Joseph Fuchs, Kidder's director of equity research,
described the process as "reassignment and consolidation" and
said "the word cutback, at least as far as the monetary
environment is concerned, just isn't appropriate." Mr. Fuchs
hopes to increase the number of analysts by year end, to
equal last year's total. For now, though, Kidder has 48
equity analysts, down from 51 in April 1989.</p>
<p>But two major Wall Street firms, Smith Barney and Dean
Witter, have beefed up their analyst ranks in the past few
months, and several regional securities firms are hiring
modestly.</p>
<p>At Smith Barney, Mr. Benasuli has hired 11 analysts in
recent months and laid off only three, increasing the firm's
total to 49. Most of the hiring, Mr. Benasuli said, was to
rebuild a decimated staff. "We were very lean, and we needed
to replace some of the very good people who left," he said.</p>
<p>Dean Witter has hired nine analysts and lost four for a
variety of reasons, bringing its total to 47. But Dean
Witter, like Merrill Lynch, has dropped coverage of certain
defense and aerospace companies. Dean Witter's defense
analyst has moved over to cover telecommunications services,
because investor interest in aerospace stocks is declining,
said Manny Korman, director of research.</p>
<p>Among firms outside New York, Alex. Brown & Sons Inc.,
Baltimore, has hired five senior analysts since last
September and lost only one, increasing its total to 37.
Brown, which specializes in growth stocks, has added analysts
in technology, media and communications services, retailing
and banking.</p>
