	<p class="article-leader">AKRON, Ohio -- Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.'s first-quarter
net income plunged 78%.
   The earnings drop stemmed from price competition, higher
costs from increased advertising and compensation, and lower
tire demand from auto manufacturers. That lower demand
resulted in temporary Goodyear plant closings.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Akron, Ohio-based tire maker announced earlier this
month that it would report sharply reduced earnings; the
decline was in line with analysts' projections. Net was $20.9
million, or 36 cents a share, compared with the year-ago
$94.5 million, or $1.64 a share. Sales were $2.69 billion, up
slightly from $2.64 billion a year earlier.</p>
<p>Harry W. Millis, an analyst with McDonald & Co.,
Cleveland, said he expected first-quarter net to be between
25 cents and 50 cents a share. "Profit was in line with what
I expected," he said.</p>
<p>Goodyear said previously that its oil pipeline would
decrease earnings by 50 cents a share, and the pipeline's
losses weren't reflected in the 1989 first-quarter report.
Profits were also squeezed by Brazilian government efforts to
brake inflation in that country, efforts which hurt the
company's large subsidiary there. Goodyear is also incurring
start-up costs on a tire plant in Canada.</p>
