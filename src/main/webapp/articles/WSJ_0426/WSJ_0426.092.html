	<p class="article-leader">ROSARIO, Argentina -- At lunch time at El Mayoral, a cafe
next to this city's town hall, it's hard to believe that this
is the heart of the fertile pampas that provide Argentina
with much of its food.
   "I'm hungry. I need 1,000 australs," (22 cents) reads the
note that a small girl takes from table to table. No sooner
has she left than another, about six years old, asks if she
can take the sugar that came with the coffee. In one hour, as
many beggars enter the cafe as customers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The pampa humeda {humid pampa} is the best land in the
world, and here there's hunger," says businessman Jose Andres
Lopez, a look of disbelief crossing his face. "We're close to
the biggest milk-producing lands in the world, and people
here loot supermarkets to take milk. It's incredible."</p>
<p>And yet, it's the harsh reality, not only in Rosario, but
all over Argentina as the country's slide accelerates.
Argentina has long lived under the illusion that it was a
European country somehow transplanted to the Western
hemisphere. Today, it's awakening to the fact that it faces
the same grim unemployment, hyperinflation, poverty and
looting that its South American neighbors face.</p>
<p>"We're a country on the way to underdevelopment," says
Moises Ikonicoff, Argentina's economic planning secretary.
"We're in the midst of a recession, we have an exponential
growth of poverty, we have health problems because people
don't eat enough. Our whole infrastructure is collapsing:
Half the railroad tracks are unusable, and there are no
trains or locomotives for the usable half. Schools are
falling apart, the medical system is too, and the only reason
we don't have electricity shortages is because the crisis has
made consumption fall."</p>
<p>Seeking to break the country's chronic inflation, which in
March alone reached 95.5%, President Carlos Saul Menem
recently imposed his fifth economic plan in 10 months in
office. Inflation is beginning to ebb, but the plan's results
so far amount to what economists call "stag-hyperinflation,"
a punishing combination of recession and inflation. It has
caused a drop in living standards and consumption, and a rise
in social unrest.</p>
<p>As Mr. Menem grows more and more isolated within his own
Peronist party, unions with traditional ties to the Peronists
are pressuring him to abandon his free-market policies and
return to Peronist dogma of economic nationalism.
Public-sector strikes occur almost daily, prompting Mr. Menem
this week to seek to curtail walkouts in "essential
services." Last month rioting and looting swept Rosario, 190
miles northwest of Buenos Aires, and Salta, near the Bolivian
border.</p>
<p>More ominously, the Caripintadas, a nationalistic faction
of the armed forces, are capitalizing on the discontent and
disillusionment to enter the political landscape. Members of
the group say they don't want to stage a coup, but many
Argentines think they are fanning discontent to exert
military control over the government.</p>
<p>Rosario has become the epicenter of Argentina's social
violence: Last May, 15 people were killed and scores wounded
in a week of looting, and last month, supermarkets were
ransacked and trucks carrying food were stopped and emptied
by hungry residents. The city has seen worse violence than
other Argentine cities, but the root causes are typical of
the country's impoverishment. Rosario is a microcosm of
Argentina, a country of downward mobility and deep
frustrations staring a potentially explosive social situation
in the face.</p>
<p>With its towering commodities exchange, its shopping
district and Art Deco buildings, Rosario, a city of one
million, still looks like the bustling industrial and
commercial center it once was. Situated along the Parana
River, the city was a natural outlet for the export of
Argentina's bountiful crops and meat, and by the second-half
of the past century was Argentina's second-biggest city, a
distinction it now shares with Cordoba.</p>
<p>But Rosario's growth petered out as Argentina's troubles
set in. The country's decline was hastened by the closing-off
of the Argentinian economy, beginning in the 1930s, that made
it uncompetitive internationally, economists believe. That
led to reduced domestic demand that the government tried to
cure by printing more money or borrowing abroad.</p>
<p>For Rosario, the problems started in the beginning of the
1970s, when many enterprises started being affected, says
Hugo Pasqualis, former president of the Economic Federation
of Santa Fe province. "About 800 small and medium-size
companies closed down in the 1980s, representing about
200,000 jobs," he says.</p>
<p>Today, Rosario is Argentina's capital of unemployment,
with close to 25% of the work force jobless or underemployed.
The port is almost idle as agro-industrial groups switch to
private ports elsewhere. The meat-packing and car and tractor
industries are laying off workers.</p>
<p>Whole industrial neighborhoods are eerily deserted. Slums,
known here by the poetic name of villas miserias, house 15%
of the city's population.</p>
<p>At Sipar Laminacion de Aceros, one of the city's biggest
local companies, "deliveries to the domestic market this
month didn't reach 20% of normal," says director Jose
Censabella. The company is digging into its capital to keep
its 450 employees in their jobs at 60% to 75% of their normal
pay. "But if this goes on for more than two or three months,
we'll have to reduce working hours and the work force," Mr.
Censabella says.</p>
<p>This has touched off a chain reaction in the city, leading
to impoverishment of its middle and working classes and
degradation of public services. Of the 40 or so movie houses
of a few years ago, there are now fewer than 10. Beautician
Tiziana Blati Ambrosini says she now practices for free
because nobody can pay. She lives in a small building, one
floor above her parents, who survive on a meager pension. Her
parents feed the owner of the art gallery on the ground floor
because he can't afford food.</p>
<p>Rogelio Genoglio, who runs a supermarket and butcher shop
in a blue-collar neighborhood, says meat consumption has
fallen about 30% this month. Adds Ruben Varela, president of
the supermarket and shopowners federation here: "People have
adopted a Latin American diet in the hardest-hit
neighborhoods. They eat rice, beans, lentils and corn."</p>
<p>In the villa miseria of Las Flores, the scene of the worst
looting, the Cruzero General Belgrano School, named for the
warship destroyed in the Falklands war, was supposed to
reopen last month after the Southern Hemisphere summer break.
But teachers are on strike for more pay.</p>
<p>"I earned 181,890 australs ($40) last month," says Lidia
Zamorano. "With this, we can't even pay the transport to come
here, let alone live," she says. In many schools, teachers
take turns teaching to save on transportation costs.</p>
<p>"My kids don't have shoes" to go to school, says Las
Flores resident Mirta Brenta, a 38-year-old mother of four.
"For food, I go fishing in the nearby river. Sometimes, when
I need money, I sell some fish." Mrs. Brenta doesn't have a
job. Her husband has left. Her eldest son has tried to find
work, "But all we have to say is we're from Las Flores and we
don't get jobs," she says.</p>
<p>Sometimes, she wonders if things would be better with a
military government like Argentina had from 1976 to 1983.
"Under the military a lot of people were killed, but things
were better with them," she says. "We ate, we had jobs." But,
after a pause, she adds: "Now things are so bad I'm not sure
anyone could improve them."</p>
