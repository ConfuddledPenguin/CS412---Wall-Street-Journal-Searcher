	<p class="article-leader">Laura Ashley Holdings PLC, a British retailing company,
posted a pretax loss of #4.6 million ($7.5 million) for the
year ended Jan. 27, citing declining fabric and wallpaper
sales in Britain and disappointing garment sales in the U.S.
   The deficit, compared with year-earlier profit of #20.3
million, came despite an 18% rise in sales to #296.6 million
from #252.4 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>After taxes but before extraordinary items, the company
reported a loss of #6.7 million, compared with year-earlier
profit of #13.1 million. Laura Ashley had a loss of 3.38
pence a share, compared with earnings of 6.57 pence a share
in fiscal 1988.</p>
<p>With the disappointing results and #100 million in debt,
directors decided not to recommend a final dividend and said
they are "unlikely to declare an interim dividend during the
current year." Last year, Laura Ashley issued a final
dividend of 1.50 pence. The company said it is starting a
cost-cutting and streamlining program that "might include the
disposal of certain businesses or assets, the reduction of
stock and the restriction of new shop openings."</p>
