	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Merrill Lynch & Co.'s private placement group
has been racked by key departures, just as the $170 billion
market for privately placed securities is set to explode.
   Jerome P. Greene, who headed Merrill Lynch's private
placement group for nine years, and Benjamin J. Sullivan Jr.,
a director, were hired by Benedetto, Gartland & Greene Inc.,
a small investment banking boutique formed by two former Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. executives. Philip B. Pool Jr., a
Merrill Lynch managing director, had informally agreed to
move to the boutique, as well, but switched gears at the last
moment and will remain at Merrill Lynch.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The moves, which follow two other departures from Merrill
Lynch's 15-member private placement group in recent months,
are a setback for the nation's biggest securities firm.
Merrill Lynch said it won't name a successor to Mr. Greene.
Just last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission
ushered in a new era of selling bonds and stocks in the U.S.
by approving a rule to make it easier to sell and trade
privately placed securities.</p>
<p>Wall Street securities firms are jockeying for position to
take advantage of the new rule. They see the expected bulge
in the private market as a way to offset sagging investment
banking business. Last year, Merrill Lynch ranked No. 7 in
private placements, underwriting $9.3 billion in securities
for a 5.6% market share, according to IDD Information
Services.</p>
<p>"The way of the future is the smaller boutique-type
firms," said Mr. Greene, who became a partner in Benedetto
Gartland and was added to its masthead. "The larger firms are
more like battleships and take a while to turn around," he
said. "Smaller firms get focused almost immediately on
specific opportunities or areas."</p>
<p>Mr. Greene, who ran the private placement group at Salomon
Inc. before joining Merrill Lynch, said Benedetto Gartland
plans to focus on specialty areas in the private market "that
don't fit in with the mainstream on Wall Street." These
include equity-related issues, such as limited partnership
interests; special-purpose funds, including offshore
investment funds; venture capital funds; leveraged buy-out
funds, and blind pools.</p>
<p>The hirings are a coup for Benedetto Gartland, which was
launched in 1988 by M. William Benedetto, a former executive
vice president and manager of Dean Witter's investment
banking division, and Arthur Gartland, a veteran of Dean
Witter and Kidder, Peabody & Co. In its first year, the
boutique helped complete deals valued at more than $1
billion; with the new hirings, the firm has five partners.</p>
<p>"What is going to drive the '90s is not how much capital
you can throw at a problem, but how much brainpower," Mr.
Benedetto said. "That's what we want to do."</p>
<p>Mr. Greene, 48 years old, and Mr. Benedetto have been
friends for 20 years. They met while at Salomon Brothers in
the 1970s. Mr. Sullivan, 36, joined Merrill Lynch in 1986
after a stint as vice president in Dean Witter's investment
banking department.</p>
<p>Benedetto Gartland said in a statement it had already
hired Mr. Pool, too. But Merrill Lynch yesterday managed to
persuade Mr. Pool to stay on board, according to people
familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch nevertheless has lost two other members of
its private placement staff recently. Luke Bowes moved to
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. and Jay Applegate departed
to Dean Witter. At the same time, Merrill Lynch has hired two
former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. employees, Lawrence
Alletto and David Weiss, for its private placement sales
desk.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch, for its part, said it sees financing
opportunities in the burgeoning private placement market
related to small leveraged buy-outs and private placement
funds. "We're very committed to this area and do a very
substantial business in it," a Merrill Lynch spokesman said.</p>
