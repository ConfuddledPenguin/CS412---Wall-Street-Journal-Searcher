	<p class="article-leader">MCCAW CELLULAR COMMUNICATIONS Inc. said John E. McCaw Jr.,
executive vice president of acquisitions, has 12,238,249
shares of the company's Class B common stock. His Class B
holding was misstated in yesterday's edition because of an
error by Invest/Net, a company that tracks filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The incorrect figure was
confirmed by a McCaw spokesman prior to publication, and Mr.
McCaw had declined to comment.
