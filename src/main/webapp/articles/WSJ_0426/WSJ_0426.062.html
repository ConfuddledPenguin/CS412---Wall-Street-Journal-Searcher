	<p class="article-leader">FORT WORTH, Texas -- American Airlines, looking beyond
U.S. borders for growth, unveiled its latest weapons for
doing battle in the international skies: service, seats and
food.
   With where to fly, the ordering of aircraft and the
planning of expanded airport space taken care of long ago,
the AMR Corp. unit is focusing on hardware and amenities as
it continues an ambitious $11 billion international expansion
effort inaugurated in 1983.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In presentations here and in Chicago, its two main
international hubs, American trotted out for reporters and
travel agents some of the plush features reserved for
overseas customers -- many already in use.</p>
<p>Included are wider first class and business class seats
swathed in sheepskin and capable of reclining nearly all the
way to horizontal for sleeping. The seats use foam rubber
softer than that in domestic coach seats with an especially
soft headrest that acts like a pillow. The airline also
ordered up larger blankets and plumper standard pillows. By
summer, first class seats will also get individual video
cassette recorders and electrically driven foot rests.</p>
<p>The new seats are already installed in all but three of
the carrier's 36 international aircraft -- the rest will be
finished within two months.</p>
<p>American also served up samples of its luxury food service
started earlier this year: shrimp cocktail followed by
lobster fajita (for first class) or Chateaubriand (for
business class). Dessert was a chocolate Marquis mousse
topped with shaved chocolate. The airline has hired a wine
consultant to plan menus and has bought a year's worth of
some wines.</p>
<p>By moving into international markets, American is taking
on Swissair, British Airways and Cathay Pacific, carriers
known for their luxurious service.</p>
<p>"Our ambition is to become known as the U.S. flag carrier.
We intend to compete with the best international carriers in
the world," said George Mueller, vice president of customer
service.</p>
<p>As part of its growth plan, American has ordered $7.7
billion in international jets and committed to spend as much
as $655 million to expand some of its terminals. It is
spending an additional $3.4 billion developing special
international services, hiring multilingual flight attendants
and extra airport staffs.</p>
<p>The airline last year began flights to Belgium,
Switzerland, Spain and France and stepped up its expansion
this year, buying Eastern Airlines' Latin American route
system, Continental Airlines' Miami-London route and Trans
World Airlines Inc.'s Chicago-London routes. Federal approval
of those sales are pending.</p>
