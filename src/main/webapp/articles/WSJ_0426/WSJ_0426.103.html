	<p class="article-leader">ST. LOUIS -- Anheuser-Busch Cos. reported record sales and
earnings for the first quarter but said price discounting by
competitors was resulting in company belt-tightening.
   The nation's largest brewer said net income totaled $182.5
million, or 64 cents a share, a 9.2% increase from last
year's $167.1 million, or 58 cents a share. Sales rose 8.1%,
to $2.59 billion, from $2.39 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While beer sales to wholesalers hit a record 20.1 billion
barrels, a 2.9% increase, and rose 4% at retail during the
quarter, the company said discount pricing that began last
summer requires heavy marketing expenditures.</p>
<p>To offset those costs, Chairman and President August A.
Busch III said Anheuser has implemented a hiring freeze for
the year, reduced health insurance costs and cut bonuses for
management.</p>
<p>"We believe these steps will allow us to reach reasonable
earnings growth in 1990 despite our higher level of price
promotion activity," he told shareholders at the company's
annual meeting yesterday. He termed the increased promotional
activity a short-term strategy, but added that while Anheuser
has no intention of starting a price war, it would meet
competitive pricing levels in most markets.</p>
<p>To capture sales, Miller Brewing Co., a unit of Philip
Morris Cos., Coors Brewing Co. and other competitors last
summer cut prices on premium beers. Eventually, Anheuser was
forced to meet that competition, as what Mr. Busch termed
"aggressive price promotion tactics and emphasis on low-price
beer began to hamper our ability to get retailer ad and
display space."</p>
<p>Despite those pressures, Anheuser implemented a price
increase this past February, which the competition followed.</p>
<p>Company officials also confirmed they intend to spend
about $30 million on a media campaign to stimulate sales of
its Budweiser premium beers.</p>
