	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Health and Human Services Department
submitted to Congress a bill aimed at cracking down on fraud
by drug companies.
   The bill is the administration's response to an
investigation of the generic drug industry by a congressional
subcommittee headed by Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.). The
investigation revealed alleged industry fraud against the
Food and Drug Administration and bribery of FDA officials,
and resulted in several criminal convictions of drug-company
executives and FDA officials.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Rep. Henry Waxman (D., Calif.), who heads a House
subcommittee that will consider the bill, said it "appears to
offer a constructive approach in giving the FDA new and much
needed enforcement tools." William Haddad, chairman of the
Generic Pharmaceutical Industry Association, a trade group,
said he took a "generally favorable" view of the proposed
legislation.</p>
<p>Under the administration plan, which would apply to both
generic and brand-name drug companies, individuals who
defraud the FDA would be subject to fines of as much as
$100,000 for each incident. They also would be barred from
applying for approval on new drug products for at least three
years. Currently, the FDA lacks the legal authority to bar
such individuals from the drug-approval process.</p>
<p>Drug companies that have been found guilty of defrauding
the FDA could be fined as much as $5 million for each
incident. The companies would be barred from marketing in the
U.S. for a period of two years any drugs approved while the
criminal activity occurred. This provision could be overruled
by HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan.</p>
<p>Rep. Dingell also plans to introduce a bill that would
include more mandatory penalties and would apply only to
generic drug companies, according to a congressional source.
The bill also would propose that the FDA inspector general's
office investigate wrongdoing in the generic drug industry.
Currently, the inspector general is permitted to investigate
corruption only in the government.</p>
<p>Rep. Dingell said the administration proposal was
"well-intentioned, but we're going to continue working on our
own legislation."</p>
