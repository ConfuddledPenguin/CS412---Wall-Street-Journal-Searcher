	<p class="article-leader">MONTREAL -- Bombardier Inc. is carving out a niche in the
aerospace market by buying castoff companies dirt cheap and
reviving them.
   If its pending $75 million acquisition of Learjet Corp.
goes ahead, Bombardier will have spent less than $250 million
since 1986 to buy three aerospace concerns with combined 1990
sales of about $1.4 billion. It will offer a complete line of
small jets from a tiny $3.8 million Learjet to a 50-passenger
commercial airliner.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Bombardier's acquisition of Learjet from Integrated
Resources Inc. must be approved by U.S. bankruptcy court,
which is scheduled to consider the sale today in New York.
Integrated Resources, a New York insurance and investment
concern, has protection from its creditors under Chapter 11
of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.</p>
<p>Bombardier's push into aerospace is a repeat of its
successful expansion into mass transit and passenger rail
cars, where it has become North America's dominant
manufacturer and a big player in Europe.</p>
<p>"Bombardier is an extraordinarily astute buyer. And so far
they seem to have had the management depth to get their hands
around the acquired assets," says Wolfgang Demisch, director
of research at UBS Securities Inc. in New York.</p>
<p>Known until 1974 only for its snowmobiles -- a product
invented by the late Joseph-Armand Bombardier and a market it
still dominates -- Montreal-based Bombardier now makes a wide
array of transportation equipment. New York, Boston,
Philadelphia and Vienna commuters ride on its transit and
rail cars. When the Chunnel opens, Bombardier trains will
roar under the English Channel.</p>
<p>Corporate and government chieftains fly its Canadair
Challenger business jets. In two years airline passengers
will board Bombardier's 50-seat Regional Jet. Deliveries are
scheduled to begin in 1992 to customers that include British
Airways and feeder airlines serving Lufthansa, Air Canada and
Delta.</p>
<p>Bombardier's transformation began when Laurent Beaudoin,
chairman, chief executive officer and son-in-law of the late
Mr. Bombardier, decided to go after a Montreal subway
contract in 1974 and won. He hired Raymond Royer, now
president and chief operating officer, to run the new transit
operation. Over the years the two men made mistakes,
including acquiring a locomotive company they finally sold
last year after persistent losses. But most of their moves
paid off handsomely, analysts say.</p>
<p>Among Bombardier's secrets is a disdain for pricey
research and development; it saves money by buying much of
its technology instead of creating it.</p>
<p>Bombardier made its first aerospace acquisition when it
bought money-losing Canadair Ltd. in 1986 from the Canadian
government for 120 million Canadian dollars (US$103.5 million
at current exchange rates). Before the sale the government
wrote off Canadair's debt, which included over C$1 billion of
development costs for the Challenger jet.</p>
<p>Last year Bombardier made its second major aerospace
acquisition, buying Short Brothers PLC from the British
government for about C$60 million. The sale cost the British
government C$1.56 billion in loan write-offs, grants and new
capital investment in the Northern Ireland concern.</p>
<p>Bombardier won't get that kind of bonus from Learjet's
current owner, Integrated Resources. But Bombardier would get
the Lear name, synonymous with business jets since founder
William Lear created the market nearly 30 years ago. And it
would get a company eager to say goodbye to its current
owner. "Our competitors have made hay out of the fact that
our parent is bankrupt," says Brian E. Barents, Learjet's
chairman, president and chief executive. Analysts and
industry executives say Learjet's uncertain fate has cost the
company sales and may have been one reason the U.S. Air Force
recently picked competitor Beech Aircraft Corp., a Raytheon
Co. unit, to supply training jets.</p>
<p>Bombardier officials won't discuss their specific plans
for Learjet while approval of the sale is pending. But Mr.
Royer says that Bombardier "always wants to be in the
leadership position" in each of its specialized markets. "If
we can't have that, we aren't interested."</p>
<p>Adding Learjet would more than double Bombardier's share
of a world market of 250 new business jets a year. According
to Aviation Data Services Inc., a Witchita, Kan., research
concern, in 1989 Learjet had an 11.1% share of the world
market and Bombardier an 8.3% share.</p>
<p>With Learjet, Bombardier would also become the only
manufacturer with products in all three segments -- light,
medium and heavy -- of the business jet market. "I think
they'll be the envy of the {business} aircraft manufacturing
and marketing industry. It's a natural fit," says David
Hurley, president and chief executive of Flight Services
Group Inc., a Fairfield, Conn., concern that operates a fleet
of 30 corporate airplanes, including two Challengers and four
Learjets.</p>
<p>Bombardier is much admired for its manufacturing and
marketing skills and recent turnarounds at Canadair and its
Belgian mass transit unit, BN Constructions Ferroviaires &
Metalliques S.A. Bombardier was "the savior" of Canadair's
Challenger jet, Mr. Hurley says. At Short Brothers, it's
still too early to tell how things will turn out. Mr. Royer
says he's "very pleased" with progress there. The same goes
for ANF-Industrie S.A., the second largest transit and
passenger rail manufacturing concern in France. Bombardier
acquired ANF-Industrie late last year.</p>
<p>Among the challenges for a new owner at Learjet will be
product development. Learjet's Mr. Barents says the company
has some new planes derived from existing models under
development. But some observers say Learjet's designs are
stale and it has fallen behind its competitors. "I find the
Lear the least attractive of the small jets," says Al
Conklin, a consultant in Orleans, Mass. "Their technology is
pretty far back." But Mr. Conklin says Bombardier's deal
still "sounds like a bargain," in part because there is
"definitely a value" in the Lear name.</p>
<p>To make a profit on these castoff companies Bombardier
relies on its readiness to walk away if the price isn't
right. Bombardier did just that in 1987, when Learjet's
then-owner put the company up for sale.</p>
<p>"When we do an acquisition we are always on the
conservative side," Mr. Royer explains. "The price we put on
the table is the price we can live with."</p>
<p>Bombardier's earnings were hurt by the strong Canadian
dollar in its latest fiscal year. For the year ended Jan. 31,
Bombardier reported net income of C$91.5 million, or C$1.36 a
share, on revenue of C$2.09 billion, up from the year-earlier
C$68.3 million, or C$1.03 a share, on C$1.4 billion revenue.
But operating profit was virtually flat compared with last
year's C$88.9 million, or C$1.36 a share, before a loss from
discontinued operations. On the Montreal Exchange yesterday
Bombardier Class A stock closed down 12.5 Canadian cents at
C$14.125 a share, and Class B stock closed up 37.5 cents at
C$15.125.</p>
<p>While most analysts expect modest earnings growth this
fiscal year, they are enthusiastic about the future, largely
due to the prospects for Bombardier's 50-seat Regional Jet,
or RJ. Bombardier has 126 options and orders for the plane
and thinks it can sell 400 RJs over the next 10 years.</p>
<p>Demand for this type of aircraft "will grow very rapidly
over the next decade," says Michael J. Boyd, president of
Aviation Systems Research Corp., Golden, Colo. The consulting
concern predicts a market of 1,200 RJ-class jets in North
America over the next two decades. The European market could
total 600 aircraft, Mr. Boyd says.</p>
<p>As their hub airports reach maximum capacity, airlines
will be forced to add direct flights that bypass hubs,
so-called long thin routes, Mr. Boyd says. The RJ "fits a
market that didn't exist five years ago." Bombardier's RJ is
the first jet in this class. Brazil's Embraer has announced
plans for a similar jet.</p>
<p>Despite the rapid expansion into aerospace, mass transit
and passenger rail remain a key Bombardier business. With
plants in Canada, the U.S., Austria, Belgium and France,
Bombardier is scouting acquisitions in "other key" Western
European countries and "doing our own thinking" about Eastern
Europe, Mr. Royer says.</p>
<p>Bombardier holds the North American rights to the French
TGV high-speed train technology. It's actively promoting a
proposed Quebec City-Toronto TGV rail line that would serve
as a showcase for the technology on this continent.</p>
<p>"Very few companies operate with a real strategy," says
Richard Stoneman, an analyst with Capital Group Securities
Ltd. "Bombardier has a clear idea of what they want to do and
they execute."</p>
