	<p class="article-leader">Imperial Chemical Industries PLC said a biodegradable
plastic it makes through sugar fermentation will get its
first market test in shampoo bottles to be sold in West
Germany.
   The plastic, a polymer called PHBV, has long attracted
researchers' attention but has been kept off the market by
prohibitively high production costs. The marketing test is
intended partly to learn whether demand will support the
additional production capacity that would help to bring costs
down.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Wella AG, based in Darmstadt, will use bottles made of
PHBV to package one of its Sanara shampoos, starting next
month. Wella says Sanara is a minor line, but it uses natural
ingredients.</p>
<p>"It's a very good material," said Anthony Andrady, a
materials scientist at Research Triangle Institute who
studies PHBV and other biodegradable plastics under
government contracts. He said research indicates PHBV
degrades completely in soil and sea water, and its
performance characteristics appear promising. "But we need to
find a price range the market considers reasonable," he said.</p>
<p>In addition, PHBV -- like many other biodegradable
materials -- won't degrade quickly in the dry, oxygen-poor
environment of the modern landfill. Thomas Galvin, a chemist
who manages ICI's biopolymers work, said ICI believes PHBV in
a landfill will degrade faster than commodity plastics but no
faster than paper, which can require decades.</p>
<p>Noting recent outcries about overstated claims for
biodegradable materials, plus the capital required to scale
up production, Mr. Galvin said ICI intends to proceed
cautiously. "We're playing it cozy, because it's a big
investment and because there is a lot of controversy out
there already."</p>
<p>Hans Karras, an executive at Wella's U.S. operations, said
Wella is "interested in evaluating all the possibilities in
the waste cycle." But for now, the company considers its use
of PHBV a "pilot project" to accompany its efforts to favor
materials that can be recycled.</p>
<p>At ICI's pilot plant in Billingham, Britain, production
costs run about $15 a pound. That compares with 30 cents or
less a pound for such commodity plastics as polyethylene or
polypropylene. Mr. Galvin said ICI expects to cut production
costs again, to about $7.50 a pound, when it expands the
Billingham plant this year to an annual capacity of 300 tons
from 25 tons currently.</p>
<p>He said the next step is uncertain, but if ICI later
decides to build a 10,000-ton plant, it may then be able to
slash costs to the point that selling prices for PHBV would
range from $2 to $3 a pound. At that price, he surmised, PHBV
might be competitive for use in products where the plastic
content represents a small part of the total production cost.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Galvin, ICI, a diversified chemicals
concern based in London, has developed prototype equipment to
make items including bottles and table utensils. The toughest
technique to perfect has been the making of plastic film,
such as that used in disposable diapers.</p>
<p>The PHBV itself is made by gorging bacteria called
Alcaligenes eutrophus with glucose. After the bacteria
convert the glucose to PHBV, which they store as an energy
reserve, the bacterial cells are broken open and the PHBV is
harvested. ICI says PHBV breaks down into water, carbon
dioxide and humus.</p>
<p>Mr. Galvin cautioned that even a 10,000-ton plant would be
small, producing by his estimate one-tenth the plastic needed
to make a year's supply of disposable diapers in the U.S.</p>
