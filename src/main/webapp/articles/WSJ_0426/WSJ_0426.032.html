	<p class="article-leader">ZURICH, Switzerland -- Swiss capital exports in the first
quarter surged 68% to 15.4 billion Swiss francs ($10.34
billion) from a year earlier, the Swiss National Bank, the
central bank, said in a preliminary report.
   The bulk of the growth in capital exports was accounted
for by a big increase in the volume of straight bonds, which
more than doubled, the central bank said. Overall, exports of
capital through bonds grew 79%, while loans increased 24%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The central bank attributed the increase in straight bonds
-- as opposed to convertible bonds or those with warrants
issued in Switzerland, mostly for Japanese borrowers -- to
the sharp drop on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Straight bond
issues as a percentage of total bond issues increased to 53%
from 29%.</p>
<p>Capital exports accounted for by Japanese borrowers
slipped to 40% from 50%, the central bank said.</p>
