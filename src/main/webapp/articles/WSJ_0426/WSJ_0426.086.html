	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A little-noticed provision in a fiscal 1990
spending bill before Congress serves to paper over the
short-term deficit impact of billions of dollars in working
capital needed by the Resolution Trust Corp.
   Budget analysts have estimated that as much as $28 billion
in capital could be needed by the RTC in the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1, and the Congressional Budget Office has
counted this borrowing as part of its projections for the
fiscal 1991 deficit under the Gramm-Rudman law.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The proposed amendment, which was approved by the Senate
Appropriations Committee without public discussion Tuesday
night, would sidestep the problem by changing Gramm-Rudman's
score-keeping conventions to exclude the ebb and flow of RTC
working capital from calculations of the budget shortage. The
RTC, created by last year's big thrift-industry law, needs
working capital to manage the assets of failed savings and
loans before they are sold or merged.</p>
<p>Politically, the change would help the White House and
Congress past an election-year headache. But the change is
defended too as a serious attempt to avoid what could be a
scoring nightmare beyond fiscal 1991, when revenues will
presumably begin returning to the government as assets are
sold and the White House Office of Management and Budget
would have immense leverage in saying how much the deficit
could be reduced.</p>
<p>As attached to the spending bill, the measure is subject
to parliamentary challenge on the floor, but the Bush
administration and the Congressional Budget Office apparently
have joined with the bipartisan Senate budget leadership in
backing the move.</p>
<p>Within the current fiscal year, the underlying bill
provides for nearly $3.3 billion in new spending, which would
be largely offset by $2.86 billion in reductions or transfers
from various defense accounts.</p>
<p>The administration's top priority has been securing
increased aid for Central America, but as the bill has moved
through Congress, the measure has grown to where nearly
three-quarters of the new spending would go to a variety of
domestic accounts. Among these is $185 million for a new
fingerprint-identification facility for the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, expected now to be located in West Virginia,
the home state of Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert
Byrd.</p>
