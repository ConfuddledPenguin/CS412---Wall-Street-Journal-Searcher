	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Teledyne Inc.'s board elected William P.
Rutledge president and a director of the newly streamlined
aerospace and manufacturing company. He succeeds George A.
Roberts, 71 years old, who was elected vice chairman and
remains chief executive officer.
   Mr. Rutledge, 48, had served as executive vice president
and his appointment to Teledyne's board expands it to seven
members. Mr. Rutledge and Hudson B. Drake, 55, senior vice
president overseeing Teledyne's aviation, electronics and
international operations, had been considered prime
contenders for the president's post.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Also, Douglas Grant, controller, was named treasurer and
chief financial officer. Mr. Grant, 39, succeeds Gordon Bean,
who was named vice president in charge of the company's
metals operations. Gary Riley, a group executive, 53, was
named vice president in charge of manufacturing.</p>
<p>Henry Singleton, Teledyne's chairman, announced at last
year's annual meeting his decision to step down from
day-to-day management of the multi-industry company he
founded three decades ago.</p>
<p>Teledyne recently completed the spinoff of its insurance
and finance subsidiaries into a new publicly traded company,
Unitrin Inc. Teledyne also declared a 5-for-1 stock split,
boosting the number of common shares outstanding to 55.4
million.</p>
<p>Those moves have prompted speculation by analysts and
investors that Mr. Singleton, 73, may have plans to sell his
13.1% stake in the company, sell major portions of the
company or take other major steps. In an interview, Mr.
Singleton and Mr. Roberts said they don't have any plans to
sell major assets, or cash in on Teledyne's substantial real
estate holdings.</p>
<p>Nor do they plan a big stock buy-back, another scenario
envisioned by analysts. Mr. Singleton said the company wants
to let the stock adjust to the spinoff and stock split before
evaluating any such move. Teledyne's stock closed yesterday
at $28 a share, down 62.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading.</p>
<p>Mr. Singleton and Mr. Roberts don't usually discuss plans,
but the company was careful to introduce several senior
executives at the annual meeting. Lawrence M. Harris, an
aerospace analyst with Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards, said
it was meant to show Teledyne has managers capable of running
the company when the chairman and vice chairman step aside.</p>
<p>The board also declared a regular quarterly dividend of 20
cents a share, payable May 22 to stock of record May 7. The
dividend reflects the 5-for-1 stock split.</p>
