	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- National Intergroup Inc. agreed to sell all
but 10% of its interest in National Steel Corp. to its
Japanese partner, Nippon Kokan K.K., for $147 million up
front and a like amount of deferred payments.
   The agreement ends a nearly two-year quest by National
Intergroup to sell its 50% holding in National Steel, which
it owns jointly with Nippon Kokan, and could provide the
company's embattled management with ammunition in a bitter
fight against dissident shareholders. The leading dissident,
Centaur Partners, owns 16.5% of NII common and is seeking to
elect its own slate of eight directors to the board in July.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the agreement, National Intergroup will sell the
interest in National Steel to Nippon Kokan in two equal
stages. For the initial 20%, NII will receive about $147
million, or the approximate book value of the holding at
year-end 1989. That $147 million will in turn be paid to
National Steel to cover NII's continuing liabilities from the
1983 sale of its Weirton Steel division to employees in
Weirton, W.Va.</p>
<p>The second 20% holding calls for a deferred payment
through preferred stock. The preferred issue will have a face
value of about $147 million and a minimum redemption value of
$122 million. NII will receive dividend payments from Nippon
Kokan of roughly $16 million a year on the preferred. Under
the agreement, half of the preferred must be redeemed by the
fifth anniversary of issuance, with the balance redeemable by
the 10th anniversary.</p>
<p>"This represents the final leg in our exit from the steel
business," said Stan Ellspermann, National Intergroup's chief
financial officer. He said he expects the transaction to
close by the end of June and to result in an approximate $13
million nonrecurring charge.</p>
<p>Still, Mr. Ellspermann asserted that the transaction is
favorable to NII because it provides for a $30 million
improvement in the company's cash flow annually and also
lessens its liabilities outstanding to the former Weirton
Steel division.</p>
<p>NII took its first major step out of the steel business in
1983, when it sold the Weirton Steel division. A second step
came a year later, when it sold for $292 million 50% of its
remaining basic steel business to Nippon Kokan, Japan's
second-largest and the world's sixth-biggest steelmaker.</p>
<p>Since then, though, both National Intergroup's and
National Steel's fortunes have soured. NII has recorded net
losses in six of the last seven years, a record that has been
attacked by Centaur in its advertising. Diversification
forays into the oil and drug distribution businesses have run
into difficulties. NII said the latest sale would permit it
to concentrate more fully on its drug distribution business,
which accounts for about 80% of its $3.1 billion in fiscal
1989 sales.</p>
<p>National Steel has had its troubles. Though it had net
income of $83.2 million on sales of $2.6 billion last year,
its earnings badly trail others in the industry. Productivity
gains haven't been fully achieved, partly because of a
culture clash between the Japanese and U.S. owners.</p>
<p>NII and its investment bankers are known to have
aggressively sought buyers other than Nippon Kokan but found
no takers. Many weren't interested partly because of the
lifetime employment guarantees that National Steel gave
workers in recent contracts.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, despite its recent troubles, analysts said
NII appeared to be getting a decent price for its National
Steel holding. In composite trading yesterday on the New York
Stock Exchange, NII shares closed at $15.375, up 25 cents.</p>
