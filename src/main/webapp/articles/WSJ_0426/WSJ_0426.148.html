	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. said it agrees with
analysts' estimates that per-share 1990 profit will be
between $3.25 and $3.30, adding that earnings dilution from
its merger last year should end by late 1991 or 1992.
   In 1989, the company earned $747 million, or $1.43 a share
-- including a $693 million charge related to the merger last
October of Bristol-Myers and Squibb -- on sales of $9.2
billion. Last week, the giant pharmaceutical and health
care-products company posted a 19% rise in first-quarter
earnings, to $409.1 million, or 78 cents a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Richard L. Gelb, chairman and chief executive officer,
said that although there are many areas where the two
companies have been able to combine operations,
"Bristol-Myers and Squibb didn't merge in order to save
money. Nevertheless, by the end of next year, we expect to
have achieved savings sufficient to make up in full for the
dilution. From that point on, former Bristol-Myers shares
will have the same earning power as before the merger, with
the incremental earning power of Squibb added."</p>
<p>The company's statement was apparently issued because of
investment community interest about how the merger is
proceeding.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading,
Bristol-Myers closed at $52.875 a share, up 25 cents.</p>
