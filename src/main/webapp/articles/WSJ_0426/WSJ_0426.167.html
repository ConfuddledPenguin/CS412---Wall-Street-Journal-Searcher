	<p class="article-leader">Your March 26 article on Marvin B. Roffman, the former
Janney Montgomery Scott analyst who, as you reported, was
fired because of his refusal to apologize for his negative
comments on the Taj Mahal casino project, should send a real
chill throughout the investment community.
   An analyst's role is to develop and provide an informed,
objective opinion regarding the future of a company or an
industry and make some determination about the value of the
securities of those entities. The analyst is an arbiter of
values between the issuers and the investors. He is required
to gather and sift through all types of information from
sources each with their own biases. Out of that mosaic,
looking into the future, the analyst then must put forth
predictions. Ultimately, job security, or at least
compensation, is determined by the accuracy of those
predictions.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Apparently, Mr. Roffman sustained what can be a rather
demanding career for 16 years, only to be ousted for doing
his job -- offering an opinion. I could understand firing Mr.
Roffman next February, after the cold winds had blown and he
proved to be wrong. That is a risk all analysts run. But if,
as you reported, he was fired for putting forth an opinion,
that decision brings into question the opinions of any
analyst at Janney Montgomery and, unfortunately, the opinions
of all analysts. If an analyst's job is at risk for something
other than fraud, faulty analysis or uninformed opinion then
there is limited credibility and value to the role. Once the
partisans can influence the process because of their own
fears and greed, investors -- big and small -- will suffer.</p>

<p>Mr. Roffman's statement about Donald Trump's Taj Mahal
casino won't make or break that casino. I imagine Mr. Trump
has heard negative remarks worse than this before and
laughed. It now appears he can't take the heat. Does one man,
because of his money, have the right to dictate what should
be said about him?</p>
<p>Mr. Trump should believe in what he is creating and not
let Mr. Roffman's statement bother him. Or does Mr. Roffman's
statement make sense? Does he know the market better than Mr.
Trump?</p>
<p>It was a low cut on Mr. Trump's part, to have this man
fired. Come on, Mr. Trump, grow up.</p>

<p>Janney Montgomery Scott did not hire Mr. Roffman as a
public servant, to act as an outspoken watchdog of (in this
case) the casino industry, but rather to provide objective
analysis, positive and negative, solely for the firm and its
clients. Nor did it hire Mr. Roffman in order to provide an
independent public forum for his views. He was fired for
writing a direct, unauthorized letter to Mr. Trump, for
publicly denigrating a potential client's business, and for
disregarding the explicit obligations to his employer. Janney
Montgomery asked for and received this analyst's views, and
paid for these opinions. As such, Mr. Roffman's analyses were
proprietary, and his employer was under no obligation to
release them publicly.</p>
<p>Mr. Roffman may believe that he can find a similar job in
Philadelphia or elsewhere and use that position to air his
views publicly and at will, but any brokerage or research
firm would be hard pressed to share that belief at the
expense of its reputation and its clients.</p>

<p>I congratulate securities analyst Roffman for refusing to
compromise his professional ethics at the demand of Donald
Trump.</p>
<p>Janney Montgomery certainly won't be staggered by my
personal censure for its firing of Mr. Roffman. It might,
however, become concerned if a few thousand other investors
boycotted the firm in protest. It might wish it had stood
firm in the face of the mighty wrath of Mr. Trump.</p>

<p>The morality play of Janney Montgomery vs. Donald Trump
offers, in addition to the usual lessons of the arrogance of
power on one side and moral cowardice on the other, two
prosaic ones. One is that any analyst considering issuing a
negative report on a company also had better update his
resume. The other is that investors can expect stock analyses
to be worth even less than they are now.</p>

<p>Regarding the actions of Janney Montgomery Scott's
chairman, Edgar Scott, I can only question the value of a
firm's investment recommendations when those recommendations
are based on fiat and political expediency rather than
competently performed research and competently reached
opinions.</p>
<p>I thank Mr. Roffman for standing behind his words and wish
him the best of luck in his work ahead.</p>
