	<p class="article-leader">CUPERTINO, Calif. -- Measurex Corp., citing a decline in
sales, said fiscal second-quarter earnings will be about 60%
lower than a year ago; the company said it is trimming
expenses to bolster earnings.
   The maker of computer-integrated manufacturing systems had
net income of $10.2 million, or 54 cents a share, on revenue
of $72 million, in the 1989 second quarter. The current
second quarter ends June 3.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange,
Measurex closed at $20.50, down $1.625.</p>
<p>Measurex said last month that it expected results to be
down in the quarter, but in a statement yesterday, the
company indicated that the results would be "lower than
anticipated."</p>
<p>The anticipated drop in revenue and earnings is due to
lower system sales and reduced gross margin percentages
related to lower volume and one-time costs for consolidating
certain operations, the company said. Even though
first-quarter European orders were at a record level, the
company said its delivery lead times were longer than
expected for many of its large, integrated measurement and
control systems.</p>
