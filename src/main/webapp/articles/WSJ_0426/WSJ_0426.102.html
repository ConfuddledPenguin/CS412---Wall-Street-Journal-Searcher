	<p class="article-leader">In media circles, everyone's thinking about it, but almost
no one wants to say it: The business is in a recession.
   Newspaper advertising is in the deepest slump in recent
memory. Magazine advertising is faring no better. The outlook
for broadcast advertising is unclear. Yet no one dares use
the dreaded "R" word.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It's like the old saying: If it walks like a duck, talks
like a duck and looks like a duck, maybe we should start
calling it a duck," says Spencer Plavoukos, chairman and
chief executive officer of the New York office of Interpublic
Group's Lintas ad agency. "We may not have reached the
criteria for what an official recession is, but everyone has
hit the bunkers. I don't see a major trending away from where
we ended up in 1989. I don't see {a turnaround} in 1990."</p>
<p>According to the indicators filtering out from Washington,
the economy as a whole isn't in a recession -- usually
considered two consecutive quarters of declining inflation --
adjusted gross national product. But media advertising, which
closely mirrors the economy, suggests that the indicators
aren't telling the full story. "The question is, have we,
despite what all the indicators say, already slipped into a
recession?" asks John Morton, a media analyst with Lynch,
Jones & Ryan. "Certainly the media business is having one."</p>
<p>Clearly, the outlook for most major media is bleak.
Newspaper publishers, after a dismal 1989, have been caught
by surprise by an even worse 1990 so far. In March, many were
alarmed by a falloff in advertising even steeper than the
previous two months. Publishers now are expecting at best
flat ad revenue for 1990, and perhaps a small uptick in 1991
-- although some are skeptical even of that.</p>
<p>At the just-concluded meeting of the American Newspaper
Publishers Association in Los Angeles, the mood was downbeat.
Newspaper advertising has been battered primarily by a
drop-off in retail advertising, which typically accounts for
half of all newspaper ads. Many publishers at the meeting
questioned whether retail advertising will ever return to
former levels, to the heady days before the bankruptcy-law
filings of L.J. Hooker Corp., Campeau Corp.'s U.S. unit and
other retailers.</p>
<p>Classified advertising, meanwhile, accounting for about
40% of most newspaper advertising, has shown virtually no
growth in most major markets. That weakness is particularly
troubling to publishers, because classified ads are the most
profitable type of newspaper advertising. "We are in a
recession," says Valerie Salembier, president of the New York
Post. "But no one wants to use that word."</p>
<p>The situation is similar in the magazine business, where
first-quarter ad pages dropped an average 3.5%, according to
the Magazine Publishers of America. Individual declines were
staggering, ranging from a 24.3% drop at Family Media's Savvy
Woman to an 18.4% plunge at Time Warner's People. Ad revenue
at Time Warner's magazine group, which also includes Sports
Illustrated, Time and Fortune magazines, was off about 6% to
7% in the first quarter, the company says. Magazines' major
problem: weak automotive and tobacco advertising.</p>
<p>Reginald K. Brack, who heads up Time Warner's magazine
company, concedes that the first quarter was "terrible," and
says that while the second and third quarters look "a little
stronger, I'm still not looking at a big turn upward in ad
spending." But he contends that the word recession "is
probably too strong," since previous quarters had shown
increases. "If you went two or three quarters like the first
quarter, that would be a recession," he says.</p>
<p>Still, Mr. Brack says, "it's going to be a real tough year
no matter where you are in advertising, whether it's an ad
agency or newspapers or TV."</p>
<p>The broadcast business currently is something of a wild
card. Robert Coen, director of forecasting for Interpublic's
McCann-Erickson ad agency, believes that network TV, and in
fact all mass media, have "been in a recession since 1985."
In inflation-adjusted dollars, network TV ad revenue actually
declined by 5% to 6% in 1989, he says. The networks have been
battered by an explosion of other options, like cable TV and
videocassettes, as well as by a decline in audience levels.</p>
<p>The big question now is what will happen to demand and
prices in the 1990 fall season; the "upfront" buying season
for fall begins around June. Advertising executives are
reluctant to speculate about where network advertising will
head in a year already notable for its miserable ad
environment.</p>
<p>The networks "are in a critical situation. It all depends
on how the business climate and economy is by midyear when
the upfront is negotiated," says Mr. Coen. "I think they'll
probably just about hold their head above water."</p>
<p>Mr. Coen believes the problem with the networks, along
with other mass media, is that in previous years, they
responded to strong demand by overinflating their prices, and
now are suffering through an inevitable correction. So why
won't anyone come out and call a spade a spade, if this is
indeed a recession? Says Mr. Coen, "I guess it's kindness."</p>
