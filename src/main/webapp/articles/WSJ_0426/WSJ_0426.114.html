	<p class="article-leader">Hicks, Muse & Co. said it formed a joint venture to
purchase industrial companies. The investment firm said the
venture will target companies that have been purchased over
the past two years with too much debt.
   "Our targets will be companies that require a strong
capital base and a new management direction," said Thomas O.
Hicks, chairman. "These companies will be forced to
restructure their balance sheets to survive."</p>

a former group vice president at Colt Industries Inc. Equity
financing for acquisitions will be provided by Hicks, Muse
Equity Fund, which participated last month in the purchase of
seven I.C.H. Corp. life insurance companies for $530 million.</p>
<p>HMD plans to purchase companies in the next five years
with a total of more than $1 billion in annual revenue.</p>
