	<p class="article-leader">An investment group including Fort Worth, Texas, investor
Richard Rainwater apparently won the bidding war for control
of Penrod Drilling Co., owner and operator of one of the
world's largest and most modern fleets of offshore drilling
rigs.
   Mr. Rainwater, former investment adviser to the Bass
family of Texas, owns a 24% interest in Houston-based Energy
Service Co., which said it had joined forces with R.D. Smith
& Co. to buy an additional 17.3% of Penrod's senior debt and
equity from two banking concerns for $82.7 million. The move
boosts the groups' total stake to about 68.8% of Penrod's
senior debt and equity.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ensco, a drilling and energy services concern, and R.D.
Smith, a New York brokerage and investment concern, also said
they planned to cooperate in efforts to restructure the huge
drilling company once owned by the Hunt brothers of Dallas.</p>
<p>Ensco finance manager Earl McNiel said the Ensco-R.D.
Smith group planned to continue operating Penrod as an
"ongoing franchise" and that any restructuring probably
wouldn't involve substantial changes in Penrod management.
"Penrod has a very fine operating management," Mr. McNiel
said. "They're well-respected in the industry, and that's
probably one of their strongest assets."</p>
<p>Mr. McNiel also said the Ensco-R.D. Smith group planned to
continue negotiations toward the purchase of 31.2% of Penrod
debt and equity still owned by a group of Hunt creditors led
by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., a unit of Manufacturers
Hanover Corp.</p>
<p>The debt and equity interests involved in the most recent
transaction included a 6.9% stake formerly held by Bankers
Trust Co., a unit of Bankers Trust New York Corp., which an
Ensco-affiliated limited partnership purchased for $33.1
million. Other Ensco partnerships and an R.D.
Smith-affiliated trust jointly acquired the 10.4% debt and
equity interest of Citibank, a unit of Citicorp, for $49.6
million.</p>
<p>"It just seemed to make a lot of sense to join forces and
pick up these two pieces that were available," Mr. McNiel
said of the move.</p>
<p>Previously, Ensco and R.D. Smith had separately been among
a large group of bidders eager to buy Penrod from the Hunt
creditors. Among the other bidders were Houston-based Rowan
Cos., an oil services concern said to have made a $325
million offer, and New York's Tisch family, reported to have
made a $450 million bid through its Loews Corp.</p>
<p>According to persons close to the Penrod talks, most of
those other parties have now dropped out of the bidding. "We
sort of left it in the dust long ago," said a person involved
with one of the bids. "These prices are much too high for
us."</p>
<p>But with offshore rig counts up sharply in recent months,
industry analysts seemed to agree that the additional
investment was a good move for the Ensco-R.D. Smith group.</p>
<p>"This is one of the true quality fleets in the offshore
industry," said Sam Albright, an analyst with Howard Weil.
"If this cycle continues to gain momentum, the fact that they
may have paid full price won't make any difference two years
from now."</p>
<p>Penrod's 89-rig fleet includes 39 offshore rigs, many of
them relatively new. During the 1980s, the Hunt brothers
borrowed heavily to modernize and enlarge the Penrod fleet,
amassing more than $760 million in debt. Coupled with other
losses, those debts forced the family trusts owning Penrod to
seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection.</p>
<p>The Hunts lost operating control of Penrod in a 1988
settlement with creditors and turned their remaining 50%
interest in Penrod over to creditors last month.</p>
