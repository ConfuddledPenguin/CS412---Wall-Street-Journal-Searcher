	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Sales at Japan's major retail stores in March
declined 2% to 1.762 trillion yen ($11.09 billion),
reflecting an unusually high level of sales a year earlier,
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said.
   The year-to-year drop was the first since February 1985,
when sales fell 0.6%. The extended expansion of Japan's
economy, led by domestic demand, has pushed up retail sales
in every month since.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Overall retail sales remained at a high level in March and
the basic upward trend in sales is unchanged, an official
said.</p>
