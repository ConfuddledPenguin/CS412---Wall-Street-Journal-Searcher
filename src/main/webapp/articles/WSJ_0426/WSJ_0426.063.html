	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The Tokyo Stock Exchange is applying pressure
to halt, at least for now, the further sale of warrants
allowing investors to bet on the direction of the Japanese
stock market.
   Reacting to these concerns from the Tokyo exchange, U.S.
underwriters and the American Stock Exchange, where
previously issued warrants are being traded, are expected to
voluntarily refrain from offering more of these instruments
to the public. The warrants have been blamed for adding to
the volatility in the Japanese stock markets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Any pullback of this kind requested by Japanese financial
officials could exacerbate the debate in the U.S. and Europe
about how much Japan is willing to let market forces dictate
price movements in the Tokyo securities market.</p>
<p>An exchange official in Tokyo said the exchange has had
discussions about the warrants with the Amex. The official,
who asked not to be identified, said that the decision to
withhold future issues includes warrants that profit from
either a rise or fall in the Nikkei index of 225 leading
stocks that trade in Tokyo.</p>
<p>While the Tokyo exchange hasn't any regulatory authority
over securities issued in the U.S., it maintains an
information-sharing agreement with the Amex, through which
matters relating to the two markets are discussed.</p>
<p>Ivers Riley, Amex senior executive vice president, says
his exchange "would proceed cautiously" when and if another
application for a Nikkei warrant comes before the exchange.
"We value our relationship with the Japanese markets and want
to maintain a liaison with them, and would want to be
sensitive to their marketplace."</p>
<p>Currently, Goldman Sachs & Co. is planning to underwrite
an issue of 7.5 million Nikkei put warrants -- which rise in
value with a fall in the Nikkei index -- to be sold by
Norway's export-finance agency.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs said it couldn't comment because the
offering was in registration, but Amex officials said there
wasn't any reason to think the issue wouldn't come to market.
However, it might be the last for a while, according to
people in the U.S. underwriting community.</p>
<p>The New York Stock Exchange and the Pacific Stock Exchange
have applied to the Securities and Exchange Commission to
trade Nikkei warrants. A spokeswoman for the New York
exchange said she was unable to determine late yesterday the
status of the application. The Pacific exchange said it is
awaiting SEC action.</p>
<p>The Tokyo exchange has also asked individual U.S.
investment banks in the U.S. to refrain from underwriting
more warrant issues for the time being.</p>
<p>"At this point in time we are complying with the TSE
request not to issue any more Nikkei warrants," said a
spokesman at Salomon Inc., which has issued two Nikkei
put-warrant issues and one call warrant issue. Call warrants
increase in value with a rise in the Nikkei stock index. The
Salomon spokesman said the subject "will be revisited" with
the Japanese soon.</p>
<p>Like an option, a warrant gives the holder the right, but
not the obligation, to sell or purchase a security, currency
or, in this case, the cash equivalent of the Nikkei index at
a specific price on or before a specific date.</p>
<p>There is a heated debate in financial and academic circles
over the effect of the Nikkei warrants on the prices of
securities traded on the Tokyo stock market. The first
warrants to be issued were puts, which rose sharply in value
as the Japanese stock market tumbled more than 25% this past
winter. It has since recovered a bit.</p>
<p>There is a feeling among some U.S. securities firms that
the Nikkei warrants are being fingered as a scapegoat for the
volatility in Japan. One U.S. investment banker said that
stocks are sold in the Tokyo market to hedge Nikkei put
warrants when they are first created, but that Japanese
stocks are bought as a hedge when the warrants are exercised.</p>
<p>"Lately, there have been a lot more warrants exercised
than have been created, so the net effect of the warrants
over the last couple of months has been to stabilize a weak
market," the investment banker contended.</p>
<p>The Tokyo exchange official said, "We are in the middle of
investigating whether or not {Nikkei warrants} have had an
influence" on Tokyo stock prices. Japan's Ministry of Finance
is also studying the matter.</p>
<p>While only about a half-dozen Nikkei warrant issues have
been sold to American investors, as many as 25 issues have
been sold during the past two years in Europe, where they
trade on an over-the-counter basis.</p>
<p>Underwriters in London say the question of a "Nikkei
warrant moratorium" hasn't been raised there because there is
not much demand at present for the warrants in the
Euromarket. But an official at one of the leading securities
houses in Europe said each warrant issue is discussed with
the Japanese Ministry of Finance before being brought to
market.</p>
<p>"If it's felt that such an issue wouldn't be looked
favorably upon by the Japanese parties concerned, we would
hold back," the official said.</p>
<p>In addition, many Nikkei put warrants have been sold
privately to institutional investors in the U.S. and abroad.</p>
