	<p class="article-leader">CUYAHOGA HEIGHTS, Ohio -- American Steel & Wire Corp. said
it received letters of commitment for $95 million of
financing.
   The steel rod and wire maker said the money will be used
to pay for capital spending, working capital, refinancing
debt and for paying a possible special cash dividend of as
much as $4.25 a share. The company said its board will weigh
the special payout, once it completes financing
documentation.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Financing will come from Security Pacific Business Credit
Inc., Sanwa Business Credit Corp., State Bank of South
Australia and Cigna Investments Inc.</p>
<p>American Steel & Wire is composed of three former USX
Corp. plants acquired in 1986 through a leveraged buy-out.
The company went public two years later and now is
50.7%-owned by Chicago West Pullman Corp., a Cincinnati-based
transportation and manufacturing concern controlled by Roger
W. Ach II, a businessman.</p>
