	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A federal judge in Tucson, Ariz., issued a
ruling that could blunt a savings-and-loan regulation that
limits how much a thrift may lend to any one borrower.
   U.S. district Judge William Browning ruled that
Mississippi Savings Bank, Batesville, Miss., must return
$749,775 to a borrower that had put up that amount as
security in a line-of-credit contract. The $1.7 million line
of credit exceeds the amount Mississippi Savings may lend to
a single borrower under the new regulation, which stems from
last year's S&L restructuring law.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Judge Browning issued a preliminary injunction against
Mississippi Savings, ordering the return of funds to the
borrower, All American Finance Co., Tucson.</p>
<p>The judge, however, stopped short of ordering Mississippi
Savings to fund the full $1.7 million contract. But he said
that on the strength of its contract, All American is likely
to prevail on the merits in a trial. The judge further
blocked federal regulators from taking action against the
thrift's officers for seeking to honor the lending agreement.</p>
<p>Although Judge Browning didn't deal directly with the
so-called loan-to-one-borrower regulation, this was the
second time a federal judge has undercut strict new
provisions of the S&L bailout law. An earlier ruling held up
the industry restructuring when it was determined that the
director of the Office of Thrift Supervision wasn't
constitutionally appointed. That ruling was rendered moot
when the Senate confirmed a new OTS director early this
month.</p>
<p>Yesterday's ruling could lead to further litigation, or
even a change in the regulation, which was issued on an
interim basis one month ago. The loan-to-one-borrower
regulation limits the amount a thrift may lend to any
borrower to 15% of its capital, or $500,000, whichever is
greater. A final regulation is expected next month.</p>
<p>An attorney for the thrift office said he didn't believe
this decision will affect the loan-to-one-borrower
regulation, because it simply returns the security to the
borrower that the thrift held under the contract. "The
decision doesn't say whether the judge intends to abrogate
the contract or not," the thrift office attorney said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Mississippi Savings declined to comment
immediately after the ruling.</p>
<p>The case illustrates how the regulation places many
thrifts in a legal bind. When Mississippi Savings tried to
fund its line-of-credit contract to All American, the Office
of Thrift Supervision blocked it by issuing a
cease-and-desist order. And the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. said that because Mississippi Savings was violating the
new regulation, it could no longer raise funds through
brokered deposits, a volatile source of funding that requires
regulatory approval.</p>
<p>All American, which services and sells auto and consumer
loans, felt it had a simple contract case. "We are an
innocent third party being damaged by an action taken by the
Office of Thrift Supervision," said Helen Davis Chaitman, an
attorney for All American.</p>
<p>The judge agreed. "To unilaterally destroy otherwise
solvent enterprises who deal with government-regulated
businesses with impunity and without judicial scrutiny
seriously undermines public confidence," his ruling said.</p>
