	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- Even by hype-happy Detroit standards, Ford
Motor Co.'s marketing push for its first all-new Escort in 10
years seems a bit outlandish.
   John LeFere, a dealer in Jackson, Mich., plans to launch
the car this afternoon with "blast-off smoke and astronauts"
at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
Michigan Space Center, where the program for the first
official day of sales includes whisking away an old Escort by
helicopter. In New Orleans, the first Escort sold today will
be delivered on the aircraft carrier Cabot, anchored in the
Mississippi River.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Moreover, for the first time, some of Ford's United Auto
Workers union employees will be fanning out nationwide to
help sell the cars that they built.</p>
<p>Such hoopla may seem excessive for a simple subcompact.
But at a time when subcompact sales generally are shrinking
and the number of competitors is expanding, Ford must "make
sure we get everybody's attention," says Thomas Wagner,
general manager of the auto maker's Ford division.</p>
<p>Top Ford executives, in fact, are calling Escort's launch
the most important in the auto maker's history -- strong
words considering they bet the company in the early 1980s to
develop the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable.</p>
<p>But the success of the new Escort, which was engineered by
Ford's Japanese partner Mazda Motor Corp., will indirectly
shape how much Ford can spend to bring out new vehicles later
in this decade, Mr. Wagner acknowledged yesterday during the
latest of the three dozen news conferences that Ford has held
over the past three months to promote Escort.</p>
<p>Under federal fuel-economy standards, Ford must sell a
large number of Escorts in order to sell more of its
gas-guzzling, but highly profitable, luxury cars. "If we
can't sell the big cars, that attacks profits," says Mr.
Wagner. "And that attack on profits attacks our ability to
fund new product programs in the middle-1990s," he says.</p>
<p>As a result, Ford officials say they have little margin
for error in the 500,000 sales they have projected for Escort
and its Mercury Tracer twin next year. Reaching such lofty
targets on a single car line in today's increasingly
fragmented U.S. market will be difficult. For the decade of
the 1980s, Escort was the best-selling car in the U.S., with
deliveries peaking in 1985 at 524,488 Escorts and Mercury
Lynxes, the companion car at the time. After that, Escort
sales steadily slipped as a result of dated design and
tougher competition.</p>
<p>The new Escort faces a far different U.S. market than the
one its predecessor encountered during the mid-1980s. For
starters, U.S. car buyers are far less interested in
subcompact cars now, because energy-crisis fears have
subsided. Auto makers sold nearly 1.3 million of the small
cars five years ago; subcompact sales last year totaled
926,213.</p>
<p>In addition, the number of strong competitors has soared.
Honda Motor Co. sold 13% more Civics last year than in 1985,
while sales of Toyota Motor Corp.'s Corolla jumped 19%. Other
cars, such as the Hyundai Excel and Suzuki Swift, weren't
even available in the U.S. in 1985.</p>
<p>Then there's Mazda's new 323 and Protege, which are based
on virtually the same platform as the Escort and share key
parts including transmissions, suspensions and, in some
cases, engines. Ford and Mazda have tried to distinguish the
cars in appearance, road-feel and features. But the base
Mazda 323 is less expensive, starting at $6,599, compared
with the Escort's base price of $7,565.</p>
<p>All this causes some Ford officials to concede they have a
daunting task before them, especially because the new
Escort's outward appearance isn't much different from the old
Escort. However, Ford did change the appearance of the Escort
station wagon, giving it the look of a shrunken Taurus
station wagon.</p>
<p>Still, critics say the new Escort may not turn a lot of
heads because it doesn't represent a big leap forward in
subcompact styling, though it has a much lower hoodline to
improve road visibility for drivers.</p>
<p>Ford officials say the conservative styling reflects a
concern that major changes would alienate traditional Escort
buyers -- and drive up costs. As it is, Ford is spending $1.9
billion on Escort's makeover, and the car will be a money
loser for Ford because of heavy price competition in the
subcompact market and the fuel-economy pressures to sell the
car.</p>
<p>To help buyers understand how Escort has changed, Ford
took the unprecedented step of putting potential customers
behind the wheel of the car long before today's introduction.
For the past five weeks, Ford has been holding ride-and-drive
programs for consumers picked by some 250 Ford dealers
nationwide. Such sneak-peeks generally are reserved only for
automotive journalists.</p>
<p>"We wanted to get potential customers driving the cars as
soon as we could because a lot of the changes people will
notice are under this new car's sheet metal," says Bobbie
Koehler, the Ford division's mechandising manager. Those who
didn't get an early look at the cars weren't able to see them
until today. Ford forbade dealers from putting new Escorts
out in showrooms until the launch. Some dealers even went
back to the practice common in the 1950s of covering showroom
windows before the models appeared today.</p>
<p>The ride-and-drive program, the 20 nationwide launch
ceremonies including the blast-off in Jackson and the warship
in New Orleans, and the 36 news conferences may sound like a
lot. But they're only the start of Ford's marketing blitz for
its new Escort.</p>
<p>Between now and June, Ford car advertising will focus
almost exclusively on the subcompact. The ad campaigns for
Escort and Tracer will likely cost $100 million -- eclipsing
the $90 million record set with the debut of the Taurus and
Sable in late 1985.</p>
<p>"The bottom line is we have to sell all of these cars in a
big way," Mr. Wagner says. "We have no choice but to make
them successful."</p>
