	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- British Petroleum Co., the biggest producer in
Alaska's giant oilfields, said it could quickly boost its
output there as much as 10% to offset an oil shortage in the
U.S.
   In an interview, James Ross, chief exeuctive officer of BP
America Inc., said that as much as 200,000 barrels of
additional daily crude production might be squeezed from
Alaska's Prudhoe Bay, the nation's biggest oilfield, and
nearby fields.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We have a little (room) to increase," Mr. Ross said. Such
increased Prudhoe Bay production could temporarily replace as
much as 25% of the oil the U.S. had been importing from Iraq
and Kuwait. The additional Alaskan production could come into
play in the fourth quarter, Mr. Ross indicated.</p>
<p>BP made the calculations in response to an inquiry from
the Energy Department. Mr. Ross said the question was part of
a survey of major U.S. oil producers to ascertain how much
additional oil can be produced quickly from flagging U.S.
oilfields. Output from Prudhoe Bay began to decline last
year.</p>
<p>Mr. Ross said that additional wells could quickly be
drilled into existing Alaskan oil reservoirs. But he warned
that sustaining such a high level of output for long could do
serious damage, including reducing the amount of oil
recoverable in the long run.</p>
<p>In addition to sinking new wells, he said, if operators
are given permission by the state to burn off natural gas
that is normally produced along with oil, output from
existing wells could increase. Currently, operators are
required to reinject the gas underground to conserve that
natural resource. Mr. Ross said environmental restrictions on
such flaring would have to be waived.</p>
<p>As for world-wide markets, Mr. Ross said he believes that
if only 50% of the four million barrels a day currently lost
from Iraq and Kuwait could be made up, supply disruptions
probably could be averted. He maintained that sufficient oil
inventory exists world-wide to meet needs through November if
that much additional production can be found.</p>
<p>But he cautioned: "Any other shock to the supply system
would clearly throw us into a supply crisis."</p>
<p>Mr. Ross said believes that Iraq may have more support in
the Arab world than is immediately apparent and thus is
bracing for a long stand-off in the Middle East. "Anyone
believing that this (crisis) will be over within the next
couple of months will be in for a considerable shock," Mr.
Ross predicted.</p>
<p>He argued that the U.S. and other consuming nations must
be ready to head off supply shortages as fast as possible,
and noted that he and other industry executives are urging
Energy Department officials to prepare to activitate the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve quickly if the need arises.</p>
<p>Mr. Ross said he recently unsuccessfully urged Henson
Moore, deputy energy secretary, at least to make the
necessary procedural preparations immediately. "By getting
the administrative machine ready, we would be prepared to
inject oil into the market overnight,"he said, adding: "Even
small quantities of the oil would have a calming effect on
the market."</p>
