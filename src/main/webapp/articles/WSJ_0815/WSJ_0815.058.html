	<p class="article-leader">"My diary was written not only from a need not to forget
but also as a kind of warning: for those who have never left
their homeland, for those who have never shed innocence, for
those who cannot imagine the loss of freedom, this book is a
reminder that there is another side of night."
   -- Juliana Pilon, from the foreward of "Notes From the
Other Side of Night"</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As a teen-ager, Mrs. Pilon and her family escaped
Ceausescu's Romania and a decade ago wrote about a return
trip. Vigilant as she might have been about governments that
persecute, Mrs. Pilon could not have imagined the nightmare
she and her husband, Roger, would endure because of the U.S.
government, because of the Justice Department no less.</p>
<p>The story of what happened to the Pilons is partly a tale
of how people in Washington can be victims of "ethics"
charges. They were falsely and publicly cited in an ethics
report by the Justice Department for the serious crime of
leaking classified documents to the South African government.
The most curious aspect of the case is that this report was
issued after the Justice Department had cleared the Pilons.</p>
<p>To his credit, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh last month
approved an apology to the Pilons and an unprecedented
$25,000 settlement. On the other hand, the problem remains of
unexplained misfeasance -- or malfeasance -- by ethics
officers whose power shields them from internal scrutiny.</p>
<p>The Pilons were central-casting quality young Reaganites.
They met as philosophy graduate students at the University of
Chicago. When they came to Washington, Mr. Pilon served in
several positions, including head of Justice's Asylum Policy
and Review office. The trouble began in 1987 when Mrs. Pilon,
who was at the Heritage Foundation, was nominated to become
an assistant secretary of the interior. There was a problem
in her background check. The FBI set up simultaneous but
separate interviews with the Pilons, demanding to know if Mr.
Pilon had leaked to his wife a State Department document,
"Report to Congress on Communist Influence in South Africa."
She was asked if she then passed it on to a South African
diplomat.</p>
<p>Both denied the accusations, but according to the Pilons,
officers from Justice's ethics office, the Office of
Professional Responsibility, told Mr. Pilon his security
clearance had been lifted and he was put on leave. Mrs.
Pilon's nomination was eventually withdrawn. Finally, the
Pilons say, ethics chief Michael Shaheen told Mr. Pilon to
resign or be fired. The Pilons' lawyer, Terrance O'Donnell,
proposed that he be allowed to see the evidence and produce a
classified rebuttal.</p>
<p>Mr. O'Donnell's report went all the way to Attorney
General Edwin Meese, who ordered a review of the allegations.
In September 1988, a top Justice aide, Dee Benson, sent a
letter dropping all charges and reinstating Mr. Pilon. The
letter said "no implications adverse to you should be taken,"
thanking him for "the outstanding cooperation and patience
you have demonstrated." Mrs. Pilon, who now runs the National
Forum Foundation, guesses that the FBI wiretapped a
conversation in which she offered a South African diplomat a
copy of a Heritage Foundation study about Soviet activity at
the United Nations.</p>
<p>Mr. Pilon, who is now with the CATO Institute, recalls
that the investigation "was so psychologically debilitating
because we were never told what the problem was, and so were
always flailing at shadows." The most bizarre aspect of what
the Pilons call their Kafkaesque experience is that it only
got worse after the charges were dropped.</p>
<p>This past November, Mr. Shaheen's office issued its annual
report on ethics investigations. It described four
"representative" investigations of the more than 400
conducted during the year. The first described a Justice
lawyer who "was the subject of a foreign counterintelligence
investigation." The report said the investigation found "that
sufficient cause existed to terminate his political
apppointment." No names were used, but reporters quickly
learned it referred to Mr. Pilon. This was the first public
mention of the case.</p>
<p>The Pilons were outraged. Mr. Pilon told a congressional
committee that power had "corrupted" Mr. Shaheen. Mr.
Thornburgh had his deputy, Donald Ayer, investigate. This
past March the Pilons were cleared for the second time, with
Mr. Ayer noting that Mr. Pilon had returned to his job
"unconditionally." Mr. Ayer then sent a follow-up letter in
April saying that "the OPR report was erroneous in certain
particulars, but that Michael Shaheen and OPR cannot be
faulted in any way." This did more than leave open the
question of whose fault it was. Mr. Ayer was soon forced to
resign in part, according to Mr. Thornburgh's aides, because
he had no authorization to clear Mr. Shaheen.</p>
<p>Mr. Thornburgh ordered a third review of the case. The
latest apology plus the cash settlement was issued by
Assistant Attorney General Stuart Gerson, who says Justice
wanted to "do the fair thing" by covering the Pilons' legal
costs.</p>
<p>The mystery remains how the ethics office could have
issued a report smearing the Pilons. Ethics officials knew
the details of the case. Mr. Benson, who is now the U.S.
Attorney in Utah, confirms that he had informed
representatives from the ethics office back in September
1988, that the investigation of the Pilons had ended with no
evidence of wrongdoing.</p>
<p>If Mr. Shaheen issued the annual report despite knowledge
that Mr. Pilon had been cleared, this might be a case of J.
Edgar Shaheen. Mr. Shaheen has been the only director of the
post-Watergate ethics office, which was formed in 1976.
Longevity may breed a dangerous insularity. Mr. Shaheen did
not return phone calls.</p>
<p>No one at the Justice Department seems very interested in
digging deeper to find out how the false ethics report could
have been issued. They may not want to be accused of somehow
interfering. Or maybe they fear being smeared themselves; the
ethics office has initiated investigations of several past
attorneys general. It's worth noting, though, that Mr.
Shaheen's office may be redundant. Last year, Congress forced
several departments, including Justice, to create an office
of inspector general to investigate alleged wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Mr. Pilon would like to get to the bottom of all this and
says, "it is appalling that there are not better
institutional protections against this kind of abuse." Mrs.
Pilon's book meanwhile will be published this year in Romania
and Poland. Maybe she should add a postscript reminding the
newly liberated countries that justice does not always come
easily even in the most advanced nations.</p>
