	<p class="article-leader">LITTON INDUSTRIES Inc. (Beverly Hills, Calif.) -- Moody's
Investors Service Inc. said it lowered its ratings on the
company's senior debt to Baa-2 from Baa-1, and on
subordinated debt to Baa-3 from Baa-2. The Prime-2 rating on
commercial paper was confirmed. Moody's said its action is
based "on the expectation for lower operating margins because
of the constraints in defense spending expected during the
next several years, as well as the slowdown in demand for
industrial automation equipment from the automotive
industry."</p>
