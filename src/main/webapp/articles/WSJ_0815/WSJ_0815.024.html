	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The international showdown with Iraq, so far
largely a boon to Israel, may well generate some problems for
the Jewish state in the long run.
   The crisis has strengthened dramatically the bonds between
the U.S. and moderate Arab states, particularly Saudi Arabia
and Egypt, a trend that always makes Israelis wonder about
America's devotion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>More important, the U.S. now is likely to feel more
obliged to heed those Arab states' pleas to do something
about the Palestinian problem. Saudi and Egyptian leaders are
sure to argue that their survival in the Arab world is
imperiled unless they can demonstrate that their American
friends aren't concerned only about guarding oil fields with
jet fighters but also about solving Arabs' broader political
grievances using diplomacy.</p>
<p>And that could translate into more pressure on Israel for
negotiations over the fate of Palestinians in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>"Part of the due bill is going to be the desire of those
Arab states we're working with to do something on the
Palestinian question," says Robert Hunter, a National
Security Council adviser on the Middle East under the Carter
administration who is now an analyst at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies.</p>
<p>And if the focus does shift toward the Palestinian issue
when the dust settles, arguments now being used by the Bush
administration to oppose Iraq's invasion of Kuwait may well
cut politically against Israel. "If the U.S. opposes the
acquisition of territory by Iraq, it may very well be pushed
over time to do more about Israel's occupation of the West
Bank and Gaza," says Rep. Lee Hamilton (D., Ind.) chairman of
the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on the Middle East.</p>
<p>Sen. William Cohen (R., Me.), ranking Republican on the
Senate Intelligence Committee, says "the immediate impact is
a positive one for Israel, but in the long run, you're likely
to see a unified Arab effort to bring the focus back to the
issue of annexation, including Israel's occupation of Arab
land." Sen. Cohen also says rising oil prices could focus
U.S. anger on Israel, and the Arabs could press for a Mideast
nuclear arms-control treaty.</p>
<p>And beyond politics, of course, there remains the distinct
risk that Iraq may choose to draw attention away from its
occupation of Kuwait by launching an attack on Israel,
forcing Israel into a fight that could expand into a broad
war with the Arab world.</p>
<p>For the time being, though, Iraq's invasion of Kuwait is
handing Israel clear short-term political benefits. It has
diverted world attention from the search for a solution to
the Palestinian problem -- a search that was creating growing
friction between Israel and the U.S. And the Iraqi move has
added credence to Israel's longstanding assertion that it is
a stable U.S. ally stuck in a "dangerous neighborhood," Rep.
Hamilton says.</p>
<p>There are likely to be some long-term benefits for the
Jewish state as well. Israel is proving its worth with a
steady stream of intelligence for the U.S., which could earn
President Bush's gratitude. And no matter what the outcome,
the Iraqi invasion has cooled the U.S. attraction to
Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat, who
has strongly backed Iraq. Some think these benefits will make
the Iraqi move a net plus for Israel, even after the dust
settles. "One of the things it has done in this country is
remind people of the instability of the Arab world and
therefore the strategic importance of Israel," says Greg
Schneiders, a Democratic consultant and pollster.</p>
<p>"We have really been the preachers about this Iraqi danger
for the past 18 months," Israeli Ambassador Moshe Arad said
in an interview. He and other Israeli diplomats here feel
comfortable with Israel's low-profile role; the ambassador
has seen Secretary of State James Baker twice this week
already.</p>
<p>But there are a couple of potential flashpoints that could
have Israel and the U.S. at odds soon, with Israel sorely
tempted to raise its profile in the conflict -- against U.S.
wishes.</p>
<p>First, Saddam Hussein could "Israelify" his fight by
moving even a token number of tanks or warplanes into Jordan,
which separates Iraq from Israel. Israeli leaders have
repeatedly warned, even before Iraq invaded Kuwait, that the
entry of Iraqi forces into Jordan would be a "causus belli,"
an act that would trigger an Israeli strike at Iraq, Jordan
or their forces.</p>
<p>Israel's Air Force commander recently warned both Iraq and
Jordan that such a move would be "playing with fire."
Israel's leaders consider having Iraqi forces in Jordan
unacceptable because they would be in a position for a quick
strike at Israel.</p>
<p>One Israeli official says bluntly that "we want to stay
out of it, but once highly important security interests of
Israel are in danger, I don't think anyone would expect us to
stand by."</p>
<p>President Bush might be distinctly unhappy with any
Israeli military strike, which could widen or deepen the
conflict and color it as a joint U.S.-Israeli assault on
Arabs. But Israel's hard-line government rarely backs off
when it is convinced the Jewish state's very survival is on
the line.</p>
<p>Saddam Hussein might also draw Israel into the conflict
with more limited or ambiguous moves. For instance, he could
send non-combat support units into Jordan, or terrorists into
Israel itself. If Israel reacted to such lesser moves by
hitting Iraq or Jordan, the Arab anger and U.S. irritation
might be even worse.</p>
<p>The second potential for Israeli involvement concerns
Iraq's growing complex of plants and laboratories dedicated
to producing ballistic missiles and the chemical and nuclear
warheads they would carry. Israel has been itching to destroy
these buildings and might use any pretext to do so --
including a threatening Iraqi move far from its borders.</p>
<p>The U.S. also sees elimination of the Iraqi
advanced-weapons industry as one goal of its current
confrontation. But the Pentagon might prefer to do the job
itself, in its own way and at a time of its own choosing,
rather than have Israel repeat the daring 1981 air strike
that shattered Iraq's former nuclear-weapons research center.</p>
<p>But even if the standoff with Iraq ends peacefully, there
could be complications for Israel. For starters, Saudi
Arabia's decision to invite tens of thousands of heavily
armed U.S. troops to guard the kingdom and Egypt's related
move to organize an Arab military force undercut contentions
by Israel's supporters that moderate Arabs would shy away
from teaming up openly with the U.S. in a Middle East crisis.</p>
<p>"At first, the Israeli government could take some
satisfaction in these events," says Samuel Lewis, a former
U.S. ambassador to Israel. "But the demonstration of our
strategic links to the gulf countries undermines the
longstanding Israeli argument that none of our Arab
connections would ever be useful if they were needed."</p>
<p>And regardless of whether Iraq or the U.S. prevails in the
current showdown, the focus seems likely to shift to the
Palestinian question eventually. If Saddam Hussein emerges
unscathed, he clearly wants to be seen as undisputed leader
of the Arab world and as champion of the Palestinian cause.
Rather than dealing with a moderate over the Palestinian
issue, then, Israel would find itself facing the Arab world's
toughest operator. "I think now he'll be more active and
energetic on the Arab-Israeli peace issue because he sees
himself as the Arab leader," says Richard Murphy, former
assistant secretary of state for the Middle East. "They {the
Israelis} might come to regret not being further ahead" in
the peace process.</p>
<p>And even if the U.S. forces Iraq to back down, the Bush
administration will be under pressure to alleviate Arab
disquiet over the huge U.S. military presence in the Persian
Gulf by moving on the Arab-Israeli peace issue. "We will be
under some pressure to demonstrate that friendship with the
U.S. for a moderate Arab government pays off with a revival
of the peace process as well as checking Saddam Hussein's
ambitions," says William Quandt, a former National Security
Council analyst now with the Brookings Institution.</p>
