	<p class="article-leader">Air Products & Chemicals Inc. said the sale of equity in
an energy project will produce a one-time gain of $6 million,
or 11 cents a share, in the fourth quarter ending Sept. 30.
The company said this shouldn't affect analysts' consensus
operating earnings estimates of about $55 million, or $1 a
share, for the quarter and about $215 million, or $3.88 a
share, for the year.
   Air Products, based in Allentown, Pa., said the gain will
come from the sale of a 50% equity interest in a $190 million
cogeneration plant under construction in Cambria County, Pa.
The transaction to Energy Investors Fund LP of Boston, Mass.,
is valued at $30 million, which will produce a $6 million
gain in the fourth quarter.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Cambria facility will burn waste coal to generate
electricity and steam that will be sold under 20-year supply
contracts. Air Products and its equity partners have invested
$1.2 billion in six environmental and energy projects. The
sale of equity provides Air Products with additional
financing, accelerated cash flows and improved tax benefits.</p>
