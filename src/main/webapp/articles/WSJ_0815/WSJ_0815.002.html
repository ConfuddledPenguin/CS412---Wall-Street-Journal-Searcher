<p>Is on its way to Kalamazoo,</p>
<p>The cocktail lounge is pouring belts</p>
<p>For folks who'd rather be somewhere else,</p>

<p>-- Dick Emmons.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Pilgrims' Progress</p>
<p>You become even more impressed with the achievements of
our Founding Fathers when you realize they did it all without
opinion polls.</p>
