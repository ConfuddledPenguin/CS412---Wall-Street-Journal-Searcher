	<p class="article-leader">The West German heavy engineering group Deutsche Babcock
AG expects to post an as yet unspecified pretax loss for its
fiscal year ending Sept. 30, after suffering a 15 million
mark ($9.5 million) loss in the six months ended April 30.
   "We have hard times ahead of us," Oberhausen-based
Babcock's new chairman Heyo Schmiedknecht said. At around the
start of fiscal 1990, Babcock had expected to post a pretax
profit of between 50 million and 70 million marks for the
full year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We must reckon on a clear pull-back of our financial
results," the 51-year-old executive said, adding that "we are
expecting a loss" before taxes for 1990.</p>
<p>The company reported back in May that it suffered an
undisclosed pretax loss in the first five months of its
fiscal year and that it didn't expect a profit for the full
year.</p>
<p>In fiscal 1989, Deutsche Babcock's net income fell 91% to
3.8 million marks from 40 million marks a year earlier. The
sharp decline prompted Babcock to omit its regular annual
cash dividend for fiscal 1989.</p>
