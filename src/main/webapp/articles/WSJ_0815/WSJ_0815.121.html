	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- Gap Inc., heading off a general slump in
retailing, expects to report more than a 30% increase in
fiscal second-quarter net on a 24% increase in sales.
   Donald Fisher, chairman and chief executive officer, said
in an interview that net for the period ending Aug. 4 would
be more than 30% higher than net of 40 cents reported in the
year-earlier second quarter. He said sales in the latest
quarter were $405 million, up 24% from $326 million a year
earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts had expected Gap to earn in the range of 45 cents
to 50 cents a share. The results are also somewhat surprising
because the apparel company got such a poor start to the
quarter. Comparable store sales rose a disappointing 6% in
May as inclement weather doused the traditional beginning of
the summer buying season. After the May report, some analysts
reduced estimates of second-quarter net for the company to as
low as 33 cents.</p>
<p>Mr. Fisher said warmer weather and strong consumer
acceptance of new merchandise in mid-June helped to correct
things. Comparable store sales rose 24% in June and 28% in
July -- and a strong 19% increase for the quarter. Margins
were "very, very good" because of the popular new merchandise
and the reduced need for discounting, he added. Mr. Fisher
also cited "meaningful" progress at the Banana Republic
division, a perennial money-loser that should turn a profit
this year.</p>
<p>For the first half, Mr. Fisher said, Gap expects to report
earnings at least 35% higher than the 83 cents reported a
year earlier, on a 27% increase in sales to $807 million from
$636 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>He said "our goals for the second half are more modest
than the first half" because of the uncertainty with the
economy. But he said Gap hopes to still outperform the
industry. Gap expects to operate roughly 1100 stores at
year-end compared with about 960 a year earlier; Mr. Fisher
said the company is considering additional expansion in
Europe and has been "looking around" in Japan.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Gap closed at $55.25, down 50 cents from Monday's
close.</p>
