	<p class="article-leader">A federal judge ruled that a group of treasure hunters can
keep the largest trove in American history -- gold found in a
ship that sank 133 years ago off South Carolina.
   U.S. District Judge Richard Kellam in Norfolk, Va., ruled
yesterday that Columbus-America Discovery Group, a private
marine-exploration company based in Columbus, Ohio, is the
owner of a cache of thousands of mint-condition gold coins
and rare gold bars valued at between $450 million and $1
billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Judge Kellam rejected the arguments of eight insurance
companies and the state of New York's acting superintendent
of insurance that they owned the gold because they had paid
out claims arising from the 1857 disaster.</p>
<p>Before the ruling, only nations had been found to have
deep-ocean salvage rights in international waters. Lawyers
said that the court's decision to grant individuals the same
rights could affect future exploration of the deep sea and,
ultimately, outer space.</p>
<p>In addition, Judge Kellam's decision is significant
because he allowed the group to establish ownership of the
treasure using remote video cameras to produce live images
and robots to retrieve objects. Previously, courts had ruled
that ocean explorers had to physically dive to a site to
stake a claim.</p>
<p>"The decision is a major development in the law. This
makes it clear that individuals are free to explore the deep
ocean and enjoy the benefits of their discoveries," says
Richard Robol of the Norfolk law firm Hunton & Williams,
which represented Columbus-America.</p>
<p>Douglas A. Jacobsen, a partner with the New York law firm
Bigham Englar Jones & Houston, which represented the
insurers, said that if the decision is upheld, "it means that
the game is one of finders keepers. We are opposed to that
idea. Owners' rights still exist. Just because something has
been gone for a long time doesn't mean the ownership title is
lost."</p>
<p>The judge also dismissed claims filed by rival treasure
hunters Harry John and Jack Grimm, as well as the trustees of
Columbia University, who alleged that the Columbus-America
group misappropriated their research about the ship's
location.</p>
<p>The bitter legal battle was spawned by the discovery of
gold in 1989 in the wreck of the S.S. Central America, a
luxury steamship that sank in 8,000 feet of water, 160 miles
off the coast of South Carolina.</p>
<p>Bearing three tons of California gold and 476 passengers,
many of them prospectors returning from months in the gold
mines, the S.S. Central America steamed into a hurricane on
its way to New York. Passengers and crew spent 30 desperate
hours bailing water. Women and children escaped to a passing
vessel; the men stayed on.</p>
<p>Only 166 passengers survived. Many were dragged to the
bottom of the Atlantic, weighed down by heavy gold money
belts they refused to remove from around their waists.</p>
<p>At the time of the sinking, many banks teetered on the
verge of collapse. Officials had stemmed the rising financial
panic with announcements that the Central America's gold
shipment was due soon. The sinking touched off a wave of bank
failures and unleashed the "Panic of 1857," a major economic
downturn.</p>
<p>Searches for the ship turned up nothing, and over the
years the gold became one of the most sought-after treasures.
The Columbus-America group's quest began in 1981 and has
already cost more than $10 million. The money was put up by
166 investors, most of them from the Columbus area.</p>
<p>The search was masterminded by Thomas G. Thompson, a
research scientist with Columbus think tank Batelle Memorial
Institute, who believed that newly available technology used
by the Pentagon to find lost submarines could be applied to
treasure hunting, making deep-sea recovery economically
feasible for the first time.</p>
<p>Using a remote-controlled, 5,000-pound robot sprouting an
arm and video cameras, Mr. Thompson's group searched a
1,400-square-mile area. The group was hampered by bad
weather, mechanical failures and the fact that it initially
focused on the wrong site.</p>
<p>But in 1989, Mr. Thompson arrived at the Norfolk port
bearing a ton and a half of booty. That find set off a kind
of gold rush, as other parties sought a share of the
treasure.</p>
<p>In his decision, Judge Kellam did not dispute the fact
that insurance companies may have paid out claims. But he
said the eight companies had intentionally abandoned their
rights to any recovery when they destroyed records relating
to the sinking of the ship. The insurers comprise two U.S.
concerns, Atlantic Mutual Insurance Co. of Murray Hill, N.J.,
and Insurance Co. of North America, a unit of Cigna Corp. of
Philadelphia; and six British companies.</p>
<p>Judge Kellam said the companies had kept no copies of
insurance policies, invoices for shipments, or other records
in order to establish a claim for the gold. He said there was
no indication that the companies had attempted to recover the
ship and that newspaper accounts of the amount of money paid
by insurance companies contained too many discrepancies to be
considered reliable proof.</p>
<p>"They had no hope or idea they could locate the Central
America, and even if they located it, they had no hope they
could recover anything from it," Judge Kellam wrote.</p>
<p>Mr. Jacobsen, who represented the insurers, said that no
one would intentionally give up their rights to a cargo of
gold and that he will recommend that his clients appeal.</p>
<p>Judge Kellam's ruling also dismissed the claims of
treasure hunters Messrs. John and Grimm and Columbia
University. The judge ruled there was no evidence that Mr.
Thompson used their results from a 1984 survey of the ocean
floor done during a search for the Central America and that
they were therefore not entitled to any share of the
recovery. A lawyer for Messrs. John and Grimm said he will
recommend an appeal. A lawyer for Columbia said the
university hadn't decided yet whether to appeal.</p>
<p>Mr. Thompson said it will take at least another year
before all the gold is brought up from the bottom of the
ocean. In the meantime, it seems unlikely that the judge's
decision will put an end to all the confusion. Mr. Thompson
has been sued by California treasure hunter Dennis A.
Standefer, who alleged he provided research that led to the
gold's recovery and is seeking a share of Mr. Thompson's
reward. The case was recently dismissed, but Mr. Standefer is
appealing. Mr. Thompson's wife is also claiming a share of
the gold in their pending divorce proceedings.</p>

<p>STATE JUDGES focus on resolving asbestos litigation.</p>
<p>Although recent actions by federal judges have put
asbestos personal-injury litigation in the news, most of the
cases are before state courts. Working in conjunction with
some of the federal judges, three state judges from New York,
Baltimore and Philadelphia have begun planning a conference
for this fall at which about a dozen judges from across the
country will meet.</p>
<p>"Nothing is more important to the state judiciary than the
resolution of this asbestos problem," said Judge Marshall A.
Levin, a Maryland state circuit court judge in Baltimore. The
huge backlog of asbestos personal-injury cases has the
potential "to wreck the court system," he added.</p>
<p>Many judges have become frustrated with the growing
backlog of asbestos cases and fear that some defendants may
run out of funds before all the claims are paid. Asbestos,
once used in shipbuilding and construction, causes cancer and
respiratory ailments.</p>
<p>Of the estimated 100,000 asbestos personal-injury cases
now pending in U.S. courts, about two-thirds are before state
judges. Although some state judges may be reluctant to give
up their control of such cases, Judge Levin said he believes
most welcome the possibility of a national settlement that
would include the state cases. The federal judges pursuing a
national resolution of the cases have indicated that they
expect state judges to come on board.</p>
<p>"It will lighten our burden considerably," clearing the
way for state courts to handle more criminal cases as well as
other civil litigation, said Judge Levin. Judge Levin has
5,300 asbestos cases pending.</p>
<p>The other two state judges working closely with Judge
Levin are Justice Helen Freedman of Manhattan and Judge
Sandra Mazer Moss of Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Justice Freedman said she expects the state judges to
focus on alternative ways to encourage the parties to settle
the suits and avoid going to trial. She said a
claims-resolution system needs to be set up to ensure that
the more seriously ill claimants are paid first and to speed
up the compensation process.</p>
<p>Separately, the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals
yesterday upheld a freeze on payments by the Manville
asbestos personal-injury trust. The decision strengthens the
authority of U.S. Judge Jack B. Weinstein, who has asserted
control over the trust.</p>
<p>Some asbestos victims' attorneys had requested that the
freeze on settlement and judgment payments be lifted, arguing
that Judge Weinstein had overstepped his jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The trust, formed in the bankruptcy-court reorganization
of Manville Corp., told the appeals court it supported the
freeze while it works out a way to solve its huge cash
shortage.</p>
<p>The freeze ends Sept. 6, the deadline Judge Weinstein set
for the trust to come up with new financing.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>SETTLEMENT FUND to be used for public interest law
fellowships.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Ann Claire Williams of Chicago ruled
that a $6 million surplus from the settlement of the
folding-carton industry antitrust litigation should be used
to pay graduating law students and judicial clerks to provide
legal services to the poor.</p>
<p>Alexander Domanskis, a partner with the Chicago law firm
Ross & Hardies, says this may be the first time a settlement
fund will be used to finance a nationwide public interest
program. Mr. Domanskis is a member of a four-lawyer
administration committee appointed by the judge to draft an
outline for the fellowship program.</p>
<p>The federal court's order is the latest in protracted
legal maneuvering over the surplus from an 11-year-old $200
million settlement. The folding-carton case was a
price-fixing civil suit filed in 1976 by some 2,700 companies
against 24 paper and carton manufacturers.</p>
<p>The judge's order is subject to review by a federal
appeals court in Chicago, which last year rejected a
court-ordered proposal for the surplus to go to two
Chicago-area law schools to study antitrust litigation.</p>
<p>The appeals court knocked down the proposal because it
said the plan wasn't necessary or national in scope.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>EFFORT TO FORCE Dennis Levine to testify in inside-trading
case is rejected.</p>
<p>A federal magistrate in Manhattan ruled that Mr. Levine
didn't waive his constitutional right not to incriminate
himself when he wrote a Fortune magazine article in May about
his insider trading.</p>
<p>Litton Industries Inc. is seeking to force Mr. Levine to
testify in its civil suit against him and against Lehman
Bros. Kuhn Loeb Inc., Litton's former investment adviser and
Mr. Levine's former employer. The suit, filed in 1986, claims
that Litton ended up paying too much for its takeover of Itek
Corp. because Mr. Levine leaked news of the transaction to
traders. Lehman Bros. is now part of American Express Co.'s
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. unit.</p>
<p>Litton argued that Mr. Levine should be ordered to testify
because the details in his article indicate that Mr. Levine
has no reasonable fear of further prosecution. Mr. Levine
claimed the information in the article was previously
disclosed in documents and proceedings related to his guilty
plea in 1986.</p>
<p>U.S. Magistrate Nina Gershon, however, found that Mr.
Levine's statements in the article don't waive his
constitutional rights.</p>
<p>She also ruled that while further prosecution of Mr.
Levine appears unlikely, it remains a possibility.</p>
