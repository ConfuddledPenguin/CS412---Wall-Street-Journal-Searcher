	<p class="article-leader">General Homes Corp. obtained a court order allowing the
company to voluntarily reorganize under Chapter 11 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code, reversing its opposition to an
involuntary reorganization sought last month by three
bondholders.
   The Houston-based homebuilder set the stage for a
voluntary reorganization last week when it obtained a court
order allowing it to pay suppliers and contractors. The order
was a critical step toward preventing unpaid suppliers and
contractors from filing liens to block the sales of homes and
lots.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We are entering this phase in about the best position we
can be in," said General Homes president W.A. LeSage. "There
shouldn't be a disruption in our business."</p>
<p>As recently as two weeks ago, Mr. LeSage had said General
Homes would seek to dismiss the involuntary Chapter 11
petition filed against the company July 11 by three
bondholders.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. LeSage said the involuntary reorganization
created "a lot of uncertainty" for the company and that
voluntary reorganization "made a lot of sense."</p>
<p>"This should be an opportunity to finally restructure this
company," Mr. LeSage said.</p>
<p>The company had been struggling for three years to
overcome losses on its portfolio of raw land, whose value
plummeted in the Texas real estate depression.</p>
<p>The Texas real estate market is now showing signs of
recovery, particularly in the Houston area, where most of
General Homes' land holdings are located. The company also
holds real estate in the Dallas-Fort Worth area; Orlando,
Fla.; and Phoenix, Ariz.</p>
<p>"The land, at this point, is an asset that could bring
value to the company," Mr. LeSage said.</p>
<p>General Homes currently owes about $225 million to its
senior secured lenders, who hold liens on all of the
company's real estate assets. The principal amount of the
company's subordinated debt is about $140 million.</p>
<p>The voluntary Chapter 11 petition doesn't affect the
company's units, including a title company and a mortgage
subsidiary, Mr. LeSage said.</p>
<p>General Homes is represented in the reorganization by the
Houston-based law firm of Sheinfeld, Maley & Kay.</p>
