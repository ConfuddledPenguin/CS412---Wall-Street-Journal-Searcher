	<p class="article-leader">Medical researchers said a new approach to treating an
intermediate form of acquired immune deficiency syndrome
showed promise in a preliminary clinical trial involving five
patients.
   The significance of the findings was unclear because so
few patients were studied and because of other limitations in
the trial, including lack of a control group. Indeed, editors
of Annals of Internal Medicine, where the study appears in
the current issue, cautioned that it leaves "substantial
questions" unanswered. But they decided to publish the
results anyway because "AIDS is a calamitous illness" and
"positive results were reported for a treatment unique for an
infectious disease." The Food and Drug Administration has
approved the approach for further study.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The treatment is called photopheresis. In the process, a
sample of a patient's blood is separated into red and white
blood cells after the patient takes a light-sensitive drug
called 8-methoxypsoralen. Then the white blood cells are
exposed to ultraviolet-A radiation and returned to the body.</p>
<p>The five patients -- three homosexual men and two
intravenous drug users, one female -- were treated twice
monthly for up to 15 months. All were diagnosed as having
AIDS-related complex, or ARC, a condition preliminary to
full-blown AIDS and characterized by fatigue, swollen lymph
nodes and diminished counts of infection-fighting T-cells.
None of the patients had previous therapy for AIDS.</p>
<p>Four of the patients were significantly improved after six
months both in subjective reports of physical well-being and
in certain objective blood chemistry indicators. One of the
improved patients voluntarily halted treatment after five
months, but continued to be evaluated during the course of
the study. Encouraging results continued in the other three
for up to 15 months. One patient, the woman with a history of
drug abuse, didn't respond to the treatment.</p>
<p>The researchers aren't sure how the treatment works, but
believe that it inactivates the AIDS virus, thus preventing
its ability to infect other cells. A similar procedure has
proved beneficial in treating T-cell lymphoma, a cancer of
the lymphatic system.</p>
<p>"The results are encouraging but must be viewed with
extreme caution," says Emil Bisaccia, medical director of the
photopheresis unit at Morristown Memorial Hospital in
Morristown, N.J., where the research was done, and an
assistant professor of medicine at Columbia University
College of Physicians and Surgeons.</p>
