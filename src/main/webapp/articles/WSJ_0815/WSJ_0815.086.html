	<p class="article-leader">The Mexican zeros are not some surplus aircraft purchased
from Japan, but bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury. They were
also the subject of a heated exchange yesterday between Henry
Gonzalez, chairman of the House Banking Committee, and David
Mulford, undersecretary of the Treasury.
   The incident adds to the impression that all is not well
at the United States Treasury. On a macro level, the economy
is slipping and the administration's economic strategy is
going nowhere. On a financial level, the Savings and Loan
bailout has not contained the economic impact, but has
succeeded in sticking the administration with political blame
that ought to rest with Congress. And on a micro level, the
Mexican zero controversy is threatening to permanently weaken
the Treasury as an institution.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The zeros are bonds that bear no interest but are sold at
a deep discount from face value. In the Mexican debt
agreement, they were very useful in allowing Mexico to buy
out the principal of loans with one up-front payment. But
there was an issue about the price, which according to a
General Accounting Office study turned out to be $192 million
less than nearly identical instruments were worth on the open
markets. Undersecretary Mulford keeps insisting that selling
the bonds to Mexico for below-market prices was not a
"subsidy." Chairman Gonzalez doesn't follow Mr. Mulford's
logic.</p>
<p>We were among the first to write about the zeros, and have
spent some time with the issue. Our first suspicion was that
Mr. Mulford cobbled together a zero subsidy to make up for
the shortfall in "new money" under the Brady plan. Based on
further investigations, we no longer believe this to be the
case. The best face that can be put on the Treasury position
is that while the effect of the pricing was obviously a
subsidy, that was not the intention.</p>
<p>Instead -- in our best judgment -- what happened was this:
The Mexicans had received one issue of zeros before a market
had ever developed in strips, the similar instruments
packaged and sold in private markets. In negotiating the next
deal, both the Treasury and the Mexicans assumed the new
zeros would be priced the same as the old ones. During the
negotiations, the strips market developed, giving a different
reading of the worth of the zeros.</p>
<p>The Treasury didn't have the financial acumen to recognize
what was going on until after the essential bargain was
reached with the Mexicans. When the subsidy was then pointed
out, it didn't feel it could welsh on the Mexicans.
Especially so since the Bush Treasury had already in effect
welshed on a Mexican bridge loan negotiated under the Reagan
administration. Rather than confess this ineptitude, the
Treasury clings to the position that there was no subsidy.</p>
<p>The GAO report concluded the Treasury had the legal
authority for this sale, but Mr. Gonzalez is worried about a
Treasury power to sell assets for less than the market says
they're worth. Now he wants the GAO to audit such previously
discretionary Treasury accounts as the Exchange Stabilization
Fund, chartering a creature of Congress to second-guessing
foreign exchange transactions. Because of the bungled zeros,
and particularly because of the effort to sell an untenable
story, formerly solid institutional powers may be drained
from Alexander Hamilton's Treasury.</p>
