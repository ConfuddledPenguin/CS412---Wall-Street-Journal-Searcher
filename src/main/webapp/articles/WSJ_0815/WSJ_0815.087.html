	<p class="article-leader">The over-the-counter market drifted higher on a rally in
telecommunications stocks in a session otherwise stalled by
fear.
   Many investors remain afraid of taking a position in the
market with the Middle East crisis unresolved.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"People are scared," says Robert McCready, institutional
trader at A.G. Edwards & Sons. "Nobody wants to be long or
short."</p>
<p>Traders were unimpressed by the buying that focused on
cellular telephone stocks, calling it a "technical bounce"
after days of selling in the group.</p>
<p>"There's no news to drive them," says Robert Antolini,
head of OTC trading at Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette. He adds
that many of the stocks "haven't had an uptick in days."</p>
<p>Gains in stocks such as LIN Broadcasting, McCaw
Communications and Vanguard Cellular Class A drove the Nasdaq
Utility Index up 11.74, or 2.1%, to 568.88.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index added 2.03, or about
0.5%, to 410.33. On the New York Stock Exchange, the
composite index rose 0.25%.</p>
<p>OTC advancers led decliners, 1,114 to 809.</p>
<p>Mr. Antolini says the lack of sellers in the OTC market
may mean there is an underlying desire to buy stocks.</p>
<p>Volume totaled a dismal 107.5 million shares, but was well
ahead of Monday's 87.6 million shares when power outages in
New York City closed some of the biggest OTC trading desks.</p>
<p>LIN Broadcasting rose 3 to 62 3/4, McCaw Communications
added 1 1/4 to 22 1/2, and Vanguard Cellular Class A gained 1
3/8 to 23. Vanguard reported yesterday that its loss for the
latest second quarter narrowed to 47 cents a share from 58
cents a year ago.</p>
<p>MCI Communications and Telecom USA completed their merger,
under which MCI acquires Telecom USA's common stock for about
$1.25 billion. MCI added 3/4 to 37 yesterday.</p>
<p>Intel led the most active list, dropping 1 1/4 to 36 1/4
on volume of more than 3 million shares. Bear Stearns
downgraded its rating on the stock to "hold" from "buy" and
removed the stock from its recommended list. The actions were
caused by continuing concern that Advanced Micro Devices may
emerge from a copyright suit with rights to "clone" Intel's
popular 80386 microprocessor. But not all of Wall Street
agrees that the case could hurt Intel. Last Thursday, Merrill
Lynch reiterated its positive rating on the stock. Bear
Stearns didn't change its earnings estimates for the company.</p>
<p>Genzyme added 1 1/4 to 19 1/4 on heavy volume. Genzyme and
newly formed Neozyme, filed a combined registration statement
with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the public
offering of 2.5 million units each consisting of 1 Neozyme
share and one warrant to buy one share of Genzyme stock.
Neozyme will receive all of the proceeds from the offering,
but these funds will be used to engage Genzyme to perform
research and development and clinical testing of a selected
group of health care products.</p>
<p>Chiron rose 1 1/4 to 39 1/2 on nearly double its average
daily volume. Chiron reported profit of 20 cents a share in
the latest second quarter, up sharply from the year-ago
quarter when the company reported a loss of 30 cents a share.
Revenue in the latest second quarter nearly doubled to 17.8
million from 19.2 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>Caere continued to climb as the market responds positively
to the company's hand-held scanner that enters text directly
from the printed page into a computer. Caere introduced its
"Typist" scanner for use with Apple Computer's Macintosh at
last week's MacWorld Conference in Boston. Caere added 2 1/4
to 23 3/4, after rising 1 1/4 Monday.</p>
<p>Sundowner Offshore Services lost 1 5/8 to 11 3/8. The
company said it expects its third quarter profit to fall
below the profit reported for the first and second quarters
this year. The company also reported second quarter profit
today of $436,781, down from $527,826 a year ago. The company
attributed the decreases to idle periods for its rigs.
Sundowner went public last month at $9 a share in an offering
managed by Alex. Brown & Sons.</p>
<p>Image Bank tumbled 3/4 to 4 1/4 after announcing that it
expects to report a loss for the third quarter ended June 30.
The company, which operates an extensive photograph library,
said it expects the loss for the quarter to total about
$584,000, including a write-off of about $700,000 from
currently non-utilized foreign tax credits. Revenue for the
third quarter is expected to have increased to $13.4 million
from $10 million.</p>
<p>Westcott Communications dropped 3/8 to 7 1/4, after
falling 1 1/2 points Monday. Yesterday, Alex. Brown
downgraded its rating on Westcott and lowered its 1990
earnings estimates for the company. Wescott produces
specialized televison programming for automobile dealers and
police departments.</p>
<p>Crest Industries, which lost 1/4 point Monday, fell
another 1 5/8 to 4 3/8 yesterday. The company reported that
its first quarter profit fell to $850,247 from $1,356,452 a
year earlier. Crest went public in July at $6.75 a share in
an offering managed by Raymond James & Associates.</p>
<p>Ashton-Tate gained 1/4 to 8 3/4 after it authorized the
buy-back of up to two million of its shares. The software
company has about 27 million shares outstanding.</p>
