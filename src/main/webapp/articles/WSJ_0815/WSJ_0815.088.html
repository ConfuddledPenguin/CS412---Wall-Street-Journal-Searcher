	<p class="article-leader">Lenox, Mass. -- Tanglewood's Festival of Contemporary
Music looked backward this year. It was the 50th anniversary
of the Tanglewood Music Center, the educational arm of the
Boston Symphony's summer activities, which puts on the
festival, so there was a legitimate occasion for going back
to the former future. It could have been a grim parade of
academic compositions, but Oliver Knussen kept that from
happening. This genial, oversized, British composer-conductor
is Tanglewood's contemporary music coordinator, and, thank
heavens, he has a sense of humor. But what else would one
expect from the man who has written a jolly opera based on
Maurice Sendak's children's book, "Where the Wild Things
Are"?
   In theory, the festival, which is one of the few
mainstream showcases for new music, is a good idea to begin
with, and a very convenient and sensible way for the Boston
Symphony to fulfill its "obligation" to play contemporary
music. There's no need to pay expensive musicians for extra
rehearsal time -- that's what the students are there to do,
and it's part of their education, so the festival budget is a
mere $59,000 for six days of concerts (contrast this with a
reported $200,000 spent by the New York Philharmonic in July
for one underpublicized, ill-attended new-music concert at
City College).</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The retrospective went all the way back to Tanglewood's
beginnings. Serge Koussevitzky, who founded it, championed
composers and made composition part of the educational summer
mix from the beginning. And on Saturday night, the Boston
Symphony's contribution to the festival was a work by one of
Koussevitzky's most famous proteges, William Schuman.
Schuman's Symphony No. 3 is almost as old as the Tanglewood
Music Center, and the concert fell on the composer's 80th
birthday. The symphony sounded fresh, vital and young, and it
got a knockout performance under Dennis Russell Davies.</p>
<p>Mr. Knussen had to step carefully with the programming for
his student concerts. This is his fifth year at Tanglewood,
and his goal has been openness to various compositional
styles, in contrast to composerconductor Gunther Schuller,
who ran TMC from 1970 to 1984, and resigned after being
criticized for narrowly severe modernist programming.</p>
<p>Still, Mr. Knussen gave a liberal airing to such Schuller
favorites as Jacob Druckman, Donald Martino, George Perle and
Mr. Schuller himself. But he also welcomed some of the more
tonally oriented folks who might have been considered
oddities when they were previously at Tanglewood -- the
British composer Judith Weir, or John Harbison, who has
turned away from serialism since he was a student here in
1959.</p>
<p>Then there was the under-40 group, the people whose music
Mr. Knussen most wants to promote, and a few wild-card pieces
by composers who had nothing to do with Tanglewood at all,
such as Robin Holloway's "Souvenirs de Monsalvat," a
half-hour piano -- four hands orgy on themes from "Parsifal,"
with supertitles, and "Piece in Two Parts for Six Players" by
Stefan Wolpe, a favorite of faculty member Peter Serkin.</p>
<p>Mr. Knussen's sense of humor came in handy, because the
hard-core academic pieces were a pretty depressing lot. Mr.
Druckman's String Quartet No. 3 was an interminable 28
minutes of squeaky fragments and dull noodling, but it was on
a program with George Crumb's luminous "An Idyll for the
Misbegotten," and Lukas Foss's amusing "Solo Observed," in
which an orchestra spends most of the piece watching the
pianist play a jazzy solo.</p>
<p>Sunday evening's program was hardest to take, with George
Perle's impenetrable "Windows of Order" (String Quartet No.
8) and Marc Neikrug's banal "Chetro Ketl." Mr. Schuller's
"Chamber Symphony" was well-made but constipated, and the
Wolpe was a challenging kaleidoscope of souped-up Webern.</p>
<p>But Mr. Knussen showed his true colors in the Sunday
morning program. Donald Martino's "From the Other Side," a
feeble attempt at wit, found itself on a program with other
works that played around with themes and ideas from other
composers: John Harbison's endearing "November 19, 1828," a
Schubert's-eye view of modern music; Judith Weir's "Airs From
Another Planet," with its transfigured Scottish tunes; and
"Souvenirs de Monsalvat." With such company, the final
movement of the Martino piece, "Das magische Kabarett des
Doktor Schoenberg," in which the father of serialism writes
dance music, seemed less silly.</p>
<p>On balance, the balancing act went a bit too far. After a
few concerts, I started to wonder if all contemporary music
had to be either deadly serious or a jokey satire. Was there
nothing in between?</p>
<p>Fortunately, we heard Luciano Berio's "Requies," a
shimmering, mournful elegy for his wife, the singer Cathy
Berberian; and Hans Werner Henze's masterful fragment,
"Introitus: Requiem," the beginning of a work in progress for
large ensemble. Mr. Knussen conducted and Mr. Serkin was the
soloist in the arresting, dramatically tense and spare piece.
John Harbison's "Words From Paterson," performed by the
Boston Symphony Chamber Players and baritone Sanford Sylvan
was, alas, a monochromatic disappointment.</p>
<p>Mr. Knussen was supposed to leave after five years, but
Tanglewood has asked him to stay on to provide continuity in
a time of transition. So his vision will shape the festival's
near future, and both his openmindedness (he believes that
the rifts among compositional schools are starting to close)
and the dynamism and diversity of his younger composers are
most encouraging. Detlev Glanert's "Mahler-skizze," for
example, showed some of the control of forces that made the
Henze piece so impressive, and an almost Japanese economy of
means. Jorge Liderman's "A Cinque" was lyrical, with lovely
writing for winds, and Michael Daugherty's "Snap" sounded
like a big band gone off the deep end. There was even a token
minimalist on hand to break the tacit Tanglewood ban on such
things -- Marti Epstein with her pointillistic "Grand
Island." Especially impressive was Randall Woolf's "White
Heat" for full orchestra, this season's TMC commission. As
heard in rehearsal under Mr. Knussen, it was a whirl of
energy.</p>
