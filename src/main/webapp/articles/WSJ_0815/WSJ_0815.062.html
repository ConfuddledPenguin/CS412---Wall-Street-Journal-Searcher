   To Block ITT Units
   On Insurance Sales</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">New Jersey moved to block ITT Corp. from selling any
insurance in the state if an ITT unit continues efforts to
withdraw from the auto insurance market.
   Insurance Commissioner Samuel Fortunato directed all ITT
units to surrender their certificates to sell insurance if
the one unit selling auto insurance, Twin City Fire Insurance
Co., goes ahead with plans to stop selling its lines.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The commissioner's order is the latest development in a
dispute over the state's new auto-insurance law. Proponents
of the law, which was enacted this year, say it is meant to
reduce rates and relieve the financial troubles of a fund
that had been established to insure high-risk drivers.</p>
<p>But an ITT spokeswoman said Twin City has projected
"severe losses" under the law. The company has challenged the
law in court, so far without success.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the state insurance department said it was
moving against ITT because Twin City was further along than
other insurers in trying to pull out of auto insurance in the
state. He said several others have made "overtures" about
pulling out, while still other insurers have approached the
department about starting new auto insurance lines in New
Jersey.</p>
<p>Gov. Jim Florio said in a statement that the insurance
commissioner was acting under a "long arm" provision that
empowers the state to act against companies who balk at the
law. "If they won't sell us car insurance, we won't let them
sell us anything," he said.</p>
<p>ITT, based in New York, didn't have any immediate comment
on the order. But the spokeswoman said it would affect 10 of
the company's certified insurance subsidiaries doing business
in New Jersey.</p>
<p>She said the aggregate premium volume of those
subsidiaries in the state last year was $224.6 million. Of
that, she said, $72.6 million came from Twin City, though
that figure includes homeowners' lines as well as auto
insurance.</p>
<p>The governor's office said Twin City insures about 23,000
cars, or 1% of the New Jersey market.</p>
<p>All the ITT units affected by the order are part of the
company's ITT Hartford Insurance Group subsidiary. The
commissioner's order directs ITT Hartford to cease operations
in the state over five years at a gradual pace to protect
policyholders. The order doesn't apply to life and health
policies already in effect that can only be canceled at the
option of the insured.</p>
