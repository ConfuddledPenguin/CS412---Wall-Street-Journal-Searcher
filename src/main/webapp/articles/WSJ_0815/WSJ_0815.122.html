	<p class="article-leader">Duracell Holdings Corp., the battery producer taken
private in a June 1988 leveraged buy-out, reported earnings
of $6 million for the year ended June 30 compared with a
year-ago loss of $106 million.
   Operating cash flow -- earnings from operations plus
depreciation and amortization -- advanced 18% to $306 million
from $260 million. Duracell, based in Bethel, Conn., reported
sales climbed 6.8% to $1.33 billion from $1.25 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Duracell had been a part of Kraft Inc., which now is part
of Philip Morris Cos., the giant New York foods, tobacco and
brewing concern.</p>
<p>Sales in the U.S, and Europe were particularly strong, and
consumers continue to move to alkaline batteries, Duracell's
specialty, from zinc-carbon batteries, a spokesman said.</p>
