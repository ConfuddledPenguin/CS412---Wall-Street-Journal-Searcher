	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- If you don't want to see a lot of Donald Trump
in the next several weeks, you better stay away from
bookstores and keep your television set off. Trump, the
making of the next best seller, is under way.
   "Trump: Surviving at the Top" lands in 6,000 bookstores
nationwide this week, along with life-sized cardboard figures
of the real estate mogul. A sequel to "The Art of the Deal,"
the book will be heavily promoted by publisher Random House,
a unit of the Newhouse family's Advance Publications Inc.,
and Mr. Trump himself.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Friday night, Mr. Trump will appear on "20/20" with
Barbara Walters. Monday, he'll spend several hours
autographing copies of his book at a Waldenbooks store on
Wall Street. A two-part interview will run on NBC's "Today"
show next week, and he'll be interviewed by either Oprah
Winfrey or Phil Donahue.</p>
<p>Regardless of how the book is reviewed, Random House's
aggressive handling is aimed at assuring that it will be a
big seller, though whether it recoups a seven-figure
guaranteed advance remains to be seen. The book was
originally set to be published in October, but Random House
decided to rush the book out sooner, partly to take advantage
of the publicity barrage over Mr. Trump's marital and
financial travails. Random House published a whopping first
printing of 500,000 copies, and more than 450,000 have
already been ordered by bookstores. "The Art of the Deal"
sold about 900,000 copies in hardcover.</p>
<p>In addition, Random House has zealously guarded the new
book's contents, keeping it locked in a warehouse and
skipping the usual practice of selling excerpts to magazines.
Even review copies weren't sent out to the press, so when the
book hits the stores, consumers won't be swayed by critics'
opinions.</p>
<p>Considering the lack of juicy details about both his
private life and his finances, "Surviving" may prove
disappointing to all but hard-core fans of Mr. Trump. "We
never suggested there was a deep, dark secret in this book,"
says a Random House publicist. "What's new about the book is
Donald's tone. It isn't as brassy as the first book, but it
is very blunt."</p>
<p>Blunt he may be, but Mr. Trump (with co-writer Charles
Leerhsen of Newsweek) isn't very revealing about himself, nor
does he seem terribly humbled by the vicissitudes of his
life. Though Mr. Trump admits he may have overpaid for some
properties in the '80s, he is still boastful that he'll make
a mint from them and be proved a genius in the end. If he did
overpay, he says, it's just because "I get bored too easily.
. . . The same assets that excite me in the chase often, once
they are acquired, leave me bored. . . ."</p>
<p>When it comes to his big deals, Mr. Trump tells how he
negotiated to buy the Trump Shuttle and the Plaza hotel, but
doesn't mention any losses. No details are included of the
delicate negotiations with his creditors that nearly led to
the dismemberment of Mr. Trump's empire and continue to leave
him loaded with debt. When Mr. Trump does flesh out details
from his work day, they are more likely to be about a request
to pose nude for Cosmopolitan magazine (he declined), or a
complaint from Trump Tower tenant Larry Hagman about the
tiles in his apartment bathroom.</p>
<p>Even when it comes to trashing his enemies, Mr. Trump is
mild-mannered, taking on only vanquished villains such as
Leona Helmsley or deceased ones such as Malcolm Forbes.
(Journalists are another favorite target, including Wayne
Barrett, who is working on an unauthorized biography of Mr.
Trump.)</p>
<p>Finally, anybody looking for the nitty-gritty on Mr.
Trump's romantic attachments better stick with the tabloids.
Mr. Trump seems to have split with his wife, Ivana, mostly
because he'd rather stay home watching television than attend
charity parties. ("I'm a man of very simple tastes," he
writes.) And there is only a single mention in the book of
model Marla Maples. Without revealing the nature of his
relationship with Ms. Maples, Mr. Trump writes, "Yet if I'd
never met her, Ivana and I would still be separated."</p>
