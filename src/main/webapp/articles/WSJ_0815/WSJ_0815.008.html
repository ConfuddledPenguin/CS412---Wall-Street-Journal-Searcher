	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- The airline industry's move to pass rising
jet-fuel costs onto passengers unraveled as more carriers
slashed certain fares throughout their systems and delayed a
fuel-related fare increase for at least a week.
   Industry analysts said the actions don't bode well for the
industry's bottom line.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>AMR Corp.'s American Airlines unit and NWA Inc.'s
Northwest Airlines unit said late yesterday they plan to pare
vacation-type fares on all of their flights, matching cuts
announced by two rivals Monday. The move represents
reductions of between 15% to 40%.</p>
<p>Because both carriers are among the country's largest
airlines, competitors almost certainly will be forced to trim
fares on virtually all the flights they offer. UAL Corp.'s
United Airlines and USAir Group Inc. yesterday indicated they
would do just that.</p>
<p>American, Northwest and several other carriers also
announced they are postponing a 5.3% fare increase that was
to take effect tomorrow until next Thursday. That increase,
which follows failed attempts to raise prices by as much as
10%, comes amid a sharp run-up in the cost of aviation jet
fuel, one of the industry's largest operating expenses.</p>
<p>Among the other airlines delaying the fare boosts are
United, USAir and Delta Air Lines, also among the nation's
largest carriers. Smaller companies, such as Midway Airlines,
said they are planning to do the same.</p>
<p>"It's not good news," said Paul Karos, an airlines analyst
at First Boston in New York. "We all knew things weren't
good, but business is turning out worse than we expected."</p>
<p>Mr. Karos yesterday slashed his 1990 earnings estimate for
AMR to $2.15 a share from $3.80 a share. Also, he cut his
1991 earnings estimate to $3.75 a share from $5.65 a share.
Both projections represent a sharp drop-off from AMR's
performance in 1989, when the Dallas-based firm posted net
income of $7.15 a share.</p>
<p>American acknowledges that fare-cutting undermines its
efforts to curtail the impact of higher fuel prices. "It's a
blow," said a spokesman for the airline. Further underscoring
the industry's tough times, American yesterday confirmed Wall
Street reports that it has been reducing its traffic-growth
projections. The airline wouldn't specify how much it has
reduced those projections.</p>
<p>Prices of many airline holding companies stocks slipped
yesterday, reflecting the industry's fresh turmoils. In
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, AMR stock
closed at $49 share, down $2.125 a share. UAL stock fell
$4.375 to close at $105.75. Delta dropped $1.875 to close at
$57.50.</p>
<p>Initially, the fare discounting was restricted to the
limited number of cities served by Trans World Airlines and
Eastern Airlines, both of which announced cuts Monday. Both
carriers are operating domestic schedules scaled down from
earlier days when they were financially robust. As rivals
started matching the fare decreases yesterday, however, the
discounts spread throughout the industry's system.</p>
<p>Passengers are likely to find the entire fare picture
confusing. If they qualify for the discounted fares, which
are heavily restrictive and in effect for now only until Aug.
29, they will reap the price declines. The promotional fares
-- which can only be used between Sept. 5 and Dec. 15 -- are
designed to drum up business during the slower fall and
winter period. If they don't meet the restrictions,
passengers likely face higher fares that reflect the rising
fuel costs.</p>
<p>Airlines might use inventory management -- earmarking only
a certain number of seats for the discounts -- to keep
possible losses low. In addition, the discounted fares
probably will only attract vacationers who can plan ahead to
take advantage of the bargains. Most business travelers,
however, will likely continue paying for the industry's most
expensive tickets, because they usually schedule short jaunts
at the spur of the moment and buy the industry's most
expensive tickets.</p>
