	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Western Union Corp. adjourned its annual
meeting for the third time since June as it struggled to win
approval of its recapitalization plan from shareholders.
   Western Union plans to reconvene the annual meeting today
at noon at the Ramada Inn in Montvale, N.J.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company has said it will have to seek bankruptcy-law
protection if it cannot win approval of the plan to
reclassify its preferred stock into common shares and
exchange new debt securities and common stock for its present
senior notes.</p>
<p>Last month, a representative for the company's bondholders
said that most would be willing to go along with the exchange
offer.</p>
<p>However, the company must first get stockholder approval
of the reclassification. A spokesman said the company is
close to getting the two-thirds majority vote necessary to
approve the reclassification.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Western Union's negotiations over a new
three-year contract with the Communications Workers of
America grew intense. The CWA filed a complaint with the
National Labor Relations Board, charging Western Union with
unfair labor practices after it locked out 2,500 unionized
workers over the weekend and replaced them with nonunion
workers.</p>
<p>The workers, including employees in the company's central
telephone bureaus, computer centers and other facilities had
been working without a contract since midnight Aug. 6 when
the old contract expired. However, Western Union said it
couldn't operate "under the ever-present threat" of a strike
as it tried to work out a new contract.</p>
