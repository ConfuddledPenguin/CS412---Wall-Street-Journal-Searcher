	<p class="article-leader">Henley Group Inc., seeking to streamline the company,
amended a previous plan to spin off two of its units and said
it will liquidate its stake in Itel Corp.
   At least a portion of Henley's 38.5% stake in Itel will be
bought back by Itel; the remaining shares will either be
purchased or underwritten by Itel, Henley said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The transaction, coming about two months after Henley
announced its decision to sell its Itel shares as part of a
liquidation plan, will net Henley about $375 million, all of
which will be used to pay down its $415 million in bank debt,
a company spokesman said.</p>
<p>Itel is a Chicago-based leasing company. Henley is a
Hampton, N.H., industrial holding company.</p>
<p>Henley, which has been reorganizing and spinning off
companies following its spinoff from Allied-Signal Corp. four
years ago, also modified a divestiture plan disclosed two
months ago. Under the latest plan, Henley said it won't spin
off its Pneumo Abex unit, as previously announced. The
company had said in June that it would distribute 35% of its
Pneumo Abex unit to shareholders. But Henley said it will
move forward with its plan to spin off its Fisher
International Inc. unit, although the Fisher spinoff plan no
longer includes two million shares of Itel that Henley was
going to pass on to the spun-off Fisher operation.</p>
