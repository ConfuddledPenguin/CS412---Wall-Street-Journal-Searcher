	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. reached a
tentative agreement with the United Steelworkers union that
gives workers 11% of the company and paves the way for the
steelmaker to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law
protection.
   The tentative contract reached here represents a victory
for both the company and the union. For the U.S.'s
eighth-largest steelmaker, the pact is the last major hurdle
in its five-year effort to get a reorganization plan
approved. This year, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court said it
wouldn't confirm a reorganization plan unless a labor pact
was ratified with the union and accepted by creditors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The union, for its part, succeeded in patterning the
contract after other accords signed with major steelmakers
last year. Thus, it took another step in its goal to return
to wage parity among all major producers. During the
turbulent 1980s, steelmakers broke with the lockstep wage
patterns that had been the industry's tradition by
negotiating separate settlements.</p>
<p>The contract is subject to approval of the membership and
the union's International Executive Board, which is scheduled
to vote Monday. A membership vote hasn't yet been scheduled.
The accord has already received the backing of the company's
major creditors. The union negotiated the final terms with a
group led by New York investor Ron LaBow, the company's
largest shareholder and creditor, after the company walked
out of talks Sunday.</p>
<p>As part of the agreement, union employees, who were
creditors of the bankrupt company, will receive 2.2 million
common shares, representing approximately 11% of the
reorganized company. The stock is payment for the $26.8
million owed employees in an employee investment program.</p>
<p>Under the contract, union employees will receive an
immediate $1.50-an-hour average wage increase representing
restoration of past wage sacrifices. In addition, they will
receive a 50-cent average hourly wage increase in each of the
next three years, a $3,000 signing bonus and a $500 bonus in
1991. The contract also restores one week of vacation,
vacation bonuses, five holidays, Sunday premium of time and a
half, and incentive rates.</p>
<p>The terms of the new contract will take effect upon
confirmation of a new plan of reorganization by the
Bankruptcy Court, which is expected to act by the end of
September. The contract will expire March 1, 1994.</p>
<p>"There's no question that this is a good contract, one
that our members richly deserve after 10 years of
sacrifices," said Andrew "Lefty" Palm, chairman of the
union's negotiating committee. "There is also no question
that the company can well afford this contract."</p>
<p>Union officials said the wage terms are similar to those
in contracts signed last year by major integrated steelmakers
such as Bethlehem Steel Corp., National Steel Co. and LTV
Steel Corp. LTV is also operating under Chapter 11, in which
a company is protected from creditor lawsuits while it works
out a plan to reorganize. The contract also includes new
language, in line with agreements reached last year with
other companies, that severely restricts the contracting out
of work.</p>
<p>The company and its creditors had balked at many of those
terms, deeming them too rich for a newly reorganized company.
However, creditors apparently decided that the contract would
be less of a financial blow than a strike. The union
threatened to strike tomorrow if negotiations deadlocked.</p>
<p>The union hopes to use the pattern when approaching the
nation's largest steelmaker, USX Corp., this year in contract
talks. USX has already said it doesn't believe in pattern
contracts and was undoubtedly hoping that Wheeling-Pittsburgh
would negotiate different terms.</p>
<p>In Wheeling, W.Va., Wheeling-Pittsburgh officials said
they were pleased an agreement had been reached and looked
forward to emerging from bankruptcy-law protection. Once the
company emerges, Vice Chairman D. Leonard Wise is expected to
take over as chief executive officer, succeeding turnaround
specialist William J. Scharffenberger.</p>
