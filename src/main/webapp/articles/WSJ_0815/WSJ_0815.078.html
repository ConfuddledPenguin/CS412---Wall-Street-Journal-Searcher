	<p class="article-leader">Several Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. shareholders
sued to stop the proposed purchase of Frank Lorenzo's stake
in the airline company by Scandinavian Airlines System.
   In addition to Mr. Lorenzo, who stepped down as chairman
and chief executive officer of Continental Holdings, the
plaintiffs also sued that company, its directors and Jet
Capital Corp., the tightly controlled holding company that
owns a special class of Continental Holdings stock. SAS was
not named in the suits.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The suits -- three of them filed in Delaware Chancery
Court and a fourth filed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey
-- allege that Continental directors breached their fiduciary
duty by agreeing to a buy-out in which Mr. Lorenzo and Jet
Capital's other shareholders receive $14 to $18 apiece for
their shares. In American Stock Exchange composite trading
yesterday, Continental Holdings shares closed at $5.25, down
87.5 cents.</p>
<p>Mr. Lorenzo agreed last week to sell all his stock in
Continental Holdings to SAS and to vacate his management
posts at both the holding company and its Continental
Airlines unit, although he will remain a director. Mr.
Lorenzo would receive more than $30 million, including $10.8
million for his shares in Jet Capital, and SAS would buy most
of his stock options, also at a premium. The transaction
would boost SAS's equity stake to 16.8% from 9.8%.</p>
<p>The Delaware suits charge that Mr. Lorenzo would receive
amounts vastly exceeding the value of his stock options and
his employment contract. Similarly, the New Jersey suit
claims SAS is paying Mr. Lorenzo four times the value of his
equity. The New Jersey suits ask for unspecified damages and
all the suits seek to stop the transaction.</p>
<p>A Continental Holdings spokesman said the company believes
the transaction to be proper, and that it was scrutinized by
attorneys and financial advisers for all the parties
involved. "We are confident the directors will be absolved of
any wrongdoing," he said.</p>
