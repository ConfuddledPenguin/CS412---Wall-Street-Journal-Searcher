	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan said the economic slump in New England isn't likely
to provoke a national recession and won't "interfere with the
conduct of monetary policy in a fundamental way."
   In a written statement responding to a letter from Senate
Banking Committee Chairman Donald Riegle (D., Mich.), Mr.
Greenspan said the central bank "doesn't have the tools to
deal surgically with regional or sectoral problems."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Greenspan said the current slump in New England stems
from "setbacks" in the defense, high-tech and
financial-services industries. This brought a downturn in
real estate, which in turn left banks and other lenders with
heavy losses.</p>
<p>"I don't see the sort of direct contagion in these
problems that will lead to national recession, and while they
are an important feature of the economic and financial
environment that must be considered as we make our decisions,
I don't believe that they `interfere' with the conduct of
monetary policy in a fundamental way," he said.</p>
