	<p class="article-leader">THE PIECES ARE PREPARED for a tax increase. But which will
be picked?
   Congressional negotiators plan to mix and match already
developed options to compose a tax increase for fiscal 1991.
A securities-transfer tax moves to the top of the list as the
Iraq upheaval makes an energy tax -- at least a big one --
less likely. Other strong bets are increases in sin taxes and
a new levy on luxury items, though defining luxury will be
tricky. Republicans are unlikely to get a capital gains tax
reduction unless Democrats get the top personal tax rate
raised.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Loud complaints about a GOP plan to trim the state
income-tax deduction endanger that proposal. But deductions
aren't safe. Across-the-board limits for the richest
Americans are still possible. High-income seniors could well
have more of their Social Security benefits taxed. Life
insurance companies could get whacked. And foreign firms are
still targets. "I don't see anything as off the table," a
senior tax committee aide says.</p>
<p>One option, discussed by Democrats, could return: raising
the corporate tax rate.</p>
<p>TAX POLITICS TURN PERSONAL, as GOP proposals entangle
Democrats.</p>
<p>The Republicans' tentative plan to curb the state income
tax deduction is widely interpreted as a broadside against
New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, one of President Bush's most
formidable potential rivals in 1992. "This has become a Bush
vs. Cuomo thing," says Republican Rep. McGrath of New York.
Republicans privately gloat that the proposal forces Cuomo to
defend a tax break for the wealthy. Cuomo's opposition to a
securities-transfer tax also has Republicans crowing.</p>
<p>Though Bush aides praise tax summit chairman Gephardt for
his earnest efforts to combat the deficit, they spotlight him
with their beer-tax plan. The former Democratic presidential
candidate represents St. Louis, home of Anheuser-Busch, which
is the shrillest opponent of the GOP's beer-tax rise.
Meanwhile, one high-profile Democrat is eager to attach his
name to an option: Sen. Bentsen of Texas presses for
expansion of individual retirement account deductions.</p>
<p>CAPITAL GAINS LOBBYISTS divide, weakening their cause.</p>
<p>Investment houses dispatch their big guns to Washington,
but they concentrate on fighting the transfer tax, not
reducing capital gains. Indeed, a delegation tells Treasury
Secretary Brady they would rather have a higher top personal
tax rate and no capital gains cut than a transfer tax. Some
Wall Streeters even blame the capital gains issue for the
ascent of the transfer tax. "My response," sniffs gains-cut
advocate Mark Bloomfield, "is unprintable."</p>
<p>The lobbyists also disagree over tactics. Corporate
advocate Charls Walker pushes a plan to cut capital gains
more deeply and more broadly than President Bush, and some
less zealous backers quietly resent the move. But dissent
spills over when two GOP senators threaten to attach the
provision to a debt-ceiling bill, even when they were
obviously short of a majority. "It was insane," one
capital-gains supporter asserts.</p>
<p>Still, a capital gains cut remains likely as long as the
president makes it a priority.</p>
<p>IT WOULD TAKE A MIRACLE for budget negotiators to meet
their ambitious schedule. But, for the record, the summit
plans to meet in seclusion Sept. 5, agree by Sept. 10, have
Congress pass the bill by Sept. 24, and get it signed by Oct.
2.</p>
<p>STATE TAXES account for an increasing share of all taxes,
a legacy of Reagan-era cutbacks in federal aid, the National
Council of State Legislatures reports. In 1988, states
collected 26.5% of all taxes, up from 23.9% in 1980, 20.6% in
1970 and 15.9% in 1960.</p>
<p>LUST IS on the wane. The tenth-of-a-cent tax per gallon on
gasoline to pay for the leaking underground storage tank
trust fund, or LUST, will disappear at the end of the month.
The IRS says its need for funds is satisfied.</p>
<p>THE CASE OF THE MISSING TAXES baffles government and
private analysts.</p>
<p>Tax receipts of all sorts are running well below
forecasts. The Treasury says total receipts through the end
of June were 3.7% below the year-ago level. Individual income
taxes, which account for close to half of all federal
receipts, were down 4.5%. The Congressional Budget Office
trims its forecast of this year's revenues by $27 billion and
next year's by $19 billion. The Bush administration lowers
its projections even more.</p>
<p>The slowing economy is only partly responsible. Government
models incorrectly inflated forecasts of payroll-tax
receipts. More businesses may be electing Subchapter S status
to get favorable tax treatment. Investors might also have
delayed taking capital gains in anticipation of a lower rate.
"People are scratching their heads," says Ernst & Young
analyst Pete Davis. The answer lies in IRS data that won't be
available for years. "When the dollars flow in, they don't
have labels on them," a Treasury official says.</p>
<p>Lower-than-expected revenues account for over half of the
White House's higher deficit estimate.</p>
<p>BRIEFS: The Congressional Budget Office retracts a study
that asserts that the low-income elderly wouldn't be harmed
by higher "sin" and gas taxes. . . . The IRS issues 79 pages
of written instructions to dividend and interest payers who
want to reduce paperwork by filing data on computer disks.</p>
