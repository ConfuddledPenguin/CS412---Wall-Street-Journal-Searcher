	<p class="article-leader">Fashion magazines are known for their alluring
advertising. Just flip through the August issue of Vogue.
There's a provocative four-page spread for Georges Marciano,
a sultry ad for Capezio bags, Mario Valentino's seductive
appeal and a pouty-lipped model in an ad for Sears, Roebuck &
Co.
   Sears?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yup. And it's no mistake.</p>
<p>It's all part of a new shock 'em strategy by the drudge of
retailing. Sears wants to grab the attention of women who
wouldn't be caught dead in its women's apparel department.</p>
<p>Besides Vogue and Glamour magazines, Sears plans to hype
its new look this fall in other women's magazines, notably
Cosmopolitan, Mademoiselle and Essence.</p>
<p>This month's Vogue ad introduces an inexpensive sportswear
collection designed for Sears by Cathy Hardwick, once a
common fixture in department stores. Although the Sears ad
isn't as sexy or sophisticated as the Vogue spreads for
Bergdorf Goodman, Macy's or Nordstrom, it's a far cry from
the typical -- and lifeless -- Sears layout. The message: The
giant retailer now sells stylish clothes.</p>
<p>Sears also will be the sole sponsor of a special issue on
women that Time magazine plans to publish in October. In 28
pages of ads, Sears will promote women's apparel -- and other
things, like its Allstate insurance policies. But Thomas E.
Morris, vice president of marketing at Sears, says: "We're
not hard-selling product. It is our hope that people reading
the issue will say, `Sears understands my life -- how busy I
am -- and they're responding to it.'"</p>
<p>Sears needs to attract this younger, more affluent
shopper. Its own research shows that its departments appeal
to the over-40 crowd with annual household incomes of less
than $30,000. To change that profile, Sears is updating its
selection and renovating its stores. The plan has been in the
works for some time and doesn't reflect Sears Chairman Edward
Brennan's new campaign to improve the retailer's
merchandising operations.</p>
<p>But Sears, which suddenly views fashion as a way to
reverse years of market-share losses and sagging earnings,
faces a tough sell. It built its reputation hawking hard
goods like Kenmore appliances, Craftsman tools and DieHard
batteries mostly to men.</p>
<p>Even people in the Sears camp acknowledge the challenge.
"Sears announcing by itself that it has stylish clothes
doesn't achieve credibility," says Bruce Beach, a managing
director of WPP Group PLC's Ogilvy & Mather unit, which is
handling the Sears ads. But, he says, spreads in magazines
like Vogue and Time will "force people to think differently
about the kinds of fashion that are available at Sears."</p>
<p>J.C. Penney Co., a mass merchant that spent the past
decade shedding hard goods to focus on fashion, also started
advertising in Vogue to achieve credibility. But skeptics say
Vogue may be too much of a stretch for Sears.</p>
<p>Ayer Inc.'s Thomas Hooke, who handles the Penney account,
says Sears's fashion statement could further confuse
consumers about the store's strategy. He contends that recent
Sears ads have sent "a lot of mixed and crossed signals" by
touting everything from "everyday low pricing" to national
brands in areas like appliances. "The consumer sees Sears
with one set of eyes," he says. "They don't differentiate by
department."</p>
<p>Agrees Clive Chajet, chairman of image consultant
Lippincott & Margulies in New York: "There are so many other
Sears messages going out that are contradictory to a fashion
image." The Vogue audience, he believes, is probably too
upscale for Sears.</p>
<p>But Ogilvy's Mr. Beach defends the strategy, noting that
Sears "isn't trying to imitate the Lord & Taylors and Neiman
Marcuses of the world," nor is it trying to attract "the
purchaser of French first-run fashions." The target audience?
"People who are in the market to purchase stylish
contemporary but good-value clothes."</p>
<p>Read that cheap. Unlike the $300 threads Saks Fifth Avenue
advertises in the current issue of Vogue, Sears is hawking
Hardwick pieces priced from $26 to $64. Insiders say the
retailer seeks to create a Gap-like appeal. It wants shoppers
to think of Sears as a place to buy low-priced but stylish
basics. Yet skeptics point out that Gap Inc. succeeds partly
because it sells only clothes.</p>
<p>Still, Sears was emboldened by the results of its first
major effort last year to target women. The retailer hired an
actress who appears to be in her 30s to make its corporate
pitch on TV. In the commercials, she talks frankly about why
she likes Sears auto and appliance repair services and credit
and return policies, among other things.</p>
<p>"We've gotten a tremendous amount of consumer feedback
from these spots," says Sears's Mr. Morris. "It's all
positive."</p>

<p>Ad Notes. . . .</p>
<p>NEW ACCOUNTS: Procter & Gamble awarded the estimated $15
million account for its Old Spice and Santa Fe men's
toiletries and fragrances to Tatham-Laird & Kudner, Chicago.
Scali McCabe Sloves, a unit of WPP Group, formerly handled
the account. P&G, which acquired the brands in July from
American Cyanamid's Shulton Group, said it sought to
consolidate its business at an agency currently handling P&G
brands. Tatham-Laird already handles several P&G accounts,
including Coast, Mr. Clean, Metamucil, Head & Shoulders and
Chloraseptic. Scali McCabe had been put on the spot by the
Shulton purchase: Sister WPP shops Ogilvy & Mather and J.
Walter Thompson create ads for P&G rival Unilever. . . .
Hofstra University picked Edward Bird Wilson, New York, to
handle its account. Terms weren't disclosed.</p>
<p>STARKIST TOPS VNRs: More than 81 million TV viewers saw
footage from StarKist's "Dolphin-Safe Tuna" PR video, making
it the most-watched video news release for the first half of
1990. The StarKist release topped the previous record of 80
million viewers for a Drexel Burnham Lambert VNR in 1988,
according to Medialink, a Video Broadcasting Corp. unit that
transmits the releases to TV stations.</p>
<p>READ THEIR LIPS: A new print campaign for Smirnoff vodka,
picking up on President Bush's now-broken campaign pledge,
asks consumers to "Read Your Lips." "One sip will tell it
all," say the ads, created by McCann-Erickson for the
Heublein Inc. brand. "And that's a promise not subject to
change."</p>
