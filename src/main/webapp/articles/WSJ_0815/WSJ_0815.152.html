	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- Sales of North American-built cars and trucks
dropped 18.5% in early August, reflecting economic
uncertainty more than an immediate consumer reaction to
tensions in the Persian Gulf.
   Auto company executives, dealers and industry analysts
said they have seen little effect so far from Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait, which caused gasoline prices to spike last week.
Instead, they said, consumers seem to be pulling in their
horns because of longer-term economic worries.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I don't think people are going to stop buying cars
because of high fuel prices," said Chrysler Corp. Chairman
Lee A. Iacocca. "I think they are going to worry about their
jobs and the uncertainty {over} a recession that this Iraq
situation may bring upon us."</p>
<p>The results from the Aug. 1-10 period this year stand in
sharp contrast to year-earlier sales, which were pumped up by
buyers taking advantage of huge rebates in order to avoid big
price increases on the coming 1990-model cars and trucks.</p>
<p>Makers of domestic vehicles sold 246,772 cars and trucks
compared with 302,940 vehicles in early August last year. As
a result, car sales in the first 10 days of this month hit a
seasonally adjusted annual sales rate of 6.6 million
vehicles, according to a Commerce Department formula. That is
far below the 8 million car sales-rate from a year earlier.</p>
<p>Auto makers expected to see sales pick up in the second
half of this year after struggling through the first part of
1990 by dishing out huge incentives but getting only weak
sales in return. Now industry officials are expressing
pessimism about the rest of this year.</p>
<p>Tom Webb, chief economist for the National Automobile
Dealers Association, predicted seasonally adjusted annual
sales rates will come in closer to a meager 6 million cars in
the months ahead because of deteriorating consumer
confidence.</p>
<p>"I hope there's not more than another two weeks {of weak
sales}, but that's living in hope," Mr. Iacocca said at a
ceremony for the start of 1991-model minivan production at
Chrysler's Windsor, Ontario, assembly plant. "It could last
six months."</p>
<p>Chrysler's sales in the period were by far the worst of
the Big Three U.S. auto makers. Its domestic car sales fell a
steep 38.6%, while its domestic trucks were hurt by new
vehicles from competitors and slipped 22.5%.</p>
<p>General Motors Corp. reported a sharp sales decline with
its domestic cars, off 22.2% as a result of weaker
performances from all five of its car divisions. Sales by
GM's Oldsmobile division, which have been deteriorating all
year, fell a steep 41.4% in early August. Cadillac sales,
meanwhile, dropped 41.6%.</p>
<p>Even GM's imported car sales, which have been a source of
strength all year, plunged 39.7%. The No. 1 auto maker has
had trouble getting enough of the hot selling Isuzu-built Geo
Storm because of Japanese import-quota limitations.</p>
<p>GM's domestic truck sales also suffered, falling 18.1%.
But Ford Motor Co., helped by the popularity of its Explorer
sport utility vehicle, saw its truck sales fall only 4%. The
news wasn't so good, though, for Ford's domestic car sales,
which dropped 21.3% in the period.</p>
<p>Ford was hurt primarily because sales of the Escort
subcompact plunged 47.9% in early August. Sales of the
redesigned 1991 Escort, which came out earlier this year, and
the older version were off 21.8% for the whole year. Sales of
the Ford Thunderbird coupe dropped 47.9%, while the similar
Mercury Cougar saw its sales fall 50.3% in early August.</p>
<p>The sales decline didn't leave Japanese auto makers
unscathed either. Honda Motor Co.'s domestic car sales
plummeted 15.4%, while Nissan Motor Co. car sales fell 33.1%.
Toyota Motor Co. showed a 64.3% improvement in domestic car
sales.</p>
