	<p class="article-leader">PALO ALTO, Calif. -- CF Motor Freight, a unit of
Consolidated Freightways Inc., said it asked the Interstate
Commerce Commission to approve a fuel surcharge to offset the
sudden oil price increases touched off by the Middle East oil
crisis.
   If the federal agency approves the surcharge, it would be
effective Friday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a letter to its customers, CF Motor Freight said that,
if approved, the surcharge would initially add 1% to the cost
of shipments of less than a truckload, and 3.47% to
full-truckload shipments. They would change weekly, however,
based on the fluctuating cost of fuel.</p>
<p>The surcharge is described as a straight pass-through of
increased costs, and it would be suspended when costs return
to normal, Consolidated Freightways said.</p>
<p>Consolidated Freightways is a trucking and air freight
company.</p>
