	<p class="article-leader">JORDAN'S KING IS EXPECTED to meet with Bush on the Mideast
crisis.
   The president is slated to meet tomorrow with King
Hussein, who is reportedly carrying a message from Iraq's
Saddam Hussein. While news of the Jordanian leader's visit
brought hope for a possible diplomatic solution, Bush said
the U.S. is ready to use its naval forces to shut down Iraqi
trade through Jordan. He added that the U.S. is still talking
to other nations, including the Soviet Union, to strengthen
such a move against Baghdad. The Soviets said they might join
a multinational force moving to block trade with Iraq if the
venture could be accomplished under U.N. control.
Undersecretary of State Robert Kimmitt called in the British,
French, Soviet and Chinese ambassadors in order to confer on
the proposal.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>ABC-TV newsman Ted Koppel, who was allowed into Baghdad,
said a senior Iraqi official termed Americans stuck in Iraq
and Kuwait as "restrictees" who won't be permitted to leave
until the current crisis comes to an end.</p>

<p>Scientists uncovered a gene they suspect holds the key to
how cigarette smoke causes lung cancer. Tests of tissues from
lung cancer patients indicated that a particular gene had
been "turned on" in the patients and was producing a protein
that turned chemicals in cigarette smoke into cancer-causing
substances.</p>

<p>A federal judge ruled that a group of treasure hunters can
keep the largest treasure trove in U.S. history -- gold found
in a ship that sank 133 years ago off South Carolina. The
judge rejected arguments of insurers who said they owned the
gold because they paid out claims arising from the disaster.</p>

<p>A study confirmed that long-term AIDS survivors face an
increased risk of developing lymph cancer, despite better
medical treatment to fight life-threatening infections.
Scientists said that almost 15% of the patients in the study
developed an aggressive lymphoma following about two years of
therapy with the antiviral drug AZT.</p>
<p>AIDS researchers said a new approach to treating an
intermediate form of the disease showed promise in a clinical
trial involving five patients. The significance of the
findings on the treatment, called photopheresis, was unclear
because so few patients were studied.</p>

<p>Washington's Mayor Barry will run for a City Council seat,
his top political aide announced, saying the mayor believes
he can still be an effective leader despite his conviction
Friday on a drug-possession charge. The aide, Anita Bonds,
said Barry has firmly rejected making a bid for a fourth
four-year mayoral term.</p>

<p>The Soviet Union suggested that an international register
of arms sales be kept at the U.N. In a letter to the U.N.'s
secretary general, Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze also
proposed talks on arms-sale restrictions with the U.S. and
other weapons suppliers as well as recipients.</p>

<p>A car bomb exploded next to Peru's government palace in
Lima while President Fujimori was inside, damaging the

Officials, who blamed the attack on a pro-Cuban revolutionary
group, said other car-bomb attacks occurred in two highland
cities, killing one person.</p>

<p>The General Accounting Office said the Department of
Veterans Affairs has paid benefits to more than 1,200

or more. The agency estimated the potential annual loss from
the erroneous payments at $5.7 million.</p>

<p>Liberian rebel leader Prince Johnson met with reporters
and dismissed claims by rival insurgents that he had been
killed in an ambush. Charles Taylor, Johnson's rival in a
yearlong battle to oust President Doe, had maintained earlier
in the day that his fighters had killed Johnson at a rubber
plantation outside of the capital of Monrovia.</p>

<p>Ten people were killed in separatist attacks on Indian
security forces as many Kashmir towns marked Pakistan's
independence day under curfew, according to police sources.
The deaths were reported in India's only Moslem-majority
state, where activists had rallied mass support in January
for a revolt against New Delhi's rule.</p>

<p>About 85 Tamil villagers were massacred in Sri Lanka in
apparent retaliation for the killings of hundreds of Moslems,
residents said. About 100 more Tamils were injured in the
attack by a gang of people armed with knives and axes in the
eastern Batticaloa district, they said.</p>

<p>The Soviet government began registering news organizations
under a new press law guaranteeing freedom from decades of
state censorship. Meanwhile, the State Press Committee
announced a doubling in the price of many publications,
attributing the increases to the cost of paper, printing
equipment and transportation.</p>

<p>A Belgian family may be released today by a radical
Palestinian group in Lebanon, a Beirut newspaper reported.
The family of four, held since November 1987, would be freed
in exchange for the release by Belgium of a guerrilla jailed
for a grenade attack on Jewish children 10 years ago.</p>

<p>Researchers said a breast cancer treatment may lower the
risk of heart disease in post-menopausal women. The
scientists said the drug, Tamoxifen, marketed under the name
Nolvadex by Imperial Chemcial Industries of London, helped
cut blood cholesterol levels in breast cancer patients and
kept them low during a two-year study.</p>
