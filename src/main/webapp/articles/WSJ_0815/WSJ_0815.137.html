	<p class="article-leader">Hanson PLC, Britain's largest industrial conglomerate,
reported a 26% rise in pretax profit in the nine months ended
June 30, helped by first-time contributions from Consolidated
Gold Fields.
   Pretax profit in the latest nine months rose to #939
million ($1.77 billion) from #742 million a year earlier. The
results were at the top end of expectations, which ranged
between #910 million and #940 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Profit after taxes but before extraordinary items totaled
#712 million, up 26% from #567 million in the year-earlier
period. Earnings per share rose to 14.6 pence, up 13% from
12.9 pence in the year-earlier period.</p>
<p>Sales climbed 3.6% to #5.17 billion from #4.99 billion the
year earlier.</p>
<p>Hanson's chairman, Lord Hanson, described the results as
very good in view of "the difficult conditions affecting some
sectors of our business" and said progress so far at the
company's U.K. and U.S. operations "allows us to be confident
about the balance of the financial year."</p>
<p>Hanson didn't break out the size of the first-time
contribution from Consolidated Gold Fields, the British
mining and minerals group it acquired in August 1989. The
#3.5 billion takeover was Britain's largest ever.</p>
