	<p class="article-leader">Recession? Maybe. "Stagflation?" No.
   The American economy has withstood the first shock of the
Middle Eastern crisis without much inflation, and it may
continue to do so for quite a while. A critical ingredient --
inflationary psychology -- is missing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>With the important and visible exception of oil and oil
products, prices in general have failed to rise since Iraq's
Saddam Hussein stormed Kuwait 13 days ago, plunging the world
into its first grave crisis since the end of the Cold War.</p>
<p>Many people say the increased costs of oil and
petrochemical products will force up prices on a wide range
of other consumer and industrial goods, but later -- perhaps
three to six months later -- not now. Oil is crucial to
industrial economies. Certainly if the crisis continues, the
prices of practically everything from avocados to Ziploc bags
will reflect the already higher costs of gasoline, heating
oil, fuel oil and petrochemicals.</p>
<p>"There will be some resistance to price hikes," says Nobel
Prize-winning economist Paul Samuelson, "but I wouldn't
expect it to be strong enough to prevent the rise from
happening."</p>
<p>Still, passing along cost increases -- and even that may
be tough to do in many cases -- hardly amounts to runaway
inflation. Among scores of business people and others
interviewed by The Wall Street Journal in a dozen cities over
the past few days, there was no indication that the
self-fulfilling prophecies of inflationary psychology are
taking hold. The classic symptoms are notable only by their
absence: plans for pre-emptive price increases in
anticipation of cost increases, for example, or speculative
inventory ordering in hope of reaping windfall inflationary
profits in the future.</p>
<p>In fact, many business people think it will be difficult
enough simply to pass on their cost increases to customers.
Many are taking a wait-and-see attitude toward pricing. They
wait because they see no point in antagonizing customers with
price increases that will be hard to maintain, and
practically impossible to maintain if the Iraqi crisis
dissipates quickly.</p>
<p>This time, unlike the energy crunches and inflationary
manias of the 1970s and early 1980s, the economy appears to
remain in a fundamentally non-inflationary mode. While
inventories in many industries are tight, the demand for
goods and services is weak.</p>
<p>Earlier oil shocks struck the Western world in late 1973
and in 1979. And the U.S. experienced three years of
double-digit inflation as measured by the increase in the
Consumer Price Index: 12.3% in 1974, followed by 13.3% in
1979 and 12.5% in 1980.</p>
<p>"I think it's different now," says economist Joel Polkin,
a close observer of prices. "The economy is much weaker, and
it is not going to be as easy to pass these things {cost
increases} through." Robert Aliber, an economist at the
University of Chicago, agrees. "The whole analysis which
compares the '70s and the '90s is purely on the supply side,"
he says. "What it neglects is that with the first two OPEC
{Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries} oil shocks,
the economy was running full steam."</p>
<p>This time it isn't.</p>
<p>The Southeast's textile industry is a case in point. It is
heavily dependent on synthetics made from petrochemicals, and
is quickly affected by cost increases experienced by its
suppliers. But, say officials of Guilford Mills Inc.,
Greensboro, N.C., suppliers haven't yet raised prices.
Because of weak consumer demand, "It hasn't been an
environment to raise prices," says Paul McGarr, senior vice
president for finance. "We've got a little breathing time
because our primary suppliers haven't made any move to pass
increases along to us."</p>
<p>BASF Corp., in Parsippany, N.J., is a consumer of
petrochemical feedstocks that it uses to make fibers for
carpets and clothes, specialty chemicals for home decorating
products, and antifreeze. "We are presently negotiating with
our suppliers, who are requesting price increases," says
Helmuth von Moltke, a spokesman for the firm. But the company
says demand for many of its products has been slowing, and
may limit its ability to pass on cost increases.</p>
<p>The demand for nylon in home carpeting is especially weak.
"It's tough to increase prices in a weak market," says Mr.
Moltke. "Eventually, nylon prices will have to go up because
our margins are being squeezed, but the timing is unclear."</p>
<p>A variety of contractual arrangements protect some
businesses and their customers from the immediate effect of
fuel and feedstock increases. Monsanto Co.'s Monsanto
Chemical Co. subsidiary, for example, the second-largest
American nylon producer and the largest producer of acrylic
fibers, has contracts that guarantee stable feedstock costs
through the end of August.</p>
<p>If oil prices stay at their current high levels, "there is
no doubt that consumers would see higher prices for apparel,
carpet and tires," says Earl Brasfield, group vice president
for fibers at Monsanto Chemical. But weak demand and
competitive pressures seem likely to delay oil-related
increases. Monsanto now believes that price increases in
consumer products, such as acrylic sweaters, would be small.
The company says it doesn't know when prices might actually
rise.</p>
<p>Dow Chemical Co.'s DowBrands Inc., Indianapolis, says
consumers who use its plastic wraps, Ziploc bags and other
products may see no price increases for at least three to six
months because of sizable inventories and promotional deals
with distributors. Even then, says Richard Parry, a company
spokesman, increases would be so small -- a few cents a
package -- that consumers would "hardly notice."</p>
<p>Sherwin-Williams Co., Cleveland, says it has already
encountered higher prices on the solvents it buys on the
spot, or noncontractual, market. But the chemical and
coatings manufacturer says the Iraq crisis will have to
persist for a long time before the company would pass price
increases on to its paint customers. This is partly because
it has adequate inventories and partly because much of its
raw material is purchased under contract at lower prices.</p>
<p>In Pittsburgh, Consolidated Natural Gas Co. says long-term
contracts and the slowness with which natural-gas costs will
rise in response to oil-price increases have insulated the
company and its customers.</p>
<p>"If fuel prices stay up, cosmetics prices will go up,"
says Richard Heath, chief executive officer of Beauticontrol
Cosmetics Inc., Dallas. He expects cosmetics price increases
of 2% to 3% -- but not right now. The plastic bottles used to
package cosmetics are made from petrochemicals and, he says,
"there are already rumblings about price increases in
packaging." But, he adds, "our inventories and contracts to
purchase are such that we probably have a six-to-seven-month
barrier against packaging price increases."</p>
<p>"The economy is weak," says Ira Silver, chief economist
for J.C. Penney Co., Dallas. "So if we recover our higher
energy costs by raising the price of a sweater, our concern
is, nobody is going to buy it." Penney has already marked
prices down this year because of weak demand, and hopes to
avoid increases.</p>
<p>Borden Inc., New York, the food and consumer-products
company, says it is waiting to see if the crisis persists and
its competitors act before it will consider raising prices,
although its transportation costs have already begun to
increase. "If oil prices keep going up, we'll have to raise
our prices," a spokesman says, but only as a last resort.
"It's a very competitive market place out there," he says.</p>
<p>Gene Hardy, treasurer of La-Z-Boy Chair Co., Detroit, says
slower home sales and higher interest rates would make it
hard for the company to raise prices. Profit margins and
earnings have fallen, he says. "The furniture business has
been in a recessionary period for almost two years, and we
hit the most severe point in the last three months," he says.
When the company does get hit with energy cost increases, he
adds, it will have to raise prices, perhaps in the fall.</p>
<p>Even if its own costs rise -- and they haven't yet --
Wendy's Inc., in Pittsburgh, says they're unlikely to be
passed on to customers. The burger business is engaged in a
discount war, Wendy's says.</p>
<p>Some businessmen have contrived alternatives to price
increases. In Houston, Sysco Corp. says it tries to offset
higher fuel costs, and avoid higher prices, with cost-cutting
measures: for example, by reducing the frequency of
deliveries that its institutional food service trucks make,
and avoiding sending out half-full trucks. "We have no plans
to put (price increases) in," says E. James Lowrey, executive
vice president.</p>
<p>Daigle Oil Co., in northern Maine's Aroostook County, is
taking a gamble, offering next winter's supply of home
heating oil to its customers at today's prices of only 99.9
cents a gallon -- for customers who will pay the estimated
bill up front. In areas like this, where the economy is weak,
such promotions are increasing the competitive pressures
against price increases. Conversion of home heating furnaces
from oil-fired to gas-fired, stimulated by last winter's
sharp increase in heating oil prices, has contributed to the
competitive pressure in New England.</p>
<p>Atlas Van Lines, based in Evansville, Ind., a few days ago
filed a 2% rate-increase request with the Interstate Commerce
Commission to offset rising fuel prices, says David Steves,
agent for the firm's Boston affiliate. But the company
decided against a similar request for higher rates within the
state of Massachusetts because of the soft local economy.
"Business is way off in Massachusetts," he says.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, too, many businessmen expect to absorb cost
increases. "We will absorb higher costs until we feel as if
the prices have stabilized," says Ed F. Kruse, chairman and
chief executive officer of Blue Bell Creameries Inc., in
Brenham, Texas. The company is a large regional supplier of
ice cream and frozen desserts. "Some people, including
myself, tend to think that this crisis might be resolved a
littler sooner" than the 1973-74 oil crisis, Mr. Kruse says.
"We're not going to panic."</p>
<p>Some trucking firms in the Midwest are refraining from
passing on their cost increases on gasoline and diesel fuel.
Jake's Egg & Distributing Co., in Houston, is doing the same,
says Sam Sakowitz, a vice president. "The way our pricing and
customers are," he says, "the increase in diesel fuel is a
cost that we absorb, and when it goes down, we'll absorb
that, too." He adds, "We wouldn't do any business" if Jake's
raised its charges and competitors didn't.</p>
<p>But Greyhound Lines Inc., Dallas, raised fares by 2%
Monday to compensate for higher fuel costs.</p>
<p>Eastern Airlines, along with the rest of the airline
industry, is raising fares to offset higher jet-fuel costs.
But then it will turn around and reduce fares in a
limited-period fall promotion. Air traffic usually falls off
after Labor Day.</p>
<p>Bush administration economists estimate that a 50% rise in
the price of oil would promote a two-step increase in prices:
Higher gasoline and heating oil prices would add 1 percentage
point to the consumer price index. Indirect effects, as the
oil increases filtered through the economy to hamburger
containers and polyester slacks, would add another percentage
point.</p>
<p>But those estimates are drawn from the experience of the
inflationary 1970s. With the economy already on the verge of
recession, economists say, businesses will probably find it
harder to pass on cost increases.</p>
<p>Lyle Gramley, a former governor of the Federal Reserve
Board, is one of those who observe that the country's current
economic predicament differs greatly from the 1970. "It's a
much less inflationary environment," he says. "People in
those days just gulped and passed on every price increase."</p>
