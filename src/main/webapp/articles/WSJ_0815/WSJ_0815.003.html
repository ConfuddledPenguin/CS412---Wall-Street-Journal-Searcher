	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Industrial production in Britain rose 2.2% in
June from May and was up 5.6% from June 1989, according to
provisional data released by the Central Statistical Office.
   Market forecasts called for an 0.2% month-on-month rise in
industrial output in June and a year-on-year advance of 3.4%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The government attributed the sharp month-on-month rise
largely to production of the U.K. energy sector, which is
typically among the most erratic segments of its industrial
output calculations.</p>
