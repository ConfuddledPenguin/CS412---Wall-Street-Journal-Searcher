	<p class="article-leader">Industrial Equity (Pacific) Ltd., the Hong-Kong based
investment company controlled by New Zealand investor Sir
Ronald Brierley, confirmed that it sold a stake of about 10%
in the French department store concern Societe Anonyme des
Galeries Lafayette.
   The French press has been speculating this week that
Industrial Equity had been the seller in a block transaction
which was performed by the brokerage DLP James Capel. An
Industrial Equity spokesman, reached by telephone in London,
refused to identify the buyer of the block, which he said was
sold late Friday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>According to the spokesman, the sale of the stake in
Galeries Lafayette was part of a "redeployment of resources"
within Industrial Equity's holdings. "We're actually quite
happy with the company, especially its development in the
U.S. It wasn't a change of perception of Lafayette, it was
more an internal decision," he explained.</p>
<p>The spokesman declined to specify whether his company had
warned Lafayette Chairman Georges Meyer of the sale prior to
Friday's action. Mr. Meyer told French newspapers that he
hadn't been aware that the transaction would take place.</p>
<p>However, the Industrial Equity spokesman said that "our
relationship {with Lafayette} has always been very cordial,
we have a tremendously high regard for them and we tried to
put them in the picture as much as we could."</p>
