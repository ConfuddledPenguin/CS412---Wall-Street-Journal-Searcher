	<p class="article-leader">Imagine a firecracker company that guards itself against
match-wielding vandals -- but allows its workers to smoke on
the job.
   Such muddled thinking is routine, say security experts,
when it comes to protecting the data, much of it explosive,
in many companies' computers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Spurred by media hype, companies have rushed to protect
their data against computer viruses, rogue software that is a
high-tech form of vandalism. By next year, some 53% of
corporate computer users will have anti-virus measures in
place, according to the National Center for Computer Crime
Data.</p>
<p>That's a big jump from 22% of users in 1988, and a huge
leap from 1% in 1985, making virus-protection the
fastest-growing category of security measure tracked by the
NCCCD. Reliable estimates are hard to come by, but leaders in
the fledgling anti-virus industry estimate that the field has
anywhere from $25 million to over $100 million in annual
sales.</p>
<p>Still, data-security experts say viruses, which jam up
computers and sometimes destroy files, are at worst a minor
annoyance for most companies. Indeed, they say, fear of
viruses may be diverting attention from more mundane, but far
more effective, security measures that many companies have
been slow to adopt.</p>
<p>This concern was thrown into sharp relief Monday, when a
fire at an electrical substation blacked out part of lower
Manhattan and threw the financial district into more
confusion than any virus has caused. While no major financial
institution admitted to losing data, several key stock and
commodity exchanges were forced to halt trading as their
computers shut down.</p>
<p>Many financial firms, already hyperaware of data security,
said the experience should reinforce an emerging sense that
viruses, while important, are the least of their worries.</p>
<p>"If you're alert, you should be able to prevent and
control viruses," says Walter Brenner, a Credit Lyonnais S.A.
senior vice president who spent yesterday at a computer
disaster-recovery facility operated by Comdisco Inc. in North
Bergen, N.J. "Something like {the blackout}, you have no
control over. You simply have to be prepared." Credit
Lyonnais lost no work in the power outage, he adds, but
completed many transactions later than usual.</p>
<p>Rick Morrison of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., which ran
its computers on emergency power for most of Monday, agrees:
"We'll continue to do a lot to prevent viruses, but this
stuff has to be our meat and potatoes."</p>
<p>Other meat-and-potatoes measures, say security experts,
include denying people access to information they don't need
to do their jobs; guarding against sloppy input of
information; making extra copies of all vital information;
guarding against actual theft of computers; preparing for
natural disasters; and making sure company policy is
understood.</p>
<p>But the fear of viruses persists. "Every time I start
advising a company, I have to spend the first few days
disabusing them of the notion that viruses are their biggest
problem," gripes Robert Courtney, a computer consultant based
in Port Ewen, N.Y.</p>
<p>Mr. Courtney and others say outsiders account for only
about 3% of data-security losses, measured in dollars. And
viruswriters are only a portion of those outsiders. That
pales beside the whopping 50%-65% most experts say is lost
through avoidable mistakes, such as clerks keying in the
wrong account number without being prompted to double-check
entries.</p>
<p>Along with power failures, another underestimated security
problem, according to Mr. Courtney, is water. "Leaking roofs
do three times as much damage to computer data as all the
virus writers in the world put together," he says. "But
people don't want to hear that. They like their problems to
be intellectually titillating; they don't want to deal with
dumb clerks or broken pipes."</p>
<p>Even in the category of outright computer crime, estimated
to cost U.S. companies about $1 billion a year, viruses come
low on the totem pole. "In relation to all other problems,
I'd have to say it's at the bottom," says Ronald Keelan, a
former International Business Machines Corp. security expert
who works as a consultant in Larchmont, N.Y.</p>
<p>Mr. Keelan says most computer crime can be stymied by
screening personnel and restricting access to computers,
since disgruntled and dishonest employees are the main
culprits. Guarding against viruses is easy and a good idea,
he says, but it shouldn't detract from more basic issues:
"That's like building a house, installing a fancy burglar
alarm, and then leaving a big hole in the wall."</p>
<p>(One exception to this rule, he notes, is university
campuses, where computer viruses have become the most serious
data-security problem.)</p>
<p>Still, companies are increasingly enamored of the bells
and whistles of anti-virus software even though computer
viruses are spread by very specific types of action and are
easy to prevent -- often using free software. In addition,
most computer viruses are easy to recover from, especially if
a company routinely makes backup copies of its software and
data.</p>
<p>But the media's focus on viruses has mesmerized top
management, says Ivan Brass, director of information services
for Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. "With viruses, the
biggest fear is that you'll end up on the front page," he
says. Concern about that kind of bad publicity "changes
spending patterns," he adds.</p>
<p>But like other security professionals, Mr. Brass is loath
to discourage any trend that makes people more aware of data
security -- especially when the threat from viruses, though
relatively small, is real. "Without the publicity," he says,
"we wouldn't be as far along in protecting computers as we
are today."</p>
<p>Fear of viruses can also be used to justify other, more
strategic expenditures. "I know lots of security people who
use instances {of virus attacks} in the press to leverage
their buying," says Kim Bell of Computer Associates, which
sells security software.</p>
<p>Observes Buck BloomBecker, director of NCCCD and a
crusader for computer security: "If we want people to buy {a
particular security product}, all we have to do is say it's
the best way to fight viruses."</p>
<p>Not everyone agrees that viruses have been blown out of
proportion. "It causes more damage than any other security
problem," asserts John McAfee of McAfee Associates, an
anti-virus software and consulting company in Santa Clara,
Calif. "Anyone who says it's a lower priority just hasn't
been hit yet."</p>
<p>Mr. McAfee takes issue with the statistics cited by most
consultants, saying the vast majority of damage from viruses
goes unreported. Though he won't name names, he says he knows
of several big corporations that have lost "tens of millions
of dollars" because of virus attacks, which he says are
proliferating.</p>
<p>"This is something no one talks about," he says. "I've
never had a client who had any interest whatsoever in
publicity about his company's problems."</p>
<p>But most experts, while agreeing that many companies
probably hush up virus attacks, contend that only a negligent
company could lose a large amount of data to a virus. "It's
an inconvenience, not a large monetary or data loss," says
Bill Vance, director of secure systems for IBM.</p>
<p>Clifford Stoll, who recounted his battles with a computer
"hacker" in a recent bestselling book, agrees: "The main
thing spread by viruses is paranoia."</p>

<p>                   Data Damage</p>
<p>Percentage of losses related to data security, in dollars,
caused by:</p>
<p>Errors and omissions                    65%</p>
<p>Dishonest or disgruntled employees      19%</p>
<p>Loss of infrastructure*                  8%
</p>
<p>Outsiders, including virus writers       3%</p>
<p>*Such as power outages and natural disasters</p>
