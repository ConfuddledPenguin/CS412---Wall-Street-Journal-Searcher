	<p class="article-leader">Leslie Wexner has an obsession with size. Just look at his
houses.
   He has a palatial abode in Columbus, Ohio, which he
considers home. For weekend getaways, he has one of the
biggest ski retreats in Aspen. And he has two Manhattan
townhouses, one a seven-story edifice that had been a private
school. All pale, however, beside the 60,000-square-foot
mansion he is building in a Columbus suburb. "The biggest
home ever in central Ohio," trumpeted Columbus Monthly
magazine recently.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In Mr. Wexner's retailing dynasty, too, size appears to be
everything. In the past 27 years, Mr. Wexner's company,
Limited Inc., has expanded to 3,290 stores nationwide, making
it one of the country's fastest-growing, most ambitious
specialty-store companies. Last year, Limited generated $4.6
billion in sales, nearly four times those of the Saks Fifth
Avenue chain.</p>
<p>But many think that the best days for U.S. retailing are
over. They blame too many malls, a weakening economy and
increasingly cautious consumers.</p>
<p>Mr. Wexner knows all this. Yet he's still expanding as
fast as he can. And so far, Limited's earnings are
impressive; for the Aug. 4 quarter, the company reported
yesterday a 24% gain in net income to $79 million, or 22
cents a share, on a 17% rise in sales to $1.16 billion.</p>
<p>"It is our clear intention to become a $10 billion company
with 10% after-tax profits by the mid-1990s," Mr. Wexner,
Limited's chairman, told banner-waving shareholders at its
annual meeting. "That is our dream, that is our common
vision, and that is what we are working toward."</p>
<p>Yet even as the grandest houses can weather, so too is Mr.
Wexner's empire showing signs of wear and tear. In June and
July, dollar sales at its flagship division's stores that had
been open at least one year declined 5% from a year earlier,
analysts estimate. Partly as a result, Limited's stock has
lost more than 20% of its market value since a June stock
split. It closed yesterday at $19.50 a share, unchanged on
the day. Although other retail stocks have also slumped, this
is the first time Wall Street has expressed such doubts about
Mr. Wexner since women rejected short skirts three years ago.</p>
<p>"Investors have been convinced that the Limited is
invincible," says Janet Mangano, an analyst at Jesup,
Josephthal & Co. in New York. "But the company's core
businesses need to be updated if they are going to maintain
their levels of profitability. The economy is slowing. It's
tough times ahead for people selling discretionary items,
including the Limited."</p>
<p>Mr. Wexner considers the doubters short-sighted. Bigger is
better, both for consumers and for the company, he says.
"Customers go where the inventories are."</p>
<p>Since Mr. Wexner founded Limited in 1963, he has prospered
by appealing to retailing's refugees. His stores draw
teenagers (Limited and Express), fans of sexy lingerie
(Victoria's Secret) and big women ignored by the likes of
Calvin Klein (Lane Bryant). Limited also lures working women
who want to shop on Fifth Avenue (Lerner New York) and preppy
men who don't want to pay Ralph Lauren prices (Abercrombie &
Fitch). The exception is Henri Bendel, whose affluent
customers are already served by many retailers.</p>
<p>Mr. Wexner's obsession with growth, however, could be the
company's Achilles' heel. Over the past five years, he has
acquired Lerner, Bendel and Abercrombie & Fitch, all troubled
businesses. Like an old-fashioned 1960s conglomerateur, Mr.
Wexner believes that top performers such as Victoria's Secret
and Express can carry the laggards. He also thinks that his
keen fashion touch and low-cost offshore factories will
transform the acquisitions into mall superstars.</p>
<p>But the turnarounds are taking longer than some observers
expected.</p>
<p>Although the new Lerner stores are jazzy and upbeat, the
big chain continues to perform below potential, company
executives say. Abercrombie & Fitch is still deciding whether
it's a men's store or a fancy gift shop. And Bendel, which
once appealed to a small universe of tiny-waisted women, is
searching for roots in meat-and-potatoes markets such as
Chicago and Columbus. Earlier this year, its much-touted
former president departed under pressure.</p>
<p>Adding to Mr. Wexner's difficulties, a critical new
clothing line at the company's flagship Limited division has
proved a slow seller. And even Lane Bryant, which has long
dominated the large-size business, is stirring concern.</p>
<p>The man behind Limited Inc. seems driven partly by a
powerful mixture of anger and pride. Nearly 30 years ago, his
late father, Harry Wexner, abruptly fired him from the
family's small clothing store in Columbus. "He told me I was
clumsy as an ox and didn't have any aptitude for the
business," says Mr. Wexner, now 53 years old. "It was a very
stereotypical father-and-son conflict."</p>
<p>The company Mr. Wexner says he launched to prove his
father wrong reflected his modest resources. "It was
early-Midwest family room with beams and stucco," recalls
Carol Farmer, a retail consultant who grew up in Columbus.
"But you had to shop there. Les had taste, and he worked like
a demon." Mr. Wexner named his store the Limited because the
offerings were limited to cheap but trendy women's sportswear
-- blouses with Peter Pan collars, madras shorts, Shetland
sweaters.</p>
<p>Limited blossomed along with the nation's growing freeway
system, which provided access to regional malls. One store
became two, two became four. As he expanded, Mr. Wexner
sought out older, more experienced businessmen for advice.
How far could you expand out of town? he asked. Could you go
little by little, or could you leapfrog over geographical
areas?</p>
<p>"Success fanned his emotions," says Gordon Schiffman, an
original board member. "He always wanted to be the best
women's clothier in the country. He was intense, a bundle of
enthusiasm. Finally, though, he asked me to step down.
`Gordie,' he said, `I appreciate everything you've done, but
I need somebody with a bigger attitude.'"</p>
<p>As long as the U.S. economy was in overdrive, Mr. Wexner
could translate his ambitions into double-digit gains in
annual sales and earnings. But now shoppers are cutting back.
Real-estate prices are down. Unemployment has risen to 5.5%.
Talk of a recession is growing. Bankruptcy filings have
stalled classy competitors such as Rich's and Bloomingdale's.</p>
<p>Mr. Wexner has weathered such storms before, but this one
is hitting just when he is pushing an unprecedented
expansion. This year, he is adding 2.75 million square feet
of new selling space to his 14.4-million-square-foot base. He
intends to add over three million more square feet in 1991.
The building is necessary if Mr. Wexner is to achieve $10
billion in sales and earnings of $1 billion by 1995 -- the
pledge that had fueled much of the stock gains.</p>
<p>Mr. Wexner is building bigger stores and more of them
because he believes that customers short of time will flock
to stores set up to meet all their needs. "People's attitudes
and social habits change," he says. "Customers going to a
shopping center today would rather go to a store of
preference, where they can find what they want, rather than
10 specialty stores."</p>
<p>But his bigger-is-better theory, which worked so well for
so long at the Limited's flagship division, isn't infallible.</p>
<p>In early summer, as temperatures began to climb above 80
degrees in the Northeast, Limited managers began to ship
truckloads of heavy fall blazers, coats and pants bearing the
new, hard-to-pronounce Paul et Duffier label. This was well
in advance of competitors. The chain's Forenza label, which
once conveyed the latest in street fashion from Milan and
Paris, was being phased out, and its buyers wanted to move as
fast as possible with as much as possible.</p>
<p>It proved a mistake.</p>
<p>June sales at stores open at least one year unexpectedly
dropped an estimated 5% at the Limited group. Because this
division produces nearly one-third of corporate earnings,
shareholders panicked. In one day, the stock plunged nearly
10%. Since the June stock split, Mr. Wexner himself has
suffered a paper loss of more than $500 million on his l03.5
million shares (nearly 30% of the common shares outstanding).</p>
<p>A recent walk through the Limited store on New York's
stylish Madison Avenue found the racks crowded with Paul et
Duffier wool blazers marked down from $149 to $89. Upstairs,
a group of Paul et Duffier fall coats was $225 instead of
$350. But even at these discounts, little was selling. One
saleswoman, dressed in a linen blouse and cotton skirt,
looked across a department devoid of customers and said,
"It's too hot to try those clothes on."</p>
<p>Limited insists that the promotions are part of a plan to
introduce the new line and that it will fine-tune the
mistakes. But shrewd competitors, such as the Gap, offered
customers brighter colors in lighterweight fabrics. And in
the image-driven fashion business, first impressions are
often lasting impressions.</p>
<p>"Forcing sale prices on shoppers today is stealing
business from the future," says Kurt Barnard, publisher of
Barnard's Retail Marketing Report. "It's grim news for them,
no question about it. The Limited apparently bought a great
deal of this merchandise, and it isn't selling."</p>
<p>Behind Limited's stumble is a bold attempt to lure older,
more affluent consumers instead of teen-agers and women in
their early 20s.</p>
<p>Sipping coffee in one of his East Side Manhattan
townhouses, Mr. Wexner says he has the world's best job. But
he may be one of retailing's most aloof monarchs. This
committed bachelor has said he never has had time to settle
down. Here, where the living-room walls are covered with a
special egg-shell crackle wallpaper, Picassos compete with De
Koonings for space. It is a serene tableau but devoid of
photographs of friends or family.</p>
<p>Mr. Wexner is an enigma in the often-glamorous world of
retailing, where jaunty personalities such as Marvin Traub of
Bloomingdale's have become society figures. After rejecting
his second White House dinner invitation because it
interfered with business plans, Mr. Wexner was told he
wouldn't be asked again. That didn't upset him. "I didn't
think my presence was necessary at a sit-down dinner for
300," Mr. Wexner says blandly.</p>
<p>Even in Columbus, he rarely joins the formal-dinner set.
"I don't think there are many people here who know him well,"
says one prominent hostess, requesting anonymity because her
husband is a business associate of Mr. Wexner's. "The man is
a workaholic. Everything else is basically a distraction."</p>
<p>But if Mr. Wexner lacks social ambition, he evidently
hungers for the status accorded people who succeed at
managing big department-store chains.</p>
<p>Twice he has failed in efforts to acquire the Carter
Hawley Hale chain. Last year, he approached executives at
R.H. Macy & Co. about taking an equity stake in that huge
retailer. Most recently, he secretly backed a management-led
buy-out attempt at Marshall Field. Had that bid succeeded, he
would have emerged as a substantial minority shareholder.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Wexner continues to tinker with Henri
Bendel and Abercrombie & Fitch. Recently he even suggested
that both could well become $1 billion companies -- very big
by retailing standards. This is why some have begun to wonder
whether his fixation on upper-crust customers may be
affecting his judgment.</p>
<p>"He seems to believe that if he is going to be a legend,
he needs to attract the affluent, fashionable, mature woman,"
suggests George Rosenbaum, president of Leo J. Shapiro, a
Chicago-based market-research firm. Referring to the Henri
Bendel chain, Mr. Rosenbaum adds:</p>
<p>"We're talking about serving the princesses of America.
These aren't the neglected women Mr. Wexner has nurtured in
the past. He relishes a test, but this is a much riskier
thing than he has ever done before. There's reason to be
dubious."</p>
<p>Admittedly, Mr. Wexner has frequently surprised skeptics.
Many analysts deem his retailing skills second only to those
of Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton. Eventually, both Henri Bendel
and Abercrombie & Fitch may indeed emerge as hits. "He has
enough income to support what amounts to research and
development," says New York investment banker Gilbert
Harrison. "He won't give up."</p>
<p>But the uncertain futures of those chains underscore Mr.
Wexner's problem. At some point, sales and profits at even
Express and Victoria's Secret, among the company's strongest
divisions, will begin to mature. And Mr. Wexner can't be sure
what will replace them.</p>
<p>This is why he is experimenting with a raft of niche
businesses. Besides Henri Bendel and Abercrombie & Fitch,
these include bath shops, men's clothing shops, children's
businesses and yet more lingerie under the Cacique label.
William Smith and Margaret McKenna, analysts at Smith Barney,
Harris Upham & Co., also think that Mr. Wexner may soon
launch a cosmetics and related-products line.</p>
<p>"The thing about Les is that he really believes that trees
grow to the sky," one close adviser says. "They don't. He
owns some remarkable businesses today, but there are no
guarantees that he will be able to build new ones."</p>
<p>But Mr. Wexner is characteristically upbeat. In early
August, he opened a new Henri Bendel store at the Atrium in
Chestnut Hill, a Boston suburb chockablock with luxury-goods
retailers. To ensure that his entry is noticed, Mr. Wexner
has graced it with a grand staircase, tons of marble and a
gilded dome over the cosmetics department. And with 40,000
square feet spread over three levels, it's the biggest store
in the mall.</p>

<p>LIMITED Inc. aims to be a $10 billion-a-year company with
10% after-tax profits by the mid-1990s. In some editions
yesterday, the percentage of the profit margin was misstated.
Also, Limited's same-store sales increased 5% in June and 6%
in July. In yesterday's What's News column, it was
incorrectly stated that same-store sales fell in those
months.</p>
