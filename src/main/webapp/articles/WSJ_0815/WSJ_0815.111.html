	<p class="article-leader">Crown Resources Corp. expects to report a loss of about
$830,000, or seven cents a share, for the second quarter
ended June 30, but company Chairman Mark Jones told Dow Jones
the mining company should be profitable in the second half of
the year. Crown, which has been producing gold with a joint
venture partner since February, had revenue of about $1.8
million for the quarter. In the year-ago second quarter, the
Denver-based company reported a loss of about $323,000, or
four cents a share, on no revenue. Average shares outstanding
have increased about 37% to 12.3 million shares.
   For the first six months, the company expects to report
net income of nearly $2.2 million, or about 17 cents a share,
compared with a loss of about $618,000, or about seven cents
a share. Revenue for the first six months of 1990 was nearly
$1.9 million compared with about $3,000 for the first six
months last year. The net income in the most recent six
months includes a $5 million gain recorded in the first
quarter on the sale of a property option.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Crown, which is primarily an exploration company, is also
exploring for gold on three other properties: one at the
southern end of the Carlin Trend in Nevada, one on the Utah
trend and one in northern Washington near its Crown Jewel
property. The company said its finding costs so far have
averaged only $5 an ounce, well below the industry average.</p>
