	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- J.C. Penney Co., reporting a
larger-than-expected 15% drop in second-quarter earnings,
blamed the decline on a weak economy that company officials
and industry observers fear is growing weaker.
   Penney earnings dropped to $83 million, or 63 cents a
share, from $98 million, or 74 cents a share, the year
earlier. Revenue rose a meager 4.5%, to $3.83 billion from
$3.67 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Penney attributed the earnings decline primarily to slack
consumer demand -- a problem likely to worsen in light of
what's happened since July 28, when Penney's second quarter
ended. "Rising prices at the pump mean that consumers have
reduced spending power," said Ira Silver, Penney's chief
economist.</p>
<p>Not only that, Mr. Silver said, but higher energy prices
resulting from the Mideast crisis "clearly affect a lot of
things J.C. Penney sells -- synthetic clothes, sneakers, any
product with an oil-related content."</p>
<p>With the costs of those products likely to rise, Mr.
Silver said the company is in a bind. "There is pressure for
price increases" on Penney products, he said. But if, for
instance, the company raises the price of a sweater, "our
(fear) is, nobody's going to buy it," he said, because "the
economy is weak."</p>
<p>Analysts, aware that many retailers experienced soft sales
in May and June, expected a decline in Penney's
second-quarter earnings, but not of such magnitude. "It was
several cents below what I expected," said N. Richard Nelson
Jr. of Duff & Phelps, who in response lowered his year-end
earnings projections for Penney to $6.25 a share from $6.50.</p>
<p>The market responded by skewering the stock, which dropped
$2 to close yesterday at $48.50 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading.</p>
<p>The economy wasn't entirely to blame. "Dillards, Limited,
the Gap, Dayton Hudson, are doing all right," asserted Edward
Weller, retailer analyst at Montgomery Securities. But
compared with those chains, Penney, which is trying to evolve
from a frumpy mass merchant to a trendy specialty retailer,
lacks clear focus and a sharp image, according to some
observers. "Penney is improving its image, but it still has a
ways to go," said Mr. Nelson.</p>
<p>In a weakening economy, completing its repositioning could
become all the more difficult. "It's harder to make changes
when the economy goes soft," said Mr. Weller, adding that
Penney is "caught midstream."</p>
<p>Penney Chairman William R. Howell acknowledged that the
company's repositioning contributed to the disappointing
quarter. "As we bring our merchandise in line with an
appropriate department store mix, we are temporarily giving
up some volume in conservative women's sportswear," he said.</p>
<p>But he added that "neither the refining of our merchandise
mix nor the costs associated with the development of new
specialty businesses would be particularly felt if the
economic climate were more favorable."</p>
<p>For the six months ended July 28, Penney said its earnings
rose 5% to $237 million, or $1.84 a share, from $226 million,
or $1.71 a share, the year earlier. Six-month revenue rose
5.4% to $7.64 billion from $7.24 billion.</p>
<p>Separately, May Department Stores Co. said net income in
the fiscal second quarter, ended Aug. 4, was flat with
year-earlier results of $78 million. However, earnings per
share rose 5% to 58 cents from 55 cents because fewer shares
are now outstanding. And earnings from continuing operations
-- excluding May's discontinued discount store units --
increased a more robust 10% to $78 million from $71 million a
year earlier.</p>
<p>The St. Louis-based retailer said sales rose 9% to $2.19
billion from $2.04 billion a year earlier.</p>
<p>The results, which were in line with analysts'
expectations, sent May shares up $1.625 to close at $46.625
in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. "Some
people are probably selling J.C. Penney and buying May," said
Mr. Weller of Montgomery Securities.</p>
