	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- There are some bulls working in the
beleaguered thrift industry.
   Officers, directors and major shareholders at several
savings banks and savings and loan associations have
substantially increased their holdings of their companies'
shares, Securities and Exchange Commission filings show.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Since May 1, the number of insiders buying thrift stocks
has outnumbered sellers three to one, according to the SEC
filings. All told, insiders at 65 out of 201 publicly traded
thrifts have bought shares in roughly the past three months,
according to Invest/Net, a North Miami, Fla., company that
tracks and analyzes SEC insider filings.</p>
<p>Thrift stocks have been hit hard in recent months by the
well-publicized S&L debacle. And tensions in the Middle East,
sparking fears of recession and higher interest rates, have
driven thrift stock prices down further. Since Dec. 31, the
sector as a whole has fallen almost 18%.</p>
<p>"Whenever you have a whole group {of stocks} come down,
the fall takes the good ones and the bad ones together," said
Robert Gabele, president of Invest/Net. But bargain-hunting
investors tempted to follow the example of thrift-industry
insiders should use caution: Historically, these insiders
haven't tended to be great market timers, Mr. Gabele said.</p>
<p>Indeed, several of the thrift-industry insiders who have
bought in recent months have lost money on the purchases, at
least on paper.</p>
<p>Investors who are selectively bullish on thrifts argue
that, while recession is still only a possibility, there have
already been actual economic changes that have benefited the
thrift industry. Long-term interest rates have risen more
steeply than short-term rates, which is positive for the
industry because thrifts fund their operations with
short-term money, but generally lend longer term, said Nick
Adams, portfolio manager of First Financial Fund, which
invests in thrift issues.</p>
<p>Moreover, prices of thrift-industry stocks already have
the worst-case scenario built into them, leaving them to some
degree insulated from further stock market debacles, some
bullish money managers said.</p>
<p>One of the largest recent purchases by a thrift insider
was made by David Himick, a director of Heritage Bankcorp. in
Taylor, Mich. He bought 32,300 shares in April and June, just
about doubling his holdings. He paid an average of $9.32 a
share, or $301,036.</p>
<p>"Because of the publicity of the failing S&Ls and their
problems," Heritage Bankcorp. stock has fallen drastically,
said Mr. Himick. The stock, which reached a high of $14.50 a
share last year, closed yesterday in national
over-the-counter trading at $7.875, unchanged.</p>
<p>Mr. Himick said he's attempting to acquire a 5% stake in
the thrift because "it's very profitable," has complied with
all regulatory requirements, and its management is "very
frugal, very lean as far as expense accounts." Mr. Himick
added that he purchased an additional 6,500 shares in July
that aren't yet reflected in SEC filings.</p>
<p>James Large, chairman of Anchor Savings Bank, increased
his holdings in the New York City thrift by 24% in May, with
the purchase of 5,000 shares, SEC filings show. He paid $1.94
a share.</p>
<p>Mr. Large said he's been buying the thrift's shares
regularly because he believes it is in a turnaround
situation. "Anchor was a thrift that was short on capital and
losing money," he said. But now, as a result of a corporate
fix-it effort, "it's humming along awfully nicely."</p>
<p>He said the thrift has trimmed staff to 1,875 from 2,500
employees in the past two years, has "peeled off all of our
assets not central" to the primary business of lending money,
and will have enough capital to meet federal regulatory
requirements by next year.</p>
<p>In its fourth quarter ended June 30, Anchor had net income
of $2.15 a share, compared with a year-earlier net loss of
$1.75 a share, reflecting gains from asset sales plus
improved operations. Yesterday, the stock closed at $1.375,
down 6.25 cents, in over-the-counter trading.</p>
<p>At Greater New York Savings Bank, the chairman and four
directors increased their holdings in May by a total of
51,147 shares, according to SEC filings. Insiders at the New
York thrift paid an average price of $8.03 a share, or a
total of $410,710. The largest purchase was made by director
Philip Ruppel, who bought 24,100 shares, increasing his total
direct and indirect holdings 47%, SEC filings show. Charles
Ohlig, chairman, purchased 347 shares, bringing his holdings
to 12,808 shares, according to filings. Messrs. Ohlig and
Ruppel declined to comment.</p>
<p>In over-the-counter trading, the shares of Greater New
York closed at $4, up 12.5 cents, yesterday.</p>
<p>As previously reported, Nathaniel Gross, president of Bell
Savings Holdings Inc. of Upper Darby, Pa., purchased 75,000
shares at $1.50 a share on July 12. The $112,500 purchase
increased his holdings 47%. In over-the-counter trading, the
shares of Bell Savings closed at $1.875, down 25 cents,
yesterday.</p>
<p>Three other insiders at Bell Savings who bought shares in
the thrift earlier haven't been so fortunate. The three paid
an average of $3.08 a share in April and May for 4,100
shares, SEC filings show.</p>
