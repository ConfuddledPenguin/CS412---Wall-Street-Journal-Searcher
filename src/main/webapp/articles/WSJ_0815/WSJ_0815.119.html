	<p class="article-leader">Taiwan's investors are learning some harsh lessons about
playing Asian-Pacific stock markets. At the same time they
are administering a costly lesson to foreign unit-trust
managers who have eagerly courted them in the past three
years.
   Since the Middle East crisis erupted, analysts and fund
managers say, Taiwanese capital has been fleeing the region's
stock markets in an unexpectedly large wave. The flood of
sales has battered the smaller markets, especially Thailand,
and forced significant redemptions in some unit trusts.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts say the sell-off underscores Taiwanese investors'
short-term outlook and limited sophistication in overseas
investing. That combination, especially in light of huge
levels of cash still in Taiwan, poses problems for regional
trading.</p>
<p>The sales follow steady increases in Taiwanese investment
throughout the region since February, when the Taipei market
began a sobering downturn that has knocked 70% off share
prices. To escape sour market conditions at home, many
Taiwanese investors jumped into unit trusts, which offer
broad regional exposure without the need for extensive market
knowledge. They also scouted the region for promising
individual shares, focusing with particular zeal on
low-capitalization stocks in Thailand.</p>
<p>Analysts say Taiwanese investors also exported the
speculative practices common in the Taipei market. According
to the analysts, the Taiwanese pumped up shares to draw in
local investors, then sold quickly once prices were driven
higher. "Ramping," as the practice is called, has played a
major role in the Taipei stock market's volatility.</p>
<p>With many Asian funds showing strong returns in recent
months, the Taiwanese were prevalent among those who took the
opportunity to take profits when the Iraqi tanks rolled into
Kuwait. The full extent of the sales is difficult to gauge,
because most Taiwanese investment is by individuals -- often
with designated nominees -- operating through foreign
brokers, and their overseas remittances are virtually
impossible to track. But last week the Taiwanese redeemed
enough holdings in unit trusts to force foreign trust
managers to unload shares on several markets.</p>
<p>Some Hong Kong-based unit-trust managers report that the
Taiwanese figured prominently in the redemptions. For
example, Thornton Management (Asia) Ltd. says its $75 million
Little Dragons Fund had a 7% redemption. "Almost all of it
was Taiwanese," says fund manager Gavin Graham.</p>
<p>The scope of Taiwanese investment in Thailand is suggested
by redemptions in Jardine Fleming & Co.'s JF Thailand Trust.
Roger Ellis, the unit trust's manager, says 15% to 20% of the
$200 million fund was redeemed by investors. He says
statistics aren't available on the Taiwanese portion but
adds: "Our experience is not a great deal different from
other people's."</p>
<p>In Taipei, the foreign brokers who market single-country
and regional unit trusts, and the Taiwanese banks that act as
sales agents, report a very sharp increase in redemptions in
the past two weeks. According to figures compiled by Jardine
Fleming Taiwan Ltd., in the five business days after the
Iraqi invasion, about 2 billion New Taiwan dollars (US$73.3
million) of overseas unit-trust investments were redeemed by
Taiwanese. That represents 5.7% of the NT$35 billion that was
in the unit trusts at the end of July. Some analysts estimate
that more than NT$2.73 billion has been sold since Aug. 1.</p>
<p>The head of the trust-banking department at a Taiwanese
bank, who declines to be identified, says that in the 13 days
to Aug. 13, NT$56 million of unit-trust investments was
redeemed at that bank, compared with NT$28 million in all of
June and only NT$7 million in May. Redemptions in unit trusts
managed by Jardine Fleming and Fidelity Securities Investment
Consulting Corp., which are estimated to hold more than 65%
of Taiwan's foreign unit-trust investments, made up nearly
NT$50 million of the bank's total redemptions.</p>
<p>"We have received some big, heavy redemptions," says
Christina Sung, a vice president with Jardine Fleming Taiwan,
which says it has the largest share of the island's
unit-trust market. "The ones we marketed the most are the
ones which received the heaviest redemption."</p>
<p>Fidelity, meanwhile, says that it has experienced a lower
level of redemptions than others, largely because it has
relatively low sales of unit trusts that focus on Southeast
Asian markets. Danny Chan, Fidelity's managing director in
Taiwan, says Taiwanese investors are more heavily weighted
toward unit trusts that invest in European markets, which
have been less affected by the Middle East crisis.</p>
<p>Despite the huge sell-off, Taiwan's involvement in foreign
unit trusts represents a very small portion of the island's
investment capital: The NT$35 billion invested in such unit
trusts at the end of July was equivalent to less than an
hour's trading on the Taipei stock exchange at the height of
the market's boom.</p>
<p>In addition to their regional unit-trust investments, the
Taiwanese have cultivated relationships with Bangkok brokers
to facilitate purchases of individual Thai stocks. According
to several analysts, Taiwanese investors now even have
computer access in Taipei to up-to-the-minute Bangkok stock
quotes.</p>
<p>The computer link, usually through a financial-consultancy
company in Taipei, allows Taiwanese investors to be active
participants in Bangkok trading. In addition to the
technological tie-up, however, Taiwan investors have formed
stock groups that send buying delegations to Thailand.</p>
<p>The Taiwanese speculators have caught the eye of
Thailand's market regulators. In a sign of the growing
concern even before the Iraqi invasion, the exchange sent a
circular to all 35 Thai brokers warning them about Taiwanese
investors.</p>
<p>The president of the Association of Members of the
Securities Exchange of Thailand went a step further. He
warned that such speculative behavior by the Taiwanese
threatened to bring the same instability to Thailand that had
debilitated the Taipei market since the beginning of the
year.</p>
