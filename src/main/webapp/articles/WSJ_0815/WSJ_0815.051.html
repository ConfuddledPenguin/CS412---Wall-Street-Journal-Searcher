	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Yields on small-denomination certificates of
deposit sold directly by major banks continued to ease in the
latest week, although large deposits and certificates of
deposit sold by brokerage firms posted higher yields.
   The average yield on a small-denomination six-month
certificate of deposit, for instance, slipped to 7.38% from
7.42% in the week ended Tuesday, according to Banxquote Money
Markets, an information service based here. On a one-year
certificate of deposit, the average yield dipped to 7.52%
from 7.57% for small denominations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>On deposits of $90,000 and up, however, the average yield
rose slightly to 7.53% from 7.51% for six months and to 7.63%
from 7.60% for one year, Banxquote reported. Broker-sold
certificates of deposit posted bigger increases in yields.
The largest jump was on one-year deposits, with the average
yield rising to 7.89% from 7.72% in one week.</p>
<p>Brokerage firms, which negotiate rates with banks and
thrifts whose certificates of deposit they sell, offer higher
average yields across the board. On five-year certificates of
deposit, the average yield at broker-dealers was 8.38%,
compared with 7.87% on smaller deposits at major banks and
8.14% on $90,000 and up.</p>
