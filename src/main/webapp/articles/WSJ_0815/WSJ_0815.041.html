	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- The Chicago Tribune pulled the plug on its
highly touted fax edition.
   Tribune Co.'s flagship newspaper was the most recent paper
to get on the facsimile bandwagon and the first to pull out.
Despite a heavy promotion campaign, the Tribune said its
Tribfax service had poor earnings.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Tribune began sending a one-page summary of headlines
and business news to customers April 4. The paper had hoped
to have between 1,000 and 2,000 subscribers at an annual rate
of $400 by year's end. The product was available nationwide.</p>
<p>The Minneapolis Star-Tribune and Times Mirror Co.'s
Hartford (Conn.) Courant remain in the fax business. Dow
Jones & Co. -- publisher of this paper -- Knight-Ridder Co.
and New York Times Co. are producing, testing or studying
facsimile products in various markets.</p>
