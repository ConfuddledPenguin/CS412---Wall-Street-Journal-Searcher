	<p class="article-leader">So now it is the omniscient beanies who are at fault for
our lag with the Japanese and Germans ("The Techies'
Challenge to the Bean Counters," Manager's Journal, July 16,
by Donald N. Frey). The trouble with Mr. Frey's counsel is
that he believes the chief executive officer, the man at the
top, will make a business successful by his own knowledge. I
doubt that is the key to success in today's business world.
More than likely the revitalization of the heavy-machinery
company, where Mr. Frey was a member of the board, is because
the new CEO is aware of the gains that are made when you
harmonize skills and practice the art of listening.
   Give me that sort of leader and it won't make much
difference whether he is an auto mechanic, bean counter or
rocket scientist. The key is to surround yourself with
knowledgeable people, make some effort to see that they have
diverse backgrounds and be sure they know they are on the
team.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>My belief is that the current president of Ford Automotive
Group, Allan Gilmour, knows one helluva a lot about working
with people even though most of his career and background,
including MBA, Harvard, is as a "bean counter." Anyone who
says "financial control and measurement is all (he) know(s)"
doesn't know diddly. If you are going to run articles such as
Mr. Frey's, at least change the heading from the "Manager's
Journal" to the "Archaic Manager's Journal."</p>

<p>Bravo to Mr. Frey for enunciating one of the most
important problems in America today. Thankfully, he does not
succumb to the common misconception that we lack quality
engineering and scientific manpower compared with the
Japanese and the Germans. In fact, our engineering and
scientific base is second to none. What we lack is a high
level of technological literacy in the general population --
including most business executives and political leaders.
Because of this, our scientific/engineering class is
essentially disenfranchised -- it has nowhere near the
influence it should have in business and political decisions.
This situation could lead to our inexorable decline as a
first-rate economic power.</p>
<p>What we need is full-scale cultural change, and nothing
less. Increased technical capabilities will be required not
only of CEOs but of politicians, lawyers and the general
population.</p>

<p>Mr. Frey's arbitrary classification of "techies" and
"beanies" is false. More than a quarter of the 1990 MBA crop
have engineering or technical backgrounds. Obviously, these
former techies didn't buy the premise that they were "fast
becoming excellent businessmen" while working in a technical
capacity like Mr. Frey's "competent engineer." On the other
hand, to the lasting benefit of corporate America, "financial
types" don't believe that "financial control and measurement
is all they (will ever) know" or that their only hope of
acquiring even a rudimentary understanding of technology will
be through a techie interpreter.</p>
<p>The steady influx of corporate-sponsored German and
Japanese students to U.S. business schools demonstrates that
foreign companies recognize these beanie academies are
providing something of value. Fortunately for the financial
staff at Bell and Howell, even Mr. Frey "eventually
concluded" that the beanies did "have the company's best
interests at heart." Otherwise, we can only assume mass
dismissals would have been his sole recourse.</p>
<p>By the way, the preferred form of address is beaner, not
beanie.</p>

<p>Mr. Frey puts his finger on an endemic problem in American
industry. I would underscore the "essential characteristics."
Having worked in two major industrial settings in which
strong technical people served as CEOs, I found that the
best-laid plans can fail when:</p>
<p>-- The CEO never learns to speak in anything but technical
jargon; indeed, takes glee in leaving his or her
non-technical people in the semantic dust.</p>
<p>-- The CEO uses emerging technology to leverage a return
to old, comfortable products and lines of business well after
they are moribund.</p>
<p>-- The CEO not only does not network into the nontechnical
company sector, he or she openly disdains "non-techies" for
their lack of "insight."</p>
<p>-- The CEO was elevated to his or her position on the
basis of technological performance, by "techies," who hold
him accountable as a CEO more on science than on the "bottom
line" -- until it is too late. They may have never put new
technology successfully into practice.</p>
<p>In many cases they may have done so unsuccessfully, but
were rewarded nonetheless. The landscape of corporate
technology is littered with executives who were rewarded for
winning a program that virtually bankrupted the company
later.</p>
