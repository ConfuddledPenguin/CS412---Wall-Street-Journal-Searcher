	<p class="article-leader">Why are we in Saudi Arabia? We're there to protect the
integrity of the world's oil supply. On that point, there is
universal agreement. The world cannot tolerate a power with
the capability of imposing a tax on all the West, especially
a power that would use its profits to build nuclear, chemical
and biological weapons to extract more declarations of
surrender and tribute.
   By now it should be obvious, though, that something more
significant is at stake in this large and increasingly
multinational military intervention. For all the
second-guessing now starting, the world community is sending
an overdue message that it will not tolerate piracy.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Saddam Hussein is indeed a modern pirate, whose men this
week were literally looting Kuwait of its material wealth and
carting it back to Baghdad. With the world now being made
small by the wonders of electronic miniaturization and
instant communication, it has grown extraordinarily
vulnerable to this kind of threat. If in the next century the
world is to realize the promise of the interdependencies it
has begun to create, it will have to learn to suppress
piracy.</p>
<p>Financial transactions for quite some time now have been
carried on electronically across borders, pulling together
the world's economic players. But it was really only with the
astonishing televised events from China's Tiananmen Square,
followed by the fall of the Berlin Wall and communism in
Eastern Europe, that the world's people began to see that
they were no longer operating as political and economic
islands. Politics, currencies, trade, and yes, basic
political values are all being drawn together into an
evolving consensus of what constitutes a world order.</p>
<p>The Saddam Husseins of the world would wreck this. Their
piracy would constantly shatter and retard the aspirations of
workers at all levels of the world's economic system.
Briefing NATO's foreign ministers last week, Secretary of
State Baker suggested that "the world could be plunged into a
new dark age" if the Iraqis got away with stealing Kuwait. An
overstatement? Not really.</p>
<p>Saddam's seizure of Kuwait is only the largest
manifestation of a form of nihilistic politics whose modern
roots began with the terrorist movements of the 1970s. Often
abetted by Communist governments that now lie discredited,
these movements wrapped themselves in a camouflage of
ideological grievances against the West and in various
irridentist territorial claims. Then they started shooting.
And bombing and kidnapping and blowing up the innocent. This
lawlessness boiled itself down into the Iraqi theft of Kuwait
and the threat to Saudi Arabia and the world oil pipelines.
At this point, President Bush organized an international
resistance.</p>
<p>The U.S. has been here before in its history. Saddam
Hussein is little different from the Bey of Algiers or Pasha
of Tripoli in their confrontation with Thomas Jefferson.
President Jefferson found he needed a military response to
the Barbary Pirates, and sent the Navy on a long, slow voyage
to the far-off Mediterranean. A similar feel for the higher
stakes was contained in Mr. Bush's words a fortnight ago:
"This will not stand."</p>
<p>Viewing the events of the past two weeks, it should be
possible to draw some conclusions about the suppression of
piracy. It requires a leader; if the United States, in the
world leadership role it has held for 40 years, hadn't
stepped forward, Saddam Hussein would be in Riyadh.</p>
<p>Effective leadership, too, requires action. Consensus
follows. Naturally, a leader musters what support he can --
European allies, the Turks, various frightened Arabs, a U.N.
resolution. But there is no time to wait for ditherers abroad
or at home. What the world wants to know is whether the U.S.
will be there to follow, and this is proved by getting on
with the task.</p>
<p>There will of course be doubters. Senator Sam Nunn's early
doubts about a long-term Gulf presence cannot have helped
bring wavering allies aboard. Jordan's King Hussein, who
visits President Bush tomorrow, should be told bluntly that
we will not tolerate Iraqi troops on his territory, with or
without his invitation. Anyone who mentions Vietnam should be
reminded that Iraq has no superpower protector or supplier.</p>
<p>Some of the same people who said the U.S. had no national
interests in Vietnam, indeed, are now saying it is
confronting Iraq only out of materialism. With harder days in
the Gulf likely to come, the President and his men should not
be embarrassed to assert that this effort unites the
materialistic goal of oil and the idealistic goal of world
order. And they should be clear about their purpose: The goal
of deterring piracy requires that Saddam be taught a lesson.</p>
<p>The ultimate objective ought to be the overthrow of the
Saddam government; peace in the Gulf requires that the Iraqi
military be cut back to reasonable size and its oil reserves
put into the hands of a more reasonable custodian. Judging by
the forces being deployed, the option of an assault on
Baghdad is being prepared, but at the moment our stated aim
is forcing Saddam to withdraw his forces from Kuwait. This
would still require something to make sure that he doesn't
simply rerun the same strategy at some future date. Under
those circumstances, we presume, the Emir of Kuwait would no
longer reject a sustained U.S. military presence in his
kingdom.</p>
<p>The current Gulf intervention is grounded in the
clear-eyed premise that the world remains a dangerous place
for civilized values. After much well-earned celebration over
freedom rising from the ruins of communism behind the Iron
Curtain, Saddam Hussein's iron aggression is driving home the
necessary lesson that the new, evolving world is susceptible
to aggression. To secure its future, the civilized world must
now defeat the politics of piracy that Saddam Hussein so
clearly represents.</p>
