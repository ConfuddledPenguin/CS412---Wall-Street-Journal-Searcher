	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The dollar fell broadly against major
currencies, reaching a record low against the mark.
   The dollar's slide came amid signs that Mideast tensions
could be easing. That led traders to shift their attention
back to the weakening U.S. economy and to start selling
dollars.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Stock and bond prices edged higher. Bond prices, which
like stocks started the day heading lower, turned around
after it was reported that Jordan's King Hussein had been to
Iraq and was on his way to the U.S. to meet with President
Bush. That raised hopes that some sort of diplomatic
settlement might be in the works.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.99 to 2747.77, but
again volume was thin, as 130.3 million shares changed hands
in New York Stock Exchange trading.</p>
<p>With the dollar less appealing as a haven, traders
concentrated on growing signs of economic weakness in the
U.S., including weaker than expected growth in July retail
sales. Traders think a continued economic slowdown will mean
lower U.S. interest rates, which reduce the dollar's appeal
to investors.</p>
<p>"The currency market is reasserting the direction that was
in place" before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait Aug. 2, said
Jeffrey Mondschein, a managing director of Continental Bank.</p>
<p>James Solloway, chief economist at Argus Research, said
that while stock-market investors may have been cheered by
the prospect of a cooling off in the Mideast, optimism about
a peaceful settlement may be unwarranted.</p>
<p>Bond prices drew some strength from traders selling
short-term Treasuries to buy longer-term debt on the bet that
short-term prices will ease as new supply comes to auction in
the next few weeks.</p>
<p>In major market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices rose. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners,
852-640.</p>
<p>Bond prices rose a quarter of a point, or $2.50 for each
$1,000 of face amount, in light trading. The yield on the
Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond eased to 8.77%.</p>
<p>The dollar fell In late New York trading, the currency was
quoted at 1.5645 marks and 148.78 yen, compared with 1.5765
marks and 150.40 yen late Tuesday.</p>
