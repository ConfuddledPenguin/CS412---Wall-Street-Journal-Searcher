	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Donald J. Trump named Stephen F. Bollenbach,
who had been chief financial officer of Promus Companies, as
the new -- and first -- chief financial officer of the Trump
Organization.
   The appointment, made at the behest of Mr. Trump's banks,
essentially gives Mr. Bollenbach the task of saving the
one-time billionaire's empire.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While at Promus, Mr. Bollenbach helped engineer a spinoff
of the company's Holiday Inns division, giving equity holders
a $65-a-share dividend. Mr. Bollenbach also has acted as
chief financial officer for Daniel Ludwig, the shipping
magnate who lost $1 billion in a project in Brazil.</p>
<p>He will face serious challenges in his new position with
Mr. Trump, who has never employed a chief financial officer
before. Asked about the task before him, Mr. Bollenbach said:
"This is just like the Super Bowl."</p>
<p>The most pressing problem will be to persuade holders of
$1.3 billion in bonds secured by Mr. Trump's three Atlantic
City casinos to forfeit $215 million in principal and
interest payments over the next year. In return, Mr. Trump is
expected to offer bondholders equity in his properties.</p>
<p>Other Trump assets, such as the Plaza Hotel and Trump
Shuttle, also aren't making enough money to meet their
interest payments. Under a $65 million bank loan agreement
negotiated in June, Mr. Trump will defer interest on some of
his loans.</p>
<p>"There are some wonderful assets," Mr. Bollenbach said.
"The problem is finding the best financing given the bad
economy in the Northeast."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Trump suffered a setback in the Apellate
Division of New Jersey Superior Court yesterday when a panel
of judges refused to overturn a New Jersey Casino Control
Commission ruling requiring Mr. Trump to release sensitive
financial documents related to his bank loans. Mr. Trump's
attorneys are expected to appeal the decision to New Jersey
Supreme Court today.</p>
