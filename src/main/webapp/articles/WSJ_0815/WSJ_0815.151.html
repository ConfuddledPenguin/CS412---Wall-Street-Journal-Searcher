	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Eight publicly traded funds originally
sponsored by VMS Realty Partners stepped up their efforts to
wrest control of real estate properties from the troubled
partnership syndicator.
   Three of the mortgage funds said that they and the First
National Bank of Chicago had taken possession of 19 Los
Angeles area office buildings from VMS. The funds said that
as of June 30 they were owed $154 million on the properties
and that First Chicago, the senior lender, was owed $255.4
million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The buildings, known collectively as the Buckeye
Portfolio, include addresses in Beverly Hills, Calif.,
Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley, including several on
Wilshire Boulevard.</p>
<p>The funds -- VMS Mortgage Investment Fund, VMS Mortgage
Investors L.P. II and VMS Mortgage Investors L.P. III -- said
the foreclosures took place after VMS filed bankruptcy-law
petitions on three groups of the buildings last week. Under
the settlement agreement, the funds allowed First Chicago to
take possession of properties that owed some $43 million to
the funds.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for First Chicago wouldn't comment on the
agreement.</p>
<p>Previously, in two separate transactions three VMS funds
took possession of the Silver Sands Motel and a 55-acre
oceanfront development in Key Biscayne, Fla. The funds also
negotiated the removal of VMS as joint venture partner in a
downtown Chicago condominium development and in a suburban
Chicago townhouse project. VMS, which once claimed to control
a $9 billion real estate empire, raised $1.1 billion from the
public through the funds as a source of mortgage loans. The
funds severed all management ties to VMS earlier this year
and VMS said it is liquidating its operations. VMS spokesmen
couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
