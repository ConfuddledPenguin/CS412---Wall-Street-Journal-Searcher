	<p class="article-leader">First Executive Corp. reported a 40% drop in
second-quarter earnings and a sharp decline in assets that
may in part reflect substantial numbers of insurance policy
surrenders.
   The Los Angeles-based insurance holding company posted net
income of $30.5 million, or 10 cents a share, down from $51
million, or 45 cents a share, a year earlier. Per-share
amounts were computed on 84.7 million shares in the latest
period, down from 98.3 million a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Revenue fell 23% to $440.7 million from $570.1 million.</p>
<p>Policy holders in the first quarter redeemed a record
$1.33 billion of insurance policies and annuities. And, while
the amount of redemptions wasn't reported for the latest
quarter, First Executive's assets tumbled $1.53 billion in
the latest quarter, which may in part reflect policies being
turned in. Assets totaled $16.47 billion at June 30, down
from $18 billion at March 31 and $18.7 billion at June 30,
1989.</p>
