	<p class="article-leader">PolyGram N.V. reported a 20% drop in first-half profit,
largely because of the costs of recent acquisitions.
   The recorded-music company, 80%-owned by N.V. Philips of
the Netherlands, said net totaled 118 million guilders (US$66
million), down from 148 million guilders a year earlier.
Earnings per share fell 26% to 69 Dutch cents from 93 cents,
reflecting an increase in the number of shares outstanding.
Sales jumped 25% to a record 2.18 billion guilders from 1.75
billion guilders.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The decline in profit had been expected, and analysts have
predicted that the company will still report an increase in
net for the full year from last year's 333 million guilders.</p>
<p>David G. Fine, PolyGram's chief executive officer, said in
an interview that results were in line with the company's
plan for the year and that prospects for record sales in the
second half look strong. He declined to forecast results.</p>
<p>In the first half, PolyGram said it was hurt by a drop in
interest income to eight million guilders from 46 million
guilders a year earlier, reflecting acquisitions over the
past year of two record companies, Island International Ltd.
and A&M Records Inc. In addition, PolyGram said, it had to
delay releases of new recordings as it created a new
distribution arm in the U.S.</p>
