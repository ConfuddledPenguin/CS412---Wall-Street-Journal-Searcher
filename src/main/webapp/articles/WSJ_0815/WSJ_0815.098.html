	<p class="article-leader">NEWS YORK -- "Good" junk bonds, despite a long period of
outperforming lower-rated junk, might get clobbered harder in
a recession, according to a new report from Salomon Brothers
Inc.
   In the report, Salomon analysts warned that the so-called
top tier of the high-yield junk bond market may face
"continued downward price pressure" from higher oil prices
and an impending recession. Of course, the word recession has
haunted the junk bond market for more than a year now,
causing prices of most middle- and lower-tier bonds to
experience sharp declines.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But according to Salomon's Joseph Bencivenga, director of
high-yield research, recession fears have eluded the top
tier. "They've almost acted too good," he said, and this
could soon change, if a recession in fact does materialize.
Salomon economists forecast that a recession is likely,
inflation could rise to 5% and oil could settle at $24 a
barrel. In the high-yield research department, Mr. Bencivenga
is taking an even more pessimistic view.</p>
<p>In a worse case scenario, which assumes $30-a-barrel oil,
7% inflation and a recession, Mr. Bencivenga said that "the
greatest exposure to adverse price movement" exists in the
$40 billion of securities that make up the top tier of the
junk bond market. Most of those issues currently trade at 90%
of face value or higher. In the case of a recession, prices
of all junk bonds will deteriorate. But price of high-quality
junk will fall faster because it will come under more selling
pressure, as money managers are forced to sell their most
liquid issues.</p>
<p>One bright spot in the new report: Of the 36 industries
Salomon studied, companies in seven of those industries could
prosper if a recession hits. The seven are cable, coal,
convenience stores, food processing, natural gas pipelines,
oil and gas and food retailing.</p>
