	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The dollar suffered its lowest New York finish
against its German counterpart yesterday.
   For the first time since the mark was created after World
War II, the U.S. currency was still being quoted below 1.57
marks at the time of day that foreign-exchange dealers
consider the end of global trading.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The dollar's worst previous New York close occurred on
Dec. 31, 1987, when the greenback finished at 1.57 marks
exactly.</p>
<p>The U.S. currency just barely steered clear of its
absolute bottom of 1.5615 marks, which it touched briefly in
the midst of trading on Jan. 4, 1988. In the late New York
afternoon yesterday, the dollar hit its intraday low of
1.5620 marks.</p>
<p>Eager to sell the dollar because of the U.S.'s flirtation
with recession, dealers found an excuse with word that
Jordan's King Hussein had left for Washington bearing a
letter from Saddam Hussein of Iraq. Many participants
speculated that the letter contained an offer for
negotiations to resolve the Persian Gulf standoff, and they
sold the dollar on the possibility of peace.</p>
<p>The dollar has fully retraced, and more, to its level at
the end of July, before Iraq invaded Kuwait and investors
bought into the U.S. safe haven.</p>
<p>Yesterday's trading session was slipped into history books
"without a lot of fanfare," said Susan Stearns, senior
corporate foreign exchange adviser in New York for Chicago's
Harris Trust & Savings Bank. The dollar certainly didn't
tumble and at no point plunged; it was just walked downhill,
she said.</p>
<p>But even if the dollar had fallen with a crash, few were
around to hear it. Other than the excitement created by
testing relatively new territory, everything seemed to be
discouraging participation in the currency market.</p>
<p>August is the height of the European vacation season.
Those traders that remain in much of Continental Europe will
celebrate Assumption today. At the same time, the "O-Bon"
season, when Japanese return home, is at its height this
week.</p>
<p>Add to that the lingering effects of Monday's blackout in
downtown New York. Many large banks and brokerages nearest to
the Brooklyn Bridge and the transformer there that caught on
fire were still without electricity yesterday.</p>
<p>Among banks unable to operate were Credit Suisse, Lloyds
Bank, National Westminster Bank, and Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group. Also closed yesterday were two of the U.S.'s
largest foreign exchange brokerages: Noonan, Astley & Pearce
and Tullet & Tokyo Forex.</p>
<p>Dealing rooms trying to execute trades through a
diminished brokerage network were hampered by the loss of the
electronic direct dealing network over which about 85% of
interbank currency trades are usually executed.</p>
<p>With many of their computer screens blank, dealers were
forced to pick up an unfamiliar dinosaur and dial. "People
are more reluctant to make prices over the telephone," said
Dennis Pettit, New York foreign exchange manager for
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan. Beside not being used to
working by telephone, traders missed the automatic
transaction record that the electronic system offers, he
said.</p>
<p>The result, Mr. Pettit said, was "severely curtailed
direct dealing."</p>
<p>All systems were operating normally in the U.S. outside of
New York, but said Steve Flynn, a sterling dealer at Bank of
Boston, "With most of New York out, no one else wants to
play."</p>
<p>Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
1.5645 marks, down from 1.5765 marks when trading came to a
halt in New York on Monday. Sterling was trading at $1.8981,
up from $1.8830 previously.</p>
<p>The dollar's decline was led by strength in the Swiss
franc. Japanese investors were said to be repaying loans they
had taken out with the backing of Swiss bond holdings, said
Ms. Stearns of Harris Trust. The U.S. unit declined to 1.3040
Swiss francs from 1.3150 francs in New York about
midafternoon Monday.</p>
<p>The U.S. currency was also changing hands at 148.78 yen,
down from 150.40 yen in New York Monday. Mr. Pettit said the
dollar was at first only sold against the Swiss franc and
mark, but when yen cross rates became attractive, the
Japanese currency was purchased as well.</p>
<p>In Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar was trading soon after the
opening at 148.15 yen, down from Tuesday's Tokyo close of
149.90 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about
1.5665 marks; in Tokyo Tuesday, it closed at 1.5767 marks.</p>
<p>Robert Mannolito, a New York trader with Commerzbank, said
the thin dealings ensured that dollar pricing went in only
one direction yesterday. Whenever the situation in the
Kuwait-Saudi Arabia frontier seems to settle down, dealers
sell the dollar.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $404.80 an ounce, up $7.90. Estimated
volume was a very heavy 6.5 million ounces.</p>
<p>In early trading in Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was quoted
at $404.60 an ounce.</p>
