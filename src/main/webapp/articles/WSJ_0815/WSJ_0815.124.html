	<p class="article-leader">Tiffany & Co. said its second-quarter earnings rose 27%,
boosted by a sales surge in international retail sales.
   The New York jewelry retailer said its second-quarter net
income rose to $7.1 million, or 45 cents a share, from $5.6
million, or 36 cents share, a year earlier. Sales rose 25% to
$107.3 million from $86 million a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Tiffany shares closed yesterday to $39.125, up $1.125.</p>
<p>In a statement, Tiffany Chairman William R. Chaney
attributed the latest earnings increase to a surge in
international sales in both Asia and Europe, which "more than
compensated for the relatively low growth achieved by our
U.S. retail and direct-marketing businesses." He explained
that in the second quarter, Tiffany's international retail
sales rose 94% from a year earlier to $40.7 million, while
U.S. retail sales climbed only 2% to $50.7 million for the
same period.</p>
<p>Tiffany also declared its quarterly dividend of seven
cents for each common share payable Oct. 10 to shareholders
of record on Sept. 20. Tiffany has 15.7 million common shares
outstanding.</p>
