	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- Turner Broadcasting System Inc. reported a
second-quarter loss of $8.3 million, or 13 cents a share, due
to a $31 million charge to cover losses from the Goodwill
Games.
   Last year, Turner Broadcasting had net income in the
second quarter of $5.5 million, and a loss of four cents a
share after paying preferred stock dividends.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The large hit from the Goodwill Games, which brings Turner
Broadcasting's total loss from that event to $44 million,
casts doubt on the prospects of Turner Broadcasting
sponsoring a third self-styled Olympiad in 1994. Though its
chairman and chief executive officer, Ted Turner, said 11
days ago that he wants to back a third games in Leningrad,
the company's board, controlled by the nation's largest cable
operators, may veto the idea on financial grounds. The
company had set a goal of reducing the $26 million loss that
it suffered from the first Goodwill Games in Moscow in 1986.</p>
<p>Despite the problems from the Goodwill Games, Turner
Broadcasting reported a 22% surge in revenue in the second
quarter from a year earlier, to $322.8 million from $264.5
million. The company attributed the revenue growth to a 24%
rise in revenue from its entertainment segment -- thanks
mostly to advertising and subscription gains from its Turner
Network Television network. Operating profit from
entertainment fell sharply because of the Goodwill Games
loss.</p>
<p>From news, Turner Broadcasting's revenue climbed 13%,
while operating profit was flat.</p>
<p>For the six months, Turner Broadcasting reported a loss of
$4 million, or 19 cents a share, compared with net income of
$5.1 million, and a loss of 12 cents a share after paying
preferred dividends, a year earlier. Revenue during the half
rose 24% to $613.6 million from $496.5 million.</p>
