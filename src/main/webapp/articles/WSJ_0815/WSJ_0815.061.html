	<p class="article-leader">TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- The Florida Public Service Commission
approved an $11.8 million annual rate increase for Gulf Power
Co., but fined the Southern Co. unit a total of $4.6 million
for "mismanagement."
   Gulf had sought a $26 million rate increase.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The commission set a $2.3 million penalty for each of two
years, citing, among other factors, Gulf's guilty plea last
October on charges related to illegal political
contributions. In recommending a penalty, the commission's
staff said the company's president, Douglas McCrary, "should
have known" about Gulf's problems sooner and taken quicker
action.</p>
<p>John Hutchinson, a Gulf spokesman, said the Pensacola,
Fla.-based company believes that the penalty is
"unwarranted," noting that ". . . no management system in the
world can prevent an individual from committing illegal
acts." He said Gulf may appeal the ruling in court.</p>
<p>Separately, two special agents with the Internal Revenue
Service filed suit against Gulf Power in federal court last
week, alleging the company conducted illegal credit checks on
them in an effort to discredit their investigation of Gulf.
It was the IRS investigation that led to Gulf's guilty plea
last fall. The IRS continues to examine the actions of
individuals involved in the political contributions scheme.</p>
<p>Mr. Hutchinson acknowledged that "someone" at Gulf had
requested the credit checks, which he said were not made for
the usual purpose of verifying credit before extending credit
for appliances sold by Gulf. He said, "We don't know who did
it, but we know Jake Horton was in charge of the appliance
division through which it (the credit checks) was ordered."</p>
<p>Jacob F. "Jake" Horton, a former senior vice president at
Gulf, has emerged as a central figure in the illegal
political contributions scheme. He died in a mysterious crash
of a corporate plane in April 1989.</p>
