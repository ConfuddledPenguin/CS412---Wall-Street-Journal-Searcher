	<p class="article-leader">BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- Columbia Savings & Loan
Association, sinking deeper into insolvency and possibly into
the arms of federal regulators, reported a second-quarter net
loss of $136.5 million, or $6.78 a share.
   Columbia cited four factors: an $88.5 million provision
for credit losses on investment securities and loans; a $65
million loss from real-estate investment operations due
largely to the declining Southern California commercial
real-estate market; a $29.2 million loss recorded with
respect to certain corporate facilities, and a $20.9 million
write-down in its mortgage-backed securities holdings.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The loss reduced stockholders' equity to a deficit of
$352.2 million at June 30. In a statement, Edward G.
Harshfield, president and chief executive officer, said the
company "will need the continuing patience and cooperation of
our regulators if Columbia is to survive." Despite being
insolvent, Columbia hasn't been taken over by regulators.</p>
<p>Mr. Harshfield said the latest charges reflect efforts to
"stabilize Columbia, to identify realizable values for the
assets Columbia holds and to position the association for the
sale of its high-yield bond portfolio."</p>
<p>The thrift agreed last month to sell the portfolio of junk
bonds to a Canadian and Hong Kong investor group for $3
billion; regulators must still approve the transaction.
Declining values of the bonds over the last few months have
been mainly responsible for Columbia's insolvency, although
Mr. Harshfield said the losses basically ended in the latest
quarter.</p>
<p>The loss for the quarter ended June 30 compared with net
income of $6.4 million, or 16 cents a share, a year earlier.
For the six months, Columbia reported a net loss of $429.9
million, or $21.39 a share, compared to profit of $14.3
million, or 36 cents a share, a year earlier.</p>
