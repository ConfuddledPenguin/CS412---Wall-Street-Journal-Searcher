	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Drawing strength from indications that
tensions in the Middle East could be easing, the stock market
bounced back from early weakness and ended higher despite a
late sell-off.
   However, trading was light as skepticism about whether the
Persian Gulf conflict will be resolved anytime soon and
ongoing concerns about its economic impact damped interest.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It's a little bit early to get excited," said Larry
Greenwald, a block trader at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. The
market's sluggish pace "indicates that people are waiting to
see what the next move is going to be," he said.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which swung within a
trading range of more than 30 points over the course of the
session, closed 0.99 higher at 2747.77.</p>
<p>Broader measures, which trailed badly Monday as the Dow
Jones industrials advanced 30.20, fared a bit better than the
30-stock measure in the latest session. Standard & Poor's
500-Stock Index gained 0.55 to 339.39, the New York Stock
Composite Index rose 0.47 to 186.10 and the Dow Jones Equity
Market Index added 0.51 to 314.55.</p>
<p>Advancing issues topped decliners on the Big Board by 852
to 640. Volume amounted to 130,320,000 shares, up from
122,820,000 Monday but well below the totals set earlier this
month when prices plummeted. "There's just a lot of waiting
and seeing going on here," said Robert S. Robbins, a market
strategist and technical analyst at Robinson-Humphrey Co.,
Atlanta.</p>
<p>Stocks drifted back to their session lows at midmorning,
but then started to recover amid news that King Hussein of
Jordan was on his way to meet with President Bush a day after
holding talks with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>Flurries of program buying resulting from stock-index
arbitrage fueled the market's rise, traders said. The
programs were triggered when index futures rallied to sharp
premiums to the cash indexes, allowing program traders to
lock in profits by selling index-futures contracts and buying
baskets of stocks.</p>
<p>Prices peaked in the final hour of trading as the
arbitrage buying ran its course, and the market came under
selling pressure near the close. The industrial average
erased gains of about 15 points and stood slightly lower just
before the session ended.</p>
<p>Mr. Robbins said the market is going through what he
called "a smoke clearing" following Iraq's occupation of
Kuwait. "We've got more inflation, and we've got the threat
of a mild recession," he said.</p>
<p>But he noted that prices rebounded after falling about 10%
from their highs -- in line with most of the market's
pullbacks in the past few years. "We could get a bounce all
the way up to 2850 on the Dow {industrials}," he said.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Transportation Average fell 11.13 to 967.70
as airline issues were hit with selling, especially AMR,
which lost 2 1/8 to 49 on about double its average Big Board
composite daily volume.</p>
<p>First Boston analyst Paul Karos told Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report he will lower his 1990 and 1991
earnings estimates sharply on AMR, citing
weaker-than-expected business at its American Airlines unit.
Mr. Karos declined to specify his new estimates.</p>
<p>AMR acknowledged that it has been reducing its
expectations for air traffic growth, based on advance booking
levels. "We don't know how much" the growth will drop off,
said AMR spokesman Tim Smith. Shortly after the close, the
company said it would cut certain fares by 15% to 40%; Trans
World Airlines and Eastern Airlines lowered their fares
Monday.</p>
<p>UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, fell 4 3/8 to
105 3/4 after postponing a planned 5.3% fare increase,
designed to offset higher fuel costs. Delta Air Lines dropped
1 7/8 to 57 1/2.</p>
<p>Advanced Micro Devices rose 1/4 to 6 on 1.5 million
shares, reflecting speculation that the company may obtain
the right to manufacture its own version of Intel's 80386
microprocessor. The companies' dispute over the issue is now
in arbitration, and a decision is due next month.</p>
<p>Bear Stearns & Co. analyst Monroe I. Neff cited the
potential for Advanced Micro to win the case for cutting
Intel's investment rating to "hold" from "buy," according to
the investor report. Intel, which also was removed from the
firm's list of recommended issues, fell 1 1/4 to 37 and was
the most active issue traded on the Nasdaq National Market
System.</p>
<p>General Motors added 5/8 to 40 1/8 after reaching a
tentative settlement with the United Auto Workers union of a
strike at a parts plant in Michigan. The walkout had forced a
full or partial shutdown of five GM assembly plants.</p>
<p>May Department Stores rose 1 5/8 to 46 5/8. Other
retailing issues also moved higher as the market digested
quarterly reports; Tiffany rose 1 1/8 to 39 1/8, TJX climbed
1 1/8 to 15 and Waban gained 3/4 to 7 3/4.</p>
<p>On the other hand, J.C. Penney fell 2 to 48 1/2 following
its fiscal second-quarter earnings report, which showed that
net income declined 15% from the year-earlier level. Analysts
had generally forecast that earnings would be about even with
a year ago.</p>
<p>Sotheby's Holdings, whose second-quarter earnings were in
line with expectations, added 3/4 to 13 1/4. Net income
climbed 26% from a year earlier.</p>
<p>Hanson rose 3/4 to 20 3/8. The British company posted a
27% increase in pretax profit for the nine months ended in
June.</p>
<p>Avnet added 1 to 24 1/2 after its board authorized the
repurchase of up to one million common shares, representing
about 2.8% of its shares outstanding.</p>
<p>Marion Merrell Dow went up 1 7/8 to 31 1/2. The company
increased its quarterly dividend by one-third, to 20 cents a
share.</p>
<p>Cineplex Odeon, which said there is "substantial
uncertainty" about whether a proposed sale of 38 movie
theaters for $31.75 million will be completed, fell 1/2 to 3
1/8. Also, the company reported a second-quarter loss that
was only slightly narrower than its loss from continuing
operations a year earlier.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 1.94
to 339.94. Volume totaled 15,770,000 shares.</p>
