	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- Despite a weakening economy and record market
share gains by Japanese auto makers, the two biggest U.S.
auto makers are raising prices aggressively in what could be
a boon for their Japanese rivals.
   General Motors Corp. yesterday released details of its
1991 pricing. Prices on most of GM's mainstream 1991 models
will rise 4% or more from year-earlier levels. The cheapest
1991 Chevrolet Lumina midsized sedan, for example, will start
at $12,870, up 4.3% from last fall. A Buick Century Limited
sedan will start at $14,795, up 5.1% from a year ago.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>GM's pricing follows the basic pattern outlined by Ford
Motor Co., which raised base prices on most of its 1991
models by 4% or 5%.</p>
<p>In short, GM and Ford are hewing to the strategy they've
followed for the past two years: Raise prices aggressively,
then offer discounts if consumers balk.</p>
<p>During the mid-1980s, a strong yen forced Japanese auto
makers to raise prices aggressively, giving Detroit a cushion
to boost its own prices. But with the yen now relatively weak
against the dollar, the latest round of domestic price
increases could give Japanese auto makers an opening to
reclaim the price advantage that they enjoyed during the
early 1980s.</p>
<p>"The Japanese are adamant about further increasing their
market share in the U.S.," says Christopher Cedergren, an
analyst with J.D. Power & Associates, a California market
research firm. "If the pricing advantage goes back in their
favor, all it does is throw more buyers their way," he says.</p>
<p>Chrysler Corp. has said it wants to take a different tack
to combat the Japanese. The No. 3 auto maker has outlined a
strategy in which base prices of some 1991 Chrysler car
models will actually drop. However, Chrysler is raising
prices on its most profitable product, the minivan, by as
much as 12%.</p>
<p>Chrysler officials say that by cutting prices on cars that
have sold poorly or face stiff competition, they hope to
avoid offering so much in the way of discounts.</p>
<p>Big Three executives often speak of discounts, or
"incentives," as if they were a drug or a bad habit that the
industry needs to kick. Dealers complain that the myriad
incentive deals on the market now are confusing and turn off
customers.</p>
<p>GM executives see it differently, however. "Buyers want a
deal," says a company spokesman. So this year, GM is raising
most base prices, but lowering the prices of certain
collections of options. This revives a complicated strategy
the company dropped last year. Here's how it works: A 1991
Pontiac Grand Prix sedan equipped with cruise control, power
windows, an AM/FM cassette stereo, four-speed automatic
transmission and several other options will list for $16,622.
That's $467 more than the same car today. However, GM says it
will knock $800 off the price of the 1991 car's optional
equipment. So the car's actual selling price is $15,822, $333
less than the same car a year ago, the spokesman says.</p>
<p>There's a further complication, however. A 1991 Pontiac
Grand Prix doesn't come with a cash-back discount, at least
for now. GM is offering as much as $2,000 off the price of
1990 Grand Prix models.</p>
<p>Consumers may find these discounts befuddling. But it's
clear that without these deals, which now average more than
$1,000 a vehicle, many Big Three models now would be
substantantially more expensive than their Japanese rivals.
This reflects, in large part, the fact that the best Japanese
car makers are able to build high-quality vehicles for
hundreds of dollars less than GM, Ford or Chrysler.</p>
<p>During the mid-1980s, the rising value of the yen versus
the dollar masked this crucial Japanese advantage. Honda, for
example, raised the price of its Accord model by 14.3%, or
$1,326, between September 1985 and September 1986 largely
because of currency pressures, a company spokesman says.</p>
<p>But this fall, Honda plans "minimal" price increases on
models such as the Accord and Civic that will carry over
essentially unchanged. Honda can do this in part because of
the weaker yen, but also because most Accords and Civics sold
here are built in Ohio, with labor and a majority of parts
purchased in the U.S.</p>
<p>The danger to the Big Three is clear. Consider the
situation in the midpriced, family sedan market -- the heart
of the U.S. car business. The cheapest 1990 Honda Accord now
starts at $12,345. The least expensive Toyota Camry now
starts at $11,588. The cheapest 1991 Ford Taurus, however,
will start at $13,717 and have a less powerful standard
engine than either the Camry or the Accord. The cheapest 1991
Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme sedan will start at $15,095.</p>
<p>"If the Japanese stand pat and don't raise prices that
much, you'll have a hell of a problem" in Detroit, says
Shearson Lehman Hutton analyst Joseph Phillippi.</p>
<p>In fact, Detroit is already having a problem. The Honda
Accord is the best-selling car in the U.S. And led by Honda
and Toyota, Japanese auto makers commanded a record 28% of
the U.S. car market through the first six months of this
year.</p>
<p>Consumers have demonstrated their aversion to stiff fall
price increases. Last fall, after the Big Three passed
through stiff price increases related in part to
government-required safety equipment, sales plunged. In
October and November, GM's market share dived below 32%, the
lowest level since the Depression.</p>
<p>This year, the Big Three face the added risk of the U.S.
economy lapsing into a recession. "Incomes are slowing.
Interest rates haven't come down," says economist David
Littman, a vice president at Manufacturers National Bank in
Detroit.</p>
<p>In this sluggish environment, he says, raising prices
could "arrest any improvement in market share."</p>
