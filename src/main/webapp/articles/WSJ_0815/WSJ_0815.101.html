   PR May Get a Boost</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>DOES PR stand for Pending Recession? In today's public
relations environment, it may depend on one's specialty.</p>
<p>Often in a softening economy, the public relations side of
a marketing program gets more attention because "it's so
cost-effective," says Arnold Huberman, who heads his own New
Yorkbased executive search firm. "Editorial mention is free"
compared with taking a full-page ad out, he notes. "The PR
agency business booms at times like this."</p>
<p>One area particularly strong now is pharmaceutical PR.
Most drug manufacturers don't advertise directly to consumers
but instead aim their pitch at physicians. Often they'll
alert doctors well in advance of government approval of a
product, since there may be several competing items in the
pipeline. "Experienced product-marketing people in
pharmaceuticals have more leverage than the equivalently
experienced consumer-product person," Mr. Huberman says.</p>
<p>But a marketing sector with little luster today is
financial services. "In its heyday, the industry was
jumping," reports Christopher Polson of Polson & Co.,
Minneapolis. "Banks and S&Ls were saying, `We're not just
bricks and mortar anymore. We're going to develop products
and services and market them.'" Some big New York banks
raided marketing-rich companies like Procter & Gamble and
PepsiCo for talent. Not anymore, Mr. Polson says.</p>
<p>Marketing skills always in demand: a combination of
in-field experience and the big-picture perspective. Mr.
Polson says there's no problem placing such experienced
talent into jobs with six-figure salaries. Often, their fast
track ascends quickly to general management slots.</p>
<p>Using Fresh Muffins</p>
<p>To Attract Fresh Money</p>
<p>THE ADVICE "Dare to be different" is paying off for a
Missouri bank.</p>
<p>Boatmen's National Bank of St. Louis is using high-gloss
sunglasses and gourmet muffins to catch corporate treasurers'
attention in the mundane world of cash-management services.
Rather than send out another letter and brochure, the
Boatmen's Bancshares unit recently mailed boxes containing
English muffins, jars of jelly, a knife and even a napkin to
1,400 prospects for its accounts-payable service.</p>
<p>The product's key attribute is early reporting of checks
clearing a company's account, says the bank's Gordon Horn. So
its muffin message was, "While you're having breakfast,
Boatman's already has available to you the information you'll
need at the opening of your business day." The unusual
foot-in-the-door effort resulted in more than two dozen
warm-as-toast leads.</p>
<p>To show how fast it can process receivables, the bank
played off fluorescent sunglasses seen in the film "Back to
the Future III," featuring speed-of-light travel.</p>
<p>"Banks traditionally have taken the shotgun approach --
sending forces out prospecting in a willy-nilly fashion," Mr.
Horn says. "With direct marketing, we're more focused."</p>
<p>Video's Vogue Grows</p>
<p>As a Marketing Tool</p>
<p>MORE FIRMS are finding that videotape can send marketing
drives into fast-forward.</p>
<p>Book publisher Carol Publishing Group of New York makes a
video catalog of its new titles, featuring interviews with
the authors.</p>
<p>The videotapes not only help distinguish Carol's offerings
in bookstore buyers' minds, they also "work better than
anything" in getting authors onto TV interview shows, says
Steven Schragis, publisher. "It shows a producer how a
segment can be done."</p>
<p>For example, Carol's fall catalog cassette intersperses
reminiscences by ex-New York Police Commissioner Benjamin
Ward with news footage of manacled suspects.</p>
<p>Another book, called "Kisses. . . ," is illustrated with a
string of movie-star embraces. And a mystery, Douglas J.
Keeling's "A Case of Innocence," is advertised through the
dramatization of a kidnapping that is central to the novel.</p>
<p>But Mr. Schragis admits that some books don't translate
well into videotape presentations. The same goes for some
authors. "They may be wonderful writers, but they don't know
how to express themselves orally," he says.</p>
<p>Not so with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The Southern
California Rapid Transit District recently passed out
thousands of videocassettes featuring the cartoon warriors
instructing would-be riders on a new rail line between Los
Angeles and Long Beach.</p>
<p>The video, made in English and Spanish, views highway
tie-ups as a villain named Gridlock whom riders can foil by
riding the rails.

<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>TO GET shareholders to read its annual report (they're
harder to swallow than pabulum) Gerber Products offered a
chance at 100 free shares of stock. The 44-page booklets came
with a five-question sweepstakes entry form; winners were
drawn at the company's annual meeting. . . . To capitalize on
its reputation, the Mayo Clinic this fall will publish a
$34.95 "family health book," described as a "hands-on" work
of more than 200 medical experts. . . . To catch would-be
advertisers' eyes, Playboy uses its fold-out, pin-up format
featuring repeat advertisers in the magazine. One
trade-journal ad shows a sprawled-out Panasonic executive in
a double-breasted suit. The accompanying headline: "I've
appeared in Playboy more times than Bo Derek."</p>
