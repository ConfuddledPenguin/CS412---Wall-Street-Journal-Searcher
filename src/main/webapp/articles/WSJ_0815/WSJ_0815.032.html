	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- The Lloyd's of London War Risks Rating Committee
has recommended sharply higher rates to insure cargoes being
transported to or from Jordan.
   A spokesman for the Institute of Underwriters said this
was because Jordan had become the only conduit for goods
moving into or out of Iraq, since the imposition of a United
Nations embargo on trade with Iraq and Kuwait.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Before the announcement by the War Risks Rating Committee,
insuring a cargo moving to Jordan by marine craft against war
risks cost 0.0275% of the insured value. The same insurance
will now cost almost four times more, or 0.1% of the insured
value.</p>
<p>The cost of insuring air cargoes to or from Jordan has
risen by about the same rate to 0.075% of the insured value,
from 0.02% previously.</p>
<p>The committee also recommended changes in the schedule for
cargoes moving through Saudi Arabian ports or places from
Dammam north.</p>
<p>Whereas rates for Saudi Arabian Gulf ports or places were
previously "held covered," or decided by underwriters based
on individual voyages, insurance for cargoes being
transported by marine craft to or from these ports against
war risks will now cost 0.5% of the insured value.</p>
<p>Insuring cargoes being transported by ship to Saudi ports
or places south of Dammam will now cost 0.05% of the insured
value.</p>
<p>Insuring air cargoes to or from any part of Saudi Arabia
will now cost 0.075% of the insured value, whereas this area
was previously held covered.</p>
