	<p class="article-leader">FLINT, Mich. -- General Motors Corp. settled a potentially
crippling strike here by agreeing to postpone a planned plant
shutdown for five years to allow time for most workers at the
facility to reach retirement age.
   The pact, which contains stronger job security guarantees
than at any other Big Three operation, could become a model
in the current bargaining for a nationwide agreement between
GM and the United Auto Workers union. That's because it
balances union demands for job security with GM's desire to
pare its aging work force. GM officials have said that
retirement and attrition could solve much of the company's
current overstaffing problem, provided the union agreed to
allow the shrinkage to take place over several years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Following a six-day walk out, workers at a unit here of
GM's A.C. Rochester division approved the contract and its
five-year offer of job security by a 97% margin.</p>
<p>The job security promises -- never before made for longer
than three years -- satisfied workers. Only a day earlier,
the workers had vowed to hobble GM's North American
operations indefinitely to dramatize their distress over
plans to shut down a portion of their plant and lay off 600
workers by 1992.</p>
<p>According to the agreement, GM will guarantee the jobs of
all 3,108 workers employed at the plant, including the 600
employees targeted for layoff and another 600 whose jobs were
lost to outside suppliers. The auto maker also agreed to
spend $21.3 million upgrading equipment in the plant and to
seek out other components that workers could build at the
plant.</p>
<p>Some top union officials expressed surprise at how far GM
came their way. "We didn't anticipate coming out with the
type of agreement that we got," said Reuben Burks, the UAW
regional director and an executive board member of the UAW.</p>
<p>But UAW officials were quick to seize on the precedent.</p>
<p>"What's been done {here} should be a model for the
corporation," said Michael Grimes, the top union official at
the AC plant.</p>
<p>GM had powerful reasons to settle this dispute quickly.
The A.C. Rochester plant supplies 55% of the gas tanks for
GM's North American vehicle operations, as well as other
critical components.</p>
<p>Because most GM plants don't stock heavy inventories of
parts in an effort to hold down warehousing costs, it was
only a day after the A.C. Rochester picket lines went up that
GM was forced to close two assembly plants. Three more closed
over the weekend, and another closed yesterday. UAW workers
were scheduled to go back to work at the Flint parts plant
last night. It was unclear whether any more assembly
operations will have to shut down before the supply lines are
refilled.</p>
<p>Still, GM's agreement to postpone the closure of one of
the five operating units at the A.C. Rochester facility was
an unusual step, particularly in light of the trouble the GM
has had making its vast parts-making operations competitive.</p>
<p>GM Chairman Robert Stempel, at the outset of national
bargaining talks last month, cited the high cost of parts
that GM produces for its own cars as a key competitive
disadvantage. GM builds a higher percentage of its own parts
than either Ford Motor Co. or Chrysler Corp.</p>
<p>GM had planned to cut 900 jobs at the A.C. Rochester plant
over the next two years, a reduction of about 29% from the
current work force. But now those plans are on hold until at
least 1995.</p>
<p>The five-year promise may be all GM needs to make. The
average age of workers at the plant is 47 years and the
average senority is 24 years. Many workers are like Levertis
Wynn, who has worked for GM for 25 years and will have enough
seniority to retire in five years. "I feel better now than I
did before, because I still have a job," he says.</p>
