	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Four major Japanese electronics companies -- Sony
Corp., Toshiba Corp., Hitachi Ltd. and Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co. -- announced strongly higher earnings for the
fiscal year ended March 31. But some companies were cautious
about the current fiscal year, saying growth rates are likely
to ease.
   Sony said pretax group profit surged 37% to a record
227.43 billion yen ($1.5 billion), from 165.52 billion yen
the year before. Net profit climbed 42% to 102.81 billion
yen, also a record, or 306.87 yen per share, from 72.47
billion yen, or 241.72 yen per share, the year before.
Revenues rose 34% to a record 2.88 trillion yen ($18.4
billion) from 2.15 trillion yen the year before. The dividend
for the year rose 5.4 yen per share to 50 yen.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sony said strong world economic growth and its marketing
successes contributed to the showing, which it noted would
have been even better without the costs connected with its
November purchase of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.</p>
<p>Sales rose 19% in Japan to 869.48 billion yen from 731.3
billion yen, 46% in the U.S. to 857.81 billion yen from
586.28 billion yen, and 44% in Europe to 715.42 billion yen
from 497.84 billion yen.</p>
<p>But Sony predicted that in the current fiscal year, growth
in sales would slow to about 20% and in profits to about 12%.</p>
<p>Toshiba reported a 15% increase in group pretax profit, to
269.74 billion yen from 234.83 billion yen, on a healthy 12%
gain in sales. Group net for the year rose 10% to a record
131.84 billion yen, from 119.40 billion yen, while group
sales increased to a record 4.252 trillion yen, from 3.801
trillion yen.</p>
<p>Company officials expected continuing robust growth for
the company, especially in sales of telecommunications
products and semiconductors, including one-megabit dynamic
random access memory, or DRAM, chips. "We believe the market
{for semiconductors} hit bottom at the beginning of this
year, and therefore we see conditions tightening up and
demand rising," a spokesman said.</p>
<p>Hitachi, Japan's biggest manufacturer of electric
machinery, said pretax group earnings rose 7.9% to 529.99
billion yen from 491.11 billion yen, owing to strong demand
for computers, industrial machinery and some other products.</p>
<p>Net climbed 14% to 210.96 billion yen, or 61.71 yen a
share, from 185.59 billion yen, or 56.14 yen a share. Sales
surged 11% to 7.077 trillion yen, from 6.401 trillion yen.</p>
<p>Hitachi plans to pay a special two-yen dividend to
commemorate the 80th anniversary of its founding, or a total
of 11 yen, up from the previous year's nine yen.</p>
<p>Overall, officials said, strong personal spending and
corporate investment in plant and equipment fueling the
present 42-month economic expansion were behind their
company's healthy earnings results. They said foreign sales
climbed 13% to 1.657 trillion yen.</p>
<p>In the current fiscal year, they added, a booming domestic
economy will continue to sustain sales and earnings, though
they added economic conditions overseas are difficult to
foresee, with changes sweeping Europe and the possibilities
of renewed trade tensions lingering.</p>
<p>Matsushita Electric, one of the world's largest consumer
electronics makers, posted a 7.9% rise in consolidated pretax
profit, to 571.73 billion yen from 529.45 billion yen in
fiscal 1989.</p>
<p>Operating profit rose 8.5% to 452.72 billion yen from
417.19 billion yen, and net rose 10% to 235.56 billion yen,
or 108.34 yen a share, from 213.46 billion yen, or 99.94 yen
a share. Sales rose 9% to 6.002 trillion yen, a record, from
5.504 trillion yen. The company cited increased Japanese and
overseas demand for its broadening lines of electric and
electronics products.</p>
<p>The company predicts increases to slow this year to 6.6%
in both sales and net income.</p>
