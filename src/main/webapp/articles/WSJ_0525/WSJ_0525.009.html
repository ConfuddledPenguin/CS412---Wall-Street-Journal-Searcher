	<p class="article-leader">L. Gordon Crovitz complains in his April 18 Rule of Law
column, "Revised `Standing' Can Make Political Plaintiffs
Stand Down," that "activist" federal judges in the past 20
years have opened the floodgates to "obstructionist" suits by
liberal do-gooders by lowering the test for a plaintiff's
standing to sue in federal courts.
   This is a remarkable claim in light of a string of
well-known Supreme Court rulings since 1970 shutting the
courthouse door on "public-interest" litigants and setting
stricter requirements for standing. In these decisions, the
court has barred the Sierra Club from suing to block
construction of a highway across Sequoia National Park,
barred the parents of black publicschool children from
challenging tax exemptions for racially discriminatory public
schools, and barred welfare recipients from challenging an
IRS ruling relaxing requirements for hospitals to care for
the poor in order to be tax-exempt.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>When Mr. Crovitz cites with approval a Michigan Court of
Appeals opinion-in the form of a poem-dismissing the suit of
a homeowner whose tree was hit by a car, the column goes from
bad to verse. The Michigan court dismissed the homeowner's
claim because the driver was immune from suit under
Michigan's no-fault law, and the homeowner did not serve
process on the driver's insurance company. The case had
nothing to do with the requirements for standing, either in
Michigan or in the federal courts.</p>
<p>Mr. Crovitz betrays even further misunderstanding of
standing when he complains that a federal appeals court
should not have allowed an environmentalist to sue to block
the Interior Department from opening up 180 million acres of
federal land to development when the environmentalist's only
allegation of injury was that her "recreational use and
aesthetic enjoyment of federal lands was threatened." But it
was not the court that declared such injury illegal. It was
Congress, when it passed the Federal Land Policy and
Management Act and directed the Interior Department to manage
federal lands in a manner that protects "scenic" value and
provides for "outdoor recreation."</p>

<p>---</p>
<p>Invoking the writings of Justice Antonin Scalia, Mr.
Crovitz suggests that standing is a bulwark of our system of
separation of powers and that the foundations of the republic
will crumble if types like the National Wildlife Federation,
in order to protect wilderness and wildlife, can complain in
court that federal officials have violated acts of Congress.
What a load of snaildarter mulm.</p>
<p>Yes, federal courts should refuse to render advisory
opinions at the request of intermeddlers with no real stake
in the issues. And yes, they should confine their holdings to
real "Cases and Controversies" as required by Article III of
the Constitution. But why shouldn't the average modern
environmental complaint clear that hurdle? In fact, many
lawsuits of the sort Mr. Crovitz so detests involve genuine
legal disputes of current importance, aggressively pursued by
sophisticated plaintiffs, in cases where nobody has a greater
claim of injury than the members of an environmental group.
This last element is crucial, and may explain best why our
courts entertain environmental claims that might have been
tossed out in years gone by.</p>
<p>The question is not whether trees have standing -- a
notion on which Mr. Crovitz fixates with unthinking glee. The
question is whether courts will continue to fulfill their
traditional role of reviewing bureaucratic actions, even in
situations where illegality will not cost anybody money.</p>
<p>Personally, I often oppose the positions of environmental
groups, and have done so in litigation. Unlike Mr. Crovitz,
however, I am not obsessed by the fear that the other side
might get a hearing.</p>
