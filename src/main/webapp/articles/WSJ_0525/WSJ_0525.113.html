	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Big oil pulled out too many guns too late in
an unprecedented, multimillion-dollar lobbying campaign to
defeat a single provision of the clean-air bill.
   "The massive oil lobby failed because it lacked
credibility, and it was senseless overkill," said Rep. Bill
Richardson (D., N.M.), co-author of the amendment, which
requires the use of an additive, such as ethanol, to make
cleaner-burning gasoline in the nation's most polluted areas.
With some changes, Mr. Richardson's reformulated-gasoline
amendment was incorporated into the clean-air package passed
by the House late Wednesday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While the passage of the Richardson amendment was a
setback for the once invincible oil lobby in Congress, it was
a showcase effort by an emerging powerhouse -- the gasohol
lobby. Ethanol producers and farm groups -- which produce the
grain used to make ethanol -- lobbied furiously for the
Richardson amendment.</p>
<p>In an unusual battle of advertisements, the two lobbies
bitterly attacked each other. Blasting the Richardson
amendment as "an environmental Frankenstein," the American
Petroleum Institute here claimed in a $1 million newspaper ad
campaign that the amendment was also a subsidy for the
"high-octane ethanol lobby." The Nebraska Gasohol Committee
and other ad-hoc gasohol lobby groups countered with
newspaper ads headlined: "Big Oil is giving America the Big
Lie."</p>
<p>"Ordinarily, we do not go to the public with this kind of
advertising," said Arthur Wiese, the American Petroleum
Institute's vice president for public affairs. The ad
campaign, which began May 8, was agreed to at a CEO-level
meeting of oil executives after the Senate approved clean-air
legislation in early April.</p>
<p>The oil chieftains had been caught off guard by the
last-minute passage in the Senate of a similar,
reformulated-gasoline amendment sponsored by Sen. Thomas
Daschle (D., S.D.). The decision to use high-profile lobbying
tactics was reached because, Mr. Wiese explained, "There was
concern that the message was not getting through."</p>
<p>Besides the ads, several big oil companies mounted
expensive, so-called grass-roots lobbying campaigns, asking
their employees, dealers and stockholders to deluge key House
members with mail opposing the Richardson amendment. Atlantic
Richfield Co. and Chevron Corp. set up special 800 telephone
numbers for their stockholders to send prepaid mailgrams to
Congress.</p>
<p>The American Petroleum Institute, meawhile, also
circulated studies that discounted the environmental benefits
of the reformulated gasoline. One study, prepared by a
California environmental consulting group and paid for by the
API, claimed that the reformulated gasoline would cut carbon
monoxide emissions only modestly, while causing a rise in
harmful nitrogen oxides.</p>
<p>But in many ways, all these efforts came too late. When
the House Energy and Commerce Committee voted on the
amendment in late March, the cleaner-fuel measure received
many more votes than expected. The panel's chairman, John
Dingell (D., Mich.), was -- along with the auto industry --
opposed to it. The amendment was defeated by only one vote,
22-21.</p>
<p>With almost certain prospects for passage on the House
floor, the amendment, with some changes, was revived and
incorporated into the clean-air bill during intense
negotiations last weekend.</p>
<p>"The oil industry thought they had this bill wrapped up,"
said Zoe Schneider, an environmental lobbyist. "They were
silent until the last minute and then drowned members and
their constituents with advertising. Members don't respond
well to such heavy-handed tactics." Dan Weiss, a lobbyist for
the Sierra Club, accused the oil companies of "bombing
Congress with scare tactics."</p>
<p>Even one oil-industry lobbyist, who asked not to be named,
conceded that some of the ads, particularly those that
attacked Mr. Richardson by name, may have backfired. Mr.
Wiese of API defended the ads, saying they were effective.</p>
<p>The oil and gasohol industries weren't alone in resorting
to paid advertising to get their points of view across. The
Clean Air Working Group, a coalition of oil, auto and other
business groups, advertised heavily against the entire
clean-air bill for months. The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers
Association spent close to $100,000 on a radio and print
campaign to defeat an amendment that would require the auto
industry to manufacture one million alternative-fueled
vehicles. A scaled-down version of the amendment, calling for
a pilot manufacturing program for the alternative-fueled
vehicles, was included in the clean-air compromise that
cleared the House.</p>
<p>William Fay, administrator for the Clean Air Working
Group, said industries opposed to the bill should have done
more advertising and lobbying earlier in the fight. "I've
been horribly critical of how industry handled this," he
said. "We have a strong record of cleaning up the
environment. We needed to toot our own horn more."</p>
