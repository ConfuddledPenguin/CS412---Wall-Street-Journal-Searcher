	<p class="article-leader">WILMINGTON, Del. -- Probably no company in America will be
touched in more ways by the clean-air legislation now rolling
through Congress than Du Pont Co.
   As lawmakers work to reconcile the bill passed late
Wednesday by the House with a Senate-approved version, Du
Pont is scrambling to anticipate final details of the
landmark legislation.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Thousands of companies will be hit by the new clean-air
requirements, but the anticipated impact on Du Pont, with its
vast array of products, illustrates the proposed law's
pervasive nature through the eyes of a single corporation.
"From a legislative standpoint, it has probably as
significant an effect on the company as anything else ever
has," says Bruce Karrh, Du Pont's vice president for
environmental affairs. The company, which once fought a new
clean-air law, now says it supports one.</p>
<p>The wide-ranging bill will force factories, power plants,
cars, gasoline and eventually many other consumer products to
be less polluting, at a cost to industry and consumers that
the Bush administration estimates at $21.5 billion a year by
2005. Within 15 years, it aims to clean up the smog in all
cities except Los Angeles, partly by forcing oil companies to
develop cleaner-burning gasoline. For the first time, it
attacks the acid rain widely accused of harming lakes and
streams in New England by forcing coal-fired utilities to
sharply reduce emissions. Factories nationwide will have to
install new anti-pollution equipment to protect people living
and working nearby from dangerous fumes.</p>
<p>Congress and President Bush are largely in agreement on
the clean-air provisions, although the White House is
threatening a veto because of House approval of special
unemployment benefits for workers who lose jobs because of
the law. The final legislation will be worked out in a
House-Senate conference.</p>
<p>As the nation's fifth-biggest air polluter, based on
federal reports, Du Pont is a natural target for the public's
environmental demands. Name nearly any pollution attacked by
the clean-air legislation, and the giant company famous for
the Freon in refrigerators, the Teflon in cookware and the
nylon in Stainmaster carpets somehow shares the blame. Even
though Du Pont is also known as a corporate leader in
anti-pollution efforts, the final clean-air law will force a
series of tough requirements that will influence, for better
or worse, the future of its far-flung operations.</p>
<p>At Du Pont's chemicals operations, plant managers are
wondering whether some production lines might have to be shut
down because of federal estimates suggesting that their fumes
pose cancer risks to people nearby. Refiners at its Conoco
subsidiary are alarmed at a new, probably very costly recipe
that Congress is writing for cleaner gasoline. Still in
question, too, is whether the law will deter Du Pont's U.S.
investment in substitutes for chlorofluorocarbons, the
chemicals that it sells for use in refrigeration and
insulation and that are widely blamed for destroying the
Earth's protective layer of ozone.</p>
<p>How the new law is finally written will go a long way in
determining how Du Pont spends its growing
environmental-equipment budget, now scheduled to nearly
double within one year to $500 million in 1991. That spending
could expand much more in the 1990s, especially to reduce
toxic emissions, if some of the two bills' tougher provisions
end up in the law. No fewer than 80 Du Pont chemical plants
from Delaware to Texas will fall under the law's mandates.</p>
<p>But the law will reach beyond questions of where to
install better pollution filters and tighter valves. It will
probably cost jobs, particularly in Du Pont's Consolidation
Coal subsidiary. Consol estimates that acid-rain controls may
trigger the closing of as many as three of its four
high-sulfur mines on the Ohio River south of Wheeling, W.Va.,
and put up to 1,000 miners out of work in the depressed
region.</p>
<p>Denny Pickens's job dispatching coal movements at Consol's
Shoemaker mine may ride on whether the Senate accepts a
single provision in the House bill. Without it, 337 miners,
including Mr. Pickens, his brother and most of his friends,
could be idled. Mr. Pickens, 38, says he would have to uproot
his family from Wheeling to find a new job. "Except for
flipping hamburgers at McDonald's, I don't know what I'd do
around here," he says. "I just think it's a God-awful shame."</p>
<p>Within the huge scope of Du Pont, whose 1989 sales totaled
$35.5 billion, even some of the law's secondary effects will
be significant. Its electrical bill, for example, would
surely be inflated by the acid-rain provisions. Du Pont,
which consumes about 0.5% of all the electricity generated in
the U.S., isn't offering estimates anymore. But while
studying somewhat-tougher legislative proposals two years
ago, it calculated that its annual bill would soar by as much
as $40 million.</p>
<p>And because the law will provide for the gradual
introduction of pollution-control measures -- many still
unspecified -- extending into the next century, it will
preoccupy Du Pont for years. Many executives now running the
company may well be retired before its full effect is
understood.</p>
<p>Yet for all the hustling the company will have to do, the
law isn't going to make or break it. "It's very clear that Du
Pont has anticipated a good deal of what's in the Clean Air
Act," says Paul Kleindorfer, a professor at the University of
Pennsylvania's Wharton School who studies pollution-control
issues.</p>
<p>After years of fighting off new clean-air rules, Du Pont
has accepted their political inevitability, even though it
still insists that acid rain isn't a crisis and that its
chemical plants aren't poisoning their neighbors. Edgar
Woolard, who became Du Pont's chief executive last year, has
been preaching within the company that its plants will
continue to operate only at the pleasure of the public.</p>
<p>Contrary to dire warnings from industry trade groups, Du
Pont doesn't believe that the legislation will inflict huge
job losses or cost consumers and businesses up to five times
the government's estimate. The company even anticipates
making some financial gains. It expects, for instance, to
expand its own budding environmental-services businesses
tenfold during the 1990s, to annual sales of $1 billion.</p>
<p>Indeed, the new law is likely to create winners and losers
within Du Pont.</p>
<p>Chemicals</p>
<p>Du Pont, the largest U.S. chemical company, has at least
five production lines that could come under scrutiny if the
law includes a Senate provision that threatens to shut down
plants emitting high levels of toxic or cancer-causing fumes.
Production lines at three Du Pont plants in Texas and one in
Louisiana showed up this year on a controversial list in an
Environmental Protection Agency study of cancer risks
attributed to manufacturing.</p>
<p>The Senate bill could halt production unless the neighbors
of industrial plants face no more than a one-in-10,000 risk
of getting cancer from emissions. A different approach by the
House, which Du Pont favors, calls instead for a
still-unspecified margin of safety. Risk assessment being an
imperfect science, the law will provide for further studies,
and the outcome could be years off. Yet the chemical industry
is already fighting the shutdown prospect especially hard.</p>
<p>An example of how the issue affects Du Pont can be found
at its sprawling Beaumont Works, along the Neches River in
east-central Texas. The plant appeared on the EPA list
because it emits carbon tetrachloride, a solvent used to
produce Hypalon synthetic rubber. The Hypalon line accounts
for about 100 of the plant's 1,000 jobs and supplies rubber
for use in roofing, pond liners and auto parts.</p>
<p>The Beaumont Works already uses a state-of-the-art carbon
filter to catch the emissions, according to Jeffrey Greif, an
engineering specialist at the Texas Air Control Board. And
two years ago, the plant began to recycle carbon
tetrachloride from the filter more often, cutting the chance
that the gas would escape. What more could Du Pont do to
control the fumes? "I don't think they could do a lot more
without making it extremely expensive," Mr. Greif says.</p>
<p>If the regulatory pressure on the Beaumont Works grows, Du
Pont will no doubt try to prove the EPA's initial risk
assessment wrong. Already, an industrial group including Du
Pont is trying to make the first actual measurements of
emissions outside the plant. By contrast, the EPA relied on
calculations that ignored conditions specific to that plant.
One condition that would favor the Beaumont Works: The
prevailing winds tend to blow fumes away from residences and
toward a swamp.</p>
<p>A broader, more immediate task for Du Pont stems from
provisions in both the House and Senate bills requiring that
every production line nationwide install the best
pollution-control technology available. The EPA hopes that
toxic fumes, blamed for at least 2,700 cancer deaths a year
and other health hazards, will be cut 90%.</p>
<p>The tricky part for Du Pont is that it has already begun
its own effort to cut total emissions 60% from 1987 levels by
1993, at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars. By
continuing along its own route, the company may yet exempt
certain plants from adopting EPA-specified controls if
emission reductions are deep enough. But at other plants, it
runs the risk of installing new equipment only to find later
that the EPA requires something else.</p>
<p>"Do we want to proceed" with current plans? asks Du Pont
engineer William Walsh, noting the dilemma. "Or do we want to
fall back" until the EPA regulations are clear?</p>
<p>Coal</p>
<p>No Du Pont unit is stung harder by clean-air legislation
than Pittsburgh-based Consol, one of the two biggest
high-sulfur coal producers in the U.S.</p>
<p>Acid-rain provisions will hurt demand for high-sulfur
coal, which makes up 60% of Consol's production. Consol
Executive Vice President William Karis sees "a high
probability that some part" of 10% of its total output --
representing $40 million to $50 million in annual revenue --
will be lost as utilities switch to cleaner-burning
low-sulfur coal to reduce emissions. Up to 1,500 coal miners
throughout the company could lose their jobs.</p>
<p>Consol hopes to make up its revenue losses by selling more
low-sulfur coal. But job losses seem inevitable, especially
along the Ohio between Moundsville, W.Va., and Clarington,
Ohio. Acid-rain controls may force one or perhaps as many as
three of the company's four high-sulfur mines there to close,
starting in 1995. "This is the bull's eye as far as acid-rain
legislation is concerned," Mr. Karis says.</p>
<p>What happens depends on how two area power plants that
burn local coal from Consol's mines decide to cut their
sulfur-dioxide emissions. They can either install expensive
scrubbing equipment that lets them burn local coal more
cleanly or switch to low-sulfur coal from elsewhere.</p>
<p>The prospects aren't good. Ohio Power Co. currently thinks
its Kammer power plant can't be economically retrofitted with
a scrubber and will have to switch fuels. Ohio Electric
Valley Corp. says the chances are 50-50 that its Kyger Creek
plant also will switch.</p>
<p>Consol's problems would hurt the community, which has
steadily lost mining and industrial jobs. "There's a point
where people's lives and jobs are much more important than
what's going up into the air," comments John R. Yanen, who
runs the Ford dealership in Moundsville.</p>
<p>In Pittsburgh, Consol executives are planning how to react
to the legislation. Mr. Karis says the company is acquiring
more low-sulfur reserves and plans to double the pace at
which it develops new low-sulfur mines, at a significant
capital investment.</p>
<p>"I could make an argument that on balance we should do as
well or maybe even better under an acid-rain bill," Mr. Karis
says. But "as it stands today," says Rafael Villagran, an
energy analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton, "Consol is major
loser." It has been slow in acquiring low-sulfur reserves,
analysts say. They add that while companies with large
low-sulfur reserves may grow as much as 30%, Consol will have
a hard time just staying even. However, the company has the
ability "to pull this off if anybody can to make this thing a
wash," Mr. Villagran says.</p>
<p>CFCs</p>
<p>Du Pont, which supplies half the chlorofluorocarbons in
the U.S., pledged in 1988 to stop making CFCs by the year
2000, the date now set in the House and Senate bills. But the
bills also set phaseout deadlines for so-called HCFCs, the
chemicals on which the company is relying most heavily as CFC
substitutes.</p>
<p>So, Du Pont has to rethink where to put the $1 billion it
had planned to spend world-wide on substitutes by the end of
the decade. Though working on various substitutes, the
company still favors HCFCs because they retain many of the
operating characteristics of CFCs but only 2% to 10% of their
ozone-depleting capacity. Yet it maintains that its customers
-- makers of refrigerators, for example -- will be loath to
switch to HCFCs if soon afterward they have to switch -- and,
for some refrigerants, redesign equipment -- again.</p>
<p>"If our customers don't want the compound, there's no
reason for us to make it," says Tony Vogelsberg,
environmental manager in Du Pont's CFC business.</p>
<p>Some environmental groups say that Du Pont can still
recoup its investment and that only tight limits on HCFCs
will spur industry to seek still-better options. "The
deadline on HCFCs must be soon enough to keep the engine of
innovation running," David Doniger, an attorney for the
Natural Resources Defense Council, told a congressional
committee earlier this year. The current bills would freeze
production of most HCFCs in 2015 and ban nearly all
production in 2030; both dates are more than a decade earlier
than Du Pont had favored.</p>
<p>Mr. Vogelsberg declines to say how Du Pont may change its
spending plans. Even before Congress started debating the new
law, however, Du Pont was hedging its bets. Its first new
commercial-size HCFC plant to serve the U.S., now under
construction in Ontario, is designed to make only modest
amounts of the chemical initially -- in case a market never
develops.</p>
<p>Gasoline</p>
<p>A few months after President Bush unveiled his clean-air
proposal with a mandate for fuels cleaner than today's
gasoline, researchers at Conoco's lab at its Ponca City,
Okla., refinery were reassigned to a new project:
reformulated gasoline. Chemical specialists at other Du Pont
labs also were told to study cleaner-burning auto fuels.</p>
<p>Conoco does little business in the nine smoggiest U.S.
cities where a cleaner gasoline would be required under the
congressional proposals. But officials of the Houston-based
company expect demand for a cleaner gas to spread. So, it
already is exploring what will be needed to reconfigure its
four U.S. refineries to produce a new fuel.</p>
<p>Another oil company, Amoco Corp., estimates that it would
cost the entire industry $20 billion in capital costs to
reconfigure the 188 U.S. refineries to produce a new fuel.
David Rossiter, Conoco's energypolicy manager, declines to
estimate the expense to Conoco but says "it's not one we're
going to go out of business on."</p>
<p>Like much of the oil industry, Conoco has big problems
with attempts by both the House and Senate to write a
specific formula for a new gasoline; the industry is expected
to lobby for changes before the bill goes to the president.
Nevertheless, Mr. Rossiter says Conoco sees "multiple
business opportunities" ahead because of clean-air
requirements, not just for a new fuel at the pumps but in
specialty products such as additives and lubricants. "We have
plenty of incentive to be right on top of this," he says.</p>
