	<p class="article-leader">VPI Group PLC, which acquired Donald Carter's proxy
solicitation firm in 1987, sued Mr. Carter in federal court
in Manhattan, N.Y., accusing the former proxy king of
racketeering, fraud and breach of contract.
   The British company, formerly known as Valin Pollen
International, claimed Mr. Carter's alleged misconduct
inflated the price VPI paid when it acquired Carter
Organization. The suit charges that because of the alleged
improprieties, Carter Organization's credibility and business
prospects were hurt. The suit seeks unspecified damages.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Carter, credited with transforming the stock-proxy
business into a tool of corporate raiders, pleaded guilty in
March to charges of grand larceny and personal income-tax
evasion. Prosecutors said the charges stemmed from a scheme
in which clients of Mr. Carter's firm were overcharged and
billed for false expenses -- the same allegations made in
VPI's suit.</p>
<p>Mr. Carter, who continued as Carter Organization chairman
and chief executive officer when it was acquired by VPI, was
fired after he entered his guilty plea in state court in
Manhattan.</p>
<p>Carter Organization specializes in collecting shareholder
votes or proxies for stockholder meetings, as well as
identifying large stockholders that can be solicited in
takeover battles.</p>
<p>John Tigue, Mr. Carter's attorney, said he hadn't seen the
suit and couldn't comment.</p>
<p>In the suit, VPI said that prior to July 29, 1987, the
closing date of its purchase of Carter Organization, Mr.
Carter repeatedly directed his company to overbill clients
for expenses. The suit alleged that Mr. Carter then created
false documentation to cover up the overcharges.</p>
<p>VPI also alleged that Mr. Carter charged large amounts of
personal expenses to Carter Organization, disguising them as
business expenses. The suit said the personal expenses caused
Carter Organization's tax liability to be understated and
resulted in the firm's filing false tax returns.</p>
<p>It also accused Mr. Carter of making false statements in
the sale of his company. VPI paid about $76 million in cash
and stock to acquire the company, and it was to make
additional payments based on Carter Organization's earnings.
By not disclosing the overcharges, VPI says, Mr. Carter
understated the company's liabilities and overstated its
income.</p>
<p>In a statement released in London, VPI Chairman Angus
Maitland said: "We have been more than willing to reach an
out of court settlement with Mr. Carter, but in that effort
we have been frustrated at every turn."</p>

<p>COPYRIGHTED WRITINGS can be used in critical biography,
court rules.</p>
<p>A federal appeals court in New York reversed a lower court
ruling that appeared to signify tighter restrictions on the
use of copyrighted materials by authors and journalists.</p>
<p>The appeals court ruled that Carol Publishing Group's
critical biography of L. Ron Hubbard, founder of the Church
of Scientology, doesn't violate federal law by including
copyrighted quotations from Mr. Hubbard's published writings.</p>
<p>The plaintiff was New Era Publications International, a
Copenhagen publisher of Scientology books which holds the
license on all of Mr. Hubbard's works. Mr. Hubbard died in
1986.</p>
<p>Coming after a series of decisions in New York federal
courts that placed copyright concerns ahead of free-press
interests, the opinion seems to reflect a broader
interpretation of what constitutes fair use of copyrighted
materials. The decision "reaffirms the vitality of the
fair-use doctrine where material is being used for
journalistic scholarly purposes," said Melvin Wulf, a laywer
with the New York law firm Beldock Levine & Hoffman, which
represented Carol Publishing.</p>
<p>The court's opinion relies in part on the fact that Mr.
Hubbard's works had already been published. The U.S. Supreme
Court has granted copyright protection to unpublished works.
And in a much publicized 1986 case, the New York appeals
court created a strong presumption against the use of
unpublished works when it forbade a biographer of J.D.
Salinger to quote from unpublished letters.</p>
<p>New Era Publications hasn't decided whether to appeal to
the U.S. Supreme Court, says its lawyer, Michael Hertzberg of
Rabinowitz, Boudin, Standard, Krinsky & Lieberman in New
York.</p>

<p>DU PONT WINS ROUND in unusual dispute over rights to corn
seeds.</p>
<p>Du Pont Co. and two co-plaintiffs won an early round in a
complicated legal battle over who owns the rights to seeds
developed by the University of Illinois.</p>
<p>Du Pont and Pfister Hybrid Corn Co. signed an exclusive
licensing agreement with the university to develop seeds used
for the production of corn that is high in oil. They sued
Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc., after the company
obtained some seeds from a professor.</p>
<p>In recent years more companies have defended their legal
claims to specific plant varieties. But this case is one of
the first to address the issue of what rights seed breeders
retain to novel varieties when they don't have a patent or a
certificate issued by the Department of Agriculture,
according to William T. Cahill of Chicago-based Phelan Pope &
John, which represents the plaintiffs.</p>
<p>In 1989 Du Pont of Wilmington and Pfister, of El Paso,
Ill., signed the agreement with the university. The companies
agreed to pay the school royalties in exchange for the right
to use the seeds it developed commercially. The companies
have spent about $4 million on the project.</p>
<p>The seeds had been developed over a 30-year period by a
professor, Denton Alexander. Using sophisticated genetic
selection and breeding techniques, he developed a corn with
an oil content at least two times greater than the amount in
ordinary corn. Livestock and poultry fed the corn grow faster
and produce more meat.</p>
<p>Six months after the agreement was signed, the university
learned Mr. Alexander had given five special lines of the
corn seed covered under the licensing agreement to Pioneer.</p>
<p>Mr. Alexander said he had been seriously ill at the time
and regretted his mistake. Pioneer refused to return the
seeds, which the company says is property in the public
domain that it obtained properly. In their suit, the
university, Du Pont and Pfister alleged that Pioneer
misappropriated the seeds in violation of the Illinois Trade
Secrets Act, among other claims.</p>
<p>In a ruling made public this week, federal Judge Harold A.
Baker of Danville prohibited Pioneer from using any of the
disputed seeds pending the outcome of the trial, scheduled
for November.</p>
<p>Jerold Jacover of Chicago-based Willian Brinks Olds Hofer
Gilson & Lione, which represents Pioneer, said the company
will appeal.</p>
<p>The Pioneer lawyer said he is concerned that the company
might have to dig up the seeds it had planted.</p>

<p>ACLU PRESIDENT will step down.</p>
<p>American Civil Liberties Union President Norman Dorsen
said he won't seek another term as president of the
70-year-old public-interest legal organization.</p>
<p>Mr. Dorsen is a constitutional scholar and a professor at
New York University Law School. In his 14 years as president
of the ACLU, he headed its efforts to oppose the confirmation
of Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork and successfully argued
U.S. Supreme Court cases that established constitutional
rights of illegitimate children and the right of juveniles to
fair hearings in delinquency proceedings.</p>
<p>His successor will be chosen this fall.</p>
