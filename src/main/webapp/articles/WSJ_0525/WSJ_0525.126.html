	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Bond prices skidded yesterday after it became
apparent that investors were showing only mild interest in
the Treasury's new issue of five-year, two-month notes.
   The $8.5 billion of notes were auctioned by the Treasury
yesterday at an average yield of 8.54%. That was the highest
yield set at a five-year, two-month auction since May 1989
and was even slightly higher than the previous five-year,
two-month note auction Feb. 22 when the average yield was
8.53%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But some traders said the yield may not have been high
enough to attract investors. Bond dealers said the poor
results reflected weaker-than-expected demand by domestic and
foreign buyers, although they weren't sure why investors
shied away. Other dealers said that Japanese investors, who
tend to buy moderate amounts of the notes, were nearly
nonexistent at yesterday's auction.</p>
<p>"It seems like the psychology in the market just suddenly
turned from positive to negative," said John Costas,
co-manager of government trading at First Boston Corp. He
said that investors expressed interest in buying the notes,
"but when it came time to bid, we didn't see," much interest.
He suspects that some investors may have already "burned a
lot of cash" at Wednesday's two-year note auction and several
weeks ago at the Treasury's huge $30.5 billion refunding of
the government debt.</p>
<p>In early trading yesterday, bond prices were unchanged to
slightly higher. But when rumors circulated that the auction
was poorly received, prices of Treasury securities moved
lower as dealers reduced prices in an effort to drum up
demand.</p>
<p>The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended 3/8 point
lower, a loss of about $3.75 for a bond with a $1,000 face
amount, to yield 8.60%. In when-issued trading activity, the
yield on the new five-year, two-month notes rose to 8.56%.</p>
<p>In the junk bond market, prices of R.H. Macy & Co. junk
bonds plunged on news that a leading factoring firm tightened
its credit standards toward the retailer.</p>
<p>Some Macy bonds fell five points, or $50 for a bond with a
$1,000 face amount, and yields spurted as high as 25%.</p>
<p>Henry Kassebaum, a senior vice president at Heller
Financial Corp., confirmed rumors that Heller Financial
shifted from a "revolving credit" policy toward Macy
suppliers to an "order-by-order" policy. Instead of extending
a revolving credit line to Macy suppliers, Heller will now
decide whether to extend credit to suppliers on an
order-by-order basis.</p>
<p>In response, Macy's 14.5% subordinated debentures,
maturing in 2001, fell more than five points to 57. The
retailer's 14.5% senior subordinated debentures, due in 1998,
also shed five points to end at 67.</p>
<p>Factoring companies like Heller buy receivables at a
slight discount from suppliers that sell goods to retailers.
A supplier is paid in cash for its receivables and the
factoring agent assumes the risk that the retailer will pay
its bills.</p>
<p>The problems of Macy's pulled the entire junk bond market
lower, with most issues ending between 1/4 and 1/2 point
lower. Market participants expect bids for the bonds to
weaken further when the market opens today.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>U.S. Treasury notes and bonds traded lower after the
government's $8.5 billion auction of new five-year, two-month
Treasury notes failed to stir enthusiasm in investors.</p>
<p>The auction results were unexpected, especially coming
after a successful twoyear note auction on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at
a price of 101 13/32 compared with 101 27/32 on Wednesday.
The latest 10-year notes ended at 101 16/32 to yield 8.63%
compared with 101 27/32 to yield 8.58%.</p>
<p>Short-term rates were higher. The discount rate on
three-month Treasury bills ended at 7.68% for a bond
equivalent yield of 7.92% while the rate on six-month bills
fell to 7.71% to yield 8.11%.</p>
<p>Here are details of yesterday's fiveyear, two-month note
auction:</p>
<p>Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.</p>
<p> Applications ..................  $21,930,425,000</p>
<p> Accepted bids .................   $8,502,104,000</p>
<p> Accepted at low price .........              93%</p>
<p> Accepted noncompetitively .....     $593,000,000
</p>
<p> High price (Rate) .............   99.847 (8.52%)</p>
<p> Low price (Rate) ..............   99.681 (8.56%)</p>
<p> Interest rate .................           8 1/2%</p>
<p>The notes are dated June 1 and mature August 15, 1995.</p>
<p>Junk Bonds</p>
<p>The problems of R.H. Macy's spread to the broader junk
bond market, pushing prices moderately lower.</p>
<p>Besides Macy's, other big decliners included RJR Nabisco
Inc., whose bonds fell on talk that a major investor was
dumping large amounts of the bonds.</p>
<p>RJR Nabisco's 14.07% convertible payin-kind debentures,
due in 2009, finished down 1 1/2 points to close at 84 on the
New York Stock Exchange. The other widely held RJR issue, the
14.07% exchangable pay-in-kind debentures, maturing in 2007,
ended 1 3/8 points lower to close at 70 1/4.</p>
<p>Duracell Holdings' 13.5% subordinated debentures, maturing
in 2000, dropped 1/4 point to end at 103, while Kroger's 12
7/8% senior subordinated debentures, due in 1999, shed 1/2
point to 102 1/4.</p>
<p>In the investment-grade market, actively traded corporate
issues fell 1/4 to 3/8 point.</p>
<p>Mortgage-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Mortgage securities posted small price advances, outpacing
Treasurys and causing yield spreads to tighten slightly.</p>
<p>Government National Mortgage Association 9% bonds for June
delivery firmed 1/32 to 96 for a yield of 9.72%, 1.10
percentage points above the yield on 10-year Treasury notes.
That spread is 0.02 percentage point tighter than late
Wednesday.</p>
<p>Among other actively traded issues, Ginnie Mae 9.5% bonds
for June delivery were up 1/32 at 98 14/32; Ginnie Mae 10%
bonds were at 100 7/8, up 3/32; Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corp. 9.5% bonds for June delivery were up 2/32 at 97 31/32
and June Federal National Mortgage Association 9.5% bonds
were trading 2/32 higher at 98 15/32.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, activity remained at a standstill in the market
for high-coupon mortgage securities in the aftermath of the
Public Securities Association statement Tuesday that it will
impose trading curbs on certain high-coupon mortgage issues
that are experiencing rapid prepayment rates.</p>
<p>The PSA's move is aimed at stemming the recent issuance of
above-market mortgages, used as collateral mainly for GNMA
mortgage-backed securities, that are often prepaid quickly to
refinance more quickly than usual. For investors who have
been paying premiums for those issues, expecting prepayment
to come much later, the value of their purchases has been
sharply reduced.</p>
<p>Municipals</p>
<p>In a repeat performance of Wednesday's lifeless trading,
most actively traded municipal bonds finished rock steady
after barely budging all session.</p>
<p>"It's basically a sideways market in municipals," said
Lewis Nassikas, a trader at First Albany Corp. Trading, he
added, was particularly light with market participants
sluggish before the long Memorial Day weekend.</p>
<p>There was little response to the revised U.S. gross
national product data for the first quarter.</p>
<p>GNP was revised downward to a 1.3% annual rate from the
2.1% pace originally estimated last month. Inventory
reduction was the chief reason for the revision.</p>
<p>Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report
had forecast, on average, an updated first-quarter clip of
1.8%.</p>
<p>In secondary activity, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% bonds of 2018 were unchanged at 97 7/8 in late trading,
yielding 7.37%.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>A stronger yen and speculation that some banks will soon
cut the prime rate triggered a modest rally in the Japanese
government bond market.</p>
<p>Japan's prime rate, a benchmark long-term loan rate, is
currently 7.9%. The rate is set monthly by three large credit
banks, which are expected to cut the prime rate to 7.6%,
effective June 1. The announcement could come as early as
today.</p>
<p>Japan's bond market rally was muted, however, because
investors believe the Bank of Japan will continue to put
upward pressure on short-term interest rates, over which the
central bank has the most immediate influence. Economists
said the central bank wants short-term rates to remain high
in order to support the value of the yen, among other things.</p>
<p>Japan's benchmark 10-year bond rose 0.14 point to 87.71
yesterday to yield 7.02%. (The yield is calculated in local
terms, but would be much lower if calculated by the
semi-annual compound measure that is used in the U.S.)</p>
<p>Financial markets were closed in West Germany, France,
Switzerland and Holland in observance of Ascension Day.</p>
<p>In Britain, where trading activity was quiet due to the
holiday in other countries, government bonds ended moderately
lower.</p>
