	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The New York Stock Exchange barred from
membership a former Teletype operator for Smith Barney,
Harris Upham & Co., who the Big Board said misappropriated an
attache case, containing $12,700, that an exchange member
left on the trading floor.
   The exchange also found that the teletypist, Cosimo Louis
Pellegrino, a resident of Brooklyn, made material
misstatements to the Big Board in connection with the
incident.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Pellegrino couldn't be reached for comment. Smith
Barney declined to comment.</p>
<p>In January 1988, the exchange said, a floor broker, whom
the exchange declined to identify, left the attache case on
the floor of his booth and then left the area. When the
broker returned, the case was missing.</p>
<p>The floor broker asked Mr. Pellegrino about it, and the
teletypist told him that an individual who worked on the
floor took the briefcase. Mr. Pellegrino also said he would
try to get it back. A couple of days later, Mr. Pellegrino
returned the attache case to the broker, but $900 of the
$12,700 was missing.</p>
<p>It is uncommon, but not unheard of, for floor brokers to
have cash on the exchange floor; some independent brokers use
their booths on the floor as offices and may have some cash
around for operations or personal reasons.</p>
<p>Mr. Pellegrino gave the Big Board the alleged
perpetrator's name and address and said he worked on the
floor. The exchange checked its employment records,
interviewed floor employees, sent certified letters to the
address Mr. Pellegrino provided, contacted the owner of the
building there, and tried to get a phone number for the
individual, all to no avail.</p>
<p>An exchange hearing panel found that Mr. Pellegrino took
the case and lied about how he got it.</p>
