	<p class="article-leader">SEOUL -- After overnight talks, Hyundai Motor Co.'s union
signed a revised new labor contract with the company.
   Union President Lee Sang-bum, who signed the document,
said the union's leadership decided to tell some 27,000 union
members to return to work at Hyundai's Ulsan plant by ending
the strike that began May 15.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The plant, 160 miles southeast of Seoul, is South Korea's
largest auto plant. Hyundai Motor is a unit of Hyundai Corp.</p>
<p>The union president told reporters that the union
leadership decided to effect the new contract without putting
it to a vote of members.</p>
<p>The union and the management had to renegotiate after a
proposed earlier contract agreed upon through negotiations
was voted down by a majority of union workers in a general
meeting Tuesday. They said the union's demands weren't fully
met.</p>
<p>The contract contained an average monthly pay increase of
7.6% or a raise of $54.93. In addition, it calls for an
average increase of $20.91 in production and other monthly
allowances, up $5.35 dollars from the amount in the rejected
contract.</p>
<p>The union had demanded a 19% increase in their monthly
average pay of $621 while the company had offered a 6% raise.</p>
