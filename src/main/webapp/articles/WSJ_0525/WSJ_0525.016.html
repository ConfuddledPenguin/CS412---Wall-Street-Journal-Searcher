	<p class="article-leader">HIGH HOPES? Voters see the Soviet summit yielding even
better relations.
   Fifty-four percent say the impending meeting can
substantially improve ties, according to a new Wall Street
Journal/NBC News poll. "Gorbachev's popularity is the
linchpin to U.S.-Soviet relations," say pollsters Peter Hart
and Robert Teeter, who conducted the survey for the Journal
and NBC. Despite the Soviet leader's Baltic, economic and
other woes, some 59% of U.S. voters view him positively, up
from 51% in December.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But skepticism remains. By 50% to 38%, voters oppose
helping strengthen the Soviet economy; in December, such
support was favored by 45% to 40%. Voters are closely divided
on whether the Soviets can be trusted to live up to
arms-control agreements. If Gorbachev were no longer in
power, voters would distrust the Soviets by three to one, but
64% predict he will still be in charge two years from now.</p>
<p>Voters split evenly on whether Soviet recognition of
Lithuanian independence should be a condition of any new
accords -- something Bush won't demand, and Gorbachev
wouldn't accept.</p>
<p>DUMP QUAYLE? Voters would rather see Baker as Bush's 1992
running mate.</p>
<p>Those polled prefer the secretary of state for the ticket
over Quayle by nearly two to one; Republicans favor Baker by
43% to 35%. "Particularly if the economy is bad, the
president is going to have to choose someone else," asserts
one GOP strategist.</p>
<p>Only 29% of the 1,007 registered voters surveyed between
Friday and Tuesday hold positive views of Quayle, while 37%
view him negatively; despite concerted administration efforts
to burnish the vice president's image, those numbers are
virtually identical to soundings taken last November and
March. Baker's positive-negative ratio is 44%-20%. On the
other hand, he still doesn't match Gorbachev's 59%-16%.</p>
<p>VOTER EDGINESS could nudge Bush toward a budget deal with
Congress.</p>
<p>While the president's job-approval remains high, at 72%,
the percentage who say the country is generally going in the
right direction dips to 42%-38%, down from 47%-32% a month
ago. Bush's slipping economic approval rating could also
provide impetus for an accord.</p>
<p>White House aides insist that a genuine, long-term fix
would be a potent political winner, easily outweighing any
flak he takes if he goes back on his no-new-taxes pledge. But
some would prefer no deal at all to a modest one that might
make it appear he gave up too readily on taxes.</p>
<p>A key to selling any deal, aides believe, will be
convincing Americans that it restores "sanity" to the budget
process.</p>
<p>RECESSION FEARS return to earlier levels after a brief
burst of optimism last month. In the new Journal/NBC poll,
30% expect a downturn in the next year. That is up from 23%
last month, but equal to the figures for January and March.</p>
<p>REPUBLICANS GAIN in voter intentions for this year's House
races. Thirty-four percent say they plan to vote for the GOP
candidate in their district, while 33% say they'll vote
Democratic. Democrats had been consistently leading in that
barometer since last September.</p>
<p>DEMOCRATS SEE a political edge in the pending
parental-leave bill. In the poll, nearly seven in 10 support
such a law even if it would mean additional costs to
businesses. Even some GOP lawmakers like Rep. Martin, running
for the Senate in Illinois, break with Bush on the issue.</p>
<p>NO NUKES in Europe shouldn't be the U.S. goal, voters
believe. Seven of 10 agree that the U.S. should always
maintain some nuclear weapons there, while only 22% say
almost all such weapons should eventually be removed.</p>
<p>HOSTAGE HOLDUP: Hope fades that more releases are coming.</p>
<p>U.S. analysts say Lebanese Shiites rebuff Iran's bids for
more releases. Bush's small signals to Iran after Reed and
Polhill were freed fail to impress the hostage-holders as
expressions of good will. "They aren't viewing these as
reciprocal gestures," says one U.S. official. "They believed
us when we said they weren't linked to hostages."</p>
<p>Bush remains wary of any stronger steps that might make it
appear he is negotiating with the terrorists. Voters in the
Journal/NBC poll approve his handling of the hostage
situation by two to one, but they are deeply split over
whether the U.S. should negotiate directly with the
hostage-holders; 48% oppose such dealings, while 45% favor
them.</p>
<p>Forty-eight percent favor pressuring Israel to release
Arab prisoners to help gain the release of the U.S. hostages,
while 43% oppose such pressure.</p>
<p>MINOR MEMOS: Gender Gapski: While 64% of men view
Gorbachev positively, only 53% of women do. . . . Traitors to
their class? Fifty-seven percent of voters with incomes over
$50,000 would rather see higher taxes on upper-income
taxpayers than an increase in the gasoline tax. . . . The
G-8? By better than four to one, respondents would approve
inviting the Soviets to join in the economic summit of the
seven leading industrialized nations.</p>
