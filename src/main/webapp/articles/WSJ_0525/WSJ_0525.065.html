	<p class="article-leader">The information revolution, ushered in by the personal
computer, has been hijacked by the telephone.
   While the boom in videotex information services delivered
by PC keeps receding into the future, the market for
information and entertainment services delivered via
telephone lines has exploded, with analysts predicting growth
rates of 40% or more over the next five years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The range of telephone-information services is limited
only by the entrepreneurial imagination. Most are toll-free
800 numbers or 900 numbers, for which callers pay. There are
services that virtually everyone has called at least once,
such as time, weather or sports numbers. Adult and chat lines
are commonplace and profitable, too, although analysts say
their use is now declining.</p>
<p>But the variety of services that can be easily accessed
simply by poking numbers and letters on a touch-tone phone
goes much further. Is your diet center's appetite for cash
hard to swallow? Call the USA-DIET line and a computerized
voice will direct you to punch in personal information on
your age, height, weight and medical history before
delivering a custom diet plan for about $30 a month. Tired of
arguing with the know-it-all next door over the outcome of an
old boxing match? Button his lips by calling Boxing Line and
having him listen to the bout's blow-by-blow as it was
recorded 40 years ago.</p>
<p>Brokerage firms and banks, many having abandoned attempts
to serve customers using home computers, are beginning to
offer account information and even transaction services by
telephone. Newspapers are augmenting printed information with
quick updates via phone. And advertisers are beginning to use
the new lines to promote their products.</p>
<p>There's even a line that tells you how to set up a line.
Call 900-USA-INFO and a recording by W. Brooks McCarty, who
runs a one-man company called Information 900 Service Corp.,
based in New York, will tell you how. It costs about $12 for
the average 11 minutes it takes to get the information. Mr.
McCarty has also designed a system that will set up a
customer's program at no upfront charge, although he keeps 20
cents on each call that's made to the number. "I can take
your order, run it through my system and have you operating
by tomorrow," he says.</p>
<p>With much of the telephone-information business --
commonly referred to as audiotex -- still in private hands,
its size is hard to gauge. But Link Resources Corp., a New
York research firm, says that phone company revenue alone
from carrying telephone-information traffic will grow 54% to
$825 million next year from $550 million in 1990. By 1994,
revenue will hit $1.5 billion, says Stephen Reynolds, Link's
voice information services analyst.</p>
<p>But that estimate includes only calls to 900 numbers. It
doesn't cover revenue that programming companies take in. Nor
does it include revenue from local information services such
as weather lines and toll-free or sponsor-paid 800 calls,
advertising and promotional services or even equipment sales.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the videotex market, led in particular by
Prodigy Service Co., a joint venture of International
Business Machines Corp. and Sears, Roebuck & Co., had revenue
totaling $234 million last year and is growing about 25% a
year, says Mr. Reynolds.</p>
<p>"All the projections suggest that {audiotex} is going to
be a very big medium," says Andy Fraser, Saatchi North
America's executive vice president and director of business
development. "Of course, we're looking at it."</p>
<p>Andrea West, national marketing manager for American
Telephone & Telegraph's MultiQuest audiotex transmission
services, sees the telephone-services market maturing: "In
the past six months, we've seen a shift in the market from
sheer entertainment programs to things like hot lines for
software customers, magazine subscriptions and travel lines
from companies such as Avis and the airlines."</p>
<p>Companies are using 900 and 800 numbers to promote new
products and conduct surveys. Teleline Inc., a voice
information services company, is working with Japan's Isuzu
to set up a line that would promote its cars and trucks --
and be entertaining enough that consumers would be willing to
pay for the call. Callers would dial chronic fibber "Joe
Isuzu" for the lie of the day. "Let's say the advertiser gets
45 cents per call," says Robert A. Lorsch, Teleline's
president. "If 15,000 calls come in a day, that's $6,750 a
day, or $209,250" after a month. At that rate, which Mr.
Lorsch says is about the number of calls he would expect the
line to generate, income from the calls would pay for
promotion of the phone line. In other words, the campaign
would pay for itself.</p>
<p>Audiotex also can be an extremely accurate
target-marketing tool. Callers' phone numbers,
computer-matched with addresses from directory data bases,
can be used to draw up a profile of customers and their
buying habits, or as a mailing list of consumers who have
already shown an interest in a company or its products.</p>
<p>In the proposed Isuzu campaign, for instance, dealers
might get the name and phone number of the caller and reply
with a thank you and an offer to test drive an Isuzu. "You
can target the customer so directly," Mr. Lorsch says.</p>
<p>Marketers also see big potential for 900 numbers in
billing. A customer would order something -- a magazine
subscription, for instance -- and the bill would appear on
his monthly telephone bill. The stumbling block is liability.
Phone companies are wary of being held responsible if a
service or good is delivered late or damaged.</p>
<p>Things weren't supposed to turn out quite this way. The
computer industry had high hopes customers would use PCs and
modems hooked up to phone lines to bank from home, order
airline tickets and play games. But "many videotex services
require you to become a junior computer weenie," says
Mitchell Kapor, chairman of On Technology Inc. and founder of
software giant Lotus Development Corp. "The phone is
brainlessly simple to operate."</p>
<p>Companies such as Citibank and Northern Telecom Inc. have
phones with screens attached to them that combine the simple
touch-tone pad with a small computer screen to facilitate
order entry and other interactive communications services.
AT&T is said to be working on a similar audiotex phone.</p>
<p>Some computer industry experts think audiotex could
actually help develop the videotex market by introducing
customers to electronic information services. But aside from
the simplicity of using the phone, videotex lacks a network
comparable to the nation's phone system. Mr. Kapor adds that
the computer industry is hobbled by networking problems that
prevent users on one videotex system from communicating with
PCs on other systems.</p>
<p>Also retarding videotex are start-up costs. A new phone
information service can get started for as little as $50,000,
including writing and recording the program, hiring the
talent and advertising, says Mr. Lorsch.</p>
<p>A recent study of audiotex users by Saatchi & Saatchi
Advertising, New York, shows they differ from nonusers not by
age or background but by "their ego structures," says Doreen
Doell, vice president and associate research director at
Saatchi. Users have "a fear of the unknown related to wanting
and needing to know what the future holds. For these people
the anxiety becomes overwhelming." The challenge, she said,
is for advertisers and their clients to create this
overwhelming desire among nonusers, who consider the lines
frivolous and associate them with porn lines and chat
services.</p>
<p>The audiotex industry has already formed its own National
Association For Information Services to police itself against
marketing abuses before regulators step in. Phone companies,
excluding long-distance carriers, by law can't own the
information they transport over their networks and they must
give any information provider access to their public
networks. But some, including AT&T, put many of the adult
lines out of business when they stopped providing billing
services to the lines.</p>
<p>Don't bury the adult lines yet, however. After AT&T's
move, the more resourceful providers simply switched their
numbers to toll-free 800 lines and let Visa and MasterCard do
their billing.</p>
