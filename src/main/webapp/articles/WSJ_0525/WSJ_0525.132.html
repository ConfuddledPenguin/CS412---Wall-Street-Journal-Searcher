	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The final episode of "Twin Peaks," a
television drama, left a passel of unsolved mysteries but
lured 22% of the audience -- the highest share since its
debut six weeks ago.
   "Twin Peaks" was the top-rated program in the 10-to-11
p.m. time period. It was seen by 12.6% of all U.S. homes and
by 22% of all TV sets in use at that hour, according to A.C.
Nielsen Co. ratings.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The final episode fared well among viewers under 50 years
old, whom advertisers want to reach. It drew 34% of women
ages 18 to 34, who were watching television Wednesday night;
26% of women ages 35 to 49; and 28% and 22% of men in those
respective age groups. The series has ranked 49th in terms of
how many homes tune in -- but it ranks No. 28 among women
ages 18 to 49.</p>
<p>"Twin Peaks" joins the ABC lineup as a full series next
fall. Fans will have to wait until then to resolve myriad
mysteries the series raised.</p>
<p>"Twin Peaks" earned the highest ratings of any ABC show in
its time slot in five years, said Alan Wurtzel, senior vice
president at the Capital Cities/ABC Inc. network.</p>
