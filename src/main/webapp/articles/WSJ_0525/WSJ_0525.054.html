	<p class="article-leader">SIMSBURY, Conn. -- Kollmorgen Corp. plans to close its
multiwire division in Hicksville, N.Y., in 60 days, if the
company fails to sell it.
   The closing of the division would complete Kollmorgen's
planned disposition of its electronic interconnections
business. James A. Eder, Kollmorgen secretary, said the
closing, together with other sales in the business segment,
wouldn't significantly affect earnings.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The multiwire plant, which has 142 employees, manufactures
proprietary interconnection products. Kollmorgen will retain
its operations in motors and controls and electro-optical
instruments.</p>
<p>John Youngblood, Kollmorgen chairman, president and chief
executive, said the company would continue to try to find a
buyer for the division, but he said the company believed that
is unlikely.</p>
<p>Mr. Eder said the entire electronic interconnections
business was classified as a discontinued operation last
September, when the company announced a restructuring that
called for disposing of the entire segment. That segment once
acccounted for one-third of Kollmorgen's operations. Mr. Eder
said provisions against earnings for a possible closing of
the multiwire division had previously been made.</p>
<p>Kollmorgen has been trying to fend off a takeover attempt
by Vernitron Corp., a closely held motors and controls
company based in Deer Park, N.Y. The two companies are suing
each other over a collapsed merger agreement, and Vernitron
is mounting a proxy contest for control of Kollmorgen's
board. Vernitron has said it would offer $15 a share for 50%
of Kollmorgen's shares, if it is successful in its proxy
solicitation.</p>
