	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- National Intergroup Inc. said it began its
previously announced tender offer for all the cumulative
convertible preference units outstanding of Permian Partners
Limited Partnership for $3.75 a unit.
   The price is subject to a reduction, reflecting any
distributions made after May 18, 1990, and prior to the
completion of the offer. The steel, retail and wholesale
drugdistribution concern said the offer is conditioned upon,
among other things, the tender of at least a majority of the
units. The offer expires June 21, at 12:01 a.m. EDT.</p>
