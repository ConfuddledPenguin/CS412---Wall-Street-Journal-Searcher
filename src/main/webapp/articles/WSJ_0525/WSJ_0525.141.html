	<p class="article-leader">Apple Computer Inc., Cupertino, Calif., said it agreed to
pay $5.7 million to settle two shareholder lawsuits arising
out of a plunge in its stock last year.
   The class-action suits were filed on behalf of purchasers
of Apple stock between Jan. 17 and Jan. 27, 1989. During that
time, Apple sharply reduced its earnings outlook for the
fiscal-second quarter, ended March 31; the revision sent the
stock reeling. The suits alleged violations of state and
federal securities disclosure laws.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Apple said a portion of the settlement, which is still
subject to approval of the federal court for the Northern
District of California where the suits were filed, will be
paid by an insurance company. The company said it continues
to deny any wrongdoing, and agreed to the settlement to avoid
the expense of further litigation.</p>
