	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission
charged four former officials of Thortec International Inc.
with overstating the company's revenue and earnings in 1986
and 1987.
   Without admitting or denying the charges, each of the
officials consented to a permanent injunction barring them
from future violations of securities laws.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Thortec, which has since changed its name to URS Corp., is
a San Francisco-based architectural and engineering firm. The
four individuals are Richard Towle, former chief financial
officer; Arthur Whipple, former chief accounting officer;
Arthur Stromberg, former chairman and chief executive
officer; and Franklin Agardy, former chief operating officer.</p>
<p>The SEC alleged that the individuals manipulated the
company's accounting records to record an extra $8.4 million
of revenue and earnings for the fiscal year ended Oct. 31,
1986, when the company reported revenue of $115.7 million and
net income of $8.7 million.</p>
<p>The commission also alleged that results for the first two
quarters of fiscal 1987 were inflated by $5 million.</p>
<p>"The individuals settled to put the matter behind them and
avoid protracted litigation," said Theodore Levine, a
Washington, D.C., attorney for Messrs. Stromberg, Agardy and
Whipple. "These were viewed as technical accounting issues,
and they wanted to resolve the matter. . . ."</p>
<p>In Palo Alto, Calif., an attorney for Mr. Towle declined
comment.</p>
<p>In San Francisco, a spokesman for URS Corp. noted that the
company isn't named in the complaint, and that the four
individuals who were are no longer with the company. He said
class-action suits against the company arising out of
charges, including some that concerned the SEC, were settled
last year "and are now behind us."</p>
<p>He said "the company, over a year ago, voluntarily
restated certain of its financial statements, relating to all
of the matters covered by the SEC complaint." He added, "We
have a new management team, new auditors and very strong
financial controls in place now to ensure that a repetition
does not occur."</p>
