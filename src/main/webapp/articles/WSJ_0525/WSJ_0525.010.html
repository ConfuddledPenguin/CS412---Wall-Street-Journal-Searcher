	<p class="article-leader">I thought John C. Goodman's April 11 editorial-page
commentary, "How Much Will an Operation Cost? Fat Chance of
Finding Out," raised some good points but missed the heart of
the issue.
   Most people are insulated from the price of health-care
services at the point of use. They do, however, routinely
make comparative cost choices when making decisions about
enrollment in one insurance program or another.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Most patients are covered by insurance programs that have
agreements with hospitals at preset prices for a group of
services (i.e. Medicare will pay only a fixed price per
admission and many insurances pay a negotiated payment for
all services provided each day a patient is in the hospital).
In all cases a hospital is legally or contractually prevented
from billing the patient for the difference between the
actual charges and the preset payment.</p>
<p>Quoting prices to patients will have little impact on the
cost or competitiveness of health-care services. More
informed consumers and payers may, however, realize that we
(as buyers and users) can make choices about what and how we
will pay for health care.</p>

<p>---</p>
<p>Mr. Goodman's proposal that hospitals that treat Medicare
patients "should be required to quote pre-admission prices to
all patients" is an excellent way to help deal with runaway
medical-care costs. This simple reform could initiate much
needed price competition in a major segment of the
health-care delivery system.</p>
<p>Hospital price information is flatly unavailable to
patients and largely unavailable to many third-party payers.
Hospitals rarely unbundle their fees for services or
supplies, thus optimizing their charges per admission but
making price-shopping by consumers impossible.</p>
<p>A large number of hospitals do this through their
contracts with health-maintenance organizations, preferred
provider organizations and insurance companies. A more
consumer-friendly pricing system would have the major
advantage of helping the insured and uninsured alike.</p>
<p>Critics will argue that price competition will affect the
quality of care. Not true. Patients' physicians will always
participate in the selection of the hospital. They can help
patients differentiate between good-quality, cost-efficient
hospitals and poor-quality, low-cost hospitals.
Unfortunately, many physicians have as much difficulty
differentiating between hospitals on the basis of price under
the current hospital pricing system as do their patients.</p>
<p>Others will argue that physician "hospital privileges"
determine the selection of a hospital, not the patient. That
is true to a degree. However, many physicians ought to be
sensitive to their patients' financial constraints and should
willingly help them achieve a healthy outcome in an
economical way.</p>

<p>---</p>
<p>What Mr. Goodman is really proposing is for hospital
business-office managers and financial departments to begin
practicing medicine and telephone diagnoses on the general
public. I've seen unusual propositions to reduce the costs of
health care, but this really is absurd.</p>
<p>Hospitals literally each perform thousands of different
individual tests, procedures and services in millions of
possible combinations. Each and every patient may or may not
need more or less care and services, and there is no way to
incorporate accurately all the possible variances for every
possible procedure and combination of services for every
patient.</p>
<p>Mr. Goodman's own examples of total charges for outpatient
services in Chicago are good examples of the range that
exists because of the scope of services required for
individual treatment and not because he is comparing
procedure costs on an "apples-to-apples" basis.</p>
