	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Japan's long-term prime rate is likely to drop
0.3 percentage point to 7.6%, according to an official at one
of the long-term credit banks.
   The decision by the three long-term credit banks, which
reset their benchmark lending rate at the end of each month,
is expected Friday afternoon, the official said. The rate is
set 90 basis points above the coupon rate of the new monthly
issues of five-year debentures of the banks. The three
institutions are Industrial Bank of Japan, Long-Term Credit
Bank of Japan and Nippon Credit Bank.</p>
