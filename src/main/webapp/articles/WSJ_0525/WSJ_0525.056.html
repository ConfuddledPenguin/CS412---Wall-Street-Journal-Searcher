	<p class="article-leader">OCALA, Fla. -- Mid-State Federal Savings Bank said its
shareholders approved the proposed acquisition of Mid-State
Federal by First Florida Banks Inc.
   The agreement calls for First Florida to pay $54.2
million, or $25.07 a share, plus as much as $5.5 million, or
$2.34 a share, in proceeds from asset sales.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mid-State Federal said holders of 75.9% of its shares
outstanding approved the proposed combination.</p>
<p>Officials at Mid-State Federal said they hope that the
acquisition can be completed by Sept. 30, but they added that
delays in receiving necessary regulatory approvals could push
back that date.</p>
<p>First Florida, a bank-holding company, is based in Tampa.</p>
