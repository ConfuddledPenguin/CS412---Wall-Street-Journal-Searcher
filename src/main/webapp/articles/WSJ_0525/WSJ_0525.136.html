	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Gary Zahn, a former top-ranking broker at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., was indicted by a federal
grand jury in Brooklyn on 13 counts related to laundering
more than $400,000 for clients.
   Mr. Zahn had been known as a "million-dollar" broker at
Prudential-Bache, though it was unclear whether he had
generated more than $1 million of commissions over any given
year. He was a senior vice president of investments and a
member of the chairman's council, reflecting his status as
one of the firm's 90 top-grossing representatives.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A spokeswoman for Prudential-Bache, a unit of Prudential
Insurance Co. of America, said, "We terminated" Mr. Zahn "as
a result of this matter" in March. "We have cooperated with
and continue to cooperate with the U.S. attorney's office on
this matter."</p>
<p>The indictment charges that from February 1982 until about
March 1988, Mr. Zahn and others, who aren't named, helped
clients evade the federal law requiring that cash
transactions exceeding $10,000 be reported to the Internal
Revenue Service. Each count in the indictment, which was
issued in U.S. District Court, carries a maximum penalty of
five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.</p>
<p>Franklyn H. Snitow, attorney for Mr. Zahn at Snitow &
Pauley in Manhattan, declined to comment on whether his
client would fight the charges. The attorney did say,
however, that Mr. Zahn "faithfully and properly served both
Pru-Bache and his clients."</p>
<p>The law, which is designed to help the government in
criminal, tax, and regulatory inquiries, requires disclosure
of the identity of the person who conducted the transaction
or the organization or person for whom the transaction was
completed.</p>
<p>Mr. Zahn is charged with having received cash from clients
and then processing the funds in bank checks of less than
$10,000. Prudential-Bache then didn't file the required
reports on the transactions, the indictment alleges.</p>
<p>In October 1987, PaineWebber Group Inc.'s top stockbroker,
Gary Eder, was sentenced to six months in prison and given a
$510,000 fine in a money-laundering case. Mr. Eder admitted
helping various customers of the firm hide at least $700,000
from the IRS by avoiding the filing of required
currency-transaction reports.</p>
