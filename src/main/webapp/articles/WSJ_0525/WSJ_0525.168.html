	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- After months of negotiations, Imagine Films
Entertainment Inc. said Robert A. Harris, who had been
president of motion pictures and television since 1988, left
the company to become an independent producer.
   Mr. Harris said he decided to leave the entertainment
company because he wasn't spending as much time as he'd like
on Imagine's motion picture activities and instead was
concentrating on TV. Mr. Harris formerly was president of MCA
Inc.'s TV group, but he wants to make movies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>No less than two of Imagine's annual shareholder meetings
were postponed as a result of the debate over Mr. Harris's
complex termination agreement with the company. Mr. Harris,
who was less than two years into a five-year contract, owns a
stake in Imagine, and his compensation was tied to the
company's profits under various complicated formulas. He was
also a director (he has relinquished his board seat), which
the company said accounted for the meeting postponements. In
April, the meeting was called off at the last minute, sending
Imagine shares soaring on apparent speculation that the
company was on the brink of being acquired.</p>
<p>Mr. Harris will produce his first two motion pictures for
Imagine, whose co-chief executive officers are Brian Grazer
and actor/director Ron Howard. Imagine recently placed a TV
series, "Parenthood," on NBC's fall lineup. Imagine produced
the film of the same name for MCA's Universal Pictures. MCA
owns a 25% stake in Imagine, assuming conversion of warrants
and bonds, and has an agreement to distribute most of
Imagine's movies. But Carolco Pictures Inc. will distribute
the coming movie, "The Doors," to be directed by Oliver
Stone.</p>
