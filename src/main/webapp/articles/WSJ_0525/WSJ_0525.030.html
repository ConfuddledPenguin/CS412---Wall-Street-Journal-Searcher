	<p class="article-leader">ROME -- Italy's balance of payments surplus rose
marginally to 2.232 trillion lire ($1.81 billion) in April
from the 2.202 trillion lira surplus recorded a year earlier,
the Bank of Italy said.
   The April surplus was sharply lower, however, than the
4.190 trillion lira surplus reported in March.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The central bank also reported that the balance of
payments showed a surplus of 8.184 trillion lire in the first
four months of 1990, compared with a surplus of 9.188
trillion lire in the year-earlier period.</p>
<p>The central bank said the balance of payments surplus was
the result of a net capital outflow through the banking
system of 1.148 trillion lire as well as inflows totaling
6.899 trillion lire in the form of international investments
and loans.</p>
<p>All figures are provisional and aren't seasonally
adjusted.</p>
