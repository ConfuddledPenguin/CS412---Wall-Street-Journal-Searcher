	<p class="article-leader">BRUSSELS -- Lufthansa says it doesn't plan to gobble up
Interflug completely. But the big West German airline won't
be a passive investor in its East German counterpart.
   If Lufthansa's bid for 26% of East German airline
Interflug is approved by regulators, the West German carrier
will treat Interflug as a "subsidiary profit center,"
Lufthansa's chairman said. But he added that "we want
Interflug to remain a separate company."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In an interview here, Heinz Ruhnau also said that the
letter of intent Lufthansa signed in March gives it the right
of first refusal if additional shares of Interflug are
offered to the public. And it's expected that another 23% of
the shares will be put on the market, he said, leaving East
Germany with a 51% stake in Interflug.</p>
<p>"If there is more to buy, I would have a right to buy
more" shares, he said, adding that the letter of intent
doesn't spell out how much more Lufthansa could purchase. But
Mr. Ruhnau didn't say whether Lufthansa would boost its stake
above 26%.</p>
<p>Any link with the East German carrier can only increase
Lufthansa's might in a unified Germany. The large airline,
which has 55,000 employees and carried 20.4 million
passengers last year, already dominates not only its home
market but also is a major player in Europe. Interflug, with
its aged, mostly Soviet-built fleet, its 7,000 employees and
1.7 million passengers a year, hardly will be in a position
to resist the wishes of its new benefactor.</p>
<p>As a result of this and other factors, Lufthansa's plans
for Interflug now are being being examined by the West German
Cartel Office, the European Community Commission and the
newly formed Office for Competition in East Berlin.</p>
<p>An official of the West German competition agency said
this week that he couldn't predict when those investigations
will be completed. But he said East Germany already has
agreed that Interflug shares won't include access to East
German airports or to landing slots. Separating these rights
from airline ownership probably will mute regulators'
concerns that Lufthansa's market position would be unduly
strengthened by the acquisition, the official said.</p>
<p>Mr. Ruhnau said there is much work ahead before Interflug
can sell its shares. The airline currently is being valued by
Western auditors so that a price can be set for the assets.
Interflug probably will need to be restructured as well.
Currently, the airline also runs five East German airports,
does aerial photography and air ambulance work and its
agricultural division sprays crops with a fleet of small
aircraft.</p>
