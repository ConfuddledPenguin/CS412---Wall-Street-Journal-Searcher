	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The House Agriculture Committee, bowing to
budget pressure, discarded a proposal to give grain farmers
an additional $6.5 billion in subsidies over the next five
years.
   The lawmakers, led by Committee Chairman Kika de la Garza
(D., Texas), continued to hold the line on farm spending,
voting unanimously to freeze so-called target prices for
wheat and feed grains at current levels from fiscal 1991
through 1995. The committee signaled a new era of frugalness
last week as it voted to freeze target prices for cotton and
rice and tentatively agreed to freeze grain target prices.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The committee also voted to establish a marketing-loan
program for soybeans, sunflowers and other oilseed crops, but
with the proviso that it would operate at no cost to the
government.</p>
<p>Many farm-state lawmakers had wanted to tie target prices
for commodities to farm production costs, but that would have
added $6.5 billion above the baseline spending level.
Instead, the committee adopted a plan that would freeze
target prices for wheat at $4 a bushel, corn at $2.75, barley
at $2.36 and oats at $1.45.</p>
<p>However, in years when the U.S. is expected to import more
oats than it exports, the agriculture secretary would be
authorized to allow farmers to harvest oats on land that
otherwise would be taken out of production to prevent
surpluses of other commodities. Lawmakers hope this provision
will provide an incentive to reverse the prolonged decline in
oat production.</p>
<p>Under the farm program, the government dispenses
deficiency payments if market prices fall short of target
prices.</p>
<p>After lengthy debate, the committee also adopted a plan to
give farmers a free hand to plant a variety of crops,
including experimental crops with industrial uses, on 25% of
the land they customarily devote to cotton, rice, wheat, feed
grains and oilseeds.</p>
<p>But to mollify soybean processors and the American Soybean
Association, the lawmakers decided against allowing farmers
to plant such subsidized crops as cotton and corn on oilseed
acreage. The processors and the trade group fears a drop in
soybean production.</p>
<p>But farmers who take advantage of this planting
flexibility provision wouldn't be eligible for subsidy
payments on that land.</p>
<p>Last week, the lawmakers tentatively agreed to a 20%
flexibility provision.</p>
<p>Committee staffers said freezing target prices would have
negligible impact on food prices.</p>
