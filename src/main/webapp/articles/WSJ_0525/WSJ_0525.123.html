	<p class="article-leader">Ivan F. Boesky conceded under cross-examination that the
$100 million in penalties and disgorgement of profits that he
paid the government still left him with money, and that he
was able to deduct half the money he paid the government on
his 1986 tax returns.
   Mr. Boesky, who was was cross-examined for a second day by
defense lawyer Thomas Puccio in the trial of John A. Mulheren
Jr., admitted that he was forced to give up only a portion of
the profits he derived illegally as a result of the November
1986 plea-bargain agreement in his insider-trading case. He
said, however, that he couldn't recall how much money he had
left after paying the penalties.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>He also said he couldn't remember what illegal trades he
made before his plea, how much money he was worth at the
time, or whether he transferred personal assets to his wife
and children.</p>
<p>He couldn't recall many details of his life as a famous
Wall Street stock speculator, or his illegal dealings with
former investment bankers Dennis Levine and Martin Siegel,
both of whom have pleaded to insider-trading-related
felonies.</p>
<p>But Mr. Boesky said he remembered "very well" a March 1986
trade he did with Mr. Mulheren that he said was "designed to
help repay an obligation Mr. Mulheren's firm had to our
firm," money owed as a result of illegal trades. Mr. Boesky
also said he recalled receiving inside information from
former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. junk-bond wizard Michael
Milken. Mr. Milken recently pleaded guilty to six felony
counts in connection with fraudulent securities trades done
with Mr. Boesky and others.</p>
<p>Mr. Mulheren, the former chief of Jamie Securities Co., a
defunct securities firm, is charged with 41 counts of
conspiracy, and securities and mail fraud. Mr. Boesky's
cooperation led to the government's sweeping insider-trading
inquiry and to the indictment of Mr. Mulheren.</p>
<p>Mr. Boesky completed his testimony against Mr. Mulheren
yesterday without seeming to have helped the government's
case much. Mr. Boesky is unlikely to ever take the witness
stand again in a criminal case, since virtually all of the
individuals he has implicated have pleaded guilty to crimes.
Mr. Mulheren is the only individual he has implicated who has
chosen to fight the charges against him at trial.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Boesky faces civil suits from individuals who
claim they have been damaged by his actions. Mr. Boesky
estimated the damages claimed by those plaintiffs at $1
billion. Those suits are pending.</p>
<p>Mr. Boesky repeatedly told Mr. Puccio that he couldn't
recall how much he earned in illicit profits without seeing
government documents. Mr. Boesky also said he couldn't
remember whether he had transferred money and other assets to
his family and others in 1986, prior to his guilty plea.</p>
<p>"Do you recall what your net worth was in 1986?" Mr.
Puccio asked. "I'd have to be refreshed," Mr. Boesky
answered. But Mr. Boesky said he "presumed" his lawyers were
correct when they told the court that he was almost bankrupt
in December 1987, when he was sentenced to three years in
prison.</p>
<p>Mr. Boesky served 19 months of his prison term in a
federal prison in Lompoc, Calif. "Did you break any laws
while you were at Lompoc?" Mr. Puccio asked. "Yes," Mr.
Boesky answered. "There were a couple of chaps who did
laundry there and I gave them a few quarters to do my
laundry" in violation of prison rules.</p>
<p>"Isn't it a fact that you paid bribes" to prison officials
and received "special consideration" as a result, Mr. Puccio
asked. "That's an outrageous and malicious accusation, sir,"
Mr. Boesky answered angrily.</p>
<p>Mr. Boesky also denied a suggestion by Mr. Puccio that Mr.
Boesky received inside information from Stephen Fraidin, then
a close friend of Mr. Boesky's who is a partner at the New
York law firm of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson.
"Did you ever receive insider information from Mr. Fraidin or
his law firm?" Mr. Puccio asked. "Unequivocally no," Mr.
Boesky responded.</p>
<p>In a telephone interview yesterday, Mr. Fraidin said, "Any
suggestion that I provided Mr. Boesky with inside information
is outrageous, without basis and totally incorrect."</p>
