	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Telerate Inc. said it laid off 41 employees in
its Americas and corporate groups as part of cost-cutting
moves.
   Telerate is the financial information-service subsidiary
of Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a letter to employees, Carl M. Valenti, Telerate's
president, said sales staffs were "only minimally affected"
by the cutback. Telerate has about 2,500 employees. Mr.
Valenti said he doesn't anticipate any further layoffs in the
Americas group, which includes U.S., Canadian and Latin
American operations, or elsewhere in the immediate future.</p>
<p>Mr. Valenti said Telerate's Europe-Gulf region and
Asia-Pacific region "continue to show strong progress" and
are reporting double-digit sales growth. However, the
Americas group "is having a much tougher time this year" due
to contraction in Wall Street firms and continued problems in
the U.S. thrift industry.</p>
<p>He said the Americas group revenue has declined and
Telerate earnings "are down significantly so far this year,
due mostly to major increases in expenses."</p>
