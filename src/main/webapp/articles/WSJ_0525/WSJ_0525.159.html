	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The House approved a $4 billion fiscal-1990
spending bill that would cut more than $2 billion from
military accounts to help finance increased domestic
appropriations and President Bush's long-sought aid package
for Panama and Nicaragua.
   Provisions to expedite distribution of the $720 million
for the fledgling Central American governments were upheld
277-126, and the underlying measure was adopted by a 308-108
margin despite conservative objections to a litany of
parochial projects added by influential lawmakers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The bill was sent to the Senate, which struggled last
night to overcome the final snarls delaying passage. But a
fragile marriage of convenience appeared to survive between
the Bush administration and the Democratic leadership eager
to complete action before the Memorial Day recess.</p>
<p>With the Pentagon's backing, the House easily stripped out
$238 million for a costly ammunition plant in Louisiana, but
among domestic projects, the White House appeared to turn a
deaf ear to repeated GOP assaults on Congress's
appropriators. "We want the supplemental to go through," an
administration official last night, "and we want it to go
through today."</p>
<p>The result was a lopsided series of votes upholding a
laundry list of provisions ranging from a $6 million Iowa
wildlife refuge to a directive that the Department of Housing
and Urban Development fund an assortment of previously
appropriated community projects costing over $28 million.</p>
<p>The most closely fought battle came on the internal
question of how the House would finance lawmakers' own
election-year mail. The bill had proposed to permit the
transfer of as much as $25 million in unobligated
appropriations to meet an expected shortfall for the
free-mail, or "franking," privilege. But after sharp debate,
Republicans scored an upset over the Democratic leadership on
a 208-161 roll call that allowed them to strip the provision.</p>
<p>About one-quarter of the Central American aid is to pay
off back debts to international financial institutions. In
Nicaragua -- the more desperate of the two countries -- a
focus is retooling private enterprises. Of the $300 million
slated for the new Chamorro regime, $128 million is to
finance imports including oil and agriculture-related
products, while medical and education funds total less than
$30 million.</p>
<p>Among domestic accounts, more than $1.7 billion is
provided to meet increased costs for food stamps and veterans
programs. Southern and Western states hit by recent flooding
would share in an estimated $216 million in new disaster
assistance. Child-education and vaccine programs would
receive increases, along with the Census, and as the bill has
grown steadily, so have the consequent cuts from the
Pentagon.</p>
<p>Final bargaining failed to resolve the question of how to
pay for another $1.45 billion shortfall in the military's own
personnel and hospital costs. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
balked at proposed adjustments taking $230 million from major
weapons programs such as the B-2 bomber and the Strategic
Defense Initiative.</p>
<p>The list of new transfers had been proposed by House Armed
Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D., Wis.), but the
Pentagon apparently was reluctant to make any further
concessions on strategic programs before next week's summit
talks with the Soviets. A new deadline for resolving the
personnel problem was set for mid-June, but as the date is
pushed backward, the potential disruptions only grow, making
the Senate Armed Services Committee reluctant to release the
overall appropriations bill without first addressing the
problem.</p>
<p>In the atmosphere of cutbacks, the Pentagon portion of the
supplemental-spending bill for the fiscal 1990, which ends
Sept. 30, became a battleground for lawmakers. The fight over
the Louisiana ammunition plant pitted Sen. Bennett Johnston
(D., La.) against the ranking Republican on the House Rules
Committee, Rep. James Quillen, whose Tennessee district is
the home of a competing facility.</p>
<p>Report language inserted in House-Senate negotiations
lifts prior restrictions on the expenditure of $20 million by
the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency for
high-definition television. Magnascreen Corp. of Pittsburgh,
and Planar Systems Inc. of Beaverton, Ore., currently hold
contracts with the agency, and two senior appropriators from
those states, Rep. John Murtha (D., Pa.) and Sen. Mark
Hatfield (R., Ore.), were described as influential in winning
release of the funds.</p>
<p>For policy reasons -- and the support of Senate
Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.) --
a written report accompanying the final bill seeks to block
the Army from terminating work on 105mm tank ammunition being
developed by Hercules Inc.</p>
