	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The dollar came full circle from its recent
rally against the yen by finishing just above 151 yen
yesterday on a renewed market appreciation of Japan's robust
economy.
   The mark weakened against the dollar, though, its strength
sapped by continued market nervousness about the costs of
German unification.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 1.6830 marks, up from 1.6765 marks late Wednesday, and at
151.05 yen, down from 151.45 yen late Wednesday. Sterling was
quoted at $1.6895, down from $1.6940 late Wednesday.</p>
<p>At midmorning Friday in Tokyo, the dollar was trading at
150.75 yen, down from Thursday's Tokyo close of 151.43 yen.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.6825
marks.</p>
<p>The apparent recovery of Japanese stocks from their plunge
early this year has removed a temporary factor that had
turned participants' focus away from the underlying strength
of the Japanese economy, said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist
at Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>Release earlier in the day of a sharp downward revision of
U.S. first-quarter gross national product to an annual growth
rate of 1.3% didn't have much effect on trading.</p>
<p>Traders said the fall from the originally announced 2.1%
annual rate was due to an unusually large fall in business
inventories that in itself doesn't change the outlook for
continued modest growth in the U.S. economy. Expectations
were for a downward revision to 1.8% annual growth.</p>
<p>The recent rally by the dollar against the yen, which
began May 16, was fueled mainly by a belief that inflationary
pressures were rising in Japan at a time when monetary
authorities are reluctant to raise interest rates for fear of
once again plunging the stock market into disarray,
participants said. The dollar last ended New York trading
below 151 yen on May 15, when it closed at 150.83 yen.</p>
<p>But sustained trading of the Nikkei stock index at levels
around 32,000 points in the past week, along with the
prospect of an easing of inflationary pressures due to
stabilizing prices, have lent support to the Bank of Japan's
policy of steady rates, Mr. Sohn said. The Nikkei average
rose 135.24 points Thursday to close at 32,311.75.</p>
<p>The unexpectedly sharp downward revision in U.S.
first-quarter GNP was accompanied by an unchanged estimation
of the implicit price deflator at a 5.7% annual rate.</p>
<p>The GNP growth rate announcement was neutral for the
dollar when taken with the inflation figure because figures
showing a sluggish economy and continuing inflationary
pressure had been expected, participants said. Taken
together, the numbers mean the Federal Reserve still doesn't
have any reason to change its policy of maintaining steady
interest rates, they said.</p>
<p>The fall in inventories, which swung to a revised decline
of $5.9 billion in the quarter from an originally announced
gain of $2.6 billion, was discounted partly because of
inventories' volatility and partly due to their natural
tendency to rebound from a fall to a gain the next quarter,
participants said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the mark weakened against the dollar and other
currencies on continued nervousness about how much
unification will end up costing West Germany, said Peter
Iversen, a trader at Shawmut Bank of Boston N.A.</p>
<p>Late in the New York day, the Treasury said that a comment
made earlier by Assistant Treasury Secretary Sidney Jones
that the dollar is undervalued against all major currencies
except the yen wasn't meant to suggest a change in the
Treasury's views on the dollar.</p>
<p>Mr. Jones's remark ruffled the market briefly, spurring
selling of the mark against the yen, traders said.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $366.50 an ounce, up $2.40. Estimated
volume was a heavy five million ounces.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong Friday, gold was quoted at $368.45 an ounce.</p>
