	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Office of Thrift Supervision said a
federal judge denied a request by Imperial Savings
Association, San Diego, which sought an injunction barring
regulators from placing the thrift in receivership. Imperial
is already under government conservatorship.
   Imperial, a unit of Imperial Corp. of America, asked for
the injunction in the wake of a March ruling involving
another thrift. In the earlier ruling, a district court said
that the top savings-and-loan regulator hadn't been properly
approved by Congress and thus couldn't order that thrifts be
taken over by the government. Congress then moved quickly to
approve a new head of the Office of Thrift Supervision,
Timothy Ryan, in April and made that argument moot.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Office of Thrift Supervision said U.S. District Judge
Judith Keep in San Diego ruled that Imperial "hadn't shown
its arguments were likely to succeed, and that the potential
harm to Imperial was outweighed by the harm to the public
that could result."</p>
<p>Under conservatorship, the government takes management
control of the thrift. Under receivership, the government
wipes out the owners' interests in thrift and can sell the
assets. The OTS didn't say whether it plans to place Imperial
in receivership.</p>
