	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Senate rejected a provision that would
have enabled defendants to fight the death penalty by
presenting evidence that executions are imposed in a racially
discriminatory manner in the jurisdiction where they are
being sentenced.
   The defeat of the measure on a 58-38 vote removed a major
obstacle to passage of the omnibus anti-crime bill, which
includes provisions that would extend the death penalty to
six additional federal crimes and would bring 23 long-dormant
death statutes into conformity with Supreme Court procedural
requirements.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Bush administration officials have said the president
would veto legislation allowing a legal defense based on
evidence of racially disproportionate imposition of capital
punishment.</p>
<p>The bill's future still remains uncertain because it
contains other provisions vehemently opposed by conservative
senators and the president -- in particular, a three-year ban
on nine types of semi-automatic "assault weapons."</p>
<p>Mr. Bush urged lawmakers to approve "a good, strong
anti-crime bill" without the assault-weapon ban. The Senate
didn't complete action on the crime bill yesterday but set it
aside until early next month, when lawmakers return from
their Memorial Day recess. The House is far behind in
considering comparable legislation.</p>
<p>The Senate bill also includes a provision that would
reverse a 1989 Supreme Court decision and prohibit executions
of mentally retarded defendants in federal cases. By a 59-38
vote, senators rejected a Republican amendment that would
have allowed execution of mentally retarded persons if they
are shown "to understand the difference between right and
wrong." In addition, negotiators from both parties
compromised and said no one under the age of 17 could be
executed for a federal crime.</p>
<p>The Senate also reversed a decision it made Wednesday and
adopted more-stringent curbs on appeals by death-row inmates.
Senators voted 52-46 to reconsider a previously approved
Democratic version of the death-row appeals measure, and then
they approved a Republican alternative on a voice vote.</p>
<p>Both versions were designed to limit so-called habeas
corpus petitions, by which death row residents may challenge
the constitutionality of their convictions or sentences --
typically in multiple, piecemeal federal appeals. Among other
differences, the Republican version would establish a 60-day
time limit for filing the federal petitions, while Democrats
proposed a one-year time limit.</p>
<p>To the surprise of Bush administration lobbyists, the
Republican version was altered in private negotiations to
include language that would allow death-row inmates to file
appeals based on certain new constitutional rights announced
by the Supreme Court after their convictions. President Bush
strongly opposes such language, which appears to overturn
Supreme Court precedent restricting such appeals, and Chief
Justice William Rehnquist also has made vehement attacks on
it.</p>
<p>Proponents of the racial-disparity defense to execution,
which was sponsored by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.)
reacted angrily in defeat, citing numerous studies purporting
to show racism in application of capital punishment.</p>
<p>"In this country, if you're white and you kill a black
person, it's almost certain that prosecutors won't seek the
death penalty," said Richard Burr, a lawyer with the NAACP
Legal Defense Fund. "But if you're black, and you commit
precisely the same crime against a white person, you're far
more likely to be condemned to die." Conservatives had warned
that the Kennedy provision would eliminate capital punishment
on both the state and federal levels because it would place a
huge burden on prosecutors to disprove race was a factor in
death sentences.</p>
