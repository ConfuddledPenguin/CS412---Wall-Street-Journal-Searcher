	<p class="article-leader">MONROE, Conn. -- Taunton Technologies Inc. and VISX Inc.
said they signed a definitive agreement to merge.
   Under the planned merger, which has been approved by the
boards of both companies, one share of Taunton stock will be
issued for each 1.3597 shares of VISX outstanding, resulting
in VISX shareholders' owning about 32% of the combined
company. The planned merger is subject to shareholder
approval.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The companies said Charles R. Munnerlyn, chairman and
chief executive officer of VISX, which is based in Sunnyvale,
Calif., will become chairman and chief executive of the
combined companies. Alan R. McMillen, current president of
VISX, will become president. John W. Warner, current chief
executive of Taunton, will consult on the evaluation of
products, patents and technology for the combined companies.</p>
<p>Officials of both companies said that the merger would
result in the termination of patent litigation between the
companies. Taunton and VISX had been engaged in interference
proceedings over rights to patents for the use of lasers to
correct nearsightedness and other eye disorders.</p>
<p>Taunton said it expects VISX shareholders to receive about
2.5 million shares of the combined company valued at about
$27 million. Shares of Taunton closed yesterday on the
national over-the-counter market at $11 bid.</p>
