	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- Bank of Boston Corp. declared a quarterly
dividend of 31 cents, surprising some analysts who had been
anticipating a cut because of New England's embattled
economy.
   But the bank said that beginning with the next quarter,
its board would meet in the third month of the quarter,
instead of the second -- which has been its custom -- to
consider future dividends. The company explained that the
action would bring the "practice into line with other major
banks."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The move, however, was seen by some as a cautionary
action, given the area's uncertain economic climate. "By
pushing it to the third month, it will clearly give the board
a better handle on the quarter's earnings and economic
outlook," said Gerard Cassidy, bank analyst for Tucker,
Anthony & R.L. Day Inc.</p>
<p>Mr. Cassidy, along with a few others, had thought the bank
might cut its dividend to preserve capital. "If the economy
continues on a decline we feel their numbers will reflect
that weakness," he added.</p>
<p>For the first quarter, Bank of Boston reported net income
of $43.6 million, or 56 cents a share, less than half the
$89.1 million, or $1.23 a share, reported in the year-ago
period.</p>
<p>Separately, Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered its
rating on approximately $450 million of the bank's debt to
Ba-1 from Baa-3 and the long-term deposits of its bank
subsidiaries to Baa-2 from Baa-1. The banks' ratings for
short-term deposits were confirmed at P-2.</p>
<p>The rating actions reflect the continuing uncertainty
associated with the corporation's exposures to the New
England economy and the national real estate markets, Moody's
said.</p>
<p>"Clearly, we are disappointed with the action taken today
by Moody's," Peter J. Manning, the bank's chief financial
officer said. "We remain steadfast in our focus on credit
quality . . . we have the financial strength and are well
positioned to deal with uncertainties in the current
environment."</p>
