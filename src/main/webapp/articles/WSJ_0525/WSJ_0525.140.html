	<p class="article-leader">Par Pharmaceutical Inc. said its president was granted
proxies from four shareholders to vote about two million of
its shares in matters relating to board membership.
   The proxies, when combined with the shares owned by the
president, Kenneth I. Sawyer, give him beneficial ownership
of 17.8% of the Spring Valley, N.Y., generic drug company. In
a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Mr. Sawyer said
he was granted the proxies to "help assure" certain
governmental agencies involved in investigating and reviewing
the generic drug industry and the company that the
shareholders support new management installed in September.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The proxies give Mr. Sawyer the right to vote the about
two million shares in matters relating to election or removal
of directors and filling board vacancies.</p>
<p>Par has been the target of federal investigations for the
past two years. Earlier this year Par and its majority-owned
Quad Pharmaceuticals Inc. unit were fined a total of $400,000
for illegal gratuity payments made to an official of the Food
and Drug Administration. Par and Quad both have recalled
products amid concerns about adherence to regulatory
procedures.</p>
