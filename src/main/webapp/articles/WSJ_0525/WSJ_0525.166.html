	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- At General Motors' annual meeting here today,
executives probably will tell shareholders that things are
looking up at the No. 1 auto maker. And for once, Wall Street
will agree.
   GM stock "looks like a really terrific opportunity," says
money manager Mario J. Gabelli in New York.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>What is so terrific about an auto stock at a time of
skidding car sales and a sluggish economy? The answer
probably won't be spoken out loud at the meeting, because it
involves two nasty words: plant closings.</p>
<p>Slowly and quietly, GM is moving to close enough plants to
be able to operate its North American factories at full
capacity, boosting its lagging domestic profits. The Street
applauds this Ultra Slim-Fast routine and its potential
long-term rewards, both for GM and for other auto makers.</p>
<p>"If I was pressed on what is the sleeper group for the
second half, I would say autos," says Byron R. Wien,
portfolio strategist for Morgan Stanley. "That is one group
that has been beaten down."</p>
<p>John Neff, head of the $8 billion Windsor Fund, calls auto
stocks "attractive, particularly for those who believe in the
soft-landing" scenario for the economy.</p>
<p>GM isn't just waiting for the economy to bail it out, and
that's what has analysts upbeat about the No. 1 auto maker.
In a series of announcements dribbled out since early 1988,
GM has "indefinitely idled" or laid plans to close four
car-assembly plants and three truck plants over the next
three years.</p>
<p>What's more, GM is converting three car plants to truck
production. With those conversions, GM is eliminating a total
of seven passenger-car plants -- just one less than Ford
Motor has in the U.S.</p>
<p>The idled plants aren't officially closed and written off
the books because that isn't allowed under the current labor
contract. But the shutdowns are real, nonetheless, and they
represent some 1.4 million vehicles that GM won't have to
sell to get its plants running at full speed.</p>
<p>Philip Fricke of Prudential-Bache Securities argued in a
recent report that GM needs just one more plant closing by
1993 to boost its factory operating rate to a healthy 90%
from the current 80% level. "I think they are virtually
there" in terms of solving the excess-capacity problem, says
Mr. Fricke. That's why his report reaffirms a buy
recommendation on GM, despite the industrywide slump in auto
sales this spring.</p>
<p>At Morgan Stanley, analyst Scott Merlis says GM's
capacity-cutting plans have led him to boost his earnings
estimates for the company. GM's annual earnings for the
1990-1995 period should average $8 a share, Mr. Merlis now
says, instead of the $7 a share he previously estimated. He,
too, says now is the time to buy GM.</p>
<p>What's more, GM's retreat could provide something of a
peace dividend for all the auto makers that compete in North
America, says analyst John Casesa of Wertheim Schroeder.</p>
<p>"GM has been the spoiler for pricing in the industry," he
says. The giant auto maker, through its frantic efforts to
move merchandise by offering big rebates and other discounts,
has forced domestic and foreign companies to discount their
wares, too, hurting profits. "If they {GM} fix their
capacity, it will help everybody out," Mr. Casesa says.</p>
<p>Indeed, by 1992, GM will have cut its North American
car-building capacity to about 4.3 million cars from more
than 6 million cars in 1986, according to figures compiled by
the WEFA Group, an economic-forecasting concern in Bala
Cynwyd, Pa. (Mr. Fricke puts his 1992-93 number at 4.4
million cars.) Last year, GM sold about four million North
American-built cars in the U.S., Canada and overseas.</p>
<p>If GM can sustain this pace, its factories can run at 90%
speed, spreading the company's fixed costs over a greater
number of vehicles and boosting profitability. That isn't
100%, but bullish analysts say GM could run close to full
speed in a strong sales year.</p>
<p>GM's stock has been swept up in the recent stock-market
rally. Yesterday, the shares closed at 48 3/8, off 5/8, after
Wednesday's reports of lower than expected mid-May car sales
for the Big 3 auto makers.</p>
<p>But the shares still are up 9% from the end of April.
Since Dec. 31, GM has outperformed both the Dow Jones
Industrial Average and the Standard & Poor's 500 index.</p>
<p>Are there skeptics left? Absolutely.</p>
<p>Shearson Lehman Hutton analyst Joseph Phillippi says he's
waiting for evidence of a "significant improvement in market
share that I could view as sustainable" before changing his
opinion that GM stock will lag the broader market.</p>
<p>The man in charge of GM's North American vehicle business,
president-elect Lloyd E. Reuss, says the company's car market
share could eventually rise back to 40% from the current
35.5% level. But GM's market-share projections have proved
too optimistic for years, and some analysts say GM isn't
through losing ground to Ford or the Japanese. If new
products slated for the early 1990s don't capture the
public's fancy better than those on which GM bet billions in
the 1980s, the company's North American comeback could stall
out.</p>
<p>Also, much of GM's remaining underused capacity is in
relatively new plants that are building unpopular products,
such as the GM-10 line of midsized cars. GM can ill afford to
abandon these facilities. So this fall, analysts expect, GM's
divisions will redouble efforts to sell the GM-10 models,
which are the Chevrolet Lumina sedan, Pontiac Grand Prix,
Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme and Buick Regal. New ads, fresh
exterior and interior designs and possibly lower prices could
all be part of the strategy. All will cost big money.</p>
<p>But even skeptics say GM is on the right track -- and is
finally moving to match production to market share rather
than the other way around.</p>
<p>GM chairman-elect Robert C. Stempel's goal is to have GM's
North American factories running as profitably as the
European operations he helped turn around in the mid-1980s.
Three of GM's European car plants now run on three-shift
production schedules that allow them to boost output by
nearly half. (U.S. plants generally run two shifts.)</p>
<p>Such aggressive moves helped GM to earn more than $1,100
average profit for every vehicle it sold in Europe last year.
By contrast, the company earned just $277 for each vehicle
sold in the U.S. and Canada. (Both figures include some
profit from GM's finance and technology units, but a much
larger share of GM's domestic profit comes from non-auto
operations.)</p>
<p>GM bulls caution that Europe-like profits won't emerge
from GM's North American operations overnight. But in the
meantime, there's always GM's $3 annual dividend rate, which
gives the stock a respectable 6.2% yield to tide over
investors who have the patience to wait a while.</p>
