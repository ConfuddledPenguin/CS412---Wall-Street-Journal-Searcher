	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a
civil suit against Bombay Palace Restaurants Inc.; Sant
Chatwal, the company's chairman; and Kewal Chopra, its former
vice president and chief financial officer.
   The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleged
securities-law violations in connection with Bombay's
takeover of Lifestyle Restaurants Inc. in 1987. The company
operates Bombay Palace and Beefsteak Charlie's restaurants.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At the same time as the suit was filed, the defendants
agreed to a permanent injunction barring them from future
violations of the securities law. The defendants neither
admitted nor denied the allegations in agreeing to the
injunction, which settles the suit. The SEC didn't seek any
penalty other than the injunction.</p>
<p>Bombay also agreed to engage independent auditors to
review its recordkeeping and agreed to adopt policies and
procedures to ensure that its recordkeeping complies with
securities law.</p>
<p>In September, Bombay filed for Chapter 11 status under the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Chapter 11 protects a company from
creditor lawsuits while it works out a plan to pay its debt.</p>
<p>On behalf of the defendants, Mr. Chopra, who remains an
employee of the company, said: "We have settled with the SEC
in an effort to put behind us events that occurred several
years ago. By settling with the SEC, we hope to be able to
devote full attention to the future of the Bombay Palace
companies and to strive for their successful emergence from
bankruptcy reorganization proceedings."</p>
<p>The SEC's lawsuit alleged that in acquiring Lifestyle, the
defendants falsely represented that they wouldn't use
Lifestyle to generate cash for Bombay, except in certain
specified circumstances. The SEC's suit said the defendants
failed to disclose that $2 million was taken from Lifestyle
and turned over to Bombay, and that they overstated Bombay's
financial results.</p>
<p>Bombay announced in April 1989 that the SEC was
investigating it. Jeffrey Zuckerman, an SEC associate
regional administrator in New York, said Bombay's
bankruptcy-law filing delayed the agency's civil action.</p>
