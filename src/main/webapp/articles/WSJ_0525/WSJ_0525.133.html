	<p class="article-leader">SEATTLE -- Boeing Co. said that airline inspections of its
737-model jetliners have turned up seven planes missing the
cotter pin that secures a bolt in the planes' steering
controls.
   The pins are being installed by Boeing field-service
personnel. "It's a quick adjustment that just takes a second
or two," a spokesman for the aircraft maker said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The inspections were conducted after a missing pin caused
a control wheel to come off in the hands of the co-pilot of a
West German airliner in flight last week. Boeing later
discovered a missing pin on a second 737 at its Renton,
Wash., production plant.</p>
<p>Apart from the plane being readied for delivery, the
defective planes are all owned by overseas airlines. Boeing
said the West German report is the only one it has received
of an in-flight incident. The pilot landed the plane safely
using the second set of controls.</p>
<p>The Federal Aviation Administration ordered U.S. airlines
to inspect pilot controls on three models of Boeing 737
jetliners after Boeing reported the cotter-pin problem last
week. Yesterday, an agency spokesman said that so far it
doesn't appear that any domestic carriers are affected. The
agency said it expected a final report "in a matter of
weeks."</p>
