	<p class="article-leader">Honda Motor Co. said its dealer incentive program is
broader than the company earlier indicated.
   Honda said it started a factory-to-dealer cash incentive
program May 13 that covers its Prelude car, the CRX model and
all Civic hatchbacks, except the base model hatchback. This
program is in addition to one that started April 13, which
covers Civic four-door sedans and station wagons. The first
program was disclosed in The Wall Street Journal yesterday.
Both programs run through June 30.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The newest incentive program gives dealers meeting sales
goals $500 for each Prelude, CRX or Civic hatchback they sell
through June 30. Dealers can use these cash incentives to
lower the price to buyers, so it's helpful for consumers to
be aware of the programs. Typically, auto makers don't
publicly announce dealer incentives; they do advertise
direct-to-consumer incentives.</p>
<p>From January through April, Honda had sold 10,874
Preludes, down 29% from the same period last year.</p>
