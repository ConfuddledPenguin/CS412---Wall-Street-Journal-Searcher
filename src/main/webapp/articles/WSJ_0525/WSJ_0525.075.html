	<p class="article-leader">BURBANK, Calif. -- Walt Disney Co. is tapping its
financial imagination to help pay for the multibillion-dollar
expansion of its U.S. theme parks and resorts over the next
decade.
   The entertainment concern filed yesterday for the proposed
offering of $1.5 billion of zero-coupon bonds due 2005. The
bonds are convertible into cash equal to the market price of
Euro Disneyland S.C.A., a publicly held French company
established to build and operate Euro Disneyland.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It's a unique twist," said William Gross, managing
director at Pacific Investment Management Co., a Newport
Beach, Calif., fixed-income manager.</p>
<p>Disney is the largest company to raise cash by selling
convertible zeros. The offering is the largest convertible
bond issue ever and the first time that a zero-coupon bond
purchased by U.S. investors is convertible into the cash
equivalent of the price of a foreign stock, said Lee Cole,
managing director at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, the
Merrill Lynch & Co. unit that is sole underwriter of the
issue.</p>
<p>"There isn't anything else like this," said Michael Carr,
a Manasquan, N.J., money manager who specializes in
convertible bonds. "It's an intriguing investment."
Obviously, investors won't buy it for the 6% return but for
the possible appreciation of the Euro Disneyland stock, Mr.
Carr said.</p>
<p>Other companies, such as Motorola Inc., MCI Communications
Corp. and Turner Broadcasting System Inc., have sold
convertible zeros, but those bonds were converted into the
U.S. shares of these concerns.</p>
<p>The investment will be a complicated one for U.S.
investors to analyze since its return will depend not only on
U.S interest rates and how well Euro Disneyland does, but
also on the relationship of the French franc to the dollar at
time of conversion. Investors won't actually get stock in
Euro Disneyland but U.S. dollars equivalent to the price of
Euro Disneyland stock in francs. "The calculations will make
the computer jockeys delirious with joy," says Mr. Carr.</p>
<p>The zero-coupon bonds, which are called Liquid Yield
Option Notes, will pay a yield of 6% to maturity. They will
be priced at a deep discount of about $412 per $1,000 bond,
and they will be convertible at any time at a premium of 15%
to the price of Euro Disneyland stock on the day the bonds
are issued.</p>
<p>Euro Disneyland is listed on stock exchanges in Paris,
London and Brussels. It closed yesterday at the equivalent of
$18.625 on the Paris exchange. Euro Disneyland, a theme park
and resort complex near Paris, is scheduled to open in 1992.
It is 49% owned by Walt Disney Co.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch has been the dominant underwriter for these
zero-coupon convertible securities since they were introduced
five years ago.</p>
<p>Richard Nanula, Disney's treasurer, said the proposed June
offering is expected to bring in about $600 million that will
be used for capital spending and to repay more expensive
commercial paper outstanding. "Normally, it would cost us
much more to issue debt, but since we are sharing a portion
of the Euro Disneyland stock appreciation with investors,
we're able to issue the debt at an attractive rate for us,"
he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Nanula said Disney doesn't plan to hedge its franc
holdings in case Euro Disneyland's stock soars and the franc
weakens, providing a big payout for investors who opt to
convert the bonds. The reason: "We own 83 million shares of
Euro Disneyland ourselves," he said.</p>
<p>Zeros have an added attraction over traditional
convertibles in that the issuer doesn't make periodic
interest payments to bondholders yet is allowed to deduct the
implied interest from taxes. But bondholders do have to pay
taxes on the implied interest they receive -- one of the
drawbacks in investing in zero-coupon bonds.</p>
<p>In January, Walt Disney announced a multibillion-dollar
expansion of its theme parks and resorts in Florida and
California over the next decade, including new
separate-admission parks in both states.</p>
