	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Prices of R.H. Macy & Co. bonds dropped as
much as 8% as the credit markets and the retailing industry
were swept by rising concerns about the giant retailer's
financial condition.
   Heller Financial Corp., a major lender to Macy suppliers,
said it will review its standards for financing shipments to
the chain. An executive at another major credit company, who
declined to be identified, said his firm has tightened its
standards on Macy shipments. Several bank lenders also voiced
concern about Macy, which has over $5 billion in debt
following its 1986 buy-out by management.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A Macy spokesman insisted the company's financial
condition is sound, and several key suppliers said they are
continuing to ship new merchandise. "We're watching
developments, and yes, everybody is nervous, but we are
shipping as usual," said Jerome Chazen, chairman of Liz
Claiborne Inc., Macy's largest supplier. "We've checked with
both our factoring companies, and they have given us a green
light."</p>
<p>Factoring companies like Heller play a critical role in
the retailing business by extending credit to suppliers.
Without approval from factors, most vendors won't ship new
goods. Should the factors lose confidence in Macy, it would
put the store in a serious situation. The recent
bankruptcy-law filings of L.J. Hooker Corp. and Campeau
Corp.'s retailing operations reflected in part a loss of
faith by factors.</p>
<p>The head of one major factoring company, who asked not to
be identified, said he hasn't seen any material change in
Macy's business to indicate Macy's prospects have changed in
the last few months. The head of a second major factoring
firm said that his firm is approving Macy shipments through
the end of May but will want to review all June and July
shipments before they are sent. "We have to be prudent," said
this executive, who asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>"The idea is to stay calm," said Jon Levy, president of
St. Gilliam Inc., a women's apparel vendor which does
business with Macy. "If the factors panic now, everybody will
panic."</p>
<p>Henry Kassebaum, a Heller executive vice president, said
Heller isn't cutting its credit lines to Macy suppliers but
will review those lines when they expire at the end of this
month. Mr. Kassebaum said Heller has approved all of Macy's
orders thus far. Separately, he told the Dow Jones News
Service that Heller has shifted from a "revolving credit"
policy toward Macy suppliers to an "order-by-order" policy.</p>
<p>The bankruptcy-law filings in the last year by Hooker,
Campeau's retailing operations and Ames Department Stores
Inc. have made investors skittish about the least sign of
difficulty at another retailer -- particularly one with a big
debt load and high-yield "junk" bonds. The Ames filing last
month, which caught some manufacturers by surprise, has left
the apparel industry especially jittery.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Macy's 14 1/2% senior subordinated debentures
due 1998 finished the day at 69 cents on the dollar, down 7%
from the day before. Its 14 1/2% subordinated debentures due
2001 were quoted at 59 cents on the dollar, down 5%. The
biggest percentage drop was shown by Macy's zero-coupon
bonds, which finished the day at 24 cents on the dollar, off
8%.</p>
<p>Macy executives declined to be interviewed, but a
spokesman said the company is meeting its financial
projections and has arranged to meet next week with eight to
10 factoring companies to update them on its financial
status.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Macy provided some factors with updated
forecasts reflecting results for the close of the third
quarter ended April 28. "That information was even more
favorable than had been forecast in February," said the
spokesman.</p>
<p>Although Macy hasn't yet reported its third-quarter
results, the company has indicated its losses were less than
the $64 million it reported during the same period in 1989.
For the second quarter, which included Christmas results,
Macy reported a $39 million loss.</p>
<p>Macy may face some friction with its bank lenders, who
provided $735 million of loans for the company's 1986
buy-out. When the banks lent the money, they set financial
targets for Macy, one of which the company recently has
failed to meet.</p>
<p>Macy in July will likely seek a further six-month waiver
of a condition that its cash flow -- net income plus interest
expense, taxes and depreciation -- exceed its annual interest
expense by 1.55:1. Bankers have already voted one such waiver
for Macy in March, allowing it to meet a less-stringent 1.2:1
ratio.</p>
<p>But some bankers don't appear in the mood to grant Macy
further waivers, unless they get concessions in return. One
major European lender said he would like to see Macy sell
assets, such as its credit-card company, so that it can pay
off its bank debt more quickly.</p>
<p>"We're concerned about the retail trade," said George
Morgan, a top lender at U.S. National Bank of Oregon, which
helped finance the buy-out. "If a credit isn't performing to
expectations, you're probably entitled to some compensation."</p>
<p>Macy's lead bank, Manufacturers Hanover Corp., has been
telling lenders that Macy has ample borrowing capacity to
cover its needs this year.</p>
<p>Arnold Cohen, president of Mahoney Cohen Paul & Co., the
apparel industry's largest accounting firm, said he is
suggesting clients be cautious in dealing with Macy. "I'm
asking the healthy businesses to find a number that they are
willing to invest in this situation in the hopes that it will
work out. Companies which are in weak condition can't afford
another writeoff."</p>
<p>Richard Posner, executive vice president of Credit
Exchange Inc., a source of credit information for apparel
manufacturers, said he is telling clients to sit tight until
he meets with Macy executives. "We want to talk to the
company," said Mr. Posner. Both Solo Credit Service Corp. and
Bernard Sands Credit Consultants Inc. continue to recommend
Macy shipments.</p>
<p>Some apparel executives suggested the recent concern about
Macy may be related to the shipping and payment practices in
the retailing business. Typically stores pay vendors on the
tenth of the month for goods shipped 20 to 50 days earlier.
On June 10, Macy is expected to pay its bills on merchandise
shipped between April 20 and May 20. But it won't have to pay
for goods shipped between May 21 and June 20 before July 10.</p>
<p>"The question is whether you want to extend them credit
for what amounts to 50 days," said Bud Konheim, president of
Nicole Miller Ltd., an apparel maker. "Recent experiences
tell me that where there is smoke, there's fire."</p>
