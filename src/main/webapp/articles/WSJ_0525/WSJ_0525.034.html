	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- In a sudden change of corporate strategy,
Britain's Thorn EMI PLC said it is discussing selling its big
European light bulb and light fixture business to GTE Corp.
of the U.S.
   Such a transaction, valued by London analysts at roughly
350 million pounds ($592.7 million), would expand Stamford,
Conn.-based GTE's European lighting business and strengthen
its standing in the increasingly fierce world lighting
market. The Thorn business is the world's fifth biggest
light-bulb maker, and claims to tie N.V. Philips of the
Netherlands as the largest manufacture of fixtures. GTE ranks
third in making light bulbs, but is a smaller player in
fixtures.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For Thorn, the move to sell what the company had
previously called a "core" business puzzled many London
financial analysts. Since 1985, when plunging profits and a
boardroom coup brought Chairman Colin Southgate to power, the
company has been in a near-constant state of reorganization.
It has shed a movie-making division and a semiconductor unit,
and has been trying to sell its defense-electronics division.
If lighting goes -- Thorn's original business at its 1928
founding -- two main divisions will remain: renting household
appliances, and publishing and recording music.</p>
<p>A Thorn spokeswoman said the lighting-business talks were
necessitated by harsher market conditions. In the past few
years the world lighting industry has been consolidating,
with bigger companies buying smaller ones or forming
alliances. The Thorn business "wasn't of a sufficient size to
compete on an independent basis," she said. Also, according
to London-based analyst Ron Littleboy of Nomura Research
Institute, the Thorn lighting business's operating profit
slipped to about 36 million pounds in the year ended March
31, from 40 million pounds a year earlier. A Thorn spokesman
declined to comment on Mr. Littleboy's estimate.</p>
<p>Neither Thorn nor GTE was willing to discuss the possible
sales terms. "Where'd they get that number?" responded Dean
Langford, president of GTE's Electrical Products Group, when
asked about London analysts' estimates of a possible 350
million-pound price tag. "It's a bit premature to say what
the price is going to be when we're just beginning
negotiations," he added.</p>
<p>GTE and Thorn have already been partners for some time.
The two companies have a joint Italian light-bulb venture.
Mr. Langford said that combining with Thorn's business would
make GTE a "strong number two" in the world-wide lighting
business after Philips -- though it wasn't possible to
confirm that assessment independently. Mr. Langford said the
transaction would strengthen GTE in Italy, Belgium, the
Netherlands, Scandinavia and Australia.</p>
