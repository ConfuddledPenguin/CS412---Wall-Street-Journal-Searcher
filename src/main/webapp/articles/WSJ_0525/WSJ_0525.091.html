	<p class="article-leader">HOLLYWOOD, Calif. -- The two-way contest for the
Democratic nomination for governor is widely seen as a battle
between substance and style, and so far style is winning.
   With the primary election only 11 days away, substance --
or at least the appearance of it -- is represented by
earnest, baby-faced John Van de Kamp, the state's
54-year-old, two-term attorney general. The stylish
candidate, almost everyone agrees, is the elegant,
fast-talking Dianne Feinstein, the 56-year-old former mayor
of San Francisco.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Van de Kamp is traveling up and down the state with
charts and graphs showing how he would balance the state's
budget. He says his opponent doesn't understand such things.</p>
<p>Mrs. Feinstein is telling everyone how dedicated she is to
imposing the death penalty. She says Mr. Van de Kamp, who
personally opposes state executions, can't be trusted to use
the gas chamber frequently and effectively.</p>
<p>If the polls are accurate, Mrs. Feinstein and the death
penalty are edging out Mr. Van de Kamp and his charts and
graphs. But the undecided vote is large in a race that hasn't
managed, until now, to keep California voters awake at night.
And, in these last days of campaigning, highlighted by a
debate here at a TV studio on Sunset Boulevard, Mr. Van de
Kamp for the first time has put Mrs. Feinstein on the
defensive.</p>
<p>"It's going to be very close," says party chairman, and
former governor, Jerry Brown.</p>
<p>Waiting in the wings is the forgotten man, the GOP
gubernatorial candidate, U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, who hasn't
any serious opposition on the June 5 ballot.</p>
<p>This is serious business, or should be. California faces
major problems in financing its public services, repairing
its highways, coping with crime and drugs, and educating a
school population that speaks so many languages it rivals the
Tower of Babel.</p>
<p>There are significant national political implications,
too. California will pick up as many as seven new
congressional seats following this year's census and both
parties are eager to draw the new district lines to their
partisan advantage. Republicans, especially, need their own
governor to thwart the machinations of a Democratic
legislature.</p>
<p>But somehow the gubernatorial campaign seems detached from
the real world facing Californians.</p>
<p>If Mrs. Feinstein isn't celebrating the death penalty,
she's attacking Mr. Van de Kamp for refusing, as Los Angeles
district attorney, to prosecute the so-called Hillside
Strangler for murder nine years ago. It's a familiar story to
Californians. A judge took the case away from Mr. Van de Kamp
and gave it to the attorney general's office, which went on
to win a murder conviction. Mr. Van de Kamp has admitted,
again and again, that he made a mistake.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Mrs. Feinstein camped outside Mr. Van
de Kamp's office and insisted to the assembled reporters and
TV cameras it isn't enough "to grudgingly confess a mistake."</p>
<p>At the same time, Mr. Van de Kamp digs into history to
charge that Mrs. Feinstein left a $180 million deficit to her
successor in her last city budget, for fiscal 1989. In fact,
Mrs. Feinstein's budget message projected a surplus, which
turned into a deficit soon after Art Agnos took office as
mayor. It isn't, in any event, a compelling story for
California voters.</p>
<p>And if Mr. Van de Kamp isn't urging Mrs. Feinstein to own
up to the "d-word" (deficit), he's pointing to his charts and
graphs to explain a budget proposal that is more symbolic
than real.</p>
<p>"It's a campaign gimmick," says Mrs. Feinstein. "Neither
one of us is involved in this budget, and that's the real
world." She misses the point, says Mr. Van de Kamp, in a
separate interview. "You propose and you learn. This is a
challenge to see which one of us has the competence to put a
budget together. She comes up short on knowing how to get
from A to B."</p>
<p>The "g-word" -- gimmick -- explains a lot about this race.</p>
<p>Each candidate is backed by professional political
consultants -- Robert Shrum for Mr. Van de Kamp, Bill Carrick
and Hank Morris for Mrs. Feinstein. They have set the tone.</p>
<p>Mr. Shrum, in a typical Pygmalion-like production, took
his hard-working, nuts-and-bolts candidate, who concedes,
wistfully, that he prefers to operate "on the basis of
civility," and turned him into what one critic calls a
"slash-and-burn populist."</p>
<p>Mr. Van de Kamp admits that his consultants have played a
role "in seeing what you are and what you've done." But he
says he's comfortable with that. He insists he really is a
populist, having taken on the entrenched interests for years.
"Look," he says, "historically I have always stood for the
little guy."</p>
<p>His strategists, seeking ways to overcome the undoubted
reality that Mr. Van de Kamp lacks verve, came up with the
idea that their candidate would sponsor three high-impact
ballot initiatives: first, Big Green, an environmental
proposal that would cut back on the use of pesticides;
second, a measure to limit legislative terms to 12 years; and
third, a crime proposal that would speed up trials and
incarcerate drug offenders in abandoned housing on surplus
military land in the desert.</p>
<p>At considerable cost, Mr. Van de Kamp's campaign rounded
up the signatures and the initiatives will all be on the
ballot in November.</p>
<p>"Vote for my initiatives, vote for me," says Mr. Morris,
one of Mrs. Feinstein's consultants, explaining Mr. Van de
Kamp's strategy.</p>
<p>It is an interesting strategy for defeating Sen. Wilson in
the fall, but it failed to take into account the challenge by
Mrs. Feinstein in the spring. "She's been a breath of fresh
air," says Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, one of her
supporters. "She brings a lot of drama and glamour to the
campaign."</p>
<p>And she struck political gold with her first TV spot. It
showed viewers dramatic footage of the event that propelled
her into office -- the assassination in 1978 of Mayor George
Moscone. And it ended with the kicker that she is the only
Democrat running for governor who's for the death penalty.</p>
<p>She builds on that image by talking about the time she
walked into a corner grocery store after a holdup in which
the grocer and his guard dog were both killed. "There was
brain matter all over the canned goods," she says. This sort
of wanton killing, she adds, "must be stopped, and I'm
absolutely dedicated to doing it."</p>
<p>What's happened here is that a woman noted for the
compassion with which she pulled San Francisco together
following Mr. Moscone's murder has co-opted the crime issue
from a professional prosecutor with 30 years on the job.</p>
<p>Mr. Van de Kamp has tried to respond with ads criticizing
Mrs. Feinstein's record as mayor. And, when that didn't seem
to work, he began running positive ads boasting of his
accomplishments -- a move that prompted a classic line from
Mrs. Feinstein's press secretary, Dee Dee Myers: "He's
resorted to the high road in desperation."</p>
<p>Mr. Van de Kamp continues to confuse some voters by
boasting of the work he has done in putting killers on Death
Row, while saying that he is personally opposed to the death
penalty. And he says that he is personally opposed to
abortion, but would never do anything to interfere with a
woman's right to choose.</p>
<p>"We can't afford to have a governor who is for what he's
against and against what he is for," says Mrs. Feinstein.</p>
<p>And, yet, there is a chink in Mrs. Feinstein's armor, and
Mr. Van de Kamp is finally beginning to take advantage of it.
It is simply this: She doesn't always do her homework. The
result is that in debates and in interviews, she sometimes
blunders. These last few days, she's had to retract
statements twice. "I don't think I backed down," she says. "I
clarified my positions."</p>
<p>The first time, she suggested she was willing in budget
talks to negotiate away cost-of-living increases for the
blind, the needy and the disabled. She "clarified" that
statement by saying that while she would put those allowances
on the table, she wouldn't give them away. In the second, she
suggested she might consider signing a bill to ban
sex-selection abortions if they became a problem in
California. Abortion-rights groups complained sex-selection
laws are "smoke screens" for anti-abortion groups. She
"clarified" that statement by saying she would never sign
such a bill.</p>
<p>"It's fairly clear," says Mr. Van de Kamp, "she has no
ideas of her own."</p>
