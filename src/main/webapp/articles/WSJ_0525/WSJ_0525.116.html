	<p class="article-leader">Over-the-counter stocks rose buoyantly for the 11th
consecutive session. But traders warned the market's rally
could stumble today because of a pessimistic earnings outlook
released last night by software maker Adobe Systems.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 1.42 to 458.29, up 0.31%,
in contrast to the 0.71 slip in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average. Advancing shares led decliners, 1,043 to 892, as
volume fell to 174.3 million shares from 188.7 million
Wednesday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Adobe, based in Mountain View, Calif., announced after the
market closed that it expects earnings for the second quarter
ending June 1 to be lower than its expectations and analysts'
estimates. Adobe shares plunged about 15 in "third market"
after-hours trading to a range of 32 1/2 to 35 1/2, said
Jerry Newman, institutional trader for Cowen & Co. in San
Francisco. Adobe closed in Nasdaq trading at 50 1/2, up 1
1/2.</p>
<p>Mr. Newman cautioned that the after-hours drop in Adobe
may spill over to some other technology shares, particularly
software stocks. However, he said that he expects to see
profit-taking, rather than "panic selling."</p>
<p>Even before the Adobe news, traders were expecting some
profit-taking in the OTC market today because of the
prolonged run-up and the three-day weekend.</p>
<p>Jerry Mullins, head of OTC trading at Dean Witter
Reynolds, echoing Mr. Meisler, said he expects some investors
will take profits this morning before leaving early for the
three-day Memorial Day weekend. "I'm still sitting here with
a lot of `buy' orders, but they've become a little pricey at
this point," he said, echoing Mr. Meisler. Both men said
they're seeing buy orders for smaller stocks from large
institutions.</p>
<p>While larger stocks are leading the OTC market's recent
gains, acquisition interest in smaller OTC companies is
finally attracting some investors to those shares, said
Binkley Shorts, portfolio manager of the Over-The-Counter
Securities Fund, Fort Washington, Pa. The average
capitalization of companies in the $300 million fund is $60
million.</p>
<p>"There's a breath of life in small-cap" stocks fueled by
bargain hunters looking for companies to buy, he said in an
interview. Companies such as Stockholder Systems, COBE
Laboratories and Neeco recently agreed to be acquired, he
noted. Others, such as Child World, have hired investment
bankers to explore "strategic alternatives." And some
companies, such as Horizon Industries, are trying to fight
off potential takeover threats, he added.</p>
<p>Technology shares continued to rise yesterday amid
analysts' recommendations.</p>
<p>Dell Computer moved into the most actives list after the
Austin, Texas, personal computer maker reported net income
for the first quarter ended May 4 rose to 28 cents a share
from 11 cents a year earlier. Dell gained 1 7/8 to 12 on 2.2
million shares.</p>
<p>Novell jumped 4 3/4 to 49 on 2.9 million shares after the
Provo, Utah, maker of personal computer networks reported
late Thursday that net income for the second quarter ended
April 28 jumped to 60 cents a share from 35 cents a year
earlier. The strong performance prompted Shearson analyst
Maria F. Lewis to upgrade her short-term investment opinion
on the stock to "attractive" from "neutral." The analyst also
said that Novell's "increasing status as a benchmark
technology issue" makes it likely the stock will continue to
perform well as technology stocks come back into vogue.</p>
<p>Lotus added 2 3/4 to 36 3/4 on 1.5 million shares. The
stock received favorable comments from Cowen & Co. analyst
Mary Meeker, who repeated her "buy" opinion on the stock.
Also, the New York Times favorably profiled a new software
program developed by the Cambridge, Mass., company.</p>
<p>Among other technology issues, Quantum gained 1 3/4 to 22
5/8. Shearson analyst Doug van Dorsten said the Milpitas,
Calif., disk drive maker's sales and earnings could grow 35%
to 50% over the next 12 to 18 months. Mr. van Dorsten
upgraded his opinion on Quantum to a near-term "buy" from
"attractive."</p>
<p>Players International rose 1 1/16 to 5 1/8 after the
Calabasas, Calif., gaming-services company said it expects to
report pretax operating income for the fiscal year ended
March 31 of $2 million, up from $655,000 in the previous
year.</p>
<p>Shares of National Media tumbled 1 3/8 to 10 1/2. William
Campbell, vice president and secretary of the provider of
marketing services, told Dow Jones Professional Investor
Report he heard that an investment newsletter issued a "sell"
recommendation on the stock late Wednesday. Mr. Campbell also
cited speculation that earnings for fiscal 1990 ended in
March will be disappointing. However, he said there's no
truth to that speculation and added that he remains
comfortable with estimates that earnings will be reported at
$1 a share for the fiscal year, up from 28 cents in fiscal
1989.</p>
