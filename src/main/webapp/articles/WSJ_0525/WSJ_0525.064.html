	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Short interest among smaller over-the-counter
stocks dropped 25.9% in the month ended mid-May, giving back
nearly all of the increase a month earlier.
   Meanwhile, short interest among the OTC market's largest
stocks continued to ease, slipping 1.74%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The short interest in several computer stocks dropped
significantly, including Intel. The short position in the
Santa Clara, Calif., semiconductor maker plummeted 73.6%
after last month's 64.8% rise. Short positions also fell more
than 50% in Softsel Computer Products, Inglewood, Calif., and
Conner Peripherals, San Jose, Calif. On the other hand, the
short interest in Oracle Systems, Belmont, Calif., rose
57.2%.</p>
<p>Nordstrom led the list of companies with the largest
increase in the number of shares sold short. Short interest
in the Seattle retailer surged 104.52% to 2.66 million of
Nordstrom 81.6 million outstanding shares.</p>
<p>First Executive, the Los Angeles life insurance company
that once held a large portfolio of junk bonds, retained its
lead with a short position of 10.4 million shares. In distant
second place was Valley National Corp., a Phoenix, Ariz.,
commercial bank, with a short position of 4.2 million shares.</p>
<p>Several other financial issues surfaced on lists
indicating large volume or percentage increases in short
interest, among them: BayBanks, Boston; Bank South, Atlanta;
Washington Bancorp., Washington, D.C.; SouthTrust Corp.,
Birmingham, Ala.; and Great Bay Bankshares, Dover, N.H.</p>
<p>To sell short, traders borrow shares and sell them in
hopes the stock's price will decline so they can buy back the
shares later more cheaply. Short interest is the number of
shares that haven't yet been purchased for return to lenders.</p>
<p>Although a substantial short position reflects heavy
speculation that a stock's price will decline, some investors
consider an increase in short interest bullish because the
borrowed shares eventually must be bought back. Some short
interest doesn't reflect any opinion on the stock at all but
shows up as part of another strategy, such as arbitrage or
dividend capture.</p>
<p>The National Association of Securities Dealers, the
self-regulatory agency for the OTC markets, reported that
short interest in 2,338 National Market System issues, the
largest OTC stocks, slid to 248,818,151 shares at mid-May
from 253,218,788 in mid-April among 2,346 shares.</p>
<p>Short interest in 1,301 smaller securities traded on the
National Association of Securities Dealers Automated
Quotations system fell to 31,671,000 shares for May, down
from 42,790,704 for April among 1,252 issues.</p>
<p>The National Market System's short-interest ratio at
mid-May fell to 2.59 from 2.69 a month earlier, while the
short-interest ratio for other OTC issues dropped to 0.9 from
1.24 a month earlier.</p>
<p>The ratio is the number of trading days at the market's
average daily trading volume that would be required to
convert the total short interest position. It is considered
by many a measure of negative sentiment. Some analysts
suggest, however, that the ratio has weakened in value as an
indicator because options and other investment products can
be used to hedge short positions.</p>
<p>The adjacent tables show the National Market System issues
in which a short position of at least 50,000 shares on May 15
or in which the short position had changed by at least 25,000
shares from mid-April (see accompanying tables -- WSJ May 25,
1990).</p>
