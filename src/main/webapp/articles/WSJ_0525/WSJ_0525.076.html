	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Japan may dominate in supplying televisions to
the world's living rooms. But when it comes to cable TV,
Japan's couch potatoes still have to buy American.
   Suppliers of U.S. movies and TV programs are facing a
potential bonanza as Japan, one of the world's largest
television markets, rushes into cable television and other
programming possibilities. More than 20 Japanese cable
operators are starting this year, and there are plans for a
total of at least 60. In addition, more than 30 regular
broadcast networks are getting off the ground, with many more
on the drawing board. Direct-satellite broadcasting is also
taking off.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Unlike the U.S., where there are plenty of programs to
fill the vast array of cable channels, the new Japanese
broadcasters simply don't have enough shows. With little time
or money to produce new programs, channels are often forced
to air the same old movies, and even cut down on hours of
transmission.</p>
<p>"Companies will inevitably turn to the U.S." for
programming, considering the current show shortage and the
burgeoning number of channels, says Iwao Ishida, president of
the Cable Television Program Suppliers Association, a
Japanese trade group.</p>
<p>In fact, big U.S. names such as Turner Broadcasting Co.'s
Cable News Network and United International Pictures, which
is the overseas distributor of movies made by MGM/UA
Entertainment Co. and Paramount Pictures Corp., have already
established a presence in Japan. ESPN Inc., the largest cable
network in the U.S., started broadcasting last month. And
Reiss Media Enterprises Inc., which operates a pay-TV channel
in the U.S., plans to air films over a direct-broadcast
channel, via satellite, that will start up later this year.</p>
<p>Among American suppliers of programming, "there's a good
deal of interest" in the Japanese market, says Andrew
Brilliant, senior vice president of ESPN International. "I
know others are looking."</p>
<p>The Japanese government has great hopes for cable
television. As one of cable's chief promoters, Tokyo hopes
cable TV will mushroom in 10 years into a 1.7 trillion yen
($11.15 billion) market.</p>
<p>Japan's cable television, which was launched as far back
as 1954 to help transmit regular TV programs to people living
in the mountains, is still a fledgling industry. Only 1% of
Japan's 37 million households now subscribe to any cable
network, compared with nearly 60% of the U.S. population,
according to statistics compiled by Dentsu Inc., Japan's
biggest advertising agency.</p>
<p>For the time being, that makes subscription costs
extremely high. One Tokyo network charges a hook-up fee
equivalent to around $800, along with a charge of 3,700 yen
($24) a month. With a choice of seven television channels in
most urban areas and thriving video rental shops in every
neighborhood, few analysts think pay television will spread
as quickly as in the U.S.</p>
<p>Some U.S. cable giants such as Time Warner Inc.'s HBO unit
and Viacom Inc.'s MTV think the market is still too small to
venture into. "It's quite a thorny road," says Yasuhiro Kuno,
president of Viacom Japan Inc., which is acting as a liaison
office for MTV in Japan.</p>
<p>Others in the industry are confident that by offering a
wide range of new programs, cable will eventually attract
Japan's dedicated TV viewers, who on average watch the tube
three hours a day. (American households watch an average
seven hours a day.) They believe it won't be hard to compete
with Japan's current TV offerings, which are dominated by
trivia quiz shows, vaudeville comedy routines and dramas
casting not-so-talented pop singers. As the number of
Japanese households nears 43 million by the year 2000, many
analysts project that Japan's cable-TV market will at least
surpass the European market, which is also just getting off
the ground.</p>
<p>"The key is the availability of attractive software," says
ESPN's Mr. Brilliant. Launching its effort, ESPN, in a 160
million-yen joint venture with the giant trading company C.
Itoh & Co., is running 48 hours of programming a week. The
offerings include golf tournaments and boxing, as well as
such lesser-known activities as rodeo and cheerleading.
Dentsu owns rights to the big sport -- U.S. major league
baseball -- which will be shown on a separate network.</p>
<p>The global news coverage of CNN, which is broadcast on
Japan's first cable network, operated by Asahi National
Broadcasting Co., apparently is drawing viewers. Originally,
CNN was aired only in hotel rooms, but now it's gaining an
audience among business people and students, despite the
language barrier, says Hiroki Iijima, a company sales
official. The cable network aims to triple subscribers to one
million in three years, boosting revenue to as much as 30
billion yen.</p>
<p>Hollywood studios are hoping that Japanese movie fanatics
will become loyal cable viewers. UIP, the overseas movie
distributor, last year opened a pay-per-view, all-movie
channel, called Star Channel, in a joint venture with
Tohokushinsha Film Co., Japan's biggest distributor of
foreign movies. The daily 22-hour programming is taking off
by offering collections of Audrey Hepburn movies and U.S.
classics that never came to Japan, as well as recent
releases, says Katsumi Takahashi, general manager of
Tohokushinsha's cable business. Mr. Takahashi won't release
subscription figures, but says that despite the monthly fee
of 2,500 yen, the movie station has become the fourth most
popular among all television channels that cable TV
subscribers watch.</p>
<p>That's pushing Warner Brothers, Orion Pictures Corp. and
Columbia Pictures Entertainment, to offer Star Channel their
supply of films as well. "There will be more Hollywood
movies," says Mr. Takahashi, "They're all wanting to join."
(Both analysts and Tohokushinsha say that Sony Corp.'s
purchase of Columbia won't have any effect on the studio's
position in the Japanese cable industry. Even without Sony,
Columbia already had established ties with Tohokushinsha in
video software.)</p>
<p>Analysts say that aggressive marketing in direct
broadcasting, which started in Japan two years ago, is good
for cable, in the sense that it is already promoting the
concept of paying to watch television. What's more, the local
cable operators are including direct satellite broadcasting
as part of the package for subscribing to cable television,
as an incentive for consumers. NHK, Japan's public television
network, expects that by the end of the year its two
direct-broadcast satellite stations and another commercial
satellite network slated to begin operations in 1990 will
attract two million subscribers.</p>
<p>"In America, things happened step by step," says Taijin
Shiota, a cable television department manager at Dentsu. "But
Japan learned from watching the U.S. and started everything
at once."</p>
