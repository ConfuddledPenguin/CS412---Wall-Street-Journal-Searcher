	<p class="article-leader">SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea recorded a
larger-than-expected 10.3% growth in gross national product
during the first three months of this year, according to the
Bank of Korea.
   The central bank's preliminary report said the nation's
GNP in the first quarter of 1990 amounted to 28.4 trillion
won ($40.46 billion), up 10.3% from the previous year's 25.7
trillion won, at 1985 constant prices. In the first quarter
of last year, GNP rose 6.2%. The two-digit number is far
higher than the government's original projection of 6.5% to
7%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In all of 1989, GNP rose by 6.7%, far down from an annual
average of 12% during the 1986-1988 period.</p>
<p>Bank officials attributed the sharp increase in GNP growth
so far this year to brisk performance in the manufacturing
and construction sectors. The comparatively low growth rate
during the first quarter of last year was a contributing
factor to the sharp increase, they add.</p>
<p>But officials say the economy isn't firmly in the track of
recovery. The rise wasn't led by exports, which have
traditionally been the engine of growth in South Korea, but
by strong private consumption and a temporary construction
boom, spurred by a housing construction rush.</p>
<p>The construction sector grew 39.1% during the first
quarter from a year ago, in contrast to a 10.2% rise in the
first quarters of 1988 and 1989. The manufacturing sector
posted 7.1% growth, up from the year-ago first quarter level
of 1.8%.</p>
<p>The utility sector rose 18.1%, compared with 14.2% a year
ago, largely because of higher electricity and gas
consumption.</p>
<p>The agriculture, forest and fishery sectors, however,
declined 3.6%, compared with a 9.9% increase a year earlier.</p>
<p>Private consumption rose by 11.9% largely because of
strength in sales of automobiles and other durable consumer
goods as well as an increase in spending on services. Fixed
investment rose by 32.1% largely because of heavy investment
in construction and facilities.</p>
<p>Merchandise exports rose a mere 0.1% because of slow
exports of automobiles, toys and other strategic export
items, while imports soared by 15.2%.</p>
<p>The service sector rose by 9%, compared with 7.2% a year
ago.</p>
