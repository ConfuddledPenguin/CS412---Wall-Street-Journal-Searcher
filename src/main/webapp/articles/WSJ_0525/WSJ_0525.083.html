	<p class="article-leader">It's hard to feel glad about President Bush's announcement
yesterday that he wants to renew China's most-favored-nation
trading status. It was the correct call in a rough game.
Trade has indeed proved an opening wedge for free ideas in
China. Revoking MFN and making Americans pay more for
Shanghai knitwear probably wouldn't help budge the Communist
Party from its perch.
   But there's something that sticks in the craw about
conferring the encomium, "most favored," on anything
involving the Chinese government. Surely there must be a way
to renew what is actually routine trading status, accorded to
all but a handful of nations, without implying a political
pat on the back.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>President Bush's statement that China has made some
responsive moves toward U.S. concern for human rights is
wishful thinking. The lifting of martial law in Tibet and
restoration of U.S. consular access there doesn't stop the
torture we keep hearing about. It guarantees no freedoms. No
one in China is safe from the whims of a party that has shot,
jailed and gagged its critics without even a gesture of
remorse.</p>
<p>Dissident Fang Lizhi remains a prisoner in the American
Embassy. His terrible crime was that he spoke out in favor of
democracy, and the Chinese people liked what he said. The
same government that released 211 dissidents from prison
earlier this month retains the power to arbitrarily jail them
tomorrow. Human rights will improve in China the day the
party steps aside to allow civilized and politically
legitimate institutions of government to develop.</p>
<p>Congress will now be poking around in this sad swamp as it
debates whether to block Mr. Bush's MFN recommendation -- a
move that would require a two-thirds disapproval vote in both
chambers. It's worth noting, however, that righteous anger at
George Bush and China can also serve as camouflage for the
protectionist jingoes in Congress who would just as soon wall
out Chinese textiles and toys regardless of what goes on in
Beijing.</p>
<p>There are actions Congress could take that might help wipe
the grin off Deng Xiaoping's face without hurting the Chinese
people. For openers, it might be appropriate to recommend
that most favored nation be renewed for China under a
different label. Say, "capitalist trading status." Why not?
We suspect the dissidents now silenced in China would get a
satisfying chuckle out of it. And it would be a lot harder
for the Chinese government to tell the world that the United
States is coming around to Beijing's point of view.</p>
<p>More seriously, Congress might harness the MFN debate to
another matter that is acutely important to both Communist
China and the rival Nationalist Chinese government in Taiwan.
And it's an issue that underscores U.S. respect for
governments that have made genuine progress. The issue is
admission to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or
GATT.</p>
<p>Neither Beijing nor Taipei currently belongs to GATT, and
both would very much like to join. Technically, there is no
problem with both Taipei and Beijing signing on as separate
members. Under GATT regulations, they need only have separate
customs areas, as does Hong Kong. The decision is up to the
member nations of GATT, but a public recommendation from
either President Bush or Congress could swing a lot of
weight.</p>
<p>Communist China has been kept out essentially because the
member nations think its repressive, centrally planned
economy is just too big a mess to tangle with. GATT has been
waiting for Beijing to reform enough so that it might be
ready to participate in decent society.</p>
<p>Taiwan lost its observer status in 1971, when GATT took
its lead from the United Nations' decision to replace Taiwan
with the People's Republic of China. Since then, Taiwan has
made enormous progress in its economic and political
development. Taipei's Chinese government has liberalized its
markets and flung open the political debate. Taiwan is now
one of the most productive and promising spots in the
developing world. But, as a GATT spokesman told us last fall,
GATT has held up Taiwan's admission as a full member. It's
waiting until Communist China has matured enough to join.
GATT doesn't want to get China miffed by letting Taiwan
through the door first.</p>
<p>By urging that GATT get on with Taiwan's admission, now,
instead of waiting years for China, the U.S. would send a
useful signal. It would set straight for China's leaders
where they rank in world esteem, compared with their
capitalist, democratizing rivals on Taiwan (who graciously
recommended extension of MFN for China). It would give Taiwan
its due. And in a time when the U.S. is already granting the
communist governments of China and the Soviet Union
extraordinary political favors, it would remind the world
that what America most favors are governments that understand
the link between capitalist trade and freedom.</p>
