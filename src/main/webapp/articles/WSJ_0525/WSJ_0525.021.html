	<p class="article-leader">THE PLIGHT OF AFRICA</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Africans lead shorter lives and have the worst
infant-mortality and literacy rates of all developing
regions, according to a new study by the United Nations
Development Program.</p>
<p>The study rated personal well-being in 130 countries based
on a formula combining life expectancy, adult literacy and
per-capita income. Of the 44 countries the study listed as
having low "human development," 33 are in Africa. The African
nation with the highest rating was Mauritius, ranked No. 49.</p>
<p>Africa's per-capita income fell by a quarter in the 1980s,
the report said. It predicted that nearly 400 million
Africans will be living in extreme poverty by 1995, up from
250 million in 1985.</p>
<p>The study also found that some of the world's poorer
countries such as Sri Lanka and Costa Rica have a higher
quality of life than wealthier ones such as Brazil because
they put the poor ahead of the middle class or the military.</p>
<p>JAPAN-OHIO AGREEMENT</p>
<p>Japan agreed to send trade experts to Ohio to promote
imports from that state. Ohio Gov. Richard F. Celeste signed
the agreement with an official of the Japan External Trade
Organization, which has decided that the state-based approach
is Japan's best bet for reducing its $49 billion trade
surplus with the U.S. Under the agreement, the Japanese
representatives will be sent to Ohio for one-year stays to
advise government trade officials and companies that want to
export to Japan. The trade organization has already signed a
similar agreement with Indiana.</p>
<p>ROME AIR-TRAFFIC DISRUPTION
</p>
<p>Air-traffic controllers at Rome's Leonardo da Vinci
airport announced strikes for tomorrow and Sunday and from
June 4 through June 6. The strikes are expected to seriously
hamper flight schedules in other Italian airports. Tens of
thousands of fans will be arriving in Italy over the next two
weeks to attend matches of the month-long World Cup soccer
competition, which begins June 8. The controllers are
protesting what they call unfair working conditions.</p>
<p>INVESTING IN THE PHILIPPINES</p>
<p>Foreign investment in the Philippines reached $47.9
million in the first quarter of the year, up 62.5% from $29.5
million in the like period a year earlier, the Central Bank
of the Philippines reported. Britain topped the list of
foreign investors during the quarter with $14.8 million, or
30.8% of the total, followed by the U.S., with $12.7 million,
and Japan, with $7.8 million.</p>
<p>A MADRID PLAN FAILS</p>
<p>Motorists in traffic-congested Madrid ignored calls for a
"Day Without Cars" yesterday, snarling the Spanish capital
with traffic jams as usual. Police said traffic decreased by
only 3%. Extra commuter trains remained idle, and the number
of passengers on subway services did not increase. Madrid's
commuters have been urged by Mayor Agustin Rodriguez Sahagun
to use public transport on weekdays and save cars for
weekends.</p>
<p>`GODDESS' PROJECT ENDS</p>
<p>Organizers of the radio ship Goddess of Democracy, which
planned to broadcast pro-democracy messages to China, are
abandoning their mission. Pascal Dupont, an organizer of the
mission, was scheduled to announce the termination of the
project at a Tokyo news conference today, the Foreign
Correspondents' Club of Japan said in a press release. "The
ship, still in Taiwan, has been turned away from Hong Kong,
made unwelcome in Taiwan and told by the Japanese it would
not be welcomed. . . . In the face of this opposition, the
organizers have decided to give it up," the release said.</p>
<p>U.N. REFUGEE AGENCY IS BROKE</p>
<p>The Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees, a United
Nations agency that depends on voluntary contributions from
governments, said its financial situation is so desperate
that it could "result in unacceptable suffering and could
even take its toll in terms of human lives."</p>
<p>The agency said it needed $80 million to make ends meet
this year. Staffers said the agency cannot afford to buy food
or blankets for 800,000 Mozambicans who have fled civil
strife into neighboring Malawi. Officials point out that the
agency, which was set up in 1951 to deal with one million
displaced people in Europe, now cares for 15 million on five
continents.</p>
<p>The agency's 43-nation Executive Committee has recommended
that the agency limit the scope of its operations to the
survival of refugees -- food, water and housing -- and leave
the education and self-help programs that have proliferated
over the years to other specialized bodies.</p>
<p>In Japan, the Foreign Ministry said 427 Chinese boat
people who disguised themselves as Vietnamese refugees to
seek jobs will be sent home today.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>Most West Germans favor slowing down German unification,
according to a poll published in Stern magazine. Though most
support eventual union, many fear haste will jeopardize their
affluence, since East Germany will be heavily reliant on West
German financial aid. . . . Commenting on the plans of a
Hungarian businessman to turn Budapest into the Bangkok of
Eastern Europe, replete with brothels and "sex boats,"
Interior Minister Balazs Horvath said prohibiting the scheme
would be useless, "but we hope very much to create a society
in which there is no demand for such services."</p>
