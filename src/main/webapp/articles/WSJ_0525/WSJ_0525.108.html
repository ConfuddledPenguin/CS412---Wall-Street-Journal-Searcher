	<p class="article-leader">HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Frederick W. Zuckerman, Chrysler
Corp.'s treasurer and day-to-day link with the investment
community, is preparing to quit the No. 3 U.S. auto maker.
   Persons familiar with his plans say that Mr. Zuckerman, 56
years old, has told them he expects to leave. But these
persons add that Mr. Zuckerman hasn't specified where he's
going or the timing of his move. One co-worker said his
departure is probably more than a month away, however.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Zuckerman had "no comment" about any move when reached
by telephone in his office yesterday. "We don't confirm or
deny rumors like that," he said.</p>
<p>Last week, Michael N. Hammes, also a vice president,
resigned as head of Chrysler's international operations to
take the top position at Black & Decker Corp.'s core
power-tools division. The departures of the two men aren't
believed to be related, but it couldn't be determined why Mr.
Zuckerman decided to leave.</p>
<p>Mr. Zuckerman joined Chrysler in 1979 during the darkest
of the auto maker's dark days. He acted as Chrysler's liaison
with the federal board that monitored Chryler's loan
guarantees. He also served as a financial adviser during
labor negotiations.</p>
<p>He is currently responsible for Chrysler's pension funds
and for its relations with commercial banks. He recently
oversaw the $1 billion bond offering related to Chrysler's
sale-leaseback deal for its Auburn Hills, Mich., technology
center.</p>
<p>The voluble native New Yorker is popular among investment
bankers and the press because of his financial acumen and
candor. That candor has, however, sometimes caused
consternation among his superiors at Chrysler.</p>
<p>Just days after the stock market crash in 1987, he told
the Dow Jones News Service he was cutting the Chrysler
pension fund's stock and bond portfolio because "the dollar
will go to hell. Therefore, interest rates will go to hell."</p>
<p>"You ain't seen nothing yet," he added. "I do not believe
it is politically possible to do what the country has to do
to reassure the world financial community that we will . . .
run our fiscal affairs in a responsible manner."</p>
<p>Chrysler quickly put out a "clarification," which quoted
Mr. Zuckerman as saying he "was giving my personal opinion of
the overall economic situation, and trying to wake up the
people in Washington. Obviously there are good buys in the
market. I'm buying Chrysler {stock} today."</p>
<p>Another example came early last year, when Mr. Zuckerman
told securities analysts in New York the company believed
"earnings in each quarter of 1989 will be greater than those
in each corresponding quarter of 1988," despite new
incentives. The new-car market soured soon after, however,
and Chrysler ended the year with its largest quarterly loss
ever after a $577 million one-time charge for shrinking
company operations.</p>
<p>Prior to joining Chrysler, Mr. Zuckerman spent 12 years in
financial management at International Business Machines Corp.
Prior to that, he spent almost eight years at Ford Motor Co.</p>
<p>While at Ford, he worked with a number of his current
fellow Chrysler executives. Among them: Vice Chairman Gerald
Greenwald, who once reported to Mr. Zuckerman as a financial
planner when Mr. Zuckerman was controller of the Ford
Division's parts and service operations.</p>
