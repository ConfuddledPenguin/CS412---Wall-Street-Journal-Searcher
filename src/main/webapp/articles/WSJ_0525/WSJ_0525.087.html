	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The budget summit ran into rougher waters as
congressional and administration negotiators disagreed on how
ambitious a goal to set for reducing the deficit over the
next five years.
   Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser (D., Tenn.)
said Democrats want to aim for a package of spending cuts and
tax increases that would total $550 billion to $600 billion
in the fiscal years 1991 through 1995.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But White House and Republican congressional negotiators
resisted, questioning the wisdom of rushing to set a
five-year goal without any discussion of the policies such a
goal would entail, participants said. Some Republicans lean
toward a five-year goal closer to the $420 billion, five-year
figure set in President Bush's budget.</p>
<p>The dispute illustrates the political obstacles the summit
faces. Democrats say they want to wipe out the deficit over
five years without relying on the Social Security surplus, a
target that would require deep spending cuts and large tax
increases. They fear the White House simply wants a pact to
get past the 1992 election.</p>
<p>Republicans are concentrating on achieving a solid
first-year deficit-reduction package of $50 billion or so,
and are in less of a hurry to pin down a five-year target.
They fear the Democrats are trying to lock them into a big
tax increase or are maneuvering to avoid blame should the
talks break down.</p>
<p>"People had different views on what should be done," said
House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.).</p>
<p>Others stressed that the talks remain in what White House
Budget Director Richard Darman has called "the seminar
stage." Sen. Wyche Fowler (D., Ga.), said flatly: "We are not
in negotiation."</p>
<p>An administration official, who asked not to be named,
said, "We all agree: `Let's get something responsible.' We
still haven't decided what `responsible' is."</p>
<p>Participants said the two sides are talking about aiming
for a first-year package of spending cuts and tax increases
of between $45 billion and $60 billion, a significant sum,
but one that would still require altering the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law.</p>
<p>Negotiators set two full days of meetings for June 6 and
7, after Congress returns from its Memorial Day recess, to
examine federal spending and revenues in greater detail.
Negotiators haven't agreed how to proceed after that, but
negotiators on both sides say they hope to begin hard
bargaining promptly.</p>
<p>"The political parties agree that it's far better to see
if we can try to accelerate this," House Budget Chairman Leon
Panetta (D., Calif.) said. Uncertainty over the summit is
already complicating congressional campaigns because
candidates are taking positions on taxes and spending.</p>
<p>Before yesterday's meeting, President Bush charged that
inaction by Congress has created the current impasse over the
budget deficit, and again refused to offer any detailed
solution of his own.</p>
<p>In a news conference, Mr. Bush deflected suggestions that
he make a televised statement to the American people
explaining why the summit is necessary. Lawmakers would be
disappointed if he gave the issue such a high profile now, he
suggested, because he would note "the fact that the Congress
appropriates all the money and raises all the revenues.
That's their obligation." Moreover, he asserted that recent
polls indicate "that people understand that the Congress
bears a greater responsibility for this."</p>
<p>Democrats were quick to respond. "It's the first time in
this century we've seen a president want to give power to the
Congress," Mr. Gephardt said. "The president is wrong if he
thinks the budget is more our responsibility than his."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Bush continued to hear from Republicans who
want him to avoid agreeing to raise taxes. Outspoken tax foes
Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the No. 2 Republican in the
House, and Rep. Vin Weber of Minnesota, joined by House
Republican Leader Robert Michel of Illinois, met at the White
House with Mr. Bush and administration budget negotiators.</p>
<p>At the session at the Capitol, Budget Director Darman gave
negotiators updated deficit forecasts incorporating the
latest Treasury estimates of the cost of cleaning up the
thrift industry. For fiscal 1991, the budget office sees a
deficit of between $179 billion and $205.8 billion, well
above the $64 billion Gramm-Rudman target. This includes
thrift spending of all sorts of between $41.1 and $67.9
billion. For the current year, the budget office now sees a
deficit of $181 billion to $202.7 billion, including $26
billion to $47.7 billion in thrift costs.</p>
<p>The forecasts rely on revised economic projections that
are subject to change again before the July 15 forecast
required by the Gramm-Rudman law. The budget office now
estimates inflation-adjusted economic growth of 2.9% between
the fourth quarters of 1990 and 1991, down from its January
forecast of 3.3%. Compared with its earlier forecast, it now
sees slightly higher inflation and significantly higher
interest rates for this year and next. It also is forecasting
substantially lower corporate profits for each of the next
five years.</p>
<p>The budget office now forecasts rates on three-month
Treasury bills will average 7.7% in 1990 and 6.8% in 1991,
compared with its earlier forecast of 6.7% and 5.4%. It
forecasts rates on 10-year Treasury notes at 8.6% for 1990
and 8% for 1991, compared with 7.7% and 6.8% in its earlier
forecast.</p>
