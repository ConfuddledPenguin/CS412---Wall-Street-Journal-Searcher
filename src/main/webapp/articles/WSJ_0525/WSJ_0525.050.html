	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S.
is being shaken up as management moves to revamp the
executive suite and slash expenses.
   Yesterday, Equitable said chief financial officer, Glenn
T. Gettier, resigned to pursue other business interests. The
resignation of Mr. Gettier, 47 years old, follows John B.
Carter's abrupt departure from the company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Gettier was unavailable for comment yesterday.</p>
<p>Last week, Equitable announced that Mr. Carter, 55, was
retiring as president and chief executive officer, effective
immediately. The company said Mr. Carter had no immediate
future plans. Mr. Carter's duties were assumed by Richard H.
Jenrette, the company's chairman and chief investment
officer.</p>
<p>People within the company who didn't want to be identified
say Equitable's board had been extremely displeased with Mr.
Carter's inability to improve the company's financial
condition consistently in recent years.</p>
<p>Now that Mr. Jenrette has been installed as Equitable's
top executive, he wants to move quickly to streamline other
management positions and reduce expenses, a problem that has
plagued the insurer in recent years.</p>
<p>Equitable said Thomas M. Kirwan will assume the chief
financial officer duties for the entire company as part of a
program to consolidate three separate financial oversight
groups into one unit. Mr. Kirwan had previously served as an
executive vice president and chief financial officer of
Equitable Insurance Cos., Equitable's main operating unit.</p>
<p>"The merging of the financial reporting functions will
streamline operations, reduce costs and will provide improved
financial controls and information," said Mr. Jenrette.</p>
<p>A companywide program to cut costs, which began late last
year and is known around Equitable as "Project Focus,"
appears to have intensified in the last week. Company
employees quoted Mr. Jenrette as saying in the last week that
"over the next 100 days, the company has to cut $100 million
in expenses."</p>
<p>In an interview with The Wall Street Journal last week, he
said that Equitable, the nation's third-largest life
insurance company, had cut expenses by about $50 million in
the last two years and had plans to reduce costs by an equal
amount this year.</p>
<p>As part of Project Focus, agents' commissions on incentive
life insurance policies and certain health insurance plans
have been reduced. The company said a new incentive life
product was being designed that would carry higher
commissions. Travel has been severely curtailed and operating
departments' purchasing practices and expenses are being
closely monitored.</p>
<p>There are also rumors at the company that incentive
bonuses for 1990 will be reduced or eliminated. Middle
managers could get bonuses ranging between 12% and 14% of
their salaries, while executives at the vice-president level
and higher might receive year-end bonuses of 20% to 50% of
their annual pay. A company spokesperson said decisions on
bonuses aren't made until year's end.</p>
<p>In 1989, Equitable reported a much smaller increase in
surplus, which is equivalent to a decrease in earnings.
Surplus increased $14.9 million to $1.33 billion. A year
earlier, Equitable's surplus increased $63 million to $1.31
billion. Mutual companies don't report earnings as such.</p>
<p>The company attributed the results to a downturn in its
guaranteed income contract business, which produced a loss
that it didn't specify. Equitable also cited a one-time,
after-tax charge of about $20 million, related to the decline
in market value of its investment in Lomas Financial Corp. A
still high expense level contributed to the lower 1989
results.</p>
<p>Raymond L. Colotti, chief financial officer for the
Equitable Investment Corp., which oversees the company's five
investment units, will be transferred to Mr. Kirwan's group
as part of the consolidation.</p>
