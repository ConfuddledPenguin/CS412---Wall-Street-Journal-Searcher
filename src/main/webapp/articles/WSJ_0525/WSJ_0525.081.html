	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- While brokerage firms slice away manpower
these days, they are also engaged in one of Wall Street's
biggest spending booms on high-technology trading.
   But for all the boasting, Wall Street's spree is really a
game of catch-up. As takeovers and other sources of revenue
have dried up, brokerage firms are looking more to trading
operations for profits. Suddenly, even the biggest investment
banks find themselves lagging profoundly behind some of their
biggest customers when it comes to using computers for
trading and research.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"When Wall Street put brokerage firms together, all they
needed were people, telephones, quote machines and contacts,"
said Mony Rueven, senior vice president at Jefferies & Co.,
which is spending heavily on computerized trading. But big
institutional investors already are ahead and "getting more
sophisticated and quantitative" all the time, he warned.</p>
<p>When Wall Street worries, it spends big. At Salomon
Brothers Inc., more than 500 powerful Sun Microsystems Inc.
workstations have replaced the timid personal computers that
traders once used as upgraded calculators. Peter Bloom,
Salomon's senior operating officer, calls the $15,000
workstations "high-powered engines" that can do dozens of
tasks simultaneously. People familiar with Salomon say the
firm is using the machines for surveillance of hundreds of
bond and stock prices around the world, watching for price
discrepancies that traders can leap on.</p>
<p>Nearby, a special team works behind locked doors. Called
"Fulcrum," because Salomon wants to "leverage technology,"
the group is building the high-tech guts for Salomon's new
headquarters at 7 World Trade Center. Mr. Bloom says Salomon
will have one of the most technologically advanced trading
rooms in the world when the project is finished.</p>
<p>Up the street from Salomon, at Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc.'s bond trading room, Shearson's huge bond inventory is
constantly updated by trading assistants who enter orders
speaking directly to a computer that understands the human
voice. The system helps Shearson get a better grip on its
trading risk and tracks which institutions are buying and
selling bonds throughout the day.</p>
<p>Despite the costly buildup, Wall Street technologists
concede securities firms still have a long way to go before
they catch up with many of their big institutional customers.
Mr. Bloom of Salomon Brothers said Wall Street is "resting on
the foundation of technology built in the 1970s."</p>
<p>Even Morgan Stanley & Co., which many view as the Wall
Street firm most up-to-date technologically, finds itself
lagging behind. In a confidential report entitled "The
Challenge of the Electronic Marketplace" that is circulating
among top managers, Morgan Stanley's own technology task
force warns: "With the increased sophistication of
institutional investors, it has become mandatory for {Morgan
Stanley} to create vehicles that will enable us to maintain
our presence in this fast-changing marketplace. The firm must
position itself for a new market order."</p>
<p>But Wall Street isn't ready for these changes. The same
report finds that among Morgan Stanley's employees, "few saw
technology as a tool which could be used to overcome hurdles
and build business profitability." The report continues,
"Most business unit managers were unfamiliar with the details
of the electronic marketplace innovations in their areas." It
added, "There seemed little thought given to the fact that
the abundance and speed of market data available today means
that a trader can no longer do all the processing mentally."</p>
<p>Such "parochialism," as Morgan Stanley calls it, seems
rife at other Wall Street firms. For years, Wall Street's
technologists have been consigned to the important, though
less spectacular, task of automating the back office that
processes trades. Typically, the old guard of traders view
technology as a cost that doesn't add much to their daily
profits.</p>
<p>But sophisticated money managers, handling billions of
dollars from pension funds and other institutions, have long
embraced computerized trading and research. At Wells Fargo
Nikko Investment Advisors, for example, $80 billion is
managed without a single glance at a Wall Street research
report.</p>
<p>Most of that money is run with the help of computer models
in huge index funds, which mimic market benchmarks such as
the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index. And more than half of
the Wells Fargo portfolio is traded inside the firm, without
an exchange or brokerage firm.</p>
<p>Not only big investors, but a host of specialty traders
such as Instinet Corp., an electronic trading network, and
broker Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities have taken
huge leaps ahead of mainline Wall Street firms in electronic
trading.</p>
<p>Mr. Madoff's group of traders, for example, use computer
programs that constantly present them with the best
opportunity to hedge or swap a securities position, something
not widely available on a typical Wall Street stock-trading
desk. Electronic stock trading by big institutional investors
on Instinet, a unit of Reuters Holdings PLC, is up 40.2% in
the first quarter of this year from the year-earlier period.
Instinet's market share in over-the-counter and
exchange-listed stocks hit 4.24% last quarter, up from 3% a
year earlier.</p>
<p>"We are dealing with clients that are just as
sophisticated as we are in the use of computers in investment
strategy," says Michael Sanderson, president of Instinet. "If
you are not in the front end of the curve, you will be left
behind."</p>
<p>More and more Wall Street firms are getting the message.
At PaineWebber Inc., analysts are developing a system for the
program-trading department that will study the amount of
stock offered to buy or sell on market makers' "books" for
hundreds of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange.
PaineWebber hopes to be able to develop a computer that will
sell baskets of stock in times of abundant buyers and buy
stock when there are lots of sellers.</p>
<p>According to a Cray Computer Corp. employee, First Boston
Corp., Shearson and Bankers Trust Co. are renting time on
Cray supercomputers, the fastest number-crunching machines in
the world. These firms are using Crays to get rapid answers
about the impact of proposed shifts in their customers' big
securities portfolios. In an hour, a Cray can do calculations
that would take a PC a year to do.</p>
<p>Also, there are signs that a new guard of
computer-versatile traders and managers is rising in the
ranks of Wall Street, gaining power and prestige.</p>
<p>In November 1987, Goldman, Sachs & Co. hired George F.
Adam Jr., once an Air Force officer who helped launch several
Apollo space missions, making him a Goldman partner and
senior technologist at the firm. It was one of the few times
that Goldman has hired an outsider as a partner. A trade
magazine, Computerworld, estimates Mr. Adam earns between
$700,000 and $800,000 a year. Mr. Adam declined to give his
salary.</p>
<p>A year ago, Salomon hired Francis A. Dramis, a veteran of
American Telephone & Telegraph Co., to lead Salomon's thrust
into technology. Mr. Dramis was hired as a managing director,
the equivalent of partner, something that rarely happens at
Salomon.</p>
<p>The new breed of technologists have caught the eye of Wall
Street senior management because these high-tech experts are
adding money to the bottom line by cutting costs, a route
that trading and research personnel rarely take.</p>
<p>When it comes to profitability, "sales and trading was 90%
of the business years ago," said Stephen P. Gott, executive
vice president of trading services at Shearson, a unit of
American Express Co. Now, computer systems help account for
50% of profits, he said, adding that there's "an absolute
need for them due to high trading volumes."</p>
<p>Said Nunzio Tartaglia, a former Morgan Stanley computer
trading expert, "We are at a watershed point because the
machines are making big jumps in speed." Mr. Tartaglia left
Morgan Stanely last September and is now working with Richard
Bartels, a founding partner of money manager Rosenberg
Institutional Equity Management, in a high-tech hedge fund.</p>
<p>"Maybe it's insular thinking, maybe it's arrogance," said
Raymond Killian, senior managing director at Jefferies, about
Wall Street's lag in technology. "But any firm watching
what's going on has to make a commitment to technology."</p>

<p>CRAY RESEARCH Inc. supercomputer-time is being rented by
First Boston Corp., Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Bankers
Trust Co., according to a Cray employee. In a report on
high-technology trading on Wall Street in Friday's edition,
the computer maker was misidentified.</p>
