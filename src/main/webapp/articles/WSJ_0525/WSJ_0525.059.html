	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- British Telecommunications PLC set aside #390
million ($660.7 million) to pay for planned job cuts, part of
a wrenching reorganization aimed at making Britain's main
phone company more efficient.
   The extraordinary earnings charge, to finance job cuts of
about 10% over the next few years, prompted the deepest
plunge in British Telecom's quarterly and annual income since
1985. Net profit attributable to shareholders, roughly
equivalent to net income, tumbled 47% in the fourth quarter
ended March 31 to #195 million from #373 million a year
earlier. Before the charge, however, pretax profit rose 19%
to #684 million from #575 million, largely because of rising
British phone usage.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The cuts are part of a corporate restructuring begun
recently called "Project Sovereign." Though British Telecom's
basic United Kingdom phone business is faring well, the
former government phone monopoly concedes it is overstaffed
and bureaucratic compared with all U.S. and some European
rivals. At the same time, British Telecom managers say they
fear getting sideswiped by increasing domestic competition
unless they cut costs now. By its own measure, said Chairman
Iain Vallance, British Telecom is 10% to 15% less efficient
than the U.S. regional telephone companies, and job cuts and
internal reorganization are needed to boost efficiency.</p>
<p>"We've got some catching up to do," Mr. Vallance said at a
news conference. "We're going to step up the pace of change
at BT."</p>
<p>Such comments are a marked change from British Telecom's
former complacency and follow a series of management shuffles
in the past few months that have increased the tough-minded
Mr. Vallance's power inside the company. Mr. Vallance said he
expects to cut British Telecom's 246,000-member work force by
roughly 10,000 annually over the next two to three years,
partly by attrition and partly by offering older employees
early retirement. The first step in those cuts was announced
a few weeks ago, when the company said it plans to reduce its
40,000-member management staff by between 4,000 and 5,000
this year.</p>
<p>London financial analysts said even deeper job cuts than
the 10,000-a-year rate may eventually be needed, but the
announced pace is as fast as British Telecom can go without
provoking labor or political strife. "If they had announced
40,000 to 50,000 {job cuts}, they might have had mass union
action," said analyst Tim Hirst of London-based Smith New
Court Securities PLC. Three years ago, a relatively minor
company attempt to alter inefficient work practices ended in
a costly, weeks-long strike by its blue-collar workers.</p>
<p>London stock traders greeted the announcements cautiously.
Though Mr. Hirst said the job cuts make "a very good
beginning" for the company's cost-cutting program, British
Telecom shares fell two pence to 276 pence in late trading on
London's stock exchange.</p>
<p>Partly motivating the British Telecom moves is its
managers' growing tendency to measure their company against
the seven U.S. regional telephone companies. Indeed, Mr.
Vallance hired as his strategy chief a former manager at one
of those companies, U S West Inc. Soon, London analysts say,
British Telecom may find itself competing directly with those
companies in the British market.</p>
<p>In recent months, several U.S. regional operators have
quietly invested in British cable-television franchises. Some
British Telecom officials say they expect them eventually to
try using their cables as telephone wires, thereby competing
directly with British Telecom.</p>
<p>If that happens, British Telecom may be in big trouble
unless it boosts efficiency. It has, for instance, 92.7
employees for every 10,000 telephone lines, compared to 49.1
employees per 10,000 lines at the average U.S. regional phone
company, according to a recent study by Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. The reason is largely historical. Before its 1984
privatization British Telecom couldn't get enough cash to
modernize its antiquated phone network. Now it is installing
new equipment that needs fewer workers to tend it -- but that
modernization program will take most of the decade to
complete.</p>
