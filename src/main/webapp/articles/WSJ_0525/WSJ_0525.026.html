	<p class="article-leader">SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korean investment overseas in
the first four months of this year soared 92% to $219 million
from $114 million a year earlier, the finance ministry said,
citing a worsening domestic manufacturing environment because
of rising wages and growing labor unrest. The number of
projects rose to 118 from 72.
   South Korea's total overseas investments to date amount to
$2.1 billion in 1,282 projects. Investments outstanding,
adjusted for withdrawn projects, reached $1.6 billion in
1,009 projects.</p>
