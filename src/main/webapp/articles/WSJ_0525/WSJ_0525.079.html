	<p class="article-leader">Mikhail Gorbachev continues to struggle with the question
of political legitimacy. He has announced plans to expose the
government's new economic program to a referendum, though
it's hard for us to see precisely what might be learned from
the exercise. He would be asking voters to pick between the
doleful status quo and what he's offering -- a watered-down
reform called the "regulated market economy." Will a vote
against the reform mean people want a more radical program or
less change?
   Democracy is normally about real choices, and while the
Kremlin continues to toy with the idea, it's well along
elsewhere in the Soviet empire. Elections Sunday in Soviet
Armenia for its Supreme Soviet provided important gains for
the Pan-National Party, an anti-communist grouping on the
ballot for the first time. Turnout was low -- about 50% --
and results were so unclear that the republic faces a runoff.
But the anti-communists won the Armenian capital of Yerevan
and the city of Kirovakan.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Voters in Parakar, just outside Yerevan, sent a
particularly forceful message. They gave 91% of their vote to
Paruyr Hayrikyan, who backs secession from Moscow. Mr.
Hayrikyan rolled to this margin of victory without shaking a
single voter's hand. The Soviet government dumped him in
Ethiopia back in 1988, and he conducted this campaign from
exile in Glendale, California.</p>
<p>That Soviet Armenia could produce such a result shows the
continuing attraction of the democratic impulse. It must be
remembered that Armenia today is a state in considerable
distress. It has recently endured the devastating 1988
earthquake, a lengthy railroad blockade by Azerbaijan and a
January massacre of Armenians in Baku. Not surprisingly,
these events have sent much of the republic into new
lawlessness and despair. The neighboring republic of Georgia,
which will have elections this fall, has similar instability,
with anti-communist forces forming to produce democracy or
simply to destabilize the republic.</p>
<p>It would be wrong, though, to write off the Caucasus as
little more than a budding Lebanon, as is often the tendency
in the West when dealing with this part of the world. To
dismiss the region as a caldron of inter-ethnic animosity is
to give the Kremlin a rationale for suppressing any
disturbances in the region, as it did last January in
Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>
<p>We're not advocating bloodshed in the Soviet Union, but it
is important to recognize that there are now people
struggling to gain the advantages of democratic
self-determination in places such as Armenia. If the
democratic impulse is to take hold in an Armenia, Georgia or
Lithuania, it is going to be necessary for the West to notice
their advances and support their legitimate needs.</p>
<p>Moscow took Mr. Hayrikyan's citizenship when it jettisoned
him from the country, barring his return to what is now his
own constituency. If Mr. Gorbachev wants to offer voters
choices about their politics or their economy, he could start
telling the exiled but newly elected Mr. Hayrikyan that he
can have his passport back.</p>
