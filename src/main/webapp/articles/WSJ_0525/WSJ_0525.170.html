	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- Compaq Computer Corp., whose stock price has
sailed well above $100 a share, said its directors approved a
2-for-1 split of its common stock.
   The fast-growing computer concern said it believes the
move will make its stock more affordable for smaller
shareholders. Institutions hold an estimated 70% to 75% of
Compaq's shares.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In addition, companies often split their shares in the
belief that a lower price will help the stock price keep
rising. Compaq closed at $122, down 87.5 cents, in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
<p>Compaq said the stock split will be paid July 6 to holders
of record June 29.</p>
<p>Daniel C. Benton, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Co.,
said the move shows that Compaq, the nation's third-largest
maker of personal computers, is confident about its
prospects. But, he said, "I don't know that there is a whole
lot of empirical evidence that when you split a stock, the
stock does better.</p>
<p>"I think it's mainly psychological for the companies," he
said.</p>
<p>Since February, Compaq shares have soared to more than
$120 from around $80. Other technology stocks also have
climbed, fed by European demand for computers and
stronger-than-expected U.S. sales. Analysts attributed
Compaq's surge to renewed shareholder confidence after
Compaq's first-quarter earnings, reported last month,
surpassed most expectations. The company said net income rose
11% to $92.2 million, or $2.13 a share. Sales increased 28%
to $872.2 million.</p>
<p>Compaq said in February that its share of the market for
high-end personal computers was dropping and warned of
stiffer competition in the personal-computer business. But it
said an unexpected 56% rise in overseas sales helped fuel its
first-quarter earnings increases.</p>
