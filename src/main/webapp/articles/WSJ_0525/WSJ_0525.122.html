	<p class="article-leader">A Michigan appellate court has ruled that state regulators
don't have authority to prohibit CMS Energy Corp. from
transferring $1.5 billion in assets out of its utility
subsidiary to the parent corporation.
   The ruling is unlikely to be the last word in a running
dispute between CMS and Michigan officials, both parties said
yesterday. CMS wants to use the assets to expand its
unregulated energy businesses and to buy back stock. State
regulators say the assets should be used only to improve the
financial footing of its regulated utility subsidiary,
Consumers Power Co.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Conflicting rulings have sent CMS's stock on a roller
coaster ride. It plunged $2.375, to $28.625 a share, after
Wednesday's order by the Michigan Public Service Commission
prohibiting the transfer. The stock eased yesterday morning,
but after word of the appeals court decision reached the
markets, CMS shares recovered to close at $29.125 each, up 50
cents, in heavy New York Stock Exchange trading.</p>
<p>CMS Energy officials said that because of the likelihood
of further litigation, they have put on hold their plans to
spend the $1.5 billion.</p>
<p>Consumers Power received $1.2 billion in interest-bearing
notes and a $341 million equity stake last month from its
partners in the Midland Cogeneration Venture. The
cogeneration venture is a once-failed nuclear-power plant now
converted to a gas-fired cogeneration facility.</p>
<p>The public service commission's order said the notes
couldn't be transferred from Consumers Power to CMS Energy,
but instead Consumers Power must use the funds, "in ways that
will secure {Consumers Power's} financial health."</p>
<p>But a three-judge panel of the Michigan Court of Appeals
in Lansing said the utility regulators didn't have the
authority to set such limitations. State officials said they
haven't decided on their next move, but still believe they
have authority to restrict allocation of the funds.</p>
<p>Although the appeals-court ruling clearly is in CMS's
favor, company officials said the prospects of further
litigation mean shareholders won't soon gain the benefits of
the $1.2 billion in notes.</p>
<p>"There's still some other shoes to fall," said John W.
Clark, a CMS senior vice president. "There's still the issue
of who's running this company. Lansing {where state
regulators are} or Dearborn," where CMS's headquarters is
located.</p>
<p>State regulators contend Consumers Power conceded
oversight authority for the $1.5 billion in 1985 when the
company was on the verge of bankruptcy after sinking $4.1
billion into the failed Midland nuclear-power venture. In
return for a special rate increase to ease its financial
problems, CMS agreed to allow the public service commission
to control the use of any proceeds derived from the sale of
the failed power plant's assets.</p>
<p>CMS officials contend they have fulfilled the state's
requirements by getting Consumers Power back on sound
financial footing and by retiring $1.9 billion in debt. Any
further extension of state authority is meddling, CMS
executives say.</p>
