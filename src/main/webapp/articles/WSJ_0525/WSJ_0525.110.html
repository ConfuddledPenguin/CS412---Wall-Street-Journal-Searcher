	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- President Bush vetoed a bill authorizing
$1.4 billion in Amtrak spending for the next two fiscal
years, saying that a provision requiring increased government
review of freight-railroad takeovers represented a "step
backward for the entire rail industry."
   The disputed provision would have given the Interstate
Commerce Commission jurisdiction to review proposals by
non-railroad companies to acquire any of the nation's 16
largest freight railroads.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The ICC already has the authority to review the
acquisition of an entire railroad or a segment of it by
another railroad. It also has authority to review the
purchase of a piece of a railroad by a non-railroad company.
But it may not review the proposed takeover of an entire
railroad by a non-rail company -- a loophole that needed
closing, according to the proponents of the provision.</p>
<p>President Bush disagreed, saying in his veto message to
Congress that the provision was "an unwarranted regulatory
roadblock to financial restructuring of the industry."</p>
<p>Amtrak spokesman John Jacobsen said that, as a result of
the veto, "no trains are going to grind to a halt." But he
complained that it clouds Amtrak's financial future, making
it more difficult for the government-owned passenger railroad
to raise private capital.</p>
<p>Prospects for a congressional override of the veto, which
would require two-thirds votes by both the House and the
Senate, are hard to gauge. The House passed the bill by an
overwhelming 322-93, but the Senate approved it on a voice
vote, so the depth of support isn't clear. Since President
Bush has taken office, Congress hasn't overridden any of his
10 previous vetoes.</p>
<p>The Amtrak bill included authorization of $630 million for
fiscal 1989, which ended last Sept. 30, $656 million for
fiscal 1990, $684 million for fiscal 1991 and $712 million
for fiscal 1992. Congress has already appropriated funds for
the railroad for 1989 and 1990; the vetoed bill includes
authorizations for those years simply for bookkeeping
reasons.</p>
<p>The administration, in its January budget proposal, hadn't
proposed any funding for Amtrak. But President Bush didn't
cite funding levels as a reason to veto the authorization
measure.</p>
<p>Authorizing legislation defines which programs the
government may carry out and sets spending ceilings for them,
while appropriating legislation funds the programs.</p>
