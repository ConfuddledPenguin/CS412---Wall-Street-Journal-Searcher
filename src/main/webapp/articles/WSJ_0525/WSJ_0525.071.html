	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Hudson's Bay Co., the 320-year-old retailing
concern that is 79%-owned by Kenneth Thomson and his family,
said it plans to spin off its real estate unit to
shareholders.
   Donald S. McGiverin, governor of Hudson's Bay, told the
annual meeting that the company's real estate assets, held
through its wholly owned unit, Markborough Properties Inc.,
weren't being properly valued in Hudson Bay's stock price.
The governor's title, similar to chairman and chief executive
officer, dates back to Hudson's Bay's origins in 1670, when
King Charles II of England granted a charter for trading into
Hudson's Bay.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Shareholders will be asked at a special meeting, scheduled
for July 26, to approve the spinoff, which also requires
court and regulatory approval. Terms weren't indicated.</p>
<p>Neil Wood, chairman and president of Markborough, said its
properties have a pretax market value of 1.4 billion Canadian
dollars (US$1.18 billion). He said the assets' market value
exceed book value by about C$1 billion.</p>
<p>Mr. Thomson, chairman of Thomson Corp., and his family own
about 79% of Hudson's Bay's common shares through closely
held Woodbridge Co. After the meeting, Mr. Thomson said the
family would keep the roughly 79% stake it would end up with
in Markborough.</p>
<p>"We like both companies," Mr. Thomson said. "We have no
intention of selling."</p>
<p>Analysts viewed the spinoff favorably, citing a similar
decision by Montreal-based Canadian Pacific Ltd. to spin off
as a dividend to shareholders its real estate unit, Marathon
Realty Co.</p>
<p>"Much like Marathon and Canadian Pacific, you weren't
getting full value recognition for cash flow and real estate
value creation on the real estate end," said Ross Cowan, an
analyst at Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion Inc.</p>
<p>Though this isn't necessarily the best time to take a real
estate concern public, given declining North American real
estate markets, the planned spinoff is timely from a
retailing perspective, Mr. Cowan said. Hudson's Bay's
retailing operations have turned around in the past year,
after incurring heavy losses throughout most of the past
decade.</p>
<p>In the year ended Jan. 31, Hudson's Bay earned C$168.2
million, or C$4.37 a share, compared with fiscal 1989 profit
of C$22.2 million, or, after dividends, a loss of 16 Canadian
cents a share.</p>
<p>"If things hadn't improved, I'm sure we wouldn't have done
it," Mr. Thomson said of the spinoff plan.</p>
<p>Merchandising operating profit at Hudson's Bay last year
rose C$87 million to C$314.6 million. George Kosich,
president and chief operating officer of Hudson's Bay, said
he expects that the stand-alone retailing company's operating
profit from merchandising in the current fiscal year will
grow at least C$44 million. Operating profit is defined as
earnings before interest, taxes, general corporate expenses
and extraordinary items.</p>
<p>Mr. Kosich said Hudson's Bay will keep all the real estate
assets currently owned under its retailing divisions,
including major stores in city cores and its corporate head
office in downtown Toronto. Hudson's Bay has four retailing
divisions and annual sales totaling C$4.6 billion.</p>
<p>Markborough, which was a public company from 1967 until
its acquisition by Hudson's Bay in 1978, had cash flow from
operations of C$61 million last year, on revenue of C$263.7
million. About three-fourths of its assets are
income-producing properties, and about 55% of its portfolio
is in Canada, while 38% is in the U.S. and the balance is in
Britain.</p>

<p>Corrections & Amplifications</p>
<p>HUDSON'S BAY Co.'s real estate subsidiary, Markborough
Properties Inc., estimates the market value of its properties
at 2.9 billion Canadian dollars (US$2.47 billion). An earlier
edition misstated the figure.</p>
