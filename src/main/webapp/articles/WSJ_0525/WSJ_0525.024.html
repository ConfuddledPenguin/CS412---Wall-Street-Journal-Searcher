	<p class="article-leader">It's easy to talk about the environment. But as
competition grows in the consumer-packaging industry to bring
environmentally correct bottles and cartons to market, many
companies are finding that it's no snap to develop packaging
that both protects the environment and sells.
   Consider the experience of privately owned Drug Plastics &
Glass Co. The little Boyertown, Pa., maker of pill bottles,
envisioning a vast consumer market, recently set out to
introduce its Recyclepak, a plastic bottle made with
one-third recycled plastic.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>First, the company had to adapt manufacturing equipment to
extrude three different resins simultaneously, including a
middle layer made from recycled plastic. Now Fred N.
Biesecker, chairman and president, is sweating out two months
of field marketing trials that will determine whether
Recyclepak is as durable and versatile as bottles made from
all-new plastic, which can hold everything from hand cream to
pesticides.</p>
<p>Even if the bottle, as expected, passes muster, Mr.
Biesecker must still worry about the quality of the recycled
plastic he's buying. Many users of recycled materials
complain that curbside collection programs often offer
contaminated loads because plastic, glass and aluminum have
been mixed up in one bag and haven't been cleaned.</p>
<p>"I'm taking a very big gamble," the 50-year-old Mr.
Biesecker says. But he quickly adds: "This baby is going to
work. It's part of the solution" to the solid-waste crisis.</p>
<p>Some industry specialists agree. Arthur D. Little Inc.
forecasts that the market for packaging made at least partly
from recycled material will total $500 million by as early as
the mid-1990s.</p>
<p>To cash in on this market, it helps to have a link to a
big consumer-products company such as Procter & Gamble Co. or
General Mills Inc. P&G says it guided its packaging suppliers
in the development of plastic bottles containing recycled
plastic for Tide and Cheer laundry detergents and other P&G
products. General Mills says it pushed its paperboard
packaging suppliers to the point where, today, 98% of the
cartons it uses for cereals and other dry food are made of
recycled paperboard.</p>
<p>In these cases, however, the packaging companies' problems
get transferred to the consumer-products makers. For example,
after P&G, in 1988, told its packaging suppliers to
incorporate recycled plastic, it conducted extensive tests to
ensure product integrity. It further has set out to ensure a
steady supply of uncontaminated recyclable plastic. Thus, P&G
is now working with several cities and companies on
developing new plastic recycling programs and reprocessing
centers.</p>
<p>Many small packaging companies are struggling just to
create a market. Korrus New Jersey hopes a new packaging
material it makes called Korrvu will replace polystyrene
"bubblepacks" and plastic foam "peanuts" that have long
encased products during shipment.</p>
<p>Korrvu is a thin, tough, flexible plastic film glued to a
cardboard frame that fits snugly inside a corrugated shipping
container. The plastic takes the shape of the product,
effectively immobilizing the contents during shipment.</p>
<p>Although Korrvu uses much less plastic than plastic foam
peanuts, Elliott R. Beneroff, Korrus's vice president, says
the company set out to enhance its environmental credentials.
First, it persuaded Korrvu's inventor to add corn starch to
the plastic, thus making it biodegradable. Given recent
criticism of claims for biodegradable products, Korrus then
found a professor in Rutgers University's biochemistry and
microbiology department who tested and confirmed Korrvu's
biodegradability.</p>
<p>All this, however, only got Korrvu to the starting line.
Next, says Mr. Beneroff, the company searched for a machine
that could affix the plastic film securely to the cardboard
frame. Finding none, Korrus induced a German company to adapt
a similar machine. Even with Korrvu's environmental
friendliness, however, Korrvu has yet to catch on.</p>
<p>At International Paper Co., Robert Gordon, principal
packaging designer, has high hopes for a product that he says
nearly caused him to pull out his hair over the 3 1/2 years
it took to perfect.</p>
<p>It's called the "spout package," a basic cardboard juice
carton with a twist -- specifically, a plastic screw cap on
the carton's gabled top. The package, similar to one Procter
& Gamble has in test markets for its Citrus Hill orange
juice, was initially developed for convenience. But focus
groups with consumers early on convinced International Paper
that people perceived it to be better for the environment
than an all-plastic or even glass or tin container, because
it could be recycled more easily. So Mr. Gordon went to work.</p>
<p>First, he had to lick pourability problems: Some
experimental spouts tended to drip, others to clog. Next, he
developed a form of sonic sealing to affix the spout to the
package because traditional heat sealing wasn't fast enough
to meet the company's manufacturing goal of 70 to 90 packages
a minute. Then the company looked for a plastics molder to
make the top; it rejected 18, mostly for quality problems,
before settling on one. Finally, International Paper had to
help develop machinery for its customers so they could modify
their own packaging equipment to make spout packages.</p>
<p>In this case, at least, the reward seems at hand. Mr.
Gordon says that given International Paper's big share of the
juice-carton market, anywhere from 50 million to 100 million
spout packages could turn up on supermarket shelves over the
next several months.</p>
