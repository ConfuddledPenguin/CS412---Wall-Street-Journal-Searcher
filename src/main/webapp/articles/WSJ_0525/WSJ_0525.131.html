	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Ogden Corp.'s board named Richard Ablon, who
heads the company's largest business unit, as its new
president and chief executive officer.
   As chief executive, Mr. Ablon, 40 years old, succeeds his
father Ralph Ablon, 73 years old, who remains chairman of the
facilities-management company. The post of president had been
vacant.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Richard Ablon will continue as president of Ogden Allied
Services Corp., which generates more than $1 billion a year
in revenue from abatement and decontamination services,
management of buildings and industrial facilities,
airline-industry services, and promotion of sports and
entertainment events.</p>
<p>The younger Mr. Ablon said company operations will
continue as in the past. "In terms of day-to-day reality, it
isn't much different from before." However, he said Ogden is
unlikely to follow through on a possible spinoff of Ogden
Allied, which his father had mentioned to analysts in a
November meeting.</p>
<p>The younger Mr. Ablon also predicted Ogden will post
record revenue and earnings in 1990. The previous highs for
both measures were set in 1989, when revenue totaled $1.37
billion and earnings hit $67 million, or $1.68 a share.</p>
<p>Ogden's other major business, Ogden Projects Inc., builds
and manages solid-waste-to-energy plants and conducts
hazardous-waste disposal operations. It had $329 million in
revenue last year. Ogden Corp. holds about an 85% interest in
Ogden Projects, which is a public company.</p>
<p>Richard Ablon joined the company after graduation from
college in 1971. He previously managed Ogden's entertainment
and aviation businesses.</p>
