	<p class="article-leader">Georgia-Pacific Corp., an Atlanta-based forest products
concern, said it will close its paper mill in Reading, Pa.,
on July 24, idling about 100 workers.
   The company said the mill has become unprofitable because
of aging equipment and increased competition. Georgia-Pacific
had closed the plant for two weeks earlier in the year to
review the operation and to attempt to restore it to
profitability. But it said these steps weren't sufficient.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Paper that is being made in Reading will continue to be
produced in Taylorville, Ill., among other company locations.</p>
