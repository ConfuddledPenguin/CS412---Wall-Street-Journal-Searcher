	<p class="article-leader">Rochester Community Savings Bank, Rochester, N.Y., said
its board adopted a rights plan to protect shareholders from
any unfair or coercive takeover attempts.
   The savings bank said the plan wasn't adopted in response
to any specific offer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The rights plan calls for the declaration of a dividend of
one right for each common share held on June 4. Each right
will entitle the holder to purchase 1/100th of a share of new
preferred stock at an exercise price of $100, should a person
or group acquire 20% or more of the company's shares
outstanding, among other conditions. The rights are to expire
June 3, 2000.</p>
