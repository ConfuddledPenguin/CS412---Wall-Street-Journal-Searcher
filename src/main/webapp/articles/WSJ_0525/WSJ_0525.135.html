	<p class="article-leader">Honda Motor Co. said group pretax earnings in the year
ended March 31 dropped 12% to 152.13 billion yen ($1 billion)
from 172.09 billion yen a year earlier.
   Profit fell 16% to 81.68 billion yen, or 83.37 yen a
share, from 97.3 billion yen, or 98.48 yen a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales increased 10% to 3.852 trillion yen from 3.489
trillion yen.</p>
<p>Honda's pretax earnings for the parent company alone were
better, inching up 1.4% to 90.512 billion yen from 89.273
billion yen in the prior fiscal year.</p>
<p>Honda officials said growing marketing costs and higher
nonoperating costs, including foreign exchange losses and
interest payments, hurt earnings.</p>
<p>Robust demand in North America as well as in Japan, now
enjoying its second longest postwar economic expansion,
combined with the yen's decline during the year raise sales,
according to officials.</p>
