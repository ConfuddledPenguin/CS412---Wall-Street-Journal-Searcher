	<p class="article-leader">HONG KONG -- Taiwan's plans to give foreign banks greater
access to the country's long-protected banking industry
during the next year are likely to heat up competition in a
sector already simmering from recent liberalization measures.
   "The whole industry is going to get blown wide open," says
John Engle, chief country officer for Hoare Govett Securities
Taiwan Ltd. "It's going to be a very big year."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That isn't to say Taipei will soon be edging out Hong Kong
or Tokyo as regional financial centers. The wheels of change
for the country's insulated financial sector were set in
motion only last year, with laws designed to liberalize
financial services, and the current proposals will take time
to bear fruit. Moreover, while the industry is relatively
underdeveloped and the amount of business expected to expand,
the onslaught of new banks at a time when the economy is
being hit by setbacks means some of them may have to swallow
red ink for a while.</p>
<p>"It's a very competitive market already," says Edward
Chien, vice president of Hua Nan Commercial Bank, one of the
country's largest commercial banks.</p>
<p>It's a safe bet that the country's large, government-owned
commercial banks will have a dominant role. Their main
domestic rivals will be the regional banks and the five to 10
new domestic institutions opening sometime next year. And as
foreign banks take advantage of the increased access, they
will assume small but significant roles.</p>
<p>Among those outside entries, Japanese banks are piquing
interest by coming back to Taiwan after a 30-year absence
motivated by economic and political considerations.</p>
<p>The huge government-owned commercial banks have an edge
with their existing branch networks countrywide. They also
are benefiting from the government's efforts to eliminate the
country's underground investment houses. The collapse of many
of these operations has sent depositors scurrying for the
safety of the commercial banks.</p>
<p>The government also is now encouraging its commercial
banks to develop an international profile and help channel
Taiwan's huge cash reserves and corporate earnings into
investments around the world.</p>
<p>"We are very, very strong in many areas," says Mr. Chien,
who thinks the regulatory changes will enhance the commercial
banks' advantages.</p>
<p>But government ownership also sometimes undercuts their
competitiveness. A government plan to sell part of its stakes
in three of the biggest commercial banks, including Hua Nan,
flopped early this month.</p>
<p>Only a few of the investors lucky enough to win the right
to some of the shares actually showed up to buy them because
the market price had sunk far below the sale price announced
by the government weeks before.</p>
<p>The failure startled analysts at the time because the
banks' shares had been so popular that the government was
forced to hold a lottery to determine who could buy the
shares.</p>
<p>But the tepid response now is thought to reflect poor
planning and a weak stock market rather than investor
sentiment on the future health of the banking industry. It
also reflected the common perception that bank shares in
general are overpriced and underscored the uncertainty those
old behemoths face in trying to evolve from a protected
market to a competitive one.</p>
<p>Even if the government goes ahead with the sale as
expected in the next few months, the state will remain
majority shareholder, and it may take two years to complete
the privatization plan for those and other state-owned banks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the commercial banks are saddled with
government-imposed budgets and hiring policies, which bank
officials fear will limit their ability to compete with new,
unfettered banks and some of the aggressive regional banks.</p>
<p>"The pace of privatization has slowed, and perhaps the
government will go ahead and approve new banks while we are
still hand-tied," says Mr. Chien. "We are looking for a free
hand to do our own business."</p>
