	<p class="article-leader">BUSH RENEWED China's trade benefits despite objections
over its rights policy.
   Brushing aside critics who favored a hard line a year
after Beijing's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators, the
president extended China's most-favored-nation trade status.
The preferences give China the lowest possible tariffs. But
the president, speaking at a news conference in Washington,
said it would be premature to grant similar benefits to the
Soviet Union because of concerns over the Kremlin's actions
toward the Baltic republic of Lithuania.</p>

during next week's summit with Gorbachev, but said that few
signed pacts would be produced.</p>

<p>THE NAVY REOPENED its inquiry into the explosion aboard
the battleship Iowa.</p>
<p>Citing an "unexplained ignition" of bags of gunpowder
during testing, Navy Secretary Garrett called for the renewed
investigation into the April 1989 blast, in which 47 sailors
were killed. The Navy also ordered a halt to the firing of
16-inch guns on all World War II-vintage battleships. A naval
report released last September had concluded that the
gun-turret incident on the USS Iowa was "most probably" an
intentional act by a crew member.</p>
<p>Congressional panels, in an assessment of the Navy's
inquiry into the Iowa blast, faulted both the investigation
and the conclusion's "excess of certitude."</p>

<p>Gorbachev offered to lift economic curbs against Lithuania
if the republic suspends its independence declaration, and
said the Baltic state could secede from the Soviet Union in
two years if it follows Kremlin procedure. But the Soviet
leader, who met with Vilnius officials, threatened to impose
presidential rule to block the secession bid.</p>
<p>Premier Ryzhkov warned the Soviet public of the "painful
processes" needed to rescue the economy, but said there
wasn't any choice but to abandon central planning and adopt a
market system. Under the government plan, the transition
would double food prices, and consumers in Moscow and
Leningrad reportedly began panic buying.</p>

<p>The House approved a $4 billion spending bill for fiscal
1990 that includes Bush's long-sought $720 million in aid to
Panama and Nicaragua. The measure would cut more than $2
billion from military accounts to help finance increased
domestic appropriations.</p>

<p>The Senate rejected a provision enabling defendants to
fight the death penalty by presenting evidence that
executions are imposed in a racially biased manner in the
jurisdiction where they are being sentenced. The bill also
includes a provision to bar executions of mentally retarded
defendants in federal cases.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>A U.S. appeals court reversed a lower court decision,
ruling that copyrighted materials may be used in critical
biographies. The appellate court in New York ruled that a
biography of L. Ron Hubbard doesn't violate federal law by
including quotations from the Church of Scientology founder's
published writings.</p>

<p>Israel won't allow U.N. observers into the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip, even if the Security Council approves
establishment of a special force to protect Palestinians,
Foreign Minister Arens said. The 15-nation council is
scheduled to meet today in Geneva to discuss calls by Arab
nations and the PLO for such international monitors.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>About 5,000 demonstrators defied a ban by Romania's
government and protested what they claimed was the governing
party's fraudulent victory in Sunday's presidential and
parliamentary elections. A smaller group of supporters of
President-elect Iliescu and the National Salvation Front
jeered the protesters in Bucharest.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Poland opened talks with labor representatives in an
attempt to end a widening wildcat strike by railroad workers
that has cut off the nation's busiest port. The
Solidarity-led government, which refused to grant pay
increases demanded by the strikers, dismissed the
Communist-appointed director of the rail region along the
Baltic coast.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Japan's Emperor Akihito acknowledged the suffering that
Japanese colonial rule inflicted on Koreans, and Prime
Minister Kaifu expressed "honest apologies" for the "sorrow"
caused by Tokyo's militaristic past. The statements came
during a visit by South Korean President Roh. His trip
sparked anti-Japanese protests in Seoul.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Protesters in Gabon rioted in Libreville and Port Gentil,
setting fire to public buildings and property owned by
President Bongo. The rioters, angered over Wednesday's death
of an opposition leader, also briefly held 10 oil executives
hostage. Paris sent legionnaries to its former colony in
western Africa to protect French citizens.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Mulroney was considering proposals to prevent Quebec from
breaking away from Canada in a dispute over an accord that
would recognize the French-speaking province as a distinct
society. Three of the country's 10 provinces are refusing to
ratify the constitutional accord by a June 23 deadline,
saying it gives Quebec too much power.</p>
