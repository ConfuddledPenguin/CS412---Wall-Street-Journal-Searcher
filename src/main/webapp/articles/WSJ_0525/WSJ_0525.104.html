	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Many lawmakers and administration officials
supporting the civil rights law for the disabled that
Congress is about to pass were moved to act because of
experiences with family members or friends with disabilities.
   Sen. Tom Harkin, (D., Iowa), a leading sponsor of the
legislation, recalls paying a visit to his older brother
Frank in a hospital. His brother had suffered a permanent
hearing loss as a child. When he buzzed a nurse to come to
his room, a voice over a two-way speaker said, "Can I help
you?" His calls for assistance went unanswered until Sen.
Harkin reminded the nurses their patient was deaf.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I can still remember people referring to him as deaf and
dumb," says Mr. Harkin. "Well, deaf people aren't dumb." He
says one motivation for pushing to strengthen the rights of
the disabled was hearing their view that, "We can take care
of ourselves as long as you give us the opportunities."</p>
<p>The bill passed by the House Tuesday and one previously
approved by the Senate would require access for the disabled
in public places and bar discrimination in hiring. The
legislation, which President Bush is expected to sign after a
House-Senate conference, also has drawn personal support from
within both the Reagan and Bush administrations.</p>
<p>Late in his tenure, President Reagan named a 15-member
commission that made recommendations for disability
legislation that paved the way for the current measures. Mr.
Reagan became exposed to the needs of the disabled through
the injury to his press secretary James Brady, who was
wounded in an assassination attempt on the president.</p>
<p>President Bush's continuing support has been influenced
by, among others, Evan Kemp, who uses a wheelchair and who
Mr. Bush recently named to be chairman of the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission. And Mr. Bush's point man
on the legislation has been Attorney General Richard
Thornburgh, who has a son who as an infant suffered brain
damage in a car accident.</p>
<p>Along the way, numerous lawmakers have cited personal
involvement that they say helped them understand the needs of
the disabled. "We just want an opportunity to be able to live
and be able to have an opportunity to work," former Rep. Tony
Coelho, (D., Calif.), who has epilepsy, told his colleagues.</p>
<p>Rep. Steny Hoyer (D., Md.), who took over for Mr. Coelho
as the chief sponsor of the House bill, has a wife with
epilepsy. Rep. James Sensenbrenner, (R., Wis.), married his
wife six years after she was in an automobile accident that
left her paralyzed from the waist down. "I live with a
handicapped person every day of my life," he says.</p>
<p>Among other lead backers of the legislation, Sen. Edward
Kennedy (D., Mass.), has a son whose leg was amputated above
the knee because of a rare form of cancer in 1973; Sen. Orrin
G. Hatch (R., Utah), had a brother-in-law who contracted both
types of polio in college and became a wheelchair user; and
Sen. Robert J. Dole (R., Kan.), has limited use of his right
arm and limited feeling in his left hand because of a World
War II injury.</p>
<p>The lawmakers say their support for the law goes beyond
their personal involvement, however. And a few lawmakers say
they oppose the bills despite personal experience with the
needs of those with disabilities. Rep. Bud Shuster, (R.,
Pa.), whose mother used a wheelchair, opposed the House bill,
mainly because of a provision requiring all buses to have
lifts.</p>
<p>"I strongly support trying to improve the situation for
the disabled," says Mr. Shuster. "I have banged my knuckles
more times than I can remember," he says of trying to get his
mother's chair through doorways that were too small. But the
requirement for costly lifts, he argues, will deflect needed
monies away from door-to-door transportation services that so
many disabled rely upon.</p>
