	<p class="article-leader">Brooklyn, N.Y. -- It isn't surprising that "Facing
History: The Black Image in American Art, 1710-1940" is a
polemical exhibition. The material gathered at the Brooklyn
Museum until June 25 invites controversy, because its subject
matter and its thesis are provocative. But the exhibition,
and especially its catalog, by black art historian Guy C.
McElroy with an essay by the black
scholar-entrepreneur-celebrity Henry Louis Gates Jr., often
overwhelms or distorts the art.
   This happens in two main ways. The first is through the
application of a polemical argument to pictures that seem
inherently to resist clearcut ideological interpretation. The
second is through the inclusion of a number of works that
invite polemics but that hardly qualify as works of art.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Francis Guy's "Winter Scene in Brooklyn" (circa 1817-20)
is a charmingly animated street scene with figures so small
that you can hardly make out who is black and who is white.
But this doesn't prevent the catalog from seeing in it the
servile and "not very important" role of the blacks.</p>
<p>By contrast, a work such as Nicolino Calyo's "Negro Dancer
and Banjo Player" (1835) does show clear racial stereotypes,
but it is so banal and simplistic an image that it hardly
deserves display in an art museum.</p>
<p>Although this exhibition is billed as a history of the
black image "in American fine art," it is something both less
and more than that. Many of the works here are of low
artistic quality, and are included primarily for their
sociological interest. But the exhibition is not quite a
pictorial history of American attitudes toward blacks,
either. For by avoiding crude and violent images (some of
which are illustrated in the catalog), the exhibition pulls
its punches as social history. After all, the treatment of
American blacks between 1710 and 1940 was generally much
worse than one would be led to believe solely on the evidence
of the paintings in this show.</p>
<p>In terms of its "fine art" content, the exhibition seems
to ignore the important point that paintings cannot be fully
interpreted without taking artistic quality, as well as
subject matter, into account. For while some artists are able
to convey the complexity and ambiguity of human situations in
their pictures, others depict almost everything in a
sentimental or stereotyped way. This is one of the
differences between major and minor artists -- and between
artists and mere illustrators. Not surprisingly, a number of
the banal stereotypes of blacks in this show were painted by
artists who also painted equally banal stereotypes of whites.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, because of this exhibition's ideological
program, these kinds of distinctions tend to be ignored.
Little differentiation is made between the sorts of
"messages" contained in works by strong artists such as
Thomas Eakins, Winslow Homer or Eastman Johnson, and those
conveyed by banal illustrational works done by minor artists
such as Calyo, Charles Deas or Lilly Martin Spencer. By not
adequately addressing the question of artistic quality, this
exhibition only partially addresses the role of race in
American "fine art" and in a sense falls victim to the very
sort of stereotyping that it set out to criticize.</p>
<p>The emphasis on ideology rather than art is particularly
disturbing because there seem to be more docents leading
groups through this show than at any other recent exhibition
I have seen. And on the evidence of my own eavesdropping,
what many of these docents are telling their charges picks up
the attitudes expressed in the catalog and on the wall
plaques and runs with them in rather extreme ways.</p>
<p>A case in point is Eakins's "Will Schuster and Blackman
Going Shooting" (1876), in which a red-shirted white man is
shooting a rifle from a boat balanced by a plainly dressed
black oarsman. The catalog makes much of the fact that the
white man's name is given in the title, while the black man
is "identified only in terms of race," and disapprovingly
remarks the differences between the two men's social and
economic positions. The wall plaque notes that although
"blacks were described carefully and sympathetically by
Eakins, they were never depicted in the front of a white
man's boat." Taking their lead from the catalog and wall
plaque, some of the lecturers whom I saw bring groups before
this painting characterized Eakins as a flat-out racist.</p>
<p>But in fact the depiction of the black man in this
painting is both more individuated and more humanly
sympathetic than that of the white man. And while the
discrepancies in naming, like the relative positions of the
men in the boat, reflect a hard social reality, Eakins's
sympathies are much broader than the cliches that are used to
describe the painting. Moreover, since this is basically a
realist work it seems only reasonable that the artist would
reflect the actual social realities of the time, whether or
not they were pleasant ones.</p>
<p>With similar complexity, John Singleton Copley's "Watson
and the Shark" (1778) presents one of the subtlest and most
nuanced portrayals of a black man by any American artist. In
this picture, which was based on a real incident, a boatful
of men desperately attempt to rescue the naked Francis Watson
from the menacing jaws of a giant shark. The sole black man
in the picture dominates the scene below him with gravity and
power. It is he who stands at the apex of the group and it is
he who holds the rope that has been thrown to Watson.
Moreover, the alert downward gesture of the black man's hand
movingly echoes that of Watson's upward reaching arm -- a
poignant and pointed reversal of the customary social
hierarchy.</p>
<p>Given that Watson's business interests were connected to
the slave trade, and that Copley sided with England during
the Revolutionary War, this painting is fraught with highly
nuanced racial and political implications. Thus it was
particularly disheartening to hear a number of visitors
dismiss it as an early instance of racial discrimination
against blacks, especially since in this case the catalog
entry and wall plaque duly noted the ambiguities inherent in
the picture. But unfortunately, the aggressively polemical
tone of the exhibition as a whole seems to have produced a
climate conducive to responses as unreasoning and prejudicial
as those that underlie racism itself.</p>
