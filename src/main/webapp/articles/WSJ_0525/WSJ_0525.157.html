	<p class="article-leader">Taiwan shares resumed their plunge Thursday, as a lack of
confidence persisted.
   In Tokyo, stock prices strengthened on moderate volume, as
arbitrage buying and a surge in large-capitalization domestic
issues sparked a round of buying in the late afternoon. In
London, equities finished a lackluster session lower, as
futures selling and a widespread lack of interest led the
market down.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Taiwan's weighted index, which rebounded 294.08 points
Wednesday, plunged 426.63, or 6.08%, closing at 6587.77, a
15-month low. The index has tumbled nearly 2,000 points, or
23%, since May 16.</p>
<p>All eight sectors registered major losses, falling between
4.86% and 6.48%. Volume, including stocks and mutual funds,
totaled about 969.8 million shares valued at 61.08 billion
New Taiwan dollars (US$2.23 billion), compared with 1.19
billion shares valued at NT$76.45 billion a day earlier.
Among 193 losers, 156 stocks dropped to their 7% limit; only
three stocks gained, and two were unchanged.</p>
<p>The market opened lower, as investors took quick profits
on Wednesday's gains. The declines then widened, as sellers
poured onto the trading floor.</p>
<p>"Weak confidence destroys the game," Elvis Yang, a broker
with Tycoon Securities Co., said. "We see little hope for the
market to reverse its downward trend over the short term at
least." He sees a recovery only if the government takes
actions, such as to reduce the 0.6% stock transaction tax and
to instruct banks to support the market. "Investors were so
bearish, they need someone to lead them," he said. "The
government is the best choice."</p>
<p>Dealers blamed continued drops mainly on concerns about
political uncertainty and capital outflow.</p>
<p>"A calm-down is all investors need right now," said Miao
Tai Sheng, assistant manager of Taiwan International
Securities Corp. He said the market shouldn't be far away
from its bottom, as long as no panic selling surfaces. "The
market is oversold," he said. "It's time to buy low-priced
blue chips."</p>
<p>In Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index of 225 issues, which
added 238.21 points Wednesday, was up 135.24 at 32311.75.
First section volume was estimated at 600 million shares, off
from 640 million shares a day earlier.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index, or Topix, of all first
section issues, which gained 4.36 points Wednesday, added
0.95 to 2395.90 Thursday.</p>
<p>Friday in Tokyo, the Nikkei index advanced 286.67 points
to close the morning session at 32598.42.</p>
<p>Traders said Thursday that the biggest news affecting the
market was Japan Airlines' order for 20 Boeing Co. 747-400s,
with options for an additional 34. A trader said
heavy-industrial machinery makers and other manufacturers
that could supply parts for the project got investors'
attention.</p>
<p>Interest in the domestic manufacturers boosted prices in
other large-capitalization shares, sparking a rally in steel
issues and trading companies, traders said. Moreover,
arbitragers in the late afternoon worked to keep the futures
index at high levels, to sell profitably and then buy through
program trading on the cash index. Consequently, higher cash
prices, coupled with the surge in less expensive, domestic
issues, pushed the Nikkei index into a firmer position within
the 32000 level.</p>
<p>In expectation of strong results from Sony, buying
interest was heavy in the company's shares, as well as in
those of other blue-chip electricals. Sony rose 50 yen to
8,750 yen ($57.76). After trading closed, Sony posted a 37%
rise in consolidated pretax profit to 227.43 billion yen
($1.5 billion) for its year ended March 31, exceeding
expectations. Other high-technology companies posted similar,
favorable results, a trader said.</p>
<p>Mitsubishi Heavy Industries gained 60 to 1,060, mostly on
speculation that the company will be linked to the JAL-Boeing
project, but also that shipbuilding companies' earnings will
be favorable. Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries received
aerospace attention, rising 70 to 1,210, but a trader said
the rise also was linked to rumors the company may take over
Sasebo Heavy Industries, which is said to be having financial
problems.</p>
<p>In London, market watchers said much of the confidence in
equities built up over the past several weeks was knocked out
by Wednesday's worse-than-expected trade data for April. "No
matter how you look at the figures, they aren't good news," a
market maker said. "It has rocked U.K. investors back on
their heels."</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
finished down 10.3 points at 2277.1, off its early-afternoon
high of 2295.4 and well above its midmorning minimum of
2269.3. Turnover amounted to a reasonable 420.3 million
shares, compared with 542.1 million a day earlier. The FT
30-share index ended off 4.8 points at 1805.2.</p>
<p>Traders said the market lacked direction amid an absence
of striking corporate or economic news. They also said there
weren't any European buyers because of the religious holiday,
which closed most financial centers Thursday in Europe.</p>
<p>British Telecom reported a 5.5% decline in full-year
pretax profit and a #390 million ($660.5 million)
restructuring charge. The figures were in line with
expectations, a dealer said, and analysts were optimistic for
the company in the coming year. The stock rose 2 pence to 276
pence.</p>
<p>MEPC, a property company, posted a 20% rise in interim
pretax profit but its shares were hit as a reaction to the
warning that investment values were likely to be in decline
through the year. The company's shares skidded 20 to 489.</p>
<p>One of the day's biggest gainers was Thorn EMI, which
added 21 to 733. The entertainment and technology company
said it is holding talks that could lead to the disposal of
its lighting subsidiary to GTE Corp., a U.S.
telecommunications, lighting and precision materials company.</p>
<p>Oil issues were weaker across the board on a sagging crude
price, dealers said.</p>
<p>British Petroleum fell 7 to 316, Shell Transport & Trading
lost 7 to 457, Lasmo dropped 8 to 385, Enterprise slipped 6
to 611, and Ultramar lost 2 to 339.</p>
<p>Equity prices closed higher in Milan. The Ascension Day
observance closed markets in France, West Germany, the
Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Switzerland, South Africa and
elsewhere.</p>
<p>Share prices rose in Hong Kong, fell in Sydney, Singapore
and Manila, and were little changed in Wellington and Seoul.
Hong Kong stocks extended their rally to a fifth consecutive
session in active trading.</p>

Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
