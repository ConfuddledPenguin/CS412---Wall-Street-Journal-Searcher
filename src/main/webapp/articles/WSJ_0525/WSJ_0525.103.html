	<p class="article-leader">When a business folds, people lose their shirts. But when
a business folds and bundles, people can lose their pants as
well.
   It happened recently in the Seattle area, when Dollar
Saver Cleaner Club Inc., a chain of dry cleaning and
laundromat clubs that offered discount cleaning and delivery
for anybody paying a $20 annual membership fee, washed out.
Owners Jules and Marion Dabbous filed for Chapter 7
bankruptcy-law protection and apparently split town --
without bothering to inform customers or return their
clothes.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Hundreds of former clients have been hung out to dry.
"There is outrage," says Paula Selis, an assistant attorney
general in Seattle. "It's rough on a person when they can't
get their clothes back from the cleaners."</p>
<p>Rough indeed. Darnell Coles, an outfielder for the Seattle
Mariners baseball team, heard that the operators of his
Dollar Saver outlet had padlocked the doors and bolted,
leaving only a scribbly note on yellow legal paper
proclaiming the club permanently closed. This troubled Mr.
Coles, who had nine shirts locked inside. But he wasn't
entirely surprised.</p>
<p>"They'd been taking longer and longer to return my
clothes," he says. "They'd always tell me it'd be a couple of
days, a couple more days. But I never thought they'd stiff me
and skip town."</p>
<p>Rumors about the affair are spreading like a red-wine
stain. Did the Dabbouses mean to take their clients to the
cleaners all along? They do have a spotty past: Records at
the King County prosecutor's office show that the Dabbouses
pleaded guilty in 1987 to permitting prostitution at their
Relax-eena Massage Parlor. The state, sniffing for dirty
laundry, has filed suit against the Dabbouses, alleging
violations of consumer-protection laws.</p>
<p>Another element of the mystery: If Dollar Saver was
legitimate, what, then, took the starch out of the operation?
Ms. Selis says the clubs had operated for about three years
and apparently had a lot of customers. "On the surface, it
looked like they were doing pretty well," she says. Ms. Selis
says her office continues to press its investigation into the
matter.</p>
<p>The Dabbouses haven't come clean as to the motives for
their actions. Greg Cavagnaro, an attorney representing them
in their bankruptcy case, says they're unavailable for
comment. Meanwhile, Ms. Selis says, authorities are taking
steps to redress the balance and return clothes to their
rightful owners.</p>
