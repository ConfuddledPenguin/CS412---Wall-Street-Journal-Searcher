	<p class="article-leader">BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- Columbia Savings & Loan
Association said former chief executive officer Thomas A.
Spiegel was cutting his ties to the troubled thrift.
   Mr. Spiegel, who resigned as chief executive in December,
has been a consultant to the company in its attempt to sell
its $2.9 billion junk-bond portfolio. The sale is crucial if
Columbia, insolvent since Feb. 28, is to have any hope of
avoiding a federal takeover, analysts say. The bidding on the
bonds is believed to be in its final stages, and Mr. Spiegel
has decided to give up the consulting role, Columbia said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Spiegel's consultancy fee was, at the behest of
federal regulators, recently reduced to $1 a year from a
$500,000 annual rate.</p>
