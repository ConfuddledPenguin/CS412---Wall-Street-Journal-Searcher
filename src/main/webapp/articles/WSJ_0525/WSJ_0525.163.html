	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- In an attempt to bury past grievances between
Japan and South Korea, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and
Emperor Akihito both offered apologies to President Roh
Tae-Woo for Japan's harsh colonial rule of the Korean
Peninsula.
   In the strongest statement yet by a Japanese government
official, Mr. Kaifu told Mr. Roh that he felt "sincere
remorse and honest apologies for the fact that there was a
period in our history in which Japanese actions inflicted
unbearable suffering and sorrow on the people of the Korean
Peninsula."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The tone of Japanese regret and reconciliation continued
on through a state banquet hosted by Emperor Akihito in honor
of Mr. Roh. In much anticipated and closely scrutinized
remarks, Emperor Akihito reiterated a statement made by his
father, the late Emperor Hirohito, to former President Chun
Doo Hwan in 1984, and then went further in expressing regret
for the past. "I think of the sufferings your people
underwent during this unfortunate period, which was brought
about by my country, and cannot but feel the deepest regret,"
Emperor Akihito said.</p>
<p>Japanese government officials said the remarks were meant
as clear apologies that identified both the party which
colonized Korea and the party which suffered as a
consequence.</p>
<p>The issue of an apology for Japan's brutal occupation of
Korea from 1910-1945 has been the focus of Mr. Roh's first
official state visit to Japan, which continues through
Saturday. South Korea had demanded that the emperor himself
apologize for Japan's past actions against it's next-door
neighbor. The South Korean people said the previous Emperor's
remarks were vague and difficult to understand. In 1984,
Emperor Hirohito said: "It is indeed regretable that there
was an unfortunate past between us for a period in this
century and I believe that it should not be repeated again."</p>
<p>Mr. Roh appeared willing to accept the Japanese apologies.
He said Mr. Kaifu's remarks reflected the "correct
recognition of history." And in a reciprocal toast at the
state banquet, Mr. Roh was quoted as telling the Emperor: "It
is not possible to erase or forget historical facts.
Nevertheless, we must not remain bound up in memories. It is
significant that Your Majesty, the symbol of Japanese history
and the Japanese nation, has shown deep concern about this
matter."</p>
<p>Just how these remarks will satisfy the South Korean
people remains to be seen. Earlier press reports from Seoul
indicated some dissatisfaction with a draft of the Emperor's
statement shown ahead of time to the South Korean government.</p>
<p>It is also not entirely clear why Japanese officials who
were previously reluctant to apologize changed their stance.
A Japanese Foreign Ministry official attributed the change in
position to the rise of a new generation of young people who
want to put the past behind, making it politically more
acceptable for Japanese leaders to apologize.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Japanese officials are now eager to put
bilateral relations on a more forward-looking track. During
the first hour-long official state meeting, Mr. Kaifu told
Mr. Roh that Japan will help defray medical costs for Korean
victims of the atomic bomb by contributing about 4 billion
yen ($26.4 million) to efforts in Korea to provide care for
victims still suffering.</p>
<p>And while there is still some disagreement over the
treatment of first and second generation Korean residents in
Japan, Mr. Kaifu told Mr. Roh that the Japanese government is
willing to continue looking at the issue.</p>
<p>"We hope to see these problems rooted in the past recede
into the background and to make a new start in building a new
relationship," Mr. Kaifu said.</p>
