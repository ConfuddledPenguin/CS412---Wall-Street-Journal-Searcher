	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission
launched a frontal attack on the Chicago futures markets,
blaming much of the Oct. 13 mini-crash on program selling
triggered on those exchanges.
   The SEC, which made its assault in the report of its study
of the 190.58-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average last October, is certain to use the report as
ammunition in its newly escalated battle with the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission. The SEC, along with the Treasury
Department, is proposing to switch regulatory oversight of
stock-index futures from the CFTC.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Stock-index futures, which are traded on the commodity
exchanges, allow investors to bet on the direction of a
basket of stocks without ever owning the securities.</p>
<p>The Oct. 13 plunge, during which the securities markets
had paper losses of $190 billion, was stunningly fast. In the
roughly 90 minutes after UAL Corp. announced that its
leveraged buy-out had collapsed, the Dow fell almost nonstop
until it closed at 6.9% down from the day's opening level.
Volume levels were massive, with 112 million shares changing
hands in the final hour, alone.</p>
<p>That decline, coming on a Friday, touched off widespread
concern that the following Monday would result in another
1987-style crash. But share prices rebounded on Oct. 16 after
a sharp early morning drop, and the market stabilized.</p>
<p>The SEC study, which in some aspects directly disputes a
report issued by the CFTC earlier this week, shows that last
October's slide was in many ways similar to the 1987 crash.
In particular, the SEC report contends that computer-aided
program trading -- in this case index arbitrage, the most
common form of program trading -- accounted for an unusually
high percentage of share volume during the 190-point decline.</p>
<p>Index arbitrage is a technique that seeks to profit from
price differences between index futures and the basket of
stocks represented in the futures.</p>
<p>But the report also shows some significant differences
between the 1989 minicrash and the 1987 plunge. Selling on
the futures markets centered on "small and large speculative
accounts, foreign accounts, options market makers and major
broker-dealers," the SEC said. Institutional investors, such
as banks, mutual funds and pension funds, which were the
major culprits of the 1987 crash, were net buyers in last
year's slide.</p>
<p>Moreover, the SEC contended that Chicago Mercantile
Exchange floor traders, or locals, were net sellers during
most of the 1989 collapse. Indeed, "locals were the most
active aggregate sellers from 2:40 to 4:15," the SEC said,
representing almost 25% of the selling in Standard & Poor's
500stock index futures during the period. "We did not find
that the futures floor provided any net liquidity," said
Richard Ketchum, the SEC's head of market regulation, who
headed up the study.</p>
<p>That part of the report contrasts sharply with the study
issued just days ago by the CFTC. While the commodities
regulators' work also shows that institutions were buyers, it
doesn't single out futures pit locals as culprits. Indeed,
CFTC officials, who used the same data as SEC staffers,
wondered about the SEC's conclusions. "Locals are large
participants on both sides in most time periods," Steven
Manaster, the CFTC's chief economist, said yesterday.
"Sometimes they'll be a little long, and sometimes they'll be
a little short."</p>
<p>The SEC said that selling by futures traders hit a peak of
50% of the total futures sell volume during one 10-minute
period that was studied. Mr. Ketchum said that by contrast,
specialists on the New York Stock Exchange were "substantial
net buyers" during the periods of peak stress.</p>
<p>But the biggest problem was index arbitrage, the SEC
report said. "Index arbitrage and other program selling
significantly accelerated and exacerbated the market
decline," the report added. Program selling accounted for 36%
of the total S&P 500 shares traded when futures weren't
subject to price limits, the study said, higher than
aggregate index-arbitrage levels during the 1987 crash.</p>
<p>That view also is disputed by the CFTC study, which
concluded that "there was not an extraordinary amount of
index arbitrage activity . . . either in absolute terms or in
relation to total NYSE volume."</p>
<p>The SEC also said that the "circuit breaker" triggered by
the Oct. 13 decline appears to have slowed the decline. The
restriction, one of several put in place after the 1987 crash
to slow sharp market moves, was set off when the Chicago
Merc's S&P 500 futures contract had fallen 12 points.
Contract prices weren't allowed to decline further for a
half-hour.</p>
<p>Switching on the circuit breaker "coincided with a sharp
drop-off in the level of program selling on the NYSE and a
reduction in the rate of price decline in NYSE stocks," the
SEC said. After the price limit expired, the SEC report
added, the price decline in Big Board shares accelerated.</p>
<p>In fact, the Merc's circuit breaker worked so well,
Richard Breeden, SEC chairman, said that perhaps the exchange
should consider keeping it in place until the end of a
trading session, rather than for just 30 minutes. The futures
markets aren't likely to be thrilled by Mr. Breeden's
suggestion that they shut down the pits in periods of stress.</p>
<p>The SEC surely will use the new report to press its case
on Capitol Hill for more regulatory clout. The report's
findings "underline the interrelationship between these
markets," Mr. Breeden said. "It demonstrates the validity of
the administration's point of view that because we have a
single market" of stocks and index futures, a single
regulator should oversee both.</p>
<p>Separately, Mr. Breeden offered the first details of how
the SEC would change the stock-index futures market if it
wins congressional approval for a change in regulatory
jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Mr. Breeden suggested that index-futures investors should
be subject to securities-style protections concerning insider
trading, anti-fraud provisions and suitability standards that
force brokers to make certain that the products are right for
the customer.</p>
<p>Futures-industry officials have argued in the past that
the products are used almost exclusively by large
institutional investors, who don't need the same level of
protection that many stock-market investors require.</p>
