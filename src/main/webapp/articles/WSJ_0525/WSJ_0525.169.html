	<p class="article-leader">STAMFORD, Conn. -- Service America Corp. said it is in
default on a $195 million loan from General Electric Capital
Corp. and expects its losses to widen for the fiscal year
ended March 31.
   The food-service company blamed higher operating costs,
increased competition, and weakness in factory employment in
automobile plants and textile mills where it has significant
operations. The company also cited special charges for
severance and relocation expenses related to senior
management changes made in the last six months.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Service America said its senior creditor, GE Capital,
advised the company that under the loan accord, Service
America won't be permitted to make any payments on its
subordinated debt. The company said a $10.8 million interest
payment on its $127 million subordinated debt is due June 15.</p>
<p>Service America said it and GE Capital, a unit of General
Electric Co., Fairfield, Conn., are discussing a
restructuring of its senior and subordinated debt. The
company plans to file a registration statement within 45 days
to offer a proposal to restructure its subordinated debt.
Meanwhile, it expects to be able to conduct normal operations
and to continue to draw against its $70 million
revolving-credit agreement with GE Capital to make payments
to suppliers, employees and other third parties except for
subordinated creditors.</p>
<p>Service America said it expects to report that net losses
in the fiscal-fourth quarter and full year widened but that
revenue increased in both periods. In the fourth quarter of
last year, the company reported a net loss of $6.3 million on
revenue of $256.1 million. For the full 1989 fiscal year,
Service America had a net loss of $14.4 million on revenue of
$1.04 billion.</p>
