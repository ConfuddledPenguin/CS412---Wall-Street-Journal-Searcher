	<p class="article-leader">Trying to sell your home in a slow market can be a
frustrating experience, especially for people who have to
move because of a new job and those who have already signed
the contract to buy another house or apartment.
   Yet it's a problem that more and more homeowners are
facing these days because of the sluggish real estate markets
in many parts of the country.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Fortunately there are things homeowners can do to increase
their chances of a speedy sale at a fair price. Common sense,
of course, dictates that people trying to sell a home should
get rid of clutter, take the overloaded cat box out of the
kitchen and put eccentric personal items out of sight.</p>
<p>But real estate experts say that it takes a lot more than
that to move a house or apartment in a glutted market. Among
their suggestions: Start out with the right price; know how
to make a home more marketable; and be open to alternative
forms of financing. If all else fails, leasing the home with
an option to buy can be a solution for some.</p>
<p>Overpricing is the biggest mistake homeowners make when
trying to sell, says Stanley Perla, regional director of real
estate for accounting firm Ernst & Young in New York. Even in
good markets, he says, sellers overprice their homes. In a
slow market, they may find themselves dropping the price
repeatedly as the months go by -- and giving their property a
bad reputation.</p>
<p>Avoiding that can mean discarding emotional baggage about
what could have been. If homeowners bought the house for
$150,000, and it was "worth" $200,000 two years ago at the
top of the market, "they think that selling it for $175,000
gives them a loss of $25,000," says Martin Shenkman, an
attorney who specializes in real estate and taxes in New
York. The reality is that "they actually have a gain."</p>
<p>Starting with a lower asking price may be easier if
homeowners keep in mind that they'll also probably have to
pay less for a new home, real estate experts say.</p>
<p>To get a good idea of a competitive price, they advise
soliciting opinions from three brokers. "You want to weed out
those who may overprice to get the listing, and later drop
the price, saying that the market was softer than he thought,
or those who drastically underprice it to move it quickly,"
says Mr. Shenkman, co-author (with Warren Boroson) of the
book "How to Sell Your House in a Buyer's Market."</p>
<p>Choose top firms, real estate advisers say, and ask for
agents who are top sellers and graduates of the Real Estate
Institute or certified residential specialists.</p>
<p>Some experts recommend offering the broker an incentive,
such as an extra percentage point commission or cash if they
sell the home within the agreed-upon period, such as two
months.</p>
<p>Sellers can help market their home by preparing a fact
sheet that includes a floor plan, utility and insurance
costs, and maintenance fees. Ideally, fact sheets should
answer most buyers' questions, and point out features that
make the home particularly desirable, such as proximity to
schools or supermarkets.</p>
<p>Sellers should also figure on spending as much as several
thousand dollars on fresh paint, a professional cleaning job
or having the floors refinished. "When I sold my apartment, I
paid for a maid three times a week, had windows
professionally cleaned, and bought fresh flowers. This sort
of thing sounds simple-minded, but these petty little things
that people think are so obvious are really critical in this
market," says Mr. Shenkman.</p>
<p>If the house still isn't selling and desperation is
setting in, real estate experts have additional suggestions:</p>
<p>-- Offer to pay the closing costs. This is an indirect way
of lowering the price of your home, and is particularly
appealing to first-time buyers who may be short of cash.</p>
<p>-- Consider seller financing. This involves giving the
buyers a second mortgage for some of the down payment. "It
will help some properties sell more quickly by attracting
buyers who may not have enough cash," says Dorcas Helfant,
vice president of the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p>The primary drawback is that if the buyer defaults, the
bank that holds the first mortgage has the primary claim.</p>
<p>-- Lease with an option to buy. This is involves renting
the house and allowing the tenants to apply a portion of
rent, say 15%, toward a down payment. Homeowners who do this
may be able to write off depreciation, maintenance, utilities
and mortgage interest.</p>
<p>The restrictions on deducting losses are the same as for
rental losses under ordinary circumstances: Taxpayers with
incomes under $100,000 can take up to $25,000 in rental
losses each year; this phases out at $150,000. To demonstrate
to the Internal Revenue Service that they haven't converted
their residence to rental property, homeowners should keep
the property listed for sale.</p>
<p>They should also note that this approach can be very risky
if they have a capital gain on their home. If they want to
avoid paying tax on the gain, they will have to roll it over
into a new home within two years.</p>
<p>Getting a bad tenant is another risk, as a Maryland woman
who rented out her house in December learned the hard way.
Adele Conover says she relied on a real estate agency to
screen the tenants. But they not only didn't pay, they broke
all her appliances. And she says that local police told her
the male tenant tried to set fire to the house when his
companion locked him out after he tried to kill her.</p>
<p>One final tip: Hard as it may be to accept, the first
offer is often the best, real estate experts say. That
doesn't mean you shouldn't negotiate. But while the real
estate market may be new to you, the people making the offer
have usually been looking for months, know what they want and
have a pretty good idea what market prices are.</p>

<p>How long it's taking to sell homes in some major markets
this spring. Because some homes are relisted when owners
switch brokers, the actual average number of days on the
market may be about 15% greater.</p>
