	<p class="article-leader">MEXICO CITY -- As Mexico does its version of the economic
shuffle, everyone shimmies in step with "el presidente."
   Witness the quick acceptance of President Carlos Salinas
de Gortari's initiative to return the commercial banking
system to private hands. The same congressman who eight years
ago praised the "brave and patriotic" nationalization, last
week lauded the "firm, patriotic and decisive" privatization.
Both houses of Congress have overwhelmingly approved it.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For a matter treated so cavalierly by politicians, the
nationalization fundamentally reshaped Mexico's economy and
left lasting scars on the Mexican psyche. With funds of the
nationalized banks tied up financing the public sector,
Mexico's long-ignored stock market emerged as one of the
world's fastest-growing. Enrollment at economics schools
soared and Mexico's first financial newspaper found an
audience, as Mexicans groped to understand what was happening
to their money.</p>
<p>What follows are the stories of four people who now find
themselves trying mightly to adapt to the privatization:</p>
<p>The Pundit</p>
<p>When news of the nationalization broke eight years ago,
Luis Pazos picked his jaw off the floor and did what came
naturally: He began to write. Displaying the stamina of the
long-distance runner that he is, Mr. Pazos worked round the
clock to finish his manuscript in two weeks. "The
Nationalization of the Banks" was in bookstores by the end of
the month.</p>
<p>"This sold 60,000 books and had six printings in two
months -- in a country where people don't read books," he
boasts. Mr. Pazos's hard-core brand of laissez-faire
capitalism has struck a chord among a middle class
disaffected with economic populism. Besides turning out about
one best seller a year since 1982, Mr. Pazos hosts his own
radio program, gives seminars to businessmen and writes for
newspapers in many countries, including The Wall Street
Journal's editorial pages.</p>
<p>Critics point out that the popularity of Mr. Pazos's work
grows as the economy deteriorates. And those who allow that
Mr. Pazos was a necessary antidote to the populists, say he
continues criticizing Mexico's current reformist government
because he doesn't know how to do anything else.</p>
<p>"They call me an opportunist," Mr. Pazos says. "An
oversimplifier."</p>
<p>They call him worse than that. One Mexican official calls
him "the ambulance chaser of economics." In 1981 another
official accused him of an "extremism {that} leads ultimately
to fascism." That critic was a young budget ministry
bureaucrat named Carlos Salinas.</p>
<p>The Nationalizer</p>
<p>Clemente Ruiz was an up-and-coming budget official still
in his 20s when he helped draft the 1982 nationalization. "We
wanted a financial system for common people, not
speculators," he says.</p>
<p>This month, Mr. Ruiz was seated in a cramped cubicle in
the national university -- not a corner office of the
National Palace -- when he heard that President Salinas was
undoing the most significant thing Mr. Ruiz had ever done.
"An historic opportunity has been lost," he says.</p>
<p>These days, having been an economic policy maker in the
Lopez Portillo administration isn't an item to highlight on
your resume. The former president himself gets barked at when
he appears in public, a reminder of his promise to "defend
the peso like a dog" shortly before he devalued it. On
campus, Mr. Ruiz is in a kind of intellectual exile, though
he's unrepentant about his role in the nationalization.</p>
<p>Mr. Ruiz says the Lopez Portillo government had to take
drastic action when collapsing oil prices set off a financial
panic so severe that at least $300 million was transferred
out of the country from one midsized Mexican bank in a single
day. He says the nationalized banks helped private-sector
companies work out their debts, and enabled the government to
impose wage, price and exchange-rate controls that have
smothered inflation.</p>
<p>The Banker</p>
<p>In 1982, as they did every year, several dozen of the most
powerful businessmen in Mexico gathered in front of a
television to watch the state of the union address. Rolando
Vega, chief executive officer of a midsized bank, followed
the speech with an advance copy of the text before him. As
the president strayed from the text here and there, Mr. Vega
clung to the hope that he might not lose his bank. Reality
didn't really set in until Mr. Vega later saw troops ringing
the bank lobby.</p>
<p>After the speech, most of the businessmen went to a
presidential reception. Not Mr. Vega. "I'm not going to greet
someone who insults me," Mr. Vega said.</p>
<p>The generally apolitical business community has been
divided ever since. Mr. Vega softened toward the next
government after he was allowed to buy back a stake in his
bank and participate in the liberalized financial services
industry. Last year, the still divided business community
named Mr. Vega as compromise choice to head the largest
business lobby, the Business Coordinating Council.</p>
<p>Now that business has won its demand for private banks,
Mr. Vega says it will show its appreciation by bringing home
some of the estimated $80 billion held abroad by Mexicans.</p>
<p>The Expatriate</p>
<p>When Mexico appeared to go socialist, as Raul de Alba
thought possible after the bank nationalization, San Antonio,
Texas, stood a chance to become for Mexicans what Miami is
for exiled Cubans. Mr. de Alba, a financial adviser who first
came to Texas after a peso devaluation in 1976, became a
godfather to the few hundred moneyed Mexican familes that
straggled to San Antonio after the nationalization.</p>
<p>One expatriate businessman was so fearful for money he had
brought from Mexico and of the long-arm of the Mexican
government, that he scrambled out of the lobby of a Texas
savings institution at the mere sight of the security
cameras.</p>
<p>But now the bold, young Mr. Salinas has come along. "He's
some guy," says Mr. de Alba. "Mexico's future is very
exciting, and I'm looking for a lot of trade with Mexico, a
lot of cross-border investment."</p>
