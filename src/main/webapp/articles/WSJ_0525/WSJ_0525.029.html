	<p class="article-leader">AUSTIN, Texas -- Boosted by unusually strong overseas
sales growth, Dell Computer Corp. said it had record revenue
and net income in its May 4 first quarter.
   Net income more than doubled to $5.3 million, or 28 cents
a share, from the year-earlier level of $2.1 million, or 11
cents a share. Revenue increased 38%, to $120.3 million from
$87.5 million a year earlier, reflecting the highest
quarterly sales in the computer maker's history.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Dell's earnings "exceeded our expectations," said Michael
Dell, chairman and chief executive. They also marked a sharp
turnaround from the past several quarters, when the company
was working off a surplus of high-cost inventory that
severely pinched its margins and reduced earnings to as low
as one cent a share.</p>
<p>While domestic revenue was up 15% from a year ago, most of
Dell's gains were made overseas, where sales more than
doubled from last year's first quarter. International sales
now represent 36% of Dell's world-wide revenue, said Mr.
Dell, compared with 23% a year ago. Dell has international
subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, Canada, West Germany,
France and Sweden.</p>
<p>But Mr. Dell cautioned that the current quarter will not
show the same growth rate, partly because much of the
first-quarter international sales gain was caused by year-end
government orders.</p>
<p>And while Dell's domestic business is "holding its own,"
Mr. Dell added, margin pressures are increasing as
competitors try to increase market share through
more-aggressive pricing.</p>
