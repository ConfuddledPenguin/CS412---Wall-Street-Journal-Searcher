	<p class="article-leader">The Texas murder book, with gore galore, is a phenomenon
of the American publishing industry. You wonder how there
could possibly be 17 million Texans, given our penchant for
bumping each other off in ways bizarre and extravagant.
   Money and sex commonly are stage center in the Gothic
accounts. We have plastic surgeons who poison their womenfolk
and amorous housewives who chop up their rivals with axes.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For several years a famous Methodist minister from Dallas
has been chief suspect in the strangulation of his wife --
who, inconveniently for the minister, lingers on in
vegetative condition. The minister was conducting a torrid
love affair with the daughter of a former Methodist bishop.</p>
<p>You see what I mean about Texas? Maybe it is something in
the manure. Kelly Fero's "The Zani Murders" (Texas Monthly,
322 pages, $17.95) is about murder in Texas, but somehow it
doesn't fit comfortably into the Texas-murder-book category.</p>
<p>There's gore, naturally. Robert Zani, our protagonist,
does more than just kill his mother. He beats her over the
head with a hammer until -- well, you don't want to hear
about that. That's before he takes her and his band saw into
the basement.</p>
<p>Nor is this the full extent of Zani's crime. In 1967 he
executed a convenience-store clerk who was a leading light of
Students for a Democratic Society. Aha, we think, political
overtones] A right-wing nut. But maybe not. Certainly in his
personal life, Zani took a non-discriminatory line. His wife
was a round-faced Mexican prostitute, Irma Serrano, ugly as a
mud fence, to judge from her photo.</p>
<p>The capstone of Zani's career, had not the police caught
him first, might have been the serial murder of real estate
agents. Zani had decided to support his family by murdering
doctors and real estate agents, whose professions he
despised. Lawyers somehow escaped his notice, though they
would seem completely suited to his twin purposes of revenue
and enrichment.</p>
<p>Using false names and stories, he made appointments with
unsuspecting agents. For hours on end, they would explore
this property and that one, while Zani checked out prospects
for mayhem.</p>
<p>Several agents had chilling experiences in Zani's company,
but only one was actually slain -- an elderly San Antonio man
trying to sell a piece of rural property. Zani and Irma (as
she subsequently confessed) shot him three times. He was
carrying just $3 in cash.</p>
<p>A few months later, the cops nabbed Zani in a motel.
Additional murders were suspected, but nothing else was
proved. He was tried and convicted of the 1967 murder and
sent to prison for 99 years.</p>
<p>It's all very grim, and pretty soon the reader starts
wondering what to make of it. What's the big picture here --
the picture that Texas murder books usually succeed at
painting?</p>
<p>Mr. Fero, an Austin journalist, isn't forthcoming with
explanations. We never do find out what makes Zani tick. We
know he has cold, dark eyes, but he isn't exactly your
everyday sociopath, having graduated from the University of
Texas, where he worked as a translator in the university's
archives. One year he ran for student-body president on the
Mickey Mouse ticket and received nearly 1,000 votes.</p>
<p>Though Mr. Fero asserts that Zani belonged to "the
anti-integrationist" Young Americans for Freedom, the reader
gathers he mainly was just a sun nut.</p>
<p>From the text it's reasonably clear that Mr. Fero didn't
interview Zani. Maybe Zani wouldn't cooperate. Whatever the
case, we end up not knowing nearly enough about just what
makes him wacko.</p>
<p>The hint is imparted that Irma was his evil genius, but it
is a hint only, and goes undeveloped. Robert Zani never
becomes a figure of Madame Tussaudian horror; by today's
standards, he is neither particularly monstrous, nor is he
ordinary with that ordinariness that, manifested in certain
criminals, chills our marrow. We read dreary stretches of
courtroom testimony without appeasing our curiosity about
this man, and ultimately the experience becomes irritating.</p>
<p>That's the bad news, from the reader's standpoint. The
good news is what Mr. Fero does with the cops. Two Hispanic
detectives on the Austin police force, Paul Ruiz and Robert
Martinez, cracked the 1967 murders, 13 years after they had
been committed. They weighed and sifted evidence ignored by
their predecessors on the case. They showed extraordinary
initiative. Mr. Fero is a little sociologically sanctimonious
for my taste. The racist white cops couldn't crack the case
but the brown ones could, is what he seems to be telling us.
Who cares? The brown cops did a heck of a job. They were
dogged, perceptive, and fair. Ruiz and Martinez are credits
to the profession, and it is bracing to read in meticulous
detail of their modus operandi.</p>
<p>Yes, occasionally at least, good guys show up in the
Texas-murder-book genre: standing out against a backdrop of
weirdos and sociopaths, reminding us that crime is guaranteed
to pay only in the publishing house's balance books.</p>
