	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Stanislas Yassukovich, chairman of the U.K.
Securities Association, said yesterday that a Pan-European
financial services market will likely remain years away, even
though Europe is moving toward a single market in 1993.
   Mr. Yassukovich, a senior advisor to the U.S. brokerage
and investment banking house Merrill Lynch, and the former
chairman of its European and Middle East operations, told a
European Monetary Union (EMU) seminar that "it will be quite
some time before we have a truly Pan-European retail
financial services market."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>He noted that even with the ongoing deregulation of
Europe's financial barriers, retail services will probably
remain checked by fundamental factors, most significantly the
extensive diversity of client demands throughout the
continent.</p>
<p>Such diversity, he said, will likely continue to limit the
ability of financial services concerns to introduce products
that create economies of scale and profitability.</p>
<p>"I don't think we're looking at anything as optimistic as
a quantum jump in Pan-European services (after single-market
regulations are fully implemented)," he added.</p>
<p>The Merrill Lynch executive compared his company's 450
branch offices in the U.S. to the five it operates in West
Germany. He noted that Merrill Lynch is unable to offer
clients in Hamburg the same products it offers in Munich,
even though clients in both German cities "have the same
economic profile."</p>
<p>"In the U.S. we are able to apply economies of scale (to
the range of products offered)," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Yassukovich stressed that this condition applies in
Europe strictly to retail markets, while he said that
wholesale financial services have operated on a Pan-European
basis for decades. He doesn't anticipate any significant
changes in the wholesale market after 1992.</p>
<p>Regarding Britain's entry into the exchange rate mechanism
of the European Monetary System, Mr. Yassukovich said that he
didn't see the timing of the entry, or the government's
commitment to the system, as of significance to London as a
financial center.</p>
