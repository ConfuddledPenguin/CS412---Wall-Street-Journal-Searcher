	<p class="article-leader">A strange half-calm has settled over the politics of the
large U.S. intervention in the Persian Gulf. The Bush policy
is beginning to have the feel of something vulnerable.
Congress hasn't yet returned to its roost, but the sky is
dotted with the sort of circling opinion that appears
whenever the political establishment senses a President's
policy might stumble. Even among the President's supporters,
various doubts and questions are starting to materialize.
   The most prominent, centering around what might be called
the Kissinger-Haig school, is that Mr. Bush needs to initiate
a pre-emptive strike against Iraq now, before the American
people wimp out. We would support such a strike, but the
idea's underlying premise bothers us: Underestimating the
American people was precisely what was wrong with
Nixon-Administration foreign policy. The American people will
support what makes sense. Somehow in modern, media-obsessed
Washington, this basic truth gets lost when Administration
officials start sweating over whether they're playing well on
the evening news shows.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the crucial area of public support, Mr. Bush continues
to hold a strong hand, and not merely because the latest
opinion polls are showing good numbers. We in fact have
something else in this country on which to base mandates for
presidential policies. They're called presidential elections.
As for many of the others doubting what the American people
will support, we wonder whether they voted with the majority
in the Reagan-Bush landslides. The fact remains that support
for Vietnam and Korea eroded not because of casualties, but
because of uncertain purposes. Again, with no superpower
backing Saddam, that becomes the case with Iraq only if the
Administration makes it so.</p>
<p>So far Mr. Bush is doing well without bloodshed; the
crucial test is what the end game will be. In terms of
lessons for the future, what justifies the efforts we have
undertaken?</p>
<p>Mr. Bush said forcefully several times Monday that he
wants Iraq out of Kuwait. That's fine, but is merely getting
Saddam to trundle back across the border really what this
whole thing is about? Earlier, in announcing that U.S. troops
were going to the Gulf, the policy goal was "defensive" -- to
protect the Saudi oil fields. Then in a speech Mr. Bush
talked about world order. All worthy goals, but they've been
dribbled out separately, almost depending in recent days on
what questions float up from the press pool in Kennebunkport.</p>
<p>Perhaps the question of public goals becomes clearer if we
set the range of alternatives against each other. If the goal
is that Saddam backs down but keeps his military machine,
that is simply not enough. If Saddam stays in office, is
killed in six months and the Baath Party and its military
machine stay in place, that's at best a gentleman's C. If
Saddam is overthrown, his successors are willing to negotiate
arms reduction and we keep a base in Kuwait and cooperate in
a democratic evolution there, that's a solid A-minus. If we
take Baghdad and install a MacArthur regency, that is the
optimum.</p>
<p>At the moment, the Bush Administration seems satisfied to
say that its policy is Iraq's departure from Kuwait. Again,
this quite modest goal isn't likely to sustain a political
consensus for long and will breed uncertainty among the
public. Saddam-out-of-Kuwait is an end point that is very
vulnerable to substantive criticism.</p>
<p>Both the policy elites and the general public are
well-informed by now as to what the current Iraqi regime is
about -- aggressive expansionism backed up by a massive
military structure, a history of using chemical weapons, and
a serious effort to build nuclear and biological weapons. The
public also knows that Iran endured hundreds of thousands of
dead to merely keep Saddam on his side of the border. Now he
is in Kuwait. His grand announcement that he will let foreign
women and children leave Iraq, while presumably retaining his
male "guests," is only the latest demonstration of his
cynicism.</p>
<p>This presidency is demonstrably skilled at working the
political equation, meeting yesterday with 150 Members of
Congress to discuss the situation in the Gulf. But the moment
doubts pervade the American public, Mr. Bush will be several
yards out onto the same thin ice occupied by some of his
predecessors. The Gulf intervention is important. The
public's support will weather the more difficult days to come
if it is told clearly and directly what our goals are.</p>
