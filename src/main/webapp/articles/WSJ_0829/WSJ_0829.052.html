	<p class="article-leader">MANSFIELD, La. -- In this rural hamlet where Confederate
forces scored one of their last Civil War victories, neither
the August heat nor the fact it's church night has deterred
300 David Duke supporters from packing the local Veterans of
Foreign Wars hall.
   "This is the greatest grass-roots campaign ever," gushes
Mr. Duke, the boyish-looking former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard
whose campaign for the U.S. Senate has attracted wide
attention.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Rally-goers eagerly fork over $10 and $20 bills for Duke
T-shirts and other campaign paraphernalia, while almost
everyone stuffs a few bills into the plastic buckets that are
passed around following Mr. Duke's one-hour stump speech. No
one here doubts that Mr. Duke will achieve his fund-raising
goal of $2 million by the Oct. 6 primary.</p>
<p>Indeed, some political observers in the state believe that
Mr. Duke's real purpose isn't to win, but to establish a
national right-wing political fund-raising machine. "I don't
think he really wants to get elected," says former Louisiana
Gov. Edwin Edwards, adding: "It's more fun being a candidate
and building a national image and movement."</p>
<p>Already, there is speculation that if Mr. Duke fails to
unseat incumbent Sen. Bennett Johnston this year, he will
turn around and run for governor next year. And Mr. Duke's
aides openly discuss a 1992 presidential race.</p>
<p>Behind its populist facade, the Duke campaign is a
high-tech money machine. At his campaign headquarters in
Metairie, computers store detailed information on 90,000
supporters nationwide. Those names have spawned a
sophisticated direct-mail effort that has paid off
handsomely. He has so far netted almost $1.5 million, more
than 15 times what he raised for his 1989 state legislative
race and far more than the $575,000 he drew for a fringe 1988
presidential bid.</p>
<p>Mr. Duke's campaign also has inspired a well-funded
backlash. Sen. Johnston is using clips from Mr. Duke's own
campaign commercial to raise out-of-state money for his
hoped-for $4 million war chest. Religious leaders in the
state have organized a political-action committee to defeat
Mr. Duke and have already raised $250,000 toward a $1 million
media effort. Mr. Duke also is being opposed by a number of
conservative activists, many of whom see working against him
as a way to demonstrate that they themselves aren't racist.</p>
<p>Only a small portion of Mr. Duke's campaign donations are
itemized on federal disclosure forms, since the law requires
that individual names be disclosed only for contributions of
more than $200 -- a fact that makes Mr. Duke's fund-raising
controversial.</p>
<p>Linda Melton, a former Duke campaign volunteer, says she
helped collect nearly $10,000 from 1,500 Duke supporters at a
rally in Bossier City last winter. "They {Mr. Duke and his
aides} just stuffed all that money into a garbage bag at the
end of the night and it was never properly counted," charges
Ms. Melton, who left the campaign after a month because she
says she became disenchanted. "David took the money upstairs
himself. Then he chewed us out for missing some people."</p>
<p>James McPherson, a New Orleans attorney who serves as
spokesman for the campaign, confirms that the campaign often
transports large amounts of cash back to campaign
headquarters in Metairie in garbage bags or suitcases. "I was
always concerned that the money was handled by so many
people," he concedes. "But we do the best we can to collect
and account for it."</p>
<p>The candidate himself says he doesn't profit personally
from running for office. But it's difficult to untangle Mr.
Duke's campaign finances from his personal endeavors. His
Metairie home, which was purchased in the 1970s for $20,000,
also serves as his campaign headquarters, his legislative
office and the headquarters for the National Association for
the Advancement of White People -- as well as a business that
sells what Mr. Duke terms "suppressed books" and a consulting
firm that he owns.</p>
<p>Everything is linked. For example, the consulting firm,
BC&E, received $21,900 for rental and other expenses from Mr.
Duke's unsuccessful 1988 presidential campaign. The NAAWP has
paid BC&E $119,000. BC&E, in turn, lent Mr. Duke's Senate
campaign $3,200, which has since been repaid. Several of Mr.
Duke's aides are hazy about what BC&E does, although Mr. Duke
says it owns and leases the computers used in his campaigns.
(He defends all payments to the firm as proper.) The NAAWP,
meanwhile, is reported to be under investigation by the
Internal Revenue Service for allegedly abusing its tax-exempt
status.</p>
<p>None of these problems appears to have put a serious
damper on Mr. Duke's efforts. Neither has an effort to get
political consultants to boycott the Duke campaign. Rusty
Cantelli, a media consultant who has also worked for
Mississippi GOP Sens. Trent Lott and Thad Cochran, shocked
the political establishment here when he signed on to help
write and produce a 30-minute TV show featuring Mr. Duke.</p>
<p>After the program aired last month, more than $90,000
poured into a 900 telephone line that flashed on the screen,
even though some callers were mistakenly routed to a
soft-porn message.</p>
