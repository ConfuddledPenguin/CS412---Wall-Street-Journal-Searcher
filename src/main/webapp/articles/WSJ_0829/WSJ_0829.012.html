	<p class="article-leader">Paris -- In the dingy Belleville section of Paris, several
miles from the Champs Elysees, a young blond American knelt
at the simple gravesite of Jim Morrison. She wrote something
in black felt-tip pen on the singer's graffiti-covered
headstone, took a sip from a can of beer and passed the pen
to a fellow groupie, asking if he, too, wanted to leave a
message. With virtually no room left on Morrison's grave, his
fans, over the years, have taken to writing their tributes to
the lead singer of The Doors on nearby tombs, many of which
look like tiny stone houses with pitched roofs and stained
glass windows.
   Such reverence for their idol, or irreverence for the
dead, if you will, has not met with approval from the
families of those buried nearby, whose graves have been
marked with epitaphs such as "Jim, we love you" and "Jim, we
are near."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the observer stumbling upon this scene, it is an
enigma. It seems straight out of a Vincent Price horror movie
and is, well, at the least, unsettling. But it's also an
amazing phenomenon surrounding a 27-year-old musician from
Los Angeles who died in 1971 of uncertain causes that have
been linked, unofficially, to his alcohol and drug use.
Through his words and music, which obviously have appeal
beyond his time, Morrison has taken on a near cult status,
even to the point of being the subject of an upcoming film by
Academy Award-winning director Oliver Stone.</p>
<p>His movie, "The Doors," which a spokeswoman for the
director said is about Morrison's era, as well as his life,
is due out next spring. Val Kilmer, who co-starred in "Top
Gun" with Tom Cruise, plays Morrison, and Meg Ryan, star of
"When Harry Met Sally," plays Morrison's late wife, Pamela.
The group's drummer, John Densmore, a consultant to the film,
also has just published "Rider in the Storm: My Life With Jim
Morrison and The Doors" (Delacorte), a memoir that begins
with his unhappy visit to the grave.</p>
<p>But in Pere Lachaise cemetery, named for Louis XIV's
confessor, one thing is sure: This is not Graceland and the
people who come to see Morrison's grave aren't Elvis fans.</p>
<p>Jim Morrison is not the only notable in this cemetery. It
also is the final resting place for composer Frederic Chopin,
Honore de Balzac, Oscar Wilde, Edith Piaf, Marcel Proust and
Sarah Bernhardt. But there aren't any groupies at their
graves. As far as the Morrison fans are concerned, Jim is the
only star in this 110-acre stairway to heaven.</p>
<p>Throughout this quiet, leafy cemetery, crisscrossed by
cobblestone paths and filled with huge sepulchers, one day
this summer were homemade signs pointing the way to
Morrison's grave; no matter that some had been scratched in
the side of somebody else's tomb.</p>
<p>Although many of the fans at his grave were barely born
when Morrison was in his musical heyday -- with songs such as
"Touch Me," "Light My Fire," "Love Me Two Times" and "Riders
on the Storm" -- and though he was found guilty in 1970 of
indecent exposure and profanity after a concert in Miami, his
legend just keeps growing.</p>
<p>Not everyone has been thrilled with Morrison's popularity,
even though his gravesite is hardly a secret. (Cemetery maps,
marking the graves of the famous, which are intermingled with
the tombs of the not-so-notable, are sold for about $2 at a
flower shop next door.)</p>
<p>Morrison's grave is the "most visited at Pere Lachaise,"
according to administrator Jean-Jacques Le Forestier. Asked
about attempts by families of those buried nearby to have
Morrison's body moved elsewhere, Mr. Le Forestier quickly
dismisses this as something that happened "in the past." Now,
Morrison's final resting place is secured, perhaps aided by
an agreement with the singer's family to help purchase a
machine, for an undisclosed sum, to clean the graffiti off
neighboring graves. The machine, just recently arrived, "is
working very well," Mr. Le Forestier noted.</p>
<p>"It was Mr. Morrison's wish to stay in Paris. His family
is going to honor that wish and so is the City of Paris," he
added.</p>
<p>Although the hoopla surrounding Morrison and The Doors
might seem hard for some to grasp, it is no surprise to New
York City DJ Dave Herman, who said he was one of the first
people to announce the death of the rock star in 1971.</p>
<p>"The Doors are unique in the fact that their popularity
never waned," said Mr. Herman, who hosts the Dave Herman Rock
'n' Roll Morning Show on WNEW-FM. "It's ongoing," he noted,
adding their music is played as much on the radio now as it
was in their heyday.</p>
<p>The Doors' records sales continue to be "amazing,"
according to an Elektra Records spokeswoman. This year alone,
The Doors are expected to sell 650,000 records. The group's
"Best of The Doors" album, released in 1973, has sold 10
million copies.</p>
<p>Listening again to the music of The Doors, these songs,
with sexual innuendos that bothered the likes of Ed Sullivan
when the band once performed on his show, are tame by today's
standards. But even an inexpert listener can find in
Morrison's lyrics the voices of those turbulent times.</p>
<p>And in Pere Lachaise cemetery, it's as if Morrison is
alive again and his fans have picked up on his poetry. One
message, scrawled across a neighboring tomb, was written in
Russian; other messages were like notes to an old friend:
"Jim, see you. Don't know where"; "We live in Morrison
Hotel"; "God bless Jim and The Doors"; "Mr. Mo-Jo Rising";
"Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, forever"; "Come
Back"; "Thanks for your music"; and "Seasoned Sleeper, sleep
well."</p>
<p>When Morrison died of a heart attack in a bathtub in
Paris, his death was kept secret for nearly a week, according
to Rolling Stone Rock Almanac, in an attempt to avoid "the
circus-like atmosphere that surrounded the deaths of Janis
Joplin and Jimi Hendrix." But Morrison's fans, it seems,
wouldn't be robbed of a chance to pay their own special kind
of grave tributes, and no graffiti-cleaning machine is likely
to take that away from them.</p>
