	<p class="article-leader">Now that President Bush has dispatched tens of thousands
of soldiers to the Middle East, we should be able to declare
victory on at least one front. There's hardly a peep from
voices that had insisted since Vietnam that Congress and only
Congress has the power to risk war. Mr. Bush has reclaimed
the commander-in-chief powers for the presidency.
   Indeed, Saddam Hussein's only virtue is that the War
Powers Resolution seems to have been his first victim. This
1973 law, viewed as unconstitutional by every president
since, says that presidents can send troops into "imminent
hostilities" only if Congress declares war, passes a law
allowing the deployment or if there's an attack on U.S.
territory or armed forces.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yet Mr. Bush accomplished a huge call-up while Congress
was out of town. Texas Democrat Henry Gonzalez got no takers
last week when he begged Congress to rush back from recess
"to preserve the integrity of its own powers in passing the
War Powers Resolution." Rep. Gonzalez asked in a letter to
House Speaker Thomas Foley, "Do we have a president? a
Caesar? a monarch? a potentate?" At the risk of giving
someone any ideas, there's one sure tactic for a congressman
who wants to save the War Powers Resolution, to wit: Sic an
independent counsel to prosecute Mr. Bush and his aides for
violating it.</p>
<p>You don't have to agree that the constitutional imbalance
of power has recently been at the expense of presidents to be
glad that the debate now is about military and not legal
strategy. The overhanging danger in separation-of-powers
battles is that supposed legalities can quickly cloud debate
over the substance of policy -- remember Iran-Contra. As time
passes and different risks arise, though, Mr. Bush will have
to decide which tack to take with Congress. He can continue
to act alone, he can ask for a declaration of war or he can
do something in between.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush knows that if things get messy in the Middle
East, some congressman is bound to invoke legal constraints.
This is why he sent Congress a letter earlier this month "in
accordance with my desire that Congress be fully informed and
consistent with the War Powers Resolution." This described
the deployment of forces, noting that "I do not believe
involvement in hostilities is imminent."</p>
<p>This is just-in-case boilerplate so that if someone tries
to invoke the resolution, Mr. Bush can at least argue that
the 60-day clock hasn't started ticking yet. This language is
important because the resolution says that 60 days after
"imminent hostilities," Congress must vote to approve any
deployment or the president must bring the troops home 30
days after that.</p>
<p>Washington lawyer Abraham Sofaer knows all about the
fetters of excessive legalisms on presidents. He is the
former federal judge who did separation-of-powers hazard duty
as legal adviser in the State Department from 1985 until this
past June. "Those people who say presidents don't have the
power to act have been wrong ever since Alexander Hamilton
and James Madison agreed that President Washington had the
power without Congress to declare neutrality in violation of
a treaty with France, risking war," he said this week. "Those
people are still wrong."</p>
<p>If he were still in the business of giving legal advice to
presidents, Mr. Sofaer said he'd tell Mr. Bush that "it would
be a catastrophe if he asked Congress for authority to do
what he's done. Instead, he needs to say he doesn't need the
authority." The Founders intended that presidents would act
alone. They gave Congress the power formally to "declare"
war, but empowered the president when necessary to respond to
aggression by making war.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush has a long list of precedents for his actions. As
of 1970, the last time official figures were collected,
presidents had sent troops or arms abroad 199 times where
Congress hadn't declared war, which has happened only five
times. Congress had consented in only 62 of the incidents, by
appropriating specific funds, passing resolutions or
ratifying treaties that gave the president authority to act.
In the remaining 137 instances -- that is, two-thirds of the
time -- presidents acted entirely without authorization by
Congress. The ratio would be even higher counting the Reagan
presidency's unilateral actions, such as in Grenada and
Libya.</p>
<p>Mr. Sofaer's point about unilateral presidential power
aside, there's a good argument that Mr. Bush should recruit
some kind of formal support from Congress. The Gulf of Tonkin
resolution did not stop Congress from tiring of Vietnam. But
when Congress shares some accountability, it at least helps
keep the debate on the merits of the policy and away from
whether the policy is somehow "illegal."</p>
<p>Law aside, politics will force Mr. Bush to give Congress a
clearer explanation of his intentions. Does he want Saddam
only out of Kuwait or also out of Iraq? Will he be satisfied
if Iraq retains chemical weapons? Does he think the fate of
our hostages could justify military action?</p>
<p>"We want either Perdicaris alive or Raisuli dead," Teddy
Roosevelt announced in 1904 when he sent warships to Morocco
to force a bandit chieftain to release a kidnapped
Greek-American, Ion Perdicaris. Mr. Bush has not yet said,
"We want either Ambassador Nathaniel Howell alive or Saddam
dead." If he does, he can cite the little-known Hostage Act
of 1868, by which Congress actually required the president to
use force if necessary to free Americans held by foreign
governments.</p>
<p>Building a political consensus with Congress is only part
of the battle. Mr. Sofaer also worries about international
law, especially now that the United Nations has gotten so
involved. "The test is not, are we going to convince the U.N.
finally to do the right thing," Mr. Sofaer said. "The test
is, are we going to win?"</p>
<p>He noted that the U.N. Charter allows countries to use
collective self-defense, which "gives us plenty of legal
authority to do what we want to restore the sovereignty of
Kuwait." But there is a problem. The charter seems only to
allow collective self-defense until the U.N. itself takes
action. The U.N. has now passed a resolution, though only to
allow possibly weak implementation of a blockade of Iraq.</p>
<p>"The resolution subjects military actions to the review of
the Security Council, almost as though we had to check with
the U.N. before using force," Mr. Sofaer said. "By
implication, the U.N. has adopted the means that we cannot go
beyond. We must say, no, we will use necessary and
proportionate force." Unlike Congress, there's little the
U.N. can do to stop Mr. Bush.</p>
<p>As always, a president has more to worry about than a
Saddam Hussein. A report on the American system was neatly
summed up in a recent London Daily Telegraph headline, "Bush
Stands Tall -- But for How Long?" above a report warning that
"Congress has two months before it will vote on extending the
president's war powers." Now that Mr. Bush has managed to
unite the world against Saddam, he might even be up to the
task of getting and keeping Congress on board.</p>
