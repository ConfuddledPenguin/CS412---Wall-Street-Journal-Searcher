	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Labor Department is expected to begin
inspecting large petrochemical plants this week, as part of
an effort to prevent catastrophic chemical-plant explosions.
   The department's Occupational Safety and Health
Administration said the new program will affect petrochemical
companies with more than 2,500 workers. The inspections will
cover oil refining and the manufacture of plastics and
synthetic resins, synthetic rubber, cellulosic and other
man-made fibers, and certain industrial organic chemicals,
OSHA said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The safety inspection program was spurred by recent
chemical-industry explosions, including those at a Phillips
Petroleum Co. plastics complex near Houston last October and
one at an Arco Chemical Co. plant in Channelview, Texas, last
month. Arco Chemical is a unit of Atlantic Richfield Co.</p>
<p>Those explosions killed 40 workers and injured many
others.</p>
<p>OSHA said its safety investigators have concluded, among
other things, that their regular inspection program isn't
geared to stopping the infrequent but disastrous explosions
that can occur at chemical facilities. Many of the plants
singled out for the special inspections generally wouldn't be
visited, said Susan Fleming, an OSHA spokeswoman, because the
industry's overall injury rate is relatively low. "There are
other, more dangerous places," she said.</p>
<p>But when the department sent a report to President Bush in
April on the Phillips explosions last fall, it said that OSHA
would "revise its current system for setting agency
priorities," to include assessing the risk of "catastrophic
events" at chemical plants. Ms. Fleming said that meant "more
intensive" inspections in order to examine the plants'
processing methods for highly hazardous chemicals.</p>
<p>Each inspection will cover the entire plant and include an
"in-depth" look at one process unit, Gerard Scannell, head of
OSHA, said.</p>
<p>OSHA has been criticized for doing low-level chemical
inspections. Two months before the Phillips' explosions, an
accident at the same plant killed one worker and seriously
injured two others. After the accident, OSHA didn't do a
complete inspection; the last full inspection prior to the
October 1989 explosions was in 1974.</p>
<p>After the August 1989 accident, OSHA fined Phillips only
$720. In April of this year, after making a full inspection
in October, OSHA proposed fines of $5.7 million against
Phillips, alleging willful safety violations in connection
with the Houston explosions. The company is contesting the
fines.</p>
<p>The department has begun an inspection of the Arco plant,
but no fines have yet been proposed.</p>
<p>Last month, on the heels of the Arco explosion, OSHA
formally proposed rules to require chemical-plant managers
and others to adopt rigorous safety programs. This includes
using a more thorough method for identifying, judging and
controlling chemical processes. It also includes such steps
as evaluating plant valves for safety hazards, keeping
equipment in good shape, and properly training company and
contract workers.</p>
