	<p class="article-leader">FRANKFURT, West Germany -- The Bundesbank confirmed that
it plans to reorganize its seven-member directorate, the
inner circle of policy makers responsible for running the
West German central bank's day-to-day business.
   The changes, which require directorate approval, include
shifting Bundesbank Vice President Helmut Schlesinger to head
the board's credit policy section, which is becoming
increasingly important, as German markets brace for
potentially high borrowing required to finance unification
with East Germany.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Schlesinger, 65 years old, heads the Bundesbank's
section for national economic research, but these
responsibilities are expected to be assumed by Otmar Issing,
a 54-year-old economics professor from the university in
Wuerzburg. Mr. Issing, a member of the government's Council
of Economic Advisers and a monetary policy authority, will
fill a board vacancy when Claus Koehler returns to academic
life Sept. 30.</p>
<p>The economic research committee head is responsible for
monitoring the nation's economy and writing the Bundesbank's
monthly reports and all other economic research. The credit
committee oversees capital markets, money markets and other
financial markets. If the changes are approved, Mr. Issing
will be responsible for monitoring German economic and
political unification.</p>
