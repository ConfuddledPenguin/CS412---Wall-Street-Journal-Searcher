	<p class="article-leader">Manville Corp. said it acquired the assets of Visypack
Pty., a producer of lithographic folding cartons in
Australia, from Pratt Group, Melbourne, Australia. Manville
Forest Products Corp., a unit of Manville, will operate the
unit.
   A spokeswoman declined to give terms or details. Visypack
had 1989 sales of about US$140 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Manville said its debt covenants required that the company
reinvest proceeds from the sale of its refractory ceramic
fiber business in foreign operations. Manville sold the
refractory fiber business to Morgan Crucible Co. in June.
Terms weren't disclosed, but the company reported a
second-quarter gain of about $20 million from the sale.</p>
<p>Visypack is the first major acquisition Manville has made
since the company became embroiled in debate over the funding
of the Manville Personal Injury Trust. It indicates that the
company will proceed with its plans to grow by acquisition
and capital improvements.</p>
<p>The trust, which was set up to pay the company's
asbestos-related health claims after Manville emerged from
bankruptcy-law protection in 1988, has run short of cash.
Some plaintiffs' attorneys have suggested that instead of
employing its $1 billion of cash and unused credit lines to
expand its businesses, Manville should give some of the money
to the trust as a prepayment of its obligations.</p>
<p>Company officials have argued that the company's growth
and vitality are in the long-term interest of the trust --
which owns about 80% of Manville's stock on a fully diluted
basis -- and its beneficiaries. That growth would be stymied,
Manville executives argue, if the company's assets are used
to pay off trust obligations early rather than build
operating units.</p>
<p>Visypack, a dominant carton maker in Australia, adds to
the company's growing portfolio of overseas paper products
operations. Manville acquired DRG Cartons Ltd. of Bristol,
England, in April and Fiskeby Board AB of Norrkoping, Sweden,
in June. The company also owns two paper mills and three
container plants in Brazil.</p>
