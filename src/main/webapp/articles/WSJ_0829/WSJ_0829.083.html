	<p class="article-leader">The Clean Air Act, once thought to be a sure thing, may
have a big problem: the bottom line. As Members of Congress
plow through its hundreds of pages, many are becoming worried
over its impact on the economy. When as part of the budget
negotiations, the idea for a 5% energy tax floated out of the
budget summit, Rep. John Dingell, co-chairman of the
conference committee, quickly told negotiators the Clean Air
Act already represented a hefty tax on energy.
   The Bush Administration also has begun to recognize the
costs that the Clean Air Act would impose on the economy.
Last month, Michael Boskin, chairman of President Bush's
Council of Economic Advisers, responded to congressional
questions about claims from the Environmental Protection
Agency that the act would have little adverse job impact.
"The President's support for this proposal was not premised
on the view that its costs would be negligible. He is fully
aware they may result in temporary unemployment," he wrote.
"Rather, the President believes that our nation is able and
should be willing to pay a reasonable price to clean its air.
But the President is not prepared to see American firms,
workers and consumers overcharged or to see economic growth
needlessly slowed."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It is now clear that is precisely what the Clean Air Act
will do. A single provision requiring the use of gasoline and
alcohol blends in 25% of the country will add 15 cents to 25
cents a gallon to the price of gasoline. A study by Tom
Austin, a former executive officer of the California Air
Resources Board, concludes that the reformulated fuel will be
15% less fuel-efficient and could actually increase
nitrogen-oxide emissions. "Motorists would end up paying more
for dirtier air," he says. A study by Resources for the
Future, a leading environmental group, also questions the use
of alternative fuels. It estimates that reducing emissions
through methanol use could cost $31,000 to $66,000 a ton.</p>
<p>Other provisions of the Clean Air Act make just as little
economic sense. Its crash program of installing limestone
scrubbers on old power plants to reduce acid rain will have
the perverse effect of delaying the installation of clean
coal technology. The bill will divert at least $50 billion in
capital to install a 20-year-old technology and add to
pollution by leaving behind tons of limestone sludge a year.</p>
<p>After studying what the congressional process did to the
President's proposal to create a system of tradable emissions
permits to reduce acid rain, analysts at Washington
University concluded that "the Senate has created a Rube
Goldberg scheme for distributing emissions allowances." Both
House and Senate versions have eviscerated the intended
savings from a tradable-permits system.</p>
<p>The Clean Air Act's fast phase-out of chlorofluorocarbons
uses the most tentative of scientific research on ozone
depletion to justify a dramatic increase in air-conditioning
and refrigeration costs. The likely substitute for the most
popular banned refrigerant costs 30 times as much and will
itself be banned by the year 2015. The economy will have to
shoulder at least $10 billion to $15 billion a year in added
refrigeration costs by the year 2000.</p>
<p>Members of Congress tell us privately that the Clean Air
Act was rushed to passage because no one wanted to publicly
oppose any bill with the words "clean air" in it. The Bush
Administration was then rolled in private negotiations with
environmental extremists, and then backed off from its
threats to veto an outrageous bill. These are hardly excuses
for enacting a public policy that drapes significant
financial weights on an economy trying to compete globally.</p>
