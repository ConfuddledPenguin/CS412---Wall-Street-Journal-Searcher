	<p class="article-leader">The New Age, '80s-something, salad-eating, sensitive guy
is dead. Long live the bimbo, male and female.
   The proof? Take a look at two new magazines for men
hitting the newsstands next week. They are part of this
summer's dizzying Invasion of the Men's Magazines. Think
ESPN, guns, bikinis and high-priced stereo equipment. Guy
stuff.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Magazine publishers couldn't have picked a worse time to
bring to life their visions of magazines for men. Magazine
circulation is eroding, and national advertisers are being
stingy with already constricted ad budgets. Advertisers
didn't ask for new magazines for men; many feel men get what
they need from skin, car and sports books. Some cynics think
the new men's magazines are simply a way of whistling past
the graveyard.</p>
<p>From Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. comes Men's Life, billed
as a "one-stop read for men leading real lives," says Barry
Golson, editor of Men's Life and a former editor at Playboy
magazine. "Magazines have been generally edited in a very
highfalutin way. There's a universe of regular guys out there
who will relate to a magazine that is friendly and
accessible."</p>
<p>In the premier issue that hits newsstands nationwide Sept.
4, Men's Life wastes no time getting "real." There's a look
inside the terrorist gang of Abu Nidal, a profile of major
league baseball pitcher Dennis Eckersley, a story on why men
love blondes, a photo essay on five sultry TV actresses and
an "investigative report" on whether bikinis are getting too
small. There's even a broadside aimed at the "Sensitive Man."
"It's a fraud," writes contributing editor Mike Kelly. "I
don't even know any women who want to know New {read:
Sensitive} Men." Now they tell us.</p>
<p>From Fairchild Publications Inc., a unit of Capital
Cities/ABC Inc., comes M Inc. Not strictly a new magazine, M
Inc. is the product of grafting together the defunct
Manhattan inc. with Fairchild's M magazine.</p>
<p>Manhattan inc. loved power people and heralded the
boom-time 1980s of New York; M loved submarine commanders,
jet pilots, Kennedy Democrats, Bush Republicans and blood
sports. Reconstituted as a fashion/business/life style
magazine, M Inc. is still not for salad-eaters, and it may be
the unexpected hit.</p>
<p>Combining the long, thorough journalism of Manhattan inc.
and the playful spirit of the old M, M Inc. casts an
upperclass eye on the hearty appetites of men. There's a
story on the joys of sporting clays (the European version of
skeet shooting) and the super-fast Callaway Corvette. M
Inc.'s list of the "Power Brokers" includes the usual
suspects, but has some fun, referring to S.I. Newhouse as
"Lord High Executioner" and including New York political
provocateur Al Sharpton.</p>
<p>Advertisers may not have clamored for the Invasion of
Men's Magazines, but they're getting it anyway. Conde Nast
Publications Inc. has unveiled a jazzy remake of the night
club magazine Details for young men, Norris Publishing is
planning to publish Men magazine beginning in early 1991, and
an as-yet-unnamed title from Rolling Stone publisher Jan
Wenner is on the drawing board. Don't forget launches of
recent years, Rodale Press's Men's Health and New American
Magazine Co.'s Smart.</p>
<p>Despite the rush, the advertising outlook couldn't be more
dismal. Core advertisers in men's magazines, primarily
automobiles, tobacco, liquor, menswear and consumer
electronics, have slashed or restricted their ad budgets for
magazines. Ad pages are down for the first half of 1990 at
Sports Illustrated, Gentlemen's Quarterly, Playboy, even
Popular Mechanics and Sports Afield.</p>
<p>Both Men's Life and M Inc. have had some good news on this
front. Men's Life had an unimpressive 30 ad pages in the
first issue -- especially since new magazines regularly offer
advertisers bargain rates -- but it has snagged hard-to-get
ad commitments from the three major tobacco companies. M Inc.
did have an impressive start, a 316-page issue with 155 ad
pages, and while entertaining, its hybrid style could be
confusing to advertisers.</p>
<p>The most important hurdle will be finding and keeping
readers, a difficult task in any climate. Magazines must now
spend millions they often don't recover to build a subscriber
base. As for single-copy sales, the thinking goes that men
buy disposable razors at checkout stands and newspapers at
newsstands, but never enough magazines. Statistics prove
women are still the heaviest buyers of magazines.</p>
<p>An Audit Bureau of Circulations report released earlier
this month made clear that single-copy sales -- mostly made
at supermarket checkouts, newsstands, convenience and drug
stores -- were falling steadily. Excluding Playboy and
Penthouse, all of the 20 top-selling magazines on newsstands
in 1989 were women's fashion or service magazines, or ones
that could claim a heavy female readership.</p>
<p>"I don't see anything that shows men are buying more
magazines at newsstands," says Dan Capell, publisher of
Capell's Circulation Report, an industry newsletter. "Go into
any supermarket, I defy you to find a male title in any of
those checkout racks."</p>
<p>Whether or not the new crop of men's magazines survives,
the category itself has taken a new turn. Lee Eisenberg, as
editor of Hearst Corp.'s Esquire, helped define the New Man
of the 1980s. Now, as he leaves to edit the British Esquire,
he sees another change.</p>
<p>"The man we gave voice to {in the 1980s} was one who was
still working things out," says Mr. Eisenberg. "What's
happened now is not that we have become throwbacks to our
father's generation, but that the questions have been
answered. We know how to express our masculinity."</p>

<p>Vacation Viewers</p>
<p>In its latest attempt to show that more people watch
television than A.C. Nielsen counts, ABC yesterday said a
survey it commissioned shows most Americans watch TV while on
vacation.</p>
<p>ABC said the study, conducted by Bruskin Associates, found
that nearly eight out of 10 vacationers, or an estimated 62
million adults, watch TV. Some watch as much as three hours a
day on vacation, the network said.</p>
<p>The study is the latest in a series of network surveys
showing that large numbers of people watch TV away from home,
in such settings as bars and college campuses. Figures from
Nielsen, which only tracks viewing at home, indicate viewers
have been leaving network TV in droves.</p>
