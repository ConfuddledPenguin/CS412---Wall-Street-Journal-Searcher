	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- American Telephone & Telegraph Co. will
provide long-distance service for pay phones at all
facilities operated by New York state's Metropolitan Transit
Authority under a three-year contract valued at about $25.2
million.
   The telecommunications giant said that US Sprint
Communications Co., an 80%-owned subsidiary of United
Telecommunications Inc., Westwood, Kan., previously had
provided such service for most pay phones under a one-year
deal with the agency.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>MTA oversees the New York City Transit Authority's subways
and buses, the Long Island Rail Road, the Metro-North
commuter railroad, the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel
Authority, and the Metropolitan Suburban Bus Authority, which
operates buses in Nassau County on Long Island.</p>
<p>A spokesman for US Sprint said, "The public-phone market
is an extremely competitive environment. While we were
unsuccessful in this particular case, we have enjoyed
tremendous success in that marketplace and will continue to
bid for business such as the MTA's."</p>
