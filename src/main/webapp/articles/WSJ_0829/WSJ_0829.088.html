	<p class="article-leader">HARTSVILLE, S.C. -- Sonoco Products Co. said it is taking
several steps, including selling its interest in a joint
venture for $60 million, to streamline its operations.
   The actions, according to the maker of packaging products,
will result in a one-time charge against third-quarter
earnings and a probable gain in the fourth quarter.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sonoco said a planned restructuring of several operations
is expected to result in a charge against third-quarter
earnings of $50 million to $55 million, or $1.14 to $1.25 a
share after taxes. In the 1989 third quarter, Sonoco had net
income of $25.8 million, or 59 cents a share, on revenue of
$402.5 million.</p>
<p>The company also said it agreed to sell its 40% interest
in Sonoco Graham Co., a manufacturer of plastic bottles and a
joint venture with closely held Graham Co., York, Pa., to the
other partners in the venture for $60 million. The sale is
contingent on the buyers obtaining financing and approval of
Graham's board. The sale is expected to result in an
after-tax gain in the fourth quarter of $22 million to $25
million, or 50 to 57 cents a share. In the 1989 fourth
quarter, Sonoco had net of $24.7 million, or 56 cents a
share, on revenue of $404.7 million.</p>
<p>Sonoco said the cash from these moves will be used to pay
some debt and to purchase as many as 1.5 million shares, or
3.5%, of the company's common.</p>
<p>R.C. King Jr., president and chief operating officer of
Sonoco, said that although some of the actions will have a
short-term negative impact on earnings, "they will provide us
with a more focused company to serve our growing customer
base."</p>
