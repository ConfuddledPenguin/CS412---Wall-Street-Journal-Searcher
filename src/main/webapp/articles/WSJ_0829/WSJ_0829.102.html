	<p class="article-leader">CLEVELAND -- AmeriTrust Corp., reeling from bad loans,
named a director as its interim chairman and chief executive
officer while it undergoes a restructuring.
   Jerry V. Jarrett, who has headed AmeriTrust since 1983,
was replaced by Craig R. Smith, a former machine-tool
executive and an AmeriTrust director since 1980.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The announcement comes two weeks after the bank holding
company, which had a first-half loss of $33.2 million, said
it would cut 780 jobs, or 11.5% of its work force.</p>
<p>Mr. Jarrett, 58, in recent years had moved into such
high-risk areas as providing financing for leveraged
buy-outs.</p>
<p>Mr. Smith, 65, is chairman of a special AmeriTrust board
committee established this year to focus on credit-quality
concerns. He is a former chairman and chief executive of
Warner & Swasey Co., an old-line Cleveland machine-tool
concern now owned by Cross & Trecker Corp., Bloomfield Hills,
Mich.</p>
<p>James D. Rode, 42, president of AmeriTrust and its lead
bank, AmeriTrust Co., will serve as chief operating officer
of the holding company and will succeed Mr. Jarrett as
chairman and chief executive of the bank.</p>
<p>AmeriTrust made a first-quarter provision for possible
loan losses of $120 million after an examination by federal
regulators. It also announced a $20.9 million loan-loss
provision in the second quarter, nearly double the $10.5
million provision of a year earlier.</p>
<p>Nonperforming assets as of June 30 totaled $262.4 million,
or 3.15% of loans and real estate holdings, up from $157.4
million, or 1.98%, a year earlier. The nonperforming loan
ratio "isn't all that bad" compared with some other banks,
Mr. Smith said in a telephone interview. "But this is a
conservative bank."</p>
<p>In national over-the-counter trading, AmeriTrust rose 50
cents to $14.125, less than half its 52-week high of $29.</p>
<p>Mr. Smith said the board hasn't set a timetable for
selecting a permanent chief executive. He said he may serve
as briefly as six months or as long as two years or more. He
added that it's possible Mr. Rode will succeed him, but the
board hasn't made any decision and hasn't hired a consulting
firm to seek other candidates.</p>
<p>Along with the management changes, AmeriTrust has said it
plans a more conservative strategy, focusing on consumer
banking, trust and investment management, and lending to
small and medium-sized companies in the Midwest.</p>
<p>The bank holding company's cost-cutting program is
expected to reduce expenses by $28 million in 1991 and $32
million in 1992, AmeriTrust said. However, it said those
moves will result in a restructuring charge of between $14
million and $18 million in the current quarter.</p>
<p>AmeriTrust, which once was called Cleveland Trust Co., was
until recently the city's leading bank. It had a strong
position with most of the large companies headquartered in
northeast Ohio. However, it was less aggressive than other
major Ohio banks in making acquisitions, and its $11 billion
of assets are now less than half the $23 billion of National
City Corp., Cleveland's largest bank.</p>
