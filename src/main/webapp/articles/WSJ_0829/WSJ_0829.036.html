	<p class="article-leader">DES PLAINES, Ill. -- DeSoto Inc. said it sold its
thickener business to a unit of Union Carbide Corp. Terms
weren't disclosed.
   DeSoto, a maker of paints, chemicals and detergents,
announced plans in July to sell operations accounting for
more than 80% of its sales in response to a court order to
"maximize shareholder value."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The sale of the business, which modifies the flow
characteristics of water-based products such as paint and
adhesives, is the latest in a series of agreements that
represent a near-total liquidation, with proceeds to be
distributed to shareholders. DeSoto plans to retain only its
detergent business.</p>
