	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Norman Lear's 80%-owned ACT III
Communications Inc. said Thomas B. McGrath, its president and
chief operating officer, will leave the entertainment concern
to pursue new career opportunities.
   Hal Gaba, a 44-year-old partner in HR Broadcasting, a
closely held Beverly Hills, Calif., owner and operator of
independent television stations, will succeed Mr. McGrath,
35, in both posts. Mr. Gaba was formerly vice chairman of Hal
Roach Studios and president of Embassy Pay-TV, a division of
Embassy Communications, of which Mr. Lear is part owner. Mr.
Lear remains chairman and chief executive of ACT III.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The executive change reflects a shift in ACT III's
strategy, say individuals close to the company. When Mr. Lear
started the company five years ago, he began with a pot of
money from the profits of his successful television career;
otherwise it was a blank slate. Driven by Mr. McGrath's
skills as a dealmaker, ACT III made a number of major
acquisitions in television stations, movie theaters and trade
publishing. The company's fourth area is entertainment.</p>
<p>But as the dealmaking fever of the 1980s has waned, the
company wants to concentrate on expanding and managing its
existing lines of business rather than buying into new areas,
these individuals say. And Mr. Gaba is an administrator who
will be charged with reversing the troubled fortunes of the
publishing unit, controlling the debt load taken on during
the acquisitions and running the company while Mr. Lear
concentrates on producing television shows.</p>
<p>Mr. McGrath couldn't immediately be reached for comment.</p>
