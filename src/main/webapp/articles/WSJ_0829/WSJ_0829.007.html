	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A tax credit for alternative energy
investments is on a list of proposals being considered at the
White House for reducing the nation's dependence on imported
oil.
   The administration hasn't yet decided whether to endorse
this or other proposals on the list, which was produced by
the Energy Department and is circulating among other
agencies. A package could be unveiled as early as next week.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The proposals are more substantive -- and controversial --
than a set of steps the department announced earlier this
month following the disruption of Mideast oil imports. That
plan, which called for such measures as putting more air in
automobile tires and increasing car-pooling, was essentially
ignored by the White House and roundly dismissed as
inadequate by conservation groups.</p>
<p>The latest proposals include renewing the administration's
push to persuade Congress to open up the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge in Alaska for oil exploration and urging
consumers to use gasoline with lower octane ratings. The
administration also apparently plans to report progress in
mediating a California environmental dispute that is blocking
the production of 200 million to 300 million barrels of oil.</p>
<p>In addition, the administration has said it will repropose
various tax incentives for oil drilling that were included in
its budget proposal last January. These include changes that
would reduce the burden of the alternative minimum tax on
producers.</p>
<p>Such incentives, while strongly supported in the oil
industry, would face an uphill battle in this time of
swelling budget deficits. The tax changes aimed at the
industry in the budget were estimated to cost $300 million in
the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.</p>
<p>And while an alternative-energy tax credit could help make
any package more acceptable to environmental groups, it's
certain to draw fire from tax experts who contend that such
measures typically don't spur enough additional investment to
warrant their steep budgetary cost.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, fears that the Mideast situation would lead to
a renewed push on the Alaska wilderness have already touched
off vigorous lobbying by environmental groups. The oil
industry, for its part, is likely to oppose steps to reduce
sales of its lucrative high-octane fuels, although Ed
Rothschild, head of a Washington lobbying group on consumer
and labor issues, contended that reducing the average octane
level of all U.S. gasoline by a single point would save
140,000 barrels of oil a day. Octane measures the anti-knock
capacity of gasoline.</p>
