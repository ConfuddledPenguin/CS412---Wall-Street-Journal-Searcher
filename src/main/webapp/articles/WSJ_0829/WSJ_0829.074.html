	<p class="article-leader">RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -- Confident that threats of imminent
Iraqi invasions have been neutralized, Saudi leaders want to
purchase about $9 billion of U.S. arms as part of a plan to
ensure their country's long-term security.
   Another element of the plan that is taking shape,
according to U.S. and Saudi officials, is to possibly create
a permanent international peace-keeping force in order to
deter Iraqi aggression in the future.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Details of the new strategy are still being debated among
top military and government officials here, though a senior
Saudi general described the broad goals of the initiative
during a news conference yesterday.</p>
<p>Lt. Gen. Khalid bin Sultan, commander of the Saudi-Arab
forces deployed nearest the Kuwaiti border, said the
long-term priority is "to make sure the security of Saudi
Arabia will be guaranteed now and into the future."</p>
<p>While he played down the likelihood of a permanent,
large-scale U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia, Gen.
Khalid stressed that his country "will have to have more
weapons to use" to avoid another such crisis. "There's lots
of discussion with the U.S. and other countries . . . about
how to strengthen our forces," he said, adding pointedly:
"The lesson is learned."</p>
<p>No matter how the crisis is resolved, some Saudi leaders
believe it is important to have at least a small tripwire of
Arab forces remaining in Saudi Arabia to ensure against Iraqi
aggression. But the size of such a proposed force and who
would command it are still under review, and the final
proposal may not be made for some time.</p>
<p>The Saudi wish list for weapons includes F-15 Eagle jet
fighters, M-1 tanks and Bradley armored vehicles, all
equipment that U.S. forces brought with them to defend the
kingdom. In fact, one Saudi official said, the U.S. probably
will be asked to sell a portion of the equipment already on
the ground here to avoid the cost and delay of shipping new
weapons from the U.S. to Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Saudi officials have been quietly urging Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney and other Bush administration officials to
approve major weapons sales quickly, although it isn't clear
whether the Saudis want the most sophisticated F-15e model
jet fighters or even whether any formal request for arms
sales has been given to the White House.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, congressional sources told the Associated Press
that the U.S. will sell nearly $3 billion in new weapons to
Saudi Arabia, including 24 F-15 fighter planes and 150 M-60
tanks. The sale is designed to strengthen Saudi defenses, and
further sales are possible, according to the sources.</p>
<p>The issue is bound to create friction with Israel, which
is concerned about the total size of the Saudi air force and
especially the long-range, precision ground attack
capabilities of the F-15e, which is built by McDonnell
Douglas Corp.</p>
<p>Without giving specifics, Gen. Khalid told reporters that
Saudi forces "are capable of handling any kind of weapon."</p>
<p>Before meeting with King Fahd last week, Secretary Cheney
said the U.S. wasn't considering selling F-15e fighters to
Saudi Arabia. But other Pentagon officials have suggested
that policy could change over the next few weeks or months if
the Saudis maintain they need the planes to protect their
country and free some U.S. forces to return home.</p>
<p>Eventually, the Saudi plan envisions that nearly all U.S.
troops will depart and that the country's 66,000-man armed
forces will increase sharply. Saudi Arabia currently spends
about one-third of its budget on its military.</p>
<p>Nearly a month after American forces began to arrive, the
U.S. and Saudi governments still haven't agreed on a
detailed, binding agreement spelling out the relationship
between their forces. Soldiers from Morocco, Egypt and
several other Arab and Islamic countries are under the direct
command of Gen. Khalid, but U.S. forces aren't.</p>
<p>To some extent, however, Saudi leaders such as Gen.
Khalid, a close relative of King Fahd, appear to be a
restraining influence on the U.S. military response to Iraq.
During the news conference, the general stressed that the
buildup of U.S. firepower was intended primarily to protect
Saudi oil reserves. "We are here to prevent war," he said. If
any offensive action against Iraq is launched from Saudi
soil, Gen. Khalid said, "I know for a fact it has to be
consulted between King Fahd and President Bush."</p>
<p>Even when Saudis step up their rhetoric against Iraq, they
often go out of their way to emphasize that diplomatic
efforts are on the front burner.</p>
<p>"I believe that Saddam Hussein will be destroyed unless he
comes to his senses," withdraws from Kuwait, and restores the
royal family to power, Gen. Khalid said in his first news
conference with Western reporters. But almost in the same
breath, he added: "We have to give the diplomats' efforts a
chance to work."</p>
