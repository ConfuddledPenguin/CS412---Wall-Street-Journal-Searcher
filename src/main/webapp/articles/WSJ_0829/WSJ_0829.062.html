	<p class="article-leader">MOSCOW -- Shortly before Iraqi troops swept into Kuwait
early this month, Saddam Hussein sent a message of assurance
to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev that Iraq wasn't about
to invade its Gulf neighbor, according to Arab diplomats in
Moscow.
   It was an outright lie that has caused deep consternation
in Moscow. Speaking to Soviet military officers last week,
Mr. Gorbachev sharply denounced Saddam Hussein's "betrayal of
trust" -- a charge frequently repeated by Soviet officials
and the media in their condemnation of the Iraqi attack.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The feeling of being grossly deceived by one of its
foremost Middle East allies has played an important role in
shaping Moscow's reaction to the crisis, particularly its
sanctioning of military force to implement the economic
embargo against Iraq. At the same time, Arab and Western
diplomats here say that Soviet indignation is tempered by a
strong desire to forge new alliances in the Middle East
without abandoning old friends.</p>
<p>Thus, as the U.S. uses its military muscle in an attempt
to drive Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait, the Soviets have
adopted a more cautious, even-handed position.</p>
<p>While happy to be cooperating with the U.S. in this
post-Cold War conflict, Moscow is also eager to be viewed in
the Middle East as an independent player. Rather than turning
its back on diplomacy, it is strongly encouraging efforts to
find a political solution to the crisis. And all the while,
it is looking to use the Iraqi invasion to boost its
influence in the Arab world.</p>
<p>"In a sense, they are trying to have good relations with
everyone," says one Arab ambassador in Moscow. "They're
keeping the door open."</p>
<p>Given such a policy, the Soviets are deeply reluctant to
become involved militarily in the Persian Gulf. Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze has said Moscow doesn't plan on
sending forces to implement the embargo. But he didn't rule
out joining a multilateral military force if the United
Nations agreed to dispatch one.</p>
<p>Some Westerners believe Moscow is so angry with Saddam
Hussein that it could be nudged into taking such action.
After meeting Messrs. Gorbachev and Shevardnadze over the
weekend, France's Foreign Minister Roland Dumas described
Soviet policy as one of taking "a few steps at a time." While
the Soviet president wants a peaceful settlement through firm
execution of U.N. resolutions and good coordination with Arab
nations, "he didn't rule out measures of coercion against
Iraq," Mr. Dumas told reporters.</p>
<p>The Iraqi invasion came at a critical time for Soviet
policy makers. For months, Moscow has made strenuous efforts
to improve its ties with moderate Arab nations such as Egypt
and Saudi Arabia. At the same time, it has been treating its
traditional, radical allies in the region -- Iraq, Libya,
Syria and the Palestine Liberation Organization -- more
coolly.</p>
<p>The latest Gulf crisis has brought this nascent policy
shift clearly into the open, and seems likely to give it a
big impetus. In the past few days, Moscow has hosted the
Egyptian foreign minister and a special envoy of Saudi
Arabia, with whom the Soviets don't have diplomatic
relations. The Saudi visit came only weeks after Moscow for
the first time allowed Soviet Moslem pilgrims to travel to
the holy city of Mecca.</p>
<p>Moreover, following the Iraqi invasion, the Soviet media
have resounded with strong criticism of past Kremlin policy
in the Middle East, particularly the practice of arming
unreliable dictators.</p>
<p>"Didn't we bind our hands by declaring `friendship and
cooperation'? Haven't we been too unscrupulous in the choice
of our friends?" asked Alexander Bovin, a foreign-policy
commentator in the government daily Izvestia last week. "In
general it would be sensible to review the list of countries
and people with whom the U.S.S.R. maintains privileged
relations."</p>
<p>Mr. Bovin said the Soviet leadership has long had
misgivings about Iraq's Mr. Hussein, particularly regarding
the rationale for his war with Iran. Nonetheless it continued
to provide Baghdad with huge amounts of military hardware.
Thanks to glasnost, or the policy of openness, the Soviets
have for the first time given the public -- and the Pentagon
-- a list of the weapons supplied.</p>
<p>According to a senior military official, Lt. Gen. Vladimir
Nikityuk, they include T-72 tanks, infantry fighting
vehicles, self-propelled 122mm and 152mm howitzers,
anti-aircraft missile systems, MiG-23 and MiG-29 fighter
planes, helicopters and equipment such as gas masks and
protective suits for use in chemical warfare. All this was
provided to the Iraqis under a 1972 treaty of friendship and
cooperation between the two nations.</p>
<p>With the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, these weapons weigh
heavily on the Soviet conscience. In explaining his support
for the U.N.-backed embargo, Mr. Gorbachev said that "it
would be unacceptable for us to react in any other way
because this aggression has been committed with the use of
arms that we agreed to sell to Iraq solely for the purposes
of defense, and not for the seizure of others' territory or
of entire countries."</p>
<p>Arab diplomats in Moscow say the Soviet leader's evident
embarrassment is likely to have an impact on Moscow's
relations with Libya, and possibly the Palestine Liberation
Organization. "Under perestroika, the Soviets don't want Arab
radicals jeopardizing their relations with the U.S.," says
one senior Arab official. "They're looking at their
traditional allies and asking what the support gets them
apart from a bad reputation."</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev is certainly acting as a man with a
grievance. Last Friday he gave Saddam Hussein just 90 minutes
to respond to a message ordering Iraq to respect U.N.
resolutions and pull out of Kuwait. When no reply came, the
Soviets voted in the U.N. Security Council to enforce the
embargo with military means.</p>
<p>Yet at the same time, Moscow seems unwilling to sever the
ties to Iraq and other allies. Mr. Shevardnadze gave Iraq's
deputy prime minister a careful hearing when he visited the
Soviet Union, though officials subsequently denied that there
had been a change of Soviet position. And even Mr. Gorbachev
is careful to say that his wrath is aimed at Saddam Hussein,
and not the Iraqi people.</p>
<p>"My colleagues and I are concerned that it is more
difficult to build a relationship with a country than to try
to break it up," Col. Valentin Ogurtsov, a senior Defense
Ministry official, told reporters. "It isn't easy for us to
move from full-fledged relations to zero."</p>
