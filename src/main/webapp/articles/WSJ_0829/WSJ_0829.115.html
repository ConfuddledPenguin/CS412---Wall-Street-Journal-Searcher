	<p class="article-leader">The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission confirmed an
Aug. 6 ruling that denied Northern States Power Co.'s request
for a $120.8 million electricity rate increase.
   The order makes official the panel's earlier finding that
the Minneapolis utility hadn't proven its need for the
increase.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The commission said it has ordered the utility to refund
to customers the additional revenue it has been collecting
under a 6.9% interim rate increase the state PUC authorized
in January.</p>
<p>The commission said it had concluded that "NSP's overall
budgeting process is seriously deficient in accuracy and
credibility. Specifically, serious problems were found in the
capital budgets and the department operating budgets."</p>
<p>The commission said it had "grave doubts about the
accuracy, reliability, and predictive value" of the data
submitted by Northern States.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Northern States said the company was
"disappointed" with the action and that it plans to file for
reconsideration within the next 20 days. He added that, if
the ruling stands, "we will work hard to do what's necessary
to change our budgeting and filing process to support future
rate needs."</p>
