	<p class="article-leader">For real estate brokers in the Northeast, the mid-'80s
seem a long time gone.
   "I called it the Reebok era, because all you needed was a
pair of Reeboks and a pen," says Richard DeWolfe, a
Lexington, Mass., broker who operates a string of 25 sales
offices in eastern Massachusetts and New Hampshire. "Whoever
got to the customer fastest got the commission."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>These days, a pair of good hiking boots with crampons
might do better. The pitfalls of a soft market are testing
brokers' inventiveness and stretching their work hours.</p>
<p>Thousands of brokers have just given up. In the past year
alone, the membership in the Connecticut Association of
Realtors has dropped 12%; in Massachusetts, 11%; and in New
Jersey, almost 10%. New York membership is off 7% since
January.</p>
<p>In no other region did the market grow so rapidly or drop
so abruptly. In 1986, at the height of the Northeastern real
estate boom, 703,000 single-family homes were sold in the
region encompassing New England, New York, New Jersey, and
Pennsylvania, double the volume in 1981. But by 1989, the
volume had slipped to 589,000. This year, it has continued to
fall.</p>
<p>Because real estate agents typically earn half of the 6%
sales commission their concerns charge buyers, a plunge in
sales can be devastating. To survive in today's market,
agents have to reconcile themselves to a new and unassailable
truth: The buyer is king.</p>
<p>The surviving agents wrestle with multiple listings books
that are thicker than the Manhattan telephone directory. And
the ones who wait for their phones to ring get nowhere.</p>
<p>"There's a significant change in the work ethic," concedes
Mr. DeWolfe, the Lexington, Mass., broker.</p>
<p>Deborah Loban of Stratford, Conn., became an agent in 1987
after spending 17 years raising a family. During her first
year, she worked 15 to 20 hours a week and sold 11 houses.
"It did seem very easy, it really did," she says. This year,
she is working two or three times the hours. But she has made
only four sales.</p>
<p>As part of Ms. Loban's new world, she must deal with
buyers who think not merely that they are kings but emperors.
"The few good buyers we have out there feel that no matter
what the house is marketed at, they can come in with a
low-ball offer," says Ms. Loban. She says she recently
received a $100,000 offer for a property she listed at
$190,000, which she flatly rejected.</p>
<p>Ms. Loban, like many other brokers, has grown accustomed
to shaving a point or so off her commission to satisfy
hard-bargaining buyers.</p>
<p>Times are harder in Hillsdale, N.J., too, where broker
Peter Sobeck had to take a new hard line. One agent who
joined his office during the boom made seven sales in six
months, netting her about $20,000. "But it was all stuff that
came to her via my office," he says. "When that dried up, she
wasn't doing any business." Mr. Sobeck says he tried to teach
her to drum up her own business. "But she really fell flat on
her face. So we fired her," he says.</p>
<p>Placing blind calls isn't entirely futile, insists Mr.
Sobeck, who guesses that one out of 40 or 50 calls turns up a
lead. The object isn't necessarily to reach a potential
buyer, but to hit on a gossipy source who can report on the
comings and goings of the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Some agents engage in "farming," or targeting a
neighborhood and establishing themselves as its real estate
expert. This can involve such humbling tasks as going
door-to-door-introducing themselves and sometimes handing out
novelty gifts -- and then following up with mailings.</p>
<p>Micki Rosenbloom mails a quarterly publication titled
"Great Possibilities" to homeowners in the area she farms in
Maplewood, N.J. It includes articles on preparing your home
for the winter and VCR maintenance. "Truthfully, it's just to
get my name out," she concedes. She follows the mailings with
phone calls.</p>
<p>About a year ago, she also started posting her name on the
"For Sale" signs she stakes in the lawns of her customers.
That way, the sales commission won't go to just anyone who
picks up the phone at Burgdorff Realtors, her brokerage firm.</p>
<p>Joan Dirken, another agent at Burgdorff's Maplewood
office, has begun posting sales prices on the lawns of homes
that she deems a bargain. The purpose: It answers the first
question that any interested buyer would have, and it
eliminates calls from people "whose eyes are bigger than
their pocketbooks."</p>
<p>Such an approach is considered a touch uncouth at
Burgdorff's office in the posh community of Short Hills, N.J.
"Our feeling is that the neighborhood people wouldn't like
it," says agent Kathy Adams. "They wouldn't want that kind of
information disseminated. They would look at it as too
commercial."</p>
<p>In Plymouth, Mass., the search for buyers has led Bay
Colony Realty World to the mecca of community shoppers,
mammoth Independence Mall. Last fall the brokerage opened an
indoor kiosk outside Filene's Basement, a popular off-price
clothing chain. Agents man the desk 12 hours a day, hoping
that buyers might be lured by the kiosk's "Realscope Board,"
a 16-by-24-foot wall papered with 8-by-10-inch glossies of
almost 90 properties.</p>
<p>The frustration isn't over once an agent gets a potential
buyer into his or her car. "It's brutal. You're driving
people around to house after house," said one suburban Boston
broker who shut his brokerage firm for good this month and
who asked that his name not be used. "You're burning more gas
than ever before. Then they just say, `We're going to wait a
little.'"</p>
<p>Brokers also mine local newspapers for leads in new
employment announcements, birth notices and even death
notices. The latter must be handled delicately, concedes one
broker, perhaps in the form of a subtle feeler to an
acquaintance of the widow or widower.</p>
<p>Then there are the sellers who refuse to take off their
rose-colored glasses. Many won't admit how little their
properties are worth now.</p>
<p>Today, brokers spend more time measuring sellers' motives,
then sternly lecturing them about the new realities. They
refuse to list homes at unrealistically high prices. "I've
never heard brokers say the things I hear them saying now,"
says the Boston-area broker. "Things like: `I won't waste my
time advertising at that price for that turkey.'"</p>
<p>But some sellers, acutely aware of how the gloomy market
is affecting agents, are offering rewards to the brokers who
can hustle them up a buyer. A homeowner in South Orange,
N.J., is offering two first-class tickets to Europe to the
agent who can move his house at $500,000.</p>
<p>The good times may be a long time gone, but the song goes
on to say that the darkest hour is just before the dawn, and
some brokers point out that while sales volume continues to
fall, it's not falling as fast as it was.</p>
<p>"The bright light that we all look to is Houston," says
one broker. "People say, `Gee, Houston's coming back. Maybe
there's hope for us.' But others say, `I can't wait four or
five years,' and get out of the business."</p>
