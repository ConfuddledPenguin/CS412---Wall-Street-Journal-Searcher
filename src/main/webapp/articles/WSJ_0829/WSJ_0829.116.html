	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Paramount Pictures Corp.'s former head of
marketing pleaded guilty to a tax-evasion charge in
connection with a scheme to extort kickbacks from vendors
doing business with the Paramount Communications Inc. unit.
   Gordon Weaver, 52 years old, of Los Angeles, was an
executive at Paramount from 1982 until 1984, when the company
requested he step down after an in-house investigation of the
alleged kickback scheme. At the time of his resignation, Mr.
Weaver was president of marketing for the motion picture
division. Mr. Weaver now runs his own marketing company,
Gordon Weaver Enterprises.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In federal court in Manhattan, Mr. Weaver pleaded guilty
to filing a false federal income tax return in 1983.</p>
<p>The kickbacks came from several motion-picture advertising
companies in New York, prosecutors said in the indictment of
Mr. Weaver. The kickbacks included cash, payments, gifts and
services, the U.S. charged. For instance, one vendor,
Filmland Inc. of New York, gave Mr. Weaver free use of a
summer home on Fire Island, N.Y., the indictment said.</p>
<p>Mr. Weaver's attorney, Robert Fink, couldn't be reached
for comment.</p>
<p>The U.S. Attorney's Office said Stephen Rose, formerly
senior vice president for marketing in the motion picture
division, pleaded guilty in June to filing a false 1983 tax
return in connection with the kickback scheme. Mr. Weaver and
Mr. Rose, of West Hempstead, N.Y., each face a maximum
sentence of three years and fines of as much as $10,000.</p>
