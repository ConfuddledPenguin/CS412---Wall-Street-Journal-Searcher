	<p class="article-leader">A national effort to resolve thousands of asbestos cases
appears to be unraveling, as questions are raised about the
jurisdiction of the federal judges overseeing the cases.
   A federal appeals court in Cincinnati this week harshly
reprimanded a U.S. district judge in Cleveland for attempting
to begin a national settlement of asbestos personal-injury
cases. Judge Thomas Lambros of Cleveland was one of two
federal judges who issued an order Aug. 10 setting forth
three avenues for resolving the asbestos cases.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The appeals court accused Judge Lambros of taking actions
that are beyond his jurisdiction and forbade him from holding
a hearing on a national class action. Under the Aug. 10
order, Judge Lambros was to head up efforts to reach a
voluntary settlement of many of the 90,000 asbestos cases now
clogging federal and state dockets.</p>
<p>Although the appeals court's ruling doesn't apply to the
other federal judges seeking a national resolution of the
cases, it has prompted some maneuvering to avoid the same
jurisdictional problems.</p>
<p>According to lawyers familiar with the asbestos
litigation, U.S. District Judge Robert Parker, chief judge of
the Eastern District of Texas and one of the judges involved
in the national settlement effort, has requested that U.S.
Chief Justice William Rehnquist designate at least one
federal judge to hear asbestos cases outside of his or her
jurisdiction. Judge Parker couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Such an appointment, however, wouldn't resolve other
questions about whether the courts can force through a
sweeping nationwide resolution of the cases. Because of the
diversity of the claims and the disparate financial resources
of the former asbestos makers, it's unclear whether a
national class action against all defendants would be upheld
by appellate courts.</p>
<p>As a result, a narrower approach to resolving the asbestos
litigation -- starting with a restucturing of the Manville
asbestos trust and later adding other defendants -- may stand
the best chance of surviving. That approach is being pursued
by U.S. Judge Jack B. Weinstein in Brooklyn. In the order
setting forth plans for a national resolution of the cases,
Judge Weinstein was assigned what appeared to be the least
ambitious approach to settling the cases: a class-action
against as many as six defendants with limited resources to
pay claims.</p>
<p>Attorneys familiar with the litigation said they expect
Judge Weinstein will combine the funds of a refinanced
Manville trust with funds from Eagle-Picher Industries Inc.,
so far the only defendant in the class action. The judge has
ordered the trust to restructure its financing, as well as
change the way it pays claims, by Sept. 6.</p>
<p>The trust's claims-processing system, once altered, could
also be used to pay claims for the class-action defendants.
The trust, which is independent of Manville Corp., was formed
to pay asbestos claims as part of the company's
bankruptcy-court reorganization.</p>
<p>"If any judge can fashion a solution to this nightmare {of
asbestos litigation}, it's Judge Weinstein," said Kenneth
Feinberg, an attorney who has been working as a special
master appointed by the judge to settle 500 asbestos cases in
New York, "He's going at his own pace, carefully every step
of the way."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Judge Parker is continuing to pursue plans for
a broader class action against all asbestos defendants, and
he has set a hearing for Sept. 14 in Beaumont, Texas. That
hearing will attempt to address many of the concerns about a
national resolution of the cases that Judge Lambros
previously had said he would hear in his court.</p>
<p>Some attorneys said they expect Judge Parker's efforts to
be rebuffed by a federal appeals court. "The outcome will be
determined by the judge's ability to fashion it in a way to
get around the objections of the appellate judges," said
Louis Robles, an asbestos plaintiffs' attorney in Miami.</p>
<p>Judges Parker, Weinstein and Lambros were not available
for comment.</p>

<p>ARTHUR YOUNG & CO. HIT  with $18.9 million verdict arising
from a scam.</p>
<p>The award by a Honolulu federal court jury arose from the
accounting firm's role in auditing the books of FP Industries
Inc., a syndicator of limited partnership interests in
decorative tropical plants. FPI raised an estimated $50
million from 4,000 investors nationwide, beginning in 1982.
It collapsed in 1987, prompting widespread allegations of
fraud that eventually resulted in jail sentences for some of
the promoters. Arthur Young is a predecessor firm of Ernst &
Young.</p>
<p>Investors had claimed in a lawsuit that Arthur Young,
which did audits for FPI in 1985 and 1986, had "knowingly
aided and abetted" the scam by failing to unearth evidence
that FPI and affiliated entities engaged in a so-called Ponzi
scheme by propping up older partnerships with money that it
took in from subsequent investors.</p>
<p>Richard Heimann, a San Francisco attorney for the
investors, said the jury found Arthur Young and Karl
Haushalter, one of its partners, liable on securities fraud
and other grounds. The award includes $10 million in punitive
damages, he said.</p>
<p>In New York, Ernst & Young said the firm was "as much a
victim of the events as were the plaintiffs" and said it
planned to appeal. "More than one witness testified that he
or she intentionally concealed critical information from the
firm which prevented Arthur Young from doing its job," the
firm stated.</p>
<p>Mr. Haushalter referred calls to his lawyers, who couldn't
immediately be reached.</p>

<p>TEMPLE UNIVERSITY LAUNCHES innovative legal ethics
program.</p>
<p>Funded by a $300,000 grant from the U.S. Department of
Education, the three-year pilot project integrates the study
of ethics, evidence and trial practice into a single yearlong
course taught in a courtroom environment.</p>
<p>Students who take the program will participate in four
mock trials. One is an attorney malpractice hearing. Another
is a negligence case that will raise ethical problems -- how
to deal with a client or witness who lies, for example. Many
law schools offer legal ethics courses, but they are usually
taught in a more traditional classroom setting.</p>
<p>Temple said that it is trying to meet criticisms that law
schools overemphasize legal theory and pay too little
attention to ethics and the real world. "This lets students
taste firsthand what it's like when your client says,
`Incidentially, I lied to you,'" said Edward D. Ohlbaum,
director of clinical education at Temple's law school. "These
kinds of issues don't exist in a vacuum."</p>

<p>C-SPAN TO TELEVISE marine's death penalty appeal.</p>
<p>The telecast of the hearing in the U.S. Court of Military
Appeals today is believed to be the first time that a federal
appellate argument has been televised live, officials at the
Cable-Satellite Public Affairs Network and the federal
military court said.</p>
<p>The military appeals court is the only federal court that
allows its proceedings to be televised.</p>
<p>The case before the court, U.S. vs. Curtis, is likely to
be precedent-setting. The constitutional question at issue
involves who can authorize the death penalty for military
personnel -- the president or Congress. If convicted murderer
Lance Corporal Ronnie Curtis wins his appeal, an executive
order that sets capital-punishment procedures for the
military would be voided.</p>
<p>The U.S. Judicial Conference will vote next month on
whether cameras should be allowed in some U.S. district and
federal appeals courts on an experimental basis.</p>

<p>A WELL-KNOWN PHILADELPHIA law firm has split up.</p>
<p>Edward Mannino left Elliott, Mannino & Flaherty to start
his own firm, taking seven of the firm's 120 lawyers with
him. His former partners John M. Elliott, Robert J. Bray and
Dennis J. Riley have formed a new firm, Elliot Bray & Riley.</p>
<p>Mr. Mannino, a well-known litigator and an expert in
banking and finance law, formed Edward Mannino & Associates.
Mr. Mannino had joined the law firm as a name partner in 1986
and helped make it one of the Philadelphia region's
best-known law firms.</p>
<p>Last May, name partner and former chairman Philip Baskin
left the law firm's Pittsburgh office with half its 32
lawyers to start a more local practice. Mr. Mannino said at
the time that the firm, with offices in Washington,
Pittsburgh, and Harrisburg, wanted to develop a more regional
practice.</p>
<p>Mr. Mannino, in his most recent move, said multicity law
firms cannot compete with national firms. He plans to develop
a smaller firm based in Philadelphia with a New Jersey
office. Elliott Bray & Riley is to have offices in
Philadelphia, Washington and Harrisburg.</p>
<p>James J. Flaherty, the last name partner at Elliott
Mannino, is opening his own firm in Pittsburgh.</p>
