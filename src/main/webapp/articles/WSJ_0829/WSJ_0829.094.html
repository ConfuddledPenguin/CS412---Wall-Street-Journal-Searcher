	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stock prices turned mixed as investors groped
for reasons to extend the rally of Friday and Monday.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 3.22 points in very
light trading to 2614.85. But the transportation and
utilities averages, along with Standard & Poor's 500-stock
index, finished lower.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Bond prices fell, also in light activity, with a rebound
in oil prices disappointing investors. The dollar was mixed,
as the yen continued to attract buyers.</p>
<p>"After two big up days," said Paul Hennessey, head of
equities trading at Boston Co., "the market responded pretty
well. The low volume indicates a lot of people are either
away or cautious, awaiting more certainty on the Mideast
situation or economic numbers." August's employment report,
due at the end of next week, offers an early sign of U.S.
economic strength after the Mideast upheaval began.</p>
<p>"There's reason for some encouragement" in yesterday's
stock activity, said Ken Knutel, equities strategist at
Kemper Financial Services, Chicago, "though not much because
there was no volume." However, he was encouraged that the
market remained placid despite the Bush administration's
saying there isn't any basis for negotiation with Iraq.</p>
<p>One wrinkle is that for the first time in nearly a month
some strategists are willing to discuss the direction of the
market in terms other than what happens next in the Mideast.
Before Iraq invaded Kuwait, for example, Steven Einhorn,
portfolio strategist at Goldman Sachs, was advising clients
to go easy on stock investments, and yesterday he urged
investors to resist the temptation to fish for bargains.</p>
<p>"If the relief rally should continue," Mr. Einhorn said,
"it would be a further opportunity to move away from the
market. Now is a time to raise cash into any rallies rather
than invest into them." Even without Iraq, he said, the
market lacks appeal for several reasons. He expects 1991
earnings will be flat, with a slight upturn in profits coming
no sooner than the 1991 third quarter.</p>
<p>Long-term U.S. Treasury bond prices fell a half point, or
$5 for each $1,000 of face amount. Yoneo Sakai, joint general
manager of treasury operations at Fuji Bank, cited the halt
in the decline of oil prices, which fell sharply Monday. The
October crude oil futures contract ended at $27.88 a barrel,
up 97 cents from Monday when it fell $4.</p>
<p>Currency trading also was light. David Gilmore, senior
foreign-exchange analyst at McCarthy, Crisanti & Maffei, said
the big move was the yen rallying against European currencies
and the dollar.</p>
<p>Besides softer oil prices, he said, the yen is deriving
strength from the expectation of an increase in a key
Japanese interest rate because of concerns about inflation, a
tight labor market and a promised rise in government
spending.</p>
<p>In major market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices were mixed on volume of 127.7 million shares
on the New York Stock Exchange, where advancing issues
outnumbered decliners, 837 to 664.</p>
<p>Bond prices fell. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond rose to 9.04%.</p>
<p>The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency rose to 1.5563 marks from 1.5510 Monday, and fell to
143.73 yen from 144.25 yen.</p>
