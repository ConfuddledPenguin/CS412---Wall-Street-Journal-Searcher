	<p class="article-leader">TCBY Enterprises Inc. said it expects to report that
earnings for the third quarter ending Aug. 31 fell to between
25 cents and 30 cents a share from 43 cents in the year-ago
period.
   TCBY, a Little Rock, Ark., franchiser of retail stores
that sell frozen yogurt, blamed the earnings decline on
same-store sales drops of about 15% in June and July. The
sales decline came because of increased competition, a
slowing economy and reduced franchise fee income, TCBY said.
The company said it has established new marketing and sales
programs designed to increase sales.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the six months ended May 31, TCBY had earnings of
about $12.9 million, or 48 cents a share, compared with $11.8
million, or 44 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.
Revenue rose 19% to $80.6 million from $67.8 million.</p>
