posted a 17% increase in retail-store sales for the quarter.</p>
<p>Abe Oberlin, chairman and president of the women's apparel
retailer and manufacturer, attributed the results to an
expanded product line and to cost-cutting efforts to simplify
manufacturing operations, slash inventories and dispose of
excess plant and equipment.</p>
