	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- In a reversal of Monday's strong rally, bonds
slid lower yesterday as potential buyers essentially
vanished.
   The benchmark 30-year bond, after surging more than 1 1/2
points on Monday, fell 1/2 point yesterday. The decline
translates into a loss of $5 for a bond with a $1,000 face
amount. The yield on the benchmark bond rose to 9.04% from
8.99% on Monday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But in a trend that reflects typically lackadaisical
summer trading, activity moved at a torpid pace with few
retail investors participating.</p>
<p>"It was a slow, quiet, boring day," said Steven Ricchuito,
chief economist at Barclays De Zoete Wedd Securities Inc.
With few investors bidding for bonds, dealers were forced to
mark prices lower.</p>
<p>Mr. Ricchuito said the bond market started off the trading
session in a now-familiar pattern: moving in the inverse
direction of oil prices. But later, even when some oil prices
fell, bonds failed to recover.</p>
<p>Petroleum prices ended mixed, with futures prices for
October crude at $27.88 a barrel, up 97 cents from Monday.
But November crude finished at $27.40, down 66 cents.</p>
<p>Bond prices also were pressured by rumors that the Bank of
Japan soon will raise the official discount rate. News
services in Tokyo reported that Japan's central bank is
considering raising the rate, which it charges members banks
for loans, by about 3/4 percentage point to 6%.</p>
<p>When interest rates rise in other countries, the value of
the dollar often falls. And a softer dollar, in turn, reduces
the value of securities denominated in dollars.</p>
<p>Not even the results of the Treasury's two-year note
auction managed to spark any excitement in the bond market.</p>
<p>The Treasury sold $11.56 billion of two-year notes at an
average yield of 8.19%. The yield was up from 8.07% at the
previous two-year note auction on July 25.</p>
<p>In when-issued trading activity, the new two-year notes
ended at a yield of 8.21%, a sign that dealers were forced to
cut prices slightly in an effort to drum up demand.</p>
<p>"It was a ho-hum auction," said Samuel Kahan, chief
economist at Fuji Securities Inc. He said the auction yield
came in where market participants had expected while the
auction technical indicators, such as the number of bids
received, were about average. Noncompetitive tenders, which
are placed mainly from individual investors, totaled $1.37
billion, a little below the recent average of $1.5 billion.</p>
<p>Today, the Treasury will sell $8.5 billion of five-year
notes. In when-issued trading, the notes were quoted late
yesterday to yield 8.615%.</p>
<p>Two economic reports are due out today, although analysts
say the reports won't have much impact on the bond market
unless the results are significantly different from market
estimates.</p>
<p>The July leading indicators index will be released at 8:30
a.m. EDT. A Dow Jones Capital Markets Report consensus of
economists expects the index to have declined 0.2% in the
month.</p>
<p>At 10 a.m., July new home sales data will be released. A
separate Dow Jones poll found that economists look for sales
to have declined 1.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
573,000.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>Treasurys were moderately lower yesterday in quiet
trading.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 96 30/32 to
yield 9.04% compared with Monday's price of 97 13/32 to yield
8.99%. The latest 10-year notes ended at a price of 98 26/32
to yield 8.91% compared with 99 4/32 to yield 8.86%.</p>
<p>Short-term rates were little changed. The discount rate on
three-month Treasury bills ended unchanged at 7.49% for a
bond-equivalent yield of 7.72%. The rate on six-month bills
ended slightly lower at 7.47% for a bond-equivalent yield of
7.85%.</p>
<p>Here are details of yesterday's two-year note auction:</p>
<p>Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.</p>

<p>

<p>The notes are dated Aug. 31, 1990, and mature Aug. 31,
1992.</p>
<p>Junk, Corporate Bonds</p>
<p>Junk bonds meandered aimlessly, ending the day mixed in
quiet, uneventful trading.</p>
<p>Among the key gainers were junk bonds of Santa Fe Pacific
Corp., which rose on news that the railroad, real estate and
natural-resources concern has amended an earlier
debt-for-equity exchange offer.</p>
<p>Santa Fe Pacific's 16% pay-in-kind senior subordinated
debentures rose 1 1/2 points to finish at 103 5/8 on the New
York Stock Exchange. Pay-in-kind bonds pay interest in the
form of additional securities. The company, which last month
announced a refinancing plan for its $780 million issue of
its pay-in-kind debentures, lowered to $15 a share the
minimum exchange value of its common stock in the exchange
offer.</p>
<p>The junk bonds of Quantum Chemical Corp. came under
pressure after Standard & Poor's Corp. downgraded the
chemical company's senior debt to single-B-plus from
double-B-minus.</p>
<p>The credit rating agency said the moves reflects
"Quantum's vulnerability as a highly leveraged firm to what
is now likely to be a deeper and more protracted downturn in
the commodity chemical cycle."</p>
<p>Quantum's 13% senior subordinated debentures ended at a
bid price of 70, down 1 point. The debentures had been
trading as high as 93 in mid-June.</p>
<p>In the investment-grade corporate debt market, high-grade
bonds ended between 1/4 to 3/8 point lower. Among new issues,
Sonat Inc., an energy-resources holding company, offered $575
face amount of zero-coupon convertible subordinated notes.
The 15-year notes, underwritten by Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets under the trademark Liquid Yield Option Notes, were
priced at $343.47 per $1,000 bond to yield 7.25%.</p>
<p>The securities are convertible into common stock at $59.51
a share, representing a 13.2% conversion premium over
Tuesday's closing price.</p>
<p>Municipal Securities</p>
<p>A warm reception for California's $700 million various
purpose general obligation bonds was evidence of a relatively
friendly mood in the municipal bond market.</p>
<p>The bonds were won by a group led by Bank of America
National Trust & Savings Association, and priced to yield
from 5.90% in 1991 to 7.25% in 2010. No unsold bonds remained
in late trading.</p>
<p>In secondary dealings, actively traded issues ended
narrowly mixed in lively trading, with some issues off as
much as 1/4 point and others up as much as 1/4.</p>
<p>Some traders attribute the municipal market's relatively
firm tone to the scarcity of supply.</p>
<p>The New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% securities of
2018 ended 1/8 lower at 97 with the yield at 7.44%, the same
level at Monday's close.</p>
<p>Mortgage-, Asset-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Mortgage securities ended with modest losses.</p>
<p>Among actively traded secondary issues, Government
National Mortgage Association 9.5% issues for September
delivery were off 1/8 at 98, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
9.5% issues were down 5/ 32 at 97 19/32 and Federal National
Mortgage Association 9.5% securities were off 5/32 at 98 1/8.</p>
<p>Primary market activity was quite subdued compared with
recent sessions.</p>
<p>A $300 million Freddie Mac real estate mortgage investment
conduit was the sole new offering in the session.</p>
<p>More than $3 billion of new Remic securities were
announced publicly on Monday, including three Fannie Mae
offerings priced late last week.</p>
<p>Yesterday's issue, FHLMC Gold Remic 1002, is the second
Freddie Mac offering ever collateralized with Gold PCs.</p>
<p>Freddie Mac introduced Gold PC-backed Remics on Monday, in
a $1 billion offer collateralized with 9.5% Gold PCs through
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.</p>
<p>Gold PCs, or participation certificates, were introduced
in June by Freddie Mac. They are securities that offer a
reduced payment delay between the time homeowners make their
monthly payments and the time investors get their payments
from Freddie Mac.</p>
<p>The payment delay is 45 days on Gold PCs, down from 75
days on original PCs and the fastest payment to investors of
any agency-issued conventional mortgage. By October, all new
PC's issued by Freddie Mac will be Gold PCs.</p>
<p>The latest Freddie Mac REMICS are being backed by 9% Gold
PCs and underwritten by Lehman Brothers.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>Foreign government bonds ended mixed yesterday.</p>
<p>In Tokyo, Japanese government bonds ended slightly
stronger. Dealers said the market rebounded early in the
session on the rise in the value of the yen, but lost most of
those gains on news that an American hostage died in Iraq.</p>
<p>At the 3 p.m. JST close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the
yield on the benchmark No. 119 10-year bond was 82.73, up
0.09 points, to yield 8.18%. (When calculated using the
semi-annual compound method, the yield for the No. 199 closed
at 7.50%, according to Salomon Brothers Inc.)</p>
<p>In West Germany, bond prices were nearly 1/4 point lower
as an early rally sputtered on the lack of follow-through
buying. British government bonds, called gilts, ended higher.</p>
