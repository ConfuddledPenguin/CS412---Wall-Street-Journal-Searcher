	<p class="article-leader">R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co. planned $487.5 million
acquisition of a commercial-printing venture got clearance
from a federal judge, who brushed aside Federal Trade
Commission arguments that the combination would violate
antitrust law.
   Donnelley, the U.S.'s biggest commercial printer, agreed
in December to acquire Meredith/Burda Cos., a joint venture
owned by Meredith Corp. and members of West Germany's Burda
family.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>After a lengthy review, the FTC last month asked the
federal court for the District of Columbia to bar the
purchase. The agency said it had "reason to believe" the
acquisition "could substantially reduce competition in
high-volume publication rotogravure printing" in the U.S. The
so-called gravure printing process represents only about 16%
of all U.S. printing and is overshadowed by a different
technology known as offset printing.</p>
<p>Judge Stanley S. Harris declined to issue the injunction,
writing that "any anti-competitive consequences arising out
of the proposed acquisition (are) highly unlikely."</p>
<p>The FTC said it plans to appeal the ruling, Donnelley
said. FTC officials couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>If the deal had been blocked, neither Meredith nor
Donnelley would have suffered serious damage. While the
Meredith/Burda agreement would mark the largest acquisition
ever for Donnelley, the growth-minded Chicago company is
considered well positioned to make other purchases.</p>
<p>Meredith, the Des Moines, Iowa, publisher of magazines
including Ladies' Home Journal and Better Homes and Gardens,
said when the agreement was reached that it would consider a
share-repurchase plan with proceeds from the planned sale, as
well as possible acquisitions and new magazines.</p>
<p>In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Meredith shares climbed $1.50 to close at $24.50; Donnelley
shares slipped 37.5 cents to close at $39.</p>
<p>The FTC's challenge of the acquisition had been seen as a
further sign of the commission's recent tougher stand on
proposed mergers, compared with the relatively passive
posture it took when dominated by appointees of former
President Reagan.</p>
<p>The FTC's position "might have had considerable validity
10 or even five years ago," Judge Harris wrote. But
technological developments have permitted printers to use the
offset method for printing magazines, catalogs and
advertising inserts that are "indistinguishable" from those
printed by the gravure method.</p>
<p>Judge Harris also said customers of commercial-printing
operations are sophisticated and possess substantial
bargaining power, even in markets where competition is
limited.</p>
