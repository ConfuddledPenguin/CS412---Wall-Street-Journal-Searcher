	<p class="article-leader">CALGARY, Alberta -- A group including Bow Valley
Industries Ltd. expects to soon win regulatory approval to
start developing the big East Brae oil and gas field in the
North Sea, at a total cost of about 1.5 billion Canadian
dollars (US$1.31 billion).
   "It's currently in the {U.K.} Department of Energy's
review process, and we should have approval within about a
month," to start work on the field, said Daryl Seaman, Bow
Valley's chairman and chief executive officer, in an
interview.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Bow Valley, controlled by British Gas PLC, owns 13.3% of
East Brae and 14% of each of four adjacent fields, three of
which have been put into production since 1983. East Brae is
the largest of the group, accounting for 40% of the Brae
area's estimated 716 million barrels of oil reserves, and 54%
of its natural gas reserves, which total about 2.79 trillion
cubic feet.</p>
<p>Bow Valley's share of East Brae's development costs,
including related pipeline expenditures, will total about
C$275 million, Mr. Seaman said. Marathon Oil UK Ltd., a unit
of Pittsburgh-based USX Corp., will operate the field.</p>
<p>Pending approval, production at East Brae is slated to
begin in late 1993, peaking in 1995 at a total expected daily
volume of 155,000 barrels of oil or its equivalent. The
figure includes natural gas volume of 300 million cubic feet
a day, converted to barrels at a six-to-one ratio.</p>
<p>Bow Valley's share of East Brae's output is expected to
boost the company's oil output by 33%, to 45,000 barrels a
day by 1994, said Keith Lazelle, vice president, investor
relations. Bow Valley's natural gas production is expected to
rise by more than 40% during the same period, to 260 million
cubic feet a day, largely reflecting the impact of East Brae.</p>
<p>"We did a study comparing the size and impact of East Brae
to Caroline," said Mr. Seaman, referring to a large sour gas
field at Caroline, Alberta, that is 62%-owned by
Calgary-based Shell Canada Ltd. The Caroline field, generally
regarded as Canada's largest gas find in recent years, has
won much industry attention in Canada. "We found that East
Brae is at least as large a project, and will throw off more
revenue, than Caroline," he said.</p>
<p>Regulators in Alberta are expected to announce as early as
Friday which of two competing development plans for the
Caroline field has been approved. A C$825 million development
proposal by Shell Canada, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group,
an Anglo-Dutch concern, is competing with a rival plan by
Husky Oil Ltd. Husky, which owns 12% of Caroline, is an
affiliate of Nova Corp. of Alberta.</p>
