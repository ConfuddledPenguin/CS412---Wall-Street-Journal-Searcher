	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The NBC-owned television-stations division is
experimenting with some radical changes in the format of its
early-evening newscasts.
   The revamped newscast may lead to longer videotaped
reports -- perhaps as long as five minutes, compared with the
current average of two minutes -- and more live interviews of
newsmakers by the news anchor, not unlike ABC News's
"Nightline."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Staffers within the division said, however, they fear that
the changes, if implemented, may cause staff cuts because the
stations might not need as many reporters. National
Broadcasting Co., a unit of General Electric Co., owns six
stations and holds 49% of a station in Cleveland.</p>
<p>Although NBC's stations operate independently, Al Jerome,
the division's president, has summoned general managers and
news directors of all the stations to a meeting Sept. 25 in
San Jose, Calif., to review audience research and a prototype
of an experimental newscast.</p>
<p>The project, referred to internally as "Newscast for the
Nineties," has been under way since April and is headed by
Lee Hanna, a former news executive of the NBC-owned stations
division and former TV editor of the trade newspaper Variety.</p>
<p>In an interview, Mr. Hanna confirmed the project but said,
"We're a year away from anything concrete. This is a yearlong
project to develop a new technique to deliver the news."</p>
<p>Last night, WNBC, the NBC station in New York, was
scheduled to air about five reports on its 6 p.m. newscast
that could fit the mold of the project. For instance, a
report about crack-addicted infants who are now youngsters
and are entering schools was scheduled to run more than four
minutes, an eternity for broadcast journalism. The report
focused on whether New York's Board of Education is prepared
to teach these children.</p>
<p>Mr. Hanna denies that NBC would need fewer reporters if
the experiment is implemented. "If anything we'll need more
because it takes longer to produce a five-minute piece," he
said.</p>
<p>Most of the reports videotaped for the experimental
newscast recently were previewed by six focus groups. "We
wanted to get a feel of things that were of interest to
people," Mr. Hanna said.</p>
<p>The moves come as ratings for several of the NBC stations
are declining, although the NBC network has enjoyed five
consecutive years as No. 1, according to the audience-rating
company A.C. Nielsen Co. For example, ratings for WNBC's 6
p.m. newscast fell 14% in May from the previous year, and the
11 p.m. newcast's ratings dropped 6%.</p>
<p>Newscasts are vital to local stations because they provide
most of the stations' revenues.</p>
