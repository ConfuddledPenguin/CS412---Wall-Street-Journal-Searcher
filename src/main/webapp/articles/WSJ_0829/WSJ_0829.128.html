	<p class="article-leader">Manufactured Homes Inc., Winston-Salem, N.C., said it
entered a conditional agreement with Prudential Insurance Co.
of America in which Manufactured Homes' debt to Prudential
would be converted into equity in the company.
   Under the agreement, a $47.4 million debt to Prudential,
Newark, N.J., and to a Prudential trust would be converted to
a 49.5% fully diluted equity interest in Manufactured Homes,
which produces and markets mobile homes.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Manufactured Homes said its indebtedness to Prudential
includes a judgment brought by Prudential in federal court in
New York seeking collection of $6.4 million on a revolving
credit note. Manufactured Homes said that, if the conditions
of the agreement are met, Prudential has agreed to exchange
an outstanding warrant to buy one million shares of
Manufactured Homes common stock, and the amounts due under
the consent judgment and the revolving credit agreement, for
newly issued Class B common stock.</p>
<p>Manufactured Homes said the conversion would reduce its
debt by about $47 million and eliminate annual interest
payments of about $4.7 million. Moreover, it would have a
substantial dilutive effect on the current shares
outstanding. If, however, the transaction isn't completed,
the company may not be able to pay amounts owed under the
consent judgment, the notes, the revolving credit agreement,
and other obligations.</p>
