	<p class="article-leader">EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- Farr Co., a producer of filtration
systems, said it may purchase as many as 300,000, or 11%, of
its 2,846,402 common shares outstanding, from time to time in
open-market or negotiated transactions. It didn't specify
when the buy-back program is to be completed.
   The shares acquired will either be held as treasury shares
or allocated to Farr's employee stock option plans. The funds
required for the buy-backs will be obtained through bank
borrowings, Farr said.</p>
