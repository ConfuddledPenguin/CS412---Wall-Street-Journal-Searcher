	<p class="article-leader">A federal appeals court ruled that the Resolution Trust
Corp. has the power to override state banking laws to sell
insolvent thrifts and their branches to banks.
   The ruling yesterday, by a panel of the U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in St. Louis, could help dismantle a major hurdle
to RTC thrift sales in the 13 states that restrict, to
varying degrees, the operation of bank branches.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The circuit court panel, in a 2-1 decision, overturned a
July 9 ruling by federal district Judge Stephen Reasoner of
Little Rock, Ark., who blocked the RTC's planned sale of an
insolvent thrift and its branches to a unit of Worthen
Banking Corp. of Little Rock.</p>
<p>The RTC successfully argued that it has the right, under
the thrift-reform legislation of 1989, to override state
restrictions on bank branches. Arkansas, New Mexico and 11
other states have laws that restrict bank branches.</p>
<p>The circuit court is the highest court to rule to date on
the RTC policy. A federal district court judge in New Mexico
ruled in the RTC's favor in mid-June, but the decision has
been appealed to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver,
which hasn't yet scheduled arguments in the case.</p>
<p>Worthen's acquisition of Independence Federal Bank was
challenged by the Arkansas State Bank Department and the
Arkansas Independent Bankers Association; they cited state
laws that bar banks from operating branches outside their
home counties. Independence Federal has 20 branches, some of
which are outside Worthen's home county.</p>
<p>After Judge Reasoner blocked the Worthen acquisition, the
RTC put on hold its plans to market eight other Arkansas
thrifts for which it acts as conservator. Worthen's offer to
buy Independence Federal was scheduled to expire yesterday.</p>
<p>In overturning Judge Reasoner's decision, Eighth Circuit
Court Judge John Gibson wrote that the thrift-reform
legislation was ambiguous on the subject of overriding state
laws, but that the RTC has the power to write regulations
that cure the ambiguity. Therefore, Judge Gibson wrote, the
agency was within its rights when it adopted a regulation
permitting overrides of state laws.</p>
<p>Appellate Judge Gerald Heaney, in a 10-page dissent,
argued that the thrift-reform legislation wasn't ambiguous
and that the RTC couldn't grant itself the power to override
state laws. The dissent will be significant for state banking
commissioners and independent bankers who are challenging the
RTC policy in other states.</p>
<p>One such challenge is pending in federal district court in
Denver, where the Colorado banking commissioner has asked a
federal judge to rule that the RTC doesn't have the power to
write a regulation overriding state laws. Arguments in that
case are scheduled for Sept. 5.</p>
<p>Worthen, in the meantime, said the Eighth Circuit ruling
will allow it to acquire Independence Federal "within the
next several weeks." Originally, Worthen bid $1.5 million to
acquire the thrift, its branches and $324 million in
deposits.</p>
