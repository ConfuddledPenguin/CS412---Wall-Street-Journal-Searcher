	<p class="article-leader">Addington Resources Inc. said it will build a $4 million
recycling facility in eastern Kentucky, the first of a number
the company intends to build around the country.
   The facility will be capable of recycling as much as 75%
of municipal solid waste, employing an automated system to
separate wastes into reusable components, the Ashland, Ky.,
company said. It will have an initial capacity of 400 tons of
solid waste per day, but could be expanded to handle up to
1,000 tons daily, the company said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In addition, Addington said it offered to reduce the size
of a landfill under construction in Boyd County, Ky., near
the proposed recycling facility, and to limit the source of
garbage to a 75-mile radius of the landfill. Opening of the
landfill has been blocked by a court order, following
objections from area residents. Addington said area residents
were concerned that the landfill would accept garbage from
the East Coast.</p>
<p>In addition to waste disposal, Addington mines coal and
does highway construction.</p>
