	<p class="article-leader">Orange-co Inc., Lake Hamilton, Fla., said it completed the
sale of two citrus groves in St. Lucie County, Fla., for
$27.6 million.
   As a result, the citrus producer said it expects to be
profitable in its fourth quarter, which ends Friday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In April, Orange-co said it planned to sell some of its
acreage and other assets to focus on improving the
profitability of its remaining citrus operations.</p>
<p>The company, 52%-owned by Stoneridge Resources Inc. in
Bloomfield Hills, Mich., said the current transaction will
generate a "significant" profit, which should translate into
fourth-quarter earnings. For its year-ago quarter, Orange-co
reported a loss of $1.2 million, or 12 cents a share, on
revenue of $43.2 million.</p>
