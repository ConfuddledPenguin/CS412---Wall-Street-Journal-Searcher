	<p class="article-leader">MARIB, Yemen -- In what the Texans here call the chow
hall, workers tuck into barbecued chicken under the brooding
gaze of a portrait of Saddam Hussein hung on the wall.
   Yemeni employees taped up the huge, tinsel-edged portrait
more than a week ago, causing consternation among their
American colleagues. "A couple of the guys took exception to
it," says Ray Cooke, assistant manager of Hunt Consolidated
Inc.'s oil refinery here. "They wanted to tear it down. I
said `Nope. You leave it right where it is.'"</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The reason: Dallas-based Hunt wants to stay right where it
is -- profitably pumping out the oil it discovered in Yemen
in 1984. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has put the American
company's oil fields smack in the middle of a political mine
field. Yemen's government backs Iraq and decries the presence
of U.S. forces in the region. As American troops began
arriving in neighboring Saudi Arabia, Yemenis began
demonstrating: Hundreds of dagger-wielding protesters hurled
stones at the U.S. Embassy in the capital, Sanaa.</p>
<p>Out in remote Marib, at the edge of the vast desert aptly
named the Empty Quarter, the silvery loops of Hunt's refinery
poke from the sand like half-buried paper clips. The nearest
Yemeni buildings, almost 22 miles distant, are a cluster of
ancient mud-brick towers. Much of the local traffic still
travels by camelback. At the refinery, Americans in baseball
caps work alongside turbaned Yemenis, some of whom are local
tribesmen who check their "jambias" -- nine-inch daggers --
and AK-47 assault rifles at the gatehouse on their way to
work. It isn't the kind of place where anyone wants to start
an argument over politics.</p>
<p>"We all are with Saddam Hussein," says Mohammed Zain, a
storekeeper at the refinery. "We support him against all
foreign troops. But the Americans here are our brothers," he
adds, and "we don't talk about it with them."</p>
<p>Richard Davis, general manager of Hunt's Yemen operations,
hopes it stays that way. "We are trying to keep a low profile
and get on with the job," he says. That's easier said than
done. Oil accounts for about half of Yemen's revenue, and
Hunt controls the oil business.</p>
<p>With scores of U.S. and European Hunt employees based
here, the company is a conspicuous presence in this small,
isolated country. Hunt's four-wheel-drive vehicles crisscross
the desert, its microwave dishes dot the mountain crags, its
helicopters clatter through the skies, and its tall Texas oil
men tower over Yemenis in the towns. Besides running the
refinery, Hunt, with Exxon Corp. as a minority partner, is
drilling new wells and pumping crude through a mountain
pipeline for export. It is also conducting seismic surveys in
a consortium that includes Kuwait's oil company, now
operating in exile. "They are, in every sense, a cowboy
outfit," says a British diplomat in Sanaa. "If they pulled
out, I don't think any other company would come in."</p>
<p>Closely held Hunt, whose U.S. interests include
well-servicing, real estate and agribusiness, has a corporate
style that certainly is idiosyncratic. The boardroom
politesse of its executives often belies a barroom toughness
useful in Yemen, where even in normal times the business
climate presents unusual challenges. Parts of Yemen still are
under control of armed tribes whose relationship with the
central government can be tenuous. Hunt has had vehicles
"borrowed" by tribesmen, with the government generally having
to ransom them back by building a schoolhouse or health
clinic.</p>
<p>Tom Meurer, who handles political liaison for the company,
remembers the day a Hunt engineer drove past a waving
tribesman. "When the vehicle didn't stop, he laid a round
from his Kalashnikov around it," he says. "All he wanted was
a liter of gas. It was one way to get attention."</p>
<p>Hunt's origins, in the oil fields of West Texas, help it
fit the Yemen milieu. At one point, the company decided to
present a gift to Yemen's president. Recalls Mr. Meurer: "We
wanted to give him something that expressed what Texas was
all about." They decided on a pistol, holster and 50 rounds
of ammunition.</p>
<p>In the nine years since its first explorers went out to
find oil in Yemen, the company has built a network of
relationships reaching from the humblest Bedouin camel herder
right up to the presidential palace. When a tribe near Hunt's
rigs needed a water well, Hunt employees found time to sink
it. And when the president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, recently made
his first visit to the White House, Hunt invited him to
Dallas for some Texas-style hospitality that included a rodeo
in Fort Worth.</p>
<p>The company doesn't disclose figures relating to its
operations, but its venture in Yemen is one of its largest
and most profitable, with total investment estimated at
around $1 billion. Robert Weiss, an analyst with Standard &
Poor's, says in a report that while the company's domestic
operations are satisfactory, it is the 200,000-barrel-a-day
production in Yemen that "raises considerably Hunt's overall
business profile" and earns it an A+ credit rating.</p>
<p>News of the Kuwait invasion sent tremors through the
company. Ray Hunt, its chairman and chief executive officer,
was home in Dallas watching TV when the story broke late at
night. "I went, `Oh, nuts,' or probably put it a little
stronger than that,'" says the 47-year-old Mr. Hunt, who owns
the company along with his mother and three sisters. He is a
son of the late Texas wildcatter H.L. Hunt, but his business
interests are separate from those of his better-known
half-brothers, Bunker, Herbert and Lamar. H.L. Hunt
concentrated his oil operations in the U.S., but when Ray
Hunt took over the company he took the oil search overseas.</p>
<p>And not just anywhere. A list of countries in which Hunt
has interests reads like a State Department travel warning.
It just signed an exploration agreement in war-torn Ethiopia.
It is searching for oil in Laos, with an exploration
concession that includes part of the Ho Chi Minh trail. And
it is trying to strike up a deal with strife-ridden Burma.</p>
<p>"What we try to do is lean against the wind," Mr. Hunt
says. "If all you do is what everybody else does, then if you
survive, your success will only be modest." He likens Hunt's
competition with the Mobils and Texacos of the world to "a
guerrilla force going up against a conventional army." Hunt
can move quickly into areas unappetizing to large
bureaucracies -- or skittish shareholders.</p>
<p>But looking for big rewards means managing big risks. The
night Iraq invaded Kuwait, executives from Dallas to Sanaa
scrambled to assess the likely impact on the company. Mr.
Meurer, the political troubleshooter, got a late-night call
from the chief financial officer asking for an evaluation to
be presented the next day at a meeting of management.</p>
<p>"I started turning over the `what ifs' and didn't go back
to sleep," Mr. Meurer says. On an early-morning jog, he
roughed out scenarios based on Yemen's regional alliances,
the impact on Hunt's Kuwaiti exploration partner and the
likely consequences of U.S. intervention.</p>
<p>It was when the Yemen representative on the United Nations
Security Council declined to vote on a resolution condemning
the invasion that "the scorecards started being kept," says
Mr. Davis in Sanaa. Yemen's delegate said he didn't have
instructions on how to vote, reflecting the dilemma posed by
the country's alliance with Iraq, but receipt of aid from
Kuwait. For Hunt, that stand created confusion. "We didn't
have enough information to know why the vote was cast as it
was," says Mr. Davis.</p>
<p>When the U.S. military intervened, the mood in Yemen
became clear. Most of the population swung behind Iraq, and
anger at America expressed itself in the streets. Hunt's
primary concern was the safety of its employees in Yemen, the
number of which it won't disclose. Good communication helped.
Overseas radio bulletins were reporting 10,000 demonstrators
trying to storm the U.S. Embassy. "Fortunately, I was on the
phone to corporate headquarters in the States when that
report came over," says Mr. Davis, and was able to explain
that the bulletin apparently had been based on exaggerated
accounts by Iraq's news service. In fact, no more than 500
Yemenis were outside the embassy, and Yemen's police were
containing the protest.</p>
<p>Communication with the government also proved reassuring.
A few days into the crisis, the foreign minister called Mr.
Davis with a message from the president, saying the events
wouldn't affect Yemen's relationship with Hunt, and any
support the drillers needed would be forthcoming.</p>
<p>The government also ordered a stop to stone-throwing
during demonstrations. Protestors now are limited to shouting
and waving placards. The president also stressed in a
television interview that foreigners in Yemen were working
for the good of the country and didn't have anything to do
with the Western forces massing in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>"We want the Americans to get out of there, not out of
here," says Abdul Hakim Mohammed, a Yemeni driver for Hunt.</p>
<p>Protecting foreigners who provide useful skills is deeply
embedded in Yemeni custom. For hundreds of years, Jewish
silversmiths in Yemen were considered neutrals in tribal
wars. "Protected people providing useful services aren't
supposed to be cut up into small and bloody pieces," explains
a Western diplomat.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the company decided to pull out the families
of workers. A few days later, the U.S. Embassy made the same
decision for dependents of its staff, sending them home along
with all Peace Corps volunteers. Then, Hunt sent in Mr.
Meurer and two of its top security men to assess the
situation and send a message of reassurance to the staff.</p>
<p>"Everybody isn't staying behind a desk in Dallas," Mr.
Hunt says. "I don't think we could have asked for more in
terms of a response from the government," but even so, it
pays to be prudent. "Even the U.S. can't guarantee the
security of its president 100%."</p>
<p>Hunt's two security directors, Walt Coughlin and Wilber
Rainey, know a thing or two about that. Both are former
Secret Service agents assigned to the White House during the
turbulent Vietnam War era. Arriving in Yemen, they went first
to the Marib refinery that sits atop the vast oil field the
company struck with its first wildcat well.</p>
<p>The field isn't far from Yemen's ill-defined border with
Saudi Arabia, and relations between the two countries are
precarious. If Yemen were to allow Iraqi forces to cross its
border with Saudi Arabia, State Department analysts speculate
that the Saudis could retaliate by financing a terrorist hit
on Yemen's oil infrastructure.</p>
<p>Don McNelis, vice president of operations in Yemen, doubts
that would happen. "For one thing, you've got armed tribesmen
for about 30 miles all around here who are pretty picky about
who moves on their land," he says. And at the refinery
itself, Yemen's army is guarding the perimeter and manning
checkpoints on the road. "When you've got the army helping
you it makes your job a lot easier," says Mr. Coughlin. "So
long as their guns are pointing the right way, you're okay."</p>
<p>To some extent, Mr. Coughlin says, the refinery and the
drilling sites are protected by their isolation. It is in the
city that the risk of an attack is higher. Hunt has advised
its staff to stay out of town as much as possible, but so far
additional security hasn't been considered necessary.</p>
<p>Most Yemenis see the company as a promise of increased
prosperity, says Abdel Malik Assindi, an official with the
ministry of information. "People here believe that the big
oil companies knew there was oil here but were pressured by
the Saudis against exploring for it. They see Ray Hunt as a
man who plays his own hand of cards, and they admire that,"
he says.</p>
<p>Indeed, as many Westerners scramble to find flights out of
the region, Hunt employees are among the few still flying in.
Most employees are on a 28-day rotation, working consecutive
12-hour days in the desert and then flying home for a month's
break. So far, Mr. McNelis says, everyone due back in Yemen
has turned up on schedule.</p>
<p>Hunt employees don't talk about worst-case scenarios. Most
believe there won't be one, because the interests of the
country and the company are identical. Oil companies in much
more hostile situations have kept right on with their
operations. Occidental Petroleum stayed in Libya during the
nadir of U.S. relations with Col. Moammar Gadhafi. In Angola,
Cuban troops protected Gulf Oil operations during the war.
Hunt believes the key is staying out of politics -- and
putting up with Saddam portraits in the chow hall. "We are
just oil finders from Texas," Mr. Meurer says. "Politics
isn't our business."</p>
