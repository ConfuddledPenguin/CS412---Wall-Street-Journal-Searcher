	<p class="article-leader">HONG KONG -- The British colony's biggest bank, Hongkong &
Shanghai Banking Corp., posted a 21% decline in first-half
profit and said it expected conditions to remain difficult
during the current half.
   Losses in Australia, the U.S. and at two of the
capital-markets divisions eroded earnings from the bank's
traditionally strong markets in Asia and Canada. Analysts
said they weren't surprised that the bank's poor-performing
areas incurred losses, but they hadn't expected the impact of
the deficits to be so great. The analysts had expected the
bank to report profit growth of between 5% and 13%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It's pretty bad. The problem areas are a lot worse than
we thought," said David Kowitz, a bank analyst at Jardine
Fleming & Co.</p>
<p>The bank said after-tax profit fell in the first half to
1.53 billion Hong Kong dollars (US$196 million), or 23.87
Hong Kong cents a share, from HK$1.93 billion, or 30.38 cents
a share, a year earlier. Despite the decline, the proposed
interim dividend was raised to 13 Hong Kong cents a share
from an adjusted 12.7 cents a share. Full-year earnings are
likely to be below last year's record HK$4.77 billion, the
bank said. That would mark its first full-year profit decline
since 1967.</p>
<p>John Gray, the bank's deputy chairman, called the results
disappointing and noted that the bank earlier had warned
shareholders that it faced a difficult year. The possibility
of higher interest rates in many countries and the conflict
in the Middle East has increased the uncertainty, he added.</p>
<p>The bank said that it took "significantly higher
provisions" against losses at two of its units, Marine
Midland Banks Inc. of the U.S. and Hongkong Bank of Australia
Ltd., and that the two are expected to post losses for the
full year.</p>
<p>In the U.S., Marine Midland swung to a first-half loss of
US$19.8 million from net income of US$81.6 million a year
earlier, largely because of increased provisions for its real
estate exposure.</p>
<p>Hongkong Bank said that its business relationship with
Midland Bank PLC of Britain has been strengthened and that
discussions on a closer association continue. The profit
decline at Hongkong Bank and weak profit at Midland probably
mean that the widely expected combination of the two may be
farther away than many people have predicted.</p>
