	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Despite pressure from Washington that Japan make
a stronger commitment to U.S.-led efforts to dislodge Iraqi
forces from occupied Kuwait, Tokyo is on the verge of
announcing a package of measures that will leave vague the
full extent of its financial contribution.
   After weeks of deliberation, the government is expected to
unveil the package today. A government official said it would
include the dispatch of a medical team to the region and the
chartering of civilian aircraft to transport nonmilitary
supplies to the multinational force in the Persian Gulf.
There is also a "50-50 chance" the package will include
increased support for U.S. troops stationed in Japan, the
official said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But more weeks of deliberation will be needed before Japan
decides how much aid it will give to Turkey, Egypt and other
Middle Eastern countries whose economies have been hurt by
the crisis. The official said today's measures "will most
likely be announced as a first package, to be followed up
later."</p>
<p>U.S. pressure on Japan has been intense. The Kyodo news
agency quoted Tokyo officials as saying that U.S. Ambassador
Michael Armacost had warned them that Japan's response will
determine whether it can rise to a position of international
leadership, such as permanent membership in the U.N. Security
Council. Unless Japan upgraded the pace and substance of its
Gulf contribution, Kyodo reported Mr. Armacost as saying,
"`dangerous doubts' could arise among Americans as to who
their true friends really are."</p>
<p>News reports have indicated that the package announced
today might include as much as $35 million in emergency
grants to Middle Eastern countries, with a promise of greater
sums later. But a senior Finance Ministry official dismissed
the reports as speculative. He said Japan would like to see a
multilateral aid package for the region, with contributions
from the U.S. and other countries as well as Japan, funneled
through such international institutions as the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p>"Japan should make a significant contribution, but there's
a limit to what one country can do," he said.</p>
<p>But devising such a package could take time. The senior
Finance Ministry official said Japan has just begun talking
to the U.S. and European countries about it. Another Finance
Ministry source said the deliberations might not be concluded
until just before Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu visits five
Mideastern countries in early October.</p>
<p>"The Foreign Ministry wants to come up with something
faster, but we'd like to study all the options," he said.</p>
<p>Japanese officials all say they want Japan to make a
noteworthy contribution to the multinational effort. But they
are clearly having difficulty reaching a consensus on how to
do so. Almost every aspect of its deliberations have been
dogged by controversy, from budgetary worries to concerns
about violating Japan's war-renouncing constitution.</p>
<p>For example, the government's decision to help transport
supplies to U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia had to overcome
strong reservations by cargo companies. The two Japan Air
Lines 747 freighters that the government is expected to
charter represent 20% of JAL's cargo fleet, and the airline
had deep concerns about the safety of its crews and the fate
of 23 of its employees who are currently "guests" in a
Baghdad hotel. The airline also successfully insisted that it
not be required to carry munitions. The Transport Ministry
reportedly asked three airlines, including JAL, and a
shipowner organization to provide cargo planes and ships to
transport nonmilitary items such as water, food and medical
supplies to the multinational forces in the Gulf.</p>
<p>The difficulties the government has faced are in part the
result of bureaucratic infighting, but may also reflect a
deeper public attitude. Social commentator Kazuhisa Ogawa
said on Japanese television recently that Japan suffers from
"a lack of a sense of being a direct participant" in the Gulf
crisis.</p>
<p>In the short run, Japan's inability to specify its
financial contribution probably won't hurt Mr. Kaifu's
government domestically. For weeks, Japanese opinion makers
have been saying that it isn't enough for Japan to write a
check; the important thing is for it to participate in the
international effort more directly. So the initial reaction
to the package here is likely to emphasize Japan's direct
contribution of logistical and medical support.</p>
<p>But if U.S. congressmen and other Americans criticize the
package as inadequate, Mr. Kaifu could eventually feel
political backlash from public perception of worsening
U.S.-Japan relations. Already public-opinion polls in the
U.S. show that large majorities of Americans don't think
Japan is contributing enough in the crisis. Some Japanese
fear that Japan's contributions or lack of them could become
an issue in this fall's U.S. congressional campaign.</p>
<p>But other Japanese are defiant. Tomomitsu Oba, president
of the Japan Center for International Finance and a former
top Finance Ministry official, says Japan can't spend huge
sums both at home and abroad.</p>
