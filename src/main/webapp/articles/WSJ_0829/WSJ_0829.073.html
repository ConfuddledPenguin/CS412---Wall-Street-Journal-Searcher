	<p class="article-leader">It's the summer of 1959, and Nora Silk, the divorced
heroine of Alice Hoffman's "Seventh Heaven" (Putnam, 256
pages, $19.95), has decided to turn in her modest Manhattan
flat for a fixer-upper on Long Island's south shore. There
she hopes to make friends and to start a new life for
herself, her two small sons, and her cat.
   But Nora's mundane, convention-bound neighbors on Hemlock
Street -- yes, Hemlock Street -- don't exactly roll out the
red carpet. To them, Nora's marital status, funky
beauty-parlor job and lack of homemaking skills are major
turnoffs. Seven-year-old Billy gets even worse treatment: His
classmates torment him, and, noting Nora's fondness for
unorthodox black garb, brand her a witch.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>And guess what? She is a witch. When a kid beats up Billy,
Nora molds a wax doll and melts off a bit of its legs; the
next morning, the bully is a head shorter. Other neighbors --
apparently under Nora's mystical influence, or inspired by
her iconoclasm -- behave unexpectedly. A fat housewife slims
down and deserts her family; a high-school valedictorian runs
off to Florida to try out for the Yankees.</p>
<p>Through all this, there's hardly a ripple in Ms. Hoffman's
placid tone. Nor is there much in the way of plot
development. The magical events happen in isolation, without
payoff. Inexplicably, nobody but the bully realizes that he's
shrunk, and though he's devastated he keeps it to himself.</p>
<p>What's Ms. Hoffman's point -- that suburbanites don't
communicate? Manifestly, she means to say something about the
suburbs, and about what Robert Lowell called the
"tranquillized Fifties." But what? It's never clear. If on
one page Ms. Hoffman waxes rhapsodic about suburbia, on the
next she sneers at it. Time and again she works against her
own strengths, undermining a fresh portrait of middle-class
life with cheap, familiar sarcasm and subverting potentially
credible characters with occult poppycock.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the $64,000 question: Why all the
hocus-pocus? Reviewers have lauded Ms. Hoffman for perceiving
"the magic in the mundane." But it's one thing to perceive
magic in the mundane, another to graft it on. At times Nora
appears to be intended as a harbinger of post-'50s womanhood
-- with witchcraft, naturally, as an emblem of female
empowerment. But this reading doesn't really work, for Nora
sells Tupperware and has, after all, moved to the suburbs.
Ultimately, try as one might, one can't make the commonplace
and supernatural elements of "Seventh Heaven" cohere.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Like "Seventh Heaven," Matthew Stadler's "Landscape:
Memory" (Scribners, 301 pages, $19.95) tells a fantastic
story about an extraordinary protagonist. Set in northern
California in 1914-16, this remarkable first novel takes the
form of a diary kept by Max Kosegarten, a brilliant
16-year-old whose affluent, progressive-minded parents have
given him a first-rate humanistic education.</p>
<p>Max, who conceives of his diary as a "book about memory,"
is fascinated by the mutability of his recollections and
eager to fix his experiences in words. He is the
quintessential adolescent prodigy-ardent, conceited,
heartbreakingly earnest, at once charmingly naive and
unsettlingly smart, intense in his responsiveness both to
abstract ideas and to the world's physicality, avid in his
desire to embrace life and to conquer its mysteries.</p>
<p>Among those mysteries, of course, is sex, which Max
discovers during an idyllic summer at the Bolinas shore. It
is there that Max and his friend Duncan become lovers -- a
development that the boys' friends and parents curiously
don't even blink at. Roughly translated, Kosegarten means
"garden of lovemaking," and Mr. Stadler describes both the
affair and its setting in utterly Edenic terms.</p>
<p>Objectively, these happenings strain credulity. But
"Landscape: Memory" doesn't pretend to be realistic. Like the
intellectually and erotically charged fiction of Guy
Davenport, it takes place on a more symbolic plane than your
typical coming-of-age novel. The Bolinas section is
particularly indebted to Mr. Davenport's recent stories,
among them "Apples and Pears," set in a utopian community of
love-happy young Danes. Both writers in turn derive many of
their ideas from the French philosopher Charles Fourier
(1772-1837), who argued that sexual freedom (preferably
against an idyllic backdrop) was the key to social harmony.</p>
<p>Yet Mr. Stadler depicts Fourieristic bliss only to
underscore its impossibility. His aim is not merely to
proffer romantic fantasies but to reflect upon some of life's
harder facts: that youth is a time of unattainable ideals,
adulthood a time of grim realities, and memory and art
forever imperfectible.</p>
<p>Mr. Stadler does this with a level of artistry and
assurance rarely seen in so unseasoned a writer. To be sure,
his novel has its failings: The exuberant prose is often too
lush; Duncan's sketchy post-Bolinas motives lend a touch of
contrivance to the final pages. Yet these are minor cavils
about a passionate and intelligent novel that, in an era of
tame, arid Brat Pack fictions, is cause for celebration.</p>
