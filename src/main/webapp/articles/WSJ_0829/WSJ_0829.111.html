	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Precious metals traders, continuing to
decipher less tension in the rhetoric-filled Middle Eastern
situation, pushed gold prices down a bit further after
Monday's plunge.
   The heavily traded December gold delivery ended with a
loss of $3.40 an ounce at $392.80, after rebounding from a
low of $386, in sympathy with a late rally in crude oil
prices. The August gold contract fell $3.30 to $385.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>After opening higher at $398.50, December gold fell as low
as $386, breaking through a key support level at $390, which
helped to accelerate the decline, analysts said.</p>
<p>December silver fell to a new life-of-contract low of
$4.88 an ounce before settling at $4.9550, down one cent.
October platinum eased $3.10 an ounce to $482.90.</p>
<p>The Commodity Exchange increased initial margins, or good
faith money, on gold and silver futures contracts. This move,
effective with the close of trading yesterday, will make
trading more expensive and, therefore, is expected to reduce
both volume and volatility, analysts said. Traders seemed to
anticipate such consequences as yesterday's session was much
quieter than Monday's.</p>
<p>The gold margin was raised by $1,100 a contract, to
$2,800, while that for silver was increased by $1,100 a
contract, to $2,100.</p>
<p>Iraqi President Saddam Hussein challenged President Bush
and Prime Minister Thatcher to a TV debate. The offer was
turned down by both leaders, but traders interpreted the
Iraqi leader's action as another conciliatory gesture that
was helping to defuse the Middle Eastern crisis, analysts
said.</p>
<p>"I think traders are misreading the signals being given by
Hussein," said William O'Neill, senior futures strategist for
Merrill Lynch. "His actions are nowhere as conciliatory as
most people believe. There are always implied threats in
everything he says."</p>
<p>While Mr. Hussein's actions "are keeping the market
off-balance," Mr. O'Neill acknowledged, "the likelihood of
military action remains probable, while the possibility of a
diplomatic settlement is a long shot, at best."</p>
<p>Craig Sloane, precious metals analyst for Smith Barney,
Harris Upham, noted that the gold price may be back down to
around where it was when the Mideast crisis began Aug. 2,
when Iraq invaded Kuwait, "but that doesn't mean a resolution
of the situation is any closer."</p>
<p>However, he noted, the rebound of both gold and silver
from yesterday's lows could indicate that these commodities
may have bottomed out. "The market has been oversold," he
said.</p>
<p>Alan Posnick, senior vice president, MTB Banking, New
York, said, "Everyone is watching Hussein too closely and
reacting to every little thing he does. This has created
excess volatility. We've gone from an overbought market to an
oversold one."</p>
<p>Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst for PaineWebber,
said the gold rally has been based more on political than
economic factors; even the oil-price spurt had a strong
political element, he said.</p>
<p>"It's well to remember that the market volatility is based
on anticipation," Mr. Savaiko noted. "If the gold price is
going down in the expectation of a possible solution, it's
typical of the futures market that it isn't going to wait for
the last Iraqi soldier to leave Kuwait, but will move well
ahead of that event."</p>
<p>Mr. Savaiko said the $383-to-$385 level in the December
contract is an important support point. "Right now, the price
is likely to fluctuate around that level until there is a
clear indication as to whether or not there is going to be a
Middle Eastern settlement," he said.</p>
<p>In other commodity markets yesterday:</p>
<p>GRAINS & SOYBEANS: Prices of corn, wheat and soybean
futures contracts settled mixed in quiet trading on a lack of
new developments. With the absence of any major escalation of
hostilities in the Middle East during the trading session,
grain prices faltered for the second day. Grain prices had
been climbing earlier on speculation that the conflict in the
Middle East would boost oil prices, thus giving some
oil-producing nations additional revenues with which to buy
U.S. grain. So far, however, demand for U.S. grain exports
appears weak. At the same time, a hot spell has settled
across the Midwest at an ideal time. The dry weather is
helping to speed the maturity of the corn and soybean crops,
whose development had been slowed by the unusually wet
summer.</p>
<p>COCOA: Futures prices declined. The December delivery was
off $83 a metric ton, to $1,280. Continued lack of
follow-through on Friday's strong rally again depressed
prices, an analyst said. Signs that the dry spell is ending
in the major West African cocoa-growing areas caused traders
to sell contracts and push down prices, the analyst said.
While there is still some concern about supplies, it isn't so
great as to have warranted Friday's price surge, according to
the analyst, who added: "It simply was overdone."</p>
<p>COPPER: Futures prices eased. The December contract
declined 1.45 cents a pound to $1.2340. The prospect that the
miners' strike in Peru, which was in its 12th day yesterday,
may be resolved this week was a contributing factor in the
easiness, one analyst said. Also a possible influence was an
increase of 577 tons in Commodity Exchange warehouse stocks
of copper, to 9,200 tons, as well as increases in both
producer and consumer copper inventories, the analyst said.
However, he noted, in the background were some possible
price-supporting factors, such as labor and production
problems in other mines and copper-processing facilities
around the world, such as in Zambia, Finland and the
Philippines.</p>
