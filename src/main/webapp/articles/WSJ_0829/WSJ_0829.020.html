	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Santa Fe Pacific Corp., in response to the
market's recent decline, amended an earlier debt-for-equity
exchange offer for some of its high-yielding debt.
   The railroad, real estate and natural-resources concern
last month announced a refinancing plan for its $780 million
of 16% pay-in-kind senior subordinated debentures, due in
2003.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As part of that plan, the company said it would offer
debenture holders a chance to swap $1,000 face value of the
debentures for Santa Fe Pacific common stock valued at
$1,060, up to a maximum of $200 million face value of the
debentures. Santa Fe shares closed at $19.625 on July 30, the
day the swap offer was publicly announced; the company said
the exchange would be made based on a minimum price of $18 a
share.</p>
<p>But Santa Fe shares -- hammered by the market's downturn
-- have declined sharply to a price below the earlier
minimum.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Santa Fe shares closed at $15.625, down 75 cents.</p>
<p>The company said that about $145 million principal amount
of debentures had been tendered before the original
expiration date of 12:01 a.m. yesterday. "Rather than proceed
with the exchange of those debentures," the company said, "we
felt that in fairness to our investors we should modify the
offer."</p>
<p>In addition to reducing the exchange value to reflect a
minimum share price of $15 each, the company extended the
offer to 12:01 a.m. Sept. 12. As in the earlier offer, the
actual exchange value will be based on the average of the
share's closing price for the 10 trading days prior to the
offer's expiration.</p>
<p>Yesterday's moves suggest that unless the company's stock
shows a sharp upturn, Santa Fe will issue more common shares
in the swap than it had originally anticipated.</p>
<p>In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Santa Fe's 16% senior subordinated debentures closed
$103.625, up $1.50.</p>
