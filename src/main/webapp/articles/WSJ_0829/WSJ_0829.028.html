	<p class="article-leader">America has come a long way since the days when our
performing arts (and artists) were mainly imported luxuries.
These days American musicians share equal footing with all
comers, from Isaac Stern and Kathleen Battle to Murray
Perahia and the Emerson String Quartet.
   Yet despite our presence in the international arena, one
field still is dominated by foreign influence at home:
conducting. Leonard Bernstein may have paved the path for
native supremacy on domestic podiums, but foreign conductors
still occupy most of the top positions on these shores. The
big five orchestras -- Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, New York
and Philadelphia -- are headed, respectively, by Seiji Ozawa,
Sir Georg Solti, Christoph von Dohnanyi, Zubin Mehta and
Riccardo Muti, all foreign-born and primarily
foreign-trained, as are Daniel Barenboim and Kurt Masur,
chosen to succeed Mr. Solti and Mr. Mehta.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The generalization holds beyond the magic circle: Mtsislav
Rostropovich heads the National Symphony in Washington;
Raymond Leppard, a Briton, the Indianapolis Symphony; and
Roger Norrington, another Briton, is about to take over New
York's Orchestra of St. Luke's. There are exceptions, notable
among them the Metropolitan Opera's James Levine and the St.
Louis Symphony's music director, Leonard Slatkin, but
exceptions just the same.</p>
<p>Given the acknowledged quality of musical training in the
U.S., one wonders if this situation isn't a matter of
snobbistic attachment to foreign names -- which appears not
to afflict Europeans. Foreign influence in America is by no
means balanced by American influence abroad. American
conductors make guest appearances and recordings with
European orchestras -- some, such as Messrs. Bernstein and
Levine and Lorin Maazel, enjoy close relationships with the
orchestras at Berlin, Vienna, Paris and Salzburg.
Nonetheless, barely a handful have actually been engaged as
permanent music directors in Europe. The chosen include
Michael Tilson Thomas, recently appointed to lead the London
Symphony, and Laurence Foster, who has just completed a
10-year tenure as music director of the Monte-Carlo Opera.</p>
<p>Somewhat younger are James Conlon, 40, music director of
the Rotterdam Philharmonic since 1973, recently named chief
conductor of the Cologne Opera and music director of the City
of Cologne; and Andrew Litton, 31, who has been principal
conductor and artistic adviser of the Bournemouth (England)
Symphony since 1988. Both are native New Yorkers; both
established their regular European positions relatively early
in their careers.</p>
<p>To be sure, Mr. Conlon also has celebrated his 11th season
as music director of the Cincinnati May Festival, and has
appeared at the Met since 1976, where he is scheduled to
conduct "Salome" and "Le Nozze di Figaro" this season, as
well as the new production of Rossini's "Semiramide." But he
says that from the start he wanted to live and work in
Europe. Thus while he maintains a New York apartment, his
primary home is in Cologne.</p>
<p>Mr. Litton, on the other hand, has an apartment in
Bournemouth, an attractive spa town on England's south coast,
but lives outside Washington, D.C. He made his Met debut in
1989, conducting a fluent if rushed performance of
Tchaikovsky's "Eugene Onegin." It transpired, however, that
his brisk tempos that night were due to the agony of acute
appendicitis that necessitated surgery immediately afterward.</p>
<p>I finally got the chance to hear Mr. Litton hale and
hearty when he bowed last month at the Caramoor Festival in
Westchester, N.Y., conducting an all-Mozart program with the
Orchestra of St. Luke's. He proved adept at exploiting color
as an expressive device, playing the various instrumental
choirs against one another while maintaining the homogeneous
texture of the whole fabric. Accompanying Garrick Ohlsson in
the Piano Concerto No. 17, K. 453, he chose rather
four-square orchestral playing in the finale, but in context
this proved a firm yet pliant framework for Mr. Ohlsson's
elastic piano part.</p>
<p>Regardless of numerous American appearances, Messrs.
Conlon and Litton are best known here through their
recordings, which reveal their respective affinities for late
Romantic repertoire. Conlon's Liszt symphonic series with the
Rotterdam Philharmonic (Erato) is of particular importance,
and his new recording with the orchestra of early works by
Bela Bartok (Two Portraits for Violin and Orchestra, Op. 5;
Two Images, Op. 10; Four Pieces, Op. 12) is another worth
having -- bracing, acerbic performances, and, in the
Portraits, surprisingly sweet. The precision and balance of
the playing also bespeaks Mr. Conlon's ability as an
orchestra builder.</p>
<p>Mr. Litton's newest release is a three-disk series of
Rachmaninoff symphonies played by the Royal Philharmonic
(Virgin Classics) that stands as a serious revisionist
statement. Rachmaninoff's emotional idiom worked against his
reputation in the decades after his death, and certainly the
port-wine chromaticism of the Third Symphony (premiered in
1939) is hardly characteristic of modern music in the age of
Arnold Schoenberg. It was, however, a hallmark of
contemporaneous screen music.</p>
<p>Those highly colored themes for massed cellos or solo
horn, those towering crescendos emphasized with sustained
rolls on the cymbals, are the very metaphors for what we now
regard as "classic" film scores by composers such as Max
Steiner, Erich Korngold and Dimitri Tiomkin. Yet they
borrowed from Rachmaninoff, not the other way around. Mr.
Litton approaches the style without apology. He yields to the
sweep of these melodies, shaping them with subtle gradations
of tempo rubato. Most important, he has the strings play with
an emphatic portamento -- sliding up and down the fingerboard
to important notes of a phrase.</p>
<p>Such articulation was as natural to string players of the
late 19th and early 20th centuries as trills were to players
of Mozart's day, but it has long been avoided by modern
players. Though modern ears might find such playing
surprising in more standard repertoire like Mahler or even
Tchaikovsky, the technique proves intensely expressive here.</p>
