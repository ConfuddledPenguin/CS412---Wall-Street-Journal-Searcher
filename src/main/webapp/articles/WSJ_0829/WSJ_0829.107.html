	<p class="article-leader">URS Corp. said it began an offering to qualified
shareholders of non-transferable rights to purchase a total
of about 800,000 common shares at $4.774 a share. San
Francisco-based URS, an engineering, architectural and
planning firm, said it agreed to make the rights offering in
connection with a capital restructuring of the company that
was otherwise completed on Feb. 21. It said proceeds from the
sale will be used toward payment of certain company debts.
URS said the rights will be exercisable until Sept. 27.</p>
