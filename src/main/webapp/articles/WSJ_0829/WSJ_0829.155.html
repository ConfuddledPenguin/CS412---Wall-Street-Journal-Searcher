	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A U.S. appeals court panel here overturned a
Federal Trade Commission rule that prohibited states from
imposing certain restrictions on optometrists' business
practices.
   The FTC rule, which took effect a year ago, invalidated
state laws that limited the number of offices optometrists
may own or operate and that, among other things, prevented
optometrists from having offices in shopping malls or from
working as employees of retail stores or optical store
chains.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The American Optometric Association, the California
Optometric Association and several states challenged the FTC
action. The court panel ruled that the FTC doesn't have the
authority to regulate state actions.</p>
<p>The FTC's general counsel, James Spears, said the
commission is "taking a good hard look" at the decision. If
the agency decides to appeal, it can ask for a hearing by the
full appeals court or petition the U.S. Supreme Court for a
ruling.</p>
<p>The FTC argued that the state restrictions raise prices to
consumers and thus affect the quality of care by causing
consumers to seek care less often. The American Optometric
Association argued that optometrists who operate in chain and
other commercial stores offer inferior eye care.</p>
<p>A coalition of consumer groups, including the Gray
Panthers and the National Consumers League, supported the
commission's action.</p>
