	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- A surprise guilty plea to racketeering and tax
fraud from one of 13 indicted soybean futures traders greatly
strengthens the government's case against the remaining dozen
traders who go on trial in less than two weeks.
   The trader, James D. Nowak, was a key defendant in the
soybean pit case: He was charged last year with two counts of
racketeering, more than 200 counts of fraud, and Commodity
Exchange Act violations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The plea agreement and other pretrial documents filed by
the prosecutors allege that Mr. Nowak, 48 years old, made
fraudulent trades with at least half of the soybean traders
who go on trial Sept. 10 here in U.S. District Court. The
government alleged that between December 1986 and January
1989 Mr. Nowak stole more than $150,000 from customers while
trading in the soybean pit at the Chicago Board of Trade.</p>
<p>Mr. Nowak couldn't be reached for comment and his
attorney, Michael Sher, declined comment on the plea
agreement.</p>
<p>Defense attorneys said it was unclear whether any of the
remaining soybean traders would plead guilty as a result of
Mr. Nowak's decision. He has agreed to testify against the
other soybean futures traders in return for the government's
recommendation that his sentence be reduced. His testimony is
expected to corroborate that of undercover federal agent
Richard Ostrom, who posed as a corrupt soybean futures trader
from late 1986 until January of 1989. Several months ago a
half-dozen other soybean traders pleaded guilty and agreed to
cooperate with the government.</p>
<p>An individual in the U.S. Attorney's office said the
government wasn't aware Mr. Nowak wanted to plead guilty
until contacted by his attorney Monday morning. The plea
agreement was quietly entered before U.S. District Judge
George Marovich Monday afternoon to avoid upstaging the
swearing in of Fred Foreman as the new U.S. Attorney for the
Northern District of Illinois, the individual said.</p>
<p>The soybean futures traders are among the 48 individuals
indicted last year for stealing from customers stemming from
the federal probe of futures trading practices at the Chicago
exchanges.</p>
<p>On Sept. 5, 15 Japanese yen futures traders from the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange also go on trial in federal court
here for alleged racketeering, fraud and Commodity Exchange
Act violations. Several yen traders have pleaded guilty and
also are cooperating with the government.</p>
<p>Mr. Nowak's plea agreement indicates that the U.S.
Attorney's office remains unwilling to drop tough
racketeering charges against futures traders, despite the
mixed verdict a jury returned against three Swiss franc
futures traders this summer in the first court test of the
federal probe.</p>
<p>Two of the Swiss franc traders were found guilty of a
total of eight Commodity Exchange Act violations. But a jury
couldn't reach a verdict on a racketeering conspiracy charge
against futures broker Robert Mosky, or on two-thirds of the
more than 100 counts against the three traders.</p>
<p>The Justice Department was criticized for over-reaching in
bringing racketeering charges, usually reserved for alleged
Mafia members, against 17 of the 48 individuals indicted last
August for stealing from customers. In addition to mandatory
jail terms if found guilty of racketeering, the traders also
would have to forfeit certain assets and profits earned via
the racketeering activity.</p>
