	<p class="article-leader">Doctors long have believed that the best way to administer
new disease-fighting biological agents would be to combine
them in "cocktails" that mimic the way the human body uses
them in nature.
   Now, Immunex Corp., a biotechnology company based in
Seattle, has taken that concept one step further. Having used
gene-splicing techniques to produce biologicals in yeast
cells, the company now has refined its gene-splicing
techniques to enable yeast to churn out a sort of pre-mixed
biological cocktail.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The cocktail, named PIXY-321, is what Immunex calls a
fusion molecule. The fusion molecule melds two therapeutic
proteins that stimulate the growth of blood cells in patients
whose bone marrow has been damaged by radiation or
chemotherapy. While the two drugs are being tested as
single-agent drugs, scientists suggest they may work even
better when given in combination. Immunex says its studies
suggest that the benefits of combination may be boosted
tenfold by using the fusion molecule.</p>
<p>Immunex scientists Douglas Williams and Linda Park are
scheduled to disclose their findings today at a meeting of
the International Society for Experimental Hematology in
Seattle.</p>
<p>The two drugs that form the fusion protein are:
interleukin-3 (IL-3), which acts upon the bone marrow very
early in the formation of blood cells; and GM-CSF, which acts
much later in the cycle of blood cell development and
maturation. GM-CSF stands for granulocyte-macrophage colony
stimulating factor.</p>
<p>One outside expert who has conducted tests using the two
drugs together is James O. Armitage, professor and vice
chairman, Department of Internal Medicine at the University
of Nebraska.</p>
<p>"Results of preliminary studies using GM-CSF in
combination with IL-3 have been very promising. If the fusion
molecule enhances those effects, this could be a discovery
that offers huge advantages over {such} therapies, as we
currently understand them," he said.</p>
<p>Steven Gillis, Immunex executive vice president and
director of research, said in an interview that the company's
primate studies show the fusion protein can spark a more
rapid increase in blood platelets and white blood cells than
when its two protein components are given in sequence.</p>
<p>Further, he added, when Immunex bathed human cells in the
test tube with PIXY-321, both red cells and white cells
responded with 10 times more growth than they had when
exposed to the two proteins either singly or in combination.</p>
<p>Mr. Gillis said he believes the enhanced blossoming of the
blood cells results from a new receptor that Immunex
scientists are studying. Normally, proteins are believed to
trigger activity by attaching to a unique receptor or target
on the surface of cells it wants to grow or become active.</p>
<p>"We discovered that there are receptors on the surface of
white blood cells that would bind to both IL-3 and GM-CSF --
a sort of dual receptor. We thought if we could make a fusion
molecule that would bind to several receptors at once -- the
IL-3 receptor, the GM-CSF receptor and the dual receptor --
we could generate a stronger signal {prompting blood cells to
grow}, and hence, greater therapeutic activity."</p>
<p>All of this remains to be proven in patients, of course.
Immunex now is engaged in formal safety analysis of the
fusion protein, and hopes to enter the drug in human clinical
trials sometime next year, Mr. Gillis said.</p>
