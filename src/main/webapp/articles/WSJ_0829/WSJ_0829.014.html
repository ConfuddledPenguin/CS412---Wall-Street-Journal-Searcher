	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Just because some of Wall Street's media
wizards persist in valuing Time Warner stock at around 200,
skeptics say, that doesn't mean it's a screaming buy at 79
3/8.
   Nowadays investors want to see good old-fashioned
corporate profits, and that's a big shift on the media scene.
Many stocks being touted today as cheap asset plays are
overpriced as ordinary investments.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>During the 1980s merger frenzy, investors bought shares
such as Time Warner, Paramount Communications and
Tele-Communications for their "asset values." They bet that
acquirers would soon pay crazy prices for media companies and
make shareholders very rich. But now it's a new ball game.</p>
<p>"The market is shifting toward earnings as a benchmark of
value," says Mario Gabelli, unofficial leader of what he
calls the "media mafia," a group of hot money managers who
made a fortune in the 1980s by betting on buy-outs of movie
and cable television companies.</p>
<p>In the past year, as deal mania subsided, media stocks
have fallen by roughly 25%, and some people think they could
go lower. The go-go media investors of the 1980s are hurting,
including Mr. Gabelli, Morris Mark and Harvey Sandler.</p>
<p>"If I catch lightning in a bottle, that's great," says
analyst Emanuel Gerard of Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York,
referring to the outside chance of more media deals at high
prices. But "I wouldn't pay a nickel for assets."</p>
<p>What's more, Mr. Gerard says, the most he would pay today
for any movie stock is an average market multiple of, say, 14
times the company's estimated 1991 profit. That sounds
heretical to some, because movie stocks are glamorous and
used to sell at premium multiples. But Mr. Gerard, who worked
many years for Time Warner, thinks the industry will remain
in "a crunch period" for the next year or two. Revenue is
growing more slowly, he says, while costs for films such as
Walt Disney's "Dick Tracy" and Paramount's "The Two Jakes"
have rocketed.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Mr. Gerard rightly told clients to dump
media stocks. Now, he thinks MCA might be "worth a shot"
below 40; it was at 41 3/4 yesterday. Common shares of Time
Warner, which has loads of debt and no earnings, aren't
compelling yet, he says, though "there's some price where
your gut says buy the thing." Nor is he tempted by Paramount,
at 35 5/8.</p>
<p>Shares of cable and some cellular phone companies, also
slaughtered in the recent sell-off, are a roll of the dice,
some investors say. Like Time Warner, many other cable
concerns have tons of debt and no earnings. They also are
facing regulation and more competition, so investors aren't
sure how much cash their operations will throw off in coming
years.</p>
<p>This sea change in the way investors value media shares
caught many hot money managers off guard. Investors who buy
stocks on margin, using credit, have been hardest hit.</p>
<p>Harvey Sandler of Sandler Associates in New York says his
clients this year basically gave back all the profits he made
for them in 1989. Accounts he manages are down 25% to 45%
this year, thanks to big holdings of Tele-Communications, LIN
Broadcasting, McCaw Cellular Communications, Viacom and
Comcast.</p>
<p>Mr. Sandler, who runs about $400 million, says 1990 is
only his second down year in 10 years; in 1987, a rough year
for the market, his clients were up 30% to 70%. He is
sticking with his shares of cable and cellular companies
because their businesses are doing well, even if their stocks
aren't, he says; "I have never tried to guess the stock
market."</p>
<p>The Gabelli Value Fund has fallen 9% in the past four
weeks, and 13% this year. This fund raked in more than $1
billion from investors last September when it was launched
with fanfare and a 5.5% load charge. It has mega-stakes in
Paramount, MCA and other media stocks. The smaller, no-load
Gabelli Asset Fund is off 11% this year; by comparison,
growth-stock funds measured by the Lipper Growth Fund Index
have fallen about 7%.</p>
<p>After a string of good years from 1977 through 1989, Mr.
Gabelli says, "This year is my first down year." Through
Gamco Investors, Mr. Gabelli runs about $6 billion.</p>
<p>At Mark Partners, another once-hot manager, Mr. Mark, who
runs about $400 million, says his accounts this year are down
about as much as the overall market. He holds a lot of Walt
Disney and also cellular and cable stocks. "I'm not having
fun this quarter," Mr. Mark says, though he insists he never
bought stocks solely on asset values. In 1989, he says his
investment partners were up about 70%.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, "these managers were in the right place at
the right time," says analyst Mr. Gerard. Now they're in the
wrong place, he says, but "the hardest thing is to recognize
a sea change in values."</p>
<p>At Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette, analyst Dennis Leibowitz
won a huge following for his research on media assets. But in
the past year, he touted Time Warner, Capital Cities/ABC and
cable stocks all the way down as they cratered.</p>
<p>Last October, Mr. Leibowitz, like many analysts, told
clients to buy Time Warner, then trading at 40% of estimated
asset value. The stock then was at 134 7/8, 55 points higher
than it is now.</p>
<p>In April, Mr. Leibowitz recommended Tele-Communications,
then selling at 56% of "private market value," or the price
an acquirer might pay for the company. The stock then was at
13 3/4; after sinking as low as 9 1/2, it was at 10 3/8
yesterday. In May, Mr. Leibowitz said Comcast, at 41% of
asset value, was a buy. Since then, the stock has slid to 11
from 14 1/8.</p>
<p>Mr. Leibowitz concedes that investors now "are looking for
something else" to value cable stocks by, not just assets.
"I'm going to start putting cash flows on the front of every
cable report," he says.</p>
<p>Cable shares now are real bargains, Mr. Leibowitz adds.
Cash flow in the cable business is building and will allow
many companies to start paying their big debts, he says;
American Television & Communications should even report a
profit in 1991.</p>
<p>Many analysts still are singing the old tune about assets.
Barry Kaplan of Goldman Sachs earlier this month recommended
Tele-Communications and Comcast, which he said were trading
at "large discounts to conservative private market values."</p>
<p>Money manager Mr. Gabelli takes credit for coining the
term, "private market value." He says he first used it when,
as an analyst in the 1970s, he wrote a report on Houdaille,
later taken private by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.</p>
<p>Recently, he has raised his stakes in Chris-Craft
Industries and Paramount though, despite the rumors, "I don't
think Herb Siegel {who runs Chris-Craft} will buy Paramount."
He also has been buying MCA, below 40, and Time Warner. "I'm
convinced that a war {in the Middle East} would make these
companies even more attractive," Mr. Gabelli says;
export-oriented entertainment concerns would benefit by
translating foreign earnings into more dollars as the
currency weakened.</p>
<p>Last week, analyst David Londoner of Wertheim Schroder
recommended Time Warner common. He has been rightly bearish
on the stock till now. Based on average cash flow multiples
for movie stocks in the 1980s, he says Time Warner looks
cheap and "deserves" to trade at 110 or more.</p>
<p>But are the 1980s a good guide? Not unless movie companies
quickly find a new formula for coining money, say, selling
films to consumers on video disks, says analyst Mr. Gerard.
He thinks it could be time for the industry to rein in costs.
In 1980, making and marketing the average film cost less than
$14 million, Mr. Gerard says; now, it's more like $40
million.</p>
<p>Mr. Gabelli says that last year he foresaw the end of the
deal era. Asked why he didn't unload media shares, he says he
sometimes holds big stakes in companies for five or 10 years.
"My approach to investing is, you stick with your husband
even if he has problems."</p>
