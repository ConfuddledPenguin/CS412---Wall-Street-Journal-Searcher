	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo stocks finished higher for the third consecutive
trading day Tuesday. Buying was encouraged by bond market
firmness and oil price plunges linked to the prospect that an
immediate break-out of war will be averted in the Persian
Gulf, traders said.
   Share prices at London also increased.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As a strong overnight advance on the New York Stock
Exchange lifted sentiment, Tokyo stock prices advanced
solidly from early in the morning session. But prices
fluctuated widely in the plus side for the rest of the day as
broad gains led by dealer buying prompted profit-taking by
institutions, traders said.</p>
<p>The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues was up 569 points
at 25710.76. The index surged 976 Monday.</p>
<p>In Tokyo Wednesday, the Nikkei index retreated 206.76
points to 25504.</p>
<p>Tuesday's volume on the first section was estimated at 480
million shares, up from 352 million Monday.</p>
<p>Advancing issues outnumbered decliners, 923 to 93, and 56
remained unchanged.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index (Topix) of all issues listed
in the first section, which gained 58.87 points Monday, was
up 42.92 points, or 2.25%, at 1947.51.</p>
<p>The second section index, which advanced 49.05 points
Monday, was up 88.55 points, or 2.46%, to 3692.34. Volume in
the second section was estimated at 10 million shares, up
from 7.2 million Monday.</p>
<p>The Nikkei index advanced as high as 25913 at midmorning,
helped by active arbitrage buying by a foreign brokerage
house and by dealers buying for their own accounts. Some
investment trust funds and individual investors also helped
push up prices of blue chips, traders said.</p>
<p>The Nikkei index ended the morning session at 25660.28,
reflecting investors' caution against a fast-paced advance,
traders said.</p>
<p>Stock prices rebounded to a level near the intraday high
at midafternoon, helped by heavy buying by foreign investors,
centered on such blue-chip shares as Hitachi, Toshiba and
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. But again, the advances prompted
profit-taking by institutions, traders said.</p>
<p>Rumors that some U.S. hostages had been killed by Iraq
affected the market in the afternoon, putting it in a nervous
mood. Although the rumors were later said to be unfounded and
the impact on trading was minor, observers said the market
remains in a position in which it can be easily swayed in
either direction.</p>
<p>The recent development of political and diplomatic
negotiations has reduced fear of a confrontation in the
Middle East. But "a solution that can satisfy both Iraq and
the U.S. is unlikely to be reached soon," said Hiroyuki
Murai, general manager of stock trading at Nikko Securities.</p>
<p>Haruo Ueno, manager of stock trading at Wako Securities,
said, "Unless some clear direction becomes visible, as far as
the Middle East problem is concerned, institutions will not
buy stocks."</p>
<p>Helped by a sharp plunge of petroleum prices, whose recent
surge fueled fears of inflation, "the market mood became
slightly improved from total pessimism," said Shigeru Akiba,
of UBS Phillips & Drew International.</p>
<p>But even if the Middle East tension were eased quickly,
observers said, a further market recovery isn't easy.</p>
<p>The disappearance of the Iraqi problem would only make
investors shift their attention to high domestic interest
rates and the slowdown of the U.S. economy, said Mr. Murai of
Nikko Securities.</p>
<p>Winners Tuesday included shipbuilding companies such as
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which was up 26 yen (18 cents)
to 840 yen, and IHI, which gained 20 to 760.</p>
<p>Aluminum-related metals companies rose sharply, with
Nippon Light Metal up 100 to 1,350.</p>
<p>Among other big gainers were Misawa Homes, which advanced
240 to 2,200, and construction companies such as Kajima,
which ended at 1,500, up 50.</p>
<p>London Shares lost some of their sharp early gains Tuesday
but managed to end higher following strong rallies overseas
Monday.</p>
<p>The market, which was closed for a holiday Monday, reached
its highest point in the first half hour of trading.</p>
<p>"We were looking for a new attitude for the market this
morning following Tokyo," which rose strongly both Monday and
Tuesday, said one trader. But he added that the initial boom
proved a difficult level to sustain throughout the day.</p>
<p>Caution over the Middle East outcome continues to restrict
trading. Although the market was looking "better than
expected," one trader said, the trading level for the day was
"abysmal."</p>
<p>Another trader said "there is simply no supply or demand."</p>
<p>At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index was up 39.7 points on the day at 2126.1, below the
day's best of 2133.2 but up from the low of 2113.6.</p>
<p>The narrower FT 30-share index was up 40.6 points at
1657.4. Volume of 281.6 million shares was down from Friday's
figure of 347.7 million.</p>
<p>In the futures markets, the September FT-SE 100 index
contract was trading at 2149.0, unchanged from Friday's
close.</p>
<p>International stocks remained firm, supported by rumors of
an imminent drop in interest rates, which led the pound to
soften against some of its European counterparts. Sterling
firmed to $1.9475 from $1.9445 late Friday but fell to 3.0245
marks from 3.0277.</p>
<p>Glaxo shares jumped to 727 pence ($14.13) from 692 pence.
Unilever rose to 632 from 624.</p>
<p>Also benefiting from the interest rate speculation were
construction-related stocks. RMC firmed to 601 from 579.
Tarmac rose to 243 from 234.</p>
<p>Share prices of companies due to announce interim
statements today performed well. Ladbrokes rose 8 to 279,
Cadbury Schweppes climbed 11 to 318 and Pearson rose 9 to
694.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, stock prices closed higher in Sydney, Hong
Kong, Singapore, Wellington, Seoul, Taipei and Manila.</p>
<p>Share prices closed higher in Amsterdam, Madrid, Milan and
Stockholm and lower in Paris, Frankfurt, Zurich and Brussels.
South African gold stocks closed marginally lower.</p>
<p>Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.</p>
