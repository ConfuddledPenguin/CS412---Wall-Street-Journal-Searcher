	<p class="article-leader">Eskimo Pies are going on a diet.
   The maker of the popular 70-year-old ice cream bars this
fall will launch fat-free ice cream sandwiches made with
Monsanto Co.'s Simplesse, the first licensed product using
the fat substitute to reach the market.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Fat Freedom Eskimo Pie Sandwich is to be introduced in six
Midwestern states by October and nationally by next year. The
only other product containing the fake fat is Monsanto's
Simple Pleasures frozen dairy dessert.</p>
<p>Food industry analysts said the move should help bolster
Simplesse, which hasn't taken off as quickly as some had
expected when the Food and Drug Administration approved the
fat substitute earlier this year. "Its performance has been
mixed at best," said John McMillin, a food-industry analyst
at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.</p>
<p>Monsanto has split its efforts with Simplesse between
developing its own frozen dessert and licensing the fat
substitute to other food companies. One market that Monsanto
wants to control is so-called hard-pack ice cream, where its
Simple Pleasures frozen dessert competes. It won't license
Simplesse for use in other bulk frozen desserts.</p>
<p>In some cases, Monsanto is willing to sell exclusive
rights to Simplesse. For instance, Philip Morris Cos.' Kraft
General Foods unit has purchased exclusive rights for use of
Simplesse in the mayonnaise category, once the FDA grants
approval for that use.</p>
<p>This month, the FDA accepted Monsanto's second filing
seeking approval to use Simplesse in mayonnaise, salad
dressings and other products.</p>
<p>For Eskimo Pie, a subsidiary of Reynolds Metals Co.,
Richmond, Va., the agreement with Monsanto should be a boon.
David Clark, Eskimo Pie president, predicted that sandwich
sales will quickly top sales of its sugar-free sandwich,
which accounts for 15% of Eskimo Pie's $70 million in annual
sales. "It's a golden opportunity for us," he said.</p>
<p>Each Fat Freedom sandwich contains no fat and 130
calories, compared with six grams of fat and 180 calories in
a typical ice cream sandwich, according to Eskimo Pie
officials.</p>
<p>Eskimo Pie has tried to develop its own fat-free product,
but the product made with Simplesse tasted better: "Consumers
are demanding reduced fat foods, but they are unwilling to
sacrifice taste," Mr. Clark said.</p>
<p>Eskimo Pie's sandwich will soon face competition, though,
because Monsanto said it is negotiating with several other
makers of ice cream novelty products. Company officials won't
disclose terms of their pact with Eskimo Pie or name the
other companies that are interested in using the fat
substitute.</p>
<p>Moreover, the frozen dessert market has been crowded in
recent years as food companies from H.J. Heinz Co. to Kraft
General Foods launched low-calorie products.</p>
<p>Food analysts said Monsanto should emphasize licensing the
fake fat rather than focusing on its own product development.
"It could give them the position as a core ingredient for the
entire industry," said David Braff, president of Braff & Co.,
a New York marketing and product consulting firm. He expects
Monsanto will eventually license Simplesse to other hardpack
ice cream makers instead of focusing only on Simple
Pleasures.</p>
<p>"The taste {of Simple Pleasures} isn't winning a
tremendous amount of support," said Mr. McMillin. "When
people want to eat ice cream, they want ice cream. You can't
call this ice cream."</p>
<p>And marketing Simplesse and Simple Pleasures is a
challenge because they are new products that are unfamiliar
to consumers. Fake fat is "a hard issue to market," Mr.
McMillin said.</p>
<p>But Monsanto officials maintain that sales of the frozen
dessert have been better than expected. The Chicago area
plant that produces the dessert had to double its capacity to
keep up with demand.</p>
<p>And its advertising campaigns, which began in June and
July, have increased sales, company officials said. "Consumer
reaction has been outstanding," said David Morley, president
of Simplesse Co., a subsidiary of Monsanto Co.'s NutraSweet
unit.</p>
