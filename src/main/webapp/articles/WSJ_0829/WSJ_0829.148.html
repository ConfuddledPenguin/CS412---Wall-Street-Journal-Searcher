	<p class="article-leader">PHILADELPHIA -- The city of Philadelphia delayed its
proposed private sale of $400 million in short-term notes for
two more weeks.
   Without such a debt offering or an adjustment to spending
plans, city officials say Philadelphia could run out of money
by the end of November.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The note sale, which is already five weeks late, is now
expected to take place in mid-September.</p>
<p>Adding to Philadelphia's cash uncertainty, city controller
Jonathan A. Saidel said earlier this week he would refuse to
sign documents authorizing the loan. Although Mr. Saidel
can't block such a sale single-handedly by withholding his
signature, investors may be less willing to purchase the
notes because of his reluctance. He said he wants to cut the
size of the loan request and find a permanent solution to the
problem.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, USAir, which operates a major hub at the city's
airport, wrote to city officials objecting to a provision of
the loan documents that would allow the city to dip into
funds intended for improvements to Philadelphia International
Airport. The city's Aviation Capital fund is financing a
major expansion at the airport, including a domestic terminal
to be leased by USAir.</p>
<p>Last week, Mayor Wilson Goode said he will seek an
emergency tax increase of $150 million and ask the state for
additional aid. Philadelphia expects to post a deficit of
$206 million for the year ending June 30.</p>
