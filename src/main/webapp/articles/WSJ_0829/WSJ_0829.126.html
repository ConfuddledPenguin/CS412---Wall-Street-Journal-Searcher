	<p class="article-leader">Western Union Corp. extended its offer to swap new notes
and common shares for as much as a total $530 million of two
issues of notes.
   The exchange offer is an integral part of the Upper Saddle
River, N.J., company's recapitalization plan. Earlier this
month, the company's holders cleared the financial services
and communications company to convert its preferred shares
into common.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company extended the debt-swap offer to Sept. 7 from
this past Monday. As of Monday, note holders had tendered
$325.2 million, or 65%, of the 19.25% notes and $1.2 million,
or 3.8%, of the 16% notes outstanding. Western Union is
seeking at least 95% of the 19.25% notes and at least 80% of
the 16% issue.</p>
