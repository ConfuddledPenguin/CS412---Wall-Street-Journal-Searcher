	<p class="article-leader">BUSH BRIEFED Congress, and Iraq said captive women and
children could leave.
   While lawmakers offered their support at the White House
meeting, they said they were concerned about the effects of
the Gulf mobilization on the U.S. economy and uncertain how
the president intends to proceed. The Pentagon doubled its
cost estimate for the buildup in Saudi Arabia, and Saudi
officials said they want to buy $9 billion of U.S. arms.
Baghdad, despite its statement concerning the hostages,
declared Kuwait to be an Iraqi province. Saddam Hussein said
he was willing to talk to Bush and Britain's Thatcher via
television, but the U.S. wasn't receptive.</p>

<p>Five Security Council members urged warring factions in
Cambodia to accept a peace plan that includes a major role
for the U.N. during a transition leading to free elections. A

billion to $5 billion over two years and involve up to 10,000
peacekeeping troops and 10,000 civilian personnel.</p>
<p>Sen. Richard Lugar said he was told by Vietnamese
officials that they have removed all their troops from
Cambodia and will support elections there. The Indiana
Republican visited Hanoi this month and met with Vietnam's
foreign minister.</p>

<p>President de Klerk told South African church leaders he
would investigate black leaders' charges that police sided

kidnapping and assault charges, which he denied.</p>

<p>Leftist demonstrators hurled tomatoes and eggs at West
Germany's Kohl at a rally in East Germany, and security
guards used umbrellas to protect the chancellor. The 100
protesters whistled and shouted complaints about the high
cost of German unity as Kohl tried to address a crowd of
5,000 in Halle. The two Germanys are to merge Oct. 3.</p>

<p>Gorbachev named a Soviet magazine editor as his personal
assistant and chief spokesman. Vitaly Ignatenko, whose
weekly, New Times, has helped to forge the Kremlin leader's
policy of glasnost, or openness, is slated to give his first
news briefing today. He is expected to play a larger role in
policy-making than his predecessor.</p>

<p>President Aquino accused right-wing army rebels in the
Philippines of waging a psychological terror campaign, saying

exploded in Manila, causing no injuries, as security was
tightened at key buildings in the capital.</p>

<p>Tornadoes ripped through several northern Illinois towns,

trees and damaged vehicles.</p>

<p>The Labor Department is expected to begin inspecting large

2,500 workers.</p>

<p>The Earth is heating up faster than previously documented
and nations must agree to reduce the gases responsible for
global warming, said scientists at a conference that opened
in Sweden. The four-day meeting on climate change is expected
to adopt a report that would be a basis for U.N. action on
fighting the "greenhouse effect."</p>

<p>NASA said Magellan's mission to map the surface of Venus
is being delayed again so that engineers can study why they
keep losing contact with the spacecraft. Officials said they
now hope to start the mapping project the last week of
September, instead of the mid-September date announced
Friday. Magellan was launched in May 1989.</p>

<p>Two Liberian rebels surrendered to an African task force
and said hundreds more want to give up but fear reprisals

said. Both President Doe and another insurgent leader, Prince
Johnson, have welcomed the task force's efforts to end
Liberia's eight-month civil war.</p>

<p>Romanian authorities outlawed demonstrations in central
Bucharest following six days of anti-government unrest, but
protesters defied the order. About 100 people gathered in
University Square to denounce President Iliescu, but traffic
continued to move freely in the downtown area and there was
no massive police response.</p>
