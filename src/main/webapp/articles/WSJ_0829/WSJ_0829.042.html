	<p class="article-leader">NILES, Ohio -- RMI Titanium Co. said directors authorized
the purchase of as much as $10 million of its common stock.
The titanium products concern has 15.1 million shares
outstanding.
   At its current price, the buy-back would represent a total
of about 1.2 million shares, or 8% of the common outstanding.
RMI shares closed at $8.25, down 12.5 cents, in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. The stock has
traded as high as $13 since the company went public last
April 20.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While product orders have declined recently, "This
wouldn't appear to justify our stock price decline," L.
Frederick Gieg Jr., president and chief executive officer,
said. Because of a large backlog of orders for commercial
aircraft, he said, "We feel RMI's titanium mill product
shipments in 1991 will approach the levels of 1990."</p>
