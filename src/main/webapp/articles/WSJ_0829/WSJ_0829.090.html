	<p class="article-leader">DEATH IN THE MEDITERRANEAN</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Scientists and environmentalists in Spain warned that
dolphins in the Mediterranean were threatened by an epidemic
similar to one that killed thousands of North Sea seals two
years ago.</p>
<p>More than 50 dead dolphins have washed up on Spain's
northeast coast in the past month, and biologists at the
universities of Barcelona and Valencia said as many as 6,000
may already have died of a mysterious viral disease after
ingesting toxic substances.</p>
<p>Autopsies found high doses of polychlorinated biphenyls,
or PCBs, in the dolphins' bodies. PCBs are highly toxic
substances believed to depress the immunological system.</p>
<p>The environmental group Greenpeace said yesterday that
PCBs and other lethal substances were illegally dumped into
the sea by petrochemical plants. It urged the Spanish
authorities to ensure an immediate end to the dumping.</p>
<p>LAYOFFS AT FIAT</p>
<p>Fiat S.p.A., Italy's largest industrial group, will
temporarily lay off 35,000 of its 116,000 factory workers to
address sharper than expected declines in European auto sales
during the second quarter, a Fiat spokesman said. "The second
quarter has been far below expectations," the spokesman said.
He said the layoff plan, which involves work suspensions
ranging from one to three weeks over the next three months,
would help reduce excess production capacity.</p>
<p>AFRICAN APPEAL</p>
<p>Six African countries appealed for more money to help the
army of refugees created by civil wars in the Horn of Africa.
Foreign ministers from Kenya, Uganda, Sudan, Somalia,
Djibouti and Ethiopia made the appeal at the end of a two-day
meeting in Nairobi called to find ways of ending the
fighting. Of the six states, only Kenya and Djibouti are free
from wars. The ministers' appeal did not say how much money
was needed.</p>
<p>TWO KOREAS MEET</p>
<p>Liaison officials from North and South Korea met yesterday
at the border hamlet of Panmunjom to discuss procedures for
the proposed talks between the two countries' prime ministers
from Sept. 4 to 7 in Seoul. A spokesman for Seoul's
Unification Ministry said the chief North Korean official
accepted a draft itinerary from his southern counterpart and
agreed to reply tomorrow. The two Koreas agreed on July 26 to
hold the meetings between the prime ministers.</p>
<p>WARNING STRIKES IN EAST GERMANY</p>
<p>About 45,000 public workers in East Germany staged warning
strikes yesterday. Nurses, secretaries, bus drivers and other
municipal employees stopped working for up to two hours in at
least 10 cities. The workers want compensation for higher
prices that have resulted from the two Germanys' economic
merger. They also are demanding that East German income taxes
not be immediately raised to West German levels.</p>
<p>AUSTRIA ENDS AN IMPASSE</p>
<p>Austria agreed to gradually restore truck traffic between
West Germany and Italy that came to a halt last week. The
European Community Commission said Austria would fix a
damaged bridge at Kufstein, part of the north-south highway
through the Alps, and make two alternative roads available to
trucks. In turn, Italy and West Germany will immediately
allow Austrian trucks to cross their borders. The damaged
Kufstein bridge was closed in July. Austria opened an
alternative road, ignoring appeals to open more to
north-south truck traffic. On Friday, Italy and West Germany
retaliated by barring Austrian trucks from entering their
territories.</p>
<p>INDONESIA'S PHONE PROBLEMS</p>
<p>Sukarno Abdulrachman, Indonesia's director-general of
posts and telecommunications, told a group of businessmen and
diplomats that the nation's underinvestment in
telecommunications in previous years is now "felt as a
considerable handicap" for the economy, prospective investors
and the public.</p>
<p>Mr. Abdulrachman's comments came at a time when complaints
about telephones in Jakarta are increasing. Businessmen say
international connections are generally excellent but that
there are mounting problems completing local calls and
obtaining needed new lines.</p>
<p>The World Bank recommends that developing countries spend
between 1% and 3% of GDP on telecommunications, Mr.
Abdulrachman said, but Indonesia "for many, many years" has
spent less than 0.2%.</p>
<p>Mr. Abdulrachman said the country currently has about 1.14
million phone lines, while a study by the Japan International
Cooperation Agency concluded that it should have seven
million lines.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>Thousands cheered as a 60-foot statue of Lenin crashed to
the ground yesterday in Tbilisi, the capital of Soviet
Georgia, the news agency Iveria said. "Hundreds of people
lurched upon the statue with hammers and chisels and
immediately began chipping off souvenirs," an Iveria
correspondent reported. . . . West Germany is becoming a
tourist haven for East Bloc residents. Between 1986 and 1989,
the number of visitors from Eastern Europe spending nights in
West German hotels and other registered accommodations
increased by nearly 56%, according to a study by the
Economist Intelligence Unit. The number of nights spent by
Soviet visitors more than tripled to 265,000.</p>
