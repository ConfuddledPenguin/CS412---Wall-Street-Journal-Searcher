	<h3>Economy: Retailers Begin Belt-Tightening Early As Christmas Forecast Is Mostly Cloudy</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">With a recession looming, retailers are scrambling to trim
holiday buying plans.
   Many are ordering later than usual. They want to avoid
getting caught with too much merchandise if already-cautious
consumers start tightening up. They also hope to wring lower
prices out of jittery suppliers -- and pass the savings along
to holiday shoppers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Consider ClothesTime Inc. The off-price clothing chain,
based in Anaheim, Calif., gave its troops new marching orders
a week after Saddam Hussein sent his troops into Kuwait: Wait
until mid-September to start making commitments for most
Christmas merchandise.</p>
<p>"We're going to hold, hold, hold back," says Norman
Abramson, president.</p>
<p>Industry executives say some chains are canceling orders
for everything from apparel to televisions. Others are
considering trimming staff. But most retail executives say
they're making contingency plans to slash prices and hype
holiday bargains.</p>
<p>For shoppers, this is good news. "Manufacturers and
retailers are going to absorb any price increases," predicts
Kurt Barnard, who publishes a retail industry newsletter. "If
there's any indication that the public is staying home," he
adds, "you'll see an avalanche of sales."</p>
<p>Some retailers, in fact, are bracing for a repeat of last
fall's bloody price wars. At the time, cash-starved Campeau
Corp. units such as Bloomingdale's and Abraham & Straus
triggered a wave of discounting that buoyed sales but hurt
industry profits. Store executives fear debt-laden R.H. Macy
& Co. could be the culprit this year. Already, they note,
Macy's is discounting heavily in an apparent attempt to
pre-empt competitors with sales of fall merchandise.</p>
<p>"It's going to be a very tough Christmas," predicts retail
consultant Walter K. Levy.</p>
<p>It's already been a tough year. Sales have been sluggish
for months, especially in New York and New England. The
Campeau chains and Ames Department Stores Inc., a big
discounter, sought bankruptcy court protection. So did
Garfinckel's, an old-line department store in Washington,
D.C.</p>
<p>Some industry executives had hoped consumers would spend
more freely in the second half of the year, but that seems
unlikely now. Fears of a war in the Middle East and a
recession at home can only damp consumers' spirits at a time
when retailers can least afford it: The Christmas season
typically accounts for a third of a store's annual sales and
half of profits.</p>
<p>For small chains and independent retailers, "it will be a
make-or-break Christmas," says Thomas Tashjian, an analyst at
Seidler Amdec Securities Inc.</p>
<p>It's difficult to assess whether the Persian Gulf crisis
has hurt retailers because the chains aren't scheduled to
report August sales figures until after Labor Day. But the
Conference Board, a nonprofit research organization, says its
consumer confidence index dropped sharply in August to its
lowest level in more than seven years, suggesting that a
falloff in spending is imminent. Confidence plunged more in
August than in the period following the 1987 stock market
crash, the Conference Board says.</p>
<p>Richard L. Sharp, chief executive of Circuit City Stores
Inc., contends that some retailers are overreacting to the
crisis. But he acknowledges, "We're taking a somewhat more
conservative view."</p>
<p>J.C. Penney Co. Chairman William R. Howell's is also
circumspect. Penney, he says, is keeping "a tight rein on
costs and a close watch on inventory levels." A spokesman
acknowledges that "we're obviously going to have to be
promotional if the economy does turn softer."</p>
<p>Mr. Barnard, the newsletter publisher, sees a more ominous
trend. He says executives at more than a dozen chains have
told him privately that they're considering "the strong
likelihood" of canceling orders. Manufacturers surveyed by
Mr. Barnard also fear order cancellations, he says.</p>
<p>Bernard Brennan, chairman of Montgomery Ward & Co., says
some chains are already canceling orders. And he should know.
His holiday strategy? "Playing it very tight so we can buy
opportunistically" and offer more special deals, he says.
"There is more merchandise readily available today than there
has been in the past," he adds.</p>
<p>Some stores are tightening more than inventories. One
industry executive who requested anonymity said his chain
expects to fire 8% to 10% of its employees in the next few
weeks. "We have A, B and C plans," the executive added. "If
sales don't materialize, the next step will be another 8% to
10%."</p>
<p>For now, though, most chains are concentrating on pricing
and promotional plans. Chicago-based Montgomery Ward, which
says sales so far this month exceed last year's by 9%,
nonetheless started hyping special buys called "chairman's
choice" items four months ago. The prices are low, Mr.
Brennan says, because Montgomery Ward agrees to buy large
quantities from manufacturers at special prices. Current
chairman's choice items include sapphire rings, which the
company claims it is offering at 60% off until Sept. 19.</p>
<p>A Ward's advertising circular in this past Sunday's paper
also blasted the off-price message on every page, including
those pages devoted to back-to-school items such as jeans,
sneakers and kids' underwear that aren't usually marked down
so early.</p>
