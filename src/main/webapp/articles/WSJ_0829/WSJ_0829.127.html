	<p class="article-leader">In another blow to its reputation, Source Perrier S.A.,
Paris, bowed to European Community pressure and agreed to
stop labeling its trademark mineral water "naturally
carbonated."
   British officials had called the label misleading. When EC
officials agreed, Perrier said it would change the labels in
Europe by Nov. 1 to read "natural mineral water fortified
with gas from the spring."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The change is similar to one ordered by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration a few months ago.</p>
<p>The label problem came to light when Perrier recalled its
water early this year, after U.S. health authorities found it
contained traces of benzene, a suspected carcinogen.</p>
<p>Perrier explained that the benzene occurred naturally in
gas it added to the water from deep in its spring in southern
France. It said a dirty filter permitted the benzene to pass
into the water.</p>
<p>U.S. and European officials said that since the gas in
Perrier isn't all there naturally, the labels should be
changed.</p>
<p>Perrier officials say they still consider their water
naturally carbonated, since none of the carbon dioxide is
produced artificially. Perrier's international marketing
director Peter Thomas estimated that just under half the gas
in Perrier is added from this secondary source.</p>
