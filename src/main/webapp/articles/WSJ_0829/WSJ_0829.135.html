	<p class="article-leader">Lufthansa AG, midway through an expansion program, posted
a loss in the first half of 1990, reflecting rising costs and
currency shifts.
   The West German carrier, which is 51% state-owned,
reported a pretax loss for the parent airline of three
million German marks ($1.94 million) for the first six months
of 1990, compared with a pretax profit of 87 million marks in
the year-earlier period. Lufthansa said sales for the parent
airline rose 7% in the first half to 5.71 billion marks from
5.34 billion marks a year ago. Group sales, which include
Lufthansa's Condor charter service, the DLT short-haul
domestic carrier and hotel properties, rose 6.6% to 6.2
billion marks in the first half.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The pretax loss is Lufthansa's first reported loss since
1981.</p>
<p>The falling dollar, weakening freight business,
write-downs on equipment, rising fuel prices and other costs
have squeezed Lufthansa's profit margins as the airline
aggressively expands ahead of the deregulation of the
European airline industry in 1993.</p>
