	<p class="article-leader">MINNEAPOLIS -- Angeion Corp. said it received two patents
on a catheter it hopes to market as a cure for arrhythmia, or
irregular heartbeat.
   The catheter is designed to kill cells in the heart that
cause it to beat irregularly. The device has been tested on
dogs for more than three years. Angeion is seeking Food and
Drug Administration approval to test the catheter on human
patients.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Arrhythmia treatments include drugs, surgery and
battery-powered implants. Just as for catheters used in
angioplasty, a common treatment for hardened arteries,
Angeion's device would be inserted through the skin and
guided through a blood vessel into the heart. There, after
determination of the location of the cells causing the
arrhythmia, the catheter would be attached to the wall of the
heart and deliver a small amount of laser energy to the
problem cells. As in angioplasty, the procedure would be
performed while a patient was awake, and wouldn't require
surgery.</p>
<p>Wendell King, Angeion chairman and chief executive
officer, said the potential market for the device is in the
hundreds of millions of dollars. He said the procedure would
cost $6,000 to $10,000, less than that for surgery and
implants.</p>
