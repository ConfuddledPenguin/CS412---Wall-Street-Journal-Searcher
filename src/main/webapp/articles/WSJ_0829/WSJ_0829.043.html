	<p class="article-leader">LONG BEACH, Calif. -- Life Protecting Systems Inc. wants
to "take the terror out of aviation." But some believe it
puts the fear into investing, instead.
   Promoted by a former computer-equipment salesman named
Landon Tinder, the small start-up company is trying to market
the ultimate in safe airliner seating: egg-shaped titanium
pods, each containing two to eight passenger seats, that
would fit into an airplane fuselage.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Should the plane start to go down, the door of each pod
would close to seal the passengers against a sudden loss of
cabin pressure, flames, smoke, flying objects and even
impact. The way Mr. Tinder sees it, the pods -- collectively
called the aeronautical life-preserving security system, or
ALPS -- are about to take his company soaring into a $20
billion market.</p>
<p>A lot of folks take him seriously. The science magazine
Omni said in an article on "Accessing the Future" that ALPS
"could become standard on commercial airplanes by 1991." The
national television show "Hard Copy" and a number of West
Coast radio and TV stations and newspapers have publicized
him. More than 130 stockholders and other investors have
risked $1.5 million on the privately held company.</p>
<p>And why not? After all, says Mr. Tinder, Boeing Co. has
"indicated a lot of interest in the project." McDonnell
Douglas Corp. "has indicated to us completely that they are
considering the concept of the closure cell," perhaps on the
MD-12X, a version of its popular wide-body tri-jet now under
study. In all, according to a business plan developed last
year, Life Protecting Systems anticipated having orders for
more than $24 million of ALPS by now.</p>
<p>But so far, all the company has sold is securities.</p>
<p>Boeing officials say they can't recall having ever spoken
to Mr. Tinder or his colleagues. McDonnell Douglas says it
wants nothing to do with Mr. Tinder, even though Lawrence
Skantze, a retired Air Force general, wrote to Robert Hood,
president of McDonnell Douglas's commercial aircraft
division, on ALPS's behalf.</p>
<p>"Frankly," says Gen. Skantze, who was enlisted by Mr.
Tinder through a friend of a friend, "Bob wrote me back and
told me he was very skeptical. And he was angry that Tinder
was pushing so hard without having enough engineering
detail."</p>
<p>Though one of Mr. Tinder's many press releases asserts
that Japan Air Lines intends to install the ALPS system in
its fleet within three years, a JAL spokesman says the
airline isn't remotely interested. And while Mr. Tinder says
Federal Aviation Administration chief scientist Albert
Lupinetti is "supporting this product," Mr. Lupinetti
responds: "You can't help but get the feeling there is more
hype than engineering work at play here."</p>
<p>Most recently, Mr. Tinder suggested that Hexcel Corp., a
major aerospace supplier, "might offer us the option to be
bought by them, or, of course, they might invest." But Andy
Hegedus, who handles technology acquisition at Hexcel, says
that after briefly reviewing ALPS, "let me put it to you this
way: I'm not exactly jumping up and down about the idea."</p>
<p>Airlines and aircraft makers are reluctant to attack any
safety proposal publicly. But an airline design specialist
says Mr. Tinder's 234-pound pods, even if perfected, would
turn a jetliner into "a lead sled." She suggests that adding
such weight, which would require reducing passenger loads,
runs counter to industry efforts to cut weight and increase
capacity.</p>
<p>Mr. Tinder dismisses the nay-saying. "It's all very
political," he says. "It's like the automobile. Look how hard
it was to get seat belts in them."</p>
<p>So Life Protecting Systems presses ahead. Mr. Tinder aims
to raise $5 million, partly from the public sale of stock
within California, and eventually to get the shares listed
nationally over-the-counter. When an airline accident occurs,
his publicity machine steps up its barrage of press releases.
"We would have even saved lives over Lockerbie," Mr. Tinder
says, referring to the terrorist bombing over Scotland that
killed all aboard.</p>
<p>"They may raise public money, but in the end they're just
going to raise public ire," asserts Jim Greene, a science
consultant for the House subcommittee on transportation,
aviation and materials. Mr. Tinder appeared before the panel
last March, but disappointed lawmakers when he acknowledged
that ALPS wasn't as fire-resistant as they'd been led to
believe, according to Mr. Greene.</p>
<p>"What's really a shame is that Tinder may actually have an
abstract concept that should be looked at seriously," he
says. "He's cutting his own throat needlessly." Mr. Tinder's
contention that his system would have saved lives at
Lockerbie particularly irritates the congressional adviser.
"That sort of claim defies physics," says Mr. Greene, a Ph.D.
who has taught the subject in college.</p>
<p>Mr. Tinder has his own Ph.D.s to call on. Several years
ago, his father, an engineering professor at Washington State
University, asked colleagues to help with the pod design.
"It'll do what it's advertised to do," contends Jack
Kimbrell, who taught there for 32 years and developed the
pod's retracting door.</p>
<p>"Besides being a life-saver, this is a good business to be
in," adds George Fukuda, a staff engineer at TRW Inc.'s
aerospace division. He says he has invested "well into six
figures" in Life Protecting Systems and is acting on his own
time as its chairman and chief executive officer. Mr. Tinder
is president.</p>
<p>Mr. Tinder's success in winning seed capital and converts
may stem from a very real public concern about air safety. A
Gallup poll last year found that 63% of Americans had "lost
confidence" in the safety of airlines. Nearly a quarter of
travelers, according to an earlier Boeing study, are anxious
when flying.</p>
<p>Mr. Tinder, born in Berkeley, Calif., says he attended
Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa for three years but didn't
graduate. He sold computer hardware for a number of companies
before he began developing the pod idea five years ago.</p>
<p>He says other investors include technicians from TRW,
General Motors Corp.'s Hughes Aircraft division and McDonnell
Douglas. In addition to money, he says, this talent has given
the company about 10,000 hours of engineering work, worth
$2.5 million, in exchange for 1.86 million shares of Life
Protecting Systems stock.</p>
<p>Mr. Tinder, who earns $100,000 a year in salary, owns
41.3% of the company's 3.66 million shares. Life Protecting
Systems claims 11 employees, including part-timers. With
additional financing, Mr. Tinder maintains, it could produce
250 ALPS systems a year by 1991 and 3,000 a year by 1994,
when it would have two factories.</p>
<p>Today, a half-scale ALPS mockup sits in the lobby of the
company's plush offices here. Computers fill other rooms,
with monitors displaying 900 engineering drawings of the
system. Copies of articles about air accidents plaster the
walls of a conference room, where blueprints for a factory
lie rolled up on the table.</p>
<p>Mr. Tinder, 30, is tanned, well-coifed, dresses in
double-breasted suits and sports a gold bracelet and rings.
He exudes confidence, even when discussing his invention's
apparent shortcomings. He concedes that an airline would have
to pay $25,000 a seat with an ALPS system, twice the cost of
conventional seats, and seating capacity would drop as much
as 30%.</p>
<p>Says John Enders, president of the nonprofit Flight Safety
Foundation in Washington, D.C.: "If you wanted to design a
cubicle that would guarantee survival for human beings in
almost any situation, you could do it. But you're going to do
it at a great cost."</p>
<p>But Mr. Tinder purports to have all the answers. He says
cutting deaths and injuries from crashes would also cut
airlines' legal bills and insurance costs, and, in the end,
increase their profits. And, he asks, won't the public clamor
for a system that has a breathe-through air bag and its own
oxygen supply, can withstand heat up to 2,800 degrees
Fahrenheit and has a seat that's more than three times as
shock-resistant as current standards -- all while providing
the comfort of a La-Z-Boy?</p>
<p>"We want to be very careful and very conservative," Mr.
Tinder says. "We're not trying to hype things. It's just a
matter of when it will happen."</p>
