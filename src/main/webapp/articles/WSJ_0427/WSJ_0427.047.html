	<p class="article-leader">ST. LOUIS -- Pulitzer Publishing Co.'s flagship St. Louis
Post-Dispatch paper has regained its monopoly as the city's
sole daily, following the failure of the upstart St. Louis
Sun.
   But the day after the late-afternoon announcement of the
Sun's fate, Pulitzer shares fell 25 cents to close at $27.25.
Analysts said the market's indifferent reaction reflected
just how little of a factor the Sun actually was, in
comparison to the ongoing softness in advertising sales that
is plaguing the Post-Dispatch, along with many other
newspapers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Kenneth F. Cook, an analyst with Burns, Pauli & Co. in St.
Louis, said, "I think an awful lot of the Sun's demise was in
the stock already. There was an expectation that this thing
wasn't working, that it was only a matter of time" before
Ingersoll Newspapers Inc. folded the Sun. The Sun began
printing in September and lasted only seven months.</p>
<p>In recent quarters, Pulitzer has conceded that the new
competition had helped push down Post-Dispatch earnings,
although the media concern has stressed that a weak
advertising market played a bigger role. Largely because of
the downturn at the Post-Dispatch, Pulitzer's earnings for
the first quarter tumbled 70% to $906,000, or nine cents a
share, from the year-earlier $3 million, or 29 cents.</p>
<p>The Sun's "impact has been primarily on {Pulitzer's} cost
side" in terms of promotional and other efforts to counter
the new competitor, said Mr. Cook. He noted that the Sun
never hurt circulation at the Post-Dispatch, and said it's
unclear just how many ad dollars it had drawn from the
Post-Dispatch.</p>
<p>At least for now, Mr. Cook said, he is holding to his
earlier projection that Pulitzer will have per-share earnings
of about $1.40 for the current year. In 1989, the company had
earnings of $31.4 million, or $3 a share, but the figures
were boosted by a net $12.7 million gain from sale of a
broadcasting property.</p>
<p>A.G. Edwards analyst Michael Kupinski said, "Advertising
support for the Sun wasn't that significant." The Post's
recent earnings declines "have been 60% the result of the
economy, 40% the Sun," he said. Although "when you return to
a monopoly status, that's always good" because of the
increased leverage over advertising rates, he doubted there's
much near-term advantage to be gleaned from the death of the
Sun. "Looking forward," however, "it's a positive" for
Pulitzer, he said.</p>
