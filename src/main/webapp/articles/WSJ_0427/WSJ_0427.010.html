	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Stinu Corp. of America, a unit of J.C. Penney
Co., said it signed an international franchise agreement for
Units stores with Miki Corp. of Japan, an operator of retail
specialty stores. The value of the pact wasn't disclosed, and
officials couldn't be reached for comment.
   Under the agreement, Miki will open 20 Units stores in
Japan in four years and 100 in all. Units stores, with more
than 200 locations in the U.S., sell interlocking knit
separates for women. Last year, the Penney subsidiary opened
its first foreign stores in Britain, Canada and Mexico.</p>
