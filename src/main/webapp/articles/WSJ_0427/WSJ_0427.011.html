	<p class="article-leader">Nomura Securities Co. filed a libel suit in London against
the author and the publisher of a book that it claims depicts
the world's largest brokerage firm as engaging in various
improper securities practices.
   The suit claims that "The House of Nomura, The Rise to
Supremacy of the World's Most Powerful Company" by Albert J.
Alletzhauser falsely depicts Nomura as engaging in insider
trading, lying to and cheating clients and manipulating the
Japanese stock market.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The suit also contends that the book libeled Nomura by
portraying the Japanese firm as using confidential
information to benefit its senior staff, training its sales
force to psychologically pressure vulnerable clients, and
paying money to gangsters, extortionists and blackmailers to
cover up illegal acts.</p>
<p>The suit, filed Wednesday in the High Court of Justice,
Queens Bench Division, seeks an injunction to restrain Mr.
Alletzhauser and the publisher, Bloomsbury Publishing Ltd.,
from publishing or repeating the "said or any similar
libels."</p>
<p>The book was published in mid-January in Britain.
Bloomsbury says it was the No. 1 best seller in Britain in
early February. It is scheduled to be released in the U.S.
and Japan next month.</p>
<p>Some Nomura executives worry that the publicity
surrounding the case could hurt the company, especially at a
time when there is considerable tension between Japan and the
West over the growing influence of Japanese financial
institutions around the world.</p>
<p>"I feel this is a major mistake," said one Nomura
executive. Some executives in New York and London are
especially puzzled by it, particularly since the book was
published several months ago, and presumably sales would be
expected to have slackened off with time.</p>
<p>But Yoshihisa Tabuchi, Nomura's president, said in Tokyo
last week that if Nomura failed to take any action against
the book, it would have "meant Nomura admitted the existence"
of illegal acts that he says are described in the book.</p>
<p>Some Nomura employees speculate that the firm may be
hoping to stop publication in the bigger Japanese and U.S.
markets and deter other potentially critical books on the
firm from being published. One Nomura executive said that
Nomura's British lawyers, Linklaters & Paines, even advised
against bringing action.</p>
<p>In late February, lawyers for Nomura in London wrote to
Mr. Alletzhauser and his publisher, threatening to sue them
unless they agreed to immediately pull the book off the
market, paid damages, made a public apology and agreed not to
disseminate any further "defamatory statements concerning
Nomura."</p>
<p>In subsequent negotiations, Nomura's lawyers said the
company was willing to drop the threatened suit if the author
made certain changes in the book, Mr. Alletzhauser said in an
interview. He and the publisher countered with an offer to
let Nomura "put an errata sheet in back of each future copy
sold in the U.K. explaining what they found was wrong," Mr.
Alletzhauser said. "They rejected my offer," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Alletzhauser said that he never defamed Nomura. "For
them to be suing me is out of character with the nature of
the book. It was written as a history of the firm and not
meant to be combative at all," he said.</p>
<p>British libel law is much stricter than its American
counterpart. In the U.S., writers charged with libel against
public figures needn't prove that any defamatory statements
are true. Libel defendants merely need to show that they were
reasonably careful to check facts. But in England, writers
ordinarily must prove the truth of any factual allegations
they make. And writers making defamatory comments -- for
example, suggesting someone isn't fit to hold a certain job
-- must prove in court a factual basis for the comments.</p>
<p>Mr. Alletzhauser, 30 years old, is an American living in
London. He is a principal of Tiedemann International
Research, a London-based stockbrokerage firm.</p>
