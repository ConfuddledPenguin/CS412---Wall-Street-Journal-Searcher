	<p class="article-leader">MIAMI -- Citizens Savings Financial Corp. said it sued two
federal agencies for breach of contract involving Citizens'
acquisition of an Illinois thrift.
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington,
charges that the U.S. government broke an agreement made with
the company when Citizens acquired American Savings Bank, a
failing thrift, in December 1988.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>According to Citizens, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board
and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. agreed to
provide financial assistance to Citizens, including a cash
contribution, when it made the acquisition. That cash
contribution -- $86 million -- was to be credited to
Citizens' regulatory capital account and amortized over 25
years.</p>
<p>In 1989, however, those two federal agencies were
abolished under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery
and Enforcement Act. With the passage of that act, according
to Citizens, all previous regulatory agreements were voided
-- including Citizens' ability to count $86 million toward
its capital account.</p>
<p>Citizens filed its suit against the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. and the Office of Thrift Supervision, the
successors to the two abolished agencies. Citizens said it is
asking the court to declare that the Financial Institutions
Reform Act resulted in a breach of contract and, thus, took
Citizens' property without just compensation and due process
in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The suit also seeks an
injunction prohibiting enforcement of those provisions of the
act that breached the original agreement.</p>
<p>Officials at OTS said they hadn't seen the suit and
couldn't comment. The FDIC said that while it also hadn't
seen the litigation, it believes the spirit of the act is
correct.</p>
<p>Citizens is a $4 billion, five-state federal savings bank,
with 92 offices in Florida, Illinois, Ohio, California and
Virginia.</p>
