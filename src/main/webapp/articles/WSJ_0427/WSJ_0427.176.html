	<p class="article-leader">Rising demand for industrial materials signals a stronger
manufacturing pace than some people expected.
   U.S. manufacturing hit a recent bottom in January, when a
majority of the nation's auto plants closed for several weeks
to reduce inventories, and many other factories also
throttled back. Now manufacturing executives say business is
coming back surprisingly briskly, although it will be some
months before the order upturn bolsters profits.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Business is picking up across the board," says Joseph H.
Stegmeyer, vice president and chief financial officer at
Worthington Industries Inc., Columbus, Ohio. "Orders are
strong at all nine locations across the country where we
process and distribute steel." In Columbus, Worthington's
plants are operating six or seven days a week to keep up.</p>
<p>The upturn has boosted operating rates at the nation's
steel mills to nearly 90% of capacity, from 78% during
January. And it isn't only steel. Demand has improved for a
wide range of other industrial products as well, ranging from
castings to computer chips.</p>
<p>Dow Chemical Co., Midland, Mich., reports strong demand
for its polyethylene and polystyrene plastics, as well as for
caustic and other basic chemicals. Nuts and bolts, truck
tires, anti-friction bearings and other manufactured items
used primarily by industry are doing much better, too.</p>
<p>"I'm really pretty bullish," says Michael K. Evans, a
Washington, D.C., economic consultant. "Industrial production
will rise at a 4% annual rate for the balance of the year,"
he forecasts, bolstered by strong exports and higher business
spending for facilities and equipment. By contrast,
industrial production rose only 1% over the past 12 months.</p>
<p>To be sure, Mr. Evans is more optimistic than most. Some
economists worry that we're seeing mainly an auto-related
uptick rather than a basic change. Factory jobs declined by
69,000 in the first quarter, says Maury Harris, chief
economist for PaineWebber Inc.</p>
<p>"It's too early to say manufacturing has turned the
corner." He expects industrial output to edge up at only a 1%
to 2% annual rate for the rest of the year, because he
foresees little, if any, further recovery in auto production
and "weak demand for anything related to construction" or
home sales.</p>
<p>While the National Association of Purchasing Management's
manufacturing index -- which includes orders, production,
inventories and other factors -- rose in March to the highest
level since last June, it remained below the point that would
indicate manufacturing was expanding.</p>
<p>Furthermore, many manufacturers are reporting sharply
lower first-quarter profits, partly because prices of many
industrial products remain well below year-ago levels.
Despite another round of employment cuts and other
cost-reduction measures, earnings for all of 1990 are likely
to fall, many economists say, the second consecutive year of
decline.</p>
<p>Buoyant demand in 1987, 1988 and early 1989 encouraged
producers to launch plant expansions and buy equipment to
relieve production bottlenecks. Some of that new capacity in
paper, plastics and other materials is coming into production
this year, holding down prices in spite of improving demand.
Meanwhile, wages, salaries and employee benefits are about 5%
higher this year.</p>
<p>Increased international competition also limits the
ability of manufacturers to pass along cost increases,
"eroding corporate profits," says Theodore H. Tung, senior
vice president and economist for National City Bank of
Cleveland. "This isn't like the 1970s when U.S. companies
could charge whatever they wanted when demand picked up."</p>
<p>Still, there's been a noticeable improvement in
manufacturing, partly reflecting the rebound in auto
production. Auto assemblies in the first quarter plunged to
less than 1.5 million, 23% below a year earlier, slashing
orders for steel, tires, glass and a host of other industrial
products. For the second quarter, however, auto makers expect
to turn out nearly 1.8 million cars, down a more modest 8.2%
from a year ago. Truck output will be almost flat with the
1989 second quarter and 21% above the first three months,
according to industry sources.</p>
<p>While auto sales aren't booming, auto makers are keeping a
sharp eye on inventories, and nobody expects widespread plant
closings such as occurred last January. And auto makers won't
suddenly turn off the order faucet in a massive inventory
correction.</p>
<p>Wagner Castings, a Decatur, Ill., automotive foundry, has
bounced back to near-capacity operation, after dropping to
about 50% from December through March. However, "we don't
know how much of current output is going to refill the
pipelines," says Ross D. Lake, executive vice president and
chief operating officer of Sudbury, Inc., Wagner's parent.</p>
<p>But the manufacturing recovery goes well beyond the auto
industry. Non autodependent businesses such as plastic
resins, electronic parts and oil field equipment are showing
improvement, producers say.</p>
<p>At Worthington, "our Chicago plant's orders are up very
strongly, and they don't do a lot of auto business," says Mr.
Stegmeyer. "Our South Carolina plant, which sells large
amounts of steel to producers of lawn and garden and
electrical equipment, also is up strongly." Overall,
Worthington's March orders were higher than the year
earlier's healthy levels, he says.</p>
<p>For Timken Co.'s roller bearings, the auto market, while
improving, is one of the weaker spots, says Joseph S. Toot
Jr., president of the Canton, Ohio, bearings and specialty
steels concern. But because many other industries have picked
up, "we're enjoying a higher level of business than we
anticipated."</p>
<p>Akron, Ohio-based B.F. Goodrich Co. has sold out
practically its full polyvinyl chloride capacity for the next
few months, says Don Knechtges, vice president, marketing and
business management, for the vinyl division. Demand has been
better than anticipated, putting the vinyl division "into a
pretty snug position." PVC is a basic plastic material used
for pipe, siding, wire insulation and a host of other
applications.</p>
<p>As one indication of the PVC turnabout, Goodrich in the
past few weeks was able to put through a price increase of
three cents a pound, or nearly 10%, and plans another
two-cent rise for May. However, that would recover only about
half the price drop that occurred in the previous nine
months.</p>
<p>Materials producers say they're confident customers are
buying for immediate use rather than to build inventory. "We
have many orders with very short lead times -- they need the
material now," says Worthington's Mr. Stegmeyer.</p>
<p>In fact, the order upturn in part reflects the end of
inventory cutting. Companies started building stocks and
placing multiple orders for materials in late 1988 or early
1989, when prices were soaring and shortages appeared to be
developing. But they quickly cut orders in the 1989 second
half, when the economic slowdown turned those hedge buys into
excess inventory.</p>
<p>Now stocks have returned to relatively low levels. The
Commerce Department reported last week that business
inventories in February shrank to 1.48 months' shipments,
from 1.51 months in January and 1.49 months a year earlier.</p>
<p>Some manufacturers may have cut too deeply. RB&W Corp., a
Mentor, Ohio, fastener manufacturer, is working overtime at
some plants to meet urgent delivery requests, says John J.
Lohrman, chairman and chief executive officer. Only six weeks
ago RB&W was working 32-hour weeks, because customers weren't
ordering nuts and bolts. "Some of our customers apparently
overdid" the inventory cutting, and are asking for
accelerated deliveries now, he says.</p>
