	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Production by Japan's mines and factories in
March rose 0.7% from a year earlier and 2.6% from the
previous month, the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry said, noting production of a wide range of goods was
strong because of sustained economic growth.
   Japan's economy, drawing strength from domestic demand
such as corporate investment in plant and equipment, has been
expanding steadily for 41 months in a row. The industrial and
mining production index for March stood at 131.9, while it
was 123.7 after adjustment for seasonal factors; the year
1985 equals 100.</p>
