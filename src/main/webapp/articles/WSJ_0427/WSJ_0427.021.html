	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Television viewers in France and West
Germany will soon be able to tune in to "Rambo: First Blood,
Part II" and "Rambo III."
   Carolco Pictures Inc. said it signed two television
agreements with companies in the two European countries for
the rights to broadcast past, current and future Carolco
movies, including the Rambo series, for a total of more than
$50 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company also said it plans to announce soon a similar
agreement for television broadcast rights in Spain. Carolco,
which has interests in feature films, television
broadcasting, and video and audio retailing, had 1989 profit
of $14 million, or 46 cents a share, on revenue of $143
million.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the company said the bulk of the $50
million from the two agreements will be paid before year end.</p>
<p>As the international market for entertainment products has
expanded, many studios have moved aggressively to sell the
television rights to their movies overseas, particularly in
Europe and Japan. Carolco previously sold the television
rights only to a few films individually overseas.</p>
<p>"Carolco has been the only independent or major
{entertainment company} that has held back their library from
foreign television sales," said Jeff Logsdon, an analyst at
Crowell, Weedon & Co. "Most companies are doing foreign
sales, and it's healthy for these guys."</p>
<p>Carolco's agreement with Hermes Synchron of West Germany
includes 34 feature films covering broadcast rights in West
Germany, East Germany, Austria and the German-speaking
territories of Switzerland and Luxembourg. The package
includes the Rambo series, as well as "Angel Heart" and "Red
Heat," among others, and future pictures.</p>
<p>The accord with Aries S.A. of France covers 34 titles,
including "Field of Dreams" and "Music Box." Carolco said
Canal Plus, a pay-television service in France, will
broadcast the films under a separate agreement with Aries.</p>
<p>Carolco has a total of 80 films in its domestic library,
including 40 titles acquired from Hemdale Corp., another
entertainment concern. Of the total, Carolco holds the
foreign distribution rights, including television rights, to
about 30 films.</p>
<p>Carolco aquired Orbis, a domestic television syndication
company, in August 1987.</p>
<p>Carolco shares closed at $11.25, up 12.5 cents, in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.</p>
