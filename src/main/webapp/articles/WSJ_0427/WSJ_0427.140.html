	<p class="article-leader">Over-the-counter investors played their cards close to the
vest as they waited for today's quarterly report on the gross
national product, traders said.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index closed up 0.50 at 421.06, a
0.1% gain. Volume remained thin at 115.9 million shares, down
from 121.7 million shares. Advancing stocks again outpaced
decliners, 954 to 850. However, 133 shares hit new lows,
outpacing the 81 stocks that reached new highs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"A lot of people were sidelined waiting for the GNP
numbers," said Mitch Meisler, director of OTC marketing for
Shearson Lehman Hutton. Mr. Meisler, who said he continues to
think that the stock and bond markets are headed for a rally,
called yesterday's action "sloppy, with no real trends."</p>
<p>Business among institutional investors picked up at
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, according to Robert Antolini,
head of the firm's OTC trading department. But he noted that
investors didn't place big bets among the most active stocks,
where prices were relatively stable. Among the most heavily
traded issues, Apple was up 1/8 at 38 7/8; Intel was up 1/4
at 40; Sun Microsystems gained 3/8 to 23; MCI Communications
rose 5/8 to 35 3/8; and Seagate Technology rose 1/4 to 11.</p>
<p>Smaller investors continued to stay away from the market,
Mr. Antolini said. "It's the state of the securities business
at the moment," he explained. "Most of the retail orders now
have their money in mutual funds and let other people make
their decisions for them."</p>
<p>Stockholder Systems of Norcross, Ga., was the day's
biggest gainer. Shares of the marketer of financial software
soared 51% to 14 after the company said it agreed to be
acquired by Nynex, the New York-based Baby Bell company.
Under a pooling transaction, each Stockholder Systems share
will be exchanged for one share of Nynex common worth between
$15 to $16.20.</p>
<p>Two small biotechnology companies, Centocor and Xoma,
again stepped into the spotlight as debate continued over
which company will benefit the most from competing drugs they
are developing to treat septic shock syndrome.</p>
<p>Centocor jumped 3 1/2 to 33 1/4 after Kidder Peabody
analyst Robert Kupor upgraded his investment opinion on the
biotechnology company to an "aggressive buy" from a "hold."
Mr. Kupor said in an interview that he thinks Centocor's
Centoxin will be used by far more doctors to treat septic
shock syndrome than a competing drug, Xomen-E5, developed by
Berkeley, Calif.-based Xoma, whose shares fell 1 1/8 to 18
3/4.</p>
<p>Calling Centoxin far more effective in treating later,
deadlier stages of the syndrome, Mr. Kupor said he now thinks
the company will eventually capture about 75% of a world-wide
market for the drugs that he estimates will be $1 billion.
The analyst raised his earnings outlook for the Malvern,
Penn.-based company, and now expects Centocor to earn $1.45 a
share in 1991, $3.85 a share in 1992 and $5 a share in 1993.</p>
<p>However, Shearson's Mr. Meisler said that firm's
biotechnology analyst, Teena L. Lerner, continues to think
that Xoma will come out on top in competition with Centocor.</p>
<p>Phoenix-based Aztar was a newcomer among the most-actives.
Nearly 1.1 million of the casino operator's shares traded, or
about three times average volume; it closed up 3/8 at 6 3/8.
Paul E. Rubeli, president and chief executive, said in an
interview that the company expects to report a first-quarter
revenue gain of about 5.5%. Recently spun off from Ramada,
Aztar said casino revenues were up about 9% for the quarter.</p>
<p>Aldus climbed 2 1/2 to 20. The Seattle, Wash., maker of
desktop publishing software reported net income for the first
quarter ended March 30 of 27 cents a share, down from 33
cents a year earlier. The earnings were no worse than
expected, one market maker said. He explained that shares had
been under pressure because of fears of especially
disappointing figures.</p>
<p>Shares of Star States dove 33.3% to 3 1/2. The Wilmington,
Del., thrift holding company told shareholders Wednesday that
it expects to post a loss of $3.7 million in the first
quarter and will indefinitely suspend its regular quarterly
dividend of 10 cents a share, according to Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report.</p>
<p>First Constitution Financial of New Haven, Conn., tumbled
5/8 to 3 7/8 after canceling merger talks with GHKM Investor
Group. The thrift also suspended its dividend payments and
reported a loss for the first quarter ended March 31 of $3.60
a share, compared with net income of 40 cents a share a year
earlier. The quarter includes a $80.6-million provision for
loan losses.</p>
<p>Concurrent Computer's shares fell 1/4 to 2 1/8 after the
Tinton Falls, N.J., company reported that "difficult market
conditions" might make it tough for Concurrent "to match our
third-quarter results" reported yesterday. Net income for the
third quarter, ended March 31, was one cent a share, compared
with a loss of 49 cents a year earlier, which included
extraordinary items.</p>
<p>Shares of Infotron Systems dropped 1/2 to 5 after the
Cherry Hill, N.J., maker of data communications equipment
reported a loss for the first quarter ended March 31 of $1.41
a share, compared with year-earlier net income of 20 cents a
share.</p>

<p>OTC BULLETIN BOARD: The Securities and Exchange Commission
is expected to approve today a long-awaited automated
quotation system for thinly traded stocks, SEC officials
said.</p>
<p>Known as the OTC Bulletin Board, the system has been
awaiting SEC approval for two years.</p>
<p>The National Association of Securities Dealers, the
self-regulatory body for the OTC market, created the new
system to supervise better the trading and pricing of the
11,000 small stocks, so-called Pink Sheet stocks, that aren't
part of the Nasdaq computer system. The Nasdaq system gives
up-to-the-minute quotes on more than 4,000 OTC securities.
But the small stocks' quotes have been available just once a
day, either electronically or printed in the Pink Sheets by
the National Quotation Bureau, a unit of Commerce Clearing
House Inc., Riverwoods, Ill.</p>
<p>The OTC Bulletin Board will provide intraday bid and asked
quotes on the smaller stocks. It is expected to be operating
by early summer, NASD officials said.</p>
