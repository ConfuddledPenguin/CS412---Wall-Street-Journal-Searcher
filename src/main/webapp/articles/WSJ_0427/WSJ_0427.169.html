	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Construction contracting grew 4% in March from
February, reversing a five-month slide that had been heavily
concentrated in the Northeast, F.W. Dodge said.
   The gain stemmed from a 15% rise in nonresidential
projects -- commercial, industrial and institutional building
-- said the forecasting division of publisher McGraw-Hill
Inc. The value of residential building, which includes
single-family and apartment units, slipped 2%; while
so-called non-building construction -- public works and
utilities -- eased 1%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Institutional building, the nonresidential sector that
includes schools and health-care facilities, continued
strong, rising 29% in March.</p>
<p>But office construction, included under the commercial
heading, "has been declining for four years and is still on
the way down," said George A. Christie, vice president and
chief economist at Dodge. "It's the single most overbuilt
category of construction since the mid-'80s boom, and it's
going to be the longest one to dig it's way out."</p>
<p>March construction equaled a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of $244.98 billion, compared with $235.97 billion, in
February.</p>
<p>Dodge reported that its index grew to 156 in March, from
150 in February. The index, a seasonally adjusted leading
indicator of construction, uses a base of 100, which was set
in 1982.</p>
<p>The value of first-quarter construction fell 6%, from
first-quarter 1989, Dodge reported, to an unadjusted $52.65
billion, from $56.11 billion.</p>
<p>Despite the overall gain in non-residential building, the
Northeast and South still lagged behind first-quarter 1989 in
construction -- contracting value by 25% and 8%,
respectively, Dodge said. In the North Central region and the
West, construction gained 5% and 3%, respectively.</p>
