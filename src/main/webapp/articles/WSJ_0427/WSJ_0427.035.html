	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. said it expects
earnings to grow by at least 18% a year for the next three
years and even faster after 1992.
   The pharmaceutical company, formed by the merger last year
of Bristol-Myers and Squibb, told securities industry
analysts Wednesday that it expected to eliminate earnings
dilution caused by the merger by the end of 1991, largely
because of significant savings from combining the companies'
operations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts who attended the all-day session said the
company's profit outlook was especially strong. Some analysts
said they were impressed by the speed with which the company
was merging the two businesses and gaining benefits from the
merged operations. "I was very pleased by the presentations,"
said Frederic Greenberg, a partner with EGS Partners, a
money-management fund. The company's officials "have a
beautiful story to tell" regarding the earnings outlook.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Bristol-Myers Squibb shares rose $2.125 to $54.875,
reflecting the analysts' enthusiasm. Nearly 2.1 million
shares changed hands.</p>
<p>Specifically, the company told analysts that per-share
earnings in 1990 will rise to between $3.25 and $3.30. Sales
are expected to rise about 10%, the company said. In 1989,
Bristol-Myers earned $747 million, or $1.43 a share,
including a $693 million charge related to the merger. Sales
totaled $9.2 billion. The company told analysts it expected
per-share earnings to increase to about $3.85 in 1991 and
about $4.50 in 1992.</p>
<p>Michael Autera, the company's chief financial officer,
told analysts that beyond 1992, Bristol-Myers Squibb's
"sustainable growth" would rise by an even higher rate. He
said the company expects to save enough money from merging
operations to make up the $693 million charge. He said the
company expected to save $110 million this year, $290 million
in 1991 and $390 million in 1992, mostly by reducing the
combined companies' manufacturing plants to 30 from 62 and by
operational staff reductions. "The savings are coming very
fast. It's a very good sign," said Ronald Nordmann, an
analyst with PaineWebber Inc.</p>
<p>Mr. Nordmann said the company already is benefiting from
the two companies' combined sales force. It expects sales of
its heart drug Corgard, which were flat at $150 million in
1989, to rise in 1990 because of the larger sales force.
Sales from the company's pharmaceutical operations are
expected to rise about 16% to $5.1 billion from $4.4 billion
in 1989.</p>
<p>The company said it expected its pharmaceutical research
and development budget to rise 18% to $775 million, putting
it second in size to spending by Merck & Co., which expects
to spend about $855 million for research in 1990.</p>
<p>Analysts said they were impressed by the number of drugs
in the company's research pipeline. The company said it was
in advanced stages of testing an anti-depression drug that
would compete with Eli Lilly & Co.'s big-selling drug Prozac.
The company also said it expects to seek approval later this
year from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its
anti-viral drug Videx. The drug, also known as DDI, is being
developed for use against acquired immune deficiency
syndrome. It is chemically similar to Wellcome PLC's AZT.</p>
