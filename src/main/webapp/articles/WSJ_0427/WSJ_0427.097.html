	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Labor Department plans to require that
chemical plants institute rigorous "process safety management
plans" to guard against disasters.
   The plan to propose a new safety standard for chemical
plants, incorporating policies already followed voluntarily
by many companies, was disclosed in a department report to
President Bush covering the explosions last October at a
Phillips Petroleum Co. plastics complex near Houston. The
catastrophe, one of the worst chemical-facility disasters
since World War II, killed 23 workers and injured more than
130.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The department's Occupational Safety and Health
Administration plans to propose that chemical companies be
required to take such steps as evaluating chemical-plant
valves to see if any pose a safety hazard, training company
and contractor workers properly, ensuring that valves can be
closed easily if chemical material is clogged in pipes, and
managing changes in procedures that could pose new safety
problems, Assistant Labor Secretary Gerard Scannell said.</p>
<p>Mr. Scannell, who runs OSHA, told a news conference, "I
think we've got to do something right away" to make sure that
similar disasters don't occur. He said the procedures
encompassed by the coming proposal are ones that Phillips
plants are supposed to follow, but didn't at the Houston
complex.</p>
<p>While the petrochemical industry has had a lower injury
rate than many other industries, major disasters have
occurred in the industry, including a 1984 accident that
killed more than 2,000 in Bhopal, India, and a 1985 explosion
in Mexico City that killed about 650 that same year, the
report said. It said accidents in the industry resulted from
such factors as inadequate attention to the recognition of
hazards, poorly maintained equipment, poor planning, and
unsafe work practices.</p>
<p>Last week, OSHA cited Phillips for $5.7 million in fines
on charges of willful violation of OSHA rules, including
failure to follow company-prescribed methods of protecting
workers against fire and explosion hazards. Fines of $730,000
were also proposed against Fish Engineering & Construction
Inc., a Houston-area company doing maintenance work on the
Phillips site when the explosions took place.</p>
<p>OSHA traced the Houston explosions to Phillips's failure
to provide a backup valve or other means of preventing the
escape of gases when a single ball valve wasn't closed during
repairs. Polyethylene particles clogged settling legs in a
pipe system, and were being cleared, when a buildup of highly
flammable gases escaped from the unattended settling legs,
OSHA said.</p>
<p>OSHA's plans for a chemical-process management rule were
already in the works before the Houston disaster, officials
said. Now, the agency also will revise its priorities, to
better identify "catastrophic risks" in the petrochemical
industry, such as those posed by the use of contractors, Mr.
Scannell said.</p>
<p>The agency also released a preliminary report by the John
Gray Institute, which concluded that petrochemical companies
are relying more on contractors, and that contract workers
have a high turnover rate, sustain more injuries, get less
safety training than permanent workers, and work under looser
safety supervision.</p>
<p>Mr. Scannell said injury reports for chemical plants cover
only permanent workers, a situation that may mask higher
injury rates for on-site contractors.</p>
