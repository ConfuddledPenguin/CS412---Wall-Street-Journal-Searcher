	<p class="article-leader">The Seraphic Society's name comes from seraphim -- angels
at the feet of God. Invitation-only, secretive and all
female, the society is one of New York's most exclusive
organizations. Its members are secretaries -- the
mother-confessors, calendar keepers and confidantes to some
of America's most important executives.
   IBM Chairman John Akers's secretary belongs. So do Rand
Araskog's (ITT) and James Robinson's (American Express). But
John Reed's secretary at Citicorp doesn't. Why? "The name may
have come up, but we haven't met her," says Arlyne
Blessington, the society's president. "We're really not out
there to pull people off the street."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Getting into the society is, in its way, more difficult
than counting oneself among the Forbes 400. Club bylaws
permit only 100 full members. To qualify, a secretary must
log five years with her company, and two years with her boss.
Most important, she must have the right boss.</p>
<p>The society seeks only the best secretaries, drawing its
ranks from top New York-area companies, charitable
organizations (the Ford Foundation), banks (Chase Manhattan)
and venerable institutions (the New York Stock Exchange).
Being wealthy isn't enough, unless you are Mrs. John Hay
Whitney. Her secretary belongs. Not welcome are those who
toil for buy-out kings, headhunters or anyone with a "taint."</p>
<p>There is no rule against male secretaries, but "we just
haven't met any," Mrs. Blessington says.</p>
<p>Angel to Harris Hester of Cluett, Peabody, Mrs.
Blessington speaks of the society in a voice that would bring
a ring of unalterable truth to the phrase, "He's in a
meeting." In person, she's attractive, fortyish -- like most
of the members -- and discreet, like all of the members.
Still, she and others allow that working for the boss can be
tough. Many say they are isolated: No one in the office
gossips with them.</p>
<p>The Seraphic Society fills this gap, providing an outlet
for socializing and a network for advice. Need to know how to
write the Queen? Call Cyrus Vance's secretary. Problems with
furniture delivery? Call Edward Finkelstein's secretary at
Macy's. A bit of financial advice? Call Howard Clark's
secretary at Shearson. Members do. The perks are nice, too,
from outings on the Forbes yacht to cocktail parties in
skyscraping corporate suites and fancy restaurants.</p>
<p>Seraphics, of course, aren't mere secretaries. They don't
need the recognition of Professional Secretaries Week,
currently underway, to feel special. "We like to think we're
the cream of the crop," says Ellen Donnelly, Mr. Clark's
executive assistant. Adds Deborah Brown, assistant to the
president of DDB Needham Worldwide: "It's just such a
wonderfully special group." Seraphics have high salaries --
$75,000 a year is not unusual -- and many have secretaries of
their own.</p>
<p>Some members lament they are a dying breed. "I speak with
secretaries who can't talk on the phone, they can't spell,
they dress terribly," bristles Elva Murphy. "They're not
secretaries. They're people who can't do anything else, so
they call themselves secretaries."</p>
<p>Ms. Murphy works for Mr. Vance, one of many prominent
bosses on the roster of the 50-year-old society. Thomas E.
Dewey, Henry Luce and Herbert Hoover were all represented.
The club's roots, however, are more humble. It started, a
Seraphic history says, as the whim of a former reporter who
started a charity for unemployed circus clowns. To win favor
with secretaries on his fund-raising rounds, he sent them
awards for "unfailing courtesy, tact, politeness" and so on.
He invited a dozen of the women to a dinner, and they took it
from there.</p>
<p>As with other exclusive enclaves, one doesn't apply.
Members prospect for recruits on the phone, while arranging
boss-to-boss contacts, but they drop no hints. Joyce Gibson,
assistant to the head of the Rockefeller Group, was surprised
when she got a letter a few years back inviting her to join.
"I had never heard of the group," she recalls.</p>
<p>But weeks earlier, she had unknowingly met six of its
members. A secretary she knew had invited her to join some
women at the Rainbow Room, a gathering that seemed
unremarkable at the time. "It was a very pleasant lunch," she
says. It was also a covert interview. "I was looked over,"
Ms. Gibson, now a member, later realized.</p>
<p>Even before candidates are screened -- for "certain
qualities of sociability," Mrs. Blessington says -- the
club's governing board checks out their bosses. Ann Mortimer,
who joined while working for the chairman of Avco, had an
unusual glimpse at the process in 1986 when she moved to
Reader's Digest to work for Chairman George Grune. To retain
her full Seraphic membership -- and avoid demotion to
"associate member" status, which members risk if they change
jobs or their boss dies -- she had to submit Mr. Grune's
credentials to club officials. "They were particularly
interested in what organizations he's active with and what
memberships he maintains and what boards of directors he's
on," she says.</p>
<p>Luckily for her, he is a director or trustee of "all those
good things," she says -- Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital,
the Metropolitan Opera, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and
the New York Zoological Society. "You want the other member
bosses to be people that your own boss would be comfortable
knowing," Ms. Mortimer says.</p>
<p>The society was so eager to enlist Henry Kissinger's
longtime secretary, Christine Vick, that they bent the rules
to pursue her. By the time Ms. Vick received an invitation to
join, she had been promoted to a more senior slot in her
boss's consulting firm. "For them, it didn't matter," she
says.</p>
<p>The Kissinger project wasn't a complete success. He never
found time to attend the annual "Bosses Dinner" (only
one-third of bosses typically attend). Nor did he take
members to the race track, as did Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady a few years ago while at Dillon Read.</p>
<p>To stay in the society, members must go to at least one of
four main lunches and dinners each year. Meeting that
requirement isn't all that difficult when obliging companies
furnish transportation -- limousines or the General Electric
helicopter, which whisked four Connecticut-based Seraphics to
a members-only dinner in New York a few years back.</p>
<p>Club functions are eventful. Here is a description of one,
taken from the society's internal history: "The June 20
{1989} membership dinner brought together 113 Seraphics at
the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company's Memorial Hall.
Through the generous invitation of John J. Creedon, each
member paid only $37.50 for the dinner. Met Life contributed
predinner refreshments, printed program, and dinner wine.
Each member took home a Snoopy canvas bag from Met Life
filled with summertime preparations, donated by several
Seraphic companies . . . Avon Products `Skin So Soft' summer
survival sack, from Johnson & Johnson, Sundown sunscreen
stick and lotion; from the New York Times, a Post-it pad" and
on and on. At a 1983 lunch, according to the history, Dow
Jones Chairman Warren Phillips and his secretary, Seraphic
member Karen Cuddy, "provided lovely Wall Street Journal
Italian silk scarves as table prizes."</p>
<p>Club activities include out-of-town jaunts. Ms. Donnelly
says she helps arrange weekend getaways by letting companies
know that Seraphic members "work for some pretty important
people.</p>
<p>"If you want the bosses to travel on your airlines and
stay in your hotels," she tells companies, "you might show
these women some consideration." They do. Continental
Airlines flew a dozen club members to and from Chicago last
fall for no charge at all. The Trump Shuttle took some
Seraphics to Boston, also free of charge.</p>
<p>Outings on the Forbes yacht have been a particularly
prized perk, courtesy of Seraphic boss Malcolm Forbes. When
he died, no one had to call Mary Ann Danner, his longtime
assistant, to tell her she had been notched down to associate
member. She knew the rules: She had been a full member since
the 1960s.</p>
<p>But what of the yearly yacht trips?</p>
<p>Seraphic members needn't have worried. Eager to maintain
the Forbes-Seraphic link, started 47 years ago with Malcolm's
father and his secretary, Ms. Danner rushed to nominate for
membership Malcolm Forbes Jr., the new Forbes Inc. chairman,
and Jacqueline DeMaria, his secretary. Not surprisingly, both
gained quick approval -- minus the usual background check and
lunch.</p>
<p>Ms. Blessington explains: "We had already met them."</p>
