	<p class="article-leader">HARTFORD, Conn. -- Shawmut National Corp. reported a 37%
drop in first-quarter profit to $40.6 million, or 55 cents a
share, reflecting a sharply higher provision for possible
loan losses.
   In the year-ago quarter, the bank holding company earned
$64.7 million, or 85 cents a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The loan-loss provision was $69 million, up from $16.5
million. Higher nonperforming assets and $13 million in
expenses associated with a recent regulatory examination
contributed to the loss, Shawmut said.</p>
<p>Partly offsetting those factors were a pretax gain of
$46.7 million from the settlement of certain pension
obligations and a tax benefit of $8.5 million from an
operating-loss carry-forward.</p>
<p>"Our results reflect the continuing uncertainty of the New
England region and the particular problems in real estate,"
said Joel Alvord, chairman.</p>
<p>Net interest income dropped 17% to $212.6 million from
$255.4 million. The net interest margin fell to 3.6% from
4.3%, dragged down by the company's higher level of
nonperforming assets and a lower level of deposits that don't
bear interest.</p>
<p>Noninterest income rose 65% to $146.5 million from $88.5
million, largely because of the gain from the pension
settlement.</p>
<p>According to preliminary figures, nonperforming loans and
foreclosed real estate totaled $1.16 billion, or 6.8% of
total loans and foreclosed properties as of March 31, the
company said. That compared with $1.02 billion, or 5.3%, as
of Dec. 31, and $273 million, or 1.5%, as of March 31, 1989.</p>
<p>Total assets dropped to $24.9 billion from $27.9 billion
as of Dec. 31 as the company sold investments and securitized
assets to improve its liquidity and support its capital
ratios. Shareholders' equity equaled 5.7% of total assets as
of March 31, compared with 6.5%.</p>
<p>The reserve for possible loan losses stood at $772.3
million as of March 31-up from $285.1 million.</p>
<p>After-tax charge-offs in the first quarter were $35.6
million, including $20 million relating to Mexican debt
restructuring, compared with $13.1 million a year earlier.
Domestic after-tax write-offs rose to $15.9 million from
$14.2 million.</p>
