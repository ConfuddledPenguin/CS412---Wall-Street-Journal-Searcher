	<h3>Black Pregnant Women Far More Likely Than Whites to Be Reported for Drug Use</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">White women are just as likely to use drugs or alcohol
during pregnancy as black women, a new study says, but blacks
are much more likely to be reported to state authorities for
the practice.
   The findings raise questions for state programs that seek
to protect newborns by requiring that health officials report
mothers suspected of illicit drug or alcohol use while
pregnant. In some instances, such reports prompt authorities
to take infants from their mothers and place them in
protective custody.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A flurry of recent medical studies show that drug and
alcohol use during pregnancy can be harmful to newborns, and
several states, including California, Illinois, Minnesota and
Florida require hospitals to report suspected cases to health
authorities. The problem has been especially apparent with
the rash of so-called crack babies born to teenagers in inner
cities.</p>
<p>For this study, published in yesterday's New England
Journal of Medicine, researchers looked at pregnant women in
Pinellas County, Fla., which includes the cities of St.
Petersburg and Clearwater. Research subjects were culled from
both public health clinics, which tend to serve poor
patients, and the practices of private gynecologists, seen by
more affluent patients. Overall, 15% of pregnant women had
used drugs or alcohol while pregnant.</p>
<p>"The use of illicit drugs is common among pregnant women
regardless of race and socioeconomic status," the study
concluded. The authors argued that states should take steps
to insure that mothers and their infants are reported to
authorities on medical criteria alone and not racial or
economic bias.</p>
<p>The researchers, headed by Ira J. Chasnoff of Northwestern
University Medical School, Chicago, found that among 715
pregnant women in Pinellas County, 15.4% of white women and
14.1% of black women had used illegal drugs or alcohol. In
addition, 16.3% of women treated at public health clinics and
13.1% of those seen at private clinics were found to have
used drugs or alcohol. The findings were based on urine tests
taken at a woman's first prenatal doctor visit. All tests
were taken during the first six months of 1989.</p>
<p>The major difference between white and minority women was
the drug they used: Black women were more likely to use
cocaine, while white women overwhelmingly used marijuana.
Alcohol, because it metabolizes quickly, was detected in only
a handful of cases, and the researchers speculated that the
extent of drinking was "almost certainly underreported," in
the study.</p>
<p>During the six months of the study, hospitals reported 133
women to Pinellas County health authorities, including 48, or
1.1%, of the 4,290 white mothers to give birth during the six
months, and 85, or 10.7%, of the 853 black women who
delivered babies. "Thus, a black woman was 9.6 times more
likely than a white woman to be reported for substance abuse
during pregnancy," the authors said.</p>
<p>The researchers cautioned that the urine tests, taken only
once from each subject, disclose only that a certain
substance was taken shortly before the test. "Such tests do
not indicate the frequency or the amount used." It could be,
they noted, that white women were more likely to stop using
drugs after beginning prenatal care, but they added that
other research indicates that such usage rarely stops without
intensive treatment.</p>
<p>They offered several possible explanations for the huge
difference in the rate black women were reported to
authorities. Private obstetricians and hospitals may be
reluctant to assess their patients for substance use, or to
report their patients, for fear of losing referrals.
Moreover, such doctors may be inhibited because they are in
the same social circles as many of their patients, they said.</p>
<p>In addition, "infants born to black women could have had
more severe symptoms of drug exposure than white women," the
authors said, because of the higher rate of cocaine use among
black women. Moreover, doctors may consider cocaine more
damaging to newborns than marijuana, more commonly used by
white women, even though several studies show that a mother's
marijuana use can cause adverse effects for their infants,
the researchers said.</p>
