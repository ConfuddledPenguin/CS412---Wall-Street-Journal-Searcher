	<p class="article-leader">LONG BEACH, Calif. -- McDonnell Douglas Corp., on the
heels of an $84 million first-quarter loss at its
transport-aircraft unit here, said it would lay off roughly
3,000 workers at the site, probably all of them salaried
personnel.
   The cost-cutting move, which would affect about 6% of the
subsidiary's work force, reverses the unit's previously
stated goal of hiring new employees, even as the U.S.
military budget shrinks in coming years. The company had
thought that the development of its new commercial jetliners,
the MD-11 and MD-90, would allow it to add about 1,000 this
year to its rolls here, already at 50,000 or so.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yet an admittedly "poor financial performance" has led
McDonnell Douglas to reconsider. The company said it has
undertaken "extensive efforts" to trim non-payroll expenses
for such things as utilities and supplies. However, "those
cuts have proved insufficient," the company explained in a
statement, "leaving little choice" but to lay people off.</p>
<p>For the employees here, most of whom have already
experienced considerable hardship because of a massive
restructuring in February 1989 that forced them to redesign
their jobs and then reapply for those slots, the prospect of
a reduction was stunning news. "I think some people are
shellshocked," one employee said late yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>McDonnell Douglas stressed that the announcement of
layoffs, the first at the Long Beach factory since 1983, had
nothing to do with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's proposal
yesterday to chop the Air Force's planned fleet of C-17 cargo
planes, which are built here. "It's an unfortunate
coincidence," one company official said.</p>
<p>Doug Griffith, president of a United Auto Workers local
that represents about 19,000 hourly McDonnell Douglas
production-line workers, said he was promised that his
membership "wouldn't be impacted" and that only general and
administrative functions would be eliminated.</p>
<p>He said, in fact, that there would probably be more hires
on the MD-11 line as it matures and moves to fill the 344
orders for the tri-jet booked to date. But, according to a
company spokesman, any addition there would now have to come
as the result of intracompany transfers. "There are a lot of
instances where people have changed from blue collar to white
collar over the years, and they may elect to accept one of
those opportunties that remain open," he said. Moreover,
there is a possibility of workers coming to Long Beach from
McDonnell Douglas's jet-fighter facility in St. Louis, where
several lines are slated for closure by the mid-1990s.</p>
<p>Late yesterday, McDonnell Douglas disclosed that to keep
the employment level at its St. Louis factory as stable as
possible, it was even going to begin assembling MD-11 nose
sections, which it will then ship here.</p>
<p>McDonnell Douglas is counting on the Long Beach plant to
be its big breadwinner by the end of the decade. But the
transport unit, which has grown from fewer than 15,000 people
in 1984, hasn't been able to capitalize on its huge backlog,
and is suffering from inefficiencies. "They're straining
under the load," Mr. Griffith said. "There has literally been
a hemorrhaging of money."</p>
<p>The action at McDonnell Douglas adds pressure to an
industry that already is experiencing downsizing. The
Machinists union said a few weeks ago, for instance, that
Calabasas, Calif.-based Lockheed Corp. was going to lay off
about 2,500 workers, the bulk of them also white collar, in
an effort to reduce overhead costs. Lockheed, though, has
said no definite figure has been determined. General Motors
Corp.'s Hughes Aircraft Co. division, Northrop Corp. and
Boeing Co. all have been reducing their work forces in recent
months.</p>
<p>McDonnell Douglas employed a total of almost 128,000 at
the end of 1989.</p>
