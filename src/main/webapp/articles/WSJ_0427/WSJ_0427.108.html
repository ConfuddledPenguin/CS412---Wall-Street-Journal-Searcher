	<p class="article-leader">ICN Biomedicals Inc. disclosed in a filing that the
Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating trading
in its securities during a four-month period in 1988.
   ICN Biomedicals, a separately traded subsidiary of ICN
Pharmaceuticals Inc., said in the SEC financial filing that
it isn't aware of the scope or current status of the
investigation. Both companies are based in Costa Mesa, Calif.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In Washington, an SEC spokesman said that "staff (members)
aren't authorized to comment on the status of
investigations."</p>
<p>ICN said it received a letter from the SEC in December
requesting that the company voluntarily provide information
relating to trading activity in its securities during the
period from April through July of 1988. The company said it
provided the information in January of this year.</p>
<p>According to an excerpt from the letter read to a
reporter, "this inquiry should not be construed as an
indication by the commission or its staff that any violations
of law have occurred, nor as an adverse reflection upon any
person, entity or security." An ICN Biomedical spokesman said
that he couldn't provide a copy of the letter because it is
"confidential" and "contains the names of other companies.</p>
<p>"As far as we know, this was nothing more than a routine
request for information that was also made of a number of
other companies about the possibility of these companies
being the subject of a merger or acquisition, or the subject
of rumors about acquisitions," the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The filing also indicated that a previously disclosed
grand jury investigation of ICN, the parent company, and of
its subsidiaries, is continuing in U.S. District Court in Los
Angeles. In September 1988, the grand jury issued a subpoena
covering a broad range of matters, many of which relate to
alleged improper marketing of the drug ribavirin.
Subsequently, ICN and the subsidiaries were notified that
they were targets of a criminal investigation.</p>
<p>According to the latest filing, the grand jury has issued
three supplemental subpoenas requesting information covering
a number of matters not covered by the initial subpoena. The
grand jury also has subpoenaed various employees, officers
and directors of ICN and its subsidiaries. ICN and its
subsidiaries are cooperating in the investigation, the filing
said.</p>

<p>In composite trading on the American Stock Exchange
yesterday, shares of ICN Biomedicals closed at $8.75,
