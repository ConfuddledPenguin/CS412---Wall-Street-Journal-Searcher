	<p class="article-leader">SYDNEY -- Australia must restrain demand in its economy to
reduce consumption, inflation and imports, the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development said in its latest
survey on the country.
   That implies Australian interest rates should be kept
relatively high, a recommendation likely to be accepted by
the Australian government and central bank.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Both have warned recently that demand, particularly from
consumers, must be suppressed for several years to restrain
imports while exports increase.</p>
<p>Australia's main economic goal during the 1990s is to
narrow its current-account deficit, halting the growth of a
still-rising foreign debt of 148 billion Australian dollars
($114.95 billion), and then to reduce that debt.</p>
<p>Suppressing consumer demand also would help combat the
nation's high 8% inflation rate. Only last week, the central
bank called for a major effort against inflation by the Labor
Party government. Labor won a national election March 24, and
doesn't have to face the voters again for three years. That
provides an opportunity for the government to introduce
unpopular anti-inflation measures and maintain high interest
rates.</p>
<p>The OECD report issued this week is based on its study of
the economy last December. It says demand in the economy
surged in recent years following a recovery of world prices
for Australia's farm and mineral exports, which lifted
national income.</p>
<p>Tight government fiscal and monetary policies started to
slow demand late in 1989, the OECD says, but a severe
recession is unlikely. "The challenge now is to ensure that
the necessary weakening of domestic demand growth continues,
while pursuing policies conducive to higher, sustainable
output growth and lower inflation over the longer term," the
OECD advises.</p>
