	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Senate approved major provisions of a
fiscal 1990 spending bill that would add almost $3.3 billion
to domestic and foreign-aid accounts, including $720 million
in economic assistance to the new governments of Panama and
Nicaragua.
   By a 51-48 margin, the Republican leadership narrowly beat
back a Democratic proposal to cut $120 million from the
proposed aid to Panama. But to finance the accompanying
domestic initiatives, the Pentagon will be forced to accept
deeper reductions than it has wanted.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Provisions adopted last night would rescind an estimated
$1.54 billion from selected military operations accounts, and
an across-the-board cut of approximately 1.6% would result in
further reductions of an estimated $2.1 billion. A portion of
these funds is restored elsewhere to cover a shortfall in
Pentagon personnel accounts, but the net reduction in
military appropriations would be more than $2.86 billion in
the fiscal year ending Sept. 30.</p>
<p>For the Bush administration, the Central American package
remains the centerpiece of the legislation, but the State
Department has been forced to fight at each step in the
Senate against Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd.</p>
<p>The West Virginian quoted from the Bible, Shakespeare and
Daniel Webster in a tub-thumping call for domestic programs,
and he crafted his amendment to discomfort his opponents and
appeal to an assortment of environmental, agriculture, and
Western state interests.</p>
<p>The largest single transfer would have been to clean up
hazardous nuclear-weapons plants under the Energy Department,
and the provision played on the anxieties of Mr. Byrd's GOP
counterpart, Sen. Mark Hatfield, whose Oregon constituents
must worry about the troubled Hanford facility in Washington
state. "Moses was 40 years in the desert," said Mr. Byrd.
"We're talking about 40 years of inadequate attention to an
environmental problem."</p>
<p>The final package preserves $300 million for Nicaragua and
$420 million for Panama, but the victory last night came only
after a day of intense lobbying in which the White House was
needed to shore up support among wavering farm state
Republicans. Hours later, the State Department was forced to
tap the same GOP support in a fight to waive the Gramm-Rudman
deficit law involving the department's budget. In this fight,
Democrats cast themselves as populist budgeteers vs. the
allies of multilateral banks.</p>
<p>The 62-30 roll call on the budget waiver was just two
votes above the super-majority needed to lift the
Gramm-Rudman restrictions and frees up an estimated $363
million in previously appropriated funds. More than half is
expected to go to international organizations, such as the
United Nations and World Health Organization. But it also
affects more parochial interests such as a Rio Grande River
pollution problem important to Sen. Phil Gramm (R., Texas),
who supported the waiver of the budget law that bears his
name.</p>
<p>Though Central America has so far dominated the debate,
the bill is likely to become a testing ground, too, for
various provisions related to the Middle East. An estimated
$400 million is provided in housing-loan guarantees for
Israel to be used in resettling Soviet Jewish refugees, and
separate amendments have been filed condemning Iraq and
calling, in effect, for an end to trade relations with
Baghdad.</p>
<p>Among domestic accounts, an estimated $11 million was
added last night to assist Louisiana sugar growers hurt by a
severe freeze this winter. The greater threat to final
passage, however, is a laundry list of social amendments
renewing fights over abortion rights and the death penalty.</p>
