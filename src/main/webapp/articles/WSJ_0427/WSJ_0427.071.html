	<p class="article-leader">MANAGUA -- Many thoughtful Nicaraguans are apprehensive as
Violeta B. Chamorro assumes the presidency from the defeated
Daniel Ortega. "It is very dangerous," says Roger Guevara
Mena, president of the bar association. "We don't know what
will happen."
   The 60-year-old president promises to reconcile her
politically divided and squabbling country, to restore
freedoms abused and suppressed during a half-century of
totalitarian regimes (40 years of the Somoza family dynasty,
the past 10 the Sandinista Marxist revolution) and to revive
a shattered economy. Even though her stunning and decisive
victory was mostly a putdown of Ortega mismanagement, the
gray-haired publisher has a clear mandate. The question is
whether she can deliver on her promises.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Educated as a secretary and never before elected to public
office, she lacks all the conventional credentials of Latin
American presidents: experience in the military or public
administration, training in law or economics, not to mention
"machismo". Indeed, her leadership resolve is already being
challenged over her decision to keep Mr. Ortega's brother
Humberto as head of the army.</p>
<p>Yet the hand-wringing in Nicaragua (and in Washington) may
be overdone. President Chamorro has strengths that are
unorthodox for a head of state, but they seem well-suited to
the needs of her downtrodden country at this particular
moment in its history.</p>
<p>She is a widow who still grieves the loss in 1978 of her
assassinated husband, in a country overstocked with recent
widows (30,000 people died in the past decade of civil
warfare, equivalent to one million in U.S. population terms).
She is a mother who holds together a family (two sons, two
daughters) as politically polarized as the country itself,
gathering them regularly for Sunday dinner (no political
discussions allowed). And she is unashamedly devout in a
country 95% Catholic, never hiding the cross she wears,
posting blessings from the pope and her friend Miguel
Cardinal Obando Y Bravo near the front door of her home and
sometimes praying in her public speeches ("May God, who has
helped me in my arduous path, illuminate me from on high").
She believes peace, democracy and economic well-being are
more important than the specific political or economic
systems used to get there.</p>
<p>She seems fearless, determined to continue living alone in
the unpretentious one-story Spanish colonial house that is
filled with memories of her murdered husband, the publisher
Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, but difficult to make secure, in part
because of its open-air interior garden. She hobbles on
crutches as she recovers from a broken knee and keeps going,
even when the pain creases her face, until a friend or aide
forces her to sit down. In a moment of reflection on the
importance of prayer in her life, she confides that she
intends to "stay positive, no matter what happens." As an old
acquaintance remarks, "She has guts."</p>
<p>It is her strong character -- steeped in loyalty to
Nicaragua and its family traditions and deeply ingrained with
a sense of personal honesty and social responsibility,
especially for the poor -- that some Nicaraguans believe will
offset her political inexperience. "Violeta is going to
surprise a lot of people," insists Arturo Cruz Jr., a student
of Nicaragua's history and son of a one-time presidential
candidate.</p>
<p>One surprise that clearly bothers some of her supporters
is her efforts to build bridges with the Ortegas and some of
the other Sandinistas. Even though her newspaper, "La
Prensa", was censored, harassed, burned and closed by the
Sandinista government, she warmly received Daniel Ortega in
her home after the election, calling him "my beautiful little
father." She served with him as a director of the Sandinista
Front for nine months, breaking away because of its Marxist
emphasis but never letting her differences with Daniel Ortega
become personal.</p>
<p>President Chamorro has continued to reach out to the
Sandinistas. But her move to let Humberto Ortega, who was the
Sandinista defense minister, remain as head of the army has
many of her UNO coalition supporters and Contra leaders in a
frenzy.</p>
<p>Even though Mrs. Chamorro will fill the defense minister
post herself, critics charge that keeping Humberto Ortega on
as army chief is too accommodating to the moderate wing of
the Sandinistas. Some charge that the move is merely a power
push by the more ambitious members of her political team,
such as Alfredo Cesar, who are trying to forge a Sandinista
alliance to secure their own political ambitions. Militarily,
besides the danger of the Contras resisting disarmament with
Humberto Ortega still in charge, there is the fear that
Humberto Ortega will leave intact Sandinista-forged pipelines
for arms to leftist guerrillas in El Salvador.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chamorro's supporters, on the other hand, praise the
move as shrewd, since Humberto Ortega will be saddled with
the responsibility of disciplining Sandinista soldiers when
the Contras start to return to their towns. The appointment
has also helped to pave the way for the hard-line Sandinista
interior minister, Tomas Borge, to retire from the army and
to pursue plans to leave the country.</p>
<p>Harder than keeping the peace may be reviving the nation's
mismanaged and out-of-control economy. President Chamorro has
a strong economic team committed to free-market solutions,
but the problems are staggering: The currency is almost
worthless as a visitor learns when he exchanges $60 and gets
back 3,495,000 cordobas; farmers desperately need hard credit
right now to pay for seed and fertilizer, and a $300 million
U.S. emergency-aid package that could help is still working
its way through Congress. Honduran President Rafael Leonardo
Callejas, an admirer of Mrs. Chamorro, says she has "no
chance {of economic success} without a strong commitment from
the international community."</p>
<p>People close to the new president are impressed with the
strong economic team she named and believe she will defer to
them, but will monitor their progress not by reading
statistics but by going into the markets and talking to
housewives. Her economic programs will be helped by the
return of exiled Nicaraguan merchants and businessmen, and
the recent lifting of the U.S. trade embargo.</p>
<p>Even though her election coalition, UNO, is fragile
President Chamorro has more intuitive political savvy than
she is credited with. Her husband lived politics 24 hours a
day, and she was his closest confidante over 28 years. "The
only person Pedro Joaquin trusted was his wife," says Mr.
Cruz. She also traveled widely with him and has continued to
travel since his death. She possibly has easier access to
important people in this hemisphere than Daniel Ortega did.</p>
<p>Events in a country plagued by disaster, natural and
man-made, throughout its history may eventually sabotage Mrs.
Chamorro's presidency. But there is reason to believe her
chances are better than many of her dismissive critics think.</p>

recently in Managua for a meeting of the Inter American Press
Association, to which Mrs. Chamorro belongs.</p>
