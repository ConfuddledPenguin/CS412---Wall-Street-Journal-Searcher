	<p class="article-leader">Whitehall Corp., Dallas, claimed victory in its proxy
fight with Cambridge Capital Fund Limited Partnership, a New
York-based investment company.
   Whitehall said it is confident, based on a preliminary
report from the independent inspectors of election, that its
slate of five directors had been re-elected. Roger Miller, a
general partner with Cambridge, said the fund wouldn't
comment until the final tally is released Monday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Cambridge had put up its own slate of directors as part of
its strategy to gain control of Whitehall, which modifies and
maintains aircraft systems, sells underwater acoustic
technology to the Navy and makes marine sensor systems. The
fund had also offered to buy the 90.4% of Whitehall stock it
didn't already own for $20 a share, or about $62 million,
which was rejected by Whitehall's board. Whitehall refused to
meet with Cambridge to negotiate terms and said it would
"vigorously oppose" Cambridge's effort to unseat its board.</p>
