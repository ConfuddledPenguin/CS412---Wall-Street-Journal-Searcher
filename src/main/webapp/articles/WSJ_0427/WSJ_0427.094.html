	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Assets of the nation's 509 money-market funds
fell $816.6 million, to $387.89 billion, in the week ended
Wednesday, the Investment Company Institute, a
Washington-based trade association, reported.
   Assets of 246 general-purpose funds rose $563.3 million to
$133.62 billion; assets of 102 broker-dealer funds fell $1.68
billion to $163.64 billion. Assets of 161 institutional funds
rose $299.8 million to $90.64 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Jacob Dreyer, vice president and chief economist at the
institute, said that yields on funds have remained fairly
stable for the past three months, and that falling stock and
bond prices have had "no apparent effect on the movements of
assets into and out of money market funds." He added that
with individual income-tax payment and refund checks still
clearing last week, "no clear pattern of changes in assets of
money-market funds was evident."</p>
