	<p class="article-leader">The Israeli political crisis that began six weeks ago as
an attempt to breathe life into the Mideast peace process now
looks more like the kiss of death to any hope of a prompt
Israeli-Palestinian dialogue.
   As Labor Party leader Shimon Peres ran out of his alloted
time to form a government, he predicted that his Likud bloc
rival Yitzhak Shamir also would fail to break the 60-60
parliamentary deadlock. But if Mr. Shamir succeeds, Mr. Peres
warned, the result would be "an extremist right-wing
government the like of which Israel never had."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>On the face of it, forming a government shouldn't be too
difficult for Mr. Shamir. With the support of religious
parties now likely, he need only win back Avraham Sharir, the
Likud member of parliament who defected to Labor in the
recent round of coalition bargaining. But a government with a
slim majority would be highly vulnerable, with seven of its
supporters coming from extreme-right parties that won't
tolerate even the slightest concession to the Palestinians.</p>
<p>Israel's political turmoil is taking place against a
backdrop of heightening regional tension. Moderate voices,
such as Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak, are being drowned
out by the war-like rhetoric of Iraq's Saddam Hussein, who
this month threatened to "scorch half of Israel" with
chemical weapons in retaliation for any Israeli aggression.</p>
<p>Many moderate Arabs have been alarmed by the popular
reaction to Mr. Hussein's belligerence. "If you go to the
Arab street, there's an amazing reaction in his favor," says
a Palestinian businessman. Mohammed Heikal, author and
confidant of the late Egyptian President Gamal Abdul Nasser,
summed up the Arab mood in an interview with an Iraqi
newspaper. The Iraqi leader, he said, filled "a need for a
strong, enlightened voice coming from the Arab world, telling
{Israel and the West} that the Arabs still possess potential,
that they are still alive."</p>
<p>Indeed, Mr. Hussein, who at home has tried to link himself
in the popular imagination with the ancient destroyer of
Israel, Nebuchadnezzar, now seems to be positioning himself
as the Arab world's new Nasser: tough, nationalistic and
militant. "Up until Saddam Hussein started saber-rattling,
momentum in the Arab world seemed to be pulling toward what I
would call the Egyptian pole," says Martin Indyk, director of
the Washington Institute for Near-East Policy.</p>
<p>Egypt, the only Arab country to have signed a peace treaty
with Israel, last year resumed its place in the Arab League
after being diplomatically shunned for more than a decade.
Even hard-line states such as Syria seemed to be weighing
whether to get into the peace process, Mr. Indyk says. But
now, "the specter of new credibility for the war option has
emerged."</p>
<p>Both King Hussein of Jordan and Yasser Arafat, the
Palestine Liberation Organization chairman, are strong
supporters of the Iraqi leader. At a recent Baghdad rally in
support of the Palestinian uprising, Mr. Arafat made an
effusive speech in praise of Mr. Hussein, declaring: "We will
enter Jerusalem victorious and will raise our flag on its
walls. You will enter with me, riding your white stallion."</p>
<p>Arab leaders, caught off guard by their people's delighted
reception of Mr. Hussein's hard-line statements, now are
walking a tightrope. They are caught between playing to
popular opinion and strengthening a man whose aggression in
the past hasn't been limited to non-Arab targets such as
Israel and Iran but also has threatened vulnerable Persian
Gulf states such as Kuwait. A test of Mr. Hussein's growing
clout will be whether he is able to get Saudi Arabia, Syria
and Egypt to agree to an Arab summit in Baghdad. He wants to
discuss the U.S.-British "campaign" against Iraq's military
build-up and the migration of Soviet Jews to Israel.</p>
<p>In such a climate, the emergence of a hard-line Israeli
government bodes ill for regional stability. In his brief
weeks as caretaker prime minister, Mr. Shamir didn't lose any
time in showing his hard-line colors. With the Labor-Likud
coalition dissolved and Labor ministers out of the cabinet,
Mr. Shamir rushed to establish new settlements in the
occupied territories and to finance a highly controversial
move by Jewish religious zealots into the Christian Quarter
of Jerusalem's old city.</p>
<p>The prospect of such a government formally taking control
is causing "something akin to severe depression" in
Washington, says William Quandt, a Middle East specialist at
the Brookings Institution. While it is possible that Mr.
Shamir will opt for another "government of national unity"
with Labor rather than try to rule with a slim and precarious
majority, even that prospect offers little hope for
Israeli-Palestinian dialogue.</p>
<p>"Even if they patch something back together, there isn't
going to be much real dynamism in the peace effort," says Mr.
Quandt. "If it didn't work last time, why will it work this
time?"</p>
