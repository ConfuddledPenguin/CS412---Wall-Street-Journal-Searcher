	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo's Nikkei stock index fell through the bottom of a
narrow trading range to close at its intraday low Thursday.
   But more issues advanced than declined, indicating that
the index's 225 issues absorbed much of the day's losses.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>London shares eased and stocks in most other markets were
lower or mixed.</p>
<p>In Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 selected issues was down
139.78 points at 29424.58. The index gained 62.98 points
Wednesday.</p>
<p>In Tokyo Friday, the morning session closed with the
Nikkei index at 29494.57, up 69.99 points.</p>
<p>Thursday's volume on the First Section was estimated at
550 million shares, down from 700 million shares Wednesday.</p>
<p>Winning issues outpaced losing issues, 490 to 411, while
199 were unchanged.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index (Topix) of all issues listed
in the first section, which rose 7.42 points Wednesday,
slipped 0.41 point, or 0.02%, to 2200.10.</p>
<p>The second section index, which fell 17.43 points
Wednesday, was up 6.89 points, or 0.20%, to close at 3515.72.
Volume in the second section was estimated at eight million
shares, down from nine million Wednesday.</p>
<p>Market players said that despite speculation that
arbitrage selling probably would come in during the
afternoon, because futures premiums were low at the morning
close, such activity most likely didn't occur Thursday.</p>
<p>But traders said that either index-related selling by
investment trust funds or simply basket trades involving the
Nikkei 225 stocks was responsible for the fall in prices
toward the end of the session.</p>
<p>Keith Richman, head of futures and options arbitrage
trading at Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd., said the
program selling seemed to have had a small impact on cash
prices, but wasn't overly reacted to.</p>
<p>Mr. Richman said that call options were being bought at
the close, with investors bidding up the futures, indicating
that the market wasn't too discouraged by the program
selling.</p>
<p>Mr. Richman said that the market wasn't extremely bearish
Thursday, but added that some more selling is possible for
Friday, the last day before the Golden Week holidays begin.</p>
<p>The market will be closed Monday, Thursday and Friday of
next week for the national holidays.</p>
<p>Despite the "not-too-bearish" tone in the market, however,
Mr. Richman asserted that the dollar's continued strength
against the yen "doesn't really bode well" for major buying.</p>
<p>Mr. Richman, who said he has been "mildly bearish all
week," noted that "a lot of people are waiting to sell {their
stocks} at 160" yen to the dollar.</p>
<p>But Minami Omura, a broker at PaineWebber Inc., said she
thinks the 159-yen level for the dollar is largely discounted
in the market, as is the 160-yen level to some extent.</p>
<p>"Of course, in the long term, {a 160-yen dollar} is not
good for the market," but for the next few trading days the
dollar at current levels shouldn't be too bearish, Ms. Omura
said.</p>
<p>The dollar finished Thursday at 159.23 yen, up slightly
from 158.75 yen late Wednesday in New York and below 159.25
yen late Wednesday in Tokyo.</p>
<p>One issue that was targeted by buyers Thursday afternoon
was Osaka Gas, whose stock ended at its bid price of 670 yen
($4.22), up 60 yen. A company spokesman said Thursday that
although no official announcement was made, the utilities
company has been experimenting with a new material called
activated carbon fibers.</p>
<p>The spokesman said that applications for the new material
are still being researched, but the company has been holding
exhibitions for the product.</p>
<p>Traders said Isuzu Motors and Suzuki Motors are still
benefiting from news Tuesday of new products. Isuzu was up 50
to 1,140, while Suzuki added 100 to 1,010.</p>
<p>PaineWebber's Ms. Omura pointed out that many blue-chip
issues had been due for a technical rebound. Sony advanced
250 to 8,350, Pioneer added 50 to 5,980 and Fanuc gained 150
to 6,970.</p>
<p>But Japan Airlines (JAL) was hit by profit-taking, falling
400 to 16,500. Most steel shares were also lower.</p>
<p>London share prices ended mostly weaker Thursday, as a
marked loss of buying interest late in the session caused a
market largely considered bearish to crumble more than 11
points in the last two hours of trading, dealers said.</p>
<p>Neither market makers nor institutional investors were
interested in taking fresh positions as the three-week
account ends Friday, traders said. "The market makers are not
keen on having any sort of book position at all," one said.</p>
<p>Also, a downward turn on Wall Street around midafternoon
aided the slide of shares in London, traders added.</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
finished down 9.5 points at 2133.6, a touch above its
intraday low of 2132.5 reached in the first hour of official
trading. Scattered buying interest and firmer stock-index
futures earlier in the session led the market to an intraday
high of 2145.8 around midday.</p>
<p>At the close, the narrower FT 30 share index was down 7.4
points at 1676.1. Volume was 510.9 million shares, better
than the 392.8 million that changed hands Wednesday.</p>
<p>In the futures market, the June FT-SE 100 index contract
finished at 2156, down from its close of 2158 Wednesday.</p>
<p>Traders said Wednesday's release of a surprisingly wide
trade deficit figure did nothing to encourage the market's
situation, already suffering from a number of economic and
political woes.</p>
<p>Features were sparse, although Guinness was one of the
strong gainers on the day. The brewing and distilling company
jumped 12 pence to 669 following news that a Paris court
decision has assured it a leading stake in French luxury
goods concern LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Carlton Communications rose 12 to 484 as a
turnaround to a dismal recent performance continued.</p>
<p>Rolls-Royce was easily the most active stock on the day,
with strong interest shown from unidentified foreign buyers,
dealers said. Rolls-Royce shares ended the day unchanged at
197.</p>
<p>Reuters lost 21 to #10.48 ($17.16) after holding an annual
general meeting described by traders as not as bullish as
those in the past.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, stock prices closed higher in Stockholm; lower
in Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam and mixed in Zurich,
Brussels and Milan. South African gold stocks closed higher.</p>
<p>Share prices closed lower in Sydney, Taipei, Seoul, Hong
Kong, Manila and Wellington. Singapore was closed.</p>
<p>Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.</p>
