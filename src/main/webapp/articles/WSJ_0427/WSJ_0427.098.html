	<p class="article-leader">SNECHKUS, U.S.S.R. -- It is a typical day at Ignalina,
site of the world's largest nuclear-power reactors.
   In the dimly lit control room of Reactor No. 2,
instruments show that three electronic sensors are broken
inside the reactor's core.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Nearby, white-coated technicians tend a computer system
that has had six broken components in the past month. Out in
the vast reactor hall, the vibrating steel heart of this
radioactive machine has some loose gaskets that are leaking
steam from a half-dozen points at once.</p>
<p>Individually the problems at the Lithuanian plant aren't
dangerous. But collectively they underscore a fundamental
safety flaw facing the entire Soviet nuclear-power industry:
At a higher rate than reactors elsewhere in the world, parts
are falling apart. The failures, most often in the reactors'
electronic systems, are caused by shoddy manufacturing and
sloppy maintenance.</p>
<p>In fact, four years after the Chernobyl accident, the
enormous Soviet nuclear-power industry is struggling for its
survival. The April 26, 1986, accident killed 31, doused
thousands more with radiation, and cost the crippled Soviet
economy billions. But there was another little-noted
casualty: the industry itself, a nationwide complex of
laboratories, factories and reactors that supplies 12% of all
Soviet electricity and ranks as the world's third largest
such system after the U.S. and France.</p>
<p>Shortly after the Chernobyl accident, the Kremlin shook
the industry out like a dusty old rug. Ministries
reorganized. Safety codes toughened. Old reactors were
repaired and new ones redesigned. Yet experts say safety
remains an elusive goal in the Soviet nuclear-power industry.</p>
<p>The campaign has had its successes. Industry specialists,
both East and West, say safety has improved and the specific
causes of the Chernobyl accident have been corrected. The
cost to the struggling Soviet economy: perhaps $10.5 billion.</p>
<p>But thanks to glasnost, it now is possible to examine the
problems afflicting the Soviet nuclear-power industry, long
secretive because of its kinship to nuclear weaponry. In the
new spirit, the Research and Development Institute of Power
Engineering -- the Moscow agency that designed the Chernobyl
reactor -- authorized and arranged a reporter's tour of two
nuclear-power plants, three research centers, a reactor
factory and other sites. Some had never before been visited
by a Western journalist. Evidence collected on the recent
three-week tour suggests that the East has yet to achieve
Western standards of safety.</p>
<p>Shortcomings include:</p>
<p>-- Some of the country's oldest reactors lack safety
systems that are standard in the West and in newer Soviet
reactors.</p>
<p>The gaps, especially severe in four 20-year-old reactors,
include lack of powerful emergency cooling systems and lack
of the "containment" domes of concrete and steel to prevent
radiation leaks. These old reactors have 10-times-greater
risk of serious accident than other Soviet or Western
reactors, according to Nikolai Yermakov, chief of reactor
development in the Ministry of Nuclear Energy and Industry.
But he calls the risks remote and says safety surveillance
has been stepped up.</p>
<p>-- Because of inadequate analysis, Moscow doesn't know how
safe or unsafe its reactors are.</p>
<p>To assess safety, Western engineers conduct hours-long
computer simulations of possible accidents. Few Soviet
computers can hack such calculations, and even fewer Soviet
engineers care. Many Soviet risk analyses "are based on slide
rules" and aren't reliable, says Prof. Leonid Bolshov, First
Deputy Director of Moscow's Institute of Nuclear Safety.
"It's a very important problem, and the attention paid to it
isn't enough," he warns.</p>
<p>-- Many Soviet reactors suffer, not only from broken parts
but also from careless workers. Because of frequent equipment
failures, Soviet safety philosophy relies heavily on reactor
staff members to spot and fix problems early. But much slips
by the workers. Last year, at its first-ever inspection of a
Soviet reactor, the International Atomic Energy Agency
faulted "weak" quality assurance; it cited such uncorrected
flaws as "missing or damaged insulation" on dusty electrical
cables, a fire hazard. Though it called the plant safely
operated overall, the Vienna-based United Nations affiliate
urged "better workmanship."</p>
<p>The West's stake in Soviet safety is high. "If we have
another accident similar to Chernobyl, I suspect it's going
to be difficult for any nuclear plant throughout the world to
keep operating," says Michael Sellman, an official of
Northern States Power Co., a Minneapolis-based utility that
exchanges technical visits with a Soviet nuclear plant. The
Chernobyl accident strengthened anti-nuclear movements in the
West, roiling industry expansion plans and showing "we're all
in this together," Mr. Sellman says.</p>
<p>In Moscow, the official line acknowledges such
shortcomings but maintains that Soviet reactors are safe
today and will be safer tomorrow. Progress since Chernobyl
includes new safety devices, better computers and tougher
rule-books.</p>
<p>But among Soviet industry leaders, frustration runs high
at what they call the slow pace of their safety programs. The
obstacles include lack of money and political turmoil. In
Soviet journals, some impatient industry officials have begun
proposing radical solutions: ranging from privatizing the
nuclear plants to putting former nuclear submarine operators
at their controls.</p>
<p>The most desperate protest of all came in 1988, when
Valery Legasov, who supervised emergency work at Chernobyl,
committed suicide. In memoirs published posthumously in
Pravda, he excoriated the Kremlin for ignoring warnings of
Chernobyl and lessons from it.</p>
<p>Just how much -- and how little -- his words were heeded
can be seen at the Ignalina nuclear power station, in verdant
Lithuania.</p>
<p>Visited on a March day, before tensions erupted over the
republic's independence movement, the complex is first
spotted by its four idle construction cranes, towering over
nearby forests. Local protests halted construction of a third
reactor here, one of 30 Soviet reactors for which plans were
canceled or postponed after Chernobyl. There was an extra
gripe here: In 1988, a serious electrical fire broke out
under the control room floor. Nobody was injured. It was
caused by workmen improperly laying power cables beside other
wiring and then installing the wrong size circuit-breakers.</p>
<p>Like most Soviet reactors, Ignalina forms a vast complex
with nearly four times as many workers as equivalent Western
reactors. To shelter them and their families, an entire town
for 32,000 was built. Called Snechkus, it is a Soviet vision
of heaven, with a sunny lakefront, a big cinema, a new
hospital and grocery stores with ample, if uninteresting,
food. There is also something rarer: The liquor store stocks
vodka, and the line to buy it is only 15 deep. Rumpled men,
getting off work, banter and swap jokes as they wait. However
bleak life in Moscow may be, here at a nuclear plant Soviet
planners want only happy workers.</p>
<p>The two reactors in the nearby power plant are of a unique
Soviet design that normally operates more smoothly and
cheaply than Western models -- except when things go wrong. A
similar design was at Chernobyl. It is called a water-cooled,
graphite-moderated, channel-type reactor, or RBMK in its
Russian abbreviation, and like most reactors it is just a big
teakettle to boil water. Its steam turns turbines that make
electricity. Its heat comes from nuclear fission. Unlike in
Western reactors, its core is honeycombed with steel pipes
that hold its uranium fuel rods in place and channel cooling
water to prevent overheating.</p>
<p>The Chernobyl accident forced immediate changes. The
accident occurred while operators at the Ukrainian reactor
were testing an electrical system. Under pressure to finish
the job quickly, they disconnected safety systems. Then,
because of a design flaw, the normal chain of atomic
reactions inside the reactor raced out of control. In two
blinding seconds, the roof blew off, fire spread, and
radiation vomited into the sky.</p>
<p>Ignalina and other RBMK engineers took vital steps to
ensure no repeats. They altered the mix of uranium and other
materials inside the reactor, and installed faster
emergency-shutdown systems. They revised staff training,
toughened plant-safety procedures and rewired the reactors'
safety systems so operators now need two separate keys to
disconnect them. The work has already paid off at Ignalina:
Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency last
year praised the plant's tenfold drop in reactor "events" --
problems that force braking of the reactor.</p>
<p>But that doesn't mean all is quiet here. Consider the
steam leaks. Wearing a white coat, white cap, and plastic
bags on his shoes to prevent tracking radiation around,
Deputy Chief Operations Engineer Aleksandr Voretsky leads the
way into the vast, concrete hall housing Reactor No. 2.
Radiation levels in here are far above normal, outdoor
levels, but still relatively harmless for a short visit. He
stands casually atop the reactor's steel cover, as it
vibrates gently with the flow of coolant water inside. From a
half-dozen points around the cover, small jets of steam rise.</p>
<p>Nothing to worry about, Mr. Voretsky assures. The leaks
come from some ill-fitting gaskets on the coolant pipes. So
long as the leaks don't worsen, they won't endanger safety or
health, he says, adding that he is watching them closely.</p>
<p>But the view in Moscow is less casual. On hearing of the
leaks that night by telephone, Prof. Yevgeni Adamov, director
of the institute that designed the reactor, orders the plant
to plug them. "I used some old-fashioned Russian language" on
the plant manager, Prof. Adamov later explains. He confirms
the leaks aren't dangerous in themselves, a position which
Western experts support. But Prof. Adamov condemns the
careless work habits they symptomize. Worker discipline, he
says, is a growing problem in many branches of Soviet
industry.</p>
<p>The quality of the equipment is a problem too. At
Ignalina, plant officials grumble there is little they can do
about it. In theory, says Mr. Voretsky, Soviet manufacturers
guarantee their components against failure, as in the West.
When a part breaks, he gets it fixed and notifies the
factory. But nothing happens. No penalty is paid. And under
Soviet central planning, he can't switch suppliers the way
his Western counterpart can. "In our country," he says, "the
manufacturers are monopolists."</p>
<p>Prof. Bolshov of the nuclear-safety institute isn't having
an easy time of it either. Mr. Bolshov's institute was
founded after the 1986 Chernobyl accident by the U.S.S.R.
Academy of Sciences, to improve industry safety. It was
assigned an unwanted ministry outbuilding, a dump even by
Moscow's flea-bitten standards. At the institute's founding,
Kremlin officials had pledged support with grand words. Now,
Prof. Bolshov gestures around his cramped office: "You see
the gap between words and reality."</p>
<p>His institute's main work has been a struggle, too. The
Soviet nuclear industry is a proud institution; it frowns on
outsiders, new ideas and imported techniques. Prof. Bolshov
represents all three. He's an academic physicist trying to
interest Soviet safety engineers in his institute's
Western-style computer programs. Though some bite, many
don't. Engineers at Gydropress, a big Soviet reactor
designer, won't use them. One Soviet reactor operator
commissioned his institute's help but never found the money
for work to begin.</p>
<p>"Opposition? Of course, there's opposition," Prof. Bolshov
says. "We are trying to create something new and unusual."</p>
