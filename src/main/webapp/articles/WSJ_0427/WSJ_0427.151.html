	<p class="article-leader">Crown Resources Corp. said it obtained a 30-day option to
acquire mining properties from Nevada Goldfields Corp. The
acquisition, if completed, is valued by Denver-based Crown at
$4 million.
   Under terms of the option agreement, Crown Resources would
pay Nevada Goldfields' secured lenders $1.5 million, assume a
$1.5 million note at the prime rate plus 1%, payable within
two years, and issue 100,000 shares of Crown common stock.
Nevada Goldfields' secured lenders also will receive 50% of
the net profit in one of the mining operations, with a
maximum payout of $1 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In what a Crown spokesman termed a separate transaction,
Crown Resources also agreed to acquire, in a $1 million
private placement, 1,153,500 shares of Nevada Goldfields
common stock and warrants to purchase 500,000 more at $1 a
share. If the private placement is completed, Crown would
hold a 12.5% stake in Nevada Goldfields common stock.</p>
