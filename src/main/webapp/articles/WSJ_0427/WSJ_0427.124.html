	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- For the first time, a defunct magazine has won
a National Magazine Award, the most prestigious award in the
magazine industry.
   7 Days, the New York City weekly that was folded by owner
Leonard Stern two weeks ago, won the award for "general
excellence" for publications with circulation less than
100,000. Mr. Stern had closed the magazine because of lack of
advertising and being unable to convert enough free readers
into paid subscribers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Other winners in the general excellence category included:
Texas Monthly, for magazines with circulation between 100,000
and 400,000; Meredith Corp.'s Metropolitan Home for magazines
with circulation between 400,000 and one million; and Time
Warner Inc.'s Sports Illustrated, for magazines with
circulation of more than one million.</p>
<p>The New Yorker, owned by Advance Publications Inc., won
two awards, for reporting and fiction. Conde Nast
Publications Inc.'s Vanity Fair won for essays and criticism.</p>
<p>The awards are sponsored by the American Society of
Magazine Editors and supported by Magazine Publishers of
America.</p>
