	<p class="article-leader">Your article about the furor over recent copyright
decisions restricting "fair use" of unpublished materials
("Unfair Use: Copyright Decision Cramps Writers' Style" by
Amy Gamerman, Leisure & Arts, April 10) seriously distorts
the nature of the dispute between Prof. Victor Kramer and
Mary Newman, trustee of the James Agee Trust. As I told Ms.
Gamerman, what Prof. Kramer seeks to publish is a potpourri
of James Agee's early short prose and poetry, including 18
pieces in which the trust owns the copyright. Several were
published previously (a 1963 Esquire article, for example),
and Prof. Kramer seeks to republish both these and most of
the unpublished items in their entirety. The doctrine of fair
use has never permitted such wholesale misappropriation, as
even spokespeople for groups seeking relief from the recent
decisions would have confirmed, had Ms. Gamerman asked them.
No writer is going to support a view of fair use that would
allow his own short pieces to be anthologized by plunderers
such as Prof. Kramer, without permission or compensation.
   Neither is it true that Prof. Kramer received permission
for his project from a former trustee (as you report). What
Prof. Kramer relies on is a 1970 letter from the original
trustee, David McDowell, written to free them both from
needing to correspond each time Prof. Kramer wrote about Mr.
Agee using work he had done in the Agee collection at the
University of Texas. The letter authorizes Prof. Kramer to
reproduce "information and data" from the Texas collection in
his "scholarly work." It does not refer to any particular
project, and even in Prof. Kramer's version of events Mr.
McDowell did not learn until years later about Prof. Kramer's
plan to publish a collection.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. McDowell, who was Mr. Agee's close friend as well as
his publisher, was instrumental in the creation of the trust
for the benefit of Mr. Agee's children, and he was well aware
of the need to conserve its limited assets. He wrote Prof.
Kramer, "It is my duty to collect every cent I can." Yet it
is Prof. Kramer's position, in a lawsuit he has started, that
the letter is "broad permission" to publish any of the Agee
materials at Texas he chooses, without further approval and
without obligation to compensate the trust or its
beneficiaries. He even calls the trustee's current opposition
to his project "a breach of the trust's contractual
obligations as expressed in the 1970 authorization." This is
just nonsense. Mr. McDowell's 1970 letter did not bind the
trust to approve, for free and forever, any proposal to
publish Mr. Agee's works for which Prof. Kramer could find
himself a publisher. Prof. Kramer's so-called "broad
permission" is just a product of his wishful thinking.</p>

<p>While the article is excellent -- and I appreciate Ms.
Gamerman's thorough investigation -- a few points about my
contracted book might be clarified. That book of edited Agee
"Documents" is not just "early" James Agee, but carefully
selected materials that demonstrate the writer's development
as an artist.</p>
<p>As to Mark Budwig's apparent suggestion that I want to
reprint so much of James Agee that it goes "beyond fair use,"
I point out that my manuscript contains 59 selections by Mr.
Agee as well as 18 more sections (introduction, notes, etc.)
by me. Of the 59 Agee pieces the vast majority is not
controlled by the Agee Trust.</p>
<p>In fact, of the 59 Agee pieces, 52 have already been
published in The Phillips Exeter Monthly, The Harvard
Advocate, or were written for Time magazine, or have already
been published by me in journals, or in my copyrighted 1966
dissertation. Only a few pages seem to be seriously in
dispute. Of those seven short items, one has already appeared
in Esquire magazine, and only two of the remaining six are
"whole" manuscripts. These two "unpublished" pieces plus
selections from four other manuscripts are small in quantity,
and I have offered to cut these to satisfy the trustee. An
extremely small amount of material is in question. I have
published a book, and some 29 other items (articles, reviews)
by, and about, James Agee. The book under contract is the
natural extension of my scholarly work since 1962.</p>
