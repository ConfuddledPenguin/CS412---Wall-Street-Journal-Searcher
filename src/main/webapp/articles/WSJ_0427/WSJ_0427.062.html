	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- World cocoa production will fall this season for
the first time in six years, but should still be well in
excess of consumption, the International Cocoa Organization
predicted.
   The London-based organization of cocoa producers and
consumers forecast 1989-90 (October-September) world
production of 2.37 million metric tons, compared with last
season's record 2.42 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Cocoa consumption, which has been stimulated by low prices
in the past 12 months, will grow 5.7% to a record 2.2 million
tons, it said. This would still be 154,000 tons below
production.</p>
<p>In 1988-89, cocoa production exceeded consumption by a
record 321,000 tons, lifting end-of-season stocks to a record
high of 1.24 million, the organization said.</p>
<p>Five seasons of overproduction, and a projected sixth in
1989-90, knocked cocoa prices to a 14-year low earlier this
year.</p>
