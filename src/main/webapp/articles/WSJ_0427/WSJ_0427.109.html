	<h3>Politics & Policy: Washington's Plan to Let Lobbyists Be Partners In Law Firms Strikes Some Lawyers as Appalling</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Montgomery Winkler works for a law firm
here, but he isn't a lawyer. A former top aide to Rep. Robert
Lagomarsino (R., Calif.), Mr. Winkler chuckled recently when
his cab driver pointed out a bumper sticker quoting William
Shakespeare: "The first thing we do, let's kill all the
lawyers."
   Although he never attended law school, Mr. Winkler earns a
salary fit for a law partner and participates in partner
meetings as a nonlawyer lobbyist. Under a new rule proposed
by the District of Columbia Bar and approved in federal
court, lobbyist Winkler may soon become a law partner
himself.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Starting next year, the D.C. Bar will become the first in
the nation to permit law firms to make nonlawyers partners.
To the capital's burgeoning ranks of lobbyists, many of whom
are nonlawyer law-firm employees, the rule change offers the
possibility of greater wealth and status. And to many
government employees poised to pass through the revolving
door, it adds luster to the idea of becoming a lobbyist. But
to some bar-credentialed lawyers, especially those outside
Washington, the new rule is an appalling breach in the
profession.</p>
<p>In enacting the change, the D.C. Bar breaks a longstanding
taboo within the profession. Traditionally, lawyers have
viewed themselves as a fraternity bonded by a shared sense of
professional responsibility. But what happens to that
tradition when lawyers enter into partnership with mere
tradesmen?</p>
<p>"It's understandable that a law firm would want to have
someone to peddle influence," says Dennis Block, a partner in
the New York firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges who headed an
American Bar Association task force on the issue. But Mr.
Block thinks it's a mistake to make these nonlawyer lobbyists
full-fledged partners. "Lawyers are trained in
confidentiality, we're trained in attorney-client privilege,"
he says. Nonlawyers aren't. As a result, says Mr. Block, law
firms may become leaky places.</p>
<p>"Hogwash," answers James Lake, a nonlawyer lobbyist who
helped create the law firm Heron Burchette Ruckert & Rothwell
in the early 1980s. "There is no client matter that was ever
exposed inappropriately by any {nonlawyer} at Heron
Burchette," says Mr. Lake. Although the law firm went
bankrupt last February, Mr. Lake, who left to start his own
public-relations firm in 1986, says Heron Burchette's demise
had nothing to do with the active participation of nonlawyers
in the firm.</p>
<p>The debate has overtones of a class war, with lawyers
fighting off a potential invasion of ex-government officials
and Capitol Hill staffers with no formal training in the law.
"A lot of people who have law degrees in this town who are
lobbyists use the law degree as a marketing device," says
Mark Helmke, a nonlawyer lobbyist who was formerly an aide to
Sen. Richard Lugar (R., Ind.), and who now works at Mr.
Lake's firm. But lobbying often has nothing to do with law,
Mr. Helmke says.</p>
<p>Assuming nonlawyers can master legal concepts like
attorney-client privilege and conflict of interest, questions
remain about how nonlawyer partners will be policed. The
proposed rule states that law partners will be held
responsible for their nonlawyer brethren. Currently, bar
rules are enforced by the D.C. Bar Counsel, a bar-funded
regulatory office consisting of 15 people, eight of whom are
responsible for investigating 500 cases a year. Jamie
Gorelick, a law partner at Washington's Miller, Cassidy,
Larroca & Lewin, questions "whether these resources are
adequate" to follow the activities of nonlawyers and lawyers
alike. According to Tom Flynn, who heads the D.C. Bar
Counsel's office, his supervisory role has yet to be figured
out.</p>
<p>Mr. Block of Weil Gotshal is more negative. "If, in fact,
we are like any other business," he says, "we will lose the
right to say we are entitled to regulate ourselves."
According to Mr. Block, the logical result will be
supervision by the Commerce Department or by some other
government agency.</p>
<p>So far, even Washington law firms known for their emphasis
on lobbying are reluctant to name nonlawyers whom they will
make partners. "We have nobody who the rule will affect
immediately," says Joel Jankowski, head of the lobbying
division at the Washington office of Akin, Gump, Strauss,
Hauer & Feld. Timothy May, managing partner at Patton, Boggs
& Blow, is more emphatic. "We have no interest nor intention
of making nonlawyers equity partners in our firm," he says.</p>
<p>But law-firm headhunter Susan Schneider says that she has
received phone calls from several Capitol Hill staffers eager
to find out where they can acquire a law partnership without
a law degree.</p>
<p>Mr. Winkler began his career as a nonlawyer lobbyist at
Heron Burchette, where the only partnership privilege he was
denied was an equity share -- hardly a disadvantage, he
quips, given the firm's recent demise. Still, Mr. Winkler
concedes, he wouldn't turn down a partnership at the
Washington office of Chicago-based McDermott, Will & Emery,
where he currently works. "The client thinks that you have
more stature if you're a partner, as opposed to an
associate," he says. "It's just like, if your name is on the
letterhead, it gives you more stature as far as clients are
concerned."</p>
<p>To high-paid nonlawyers working at law firms, status may
well be the chief selling point of partnership. After all,
many lawyers argue, making partner isn't the guarantee of job
security that it once was; law partners are sometimes
squeezed out of the more competitive Washington firms. But
partners do share the privilege of charting a firm's
financial course and dividing up the rewards. "Some people
like the idea of being at risk," explains Robert Jordan of
Steptoe & Johnson who headed the D.C. Bar commission that
wrote the new rule.</p>
<p>Curiously, it wasn't the lobby-oriented Washington law
firms that initially pushed for the change. That impetus came
when a small public-interest law firm petitioned the D.C.
Bar's ethics committee to ask whether it could grant a
partnership to an economist. The committee was headed by Mark
Lynch, then a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union,
now a partner at Covington & Burling. Mr. Lynch says that he
found the restriction "condescending" but that the bar rules
as written didn't permit the partnership. So Mr. Lynch
referred the matter to Mr. Jordan's committee. The
petitioning lawyer, whose identity the D.C. Bar won't
disclose for reasons of confidentiality, has since left
Washington, according to Susan Gilbert, the D.C. Bar's ethics
counsel.</p>
<p>Allowing nonlawyer partners was proposed and rejected in
1983 by the ABA. The new D.C. Bar rule will likely stir
further heated debate this summer when the ABA House of
Delegates convenes in Chicago. Nonlawyer partnerships were
also struck down in North Dakota's state supreme court in
1987 after the state bar proposed a plan similar to
Washington's. But "Washington, D.C., is a different kind of
place from Fargo, North Dakota," asserts Mr. Jordan. "The law
practice in D.C. requires a lot more innovative and different
arrangements than you'd find in a typical, medium-sized
American city."</p>
