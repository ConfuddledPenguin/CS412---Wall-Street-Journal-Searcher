	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Merck & Co. announced the publication of a
manual of geriatrics that is likely to join the broader Merck
Manual as a reference book widely used by doctors and
patients.
   The 1,267-page Merck Manual of Geriatrics is designed to
help fill an "information gap" that often leads to
"suboptimal care for the elderly sick," said William Abrams,
the book's co-editor. The book covers a range of topics,
including common diseases and injuries that afflict the
elderly, legal and ethical issues surrounding the treatment
of chronically ill patients, descriptions of Medicare,
Medicaid and private insurance as well as a variety of social
and psychological issues.</p>

Company officials said they expect first-edition sales of
about 200,000 copies.</p>
