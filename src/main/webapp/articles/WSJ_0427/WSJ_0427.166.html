	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- In another blow to the nation's banking
industry, Standard & Poor's Corp. downgraded the long-term
and most short-term debt of Citicorp, the nation's largest
bank.
   The downgrading affected $30 billion of debt and preferred
securities of Citicorp, the parent of Citibank. The lone
obligation that escaped the downgrading was Citicorp's
commercial paper, an important source of short-term funds
that was affirmed at A1-plus.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Standard & Poor's cited Citicorp's "aggressive" posture in
maintaining levels of capital and reserves for possible loan
losses well below those of competing banks.</p>
<p>While Citicorp debt remains investment-grade, the
downgrading is bound to raise the cost of money for the bank
and to intensify pressure on Chairman John S. Reed to boost
capital and reserves for loan losses through asset sales and
issuance of new common shares.</p>
<p>In a statement, Citicorp said, "We are disappointed in
S&P's action. We are confident that the strength of
Citicorp's core businesses and well-positioned global
franchises will continue to provide excellent returns and
growth."</p>
<p>The announcement of the downgrading came after the close
of trading yesterday. orp shares ended unchanged at $22.375
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
<p>Citicorp is the 44th and largest U.S. banking company to
have its credit ratings downgraded in recent months. The
downgradings reflect worries about the banking industry's
rising level of bad loans, particularly for commercial real
estate in the Northeast and Southeast, and about bank loans
for highly leveraged transactions, such as leveraged buy-outs
and recapitalizations.</p>
<p>Just last week, the other major rating agency, Moody's
Investors Service Inc., announced a review of Citicorp
obligations for a possible downgrade. In the wake of that
announcement, yields on Citicorp debt have climbed.</p>
<p>Citicorp, with $230 billion of assets, is by far the
largest U.S. bank holding company. Long noted for its
aggressive banking practices, Citicorp has kept its capital
and reserves for loan losses at levels below those of most
competitors. At a recent meeting for securities analysts, Mr.
Reed said, "I'm as concerned about capital efficiency as
capital sufficiency."</p>
<p>At the end of the first quarter, Citicorp reported equity
of 3.6% of assets, well below the industry norm of 4%. That
places it near the bottom of the nation's 50 largest banking
companies. Moreover, analysts noted that percentage drops to
2.9% when they factor in good will, or the premium paid over
book value in acquisitions, and an adjustment for an
accounting change that Citicorp hasn't yet adopted.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Citicorp's nonperforming loans, especially on
commercial real estate and highly leveraged transactions,
have climbed sharply, but reserve levels have lagged well
behind.</p>
<p>A Citicorp official, however, expects the downgrading to
have a "marginal" impact on Citicorp's earnings this year
because the banking company gets about 60% of its funds from
deposits, which generally aren't affected by ratings changes.
Last year, Citicorp raised about $2.5 billion in long-term
debt and expects to sell even less long-term debt this year.</p>
<p>As of March 30, Citicorp's $4.5 billion reserve for
possible losses stood at 61% of its loans that are more than
90 days past due and 2.8% of total loans. Most competitors'
reserves generally are 70% to 80% of past-due loans and about
5% of total loans.</p>
<p>A Citicorp official maintained that those industry norms
may be appropriate for some banks but not for Citicorp. The
company's global reach and diverse product lines, the
official said, give it an inherent stability that allows it
to run with leaner reserves and capital.</p>
<p>S&P reduced the double-A rating on Citicorp's long-term
debt to double-A-minus and the rating on its subordinated
debt to single-A-plus from double-A-minus. Citicorp's
preferred stock was dropped to single-A from single-A-plus.
The rating on its flagship Citibank's letters of credit,
certificates of deposit and deposit notes was reduced to
double-A/A-1-plus from double-A-plus/A-1-plus.</p>
