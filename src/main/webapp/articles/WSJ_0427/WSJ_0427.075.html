	<p class="article-leader">U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved the sale of the assets of
Learjet Corp., a unit of Integrated Resources Inc., to
Bombardier Inc., the companies said.
   Bombardier agreed earlier this month to acquire the
Learjet assets for $75 million. Integrated Resources, a New
York investment concern, is operating under Chapter 11
protection from its creditors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Bombardier and Integrated said the sale is expected to
close on or about May 31. Under the sale agreement Bombardier
also will assume Learjet's short-term debt of about $38
million.</p>
<p>Learjet will be Bombardier's third major aerospace
acquisition since 1986 and will more than double the Montreal
concern's share of the world market for business jets.</p>
<p>Bombardier is the dominant manufacturer of transit and
passenger rail equipment in North America and a major player
in Europe. Yesterday, on the Montreal Exchange, Bombardier's
Class A stock closed at C$15.375 ($13.25), up 62.5 Canadian
cents; its Class B shares closed at $15.25, up 12.5 Canadian
cents.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Integrated common closed at 25 cents, off 3.25 cents.</p>
<p>Stephen D. Weinroth, chairman of Integrated, said the
company expects to present to the bankruptcy court in New
York a proposal for the sale of its interest in American Real
Estate Partners L.P. within two to four weeks.</p>
