	<p class="article-leader">Last fall, the new network television season was an
unmitigated disaster. Insipid sitcoms like "Chicken Soup"
disappeared without a trace. Advertising executives gleefully
bashed the networks' new shows, the majority of which were
promptly canceled.
   But this year, something different is happening. Ad
executives looking out to the fall are actually saying nice
things. It's quite uncharacteristic of them, really.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Last season, we thought it was going to be terrible, and
we were right," says Joseph Ostrow, executive vice president
and corporate media director at Foote, Cone & Belding
Communications. But this coming fall "is probably the best
program development that we've seen in the last four or five
years."</p>
<p>"I frankly am very optimistic about" the fall season,
agrees Betsy Frank, a senior vice president of Saatchi &
Saatchi Co.'s Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising, who recently
completed an upbeat report about the coming season. This is
the first time she has felt optimistic in "a long time -- and
I've been working on these reports for at least 10 years."</p>
<p>The three major networks plus Fox Broadcasting are
currently deciding about 112 pilots, which they will narrow
down to 25 to 30 to be introduced as series in the fall.
There's no guarantee that a pick will be a success, and it
isn't even yet clear which of the 112 pilots will make the
cut. But ad-agency media executives are bullish because so
many of the pilots seem like original ideas, unlike last
year, a year so crammed with copycat concepts that Foote Cone
dubbed it the "season without reason."</p>
<p>What sounds fresh and new to trained media executives, of
course, may sound just plain weird to the rest of us. Among
the pros' favorite picks is ABC's "Cop Rock," a combination
rock opera and police drama. They're also high on Fox's
"Babes," about three beautiful 200-pound-plus sisters, and
CBS's "Shangri-La Plaza," a sitcom-operetta with no spoken
dialogue that takes place in a mall.</p>
<p>Other pilots seem even more unlikely. NBC's "Red Pepper"
follows the career of a marionette who is also a successful
talk-show host. Then there's ABC's "Plymouth," a drama about
a small town that, after a toxic spill, is forced to relocate
-- to the moon.</p>
<p>Ironically, viewers have religious and "new
traditionalist" activists to thank for the fall season's
bizarre new pilots. Last fall, in response to outcries by
people like Terry Rakolta, the Michigan woman who urged
advertisers to boycott Fox's "Married . . . With Children,"
among other shows, the networks played it safe. Afraid of
scaring off advertisers, they chose noncontroversial shows
that followed already successful formulas. They failed
miserably; the shows were so dull that 13 out of 23 new
programs on the three major networks were promptly canceled.</p>
<p>This fall's far more daring lineup is simply a reaction to
the overstultified programs last season, media executives
say. "What we saw last fall was a safe and cautious mixture
of programs premiering," notes Ms. Frank of Saatchi. "Most of
them died pretty quickly, and that taught some people a
lesson: Maybe you aren't going to get into any trouble with
your advertisers -- but if people aren't going to watch these
shows, then what do you accomplish?"</p>
<p>The networks have also been emboldened by some unlikely
midseason successes. Fox's surprise hit "The Simpsons," about
an obnoxious animated family, as well ABC's newest winner,
the eerie "Twin Peaks" -- both introduced since January --
have sparked a more daring attitude at the networks, media
executives contend. "The networks see now that programming
that's different and a little bit chancey has a tendency to
work sometimes. They're going to take more chances this
year," says Lou Bullock, manager of program services for
Omnicom Group's BBDO.</p>
<p>If the fall season does turn out to be a winning one --
which, by the way, is still a big "if" -- it won't
necessarily have an immediate effect on prices charged to
advertisers. Good programming doesn't always lead to higher
ad prices, just as lousy programming doesn't always lead to
low prices. After all, last season -- a season almost
everyone agreed offered dismal new programming -- set a new
record for TV ad-time sales, thanks partly to strong ad
demand by car companies introducing new models.</p>
<p>But over time, media executives say, the networks may be
able to stem the erosion of their audiences with more daring
shows, and in turn bolster prices. "We see that people will
watch network television if you put the right shows on the
air," says Saatchi's Ms. Frank. "We see that at a time when
the networks are bemoaning the fact that audiences are
declining, they can actually bring more people into the TV
arena."</p>

<p>Reaching Pinball Wizards</p>
<p>At the pinball arcade, players may soon find "Mandarin
Orange Slice" flashing along with the "tilt" light.</p>
<p>This month, WMS Industries, parent company of Williams
Electronics Games and Midway Manufacturing, begins
distributing its new "Rollergames" pinball machine complete
with advertising messages. "Rollergames" features ads for
Pepsi, Mandarin Orange Slice, Mug Root Beer and Thermos,
among others.</p>
<p>WMS says the new ad venue offers advertisers an
opportunity to reach young people while they play pinball.
It's attractive, WMS says, because players spend on average
three minutes playing the game, and often there are others
who watch. WMS says its machines can flash a company's logo
and also sing its ad jingle, perhaps when a player hits a
high-score bumper.</p>
<p>"Our machines talk to the players as they play the game,"
says Neil Nicastro, executive vice president at WMS. He
wouldn't say how much it costs an advertiser to link up with
a game, but said that once purchased, an ad would stay on a
machine for its life.</p>

<p>Ad Notes. . . .</p>
<p>CLOROX BOYCOTT: Christian Leaders for Responsible
Television, or Clear-TV, said it ended its boycott on Clorox
Co., a product boycott that apparently didn't have any effect
on Clorox's sales. Clear-TV announced the boycott last July,
charging Clorox with advertising on programs with excessive
"sex, violence, profanity and anti-Christian stereotyping."
The boycott was scheduled to last a year, but Clorox
approached the group and said it would more closely monitor
the TV programs on which it advertises. A Clorox spokesman
said, however, the firm's sales were up in the first half of
its fiscal year, compared with the year-earlier period.</p>
<p>NEW ACCOUNTS: Walt Disney Co., Los Angeles, named Rubin
Postaer & Associates, Los Angeles, to handle the creative
portion of the ad account for the Disney Channel. Billings
weren't disclosed. . . . Showtime Satellite Networks, a unit
of Viacom International, awarded its consumer and trade ad
account to Rosenfeld, Sirowitz, Humphrey & Strauss, New York.
Billings weren't disclosed.</p>
<p>TRANSIT ADS: Transportation Displays Inc., New York, said
it was granted the license to advertise on public
transportation vehicles in a number of cities in the Soviet
Union. The company said it signed contracts with a number of
transit ministries, including a contract that will allow it
to advertise on more than 14,000 buses in Moscow.</p>
<p>BUDWEISER CONTRACT: Anheuser Busch said it signed a
contract with ESPN, in which the St. Louis-based brewer will
spend more than $100 million advertising on the cable network
over the next five years.</p>
