	<p class="article-leader">Norwegian industrial and energy concern Norsk Hydro AS
said pretax profit in the first-quarter tumbled 27% to 1.62
billion kroner ($249 million) from 2.23 billion kroner in the
first quarter a year earlier.
   Norway's largest company said its operating profit fell
26% to 1.89 billion kroner from 2.57 billion kroner in the
first three months of 1989, despite a 31% gain in oil and gas
operating profit to 797 million kroner from 608 million
kroner.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Per-share earnings were 4.00 kroner vs. 6.10 kroner in the
year-earlier period.</p>
<p>Norsk said results were hurt by the agriculture, light
metals and petrochemicals divisions, which suffered from
prices lower than in 1989.</p>
<p>The light metals division reported a 55% decline in
operating profit to 471 million kroner from 1.05 billion
kroner.</p>
<p>Norsk announced plans to expand its Norwegian aluminum
production by 44% to 915,000 metric tons a year at a cost of
around 10 billion kroner.</p>
<p>Hydro Aluminium AS produces 635,000 tons a year of the
light metal. Expansion plans concern smelters at Aardal Verk
and Sunndal Verk. Per-Christian Endsjoe, executive vice
president of the unit, said the first stage of the expansion
could be completed as early as 1993 or 1994.</p>
