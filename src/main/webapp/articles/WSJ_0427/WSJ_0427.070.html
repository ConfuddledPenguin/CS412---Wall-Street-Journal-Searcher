	<p class="article-leader">SEOUL, South Korea -- Confidence in the South Korean
economy continues to flag as export growth stubbornly refuses
to pick up, inflation begins to climb and a strike by the
bellwether Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. union bodes more
labor strife.
   The result was clear on the South Korean stock market
yesterday, where the composite index tumbled 3.83% to close
the day at 726.11, the lowest since Oct. 18, 1988, when it
hit 717.77. All listed shares posted declines.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The most optimistic analysts expect that it will fall to
about 650 within weeks, even though the South Korean
government is expected to announce today yet another attempt
to boost confidence. Analysts said the major Korean
securities companies are pooling money for a "stock
stabilization fund" to prop up falling shares.</p>
<p>But previous attempts by the government to boost the
economy and the market have only depressed the market
further. There is little the government can do. Inflation is
running at a 12% annual rate, so cuts in the discount rate,
which many had hoped would be made to boost the market, have
been ruled out. "If they cut the interest rates now, the
stock market would only fall again because of the fears of
inflation," said Chung Jin Ho of Prudential-Bache Securities
in Seoul.</p>
<p>The market has been slipping since it hit a high of 1007
on April 1, 1989. Inflation worries, predictions of corporate
earnings declines and panic selling by individual investors
who make up 70% of the Korean market have been major factors.
The fall has accelerated in recent days because of labor
unrest. The strike at Hyundai Heavy in Ulsan, about 190 miles
southeast of Seoul, added to the jitters. The shipbuilding
giant's union members walked out this week to protest the
government's arrest of several union leaders. The government
issued a stern warning yesterday that it considers the
Hyundai strike illegal and will "deal firmly" with the
walkout. Thousands of riot police are massed outside the
gates of Hyundai Heavy, where striking workers are staked
out.</p>
<p>The government also has been plagued by a strike at
state-owned Korea Broadcasting System. The issue isn't money
or work conditions, but the government appointment of a new
network chief, whom the union dislikes.</p>
<p>Until now, unions had been quiet, settling for smaller
raises than in years past. Executives fear that a strike by a
major union, such as at Hyundai Heavy, will embolden other
unions.</p>
<p>The mood is dark enough that most Koreans don't believe
reports from the country's major think tanks and the Bank of
Korea that gross national product will grow about 7% this
year. Angry investors have trashed brokerage-firm offices
across the country; many of the offices are now closed to
walk-in customers.</p>
<p>A market turnaround may be slow in coming because, says
Kim Hun Soo, an analyst with Daewoo Securities, "the general
investor is fed up with the market and the rate of return,"
and is pulling out. New money, tied up in real estate,
doesn't flow in because owners fear selling real estate may
pique the interest of tax collectors who have been ordered to
crack down on land speculators.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, companies are being asked to swallow cost
increases to keep consumer prices down. That will cut
earnings. Exports aren't expanding despite the depreciation
in the currency against the dollar because Japan's yen has
depreciated much more against the dollar, giving the Japanese
the export advantage.</p>
