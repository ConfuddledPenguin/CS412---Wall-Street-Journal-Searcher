	<p class="article-leader">NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. -- Johnson & Johnson boosted its
dividend 17% and reported that first-quarter net income fell
23% because of a charge related to economic turmoil in Latin
America.
   Net income at the health products concern fell to $244
million, or 73 cents a share, from $317 million, or 95 cents
a share, a year earlier. The $125 million, or
38-cent-a-share, charge included provisions for writing down
and restructuring units in Argentina and for paying
additional interest on now-liquidated debt in that country.
Sales rose 16% to $2.84 billion from $2.45 billion.</p>

share, raising the per-share dividend on an annual basis to
$1.36, compared with the previous rate of $1.16. The next
dividend is payable June 5 to stock of record May 22.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,

<p>In the first quarter, Johnson & Johnson's consumer
products business world-wide posted a 15% sales increase.
International sales rose 31%, principally because of gains in
Brazil, which continued to have high inflation.</p>

posting a 15% increase.</p>
