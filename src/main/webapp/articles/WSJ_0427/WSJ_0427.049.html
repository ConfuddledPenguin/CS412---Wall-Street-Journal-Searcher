	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Japanese exports of cars, trucks and buses in the
year ended March 31 fell 6% to 5.8 million units from 6.2
million a year earlier, marking the fourth consecutive
fiscal-year decline, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers'
Association said.
   But in March, exports rose for the first time since
August, increasing 0.8% to 551,997 units from 547,798 a year
earlier, when the year-to-year rise was 18.5%. Except for
August, vehicle exports had been declining every month from
year-earlier levels since March 1989. The association said
the general trend of fewer exports remains the same.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Japanese auto makers are continuing to meet overseas
demand by producing at local facilities, particularly in the
U.S. and Europe, which has caused Japanese exports to
dwindle.</p>
