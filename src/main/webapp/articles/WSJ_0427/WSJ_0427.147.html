	<p class="article-leader">Whirlpool Corp., hurt by deep losses in its Brazilian
interests, said first-quarter net income fell 28%, despite a
3.8% revenue increase.
   The Benton Harbor, Mich., maker of home appliances
reported net of $29.5 million, or 42 cents a share, down from
$40.7 million, or 59 cents a share, the year earlier. Revenue
rose to $1.64 billion from $1.58 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Whirlpool said its "very strong earnings performance" in
the latest period was chilled by a 26-cents-a-share loss from
its equity interest in Brazilian operations; the year-ago
period had a loss of two cents a share from such operations.</p>
<p>Brazil's economy has been brought to a "temporary
standstill" by recently introduced austerity measures there,
Whirlpool said, adding that there are modest signs of gradual
improvement.</p>
<p>The company said North American revenue, operating profit
and unit volume rose, and added that it recorded a "solid"
first quarter in its European operations, which continue to
face tight margins.</p>
<p>In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Whirlpool common closed at $21.375 a share, up 37.5 cents.</p>
