	<p class="article-leader">C.E. "Chuck" Shultz, who spent 28 years with Tenneco
Inc.'s oil arm before its assets were sold in a landmark 1988
auction, was named chief executive officer of Gulf Canada
Resources Ltd., the flagship energy holding of Canada's
wealthy Reichmann family.
   Mr. Shultz, a soft-spoken Oklahoman who moved to Gulf
Canada as president and chief operating officer last fall,
said in his first interview since joining the company that he
aims to expand the company's operations abroad significantly,
and challenge conventional wisdom by stepping up the search
for what he believes are big undiscovered pools of oil and
gas in heavily explored western Canada.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The appointment of Mr. Shultz, 50 years old, to succeed S.
Keith McWalter, 64, who also is retiring as chairman, wasn't
unexpected. But its timing clears the air about who will run
a yet-to-be-named new company that the Reichmanns propose to
form through the merger of Gulf Canada and a smaller concern,
Home Oil Co. Both companies are based in Calgary, Alberta.</p>
<p>The proposed merger would create Canada's third-biggest
oil producer and fifth-biggest natural gas producer, with
assets of about five billion Canadian dollars (US$4.31
billion).</p>
<p>Mr. Shultz, who has broad international experience in the
upstream-exploration and production-sector of the oil
business, said he is particularly interested in adding a
"third leg" to Gulf Canada's operations in north Africa and
Europe, which would complement its activities in western
Canada and Indonesia.</p>
<p>He also said he is bullish on the prospects of bolstering
Gulf Canada's diminishing reserves in western Canada, where
production and cash flow have also been hurt, prompting
several bond rating concerns to downgrade the company's debt
securities.</p>
<p>"My impression of western Canada is that there's still a
lot of oil to be found," he said. "It's not nearly as heavily
drilled as the U.S., where reserves have been added" by
further drilling at established fields.</p>
<p>About 50% of Gulf Canada's C$350 million exploration and
development budget this year is earmarked for western Canada,
with an additional 30% going to frontier projects, and the
rest dedicated to international activities.</p>
<p>Mr. Shultz, described by Joe B. Foster, his former boss at
Tenneco, as "an aggressive guy and a good motivator" who
likes being "right in the middle of the fray," said it could
take a decade for Gulf Canada's presence in north Africa and
Europe to match its current profile in Indonesia. But he said
an acquisition in those regions "is an option" in the longer
term.</p>
<p>Despite criticism by analysts that Gulf Canada is overly
wedded to frontier holdings that don't generate any cash flow
and will be expensive to develop, Mr. Shultz said the company
is still committed to expanding its production in places such
as Canada's remote Beaufort Sea. But he said production there
probably won't begin until after the year 2000.</p>
<p>"If we're bearish on Beaufort, it's not because it doesn't
have potential," Mr. Shultz said. "It's because of today's
cost. For a company our size, it doesn't take many C$70
million wells before you run out of money to put in it."</p>
<p>Details of the proposed merger with Home Oil, which has
significant land holdings in western Canada, a better record
than Gulf Canada of replacing reserves, and steady cash flow
of about C$200 million annually, are expected to be disclosed
in a few weeks.</p>
<p>Executives of Home Oil, a unit of Calgary-based Interhome
Energy Inc., said they don't know what role they will play,
if any, in the merged company. But people familiar with the
companies, both inside and out, say there isn't any doubt
that Mr. Shultz has been tapped to lead Gulf Canada's
successor.</p>
<p>Gulf Canada also named Robert Butler, a low-profile
company director, to succeed Mr. McWalter as chairman.
Analysts said they see the move as a possible "interim"
appointment.</p>
