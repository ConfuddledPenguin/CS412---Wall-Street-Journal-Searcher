	<p class="article-leader">ALBANY, N.Y. -- New York state health officials resolved a
dispute with Perrier Group of America Inc. and said they
would allow the Greenwich, Conn., company to begin selling
Perrier water yesterday, as scheduled.
   Officials had delayed approval for Perrier to re-enter the
state, after a sample of the bottled water showed too much
sodium for the company to use the term "sodium free" on its
labels, under Food and Drug Administration regulations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Perrier proved to the commission satisfactorily that the
sample we saw was a fluke," a New York State Department of
Health spokesman said. "They don't know what happened, but
obviously it was a contaminated sample."</p>
<p>Perrier recalled its water world-wide in February, after
small amounts of benzene were found in some samples. The new
Perrier is marked with labels that read "nouvelle
production."</p>
<p>Perrier Group, a unit of Source Perrier S.A. of France,
said Perrier meets all FDA and New York state standards. It
also said it agreed to work with the New York State
Department of Health and the New York Legislature "to develop
additional bottled water and mineral water standards, as
appropriate."</p>
