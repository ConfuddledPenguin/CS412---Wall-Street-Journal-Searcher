	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Drivers are being cheated out of more than
$150 million a year as a result of inaccurate octane labels
on gasoline pumps, according to a congressional report.
   The report, based on a two-year study by the General
Accounting Office, found that drivers who thought they were
paying for high-octane gasoline, which can cost as much as 20
cents more a gallon, received low-octane fuel. The problem is
especially prevalent in the 28 states that currently don't
have octane-testing programs; GAO findings for four of those
states showed mislabeling in 22% to 53% of the gasoline sold.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Although the vast majority of gasoline distributors and
dealers are honest, the report shows too many instances of
motorists being cheated for us to ignore," said Rep. Phil
Sharp (D., Ind.), who released the report at a news
conference with Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.).</p>
<p>A fuel's octane rating refers to its resistance to engine
knock, a pinging sound caused by improper combustion that can
lower engine efficiency, reduce mileage and increase
emissions. Gasoline is generally sold in three octane levels.
Fuel with a high-octane rating burns more smoothly and is
more expensive than low-octane gasoline. Although most cars
run as well on regular gasoline, many people buy high-octane
gasoline in hopes of improving performance. The car's octane
requirements also vary depending on driving conditions.</p>
<p>The Environmental Protection Agency and the Federal Trade
Commission are required by law to test gasoline for its
octane content and enforce federal labeling requirements. The
agencies, however, citing staff and budget cuts, haven't
carried out the tests since 1981. The GAO report noted that
neither agency has asked Congress for additional funds to
carry out the testing requirements.</p>
<p>The lack of an enforced federal testing program makes it
hard to determine how extensive the mislabeling is. Victor
Rezendes, GAO director of energy issues, said the problem may
be costing consumers more than $500 million annually.</p>
<p>The states that test for octane content are Alabama,
Arkansas, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia,
Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri,
New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South
Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia and Wisconsin.
The GAO obtained test results for 11 of these states. It
found mislabeling of less than 2% of the gasoline sampled in
seven of the states and mislabeling of more than 2% of
gasoline in the four other states.</p>
<p>Michigan, New York and Washington plan to put statewide
testing programs into place; New York City already conducts
tests. Rep. Schumer released figures from New York City's
consumer affairs department showing that last year, 146 of
280 gasoline stations in the metropolitan area were cited for
octane violations.</p>
<p>Rep. Sharp said he is drafting legislation that would
broaden the testing and enforcement powers of the states.
Some state officials have said that efforts to prosecute
individuals or companies for mislabeling octane gasoline
pumps are hampered by uncertainty about whether their laws
are pre-empted by the federal requirements.</p>
<p>Mr. Sharp also plans for his legislation to make clear
that octane-labeling rules apply to reformulated gasoline and
the other alternatives to conventional fuels that are likely
to become more widely used as a result of pending clean-air
legislation.</p>
<p>The GAO said that most of the mislabeling occurs at
distribution points and retail stations, rather than at
refineries and bulk terminals where there is frequent
testing. Some of the mislabeling may be unintentional, the
agency said. Robert Kelley, deputy director for enforcement
of New York City's consumer affairs department, said, "It's
unintentional when you get high-octane gasoline when you pay
for low octane. It's intentional when you get low octane
after paying for high."</p>
