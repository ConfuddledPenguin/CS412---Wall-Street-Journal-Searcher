	<p class="article-leader">First Constitution Financial Corp. reported a
first-quarter loss and suspended the dividend. The New Haven,
Conn.-based company also said merger talks with an investor
group unraveled.
   The savings institution's loss was $39.4 million, or $3.60
a share, compared with year-earlier net income of $5.1
million, or 47 cents a share. First Constitution said the
principal reason for the loss was a $36.4 million addition to
reserves for loan losses and real-estate investments.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company said the value of its thrift equity portfolio
was written down by $3.5 million, but John J. Crawford,
president and chief executive officer, said, "Capital remains
well above all regulatory requirements." First Constitution
said that nonperforming assets at March 31 were $201.7
million, while reserves totaled $80.6 million. Total assets
were $2.4 billion.</p>
<p>In October, First Constitution said it had agreed to be
acquired for $25 a share, or $273.5 million, by two related
investor groups created for the purpose. In February, it said
the investors wanted to renegotiate the deal.</p>
<p>In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, First
Constitution closed at $3.875, off 62.5 cents.</p>
