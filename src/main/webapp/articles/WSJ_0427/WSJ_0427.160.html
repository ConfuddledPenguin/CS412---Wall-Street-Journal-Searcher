   Unions' Offer Is `Doable'</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">The chairman of Chicago-based UAL Corp., Stephen M. Wolf,
told shareholders he believes a buy-out proposal from United
Airlines' three unions is a "doable transaction," after he
was pummeled with questions from holders skeptical of the
offer.
   Mr. Wolf was generally optimistic about the offer's
chances of success. At the same time, some of the statements
he made at UAL's annual meeting yesterday could hamper the
unions' efforts to obtain bank financing for the $4.36
billion bid.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Wolf, who the unions want to replace, criticized the
terms the bid offers to United's 26,000 non-unionized
employees. He also said he plans to announce a major aircraft
order shortly, a move that would place additional debt on the
airline at the same time the buy-out group is trying to
obtain financing.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf didn't say why he believes the unions' buy-out
proposal is unfair to non-unionized employees. The
concessions required under the unions' proposal are far less
than the concessions Mr. Wolf sought from the non-unionized
workers as part of an earlier labor-management bid. That bid
collapsed last fall when the buy-out group failed to obtain
financing.</p>
