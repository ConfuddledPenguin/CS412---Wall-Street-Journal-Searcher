	<p class="article-leader">Allied-Signal Inc. said profit edged up 2.4% in the first
quarter, restrained by results of its automotive business,
but pershare earnings climbed 5.8% because of company stock
repurchases over the past year.
   Net income rose to $129 million, or 90 cents a share, from
$126 million, or 85 cents a share, a year earlier, the
company said, as results from the aerospace and engineered
materials businesses offset lower earnings in the automotive
segment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales for the Morris Township, N.J.-based company
increased 6.8% to $3.1 billion from $2.9 billion quarter.</p>
<p>The company said earnings from the aerospace business rose
10% to $54 million in the first three months of the year,
reflecting a 4% sales increase and lower interest, sales and
administrative costs. The Energy Management and Services
Group and the Engine Group had higher sales and earnings, the
company said. These were partly offset by slimmer margins for
the Avionics Group and higher engineering and development
costs for new engines and auxiliary power units, the company
said.</p>
<p>Automotive net income fell 14% to $32 million in the first
quarter, although automotive sales increased 8%, the company
said. The sales increase was due in part to favorable foreign
exchange and new product sales for anti-lock braking systems
and air bags, the company said. Increased selling and
interest costs, lower sales in the North American brake and
safety-restraint businesses and lower margins for
turbochargers more than offset higher after-market profits,
the company said.</p>
<p>"We remain hopeful that the domestic automotive business
will rebound in the second half of the year," said Edward L.
Hennessy, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer.</p>
<p>The company said earnings from the engineered materials
business rose 2% to $63 million in the quarter, despite a 2%
drop in sales. The segment had increased earnings in the
quarter from high-density polyethylene and improved
performance by the company's UOP process technology joint
venture, which offset lower sales and profits for fibers and
uranium hexafluoride, a gas used by the nuclear fuel
processors, and higher costs in the Norplex Oak laminates
business that makes boards for printed circuits.</p>
<p>Largely due to a corporate stock-repurchase program,
Allied-Signal's average shares outstanding fell to 142.8
million in the latest quarter from 148.3 million shares in
the year-earlier period.</p>
