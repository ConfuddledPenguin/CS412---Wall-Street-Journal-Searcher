	<p class="article-leader">Citizens & Southern Corp. reported that first-quarter
earnings fell 28% to $41.6 million, or 64 cents a share,
reflecting a $54.8 million charge for problem loans.
   The quarter's results, which compare with $57.8 million,
or 90 cents a share, posted the year before, were slightly
better than many analysts had expected.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Last week, some analysts slashed profit estimates as much
as 50%, from a range of 93 cents to 97 cents a share,
following the Atlanta superregional's announcement that
results of a special examination by the U.S. Comptroller of
the Currency could force Citizens to take a first-quarter
charge to offset possible loan losses.</p>
<p>The targeted exam is part of a current sweep by federal
regulators of commercial real-estate portfolios at big banks
in the Southeast. The exams, in most cases, have been
followed by charges to the companies' first-quarter earnings.</p>
<p>Citizens' first-quarter addition brings its problem-loan
reserve to $248.9 million, a 15% increase from the $216.2
million set aside at year-end 1989. Loan write-offs decreased
31%, however, to $22.1 million from $31.9 million at
year-end.</p>
