	<p class="article-leader">THE U.S. AND SOVIETS REACHED an accord to normalize trade
relations.
   For the first time in half a century, Washington and
Moscow agreed to a trade pact that would offer the Soviet
Union most-favored-nation status, meaning that its goods
could enter the U.S. at the lowest tariff rates, a senior
U.S. negotiator announced. The accord requires congressional
approval. A Bush administration official recently said that
superpower trade soon could total as much as $15 billion a
year, compared with between $1 billion to $3 billion in
recent years.</p>

<p>CHENEY PROPOSED reductions in Pentagon plans for the
Stealth bomber.</p>
<p>In a major concession to congressional budget-cutters, the

Stealth bombers envisioned by the Defense Department, and he
urged significant cuts in two other aircraft projects.
Intended to save $35 billion over the next eight years,
Cheney's recommendations would involve cutting 90 aircraft
from the Air Force's planned 210plane fleet of C-17 troop
transports. He also proposed stretching out development of
new jet fighters.</p>

Qinghai region.</p>

demonstrations to mark the fourth anniversary of the
Chernobyl nuclear plant explosion. It was the Soviet Union's

<p>The Justice Department found that Georgia's process for

court judgeships in 30 of 45 judicial circuits will cease to
exist unless election laws are changed.</p>

reportedly claimed responsibility for the slaying.</p>

<p>Former hostage Polhill returned to the U.S. after three

Army Medical Center in Washington for medical tests.</p>

<p>West Germany's Social Democrats said skar Lafontaine, who
was stabbed in the neck Wednesday at a campaign rally in

was committed to a psychiatric hospital.</p>

which sailed a monohull vessel.</p>
