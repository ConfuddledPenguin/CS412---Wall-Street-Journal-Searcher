	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- A former director of Citadel Holding Corp.
sued the company and another former director for allegedly
fraudulently preventing him from acquiring a controlling
stake in Citadel.
   Alfred Roven, in a complaint that was filed in U. S.
District Court here, charged that James J. Cotter ousted Mr.
Roven from Citadel's board in 1987 so that he could gain
control of Citadel, a Glendale, Calif., savings and loan
holding company that owns Fidelity Federal Bank.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Roven, who is seeking $15 million in compensatory
damages and $15 million in punitive damages, claimed that
proxy materials distributed prior to a May 1987 annual
meeting were false and misleading because they did not
disclose Mr. Cotter's plan to oust Mr. Roven and install
three Cotter nominees on the board.</p>
<p>Mr. Cotter not only won re-election to the Citadel board
at that meeting, but he got approval for a change in the
company's certificate of incorporation that allowed him to
increase his Citadel holdings, the suit said.</p>
<p>Mr. Cotter then allegedly caused Citadel to oppose Mr.
Roven's application to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to
acquire more than 10% of the company.</p>
<p>Mr. Cotter allegedly caused Citadel to spend close to $10
million pursuing the acquisition of Valley Federal Savings &
Loan. That allegedly allowed Mr. Cotter and affiliated
companies to sell Valley Federal stock at an inflated price
before the thrift's stock price plummeted after substantial
losses were made public.</p>
<p>During that time, Mr. Cotter concealed and then thwarted a
$74-a-share acquisition offer by Home Federal Savings & Loan
for Citadel so that Citadel could continue pursuing Valley
Federal, the suit said.</p>
