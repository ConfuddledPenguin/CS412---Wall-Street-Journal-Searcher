	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Britain's Guinness PLC is pinning much of its
huge spirits division's future on a campaign uncorked last
year to revive the tarnished image of Scotch whisky.
   Upgrading the status of hard liquor in the eyes of
drinkers marks both the third and most crucial stage of a
revamping of the Guinness spirits unit, prompted by what the
company sees as a flight to quality among drinkers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It's the longest and the toughest" stage "and the one
that will ultimately determine if we succeed," says Tony
Greener, managing director of the company's United Distillers
division.</p>
<p>The image-polishing efforts by Guinness cut across all its
spirit brands, which include Gordon's and Tanqueray gins and
vodkas, Pimm's and IW Harper bourbon.</p>
<p>But the focus is clearly on its flagship liquor, scotch,
and a handful of high-quality brands under which it is
marketed in different countries, among them White Horse,
Bells and Johnnie Walker.</p>
<p>Scotch sales alone accounted for between 50% and 75% of
the company's #691 million ($1.13 billion) pretax profit
during the last fiscal year, analysts reckon, and many
forecast double-digit profit growth for scotch for the next
two years.</p>
<p>Overall, the spirits division racked up #542 million in
pretax profit last year, up 23% from the #440 million
realized in 1988. Analysts expect the division to pull in
between #620 million and #645 million in 1990 against
companywide pretax profit of between #808 million and #843
million.</p>
<p>Spirits mark the largest of a number of successes for
Guinness, which also owns big brewing operations, gourmet
food and wine, a publishing division and a 24% stake in the
French luxury goods group, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton
S.A.</p>
<p>Shortly after crafting United Distillers in 1987 from a
string of acquisitions, the company set out on a three-point
strategy to resurrect the reputation of hard liquor in a
world that had been won over to beer, wine and soft drinks.
Guinness's first move was to remake its marketing
organization; this was followed by a clampdown on
distribution.</p>
<p>In the past year, it has launched the last of the three
phases, aimed at polishing the image of its products. Armed
with an annual $250 million ad budget -- more than double
that of 1987 -- as well as a potent range of labels, Mr.
Greener says United Distillers hopes to win back respect for
spirits within five years.</p>
<p>Guinness entered the spirits world with its 1985
acquisition of Arthur Bell for #360 million. It followed that
with its purchase of Distillers Co. in 1986 for #2.5 billion
and Schenley in 1987 for #480 million.</p>
<p>Guinness paid dearly in penalties and bad publicity for
Distillers, a volume-driven group that flooded the market
with an enormous range of brands.</p>
<p>In the wake of the acquisition, Guinness was found in
breach of takeover regulations in its handling of the hostile
bid and last year was forced to pay #85 million in
compensation to former Distillers shareholders. A number of
former Guinness executives and advisers are now on trial on
charges ranging from attempting to pervert the course of
justice to destroying and falsifying documents.</p>
<p>United Distillers has surfaced from beneath the cloud of
the "Guinness Affair" sporting a vastly different structure.</p>
<p>High volume had marked the late 1970s and early 1980s,
which saw a glut of scotch brands and a decline in demand. To
pull its spirits operations out of a potential bog, Guinness
hired Mr. Greener away from what is now Dunhill Holdings PLC
in 1987 to spearhead the revival. For Mr. Greener, credited
with switching Dunhill's focus from tobacco to luxury goods,
taking Guinness in a new direction was familiar work.</p>
<p>Mr. Greener pulled the division through what he describes
as "12 months of quite a lot of grief" during which "we
completely changed the whole organizational structure of the
business."</p>
<p>Mr. Greener sees an opportunity to re-establish the image
of its upscale liquor brands in the midst of a trend toward
more moderate intake in food and drink. Rather than volume,
he says, consumers are leaning toward an "appreciation of
good things."</p>
<p>United Distillers culled the cheaper brands from its
product ranges. In the United Kingdom, for example, the
number of brands was slashed by about half. Similar moves
were made elsewhere.</p>
<p>Some analysts say that the number of labels is still quite
a handful. But most point out that every country has its own
favorites, and United Distillers must offer a range of prices
for its quality products in each market.</p>
