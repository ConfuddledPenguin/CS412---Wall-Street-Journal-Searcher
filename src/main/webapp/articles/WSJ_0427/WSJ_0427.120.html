	<p class="article-leader">NEWARK, N.J. -- B. Manischewitz Co., Jersey City, applied
to plead no contest to a federal indictment that it conspired
to fix the price of matzo served during Passover.
   The company, which earlier denied the charges and claimed
that its prices are fair, faces a penalty of $1 million, and
possibly more. The maximum penalty depends on the size of the
company's unlawful gains or the losses of consumers, said a
U.S. Justice Department spokesman.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The U.S. Attorney here objected to the company's plea
request. U.S. District Judge Harold Ackerman gave the
government until May 11 to file papers explaining its
objection. Manischewitz will have until May 16 to respond to
the government's filing. On May 23, Judge Ackerman will
decide whether to accept the request.</p>
<p>Justin P. Walder, Manischewitz's lawyer, says the request
to plea no contest "seemed like the practical and reasonable
alternative when you take into account the narrow scope of
indictment, the age of the allegations, the cost of defense
and prosecution and everyone's time."</p>
<p>The conspiracy took place from "sometime in 1981" through
at least April 1986, the complaint says. Manischewitz,
according to the complaint, took in about $25 million of
revenue from sales of Passover matzo products in the U.S from
1981 to 1986.</p>
