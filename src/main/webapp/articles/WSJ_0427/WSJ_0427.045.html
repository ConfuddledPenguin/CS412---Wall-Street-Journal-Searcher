	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Riding a wave of popular support at home, Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu sets out tomorrow for a nine-day tour
of South Asia to show Japan's commitment to Asia and to
helping developing economies.
   While the rest of Japan celebrates the annual Golden Week
of holidays, Mr. Kaifu will pay official visits to India,
Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Indonesia. It is the
first time in six years that a Japanese head of state has
visited the region.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Foreign Ministry officials say the purpose of his trip is
to reassure Japan's neighbors that despite all the recent
changes in Europe, Tokyo still places a high priority on
South Asian economic development. Officials say Mr. Kaifu
will stress that whatever Japanese aid and investment goes to
Europe it will not come at the expense of South Asia and the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN.</p>
<p>Japan is already South Asia's biggest foreign aid donor,
handing over $1.1 billion in official development assistance
and loans to India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka in
1988, up from about $970 million in 1987. Indonesia, the
single largest recipient of Japanese aid, received about $984
million in aid and loans in 1988, up from $707 million in
1987.</p>
<p>But since there are no major burning political issues
between Japan and these countries at the moment, political
analysts say Mr. Kaifu is likely to use the diplomatic junket
to further bolster his domestic standing.</p>
<p>"Increasingly, Japanese prime ministers have limited room
for action at home. So they rely on foreign policy to enhance
their domestic power," says Takashi Inoguchi, a professor of
political science at Tokyo University.</p>
<p>Already, Mr. Kaifu appears to have grasped this tactic. In
his early days in office, he was seen as a puppet prime
minister, easily manipulated by former Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita. But since the Lower House elections in February,
Mr. Kaifu has won high marks for his delicate handling of
heated bilateral trade issues with the U.S. A recent poll by
the Yomiuri Shimbun showed his approval rating has risen to
56.1%, up from 52.9% in March and the highest since he was
inaugurated last August.</p>
<p>At the same time, political analysts say Mr. Kaifu wants
to widen Japan's foreign policy field beyond ties to the U.S.
"He wants to show that he has contacts in Asia," says
Hiroichi Yamaguchi, a senior researcher at the Institute of
Developing Economies in Tokyo.</p>
<p>While the timing of the trip takes advantage of the
holiday lull in Japan, observers say it also gives Mr. Kaifu
the chance to sound out South Asian leaders on their views on
global issues before the summit of advanced industrialized
nations in Houston this July. Increasingly, developing
countries in Asia are relying on Japan to voice their
concerns at international meetings.</p>
<p>Analysts also expect that the governments of India,
Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka will all ask the Japanese
government to encourage more private investment in their
countries. Currently, less than 1% of Japan's overseas
investment goes to South Asia.</p>
<p>For all the expected toasts to improving relations, few
political analysts expect Japan to suddenly start playing a
more active role in the region's conflicts. Foreign Ministry
officials say Mr. Kaifu will encourage the governments of
India and Pakistan to continue their efforts towards peace,
but that Japan has no intention of playing a role as a
mediator.</p>
