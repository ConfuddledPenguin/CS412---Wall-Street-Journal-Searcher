	<p class="article-leader">SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Maxtor Corp. said it named one of its
executives, Taroon Kamdar, president of a unit formed to
manage the assets of troubled disk-maker MiniScribe Corp.
   Mr. Kamdar, 44 years old, has been running the Longmont,
Colo.-based MiniScribe since the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Denver approved Maxtor's $46 million bid for MiniScribe's
assets earlier this month. Maxtor, which makes data-storage
products, said Mr. Kamdar retains his position as Maxtor's
vice president for corporate development.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>MiniScribe, which last year said its previous management
had improperly manipulated its financial results, sought
protection in January from creditors under the federal
Bankruptcy Code after it was unable to settle a number of
lawsuits and bondholder lawsuits against it.</p>
