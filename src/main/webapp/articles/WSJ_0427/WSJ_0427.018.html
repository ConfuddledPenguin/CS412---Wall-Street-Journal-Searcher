	<p class="article-leader">After reading "LA Residents Grow Ever More Negative Toward
Film Crews" (page one, March 30), I had to wonder why
production companies would continue to film where they are
not wanted. So many towns and cities could use "an average of
$32,450 a day" boost to their economies. If Los Angeles does
not want the film crews, then location managers should choose
other cities.
