	<p class="article-leader">OPEC plans to keep next week's meeting brief and to a
single point -- output cuts -- to prop up the price of
petroleum.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries'
ministers intend to announce at their Geneva meeting, which
begins Wednesday, production cuts that, at least on paper,
will total more than one million barrels a day.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>According to people close to the organization, the
reductions are likely to apply only through May and June,
reflecting OPEC's effort to calm world oil markets in the
face of the traditionally soft second-quarter demand. It is
expected to announce second-half production quotas at a
midyear conference that begins June 25.</p>
<p>OPEC sources confirmed that the ministers are leaning
toward announcing a 5% cut for the two months, probably
across-the-board. It's understood that the three big Persian
Gulf producers that have been producing above their quotas --
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates -- will
agree to reduce output if the others make a similar, if only
symbolic, gesture.</p>
<p>But the impact on the actual pace of OPEC oil output is
less clear. For one thing, it isn't known if the ministers
intend to figure the percentage cut against OPEC's official
first-half production ceiling of 22 million barrels a day or
on its actual output, which has been running up to two
million barrels a day higher.</p>
<p>More important, nearly half the reductions to be announced
may have already been made. OPEC in recent weeks has been
making some involuntary reductions in output. The oil glut,
brought on by excess OPEC production, has clogged shipping
and storage facilities, and created balky buyers. According
to people who monitor OPEC production, members are now
pumping less than 23.5 million barrels a day, down from
March's 24 million barrels a day.</p>
<p>"Markets have become swamped with Mideast crude to such an
extent that producers are now unable to find buyers because
storage tanks are simply too full to take any more," OPEC
Listener, an industry analysis service, reported. Also, some
OPEC producers are curbing output rather than offer deeper
price discounts, the service added.</p>
<p>Such constraints recently have trimmed as much as 200,000
barrels a day off Kuwait's output and 100,000 barrels a day
from Saudi Arabia's production, according to industry
analysts. Some other Persian Gulf producers, such as the
Emirates, have had to curtail production because of oil field
maintenance.</p>
<p>Oil markets have remained volatile, however, and some oil
ministers are known to be worried that a fractious OPEC
meeting next week might trigger a collapse in petroleum
prices, which are already down one-fourth from early this
year.</p>
<p>And the outcome or conduct of an OPEC meeting is never
easy to predict. The Geneva session isn't intended to be a
full ministerial conference; it is billed only as a meeting
of the committee of eight ministers who are charged with
reviewing markets and making recommendations. But all 13
ministers of OPEC have been invited and are expected to
attend, which means the meeting could be turned into a
full-blown special conference at a moment's notice.</p>
<p>That would open the door to discussions of any topic,
including controversial ones ministers now hope to avoid, and
prolong the time OPEC ministers are in the spotlight. As a
result, there is speculation that OPEC's leading members have
a premeeting agreement to keep the session as short as
possible -- no more than two days -- and to avoid debate on
such contentious topics as production quotas.</p>
<p>"The ministers will meet the second {of May} and the
third, and it will be over," said a senior OPEC official
yesterday.</p>
