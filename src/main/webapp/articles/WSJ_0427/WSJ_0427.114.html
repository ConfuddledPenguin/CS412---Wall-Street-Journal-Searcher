	<p class="article-leader">Whenever Congress debates campaign reform you can be sure
the real issue -- incumbent protections that limit political
competition -- won't be addressed. This week Congress debated
a proposal to require that all candidates be charged the
lowest possible rate by TV stations for their commercials. At
the same time, the House Administration Committee is about to
approve an extra $203,000 to hire new technicians for the
House TV studio. That's what Members use to send
taxpayer-paid satellite feeds and taped programs back to
their districts. Last year the existing staff had to put in
more than 4,000 hours of overtime to satisfy the demand. With
more than half the country able to get the privately financed
C-SPAN network, the only reason a propaganda organ like the
House TV studio exists is to ensure another election in which
98% of incumbents win.</p>
