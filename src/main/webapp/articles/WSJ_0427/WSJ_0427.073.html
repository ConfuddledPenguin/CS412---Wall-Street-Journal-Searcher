	<p class="article-leader">HONG KONG -- Foreign bankers in Hong Kong have heard
plenty of negative talk in the past year about the colony's
future, but true to their trade, they also have tallied the
factors on the plus side of the ledger. By their reckoning,
it's worth staying.
   Many foreign bankers concede that they considered pulling
up stakes after Beijing's bloody crackdown on the democracy
movement in June. With China scheduled to regain sovereignty
over the British territory in 1997, the bottom line seemed to
have taken on the imprint of tank treads.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yet last year and so far in 1990, 14 foreign banks have
been granted new licenses, and 37 others have opened
representative offices. Even the most pessimistic among them
continue to regard Hong Kong as the region's financial
center.</p>
<p>Their commitment rests on a kind of paradox: China is both
one of the biggest attractions and potentially the biggest
disincentive. Despite the sharp decline in the Chinese
economy since late 1988 and some new problems with some old
loans, foreign bankers still view China as a worthwhile
long-term investment -- and Hong Kong as the gateway to that
potential.</p>
<p>And even though Hong Kong is a tough, competitive banking
center in which not all banks make money, many consider it
essential to be in the colony. In their opinion, no other
Asian city offers the high level of English and technology,
the ease of transportation and communication, the depth of
experience and breadth of financial institutions, the
personal and commercial freedom.</p>
<p>Other places may draw attention as regional centers for a
single area of business, as Singapore has in foreign-exchange
trading, but bankers say none is poised to replace Hong Kong.
According to the banking commissioner's office, Hong Kong has
135 foreign banks and 167 representive offices of other
foreign institutions, far more than Tokyo or any other Asian
city.</p>
<p>To be sure, some of Hong Kong's advantages would quickly
fade in the face of another political explosion like
Tiananmen Square. Even on a day-to-day basis, foreign bankers
continue to feel the effect of China's turmoil, as skilled
local personnel vote with their feet on Hong Kong's future
and make staffing a constant strain. Nonetheless, it is
considerably easier for banks to stay put than to move, and
they feel no pressure to make any decision now.</p>
<p>"I'm actually reasonably confident Hong Kong will remain
enough the same to keep a good deal of the banking business
here," says Alan Hargreaves, head of research for Hoare
Govett Asia Ltd., a stockbrokerage firm.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's banking commissioner, Anthony Nicole, believes
the industry will thrive up to and after 1997.</p>
<p>That view is cautiously echoed by Steve Price, who is
regional director overseeing Citicorp's retail-banking
operations in Hong Kong. "The potential for dislocation
between now and 1997 is there, and how Hong Kong will evolve
after 1997 is uncertain," Mr. Price says, but he quickly adds
that Citibank's Hong Kong operations "will be here in 1997
and we will be here after 1997."</p>
<p>Many bankers envision a growing role for banks in Hong
Kong in financing China's expanding foreign trade and its
need for improved infrastructure. They are looking beyond the
bad economic news of the past 18 months to increasing
commercial opportunities during the coming decade and beyond.</p>
