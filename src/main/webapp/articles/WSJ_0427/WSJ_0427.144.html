	<p class="article-leader">Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. said its first-quarter loss
narrowed to $72 million from $116.1 million a year earlier.
   The Orlando, Fla., publishing and insurance company
indicated that the smaller loss was the result of three
factors. First, the publishing division's operating loss
narrowed to $28.7 million from $46.1 million. Second,
interest expense fell to $58.1 million from $87.4 million.
And third, the year-earlier period had a loss from
discontinued operations of $18.5 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The latest loss was $1.07 a share compared with $1.80 a
share. Revenue rose 15% to $276.9 million from $241.6
million.</p>
<p>A Harcourt director said Wednesday that the company is
considering the sale of some of its assets to Thomson Corp.,
a Toronto publishing and travel concern. Officials at
Harcourt confirmed that the company is talking with third
parties about possible asset sales and is considering the
sale of some or all of Harcourt's existing public debt. But
Harcourt wouldn't identify the third parties or indicate what
assets might be sold.</p>
