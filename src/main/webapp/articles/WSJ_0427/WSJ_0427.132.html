	<p class="article-leader">MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Sun Microsystems Inc., continuing
to contain costs while improving margins, posted an 18% rise
in third-quarter earnings, generally better than analysts had
expected.
   The maker of high-performance desktop computers said net
income in the quarter ended March 30 rose to $36.7 million,
or 40 cents a share, from $31 million, or 38 cents a share, a
year earlier. Revenue increased 27% to $632.2 million from
$497.4 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sun attributed the increased earnings to a host of
factors, including improved inventory management and tighter
financial controls instituted in recent quarters. The
company, whose margins in the past deteriorated because of
heavy spending, said it had a gross profit margin of 46%, its
highest in 18 months.</p>
<p>"In most respects, it was a superlative performance," said
Peter Rogers, an analyst with Robertson Stephens & Co., San
Francisco. "The company outdid itself."</p>
<p>With this quarter, analysts said the company has largely
put behind it the problems of last summer when Sun stumbled
on a major product transition, had difficulty in obtaining
enough parts to build and ship new products and difficulties
with a new management-information system.</p>
<p>Still bothering some industry observers, however, is the
unevenness of domestic markets. Sluggish capital spending has
resulted in low or declining U.S. sales for many computer
concerns. Sun, for instance, said that more than 50% of its
business in the quarter was generated by European and Asian
orders. A Sun spokeswoman said the continuing sluggishness
would result in a modest fourth quarter in U.S. markets, but
that the firm doesn't expect that to hurt overall
fourth-quarter results.</p>
<p>Buoyed by the earnings report, which exceeded Wall Street
estimates of 30 cents to 35 cents a share, several analysts
boosted their expectations for the year. Mr. Rogers, for
instance, said he raised his estimate to $1.20 a share from
$1.10 a share.</p>
<p>For the nine months, the company said net declined 23% to
$62.1 million, or 70 cents a share, from $81.1 million, or $1
a share. Revenue rose 32% to $1.77 billion compared with
$1.33 billion.</p>
