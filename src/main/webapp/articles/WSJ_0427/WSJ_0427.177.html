	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Thanks to some surprisingly good earnings
reports, stocks finished higher for the second straight day
despite another slump in the bond market.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 10.14 to 2676.58.
The advance lacked broad participation: 764 issues declined
on the New York Stock Exchange while 677 advanced. Broader
market indices also gained, but not as much: Standard &
Poor's 500-Stock Index rose 0.89 to 332.92; the New York
Stock Exchange Composite Index rose 0.36 to 182.66; and the
Dow Jones Equity Market Index gained 0.60 to 310.12. Volume
on the Big Board totaled 141,330,000 shares.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Treasury bond yields rose through the 9% level at
midmorning to 9.03% late in the day, a move that dragged down
stock prices. But stocks rebounded in afternoon trading, as
investors began buying stocks of large companies that have
reported strong earnings in recent days.</p>
<p>"Even companies where earnings were down year over year
are reporting earnings that are higher than the consensus,"
said Joseph J. McAlinden, head of research at Dillon Read.
"And a broad cross-section of companies are coming in with
higher-than-expected earnings."</p>
<p>One was Compaq Computer, which reported first-quarter
earnings of $2.13 a share, sharply ahead of most forecasts.
Earlier this week, investors shunned the stock, fearing bad
news. But yesterday Compaq shares recovered with an explosive
opening gain of 6. The stock finished 4 1/4 higher at 98 1/4
on 1.4 million shares.</p>
<p>Today's report on first-quarter gross national product may
confirm the aggregate strength in the economy that seems to
be showing up in the earnings of many companies. A consensus
of estimates by economists polled by Dow Jones Capital
Markets report forecasts GNP growth at an annual rate of
2.7%. In the fourth quarter of last year, GNP rose at a 1.1%
rate. Additionally, two inflation measures based on GNP are
expected to have climbed at rates of more than 5% in the
quarter, well above fourth-quarter levels.</p>
<p>Mr. McAlinden said the stock market's resilience in the
face of rising bond yields "is telling you that the American
business cycle is pretty decent."</p>
<p>Said Thomas R. Walsh, head of equity trading at Nikko
Securities International: "On balance, I've seen people ready
to buy stocks now, which I haven't seen in a long time."</p>
<p>Among other shares of large companies that are attracting
investors because of their earnings performance,
Bristol-Myers Squibb gained 2 1/8 to 54 7/8 on volume of 2.1
million shares. Prudential-Bache Securities increased its
1991 and 1992 earnings estimates and repeated a buy
recommendation on the stock.</p>
<p>Du Pont, which rose 7/8 Wednesday after its first-quarter
earnings report met expectations, added another 1 1/8 to 37
on 1.7 million shares. First Boston raised the stock's
investment rating to "strong buy" from "buy" and increased
its estimate of 1990 earnings. The firm took the same action
on Dow Chemical, whose shares gained 7/8 to 62 1/4.</p>
<p>Procter & Gamble, which gained 1 1/8 Wednesday in response
to a well-received earnings report for its fiscal third
quarter ended last month, advanced another 1 1/4 yesterday to
70 3/4.</p>
<p>Sara Lee went down 7/8 to 28 5/8 on 1.8 million shares
after Merrill Lynch trimmed its earnings projections for
fiscal 1990 and 1991 in the wake of Sara Lee's fiscal
third-quarter earnings report, issued Wednesday. The firm now
expects Sara Lee to report net income of $1.92 a share for
the year ending in June, down from a forecast of $1.95, and
$2.15 to $2.20 a share for the next year, down from $2.20 to
$2.25.</p>
<p>Steven A. Kroll, president of SLH Asset Management, said
the recent rise in rates and numerous disappointments in the
first-quarter results released so far have made "proven
earnings growers" look more attractive.</p>
<p>"Earnings, earnings and earnings -- that's the key," Mr.
Kroll said, adding that any rallies in the market at this
point "are going to be suspect" while the bond market
struggles and rates remain high.</p>
<p>Safeway closed 10% above the price at which underwriters
sold a 10% stake in the company in an initial public
offering. Ten million shares were sold in the offering at
$11.25 each; the supermarket company's stock ended the
session at 12 3/8, with 2.2 million changing hands.</p>
<p>Norton, which slid 1/2 to 88 1/4, was the most active Big
Board issue for the second consecutive session as 2.6 million
shares were traded. BTR of Britain, whose takeover offer of
$75 a share for the company was rejected, disclosed that it
had sold its entire 1.7% stake. As reported, Norton accepted
a $90-a-share bid from France's Saint-Gobain.</p>
<p>Republic New York dipped 1/8 to 43 3/8 on 1.2 million
shares following the sale of about four million shares at
$43.50 apiece, made in connection with the company's
acquisition of Manhattan Savings Bank.</p>
<p>Illinois Power fell 1 7/8 to 16. A hearing examiner with
the Illinois Commerce Commission recommended that the utility
receive a rate increase of $27.7 million, rather than the
$215.7 million increase it requested.</p>
<p>Seagull Energy rose 1 to 22 5/8. The company reported that
first-quarter earnings rose about 23% from a year earlier and
the full-year outlook is "very positive."</p>
<p>Conversely, Gleason tumbled 2 3/8 to 18 3/4 after posting
first-quarter net from continuing operations of 10 cents a
share, compared with a loss from continuing operations a year
earlier.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 0.23
to 344.75. Volume totaled 15,030,000 shares compared with
16,060,000 Wednesday. There were 266 issues advancing, 271
declining and 245 unchanged.</p>
<p>Weatherford International gained 3/8 to 5 7/8 after the
completion of an offering of three million shares, sold at
$5.50 each.</p>
