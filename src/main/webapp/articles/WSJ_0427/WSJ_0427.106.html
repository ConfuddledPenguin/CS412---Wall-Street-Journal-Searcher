	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- Chrysler Corp., which will have closed two
assembly plants by year-end, appears to be mulling moves that
would allow it to close another one a few years from now.
   Chrysler currently is thinking about ways to consolidate
production of certain vehicles into fewer plants, company
executives recently said in trade publications. Included in
the review, a company spokesman said yesterday, is a possible
shift of Jeep assembly to an Ohio plant from another plant in
Canada.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a statement issued yesterday, Chrysler said "plans that
could affect the Jeep assembly plant in Toledo, Ohio are
under review." The statement added that "final decisions are
contingent upon successful negotiations with the (United Auto
Workers) and the support of state and local governmental
units."</p>
<p>But in a Toledo television interview Wednesday night, U.S.
Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D., Ohio, said Chrysler officials told her
that the company's Toledo plant will receive new products
after 1992. The Toledo plant, which now builds the Jeep
Cherokee, Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer, operates under a labor
agreement that expires in 1992.</p>
<p>According to Ms. Kaptur, Chrysler Chairman Lee A. Iacocca
said Chrysler will move production of the Jeep Wrangler to
Toledo from its plant in Brampton, Ontario by mid-1992. She
also said Mr. Iacocca told her that the auto maker will build
a new sport-utility vehicle in Toledo by mid-1993.</p>
<p>Chrysler called Ms. Kaptur's comments "premature." A UAW
spokesman declined to comment on the union's discussions
regarding the Toledo and Brampton plants. The Brampton plant
is represented by the Canadian Auto Workers union, a separate
organization. The Wrangler is the only product built there.</p>
<p>Industry analysts say they think Toledo will be getting
production of the small sport-utility vehicle that Chrysler
is developing with Renault S.A. of France. Under such an
arrangement, the Jeep Cherokee, now built in Toledo, would be
shifted to a new plant that Chrysler is building in Detroit.
This scenario, analysts suggest, depends on whether the state
of Ohio and the city of Toledo will give Chrysler tax relief
or grants to improve the Toledo plant.</p>
<p>Separately, General Motors Corp. said it will temporarily
idle its Arlington, Texas, assembly plant starting April 30
to prepare for changes for production of the 1991 Chevrolet
Caprice and Cadillac Brougham.</p>
<p>The No. 1 auto maker said the plant, which currently
builds the 1990 version of those models and the Custom
Cruiser Wagon, is scheduled to resume production in June.
About 3,100 workers will be affected by the downtime.</p>
<p>Ford Motor Co. said its Lorain, Ohio, assembly plant that
builds Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar cars will be idled
for one week because of slow sales. About 2,700 workers will
be affected.</p>
<p>Overall, the 10 major U.S. auto makers plan to build
137,916 cars this week, down 15.2% from 162,705 a year ago.</p>
