	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- One by one, cabinet officials have shuffled
through the heavy wooden doors leading to the West Wing of
the White House to learn, sometimes painfully, about the
troika that really controls domestic policy in the Bush
administration.
   These power brokers are the Bush administration's three
free-marketeers: John Sununu, the rumpled
engineer-turned-politician who is White House chief of staff;
Richard Darman, the consummate Washington operator who is
budget director; and Michael Boskin, the professorial
economist who is chairman of the Council of Economic
Advisers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Together, these three have effectively shaped a social and
economic philosophy for George Bush, a president whose true
passion is foreign policy. They have been able to do so both
because they are in sync with the president's general
instincts on domestic affairs and because they know that the
way to please the gentlemanly Mr. Bush is to win debates
quietly, without allowing them to become public spectacles.</p>
<p>Under their approach, economic growth is the holy grail,
free markets are sacrosanct and free trade is the American
mantra. They constitute a powerful "blocking coalition" that
swats down proposals at odds with this philosophy, says
William Niskanen, an economist in the Reagan White House who
now heads the Cato Institute, a libertarian think-tank.
Together they have thwarted Commerce Department schemes to
aid the high-definition television business, curbed the
Transportation Department's interest in restricting foreign
investment in airlines, and been instrumental in steering the
administration away from again formally citing Japan this
year as an unfair trader.</p>
<p>Yet in an important twist on Reagan-era conservatism, the
troika isn't reflexively anti-government. The three endorse
government intervention in selected cases; to help working
parents with child-care costs and to expand rights of the
disabled, for instance.</p>
<p>"These are people who believe problems can be fixed and
believe government can be brought to bear to fix them . . .
that all it takes is the right brains and right political
skills," says Deborah Steelman, a former Bush campaign policy
adviser who is now a Washington lawyer.</p>
<p>And for all their hand-wringing about the budget deficit,
Messrs. Sununu, Darman and Boskin also agree that government
should spend more on basic research and development that is
too esoteric or expensive for the private sector.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, for instance, Energy Secretary James
Watkins and Deputy Secretary Henson Moore were called to Mr.
Sununu's office to meet with him and Mr. Darman to discuss
estimates that a giant new atom smasher in Texas probably
would cost $8 billion, $2 billion more than previously
estimated. At the meeting, Mr. Sununu asked lots of questions
about the design. Mr. Darman, his budget knife sheathed,
volunteered that the "supercollider" didn't crowd out
spending for other research. Their verdict was to plunge
ahead. "Pure science has to be provided for," Mr. Sununu
explains.</p>
<p>But the troika's priorities sometimes appall some
Democrats. Rep. Richard Durbin of Illinois was taken aback at
a congressional hearing when Mr. Darman flatly declared that
he would rather take budget cuts in housing than in space
programs. "As far as I'm concerned, the Bush rhetoric about
kinder and gentler hasn't translated into the shifts of
funding I'd like to see," Rep. Durbin says.</p>
<p>The Sununu-Darman-Boskin axis first formed during Mr.
Bush's presidential campaign, when they were among a select
group called to his Maine home for a June 1988 brainstorming
session. They had lunch together, found themselves
philosophically attuned and stayed in touch. "Campaigns tend
to bind," Mr. Sununu says. "People go through a tough time
together." These days, the informal axis accomplishes much of
its work in the dozens of unpublicized meetings and informal
hallway conversations in which the Bush administration makes
important decisions.</p>
<p>The three aren't absolute equals. Messrs. Sununu and
Darman, whose jobs give them levers to control day-to-day
decisions, wield more raw power. Mr. Boskin stands out as the
first chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers to have
the president's ear since Alan Greenspan in the Ford years.
They also differ in temperament. Mr. Darman is often ruthless
with his staff; Mr. Sununu is considerate to his staff but
can be nasty to others; Mr. Boskin is relentlessly polite.</p>
<p>The three share an academic background that each cites in
explaining their relationship. Mr. Sununu was an engineering
professor at Tufts University before he became governor of
New Hampshire. Mr. Darman taught at Harvard between stints in
the Ford and Reagan administrations. Mr. Boskin is on leave
from a teaching job at Stanford. Academia instilled in them a
common love for verbal jousting that they find stimulating,
but that colleagues sometimes find grating or arrogant.</p>
<p>Mr. Darman's debating techniques were particularly evident
during internal arguments over the new Clean Air bill, which
he considered grossly expensive. One official recalls Mr.
Darman reading aloud from a government report on health
effects of smog: "Prolonged exposure can result in . . .," he
read, then paused dramatically. ". . . Coughing."</p>
<p>The Export-Import Bank got a vivid lesson in how the three
operate earlier this year when it prepared a plan to help
exporters by subsidizing interest rates on commercial bank
loans already guaranteed by the federal government. Mr.
Darman was appalled at what he considered to be an
unwarranted dollop of government aid for business. He alerted
Mr. Sununu, Mr. Boskin and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady,
whose personal friendship with the president makes him a
valuable ally on occasion.</p>
<p>When Ex-Im Bank Vice Chairman Eugene Lawson formally
proposed the plan at a cabinet-level meeting at the White
House, Mr. Darman pounced. He delivered a withering critique,
objecting both to the concept and to what he saw as a
transparent scheme to circumvent restraints on the federal
budget. Mr. Boskin chimed in, echoing the Darman arguments.
Others at the table whose departments had once supported the
scheme quickly backed away. Mr. Lawson was sent back to the
Ex-Im Bank with orders to reconsider.</p>
<p>The bonds between Mr. Sununu and Mr. Darman are
particularly tight. Mr. Sununu clearly is Mr. Bush's closest
aide, seeing him at the start and close of every business day
and often personally negotiating with Congress on sensitive
legislation.</p>
<p>Mr. Darman, in turn, is Mr. Sununu's closest ally. The two
meet informally at about 7:15 every morning in Mr. Sununu's
office, and then talk as frequently as two dozen times a day.
Their collaboration is so constant it sometimes spills into
their social lives. Mr. Sununu was unhappy several weeks ago
with remarks the Environmental Protection Agency had prepared
for a presidential speech on global warming, fearing they
suggested that Mr. Bush was willing to force drastic cutbacks
in American use of coal and petroleum products to cut carbon
dioxide emissions.</p>
<p>So Mr. Sununu rewrote sections of the speech himself. At a
birthday party that night for Vice President Dan Quayle, he
slipped a copy of the edited version to Mr. Darman at the
dinner table. The budget director penciled in a few changes
of his own, and their version was sent to the president.</p>
<p>Mr. Boskin, meanwhile, has transformed his post, which had
atrophied into irrelevance, into a potent force, largely by
cultivating close ties to President Bush himself. Mr. Boskin
sends the president a personal memo on some aspect of the
economy virtually every night, and Mr. Bush sometimes
responds with a handwritten note or by calling Mr. Boskin at
his Georgetown home. When the president invited tennis stars
John McEnroe and Andre Agassi to his private quarters at the
White House, he made a spur-of-the-moment call to Mr. Boskin,
a regular Bush tennis partner, to come over.</p>
<p>Mr. Boskin shares with his partners a strong dislike for
grand government plans that they think smack of the kind of
centralized planning that socialist economies now are
abandoning. Recently, he learned through an aide of a report
the Energy Department was drafting on public hearings it had
held as it draws up a national energy policy. He concluded
that, among other things, the draft Energy Department
document didn't adequately stress the Bush administration's
determination to rely mainly on market forces rather than
regulatory schemes or subsidies to ensure energy supplies.</p>
<p>So he raised a red flag at one of the daily meetings Mr.
Sununu holds for senior White House staffers. Mr. Darman and
Mr. Sununu shared his worries, and the three ordered aides to
revamp the opening section of the report, ensuring that the
word "market" appeared three times in one early paragraph and
striking entirely seven "action items" declaring a national
consensus behind policies the administration hadn't yet
debated.</p>
<p>Of course, the Sununu-Darman-Boskin trio isn't always in
agreement. Mr. Darman battled more vigorously than the other
two against parts of the administration's Clean Air bill; he
and Mr. Boskin also argued that Mr. Bush should criticize the
bill passed by the Senate for deviating from an agreed-to
compromise.</p>
<p>Mr. Sununu brokered a solution. Posing for photos with
Senate leaders, Mr. Bush made a little-noticed statement
congratulating the Senate leaders for "a major step forward,"
but pointedly termed their bill "only a first step" toward
striking a balance between environmental benefits and
economic costs.</p>
<p>Conservatives generally applaud troika philosophies but
sometimes are unhappy with the willingness to negotiate at
all in such cases. On issues such as clean air, "what happens
is, the Bush proposal becomes the bottom line for bargaining
with Congress," and the outcome is inevitably more expensive,
says Mr. Niskanen.</p>
<p>Combined, the Sununu-Darman-Boskin axis is more powerful
on domestic issues than any single cabinet officer, even an
old presidential friend such as Commerce Secretary Robert
Mosbacher. On high-definition TV, for instance, Mr. Mosbacher
wanted government help for manufacturers so they could
compete better against the Japanese. But after being summoned
to a meeting in Mr. Sununu's office, the secretary backed
down. Under the policy consensus that emerged, the
administration supports removing obstacles to private
businesses in general but opposes "the government picking out
a specific industry or different firms for favors," Mr.
Boskin says.</p>
<p>While the troika's authority hasn't been formalized, it
has by now been noticed by many cabinet officers, who try to
avoid proposals that run afoul of the gospel. Transportation
Secretary Samuel Skinner, for instance, unintentionally set
off alarms in the White House last fall when he forced a
cutback in a planned foreign investment in Northwest Airlines
and seemed to say he wanted more power over debt-financed
airline mergers. After a series of meetings with the troika,
though, Mr. Skinner did an about-face, rejecting proposed
legislation on airline mergers that he once appeared to
endorse.</p>
<p>He also seemed to learn from the experience. Later, when
Mr. Skinner's department was drafting a national
transportation plan, most differences with the White House
were carefully resolved to Mr. Darman's satisfaction at lower
levels -- and Mr. Skinner now is considered a solid "team
player."</p>
