	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Vickers PLC shareholders overwhelmingly defeated
Sir Ron Brierley's attempt to force the engineering concern
to spin off its Rolls-Royce luxury-cars unit.
   By a 2-to-1 margin, holders voted against the New Zealand
entrepreneur's proposal at Vickers's annual meeting
yesterday. The proposal, strongly opposed by Vickers
executives, had been expected to fail.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But Sir Ron evidently doesn't intend to back down.
Yesterday morning, about an hour before the annual meeting
started, Vickers said Sir Ron's IEP Securities Ltd. had
raised its stake in the company to 20.05% from 19.54%. And
Sir Ron, speaking to reporters later during a lull in the
meeting, didn't rule out buying more Vickers shares. IEP will
persist in its efforts to "unlock the value of Rolls-Royce,"
he said, envisioning a timetable of "years, rather than
months."</p>
<p>Sir Ron has spent about two years amassing the stake in
Vickers, an engineering conglomerate with interests in
defense contracting and marine and medical equipment, as well
as its Rolls-Royce Motor Car Ltd. unit. Last March, he
proposed that Vickers issue to existing holders shares in
Rolls-Royce as a separate public company.</p>
<p>The investor argues that a separately quoted Rolls-Royce
would trade at a price of at least 12 times this year's
earnings, compared with Vickers's price-earnings ratio of
about 8.8. Spinning off Rolls-Royce would result in "an
immediate gain for all shareholders of at least 50% in the
value of the Rolls-Royce component of their shares," he told
Vickers holders.</p>
<p>But Vickers executives insisted Rolls-Royce needs the
security of the parent. Sir David Plastow, Vickers's chairman
and chief executive officer, criticized Sir Ron for having "a
really short-term" attitude. Though it is successful,
Rolls-Royce "has a long way to go before it reaches any form
of maturity," Sir David said.</p>
<p>Holders voiced more qualms about the company's plan to buy
Carlton Communications PLC's Cosworth division, a specialty
automotive-engineering unit, for #163.5 million ($267.7
million). Some appeared to agree with Sir Ron, who criticized
the agreed price as "awfully expensive." But the resolution
approving the purchase eventually passed.</p>
