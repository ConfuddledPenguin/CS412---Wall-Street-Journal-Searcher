	<p class="article-leader">TOWSON, Md. -- Black & Decker Corp. said it returned to
profitability after posting losses for three consecutive
quarters.
   The maker of power tools and household appliances said net
income for the first quarter ended April 1 was $10 million,
or 17 cents a share, compared with $25.9 million, or 44 cents
a share, a year earlier. Sales jumped 76%, to $1 billion,
from $570.7 million, reflecting the acquisition last year of
Emhart Corp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company cited higher operating margins, brisk sales in
Europe and generally stronger demand for locks and hardware
in the U.S. among reasons for the improved performance. But
Black & Decker's interest expenses have remained steep since
acquiring Emhart, a move that pushed debt to about 80% of
total capitalization.</p>
<p>For the latest quarter, interest expenses were higher than
expected because of the sluggish pace of the company's
asset-sale efforts and steeper borrowing costs in Brazil. The
company said it plans to implement "additional strategies"
later this year to lower its interest costs.</p>
<p>Those steps will include a program for selling certain
receivables and an effort to restructure the company's
sterling-denominated debt. The company didn't disclose how
much of such debt it has. As of April 1, long-term debt was
$2.85 billion and short-term obligations exceeded $800
million.</p>
<p>This week, Black & Decker sold Emhart's headquarters
building for $17 million. Nolan Archibald, chairman and chief
executive, said the company also has recently applied about
$500 million in Emhart asset-sale proceeds to the reduction
of debt.</p>
<p>However, he noted a "continuing weak retail environment"
in the U.K., a recent slowdown in Australia and
hyper-inflation in Brazil as factors that pose difficult
challenges for the rest of this year.</p>
