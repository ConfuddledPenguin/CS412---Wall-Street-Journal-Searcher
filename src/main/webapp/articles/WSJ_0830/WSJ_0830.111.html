	<p class="article-leader">VIENNA -- The Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, in a bid to reassert its influence over oil
markets, freed its members to pump to capacity during the
Middle East crisis.
   The suspension of production quotas had been expected and
won't significantly change anticipated oil supplies for the
months ahead. The few key OPEC members with substantial
excess capacity had previously indicated they were going to
use it with or without formal approval.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But in announcing the move, OPEC signaled its
determination to take a bigger role in the current crisis
after weeks of indecision. In an official statement issued
here, the ministers said they authorized production increases
to "clearly restate to the world that OPEC stands for market
stability and regular supply of oil to consumers."</p>
<p>OPEC in recent years has attempted to control its
production to avoid the gluts, shortages and severe price
gyrations that cost its members enormous amounts of revenue
and market share in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Consistent with that strategy, Saudi Arabia and other
leading OPEC members have already begun boosting output
following the price run-up caused by the global embargo
against Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil. The action finally taken
yesterday by a majority of the oil ministers sanctions that
output surge. The ministers, who have been meeting since
Sunday, reached a tentative accord earlier this week.</p>
<p>Crude-oil prices fell almost $2 a barrel yesterday, with
traders citing the OPEC agreement and a growing perception of
easing tensions in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Many OPEC ministers here suggested the organization passed
a crucial test. There has been some question about OPEC's
ability to function during this crisis, which has entangled
three of its five founding members: Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi
Arabia.</p>
<p>"OPEC has survived the most critical challenge in its
history," Ginandjar Kartasasmita, Indonesia's oil minister,
said in an interview.</p>
<p>Not all OPEC members were pleased with the outcome,
however. Approval came over the objections of the ministers
of Iraq and Libya, who boycotted the meeting and questioned
its legitimacy. A third opponent, Gholamreza Aghazadeh,
Iran's oil minister, did attend but urged that OPEC not
increase output until after major oil-consuming nations have
drawn down their oil inventories to help fill the supply gap.</p>
<p>Mr. Aghazadeh also tried to have yesterday's ministerial
monitoring committee meeting postponed for a week to permit
joint discussions with the Paris-based International Energy
Agency. The IEA represents 21 major oil-consuming nations.
The 10 other ministers rejected his proposal. Instead, they
called on consuming nations to execute existing oil-sharing
arrangements designed for shortages and to utilize the
"present huge accumulation" of oil inventories.</p>
<p>Despite the OPEC request, a U.S. Energy Department
spokesman in Washington argued that there is no need yet to
draw on strategic reserves. That also will be the U.S.
position at tomorrow's IEA governors meeting in Paris.
Nevertheless, there are signs that U.S. resistance to dipping
into its reserves is softening. With OPEC sanctioning more
production from members that are able to increase output, the
U.S. could consider a small release of oil from its reserve
to help calm markets.</p>
<p>A majority of OPEC members have been producing at peak
capacity for some time, so despite yesterday's go-ahead, only
a handful can do more. These are expected to make up at least
three million of the four million barrels a day formerly
exported by Iraq and Kuwait. Saudi Arabia is understood to
hold two-thirds, or about two million barrels, of that spare
capacity.</p>
<p>Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, left immediately
after yesterday's brief meeting and didn't outline the
kingdom's production plans. OPEC sources said, however, that
it is already producing more than seven million barrels a
day. Its quota had been 5.4 million barrels a day.</p>
<p>Venezuela also is already producing more. Celestino Armas,
oil minister, confirmed output recently was increased 300,000
barrels a day. A further 200,000 barrels a day will be added
by the end of the year, he said.</p>
<p>The United Arab Emirates is pushing up output by 500,000
barrels a day. And although some of the production claims
seem inflated, lesser amounts are likely to come from some
other exporters. Nigeria can produce 250,000 to 280,000
barrels a day more, said its oil minister, Jibril Aminu.</p>
<p>Several of the oil ministers suggested that a tabulation
of all the increases still leaves OPEC slightly short of its
former second-half production ceiling -- 22.5 million barrels
a day -- as long as Iraqi and Kuwaiti output is choked down.</p>
<p>Still, Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, Kuwait's finance minister and
former oil minister who represented that country here, said
supplies should be ample, with oil prices dropping as a
result. "There will be plenty of oil on the market, and there
is definitely no reason for panic," he said.</p>
