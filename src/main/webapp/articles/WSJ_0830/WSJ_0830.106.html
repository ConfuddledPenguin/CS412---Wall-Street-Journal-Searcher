	<p class="article-leader">Charles Lichenstein, then deputy U.S. ambassador to the
United Nations, became a momentary folk hero seven years ago
when, during the crisis touched off when the Soviets shot
down a Korean Air Lines jet, he encouraged the world body to
leave the banks of the East River. "We'll be at dockside
waving you a fond farewell as you sail into the sunset," he
declared.
   But the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, besides upsetting the
balance of power in the Mideast, has promoted a radical
change in the views of the U.N. held by American policy
makers and others. The U.N. has won praise in recent years
for its role in brokering an end to the Iran-Iraq war and the
withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan. For the first
time since its founding 45 years ago, however, the
organization seems poised to realize its potential, coming of
age as a formidable instrument for resolving international
conflicts before they erupt into war.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Today, with Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar set
to meet with Iraq's foreign minister in Jordan in an effort
to end the Persian Gulf standoff, even a lot of longtime U.N.
skeptics believe that the organization may have been born
again.</p>
<p>"The U.N. is in exactly the kind of crisis that it was
designed to deal with: armies crossing borders," says
Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, a former
chief delegate to the U.N. who became known for assailing it
as a captive of resentful Third World nations.</p>
<p>Yet even as the U.N. enjoys its new-found respect, there
are indications that the whiff of hope -- even romance --
surrounding the organization may not last forever. In
particular, the small nations that used the U.N. as a
platform for attacking the industrialized world may now see
the newly united superpowers using it for their own purposes,
ignoring Third World concerns.</p>
<p>"When the superpowers are working together," complains
Abdullah al-Ashtal, Yemen's U.N. delegate, "little attention
is being paid to the smaller countries."</p>
<p>The organization won a second chance when the Cold War
fizzled out and the superpowers stopped using their power to
veto any action benefiting the other. Suddenly the U.N. was
freed from paralysis, emerging as a peacemaking and
nation-building force around the globe.</p>
<p>"The U.N. was a rusty car out in the garage that all of a
sudden someone has discovered could be driven," says Edward
Luck, president of the United Nations Association, a
nonprofit research group.</p>
<p>In February, during the organization's supervision of
Nicaragua's first free elections, U.N. banners declaring that
"your vote is secret" fluttered above polling places in even
the most remote villages. After elections in the new African
nation of Namibia in April, local residents held a series of
farewell bashes for U.N. diplomats, slaughtering sheep and
cattle for the feast. Some Namibians even named their newborn
children Untag, the acronym for the U.N. Transition
Assistance Group.</p>
<p>Just this week the five permanent members of the Security
Council agreed to an unprecedented plan for a truce and U.N.
administration of Cambodia until a new government is elected.</p>
<p>But it was Iraq's invasion of Kuwait earlier this month
that turned all eyes toward the U.N. A series of unanimous
Security Council votes on steps to counter Saddam Hussein's
expansionism suddenly presented a picture of the world body
acting as the world always hoped it could. "If we can pull
this off we have a model . . . with the U.N . . . of how to
deal with the next half-century," Sen. Moynihan says.</p>
<p>But the resolutions dealing with the Iraqi invasion reveal
important institutional flaws remaining. Regardless of how
many resolutions it passes, the U.N. by itself still doesn't
have the muscle to enforce its decisions. "It happens that
the U.S. is eager to enforce this one," says John Ruggie,
director of the University of California Institute on Global
Conflict and Cooperation. "What happens when the U.S. isn't
so eager?"</p>
<p>In addition, some Americans, particularly foreign-policy
conservatives, continue to harbor grave concerns that the
U.N. remains a forum for attacking the U.S. and its economic
interests. "The danger in the Iraq crisis is that people will
say the U.N. isn't so bad after all," says Midge Decter,
executive director of the Committee for the Free World.
"People should be steadier in their enmities."</p>
<p>But even the harshest U.N. critics acknowledge that the
organization has begun playing a useful role in world trouble
spots from Africa to Asia to Latin America. The U.N. is close
to completing an agreement in the long Western Sahara
struggle between Polisario insurgents and Morocco. It is
leading an effort to seek a negotiated peace in El Salvador.
In the Mideast, U.N. peacekeeping forces are stationed in
southern Lebanon, the Golan Heights, the Sinai and, standing
between hostile armies as little as 30 feet apart, on the
Iran-Iraq border.</p>
<p>But the U.N. nearly didn't get off the ground at all
because of disagreements among the great powers when they met
in San Francisco in 1945 to design the organization. With
fresh memories of the failure of the League of Nations -- an
American idea that never won American membership -- war-weary
nations fought over how much power to give the big powers to
allow them to police the world.</p>
<p>The Soviets insisted that each permanent member of the
Security Council -- the U.S., the Soviet Union, Great
Britain, France and China -- should have the power to wield a
veto to end any discussion, investigation or resolution. The
U.S. wanted to limit veto powers, however, arguing that only
decisions of the Security Council, not other business, should
be subject to veto.</p>
<p>Harold Stassen, the former perennial GOP presidential
candidate and the only surviving member among the eight
officials appointed by Franklin Delano Roosevelt to help
create the U.N., says that superpower politics dominated even
this early dispute. Mr. Stassen says that President Truman
dispatched a trusted aide to Moscow to warn Stalin that if he
didn't yield on the point, there wouldn't be a U.N. The
Soviets signed on and the U.N. was born.</p>
<p>The organization, already divided between a General
Assembly in which the smaller nations could debate issues and
a Security Council where the enforcement work would be done,
was from the start paralyzed by the Cold War. Swiftly the
veto became a tool for obstruction -- and the U.N. found
itself hopelessly tangled in ideological disputes.</p>
<p>"The Soviets saw any act of aggression by someone in their
bloc as an act of liberation," says Jeane Kirkpatrick,
President Reagan's envoy to the U.N. "If this were two years
ago, the Soviets and those associated with them would have
defined what Iraq did as an act of liberation."</p>
<p>When Libya invaded Chad in 1983, the 15-member Security
Council did nothing. Chad's foreign minister wandered the
halls of the U.N. in his long, flowing, light-blue robes,
hopelessly in search of support. And several months later,
when Mrs. Kirkpatrick was speaking in the General Assembly in
defense of the U.S. military action on the Caribbean island
of Grenada, several delegates interrupted her remarks and
moved to end the debate. The president of the General
Assembly agreed and she was abruptly silenced.</p>
<p>But in the current Gulf crisis, the U.N. has emerged as an
invaluable tool. President Bush, himself a former U.N.
delegate, understood the potential of the organization for
providing cover and legitimacy for his response to Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait. Without the prospect of U.N. support, he
might not have been able to persuade Saudi Arabia to accept
U.S. troops. Without U.N. action, it would have been more
difficult for an Islamic state such as Turkey to close its
oil pipelines. Without the U.N., the likelihood of Soviet
involvement in international action was slim; from the
outset, Moscow made it clear that it would not move without
the U.N.</p>
<p>The administration has at some points in the current
crisis moved at a slower pace, or shown more caution, than
officials would have preferred -- specifically in order to
keep the five permanent members of the Security Council
moving in unison. For instance, Mr. Bush held off on
unilaterally enforcing the embargo. That was a deliberate
strategy chosen in hopes that this crisis could set a
precedent in which the Security Council showed it would take
concerted action against international aggressors, something
it has seldom done in the past.</p>
<p>Republican Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana, a prominent
foreign-policy voice in the Senate, saw vivid illustration of
the importance of the U.N. when he traveled this month to
Indonesia, an Islamic country that has joined the U.N.
embargo on Iraq. He said that officials there told him that
Jakarta wasn't interested in siding with the U.S. in the
Gulf, but was willing to join a U.N. effort. "For them U.N.
leadership gives them the umbrella they need," Sen. Lugar
says. "It offers a new option to them."</p>
<p>The U.N. also won plaudits for its role in supervising
Nicaragua's elections last February, which resulted in the
surprise defeat of the leftist Sandinista government that had
ruled there for a decade. Nicaragua was the first member
nation that ever invited the U.N. to monitor an election. The
organization moved in seven months before the vote to begin
planning its supervisory activities and by election day had
nearly 200 observers roaming the country in 31 white,
radio-equipped Toyotas and power boats.</p>
<p>At a rural polling place 20 miles from Managua, Rigoberto
Aguirie, waiting in the hot sun to vote, said that "the most
important thing is for people to believe that these elections
will be fair" -- and the presence of the U.N. and other
organizations provided that assurance. Officials from the
international organization tabulated a parallel vote by
sampling each polling place to test the accuracy of the
government's final tally.</p>
<p>But the U.N. also has mastered some of the small details
of diplomacy that become so important in countries where free
elections are a novelty rather than the norm.</p>
<p>While U.N. observers were monitoring a political rally in
Managua last winter, for example, violence erupted and
several rocks were hurled at an opposition-party vehicle. The
U.N. observers remained on the scene after the rally broke
up, taking statements from the car owners and escorting them
to local authorities to ensure that their complaints were
registered.</p>
<p>"It really made a big difference," says Larry Garber, a
consultant to the National Democratic Institute for
International Affairs, an affiliate of the U.S. Democratic
Party that helps promote democracy abroad. "It increases the
confidence of people that they can participate in political
activities and cast their votes freely."</p>
