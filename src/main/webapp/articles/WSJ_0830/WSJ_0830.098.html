	<p class="article-leader">HARTSVILLE, Tenn. -- McDonald's Corp. is testing a 1950's
style diner concept in this archetypical small-town U.S.A.
   Called the Golden Arch Cafe, the one-of-a-kind restaurant
features such traditional fare as pork cutlets, mashed
potatoes and cole slaw. There's also waitress service, a free
jukebox, movie posters on the walls and a nickel Coke
machine.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>McDonald's intentions for its version of the diner -- a
restaurant format enjoying something of a renaissance --
aren't clear. The company opened the Golden Arch Cafe with
only local fanfare in this town of 2,674 some 50 miles from
downtown Nashville.</p>
<p>While McDonald's has experimented in recent months with
pizza, fried chicken and spaghetti in an effort to bolster
dinnerhour sales, this time the world's biggest fast-food
concern is trying out an entirely new type of restaurant.</p>
<p>Same-store sales at McDonald's restaurants have slumped in
the past year, yet analysts were surprised at the company's
latest move. "While it makes some sense, I would question
whether this {concept} is something you could really build a
business around," said Michael G. Mueller of Montgomery
Securities in San Francisco. Although he said such
restaurants are attractive to an aging population, "you have
to wonder whether nostalgia is a fad or not."</p>
<p>The company chose Hartsville for its prototype, an
official told the local newspaper, because it wanted a town
of 2,500 to 3,000 people with no other traffic generator.</p>
<p>Early reviews from patrons of the Golden Arch are mixed.
They're delighted that the fast-food giant chose Hartsville
for its test -- but some residents say they don't
particularly like the hamburgers it serves.</p>
<p>"The worst comments I've heard are about the hamburgers,"
says Kathy Atwood-Gammons, editor of the local newspaper, the
Hartsville Vidette. "Everybody thought they'd be like
McDonald's, but they're not."</p>
<p>But the cafe's French fries fare better. They're exactly
like the ones available at the nearest McDonald's -- 19 miles
away, says Rosemary Denham, the newspaper's office manager.</p>
<p>The Golden Arch opens at 5:30 a.m. and normally closes
about 9 p.m. but plans to stay open late Friday nights to
accommodate post-football game fans. It also will operate
Sundays, when most other restaurants in town are closed. The
cafe also has drive-thru window service, perhaps to compete
with the local Sonic hamburger-chain outlet.</p>
<p>Reminiscent of the real thing, the McDiner's menu includes
hearty country breakfasts, sandwiches and Salisbury steak
platters with a vegetable-of-the-day at $2.99 for lunch, and,
after 4 p.m., catfish dinners. Local residents say ribeye and
sirloin strip steaks also are planned. Desserts include
banana splits, sundaes and pie a la modes.</p>
<p>Patrons must order at a counter, but are served the food
by waitresses, who bring it on china instead of paper plates.</p>
<p>"This is real exciting to us," says Ms. Atwood-Gammons.
Since a nuclear plant project was scrapped here more than a
decade ago, Hartsville business people have been trying to
recruit new employers. "We've had our economic problems," the
editor says.</p>
<p>Apropos of small-town hospitality, other local merchants
sent bouquets of flowers when the Golden Arch opened Aug. 20.</p>
