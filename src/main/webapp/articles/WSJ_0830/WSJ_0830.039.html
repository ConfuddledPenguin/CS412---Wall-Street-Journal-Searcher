	<p class="article-leader">FAIRFIELD, N.J. -- Ogden Martin Systems Inc. said it
received approval from Lee County officials in Florida to
build and operate a $147 million waste-to-energy facility.
   It will be the fourth such facility in Florida to be built
by the unit of Ogden Projects Inc. The award is significant
because Florida is one of the states where the solid-waste
disposal crisis is acute and where incineration, much opposed
by the public, is trying to get a toehold.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The facility will convert up to 657,000 tons of
residential and commercial solid waste annually into more
than 47 megawatts of electric power. Ogden will sell the
power to Florida Power & Light Corp. The county will receive
90% of the revenue from electric sales, which will be used to
pay down the cost of financing and operating the plant.</p>
<p>The facility will be financed by revenue bonds that the
county, as owner, will issue by year end. Construction of the
plant, which will take 27 months, will begin when all
applicable federal, state and local environmental permits are
issued.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Ogden shares closed at $19, up 12.5 cents.</p>
