	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- In a blistering opinion, the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission threw out a Cotton Exchange fine against a
futures trader for allegedly disruptive behavior.
   The problem?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It seems that the exchange's tiny Financial Instrument
Exchange division ignored testimony that the trader made an
offer -- not a bid -- in a disputed trade in the Finex's
dollar-index pit.</p>
<p>No matter that the fine against the trader, Gary Fusfield,
was a mere $100. Said the CFTC in its harshly worded order:
"The magnitude of the exchange's error is not reduced by the
relatively trivial size of the fine."</p>
<p>Futures exchanges increasingly have policed their pits for
abusive trading behavior following last year's federal probe
of futures trading practices at the two big Chicago
exchanges. But the Finex case is unusual because of the
exchange's apparent blunder -- and because the CFTC tossed
out the fine without remanding it to the exchange for further
review.</p>
<p>"Because exchanges are under the gun to find violations,
it's become a bit of a numbers game," says Thomas Russo, a
New York lawyer who specializes in securities and commodities
law.</p>
<p>The Finex declined to comment.</p>
<p>The case stemmed from a disputed trade made by Mr.
Fusfield in March 1989. James Cahill, Finex floor committee
member, accused Mr. Fusfield of bidding -- or seeking to buy
futures contracts -- below Mr. Cahill's existing bid in the
dollar-index pit, and fined him $100. Such a low-ball bid
would have violated exchange rules.</p>
<p>But in an affidavit filed with the exchange, Mr. Fusfield
insisted he made an offer -- to sell contracts -- at a price
slightly above the bid. Another witness in the pit verified
Mr. Fusfield's version of events.</p>
<p>The Finex, however, ignored that testimony in issuing a
decision affirming the fine, the CFTC said.</p>
<p>In its opinion, the CFTC called Finex's record of the
events "materially misleading," adding that its "reckless
disregard for an orderly and accurate procedure has made
review of its results impossible, and undermined confidence
in that result."</p>
<p>In an unusual twist, the CFTC also refused to remand the
matter back to the Finex because it said the exchange's
disciplinary procedure was faulty.</p>
<p>Mr. Fusfield, who termed the Finex review a "star-chamber
proceeding" in papers filed with the CFTC, said his
floor-brokerage business has folded. He now is a computer
consultant.</p>
