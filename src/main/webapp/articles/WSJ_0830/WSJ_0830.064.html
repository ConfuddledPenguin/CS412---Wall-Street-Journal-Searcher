	<p class="article-leader">LONG ISLAND LIGHTING Co. directors boosted the quarterly
dividend 50%, to 37.5 cents from 25 cents, payable Oct. 1 to
stock of record Sept. 10. The action is in line with the
Hicksville, N.Y., utility's 1989 agreement with New York
state, under which Lilco abandoned its Shoreham nuclear power
plant in return for rate increases and other items. Lilco has
111 million shares outstanding. In New York Stock Exchange
composite trading yesterday, Lilco's shares rose 12.5 cents
to $19.25.</p>
