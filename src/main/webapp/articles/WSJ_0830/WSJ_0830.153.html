VP2000 series supercomputers, including the introduction of
two new models.
   The new systems, the VP2400/40 and VP2200/40, provide
improved high-speed program processing, the Japanese company
said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The systems will be available in September 1991, with a
monthly rental fee of about 79 million yen ($550,156) for the
VP2200/40 and of about 103 million yen for the VP2400/40.</p>
<p>The other enhancements are intended to respond to
increased user demands for large-scale program processing
involving simulations, Fujitsu said.</p>
<p>In a separate announcement, Fujitsu disclosed the release
of the UXP/M operating system for the VP2000 series
supercomputers and M series of mainframes, the first
mainframe computer adaptation of Unix System V Release 4. The
SVR4 is the latest standard for the Unix operating system.</p>
<p>Fujitsu said it plans to adopt the Unix SVR4 standard for
all its Unix products.</p>
