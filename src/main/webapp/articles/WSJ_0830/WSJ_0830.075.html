	<p class="article-leader">To Stephen Leeb, it's deja vu. He says he finds today's
stock market such a striking parallel to the market at the
outset of the Korean war that he forces himself to restrain
his enthusiasm so he doesn't "sound like some kind of a nut."
   It's all there, says Mr. Leeb, editor of Personal Finance,
an investment advisory publication. The economic picture in
1950 was much the same: Low growth, little inflation and
relatively low interest rates. The immediate effect of the
Korean crisis was a surge in prices of basic commodities;
this time, it's oil. The market plunged 15% in five weeks
then -- just as it plunged 14% in three weeks this time.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>And here's the part Mr. Leeb likes best: After the initial
shock, the market took off on one of the greatest rallies in
postwar history. Six months later it had climbed 25% from its
low.</p>
<p>With today's stock markets under seige for three weeks --
and now sending mixed signals -- some analysts are looking to
history to figure out where stocks will end up. And many of
them say recent activity has the earmarks of classic "crisis
markets," which have historically provided profit
opportunities for the shrewd -- and courageous -- investor.</p>
<p>Consider the 24% decline in the market following President
Kennedy's face-off with U.S. Steel Corp. in early 1962. The
market was convinced that a liberal, anti-business president
was about to send the economy reeling into a recession,
recalls Robert Stovall, head of Stovall/Twenty First
Advisers.</p>
<p>During the worst days of spring 1962, Polaroid shares
plummeted from $236 to $81 and International Business
Machines' share price was slashed in half to $300. But the
recession of 1962 never happened. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average shot up 22% in the following six months and was 32%
ahead a year later. Mr. Stovall, comforted by history,
doesn't think the feared recession of 1990 will materialize,
either.</p>
<p>Says William Lefevre, chief market strategist for Advest &
Co., who agrees that most panic sell-offs don't evolve into
bear markets: "Investor fears are like nightmares: They
rarely come true."</p>
<p>There's certainly no question that investors have reacted
wildly to any news during the current crisis in the Middle
East. The industrial average stood at 2899.26 on Aug. 1.
Then, with investors jolted by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and
the possibility of a Persian Gulf war, the average plunged
416 points.</p>
<p>But last Friday it suddenly leaped 49.50 points, following
up Monday with a 78.71 gain to 2611.63, the biggest one-day
rise since last Oct. 16. Since then, with the crisis creating
no big news, the market has drifted, closing yesterday at
2632.43, up 17.58.</p>
<p>To Mr. Leeb, this is an opportunity.</p>
<p>"Of the eight crises that have spooked the market since
World War II," he says, "in all but one of them the market
was up significantly six months and 12 months later."</p>
<p>All of these panic sell-offs -- after events such as the
Soviet launching of Sputnik and President Nixon's resignation
-- resulted in a quick decline of at least 10%.</p>
<p>The exception to Mr. Leeb's rule, under the circumstances,
is an unfortunate one: the crisis touched off by the 1973-74
oil embargo. Like that sell-off, the Iraq drop may have been
rooted in genuine concern about the direct impact of the
incident on the availability of oil.</p>
<p>In broad terms, there's an eerie parallel between then and
now: a sickly economy suddenly battered by the shock of
surging oil prices. The result then was a deep recession that
eventually swept away about 45% of the stock market's value.
If the parallel holds true to that frightful pattern, that
would mean an eventual decline of the industrial average to
1650 from its summer peak.</p>
<p>The stock market just before Iraq's invasion also looked
very much as it did in the days just before the October 1973
Arab oil embargo, imposed in the wake of the Arab-Israeli
war. Kenneth Spence, director of the technical analysis group
at Salomon Brothers, notes that the market just prior to the
embargo was characterized by big price gains in blue-chip
stocks that put that select group far ahead of the broader
market.</p>
<p>The situation was remarkably like the blue-chip buying
binge that pushed the industrial average to its all-time high
of 2999.75 in July while less-favored stocks, such as those
in the over-the-counter market, lagged far behind.</p>
<p>The assumption in 1973, as well as last month, was that
large growth stocks, the biggest and best-managed companies
in the nation, were essentially immune to the ups and downs
of an economic cycle. But when the crunch came in 1973, the
blue-chips were brought abruptly to heel, just as they have
been in 1990.</p>
<p>"What is disturbing is that the broad market is leading
the way down and the blue chips are following," Mr. Spence
says. "What you want to see in a market bottom is the broad
market acting better than the blue chips."</p>
<p>Most analysts find more differences than similarities
between now and 1973. For instance, the oil supply situation
today is far less grave, prices haven't risen nearly as much
on a percentage basis, Americans have become more sanguine
about higher oil prices and inflation isn't the problem now
it was then.</p>
<p>Another major difference, says David Wyss, director of
research at Data Resources, is that the dollar has fallen
sharply in recent weeks; investment capital seeking a safe
haven has flowed to Europe, where interest rates are higher.
In 1973 the dollar rose, hurting U.S. exports and adding more
recessionary pressure to an economy with tight credit that
was already closing in on a recession. This time around, with
a declining dollar, exports should be stimulated, Mr. Wyss
believes.</p>
<p>Americans are less exposed, too. In the 1970s, the average
American had 40% of financial assets in stocks; that's now
just 20%.</p>
<p>But while optimistic investors find plenty of reasons to
dismiss parallels between now and 1973, they are quick to
cite similarities with other crisis-related selloffs that had
happier endings.</p>
<p>There's the 14% drop in four weeks in May 1970, during a
liquidity crisis symbolized by the failure of Penn Central
Co. Over the following year, investors pushed stocks up 44%.</p>
<p>Even the financial panic of October 1987 didn't touch off
a long-lasting market debacle. Despite the 22.6% plunge on
Oct. 19, the market recovered. It was up 15% six months later
and toted up a 23% gain off the low point within a year.</p>
<p>To Robert Ritter, chief market strategist of Ladenburg,
Thalmann & Co., "This has all the earmarks of 1962."</p>
<p>The plunge in the spring of 1962 was touched off by a
now-famous quote of President Kennedy about businessmen.
Referring to the double cross he believed had occurred after
U.S. Steel raised prices despite his help in securing a labor
settlement, the president reportedly told an aide: "My father
always told me that all businessmen were sons of bitches, but
I never believed it till now." The president evidently added
fuel to the fire when he further criticized the business
establishment at a commencement speech at Yale University in
June.</p>
<p>Mr. Ritter says that then, as now, there was a deceptively
strong stock market, with relatively high price-earnings
multiples for the market's most heavily owned stocks, and a
generally weak economic environment. Just as in July of this
year, he says, there was a "weak top" because the broader
market averages had been performing poorly for the prior
year.</p>
<p>Despite all that, Mr. Ritter is not yet convinced the
downturn this time will end as happily as it did then because
there are so many other issues this time, from the savings
and loan crisis to the budget deficit.</p>
<p>And he mentions another historical point: October is
around the corner, and it has often been a bad time for the
market.</p>
<p>Wall Street veteran Philip Carret, chairman of Carret &
Co., a money management firm, sees a reason for optimism if
war breaks out, based on the Korean war example and other
history: He says armed conflict has often been good for the
market. "Usually after the first shock, the market tends to
get bullish," he says.</p>
<p>Many disagree with that. Mr. Leeb says investors became
bullish during the Korean conflict, as he expects they will
now, because the slow economic activity going into the war
had already set the stage for the Federal Reserve Board to
stimulate growth by keeping interest rates down. Mr. Leeb
expects that the Fed is poised now to lower interest rates
despite the extra nudge that a rise in oil prices could give
to inflation.</p>
<p>In other words, Mr. Leeb says -- and many analysts agree
-- it was not the Korean war itself that sent the market on a
tear after the initial fears subsided. These analysts say
that wars are not necessarily good for the economy or the
stock markets.</p>
<p>On the plus side, wars tend to lead to full employment and
increased industrial production. But besides inflationary
impact, wars can eventually help stall an economy because so
much of the stimulated production is actually non-productive.
The engines that are built, for instance, are not used to
produce more goods.</p>
<p>The market's record during World War II was spotty -- a
two-year bear market followed by a bull market. Similarly,
while the early years of the Vietnam war coincided with a
powerful bull market, there were down periods in the second
half of the 1960s.</p>
<p>All of which means absolutely nothing for today anyway,
according to some market watchers who say history, in the
present case, is bunk. "I don't compare this with anything,"
says Dudley Eppel, head of trading at Donaldson, Lufkin &
Jenrette. Except for the October 1987 crash, "those other
things were child's play. There's much more volatility" in
the market now -- so much so, he says, that if it weren't for
"circuit breakers" that impede heavy computer-driven program
trading when prices fluctuate sharply, "we might have had
another 1987 now."</p>
<p>Some money managers also resist drawing on their memories
of past markets to make investment decisions. "Those who
worship at the altar of historic parallels get boxed in,"
says John Neff, manager of the $6.7 billion Windsor mutual
fund, who has been in the business 35 years.</p>
<p>Unlike most investment managers, Mr. Neff has been buying
stocks aggressively throughout the August downturn, reducing
his fund's cash position to 13% of assets from 19% before the
Aug. 2 invasion.</p>
<p>About $80 million of Mr. Neff's $390 million of new
investments went into the market last Thursday, a day the Dow
industrials plunged 76.73 points. Among the stocks he found
attractive after their recent drubbing were some whose
fortunes are tied to the economic cycle: chemicals, aluminum,
paper and airlines.</p>
<p>But even though Mr. Neff says history isn't important, he
recalls his own reaction to the sell-off of 1973-74. He
waited for a while, then bought heavily into what he calls
"lesser recognized growth stocks" that were down as much as
70%, including Pizza Hut, Tandy, Browning-Ferris and Hospital
Corp. of America.</p>
<p>The result: His Windsor Fund outperformed the market for
three years.</p>
