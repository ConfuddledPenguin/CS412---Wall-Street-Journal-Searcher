	<p class="article-leader">Michael Gartner's spirited defense of what he alleges to
be First Amendment rights of the press and his attack on the
arguments of the Supreme Court (op-ed page, July 19) suggest
why the media generate suspicion and hostility in some
quarters.
   Tattered though it might be by some judicial decisions the
cloak of the First Amendment should be the critical shield of
a democracy's free press protecting it from chilling winds of
self-appointed censors but not used to allow anyone to expose
freely unsupported critical allegations just by flashing a
press pass.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Claims of untouchable authority in voicing opinion by the
columnist/editorialist/journalist/author, who may or may not
have any hard evidence, leave the subject of an attack
defenseless and, even worse, encourage the growth of sloppy
and lazy reporting.</p>
<p>In exercising proper sensitivity to the very real threat
to their role the media should not lose sight of their
responsibility and the real fears of the citizenry. In a
paraphrase of a remark about war, perhaps the freedom of the
press is too important to leave to network-news executives.</p>

<p>---</p>
<p>The press has been able to affect careers and, for that
matter, national policy with absolutely no regard for the
consequences. The Spanish-American War, the internment of
Japanese-American citizens and the McCarthy era are good
examples of this.</p>
<p>If an opinion carries the same weight as a fact, then the
consequences must be recognized. The court's decision to make
people responsible for what they say in no way weakens the
First Amendment.</p>
