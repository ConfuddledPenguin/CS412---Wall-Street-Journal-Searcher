	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- E-Systems Inc. said it agreed to acquire Hadson
Corp.'s HRB Systems Inc. for $65 million, half what Hadson
paid for it only two years ago.
   Like many defense contractors, HRB's sales have declined
in recent years because of "the breakout of peace," said
Hadson President J. Michael Adcock, explaining why the unit's
value dropped 50%. In 1989, the unit had sales of about $113
million, down from about $140 million only two years earlier,
Mr. Adcock said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>He stressed, however, that "HRB remains a good solid
company," and that its sale is part of a larger Hadson
strategy to reduce debt and concentrate on producing and
supplying energy products and facilities, the primary
business of Oklahoma City-based Hadson.</p>
<p>HRB will give E-Systems, a maker of defense electronics
systems, "access to new customers, emerging programs, and
synergistic opportunities which we expect will result in a
positive future contribution to our earnings," said E.G.
Keiffer, chairman and chief executive of E-Systems. He added
that HRB "will further complement and expand our position in
the advanced intelligence and reconnaissance systems
marketplace, an area which we believe has and will become
increasingly important." HRB, based in State College, Pa.,
employs about 1,300.</p>
<p>Mr. Adcock said Hadson established reserves in the second
quarter large enough to cover the loss on the sale of HRB. Of
the $147 million, or $3.71-a-share, loss that Hadson reported
for the second quarter, about $144 million came from
discontinued operations. In the year-earlier quarter, the
company had a loss of $2.7 million, or seven cents a share,
after taking a $2.8 million loss on discontinued operations.
Revenue in the quarter fell to $106.5 million from $130.2
million.</p>
<p>E-Systems reported six-month earnings of $35.9 million, or
$1.15 a share, compared with $38.5 million, or $1.24 a share,
a year earlier. Sales rose to $896 million from $791 million.</p>
