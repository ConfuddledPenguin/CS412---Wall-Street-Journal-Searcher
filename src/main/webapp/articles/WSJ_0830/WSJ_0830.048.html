	<p class="article-leader">The Philippines, hard hit by an earthquake in July and the
current Mideast crisis, is seeking more-flexible arrangements
for repaying its $26.1 billion foreign debt.
   "There is now a greater need for debt relief," said Jose
Cuisia Jr., governor of the Central Bank of the Philippines.
"There should be greater flexibility."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Cuisia said in an interview, however, that the
administration of President Corazon Aquino will resist calls
for a moratorium on foreign-debt payments. The Philippine
Congress has passed nonbinding resolutions asking the
president to negotiate a 30-month moratorium, but Mrs. Aquino
says she will veto any bill requiring a payment halt, which
could ruin the country's international credit rating and
hinder foreign trade and investment.</p>
<p>A series of debt-rescheduling agreements has extended
repayment periods, but the country's debt burden remains
heavy. This year, for instance, payments will eat up 40% of
the national budget. One-third of those payments go to
foreign creditors.</p>
<p>As an example of the flexibility he is seeking from
creditors, Mr. Cuisia said the Philippines wants to conduct
another buy-back of commercial-bank debt this year, similar
to the $1.31 billion buy-back completed in January. To do so,
the government will need permission of the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank to use funds lent by those
institutions.</p>
<p>Under a 1989 debt-restructuring agreement, commercial-bank
creditors have been given a choice of offering debt to the
government for repurchase or of subscribing to new 15-year
Philippine bonds. Earlier this year, the Philippines sold
more than $700 million of bonds to creditor banks, an amount
lower than the government had expected.</p>
<p>Mr. Cuisia said another buy-back would be the "most
cost-effective" way for the country to reduce its debt
burden. Many foreign commercial banks also favor such action
as a way to remove Philippine debt from their books, even at
a discount. In the January buy-back, the government
repurchased bank debt at 52 cents for every $1 of existing
debt with funds from the IMF, World Bank and Japan's
Export-Import Bank.</p>
<p>Mr. Cuisia said the amount of commercial-bank debt
tendered in the January buy-back exceeded the $1.31 billion
actually retired, and he suggested there is at least $500
million and probably $800 million to $1 billion more of debt
that could be retired through another buy-back at a similar
discount.</p>
<p>New York-based Manufacturers Hanover Corp., the lead bank
of the Philippines' 12-bank creditor group, declined to
comment on Manila's desire for a second buy-back. But a
senior U.S. bank official said creditor banks would be likely
to participate in a second such arrangement.</p>
<p>Whatever action is taken to reduce the country's total
debt and its payments burden, there is concern both in the
Philippines and among foreign bankers that the country may
need additional assistance. One reason is the earthquake that
struck northern Luzon on July 16, killing more than 1,600
people and causing some $800 million in damages.</p>
<p>Another is the Mideast crisis, which is likely to take a
severe toll on the Philippines' balance-of-payments position,
especially if oil prices remain near $30 a barrel. The
country imports 65% of its energy needs, mostly in oil and
oil products. In addition, remittances from Philippine
workers in the Mideast are sure to decline.</p>
<p>Before the earthquake and Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait, the government estimated an overall
balance-of-payments deficit of $300 million for 1991. "It
almost certainly will be much higher than that," Mr. Cuisia
said, without providing a new estimate. In the first five
months of the year, the balance-of-payments deficit was $58
million.</p>
<p>The Philippines will need new loans to help cover the
widening payments gap. Mr. Cuisia said the issue of new
lending was deferred during recent meetings with creditors
and will be taken up later this year.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the National Economic Development Agency
has reduced its outlook for growth in gross national product
to 3.8% from 6.5% forecast at the beginning of the year.</p>
