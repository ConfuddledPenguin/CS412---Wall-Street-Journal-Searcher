	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission
charged three people with insider trading in connection with
a 1988 bid by MAI Basic Four Inc. to acquire Prime Computer
Inc.
   In a complaint filed in federal court in Los Angeles, the
SEC charged that Dale Jabour, Ronald Lee Thurman and Winston
Cheong bought Prime Computer call options after learning that
MAI was considering an attempt to acquire Prime. All three
were employees at MAI at the time of the discussions, the SEC
said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The suit charged that Mr. Jabour, who was director of
accounting at MAI in 1988, overheard an MAI executive officer
tell another executive that the company was engaged in
discussions concerning Prime Computer. Mr. Jabour later
learned that any "significant corporate event" with respect
to MAI and Prime Computer would take place after the Nov. 8,
1988, presidential election, the SEC said.</p>
<p>The complaint alleged that Mr. Jabour passed on the
information to Messrs. Thurman and Cheong. All three
subsequently bought call options in Prime Computer in
violation of their duty to MAI, the SEC said.</p>
<p>Without admitting or denying the charges, the three men
agreed to final judgments under which they would be enjoined
from further violations of securities laws and Mr. Thurman
would be required to disgorge $1,875 and Mr. Cheong to
disgorge $3,830 in alleged profits from their trades. Mr.
Jabour previously returned profit of $21,800 to the sellers
of the options.</p>
<p>The judgments, which are pending before the court, also
call for the three to pay to the Treasury civil fines equal
to their alleged profits.</p>
<p>Messrs. Jabour, Thurman and Cheong couldn't immediately be
reached for comment.</p>
<p>In August 1989, Prime Computer was acquired by J.H.
Whitney & Co.</p>
