	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Another monthly decline in new construction
contracts points to still lower levels of building in the
months ahead, according to F.W. Dodge, the forecasting unit
of McGraw-Hill Inc.
   Dodge said setbacks in all segments in July resulted in an
annualized construction startup rate of $232.31 billion, down
from $244.85 billion in June. The seasonally adjusted rate
brought the Dodge index down to 148 from 156 the previous
month. The index compares current contracting with a 1982
base of 100.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Restrictive credit, budget austerity, and a stagnant
economy are more than enough reasons for the sorry state of
construction in 1990," said George A. Christie, vice
president and chief economist for Dodge. Energy inflation is
an added impediment to improvement in the near future.</p>
<p>The weakest segment, nonresidential building, dropped 8%
to $80.5 billion, as a result of lagging office construction,
which fell 23% to the lowest rate in a decade. Nonbuilding
construction, including public works and utilities, was down
7% to $42.4 billion, and homebuilding was down 2% to $109.4
billion.</p>
<p>Through seven months of 1990, $143 billion of new
construction was started, 8% less than the comparable 1989
period. The most severe regional declines continued to be in
the Northeast, down 24%, and the Southeast, down 15% through
July.</p>
