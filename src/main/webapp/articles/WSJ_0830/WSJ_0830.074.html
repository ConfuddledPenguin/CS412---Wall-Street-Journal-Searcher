magazine's September issue:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Since the days of President Eliot {of Harvard}, educators
have been talking about the needs of students. We are always
being told, in the case of dress codes, co-ed dormitories,
and campus cultural events, that students are mature men and
women who know what they want. Fine, then, let them have it.
Abolish all university-wide restrictions and do away with
tenure. Turn each faculty member into an independent
contractor, something like a paperboy, who is not paid a
fixed salary but a commission for every paper he sells on his
route. Teachers who are popular for whatever reason -- for
their sex appeal, their low standards, or even for their
merits as scholars and teachers -- would be paid commensurate
with the number of students they attracted. Others would
starve.</p>
