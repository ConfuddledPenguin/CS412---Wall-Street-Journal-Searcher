	<p class="article-leader">Barry's Jewelers Inc., Monrovia, Calif., said its
fiscal-fourth-quarter loss widened to $12.1 million, or $2.42
a share, because of increased provisions for bad debts.
   In the year-earlier quarter, Barry's had a loss of
$754,000, or 15 cents a share. Sales for the latest period,
ended May 31, dipped to $31.6 million from $31.9 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Trading of Barry's stock in the national over-the-counter
market was halted briefly yesterday pending the earnings
announcement. The stock closed at $4.25, down $1.50.</p>
<p>Barry's, which operates 224 stores nationwide, said it
hadn't expected the increase in bad-debt provisions to be as
large as it was. The rise reflects "continuing deterioration
in the general retail environment," Barry's said, and its own
"increasingly adverse bad-debt experience," mainly in the
Southwest. Barry's also cited the effect of adjusting the
value of its accounts receivable for financing purposes.</p>
<p>For fiscal 1990, Barry's posted a $15.5 million loss, or
$3.10 a share, compared with net income of $6 million, or
$1.21 a share. Sales rose 5.6%, to $165.7 million from $157
million.</p>
