	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Like the tangle of highways in this
eclectic city, the market for magazines for and about Los
Angeles is headed for one big traffic jam.
   Major media companies staked out their piece of turf years
ago with such mainstays as Los Angeles, owned by Capital
Cities/ABC Inc., and American Express Publishing Co.'s L.A.
Style. But now a plucky group of independent magazines --
some new, some revamped -- have set sights on the city, with
an editorial focus as narrow as a single neighborhood or as
broad as the California state of mind.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>BUZZ, a monthly magazine aiming to be hip, literary and
upscale all at once, will make its debut in early October.
The Brentwood Bla-Bla, one of two quirky monthlies that
publish solely what readers send in, is stepping up its
distribution in the area since being acquired last month by
Page Group Publishing Inc. Exposure, a funky pop-culture
monthly bought recently by Capital Cities/ABC, will soon get
a cleaner look and national distribution.</p>
<p>But Los Angeles already may have reached a saturation
point in local magazines. The new flurry of publications will
test the limits of the local advertising market and could
overwhelm readers. Through July of this year, a half-dozen
California city magazines, ranging from Palm Springs Life to
San Francisco Focus to the granddaddy, Los Angeles, have been
hit with ad-page losses, according to Media Industry
Newsletter.</p>
<p>Publishers worry that planned cuts in defense spending
could push the region into a recession and make things even
tougher for the magazines. Los Angeles's sprawling, divergent
urban mass has prevented existing magazines from building
massive circulation, yet starting a new city magazine here
can cost $5 million to $10 million, as much as it takes to
launch a small national magazine. Another hurdle: Tony
national magazines lured by the city's image are moving in on
the locals' domain.</p>
<p>Industry executives say Los Angeles publishers need only
look east to see the pitfalls of a crowded market. In the New
York area, a local recession and bad times in retailing have
depressed ad spending, resulting in the shutdown of a few
magazines -- Seven Days and Manhattan inc. among them -- and
falling ad pages at many. American Express's New York Woman,
though critically praised, is down 23% in ad pages through
June, and even News Corp.'s perennially healthy New York
magazine is down 14%.</p>
<p>"The lesson of New York is very clear," says Thomas Ryder,
president of American Express Publishing Corp., which bought
L.A. Style in 1988. "If you have too many magazines in one
city, you will see a bloodbath and people will lose
millions."</p>
<p>Moreover, in virtually every part of the country, city and
regional magazines are being hit hard by declining retail
advertising. But publishers such as BUZZ President Eden
Collinsworth say Los Angeles is "underserved" by magazines
and that the publications can share the wealth by appealing
to distinctly different audiences.</p>
<p>The market could quickly become overserved, however,
because virtually every existing magazine and most of the new
and revamped independents have the same target: the West
Side, comprising the largely affluent, yuppified communities
of Malibu, Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, Brentwood and Bel
Air.</p>
<p>"BUZZ wants to attract a highly creative, artistic
audience -- but so do many publications," says W. Pendleton
Tudor, chairman of the executive committee of A/S/M
Communications, Inc., which publishes Adweek.</p>
<p>Despite the lessons of New York, magazine executives say
Los Angeles is a city headed in another direction, and they
want to catch the momentum. "The center of gravity is
shifting in the country," says BUZZ's Ms. Collinsworth. "Los
Angeles has become a terrifically confident metropolitan
center, and there's room for a new magazine that reflects the
new reality."</p>
<p>No longer the second or third city to New York, Los
Angeles can now boast of being the country's top retail sales
market and the fastest-growing major city. The Getty Museum
and industrialist Armand Hammer are both building museums
here. Earlier this year, the Los Angeles Times, flagship
paper of Times Mirror Co., passed the New York Daily News as
the country's largest metropolitan daily. And the
much-thumbed-through Zagat Restaurant Survey has declared
that Los Angeles has bypassed New York in serving the world's
most imaginative restaurant food.</p>
<p>Though no one magazine has dominated, Los Angeles is the
most established, with paid circulation of more than 170,000.
Started in 1960, it took 13 years to become profitable. With
readers heavily concentrated on the affluent West Side and
scattered through assorted valleys, it continues to struggle
with the urban sprawl that is modern-day Los Angeles.</p>
<p>"Communities have developed their own urban identities;
they don't look to downtown L.A. as the center," says Geoff
Miller, publisher of Los Angeles. "That makes it hard to find
the shared values that create a loyal readership."</p>
<p>Los Angeles takes the broadest, middle-of-the-road
approach. It used the innocuous TV star Bob Newhart on the
cover of its recent dining guide issue. (Exposure, by
contrast, preferred for a recent cover a jarring photo of a
rock singer from the band Jane's Addiction; he wore a ring
through both nostrils and had been spray-painted platinum.)</p>
<p>Los Angeles offers a foolproof mix of upbeat service
articles on restaurants and real estate, and some, but not
much, serious journalism. It is the biggest monthly city
magazine in the country, but circulation is flat and hasn't
grown much since tripling in the 1970s to 150,000.</p>
<p>The magazine's mainstream approach has left room for
others. BUZZ, whose tag line is "The Talk of Los Angeles,"
hopes to draw a more affluent, in-the-know readership with a
more literary publication.</p>
<p>Stationed in a classic '50s-modern house designed by Los
Angeles architect Richard Neutra high atop Mulholland Drive,
Ms. Collinsworth and a small staff have assembled a troop of
"name" writers whose Hollywood connections make them
celebrities in their own right. Columnists include
screenwriter Harlan Ellison and Holly Palance (daughter of
actor Jack Palance). BUZZ has already drawn ad commitments
from national advertisers such as Absolut, Guess? jeans, and
Estee Lauder.</p>
<p>For something farther out on the edge, there is Exposure,
a three-year-old monthly acquired in January by the Fairchild
Publications unit of Capital Cities/ABC. It started as a
streetwise nightclub magazine for the hip Melrose area and
became ever slicker, monitoring popular culture and focusing
on fashion while also running stories on racism, censorship
and other social issues. As part of its push for Exposure,
Fairchild will sell ad space in the magazine in a package
with the company's fashion publications.</p>
<p>Other magazines are targeting other geographic or
special-interest niches. L.A. Style, largely a fashion
magazine, will clear a profit this year for the first time in
its five-year run. Angeles magazine, focusing on interior
design, is distributed free to affluent neighborhoods. L.A.
West focuses on travel, local environmental issues, and home
and garden, and is distributed free to homes on the West
Side.</p>
<p>The most offbeat magazines are two written by readers: the
Brentwood Bla-Bla and Beverly Hills, the Magazine. Both were
acquired in July by Page Group Publishing. Readers send in
poems, reminiscences, restaurant reviews, wedding
photographs. But the contributors are getting more famous.
Photographer Scavullo recently contributed shots of famous
celebrities to Beverly Hills.</p>
<p>Despite the local crowd, several New York-based magazines,
most notably Vanity Fair, have targeted Los Angeles as
fertile ground to build circulation. G. Douglas Johnston,
publisher of the Conde Nast Publications Inc. property, says
Los Angeles provides 13% of Vanity Fair's national
circulation of 750,000, not far behind the 16% sold in New
York.</p>
<p>But others are pulling back. Bud Knapp, chairman of Los
Angeles-based Knapp Communications Corp., recently killed
plans for a weekly regional magazine in Los Angeles. Mr.
Knapp, publisher of Architectural Digest and Bon Appetit,
says the publication was dropped because of the high costs of
start-up and "the state of our economy, now and projecting
forward." He adds: "Like everything in life, starting a new
magazine is a matter of good timing."</p>
