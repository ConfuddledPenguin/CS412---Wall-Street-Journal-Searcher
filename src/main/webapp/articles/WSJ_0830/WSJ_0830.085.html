	<p class="article-leader">The Mideast isn't the only place where a voracious force
spent the past few years advancing in the face of
half-hearted containment measures. Here at home, the same
script applies to budget items such as the federal
student-loan program. In fact, we've reached the point where
hostilities can't be avoided. Let war come.
   This is a cost-of-good-intentions story, an example of how
our political system decides to "help" some group without
much caring that these grandiose public commitments breed
waste, fraud and abuse.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Student loans ballooned during the Carter years, then
continued to grow in the 1980s because the Reagan
administration preferred them to grants. They attracted some
marginal students and any number of marginal operators of
instructional facilities who preyed on the conscientious and
careless alike, sometimes by offering empty programs or by
simply going out of business after tuition was paid. (Many of
the bad apples are proprietary trade schools.) Loan defaults
continue to rise rapidly in dollar terms (more than $2
billion this fiscal year) and soon should account for about
half the cost of the program.</p>
<p>Beginning with the publication in 1985 of a list of
schools with the highest default rates, the Education
Department has been trying to get a grip on this problem.
Secretary Lauro Cavazos weighed in more than a year ago with
what amounted to a series of circuit breakers to prevent
institutions prone to abusing the program from getting away
with as much. The measures have taken time to be phased in,
and even though several hundred actions have been filed we
don't yet know whether the regulations have teeth. Overall
default rates actually had begun to stablize even before
those reins were put on, but the money being lost per bad
loan keeps increasing.</p>
<p>Judges have balked at letting Education summarily shut off
a school's loan pipeline. To deal with one court ruling,
Secretary Cavazos earlier this month requested "emergency"
powers to withdraw funds where evidence exists that schools
are soliciting students under false pretenses. The emergency
must await a 45-day comment period.</p>
<p>The administration also is now attempting to attack the
student end of the problem, with legislation that would limit
eligibility to borrowers who are by some stretch of the
imagination credit-worthy. Top Democrats in Congress, for
whom student loans rank as entitlements, will have none of
that.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the budding insolvency of one of the
intermediaries in the government's loan-guarantee process,
the Higher Education Assistance Foundation, has forced new
attention on the issue. Opinions vary on whether HEAF brought
on its predicament by aggressively amassing a risky loan
portfolio or just was unlucky in its draw, but its loans
apparently will be placed with another such insurer. These
guarantors are pivotal to the program -- in fact, the
Education Department relies on them for information about
loan-volume surges that might warn of trouble at the schools.
The federal government is, of course, the backup guarantor.</p>
<p>The student-loan fiasco is merely a part of the huge
fiscal mess spawned by government credit guarantees. (In the
S&L case, loans were backed by insuring the deposits that
funded them.) Two lessons should be drawn.</p>
<p>First, and in the short run, insured loans should be sold
in the securities markets and whatever loss is realized on
them, because of credit or interestrate risk, should be
accounted for now and not be allowed to swell in the dark.</p>
<p>Second, because no system of controls is going to be fully
effective in checking the greed of those who see profit in
government largess, Washington should quit thinking it can
manage these huge programs. It just can't. Where it is
determined politically that aid should be given to recipients
such as struggling students, they should be handed vouchers
by which they can purchase credit enhancements or interest
write-downs, which can be priced like any other financial
good or service.</p>
<p>The budget battle of 1990, taking place in the context of
a weak and anxious economy, is a time for truth. Congressmen
who live the lie of unlimited resources should be called to
account. And the next time the public is being sold a new
federal program, such as student loans or subsidized health
care, it should look further down the road at the odds of an
expensive crackup.</p>
