	<p class="article-leader">James M. Weichert claims (letters, Aug. 17) that a house
that rose in value from $107,000 to $895,000 over 14 years
had an average annual appreciation of 52.6%. Average annual
return refers to an annual compounded rate; an investment of
$107,000 would grow to $39,732,624 in 14 years at an average
annual rate of 52.6%. The correct rate of return is 16.4% --
comparable with an investment in a Standard & Poor's 500
index fund over the same period.
