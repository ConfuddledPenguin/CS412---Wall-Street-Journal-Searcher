	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- University of Chicago researchers said they
developed a solar device that can concentrate sunlight to an
intensity 15% greater than on the surface of the sun itself.
   Roland Winston, head of the Department of Physics and a
researcher, said scientists have been trying to heighten the
intensity of collected sunlight because a highly concentrated
beam of light could someday power laser communication in
space or incinerate hazardous wastes, among other uses.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The group's feat, which amounted to concentrating sunlight
to 84,000 times its normal intensity on Earth, surpasses the
previous record achieved by the researchers in 1988 by 40%,
he said.</p>
<p>He said the group achieved the feat by first using a
conventional telescope mirror to focus the light to a
square-centimeter area. A precisely machined cone of sapphire
then concentrated that focused light into a square-millimeter
area. Key to the advance in intensity was a sapphire that was
"mathematically designed" to give the maximum possible
refractive index, or ability to bend light.</p>
<p>In the latest experiments, the researchers measured the
energy output of the solar collector by heating fluid. The
solar collector generated 72 watts a square millimeter,
compared with 63 watts generated at the surface of the sun.
Normal sunlight that reaches Earth amounts to less than
one-thousandth of a watt a square millimeter.</p>
