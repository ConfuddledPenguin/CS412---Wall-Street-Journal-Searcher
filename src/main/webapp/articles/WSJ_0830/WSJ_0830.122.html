	<p class="article-leader">LIESHOUT, the Netherlands -- The Bavaria brewery said
Saudi Arabia has asked it to double its exports of
non-alcoholic beer to the Middle East nation to help slake
the thirst of U.S. soldiers there.
   But the company already finds it hard to satisfy both
normal demand from Islamic clients and from a home market
where alcohol-free brews enjoy a growing reputation.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The demand is much too large for us at the moment," said
Rien Coolen, a spokesman for the Bavaria brewery, which has
been exporting alcohol-free beer to Saudi Arabia for 15
years.</p>
<p>A strict Islamic nation, Saudi Arabia prohibits the sale
of alcohol. To help meet the Saudi request, the brewery is
increasing output and will ask employees to work overtime,
Mr. Coolen added.</p>
<p>Mr. Coolen declined to disclose the size of the Saudi
request or give details of his brewery's exports, citing
competitive reasons.</p>
