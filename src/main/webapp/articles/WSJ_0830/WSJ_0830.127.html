	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- Ray Howell, a key witness in a federal
investigation of political contributions by a Southern Co.
unit, was sentenced to two years' probation on contempt and
tax charges.
   Mr. Howell, who did graphics work for Southern's
Pensacola, Fla., Gulf Power Co. unit, disappeared prior to
his scheduled appearance before a federal grand jury in
Atlanta and hid for a year before surrendering last December.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As part of his guilty plea in April, Mr. Howell agreed to
cooperate in a continuing investigation into illegal
political contributions. The U.S. attorney's office recently
filed papers under seal that gave details of Mr. Howell's
cooperation.</p>
<p>Individuals familiar with the investigation say Mr. Howell
can shed light on the roles of individuals who were involved
in the alleged political contributions scheme.</p>
<p>Last October, Gulf Power pleaded guilty to two felony
charges of conspiracy to make illegal political contributions
and tax evasion and paid a $500,000 fine, ending the case
against it. However, an investigation of the individuals
involved continues.</p>
<p>Papers filed in federal court in Atlanta in the Gulf Power
case alleged that Gulf Power used Mr. Howell's Design
Associates Inc. to funnel money to the 1988 campaign of
Florida State Sen. W.D. Childers. Federal law bars utility
holding companies from making political contributions.</p>
