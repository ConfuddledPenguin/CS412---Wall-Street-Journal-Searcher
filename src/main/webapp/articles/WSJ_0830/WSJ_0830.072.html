	<p class="article-leader">AMMAN, Jordan -- Ahmed Kamil is a deal-making man from
Sudan. He wants to sell you his two-tone Mercedes Benz for a
rock bottom $2,000. "One thousand now, the rest in two
hours," he says, wiping the car down with a fold of his
flowing white robe. Across town, a Pakistani named Mohammed
will sell you a "like new" Chevy Caprice for only $1,200.
Nearby, Youssef, a Yemeni, offers a test drive in his 1988
Ram Charger, and "the very best price in Amman."
   Since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait three weeks ago, Jordan's
capital has become a sprawling, used-car bazaar. The refugees
flooding in from Kuwait bring cars with them. Nice cars, the
kind that once cruised Kuwait city: luxurious and thirsty for
Persian Gulf gas.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But gas isn't cheap anymore, and most of the refugees
desperately need cash. Stranded in Jordan, waiting for boats
or planes to carry them to their native lands, many are
off-loading the one real asset they still have.</p>
<p>Most cars come with extras such as air conditioning. Some
even sport the new license plates issued by Baghdad,
designating Kuwait as a province of Iraq. But registration
papers aren't always part of the deal. In the chaos following
the Iraqi raid, many foreign workers made off with cars
belonging to Kuwaitis on vacation in Europe, or in flight to
Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>As showrooms, the refugees are using the parking lots of
mosques, embassies and union halls where most are camped out
until they find a way home. This makes for unlikely
juxtapositions. In the yard of one mosque, women string
laundry between trees and snooze on the ground while their
husbands hustle luxury-class cars. Asked for paperwork on his
BMW, one Sudanese man explains apologetically that it blew
out the window on the long desert drive through Iraq.</p>
<p>Jordanian officials seize most of the stolen cars at the
border, though enough are slipping through -- along with
thousands of legally owned cars -- to seriously depress
Amman's established used-car market.</p>
<p>"I haven't sold a car in 10 days," complains dealer
Mohammed Assi, who specializes in luxury vehicles. He gazes
across his silent showroom at a gleaming Mercedes 300SE,
which sells for the equivalent of $50,000. "People come in
and say, `Why should I pay that when I can get one from a
Yemeni for $5,000?'" he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Assi says he won't buy stolen cars for resale because
"God is watching." But not all car dealers are so upright.
Asked why Kuwaiti cars are on sale at improbably low prices,
one dealer responds that the wind, sand and heat in the
sheikdom mean that "cars from Kuwait depreciate very
quickly."</p>
<p>In fact, used cars here -- as everywhere -- rarely are the
bargains they appear. Car sales in Jordan are tightly
controlled and buyers who want to keep the cars in the
country must pay duty of 140% or more, based on blue-book
value. As a result, many of the buyers are companies with
foreign employees, who can buy duty-free, or mechanics who
chop the cars up for spare parts.</p>
<p>Others are hoping to turn a few fast dinars by selling the
cars overseas. Zayed Kurdi, who works as a restaurant cashier
in Amman, took a day off this week to visit a makeshift car
lot outside the city where several hundred Kuwaiti vehicles
are on sale. His plan is to buy a car for a few hundred
dollars and drive it to Lebanon, where he can sell it for
several thousand. "The only question," he says, kicking the
tires on a dusty Toyota Cressida, "is can I get to Beirut and
back without being killed or robbed?"</p>
<p>The feverish car market creates problems for refugees who
aren't actively peddling their automobiles. The sight of
Kuwaiti plates has become a Pavlovian trigger for passing
Jordanians to start haggling. "People pull up at red lights
or follow me home and say, `Let's make a deal,'" says Essam
Hammad, a Jordanian who returned home from Kuwait in his 230E
Mercedes. He says he paid $20,000 for the car in Kuwait five
years ago and doesn't intend to give away what is now his
only valuable possession. But as a visiting American admires
the car, Mr. Hammad reconsiders.</p>
<p>"If you have U.S. dollars," he says, "maybe I am
flexible."</p>
