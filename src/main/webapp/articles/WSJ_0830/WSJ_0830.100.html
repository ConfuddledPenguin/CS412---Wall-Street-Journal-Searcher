	<p class="article-leader">Fluorescent-Bulb Sales
   Become Electrifying</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>SALES OF energy-saving fluorescent lightbulbs are
brightening so fast that retailers are having trouble keeping
some in stock.</p>
<p>One of the most popular is a 27-watt Panasonic bulb that
substitutes for 100-watt incandescent bulbs. "We've been out
of them 90% of the year," says a spokesman for Energy
Federation Inc., Framingham, Mass., a nonprofit concern that
sells the bulbs.</p>
<p>Don't expect a low price. The fluorescent equivalent of a
conventional incandescent 60-watt bulb retails for about $15.
But it lasts 10 times longer, screws into standard sockets,
casts about the same color and intensity of light and uses
only 15 watts.</p>
<p>Cheaper fluorescent bulbs -- retailing for less than $10
each -- may reach the market within a year, says Amory
Lovins, research director at the Rocky Mountain Institute, a
think tank in Snowmass, Colo.</p>
<p>Right now, utilities are the biggest customers of
fluorescent bulbs; they resell them to foster conservation,
which regulators are pressuring them to do. Lighting eats up
some 25% of the power generated in the U.S., and fluorescent
bulbs could cut the need for power plants costing $85 billion
to $200 billion, say Mr. Lovins and other energy researchers
in the September issue of Scientific American.
Environmentalists also tout the bulbs' potential to cut air
pollution from power generation.</p>
<p>This fall, Boston Edison Co. plans to offer customers
300,000 of the bulbs at $3 each, partly door-to-door. Buyers
are also thronging lighting stores and other outlets offering
the bulbs -- even at retail price, they get back more than
their costs through lower electric bills and fewer burnouts.</p>
<p>Buying the bulbs "is not a free lunch," note the
Scientific American authors. "It is a lunch you are paid to
eat."</p>
<p>Solar-Power Company</p>
<p>Gets Day in the Sun</p>
<p>SOON AFTER Iraqi tanks rolled into Kuwait, the switchboard
lighted up at Luz International Ltd.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles company is the biggest player in solar
power, and its rows of trough-like solar collectors in
southern California produce some 90% of the world's
sun-generated electricity. Now people want to know how Luz
can help ease the U.S. addiction to foreign oil, says
Kathleen Flanagan, a Luz spokeswoman.</p>
<p>The answer: It can't do much. Utilities buying Luz's power
use little oil. Still, Luz could realize big gains from
higher oil prices, says James MacKenzie, an energy analyst
with Washington's World Resources Institute. Utilities burn a
lot of natural gas, and gas prices "tend to follow oil
prices," he notes.</p>
<p>Thus, the Middle East crisis may close the cost gap
between Luz's power and cheaper electricity from natural gas.
And the crisis may get more congressmen to vote for
solar-power tax credits; Luz has worried that the credits
would be discontinued.</p>
<p>Even before the crisis, Luz had almost caught up with the
competition in electricity pricing. In a decade, power costs
at its new installations fell to eight cents a kilowatt-hour
from 24 cents, says Ms. Flanagan.</p>
<p>During the next few years, she adds, Luz expects to shave
another two cents off that, putting its power in the same
price range as conventional options -- at least in a few
sun-drenched states.</p>
<p>Propane Looks Good</p>
<p>To Fuel More Cars</p>
<p>AMONG THE pollution-cutting alternatives to gasoline,
propane appears best positioned to benefit from higher oil
prices.</p>
<p>Unlike some other alternative fuels like ethanol, propane
hasn't needed government subsidies to compete as a vehicle
fuel. It's the most widely used alternative fuel, propelling
more than 300,000 U.S. vehicles on the road and many off-road
vehicles; because of its relatively low pollution, it's often
used in forklifts. Some 85% of propane used in the U.S. is
supplied domestically as a byproduct of oil and natural gas
production; most of the imports come from Canada and Mexico.</p>
<p>Propane, used mainly for heating, is a "much-neglected"
vehicle fuel and could be substituted for gasoline faster
than other alternatives, says R.F. Webb, an Ottawa energy
expert. The facilities to convert vehicles to propane were
built up after the 1970s oil shocks and are now
"underutilized," he adds. Production of vehicle fuel based on
propane could be scaled up "without strenuous effort" to
propel about 6.5 million of the approximately 180 million
U.S. road vehicles, estimates Mr. Webb. Some 10,000 U.S.
retail outlets already sell propane as motor fuel, mainly for
trucks and other "fleet" vehicles.</p>
<p>Propane's ability to cut air pollution -- especially the
ground-level ozone that plagues big cities -- may soon boost
it as a motor fuel regardless of Mideast events. Using
propane can halve vehicles' ozone production, according to a
recent study at the University of California at Riverside.</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>ACCORDING TO a study by the California Energy Commission,
wind power can be cheaper than anything else in generating
electricity -- blowing away oil, natural gas, nuclear,
hydropower and coal. . . . Ten school buses powered by
pollution-lowering natural gas are expected to begin
operating in California early next year as part of a program
sponsored by state energy regulators and utilities, says
Tecogen Inc., a Waltham, Mass., concern that will supply the
buses' engines.</p>
