	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- Crude oil prices fell sharply following an OPEC
agreement to raise production and a growing perception among
market participants that Middle East tensions were easing.
   Ten of the 13 members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries agreed to raise output immediately to
help replace the four million barrels of oil taken off the
market because of the embargo of Iraqi and Kuwaiti petroleum.
Market estimates varied as to how much oil OPEC could quickly
put on the market.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Crude oil for October delivery fell $1.96 a barrel to
$25.92 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest level
in nearly three weeks. So far this week the contract has
dropped about $5 a barrel, or 16%, as financial markets
increasingly believe the chances for Mideast hostilities have
lessened.</p>
<p>"The crude market weakened on perceptions of a moderating
Persian Gulf crisis," said Andrew Lebow, a crude oil analyst
with E.D.&F. Man International Futures Inc. He said a number
of news reports pointed to the "potential for a peaceful
solution."</p>
<p>A number of traders said Iraq's promise to release women
and children held hostage, followed quickly by praise from
the U.S. government for the move, was one sign of easing
tensions. Market participants also pointed to reports that
Iraq had made behind-the-scenes peace overtures to the U.S.</p>
<p>And in a market looking to go lower, even news that was
several days old was cited as a factor, such as the planned
meeting between the U.N. Secretary General and Iraq's foreign
minister, scheduled for today.</p>
<p>Among OPEC members, the country that has sizable spare
capacity that could ratchet up production quickly is Saudi
Arabia. Traders were expecting that country to produce an
extra two million barrels a day, with enough output from
other OPEC nations to replace a total of three million to 3.5
million of the lost Iraqi and Kuwaiti production.</p>
<p>But some reports on the New York Merc said Saudi Arabia
already was producing an extra two million barrels a day and
could produce one million beyond that by the end of the year,
for a total output as high as 8.5 million barrels daily. Some
people remained skeptical, however. "They've been working on
projects to upgrade production capacity, but 8.5 million is a
very high number," Mr. Lebow said.</p>
<p>Gasoline prices also were off yesterday, in sympathy with
crude declines. Gasoline for September delivery finished at
84.72 cents a gallon, down 3.81.</p>
<p>Heating oil fell sharply, with the September contract down
7.88 cents a gallon to 71.64 cents. A sharp buildup in
inventories reported Tuesday afternoon by the American
Petroleum Institute depressed prices. "Heating oil seems to
be in adequate supply right now," one trader said.</p>
<p>In other commodity markets yesterday:</p>
<p>GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Prices of many corn, wheat and
soybean futures contracts sank for the third consecutive day
in the absence of any threatening developments in the Middle
East. Last week, grain prices rose on speculation that any
prolonged climb in oil prices would enable oil-producing
nations to import more U.S. grain. "The market is taking out
the war premium," said Victor Lespinasse, an assistant vice
president at Dean Witter Reynolds, Chicago. Crop prices are
also being depressed by good growing weather in the Midwest.</p>
<p>SUGAR: Futures prices eased. The October contract was off
0.42 cent a pound at 11.05 cents and dropped at one point
below 11 cents. According to one analyst, the drop was a
delayed reaction to the softness that has hit many commodity
markets as fears of a war in the Middle East have eased.
There are no new developments concerning the current sugar
beet crop in Europe, the analyst said. Moderate but steady
demand for sugar in the world market from Mideast countries
has been curtailed by the crisis in that area, the analyst
said.</p>
<p>ORANGE JUICE: Most futures contracts dropped their daily
permissible limits. Contract months from November forward
declined their daily limit of five cents a pound; November
ended at $1.5330. The soon-to-expire September contract,
which can rise or fall as much as 10 cents a pound from its
previous close, was down as much as eight cents a pound at
one point before partially recovering to end 5.95 cents lower
at $1.6345. Contributing to selling in the September contract
is the fact that Tuesday will be the first day on which
notices will be issued to deliver the concentrate against
September futures, an analyst said. Concentrate prices have
been under pressure because retail demand has slowed in the
face of price advances caused by damage to the Florida citrus
crop by last December's freeze. The lower prices might help
to revive some consumer demand, the analyst said. However,
supply concerns have been alleviated by a
better-than-expected crop this year in Florida and
expectations that new-crop Brazilian supplies will soon be
available, which could create further pressure on prices, the
analyst said.

<p>COCOA: Futures prices declined. The December contract was
off $31 a metric ton to $1,249. Analysts following
fundamentals said that rain in the Ivory Coast has eased
fears that recent dryness would hurt the crop, although one
analyst said the rains were light and scattered and weren't a
major factor. "The market fell back because there was little
reason for it to have advanced in the first place," she said.
John Gambino, a senior futures technical analyst for Merrill
Lynch, said that on a purely technical basis, the drop in the
December contract to $1,100 a ton in mid-August from $1,560
in May was simply a correction of the market's rally from
$960 to $1,560 between last December and May. Now, Mr.
Gambino said, "Prices may have bottomed out and could be
setting the stage for the renewal of the bull move." The
downward trend, he said, "fits into a classic three-wave
correction" that he now believes is complete. According to
that scenario, he said, the recent low of $1,100 "marks the
resumption of the bull market that began last December."</p>
