	<p class="article-leader">Citing successful introduction of new models and solid
gains for domestic sales, Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's biggest
car maker, said its consolidated pretax profit in the fiscal
year ended June 30 surged 34% to 837.81 billion yen ($5.83
billion) from 625.66 billion yen a year earlier.
   Toyota Motor's vehicle sales during the reporting period
grew strongly world-wide, supported in particular by strong
demand in the domestic market. Japan is the company's largest
market, where sales reached record levels for the third
consecutive year, the company said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Net income rose 27% to 441.3 billion yen, or 144.15 yen a
share, from 346.26 billion yen, or 121.19 yen a share.</p>
<p>Sales totaled 9.192 trillion yen, a 15% gain from 8.021
trillion yen last year.</p>
<p>Toyota said its overseas operations are likely to face
much more severe conditions, as demand in the U.S. market
continues to slacken and competition increases in Europe.</p>
<p>The company disclosed a plan to change Toyota's corporate
charter as part of an effort to branch out into nonautomotive
businesses. Toyota officials will ask a shareholders meeting,
scheduled for Sept. 26, to approve diversification plans. The
company wants to raise nonautomotive sales, currently
accounting for 2% of overall unconsolidated sales, to 6% in
fiscal 1994.</p>
