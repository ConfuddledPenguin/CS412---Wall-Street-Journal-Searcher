	<p class="article-leader">The Saddam Hussein affair, starring a villain out of
central casting, has set off an energetic round of huffing
and puffing about the subject of Arabs, interests and allies
in the Middle East. We have our own long record on the
subject of Iraq and its assorted neighbors. We -- who told
you that the Israeli bombing of the Iraqi nuclear reactor was
a good thing, and who warned during the U.S. hostage crisis
and the Iraq-Iran war not to get too close to Iraq -- are
here today to tell you that Assad of Hama is a Saddam-style
cutthroat but that the royal families of Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait are not.
   We have read various editorialists and pundits in recent
days who either want the West to trust Syria's Assad to help
us oust the Kuwaiti monarchy, or who want to tar all Arabs in
the region with the Assad brush. Surely it ought to be
possible to bring more sophistication to the subject of the
Arabs' future.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A good example of the sort of helpful thinking now needed
on the Gulf region was an article on this page last week by
Saudi lawyer, Abdulaziz H. Fahad ("Thanks to Saddam the Arabs
Outgrow Arabism," August 22). He pointed out that the "Arab
world" has been held together by the threat of riots and
assassination; a distinction was made between the
perpetrators of blackmail and blackmail's victims.</p>
<p>"The resilience of the Gulf states," Mr. Fahad wrote, "may
finally provide the needed assurance for the Arab world to
join the democratic revolutions of the 1980s. Secure in the
knowledge that their people's loyalty could not be
manipulated by outside forces in the name of Arabism, one
hopes that the perennially insecure Arab regimes may turn
inward and start the process of democratization." (In an
article nearby today, Mr. Fahad proposes that Saudi Arabia
seize the current opportunity to liberate itself from OPEC.)</p>
<p>If now the Saudis and Kuwaitis learn that they can stand
up to this "Arab world" and that they can in fact rely on the
United States, they indeed have some prospect of evolution
toward democracy.</p>
<p>There seems to be a general mood in political circles now
to somehow remove the leadership in places such as Kuwait or
even Saudi Arabia with a wave of our hand and turn the
country over to the people. Recall, though, what followed
when we judged the Shah to be irredeemably undemocratic.
Perhaps the Persian Gulf will at last have some chance of
evolving toward greater pluralism if Western intellectuals
stop agitating a politics of overthrow for its governments.</p>
<p>The Kuwaitis have already held some democratic
experiments, and in general have done well by their people.
The Saudis have been host to the Islamic pilgrimages, with
the risks that has demonstrably carried. Hosni Mubarak has
been struggling, at considerable personal risk, to modernize
the politics and economy of an Egypt that in the early days
of Arabism gave the world Nasser.</p>
<p>Contrast these efforts at political and social melioration
with the Syria of Hafez al Assad. Assad not only did Hama
(subdued at cost of at least 10,000 lives in 1982), but is in
military control of the territory in which the
Lebanon-related U.S. hostages are being held. If, as now
seems to be the case, these hostages are held by relatives of
the terrorists who are prisoners in Kuwait, then everyone
knows exactly who they are. The Syrian authorities with the
troops and police on the ground should be held responsible.</p>
<p>If the forces in the Gulf now led by the U.S. eliminate
the Iraqi threat, it seems likely that the Middle East will
undergo a long period of reordering its status quo. It is
certainly in the interests of the West and of the populations
long under the heel of Arabism to see significant parts of
this region begin the process of integrating with an orderly
world system. When that process begins, it will be important
for the West to recognize Arabs who want to help create a
civilized world and Arabs who wish to prevent it.</p>
