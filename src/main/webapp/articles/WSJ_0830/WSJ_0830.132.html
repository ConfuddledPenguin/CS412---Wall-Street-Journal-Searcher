	<p class="article-leader">FRAMINGHAM, Mass. -- Dennison Manufacturing Co., seeking
to placate shareholders and clear the way for its proposed
merger with Avery International Corp., has agreed to settle a
holder suit filed against it in connection with the merger.
   Under the proposed settlement, Avery Dennison Corp., the
surviving entity after the merger, would pay a quarterly
dividend of 20 cents a share for four consecutive quarters
after the merger closes.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Avery, based in Pasadena, Calif., currently pays a
quarterly dividend of 16 cents a share and has said that it
will recommend a quarterly rate of 18 cents a share if the
merger is completed.</p>
<p>The dividend rate to be paid after the four quarters
covered by the proposed agreement would be at the discretion
of the company's board, according to Gerald Hendrick,
Dennison's general counsel.</p>
<p>The stock-swap merger of the two companies would create
one of the nation's largest office-products concerns, with
about $2.5 billion in annual sales. Dennison holders would
receive 1.12 Avery shares for each Dennison share.</p>
<p>Dennison said the settlement is contingent upon completion
of the merger, an agreement on a stipulation in the
settlement and court approval. The suit is pending in
Massachusetts Superior Court.</p>
