	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The dollar and yen, the two currencies hit the
hardest by expensive oil, rose yesterday on the back of
falling petroleum prices.
   The U.S. and Japanese currencies fared the best against
continental European currencies. The pound and other
currencies supported by high interest rates held their own.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The biggest loser on the day was the Swiss franc, which
was sold off when dealers learned that Switzerland's
benchmark Lombard rate had been lowered to 9.375% from 9.5%
Tuesday. Last week, the rate was above 10%.</p>
<p>In addition, comments yesterday by National Bank President
Markus Lusser convinced currency investors that the central
bank will hold firm only on interest rates of long-term
securities, and not the shortterm paper favored by currency
speculators.</p>
<p>Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
1.5595 marks and 1.2900 Swiss francs, up from 1.5563 marks
and 1.2867 francs late Tuesday in New York. The U.S. currency
was also changing hands at 143.60 yen, down from 143.73 yen.</p>
<p>The yen posted gains against the mark and Swiss franc. The
mark declined to 92.081 yen from 92.354 yen, and the franc
dropped to 111.318 yen from 111.704 yen.</p>
<p>In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the dollar was quoted
at 143.65 yen, down from 144.35 yen at the close there
Wednesday. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about
1.5599 marks, up from Wednesday's Tokyo close of 1.5556
marks.</p>
<p>The market's movements yesterday also reflected the first
attempts by dealers to level positions ahead of month-end
accounting and a holiday weekend in North America.</p>
<p>Amid these adjustments, the dollar is enjoying a grace
period, said Mark Morris, a dealer in New York for National
Westminster Bank. Even as it retains lingering support as a
"haven" from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the greenback is
gaining from the effect that new-found optimism for peace is
having on oil prices.</p>
<p>Once dealers are completely free to ignore Baghdad, he
said, the dollar will fall once again. Even cheap oil won't
save the wobbly U.S. economy, many observers think.</p>
<p>Sterling was trading late in New York at $1.9460, up from
$1.9428 Tuesday. The Canadian and Australian dollars ended at
87.63 cents and 83.12 cents, respectively, up from 87.54
cents and 82.97 cents.</p>
<p>In fact, these so-called Anglo high-yielders, which had
risen in recent weeks because of their status as
petrocurrencies, stood to lose yesterday as the benchmark
crude oil futures contract fell $1.96 on the New York
Mercantile Exchange to $25.92 a barrel. But interest-rate
shopping held these currencies firm.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, speculation about a possible Japanese
discount-rate increase heated up as two Japanese daily
newspapers reported that the Finance Ministry and Bank of
Japan had started discussing such a move Tuesday. Bank of
Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno denied any such discussions
Wednesday. However, early Thursday in Tokyo, the Bank of
Japan raised the discount rate by 0.75 percentage point to
6%.</p>
<p>Analysts had been looking for the Bank of Japan to raise
its discount rate by early October, after the central bank's
quarterly survey of business sentiment and the second-quarter
gross national product report come out in the middle of
September.</p>
<p>Jumpei Ishii, deputy foreign-exchange department manager
at Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank, said the market has factored a
rise of 75 basis points in the discount rate into the market.
Mr. Ishii himself predicted a rise to 6.25% from the current
5.25%.</p>
<p>The dollar rose against the yen in heavy Asian trading
Wednesday, finishing mixed against other currencies. The U.S.
currency was last quoted in Tokyo Wednesday at 144.35 yen,
compared with 143.20 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Yen selling to close out long positions shook the market
in the Japanese afternoon and pushed volume to high levels.
The pound joined the dollar in rising strongly against the
yen.</p>
<p>The dollar ended European trading slightly higher, in what
traders termed a technical consolidation amid quiet dealings.
Dollar activity was slack, with most action focused on cross
movements in the yen.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $385.30 an ounce, up 30 cents. Estimated
volume was a heavy six million ounces.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at $386.25 an
ounce.</p>
