	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Roger L. Werner Jr. resigned as president and
chief executive officer of sports cable channel ESPN to head
Prime Ventures Inc., a regional sports network company newly
formed by cable executive Bill Daniels.
   Mr. Werner, 40 years old, was considered one of the most
promising young executives at Capital Cities/ABC Inc., which
runs ESPN and holds an 80% stake in the cable channel. A
successor will be named shortly, said Herb Granath, ESPN's
chairman and the president of ABC Video Enterprises. ESPN's
No. 2 executive, Steve Borenstein, may be the likely choice.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A former consultant with McKinsey & Co. who had advised
ESPN in its early days, Mr. Werner joined the channel in 1980
as a vice president of finance and rose through several
promotions before jumping over to a sister unit, the ABC
television network, to become executive vice president there.
He returned to ESPN as its new president two years ago.</p>
<p>Mr. Werner leaves ESPN a cable powerhouse, with 56 million
subscribing households and pretax earnings that topped $100
million last year. But the sports channel faces declining
profits this year because of expected losses of $20 million
or more on the first year of a new ESPN baseball contract,
and additional losses expected on a new football contract.</p>
<p>ESPN officials said, however, the sports channel will post
ample profits this year, though earnings will be down from
1989 levels.</p>
<p>Mr. Granath said Mr. Werner's departure was his own
choice. "We're very much chagrined to see him leaving, though
ESPN is in good shape," Mr. Granath said.</p>
<p>Mr. Werner was lured to the new venture by Mr. Daniels,
the chairman of cable company Daniels & Associates, with a
generous offer that Capital Cities/ABC couldn't afford to
match.</p>
<p>"Bill Daniels made a sensational offer, and I decided to
take him up on it," Mr. Werner said yesterday in a telephone
news conference. He wouldn't reveal whether his new job
includes equity in the venture, but he said, "I do have a
substantial upside opportunity in growing the business. I
look forward to being an entrepreneur again."</p>
<p>Prime Ventures Inc. will oversee a variety of
sports-oriented properties controlled or minority-owned by
Mr. Daniels. They include six regional sports networks owned
and operated by Daniels and Tele-Communications Inc., the
nation's largest cable operator.</p>
<p>Mr. Werner's new post also will oversee a national sports
programming service called Prime Network; Prime Ticket
Netowrk, which operates in southern California and Hawaii and
is the nation's largest regional sports network; minority
interests in Home Sports Entertainment in Dallas and Houston
and regional sports channels elsewhere; and Daniels's
majority ownership of production company First Auto Sports
Television, and Denver Grand Prix Auto Race Inc.</p>
