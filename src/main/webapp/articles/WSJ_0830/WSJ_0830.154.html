	<p class="article-leader">Pittsburgh National Bank, a unit of PNC Financial Corp.,
said it paid $100,000 of back pay to 13 employees to settle
charges by federal regulators that the bank discriminated
against minority job applicants.
   Pittsburgh National said it didn't discriminate, but that
it didn't maintain adequate records to prove that its hiring
policies didn't violate federal regulations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Examiners from the Office of Federal Contract Compliance
Programs said Pittsburgh National hired a lower proportion of
minority applicants than white applicants for clerical
positions.</p>
<p>The bank said more of the minority applicants may have
applied at times when the bank had no openings, or they may
have requested full-time jobs when the bank had only
part-time positions available. However, the bank didn't note
on each job application why the applicant didn't obtain a
job, and thus was unable to prove that it hadn't
discriminated, said Wilbur E. Hines, senior vice president,
personnel.</p>
<p>As part of the settlement, the bank hired 13 minority job
applicants who previously hadn't obtained jobs and split the
$100,000 of back pay among them, Mr. Hines said. Also, the
bank improved its record-keeping to ensure that it can
document its compliance with anti-discrimination rules, he
said.</p>
