	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo stocks retreated on dealer-led selling Wednesday, as
profits were taken after three sessions of advances for the
Nikkei index. Traders said arbitrage selling added to the
decline.
   In London, share prices closed slightly down, yet far
above the day's lows, as sentiment drifted toward a stalemate
on the London market's near-term prospects.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Tokyo's Nikkei index of 225 issues was off 815.97 points
at 24894.79; on Tuesday, the index gained 569 points.</p>
<p>In Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index rose 34.68 points to
close the morning session at 24929.47.</p>
<p>Wednesday's first section volume was estimated at 430
million shares, down from 504.2 million Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all first section issues,
which rose 42.92 points Tuesday, lost 36.09 to 1911.42 on
Wednesday.</p>
<p>The second section index, which jumped 88.55 points
Tuesday, eased 4.96 to 3687.38, on volume estimated at 9.8
million shares, up from 9.3 million shares a day earlier.</p>
<p>Press reports that the Bank of Japan was negotiating with
the Finance Ministry on raising the official discount rate --
the interest rate on loans to banks -- were viewed as
weakening the Japanese government bond market, but traders
said this scarcely affected stocks. The Bank of Japan raised
the rate 0.75 percentage point to 6% early Thursday, after
denying on Wednesday that the talks had been held.</p>
<p>"The market's already discounted a 75-basis-point rise," a
trader said before the rate increase was announced. A basis
point is 1/100th of a percentage point.</p>
<p>The bulk of the stock market's declines stemmed from
dealer selling, traders said, with profit-taking coming on
shares that led the three-session rally from Friday. Declines
caused by arbitrage selling in tiny chunks throughout the day
"complemented" the dealer-led selling, a trader said.
Pressure remained on futures indexes, keeping them at a
discount to the cash indexes and allowing for limited
arbitrage selling.</p>
<p>The Mideast confrontation kept trading thin and oriented
for the short term, with only fringe players participating in
bargain-hunting, observers said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the financial daily Nikkei Keizai Shimbun said
Nomura Securities and leading commercial banks, including
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Bank of Tokyo and Mitsubishi Bank, were
reportedly involved, perhaps unwittingly, in a 1.7
billion-yen ($11.8 million) Colombian drug money laundering
scheme. The news hit the market in midafternoon, traders
said, but stock prices appeared little affected, continuing
lower at a steady pace. Observers also said the likelihood
that the institutions will be implicated in the scandal is
slim.</p>
<p>Shares that fell as a result of profit-taking included
blue-chip leaders such as Sony, down 290 yen at 7,260 yen
($50.55).</p>
<p>TDK lost 140 to 6,060, Kyocera slid 170 to 7,530, Fanuc
fell 200 to 5,800, and Hitachi dropped 40 to 1,350.</p>
<p>Nomura Securities fell 80 to 1,710 and Nikko Securities
declined 50 to 900, but Yamaichi Securities gained 9 to 960.
Daiwa Securities slipped 10 to 1,100.</p>
<p>Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank fell 100 to 1,900, Mitsubishi Bank
lost 60 to 1,850 and Bank of Tokyo declined 40 to 1,150.</p>
<p>Nippon Mining was up 3 at 704, Sumitomo Mining rose 10 to
1,300, Dowa Mining fell 1 to 714, and Mitsui Mining rose 25
to 750. Teikoku Oil firmed 50 to 1,350, and Mitsubishi Oil
rose 19 to 969.</p>
<p>In London, traders had expected Wall Street to drift
downward, but an about-face in early New York trading helped
the London market to its flat finish. A lack of genuine
buying interest was again a main feature, and traders
attributed price fluctuations to market makers covering their
positions. "The market is in for a long stalemate," a trader
said, adding that volume is unlikely to pick up soon.</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell
0.4 point to close at 2125.7. The day's low was 2210.1, its
high 2128.1. Volume was 297.3 million shares, slightly more
than Tuesday's total of 281.6 million shares, which is the
low for the year. The FT 30-share index finished up 1.5
points at 1658.9.</p>
<p>Several companies posted interim results that were in line
with traders' expectations. Cadbury Schweppes, after
reporting a 12% rise in pretax profit, closed at 325 pence
($6.32), up 7 pence.</p>
<p>Ladbrokes PLC, which also recorded a 12% rise in pretax
profit, fell 5 to 274. Traders said sentiment was affected by
a brokerage firm's downgrading of full-year earnings
forecasts by #10 million ($19.4 million) to #340 million.</p>
<p>Pearson PLC, its first-half pretax profit up 15%, was down
4 pence at 690 pence.</p>
<p>W.H. Smith, a diversified bookseller that had a 1.8%
decline in pretax profit for the year, fell 5 to 321.</p>
<p>Carlton Communications, downgraded by Barclays de Zoete
Wedd on the belief that the strong pound continues to dent
its U.S. earnings, fell 8 to 337.</p>
<p>Prices for many oil stocks were firmer, despite an
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreement to
raise production. The Middle East conflict still remains a
potentially bullish factor for crude prices, traders said.
Enterprise Oil climbed to 651, up 12. Lasmo Oil shares rose 7
to 481.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, share prices closed higher in Paris and
Frankfurt, marginally higher in Stockholm, lower in Brussels,
Milan and Madrid, and mixed in Zurich and Amsterdam. South
African gold stocks closed slightly higher. The Paris climb
was a response to gains in the Paris bond market and was
fueled by optimism about the oil price outlook, which also
prompted Frankfurt's moderate advance. Trading was thin on
most bourses.</p>
<p>Stock prices closed lower in Hong Kong, Taipei, Singapore,
Wellington and Manila, and higher in Seoul, and were little
changed in Sydney, as overall activity was generally thin.
Hong Kong stocks slumped 2%. Taipei's main stock index
nose-dived 5.57% on profit-taking, which also pushed prices
down in Manila. Seoul's rise in prices was the third in a
row.</p>
<p>Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.</p>
