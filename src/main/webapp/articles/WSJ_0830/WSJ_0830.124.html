	<p class="article-leader">American Express Co.'s travel unit, getting acquisitive
after nearly five years on the sidelines, has agreed to buy
AIT Travel Management Cos. of Phoenix, Ariz.
   American Express officials declined to disclose the price
of the acquisition, which the company expects to be completed
soon, pending regulatory approval. The purchase by American
Express Travel Related Services is the first acquisition of a
business travel firm since mid-1985.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Indeed, the decision to buy AIT Travel, which specializes
in business travel in the Southwest region, reflects American
Express's bullish outlook on the business-travel market.
Despite a slowdown in the U.S. economy, the company estimates
that the overall market for business travel and entertainment
in the U.S. will reach $115 billion in 1990, up from $95
billion two years ago. The acquisition also fits with
American Express's strategy to expand in the Southwest.</p>
<p>AIT Travel Management operates 26 full-service ticket
locations in eight Southwestern states, with sales volume for
1990 expected to top $90 million.</p>
