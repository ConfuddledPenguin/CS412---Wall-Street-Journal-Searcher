	<p class="article-leader">KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine -- When a somber President Bush first
went before the nation to announce the dispatch of troops to
the Persian Gulf, he could offer a simple, clear rationale:
Saudi Arabia's giant oil fields were threatened by Iraqi
troops sweeping through Kuwait, and the loss of those fields
would pose "a major threat" to America's economy.
   In the three weeks since then, Mr. Bush has succeeded in
securing the oil fields, and in gathering an impressive show
of international condemnation for Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But now the president is running into real problems
articulating and selling the administration's broader goals
in the Gulf crisis -- goals such as the restoration of the
emir of Kuwait, an objective that will be tough to achieve
and difficult to sell to Americans unaccustomed to fighting
for unelected monarchies.</p>
<p>"I think the president has been better with deeds than
with plans or words, at least as they're expressed," says
Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D., N.J.). "I don't know what the
mission is fully expected to be."</p>
<p>Whereas oil once seemed the overriding American
consideration, Mr. Bush recently gave a 25-minute speech
about the Gulf crisis to the Veterans of Foreign Wars without
once mentioning the word "oil." He stressed instead more
idealistic goals such as stopping Iraq's "assault on the very
essence of international order and civilized ideals."</p>
<p>Mr. Bush has often compared Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein to
Adolf Hitler -- yet in a meeting with lawmakers this week he
didn't say that removing him was an American goal. Privately,
other officials worry that whoever follows Saddam Hussein
might be even worse.</p>
<p>And the president has made little of what some analysts
and politicians think may be the most powerful argument for
challenging Saddam Hussein: The likelihood that this crisis
could set the tone for the whole international order in the
post-Cold War period.</p>
<p>"I think that they have done quite well in saying Saudi
Arabia asked us to come and we went and this was all part of
a collective effort," says William Quandt, a Carter
administration Middle East adviser now at the Brookings
Institution. "Where I think they have been a little more
careless is in not having made enough of a point, which I
think people understand pretty readily, that . . . in this
crisis, we have the chance for laying down the ground rules
for some time ahead."</p>
<p>The administration's difficulty in articulating a clear,
long-term mission in the Gulf seems to arise because the
president and his aides aren't sure how aggressive they want
to be. In a radio address to armed forces yesterday, as in
all his prepared remarks since the crisis began, Mr. Bush
talked of four goals: forcing an Iraqi withdrawal from
Kuwait, restoring the Kuwaiti government, ensuring the
stability of the Persian Gulf and protecting Americans
abroad.</p>
<p>There was a flurry of reports yesterday that the
administration had turned down feelers from Iraq on
negotiations. In fact, the White House said, an official of a
past U.S. administration had broached some ideas for a
solution. But it was unclear whether they were his own or
represented a formal overture from Baghdad, and the White
House said there was "nothing in this particular proposal
that merited its pursuit."</p>
<p>Some analysts worry that Mr. Bush may have created
long-term problems for himself in setting one of those four
goals, the restoration of the ousted emir of Kuwait. Even
among Arabs that deplore Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Kuwait's
ruling al Sabah family wasn't very popular, and Americans are
more comfortable if they can be told they are battling for
democracy rather than royalty.</p>
<p>Yet now if Mr. Bush accepts anything less than restoration
of the Kuwaiti emir as part of a negotiated deal with Iraq,
he would be seen as having failed to achieve one of his
fundamental goals -- and in the process would unsettle the
ruling royal family in neighboring Saudi Arabia. Mr. Bush
seemed to waver on this goal this week, saying in passing
that whether the wealthy ruling family remains in power is "a
matter for the Kuwaitis to decide."</p>
<p>Beyond that, administration officials are torn by the idea
of going well beyond the stated goal of forcing an Iraqi
withdrawal from Kuwait and using the current crisis as an
excuse to get rid of Saddam Hussein and destroy his ominous
chemical and nuclear weapons programs.</p>
<p>Officials worry that the U.S. could bite off more than it
could chew in the Gulf by adopting grander and grander goals.
The administration is sobered by memories of the Korean War,
when the U.S. tried to go beyond simply protecting South
Korea and ended up bogged down in a long war that succeeded
only in preserving the status quo.</p>
<p>And while the idea of using the big American military
force against Iraq is tempting, the administration also
realizes that current Arab support for the international
campaign against Saddam Hussein could shatter as soon as
American bullets begin killing Arab soldiers.</p>
<p>So Mr. Bush at the moment is saying, in essence, that
he'll leave a big American army and armada in the region
while he waits for international economic sanctions to force
Iraq out of Kuwait. And in the meantime, he's willing to give
others' diplomatic efforts a chance, but he doesn't see much
hope in them.</p>
<p>As Congress begins returning to Washington from its August
recess, that position leaves the administration open to
complaints from two sides -- from those who want to go much
further and those who fear the administration may yet go too
far.</p>
<p>"The president needs to formulate our goal in terms of
eliminating the military capacity of Iraq," said Sen.
Lautenberg after meeting with Mr. Bush Tuesday. "That is a
clear policy." Similarly, Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana, one
of the Republican Party's most influential lawmakers on
foreign policy, flatly declared that Saddam Hussein poses
such a long-term threat to the Gulf that "he does have to
leave the leadership of the country, and beyond that, many of
the forces that he has aggregated have to be removed as a
threat."</p>
<p>By contrast, Nebraska Democratic Sen. Robert Kerrey
declared in a television interview over the weekend that "the
only justification that I find legitimate" for dispatching
American forces to the Gulf was preventing an invasion of
Saudi Arabia. "I question a response that says that we're
going to go there and have our young people die so that we
can have cheap oil here at home, or cheap gasoline here at
home," he said on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press."</p>
<p>And in fact, the administration at one point seemed to
flirt with using cheap oil as one reason for putting American
soldiers in the line of hostilities. President Bush declared
to a Pentagon audience that "our jobs, our way of life, our
own freedom and the freedom of friendly countries around the
world would all suffer if control of the world's great oil
reserves fell into the hands of that one man, Saddam
Hussein."</p>
<p>But such a rationale undermines support for the U.S. even
among friendly Arabs, because it implies that the U.S. is
interested only in grabbing Arab oil and not in the region's
other political or economic problems. And some lawmakers
report that, even among Americans, the oil argument isn't
persuasive; some voters would rather pay a few cents more for
a gallon of gas than risk having their sons or daughters
killed in combat.</p>
<p>As long as the Bush administration has "stayed on the high
ground of opposing aggression in one form or another, they're
in good shape," says Richard Murphy, who was the State
Department's top Middle East diplomat during much of the
Reagan administration. "When you start talking about our way
of life . . . it causes you a hell of a problem with the
American public because they don't think Americans should be
shot at for $18, $20 or $21 dollar-a-barrel oil."</p>
<p>The administration seems to be on the verge of crafting a
more sophisticated argument in which it can call the American
military deployment a significant success even if Saddam
Hussein remains in power in Baghdad.</p>
<p>Officials are starting to contend that, however this
crisis ends, the U.S. will have so radically altered the
political ground rules in the Persian Gulf that Iraq will be
contained and American friends protected against further
aggression. The U.S. will have set a precedent for rapidly
intervening to protect Saudi Arabia, and might well leave
behind significant stockpiles of military equipment and
perhaps some American Air Force personnel to guard the Saudi
kingdom. And at the same time, the argument goes, other,
smaller Gulf oil states have moved further under the American
defense umbrella as a result of the crisis, making them less
vulnerable at the same time.</p>
<p>That argument may well have broad appeal -- but so far, it
isn't one President Bush has made publicly.</p>
