	<p class="article-leader">For years, corporate treasurers dreamed of a truly global
debt security that could be traded anywhere in the world,
sold easily in any time zone. Someday, they imagined, a new
Superbond would arise and throw off the usual shackles of
corporate bonds, lowering companies' financing costs by
allowing them to tap a world-wide pool of investors
simultaneously.
   Now, New York-based Citicorp is marketing what it hoped
would be just such a bond. And, as with many dreams when
reality sets in, a few warts show.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"What we are trying to do is create a global security that
can sell in Europe, Asia and the U.S.," Michael T. Nugent,
group treasurer of Citibank's credit-card business, said. "We
learned we had to get out and educate investors more."</p>
<p>Citicorp has unfurled three separate $1.4 billion
offerings of the new global-style bonds since mid-May,
including one last week. To its credit, the banking giant did
succeed in the arduous task of arranging for local
settlement, or delivery and administration of bonds in each
market. Still, though the new global bonds were rated
triple-A, investors demanded higher yields than those found
on other triple-A corporate debt.</p>
<p>In the past, U.S. corporations have sold bonds directly
into specific markets abroad, but -- following in the World
Bank's footsteps -- Citicorp believes it is the first company
ever to sell securities in multiple markets simultaneously.
Such global offerings have long been stymied by a thicket of
conflicting national regulations and the absence of a
universal system for settling trades.</p>
<p>Backing the bonds' interest and principal payments are a
pool of credit-card obligations, a structure with which
Citicorp was already familiar as the leader in the $30
billion market for credit-card securities. Because of this
credit-card wrinkle, the new bonds had some complexities that
an industrial borrower wouldn't face. They also turned out to
be less than an ideal global security, for example, because
asset-backed securities can't be sold directly in Japan,
though Japanese institutions outside the country can buy
them.</p>
<p>In creating the bonds, Citicorp experimented for 18
months, trying various structures in different markets,
bickering with underwriters, and making a few mistakes. The
company sold bonds registered with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. It sold unregistered securities in
bearer, or anonymous, form in the Euromarkets. It placed
credit-card securities directly with big institutions. And it
wound up following in the footsteps of a World Bank global
offering made last September.</p>
<p>Along with other credit-card issuers, Citicorp sold
securities structured like mortgaged-backed securities, where
cash flows vary and the principal is paid over different
periods during the life of the securities. When these proved
too complex, except for sophisticated institutions such as
banks and insurance companies, Citicorp issued securities for
which the principal was paid in a lump sum at maturity. This
way, they looked like regular corporate bonds.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the bank experimented with different
maturities, ranging from three to 7 1/2 years, and deals of
different sizes, $225 million to $1 billion.</p>
<p>All of the offerings were rated triple-A. Initially, they
were backed by letters of credit from similarly rated
international banks, such as Union Bank of Switzerland,
Credit Suisse and Sumitomo Bank Ltd. (Citicorp's own debt is
rated double-A-minus.)</p>
<p>But the bank learned that investors had a limited capacity
to absorb debt backed by letters of credit, especially
because few big banks were rated triple-A and their numbers
were dwindling. And investors' risk was that if the credit
rating of the bank issuing the guarantee was lowered, the
securities also would be downgraded.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, Citicorp adopted a so-called
senior-subordinated structure, in which an offering is
divided into two parts. The first, or senior, part -- about
90% of the offering -- is rated triple-A, and is supported by
a higher-yielding, more-risky second, or subordinated, part
that is rated only single-A.</p>
<p>Still, "We weren't happy with our pricing," Mr. Nugent,
the credit-card official, said. "We were getting single-A
prices." The bank was paying more to borrow than it wanted
to. So last summer, he and his staff met with the bank's main
underwriters in Montreal and New York. They discovered that
investors were confused by the securities' many different
structures, that the secondary, or resale, market for the
bonds was inadequate, and that settlement was slow and
clumsy. Citicorp also learned something about its
underwriters.</p>
<p>"I presumed that all investment banks educated investors
about structure, cash flow, what they were buying, the risk,
the underlying credit," Mr. Nugent said. Instead, "The
investment banks were essentially selling a cheap triple-A,"
he said. "They were doing a limited amount of work to clear
{sell} whatever was out there, and I was paying for that."</p>
<p>Indeed, Etienne Bur, a vice president responsible for
managing Banque Nationale de Paris's own portfolios in Paris,
says part of the bonds' appeal has been that he can "buy a
triple-A at single-A prices."</p>
<p>Mr. Nugent said, "I came away {from the underwriter
meetings} with the realization that we had to standardize the
program, pick a structure and stick with it, and eliminate
confusion in the marketplace." Citicorp officials got the
same advice from the World Bank, which advised talking
directly to investors and not just underwriters. (Last fall,
the big multilateral lending institution launched the first
global bond simultaneously in Europe and the U.S.)</p>
<p>Mr. Nugent and his staff settled on the name "standard"
for their securities; previously, they used five titles. They
also put together a 150-frame slide show. But crucial to the
efforts was liquidity: the ability to trade the securities
without upsetting their price. "If there is no secondary
market, we are going to fall on our face," Mr. Nugent said.</p>
<p>Thus, the bank decided to increase its offerings' size. It
also persuaded two big Eurobond clearing, or settlement,
agencies, Cedel S.A. and Euroclear System, to begin handling
the securities. Previously, "If a U.S. investor wanted to
sell, and the best price was in Europe, there was no way of
delivering from the U.S. to Europe, other than putting the
securities on an airplane," Bruce W. Bantz, a vice president
at Citibank's U.S. credit-card business, said, adding, "We
tried to have a security that everybody thought of as a
home-market security."</p>
<p>This was no easy task, given Citicorp's fondness for
elaborately structured credit-card securities. With $24.22
billion in credit-card receivables as of March 31, Citicorp
is the biggest U.S. issuer of credit cards. By selling
securities with interest and principal payments backed by
credit-card obligations, a process known as securitization,
the bank gains another funding tool, boosts its return on
assets and frees up capital for other businesses.</p>
<p>Finally, Citicorp arranged to have the London units of big
U.S. investment banks listed as underwriters. In earlier
deals when the New York units were the market makers, their
European affiliates lacked sufficient incentive to serve
investors who wanted to buy the bonds.</p>
<p>So far, Citicorp's efforts appear to have paid off.
Foreign investors bought 48% and 45%, respectively, of its
first two global bonds launched in May and June. The bank
also estimated that about 45% of the three-year offering last
week was sold abroad, despite the Mideast crisis and
weakening dollar. All three global offerings were registered
with the SEC and used a senior-subordinated structure.</p>
<p>The senior, $1.25 billion part of last week's issue had an
8 7/8% coupon, and was priced at 99.91 to yield 8.912%. The
$155 million of subordinated securities had a 9 1/8% coupon,
and were priced at 99.855 to yield 9.182%.</p>
<p>"We are confident in the structure. We are very pleased
with the liquidity," said Mr. Bur of Banque Nationale de
Paris, which is buying the new global bonds this year. As
does most corporate debt, the Citicorp paper yields more than
U.S. Treasury bonds: 0.63 percentage points for last week's
three-year issue, and a hefty 0.88 points for both the
five-year issue in May and seven-year offering in June.</p>
<p>Despite the extensive efforts to widen investor interest,
Citicorp's bonds still yield more -- roughly 0.3 percentage
point -- than those sold by other companies with triple-A
ratings. The bank believes this gap will narrow, as investors
become more familiar with the securities. But others are
doubtful. "These sort of bonds are quite complicated," Mr.
Bur said.</p>
<p>A fund manager at a London-based investment bank also is
skeptical. He predicted that new, stiffer capital-adequacy
ratios will prompt U.S. and European banks to flood the
market with securitized debt, and said: "The thing we most
like {about the Citicorp securities} is quite simple: They
look cheap."</p>
