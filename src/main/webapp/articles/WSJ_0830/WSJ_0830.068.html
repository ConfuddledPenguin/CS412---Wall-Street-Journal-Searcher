	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered
its ratings on Bank of New York Co.'s long-term debt and
commercial paper.
   The rating concern's action affects a total of $1.2
billion of securities.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Moody's downgraded Bank of New York senior debt to
single-A-3 from single-A-2, subordinated debt to Baa-1 from
single-A-3, preferred stock to single-A-3 from single-A2; and
commercial paper to prime-2 from prime-1.</p>
<p>Moody's said its move "primarily reflects the company's
exposure to highly leveraged transaction lending." It said
that "although these portfolios have exhibited only moderate
deterioration in asset quality, they nevertheless remain
substantial in relation to equity and reserves."</p>
<p>A Bank of New York spokesman said that the company regrets
Moody's decision but that it will work with the rating
concern to improve the ratings.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Bank of New York shares closed at $23.50, down 25 cents.</p>
