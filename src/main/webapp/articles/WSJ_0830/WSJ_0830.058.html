	<p class="article-leader">RIVERSIDE, Calif. -- Fleetwood Enterprises Inc., which
produces recreational vehicles and manufactured housing, said
its board authorized the purchase of an additional two
million, or 9%, of its 22 million common shares outstanding.
A previously authorized buy-back of two million shares has
been nearly completed at a cost of $34.6 million.
   Fleetwood also said net income for its first quarter ended
July 29 fell 31% to $10.8 million, or 48 cents a share, from
$15.6 million, or 68 cents a share, in the year-earlier
quarter, which ended July 30. Sales slipped 1% to $389.2
million from $394.9 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company blamed the earnings decline on lower
recreational-vehicle sales and a shift in buyers' preference
for lowerpriced products with narrower profit margins. Strong
sales of manufactured housing were more than offset by the
decline in recreational-vehicle sales, Fleetwood said.</p>
