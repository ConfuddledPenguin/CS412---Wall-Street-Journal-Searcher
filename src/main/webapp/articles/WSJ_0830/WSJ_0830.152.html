	<p class="article-leader">Egghead Inc. posted net income for its fiscal first
quarter ended July 21 of $2.1 million, or 13 cents a share,
continuing the company's improved performance.
   The profit included a gain of $569,000 on the sale of the
company's training center and a charge of $1 million for
reserves to cover actual and anticipated legal expenses. In
the year-ago period, Egghead had a loss of $5.2 million, or
32 cents a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Egghead, one of the nation's largest retailers of computer
software, had a loss of $12.1 million for 1990 despite a
rapid expansion; for the second half of the year, however,
the Issaquah, Wash., company had small but increasing
profits.</p>
<p>The improvements partially stem from the closure of
marginal stores and Egghead's heavier reliance on direct
sales to customers, which contributed 58% of Egghead's
revenue in the first quarter.</p>
<p>Egghead's sales grew 18% to $144.7 million, compared with
$122.3 million a year ago.</p>
