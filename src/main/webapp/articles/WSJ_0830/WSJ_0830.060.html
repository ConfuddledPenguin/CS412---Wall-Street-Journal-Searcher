	<p class="article-leader">In "Socialism Is Dead; Leviathan Lives" (editorial page,
July 18), James Buchanan correctly argues that centralized
management of economies has not worked and cannot work. He is
much less convincing in his argument that laissez-faire
economics has worked and can work.
   A free-market economy can indeed produce more goods, but
suppose it produces more than can be sold? According to
Presidents Herbert Hoover and Franklin Roosevelt,
"destructive," "excessive" and "cutthroat" competition was
the primary cause of the Great Depression, and both took
steps to restrict competition. Bernard Baruch, the leading
financier of his time, proposed in 1930 the creation of a
worldwide "Supreme Court of Business" to restrict
"overproduction."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Maybe they were wrong, but why do economists never
consider the possibility? In cutthroat competition,
"protectionism" is only an attempt to ensure job security,
and fully understandable. I assume Mr. Buchanan is familiar
with the benefits of protectionism -- unless he and his
colleagues are actively opposed to professorial tenure.</p>
