	<p class="article-leader">One simple gimmick helped "Look Who's Talking" become a
movie blockbuster last year: The flick's star, a baby,
"talked" throughout the movie in the voice of an adult actor,
Bruce Willis. Only the audience, the twist went, could hear
the baby speaking.
   Madison Avenue thought the gag was hot, too: The
"baby-talk" device is now showing up in ads for everything
from Kellogg's Eggo waffles to Burger King sandwiches. Baby
conversations have also made their way into ads for Scott's
Baby Fresh baby wipes, Fuji Photo film and even a maternity
ward at a hospital near Boston.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"When something happens in the movies that is a gimmick,
that insidious device spreads through television commercials
like the plague," says Roy Grace, chairman of ad agency Grace
& Rothschild. "There's always this terrible need for ideas.
Whenever one comes along that seems even somewhat fresh, it
has a magnetic quality."</p>
<p>In the Burger King spot, a baby boy and a baby girl sit in
highchairs at the fast-food joint munching on french fries.
"So what're you doing after this?" an adult voice says as the
boy waves his arm. "Let me think. Today's Tuesday. Tuesdays I
play peekaboo," his friend answers. The two chat about Burger
King food.</p>
<p>"So what did your Dad get?" the boy says, pointing.
"That's my Mom]" the girl screams. "Sorry, I still get those
mixed up," replies the boy.</p>
<p>Advertising executives say the slew of "baby-talk" ads is
just the latest example of advertisers borrowing ideas from
Hollywood. In their undying bid to find ads that will break
through the clutter and get noticed, advertisers often think
using an idea from a popular film will help get consumers in
their court.</p>
<p>A current Roy Rogers ad, for example, features music
resembling the theme from the movie "Jaws." Special effects
in the movie "Superman" have been mimicked by many
advertisers. And now, advertisers are using film directors
like Spike Lee and David Lynch to direct their commercials so
they have a cinematic feel. "Films are the parent of many
commercial ideas," says Robert Schmidt, chairman of ad agency
Levine, Huntley, Schmidt & Beaver.</p>
<p>To be sure, the idea of using babies in ads isn't new.
Advertising executives, armed with the hunch that babies have
a strong emotional pull on consumers, have cast babies in
starring roles in commercials for years, including those for
Michelin tires, Du Pont Stainmaster carpet and Angel Soft
toilet tissue. But the popularity of "Look Who's Talking,"
advertising executives say, has put a new spin on the old
baby-in-ad formula, letting the baby speak for himself.</p>
<p>Rich Swietek, a copywriter at Mintz & Hoke in Boston, says
he decided to tap the "baby-talk" idea because the agency's
client, Nashua Memorial Hospital's "Birth Place," needed a
warmer image.</p>
<p>"The advertising out there {for hospitals' maternity
wards} was pretty mundane, just the basic shot of the parent
and kid. We wanted to try and capture a human feeling in the
parents to try and appeal to their emotions," Mr. Swietek
says. "We decided the best testimonial would come from the
babies themselves."</p>
<p>One of Nashua Memorial's ads features a baby boy "talking"
about the maternity ward's private rooms and other amenities.
"Four months ago, I was born at the Birth Place at Nashua
Memorial Hospital," an actor says as a baby's cooing is heard
on the sound track. "The nurses were great . . . even the one
I sorta spit up on."</p>
<p>Despite the fact that "Look Who's Talking" is nearly a
year old -- it came out last October -- advertisers say the
concept is strong enough that people don't need to have seen
the movie for the ads to make sense.</p>
<p>A planned television series on ABC based on the movie,
called "Baby Talk," has been put on hold. But advertisers say
the ads couldn't be more timely: The original movie came out
on video earlier this year and the film's sequel, "Look Who's
Talking Too," will hit theaters in December. This time, Mr.
Willis will be joined by a couple of other famous voices
playing babies: Roseanne Barr and Richard Pryor.</p>

<p>Ad Notes. . . .</p>
<p>LIQUOR ACCOUNT: Jim Beam Brands Co., Deerfield, Ill.,
named Fallon McElligott, Minneapolis, to handle advertising
for a number of brands, including DeKuyper cordials and Old
Grand Dad bourbon. Billings total about $6 million on the
brands, which had been handled by Cramer-Krasselt and BBDO,
both of Chicago. Total Jim Beam billings at Fallon, which
already services the Jim Beam and Gibley's accounts, now
approach $14 million.</p>
<p>ASSIGNMENT: Warner-Lambert, Morris Plains, N.J., named WPP
Group's J. Walter Thompson in New York to handle ad
responsibilities for its new Medi-Flu product. Billings
weren't disclosed.</p>
<p>KOREAN SWITCH: Leo Burnett said it plans to drop a
three-year-old link with Korea's Dong Bang Advertising Co.
because of a client conflict with Procter & Gamble, a big
Burnett account. The Chicago-based agency instead is joining
forces with Allied Communications, a newly formed Korean ad
agency. Terms weren't disclosed.</p>
