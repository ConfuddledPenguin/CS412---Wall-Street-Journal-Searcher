	<p class="article-leader">Some folks think modern art is rubbish. Susan Pedicord, on
the other hand, thinks modern rubbish should be art.
   In an effort to improve the environment -- and perhaps
nurture budding Picassos -- Ms. Pedicord has opened a store
in Montpelier, Vt., to recycle trash as art supplies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Appropriately named "Restore," the shop offers everything
from discarded legal pads, partly used wallpaper rolls and
pillow stuffing to clothespin springs, red plastic bottle
caps and wood chips. Customers -- mostly artists, parents and
kids -- use the materials for such arts and crafts as
collages, sculptures, mobiles and toys. Teachers also load up
on supplies for use in art classes.</p>
<p>"Most of the materials are perfectly good. They have one
little scratch or wrinkle, and they're no longer useful to a
company," says Ms. Pedicord. An artist herself, she came up
with the idea for Restore three years ago after hoarding
leftover scraps from an art project.</p>
<p>Since then, she has persuaded 100 Vermont businesses to
channel their scraps to Restore instead of burdening
landfills. "Our environmental goal is to get waste out of the
waste stream," says Ms. Pedicord. She spends much of her time
driving from bottle makers to brush makers to quilt makers --
loading up her small pickup truck with their rubbish. And she
also approaches new companies, touring their facilities in
search of usable waste.</p>
<p>Vermont artists and kids love the store -- especially the
prices. On opening day this month, more than 200 people
showed up. At 10-for-a-penny, mailing labels and promotional
stickers were among the hot items. "Kids love stickers,"
explains Ms. Pedicord. But 1990 U.S. Census pencils were also
selling fast.</p>
<p>Restore, a unit of Restore Resources Unlimited, a
nonprofit, waste-reduction organization, soon will begin
exhibiting the work of local artists who've used discarded
materials in their pieces. "We wanted to give the art
community both access to inexpensive art materials and a new
place to exhibit their work," says Ms. Pedicord. In addition,
the retailer may sponsor recycled-art competitions at several
local schools.</p>
<p>Ms. Pedicord maintains that her store represents "the kind
of creative problem solving that will help solve the
environmental problems we're facing today." She doesn't
address, however, what happens when her customers throw away
their art projects.</p>
