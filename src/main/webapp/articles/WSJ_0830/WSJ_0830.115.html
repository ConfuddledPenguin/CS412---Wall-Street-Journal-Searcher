	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Ponce Federal Bank, one of the largest
thrifts in Puerto Rico, was hit with strong enforcement
measures by the Office of Thrift Supervision -- including an
order to change the locks on its doors.
   The measures, designed to "increase the bank's safety and
soundness," according to the OTS, include a temporary
cease-and-desist order issued against Ramiro L. Colon, former
chairman, president and chief executive officer and now a
stockholder, and his brother, Wendell W. Colon, former thrift
counsel and also a stockholder.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>According to the OTS, the Colons have been ordered to stop
causing the bank to violate federal regulations against loans
to affiliated parties and insider transactions, and to post a
$50,000 bond to make funds available for restitution to the
thrift.</p>
<p>The OTS order also calls for members of the thrift's board
and Ramiro Colon to pay $615,000 in restitution to Ponce
Federal.</p>
<p>Ponce Federal itself has been directed, among other
measures, to comply with OTS regulations dealing with loans
to affiliated parties and insider transactions; to stop any
direct employment-related payments to Ramiro Colon; and to
deny the Colons access to any of the institution's records or
files. Federal regulators also ordered the thrift to change
its locks and deny keys to the Colons.</p>
<p>Regulators noted that the measures don't affect the
thrift's daily operations or depositors' accounts, which
continue to be insured up to $100,000.</p>
<p>Thrift officials and Messrs. Colon weren't available for
comment.</p>
