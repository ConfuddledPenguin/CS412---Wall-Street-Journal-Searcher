	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- GATX Corp. said its aircraft-leasing joint
venture with France's Credit Lyonnais agreed to obtain $400
million in additional capital from new Japanese and U.S.
investors.
   The move will trim the two original partners' stake to 30%
each, GATX said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The new investors -- Mitsubishi Bank Ltd., Nichimen Corp.,
and Sanwa Bank Ltd. of Japan; and the Household Commercial
Financial Services unit of Household International Inc. --
each received a 10% interest in the venture, and committed to
invest $100 million apiece.</p>
<p>GATX and Credit Lyonnais began the aircraft-leasing
venture, known as GATX/CL Air, in 1988, with total funding of
$1 billion. The funds were used to acquire aircraft that are
leased to certain South American airlines, and for 20 Airbus
A320-200 jets to be delivered to other airlines over the next
several years.</p>
<p>GATX said it anticipates the new financing will be used to
acquire additional aircraft.</p>
<p>GATX has interests in railcar and aircraft leasing,
financial services, and bulk liquid terminal storage.</p>
