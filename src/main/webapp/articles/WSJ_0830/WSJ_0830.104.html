	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The government's principal economic
forecasting index was flat in July, another sign that the
economy was precarious even before turmoil in the Middle East
jarred American consumers and businesses.
   The flat reading of the index of leading indicators, a
collection of 11 sets of economic statistics that are
supposed to foreshadow economic activity six to nine months
in advance, followed a 0.1% rise in June and a 0.6% increase
in May. Those figures marked slight revisions from last month
when, based on preliminary data, the department calculated
that the index was unchanged in June and rose 0.7% in May.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Only three of the 11 indicators made positive
contributions to the index last month: orders for new plant
and equipment, raw materials prices and an index of consumer
confidence all rose. The other eight -- including stock
prices, unemployment claims, factory orders and building
permits -- held the index down.</p>
<p>The leading indicators are the latest in a string of
statistics that suggest the economy was in a weak position by
July. Mounting evidence of this has increased fears the
economy won't be able to survive the higher oil prices
prompted by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait without sinking
into a recession.</p>
<p>"While these figures indicate that the economy was already
sluggish prior to the Middle East crisis, they do not point
to the emergence of a recession. Since this time, however,
the sharp rise in world oil prices has made a downturn almost
inevitable," said Gordon Richards, an economist for the
National Association of Manufacturers.</p>
<p>Private surveys are showing that consumer confidence
tumbled in August, suggesting that people may curb
discretionary spending in the face of economic uncertainty.
That alone, some analysts fear, could tip the economy into
recession.</p>
<p>Besides worries over oil prices, the country also faces
the prospect of an auto strike later this year. If that
happened, the resulting plunge in car production would almost
certainly spell recession.</p>
<p>"I think we're right on the edge," said Stuart Hoffman,
chief economist at PNC Financial Corp. in Pittsburgh. "I
really don't see any growth at all in the fourth quarter."</p>
<p>But some economists don't think a downturn is inevitable.
"It's unclear how much shock this is to the economy," said
John McAuley, an economist at R.H. Wrightson & Associates, an
economic consulting firm in New York. He expects continued
slow growth.</p>
<p>Three consecutive declines in the leading indicators are
supposed to signal a recession, though the index is notorious
for predicting downturns that never occur. After the October
1987 stock market crash, for example, the leading indicators
fell for five straight months, but the economy continued to
grow at a healthy rate.</p>
<p>In a separate report, the Commerce Department said sales
of new single-family homes dropped 2.3% in July following a
4.6% increase in June, which was revised from an earlier
estimate of an 8% increase. Sales fell in the Northeast and
the West but rose slightly in the Midwest. They were flat in
the South.</p>
<p>Nationwide, the average price of a new home fell to
$150,500 in July from $152,100 in June. The median price
dropped to $121,000 from $127,000.</p>
<p>The home-sales figures are based on incomplete data and
are often revised substantially.</p>
<p>The numbers in both reports were adjusted for regular
seasonal fluctuations.</p>

<p>                 LEADING INDICATORS</p>
<p>Here are the net contributions of the components of the
Commerce Department's index of leading indicators. After
various adjustments, they produced an unchanged index for
July and a .01% increase for June.</p>

<p>Index of coincident indicators ...... 134.6    -.2</p>
<p>Index of lagging indicators ......... 119.7     .6</p>
<p>The ratio of coincident to lagging indicators was 1.12,
down from 1.13 in the previous month.</p>
