	<p class="article-leader">BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- Litton Industries Inc. announced
a 2.5 million-share expansion of its buy-back program and a
proposed $1 billion note offering, and posted a 2.3% decline
in net income for its fourth quarter ended July 31.
   The diversified technology concern's profit fell to $45.5
million, or $1.91 a share, from $46.6 million, or $1.86 a
share, in the year-earlier fiscal fourth quarter. The
per-share profit rise reflected a 5% shrinkage in shares
outstanding from Litton's continuing repurchase program.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales rose 6.8% to $1.41 billion from $1.32 billion.</p>
<p>The company said its Advanced Electronics segment has been
hurt by the effects of a tightening defense budget. Operating
profit in the segment fell 17%, largely reflecting a slowdown
in military demand for spare parts and other equipment in
Litton's fiscal fourth period.</p>
<p>Improved results in Litton's Resource Exploration Services
business were largely offset by weakness in the Industrial
Automation Systems business, which has been hurt by delays in
the start of new engine programs by U.S. auto makers, the
company said.</p>
<p>Litton's oil-services subsidiary "has experienced
accelerating revenues and profits over the past two years in
a recovering energy market," said Orion L. Hoch, Litton
chairman, who characterized the unit as "an especially
promising growth business for Litton." The company's
shipbuilding segment also reported higher earnings and sales.</p>
<p>Litton said it expects to raise about $265 million from
its proposed offering of $1 billion face amount at maturity
of zero-coupon bonds, due 2010. The bonds, which are called
liquid yield option notes, are expected to pay a yield of
6.75% to maturity and to be convertible, at Litton's option,
into common stock or cash.</p>
<p>Litton said proceeds will be used to retire $440 million
of floating-rate subordinated notes. The current rate is
about 9.625%. "The transaction will reduce our interest
expense and improve our cash flow," Mr. Hoch said. Merrill
Lynch Capital Markets, a unit of Merrill Lynch & Co., is the
underwriter.</p>
<p>Litton said the boost in its stock buy-back program brings
to about three million the number of its shares the company
now is authorized to purchase. As of July 31, Litton had 22.4
million common shares outstanding. Litton said it bought back
nearly 2.2 million shares in the latest fiscal year ended
July 31.</p>
<p>Investors reacted favorably to the announcements. Litton
shares rose $1 to close at $75.75 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading yesterday.</p>
<p>"Investors are recognizing that Litton has the ability to
grow earnings per share, even in a difficult economic
environment," Howard Rubel, an analyst at C.J. Lawrence,
Morgan Grenfell Inc., said. "The earnings weren't bad, even
though the company has some defense exposure." Mr. Rubel
expects Litton to earn $7.50 a share in fiscal 1991.</p>
<p>For fiscal 1990, Litton's net edged up less than 1% to
$178.8 million, or $7.26 a share, from $178.3 million, or
$7.05 a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 2.7% to $5.16
billion from $5.02 billion.</p>
