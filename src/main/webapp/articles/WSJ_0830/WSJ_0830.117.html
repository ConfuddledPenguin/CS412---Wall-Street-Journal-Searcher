	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Bank of Montreal, one of Canada's major
commercial banks, cut its prime lending rate to 14% from
14.25% effective today.
   Canada's other commercial banks didn't immediately follow
Bank of Montreal's move.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Lloyd Atkinson, Bank of Montreal chief economist, said a
lower prime rate was appropriate because of "the stability of
the Canadian dollar combined with evidence of weak economic
activity."</p>
<p>Bank of Montreal last adjusted its prime rate Aug. 14 when
it lowered the rate one-half percentage point to 14.25%.
Canada's other commercial banks lowered their prime rates
later in the week.</p>
