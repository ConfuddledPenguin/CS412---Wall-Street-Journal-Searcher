	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Bond prices rallied yesterday, boosted by
strong bidding at the Treasury's five-year note auction and
signs of less tension in the Mideast.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year note ended nearly 1 1/4
points higher, a gain of nearly $12.50 for a bond with a
$1,000 face amount. The issue's yield, which moves in the
opposite direction of its price, eased to 8.92% from 9.04% on
Tuesday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Bond prices opened modestly higher on news that the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to raise
output levels. But a late-day rally in the Treasury futures
pit at the Chicago Board of Trade spilled over into the cash
market and pushed bond prices sharply higher.</p>
<p>The futures market rally was sparked by the release of the
government's five-year note auction results, which were
better than some analysts had expected.</p>
<p>The $8.56 billion of five-year, two-month notes fetched an
average yield of 8.57%. The yield was up from 8.54% at the
previous 5-year, 2-month note auction May 24 and was the
highest average yield at an auction since May 25, 1989, when
the average yield was 8.72%. In when-issued trading activity,
the yield on the five-year notes fell to 8.5%.</p>
<p>The bid-to-cover ratio, which measures the number of bids
the Treasury receives for each bid it accepts, was a hefty
3.10-to-1, compared with 2.53-to-1 at the last five-year
auction.</p>
<p>Noncompetitive bids, a gauge of individual investor
interest, were $672 million. That was up from $593 million at
the pervious five-year auction in May and the highest since
$696 million at the February 1989 five-year note auction.</p>
<p>Those results seemed to indicate investors were warming
somewhat to fixed-income securities after weeks of sitting
frozen by fear of what the Middle East crisis would do to oil
prices and inflation.</p>
<p>And news from and about the Mideast standoff suggested
conciliation was more a possibility than had been perceived.</p>
<p>The Iraqi ambassador to the U.S. told reporters Iraq would
release all male foreigners, as well as women and children,
if the U.S. would assure it wouldn't attack Iraq.</p>
<p>And an article in Newsday said that a purported
intermediary for Iraq made a secret offer to evacuate Kuwait
if it received guaranteed access to the Persian Gulf and
control of an oil field that dips into Kuwait, among other
conditions.</p>
<p>Later in the day, the White House dismissed the proposal
and said it hadn't had any direct dealings with Iraq.</p>
<p>"There were elements of constructiveness in the air and a
sense that investors don't have to build in a worst-case
scenario," said Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko
Securities Co. International Inc., New York.</p>
<p>Fixed-income securities also were helped by the drop in
oil prices, which reflected the OPEC announcement. OPEC
nations, with Iran dissenting, agreed to boost production to
help make up for the embargo against crude from Iraq and
occupied Kuwait.</p>
<p>The announcement sent oil prices tumbling. At the New York
Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for October delivery settled
at $25.92, down $1.96 from Tuesday.</p>
<p>A drop in the Commodity Research Bureau's futures index
was also constructive to market tone. The CRB index settled
at 234.71, down 3.66 on the day, reflecting widespread price
declines in futures markets.</p>
<p>Analysts said soybeans, corn and wheat futures all took a
tumble, as did orange juice, sugar, coffee and cocoa futures.
The grain futures led the declines, with some corn contracts
hitting life-of-contract lows.</p>
<p>On the economic calendar for today is the weekly release
of initial unemployment claims at 8:30 a.m. EDT and the
release of July factory orders at 10 a.m. EDT.</p>
<p>A Dow Jones Capital Markets Report consensus of economists
looks for an increase of 1.5% in factory orders after a 1.5%
decline in June.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>Treasury securities ended higher yesterday, after a rally
in the Treasury futures market spilled over into the cash
market.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 98 5/32 to
yield 8.92% compared with 96 30/32 to yield 9.04% on Tuesday.
The latest 10-year notes ended at 99 18/32 to yield 8.80%
compared with 98 26/32 to yield 8.91%.</p>
<p>Short-term rates eased slightly yesterday. The discount
rate on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.47% for a
bond-equivalent yield of 7.70% while the rate on six-month
Treasury bills fell to 7.44% for a bond-equivalent yield of
7.82%.</p>
<p>Here are details of yesterday's five-year, two-month note
auction:</p>
<p>Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.</p>
<p>Applications ..........................  $26,344,530,000</p>
<p>Accepted bids .........................   $8,560,716,000</p>
<p>Accepted at low price .................              20%</p>
<p>Accepted noncompetitively .............     $672,000,000</p>
<p>Average price (Rate) ..................   99.644 (8.57%)</p>
<p>High price (Rate) .....................   99.685 (8.56%)</p>
<p>Low price (Rate) ......................   99.603 (8.58%)</p>
<p>Interest rate .........................           8 1/2%</p>
<p>The notes are dated Sept. 4, 1990, and mature Nov. 15,
1995.</p>
<p>Corporate Bonds</p>
<p>Junk bonds ambled along in another day of uninspiring
summer trading.</p>
<p>Prices of most go-go bonds, or top-quality, liquid
high-yield names, ended the session slightly higher, but junk
bonds from retailers and other cyclical issuers continued to
come under heavy selling pressure.</p>
<p>Hard hit were junk bonds of R.H. Macy & Co. and Carter
Hawley Hale Stores Inc. Macy's 14.50% senior subordinated
debentures slipped two points to 59 while the retailer's
14.50% subordinated debentures also slumped two points to end
at 46.</p>
<p>Carter Hawley's 12.50% senior subordinated debentures slid
two points to 69 while the company's 12.25% senior
subordinated notes shed 1 1/2 points to end at 74.</p>
<p>With recession looming, investors have been selling junk
bonds of retailers on fears that profits will be squeezed in
an economic downturn.</p>
<p>Some other cyclical bonds that were hammered in
yesterday's trading: National Gypsum Co.'s 11.375% senior
subordinated notes, which fell two points to an offered price
of 43. Bids for the company's 14.50% senior subordinated
debentures tumbled four points to 36.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered the debt
ratings of National Gypsum because the decline in demand for
gypsum wallboard prices will continue to erode the company's
already skimpy interest coverage.</p>
<p>In the investment-grade corporate debt market, high-grade
corporate bonds posted gains with long-term bonds advancing
as much as 3/4 point.</p>
<p>Municipal Securities</p>
<p>Municipal bond prices perked up after the doldrums of
recent weeks and wrapped up the calm session with gains of
1/4 to 1 1/2 points.</p>
<p>New deals that came to the market this session were well
received, traders said.</p>
<p>The top attraction was Puerto Rico's $350 million Public
Improvement Bonds of 1990.</p>
<p>The general obligation bonds were priced by a Goldman,
Sachs & Co. group to yield from 6.15% in 1991 to 7.735% in
2020.</p>
<p>In secondary dealings, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% issues of 2018 ended 1 1/2 points higher at 98 1/2,
pushing the yield down to 7.31% from 7.44% at Tuesday's
close.</p>
<p>Mortgage- & Asset-Backed Securities</p>
<p>The asset-backed securities market reached another
milestone as nearly $26 billion of asset-backed issues have
been sold so far this year, exceeding the $24 billion sold in
all of 1989. This month alone, nearly $4 billion of
asset-backed securities have been issued.</p>
<p>"We really expect asset-backed issuance to remain heavy,"
said Bruce Mahood, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &
Co.</p>
<p>That's because issuers, especially banks, continue to step
up their sales while investors avidly seek the high-rated
securities that offer yields generally 0.55 to 0.90
percentage point higher than short-term Treasurys.</p>
<p>With total issuance of $14 billion, sales of credit-card
securities dominate this year's asset-backed market and the
trend is expected to persist.</p>
<p>But issuance of securities backed by auto loans may
slacken due to slow auto sales. Some automakers "aren't in
the market because their auto-loan portfolio has not grown
that spectacularly," said Michael Bassett, vice president at
Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J.</p>
<p>There are just two forthcoming asset-backed deals now
being mentioned repeatedly -- both credit-card issues. One is
a $300 million offering by Valley National Bank via J.P.
Morgan. Valley National is a unit of Phoenix, Ariz.-based
Valley National Corp. The other issue is $500 million Signet
Banking Corp. via Goldman, Sachs & Co. Signet is based in
Richmond, Va.</p>
<p>Another name being bandied about is Baltimore-based MNC
Financial Inc., which is seen selling about $500 million of
credit-card securities later this quarter or early next
quarter.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>The Japanese bond market eroded further on continued talk
of an imminent hike in the official discount rate and a
weaker yen.</p>
<p>Two Japanese national newspapers reported yesterday that
the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance were
negotiating a discount rate hike. The reports, which were
denied by government officials, said the discount rate could
be raised as much as one full point as early as the beginning
of September. The rate, which is what the central bank
charges member banks for loans, now is 5.25%.</p>
<p>Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno denied that the
central bank and the Finance Ministry were negotiating
another rate increase, but emphasized that the rise in the
price of oil was a new factor that the central bank was
carefully watching.</p>
<p>Despite Mr. Mieno's denial, many dealers and analysts
believe there will be a discount rate increase by October.</p>
<p>"I think they will hike the discount rate," says a dealer
at a major Japanese commercial bank. "They only have
September to do it in. If they don't {do it in September}
they will have missed the right time. . . . I think they are
deciding the scheduling."</p>
<p>At the close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the benchmark
No. 119 10-year government bond was quoted at a price of
82.18, down 0.55 point on the day, to yield 8.31%. (Foreign
bond yields are quoted here in local terms and therefore
differ somewhat from yields calculated for these markets by
U.S. investment firms, which tend to use the semiannual
compound measure to compare yields across markets. Using that
method, the yield on Japan's No. 119 bond ended at 7.61%,
according to Salomon Brothers Inc.)</p>
<p>The discount rate was last raised in late March by a full
percentage point to 5.25%.</p>
<p>In other markets:</p>
<p>-- West German bond prices ended on a firmer tone despite
being faced with as much as 10 billion marks ($6.43 billion)
of fresh supply due for pricing in the next week.</p>
<p>-- British government bonds ended little changed.</p>
