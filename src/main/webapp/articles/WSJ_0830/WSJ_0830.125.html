	<p class="article-leader">Interphase Corp. said it will take a charge of $2.8
million, or 85 cents a share, against third-quarter earnings
after writing off its investment in Omni Solutions Inc.
   The Dallas maker of microcomputer products said profit
posted in its core business during the period was not enough
to offset the charge, and the company expects to post a loss
for the quarter ended July 31.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A year after acquiring its majority interest in Omni, a
computer components maker, Interphase said it decided to
write off the investment because of high start-up costs and
"significant delays" in Omni's product development. Effective
Sept. 1, Omni will cease to exist as an independent company,
and Interphase will provide customer support for Omni's
products in the marketplace, the company said.</p>
<p>"Since we will no longer be incurring losses associated
with Omni operations, we expect to report a profit for the
fourth quarter," said Michael E. Cope, Interphase president.</p>
<p>For the six months ended April 30, Interphase posted a
loss of $1.2 million, or 37 cents a share, on revenue of
$12.4 million.</p>
