	<p class="article-leader">DOMINGUEZ, Calif. -- Pic `N' Save Corp. said it will
report a loss for its fiscal second quarter and six months
due mainly to charges and costs related to its recent proxy
contest and restructuring.
   Pic `N' Save recently forestalled a threatened proxy fight
with Girard Partners L.P. and investor David Batchelder by
agreeing to put Mr. Batchelder and two associates on the
board, widening a planned stock buy-back and lifting certain
anti-takeover measures.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Pic 'N' Save, which operates a chain of retail stores
specializing in close-out merchandise, didn't specify the
amount of the costs, charges or losses, nor did it comment on
operating results.</p>
<p>The company said the charges include a $1.6 million
after-tax severance package for Lewis B. Merrifield III,
president and chief executive officer, who has resigned
effective Jan. 1, and $1.7 million that Pic 'N' Save agreed
to pay Girard Partners as reimbursement for proxy-fight
expenses.</p>
<p>In the quarter ended July 2, 1989, Pic 'N' Save had net
income of $6.4 million, or 18 cents a share, on sales of
$101.8 million. In last year's first half, the company had
net income of $11.8 million, or 33 cents a share, on sales of
$195.9 million.</p>
<p>Pic 'N' Save said it believes that after the 1990 second
quarter it will have recognized all expenses and
extraordinary items from the proxy fight and restructuring
except for interest and other expenses related to additional
stock repurchases.</p>
<p>"We are confident that with the distraction and disruption
of the proxy contest behind us and the programs we have
recently put in place, we should be profitable for the
remainder of the year," Mr. Merrifield told the annual
meeting yesterday. The company also expects to be profitable
for the full year, a spokesman said.</p>
