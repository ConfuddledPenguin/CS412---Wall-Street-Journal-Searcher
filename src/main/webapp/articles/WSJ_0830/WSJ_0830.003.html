	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Investors bid bond and stock prices higher as
oil prices tumbled on news that OPEC agreed to boost output.
Also, market-buoying rumors circulated that Iraq had a plan
for leaving Kuwait.
   The October futures contract for light crude oil fell
$1.96 to $25.92, the lowest level in nearly three weeks. The
Dow Jones Industrial Average, which stayed in a narrow range
early in the session, gained 17.58 points to 2632.43 in
sluggish trading.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Long-term Treasury bond prices added 1 1/4 points, or
$12.50 for each $1,000 face amount, also in light activity.
The dollar ended mixed in an equally quiet currency market,
with traders slimming their holdings in advance of the long
weekend and U.S. economic data due out next week.</p>
<p>Much of the initial impetus for rising stock and bond
prices came from Vienna, where 10 of the 13 members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to
produce more oil to offset most of the supply loss from Iraq
and Kuwait.</p>
<p>As for unsubstantiated reports that Iraq was preparing a
specific plan for ending its occupation of Kuwait, "It's hard
to say whether there's any validity" to them, said Robert
Farrell, chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch. But they
"caused bonds to rally and stocks followed," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Farrell noted the stocks' rise was powered by the same
issues that led the Dow industrials to nearly 3000 -- drug,
health-care stocks and other shares of companies with strong
profit growth.</p>
<p>The bond market drew additional strength from a successful
auction of fiveyear U.S. Treasury notes. Bidding was
unusually strong among individual investors, said Raymond
Stone, managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research
Associates.</p>
<p>In currency markets, much of the action again was focused
on the yen. A rumor that Japan's central bank was poised to
boost a key interest rate continued to bolster the yen, said
Yoichi Sakaguchi, chief currency trader at Sanwa Bank.</p>
<p>In major market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices rose on volume of 134.2 million shares on the
New York Stock Exchange, where advancing issues outnumbered
decliners, 972 to 508.</p>
<p>Bond prices jumped. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond fell to 8.92%.</p>
<p>The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency rose to 1.5595 marks from 1.5563 late Tuesday, and
fell to 143.60 yen from 143.73.</p>
