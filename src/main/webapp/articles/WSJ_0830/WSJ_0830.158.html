	<p class="article-leader">Syntex Corp. fiscal fourth-quarter net income rose 49% to
$75.1 million, reflecting generally strong demand for its
most profitable products and the performance of four
prescription drugs introduced in the U.S. this year.
   In the period ended July 31, the Palo Alto, Calif.,
company had per-share net of 67 cents a share, compared with
46 cents a share in the year-earlier period. Profit a year
ago totaled $50.4 million. Revenue gained 24% to $397.3
million from $321.1 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Syntex said the profit gain also reflected expense
controls. The four drugs Syntex introduced this year are
Toradol, Synarel, Cardene and Cytoven.</p>
<p>In the year, net grew 13% to $341.5 million, or $3.05 a
share, up from $303.2 million, or $2.67 a share. Revenue was
