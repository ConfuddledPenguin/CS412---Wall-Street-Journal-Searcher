	<p class="article-leader">Riggs National Corp., Washington, D.C., said it intends to
execute an option to sell back at least $655 million in
assets from the National Bank of Washington to the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp., the receiver for the failed bank.
   A Riggs unit bought the loans earlier this month when
federal regulators declared the National Bank of Washington
insolvent and closed it. The National Bank of Washington was
a unit of Washington Bancorp., which filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection from creditors Aug. 1.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Riggs, a bank holding company, said it may opt to sell
back to the FDIC up to $95 million more in acquired loans.</p>
