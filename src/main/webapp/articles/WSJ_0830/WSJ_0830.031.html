	<p class="article-leader">GOOD NEWS FOR FRENCH BUSINESS</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>To help counteract the negative economic effects of the
Mideast crisis, France's government is preparing some
unexpected good news for businessmen and consumers: Lower
taxes next year.</p>
<p>Officials said they also are planning deeper than expected
cuts in government spending next year, in an effort to
curtail the expected inflationary effects of higher oil
prices. The plans are part of the preparation of the 1991
budget, which will be presented to Parliament in the fall.</p>
<p>The planned cuts in business taxes are likely to anger
many Socialist members of Parliament, who generally support
the government but consider Socialist Prime Minister Michel
Rocard too pro-business. The cuts likely also will be
criticized by the right-wing opposition, which generally
considers the Socialist government's tax and spending cuts
too small.</p>
<p>Under the plan, taxes on reinvested business profits are
to be cut to 34%, from 37% currently. An earlier plan called
for them to fall no lower than 35%.</p>
<p>ALBANIAN DENIAL</p>
<p>Albania denied it is building a wall around foreign
embassies in its capital, Tirana, in order to restrict access
to them. The official ATA news agency said that "at the
request of some embassies themselves some adjustments of the
walls and their lattices are being made." It didn't name the
embassies. About 5,000 Albanians climbed over embassy walls
last month to gain access to foreign missions in a bid to
emigrate. They eventually were allowed to leave Albania.

<p>BHOPAL ARGUMENTS END</p>
<p>India's Supreme Court finished hearing arguments yesterday
on overturning last year's $470 million settlement between
the government and Union Carbide Corp. for the 1984 Bhopal
gas disaster. The five-judge panel reserved judgment on the
case, United News of India reported. No date was set for
pronouncement. The settlement between the government of
previous Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and the U.S. company was
ordered by the Supreme Court in February 1989 during the
hearing of a $3 billion suit filed against Union Carbide.
Victims' groups and the current government appealed against
the settlement earlier this year, saying it was too meager.</p>
<p>CZECHOSLOVAK BREAKTHROUGH</p>
<p>Czechoslovak police have trained dogs to sniff out
Czech-made Semtex explosive, once a nearly undetectable
weapon of terrorists. Prague's daily Mlada Fronta said
trained German shepherd dogs can find the plastic explosive
hidden in a building, car, luggage or on a person. Training
the dogs to sniff out Semtex takes three months, the
Communist Party paper Rude Pravo reported.</p>
<p>EUROPE'S IMPERILED FORESTS</p>
<p>Air pollution is taking a toll on Europe's forests, the
United Nations Economic Commission for Europe reported. The
survey covered 286 million acres in 26 nations, representing
two-thirds of Europe's forest area. Spruce, fir and oak trees
over 60 years old were the worst hit. Over 15% of all spruces
in this age group in 15 countries were suffering moderate to
severe defoliation, as were the same percentage of oaks in 15
countries and of firs in seven countries, the report said.</p>
<p>NEW HOTEL FOR BEIJING</p>
<p>Japan's Sapporo Breweries Ltd. and partners will open a
hotel in Beijing to coincide with the Asian Games to be held
in the Chinese capital in September, a company spokesman
said. The first eight floors of the 13-story Beijing Rainbow
Hotel will be opened to guests from Sept. 17, the spokesman
said. Sapporo has a 60% stake in the hotel, Beijing Tourism
Corp. has a 35% stake, and the remainder is owned by the
Japanese trading house Tokyo Maruichi Shoji Co.</p>
<p>EAST GERMAN SPORT STRUGGLE</p>
<p>East Germany's training system for swimmers, the most
successful in the world, is close to going under, an official
of the sport's federation said.</p>
<p>After years of close attention and lavish financing,
swimmers face mounting problems in training, medical care and
other areas because money has dried up. "The most successful
swimming country is disappearing," a federation official
lamented. "People are going to other jobs or abroad, years of
experience is just flowing away."</p>
<p>The official said "considerable parts of our swimming
structure are already broken," including the system for
selecting youngsters, cultivating them in training centers
and allocating clubs. "The structures are cracking right down
to sports medical care," he said.</p>
<p>West Germany's swimming federation has agreed to merge
with its East German counterpart. That decision sparked
protests among West German swimmers who fear they will lose
their places on the team to more powerful competitors.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's new press spokesman
promised at his first news conference yesterday to play no
favorites with the official Soviet media or Western
journalists. Vitaly Ignatenko said: "We will have equal
relations with all journalists. We will not be hiding, we
will be open." . . . Bermuda voters elected to retain the
death penalty. Nearly 11,000 people turned out to vote in the
island's first national referendum, and almost 79% voted to
retain capital punishment for premeditated murder.</p>
