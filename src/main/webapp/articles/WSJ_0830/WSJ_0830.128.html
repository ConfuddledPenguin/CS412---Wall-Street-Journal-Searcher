	<p class="article-leader">National Intergroup Inc. improved the terms of a tender
offer for the cumulative convertible preference units
outstanding representing limited partnership interests of
Permian Partners L.P.
   Pittsburgh-based National Intergroup still will pay $3.85
a preference unit. But it agreed to extend the term of
accompanying contingent value rights to June 30, 1993, from
June 30, 1992, and to increase the possible payout under
those rights.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The rights would allow the holders to share in the
proceeds in excess of the cash they had already received in
the event that the Permian partnership is sold within a
specified time period. Under the new terms, holders would
receive 100% of the amount of the excess proceeds during the
entire life of the rights, instead of a graduated scale
dropping to 50% after June 1, 1992.</p>
<p>National Intergroup said earlier this week that only
5,535,680 preference units had been tendered as of Aug. 27,
well below the 7,875,001 units, a majority of the publicly
held units, that National Intergroup had specified as the
minimum required to make the offer effective.</p>
<p>National Intergroup is primarily a drug wholesaler but it
also has interests in metals, general merchandising and oil
production. Directors recently agreed to consider sale of the
firm's drug unit, FoxMeyer Corp., or of the entire company.</p>
