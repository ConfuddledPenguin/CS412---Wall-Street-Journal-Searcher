	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. named Fox
Inc. president Jonathan Dolgen to the new post of president
of the Columbia Pictures film studio.
   The appointment marks a return to Columbia for Mr. Dolgen,
who first joined the old Columbia Pictures Industries Inc. in
1976 and rose to president of domestic operations in 1983,
before quitting in 1985 to join Fox, a unit of News Corp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Dolgen, 45 years old, will be president of the
Columbia Pictures film division and will report to Frank
Price, chairman of the studio. He will oversee daily
operations for Columbia, which operates separately from the
parent company's other production units, including Tri-Star
Pictures and a television production arm.</p>
<p>At Fox, a replacement for Mr. Dolgen hasn't been named.
Mr. Dolgen had been president of Fox Inc., which owns the Fox
television network, since 1988 and a year ago took on the
additional title of president of Fox's television-production
unit, Twentieth Television, which makes such series as "L.A.
Law"</p>
<p>Although Mr. Dolgen will report to Frank Price, Columbia's
studio chairman, he also will have other corporate
responsibilities that will have him reporting directly to
Peter Guber and Jon Peters, the co-chairmen of Columbia
Pictures Entertainment, which was recently acquired by Sony
Corp.</p>
<p>"I'm going to work with Frank and my other friends at
Columbia Pictures, and I'm going to work with Jon and Peter
to deal with issues they think are suited to my skills," Mr.
Dolgen said in an interview.</p>
