	<p class="article-leader">MILAN -- Italian financial ministers agreed to freeze
prices of petroleum products in Italy for three months, to
fight the inflationary impact of the oil crisis.
   Treasury Minister Guido Carli, Finance Minister Rino
Fomica and Budget Minister Paolo Cirino Pomicino will ask the
cabinet tomorrow to approve a price freeze that would go into
effect between September and November.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Because Italian gasoline prices include a hefty tax, the
decree to be passed by the government tomorrow will entail
reducing that tax in order to accommodate the higher market
price but keep the price at the pump the same.</p>
<p>The move will cost the government about 800 billion lire
($697.5 million) to 900 billion lire this year, according to
government estimates.</p>
