	<p class="article-leader">Reynolds Metals Co. said it will introduce a non-stick
microwave wrap.
   The Richmond, Va., aluminum company said the product,
which will be in stores in the Midwest next week, will be the
first paper food-wrap designed exclusively for microwave use.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Microwave cooking typically uses paper towels or waxed
paper, which tend to rip easily, or plastic wraps, which tend
to sag and stick to dishes and food in the microwave.</p>
<p>First Brands Inc. came out with Glad Microwave Wrap, a
plastic-based wrap, but when it sagged under the oven's heat,
so did its sales.</p>
<p>Reynolds says its product, a result of six years of
research, won't sag, tear, pick up grease or stick to food
and containers. "You can even cook cheese on it," says John
M. Lowrie, vice president of the company's consumer products
unit.</p>
<p>Mr. Lowrie said the product, which will look like freezer
paper and have a coating of fatty acid, will be available
nationwide within a year. He predicts the wrap will have
sales of $20 million in its first year.</p>
