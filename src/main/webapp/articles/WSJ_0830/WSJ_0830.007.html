	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Laura Ashley Holdings PLC agreed to sell a 15%
stake to Japanese chain-store operator Jusco Co. in an effort
to lighten the troubled British company's debt load and
expand in Asia.
   Under the agreement, subject to shareholder approval,
Jusco would pay #29.9 million ($58.1 million) for 35.2
million new Laura Ashley shares. The per-share price of 85
pence is 73% above Laura Ashley's trading level of 49 pence
late Tuesday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In addition, Laura Ashley said it would sell more than
half the equity in its wholly owned U.S. subsidiary, Revman
Industries Inc. Jusco would acquire about 48% of the equity,
with Revman's management taking as much as 5% more. The
transaction, which values all of Revman at about $35 million,
will make Revman an associated company of Laura Ashley and
remove its roughly $27 million in borrowings from the parent
company's balance sheet.</p>
<p>For Laura Ashley, the Jusco deal offers "room to maneuver,
and steps up the pace in the Far East," said Nick Bubb, a
London-based analyst at Morgan Stanley. But, he said, until
Laura Ashley shifts from costly U.K. factories to less-costly
Asian sources, "I'm reluctant to say they've turned the
corner."</p>
<p>Jusco and Laura Ashley already have a retail joint
venture, Laura Ashley Japan Co. Under yesterday's agreement,
Jusco will boost its stake in the venture to 60% from 50%,
although Laura Ashley is to retain control of its brand name
and receive increased royalties.</p>
<p>Laura Ashley home furnishings, in particular, are
increasingly popular in Japan, said Sir Bernard Ashley,
chairman and co-founder. "We have tremendous opportunities
there, and this will unlock them," he said. Sir Bernard
characterized Jusco as a "friendly, passive investor taking a
long-term view." Yesterday's agreement stipulates that Jusco
can't raise or lower its 15% share of Laura Ashley's enlarged
share capital without approval from the company's board.</p>
<p>The Ashley family's stake in the company would be diluted
to 59.2% from 69.7% currently. That holding could fall to
54.2%, as the family has agreed to give Jusco a right of
first refusal to buy an additional 5% stake at a price to be
agreed on later. Sir Bernard said his family isn't
necessarily committed to retaining a majority holding in the
company, although he doesn't envisage relinquishing control
"in the immediate future."</p>
<p>In a statement, Jusco's chairman and chief executive
officer, Takuya Okada, said the arrangements would "enhance
the global presence of both groups" and "contribute to the
improvement of Laura Ashley's financial position." Jusco,
which operates more than 450 retail outlets in Japan, had
pretax profit of 39.4 billion yen ($274.2 million) on sales
of 1.35 trillion yen in the year ended Feb. 20.</p>
