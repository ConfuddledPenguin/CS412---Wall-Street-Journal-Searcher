	<p class="article-leader">LAKEWOOD, Colo. -- Plains Petroleum Co. said it reached an
agreement with KN Energy Inc., the purchaser of about 85% of
its natural gas production, for wellhead prices to be charged
under base contracts for 1991.
   With this new agreement, Plains estimates that 1991 gas
volumes sold will increase by about 17.5% and that revenue
received from its principal purchaser will increase 12.5%
from its current 1990 forecast of about $33 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Plains said the annually renegotiated price will vary for
1991 from a high of $1.95 per million British thermal units
for sales made in the high-demand season in the winter and
late fall to $1.65 per million BTUs in the low-demand season.
Assuming normal weather, the expected average price for 1991
for the base contracts is $1.8 million BTUs, or about 2% less
than the current-year price of $1.84 million BTUs.</p>
<p>Plains Petroleum is an oil and gas company. KN Energy,
also based in Lakewood, Colo., is a diversified energy
company.</p>
