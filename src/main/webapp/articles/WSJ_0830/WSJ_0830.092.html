	<p class="article-leader">KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Kansas City Power & Light Co. urged
Kansas Gas & Electric Co. to meet with its officials before
entering talks with any other potential buyers.
   Kansas City P&L last month launched an unsolicited
$27-a-share, or $857 million, tender offer for the Wichita
utility. But Kansas G&E rebuffed the offer as inadequate and
overly conditional, saying also that the bid "raises
substantial and serious legal questions and numerous
uncertainties under state and federal statutes."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Earlier this week, Kansas G&E disclosed in a Securities
and Exchange filing that it might consider a merger or
recapitalization plan as a means of foiling its unwanted
suitor.</p>
<p>In a letter made public yesterday, Kansas City P&L
President and Chief Executive Officer Drue Jennings told
Kansas G&E Chairman and President Wilson K. Cadman: "We are
concerned that KG&E's statement indicates that you may enter
discussions with third parties without also engaging in
discussions with us."</p>
<p>Mr. Jennings urged: "Let's meet before you take any steps,
such as agreeing to substantial commitment and other fees or
agreeing to merge with, or sell significant assets to, a
third party."</p>
<p>Kansas City P&L's offer has been extended until Sept. 14;
at the time the original expired Aug. 20, about 43% of Kansas
G&E's common shares had been tendered.</p>
