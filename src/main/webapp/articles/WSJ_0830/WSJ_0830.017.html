	<div class="article-body"><p>NATIONAL GYPSUM Co. (Dallas) -- Moody's Investors Service
Inc. said it lowered the debt ratings of this construction
conern predicting that falling gypsum wallboard prices would
"erode the company's already very thin" reserves for making
interest payments. Moody's said it lowered to Caa from
single-B-3 the ratings on priority senior subordinated
debentures and subordinated debentures. The gypsum wallboard
industry continues to suffer from overcapacity and depressed
price levels, Moody's said. The poor outlook for housing
starts combined with what Moody's called "the unlikelihood of
a near-term turnaround in the company's performance" raises
doubts about National Gypsum's ability "to generate enough
cash to service its debt through the downcycle," Moody's
said. Moody's noted that National Gypsum's debt is
nonrecourse to Lafarge Coppee, a French construction company
that owns 54% of National Gypsum. National Gypsum declined to
comment.</p>

<p>CALFED Inc. (Los Angeles) -- Moody's Investors Service
Inc. said it lowered its rating on this financial services
holding company's subordinated debt to single-B-2 from Ba-3.
The rating concern also downgraded the California Federal
Bank unit's long-term deposits and senior debt to Ba-2 from
Baa-3, and short-term deposits and commercial paper to not
prime from prime-3. Moody's said about $875 million of debt
is affected by the changes. Moody's said its action reflects
California Federal's "somewhat weak" capital, and increased
uncertainty about the future of California commercial real
estate. A Calfed spokesman said the Moody's move reflects the
"increasingly pessimistic outlook for California real estate
values."</p>
