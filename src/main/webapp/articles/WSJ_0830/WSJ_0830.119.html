	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The populations of many big industrial
states stagnated in the 1980s, while Americans swarmed to the
Sun Belt and the West Coast, according to preliminary U.S.
Census Bureau figures.
   The population of New York state barely grew over the past
decade, rising a mere 0.4%, to 17,626,586 from 17,558,000.
Over the past year, it actually declined. The populations of
Illinois and Pennsylvania also slipped slightly between 1980
and 1990.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the population of California surged nearly 24% in the
1980s, to 29,279,015 in 1990 from 23,668,000 in 1980. Texas
grew 18%, to 16,824,665 from 14,229,000 in 1980, although its
population slipped over the past year, according to the
figures.</p>
<p>The figures on New York, Pennsylvania, Texas and Illinois
were released yesterday, completing the Census Bureau's
preliminary population listings for all 50 states.</p>
<p>California easily retained its spot as the most populous
state, while New York managed to hang onto the No. 2
position.</p>
<p>A Census Bureau official cautioned that the counts are
incomplete and likely will be changed in the final report,
which is expected next spring.</p>
