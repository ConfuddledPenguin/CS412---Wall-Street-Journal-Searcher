	<p class="article-leader">A federal appeals court in Los Angeles upheld the
dismissal of a libel suit against CBS commentator Andy Rooney
stemming from statements he made during a broadcast two years
ago.
   It is thought to be the first such decision by a federal
appeals court since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled last June
that statements of opinion are not necessarily immune from
defamation suits.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In an April 1988 television broadcast on the CBS
newsmagazine show "60 Minutes", Mr. Rooney held up a bottle
of "Rain-X," a chemical sealant used to protect cars from
rain, snow and ice, and said he spent an hour putting it on
his car windshield after receiving a free sample in the mail.</p>
<p>"I suppose he'd like a commercial or a testimonial," Mr.
Rooney scoffed, speaking of Rain-X's manufacturer, Unelco
Corp., in Scottsdale, Ariz. "You know how they hold the
product up like this? It didn't work."</p>
<p>Unelco's suit, filed in May 1988, was dismissed by a
federal judge in Phoenix on the ground that Mr. Rooney's
comments were protected opinion. But the case was under
appeal in Los Angeles when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in
June that commentary is protected only if it is clearly
presented as an opinion -- not as objective fact.</p>
<p>Following that standard, the Circuit Court of Appeals in
Los Angeles found that Mr. Rooney's comments fell in the
latter category. The appeal panel dismissed the case,
however, on the ground that Unelco failed to establish that
Mr. Rooney's comments were false.</p>
<p>Chicago attorney Robert P. Cummins, who represented
Unelco, said the appeal court judges were correct in finding
Mr. Rooney's comments potentially defamatory, but said the
court's analysis of whether his comments reflected the truth
"missed the mark."</p>
<p>"We did not have an opportunity to develop a record that
could be objectively scrutinized," said Mr. Cummins, adding
that he plans to ask the full appeals court for a rehearing.</p>
<p>The decision was only a partial victory for CBS Inc. "It
has always been our belief that these were not statements of
fact, but that they were inherently unreliable comments
because they reflect Mr. Rooney's personal experience with
the product," said Heddy Gold, in-house litigation counsel
for CBS in New York.</p>

<p>INCREASES IN COMPENSATION for general counsel appear to
slow.</p>
<p>Attorneys who head corporate legal departments got healthy
pay increases this year, but a sluggish economy apparently is
reducing the size of the compensation boosts.</p>
<p>A recent Ernst & Young survey of 700 U.S. companies found
that they are paying their general counsel an average 8% more
in salary and bonus this year than in 1989. Last year,
general counsel got average increases of about 10%, Ernst &
Young says.</p>
<p>"The pay is going up, but it's a far cry from the
double-digit increases we saw in the mid-1980s," says Robert
J. Berkow, national director of a law firm consulting at
Ernst & Young, New York. "It's a reflection of what's going
on in the economy."</p>
<p>Ernst & Young made the annual survey in conjunction with
the Association of the Bar of the City of New York and the
American Corporate Counsel Association, Washington, D.C.
Formal results won't be published for about two weeks.</p>
<p>A previously published survey by Of Counsel, a legal trade
publication, reported a similar slowing of compensation
increases for top legal officers at 170 public companies. It
showed an increase of 10.6% compared with 12.5% the year
earlier. Some attorneys believe that the slowing trend may
continue because of corporate worries about a recession.</p>
<p>"I'd be surprised if it's 10% next year -- real
surprised," says Stephen Bokat, vice president and general
counsel of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Washington, D.C. But
other legal experts believe the longer-term pay prospects are
strong. "I think the trend for the '90s looks good," says
Paul Roy, a vice president of Hildebrandt Inc., Somerville,
N.J., a legal consulting firm.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, compensation appears to vary with the
size of a company's legal department. The general counsel
overseeing a one or two-person operation received
compensation averaging $124,000, the Ernst & Young study
shows.</p>
<p>That rose to $420,000 for general counsel supervising
staffs of 51 to 99 lawyers and $516,000 for general counsel
with staffs of more than 100 attorneys.</p>

<p>RACKETEERING CHARGE filed against company headed by James
H. Guerin.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors in Philadelphia have filed a
racketeering charge against Parent Industries Inc., a holding
company headed by Mr. Guerin, a military equipment contractor
who turned a backyard security and electronics firm in
Lancaster, Pa., into a global weapons conglomerate.</p>
<p>The charge, filed as an information in federal court in
Philadelphia, alleges that Parent Industries participated in
a scheme to create more than $1 billion in phony weapons
contracts to inflate the value of International Signal &
Control Corp., a maker of hi-tech military hardware that Mr.
Guerin started in 1971.</p>
<p>Mr. Guerin sold ISC to Ferranti International PLC,
Britain's third-largest military contractor, for $670 million
in 1987, but Ferranti has since claimed that it was duped in
the deal. Last year, Ferranti wrote off $365 million, more
than half its net worth.</p>
<p>A criminal information is an alternative to an indictment
and is usually filed after the subject of an investigation
has agreed to plead guilty. Last May, Parent Industries
agreed to plead guilty to one count of racketeering and pay
the government $4.4 million in fines and criminal
forfeitures.</p>
<p>Mr. Guerin himself hasn't been charged with a crime.
Neither he nor his attorney Joseph Tate, with the
Philadelphia law firm of Schnader, Harrison, Segal & Lewis,
could be reached for comment yesterday.</p>
<p>Mr. Guerin has been under investigation for two years, but
the information is the first criminal charge filed in the
case. Federal prosecutors said the investigation is
continuing.</p>

<p>HOW LOW may the police fly when searching for drugs?</p>
<p>Above 50 feet if they're searching by helicopter, the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court has ruled. The court reversed the
conviction of a Bucks County, Pa., man who was spotted
through a skylight in his roof growing marijuana in 1985.</p>
<p>The decision is thought to be the first in the country
since the U.S. Supreme Court addressed the issue of aerial
drug searches last year. But the 15-page decision leaves
unclear how low police helicopters can fly in the
surveillance of homes and private property of criminal
suspects.</p>
<p>Police in the Bucks County case descended to 50 feet from
500 feet and made three passes, rattling windows and shaking
the house, to confirm that the plants seen through the
skylight were marijuana, according to the decision. The court
ruled that the flights constituted an unreasonable search
because they "represented a hazard to person and property on
the ground."</p>
<p>But the decision doesn't explain what legal standards --
public safety or an individual's right to an expectation of
privacy -- should decide the issue. Last year, the U.S.
Supreme Court upheld the conviction of a Pasco County, Fla.,
man who was arrested after local sheriff's deputies flying at
400 feet spotted marijuana growing in his greenhouse. But
that case, in which the court was sharply divided, also
didn't set limits on how intrusive aerial searches can be.</p>
<p>Assistant Bucks County District Attorney Gary Gambardella
said he plans to ask the Pennsylvania high court for a
rehearing and may appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

<p>VICTIMS OF A CRIPPLING DISEASE sue Kodak over diagnostic
dye.</p>
<p>Eastman Kodak Co. and other companies are being sued by
300 plaintiffs who say they were crippled by Pantopaque, a
dye used to diagnose back and spinal injuries. The
class-action suit was filed in federal court in Newark, N.J.</p>
<p>According to the plaintiffs' attorney, N. Scott Rosenblum,
a partner at the Clayton, Mo., law firm Wittner, Poger &
Rosenblum, his clients were never told they were risking
chronic pain, paraplegia or death from an incurable disease
known as arachnoiditis when they allowed doctors to inject
Pantopaque into their spinal systems. The plaintiffs are
asking for more than $15 million in damages.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Kodak said the company's lawyers hadn't
seen the complaint and declined to comment.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the other accused firms, Alcon Pharmaceutical
Laboratories Inc., Austin, Texas; Lafayette Pharmaceutical
Inc., Fort Worth, Texas; and defunct Lafayette Pharmacal
Inc., Indianapolis, could not be reached for comment.</p>

<p>CLASS ACTION SUIT challenges Illinois lethal injection
procedure.</p>
<p>Lawyers representing death-row prisoners in Illinois have
asked federal Judge James B. Zagel to halt all executions in
the state until the courts determine whether an unauthorized
chemical, potassium chloride, can be used with two others
specified by state statute for lethal injections. The state
plans to begin executions on Sept. 12.</p>
<p>Lawyers from the MacArthur Justice Center and the Chicago
law firm Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal filed a class-action
suit on behalf of about 130 prisoners challenging the
Illinois Department of Corrections' execution procedures.
Sonnenschein partner Charles Altschuler said there is a
substantial risk that the proposed injection procedure will
"inflict torture" before it kills.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Illinois State Attorney's office would
not comment on the substance of the case.</p>

<p>Corrections & Amplifications</p>
<p>CBS Inc. litigation counsel Heddy Gold said CBS
commentator Andy Rooney's statements in a broadcast about a
product he sampled weren't deemed fact but were "inherently
unverifiable comments, because they reflect Mr. Rooney's
personal experience with the product." Ms. Gold was
incorrectly quoted in an item in yesterday's Legal Beat
column about the dismissal of a libel suit against Mr.
Rooney.</p>
