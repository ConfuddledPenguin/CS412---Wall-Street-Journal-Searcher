	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Refco Inc., a Chicago futures firm, agreed
to pay a $220,000 fine to settle Commodity Futures Trading
Commission charges that it failed to maintain certain
records, and that it violated regulatory orders relating to
its record keeping.
   The charges stemmed from alleged actions by Ray Friedman
of Palm Beach, Fla., a founder of Refco and a longtime
trader. The CFTC alleged that Mr. Friedman, trading for an
unnamed customer, violated speculative position limits for
pork belly futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for
about a year, beginning in June 1988.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The commission charged Mr. Friedman with aiding and
abetting Refco in not keeping written records of the orders.
The CFTC said that Mr. Friedman hasn't settled the charges.</p>
<p>Refco was charged with failing to maintain the records,
failing to retain customer risk-disclosure statements,
failing to supervise, and violating two cease-and-desist
orders entered by the CFTC in 1983 and 1988 relating to
record keeping and supervision charges.</p>
<p>The company, which didn't admit or deny any wrongdoing,
consented to a CFTC finding that it violated the regulations
cited by the commission. In addition to the fine, Refco
agreed to refrain from further violations and to review its
supervising procedures.</p>
<p>In a prepared statement, Refco said: "The alleged
record-keeping violations did not affect the profitability of
customer accounts. It is Refco's intent to comply with all
applicable laws, rules and regulations. Refco has settled
this matter in order to maintain its positive working
relationship with the CFTC and to avoid the costs and
distraction of protracted litigation."</p>
<p>In an unrelated action, the CFTC charged Craig LaCrosse of
Oak Brook, Ill., with aiding and abetting another floor
broker in entering false order records and engaging in
improper and false sales. The CFTC also alleged that Mr.
LaCrosse engaged in noncompetitive trading.</p>
<p>Mr. LaCrosse, a registered floor broker and member of the
Chicago Board of Trade, was one of 45 traders indicted last
year by a grand jury for alleged trading abuses.</p>
<p>Mr. LaCrosse last year pleaded guilty to aiding and
abetting the creation of a false record in connection with a
customer order and to making a prearranged accommodation
trade.</p>
