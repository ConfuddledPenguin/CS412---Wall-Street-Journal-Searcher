	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Image Bank Inc., which licenses photos and
film, said its board authorized it to buy back as many as
30,000, or 0.8%, of its nearly 3.7 million shares
outstanding.
   Image Bank would buy the shares on the open market or
privately over the next year and use them for an employee
stock purchase plan. In national over-the-counter trading
yesterday, the shares closed unchanged at $2.75.</p>
