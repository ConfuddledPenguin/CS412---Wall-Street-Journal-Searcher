	<p class="article-leader">FLINT, Mich. -- Action Auto Stores Inc. said it will
auction pieces of its property next month in an effort to
reduce its debt.
   The automotive-parts retailer said it hopes to raise about
$8 million from the sale of more than 50 property sites
throughout Michigan.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"This strategic move is in keeping with the consolidation
of our company," said C. James Sabo, chairman.</p>
<p>The company in June filed a petition for reorganization
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.</p>
