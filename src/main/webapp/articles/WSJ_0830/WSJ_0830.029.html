	<p class="article-leader">Cadbury Schweppes PLC, a British beverages and sweets
manufacturer, reported a 12% rise in pretax profit on the
back of strong earnings in Europe which were partially offset
by a sharp rise in interest charges.
   Pretax profit for the six months to June 16 rose to 105
million pounds ($204 million) from 93.9 million pounds.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Cadbury said U.K and overseas properties acquired in the
last year are making "satisfactory progress" and contributed
to the gain in earnings.</p>
<p>Group sales jumped 22% to 1.41 billion pounds from 1.15
billion pounds, including record sales of 640 million pounds
in the U.K., up from 506 million pounds last year.</p>
