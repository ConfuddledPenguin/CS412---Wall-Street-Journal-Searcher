	<p class="article-leader">"You're now in the middle of one of the toughest military
missions in modern memory."
   -- President Bush, Aug. 29</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A DESERT AIR BASE, Saudi Arabia -- As President Bush
delivered his first message to the troops yesterday, the men
in Sgt. William Barrett's tent were listening to heavy-metal
rock tapes and trying to keep the blowing sand out of their
eyes.</p>
<p>For them, as for many U.S. troops here, it is now a
waiting game. The long, sleepless frenzy of unloading planes
and setting up camp is over. As the confrontation between the
U.S. and Iraq heads into a diplomatic phase, the crucial
issue may be which side can best endure what Mr. Bush called
the "long, hot days of the Gulf region's cruelest month."</p>
<p>Boredom now looms as the worst enemy. "We just sit around
and try to keep up each other's spirits," says 24-year-old
Sgt. John Hensley of Fayetteville, N.C.</p>
<p>Sgt. Hensley plays a major role as morale-booster because
he has brought along his cassettes. He also has taught his
companions a trick that not only is useful but also for a
time was the troop's chief form of entertainment. The
soldiers wrap plastic water bottles -- which are ubiquitous
here -- with gauze. Then they wet the gauze, which is secured
to the bottles with shiny duct tape, and set them out on the
runway. There, in the 120-degree heat, the desert wind chills
the bottles through the magic of evaporation.</p>
<p>The half-dozen men in the tent, all mechanics for their
unit's tank-killing A-10 jet fighters, must spend 12 hours a
day on the flight line. As the wing's maintenance crew during
alerts, they must be ready to prepare the planes --
affectionately known as "the Hogs" -- for what could be one
of the first battles of war.</p>
<p>Col. Sandy Sharpe, commander of the 354th Tactical Fighter
Wing, which flew here from its home in Myrtle Beach, S.C.,
worries about what boredom can do to his troops. "They're
ready right now to do their job," he says. "I don't think any
of them want to sit around for six weeks."</p>
<p>But sit around they may. That's why the tremendous
logistical support the U.S. forces are receiving -- from the
U.S. and the Saudis -- may become decisive in the Persian
Gulf showdown.</p>
<p>The support is beyond what the U.S. has had in any
previous war. For example, the mail service here borders on
the supernatural. When Sgt. Barrett arrived a week and a half
ago, this was a largely empty airstrip, built oversized -- as
many Saudi projects were -- for distant future needs. But
already, Sgt. Barrett has received five letters from his
wife.</p>
<p>Portable showers have been installed. Soon there will be a
laundry, a daily hot-meal service and a 500-bed tent
hospital. As visiting reporters left this base, a line of
flatbed trucks carrying portable outhouses was seen heading
north toward the border.</p>
<p>A city of air-conditioned tents has been erected here for
sleeping. The Saudis pay the energy bills, and when they
heard the airmen were sleeping on cots, they came up with a
supply of thick mattresses.</p>
<p>Tonight, the long-awaited MWR -- for morale, welfare and
recreation -- tent will be ready to show movies from the U.S.</p>
<p>Most of the men and women here have never seen combat.
Col. Sharpe, who saw action during the later stages of the
Vietnam War, says the relative handful of veterans remaining
are mostly senior unit commanders.</p>
<p>Out on the runway, the long row of twin-engine A-10s have
never fired a shot in battle either. They are painted dark
green, designed to blend into the shrubbery of Central
Europe. The planes' fuselages are built around large machine
guns whose uranium-tipped bullets can stitch Soviet-made
tanks.</p>
<p>"We'll be right there when their boys meet our boys," says
Capt. James L. Baldwin of West Monroe, La., one of the
pilots. "We'll be right over them at a couple of thousand
feet."</p>
<p>As far as is known here, the Iraqi soldiers who have dug
into the table-flat desert over the Kuwaiti border have very
little in the way of creature comforts.</p>
<p>"They fought Iran for eight years, but they never had
supply lines this long," says one Saudi official. "They have
made sure there is very little left in Kuwait, so their lines
must go back to Iraq."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the stiff breeze off the desert flaps the roof
of Sgt. Barrett's tent, and the midday sun makes the A-10s so
hot that the mechanics must work with gloves on. "We can hang
out as long as it takes," Sgt. Barrett says.</p>
