	<p class="article-leader">Green Cross Certification Co. said it issued the first
independent environmental seal of approval indicating that
products meet a specific standard, such as 100% recycled
content.
   Green Cross said that as a first step, it certified the
recycled content of more than 50 paper products, plastic bags
and fire logs distributed nationally by six manufacturers.
The products will have a label containing the Green Cross
seal, and a specific explanation -- such as "made from at
least 80% recycled plastics."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Green Cross, a division of Oakland, Calif.-based
Scientific Certification Systems Inc., a
food-and-product-testing concern, said the labeling program
should promote recycling and help clear up confusion over
environmental marketing claims. The label won't mislead
consumers because it verifies only the accuracy of specific
claims and avoids vague product endorsements, such as
"environmentally friendly," said a spokeswoman.</p>
<p>However, consumer advocates and some companies caution
that Green Cross could increase confusion by adding to the
proliferation of competing and conflicting environmental
labels. Another group, Green Seal Inc., for example, plans to
issue seals of approval next year for products that reduce
waste from manufacture through disposal. Some also warn that
comparisons could be unfair if competing labels use different
definitions for "recycled content" or other standards.</p>
<p>Green Cross said it issued certifications to 40% recycled
content paper grocery sacks made by Portland, Ore.-based
Willamette Industries Inc.; 100% recycled paper napkins,
toilet paper and tissues made by Portland, Ore.-based Pope &
Talbot Inc., LaPalma, Calif.-based Orchids Paper Products
Co., and Irvine, Calif.-based Confab Cos.; 50% and 80%
recycled plastic trash bags made by Peabody, Mass.-based
Webster Industries Inc.; and 100% recycled fire logs made by
Hillsboro, Ore.-based Green Fields Inc. Green Cross says it
will expand the program to glass and additional plastic
products.</p>
<p>Most of the companies are smaller producers hoping to
increase sales and market shares by promoting an
environmental advantage over major brands. "The certification
helps establish credibility with consumers," says a
spokeswoman for Pope & Talbot, a maker of private-label paper
products.</p>
<p>Julie Vergeront, special assistant Minnesota attorney
general, says Green Cross should help consumers make informed
choices, provided that claims are clear and accurate. She
said competition from niche products could force major brands
to increase their recycled content.</p>
<p>Green Cross says it independently verifies claims and
charges manufacturers only the actual cost, which ranges from
$1,000 to $10,000. The program is currently being promoted in
four West Coast grocery chains; Green Cross says this will
soon expand to chains in the East and Midwest.</p>
