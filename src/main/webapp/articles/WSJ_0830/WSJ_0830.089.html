	<p class="article-leader">RIO DE JANEIRO -- Among the foreigners reportedly being
held in Iraq are Brazilian weapons engineers who may have
been aiding Baghdad's missile capabilities, according to
officials and individuals familiar with their activities.
   Their presence, which highlights Brazil's once close
commercial ties with the regime of Saddam Hussein, is a
"political embarrassment" to Brazil at a time when it is
firmly supporting the economic blockade of Iraq, Foreign
Minister Jose Francisco Rezek has said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Brazilian officials acknowledge the engineers' presence in
Iraq, but contend they were operating without the
government's knowledge and say they have no specific
information on their activities.</p>
<p>"We don't have knowledge of the project," says Foreign
Ministry spokesman Jose Vicente Pimentel. "The Brazilians are
there on a strictly private basis." But Mr. Pimentel says the
"very special treatment" the group apparently enjoyed,
including luxurious but isolated living conditions, could
indicate a military project of some importance to Iraqi
authorities.</p>
<p>Brazilian press reports say the group was helping Iraq to
develop a short-range missile, possibly based on the Piranha
air-to-air missile that Brazil unsuccessfully sought to
develop, and to improve the performance of Iraq's Soviet-made
Scud ballistic missiles. There is also speculation that the
group was helping Iraq develop an earth-orbiting satellite
with military applications, and a rocket launcher. How far
these projects have advanced isn't clear.</p>
<p>Brazilian officials say that until recently Brazilians
were free to work in Iraq, but they should now comply with
Brazil's adherence to the embargo imposed against Iraq, cease
their work and leave the country. But there hasn't been any
response to Mr. Rezek's appeal to their "patriotism,"
officials say.</p>
<p>"Brazilians, including retired military {officers}, are
civilians like any others {and} have the right to work
wherever they want," says Aeronautics Minister Socrates
Monteiro. "But at a time when the Brazilian government is
proclaiming its support for the United Nations-sponsored
economic blockade against Iraq, Brazilian citizens are
obliged to comply with this blockade."</p>
<p>The group, said to total about 23 engineers, is apparently
headed by retired Maj. Brigadier Hugo de Oliveira Piva,
former director of Brazil's Aerospace Technology Center. The
engineers are said to have been in Iraq for several months.
Other foreign engineers, possibly Soviet, French and Chinese,
were believed to be working on the same project.</p>
<p>Individuals familiar with Brazilian and Iraqi military
research doubt that the project was carried out without the
knowledge of Brazilian authorities because of Mr. Piva's high
rank. "It's conceivable that the government is right, but it
seems implausible to me that Piva would go and embarrass his
government to help Iraq with its missile technology," says
Gary Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear
Arms Control, which tracks chemical, nuclear and missile
development in the Third World.</p>
<p>At the Aerospace Technology Center, according to David
Dantzic, a researcher at the Wisconsin Project, Mr. Piva was
in charge of converting the Sonda IV, Brazil's latest space
rocket, into a missile large enough to carry a nuclear
warhead, and of secretly making nuclear weapon material by
enriching uranium. Since his retirement, Mr. Piva has headed
an engineering consulting firm called HOP (after his
initials) and based in Sao Jose dos Campos, near Sao Paulo.
Repeated telephone calls to HOP's offices and to Mr. Piva's
home were unanswered. According to Mr. Pimentel, Mr. Piva was
recently in Iraq, but Brazilian press reports quote friends
of Mr. Piva saying he is in Europe.</p>
<p>While officials say Mr. Piva -- described by one magazine
as a "Brazilian Werner von Braun" -- has the right to market
his scientific abilities, the newspaper Jornal do Brasil
commented that passing on information about the Piranha
missile, whose development Brazil abandoned for lack of
funds, would "constitute a serious case of espionage." Maj.
Teles Ribeiro, a spokesman for the Aeronautics Ministry, says
he doubts the Piranha would interest Iraq because it's very
similar to the Sidewinder, a U.S. missile that Iraq could
already have obtained.</p>
<p>The engineers' presence in Iraq once again focuses
attention on Brazil's controversial defense program. In only
two decades, Brazil has become the Third World's largest arms
maker and exporter, but has roused ire in Washington because
of what the U.S. considers indiscriminate selling to
countries, such as Libya, that are linked to international
terrorism. Also, Brazil's failure to sign either the nuclear
nonproliferation treaty or the Missile Technology Control
Regime has led to suspicion that it has a program to produce
nuclear-weapons material.</p>
<p>Last summer, West German documents suggested that Brazil
was using for military purposes West German nuclear
technology acquired for the power industry, and was reneging
on some inspection terms. Brazil denies that such diversion
is taking place. More recently, the Washington-based Council
on Hemispheric Affairs and the Wisconsin Project charged that
efforts by Embraer, a Brazilian aerospace company, to
purchase an IBM supercomputer should be blocked because
Brazil could use the computer to develop -- and disseminate
-- nuclear-weapons technology. And two weeks ago, Wisconsin
Project officials warned that Brazil could use rocket motor
technology it is acquiring from a group of European companies
to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile.</p>
<p>But Mr. Pimentel, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, denies
the allegations. "We're the bad guy that on top of burning
rain forests also sells arms to Iraq," he says. "But this bad
guy hasn't sold arms to Iraq in two years and hasn't even
sold spare parts for a year because Iraq doesn't pay. We were
one of the first countries to say we would stick to U.N.
resolution 661 despite its economic costs."</p>
<p>Indeed, until Iraq's economic difficulties, it enjoyed a
profitable relationship with Brazil. Until the embargo,
Brazil imported up to 160,000 barrels of Iraqi oil a day. It
paid for some of the oil with Brazilian goods. Among other
things, Jornal do Brasil recently alleged, Brazil's previous
military government provided Iraq with a small quantity of
enriched uranium.</p>
<p>During the Iran-Iraq war, Brazil sold Baghdad about $3
billion of hardware, including armored vehicles, tanks,
rocket launchers and ammunition. Iraq's financial straits
after the war were a major reason why two of Brazil's largest
armsmakers, Avibras Aerospacial S.A. and Engesa, filed for
protection from creditors this year.</p>
<p>But the Kuwait crisis could revitalize the troubled arms
industry. Engesa hopes to sign a $2 billion contract to
supply Saudi Arabia with heavy armored vehicles.</p>
