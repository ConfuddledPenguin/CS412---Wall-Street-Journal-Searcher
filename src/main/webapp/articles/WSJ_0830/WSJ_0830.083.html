	<p class="article-leader">SERVICE FIRMS strain for an edge in a dicey economy.
   Seminars and books on customer satisfaction mushroom as
consumption cools. "We got complacent, fat and sassy," says
Larry Dirrim, head of the International Customer Service
Association. Mature technology also forces firms to stress
service in order to get a leg-up on competitors, says
Eberhard Scheuing, a marketing professor at St. John's
University in Jamaica, N.Y., who has written a book on the
subject.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>When in doubt, many consult. CareerTrack, Boulder, Colo.,
says its customer-service seminars will draw more than
100,000 clients this year -- five times 1988 attendance. In
New York, Audits & Surveys Inc., more than doubles "customer
satisfaction" visits, to 250,000. The firm rates speed,
smiles, smells and the like. But ICSA's Mr. Dirrim cautions
that consultants alone won't do the trick. He says the
service message "has got to come from the top."</p>
<p>A University of Michigan professor creates an index --
first used in Sweden -- to rate national customer
satisfaction.</p>
<p>BUT WHO COOS "IT'S YOU"? Fashion "magalogs" pick up some
slack.</p>
<p>As retailers cut back, designers make house calls through
hybrid catalogs that ape fashion magazines. Anne Klein II
prints advice from top designer Louis Dell'Olio. JH
Collectibles sends super model Cindy Crawford calling. A Big
Theme: family. Nautica shamelessly slides a copy of
Impressionist Mary Cassatt's "Maternal Caress" across the
page from a sweater ad. Ralph Lauren's Polo for boys follows
little troopers through Yosemite (before the fires) as they
learn about brewing pine-needle tea, hooking trout and
spotting birds. Polo omits prices, includes seed packet.</p>
<p>Does it work? Bloomingdale's Francey Smith says floor
traffic jumps after a mailing. Gayle Miller, head of Anne
Klein II, explains: "You don't walk in and drop $1,000 on a
few pieces of merchandise without knowing how to put it
together." AK II prints 8.5 million catalogs to help madame
decide. Retailers usually pay for mailings, but results are
tough to gauge. Shoppers using retailers' toll-free 800
numbers bypass sales floors.</p>
<p>MANY NFL TEAMS hold the line on already high ticket
prices.</p>
<p>About half the NFL teams plan increases at the gate this
fall: The hottest teams charge the most, while losers stay
put. Fans of national champion San Francisco '49ers hand over
$30 -- 20% more than last season. But the now-dismal Chicago
Bears hold steady at $27 for sideline and $24 for end-zone
seats. With only one win last year, the Dallas Cowboys keep
tickets at $25 and $19. A bargain: $7.50 bleacher seats at
Detroit Lions games.</p>
<p>Television revenues help insulate turnstile prices.
Broadcast contracts add $32 million to each team's budget
this year 00 nearly double last year's $17 million. A Denver
Broncos spokesman says the team would have been hard-pressed
not to raise prices without the TV funds. With an 11-5 record
last year, the Broncos still charge $30 for best seats.
Pittsburgh Steelers charge a flat $20 price for the third
year in a row.</p>
<p>A beer at a Philadelphia Eagles game costs $4 -- nearly
double other arenas. Proceeds help pay for security.</p>
<p>BULLY'S VIDEO: Strand VCI Entertainment rushes out a home
version of "Saddam Hussein: Defying the World," a biography
produced by Britain's Independent Television News.</p>
<p>WHAT A RACKET] Wilson introduces a new tennis racket
tomorrow at the U.S. Open. It claims the design improves the
"sweet spot," a racket's most responsive place. It's also
expected to fetch a sweet price: $300.</p>
<p>SPRING A DOGGIE with the help of "The Chosen Puppy."
Author Carol Lea Benjamin tells how to pick and train a
shelter pup. Publisher Howell Book House discounted the books
for shelters to sell or distribute. List price: $7.95.</p>
<p>PUPILS NOW, platinum later? Hungry banks court student
business.</p>
<p>New York's Chemical Bank gives away the Sony Walkman at
campuses while Ohio's Banc One lures the student body with
pizza coupons. At the University of Texas in Austin, local
banks set up booths to "rush" newcomers. "It boils down to
building a customer base as early as possible," says Paul
O'Connor of Student Bankpak, an AmeriTrust unit. Packages
often include checking (some free) and savings accounts,
automatic teller machine and credit cards. Indiana University
students outnumber townies in Bloomington, where Banc One
rolls out the Hoosier account after a popular Boilermaker
version at Purdue University.</p>
<p>Financial-aid offices are key information toeholds for
banks -- Princeton's compiles local bank terms for students
-- but proximity is the biggest draw. "Without a branch on
campus it's hard to communicate," says Ralph Jordan of tiny
Tompkins County Trust, in upstate New York, which recently
bumped Norstar from the popular ATM spot in Cornell
University's bookstore. Bank of Boston rests on the laurels
of its many academic neighbors as students pour into its
Harvard Square branch.</p>
<p>A Chemical Bank survey finds only 3% of 200 polled schools
have ATMs.</p>
<p>BRIEFS: Jackson-Mitchell Inc. begins using aseptic
packaging to lengthen shelf life of its beverage of choice:
goat milk. . . . Pro Creations Maternity Leasewear, Portland,
Ore., now offers ensembles for the pregnant bride.</p>
