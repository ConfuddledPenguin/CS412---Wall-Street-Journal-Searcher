	<p class="article-leader">ARMONK, N.Y. -- International Business Machines Corp. said
it agreed to sell more than 13,000 personal computers to the
Soviet Union for use in high schools and third-level
education.
   IBM didn't disclose the value of the contract, but it is
likely one of the biggest sales ever of electronic equipment
to the Soviets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>An IBM spokesman also said the company is talking to
Soviet officials about establishing a personal-computer
assembly plant within the Soviet Union, but he declined to
give details. Soviet officials couldn't be reached for
comment.</p>
<p>IBM said the education contract, which was signed last
month and unveiled to coincide with the U.S.-Soviet summit,
is the first fruit of a ripening relationship between the
computer giant and the superpower.</p>
<p>IBM established an office in Moscow in the mid-1970s but,
until recently, trade restrictions have limited its role to
representation and goodwill. Last year, the company donated
about 40 personal computers to the Soviets for various
purposes, including a pilot program in several schools;
education of blind and hearing-impaired students; and
familiarization with business applications.</p>
<p>IBM said the education contract will be paid in dollars.
The personal computers will be a mix of models from its
Personal System/2 line, and will be sold at an undisclosed
discount. The spokesman said the discount is greater than the
generally accepted discount for educators, which is 40%.</p>
<p>Computer makers are barred from selling to the Soviets
machines based on microprocessors more powerful than Intel
Corp.'s 80286 chip, the basis of IBM's AT-class computers.
Given that fact, the contract, which also includes some
printers, is likely to be valued between $10 million and $20
million.</p>
<p>The IBM spokesman said "precious few" educational programs
have been written for the Soviet market, and that even fewer
will run on the new computers. But he noted that IBM has
agreed to adapt about 150 of its educational software
packages for Soviet schools, a move he said should encourage
further computerization.</p>
<p>IBM said it will start shipping the computers from its
Scottish manufacturing plant in September.</p>
