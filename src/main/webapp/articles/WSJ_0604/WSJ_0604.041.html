	<p class="article-leader">FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. -- Saying he views his
multibillion-dollar retail empire as "just a small regional
company," Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Chairman Sam M. Walton said he
thought the company could quintuple sales to about $125
billion by the year 2000.
   Last year, Wal-Mart's earnings increased 29% to $1 billion
on sales of $25.8 billion. If achieved, Mr. Walton's goals
for the end of the decade would boost the discount retailer
into the same league with corporate giants like General
Motors Corp., whose 1989 revenue was $126.9 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I really believe it's possible," Wal-Mart's 72-year-old
founder said at the annual meeting as he stood at the end of
a lighted walkway that extended into the middle of a
University of Arkansas sports arena. Though treated for a
form of cancer of the blood and bones earlier in the year,
the Arkansas billionaire had the fire and vigor of a revival
preacher as he led more than 8,000 shareholders and employees
in a series of call-and-response cheers.</p>
<p>"Can we do it?" he shouted.</p>
<p>"Yes we can," they roared back.</p>
<p>Mr. Walton predicted the company would double the number
of Wal-Mart and Sam's Wholesale Club stores, increase both
their average size and annual sales and continue to expand
outside the company's traditional base in the South and
Midwest.</p>
<p>By the end of the decade, he said he expects the number of
Wal-Mart stores to climb to about 3,000 from about 1,400 now
and their average size increase to about 80,000 square feet
from about 66,400 square feet. He predicted that Wal-Mart
store total sales would climb to about $96 billion annually
from about $21 billion last year and that per-square foot
sales would jump to $400 annually from about $250 last year.</p>
<p>While talking little about the disappointing results at
the corporation's four huge Hypermart U.S.A. outlets, Mr.
Walton said he hoped that Sam's Wholesale Club outlets would
increase in number to about 300 from 127 and that Sam's
annual revenue would increase to about $30 billion from about
$4.8 billion last year.</p>
<p>"It all rides on our people," said Mr. Walton, who added
that although Wal-Mart is "getting to be a large company, we
have to act small and move quickly."</p>
<p>William W. Whyte, an analyst with Stephens Inc. in Little
Rock, Ark., said WalMart, which concentrates its operations
in small towns, could probably double its number of outlets
just by moving into new markets in the 28 states where it
already has operations.</p>
<p>Noting innovations such as the company's recent efforts to
add discount grocery operations to some of its Wal-Mart
outlets, Mr. Whyte added that he would not be surprised if
Wal-Mart achieved the lofty goals laid out by its chairman
and founder. "They never cease to amaze me," he said. "With
them, we just take it one quarter at a time."</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
Wal-Mart jumped $2 to $58.375.</p>
