	<p class="article-leader">YOU'RE A JUNIOR manager, just embarked on your career. You
look ahead and see before you an endless succession of
five-day weeks, nine-to-five days, the tedium broken only by
a few weeks' vacation each year.
   But look again. Corporate America has begun to rewrite the
rules. With your company's blessing, you might work part time
while getting your M.B.A., then work full time but with
flexible hours after the birth of your first child. Burned
out at 50? Take a paid sabbatical to climb a mountain. And,
as you near retirement, share a job with the replacement you
will train.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>All these options -- and a lot more -- are available on a
limited basis today, but they are expected to become more
pervasive in the near future. Faced with a tight labor
market, employers need to recruit and retain talented
workers. And employees, especially the growing numbers of
women in the work force, are demanding more flexibility. "The
benefit of the '90s is time off," says Michael Connors,
senior vice president for human resources of American Express
Co.'s Travel Related Services unit. "The power of two incomes
is making nonfinancial rewards such as flexible scheduling
and leaves even more valuable a motivator than higher
salaries."</p>
<p>Snapshots of how these options are being handled at some
pioneering companies provide a glimpse of how how many of us
may well be working in the future.</p>
<p>Part-Time Work</p>
<p>Part-time work is by far the most common flexible
scheduling arrangement. Long used to reduce labor costs and
to staff for peak periods, it is increasingly seen as a way
to keep valued professionals in the loop until they can
return full time. The Bureau of Labor Statistics counts 3.2
million professional-level part-timers, of whom fewer than a
million are managers.</p>
<p>Janet McLaughlin, Corning Inc.'s manager of strategic
corporate education, is one of those rarities. Hired eight
years ago as a part-timer, she asked to keep that status
after she was named a supervisor. "I told them that if it
didn't work, I'd gladly step down," she says. No one
complained, and today, after four promotions, she is
responsible for Corning's management training, supervising a
staff of five.</p>
<p>Ms. McLaughlin works four days a week, taking Wednesdays
off to be with her two young children. She finds this
schedule meshes well with managerial duties. "People need
start-up at the beginning of the week and closure at the
end," she says, "but in the middle of the week they're busy
and it seems very manageable." If need be, she switches her
day off and figures that by limiting her travel, she sees her
staff about as much as managers who take more frequent
business trips. But there's little free time in her schedule.
What she misses most, she says, is informal time -- such as
rehashing meetings with colleagues. "The only way that kind
of informality happens," she says, "is if I structure it."</p>
<p>The success of trailblazers like Ms. McLaughlin led
Corning to formally offer a medley of flexible scheduling
options to its work force two years ago. Some 40 salaried
employees now work part time; over 1,000 work full time but
have flexible hours.</p>
<p>"We see the biggest value in our retention figures," says
Thomas Blumer, Corning's director of quality management and,
until recently, director of human resources. Prior to 1988,
Corning's annual attrition costs for women and minorities
were running nearly $4 million ahead of those for men. Since
the introduction of flexible scheduling as part of a broad
"work and family" initiative, those attrition costs have been
halved, saving $2 million a year. "I don't know whether being
more flexible was the whole answer," Mr. Blumer says, "but
it's part of it."</p>
<p>Job Sharing</p>
<p>Job sharing, whereby a pair of part-time employees share
one job, one salary and usually one set of benefits, is still
available mostly at the clerical level, and even there to a
relative few. But Northeast Utilities Service Co. and
Steelcase Inc. have had happy results with both professional
and hourly workers, and men as well as women.</p>
<p>Neither company permits supervisors to share jobs. "We're
not quite ready to ask people to report to two bosses," says
Mike Brown, director of employee relations at Northeast
Utilities, which employs 54 job-sharing pairs. But there are
few other hard-and-fast caveats; the arrangements are
negotiated case by case.</p>
<p>Mr. Brown has analyzed the cost-effectiveness of job
sharing. In only one area -- doubled
unemployment-compensation taxes -- did a job-share team cost
more than a full-timer. And he says the job sharers' better
attendance and productivity more than offset that added
expense. While a full-time employee seldom works full tilt
all day, he explains, two job sharers each give four hours of
"full-bore production."</p>
<p>Both companies stress that job-sharing success depends on
the chemistry between the two partners. Ideally, they look
for two people who complement each other's skills.</p>
<p>Patricia Konwinski and Martha O'Brien, senior recruiters
for Steelcase's marketing division, are one of 46 job-share
teams at the company's Grand Rapids, Mich., headquarters.
They each work on every job opening, Ms. O'Brien for the
first half of the week, Ms. Konwinski the latter half. They
confer over lunch on Wednesdays. The pair, both mothers, say
they generally agree in their assessments of job candidates
and find that one may notice something that the other has
overlooked.</p>
<p>"Our job is one of the least likely you'd say could be
shared," says Ms. Konwinski, noting that it doesn't break
down into discrete tasks that are finished at the end of a
day. "But we've made it work because of good communication. I
feel like I can pick up where she left off and not miss a
beat."</p>
<p>One of their recruits vouches for their system: "For
months I had dealt with Marty, but when the job offer was
extended it was Patty's day to work. She knew everything --
it was seamless."</p>
<p>Their boss, Dick Becker, manager of employment for sales
and marketing, concurs. He admits having had initial
reservations about continuity and managing the workload. But
in their case, he says, "one and one equals three and a
half." Besides, he says, "we kept two very valuable people in
the work force when we could have lost both of them."</p>
<p>Ms. Konwinski, now pregnant with her third child, doesn't
rule out returning to full-time work someday and feels that
job-sharing won't hamper her long-term advancement
opportunities. Indeed, she and her partner have been promoted
as a team.</p>
<p>Do they ever resent submerging their individual identities
and achievements to the team? Ms. Konwinski says no. "We are
both so strongly oriented to keeping this situation intact,"
she says, "that competition hasn't come into play."</p>
<p>Flextime/Compressed Workweek</p>
<p>Many companies now allow full-time employees to adjust
their starting and quitting times, usually around a set of
core hours when everyone is expected to be on the job.
Because it doesn't involve a reduction in hours, flextime is
popular with men as well as women. Nor does it usually
require the complicated redesign of jobs or benefit plans,
and thus it can be a low-cost morale builder.</p>
<p>Like other flexible arrangements, however, it can be
threatening to managers, who worry about maintaining adequate
staffing, scheduling meetings, and lack of supervision.
"There is a level of discomfort," says Kathleen Christensen,
an associate professor at City University of New York,
referring to flexible plans in general. Ms. Christensen,
author of a 1988 study by the Conference Board on flexible
scheduling, adds that "traditional management techniques
don't seem entirely operable when people are not always
present or are on different schedules."</p>
<p>Significantly, however, very few of the programs have been
rescinded. One reason: giving employees more control of their
time appears to yield payoffs in productivity and retention.
"Companies have begun to realize these options are all
strategic tools, not just new goodies for the employees,"
says Barney Olmstead, co-director of New Ways to Work, a San
Francisco research group.</p>
<p>Hewlett-Packard Co. was the first U.S. company to offer
flextime, initiating it in 1973. Unlike many "inflexible"
flextime plans, Hewlett-Packard's allows employees to
readjust their hours on short notice. At Aetna Life &
Casualty Co., some jobs can be done during any hours
acceptable to both employee and supervisor. "Conceivably, a
person could work from 10 p.m. to 6:10 a.m. Wednesday through
Sunday," suggests an Aetna supervisors' manual issued to
encourage flexibility.</p>
<p>The compressed workweek is a different sort of full-time
flexibility. This option -- in which participants typically
work four 10-hour days with three days off -- often springs
from the need to continuously staff a particular operation,
such as computer services. When, for example, an Aetna
project was nearing deadline and running out of office space,
managers asked for volunteers to work a compressed week. Two
teams, one working a three-day week and another working four
days, coped with the cramped space while keeping the project
going seven days a week. (The volunteers' only complaint:
spending too much money on their long weekends.)</p>
<p>Extended Leaves</p>
<p>Employee child-care and elder-care responsibilities are
prompting many corporations to loosen unpaid-leave policies.
When Aetna followed up on employees who had taken maternity
disability three years ago, it found that 23% had left the
company after their babies were born. "And those who left
were the higher performers," says Sherry Herchenroether,
manager of family services. A year later, after Aetna
introduced a six-month unpaid family leave, such attrition
was cut in half.</p>
<p>Elder care is cited by many employers as a growing problem
for both male and female employees. At Northeast Utilities,
nearly 30% of employees surveyed in 1987 had responsibility
for caring for an elderly relative. And the utility's work
force is 80% male.</p>
<p>When torn between their jobs and a crisis involving an
elderly parent or a sick child, American workers are
increasingly choosing to leave their jobs, employers say. Mr.
Connors at American Express Travel Related Services sees this
as a recent and abrupt shift in values. "Even in the late
'80s," he says, "I'm not sure we'd have thought employees
would make those choices." His company, which permits
employees up to 12 weeks of family leave without jeopardizing
their jobs, is preparing to announce a set of new flexibility
initiatives aimed at easing work-family conflicts.</p>
<p>At a handful of companies, extended leaves are granted
purely for self-renewal. At Tandem Computers Inc., based in
Cupertino, Calif., all employees are eligible for a six-week
paid sabbatical after four years on the job.</p>
<p>One employee used the time to hike through the Himalayas;
others have attended cooking school, studied the piano or
remodeled their homes.</p>
<p>Longer sabbaticals -- up to 10 weeks -- can be arranged if
an employee volunteers for a public-service project approved
by management. One software designer spent four weeks in
Zimbabwe last summer conducting a public-health survey.
Tandem paid her travel and living expenses.</p>
<p>Sabbaticals reduce job burnout and serve as an effective
recruiting and retention tool in the competitive Silicon
Valley job market, says Dee DiPietro, Tandem's manager of
health and welfare. Another benefit: Tandem insists that
sabbatical-bound employees train their replacements so that
co-workers gain new skills while filling in. Some
hard-chargers are uneasy about taking off for an extended
period, Ms. DiPietro concedes. "They have to get used to the
fact that life will go on without them for a while," she
says.</p>
<p>Contract Work</p>
<p>Contingent employment grew in the turbulent 1980s, as many
companies sought to avoid layoffs, control labor costs and
handle fluctuating work flow by creating a second tier of
temporary or independently contracted workers. Such employees
have loose ties to the corporation and aren't eligible for
the fringe benefits accorded the "core" work force.</p>
<p>The outlook, according to the Conference Board survey, is
for expanded use of in-house temporary pools of former
employees, coupled with slackening use of outside contractors
and temporaries. And though pension and Social Security
restrictions limit their participation now, retirees promise
to be a rich source of experienced labor in the future, as
supply diminishes.</p>
<p>Travelers Cos., for example, recently modified its pension
plan to double the number of hours pensioners can work
annually without jeopardizing benefits. Travelers also
maintains a job bank for its own retirees and those from
other Hartfordarea companies. About 250 retired temporaries
work at Travelers during any given week. Placements are made
by two job-sharing retiree teams, including one 81-year-old
woman.</p>
<p>John Huntley, a former Travelers vice president, retired
on a Friday in 1987 and registered with the job bank the
following Tuesday. "I took Monday to do all the things I
never had time to do," he says with a laugh. Hired as the
actuary for a Travelers-owned company that was being sold, he
worked about half-time in 1988 and, as the sale neared
completion, gradually fewer hours after that.</p>
<p>By using Mr. Huntley, Travelers was spared the need to
hire a full-timer for a short-term project. And though he
worked enough to lose Social Security benefits in 1988, Mr.
Huntley found the job "an excellent way to wind down into
retirement."</p>
