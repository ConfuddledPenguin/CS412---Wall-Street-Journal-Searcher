	<p class="article-leader">About this time of year in 1490, Columbus was chewing his
fingernails in Salamanca, Spain, waiting for a royal
commission to advise Ferdinand and Isabella on whether they
should finance his proposed voyage west to reach the East.
   Half a millennium later, dozens of amateur and
professional space enthusiasts await word of who, if anyone,
will finance a voyage that seems almost as far-fetched: a
race to Mars by solar-sailing spaceships.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Early last year, these space fans' imaginations were
grabbed by a proposal from the Christopher Columbus
Quincentenary Jubilee Commission. To mark the Italian's
discovery, the U.S. group suggested, teams from around the
world would build and launch in October 1992 a fleet of three
small spaceships unlike any ever seen.</p>
<p>Once in space, each of these unmanned ships would unfurl
thousands of square yards of gossamer sails that would billow
out under the almost infinitesimal pressure of sunlight.
Driven only by light bouncing off the sails' surfaces and
steered from Earth by electronic tillers and mainsheets, the
ships would tack past the moon and head for the red planet.</p>
<p>The team whose sailing ship made the quickest transit from
Earth to Mars would claim the first Columbus 500 Space Sail
Cup, a trophy that would be put up for grabs every 10 years.</p>
<p>At least that was the plan the Jubilee Commission put
forth in late 1988. Fascinated by the idea, space cadets of
all ages and disciplines rushed to their computers and
drawing boards. Last November, a committee of experts picked
the preliminary designs of eight teams -- three from the U.S.
and one each from Canada, England, Italy, Japan and the
Soviet Union -- that seemed to have a chance of actually
making it to Mars.</p>
<p>But alas, history repeats itself. Many of the would-be
space sailors say they feel the kind of letdown Columbus must
have felt in 1486 when a rich Spaniard, the Conde de Medina
Celi, backed out on a promise to lend him some caravels.</p>
<p>When the Quincentenary Commission called for design
proposals last year, "it indicated it was going to raise
funds," says Harold Fox, director of the solar sail project
for the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore. Scientists and engineers at the
laboratory rounded up government, industrial and university
space enthusiasts in Maryland and designed a $15 million
solar sail.</p>
<p>But "they busted the bubble" a month ago, Mr. Fox says of
the commission's Columbus 500 Space Sail Project. Not only
did the project's director reveal that no money had been
raised, Mr. Fox says, but "the teams were encouraged to seek
funding on their own." The disappointed Johns Hopkins/APL
team is talking to some potential donors, he says. "We'll
give it a couple more months," but if funds aren't in sight
by then, the project will be shelved, he says.</p>
<p>"I'm enthusiastic and I'd love to see it happen, but I'm
not into fund raising," says Andreas von Flotow, professor of
astronautics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
Cambridge, Mass. Mr. von Flotow and a graduate student will
spend the summer working on their concept of a $3 million
"heliogyro" with eight 250-foot bladelike sails. But that's
the most he can do without funding, he says.</p>
<p>A Canadian team has obtained about $3 million worth of
hardware and services promised from corporations and this
month will test the waters of Canadian nationalism by
launching a public fund-raising drive. "If we can get nominal
cash donations from 100,000 individuals," then Canada can
launch its own $9.6 million (Canadian) entry in the race,
says Steve Horvath, a computer expert who heads the Canadian
Solar Sail Project organized by the Canadian Space Society.</p>
<p>Fittingly, it's the Italians who seem really committed.
"We accepted with enthusiasm to do this space sailing to
Mars," says Joseph Viriglio, managing director of the space
systems group at Aeritalia, a Turin aerospace company.
Aeritalia is leading an industrial consortium to build and
launch a $20 million space sailer to be named the Capitana
Italica, the other name for the Santa Maria. "We are quite
confident of raising the money," Mr. Viriglio says.</p>
<p>The man who dreamed up the race and heads the Columbus 500
Space Sail Project, Klaus P. Heiss, remains optimistic. Mr.
Heiss is a mathematical economist who has worked on the
economics of a number of space projects, including the space
shuttle. He concedes the project doesn't yet have any money,
but says "funding is being strongly pursued" and a
fund-raising consortium will be organized by early July. The
project, he says, is still planning to get three ships,
including at least one from North America, ready to launch in
October 1992. "It can be done if we have $25 million in
cash," he says.</p>
<p>The idea of sailing through interplanetary space on puffs
of light is far from new, but it's never been tried.
Scientists have known since the turn of the century that when
light reflects off an object it exerts pressure on that
object. In the 1920s, the details of sun sailing in space
were worked out by two Russians, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky (a
schoolteacher who earlier had devised a remarkably prescient
way to rocket men to the moon) and Fridrikh Tsander, a
mathematician.</p>
<p>Enthusiasts, however, say a 1951 article in Astounding
magazine by scientist and science-fiction writer Carl A.
Wiley gave birth to present concepts of solar sails. And they
trace the idea of a race to a 1963 Arthur C. Clarke
science-fiction story about an America's Cup-type race to the
moon among seven space sailors.</p>
<p>In "The Wind From the Sun," Mr. Clarke noted that the
pressure of sunlight on one's hand was about a millionth of
an ounce. With this minuscule pressure applied to two square
miles of a sail in space, the sail would move about an inch
in the first second and about 60 feet in the first minute,
Mr. Clarke calculated. In an hour it would accelerate to 80
miles per hour, and by the end of the day the ship would be
traveling 2,000 mph -- and the speed would continue to build
day after day.</p>
<p>The sails could be maneuvered by changing their angle to
the sun's rays, just as a sailing ship maneuvers in the wind.
Power to change the angles of the sail, "trimming" it, as
well as power for communications, could come from
solar-electric cells. Thus, the sail could flit through space
without a drop of fuel.</p>
<p>All this prompted NASA in the late 1970s to commission Jet
Propulsion Laboratories in Pasadena, Calif., to design a
solar sailship to rendezvous with Halley's Comet when it came
by in 1986. Unlike rocket-launched probes that could only fly
by, a sail ship could maneuver about the comet for several
days.</p>
<p>The Halley's project foundered on a budget reef. But the
idea fascinated a group of space enthusiasts in Southern
California, who organized the World Space Foundation and
built what is still the world's only space-sail manufacturing
machine. In 1981 they actually built a 50-foot-square
prototype solar sail of aluminized Mylar plastic, which was
unfurled once, in a gymnasium.</p>
<p>Designing "sunjammers," as they were dubbed in a 1964
science-fiction story by Poul Anderson, is far from simple.
To get the most sail area per pound of spacecraft weight, the
sail must be tissue-thin. Proposed sails are huge, with
diameters and diagonals three to seven times the length of
the 117-foot Santa Maria. The Canadians' hexagonal sail would
cover 12,000 square yards, while the disk-shaped one designed
by Cambridge Consultants Ltd. in England would cover 15
acres, or 11 football fields.</p>
<p>Yet the sails are so light they must be unfurled at least
1,000 miles above the Earth's surface, where there's not the
slightest wisp of atmosphere to drag them down. This altitude
is beyond the reach of the space shuttle, so ships must be
launched by rocket.</p>
<p>The trickiest part of the whole race is unfurling the
giant sails after they've been packed into a nose cone.
Cambridge Consultants designed its sail, dubbed the Nina,
with 36 elastic ribs wound around a central hub, with the
sail folded up between the ribs. In space the ribs would
spring out radially from the hub.</p>
<p>The Johns Hopkins/APL team figures its sail will have to
spend 60 to 90 days in a steadily elongating elliptical orbit
before it has enough speed to break free of Earth's gravity.
If it breaks loose at just the right moment, it will be
grabbed by the moon's gravity and whipped out on a course to
Mars, getting there in maybe 400 to 500 days.</p>
<p>If past is prologue, the would-be space sailors are in for
at least one more disappointment. The finalists are to be
picked this October, by which time Mr. Heiss's promised
consortium should know its prospects for funds. This is 500
years almost to the month from the report of the Talavera
Committee on Columbus' request. The committee told Ferdinand
and Isabella that it wasn't proper for them "to favor an
affair that rested on such weak foundations and which
appeared uncertain and impossible to any educated person,
however little learning he might have."</p>
<p>And President Bush doesn't have any jewels to hock.</p>
