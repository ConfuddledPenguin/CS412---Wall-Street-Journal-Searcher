	<p class="article-leader">Hitachi Ltd. will unveil a mainframe computer this week
that will be far more powerful than those now on the market,
boosting the Japanese company's bid to become a major player
in the U.S.
   Company executives in Tokyo declined to discuss the
details, but Hitachi's U.S. arm, Hitachi Data Systems, has
invited reporters and analysts to a mainframe announcement
Wednesday in six cities around the world. Industry executives
said the Hitachi machines will be the first of the new
generation of mainframes that Hitachi, International Business
Machines Corp. and Amdahl Corp. are expected to announce over
the next few quarters for the U.S. market.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It will mark the first time that Hitachi, the traditional
laggard, has been first out of the starting gate. That should
change the dynamics of the market and set Hitachi up well for
the five to seven years that this new generation of
mainframes will last.</p>
<p>Securities analysts and consultants said the Hitachi
machines will most directly hurt Fujitsu Ltd., the other
major Japanese mainframe maker, and Amdahl, a U.S. company
that is 46%-owned by Fujitsu and that makes machines based on
Fujitsu designs. But some said the machines could also damage
IBM, despite its traditional dominance in this area.</p>
<p>"I believe this is the first time Hitachi could
potentially be in the position of claiming technology
leadership in high-end mainframes," said Steven W. Myers, a
technology analyst for the Tokyo office of Jardine Fleming
Securities Ltd. "I expect them to see nearly a doubling" in
U.S. market share over the next few years. Currently, Hitachi
has only about 6% of the U.S. market.</p>
<p>The machines will, at the least, make Hitachi a credible
player in the high-end of the mainframe market, where it
doesn't even have an entry in the U.S. at the moment. Hitachi
Data Systems' current line tops out at 88 million
instructions a second, while Amdahl hits 108 mips and IBM
reaches 112 mips. But the new machines are expected to
provide at least 150 mips, and Steve Cohen, an analyst at
SoundView Financial Group Inc., said the architecture leaves
plenty of room for Hitachi to boost that number to around 400
mips over the next few years. That means Hitachi will at
least be a factor even after IBM and Amdahl announce their
next generations.</p>
<p>"They may not win all the deals," said Jim Cassell, an
analyst at Gartner Group Inc., a market-research firm, "but
at least they have to be shown in the door."</p>
<p>Hitachi's new line also could chip away at IBM's
stranglehold on the mainframe market in other ways. While the
initial machines will get their power by lashing together as
many as four processors, the architecture will apparently
allow for using as many as eight. IBM's mainframes currently
top out at six processors, and Mr. Cassell said IBM, too,
will hit a maximum of eight processors when it announces its
new machines. IBM traditionally has had processors that were
individually slower than those in the Hitachi and Amdahl
machines, but it made up for that deficiency by figuring out
how to use more processors in each machine. Thus, IBM may be
losing one of its major technological edges.</p>
<p>It also could hurt that Hitachi didn't feel obliged to
wait to see what standard IBM set before bringing out its own
machines. This follows a similar, though smaller, coup by
Amdahl two years ago, when it introduced its 5990 mainframe
in advance of some IBM models. Evidently, IBM's competitors
are no longer willing to give the company the head start of a
year to a year and a half that it used to get after
introducing a mainframe line. That could be ominous: IBM lost
control of the personal-computer market after Compaq Computer
Corp. beat IBM to the market with products four years ago and
didn't get squashed when IBM introduced its competing models
later.</p>
<p>The initial impact of the new machines is likely to be
modest -- unless, as sometimes happens, the announcement
freezes the market while customers try to sort out who
managed to do what to whom. Hitachi will be able to ship only
a trickle of machines by the end of the year, at least in the
U.S., and won't really get up to speed until the second
quarter of 1991. By that time, IBM and Amdahl will be out
with their own announcements, and they shouldn't be too far
behind Hitachi's shipment dates.</p>
<p>In any case, IBM, with more than 80% of the world-wide
market for IBM-compatible mainframes, still has abundant
resources that it can use to dominate the market. And Amdahl
remains formidable despite some recent earnings declines.</p>
<p>"One-time strikes don't count in this game," said Bob
Djurdjevic, an analyst at Annex Research Inc. "You have to
show a sustained ability to keep up."</p>
<p>Hitachi also has been very weak at marketing, as shown by
its very small slice of the U.S. market and its No. 3
position behind Fujitsu and IBM in Japan, where Hitachi has
21% of the market.</p>
<p>But Hitachi is pushing hard to boost its presence in both
countries. "For the time being, we'd like our share . . . to
be about the same as Amdahl" in the U.S., said Toshiakira
Ikeda, a product-planning manager in Hitachi's computer
division. Amdahl's current share is around 12%.</p>
<p>Last year, Hitachi bought an 80% share of its major U.S.
distributor, National Advanced Systems, with General Motors
Corp.'s Electronic Data Systems Corp. subsidiary purchasing
the remaining 20%. The company, now called Hitachi Data
Systems, is beefing up its sales staff and recently set up
user support centers in New York and California.</p>
<p>In Japan, meanwhile, Hitachi's market share has grown by
nearly three percentage points in the past four years, while
No. 1 Fujitsu has fallen more than two points. IBM has
climbed two points in the same period, and smaller
manufacturers have lost ground.</p>
<p>Hitachi also has scored a hit in the lucrative market for
the disk drives that store the vast amounts of data that
mainframes manipulate. Its disk drives won the reputation as
the most reliable on the market -- at a time when IBM was
having trouble with its drives -- and sales have held up
reasonably well despite IBM's announcement of a new
generation late last year.</p>
