	<p class="article-leader">ABM Gold Corp., Toronto, said it expects to report a loss
for 1990, mainly because of higher depreciation and
amortization charges from its Colomac gold mine, scheduled to
begin commercial production Sept. 30. ABM, 52%-owned by
Northgate Exploration Ltd., had 1989 net income of US$2
million, or 12 cents a share, on revenue of $7 million.
   At the annual meeting, where shareholders approved
changing the company's name to NorthWest Gold Corp., John
Kearney, chairman, president and chief executive officer,
said, "ABM's income statement will substantially change when
Colomac achieves commercial production . . . and revenues and
expenses from the project appear on ABM's financial
statements." Last year, ABM had depreciation and amortization
costs of $570,000. Mr. Kearney wouldn't specify how much
these charges will increase this year, but said they will be
"much, much higher."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>He estimated Colomac's maximum output is 200,000 ounces of
gold a year, at an average operating cost of $260 an ounce.
The low-grade, open-pit mine in the Northwest Territories has
an eight-year life.</p>
