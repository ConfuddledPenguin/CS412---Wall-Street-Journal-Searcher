	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- One man's slang is sometimes another man's
slander.
   Luis Jimenez, a sculptor from New Mexico, was commissioned
to sculpt a statue honoring steelworkers for an annual arts
festival here. He inscribed his 12-foot work with the words
"Hunky Steelworker."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the phrase he thought conveyed pride provoked pique.
City Controller Thomas Flaherty, who noticed the inscription
on one of his routine jogs, held a news conference and,
flanked by two aides of Eastern European descent, decried the
word "hunky" as demeaning to Slavs, Poles and Croatians.
Worse yet, he said, the statue wasn't even made of steel, but
fiberglass.</p>
<p>Local newspapers carried front page stories and pictures
of the statue. Readers urged a festival boycott. A
representative of the Croatian Fraternal Union of America,
with 90,000 members, called the statue nasty and especially
insulting given that the group was trying to prepare for
"Croatian National Day." A local state representative said he
was considering introducing a resolution that would urge
festival organizers to move the statue off public parkland.
George E. Kelly, a former steelworker, was offended by the
sculpture itself. "Of the thousands I worked with, I never
saw one as ugly as that statue."</p>
<p>Statue supporters cried First Amendment foul. The
Pittsburgh Post Gazette called Mr. Flaherty this year's
"Politician Who Will Make the Arts Festival Safe for
Society," and suggested he confine his critiques to food
booth offerings. The Pittsburgh Press noted that no one got
upset over a magazine published by steelworkers called the
"Mill Hunk Herald."</p>
<p>One writer said he didn't understand the flap. Hunky, he
wrote, describes large-muscled, broad-shouldered and ruggedly
handsome men, such as Tom Selleck, Kevin Costner or Mike
Tyson: "Those men are hunks; they are very hunky men."</p>
<p>Mr. Jimenez said he used the word only after researching
the history of steelworkers. "I even talked with
ex-steelworkers before I used it," he says.</p>
<p>Worried that everyone was focusing on the inscription
instead of the statue itself, however, he had a Pittsburgh
fiberglass company grind the offensive word off on Friday, in
time for the opening of the festival.</p>
<p>But why did Mr. Jimenez choose fiberglass for a statue of
a steelworker? "It holds up better than steel."</p>
