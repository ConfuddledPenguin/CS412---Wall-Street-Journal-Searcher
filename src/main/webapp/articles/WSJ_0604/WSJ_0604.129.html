	<p class="article-leader">Take a loathing for commuting and office life, combine it
with the electronics revolution, and what do you have? The
home-office boom.
   These days, an individual with a few thousand dollars'
worth of equipment can imitate a fully staffed law office,
accounting firm or engineering company. And the future
promises even lower prices -- and more sophisticated
machines.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Equipping a basic home office costs under $4,000, and even
a lavish setup is under $10,000. Here's a list of some of the
items that most home businesses are likely to buy today, with
prices culled from recent advertisements.</p>
<p>Basic Needs</p>
<p>IBM-compatible personal computer -- $1,000</p>
<p>Prices have dropped sharply during most of the past six
months, and the most basic machines can be had for under
$500. But much of the best software today requires a hard
disk instead of cheaper floppy disks. The minimum computer
today should include an Intel 80286 processor, a 20-megabyte
hard disk and a monochrome monitor. Prices will keep dropping
30% a year.</p>
<p>Letter-quality printer -- $270</p>
<p>The 24-pin models print characters almost as well as
electric typewriters do.</p>
<p>Answering machine -- $70</p>
<p>After a telephone, the most important single item for any
home business.</p>
<p>Facsimile machine -- $480</p>
<p>The most basic models don't cut the paper or dial numbers
automatically, but they get the job done.</p>
<p>Two-line telephone -- $120</p>
<p>A must, unless you want to risk annoying clients with busy
signals or with constant requests to hold on while you answer
your call-waiting line.</p>
<p>Computer modem -- $100</p>
<p>The 2400-baud versions save lots of money when sending
electronic mail.</p>
<p>High-Powered Office</p>
<p>More powerful personal computers -- $3,099</p>
<p>PCs with 100-megabyte hard disks will run faster and are
more likely to accommodate software packages that come out in
the future. Home workers say that the bigger the hard disk,
the better off you are.</p>
<p>Hard-disk prices have been plunging lately. Color monitors
don't make much difference in the business, but they make the
kids' educational software look great -- and that's one of
the benefits of having a home office.</p>
<p>Tape drive -- $380</p>
<p>When all your business information is on your computer,
you need to back it up at least weekly. Keep the tape in the
car or elsewhere out of the house.</p>
<p>Laser printers -- $995</p>
<p>They let users print out headlines, different fonts, and
graphs and charts that look professionally produced. They are
almost silent and print at four to six pages a minute. Once
limited to print shops, they fell below $1,000 last fall.</p>
<p>Personal copiers -- $530</p>
<p>They're much less common in home offices than in corporate
offices. In emergencies, a fax machine can be used to make a
copy. And big jobs still require a trip to the print shop.</p>
<p>Facsimile machine -- $800</p>
<p>You might want one that includes an answering machine that
switches automatically to voice or fax.</p>
<p>Software</p>
<p>Buy a simple integrated package with word processing,
filing and spreadsheet built in; then add specialized
software as you find a need for it, advises Russ Walter,
author of "The Secret Guide to Computers." Unless you're
building a relationship with a computer retailer, buy
software by mail order. Join a user group for access to many
useful free programs. Some of the most popular software
includes:</p>
<p>Integrated programs -- $100-$225</p>
<p>Microsoft Works or Software Publishing's PFS First Choice.
Symantec's Q&A is more expensive, but it combines easy but
sophisticated filing with adequate word processing.</p>
<p>Word Processing -- $200-$300</p>
<p>WordPerfect is the best seller. Microsoft Word, Samna's
Ami and Xyquest's Xywrite all have their fans.</p>
<p>Spreadsheets -- $250-$330</p>
<p>Lotus 1-2-3 version 2.2 is the best seller; many recent
reviewers prefer Borland's Quattro Pro and Microsoft's Excel.</p>
<p>Accounting -- $35</p>
<p>Intuit's Quicken, the best-selling check-writing program,
is easier than double-entry bookkeeping.</p>
<p>Telecommunications</p>
<p>Keeping a residential phone rate typically saves $5 a
month or so, but it keeps you out of the Yellow Pages. Some
telephone companies have special marketing plans for
home-based businesses. Experts recommend at least two lines,
one of which is hooked to the fax machine. Following are
monthly rates:</p>
<p>Two lines, residential rates -- $20-$30</p>
<p>Call waiting -- $5</p>
<p>Voice mail boxes -- $6</p>
<p>Just becoming available. The phone company will store
messages even if your line is busy, reducing the need for
another line and eliminating the need for call waiting.</p>
<p>800 Number -- $20</p>
<p>Lets distant customers call you at your expense. Be
careful about giving out the number because you get billed
for the incoming calls.</p>
<p>MCI mail box -- $25 annual</p>
<p>Lets people send and receive computerized messages.</p>
<p>On the Road</p>
<p>Without secretaries or assistants sitting in the office,
the home-based business person is even more dependent on
electronic lifelines while traveling.</p>
<p>Cellular car phone -- $500</p>
<p>Pocket cellular phone -- $1,200</p>
<p>Portable computer -- $600-$4,000</p>
<p>You pay for portability and screen quality.</p>
<p>Portable facsimile machine -- $1,700</p>
<p>Remember, it uses thermal paper, which will turn black
while sitting in a hot car.</p>
<p>Portable printer -- $360</p>
