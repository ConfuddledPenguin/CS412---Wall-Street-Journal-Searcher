	<p class="article-leader">Nashville Network's radio division, which delivered
around-the-clock programming via satellite emphasizing
country music, said it would cease full-time operations at
the end of the month.
   The 18-month-old service, called TNNR, will continue to
produce a weekly show that is sold through syndication. TNNR
is a joint venture of Opryland USA, a privately held company
owned by Gaylord Broadcasting Co., and Group W Satellite, a
unit of Westinghouse Electric Co.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Since the network began in December 1988, it signed only
63 affiliates. According to a spokeswoman for Group W, an
unspecified number of on-air personalities will be laid off.</p>
<p>The venture cost the partners between $5 million and $10
million, said Robert Unmacht, managing editor of M Street
Journal, a Washington, D.C., publication that follows the
radio industry.</p>
<p>The discontinuation of TNNR will not affect TNN, a cable
TV network, the Group W spokeswoman said.</p>
