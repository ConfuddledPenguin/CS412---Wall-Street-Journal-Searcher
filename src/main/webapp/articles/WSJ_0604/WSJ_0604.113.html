	<p class="article-leader">IF YOU STILL WORK for a large company, consider yourself
fortunate. After all, one out of every four jobs in Fortune
500 companies disappeared in the 1980s.
   But brace yourself. Being a survivor carries a high price.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Middle managers have become an endangered species. During
the 1980s, U.S. business -- faced with a management structure
that impeded creativity and productivity -- slashed at least
one million management jobs. And there are plenty of cuts to
come: Most companies, even small ones, have middle managers
on their hit lists.</p>
<p>"Until American companies find themselves in a better
position, the pressure will be on to remove every bit of
waste there is," says William Bridges, a San Francisco
consultant who helps companies eliminate layers of
management. By the year 2010, he predicts, the typical large
business will have half as many management levels and
one-third as many managerial positions as it does today.</p>
<p>Such cutbacks clearly take their toll on those who are
fired. But they won't be the only casualties. Streamlined
bureaucracies also will force surviving managers to make
traumatic adjustments in how they work. Workloads will
increase while chances for promotion shrink. Lines of
authority will get fuzzier. And teamwork will become more
crucial.</p>
<p>"You have to really get into a different way of thinking
about work," says John Hill, chief of an Eastman Kodak Co.
business unit that has drastically reduced the number of
managerial positions over the past year and a half.</p>
<p>A different way of thinking, in fact, is precisely what
experts say is needed. U.S. business, they say, still has
plenty of fat, particularly in manufacturing. According to
the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 47% of U.S. manufacturing
employees are in nonproduction jobs, up from 23% in the
1950s. Ford Motor Co. still has 15 rungs of management;
Japan's Toyota Motor Corp. has just seven.</p>
<p>"A good rule of thumb is that you should be able to take
out 20% of the managers at any organization with a fresh
look," says Barry Rhody, who has done just that since
becoming operations vice president last year at a small maker
of air-vent systems, Lunaire Ltd., in Williamsport, Pa.</p>
<p>Formerly, during a 25-year career at Bethlehem Steel
Corp., he says, "I flattened everyone I had an opportunity to
flatten." That included reducing a 700-person accounting
department to 250. "Firing people is the toughest job a
manager has but it's got to be done," he says. "There's no
way companies can compete in world markets these days with
excess baggage."</p>
<p>But for workers accustomed to the excess baggage, the
slimming down isn't easy. It changes the very nature of
managerial jobs. When baby boomers were growing up, the job
of a corporate executive was narrowly focused and clearly
defined. A manager's chief function was to control.</p>
<p>Now, ambiguity reigns. Managers are supposed to "empower"
subordinates, who have lots of autonomy. The boss's job is to
provide direction and guide group decisionmaking -- to be a
"facilitator," according to the new lexicon, a person who
helps subordinates do their jobs.</p>
<p>"I tell my people I work for them. I am their servant,"
says Ted Sutyak, a general foreman who supervises 166 workers
at Lincoln Electric Co. near Cleveland. The world's leading
maker of arc-welding products, Lincoln has stressed such
concepts since its founding nearly a century ago.</p>
<p>But for most managers used to barking out orders, the new
order initially means one thing above all else: new
pressures. David Bates, who oversees 28 workers as part of a
new flattened management structure at the Eastman Kodak
subsidiary, says he and supervisory colleagues, called team
advisers, "are the most stressed people in the organization.
We have to make all this work."</p>
<p>"All this" is Kodak's bold vision for the future in its
black-and-white paper manufacturing business, and so far it's
giving Mr. Bates fits. The reorganization, begun in December
1988, brought under one roof a $1 billion business once
divided among five separate organizations scattered
throughout Kodak.</p>
<p>The business is now managed by just seven senior managers
rather than dozens. Three layers separate top from bottom,
and in the middle are the team advisers. "We still supervise
people, I guess," Mr. Bates says. Though the new system has
resurrected the once troubled black-and-white paper business
-- and reduced the number of workers by 30% -- Mr. Bates says
the change from giving orders to leading teams has been
difficult.</p>
<p>"I don't disagree with the direction, but this was not the
job I signed on for," says Mr. Bates. "Basically the job I
was trained for was the traditional supervisor's role. I had
the control. I trained people. I rewarded people. I punished
people. I made the decisions. Things got done rapidly and my
way." Now, he says, "instead of being the decision-maker, I'm
more the coach or mentor. That's the kind of role I fill. One
of the hard things is not to make the decision yourself. I
want the people running the process to make the decisions."</p>
<p>Such difficulties are often compounded when cutbacks
aren't well thought out. Stephen Henson, a former marketing
manager at Unisys Corp., says that his department of 75 was
halved last year, ostensibly to speed up decision-making. But
even though that eliminated two layers of management,
decision-making actually took longer, he asserts, because
control was raised to higher levels.</p>
<p>"I believe in streamlining management, but when you
flatten an organization, you must push decision-making
responsibility down at the same time," Mr. Henson says.</p>
<p>Frustrated, he quit his job, with its six-figure salary,
in March. He found a new job as marketing chief at American
Marketing & Events, a small Santa Barbara, Calif.,
special-events promotion concern.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Unisys, based in Blue Bell, Pa., declines
to comment on Mr. Henson's specific situation. He notes,
though, that the computer maker's restructurings have been
devised to do just what Mr. Henson suggests they should do --
that is, push decision-making down to lower levels.</p>
<p>Management consultants say that, too often, companies
seeking to flatten their organization charts simply eliminate
jobs without analyzing business goals or what tasks are
critical. Once jobs are cut, survivors are supposed to
rebalance the workload among themselves.</p>
<p>Most restructurings are done poorly, says Kim Cameron, a
University of Michigan business professor who studied
cutbacks at 30 auto-related industrial companies in the
Midwest. About two-thirds of the cases were botched: Either
the wrong jobs were eliminated, or blanket early-retirement
offers prompted the wrong people to leave.</p>
<p>"Often the most invaluable people -- the ones with other
options -- end up leaving," he says.</p>
<p>Moreover, when Mr. Cameron polled 2,000 surviving managers
at the companies about their workloads, nearly half said they
were working "a great deal" more than two years earlier.</p>
<p>"I was putting in 17-hour days," says Eugene Baker, of the
period following the 1986 restructuring of General Electric
Co.'s engineered materials group. Mr. Baker had been the
group's general counsel; after the restructuring, he was
transferred to Waterford, N.Y., to be general counsel to a
former part of the group.</p>
<p>He had a staff of two attorneys, but further cutbacks
whittled his staff to a single clerk. Though he liked the
job, he felt it was just too burdensome; finally, last
December after a 24-year career with GE, Mr. Baker accepted
the company's early-retirement offer.</p>
<p>"I am happy the way it worked out, but I did not like the
way it was handled," says Mr. Baker, 60 years old, who now
makes pasta and writes fiction. He intends to study English
at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.</p>
<p>Some GE managers, though, find the challenge of flattened
management exhilarating. In the past, the purchasing function
was in effect playing one supplier against another to get the
cheapest price, says Paul Bertran, who supervises General
Electric's purchasing for its $5 billion appliance business.</p>
<p>Now, it's much more creative. Rather than simply being
told what to buy, the purchaser finds his job more broadly
defined. Teams within the department execute strategy, manage
relationships with GE's suppliers and make important
decisions that affect the entire appliance business.</p>
<p>"People like their jobs a lot more," Mr. Bertran says.
"It's actually fun coming to work."</p>
