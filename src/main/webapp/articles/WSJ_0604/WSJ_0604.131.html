	<p class="article-leader">PHILADELPHIA -- Laventhol & Horwath said a new senior
management team was appointed to serve under Chief Executive
Officer Robert N. Levine.
   Mr. Levine, who formally took office on Friday after being
elected last November by the accounting firm's partners, said
in a statement that he assembled the team of six managers "to
strengthen the firm's commitment to professional quality and
build client confidence."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Laventhol, the seventh-largest accounting firm in the
U.S., has been hurt in the last few years by lawsuits
accusing it of sloppy work and by defections of key
employees. It has been forced to pay out more than $50
million in judgments and claims in the last three years.</p>
<p>Serving under Mr. Levine will be Jacob R. Brandzel as
national partner for professional services, including
accounting, auditing and tax work. He had served as the
firm's national tax partner since 1987.</p>
<p>Reporting to Mr. Brandzel are James B. Leach, national
accounting and auditing director, and Frank J. O'Connell,
national tax partner.</p>
<p>Reporting to Mr. Levine are David E. Arnold, national
partner for consulting services; Mark I. Murovitz, national
partner for technology and innovation; and Edward A. Suarez,
national partner for administration.</p>
<p>Laventhol also said several regional managing partners
took office Friday:</p>
<p>Arthur R. Nemiroff heads the Los Angeles office,
succeeding Philip T. Winik, who retires.</p>
<p>Kenneth L. Weiss heads the San Diego office, succeeding
Howard Sibelman, who was promoted to accounting and auditing
director for Southwest and Southern California offices.</p>
<p>Jerome L. Lefkowitz heads the Boston office, succeeding
David Love, who retires. Mr. Lefkowitz also manages the
Providence, R.I., office.</p>
<p>Philip Piser heads the Tampa, Fla., office, succeeding Don
Garrison, who left the firm for personal reasons.</p>
<p>Also, Sheldon J. Epstein formally assumed responsibilities
as Midwest area managing partner in Chicago. He had replaced
Kenneth I. Solomon, who resigned, at the beginning of the
year.</p>
