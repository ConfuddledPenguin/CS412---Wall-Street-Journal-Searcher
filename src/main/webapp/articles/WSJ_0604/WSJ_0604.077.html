	<p class="article-leader">Comfed Bancorp Inc. of Lowell, Mass., disclosed a huge
loss, announced that its chairman would resign and said its
auditors are expected to question its ability to continue as
a going concern.
   Separately, Home National Bank, the main unit of Milford,
Mass.-based Home National Corp., became the third
Massachusetts financial institution to be taken over by
regulators in the past five weeks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Comfed, with assets of $1.4 billion, reported a net loss
of $38.2 million, or $4.57 a share, for the fourth quarter
ended March 31, compared with a loss of $3.5 million, or 42
cents a share, a year ago.</p>
<p>In a statement, Comfed said that "as is customary with
banks with negative tangible capital," it expects to receive
a report from its auditors expressing doubt about its ability
to continue as a going concern. The company said it is
subject to a range of potential regulatory actions that may
be imposed by the Office of Thrift Supervision, including
conservatorship or receivership, which "would likely cause a
total loss of stockholders' investment."</p>
<p>Comfed attributed the losses to "the continued
deterioration of residential construction, income property
and mortgage loan portfolios," and a substantial provision
for estimated losses on loans. Because the declining
real-estate market has further eroded the bank's ability to
recover its assets, provisions for estimated losses of $42.6
million were added during the most recent quarter.</p>
<p>The company also announced that Jefferson F. Allen,
chairman, director and chief executive officer of the company
and its subsidiary, Comfed Savings Bank, would resign,
effective June 30. The company named Jack Zoeller, president
of Comfed Savings and Comfed Mortgage Co., to succeed Mr.
Allen as president and chief executive of Comfed.</p>
<p>For the full year, Comfed's net loss was $47.9 million, or
$5.73 a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $3.5
million, or 42 cents a share.</p>
<p>The Home National Bank was declared insolvent Friday by
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, with the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. as receiver. The failed
bank's 10 branch offices will reopen today as branches of
BayBanks Inc.'s BayBank Middlesex subsidiary, which will
assume Home National's $440 million in deposits.</p>
<p>The BayBanks unit has agreed to pay the FDIC a purchase
premium of $2 million. The unit will also purchase Home
National's cash and securities and will have options to buy
other assets later.</p>
<p>To facilitate the transaction, the FDIC said it will
advance the BayBanks unit $350 million and the FDIC will
retain Home National assets with a book value of about $380
million.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, Merchants Capital Corp.'s main unit,
MerchantsBank of Boston, was declared insolvent and its $340
million in deposits assumed by Bank of Boston Corp. And in
late April, federal thrift regulators took control of Home
Owners Savings Bank in Burlington, Mass.</p>
<p>Scores of New England financial institutions have been
wounded by the region's slumping real-estate market, and more
failures are expected.</p>
<p>In a statement regarding Home National, the comptroller's
office said it noted a "substantial deterioration" in the
bank's loan portfolio in 1987, "due to liberal lending
practices and weak supervision by both the board of directors
and management."</p>
<p>The statement said, "The OCC obtained a formal commitment
of the board to address the bank's problems. The board
subsequently replaced management, but a downturn in the local
economy exacerbated the problems in the bank's loan
portfolio."</p>
<p>The agency said the bank's board attempted to raise
capital as losses mounted, but was unsuccessful. "Losses
finally exhausted the bank's capital, resulting in
insolvency," the comptroller's office said.</p>
