	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Standard & Poor's Corp. said it will consider
lowering its ratings on debt and preferred stock of Xerox
Corp. and several of its subsidiaries.
   About $2 billion of the parent company's debt is affected.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>S&P said its review is a result of the possible effect of
problems at the company's Crum & Forster insurance unit.
Separately, S&P said it will consider lowering its rating on
Crum & Forster's claims-paying ability, citing uncertainty
about the quality of the company's reinsurance arrangements
and continuing weakness in the property-casualty market.</p>
<p>S&P said it was concerned about Crum & Forster's potential
for producing charges against Xerox's earnings, and its
possible need for capital infusions from the parent. It also
said it will review Crum & Forster's ability to contribute to
dividends to Xerox, a business equipment and financial
services concern based in Stamford, Conn.</p>
<p>Aside from the Crum & Forster rating, which is double-A,
S&P placed on its CreditWatch list: Xerox's senior debt,
rated single-A-plus; its subordinated debt, rated single-A;
its preferred stock, rated single-A-plus; Xerox Credit
Corp.'s senior debt, rated single-A-plus; and Xerox Credit
Overseas Finance NV's senior debt, rated single-A-plus.</p>
<p>In a statement, Xerox said: "We are obviously disappointed
at this announcement and will meet with representatives of
Standard & Poor's in the near future. Our balance sheet is
healthy and we have sound strategies in place to improve
financial performance and shareholder value."</p>
