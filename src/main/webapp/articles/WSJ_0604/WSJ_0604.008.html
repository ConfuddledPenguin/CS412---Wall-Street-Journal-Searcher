	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Pressure is building on the Bush
administration to permit more Soviet Jews to immigrate to the
U.S.
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, who said at
yesterday's post-summit press conference he was being
"bombarded" with criticism from Arab governments about the
flow of Soviet Jews to Israel, has been urging the U.S. to
accept more Russian-Jewish refugees. Arab governments are
asking Washington to take more refugees so that fewer of them
settle in Israel; they say that would reduce tension that has
been building in the Middle East. Some U.S. Jewish and
evangelical-Christian groups warn that the U.S. must be
prepared to absorb more Soviet Jews if there is an outburst
of violence against minorities in the Soviet Union, where
ethnic and religious tensions are also on the rise.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>U.S. relations with Israel, already frayed, would worsen
if Washington succumbs to such pressures. Jerusalem is
encouraging Jewish migration because it fulfills Israel's
historic role as the Jewish homeland and because a swelling
Jewish population would counter the country's more rapidly
increasing Arab population. Jerusalem would fight any
Washington effort to divert refugees to the U.S.</p>
<p>The U.S. quota on Soviet refugees is 50,000 this year; the
great majority of them will be Jewish. The Bush
administration has been saying it doesn't plan to increase
the number. But following Saturday's Camp David session
between Messrs. Bush and Gorbachev, White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said, "We continually want to take more and
are trying to work on those kinds of arrangements."</p>
<p>Most U.S. Jews support the immigration of Soviet Jews to
Israel, but wouldn't object if Washington accepts more Soviet
refugees out of concern for their safety. "I don't see a
groundswell to change things right now," says Rep. Charles
Schumer (D., N.Y.). "But if things deteriorate in the Soviet
Union, the whole situation would have to be re-examined."</p>
<p>Some U.S. groups worry about anti-Semitism in the Soviet
Union. "Our perception is the situation in the Soviet Union
is so unstable, the probability of economic collapse and
social turmoil so high, we think it's in our interest to
remove as many Jews as fast as possible," says Sergey Broude,
a member of the executive board of the Union of Councils for
Soviet Jews. Serge Duss of World Relief, an arm of the
National Association of Evangelicals that represents 50,000
U.S. churches, says: "Based on Soviet history, persecution
against Jews and Christians comes in peaks and valleys. The
last five years under Gorbachev has been a valley."</p>
<p>With more than 10,000 Soviet Jews entering Israel each
month, the mass migraton issue has become the major potential
flashpoint in the Middle East, eclipsing even the Palestinian
uprising in the West Bank and Gaza. Only a small percentage
of these refugees have settled in these territories. But the
anti-Arab rhetoric of right-wing Israelis and Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir's remark earlier this year that it will take a
"big" Israel to absorb so many Jews have led Arabs to believe
a mass immigration would mean they would be displaced.</p>
<p>Last week's Arab summit in Baghdad denounced the
immigration and blamed the U.S. for encouraging it. Recently,
Jordan's King Hussein wrote President Bush a letter saying
the U.S. had an obligation to take in more Soviet Jews.
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak also raised the issue in a
telephone call with Mr. Bush.</p>
<p>The U.S. took in 3,694 Soviet refugees in 1987, 20,421 in
1988 and 39,553 last year. The list of those wanting to leave
the U.S.S.R. far exceeds this year's U.S. quota of 50,000; a
State Department official says the U.S. has given out 750,000
applications so far this year in Moscow.</p>
<p>After decades of urging Moscow to let Soviet Jews go,
Washington says it can't afford to take more. Each refugee
costs the U.S. about $7,000 in benefits and expenses. Rep.
Stephen Solarz (D., N.Y.) has introduced legislation to give
certain able-bodied refugees loans rather than payments. Such
a plan could allow 20,000 to 40,000 more refugees to enter
the U.S., a Solarz aide estimates.</p>
<p>The exodus of Soviet citizens is growing. Moscow is
permitting emigres to leave the Soviet Union by train for
East Europe, and Poland announced last week it will begin
charter flights to transport 500 Soviet Jews each week to
Israel.</p>
<p>"Will the U.S. be able to respond if the situation
collapses and even more people need to get out of the
country?" asks Mr. Duss of World Relief. "That's the big
question."</p>
