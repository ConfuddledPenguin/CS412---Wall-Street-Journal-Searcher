	<p class="article-leader">BUSH AND GORBACHEV ENDED a four-day summit at odds over
Germany.
   Despite proclaiming that they had achieved "an atmosphere
of growing trust" during their talks in Washington, the
president and the Soviet leader concluded their talks amid
unresolved differences over the future military status of a
united Germany and on independence for the breakaway Baltic
republic of Lithuania. Still, the two leaders decided to meet
on a regular basis, perhaps annually, and Gorbachev invited
Bush to Moscow. They also signed a U.S.-Soviet trade pact
Friday, and reached accords to halt the production of
chemical weapons and on verification procedures for
nuclear-arms testing.</p>

Tiananmen Square and came amid tight security.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of people marked last year's Chinese
army attack on student-led protesters with demonstrations in

joined in the Hong Kong march, considered the biggest rally
in the British colony since last summer's gathering in
support of China's pro-democracy movement.</p>

infection.</p>

reportedly left 24 cities with significant damage.</p>

<p>Washington's Mayor Barry is scheduled to go on trial today

operation.</p>

could hinder the two-year peace process.</p>
