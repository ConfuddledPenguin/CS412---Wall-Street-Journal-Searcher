	<p class="article-leader">Integrated Resources Inc., New York, said the bidding
expired last week in the auction of its general partnership
interest in its American Insured Mortgage Investors
partnerships.
   Integrated, which is operating under federal
bankruptcy-law protection, said it didn't receive any
unconditional, cash bids of at least $40 million, as required
under the court-approved auction. But Integrated said it
received bids exceeding $40 million with certain
contingencies, which it didn't identify. The American Insured
Mortgage Investors partnerships hold federally insured
mortgages. They raised $789 million from 66,000 investors in
the 1980s. Integrated recently said it was seeking to find a
new lender for a mortgage in one of the partnerships, after
the borrower missed two interest payments. The $99.9 million
mortgage, which the American Insured 84 partnership
originated, was one of 21 in a portfolio totaling $166
million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the auction procedure, Integrated must decide
whether to accept a bid by June 15. The bankruptcy court must
approve any bid accepted by Integrated.</p>
