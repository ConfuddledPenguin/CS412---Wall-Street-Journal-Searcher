	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Donald J. Trump's cash shortage has become
critical. The developer is now in intense negotiations with
his main bank creditors that could force him to give up big
chunks of his empire.
   At a minimum, Mr. Trump is likely to face a humbling
change in his business and personal style, bankers involved
in the talks say. "He will have to trim the fat: get rid of
the boat, the mansions, the helicopter," one banker in the
talks asserts. The banks also are likely to push for some
asset sales, for some management changes and for a much more
conservative operating style at Mr. Trump's principal holding
company, Trump Organization.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Trump isn't believed to have missed any interest or
principal payments on his roughly $2 billion in bank debt.
But many of his properties, including the new Taj Mahal
casino in Atlantic City, N.J., and the Trump Shuttle airline,
aren't generating enough cash to ease lenders' fears that he
won't be able to meet payments due in the next few months.
Mr. Trump recently announced a total of about 450 employee
layoffs at the Taj and another 50 to 100 at the shuttle.</p>
<p>The lenders also have grown nervous over Mr. Trump's
ability to sell most of his major holdings for anything like
what he says they are worth. Several attempts by Mr. Trump to
raise cash through refinancings or asset sales have fallen
through or been put on hold in the past few months.</p>
<p>A seemingly insignificant, roughly $30 million in payments
due in mid-June to bondholders of Trump's Castle casino could
bring matters to a head. The developer, who has more than $1
billion in bond-debt outstanding in addition to his bank
loans, is said to have enough cash to make the payments and
to feel that making them is crucial to maintaining the
confidence of the bond market. But bankers are opposed to his
making the bond payments until steps can be taken to ensure
that payments due them will also be made.</p>
<p>It remains possible that Mr. Trump can find a way to
retain all of his properties. Many are quite valuable, and it
is conceivable the banks could be persuaded to simply lend
Mr. Trump more money, to give him time to improve his
cash-flow situation on his own.</p>
<p>Such a hands-off approach is unlikely, however. One banker
involved asserts that the banks have the upper hand in these
talks since they could threaten to at some point call their
loans, a move that, however unlikely, could force Mr. Trump
to seek refuge in bankruptcy court. Last week, Mr. Trump
offered his creditors a stake in two of his properties, the
Plaza Hotel and the Grand Hyatt Hotel in New York, in return
for retirement of some of his debt. The bankers rejected the
offer.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Mr. Trump declined to comment for this
article. Spokesmen for the four major bank creditors, units
of Bankers Trust Corp., Chase Manhattan Corp., Citicorp and
Manufacturers Hanover Corp., said the banks would have no
formal comment. The banks are said to have long ago reduced
their exposure by syndicating their Trump loans with other
banks.</p>
<p>The talks, which began about two weeks ago, are taking
place on the 26th floor of Trump Tower overlooking Central
Park. Each bank has a team of people attending the daily
meetings. On Friday, for example, there were 50 bankers and
lawyers from the banks in the room. Mr. Trump has usually
been present; he attended on Friday night until 8:30 p.m.,
when he flew to a boxing match he was promoting in Atlantic
City. Mr. Trump is being represented by several company
officials and attorneys and by the accounting firm of Kenneth
Leventhal & Co., which specializes in real-estate workouts.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, few have reveled more in
self-promotion and conspicuous consumption than Mr. Trump, a
man who has everything from casinos and condos to a board
game and a bicycle race named after him. He and his
now-estranged wife, Ivana, acquired a $30 million yacht, a $7
million oceanfront estate in Florida, a private helicopter
and a corporate jet. Unlike some other moguls' acquisitions,
Mr. Trump's were easy to track because he never seemed to
stop talking about them.</p>
<p>There was a method to Mr. Trump's self-aggrandizement: It
enabled him to borrow huge sums to buy properties that, he
convinced banks, would become much more valuable once he put
the Trump name on them. Thus, normal financial analysis could
be tossed out the window: Whether or not a property made
sense from a cash-flow perspective, Mr. Trump argued, was
largely irrelevant once it became a Trump property; he would
always be able to sell out for a big profit because he made
properties seem special.</p>
<p>For quite a while, that seemed to work. While other
developers sometimes struggled, people flocked to live and
shop in buildings with the magical Trump name: Trump Tower,
Trump Plaza, Trump Parc, to name a few. Even in the past
year's soft Northeast real-estate market, one-bedroom
apartments in the Trump Parc in New York sold for as much as
$600,000.</p>
<p>In recent months, while many go-go entrepreneurs either
voluntarily pulled back or were forced into retreat by the
collapse of the junk-bond market, Mr. Trump seemed unwilling
to concede that the roaring '80s and their prevailing
economics were becoming a thing of the past. He bought the
Eastern Shuttle airline in 1989 for $365 million, then this
year brushed aside a skeptical casino industry to open the $1
billion Taj Mahal, his third casino in a market some believed
was already at overcapacity.</p>
<p>By early this year, Mr. Trump's magic touch seemed to be
slipping. The weakening real-estate market made bankers less
willing to lend based on a property's theoretical resale
value. They now are insisting on strong cash flow, and at
some of Mr. Trump's properties, cash flow doesn't equal debt
payments. The shuttle, for example, has lost at least $85
million in the year since he bought it. And only two of Mr.
Trump's properties, the retail stores of Trump Tower and his
50%-owned Grand Hyatt, are expected by real-estate executives
to actually earn money after interest and principal payments
this year.</p>
<p>Earlier this year a plan to sell a portion of the Plaza
Hotel to Japanese investors fell apart when the Japanese
stock market plummeted. Mr. Trump has a $245 million mortgage
on the property from Citicorp and a $135 million loan from
the bank that he personally guaranteed. He is believed to
have made added borrowings to refurbish the property.</p>
<p>In April, Mr. Trump declared in an interview with this
newspaper that he was considering the sale of assets not out
of any weakness but because he wanted to become the "king of
cash" in order to be able to make new acquisitions. Mr. Trump
was so adamant in denying the existence of financial troubles
that he threatened to sue this newspaper if it reported that
he had cash-flow problems.</p>
<p>But so far, he isn't believed to have completed any sales.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump said in April that he would generate some cash
by replacing a $75 million Chase mortgage on Trump Tower with
a new $90 million mortgage from Prudential Insurance Co. of
America. Prudential declines to comment. Real-estate industry
executives say that deal has fallen through, as has a new
$200 million refinancing of Mr. Trump's stake in the Grand
Hyatt.</p>
<p>Last month, a plan to sell his much-publicized yacht, the
Trump Princess, to Japanese investors for $115 million also
came apart, people familiar with the talks say.</p>
<p>Mr. Trumps's efforts to sell the Trump Shuttle were thrown
into doubt last month by Pan Am Corp.'s announcement that it
plans to sell its own eastern-corridor shuttle. The Trump
Shuttle has a $245 million mortgage, and Mr. Trump has taken
out a personal loan with Citibank for about $135 million in
connection with the shuttle, according to knowledgeable
individuals.</p>
<p>In Atlantic City, the situation is also worsening. In the
first quarter of the year, the two casinos Mr. Trump was then
operating lost a total of $12 million, after interest on debt
was paid.</p>
<p>The Taj Mahal, which opened to great ballyhoo on April 2,
isn't doing as well as Trump officials had hoped. In May, its
first full month of operation, the Taj grossed $36.4 million,
or about $1.17 million a day. That figure falls short of the
$1.3 million a day he will need to break even, according to
industry analysts. What's more, April and May are generally
far better months for the casino industry than the winter
months.</p>
<p>Casino industry analysts expect as many as 2,000
additional layoffs at the Taj by the end of the summer. Mr.
Trump has delayed paying some suppliers and, according to two
contractors, has offered to pay some creditors just 70 cents
on the dollar.</p>
<p>Another continuing drain on Mr. Trump's assets is a vacant
72-acre parcel of land on the west side of Manhattan. Mr.
Trump has borrowed about $200 million from Chase Manhattan
Bank to carry that asset. His ambitious plans to build a
large-scale retail and residential complex that would include
the world's tallest building still await a lengthy approval
process by New York City. Even if the plans are approved, he
must face members of the West Side community, who have
threatened to sue to stop the project.</p>
<p>Even Mr. Trump's private life has lately become something
of a liability. It is unclear what portion of his empire
could be claimed by his wife in any future divorce action.
People close to Mr. Trump say he intends this week to ask for
a major reduction in the $25 million he previously agreed to
pay his wife in the event of a divorce. She is challenging
the prenuptial agreement, seeking a higher figure.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump has other legal problems as well. A
restructuring plan proposed by Resorts International Inc.,
which has sought bankruptcy-court protection, calls for a $5
million war chest to fund a possible fraudulent conveyance
action against Mr. Trump by Resorts bondholders.</p>
<p>Such a suit would allege, among other things, that when
Mr. Trump sold his interest in Resorts to Merv Griffin and
bought the unfinished Taj Mahal, Resorts wasn't left with
enough capital to operate. In an interview a month ago, Mr.
Trump said he would consider settling that case out of court
to avoid costly legal fees.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump has been sued by Pratt Hotels Corp. over his
purchase of a site adjacent to the Trump Plaza casino on the
Atlantic City boardwalk. Pratt claims Mr. Trump interfered
with its contract to purchase the parcel from Penthouse Corp.
Chairman Robert Guccione.</p>
<p>Officials of the four banks now negotiating with Mr. Trump
admit they don't have an easy task. They lent to Mr. Trump
for each new property he bought; the banks themselves are
having trouble agreeing on which assets should be sold
because each bank isn't party to each loan. As part of the
restructuring, the banks want to remedy this problem by
putting Mr. Trump's debt in a more consolidated form -- the
way an ordinary corporation would borrow --a nd eliminating
the numerous separate entities that he has borrowed through
previously.</p>
<p>What's more, since many of the banks involved don't lend
to casinos as a matter of policy, their bankers have had to
take crash courses in casino finance so they could fully
understand Mr. Trump's situation.</p>
<p>For his part, Mr. Trump doesn't seem ready to give in yet.
Last night, he was in Las Vegas for the American Booksellers
Association conference to promote his second book. His
publisher, Random House, says it is planning a first printing
of 500,000 copies. The title: "Trump: Surviving at the Top."</p>
