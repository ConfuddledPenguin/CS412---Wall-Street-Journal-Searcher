	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Robert Campeau and National Bank of Canada were
silent last week about whether Mr. Campeau had regained
control of Campeau Corp. by settling 153 million Canadian
dollars (US$130 million) of personal loans he owes the bank.
   Mr. Campeau, chairman and chief executive officer of the
real estate and retailing company, had until last Thursday to
come up with the first C$40 million payment on the loans,
after which National Bank would return Campeau shares it
seized from him in January. But the deadline passed without
comment from National Bank or Mr. Campeau.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>National Bank said last Thursday that it would comment on
the agreement the next day, but on Friday it said an
announcement wouldn't be forthcoming. Neither Mr. Campeau nor
his lawyer could be reached to comment. Campeau officials
said they didn't have any information on the status of the
agreement between Mr. Campeau and National Bank. The bank was
expected to announce that it had extended the deadline under
the agreement.</p>
<p>In January, the bank seized Campeau securities from Mr.
Campeau, claiming that he had defaulted on about C$153
million of personal loans, against which the securities were
pledged. The securities, which included 13 million Campeau
common shares, C$60.4 million of convertible debentures and
four million convertible preference shares, amounted to a 38%
stake in the company on a fully diluted basis. After the
seizure, Mr. Campeau's fully diluted stake in Campeau
dwindled to about 21% from 43%.</p>
<p>Under Mr. Campeau's agreement with National Bank, he was
to pay a further C$40 million by Jan. 31, 1992, or, failing
that, pledge the C$60.4 million of debentures back to the
bank. Mr. Campeau hasn't indicated whether he has financing
for the first C$40 million transaction.</p>
<p>Mr. Campeau's agreement with National Bank was crucial to
a vote last Friday by holders of Campeau's 7 1/2% debentures,
approving deferral of interest payments on the debentures
until Dec. 31, 1991. National Bank allowed him to vote the
C$60.4 million of debentures it holds, which, together with
his own stake in the issue, entitled him to vote a total of
42% of the debentures. The Reichmann family's Olympia & York
Developments Ltd., Toronto, which holds 25.3% of the
debentures, was viewed as supportive of the interest-deferral
resolution. With Olympia & York's support, Mr. Campeau
apparently had the assurance that holders of 67.3% of the
debentures agreed to the interest deferral.</p>
<p>Campeau officials said they were seeking agreements from
other creditors and debenture holders on deferrals of
interest payments. In March, Campeau stopped paying interest
on the 7 1/2% debentures and US$260 million of convertible
debentures held by Olympia & York. It also stopped paying
interest on US$225 million owed to Olympia & York and US$480
million owed to a Youngstown, Ohio-based developer, Edward J.
DeBartolo Corp.</p>
<p>Campeau plans to sell a substantial part of its Canadian
real estate assets to restructure the finances of its
Canadian operations, which it said have a "significant
negative cash flow." The Canadian parent company couldn't
meet interest payments on its debt after its U.S. retailing
units, Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores
Corp., sought protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in January.</p>
