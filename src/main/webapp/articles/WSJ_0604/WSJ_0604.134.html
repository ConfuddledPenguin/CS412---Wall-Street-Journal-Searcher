	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Savings-and-loan regulators took over First
Annapolis Savings Bank, Annapolis, Md., and placed it in the
government's program for failed institutions.
   First Annapolis had reported assets of $732.1 million and
negative tangible capital of $65.9 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Regulators also took over Investors of Florida Savings
Bank, Deerfield Park, Fla., and placed it in receivership.
The thrift had assets of $282.6 million and negative tangible
capital of $1.1 million.</p>
<p>Both institutions will be run under the direction of the
Resolution Trust Corp., the government agency set up last
year to sell off and liquidate hundreds of failed thrifts.</p>
<p>Separately, the RTC said it sold the deposits of
Spindletop Savings Association, Beaumont, Texas, to First
City, Texas Beaumont, also of Beaumont. Spindletop Savings
had total assets of $243.9 million and total liabilities of
$352.3 million.</p>
<p>First City will pay the RTC $10,000 to assume $288.1
million in 9,800 deposit accounts. First City will buy $22.4
million of Spindletop's assets and will have options to
acquire most of the remaining assets.</p>
<p>The RTC will give First City $271.9 million to back the
deposits and will retain $221.5 million of the assets. The
RTC expects its ultimate cost from the transaction to be
$250.1 million.</p>
