	<p class="article-leader">IMAGINE THE WORKPLACE of the future. Imagine an office
that's easy to reach, and not on the far side of a commute
that leaves your mind numb, your body shaken. Imagine an
office in which you feel totally at ease -- a place tailored
to your individual needs and tastes. Imagine an environment
where you feel free, and not like a prisoner enslaved by a
rigid schedule.
   Imagine your own home.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>More than nine million Americans already have a taste of
this workplace of the future, working at least part of the
week at home. But this number is likely to grow steadily in
the coming decade. And while few experts predict the demise
of the traditional office, most agree that in the future,
people's homes will play a larger role in the transaction of
America's business.</p>
<p>The implications of such a shift are profound,
dramatically affecting the way people work -- and live. Some
of the changes are obvious: the absence of commuting hassles,
for instance, or the added time available for families. But
in many ways, the more significant changes are the subtle
ones, the little things that make up the stuff of daily life.
What happens to office gossip or office politics? Where will
people assess Kim Basinger's Oscar couture and Donald Trump's
nuptials? How will managers take their employees' measure?
Where will people make friends? What about chance encounters
at the coffee cart that inspire big ideas?</p>
<p>None of this will disappear completely because most people
will go to an office periodically. But much will change. More
gossip and friendships will be conducted electronically. Work
hours will become more fluid, and managers will have to
rethink the traditional "eyeball" style of management. Chance
encounters will become more calculated. The refrigerator will
replace the cafeteria; living rooms will become lobbies. To
work at home, say those who do it, people are going to have
to retool their attitudes about status, privacy, trust and
the traditionally distinct border between home and office.</p>
<p>People who work at home successfully -- either as
telecommuters, independent contractors or entrepreneurs --
describe themselves as a self-disciplined breed who genuinely
enjoy work. "It's a myth that the best telecommuters are
anti-social hermits," says Gil Gordon, a consultant on
telecommuters, the name given to salaried employees who work
at home. "It's people who have social contact with friends
and neighbors, who have the self-discipline to stay away from
the refrigerator and who can negotiate some new rules with
the rest of the family."</p>
<p>For people like this, the motivating structure of an
office is not only irrelevant but also counterproductive. "I
don't like the petty politics of the office -- if I can avoid
it, I will," says Mark Brownstein, the Los Angeles bureau
chief of InfoWorld magazine, who works from home. "I'm a
little bit of a loner. I like what I'm doing so I can get out
of bed in the morning, grab a Diet Coke and go right into the
office. The only thing that distracts me from work is other
work."</p>
<p>Many people who work at home do so because of special
circumstances that might otherwise force them to quit their
jobs, especially a long commute. "The traffic problems we
used to think were only in L.A. and New York are virtually
everywhere," says Mr. Gordon. "It's becoming clear that we
can no longer move everyone to work without paving over the
whole country."</p>
<p>Many telecommuting arrangements are informal and
unofficial, a handshake between worker and supervisor. But a
growing number of companies and local governments are
beginning to experiment with telecommuting on a larger scale,
viewing it as an inexpensive way to recruit and retain valued
workers.</p>
<p>Many managers have to be convinced that allowing workers
to stay home isn't giving them permission to loll around in
their bathrobes watching "People's Court." Most managers say
the reverse is true: Home workers are more likely to show
compulsive tendencies than slothful ones. "Work bleeds into
suppertime," says Thomas E. Miller, a telecommuter and vice
president of Link Resources, which studies the
communications-technology market. "My kids begged me to
change jobs so they could see more of me."</p>
<p>Mr. Gordon says he knew of one worker who became so
engrossed doing computer programming at home that he would
work three, four, even five hours without interruption,
resulting in splitting headaches. The problem was solved with
a $19 clock radio set to go off every two hours, a signal for
him to take a break.</p>
<p>Even managers who approach the arrangement with enthusiasm
concede that it changes things. Claudia Cohl, editor in chief
of Home Office Computing magazine, manages several
telecommuters, including one who lives 400 miles from the
magazine's New York offices. "I see him less, but he's the
most productive person working for me," says Ms. Cohl.
"Projects that need concentrated effort I can give to him,
and they'll be great." Another plus: "He's not in my hair,
not appearing at my door every 10 minutes asking if he should
blow his nose. If he's having a neurotic fit, I don't have to
deal with it."</p>
<p>Crucial to a happy home worker is that the arrangement be
voluntary rather than forced. In fact, that's the norm now.
"There seems to be some Machiavellian notion that companies
are going to force people to work at home," says Kathleen
Christensen, director of the National Project on Home-Based
Work and an associate professor at City University of New
York. "In fact, companies are the major resisters of this.
American business figures if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
But if it's broke -- a valued employee needs flexibility -- a
manager may give it a try."</p>
<p>Experts in telecommuting say workers and managers need
special training in handling the new relationship. "We tell
the managers they have to change from being administrators to
being leaders," says Jack Nilles, a consultant on
telecommuting. "We tell them your job isn't to act as a cop
but as a goal setter and motivator. We force the manager and
the telecommuter to figure out what each expects of the
other. We get them to agree on goals and set a detailed
schedule." Mr. Nilles concedes that managers of telecommuters
feel "a slight increase" in their workload, but he says these
managers also report feeling that their own performance has
risen.</p>
<p>Managers agree that some jobs are more conducive to
telecommuting than others. "The suitable ones have clearly
defined tasks," says Steve Coulter, an area vice president
for Pacific Bell, who telecommutes and also manages other
telecommuters. Furthermore, Mr. Coulter and other managers
say such arrangements should only be offered to proven
performers who communicate well with their colleagues.</p>
<p>Echoing other managers, Mr. Coulter says it's crucial for
telecommuters to spend some time each week in the office.
"It's difficult to build a relationship, a sense of identity
and camaraderie on-line," he says, "and people don't want to
be forgotten at promotion time. Once people have an identity
as a work group, I don't think it makes any difference where
they work. But they have to come together sometimes."</p>
<p>Home workers, their managers and consultants say it's yet
not clear whether raises and promotions will be handed out as
freely to invisible workers as they are to the visible ones.
"If upward mobility is their No. 1 priority in life, I can't
guarantee that telecommuting won't affect that," says Mr.
Gordon.</p>
<p>Ms. Cohl says she suspects that even for the most
enlightened managers, telecommuting will affect employees'
chances for advancement. "I can't put someone who works at
home in a management job," she says. "But you make a decision
that's how you want to live. The manager has to keep in mind
what the employee is doing and is it exceptional. The
relationship is much more task-oriented."</p>
<p>Telecommuters know they have to beware of falling off the
radar screen. Some managers say that to compensate for their
absence, telecommuters are more aggressive about keeping in
touch with office politics than other employees. "You have to
remind people of what you want to do," says Nick Sullivan,
who telecommutes to Home Office Computing magazine. "You
can't expect the bosses to sit there with some opportunity
and think, oh yeah, how about that guy sitting up in the
woods. I try to keep my foot in the door and my two cents
floating around."</p>
<p>One of the hardest adjustments for many home workers is
the absence of a clear boundary between work and home, a
function traditionally served by catching a train or hitting
the freeway. In extreme cases, home workers get in their
cars, drive around the block and enter their homes through a
different door to convince themselves that now they're at
work. Mr. Miller says he occasionally drives to a diner, eats
breakfast, reads the newspaper and drives home. Mr. Miller
doesn't dress up for work, but, like most other home workers,
he can't take himself seriously in pajamas.</p>
<p>Once in the home office, the salutations and small talk
traditionally exchanged over partitions now flash across
computer screens or telephone lines. Many home workers begin
their days by checking their electronic mail, or e-mail, and
voice mail. Some of it involves business, but much of it is
social chatter. "I talk sports on voice mail," says Mr.
Miller. "There's an office betting pool on football on voice
mail. And every Monday morning, I call a friend on voice mail
and talk about some of the games."</p>
<p>Mr. Sullivan says his water cooler is the nationwide
personal-computer network called CompuServe. "I sign on to
CompuServe, the working-from-home forum, which is like
listening to talk radio while commuting to work," says Mr.
Sullivan. "It's like seeing people I know even though I've
never met them. I do it every day, it serves as a way of
getting me into the workday. It's the break between breakfast
and real work."</p>
<p>All day long, home workers communicate with friends and
colleagues by writing or reading something on a computer
screen. Without the visual and tactile cues of a raised
eyebrow or a forgiving pat on the shoulder, words on the
computer screen become more intense, more susceptible to
misinterpretation. So some visual signals have been assigned
symbols. For example, ;-) means a wink, and :-) means a grin.
The use of capital letters is discouraged: IT LOOKS AS THOUGH
SOMEONE'S SHOUTING.</p>
<p>"You use language differently," says Stephen Jenks, a
management consultant with the Portsmouth Consulting Group,
who works at home. "I tell everyone if you sense in the word
or tone that someone's angry, ask. They'll probably say I'm
not angry, I'm just excited. But it's not as easy to tell
when you can't look them in the eye."</p>
<p>Mr. Jenks is intimately familiar with the art of computer
interaction. Nine years ago, when he decided to start his
consulting venture, Mr. Jenks chose 16 people to join him.
Unfortunately, his choices were scattered across the country,
and Mr. Jenks knew that few, if any, would be willing to
relocate. So he formed a company without a central office. He
and his colleagues, one of whom lives in a touring motor
home, physically gather only three times a year. The rest of
the time they communicate on a computer conferencing system.</p>
<p>Like other home workers, Mr. Jenks initially grappled with
the problem of having a secretary work in his home with him.
"I hated it," Mr. Jenks says. "I said, `I can't stand having
you underfoot.' And she felt she was invading my house." So
Mr. Jenks found two other people who needed similar
secretarial services, and the woman set herself up in her own
home as a telecommuting secretary.</p>
<p>Ken Greenberg, now a senior account manager for Bohle Co.
in Los Angeles and formerly a telecommuter, says he found it
unsettling to have people with whom he was doing business
come to his home. "It was extremely awkward," he says. "I had
senior executives walking around my living room, and I would
be dressed schlumpily."</p>
<p>In general, Mr. Greenberg found the whole experience of
telecommuting disagreeable. "You want to keep the same pace,
the same relationships with your colleagues and bosses, but
you can't do it," says Mr. Greenberg. "Many motivated people
would tend to overcompensate by taking the 8 p.m. phone
call."</p>
<p>Indeed, the timing of phone calls is a thorny issue,
reflecting the ingrained doubt and guilt of each party. "One
of the first barriers I had to get over was, Could I bother
him at home?" says Ms. Cohl about Mr. Sullivan. "If I called
him at night, I thought it was terrible. And what if I called
him during the day and he wasn't there?"</p>
<p>Mr. Sullivan felt a similar anxiety. "If I had to go out
to do errands, I would feel I had to leave an excuse on the
answering machine, accounting for my time," he says. "Then
you go to the office, and people are off getting their hair
done."</p>
<p>People who mingle home and work under one roof say it can
become almost impossible to keep them apart. "There's that
sense that it's always here," says Peggy Hatch, who, with her
husband, runs a small business from their Stamford, Conn.,
home. "To not feel guilty is hard. It's hard to relax. For us
to relax, we have to leave the house." One weekend the
Hatches, determined to do other things, declared their
basement office off-limits and managed to stay out of it. "We
were only able to exercise that self-restraint once," Ms.
Hatch says.</p>
<p>Many home workers say they have invented elaborate rules
and methods for keeping home and work apart. "I don't make a
few phone calls and then put a load of laundry in," says
Linda Ragle, a regional sales manager who telecommutes for
Oriflame International, a skin-care company. "I keep regular
hours, and I'm either home with my family or I'm in
business."</p>
<p>Ms. Ragle, who couldn't think of a single nice thing to
say about working in an office, says an additional benefit of
working at home is that her children learned to value and
respect Mom's work. But first, Ms. Ragle, like other home
workers, had to tame her family's impulse to think they could
barge into her office at will. "We had a joke that they could
only interrupt me in case of an emergency," Ms. Ragle says.
"That was defined as something involving blood or smoke --
and a lot of it."</p>
