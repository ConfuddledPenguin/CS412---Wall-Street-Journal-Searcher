	<p class="article-leader">NEWARK, N.J. -- The federal government filed suit in U.S.
District Court here, charging that a predecessor of the New
York-based securities firm Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings
Inc. improperly disbursed the proceeds of an account.
   The government claims that the account was put up as
security for two loans, totaling $602,000, that the Small
Business Administration made to Connecticut Aerosols Inc.,
Milford, Conn. Terms of the loans, which were made to the
company in 1975 and 1978, required that at least $275,882 be
left in the account until the loans were paid, the complaint
states.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Connecticut Aerosols and its president, John J. Franchini,
defaulted on the loans, the civil action alleges. The SBA
sought the account's proceeds, the complaint charges, but
Shearson or its predecessor, E.F. Hutton & Co., "liquidated
the account and paid" the proceeds to Mr. Franchini "or
otherwise disbursed" them.</p>
<p>Shearson has refused to make any payment to the
government, the complaint states. The suit demands that
Shearson pay the remaining principal and accrued interest on
the loans as of Feb. 1 -- a total $405,006 -- plus the
interest accrued since then.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Shearson said the firm, a subsidiary of
American Express Co., New York, hadn't seen the complaint and
couldn't comment. Mr. Franchini couldn't be reached for
comment.</p>
