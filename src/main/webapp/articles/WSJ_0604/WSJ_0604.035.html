	<p class="article-leader">HONG KONG -- How does Hong Kong feel about China a year
after the Beijing government brutally crushed the democracy
movement and slaughtered hundreds, perhaps thousands, of
citizens?
   One sentence sums it up: Even Xu Jiatun has run away.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Xu was China's highest-ranking representative here
from 1983 until early this year. In late April, after his
"retirement," he secretly made his way back to Hong Kong,
obtained an American visa and went to California. He went
without the consent of Beijing.</p>
<p>As China's top representative here, Mr. Xu had one
all-important duty: Persuade the people of Hong Kong to
accept the "one country, two systems" blueprint for the
future. It was an uphill battle, but Mr. Xu was convincing.
He appealed to people to remain in Hong Kong and called on
those who chose emigration to return after they had obtained
permanent residency overseas. He insisted that after 1997
there would be no change to their freedoms, laws or human
rights. To bolster his assurances, Mr. Xu declared that China
itself was now learning from capitalism.</p>
<p>Prior to June 1989, Hong Kong people believed Britain had
negotiated the colony's return to a China that was opening to
the outside world and undergoing reform, a country that would
enjoy increasing political and economic liberalization. June
4 changed all that; it revealed that Britain had made a pact
with a vicious communist power.</p>
<p>Although China's general policy toward Hong Kong has not
changed in the past year, there has been a disturbing amount
of fine-tuning. Take the promise, "Hong Kong people ruling
Hong Kong." In both the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration
and the Basic Law (Hong Kong's post-1997 mini-constitution),
"Hong Kong people" are defined as those with permanent
residency here. Recently, however, Zhou Nan, Mr. Xu's
successor, added five prescriptive elements to this
definition. Hong Kong people must be patriotic, love Hong
Kong, support national reunification, support the Basic Law,
and not possess foreign residency status. On another
occasion, Chinese officials defined "patriotic" as being
loyal to the present rulers in China.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu used to say that he hoped people with foreign
passports would return to work in Hong Kong. Now, Chinese
officials say that Hong Kong people with full British
citizenship, if they reside in Hong Kong after 1997, will be
regarded as citizens of China. As such, their right to
British consular protection will not be recognized.
Naturally, this leaves all Hong Kong Chinese with passports
from any foreign country with little choice but to quit the
territory before 1997.</p>
<p>Some British parliamentarians have concocted a bill
whereby 220,000 Hong Kong people have been granted full
rights of residency in Britain. A Bill of Rights that
theoretically would override other local laws even after 1997
has been mooted. Some people even want to accelerate the pace
of democratization and establish a democratic system before
1997. But none of these gestures has done much to boost
confidence here.</p>
<p>Hong Kong people are convinced things will get worse; but
if they could only get some idea of just how much worse, many
would still decide to remain after 1997. If they knew, for
example, that there would be no free press, no free speech
and no democracy, but that other freedoms -- such as basic
human rights and the rule of law -- would be preserved, I
believe many still would prefer to stay.</p>
<p>Many who aren't in a position to emigrate now are
desperately trying to make as much money as they can so they
can qualify as investment immigrants. In such an atmosphere,
extreme greed has become an overriding motivation.</p>
<p>But the greed pales in comparison to personal tales of
people who fear for the future and are trying to flee in any
way they can. Lovers in long-term relationships break up,
each searching for a partner who can assure a foreign
passport. Families pack aged parents off to old people's
homes, making it easier for them to emigrate. Parents abandon
mentally and physically handicapped children, barred by many
countries from immigrating. Far more common are cases of
couples who have been separated for some time -- one living
and working in Hong Kong while the other waits for permanent
residence status overseas -- finally splitting up.</p>
<p>Hong Kong society is renowned for being law-abiding and
stable. Hong Kong business people and professionals are
enterprising, daring, inventive and adaptable. Hong Kong
workers are famed for their industriousness, professionalism
and level of education. But all of these outstanding
qualities have begun to lose their luster now that we live in
the grisly shadow of June 4 and await with fear the prospects
of 1997. The genius of Hong Kong society has nosedived.</p>
<p>One could compare Hong Kong to a seaworthy vessel. After
the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, this ship set course
for a volcanic island. The volcano was known to be active,
but as it had remained dormant for years, many people thought
it unlikely it would ever erupt again. Those who were less
confident slipped away silently on small boats, paddling off
with all their might. Then along came the murderous eruption
of June 4. The passengers on the ship no longer have any
confidence. Disorder is breaking out below decks, and the
passengers are scared that there won't be any lifeboats. They
fear that long before they reach their destination, the ship
will have been scuttled by its own hands.</p>
