	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Two of Japan's major international trading
companies reported substantially increased net income for the
year ended March 31.
   C. Itoh & Co.'s consolidated earnings rose 15% to 35.13
billion yen ($230.8 million), or 24.27 yen a share, from
30.44 billion yen, or 24.01 yen a share, in fiscal 1989.
Operating profit rose 11% to 117.42 billion yen from 106.29
billion yen. The companies in the consolidated results rose
to 692 from 628. Sales climbed 31% to 20.998 trillion yen
from 16.05 trillion yen.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>C. Itoh said strong personal spending, capital investment
and construction industry growth in Japan helped the company
expand its domestic and import transactions of machinery,
construction equipment, ores and metals, and energy products.
Favorable economic conditions in the U.S., Europe and Asia
also contributed to the improved results.</p>
<p>Nissho Iwai Corp.'s profit surged 42% to a record 18.43
billion yen ($121 million), or 25.91 yen a share, from 13
billion yen, or 19.63 yen a share. Sales climbed 35% to
15.442 trillion yen from 11.447 trillion yen.</p>
<p>Despite the strong sales, administrative and marketing
costs grew 12% to 156.43 billion yen and put pressure on
earnings. Yet net income shot up, as extraordinary losses
plunged 72% to 3.91 billion yen. Interest receipts surged 51%
to 182.75 billion yen; while interest payments rose 43% to
208.4 billion yen.</p>
