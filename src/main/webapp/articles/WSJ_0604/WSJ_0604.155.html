	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Japan said its current international payments
account surplus narrowed sharply in April, an announcement
that is likely to heat up a simmering policy debate over the
country's need for such surpluses.
   The Finance Ministry said the country's unadjusted
current-account surplus, which measures trade in goods and
services, was only $2.0 billion in April, off a sharp 70%
from $6.58 billion a year earlier and an even steeper 76%
from $8.3 billion in March. The country's overall trade
surplus shrank 50% to $4.02 billion in April from $8.10
billion in April 1989.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The rapidly diminishing surpluses will add impetus to an
ongoing government review of its policy of reducing such
surpluses, which in the past have generated huge amounts of
capital for Japan Inc. On Friday, Finance Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto said he welcomed a report from a government
advisory panel that said Japan must determine an
"appropriate" level for its surpluses -- suggesting that
official acceptance of such surpluses might be near.</p>
<p>Until recently, severe trade frictions, chiefly with the
U.S. and Europe, have sustained the policy. But a looming
international capital shortage, caused by the huge cost of
reunifying Germany, rebuilding Eastern Europe and covering
chronic U.S. budget deficits, has prompted the government
here to consider altering its policies to preserve the
surpluses.</p>
<p>Such a change in policy could inflame tensions with trade
groups and some politicians in the U.S. After battling Japan
for years to trim its persistent surpluses, Americans may
resent a switch to what effectively would be an endorsement
of perennial imbalances.</p>
<p>In Paris this past Thursday, the first sign of resistance
came from Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who warned
against confusing the need for capital in Eastern Europe with
the need to reduce external surpluses.</p>
<p>On Friday, the American Electronics Association sent a
note to U.S. journalists in Tokyo noting that the Japanese
study panel's conclusion that a current-account surplus was
necessary was "likely to cause comment" in the U.S.</p>
<p>The report, issued Thursday by a special advisory council
to Japan's Finance Ministry, said that Japan may have to
assume a role as a global creditor nation. That would entail
keeping its surplus, which the panel said was likely anyway
in light of Japan's industrial prowess. Japan's
current-account surplus already has shrunk to about 2% of
total economic output, the panel noted, from 4.3%, and no
longer can "be considered a cause of world economic
disorder."</p>
<p>The report echoed the conclusion of an International
Monetary Fund economic survey that Japan's current-account
surplus and high domestic savings rate might be desirable to
help cover capital shortages elsewhere in the world.</p>
<p>The sharp decline in the current account during April
isn't likely to last. The Finance Ministry ascribed the
decline to a plunge in automobile exports, together with a
sharp rise in aircraft imports.</p>
<p>The decline in automobile exports was due in part to
aggressive localization of production by Japanese
manufacturers. Auto exports were down 19% in April from the
year earlier, the first time in 20 years that levels have
dropped so drastically.</p>
<p>The yen's weakness also was a factor. During April, the
dollar traded at an average of 157.20 yen, compared with
132.12 yen in April 1989, a 16% depreciation. Although the
yen also fell in January and February 1990, a ministry
official said April's 16% devaluation was particularly
"unusual." In the long run, a weaker yen tends to make
Japan's products cheaper to buyers overseas and could help
exports, but in the short run it reduces the dollar value of
Japan's export figures.</p>
