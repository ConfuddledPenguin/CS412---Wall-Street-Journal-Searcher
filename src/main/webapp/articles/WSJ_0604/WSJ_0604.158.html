	<p class="article-leader">ACTON, Mass. -- CML Group Inc. said third-quarter net
income dropped 10%, while sales rose 10% to $58 million, from
$52.7 million a year ago.
   Separately, the company told analysts that following weak
sales growth in February and March, sales rebounded sharply
in April and May, rising 23% and 25%, respectively, from
year-earlier levels.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The direct marketer of consumer products said earnings,
including discontinued operations, for the quarter ended
April 28, fell to $2.5 million, or 38 cents a share, compared
with $2.3 million, or 35 cents a share, in the year-earlier
quarter.</p>
<p>Profit from continuing operations in the third quarter
fell sharply, to $1.7 million, or 26 cents a share, from a
year-ago $3.8 million, or 59 cents a share. CML sold its
Carol Reed unit in February and the Boston Whaler power boat
company last August.</p>
<p>"CML has turned the corner -- and their numbers were right
on the button, for a change," said Harry E. Wells, an analyst
with Adams Harkness & Hill, Boston. "Things are really
looking up."</p>
<p>CML Chairman Charles M. Leighton said that while the
softness in income was anticipated, NordicTrack and the
Nature Company performed ahead of expectations. But he added
that the "continued sluggishness of the retail apparel
environment" hurt the performance of the Britches of
Georgetown group of stores.</p>
<p>CML also said it has gained a foothold in the Far East
with the signing of an agreement with the retail subsidiary
of the West Japan Railway System to begin opening CML's
Nature Company stores in Japan. The flagship store will open
in Osaka in May 1991, CML said.</p>
<p>The move will be CML's first foray into international
markets. Mr. Leighton said he felt Japan will be "a perfect
market" for Nature Company stores. Payment will be on a
royalty basis, CML said.</p>
<p>For the nine months ended April 28, net income was
$664,000, or 10 cents a share, including discontinued
operations, compared with $11.1 million, or $1.71 a share,
for the year-ago period. Sales rose to $217.9 million, from
$187.8 million in the same period last year. Income from
continuing operations for the nine months rose to $14.6
million, or $2.20 a share, from year-ago $13.7 million, or
$2.10.</p>
