	<p class="article-leader">NEARLY 30 YEARS after its introduction, the "open plan"
continues to dominate the office landscape. But open offices,
which use panels to create a maze of work stations, have
never fully lived up to their billing. One advertised
advantage was flexibility, but hardly anyone moves those
panels, especially with today's computerized work stations
that are rooted to the floor. And many workers find the open
plan inhospitable -- naked, noisy and institutional looking.
   So what's next? What will the office look like in 10 to 15
years? The Wall Street Journal put that question to four
design professionals who specialize in the workplace, and
their visions are presented here.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Although their predictions are by no means identical, a
few themes recur. Flexibility is still a goal, not only so an
office can be rearranged as needs change but also to
accommodate "flextime" workers who write their own schedules.
Work stations will go portable, growing wheels or shrinking
to fit in an attache case. Work will occur in a greater
variety of settings. Teamwork will be more common, and
offices will provide for small groups to work on temporary
projects, then disband. And work spaces will be more homelike
and personal, even allowing workers to control their own
light, heat and air.</p>
<p>But how much of this is really new? One of the Journal's
authorities suggests, tongue only partly in cheek, that the
office of the future could be found almost two centuries ago,
at Monticello.</p>
<p>Working Together</p>
<p>Perhaps the most striking feature of this busy office is
that workers are on flexible schedules and don't "own" a
designated work space. A worker arrives at the office, checks
out a file pedestal from storage and wheels it to a vacant
post.</p>
<p>Michael H. Bourque, senior vice president of Earl R.
Flansburgh+Associates, Inc., Boston, says other employee,
operational and technology issues influenced the design. The
offices at the top are private, but with their hublike desks
and big electronic displays they accommodate the kind of
participatory decision making that Mr. Bourque expects to go
along with tomorrow's more decentralized management. Hubs in
the general work area below facilitate teamwork and encourage
quick, informal meetings and spontaneous exchanges between
workers. "The whole layout is focused on the hubs as work
centers," he says, "not on looking out the window."</p>
<p>One informal meeting place, at the lower right, has a
large marking board, a television screen and a computer
display. "Those people could be holding a meeting with
workers in another part of the world, right out there in the
open," says Mr. Bourque.</p>
<p>"Some things you can't see in the drawing are the computer
tie-ins to people working at home and the `smart' building
systems, where lighting, temperature and air quality are tied
to sensors that respond to human activity."</p>
<p>Work on Wheels</p>
<p>Flexibility and individual environmental control are the
main features of this work station by the Center for Building
Performance and Diagnostics at Carnegie Mellon University in
Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>The unit can be docked into a permanent "cave" that
resembles a conventional work station, be wheeled to group
sessions in a "cove," or stand alone, perhaps in a quiet
corner or even outdoors on a patio. The work station has its
own computer, telephone, lights, heat panel and ventilation
filters. To hook up to the building's electricity, air
conditioning and other utilities, it plugs into a port in the
office floor.</p>
<p>"Most building innovations over the past 80 years, like
central air conditioning and fluorescent lighting, have
tended to centralize environmental control and take it out of
the hands of the individual worker," says Volker Hartkopf,
professor of architecture at Carnegie and director of the
center. "This unit gives control back to the worker. It will
monitor environmental conditions like temperature and light
and display them on the screen. The worker can change them,
or the computer can `learn' what conditions an individual
prefers and adjust automatically."</p>
<p>Prof. Hartkopf says the center will build its own new
facility next year, incorporating this system and other
innovations.</p>
<p>Attache Office</p>
<p>"The office is an information process not restricted to
place," says Leonard B. Kruk, head of the business education
department at the University of Georgia in Athens and
director of the Office of Syntonics Research at Shaw-Walker
Co., Muskegon, Mich.</p>
<p>Mr. Kruk calls this concept, which so far exists only on
paper, the Transtechexec 2000+. It allows a worker to
communicate by voice and fax over a cellular network and to
write on a keyboard or tablet.</p>
<p>When the peripatetic worker finally drops by the office,
the attache case would be plugged into a desk unit. That,
according to Mr. Kruk, would provide larger display screens,
more computer memory, and a direct link to corporate data
bases and video conference facilities.</p>
<p>William Stumpf, another designer who thinks about the
workplace, believes this kind of portable office makes sense
for "entrepreneurial types, like Steve Jobs. I'm talking
about people who don't make much fuss about their physical
space. They might work in an office or a garage. They're
always working, and their office is wherever they happen to
be."</p>
<p>Back to the Future</p>
<p>Offices of the future will be much more diverse, both
within traditional facilities and in new kinds of facilities,
according to Duncan B. Sutherland Jr., an associate vice
president of Fitch RichardsonSmith, Worthington, Ohio, and a
member of that company's Exploratory Design Lab. And the
spaces will be much more adapted to individual needs. In
fact, he believes many workers will actively participate in
designing their own spaces. The distinction between home and
office, Mr. Sutherland says, is likely to become blurred.</p>
<p>In that regard, Mr. Sutherland notes that Thomas Jefferson
was ahead of his time. America's third president designed an
integrated office-bedroom at Monticello that apparently fit
his way of working. It also anticipated many features that
have become commonplace in today's offices. Among the
innovations Mr. Sutherland finds are "early ergonomic
seating" (a swivel chair and hassock), task lighting (candles
on the arms of the chair), a data base (a lazy Susan
bookstand that allowed Jefferson to "access" four books at
once) and a personal copying machine (a pantograph on the
table in front of the chair).</p>
<p>"The office of the future might be right under our noses,
if we simply look for it," says Mr. Sutherland.</p>
