	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- After giving up on a possible rescue package to
be worked out with creditors, troubled financial-services
concern British & Commonwealth Holdings PLC agreed to "enter
administration," which is comparable to U.S. Chapter 11
bankruptcy proceedings.
   On Friday, following unsuccessful negotiations with banks,
Britain's Securities and Investment Board removed B&C from
the list of financial concerns where other regulated
financial houses can place client money. The SIB, after
consulting with the Bank of England, explained in a brief
statement that it took the unusual step "as a matter of
urgency in consultation with the other regulators concerned,
in the interests of investor protection."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>British & Commonwealth began to teeter in April when it
was forced to write off #550 million ($923.2 million) in
losses at its Atlantic Computers PLC unit. It placed the unit
in the hands of an independent administrator.</p>
<p>Exco International PLC, a B&C subsidiary acquired in late
1986, won't be part of the proceedings, but will be spun off
sometime this summer. Exco deals in money brokerage, foreign
exchange and money markets around the world. It hasn't been
affected by B&C's problems and has maintained its own capital
base separate from the parent company.</p>
<p>Richard Lacy, chairman of Exco, said a "management buy-out
is the most likely outcome," but he left open the possibility
the company might be merged into another financial concern."
It's expected that Exco would be acquired for about #200
million ($340 million).</p>
