	<p class="article-leader">MILWAUKEE -- Hiring plans by U.S. employers continue to be
modest, although activity in the Midwest and Southwest is
stronger than elsewhere, according to a Manpower Inc. survey.
   The employment services concern said its latest quarterly
survey of 15,000 companies found that 27% plan to enlarge
their work forces in the third quarter, while 8% plan
reductions.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The figures are the weakest for any third quarter since
1986, Manpower said. They are barely more positive than the
results for the second quarter, when 26% of the employers
anticipated hiring and 8% foresaw reductions.</p>
<p>The survey found big differences in the outlook from
region to region. "The current employment outlook really
depends on where you live," said Mitchell S. Fromstein,
Manpower's president.</p>
<p>Activity appears strong in the Midwest and Southwest, he
said, but there is "a very visible weakness" in the
Northeast, where only 21% of companies polled expect to
increase hiring and 10% plan cuts. The comparable figures
were 29% and 7% in the 1989 third quarter. In the Midwest and
West, hiring projections are ahead of second-quarter levels
and only marginally below last year's.</p>
<p>Industries with the most active hiring plans are in the
construction and services groups, where activity is
traditionally brisk in the summer, and in the wholesale and
retail trades, which have recovered some of the strength they
lost in the second quarter.</p>
<p>Manufacturing shows further softness, meanwhile, and the
finance, insurance and real estate sector continues to slow
down. That sector has been showing a year-by-year
deterioration in hiring plans since 1986. For the coming
three months, only 19% of those companies expect to add
staff, the lowest figure since early 1983, while 8% plan
cutbacks.</p>
