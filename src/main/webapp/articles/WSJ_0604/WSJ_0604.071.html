	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Attorney General Dick Thornburgh authorized
two Las Vegas newspapers to combine their business
operations, the Justice Department said.
   The Las Vegas Sun and Las Vegas Review Journal will
combine business operations but maintain separate editorial
and reporting staffs. Such joint operating arrangements are
allowed under the Newspaper Preservation Act, which provides
for exceptions to federal antitrust restrictions in the
interest of preserving struggling newspapers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In applying for the antitrust exemption, the two
newspapers asserted that the Sun is a "failing newspaper" and
thus deserves special treatment. The Justice Department's
antitrust division had recommended that the attorney general
approve the joint operating arrangement without holding an
evidentiary hearing.</p>
