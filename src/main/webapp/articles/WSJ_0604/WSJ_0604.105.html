	<div class="article-body"><p>East Germany said it shut down another reactor at a
Soviet-designed nuclear power plant because of safety
deficiencies.</p>
<p>Environmental Minister Karl-Hermann Steinberg criticized
management of the Greifswald plant, near the Baltic Sea, for
permitting operation of a reactor even though a leak had been
discovered in its "cleaning system." The reactor was "shut
down because of grave safety deficiencies," he said.</p>
<p>Two of the plant's four reactors had been shut down early
this year for safety reasons. The remaining reactor, which
has been upgraded, will be closed down in December, the
minister said.</p>
<p>Mr. Steinberg didn't provide details, but news reports
have said the plant was sloppily managed and poorly
constructed.</p>
<p>WORLD'S AIDS CASES RISE</p>
<p>World-wide cases of AIDS rose by nearly 9,000 in May,
mostly in the U.S. and Africa, reaching a global total of
263,051 cases in 156 countries, the World Health Organization
said. The U.S. recorded 6,309 new cases, raising its overall
tally to 132,436. There were 903 new cases in Africa, 690 of
them in Congo, bringing the continent's total to 64,475.
European cases increased by 1,125 to 35,021. France alone
accounted for 835 more cases, lifting its total to 9,718,
highest in the region.

<p>VENEZUELAN SUBSIDIES</p>
<p>Venezuela will more than double transport subsidies to
some three million workers to soften the effects of proposed,
and widely opposed, gasoline-price increase. Workers earning
less than $195 per month -- about half the labor force --
will see their $4.25 monthly transport subsidy raised to
$10.63 by June 30, Planning Minister Miguel Rodriguez said.
The domestic price of gas is expected to increase by 36%.</p>
<p>JAPAN-SIBERIA PIPELINE</p>
<p>The Soviet Union asked Japan to cooperate in a plan to
build a 3,100-mile gas pipeline, partly undersea, between
Siberia and Japan. Soviet officials told Shintaro Abe, former
secretary-general of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party,
that the pipeline would connect the gas field in western
Siberia to Japan via North and South Korea, said a spokesman
for Mr. Abe's office. The Soviet side said it had already
received a positive reaction from both Koreas and that the
U.S. had also shown interest in participating in construction
of the project, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>SOUTH AFRICAN SECURITIES BILL</p>
<p>South Africa's parliament is considering a bill aimed at
tightening legislation on insider trading in the nation's
securities markets. The bill is designed to strengthen the
powers of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and the police to
prosecute offenders. The new proposals clarify the
circumstances under which possession or use of unpublished
price-sensitive information is considered illegal. Under
existing legislation, no prosecutions have ever been brought
against insider trading.</p>
<p>GERMANY BANS BRITISH BEEF</p>
<p>West Germany and Luxembourg joined France in banning
British beef imports because of the "mad cow" virus that has
killed thousands of British cattle, while the European
Community offered to buy 20,600 tons of meat to support
Britain's troubled cattle industry. French officials had said
some of the British meat might be tainted by the disease.
West Germany -- which already had barred imports of British
beef still on the bone -- emulated France by extending the
ban to canned beef as well. London accused both France and
Germany of seeking to protect their beef industries and of
exaggerating their concern for public health.</p>
<p>CHINESE PROTEST</p>
<p>China's central bank has reportedly ordered its public
companies to suspend doing business with Bank of Tokyo Ltd.
in an apparent protest against the Japanese bank's plan to
open a representative office in Taiwan.</p>
<p>A Japanese news report, quoting international banking
sources, said the People's Bank of China also called for the
suspension of staff exchanges between the Bank of Tokyo and
Chinese banks and other financial institutions.</p>
<p>The Bank of Tokyo and other Japanese banks have been
trying recently to expand into Taiwan by taking advantage of
that country's plans to give foreign banks greater access to
the long-protected banking market. Currently, only Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank Ltd., among Japanese banks, has a branch in
Taiwan, as the number of foreign banks there has been limited
to one per country since 1959.</p>
<p>In another Taiwan-related matter, China strongly
criticized the West African state of Guinea Bissau for
recognizing the Taiwan government. Beijing also accused
Taiwan of launching a "dollar offensive" to secure diplomatic
relations with small, destitute countries.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>Tehran is draped in black for a week of state mourning to
mark the death a year ago yesterday of the Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini. Millions of Iranians are expected to gather today
at Khomeini's grave just outside the capital. . . . Roland
Dorn, a West German art expert attending a symposium on van
Gogh in England, told the Times of London there were 20 to 30
paintings officially attributed to van Gogh that are fakes.
Other art historians described the claim as exaggerated.</p>
