	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Growth in private employment has nearly come
to a halt in the past three months, suggesting widespread
stagnation in the U.S. economy.
   The Labor Department's latest job statistics paint
virtually the weakest private employment picture since the
economy began expanding in December 1982.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Payrolls in private industry barely grew in May, after
shrinking by 125,000 workers in April and staying essentially
flat in March, the department said. But because the
government hired 145,000 temporary census workers in May, the
nation's civilian unemployment rate declined a notch, to 5.3%
of the work force from 5.4% in April. Including the military,
the unemployment rate held steady at 5.3% last month.</p>
<p>"I believe that labor market developments over recent
months are now fairly clear," the commissioner of labor
statistics, Janet Norwood, told Congress after the report's
release. "Employment growth has been very slow, and what
growth there has been was concentrated in a very few
industries. The job market has been bolstered only by census
hiring."</p>
<p>The job figures, which provided the government's first
reading of the country's economic strength in May, signaled
continued frailty in the U.S. economy, economists said. But
whether the stagnation in private employment will persist
remains in question, and few economists yet believe the
country is on the verge of a recession.</p>
<p>"The economy, though not in danger of a recession, is very
flat," said Lynn Reaser, senior economist at First Interstate
Bancorp in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Most economists view employment as a lagging indicator of
economic strength because many companies are loath to trim
their work forces until they are certain that conditions
require it.</p>
<p>An index compiled by a private group, the National
Association of Purchasing Managers, suggested that
manufacturing, the weakest spot in the U.S. economy for some
time, could be headed up.</p>
<p>While the purchasing managers, like the government,
reported that manufacturing employment declined in May, the
group's index of overall manufacturing health rose to 50.7%
during the month, the highest reading since April 1989.</p>
<p>The association says a reading above 50% signals the
manufacturing economy is generally growing. In April the
index increased to 50.2%, the first time it had crossed the
50% threshold since May 1989.</p>
<p>Despite the further improvement last month, Robert J.
Bretz of Pitney Bowes Inc., the association's chairman, said
the reading "does not necessarily say we're going to race off
into another overheated economy." He concluded, "It's still
very modest growth."</p>
<p>Though the purchasing managers' index is merely based on
survey responses from purchasing executives in about 300
companies, the financial markets watch it closely because it
is one of the first measures of economic activity for any
month.</p>
<p>The new employment report also contained a few hints of
vim in manufacturing. The average factory employee worked 0.4
hour a week longer than in the month before. "It's surprising
to see that big of an increase," said Alan Levenson, director
of financial services at the WEFA Group, an economic
forecasting firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. "To me it's a signal
that we've still got some reasonable order backlogs, so we're
still going to get some decent output growth in current
quarter."</p>
<p>On the other hand the employment statistics indicated that
softness is seeping into many areas of the economy, after
being concentrated in heavy manufacturing for much of last
year.</p>
<p>In manufacturing, the textile, apparel and food-processing
industries all saw job losses in May, Mrs. Norwood told
Congress. The auto industry, which has been one of the
country's weakest in the past year, saw payrolls dwindle
further, though the loss was slimmer than the previous month.</p>
<p>Construction employment failed to meet seasonal
expectations. In the service sector, job levels were
virtually flat in transportation, finance and insurance.
Retail trade employment shrank.</p>
<p>"In the service-producing sector, only health services has
had steady and strong growth so far this year," Mrs. Norwood
said. "In contrast, retail trade has been experiencing by far
its most sluggish employment period of this long economic
expansion, with no net job gains since January."</p>
<p>After slowing sharply last year, the economy appeared to
pick up a bit at the start of this year, aided partly by
unseasonably warm weather. But the government reported
declines in industrial production, factory orders, and
housing construction and sales in April. With the May
employment report, Stephen Morrell, chief economist at
Southeast Bank in Miami, said, "It's clear now that some of
the increases we had {at the beginning of the year} were just
temporary, due to seasonal factors and warm weather, but not
sustainable."</p>
<p>As further evidence of economic softness, the Commerce
Department also reported that spending on construction
projects declined 0.7% in April, to $432.4 billion, after
falling 0.7% in March as well. Spending on residential
building dipped 0.3%, while spending on office, industrial
and other types of non-residential construction grew 0.6%.</p>
<p>The numbers in all the reports were adjusted for normal
seasonal fluctuations.</p>
<p>Here are the Commerce Department's figures for
construction spending in billions of dollars at seasonally
adjusted annual rates.</p>
