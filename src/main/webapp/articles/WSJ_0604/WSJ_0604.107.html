	<p class="article-leader">Affiliated Publications Inc., publisher of the Boston
Globe and a stable of trade magazines, said it has agreed to
acquire 80% of A/S/M Communications Inc., publisher of Adweek
magazine.
   The purchase price was not disclosed, but industry
executives familiar with the transaction estimated the
Boston-based Affiliated paid about $17 million for the stake
to a group of private holders. Kenneth Fadner, president of
A/S/M, is the largest holder; he will continue in his post
and retain a substantial portion of the remaining 20%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Adweek, started in 1978, has been battered by a decline in
advertising by media companies. A/S/M, attempting to ease
financial difficulties, had quietly folded seven publications
in recent months, and had been seeking an outside investor to
provide cash.</p>
<p>Affiliated is acquiring Adweek, Adweek's Marketing Week,
and Photo District News. All of the A/S/M titles will become
part of BPI Communications Inc, Affiliated's specialty
publishing subsidiary.</p>
<p>Adweek will be a strategic addition to BPI
Communications's growing group of media and
entertainment-related magazines. BPI also publishes The
Hollywood Reporter, Billboard, Back Stage, American Film,
Photo Design and Interiors.</p>
