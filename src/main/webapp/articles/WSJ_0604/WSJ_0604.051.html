	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Canada's largest publicly traded television
broadcasting company, Baton Broadcasting Inc., said it
expects earnings to drop more than two-thirds from last year
as a result of higher production costs and
lower-than-expected gains in advertising revenue.
   Douglas Bassett, president and chief executive of Baton,
said he expects the company to report net income of between
20 Canadian cents and 25 Canadian cents (17 and 21.3 U.S.
cents) in the fiscal year ending Aug. 31.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A year earlier, net was 20.4 million Canadian dollars
($17.3 million), or 74 cents a share.</p>
<p>"This has been an absolutely lousy year, financially," Mr.
Bassett said.</p>
<p>He said "significant" increases in programming costs
helped push the company's net down to C$4.2 million, or 15
cents a share, for the first six months, compared to C$14.3
million, or 52 cents, in the previous year's first half.</p>
<p>In the first eight months of the company's fiscal year, he
said Baton's flagship Toronto television station increased
spending on new programming by about 79.2% over the previous
year.</p>
<p>He said a 1.6% increase in advertising revenue in the same
period is less than expected, and won't be sufficient to
cover heavy spending on programming. Nor will programming
expenses be cut, he said.</p>
