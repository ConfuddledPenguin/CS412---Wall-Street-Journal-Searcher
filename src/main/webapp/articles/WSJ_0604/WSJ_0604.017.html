	<p class="article-leader">BRUSSELS -- As the two Germanys combine, reshaping the
political and economic maps of Europe, they are also creating
bright trade prospects for nearly everyone.
   With East German needs growing and West Germany's
efficient factories already operating at nearly full speed,
outsiders are beginning to sense some exciting selling
possibilities, as German companies won't be able to satisfy
the big new market by themselves.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For some non-German companies, there may even be a chance
of an equity stake in a bigger, booming Germany. Many global
operators say West Germany has nearly as many barriers to
foreign investment as Japan. But by entering joint ventures
with Eastern corporations, a few non-German companies could
establish beachheads from which to spread out in a united
German market.</p>
<p>But for most, the best strategy will be to try to sell
anything from railroad equipment to foodstuffs in what would
be by far the biggest free-market economy in Europe.</p>
<p>"Unification is an incredible opportunity for foreign
companies," says Kurt Kaszh, an economist with Deutsche Bank
in Berlin. "If they join East German businesses in a
partnership, they will have immediate access to the entire
German market."</p>
<p>Paul Feenstra, head of international economics at
Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank, says: "West German producers
already are working at about 90% of their total productive
capacity. Additional demand from East Germany can only be met
by additional imports."</p>
<p>The European Community predicts that West German economic
growth will jump a full percentage point to 5%, stimulating
European Community growth by half a point. And the rest of
the 12-nation EC will be in a position to reap the benefits
without facing the higher taxes, inflation and interest rates
that West Germany will face in absorbing an impoverished
country of 16 million people.</p>
<p>West Germany has sought to reassure its partners that its
future remains firmly bound to the European Community. And
officials in Bonn hope that the potential for a European
export boom will ease fears of a Teutonic economic
juggernaut.</p>
<p>"East Germany's needs are so enormous that the quicker
German unity is realized, the better for our 11 partners in
Europe," West German Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher
says.</p>
<p>Countries likely to benefit first from the new market are
those doing the most business with West Germany -- the U.S.,
Japan, Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria and, above
all, France. France's perennial trade deficit with West
Germany could even vanish in a few years.</p>
<p>"I can't help thinking about all those roads, trains,
airports and telephones that the East Germans need," says
Regis Astier of the French Employers' Association. "Those
infrastructure items are our specialty."</p>
<p>The EC is also phasing out state subsidies on raw
materials such as coal. This offers Electricite de France a
chance to crack the German market. The utility company
already exports electricity from its nuclear power plants to
Italy, Switzerland, Belgium and England.</p>
<p>"As East Germany is integrated into West Germany, they
will need to import electricity," an Electricite de France
spokesman says. "They no longer will just be able to
subsidize their own coal producers and depend on
coal-generated power."</p>
<p>Electricite de France is also negotiating to build power
plants in East Germany. Siemens AG dominates the power plant
business in West Germany. But, the Electricite de France
spokesman says: "The East German electrical authorities don't
want to be eaten by Siemens. They want to diversify their
partners."</p>
<p>As a first step, monetary unification of Germany is due to
take effect next month. Although the 1-for-1 rate at which
most East Germans will be able to convert their currency into
West German marks will raise costs for companies doing
business in East Germany, it promises to increase the East's
buying power while still leaving its industry uncompetitive
against Western producers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, expectations that France will capitalize on the
new German market have strengthened France's 10-year
government bonds in the marketplace against West Germany's,
bringing down French interest rates. "The change has been
spectacular," says Christopher Potts, senior economist for
Banque Indosuez. "Alarm about German unity is vanishing as
the French economy strengthens."</p>
<p>France has benefited as Japanese and U.S. international
investors have moved money out of West Germany and into other
Western European markets. Since the beginning of April, the
CAC 40, the Paris stock market's leading indicator, has risen
more than 7%, driven by foreign investors.</p>
<p>On a recent trip to France, West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl invited French entrepreneurs to invest in East Germany.
Such investment "is the best way to transform German unity
into hope for all of Europe," he said. But so far, there have
been few concrete results.</p>
<p>One reason is the host of obstacles that have long made it
difficult for foreigners to acquire equity stakes in German
companies. Control of these companies often rests with a few
shareholders such as major banks or members of the
corporations' founding families, although their non-voting
stock is traded freely.</p>
<p>Germans, however, say outside investors must be willing to
take more risks. "There are no barriers here; you have to be
persistent and patient," says Deutsche Bank's Mr. Kaszh. "If
West European companies aren't aggressive enough now, when
every East German industrial entity is searching for a
Western partner, then they are going to lose out."</p>
<p>A few have already elbowed their way into the German
market. In March, France's Lyonnaise des Eaux S.A. formed a
partnership with West Germany's giant Thyssen AG group to
provide water treatment services for East German
municipalities. Also at that time, French-based Accor S.A.
set up a joint venture between its West German operations and
the East German travel agency Reiseburo DDR to build hotels
in East Germany. Accor agreed to take management control and
an equity stake in the venture, which plans to open its first
hotel by the end of 1991.</p>
