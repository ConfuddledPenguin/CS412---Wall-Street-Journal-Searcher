	<p class="article-leader">MARINA DEL REY, Calif. -- Investor fears that L.A. Gear
Inc. might trip over its gilded shoelaces materialized as the
sneaker-maker disclosed that it will report its first
quarterly drop in net income in three years.
   Shares of the company plunged $8.50, or 22%, on volume of
6.6 million shares in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading Friday. Trading was halted briefly after L.A. Gear's
announcement. The stock closed at $30.75, nearly $20 a share
below the record high of $50.375 that it hit just one week
earlier. The plunge culminated a nosedive that began last
Tuesday when Kidder, Peabody & Co. cut its recommendation on
the highflying stock to "hold" from "buy."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>L.A. Gear said that per-share net income for its second
quarter ended May 31 was between 50 cents and 60 cents,
compared with 91 cents a year earlier. That was despite
record sales of about $225 million, up from $169.6 million a
year ago. The company estimated that per-share net income for
the full year will be "approximately equal to the low end" of
analysts' estimates, which had been a range of $4 to $4.50 a
share, compared with $3.01 a share for fiscal 1989.</p>
<p>"Their days of nonstop growth are over," Kidder analyst
Gary Jacobson said Friday, after listening to an hour-long
conference call in which the company tried to explain why
earnings had plummeted. L.A. Gear executives didn't return
phone calls seeking comment.</p>
<p>In its statement, L.A. Gear blamed the drop on its product
mix, citing increased sales of lower-priced, less-profitable
shoes that it had pushed in order to gain market share and
retail shelf space. The company, which is third in the market
behind Nike Inc. and Reebok International Ltd., had set a
goal for itself last year of being "No. 1 in '91."</p>
<p>Shipments of newer shoe styles that are potentially more
profitable -- including a line plugged by singer Michael
Jackson and an expanded line of hiker-style shoes -- were
"negligible" during the second quarter, L.A. Gear said.
Earnings were also affected by increased sales of L.A. Gear
apparel and international sales of its footwear, both of
which have lower profit margins than domestic sales of
footwear, the company said.</p>
<p>Kidder's Mr. Jacobson said he turned cool on L.A. Gear
stock last week because of its rapid price rise, coupled with
his "concern about a little softness in the quarter." But the
amount of the drop in profit caught him -- and most everyone
else on Wall Street -- off guard. "I did not in my wildest
dreams expect anything of this magnitude," he said. The
analyst said he's cutting his earnings estimate on the
company to between $3 and $3.50 a share for the current
fiscal year, despite the higher estimates of company
officials.</p>
<p>Phone lines at L.A. Gear's headquarters here were jammed
Friday with angry investors demanding an explanation for the
sudden change in the company's fortunes. Just a week earlier
the stock had soared on the announcement that pop singer
Paula Abdul, formerly Reebok's pitchwoman, was joining L.A.
Gear's stable of stars. Several top brokerage houses had buy
recommendations out on the stock.</p>
<p>There was some warning of problems ahead. When L.A. Gear
posted first-quarter results at the end of March, the company
noted that profit margins for the quarter had fallen to 39.3%
from 43.3% a year earlier. L.A. Gear cited then the same
causes that it gave for Friday's announcement.</p>
<p>L.A. Gear said that despite the bad news about earnings,
business for the rest of the year looks brisk. Incoming
orders during the second quarter were about $400 million, up
more than 50% from a year ago. "The increase in orders,
together with strong retail demand for our new styles, makes
us confident in our ability to post renewed increases in
subsequent periods," said Robert Greenberg, L.A. Gear's
chairman and chief executive officer, in the company's
statement. Delivery of the company's newer styles is planned
for the third and fourth quarters to coincide with the
back-to-school and holiday selling seasons, he said.</p>
<p>Still, some observers say investors shouldn't hold their
breath over all the new styles. "I think that probably the
Michael Jackson stuff hasn't done as well as they
anticipated," said John Horan, publisher of Sporting Goods
Intelligence, a trade publication. "There was a lot of
speculation that in Japan it was going to be a really major
number, and now the Asics people {distributors of the shoes
in Japan} aren't looking for giant numbers from that." More
important to L.A. Gear, he said, will be the success of its
hiker-style shoes. "They've got a lot riding on that
program."</p>
<p>Sutro & Co. analyst Jonathan Ziegler, who also cut his
recommendation on L.A. Gear to "hold" last Tuesday, said the
company insists the drop in earnings "is a hiccup." As for
himself, he said, "I think they may be right, but I'm going
to stand back and watch from the sidelines."</p>
<p>L.A. Gear's stock has been on a roller coaster since last
year, when it soared on record earnings and the announcement
of the sponsorship agreement with Mr. Jackson. But the stock
sank in November and December on a string of developments
that included a criminal investigation into alleged
underpayment of customs duties; a lowering of earnings
estimates by an analyst; and the resignation of the chief
financial officer over a pay dispute. That, coupled with
concern that consumers might be turning away from the
company's trendy styles, sent the company's stock price to a
low of $22.50 in December.</p>
