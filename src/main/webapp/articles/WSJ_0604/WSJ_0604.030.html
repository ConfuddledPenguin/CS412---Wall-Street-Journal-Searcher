	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- First Executive Corp.'s chairman and chief
executive, Fred Carr, has agreed to testify before the House
oversight and investigations subcommittee about insurance and
junk bonds.
   The subcommittee also is expected to subpoena attorneys
and accountants whom investigators have connected with Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. partnerships, according to individuals
close to the panel. Those partnerships, made up mostly of
Drexel employees, invested in a number of Drexel deals and
have been the subject of subcommittee investigations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We want to establish how big these partnerships were, how
much money was going through them," said one subcommittee
official. The panel also is eager to learn what investments
were made through the partnerships as well as whether there
were misdeeds involving Drexel offerings and other
investments.</p>
<p>The subcommittee already plans to offer immunity to former
Drexel junk-bond chief Michael Milken in exchange for his
testimony on the high-yield securities.</p>
<p>Mr. Carr's testimony, set for June 18, will focus on the
insurance industry, in which First Executive is a sizable
player, as well as practices in the junk-bond industry. First
Executive was a major investor in junk bonds.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Mr. Carr said the executive "wants to talk
about how he has managed to maintain the strong capital
position in the industry nothwithstanding his junk-bond
holdings." On Mr. Carr's relationship with Mr. Milken, the
spokesman said, "He did business with Milken, but he did
business with a lot of people."</p>
