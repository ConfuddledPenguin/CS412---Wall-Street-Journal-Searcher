	<p class="article-leader">VEVEY, Switzerland -- At the headquarters of Nestle S.A.
here, a landscaped garden stretches down to the shore of Lake
Leman. Across the blue waters rise the snowcapped Alps. It is
one of the world's greatest corporate vistas.
   But Helmut Maucher, Nestle's German-born chief executive,
is concerned with a much broader landscape, all the markets
around the world where Nestle sees new worlds to conquer.
Surprisingly, some that offer the most potential are in what
we have tagged with that marvelous euphemism, "less-developed
countries" or LDCs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>LDC simply means poor, but not all LDCs are alike. Some
are making economic progress and have an emerging middle
class. Upwardly mobile individuals in LDCs behave in ways not
unlike middle-class consumers everywhere. Because they have
money and are busy, they like the convenience foods that are
a Nestle specialty -- instant teas and coffee, packaged
soups, dry cereals and candies, to name a few.</p>
<p>Thus, the view from Vevey is by no means as bleak as the
one often presented when LDCs come begging at the World Bank
or other agencies that attempt to foster international
development. Nestle's world-wide revenues -- from production
operations in 61 nations -- soared 21.6% last year from the
year before. Profits were up 17.2%. This year will not be as
spectacular, but Mr. Maucher hopes to earn as much as last
year and maybe a bit more.</p>
<p>A lot of that progress is coming from developed nations,
not least the U.S. and Canada. But the LDC component is of
special interest. For example, Nestle and other global
companies have become quite interested in India, a country of
more than 800 million people that now has a middle class said
to number 150 million, a potentially huge market.</p>
<p>There is a flip side, of course. Mainly because of
protectionist politics, such markets sometimes are hard to
crack, even though foreign investment is exactly what LDCs
need. PepsiCo, for example, has met serious roadblocks,
presumably thrown up by the political friends of India's
soft-drink tycoons, in its efforts to develop a market for
its products in India. Other companies have encountered
similar difficulties. For that reason, foreign investment is
puny relative to India's size.</p>
<p>Indeed, Nestle itself learned a great deal about
anti-multinational LDC politics some years ago when it was
accused of exploiting the Third World poor through promotion
of its infant formula in ways that were claimed to induce its
substitution for mother's milk. But the company worked hard
to separate the genuine concerns of church people and
nutritionists from mere political sharpshooting and then set
up a code of marketing conduct. The issue has largely been
laid to rest.</p>
<p>"I usually say that if it is very difficult, all the
better," says Mr. Maucher. "Then it is a challenge for Nestle
to do it when others won't. In the last 10 years we have
doubled the size of our factory in the Punjab for producing
meat products. We have built a new factory for Nescafe. We
have started four new joint ventures with new partners."</p>
<p>He admits that even in democratic countries such as India,
foreign investors are often subject to bureaucratic vagaries
and the selective application of laws. But with careful
cultivation of partnerships and an effort to understand the
political forces at work, it is possible to make progress.
Nestle's turnover in India of $72 million is tiny compared
with its world-wide revenues of $34 billion, but it has a
foothold in a potentially large market.</p>
<p>Having made headway in India, Nestle is tackling some
other LDCs. It has started a joint venture in Pakistan, a
country of more than 100 million people with a middle class
estimated at 10 million to 20 million. That is smaller than
India's but three times the size of the Swiss market.</p>
<p>"We've also started in Egypt, a country that is very
difficult for many reasons, but we also started with partners
and now we have the learning curve and the first phase is
behind us."</p>
<p>Nestle has an advantage over some of its competitors in
tapping difficult markets because it has been a global
company for many years. Mr. Maucher notes that the Vevey
headquarters, plunked down in that marvelous Swiss setting,
houses employees with some 50 different nationalities. The
company has done for years what some other multinationals
have only learned to do recently, made people of all
nationalities working for the company feel that they have as
much chance of advancement as the Swiss.</p>
<p>"If you see our Swiss Latin American manager here talking
to his people in Brazil, you don't know he's Swiss. He talks
the language. The idea that other nationalities should be
inside and not outside has been an attitude of Nestle for a
long time.</p>
<p>"We have certain basic policies and concepts but only very
few and for the rest we integrate ourselves into the
traditions and the mentality of the country where we are
operating. If we send people, we urge them to learn the
country completely. That is a very important strength of
Nestle. The whole culture here of being in a small country
has prepared us to do so because we've always had to do this
to survive."</p>
<p>Of course, yet another thing that facilitates the
exploitation of new undeveloped markets is the communications
revolution. Nestle's central computer can process data from
its 421 factories, not to mention sales and research offices,
throughout the world on a real time basis. "By being
everywhere and working in different products, you also spread
risk," Mr. Maucher says. "That is part of the beauty of real
globalization."</p>
<p>As with most successful CEOs, Mr. Maucher is an optimist.
He thinks that the world is becoming more and more
cooperative and that barriers to trade and investment are
gradually coming down. As a German he is particularly excited
about the opening up of the formerly communist countries of
Europe.</p>
<p>"East Germany is for me already integrated. On Nov. 9 last
year, the Wall came down. And on the 10th we delegated East
Germany to our West Germany company. We were probably the
first ones to do it. We said to them, `East Germany is now a
part of your business.'</p>
<p>"Within a few months, a half a year, you will see a lot of
things in these countries. Poland is very open and very
positive but still on the way to organizing itself. But it is
very open philosophically.</p>
<p>"The next years to come will not be less exciting than the
last 10 years. The restructuring will go on and we will
finally come to total globalization, including many countries
which up to now have been excluded from this process. To some
extent, the rest of the planned economies will join in,
perhaps slower and with less intensity. One way or another I
think there will be more business for multinationals."</p>
