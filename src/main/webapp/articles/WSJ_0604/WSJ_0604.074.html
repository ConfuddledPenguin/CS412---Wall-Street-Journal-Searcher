	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Orient-Express Hotels Inc. reported profit of
$14.4 million, or $1.48 a share, in the fiscal first quarter,
vs. a loss of $3.1 million, or 32 cents a share, in the
year-ago quarter.
   But the quarter's results included a onetime gain of $19.4
million on the sale of a hotel and golf course in England. On
an operating basis, the hotel and travel company's loss
widened to $4.9 million from $4.4 million. Orient-Express
attributed the wider loss to the fact that the Easter
vacation period fell in the second quarter this year, while
it fell in the first quarter in 1989. Revenue rose 5.4%, to
$9.9 million from $9.4 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Orient-Express also said it agreed in principle to sell a
beach resort in the Bahamas to a private investor for $4.2
million. The deal is subject to approval by the Bahamian
government, and isn't expected to close until Aug. 31, the
company said.</p>
<p>Orient-Express also owns or operates cruise ships and
tourist trains, including the London-to-Venice Orient
Express.</p>
