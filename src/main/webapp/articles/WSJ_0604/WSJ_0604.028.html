	<p class="article-leader">Yair Klein, a lieutenant colonel in the Israeli army
reserve, was charged Thursday in Jerusalem magistrates court
with exporting military know-how without a permit and
violating the obligations of a reserve officer.
   Mr. Klein, 46 years old, is wanted in Colombia for
allegedly training cocaine-cartel hitmen. His name has also
been mentioned in connection with a shipment of arms bound
for Antigua that wound up at the ranch of a major Colombian
drug trafficker. An inquiry into that transaction opened in
Antigua Friday but was adjourned until July 16.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Klein was the subject of a page-one Wall Street
Journal article last month.</p>
<p>The indictment didn't mention possible links to drug
dealers, which Mr. Klein has denied since the accusations
first surfaced in August. The court heard only that Mr. Klein
agreed with a representative of a group known as the
Organization of Cattle Ranchers to train them in military
combat, and that he made two trips to Colombia to train
members of the Organization of Farmers. Combat training
without a license constitutes an illegal military export.</p>
<p>Mr. Klein hasn't yet submitted a defense statement to the
court. However, in an April interview with this newspaper he
said he didn't seek a permit because the farmers were private
individuals who weren't part of a military force. He denied
knowing of any links between the farmers and drug cartels.</p>
