	<h3>Heard on the Street: Are Junk Bonds Really Stocks in Disguise?</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- More and more stock investors are buying junk
bonds, and they aren't doing it for the high yield.
   Rather, they are pursuing a strategy -- long known, but
lately gaining favor -- that junk bonds of highly distressed
companies represent shares of stock in disguise. David
Schulte, managing partner of Chilmark Partners, calls junk
"equity with a bow tie."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The reasoning is as follows: since many junk bonds will
eventually be converted through securities-swap offers or
bankruptcies into equity, or ownership, they hold the same
potential claim as a stock on the company's cash flow and
asset value.</p>
<p>The compelling investment angle is that junk bonds are
selling at huge discounts from face value at the same time
that the stock market has reached a record high.</p>
<p>In one sign of the trend, Bear Stearns is regularly
shuttling its junk-bond research to institutional stock
clients. A dozen or so of its equity accounts have purchased
junk, the firm says, and it expects that "more will
participate every quarter." Another sign is that takeover
speculators are buying junk.</p>
<p>"It's a great area, because people have beaten it down,"
says Julian Robertson, head of Tiger Management, a
stock-picker lately enamored of junk. "Junk-bond people were
supposed to be geniuses. Then people got frightened. It's
been overdone both ways."</p>
<p>Investors such as Charles Davidson of Steinhardt Partners,
which invests primarily in stocks, conclude that a
diversified group of junk bonds should outperform stocks over
the next few years.</p>
<p>This is a heady idea, but it's doubtful that a buckshot
approach would work. Buying an entire class of securities
ensures that one will do no better than average. The
question, with junk bonds or anything else, is which
securities are priced well below intrinsic value? It appears
that only a handful of junk bonds fit that bill.</p>
<p>Michael Price, president of Mutual Shares, a stock-picker
who has been sifting through junk bonds for longer than most,
says "there is nothing compelling. Brokers can talk all day
long about this bond being cheap, but we're the ones who have
to own them."</p>
<p>Mr. Price says that when the time and cost of a
restructuring are factored in, few junk bonds look good.</p>
<p>Bob Masterson, director of research at Cypress Capital
Management, says "You've been hammered so much in the past
six months; it's tough to know whether the tidal wave is
over."</p>
<p>Perhaps, one shouldn't try to know. Amy Minella, senior
vice president of Deltec Asset Management, recommends that
buyers take a long-term view and keep buying, or "average
down," if prices drop. "It's not for the faint of heart," she
notes. Using an equity approach to junk bonds, "the first
thing you say is what is the value of the company? If it had
no debt, what would I pay for it?" In other words, assuming
the debt is converted to equity, what is the debt worth?</p>
<p>One thing she and others don't set much store in is the
yield-to-maturity -- a favorite indicator of Wall Street
analysts that is just about meaningless for distressed bonds.</p>
<p>"If I'm buying Southland I'm not buying for the current
yield," Mrs. Minella notes. "I'm assuming they won't pay."</p>
<p>Wall Street generally leans towards bonds trading at close
to full face amount, the so-called "upper tier," as providing
safety. But this may offer less protection than meets the
eye.</p>
<p>The label "upper tier" doesn't assure that a bond will
spend its life at the face amount, known as par. In fact,
just about every bond trading at big discounts -- those in
the so-called middle and bottom tiers -- were at one time
issued at par. And only bonds in the lower tiers offer the
potential for an equity-style return.</p>
<p>Tiger Management, using an equity approach, has invested
in the debt of Greyhound Lines, Community Newspapers, MCorp,
RJR Nabisco pay-in-kind bonds of 2007 (paying interest in
additional securities), Jim Walter and Hospital Corp. of
America.</p>
<p>Patrick Duff, a Tiger analyst, says, "You do the same kind
of valuation work you do with stocks. What kind of cash flow
will the business generate? And what kind of multiple would
you put on that business?"</p>
<p>With Greyhound, for instance, he estimates that even if
business doesn't recover to pre-strike levels, cash flow
after capital spending should be roughly $35 million a year.
"You could buy all the company's debt for roughly $200
million," he says, or an attractive six times cash flow even
in a depressed year.</p>
<p>Seth Klarman, a Mutual Shares alumnus who manages money
for Baupost Group, is bullish on selected issues such as
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. Mr. Klarman looks -- among other
measures -- at how much value a junk bond would have if each
of a company's securities were converted to equity. As with a
stock, he looks at the fundamentals of the business and puts
a presumed multiple on its cash flow.</p>
<p>If the company winds up making its interest payments, the
bond should eventually appreciate and provide a fat return.</p>
<p>But more often, the company restructures. "The job of the
distressed-security analyst is to figure out how under water
the company is and which security should get the equity," Mr.
Klarman says. "In Interco, the junior bonds are too under
water; however, the more senior 13 3/4% bonds" would get a
large share of the equity under the company's proposed
restructuring.</p>
<p>Mr. Klarman cautions "there are a lot of ways you can get
hurt. People bought Allied Stores 11 1/2% bonds in the 50s
and 60s last fall believing that those bonds represented
significant amounts of equity." But the value of the company
deteriorated. Now, Mr. Klarman says, those issues "are valued
as a kind of warrant and they're trading at five cents on the
dollar."</p>
<p>Another problem is that the corporate restructuring
"workout" process is time-consuming and unpredictable. In
theory, when a company can't pay its debts, shareholders
don't get any value until creditors are paid in full.</p>
<p>But in practice, James Heffernan, managing partner of
investment firm Whitman, Heffernan, Rhein & Co., says,
shareholders are able to "use the bankruptcy process to
extort some value out of bondholders."</p>
<p>James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer and
a longtime critic of junk bonds, questions whether it's
sensible to buy even deeply distressed junk. He sees the junk
bond collapse as "a symptom of {a continuing} broader
distress in banking and credit."</p>
<p>Noting, earlier this year, that bargain hunters were
turning to junk, Mr. Grant wrote: "Still-unconverted bears,
including us, have their doubts. They ask, in effect, can a
bubble of four or five years' making be deflated in only four
or five months?"</p>
<p>Mr. Price of Mutual Shares worries about the huge supply
of bonds paying interest in the form of more bonds. When
these convert to cash-paying bonds, they are likely to set
off a new wave of defaults. Thus, Mr. Price says, "Nobody
wants noncash-paying paper." With such an overhang, he adds,
"The market can't go anywhere."</p>
<p>A precedent might be the Depression, when the world was
awash with corporate bonds selling at deep discounts. The
1934 investing classic "Security Analysis," written by
Benjamin Graham and David Dodd, recommended highly selective
purchase of such bonds. The authors favored a "common-stock
approach" and they weren't deterred by the lack of popular
interest.</p>
<p>"The large supply of such issues, coupled with the lack of
a natural demand for them, will make for a level of prices
below their intrinsic value," they wrote. Even if the form of
the security is unattractive, "this may be more than offset
by the attractive price at which they may be purchased."</p>
