	<p class="article-leader">The last time House Ways and Means Chairman Dan
Rostenkowski tried to block a tax cut for the elderly -- the
catastrophic health-care tax repeal -- a group of seniors
besieged him inside his car in Chicago until he fled in his
car.
   Now, Rosty's committee has become the main obstacle to the
repeal of one of the most unfair laws in the U.S. tax code,
the earnings limit for Social Security recipients. Illinois
Republican Dennis Hastert has 226 co-sponsors for his bill to
repeal this tax on people over age 65. A House majority is
only 218. Yet Rosty, abetted by subcommittee Chairman Andy
Jacobs of Indiana, won't even let the legislation come to the
House floor for debate. Maybe Congress should consult the
Supreme Soviet for a lesson in democracy.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The earnings limit amounts to a surtax on the working
elderly. For every $3 earned by a retiree over a certain
limit, he or she loses $1 in Social Security benefits. The
limit in 1990 is $9,360 for seniors between age 65 and 69;
it's $6,840 for seniors age 62 to 66 (who lose $1 in benefits
for every $2 earned above the limit). The special tax expires
at age 70.</p>
<p>This means in practice that retirees face an outrageously
high marginal tax rate. A man in the 15% federal tax bracket
who works at McDonald's can face a marginal rate of 55%.
Since the earnings-limit tax also cuts his wife's Social
Security benefits (even if she doesn't work), the marginal
rate for the couple can reach 105%. And this doesn't count
state and local taxes. The couple ends up paying the
government for the privilege of working. As that Soviet
emigre comedian likes to say, what a country]</p>
<p>It gets worse. The tax applies only to "earned" income,
the sort that comes from working for a wage or salary. If
income derives from interest or dividends, no Social Security
benefit is lost. So the rich elderly can have a lower
marginal tax rate than the average working stiff. Democrats
used to care about such matters of "equity," but nowadays
they'd rather be the tax collectors for the welfare state.</p>
<p>Rosty and his comrades are petrified that repeal might
"cost" the Treasury revenue. In the static computer models of
the Congressional Budget Office, repeal would "cost" $3.6
billion in the first year, and $26.2 billion over five years.
This assumes repeal wouldn't change anyone's behavior. Former
Treasury economists Aldona and Gary Robbins, who do consider
behavior, have estimated that enough seniors would happily
work more and that the federal government would gain revenue.
Not surprisingly, labor-participation rates among the elderly
are lowest right around the income levels worst hit by the
earnings-limit tax.</p>
<p>The earnings limit is an artifact of the Depression era,
when the U.S. wanted seniors to retire so scarce jobs would
open for younger people. But many parts of the U.S. now have
a labor shortage. The skills and experience of the elderly
are one of our most underutilized assets, and will become
even more valuable as the Baby Boom generation retires. The
punitive taxation of the earnings limit sends the message to
seniors that their country doesn't want them to work, or that
they are fools if they do. It's time for another run at Dan
Rostenkowski's limousine.</p>
