parts company, said it agreed to sell its Toledo automotive
vinyls plant to employees.
   The sale was financed in part by the employee stock
ownership plan. Terms weren't disclosed. The new
employee-owned company, Textileather Corp., expects to have
annual sales of $43 million. Workers voted to take a pay cut
averaging 70 cents an hour in exchange for stock in the new
company. The plant has 280 hourly and salaried employees.</p>
