	<p class="article-leader">STODGY OR STATELY, lacquered or leather-bound, the office
chair has always been much more than a place to sit. It
projects power. It reflects the technological revolution of
the workplace. And it's there when you need it.
   "Everything in the office seems to distance you from human
contact, like the panels, phones and computers, so the chair
becomes an island, something personal," says Scott Star,
group product director at Knoll International, a furniture
maker. "My secretary took my chair when I was on vacation,
and when I came back I felt invaded."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Today's agile office chair -- tilting and twisting like a
Texas two-stepper -- is a far cry from the bulky executive
armchairs used in the mid-19th century. These creations, with
high stiff backs and embroidered cushions, looked impressive
but were soon unsuitable for the changing workplace. By the
end of the century, the typewriter had moved into the office,
and that required a new kind of chair. Primarily for women
who worked as secretaries, the "task chair" was armless,
mounted on wheels and had a low, adjustable back.</p>
<p>Thus began a caste system that held sway for many years.
Underlings who toiled all day on typewriters, on adding
machines and at telephone switchboards sat in smaller,
functional chairs; bigwigs who made decisions but never
dirtied their fingernails got the overstuffed, leatherbound
thrones.</p>
<p>"The large executive chair elevates the sitter," Emilio
Ambasz, a New York architect and industrial designer, once
said. "It distances him. It protects the body. There is a
tall back to rest {his head}, and it is covered with the skin
of some animal, preferably your predecessor."</p>
<p>Designers say that nothing is more difficult than making a
chair, it being so small and people being so long. Sitting,
according to this theory, is an unnatural position because it
applies pressure on the spine. Humans, it seems, are much
better off lying down or standing up.</p>
<p>The chair, though, has not lacked innovation. In the 1920s
and '30s, the German Bauhaus design movement inspired all
sorts of spare, no-nonsense tubular-steel office chairs whose
emphasis was on style and mass production. After World War
II, sitting improved with Charles Eames's molded plywood and
fiberglass chairs, whose contoured and shell-shaped chairs
conformed more naturally to the body.</p>
<p>By the 1970s, the two-tier chair system began to crumble
as a new movement emerged called "ergonomics." The word
simply means the relationship between people and work.
Applied to chairs, it refers to seats that adjust, bend or
pivot in ways that are both functional and comfortable.</p>
<p>Giving high-quality chairs to all levels of workers
highlights how technology has transformed the workplace and
how the desk has been replaced by the work station. No longer
is "machine work" consigned to secretaries. Now middle- and
top-level managers, as well as their subordinates, write on
video display terminals, process data, punch Quotron machines
and work with high-tech gadgets. That means almost everyone
needs a nimble, high-performance chair, a task chair for the
information age.</p>
<p>Thronelike executive chairs are also going by the wayside
as women move up the ranks. "They don't like the fat-cat
look," says John Berry, a spokesman for Herman Miller Inc.,
an office-furniture maker in Zeeland, Mich.</p>
<p>The top brass, however, still want chairs with status, so
furniture makers are rolling out lines of chairs similar in
style but tailored differently for staff workers, middle
managers and executives. The big shots, for example, love to
recline, so they get chairs with added back support.</p>
<p>Some designers suspect that future office chairs will look
more like living-room furniture, which would create a better
office social environment, while others look for chairs that
will move more harmoniously with the natural movements of the
body.</p>
<p>But there will never be a perfect chair. William Stumpf,
an office-furniture designer, notes that the body's ideal
position is to be floating in water, which is good news for
scuba divers and mermaids but cold comfort for the sedentary
office masses.</p>
