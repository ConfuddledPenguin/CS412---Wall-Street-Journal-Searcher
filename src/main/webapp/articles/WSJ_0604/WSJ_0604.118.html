	<p class="article-leader">JANET FUJII HAS LOST 37 pounds since last June. Her
amazing diet secret? A new kind of office that experts
believe will house a great number of workers in years to
come.
   Before moving into it, Ms. Fujii, an auditor for the
Hawaii state tax office, commuted more than an hour to
downtown Honolulu on the notorious H-1 freeway. She had to
get up at 4:30 a.m. to take care of the children, who often
ate breakfast in the car on their way to school; the family's
dinner often amounted to cheeseburgers or greasy fried
chicken snatched from fast-food outlets on her way home at
night. In the blur of freeways and french fries, she wound up
carrying 180 pounds on a 5-foot-3inch frame.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That changed last summer when she went to work at the
Hawaii Telework Center, a neighborhood work depot jammed with
computers, facsimile machines and similar gear, and set up in
a bedroom community of Honolulu only seven minutes from her
house. Suddenly she had more time -- time to prepare
nutritious meals, time to walk and ride her exercycle. The
pounds fell away. There is little, she says, that she misses
about her old headquarters job.</p>
<p>Backers of the telework center, which now houses 17 people
working for both private and public employers, ballyhoo it as
"a 21st-century work concept," a model for a workplace of
tomorrow that will use "electronic highways" to move
information instead of concrete ones that move people.
Experts believe that they may be right -- and that so-called
satellite offices like this one will be at least as important
in the coming decentralization of business as the
already-growing move toward working at home.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that social, environmental and other
pressures are gradually forcing business away from its usual
pattern of setting up big office centers where hundreds or
even thousands of people work. Minorities and women, the bulk
of tomorrow's potential work force, often cannot reach them
quickly or inexpensively, which puts a crimp in recruiting.
Heavy smog and clogged traffic arteries make prospects still
worse, and put more heat on business to change its thinking.</p>
<p>Working at home is one obvious remedy, but it is a limited
one. The worker has to have enough space, for one thing. For
another, he or she must have the kind of temperament needed
to work without daily personal interaction with others, and
the internal discipline to stay in front of the computer and
away from the refrigerator. Quite a few people lack both,
which is where the satellite concept comes in.</p>
<p>"If you look ahead five years, I bet there will be
proportionally as much or more growth in satellite offices,"
says one consultant in telecommuting.</p>
<p>There are comparatively few true satellite offices or
neighborhood work centers in the U.S. now; foreign countries,
especially densely populated Japan, are ahead in this
respect. But the idea is spreading in this country, and those
who have tried it generally find that it is generating
benefits beyond those originally envisioned.</p>
<p>The Hawaii center, for example, was designed and initially
financed by the state (corporations contributed heavily,
too), largely to take cars off the road. It has. The state
figures that employees now working there drive about 9,000
fewer miles annually and save more than $2,500 a year in
transportation-related expenses.</p>
<p>But the benefits in worker efficiency, though not easily
measurable in numbers, may be even greater. Ms. Fujii, for
one, who was perennially fatigued by her commute, is slimmer
now, eating right and able to exercise. A former borderline
diabetic, her blood sugar is now normal and at 39 she has
more pep than she's had in years. "I think it makes a better
worker, both on and off the job," she says.</p>
<p>State transportation planner Edward Uchida adds,
"Quality-of-life improvement has emerged as the most
significant benefit of teleworking."</p>
<p>Some of those same benefits are to be found in
traffic-choked Southern California, a leader in the U.S. when
it comes to experimenting with new models of work. The state
is forcing employers to come up with commute-reduction
programs to improve air quality, and is trying to encourage
telecommuting among its own agency employees.</p>
<p>Pacific Bell, a subsidiary of Pacific Telesis Group, has a
formal telecommuting policy, and as many as 1,000 of its
managers work fairly regularly from sites other than their
primary offices. The company opened two full-blown satellite
offices four years ago, each able to accommodate 18 managers
who communicate with the outside world via personal
computers, modems, facsimile, copying equipment and laser
printers.</p>
<p>"I'm sold on it," says Jim Campbell, a sales-support
manager who works in the Woodland Hills satellite, 25 miles
from the downtown Los Angeles office. He used to make a
26-mile commute there. It took an hour when everything went
well, and up to 2 1/2 hours when it rained and a tanker truck
overturned on the freeway. Now he's at his desk in 15
minutes.</p>
<p>Free of home-office distractions, he also feels he is
functioning more efficiently. In the downtown office, he
says, "you've got everyone to say hello to, you've got to
catch up on gossip."</p>
<p>But he still prefers working at some kind of office to
working out of his house. "If I worked at home, I'd be doing
dishes and the laundry, and the lawn would need to be mowed,"
he says. He doesn't believe that working out of sight of the
nabobs at headquarters has impaired his career prospects,
either; like other satellite workers, he visits the main
office from time to time.</p>
<p>He is far removed from his boss, Sesil Adams, who works
mostly in Orange County, well to the south. Mr. Adams is even
more remote from his own boss in San Francisco -- and the
latter sometimes telecommutes himself.</p>
<p>Which leads to this: How can managers manage when they
can't see whom they are managing? How do they know their
minions haven't gone to the movies?</p>
<p>Mr. Adams, who admits he was apprehensive when he first
started managing people "out of my direct sight," says that
trust is the key. Though he makes spot-check visits to the
satellite centers to make sure all is well, he basically
relies on bottom-line results that prove employee efficiency.</p>
<p>Other companies find that satellite centers are an
important recruiting tool. NSM, a division of the
Atlanta-based Norrell Corp., has set up such centers in areas
of downtown Memphis and Atlanta served by mass-transit lines.
By offering convenient places to work, NSM has been able to
recruit and train for local clients many lower-skilled
clerical workers who might otherwise not have applied.</p>
<p>Few employers who have tried satellite operations cite any
serious drawbacks to their use. Some employees have been
transferred out of them because they haven't been able to
work well without direct supervision, but on the whole
employers' experience has been positive.</p>
<p>Mr. Uchida, the state transportation planner, can think of
only one problem at the Hawaii Telework Center. "The DB
Syndrome is going around -- the dead-battery syndrome," he
explains. "Our participants travel so infrequently and for
such short distances that their batteries don't have a chance
to recharge." Half the teleworkers have had dead batteries,
he says, and another worker ran out of gas. Twice.</p>
