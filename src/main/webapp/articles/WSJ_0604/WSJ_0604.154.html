	<p class="article-leader">Chevron Corp. signed an agreement with the Soviet Ministry
of Oil and Gas Industry to study the feasibility of jointly
developing the huge Tengiz oil field, paving the way for what
could be the largest joint venture yet between a U.S. firm
and the Soviet Union.
   With reserves estimated by Soviet officials at more than
25 billion barrels, the Tengiz field is "probably the single
largest field discovered in the last decade," said Richard
Matzke, president of Chevron Overseas Petroleum Inc., the
unit of San Francisco-based Chevron that's engaged in the
talks with the Soviets. The reserves are roughly
two-and-a-half times those of Alaska's Prudhoe Bay, which
accounts for 20% of U.S. oil output.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, speaking at a news
conference in Washington, lauded the agreement with Chevron,
calling it one of several "important decisions" on
U.S.-Soviet economic cooperation reached in connection with
his summit meeting with President Bush. He said the agreement
will produce an investment of about 10 billion rubles in the
Soviet Union.</p>
<p>"I think that this economic area and other areas create a
good foundation for our political dialogue and create a kind
of solid support, a solid pillar of support for our
cooperation," Mr. Gorbachev said.</p>
<p>Chevron's accord, signed Saturday at the Soviet Embassy in
Washington, came just one day after the signing of the
landmark trade agreement between the U.S. and Soviet Union.
"This fits right in with the mood of the season," Mr. Matzke
said. Though the trade agreement wasn't the linchpin in
Chevron's agreement, Mr. Matzke acknowleged that "it sure
didn't hurt any."</p>
<p>Mr. Matzke said Chevron comes to the table with oil-field
technology that the Soviets need, international marketing
experience, and "capital at a time when capital means
something to them."</p>
<p>Just last month, the Soviets signed an oil exploration and
production agreement with Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine,
the French oil company, giving Elf exploration rights on
between 13,500 and 15,500 square miles in the Volga-Caspian
region of the Soviet Union. Until recently, the Soviet Union
had restricted foreign oil company participation to technical
assistance. But the government now acknowledges its oil
industry is having problems and needs outside assistance. The
Soviet Union is the world's largest oil producer, with just
under 12 million barrels a day, but oil production has been
declining.</p>
<p>The so-called "protocol of intentions" between Chevron and
the Soviets is only the first step in lengthy negotiations
that may culminate in a joint venture for production and
development of the Tengiz field, as well as the much smaller
Korolev field nearby. A feasibility study and related
joint-venture documents for development of the smaller field
already have been compiled, though the study results haven't
been disclosed. There are currently no commercial drilling or
refining activities in either field.</p>
<p>Chevron will send about 20 employees in the next
month-and-a-half for on-site evaluations of the Tengiz field.
By the end of the year, "we will make a development proposal
spelling out what we would like as an interest in the field,"
Mr. Matzke said.</p>
<p>While the protocol is far from a guarantee of a
joint-venture agreement, Mr. Matzke said it "does give us a
reasonably exclusive right to pursue" a joint venture with
Tengizneftegaz, the Soviet oil firm, which would serve as
Chevron's partner. The proposed project, called Sov-Chevroil,
would involve exploration and production activities over
8,900-square-miles in the northeast Caspian Sea region.</p>
<p>The talks between Chevron and the Soviets were facilitated
by the American Trade Consortium, a group formed in early
1988 by American companies looking to pursue joint ventures
in the Soviet Union through the Soviet Foreign Economic
Consortium. In March, 1989, the two organizations signed a
general trade agreement and have since been negotiating about
25 potential joint ventures. Other companies in the American
consortium include the agricultural company
Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., photography-products company
Eastman Kodak Co., consumer-products maker Johnson & Johnson,
and food and tobacco giant RJR Nabisco Inc.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the American and Soviet consortiums agreed to
form a new committee in the Soviet Union to develop and
implement a so-called "accelerated economic development
program" that would create additional joint ventures to
produce consumer goods, medical equipment, and "other
projects of mutual interest," and work to modernize the
Soviet food, agribusiness, health care, and oil-field
equipment industries.</p>
