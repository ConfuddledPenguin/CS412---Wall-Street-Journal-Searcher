	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- The Soviet Union, caught in a cash squeeze and
hounded by trade creditors around the world who are owed
hundreds of millions of dollars, is depositing large amounts
of gold with Western banks as collateral for loans, London
and Swiss bullion dealers say.
   Delays in payments to West German, Japanese, Scandinavian,
Australian, New Zealand and other suppliers have discouraged
foreign bankers from lending to the Soviet Union, bankers
say. So Moscow is raising dollars through a series of gold
swaps and commodity sales to repay its creditors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>State organizations will sell "goods out of our stocks" to
raise 1.5 billion rubles ($2.5 billion), said Viktor
Gerashchenko, chairman of Gosbank, the Soviet state bank,
according to a Reuters report from Moscow. He added that the
U.S.S.R. would continue to offer gold swaps to Western banks.</p>
<p>"The Russians already have around 200 to 300 metric tons
of gold tied up in swap deals," says Edwin Arnold, metals
analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co. in London.</p>
<p>The gold, which is from Moscow's monetary reserves,
bullion dealers say, is deposited in the lender's vaults in
return for a foreign-exchange credit. The transaction is
normally pegged at 25% below the market value of gold for
periods of six to 12 months. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union is
actively selling its current gold production, estimated at
250 to 300 tons a year, dealers say.</p>
<p>There will be more swaps in coming months, bullion
analysts say, and the gold is likely to be supplied from the
Soviet Union's gold reserves, estimated at 2,000 metric tons.</p>
<p>"Huge quantities of Soviet gold were shipped to Zurich and
London during the past few weeks," says Philip Klapwijk, an
analyst at Gold Fields Mineral Services Ltd., a London
consultant that specializes in gold. Included in these
shipments are deliveries of 100 to 150 metric tons of
"`substandard gold" to a British precious metals refinery,
Mr. Arnold says. This gold, which is being purified to
acceptable international market standards, was obviously
produced years ago, he says.</p>
<p>Moscow's inability to pay in a timely fashion for such key
imports as steel pipe from Japanese foundries, wool from
Australia and New Zealand, and more than $1 billion of grain
from the U.S. and other nations, has focused bankers'
attention on the U.S.S.R.'s large net international debt of
$36.5 billion, analysts say. So it has little alternative but
to use its gold reserves to bolster its tarnished credit
rating, they say.</p>
<p>Moscow's unpaid trade bills began piling up after Soviet
authorities allowed individual companies and other state
entities to import directly from abroad without having to go
through the official importing organizations. Many of the
enterprises apparently ordered more than they could pay for
in hard cash, and Moscow has refused to guarantee payment as
it did in the past. Soviet officials said last month that
they were setting up an internal collection agency and had
begun drawing on Moscow's hard currency reserves to help
cover overdue bills abroad, as the slowdown in payments was
affecting the country's credit rating.</p>
<p>Most of the Soviet gold swaps already in place were
negotiated in the first quarter, bullion dealers say, partly
because of a slump in the nation's oil production and
exports, a major source of Moscow's hard-currency earnings.
Problems at a major Siberian oil field and shortages of
equipment and pipelines contributed to a decline in Soviet
oil output to about 11.8 million barrels a day in the past
few months from about 12.4 million barrels in the first
quarter of last year, estimates Mari Buglass, an oil analyst
at Shearson Lehman Hutton Ltd. in London.</p>
<p>Gold swaps normally don't have any impact on the price of
gold, dealers say. Yet some of the Soviet swaps were
negotiated at prices of more than $400 an ounce, according to
Mr. Arnold, the Merrill Lynch metals analyst. If the Soviets
can't raise funds to repay the loan, the gold collateral
might have to be sold on the open market, he says.</p>
