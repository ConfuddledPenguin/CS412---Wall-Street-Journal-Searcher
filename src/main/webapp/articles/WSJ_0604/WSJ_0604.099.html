	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- Air Liquide S.A. said it will aim for a 12%
annual rate of growth in per-share earnings over the next two
or three years. The industrial gases concern previously
reported that consolidated net income in 1989 rose 14% to
1.806 billion francs ($315.5 million).
   Air Liquide Chairman Edouard de Royere told a group of
analysts that the group's projection assumes an annual
inflation rate of 4% and a yearly expansion of 3% in world
gross national product.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Annual growth of 12% in the group's per-share earnings
would represent a slowdown from 1988 and 1989, when increases
of 13.9% and 13.6%, respectively, were recorded.</p>
<p>Reflecting the need to finance an ambitious investment
program, the gases group's debt-to-equity ratio rose last
year to 35% from 33%, and Mr. de Royere said the earnings
projection assumes that this ratio will remain steady in the
next few years.</p>
<p>Air Liquide's 1989 profit was boosted by a non-recurring
gain of 320 million francs from the sale of its 5%
shareholding in Societe Centrale d'Investissement when Cie
Financiere de Suez and Jean-Marc Vernes were battling for
control of the Victoire insurance group.</p>
<p>Mr. de Royere said one of Air Liquide's goals is to expand
the group's share of the West German industrial gases market
from 4% at present to 20%, in line with the group's presence
in other national markets.</p>
<p>Asked to comment on rumors that his group might be
interested in linking up with Linde AG of West Germany, Mr.
de Royere said he didn't believe that Linde's industrial gas
business was for sale.</p>
<p>Edzard Reuter, head of West Germany's Daimler-Benz AG
industrial group, was appointed to Air Liquide's supervisory
board last week. Mr. de Royere indicated that Mr. Reuter's
contacts in German industry would be useful.</p>
<p>Air Liquide recently acquired the bottled gases activities
of the East German company Chemihandel for a "symbolic" sum.
The French group hopes that this will provide a strong base
for future expansion after the unification of the two
Germanies.</p>
<p>Mr. de Royere acknowledged that Air Liquide is practically
absent from the United Kingdom, saying it isn't a priority
area at this time. The group is taking a pragmatic,
step-by-step approach regarding external growth, he added.</p>
<p>Air Liquide's chief executive indicated that the group
doesn't have any pressing desire to hold on to its 18.3%
holding in Societe Chimique de la Grande Paroisse, a
chemicals company that is two-thirds owned by the French
group Orkem S.A. The remaining shares are held by the public.</p>
<p>Air Liquide decided last year on a 7.4 billion-franc
investment program that will boost the group's production
capacity more than 20% in the next few years, Mr. de Royere
said. The group's world-wide capacity is currently 40,000
tons of gas in gaseous form and 17,000 tons of liquid gas.</p>
<p>The cost will be spread over the next two to three years,
the official added.</p>
<p>Mr. de Royere said last year was "difficult" for the
industrial gases industry in the U.S. due to a price war that
forced operators to shave their profit margins.</p>
<p>Like its U.S. competitors, Air Liquide has embarked on a
program of streamlining and restructuring in an effort to
restore an adequate level of profitability. "The fruits of
this effort will be seen in the second half of this year," he
added.</p>
<p>Air Liquide acquired Big Three Corp. in the U.S. in 1986
for more than $1 billion, boosting the French group's market
share to more than 20%.</p>
