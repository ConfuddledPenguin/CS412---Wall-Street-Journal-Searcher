	<p class="article-leader">Hollywood producers are turning Red Square into their
latest back lot, and they have the blessing of the Soviet
Union's top mogul.
   In fact, when Mikhail Gorbachev chatted with entertainment
magnate Ted Turner, actress Jane Fonda and physician Robert
Gale during a lunch at the Soviet Embassy in Washington last
week, they talked a bit about movies made in the U.S.S.R.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It was a timely subject. Last Wednesday in Moscow, Carolco
Pictures Inc. and Turner Network Television began filming
"The Final Warning," a television movie about Dr. Gale
(played by John Voight), who treated radiation victims after
the nuclear accident at Chernobyl.</p>
<p>"I told Gorbachev the film was going very well," Dr. Gale
says. "Jane told him what it was like to make the first
co-production with the Soviet Union in 1976 {`The Blue
Bird'}. It's light-years of difference now. We're proceeding
without interference."</p>
<p>The Soviet movie industry is changing rapidly in the wake
of glasnost and perestroika. In a bid for hard currency,
Soviet film companies have been aggressively trying to lure
more big-spending Hollywood film crews inside Soviet borders
for co-productions and other types of service agreements. And
more producers are starting to take the bait.</p>
<p>Soyuzkinoservice, a Soviet film finance, production and
distribution company also known as SKS, even opened a new
office in Hollywood last year, the USSR Film Service Corp.,
as a joint venture. To make its presence known, it held gala
parties in October and February. More than 800 movie types,
including Mr. Voight and producer Paul Maslansky, went to the
latest party and were courted with vodka, caviar and blinis.</p>
<p>Progress has been somewhat slow. After a year, the USSR
Film Service, headed by Soviet-born Yuri Spilny, has
negotiated or is in the process of negotiating 10 co-ventures
or service agreements for movie projects. There are two
projects on Chernobyl in the works, a TV miniseries about
Leon Trotsky, a contemporary version of "Crime and
Punishment," a movie about the Nazi siege of Leningrad and a
science-fiction project, among others.</p>
<p>What are the Soviets offering? Locations such as Red
Square and the Winter Palace, a lot of extras at very low
prices, military equipment, period costumes, translators,
hard-to-get hotel reservations, Soviet production teams.</p>
<p>In exchange, they typically request hard currency and
distribution rights in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
In some cases, a cut of the profit. They are also upgrading
their rental equipment, and they want to train their own film
makers in special effects.</p>
<p>For "The Final Warning," SKS is providing the use of a
nuclear power plant 500 miles east of Moscow, Soviet army
troops, helicopters, equipment and crew for around $1
million. The Soviet Union will also get the distribution
rights in the U.S.S.R. and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Co-productions between the Soviets and U.S. film makers
aren't entirely new. The Soviets set up SKS 20 years ago, and
several U.S. movies, such as "Blue Bird" and "Red Heat," have
been filmed in Russia. But before glasnost, the Soviet
bureaucracy made it difficult to get movies made. There are
legendary stories in Hollywood about films brought to a
screeching halt by KGB agents and customs officials.</p>
<p>In the past two years, the largest of the Soviet Union's
39 movie studios have been decentralized and are now allowed
to negotiate deals on their own to earn some profits. So a
few are now competing with SKS to provide film services.</p>
<p>"The Soviet Union is starting to look a lot like
Hollywood," says Ilmar Taska, director of Soviet projects for
Fries Entertainment. "New companies are growing like
mushrooms in the rain."</p>
<p>The mostly independent producers who are starting
negotiations are wary of the uncharted territory. "It's a
whole new world with the Soviets. The rules are changing
literally as we speak," says Bob O'Connor, who is talking to
USSR Film Service about making a contemporary version of
"Crime and Punishment" in Leningrad. "You're a babe in the
woods."</p>
<p>Some recent veterans say negotiating a contract in the
Soviet Union can be slow going. The Soviets also lack much of
the equipment that Hollywood producers take for granted, such
as a large number of portable toilets, dressing rooms and big
hotel suites. Just making a phone call from the Soviet Union
to the U.S. or Europe often requires a reservation and may
take hours.</p>
<p>Dr. Gale says that in working on "Final Warning," he
suggested actors use an ophthalmoscope, the flashlight device
doctors use to examine eyes. "In Los Angeles we would have
had one in two seconds, but there it became a major
undertaking," he says. A number of doctors contacted didn't
have one, and when the crew found a doctor who did, he wasn't
eager to part with it for a day.</p>
<p>One recently completed film, "The Russia House," a Soviet
love/spy story starring Sean Connery and Michelle Pfeiffer,
is scheduled for release by Pathe Communications Co. later
this year. Mr. Maslansky, producer of the $20 million movie,
says he negotiated the film services he needed through Corona
Film, a private company that worked with Mosfilm Studios, one
of the main Soviet studios. Mr. Maslansky says it took about
4 1/2 weeks to iron out the details of what the Soviets would
provide, and the process was "arduous and rather complex."</p>
<p>He finally agreed to pay about 2.8 million rubles (in
dollars at a rate he won't disclose) in exchange for Soviet
production services, including hotel reservations,
transportation, technical personnel and some equipment. But
most of the movie equipment he needed just wasn't available
in the Soviet Union. So Mr. Maslansky brought in about 40
vehicles, including portable dressing rooms and toilets,
along with trucks for electrical equipment.</p>
<p>The producer also flew in a caterer from England to survey
food supplies. The caterer concluded that "we better bring
everything in," the producer says. So Mr. Maslansky brought
in four catering trucks with enough beef, frozen vegetables
and fruit to feed 120 crew members breakfast and lunch for
about two weeks.</p>
<p>Despite the physical obstacles, Mr. Maslansky describes
the Russian production team as "first rate." And he says the
filming "rates as one of the best film experiences I have
had." He also notes: "You go to the Soviet Union for the
locations. You don't go to save money. . . . It's terribly
difficult to get a movie done, but everything is possible."</p>
<p>For others, negotiations within the Soviet studio system
can become confusing. Fries Entertainment agreed to make a
movie called "In Siberian Captivity" with a Soviet director;
Fries later found that the director had moved the project
from one studio to another, requiring renegotiation of
services. In addition, the director kept asking for "more and
more money." At one point, "It wasn't clear who had the
rights to the project," says Fries's Mr. Taska. Fries finally
dropped the project at the end of last year. "It wasn't a
workable situation," says Mr. Taska. Fries still plans to
produce two other movies in the Soviet Union, and Mr. Taska
says: "Generally those talks have been satisfactory. It's not
always such a problem."</p>
<p>The Soviets have a more active role in actual
co-productions, such as "900 Days: The Siege of Leningrad," a
movie about the Nazi effort to take the city. Alberto
Grimaldi, a producer who negotiated through USSR Film Service
and SKS, says the Soviets are going to provide "everything
necessary to film the movie," including tanks, armies and
crowds. In exchange, the Soviets will get 40% of the net
income, plus distribution rights in Eastern Europe, India and
the U.S.S.R.</p>
<p>Producers have been pleasantly surprised by the Soviet
willingness to participate in projects that might seem
controversial. Producer Josef Shaftel says he met with USSR
Film Service about making a four-hour miniseries on Trotsky.
"They flipped out over the idea," he says. Mr. Shaftel, who
made an earlier movie on Trotsky, says the Soviets agreed to
provide a Russian writer who is translating previously
undisclosed material from historical archives on Stalin,
Lenin and Trotsky.</p>
<p>The Soviets are also paying for living expenses in the
Soviet Union for more than a week for a research trip for Mr.
Shaftel, his wife and a writer. "With the opening of the
archives, they are being very honest and open. It's
extraordinary," says Mr. Shaftel. "Now I have access to
material I didn't have 20 years ago."</p>
<p>As Hollywood interest grows, some film executives expect
that the Soviets may become less generous in their
negotiations. "The dollar has a lot of value right now, and
the terms are affordable and interesting for Americans," says
Mr. Taska. "But as the Soviets enter the world market, their
prices may catch up. They know how much films cost in
Hollywood and France."</p>
