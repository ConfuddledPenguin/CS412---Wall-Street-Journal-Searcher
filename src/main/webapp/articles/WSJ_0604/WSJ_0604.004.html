	<p class="article-leader">In a highly unusual move, a federal judge and a state
judge said they will hold a joint trial -- with the two
judges presiding over two juries sitting in one courtroom --
if efforts to settle 571 asbestos cases fail.
   Lawyers working on the cases said they know of no
precedent for simultaneous federal and state trials. U.S.
District Judge Jack Weinstein and New York state Justice
Helen Freedman provided few details as to how such a plan
would be carried out. Earlier this year, the judges appointed
lawyer Kenneth Feinberg to oversee efforts to settle the
federal and state cases.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The judges set a Sept. 18 trial date for cases that aren't
settled. The 571 cases involve workers at the Brooklyn, N.Y.,
Navy Yard who were exposed to asbestos, which can cause
respiratory ailments and cancer. More than 40 former asbestos
makers are named as defendants.</p>
<p>"This is unprecedented," said Mr. Feinberg, a partner at
Kaye Scholer Fierman Hays & Handler. "It is another attempt
by the court to find another way to manage the trials of
these asbestos cases."</p>
<p>The judges appeared to be using the threat of a massive
dual trial as leverage in encouraging the parties to settle.
"We want you to concentrate on getting the information you
need and settling these cases," Judge Weinstein told defense
lawyers at a hearing Friday.</p>
<p>Mr. Feinberg said he is still optimistic that the cases
can be settled during the next few weeks. Settlement
proposals have been made to all the defendants, but only half
a dozen have responded, he told the judges. He said he will
spend the next few weeks trying to negotiate a total
settlement offer that can be presented to the plaintiffs'
attorneys.</p>
<p>Defense attorneys say the possibility of a massive trial
could encourage a settlement. "It certainly is a hammer,"
said Gita Rothschild, co-lead counsel to the defendants in
the Brooklyn Navy Yard cases. She said the combination of so
many different cases makes it difficult to get a fair trial.
"If you are going to try 571 cases fully on each one's merits
you'd be there now until the cows come home," she said. "I
have no reason to doubt that Judge Weinstein means what he
says about having a trial, but there's got to be some
realistic structure established."</p>
<p>Perry Weitz, co-lead counsel for the asbestos victims,
said he expects some of the cases to go to trial. "Judge
Weinstein is not a man to be toyed with," he said. "Like any
judge, he is using the trial as a tool (to push for a
settlement). But he will not postpone it. He will try these
cases."</p>

<p>A SALES TAX on newspapers was ordered by the Florida
Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Florida's high-court ruled that a state sales-tax law that
levies a 6% tax on magazines but exempts newspapers is
discriminatory and struck down the exemption on newspapers.</p>
<p>Magazine Publishers of America Inc., Time Warner Inc.,
Hearst Corp. and others had claimed in a suit filed in Leon
County Circuit Court that the sales-tax law violates the
First Amendment and illegally differentiated between
newspapers and magazines.</p>
<p>The magazine interests were hoping to have the tax on
magazines scrapped, but the suit backfired. The high court
said instead that the proper solution was simply to tax
newspapers as well. The state's high court rejected the
magazine publishers' argument that the tax violates freedom
of the press guarantees.</p>
<p>The Florida Supreme Court decision reversed the Leon
County Circuit Court's ruling that held that the sales tax on
magazines was indeed a first amendment violation and struck
down the tax.</p>
<p>William Hyde, a lawyer for the Florida Press Association,
which intervened in the interest of newspapers, said the
association will ask the court to reconsider its unanimous
decision.</p>
<p>He said newspaper interests may appeal to the U.S. Supreme
Court.</p>

<p>A JUDGE REFUSED to step down from an oil-company antitrust
case.</p>
<p>The federal judge in Los Angeles had been accused of
conflicts of interest by lawyers for the city of Long Beach
and the state of California in an antitrust suit they filed
against six oil companies.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge William L. Gray proclaimed his
impartiality in the case, which he has presided over since
the state and city filed their suit against the companies in
June 1975.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs allege that the concerns conspired to pay
artificially low prices to the state and city for oil
produced from state-owned tidelands. The defendants are
Chevron Corp., Texaco Inc., Unocal Corp., Mobil Corp., Royal
Dutch/Shell Group's Shell Oil Co. unit and Exxon Corp.</p>
<p>In 1984 and 1985 Judge Gray issued a series of summary
judgments, effectively throwing the case out. But last year
the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed his
findings, reviving the case.</p>
<p>After a 10-month investigation, the plaintiffs' attorneys
disclosed in their recent motion to disqualify the judge that
Elizabeth Gray, the judge's wife, had signed a lease with
Texaco to drill for oil on property she owns. The lawyers
charged that Mrs. Gray owns 10 shares of stock in Chevron.
The inquiry was first disclosed in the Los Angeles Daily
Journal, a legal trade publication.</p>
<p>The lawyers also claimed that since the case began, Judge
Gray has attended several seminars in Florida sponsored by
defendants. Experts who lectured were working for the
concerns in connection with the pending case, the lawyers
have said.</p>
<p>The motion was filed on behalf of state Attorney General
John Van de Kamp and Long Beach City Attorney John R.
Calhoun.</p>
<p>In an interview last week Judge Gray said, "Neither my
wife nor I has had an equitable interest in any defendants,
except for the Chevron stock which neither she nor I was
aware of until it was distributed from a family partnership
about three months ago and she will be glad to divest herself
of it."</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Robert M. Takasugi will decide whether
Judge Gray must step down.</p>

<p>THREE LAWYERS were ordered to pay damages to their former
firm.</p>
<p>The Philadelphia lawyers took client files from their law
firm to start their own partnership and were ordered to pay
compensatory damages to their former firm.</p>
<p>The case, one of a handful in the country, illustrates
problems that develop when lawyers break away from firms and
lay claim to clients, even clients they represented. In this
case, a Pennsylvania appellate court panel found the three
lawyers interfered with the firm's contracts with the clients
and could be held liable to the firm for compensatory
damages.</p>
<p>Richard P. Myers, Alan I. Reich and Robert E. Paul worked
as associates for Joseph D. Shein P.C., a law firm
specializing in personal-injury and asbestos cases. They
signed stipulations that Mr. Shein would receive half the
fees from the clients they brought to his firm.</p>
<p>But in October 1985, the three decided to form their own
practice. After consulting a lawyer they moved 400 of the
firm's case files in a rental truck to new offices, began
calling clients and urged them switch their business to the
new firm.</p>
<p>Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas Judge Abraham J. Gafni
immediately ordered the files returned and blocked the
lawyers from further contact with the clients. In a
subsequent ruling, he found the three wrongfully interfered
with Mr. Shein's contracts and ordered each of the clients
who switched over to the new partnership to "re-select their
attorney."</p>
<p>Approximately 290 stayed with the three lawyers, and that,
in turn, prompted Mr. Shein to sue for damages. In May 1989,
Judge Gafni awarded $10,000 in punitive damages for the
removing of the files, but refused to order damages to
compensate Mr. Shein for his lost clients. The judge reasoned
that the "re-selection process" he ordered expunged the three
partners of liability. Those clients who stayed with the new
partnership, the judge reasoned, left Mr. Shein voluntarily.</p>
<p>But the three-member appeal panel rejected that theory,
saying the lawyer's conduct met the legal test of wrongful
interference with a contract. The panel ordered Judge Gafni
to access damages.</p>
<p>Philadelphia lawyer Judy F. Berkman, who represented the
three lawyers in the appeal, said the ruling raises
fundamental questions about a client's right to choose a
lawyer and plans to ask the full appeal court to reconsider
the decision.</p>
<p>Mr. Shein's attorney, Thomas F. Johnson, declined comment.</p>

<p>PUBLIC HAZARDS can't be concealed by a court order under
new Florida law.</p>
<p>The law, which was signed Friday and takes effect July 1,
prohibits courts from sealing records that contain
information about a public hazard. The legislation -- the
first comprehensive law of its type in the nation -- was
vigorously opposed by automobile manufacturers and
pharmaceuticals companies, which are frequent targets of
product-liability suits.</p>
<p>The Association of Trial Lawyers of American called the
law "a tremendous victory for the public's right to know."
Manufacturers have increasingly insisted that court records
and information related to product-liability litigation be
kept secret as part of settlement agreements.</p>
<p>Secrecy makes it far more difficult for the public to
ascertain that a hazard exists, the trial lawyers argued.</p>
