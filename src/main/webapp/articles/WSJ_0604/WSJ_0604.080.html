	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency, in an
effort to curb smog, plans to require further reductions in
the evaporation rate of gasoline sold during the summer.
   The agency estimates that the changes, which won't take
effect until 1992, will cost the nation's oil refiners about
$464 million a year and increase retail gasoline prices about
a penny a gallon. Partly offsetting this cost, the agency
figures, will be about $234 million a year in benefits to
consumers through increased fuel economy and reduced loss of
gasoline through evaporation.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The delay is designed to give the industry time to convert
refineries to produce adequate supplies of the new fuel.</p>
<p>The regulations set limits that will require oil refiners
to reduce the volatility, or tendency to evaporate, of fuel
to be sold from May 1 to Sept. 15. Gasoline vapors form smog
when they react with other chemicals in sunlight.</p>
<p>Cars contain canisters to catch fumes, but these devices
have become inadequate as gasoline volatility has increased
in recent years. The EPA addressed the problem last year with
its first set of warm-weather standards, which the agency
says has reduced smog-forming emissions as much as 6%
nationwide.</p>
<p>The latest rules are expected to cut smog-forming
emissions an additional 7%. They will require gasoline
volatility ranging from 7.8 to 9 pounds of pressure per
square inch of evaporating gasoline, with the lower limit
required in warmer states. States can request higher or lower
standards, within a range of seven to nine pounds, if local
economic or environmental conditions warrant it. Currently,
summer volatility is required to range from nine to 10.5
pounds a square inch.</p>
<p>EPA administrator William Reilly said, "Gasoline
volatility control will achieve the largest emissions benefit
of any remaining control strategy EPA has identified to
reduce emissions of the volatile organic compounds that
produce smog."</p>
<p>Pending clean-air legislation also would require auto
makers to enlarge or change the canisters to catch vapors
that escape during refueling. The legislation would require a
Transportation Department study of safety issues before these
changes could be required, however.</p>
