	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Normandy Securities Inc. and two principals
consented to fines totaling nearly $141,000 to settle charges
by the National Association of Securities Dealers that they
violated certain rules.
   The Normandy settlement, in which the firm and principals
didn't admit or deny any wrongdoing, was among a number of
disciplinary actions announced by the self-regulatory agency
for the over-the-counter market.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The NASD alleged that Normandy Securities, through
principal Norman Gottlieb of East Chester, N.Y., bought for
its account shares of a new issue that began trading in the
secondary market at a premium to the offer price. The agency
also charged that Normandy financial and operations principal
Paul Lenok, New Rochelle, N.Y., bought units in the new issue
through an account of a corporation that he and his wife
owned.</p>
<p>An NASD official explained that a securities firm that
handles such a so-called hot new issue must make a "bona fide
public distribution" of the shares and can't buy them for its
own account or accounts of certain related parties until
after public distribution.</p>
<p>Mr. Gottlieb said that "I was advised incorrectly by
in-house counsel, whom I've since terminated. . . . The NASD
realized that it was in fact an error and not deliberate."</p>
<p>Prescott, Ball & Turben of Cleveland and three employees
also settled NASD charges without admitting or denying
wrongdoing.</p>
<p>The agency charged that principal Andrew Geller, Bayside,
N.Y., and two representatives, Theodore Geller, Bellmore,
N.Y., and Leonard Greenberg, New York, caused the firm to
execute transactions in a security at or near the market's
close for the purpose of affecting the last-sale price at the
close. The transactions were executed at prices higher than
the previously reported trades, the NASD said.</p>
<p>Prescott was fined $15,000 and ordered to "comply with
certain undertakings." Each of the three individuals was
fined $15,000 and suspended from association with any NASD
member for 10 business days.</p>
<p>Gerald Baker, senior vice president and compliance
director for Prescott, said, "The charges involved technical
and interpretive violations and were settled to put the
matter behind and to avoid the time and costs associated with
defending them. The transactions involved were legitimate
trades and were fully paid for; there were no losses to
customers as a result of the trades."</p>
<p>Charles A. Roth, a Denver representative, was fined
$510,038, suspended for six months, and ordered to requalify
by exam as a representative.</p>
<p>The NASD charged that Mr. Roth conducted business as a
broker-dealer without being properly registered and effected
private securities transactions without properly notifying
his member firm. The agency also found that he received the
above amount in fees and expenses from seven insurance
companies for his participation in securities transactions
involving these companies.</p>
<p>Mr. Roth has appealed the decision to the Securities and
Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>The following were barred by the NASD. Fines are noted:</p>
<p>George D. Keaton, Murray, Utah, $125,000; Karol Ann
McKinster, Englewood, Colo., $50,000; Kenneth Roberts Jr.,
Crestwood, Ky., $40,000; Gary Lee Pierce, Lakewood, Colo.,
$35,000; Anthony Hamilton-Smith of Boulder, Colo., John
Robert Petrash of Del Mar, Calif., and Christopher Richard
Prycewood of Desert Hot Springs, Calif., $15,000 each; and
Dale Robert Schneider, Forest Park, Ohio, $5,000.</p>
<p>The following agreed to be barred without admitting or
denying wrongdoing: Robert Dornfeld, Somerset, N.J., and
Bryan S. Kogut, Orchard Park, N.Y. Each was fined $15,000.</p>
<p>The NASD disciplined the following individuals.
Suspensions and fines are noted:</p>

business days, $2,000, must requalify by exam; Paul D.
Enright, Littleton, Colo., 10 business days and $2,500; Wayne
Edward Humphreys, Orlando, Fla., $17,200; Ely Jay Mandell,
Agoura Hills, Calif., $15,000; Curtis Irving Wilson,
Bellevue, Wash., $10,000.</p>
<p>The following neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing:</p>
<p>Howard M. Russell, Harahan, La., two years and $15,000;
Kenneth Paul Hahn, East Palo Alto, Calif., six months and
$7,500; Mark Sam Simon, Brooklyn, N.Y., 90 days and $12,000;
