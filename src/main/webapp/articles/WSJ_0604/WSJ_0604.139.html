	<p class="article-leader">SPRINGFIELD, Mass. -- Boston University President John
Silber, whose maverick gubernatorial candidacy divided the
state Democratic party, narrowly won a spot on the primary
ballot, while former state Attorney General Francis X.
Bellotti won the party's endorsement.
   The long-dominant state Democratic party, facing its
strongest challenge in years, also gave Michael Dukakis's
lieutenant governor, Evelyn Murphy, a place on the ballot.
State Rep. John Flood was eliminated.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Silber, on leave from his university post, fought
against a rule that required support of at least 15% of party
delegates to get on the ballot. He said it excluded
candidates who had popular support but were opposed by
liberal party insiders. Mr. Silber has led in recent polls of
likely primary voters.</p>
<p>The convention here was marred by picketing Springfield
police officers, who delayed its start by more than three
hours as delegates refused to cross the line. But the
picketers, some of whom were chanting "four more years,"
clearly sided with the Republican party, leading to charges
that the protest -- over a contract dispute -- was
deliberately staged to disrupt the convention.</p>
<p>A White House political aide, Ronald Kaufman, and state
Republican Party Director Alexander Tennant were in
Springfield during the weekend, but denied any involvement in
the protest.</p>
