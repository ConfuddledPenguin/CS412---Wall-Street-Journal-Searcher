	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- The husband and wife who co-founded
Esprit de Corp. in 1968 and have been feuding ever since
finally reached a peace pact Friday: Doug Tompkins agreed to
relinquish his post as image director and sell his 50% stake
in Esprit's domestic operations -- to an investor group led
by Susie Tompkins, his wife.
   Esprit, one of the nation's largest apparel makers, had
been up for sale last year, after the couple's differences
became so intractable that they ceded operating control. The
settlement will allow Esprit to "stay within the family" yet
finally speak with "a single, unified voice," said Corrado
Federico, the chief executive officer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"This is a solution, not a victory," said Mrs. Tompkins,
who now has design and operational control as creative
director. "We have buried the hatchet," she said.</p>
<p>It's an ending that also firmly ejects Mr. Tompkins from
the controls. The roles are greatly reversed from only a few
years earlier when, over Christmas 1986, Mr. Tompkins came
close to firing Mrs. Tompkins over the telephone, while she
was on a business trip in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>But company officials said that this round of the couple's
war has been negotiated quickly and with few rancorous
displays on either side. "There was surprising little
haggling," said Isaac Stein, an Esprit director. "He {Mr.
Tompkins} decided this week, and three to four days later,
the papers were signed."</p>
<p>Esprit officers would not disclose the value of the deal,
except to say that it was a cash transaction. (The company
was reportedly appraised at about $380 million.) Mr.
Tompkins, who is leaving the company to pursue "environmental
interests," will retain control of Esprit Italy -- a unit
that includes operations in Spain, France and Italy -- and
will keep his shares in various other international
affiliates.</p>
<p>"The prospect of devoting my entire energy to social,
political and environmental issues is a beckoning and
tantalizing idea," Mr. Tompkins said. Apart from Mrs.
Tompkins taking over her husband's post, the management of
the company will not change, company officials said. Mr.
Federico will remain chief executive -- he was originally
appointed to that post in 1988 to resolve a court battle
between the warring couple.</p>
<p>Esprit's product line is expected to see some changes over
time. Mrs. Tompkins plans to realize a long-sought goal to
develop clothing for older, professional women. And Mr.
Federico said the company is considering expanding into
infant wear and boy's clothes.</p>
<p>As part of the deal, Esprit will also create an Employee
Stock Ownership Plan. Mrs. Tompkins said she would lend $10
million to fund the plan.</p>
<p>The investor group led by Mrs. Tompkins includes Mr.
Stein, an Esprit director since 1988 and president of
Waverley Associates, a private investment firm in Palo Alto,
Calif.; Michael Ying, an Esprit director since 1989 and
chairman of the Esprit Far East Group; and Bruce Katz,
founder of the Rockport Shoe Co. and Rosewood Stone Group, a
private investment firm in San Francisco.</p>
<p>The announcement comes at a time when Esprit's financial
picture and internal climate is finally starting to improve
from the turmoil that descended in 1986 -- with the company's
first losing quarter, a bout of layoffs, austerity measures,
and a management shakeup. This fiscal year just ended, Esprit
enjoyed its highest sales ever, company officials reported.</p>
<p>The company's sales went flat in 1986, after Esprit failed
to accommodate a fashion shift to more sedate, traditional
styles. Mrs. Tompkins's repeated efforts to re-tailor the
Esprit look to please older, career-oriented women were
thwarted by Mr. Tompkins, who believed Esprit stood for
youthful sexuality.</p>
