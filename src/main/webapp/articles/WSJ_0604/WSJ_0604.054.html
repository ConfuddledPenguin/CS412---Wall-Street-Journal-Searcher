	<p class="article-leader">LAS VEGAS, Nev. -- Circus Circus Enterprises Inc., a
hotel-casino company, reported net income for its first
quarter ended April 30 rose 1.1% to $19.2 million, or 70
cents a share, from $19 million, or 64 cents a share, a year
earlier.
   Average shares outstanding in the latest quarter declined
to 27.5 million from 29.9 million a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Revenue climbed 4.6% to $133.3 million from $127.5
million.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
Circus Circus shares fell $1.625, to close at $61.125.</p>
<p>The company said operating results at its Circus
Circus-Reno location in Nevada "rose markedly" from the
year-earlier period, when performance was soft because of bad
weather. The company's two properties in Laughlin, Nev., also
posted increases in operating results.</p>
<p>But the company's three Las Vegas properties had
"moderately lower" results in the quarter, reflecting a drop
of "several percentage points" in casino revenue, the company
said. Walk-in traffic at Circus Circus-Las Vegas was hurt by
competition from Golden Nugget Inc.'s new Mirage resort on
the Las Vegas Strip, Circus Circus said.</p>
