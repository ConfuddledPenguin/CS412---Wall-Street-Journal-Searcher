	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- France's gross domestic product in the first
quarter rose an inflation-adjusted 0.7% from the 1989 fourth
quarter, the National Statistics Institute said.
   The state agency said the data were in line with results
for the previous three quarters, which showed GDP increases
of 0.7% in the 1989 second quarter, 0.5% in the third quarter
and 0.9% in the fourth quarter; the fourth-period figure was
revised downward slightly from the previously reported 1%
rise. The institute doesn't provide year-to-year growth data
for GDP.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Paris market economists said the first-quarter GDP figure
was in line with their expectations and tended to confirm
their previous forecasts for a slight slowdown in 1990 from
the 4% rate that was measured on a similar merchandise basis
for 1989.</p>
