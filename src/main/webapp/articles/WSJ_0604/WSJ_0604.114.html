	<p class="article-leader">ASK W. EDWARDS DEMING about the future of the American
workplace, and he has a very simple comment: "What future?"
   Mr. Deming, 89 years old, was long known as the guru of
Japanese business who was largely ignored in his own country.
Since 1951, the Union of Japanese Scientists and Engineers
has awarded annual "Deming Prizes" to Japanese companies
excelling in quality control. Lately, though, many U.S.
companies have sought his advice as well. But he remains
pessimistic that U.S. business will make the changes he
thinks necessary to compete.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>What follow are excerpts from a discussion with Mr.
Deming.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: What do you think is wrong with
current management at corporations?</p>
<p>W. EDWARDS DEMING: We are all born with intrinsic
motivation, self-esteem, dignity, an eagerness to learn. Our
present system of management crushes that all out.</p>
<p>WSJ: How?</p>
<p>DEMING: By replacing it with extrinsic motivation, by
constantly judging people. We rank people with incentive pay,
annual appraisals, production quotas. Judging people is not
helpful. We can rank people according to height, and of six
people, one would be tallest, one would be shortest. So what?
You knew that before you started. That's the way business is
run today. And it will get worse.</p>
<p>WSJ: How are people supposed to know how they're
performing if they are not evaluated?</p>
<p>DEMING: People don't know how they're doing? All people
ask for is a chance to work with pride and joy. Management
has taken all of it out. Then you take quality out. Instead
of working for the company, people compete with each other.</p>
<p>WSJ: And competition is bad?</p>
<p>DEMING: Of course it's bad. People then work for the
grade. In school, they studied for the grade; not to learn
anything but for the grade.</p>
<p>WSJ: Is that different in Japan?</p>
<p>DEMING: Yes, it is. They work for the knowledge. And a
child is never humiliated in Japan.</p>
<p>WSJ: How about Japanese companies? Are they different?</p>
<p>DEMING: Yes. The Japanese top management were willing to
learn. They were willing to live by cooperation, not
competition.</p>
<p>WSJ: How great is the lead that Japan has over the U.S.
companies? Is it widening in management practices?</p>
<p>DEMING: I'm afraid so, although you find some practices
developing in Japan that ought to worry them. At some
companies, for example, there's differential pay. There's
just a small amount of it. But the fact that it exists is
what ruins people. If you were to get 50 cents more per month
than I do, it would hurt me. If I got 50 cents more per month
than you got, it's going to hurt you.</p>
<p>WSJ: When a company comes to you for advice on how to
improve their management, where do you start?</p>
<p>DEMING: I don't say much. I just ask questions.</p>
<p>WSJ: Such as?</p>
<p>DEMING: Where do you hope to be five years from now? Most
people can't answer the question. They don't have an aim. Or
many times the aim is simply to stay ahead of a competitor,
or at least not get too far behind. That's all people think
about -- competition.</p>
<p>WSJ: So just staying ahead of the competitor is not an
aim?</p>
<p>DEMING: That's destructive.</p>
<p>WSJ: But isn't competition where America is losing the
battle.</p>
<p>DEMING: That's right, that's where they are losing the
battle. Because they're focusing on competition. They show
diagrams and drawings to show how we're doing compared to the
competition. We don't think much about anything else.</p>
<p>WSJ: Whereas, they should be focusing on. . .?</p>
<p>DEMING: Better service to the public and employees.</p>
<p>WSJ: And they should be showing diagrams comparing
themselves to how they're doing against a goal?</p>
<p>DEMING: A goal?</p>
<p>WSJ: Let's say, our goal is to reduce workplace injuries
by 50% per year over the next 10 years.</p>
<p>DEMING: No, no, no. The goal should be reduced workplace
injuries. Put a figure on it, then you're wrong. That would
be destructive. You only get what the system will deliver.
The goal doesn't help you deliver.</p>
<p>WSJ: Are there any particular companies that you think, in
America, are exemplary at doing what you're talking about?</p>
<p>DEMING: Well, now and then there is a ray of hope in small
companies.</p>
<p>WSJ: Are there any exemplary large companies out there?</p>
<p>DEMING: Not that I know of. But make one thing clear:
Everybody is doing their best. And that's the trouble. Hard
work and best effort -- and doing it wrong. Without knowledge
-- there's no substitute for knowledge. And we don't have it.
What's the aim of the school of business, for example? They
teach students how business is conducted today and how to
perpetuate it. Any wonder we're in trouble? They ought to be
preparing students for the future, not for the past.</p>
<p>WSJ: Another criticism of American companies is that they
are too profit-oriented. Do you agree?</p>
<p>DEMING: They're not profit-oriented at all. They say they
are, but I don't see any evidence that they give a hoot about
profits. The only thing management can do today is lay off
people. The big losses go unknown and unknowable. If they did
care about profits, they would worry about these things.</p>
<p>WSJ: What are those losses?</p>
<p>DEMING: Well now. A woman called me from Chicago and asked
if she could have an hour of my time. She would arrive at the
airport at 7 a.m., rent a car and be here by 9. Now, my head
did a little arithmetic. She'd have to leave home at 2:30
Chicago time to catch a 4:30 flight. She'd have to get up at
1:30. She might as well stay up all night. I said, `Well, why
don't you come the night before?' She said that the company
would not pay her hotel bill. Also, the flight the night
before would cost her $138 more.</p>
<p>I began to comprehend. Her travel department gets a
special rate on the morning flight. So the travel department
gets a plus. But the woman gets six negatives, totally unfit
to go to that meeting. Why is the company sending her to the
meeting? To get rid of her? No. To learn.</p>
<p>It would be far better for the travel department to take a
beating, not to provide the cheapest transportation and get
that woman on the job fit for the job. But what's their job?
To save money. Can you blame them for doing it? Saving money,
ruining the company. It's these hidden losses that are the
big losses. Unknown, not even under suspicion.</p>
<p>WSJ: You've been fairly critical of automation as a way to
improve quality.</p>
<p>DEMING: It's all right in the right place. But it's not
the answer. It may be the right thing. But it has to be
managed.</p>
<p>WSJ: Can you give an example of the way automation is
mismanaged from what you've seen?</p>
<p>DEMING: Well, I sat next to a vice president at lunch. He
was so sorry that I didn't have time to go to one of his
plants. A lot of new equipment, automation, as if that made
quality. He thought it did. I said, Have you ever heard of a
plant that closed? Why did it close? Poor workmanship? Low
productivity? Mistakes? Faults? Never. Because it was
producing the wrong product. One that has no market. Not
enough market. Management didn't look ahead.</p>
<p>Ever heard of a bank that closed? Do you think it closed
because of sluggishness and errors, mistakes at the tellers'
windows, mistakes in bank statements, mistakes in calculation
of interest? Don't be silly. It closed because management
made bad loans. That's from incentive pay and ranking people.
A bank lending officer has a quota to lend $83 million per
month. He does it, and can you blame him? That was his job.
Other lending officers do the same. And the bank gets into
trouble.</p>
<p>WSJ: You've criticized "management by objective" several
times. What's so bad about MBO?</p>
<p>DEMING: You only get what the system will deliver. MBO is
used by people who have no idea about the capability of a
system. The system has a capability. Ask for something
outside its capability, and you'll not get it except for
destruction of the company. A manager will make it happen. He
better make it happen, that's his job. And to make it happen,
he'll ruin the company.</p>
<p>WSJ: For example.</p>
<p>DEMING: Take a manager of a store. He's allowed only 1%
shrinkage (loss from theft). He knows 60 ways to reduce it to
1%, and every one of them loses customers. Could you blame
him for doing his job? He wouldn't have a job if he doesn't
do it.</p>
<p>WSJ: What kind of changes do you foresee within the next
10 years? Will U.S. managers change?</p>
<p>DEMING: How can they learn? Why should they improve? How
could they learn? Experience teaches nothing. You learn only
with theory. There's no experience without theory, nothing to
record. So how could management improve?</p>
<p>I know what management will have to do if it plans to
survive. An example of a system well managed is an orchestra.
The various players are not there as prima donnas -- to play
loud and attract the attention of the listener. They're there
to support each other. In fact, sometimes you see a whole
section doing nothing but counting and watching. Just sitting
there doing nothing. They're there to support each other.
That's how business should be.</p>
<p>WSJ: So there's no harmony in American corporations?</p>
<p>DEMING: There's very little. Everybody's for himself. The
travel department should be supporting the rest of the
company, not trying to ruin it. You can't have an orchestra
that way. The system must be managed. It will not manage
itself. The components cannot manage themselves. And so many
companies have separate business plans for separate
departments. That's not management. That's foolishness.
That's the kind of thing that only makes things worse.</p>
